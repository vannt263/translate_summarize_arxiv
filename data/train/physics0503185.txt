    "optical , non imaging detectors are widely used for the detection of weakly interacting particles . at present",
    "the main focus of observation is on neutrinos and antineutrinos from various sources , but there are also plans to construct large optical detectors to search for as yet undiscovered particles such as wimps .",
    "the detection mechanism is based on the collection of visible or ultraviolet photons .",
    "these are emitted as erenkov radiation ( _ e.g. _ , as in kamiokande  @xcite and sno  @xcite ) or as scintillation photons .",
    "we will focus our attention in this paper on scintillator - based , unsegmented detectors .",
    "the history of scintillator - based detectors is heavily intertwined with that of neutrino physics .",
    "the first neutrino detector ever built , that of cowan and reines in 1953 , was a 10.7ft@xmath6 cylinder filled with a cadmium - doped organic scintillator and wavelength shifter , which detected reactor - generated @xmath7 s by observing the coincidence of @xmath8 annihilation and neutron capture following the inverse beta decay reaction @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "however , the first large - scale unsegmented liquid scintillator detector was not built until about 1980 .",
    "the 100  ton neutrino detector at artemovsk , ukraine , a cylindrical 5.6 m @xmath10 5.6 m tank filled with a saturated hydrocarbon scintillator and fluor , was a direct descendant of reines and cowan s original design .",
    "indeed , it was designed to detect antineutrinos using the same reactions  @xcite .",
    "it was buried in a salt mine , 600 meters water equivalent ( m.w.e . ) underground , and was later used to study the interactions of cosmic ray muons with scintillator  @xcite .",
    "the 1995 counting test facility ( ctf ) prototype of the borexino experiment further developed the architecture of scintillator - based detectors  @xcite .",
    "this 4  ton detector was intended primarily as a test bed for technologies of the full - scale borexino detector , not as a neutrino detector in its own right .",
    "nevertheless , it set a record for the lowest detector background achieved at the time , of 0.03counts/(kgkevyr ) , in the window 250kev to 2.5mev  @xcite .",
    "it has as a result produced new upper bounds on various exotic processes  @xcite . unlike previous scintillation detectors",
    ", it is spherical in design , in order to keep as much scintillator away from the surface as possible .",
    "liquid scintillator ( both pseudocumene and phenylxylylethane , at different times , again with added fluors ) is contained in a thin spherical nylon balloon , surrounded by 100 inward - facing photomultiplier tubes .",
    "this setup is contained in 1000  tons of ultrapure water in a cylindrical tank .",
    "the entire detector is 3400  m.w.e .",
    "underground in the gran sasso national laboratory , in central italy .",
    "the ctf first established the feasibility of a scintillator - based _ solar _ neutrino detector with a detailed study of the radioactive contaminants internal to the scintillator .",
    "it was also the first scintillation detector to introduce an inactive buffer ( water ) between the active volume of scintillator and the photomultiplier tubes .",
    "as well , it has the capability of position reconstruction for point - like events .",
    "the chooz detector  @xcite , built to study oscillations in reactor antineutrinos from a nuclear power plant by the same name in northern france , took data in 1997 - 98 .",
    "its layered design incorporated key features of the ctf and borexino designs , as well as those of other neutrino detectors such as the erenkov detector sno  @xcite , and the hybrid erenkov / scintillation light detector lsnd  @xcite .",
    "( the design of the larger hybrid detector miniboone , built in 1999 in order to confirm or refute results from lsnd by observing 0.5 - 1gev muon neutrinos produced at the fnal accelerator , was based upon the same principles  @xcite . )",
    "the interior of the chooz detector featured a central 5  ton gd - doped target mass inside a clear roughly egg - shaped plexiglas container , surrounded by an undoped 17  ton inactive buffer region contained in an oblong `` geode , '' and an outer undoped 90  ton volume with its own set of pmts , used for vetoing muons from cosmic rays .",
    "the detector was placed at a depth of 300  m.w.e .",
    "the current generation of unsegmented detectors based on organic liquid scintillators - kamland  @xcite , taking data since 2002 , and borexino  @xcite , soon to begin operations - retain this sort of layered design , both using the spherical shape of the ctf .",
    "unlike the detectors described already , borexino will observe scintillation light due directly to neutrino scattering from electrons , and can therefore potentially detect neutrinos with much lower energies ( the threshold @xmath11 energy for the inverse @xmath12 decay is 1.8mev ) .",
    "kamland has observed disappearance of @xmath7 from reactors using the inverse @xmath12 decay signature  @xcite , but it is also intended to observe solar neutrinos directly via @xmath11-@xmath13 scattering in the future . the current kamland background in the region below 2mev must be drastically reduced for that goal to be achieved  @xcite .",
    "these detectors are situated much deeper underground ( borexino : 3400 m.w.e ; kamland : 2700 m.w.e . ) , for further reduction of the residual muon flux and the production of short - lived cosmogenic isotopes .",
    "two new experiments with targets of liquified noble gas , also aiming at low energy solar neutrino detection via the detection of scintillation light , are currently under development : clean  @xcite and xmass  @xcite . in the case of clean , wavelength - shifter coated windows",
    "are offset from the pmts by a 5 - 10 cm gap which is a thin inactive buffer region .",
    "for these detectors , reliable determination of the positions of events is even more important , due to the need of rejecting the higher background rate coming from scintillation events produced in proximity of the pmts and container vessel .",
    "an additional complication arises because the mean scattering length of scintillation photons ( produced in the ultraviolet range of the spectrum for noble gases ) is much less than the radius of the detector ; scintillation photons propagate from the event origin to the pmts in a diffusive mode .",
    "therefore the times of arrival of detected photons provide less information than in detectors using organic scintillator ; these noble gas detectors will rely heavily upon the spatial pattern of pmt hits to reconstruct the positions of events .",
    "due to the extremely low interaction rates of neutrinos and their antiparticles ( to say nothing of wimps and so forth ) , it is necessary for a detector to contain a large mass of scintillator with very low levels of internal radioactive contamination  @xcite .",
    "ultra - pure materials are also used to screen radioactivity from materials surrounding the detector  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the photosensitive elements used to detect scintillation light are notorious for being among the main sources of radioactivity in an ultra - low - background detector .    it is therefore desirable to insert , between the photosensitive elements and the scintillator , one or more layers of buffer material to suppress radioactive background .",
    "often the buffers are inactive , _",
    "i.e. _ , not scintillating . an inactive buffer offers the advantage of minimizing the total trigger rate caused by the abundant radioactive decays generally produced within the photosensitive elements  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "if the compositions of the scintillator and inactive buffer are different , a scintillator containment system is required to physically separate them  @xcite .",
    "the containment system , being in direct contact with the scintillator , must satisfy extremely stringent requirements in terms of intrinsic radiopurity .    for additional background prevention , the outer region of the scintillator volume",
    "can be used as an active buffer .",
    "this allows any residual radioactivity coming from the containment system , or passing through it , to be monitored and suppressed .",
    "a `` fiducial volume '' is commonly defined as a region at the center of the active volume of the detector in which radioactive background is expected to be at a minimum .",
    "the discrimination between events belonging to the fiducial and to the non - fiducial regions is performed by means of software implementation ( reconstruction code ) of an algorithm ( reconstruction algorithm ) , which assigns to each single event a reconstructed position , either inside or outside the fiducial volume .",
    "the algorithm also provides a means of comparing the position of different events and is an important tool for the identification of several background sources .",
    "the designs of some planned detectors incorporate only a thin inactive buffer region or none at all , and in these cases , correct assignment of an event as belonging to the fiducial volume or the buffer region is even more important .",
    "the resolution of detector reconstruction codes are generally studied with monte carlo methods .",
    "event simulations allow close reproductions of the performance of these codes on real events .",
    "typically , however , the reconstruction codes are fine tuned by calibrating the detector with the use of localized sources of radioactivity or light .",
    "what seems lacking from the available literature is a comprehensive discussion of how the resolutions of detector reconstruction codes are related to some basic properties of the detector : the linear dimension , the time dispersion of the photon emission , the scintillator index of refraction , possible processes of absorption and re - emission and of scattering of the scintillator light , etc . in this paper",
    "we present an analytic study of the resolution for reconstruction in time and space of scintillation events .",
    "the study is restricted , for simplicity , to the case of events at the center of the detector , simple enough to be treated , within certain approximation , analytically .",
    "calibrations of experiments  @xcite and full monte carlo studies of the performance of proposed experiments  @xcite show anyhow that the resolution of the reconstruction codes depends only in a mild way upon the location of the scintillation event .",
    "this study also assumes that the optical properties of the media are uniform throughout the detector , and that the indices of refraction of all materials between the active scintillator and the photodetectors are approximately the same .",
    "the likelihood function is a standard statistical tool used for finding parameters of a physical model .",
    "suppose that a set of @xmath0 observations is composed of the independent values @xmath14 and dependent values @xmath15",
    "( @xmath16 ) .",
    "for instance , @xmath14 could be a list of times at which a radioactive sample is observed , and @xmath15 a list of observed activities at each time .",
    "we wish to model the data using some function @xmath17 with @xmath3 free parameters @xmath18 . in the example",
    ", the function would be a decaying exponential , and the parameters would be the initial activity and the half - life . by definition ,",
    "the likelihood function over the parameters is a probability distribution of obtaining the observed data given a specific set of parameters :    @xmath19    the difficult task is to calculate this probability based on the assumption that the data are correctly described by the model function @xmath17 .",
    "once this has been done , in order to calculate the most probable value of the parameters of the model , one simply finds the maximum of the likelihood function ( or , as is usually computationally easier , the minimum of @xmath20 ) in the @xmath3-dimensional space defined by the free parameters @xmath18 .    in the case of a scintillator - based detector ,",
    "the parameters of interest are the position and time of an event in the detector , @xmath21 .",
    "the observed data are the positions @xmath22 of the photosensitive elements , usually pmts ( independent values ) , and the times @xmath14 at which each element is hit by a photon ( dependent values ) ; @xmath23 ranges from 1 to @xmath0 , with @xmath0 being the number of detected photons .",
    "for now we assume that at most one photon is detected by each pmt , so all the @xmath24 s are distinct , and @xmath0 is also the number of pmts that detect a photon . for conciseness , define the following possible events :    * a : detector event occurs at @xmath25 * b : detector hit pattern is @xmath26 .",
    "then , equation  ( [ e : base - likelihood ] ) becomes @xmath27      let us assume that the times at which photons are emitted by the scintillator are uncorrelated .",
    "then the likelihood function will have one independent factor for the piece of data provided by each pmt pmts detected photons causes the pmt hit data to be correlated .",
    "for a reasonably large number of hit pmts , though , the difference should be negligible",
    ". it would be interesting to compare results derived from the often - used poisson and multinomial probabilistic models to the model put forth here ] .",
    "let the total number of working pmts be @xmath28 , so that @xmath0 pmts ( labeled @xmath29 ) have detected a photon , and @xmath30 pmts ( labeled @xmath31 ) have not .",
    "if we further define    * c@xmath32 : pmt @xmath23 is hit * d@xmath32 : pmt @xmath23 detects a photon * e@xmath32 : pmt @xmath23 detects a photon at time @xmath33 ,    then @xmath34 \\label{e : likelihood - factors}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ( where @xmath35 is the logical negation symbol ) .",
    "of course , @xmath36 is just the quantum efficiency @xmath37 of pmt @xmath23 , which is , to a first approximation , independent of the original event position .",
    "now define a `` per - pmt '' likelihood function @xmath38 .",
    "@xmath39    the total likelihood function is then the product of all per - pmt likelihood functions .",
    "notice that the per - pmt likelihood function of a supposedly dead pmt ( @xmath40 ) that does not detect a photon reduces to 1 , so does not influence the total likelihood function , just as expected .",
    "the first factor in the expression for the likelihood function of a pmt that detects a photon is based solely on timing information of a photon emitted by the scintillator .",
    "scintillation photons are emitted as a consequence of the ionization of the scintillator due to interacting particles or radioactive decays .",
    "the typical dispersion in the time of emission of organic liquid scintillators is on the order of a few nanoseconds , with a slower component that can reach hundreds of nanoseconds .",
    "the emission of photons is uniform over the solid angle . in this discussion",
    "we assume that the time of emission of each photon , relative to the time of the event causing scintillation , is an independent random variable @xmath41 .",
    "suppose the distribution of the random variable @xmath41 is given by some scintillator response function @xmath42 . referring to the left half of figure  [ f : scintpdf ]",
    ", one sees that at a specific time @xmath43 , this function may also be regarded as an outgoing spherical photon probability wave , integrated over the solid angle 4@xmath44 .",
    "in fact , the most important factor in equation  ( [ e : likelihood - factors ] ) , the probability @xmath45 be the time of flight from the origin @xmath46 of the photon to the position @xmath24 of the @xmath47 pmt .",
    "then , with @xmath3 being the scintillator index of refraction , we have : @xmath48 as a result , @xmath49    of course , factors other than the dispersion time of the scintillator may also affect the probability distribution function of the recorded arrival times of photons at pmts .",
    "the most important other effects are usually the effects of scattering in the scintillator and the finite time resolution of the pmts themselves .",
    "the latter may in general be incorporated into the distribution @xmath42 by convolution with the scintillator dispersion function .",
    "the former requires a bit more care because scattering effects depend in general upon the light path length from the event to the pmt ; an exact treatment is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "as photons travel away from their origin , they are attenuated by the familiar inverse square law .",
    "this implies a formula for the probability @xmath50 that a given pmt is hit by a scintillation photon .",
    "suppose a pmt of infinitesimal area , at a distance @xmath51 from the event , subtends a solid angle d@xmath52 as seen from the event location . assuming a perfect collection efficiency , it will collect only a fraction d@xmath53 of all photons emitted .",
    "so if @xmath54 photons were emitted , its probability of being struck by at least one of them is @xmath55    if the @xmath47 pmt has an area d@xmath56 and is tilted away from the line of sight by an angle @xmath57 , as shown on the right half of figure  [ f : scintpdf ] , then @xmath58 , so the resulting factor in the likelihood function is given by @xmath59    as mentioned already , all constant factors in a likelihood function may be discarded with no effect on the location in parameter space of its maximum .",
    "( to first order , this includes the quantum efficiency @xmath37 of each pmt . )",
    "the per - pmt likelihood function for a pmt detecting a photon may thus be redefined as @xmath60 its logarithm is @xmath61      for completeness , we now consider the case of a pmt that does not detect a photon produced by an event in the detector .",
    "its per - pmt likelihood function , from equation  ( [ e : per - pmt ] ) , is given by @xmath62          \\ ; + \\ ; \\left(1 - \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\omega_i}{4\\pi}\\right)^\\gamma          \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\ ; 1 - q_i + q_i \\left(1 - \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\omega_i}{4\\pi}\\right)^\\gamma          \\nonumber \\\\ & \\approx&\\ ; 1 - q_i \\gamma \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\omega_i}{4\\pi}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the logarithm of this per - pmt likelihood function is @xmath63 .",
    "this term , containing an infinitesimal , is negligible in size compared to the terms of equation  ( [ e : log - likelihood ] ) coming from per - pmt likelihood functions for pmts that have detected a photon .",
    "if pmts are in fact very small compared to any other relevant dimensions of the detector , it may therefore be ignored .",
    "as written , equation  ( [ e : likelihood ] ) is applicable to any detector with pointlike pmts forming the vertices of a convex polyhedron ( so that light from an event at any point inside the detector may reach any one of the pmts ) .",
    "let us specialize to a spherical detector of radius @xmath4 centered at the origin , having a uniform distribution of inward - facing pmts over the surface .",
    "as above , we call the distance from an event to the @xmath47 pmt @xmath64 . let the distance from the center of the detector to the event be @xmath65 , so we have the geometry of figure  [ f : circle ] .    by dropping a perpendicular from segment ob to point a ( shown as line segment ac ) , one readily sees that @xmath66 , with @xmath67 being the angle between the event and @xmath47 pmt seen from the origin .",
    "hence the likelihood function becomes @xmath68 where @xmath69 is given by the law of cosines , @xmath70",
    "it may be of interest to examine properties of the likelihood function in the particular case of a hypothetical event occurring at the center of a spherical detector .",
    "this allows the general nature of the problem of reconstruction to be understood analytically . for simplicity ,",
    "let s assume that the distribution of the time emission of the photons is a gaussian curve with width equal to the characteristic dispersion time of the scintillator : @xmath71    the same equation can also be used for the case when the original scintillation light is absorbed and then re - emitted by scintillation fluors in the immediate proximity of the energy deposition point @xcite . in this case , the dispersion characteristic of the scintillator is effectively broadened by the absorption and re - emission process .      for a point in the detector at a distance @xmath72 from the center , in the direction of a particular unit vector @xmath73 ,",
    "the log likelihood function is @xmath74 where @xmath69 and @xmath67 for each pmt are as shown in figure  [ f : circle ] .",
    "we assume that the number of hit pmts @xmath0 is sufficiently large that we can , with little error , replace this expression by spatial and temporal averages over the expected angular and time distributions of the pmt hits .",
    "that is ( discarding the constant term ) , @xmath75 where @xmath43 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 are now continuous random variables with the expected distributions .",
    "we now calculate these averages for a point - like event located in the center @xmath78 of the detector , occurring at time @xmath79 .",
    "first consider the time average .",
    "the time of flight of photons from the center to each pmt ( assuming minimal scattering ) is @xmath80 , where @xmath3 is the index of refraction and @xmath81 is the velocity of light in vacuum .",
    "this means that the distribution curve of @xmath43 is @xmath82 . from the properties of a gaussian distribution , the time averages of time - dependent quantities are @xmath83    likewise ,",
    "since all pmts are equidistant from an event at the center of a spherical detector , the distribution of pmt hits should be uniform over the solid angle .",
    "hence the spatial averages over quantities dependent upon the event - to - pmt angle @xmath77 can be found using equation  ( [ e : loc ] ) and taking the surface integral over the sphere of pmts : @xmath84    finally , we observe that for a point - like event in the center of a uniform sphere of pmts , there is no correlation between the expected spatial distribution of @xmath76 and temporal distribution of @xmath43 ; that is , @xmath85 .",
    "this and the above equations allow us to evaluate @xmath86    where the constant term contains whatever does not depend explicitly on @xmath87 and @xmath72 .    the quantity averaged over in the last term of equation  ( [ e : avg - likelihood ] ) , again substituting in equation  ( [ e : loc ] ) , becomes @xmath88 with the last equality above being the expansion into a taylor series in @xmath89 .",
    "by once again averaging the expected distributions in @xmath76 and @xmath77 over the solid angle , the result , obtained to second order in @xmath89 , is determined to be @xmath90 the complete likelihood function for an event at the center of a spherical detector , to second order in @xmath89 , is thus @xmath91 .",
    "\\label{e : likelihood - at - center}\\ ] ]      solving for the maximum of the likelihood function and requiring @xmath92 gives the expected solutions : @xmath93    we next ask about the expected resolution of the detector .",
    "notice that the information matrix is diagonal because the off - diagonal terms , @xmath94 , are zero when @xmath95 .",
    "the theoretical resolutions of the detector in space and time are therefore given by reciprocals of the second derivatives of the likelihood function : @xmath96 when the detector dimensions are much larger than the scintillator dispersion time , @xmath97 , we can approximate @xmath98 .",
    "( it should be noted that this does not take into account scattering effects , which become increasingly important with larger detectors . )    because of the spherical symmetry of the problem , @xmath99 can be used as a stand - in for any of the three cartesian spatial resolutions @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 .",
    "one may , for instance , make the substitution @xmath103 in equation  ( [ e : likelihood - at - center ] ) and obtain the same results for the resolution in each cartesian coordinate .      in case of use of a liquified noble gas as scintillator , as in the new generation of solar neutrino detectors @xcite",
    ", rayleigh scattering of the ultraviolet scintillation photons plays an important role .",
    "the photons are scattered intensely by the medium , such that they effectively diffuse out of the medium with a very long dispersion time ; then @xmath97 is no longer valid . in this case",
    ", the information carried by the time of flight method about the original position of the events becomes less reliable .",
    "however , it is still possible to reconstruct the original position of the event by taking into account that the density of hits on the pmts decreases with the inverse of the squared distance from the point where the energy is deposited  @xcite .",
    "suppose that we have no timing information , so our only information about an event is the pattern of hit pmts . in this case",
    ", the likelihood function simply determines the position of the event .",
    "it does not depend on time and can not be used to reconstruct the time itself .",
    "we may set the function @xmath42 to be constant and ignore it : @xmath104    by the same methods as above , we obtain @xmath105 for the second - order taylor expansion in @xmath89 of the likelihood function for an event at the detector center . in this case",

    "the true scintillator dispersion function of a detector @xmath42 is not actually a gaussian , so the use of equation  ( [ e : resolution ] ) is only an approximation .",
    "the value of 5.1  ns used for @xmath127 is obtained from the fit to ctf data described in reference  @xcite with the parameters shown in figure  6 of that paper , sampled at 1  ns intervals and fit to a gaussian only .",
    "( the same scintillator dispersion function was used in the borexino monte carlo simulations . ) nevertheless , the predicted , observed and monte carlo values of the position resolution are in quite good agreement . for the liquid ne detector , @xmath2",
    "was estimated at 10ns , based on figure  7 of reference  @xcite , as 1/2 the difference between times with probability values equal to @xmath128 times the value at the peak .",
    "one could plausibly estimate this value of @xmath2 to be anywhere in the range 5.5 to 15ns , yielding estimates of @xmath99 from 12.6 to 15.9 cm .",
    "this range brackets the monte carlo simulation nicely .",
    "so far it has largely been assumed that the occupancy of each pmt in the detector is at most one .",
    "if the detector has the capability to measure the time at which _ every _ photon hits a given pmt , or if the detector ( as with some of the proposed noble gas detectors ) has no timing capability at all , then the assumption may be lifted with no effect , except that some of the @xmath24 ( and hence @xmath67 and @xmath69 ) will be identical in equation  ( [ e : sph - likelihood ] ) . for a detector with timing capabilities , however , it is more likely that the detector only has the capability to measure the arrival time of the _ first _ photon to reach each pmt .",
    "the probability function of the first photon to reach a pmt is not the same as that of a random photon reaching the same pmt ; it is biased toward earlier times . to account for this bias",
    ", the scintillator response function @xmath42 must be corrected .",
    "let the probability function of the first photon to reach a pmt , out of the @xmath3 photons reaching that pmt from an event , be represented by @xmath129 .",
    "this is known as the `` first order statistic . '' naturally , @xmath130 . in general",
    ", the corrected scintillator response function @xmath131 would then be some linear combination of the first order statistics , @xmath132 and an _ a priori _ guess would have to be made for the probability that each possible number of photons had hit the pmt . for simplicity ,",
    "let us assume that the number of photons striking each pmt for an event is known ( in borexino , for instance , this is determined via adc channels separate from the timing channels ) .",
    "we can then set @xmath131 equal to the function @xmath129 .",
    "it remains only to calculate @xmath129 given @xmath42 and @xmath3 .",
    "number the emission time of the @xmath3 photons detected by a given pmt in some specific but randomly chosen order ( for instance , in order of increasing longitude of their emission directions ) , @xmath133 . also number them in order of increasing emission time , @xmath134 .",
    "then @xmath129 is the probability function of the randomly chosen emission time @xmath135 given that @xmath136 : @xmath137 | \\tau_1 = s_1 ) \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\ ; \\mathrm{p}(\\tau_1 = s_1 | \\tau_1 \\in [ \\tau , \\tau + \\mathrm{d}\\tau ] ) \\times \\frac{\\mathrm{p}(\\tau_1 \\in [ \\tau , \\tau + \\mathrm{d}\\tau ] ) } { \\mathrm{p}(\\tau_1 = s_1 ) } \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\ ; \\frac{p(\\tau_e)\\ , \\mathrm{d}\\tau_e}{(1/n)}\\ , \\mathrm{p}(\\tau_1 = s_1 | \\tau_1 \\in [ \\tau , \\tau + \\mathrm{d}\\tau]),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the second equality is once again due to bayes theorem .",
    "the probability in the last line above is just the probability that every other photon has a later arrival time than the randomly selected value @xmath135 : @xmath138 ) \\;&=&\\ ; \\prod_{i = 2}^n \\mathrm{p}(\\tau_i >",

    "( the specific response function shown is a gaussian , equation  ( [ e : gaussian ] ) offset by five units of @xmath2 from time zero . )",
    "note how as @xmath3 increases , the time distribution of the first pmt hit narrows and shifts toward earlier times .",
    "one may ask about the effect of this correction on the likelihood function and spatial resolution . consider again the case of a gaussian scintillator time response function .",
    "we have @xmath141.\\ ] ] substituting in @xmath142 , the taylor expansion to second order in @xmath41 becomes @xmath143 that is , the first photon detected at each pmt contributes to the log of the likelihood function in the amount of @xmath144 , but each additional photon contributes only in the amount of @xmath145 ( plus a term linear in @xmath41 which has relatively little effect on the resolution for a large detector ) ; compare to equation  ( [ e : gaussian ] ) . the resolution is better than if the corrected scintillator response function were not used , but still poorer than if the time of arrival of every photon could be measured .",
    "suppose that the total number of photons detected is @xmath109 , by @xmath0 pmts , and in particular that the @xmath47 pmt sees @xmath146 photons . denoting the emission time by @xmath147 , the general likelihood function is then @xmath148 define the excess photon multiplicity as @xmath149 .",
    "the likelihood function in the limit of homogeneous pmt coverage as @xmath150 , for an event at the detector center , becomes @xmath151 running through calculations analogous to those of section  [ ss : taylor - expansion],we finally obtain the explicit function @xmath152    in the limit @xmath153 ( that is , for a very large detector compared to the width of the scintillator response function ) , it can be shown that the spatial resolution at the center of a detector , with @xmath0 and @xmath154 varying while holding @xmath109 constant , is proportional to @xmath155 .",
    "hence the resolution of an event with an average photon multiplicity of @xmath156  excess photons per pmt is 6.7% worse than if pmts could detect the arrival time of every photon . with @xmath157  excess photon per pmt ( every hit pmt seeing an average of 2 photons ) ,",
    "the resolution is 10.5% worse . in the limit of large @xmath154 ( for instance with a high - energy event ) , the resolution reaches an asymptote of @xmath158 times ( about 25.3% worse ) that of an ideal detector observing an event of equal energy .",
    "realistically , construction of an ideal detector , one that measures the time of arrival for every photon , would be non - trivial .",
    "one may on the other hand ask , given a detector capable of measuring time of arrival only for the first photon at each pmt , how the use of the statistically corrected scintillator dispersion function improves the results over the use of an uncorrected function .",
    "this comparison is equivalent to fixing @xmath0 while ( for the uncorrected dispersion function ) setting @xmath154 to zero . in this case",
    ", the use of the corrected dispersion function is an improvement by the factor @xmath159 ( recall that smaller resolutions are better ) . for @xmath156 ,",
    "the reciprocal of the improvement factor is 1.15 , and for @xmath157 , it is 1.28 ; for large @xmath154 , it would theoretically improve without bound .",
    "this analysis even leaves aside the fact that for events offset from the center of the detector , use of the uncorrected scintillator dispersion function will produce a statistically biased position estimate .",
    "we analyzed the resolution of spherical , optical , non - imaging scintillation based detectors in reconstructing the position of point - like events , limiting the analytic derivation to the case of events near the center of the detector .",
    "we found that the fundamental length scale of the resolution given by the time of flight method is proportional to the product of the speed of light in the medium and the dispersion time at the scintillation emission , as in @xmath98 .    in case",
    "the dispersion of the scintillation photons arrival times grows above the ratio of the speed of light to the detector radius , the time of flight method no longer gives relevant information about the point of origin of the event .",
    "the position of the event can still be determined by the analysis of the density of hits , and in this case the fundamental resolution is set by the radius of the detector , as in @xmath160 .    finally , we made some comments on the need to correct the scintillation dispersion function in the common case where pmt hit timing information is only available for the first photon to strike each pmt . in this case , even with a corrected scintillation dispersion function , the spatial resolution will be up to 25  percent worse for high - energy events compared to a similar detector capable of measuring timing information for all photons .",
