    "the model of selective sweeps ( also called genetic hitchhiking ) predicts a reduction in sequence diversity at a neutral locus closely linked to a beneficial allele @xcite .",
    "most analysis of this model assumes that the beneficial allele is co - dominant .",
    "accordingly , genome scans for the evidence of recent positive selection test a neutral model against ( strong ) selection for a co - dominant allele .",

    "simulation results by @xcite and @xcite show that the false - discovery and false - negative rates of such methods increase if selection acts on a recessive rather than a co - dominant allele .    although adaptations are often assumed to be rather dominant than recessive @xcite , also the case of recessive beneficial alleles is well documented in the empirical literature .",
    "many cases that have been described concern resistance alleles .",
    "here , the loss of a function of a gene conveys resistance to a pathogen .",
    "often only the homozygous mutant is resistant , leading to a recessive sweep .",
    "examples include : ( i ) the duffy blood group locus in humans , where the homozygous null - allele ( fy-0 ) confers complete resistance to vivax malaria .",
    "@xcite report that the fy-0-genotype is at or near fixation in most sub - saharan african populations but is very rare outside africa , which suggests that it is locally under strong positive selection .",
    "( ii ) resistance to the yellow mosaic virus disease in barley has been mapped to several recessive resistance genes @xcite .",
    "( iii ) the plant gene eif4e ( present e.g.  in pepper , pea and tomato ) is a factor involved in basic cellular processes and can be used by viruses to complete their life cycle . only if the function of both gene copies is compromised , the plant is resistant and positive selection can act @xcite .",
    "( iv ) the yellow fever mosquito _ aedes aegypti _ is resistant to the drug permethrin , if both copies carry a replacement mutation in the gene para , as shown in @xcite .",
    "starting with the original publication by @xcite , an extensive body of analytical theory has been established for the hitchhiking model ( e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "in addition to results on reduced diversity and the frequency spectrum , linkage disequilibrium has been studied by @xcite . moreover ,",
    "the model was extended to the case of multiple origins of the beneficial allele due to mutation or from standing genetic variation @xcite .",
    "all these results are built around the simplest possible scenario for adaptation , where positive selection acts on a single locus without dominance . despite its empirical importance",
    ", dominance was only studied quite recently .",
    "@xcite use computer simulations to demonstrate the impact of intermediate dominance on the most important summary statistics for the frequency spectrum , see also @xcite .",

    "the case of a completely recessive beneficial allele , in particular , has not been treated in any of these publications .",
    "the goal of our investigation is the extension of previous analytical results to the case of arbitrary dominance .",
    "we focus , in particular , on the completely recessive case . while sweeps with intermediate dominance , @xmath4 , and selection coefficient @xmath0 produce diversity patterns similar to a co - dominant beneficial allele with selection coefficient @xmath5 ( theorem [ t2h ] ) , our results show that recessive sweeps , @xmath6 , are qualitatively different ( theorem [ t2 ] ) .",
