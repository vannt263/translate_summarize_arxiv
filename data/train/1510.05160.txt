    "ap star @xmath1 equ ( hd 201601 ; hr 8097 ) is an apparently bright object ( @xmath4 mag ) with a strong global magnetic field .",
    "its longitudinal component @xmath0 ( effective magnetic field ) exhibits very slow variations plus significant noise in the range from @xmath5 g to @xmath6 g. the total time period over which the magnetic field @xmath0 data have been recorded exceeds 60 years .",
    "the long - term variability of the longitudinal magnetic field of @xmath1 equ most likely is due to the very slow rotation of the star . that feature has been investigated in many papers",

    "all available @xmath0 points accumulated in published sources plotted against time are arranged as part of a sine wave with a long period .",
    "bychkov et al .",
    "( 2006 ) determined the period of long - term magnetic variations as @xmath7 years .",
    "however , savanov et al . ( 2014 ) determined this period as @xmath8 years after adding their new @xmath0 measurements .",
    "such a discrepancy between periods @xmath9 in both papers is probably the result of the application of different numerical methods in the particular case when an unknown period of @xmath0 variations is longer than the length of the observed time series .",
    "we believe that the most commonly used methods of period determination fail in such a case and yield inaccurate results .",
    "our paper aims to examine the systematic errors introduced by various commonly used methods of period determination in the particular case of the ap star @xmath1 equ .",
    "we aim to reliably determine the period of long - term @xmath0 variations , as well as to search for a possibly more rapid variability of this star .",
    "the longitudinal magnetic field @xmath0 of @xmath1 equ was routinely measured at the special astrophysical observatory ( sao ras ) in russia over many years .",
    "observations were carried out at the coud focus of the 1-m reflector . during the observational period ( 4190 days @xmath10 11 years ) we acquired a total of 95 @xmath0 measurements for this object .",
    "those observations are shown in table  [ tab : saores ] of appendix a.      the magnetic measurements of gamma equ were derived from the zeeman spectra , obtained in the coud focus of the 1-m telescope of sao ras .",
    "the instrumentation and data reduction procedures were described in bychkov ( 2008 ) . in our case , we analysed high - quality spectral data ( @xmath11 , ccd , s / n @xmath12 ) and processed them using the midas software .",
    "the method for obtaining values of the longitudinal magnetic field is standard and includes the following steps :    \\1 .",
    "the selection of lines suitable for measurement was carried out taking into account the physical properties and chemical composition of the star , calculating the synthetic spectrum with the starsp code ( tsymbal 1996 ) using the vald database ( kupka et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "\\2 . in the observed spectral line profiles , corresponding to the left ( lcp ) and",
    "right ( rcp ) circular polarizations , we fitted a gaussian using the method of least squares .",
    "lines with defective registration due to the impact of cosmic rays , etc . were discarded .",
    "the value of line splitting under the effect of the magnetic field was determined by the magnitude of the shift between the centres of the fitted gaussians .",
    "the intensity of the effective magnetic field for each line was computed using the well - known relation ( mathys 1991 ) :    @xmath13    where the wavelength @xmath14 is expressed in  , and the field strength is in g. the value of @xmath0 was computed as the average over all the lines , used for measurements .",
    "assuming that the scatter of @xmath0 values due to inaccurate measurements and other reasons is described by a normal law of distribution , the probable error @xmath15 was computed .",
    "instrumental effects are taken into account according to bychkov et al .",
    "( 2000 ) . during observations , we regularly registered the magnetic standards , @xmath16 cvn and 53 cam , and the standards of the null field @xmath17 cmi , @xmath17 boo , the moon , etc .",
    ", as described in bychkov et al . ( 2006 ) .",
    "results obtained for the standards are in good agreement with the literature data .",
    "the full record of @xmath0 points analysed in this paper includes 372 ccd measurements obtained from zeeman splitting of metal lines , which were collected from published papers .",
    "we list below references to the sources of previous data and the method of observation .",
    "[ fig : method ] shows the distribution of @xmath0 points obtained by different methods in the time period when magnetic measurements were done ( jd ) .    this is a very inhomogeneous set of observations certainly with underestimated errors and possible offsets between various observers .",
    "the data set includes :    * photographic estimates of @xmath0 taken from babcock ( 1958 ) , bonsack & pilachowski ( 1974 ) , scholz ( 1975 ; 1979 ) , zverko et al .",

    "source : wade ( 2015 ) .    method ( 1 ) was used during the longest time period and covers phases of the positive @xmath0 maximum on the magnetic phase curve of @xmath1 equ .",
    "method ( 2 ) required the use of echelle spectrometers to pack many spectral orders on a ccd matrix of relatively small size .",
    "in fact ccd techniques use achromatic analysers of circular polarization that operate in the range @xmath18 (babcock analyzed the interval of only @xmath19  ) .",
    "ccd analyzes higher number of spectral lines .",
    "the identification of lines is more accurate when using vald and model atmospheres .",
    "in fact , this is just a more advanced version of method ( 1 ) .",
    "method ( 3 ) is the most precise method .",
    "however , observations of the longitudinal magnetic field of @xmath1 equ are located in a relatively short time interval ; they do not cover the minimum of the phase curve but are located at the rising part of the curve .",
    "the principal point is that the local @xmath0 extrema were obtained mostly using different methods .",
    "the @xmath0 maximum was observed by the photographic method and the minimum by the ccd method ( and lsd to a lesser extent ) .",
    "differences and possible offsets produced by these methods had an impact on the accuracy in the determination of the period .",
    "note , that all of the @xmath0 estimates of bychkov et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and of this work were obtained at the same telescope and spectrometer and processed with the same software . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : method ] , these estimates cover the minimum at the negative part of the magnetic phase curve .",
    "we appended to our time series 23 unpublished @xmath0 points obtained by the lsd method ( wade 2015 ) .",
    "these observations contributed to our period determination with the same weight as other @xmath0 values .",
    "these measurements were obtained from espadons stokes @xmath20 spectra acquired between september 2004 and july 2010 as part of instrumental commissioning and systematic monitoring of the instrumental crosstalk .",
    "the spectra were reduced using libre - esprit ( donati et al . 1997 ) and lsd profiles were extracted using a line mask corresponding to an appropriate temperature and metallicity .",
    "longitudinal field measurements were extracted from each lsd profile using the first moment method .",
    "additional details concerning the reduction and analysis will be communicated in a forthcoming publication .",
    "the final @xmath0 time series extended for 24488 days ( or over 67 years ) starting from the first measurement of the magnetic field on 9 october 1946 by babcock ( 1958 ) .",
    "that time period amounts to  69 percent of the expected long - term period of @xmath1 equ .    belonging , as it does , to a rather late ap",
    "spectral subclass , this star is a very good object for studying of global magnetic fields since it shows a large number of extremely narrow , sharp metal lines .",
    "the available set of @xmath0 observations consists of 395 measurements obtained from zeeman splitting of metal lines and 51 points measured in hydrogen lines . since values of @xmath0 ( met ) and @xmath0 ( h line ) are markedly different",
    ", we decided to determine periods using only estimates of @xmath0 ( met ) .",
    "moreover , the time interval over which @xmath0 ( h line ) values were observed was 13131 days , which is approximately half the time interval for @xmath0 ( met ) observations , since the latter is equal to 24488 days .",
    "the observed time series is very unevenly filled by estimates .",
    "for clarity , we constructed a histogram which shows the distribution of time intervals between neighbouring measurements .",
    "1 presents such a histogram with a step of 10 days . the horizontal axis in fig . 1",
    "was restricted to intervals not exceeding 350 days , but intervals that are higher than 500 and 1000 days exist , and there is one interval equal to 2614 days .",
    "there exist many different techniques for period determination [ lafler & kinman ( 1965 ) ; jurkevich ( 1971 ) ; deeming ( 1975 ) ; lomb ( 1976 ) ; burki et al .",
    "( 1978 ) ; renson ( 1978 ) ; pelt ( 1975 , 1983 ) ; kurtz ( 1985 ) ; scargle ( 1982 ) terebizh ( 1992 ) and many others ] . those methods were transformed to usable computer codes or software packages [ e.g. kurtz s code ( 1985 ) or the period04 package ( goranskij 1976 ) ] .",
    "one of the most serious problems in our case is that a given interval of the time series data is shorter that the expected period . in the actual @xmath0",
    "set it amounts only to @xmath10 percent of the expected long - term period .",
    "naturally the accuracy of the period determination will be affected by unevenly distributed data points of non - uniform accuracy .",
    "we selected the most commonly used methods and codes for the determination of periods :    * \\1 . the discrete fourier transform ( dft ) for unevenly spaced data by deeming ( 1975 ) ,",
    "see also scargle ( 1982 ) and kurtz ( 1985 ) .",
    "we used here fortran code kindly provided to us by dr . don kurtz . *",
    "\\2 . periodogram analysis ( burnasheva & gollandskij 1989 ) .",
    "this is a modified version of lomb ( 1976 ) and scargle ( 1982 ) .",
    "the least squares method .",
    "determination of the minimum sum of squared deviations from the sine wave yields the best fit .",
    "the sum should be computed for a set of trial periods .",
    "the range of trial periods and the frequency step are selected jointly with parameters of the analysed time series .",
    "the minimum sum indicates the most probable period .",
    "method ( 3 ) was implemented in the form of the fortran code written by bychkov ( 1988 , unpublished ) .",
    "the advantage of this method is that the user explicitly defines the shape of the phase curve which is a very useful option in particular cases .",
    "each of the above most commonly used methods for period determination has some limitations of accuracy , especially when the length of the period exceeds the length of time of the measurement set .",
    "we also used a well - known package period04 in the following tests [ goranskij ( 1976 ) , who implemented methods of deeming ( 1975 ) , lafler and kinman ( 1965 ) and jurkevich ( 1971 ) ] .",
    "as indicated above , the specific case of @xmath1 equ is highly unusual , since the length of the @xmath0 time series equals 70 percent of the expected period .",
    "the simplest and most common form of phase curve is a simple harmonic curve        we performed a very simple numerical experiment .",
    "first , we estimated the preliminary value of the period @xmath23 by fitting a sine wave to the observed @xmath0 points by least - squares ( one degree of freedom ) .",
    "then , for the fixed best period @xmath24 days , we determined the preliminary values of the half - amplitude @xmath25 g , the average @xmath26 g and the initial epoch @xmath27 ( jd ) .",
    "subsequently , we generated a new group of sine @xmath0 time series using the above preliminary estimates of parameters @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and various trial periods @xmath31 .",
    "discrete strengths of the longitudinal magnetic field @xmath0 were determined at the same time points as in the observed time series .",
    "we then added a gaussian noise component with errors @xmath32 in g given in specific source papers .",
    "the trial periods @xmath31 of the simulated @xmath0 time series ranged from 0.5 to 4 @xmath33 @xmath23 .",
    "then , for each @xmath31 we assessed again the period @xmath34 using various methods and the relative difference between them . in the ideal case",
    ", the trial period @xmath31 should be precisely reproduced .    for clarity ,",
