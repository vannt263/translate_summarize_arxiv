    "the field radiative corrections for multi - particle processes has received a lot of attention , in the last few years , also thanks to new computational techniques  @xcite and to new tools  @xcite that are nowadays available .",
    "next to leading order ( nlo ) qcd calculations for hadron colliders physics are needed for two reasons .",
    "firstly , they are an important ingredient for reliably computing backgrounds in new physics searches , that very often rely on analyses performed in rather narrow corners of the phase - space or in tails of distributions , where , on the one hand , not enough statistics is present to extract the background directly from the data and where , on the other hand , radiative corrections are expected to be large . secondly , nlo calculations should be always preferred when measuring and constraining fundamental quantities of the standard model ( sm ) , such as the mass of the higgs particle ( if found ) and its couplings , @xmath0 , @xmath1 or @xmath2 . both in the case of new physics searches , where the new produced particles undergo long decay chains , and in the case of sm measurements , where the hard event is accompanied by a rather strong jet activity , multi - leg final states are expected as a typical signature .    in this contribution ,",
    "i review the main results that have been recently obtained in the subject of nlo qcd calculation for multi - leg final states observables .",
    "in les houches 2007 , theoreticians and experimentalists agreed upon a list of processes interesting to know at the nlo accuracy in qcd  @xcite . in occasion of the following nlo multi - leg les houches workshop  @xcite ,",
    "the job was already almost accomplished , at least at the parton level , mainly due to new breakthrough techniques to compute the one - loop part of the nlo corrections  @xcite .",
    "for reader s reference i present , in table  [ tab : tab1 ] , the original list and the few entries added in 2009 .",
    ".the original 2007 les houches wish list ( top ) and its 2009 update ( bottom ) . [ cols= \" <",
    ", < , < \" , ]     analogous successful comparisons have been performed by the golem group and the team dittmaier , kallweit and uwer on @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "the second , even more important task of the comparisons , is the assessment of the theoretical accuracy at which a given process is known . in this second type of exercise",
    ", each program freely varies a few parameters ( such as renormalization and factorization scales ) .",
    "the goodness of the lo prediction ( at least in the shape of the distributions ) can also be determined that way . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] i report , as an example , the result of a comparison of blackhat , rocket and sherpa on @xmath4 at nlo .    :",
    "@xmath5 and rapidity of the 3rd jet .",
    "[ fig : fig1],title=\"fig : \" ] .",
    "as it can be easily understood , with the advent of the lhc data the techniques used to obtain the nlo results are getting less and less important , since the interest is now going towards commonly accepted interfaces to merge different parts of the nlo calculations . as an example , an accord to interface monte carlo ( mc ) programs , generating the real radiation , together with programs providing the virtual one - loop contributions ( olp ) , can be found in  @xcite ( the so called binoth les - houches accord ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] , i show this accord at work between blackhat / rocket on the olp side and madfks  @xcite on the mc side , in the case of @xmath6 as implemented by frederix , maitre and zanderighi  @xcite .     using the binoth les houches accord . [",
    "fig : fig2],title=\"fig : \" ] .",
    "the binoth les - houches accord is also used by amc@nlo  @xcite to interface virtual and real corrections .",
    "finally , it should be noticed that the field is evolving so rapidly that new nlo processes are continuously computed . as an illustrative example",
    ", i quote @xmath7 in  @xcite , @xmath8 including all off - shell effects in  @xcite and @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "i have presented recent progresses in our theoretical understanding of perturbative qcd at nlo .",
    "new automatic nlo tools exist nowadays to deal with the lhc data and to cope with the complexity of the present and forthcoming measurements .",
    "the further step of automatically interfacing such programs with parton shower and hadronization has already been undertaken .",
