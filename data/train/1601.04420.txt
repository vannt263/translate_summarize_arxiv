    "both eigenspectrum and eigenfunction are exactly determined in terms of finite orthogonal romanovski polynomials .",
    "we also consider the potential application of the model to massless charged fermion , e.g. electronic landau levels in graphene like 2-dimensional systems . in sect.(4 ) , we consider the modified energy dispersion relation ( mdr ) and apply it to neutrinos oscillation . by removing the universality of the deformed parameter ( flavour dependence ) ,",

    "next , we have examined the modified energy dispersion relation induced by the anti - snyder model .",
    "the group velocity of photon is found to be time - dependent and superluminal .",
    "we interpret this as varying speed of light phenomena .",
    "subsequently , by applying the modified dispersion relation to neutrinos oscillation , we have obtained the modified oscillating phase and compared it to the snyder model . in snyder model , the oscillating phase is exponentially suppressed . however , in anti - snyder model the modification is only possible if the deformed parameter is not universal and is flavour dependent .",
    "interestingly , this non - universality allows us to consider the neutrino oscillation for massless and mass - degenerate neutrinos .",
    "finally , by comparing with particle data , we have obtained a more stringent bound on the deformed parameter , @xmath215 for solar neutrinos and @xmath216 for atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "ching thanks rajesh parwani and kuldip singh for encouragement .",
    "all classical orthogonal polynomials appear as solutions of hypergeometric equation as shown below : @xmath217 where the coefficients are @xmath218 there are various methods to find the solution @xcite and typically denoted by @xmath219 in which @xmath220 have been made explicit as the equation parameters of the polynomial of degree @xmath221 , and @xmath222 is the eigenvalue parameter . from nikiforov and uvarov",
    "method @xcite , the polynomials @xmath223 can be built from rodrigues representation and are classified according to their weight functions @xmath224 as following : @xmath225\\\\ w(x ) & = & \\mathcal{w}\\left(\\begin{matrix }   d &   & e \\\\   a & b & c   \\end{matrix}\\middle|x\\right ) = \\exp\\left(\\int dx \\frac{(d-2a)x + ( e - b)}{ax^2 + bx + c}\\right).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by choosing appropriate parameters , one can obtain orthogonal solutions : jacobi ( include special cases likes legendre , gegenbauer and chebychev ) , laguerre , hermite polynomials and non - orthogonal solution : bessel polynomials which are familiar in mathematical physics literature",
    ". however , there is another class of solution which is less well known as  finite romanovski polynomials \" denoted by @xmath226 .",
    "the corresponding set of parameters are @xmath227 and @xmath228 where @xmath229 .",
    "thus , the differential equation satisfied by the romanovski polynomials is given by @xmath230 r^{(p , q)}_n(x ) = 0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] such a set of parameters results in the following weight function @xmath231 that belongs to this class of polynomial , @xmath232 and with non - trivial orthogonality condition @xmath233 if and only if @xmath234 .",
