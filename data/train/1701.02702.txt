    "the dynamics of polymer chains in a melt is a complicated many - body problem where the motion of chains depends not only on different length scales but also time scales .",
    "it is well known that for short unentangled chains in a melt , excluded volume and hydrodynamic interactions are screened , and the viscoelastic properties of chains can be approximately described by the rouse model  @xcite . if the polymer chains become long enough , the topological constraints dominate the dynamics of the chains . at intermediate time and",
    "length scales , the chains are assumed to move back and forth ( reptation ) within a tube - like region created by surrounding entangled chains and depending on the entanglement length @xmath3 .",
    "the dynamic behavior within this time frame is well described by the reptation theory of de gennes , doi and edwards  @xcite .",
    "rouse mode analysis provides a straightforward way of understanding the dynamics of single chains in a melt by mapping the trajectories of the chains into orthogonal rouse modes .",
    "the chains are assumed to be gaussian in this analysis .",
    "this has been applied widely to the analysis of experimental data and simulation data .",
    "besides the original predictions of this model , in the literature  @xcite there also exist modified theoretical predictions including the excluded volume interaction , the intrinsic stiffness of chains , the intramolecular correlations in chains , and the topological constraints for analyzing the relaxation of rouse modes .",
    "in our recent work  @xcite , we have investigated the chain conformations of fully equilibrated and highly entangled polymer melts and compared our simulation results to the related theoretical predictions in detail .",
    "the fully equilibrated and highly entangled polymer melts were generated by a novel and very efficient methodology through a sequential backmapping of soft - sphere coarse - grained configurations from low resolution to high resolution , and finally the application of molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations of the underlying bead - spring model  @xcite .",
    "we have also studied the dynamics of fully equilibrated polymer melts , characterized by the mean square displacement of monomers , and determined the characteristic time scales : the characteristic time @xmath7 , the entanglement time @xmath8 , the rouse time @xmath9 , and the disentanglement time @xmath10 , according to the predictions given by the rouse model and the reptation theory , where @xmath3 is the entanglement length and @xmath1 is the chain size . for @xmath11 in the rouse regime ,",
    "there exist exact solutions of almost all physical observables .",
    "therefore , based on this work , we are interested in understanding to what extent the dynamics of single chains can be analyzed through the rouse mode analysis and check the scaling predictions of the relaxation of the rouse modes in the literature  @xcite whenever it is possible .",
    "on the other hand , rouse mode decay should display a similar slowing down of the dynamic structure factor .",
    "the tube diameter introduced in the reptation theory can be extracted from the single chain dynamic structure factor measured via neutron spin echo ( nse ) experiments  @xcite .",
    "therefore we also study the dynamic scattering function from single chains in a melt , and check the consistency of the tube diameter estimated from different physical quantities  @xcite .",
