    "most nuclear rings ( also known as circumnuclear rings in the literature ) are thought to be produced as a result of an inflow of gaseous material that has been driven to the central parts of a galaxy after the loss of angular momentum ( combes & gerin 1985 ) , which may be driven by non - axisymmetric features such as bars , ovals or strong spiral arms ( see e.g.  shlosman et al .",
    "1990 ; athanassoula 1994 ; combes 2001 ) .",
    "they are generally assumed to be related to the inner lindblad resonances ( ilrs ) in a barred potential ( simkin et al .",
    "1980 ; combes & gerin 1985 ) . nuclear rings",
    "are thus tracers of recent gas inflow to the circumnuclear region ( knapen et al .",
    "since they have star formation rates of up to 5%  of the total star formation in the galaxy ( kennicutt et al .",
    "2005 ) , they are part of a secular process that may help to build up pseudo - bulges ( kormendy & kennicutt 2004 ) .",
    "star - forming nuclear rings are statistically related to @xmath8-drops ( circumnuclear drops in the stellar velocity dispersion with a typical scalelength of one kpc ) which are tracers of young circumnuclear populations and thus are another key piece in the study of secular evolution ( comern et al .",
    "2008b ) . as nuclear rings",
    "are relatively small they are one of the galactic morphological features that is most likely to be related to nuclear activity . in fact , evidence for such a link has been presented by knapen ( 2005 ) and knapen et al .",
    "nuclear rings have been related to nuclear bars because for both features , in many cases , their size is limited by the outer ilr ( laine et al .",
    "2002 ; englmaier & shlosman 2004 ) .",
    "some new bars have been discovered recently , thanks to observations in new spectral ranges , notably the near - infrared ( see e.g.  scoville et al .",
    "1988 ; thronson et al .  1989 ; eskridge et al .",
    "2000 ; knapen et al .",
    "2000 ) and the millimetre domain ( e.g.  in the study of ngc  6946 performed by ball et al .  1985 ) , but the bar fraction estimate has not significantly increased .",
    "the canonical estimate of the fraction of bars is around two - thirds ( mulchaey & regan 1997 ; menndez - delmestre et al .  2007 ; marinova & jogee 2007 ) among luminous , normal galaxies .",
    "fourier analysis techniques applied to bar detection have confirmed these results ( laurikainen et al .",
    "2004 ) . whether the bar distribution shows some variation with hubble morphological type is still an uncertain issue",
    "; some authors show that the bar distribution is nearly constant with the morphological type ( eskridge et al .",
    "2000 ; marinova & jogee 2007 ) , other authors have shown that lenticular galaxies are less likely to be barred than spiral galaxies ( knapen et al .",
    "2000 ; aguerri et al .",
    "2009 ; laurikainen et al .",
    "it is , however , certain that bars , even if they are common , are not found in every spiral galaxy .",
    "unbarred galaxies can host oval distortions which are deviations of the disc from a perfect axisymmetric shape .",
    "ovals have lower ellipticities than bars and generally do not have fourier terms with order higher than @xmath9 ( laurikainen et al .",
    "their dynamical effects are very similar to those produced by bars ( kormendy & kennicutt 2004 ) .    detailed knowledge of whether a galaxy hosts a bar or not is necessary to explore the links between non - axisymmetric features and circumnuclear star - forming activity . the central regions of galaxies can maintain strong star - forming nuclear rings or ultra - compact nuclear rings ( ucnrs ) , the latter defined by comern et al .",
    "( 2008a ) as circumnuclear rings with a radius smaller than 200pc .",
    "most nuclear rings have enhanced star formation rates , making them plausible tracers of recent inflow of material ( knapen et al .",
    "2006 ) .    in barred galaxies",
    "the gas is driven inward along shocks that may be delineated by dust lanes ( roberts et al .",
    "1979 ; athanassoula 1992 ; shlosman 1999 ; shlosman 2001 ) .",
    "when the shocked gas crosses an ilr , the trajectory is gradually shifted from ( nearly ) radial to ( nearly ) circular ( knapen et al .  1995 ; shlosman 2001 ) .",
    "this shock - focused azimuthal flow creates a molecular nuclear ring between the two ilrs ( when two ilrs are found ) or just inside a single ilr ( shlosman 1999 ; prez - ramrez et al .",
    "the molecular gas may at some point become dense enough to initiate star formation .",
    "however , at exactly which radius ( relative to the ilrs ) a nuclear ring may appear is a subject that is still under discussion ( see e.g.  the introduction of van de ven & chang 2009 ) .",
    "some small nuclear rings could also be related to resonances that are even closer to the nucleus such as nuclear lindblad resonances ( see e.g.  fukuda et al .  1998 ;",
    "shlosman 1999 ; maciejewski 2003 ) .",
    "even though nuclear rings have often been related to non - axisymmetric features and ilrs , a few have been found in galaxies with no known non - axisymmetric features .",
    "this is the case for ngc  473 ( heckman 1978 ) , ngc  2985 ( comern et al .",
    "2008a ) , ngc  3011 ( gil de paz et al .  2003 ) , ngc  4826 ( pogge 1989 ) , ngc  7217 ( pease 1917 ) , and ngc  7742 ( morgan 1958 ) .",
    "another phenomenon that may be called a nuclear ring is the presence of hundred pc - scale dust rings in elliptical and early lenticular galaxies ( see e.g.  lauer et al .",
    "these features have the size of nuclear rings but they show little or no star formation .",
    "rings in elliptical galaxies may be caused by the depletion from inside out of dust nuclear discs ( lauer et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "the aim of this paper is to present the most complete atlas of nuclear rings up to now and to study their links with other galactic features , notably bars .",
    "samples of nuclear rings have already been published ( srsic & pastoriza 1965 ; pogge 1989 ; buta & crocker 1993 ; knapen et al .",
    "2002 ; knapen 2005 ) but _ hubble space telescope _ ( @xmath10 ) has provided much better resolution imaging that allows us to study the intermediate and small - sized nuclear rings . since the launch of @xmath10 , tens of nuclear rings have been discovered but they have been studied individually or in small groups and no attempt has yet been made to make a uniform study of all of them .",

    "we discuss our results in sect .",
    "12 and present a summary of our conclusions in sect .  13 .",
    "appendix  a contains tables with data about galaxy properties , and bar and nuclear ring and bar parameters .",
    "appendix  b contains images of all the ainur nuclear rings .",
    "we define a star - forming nuclear ring as a ring of intense star formation in the proximity of the nucleus of a galaxy ( see , e.  g. , buta et al .  2007 ) .",
    "we will assume that nuclear rings lie in the galaxy plane .",
    "an inside - out surface brightness profile of them shows a rise and a fall in surface brightness with a maximum that we use to define the ring radius .",
    "we set the criterion that the width of a ring has to be at most half the ring radius ; if not the nuclear ring is called a nuclear disc .",
    "these rings are usually located between the two ilrs where they exist and , if not , they are found just inside a single ilr ( knapen et al .",
    "1995 ; shlosman 1999 ) . nuclear rings are usually found inside the bar of a galaxy , but several nuclear rings are found in non - barred galaxies and may be related to ilrs due to strong spiral patterns , weak ovals or disturbances due to a companion galaxy .",
    "we will also include into this category purely stellar rings that once contained star formation and which have since faded .    in this paper",
    "we also include nuclear rings that are made of dust but have the size of star - forming nuclear rings .",
    "these dust nuclear rings are found in elliptical and early s0 galaxies .",
    "these features must not be confused with heavily dust - obscured star - forming rings which may need infrared imaging to directly see the star formation .",
    "the distinction between dust and star - forming nuclear rings is thus in their origin , not in their aspect .",
    "ngc  2787 ( silchenko & afanasiev 2004 ) is a galaxy with a polar disc whose two nuclear rings do not lie in the main plane of the galaxy . as in the case of dust nuclear rings ,",
    "the rings of this galaxy have been included in ainur for completness ( they have the size of ucnrs ) but are not plotted nor used for statistics in which ` normal ' star - forming nuclear rings are involved .",
    "nuclear rings are in most cases easily distinguished from inner rings . in barred galaxies ,",
    "inner rings are related to the inner 4:1 ultraharmonic resonance , found slightly inside the corotation radius of the bar ( schwarz 1984 ) .",
    "thus inner rings usually encircle main galactic bars ( this is why they were called @xmath12-type spirals by curtis in 1918 ) and nuclear rings are found well inside the bar ( they may be encircling nuclear bars ) . when there is no obvious bar , distinguishing between nuclear and inner rings may be impossible if a galaxy does not have both a nuclear and inner ring .",
    "the difference between pseudo - rings and rings is much fuzzier . according to buta & crocker ( 1993 )",
    "a pseudo - ring is a ring which is not well defined and probably represents a variation of the same phenomenon .",
    "a pseudo - ring may be seen as an intermediate state between a nuclear spiral and a well - defined nuclear ring . for practical purposes and due to the difficulty of quantifying how ` ringy ' a feature is , we are going to consider as a limiting case the nuclear ring in ngc  4321 .",
    "we do not include pseudo - rings in this paper , but the distinction between the two types of features is not watertight and some of our nuclear rings may still be considered by some to have pseudo - ring characteristics .",
    "previous catalogues of rings ( not only nuclear , but also inner and outer ) such as those by buta & crocker ( 1993 ) and buta ( 1995 ) include pseudo - rings .",
    "thus , direct comparative statistics between these catalogues and ainur may not be valid .",
    "the nuclear rings in ainur were detected by visual inspection of digital images ( continuous @xmath13-band , @xmath14-band and uv images , continuum - subtracted and line emission images , colour - index maps and structure maps ) .",
    "prior to hst , the typical nuclear ring identified on ground - based images had an average radius of about 750pc ( buta & crocker 1993 ; adjusted for current distance scale ) .",
    "extensive hst imaging has revealed a significant population of much smaller rings , 200pc or less in radius , called ultra - compact by comern et al . 2008a .",
    "it is not yet known whether ucnrs are the lower diameter tail of the nuclear ring size distribution or if they have a distinct origin . as one of the aims of this paper",
    "is to solve this problem we do not set a lower limit to the size of our rings .",
    "the maximum radius of nuclear rings is uncertain .",
    "laine et al .  ( 2002 ) relate the size distribution of nuclear rings to that of nuclear bars whose maximum radius is claimed by the authors to be around 1.6kpc .",
    "there are , nevertheless , some exceptionally big rings that have been defined as nuclear , as in eso  565 - 11 ( for a complete analysis of this galaxy see buta et al .",
    "the innermost ring of this galaxy , whose radius is around 3.5kpc , is a _ bona fide _ nuclear ring because the galaxy has two more ring features that can be unambiguously identified as an inner ring and an outer pseudo - ring .",
    "in addition , the nuclear ring is inside the bar of the galaxy and can not be an @xmath15 ring ( a ring of gas at the largest non - looping orbit whose major axis is parallel to the major axis of the bar as defined by regan & teuben 2004 ) because it is not aligned with the bar .",
    "we decided to include in ainur those nuclear rings with radii above 2.0kpc that were found inside a bar ( eso  565 - 11 ) or in unbarred galaxies that had outer , inner , and nuclear rings ( eso  198 - 13 ) .",
    "if these criteria were not satisfied , we concluded that any ring feature with a radius above 2.0kpc could not be classified unambiguously and we thus did not include it in our sample .",
    "we have found three rings in the latter category , with radii between 2 and 3kpc in the unbarred galaxies ngc  3626 , ngc  4750 , and ngc  7213 .",
    "these rings were not included in ainur .",
    "ainur includes 113 nuclear rings distributed in 107 galaxies .",
    "the parameters of the host galaxies are found in table  [ galax1 ] and the parameters of the nuclear rings and the host galaxy bar ( if present ) are found in table  [ galax2 ] .",
    "images of all the nuclear rings are presented in appendix  b.      our galaxy sample has been based on the survey by ho et al .",
    "( 1995 ) aimed at ` dwarf ' seyfert nuclei in nearby galaxies .",
    "they selected all those galaxies from the revised shapley - ames catalogue of bright galaxies ( rsa ; sandage & tammann 1981 ) and the second reference catalogue of bright galaxies ( rc2 ; de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "1976 ) with @xmath16mag and @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath18 is the apparent total @xmath14 magnitude reduced to the rc3 system ( de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "twelve additional objects of special or historical interest were added to the sample by ho et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , reaching a total of 503 galaxies . to the 503 galaxies in this sample we added a similar selection from the southern celestial hemisphere : we selected all those galaxies with @xmath19 and @xmath16mag in the third reference catalogue of bright galaxies ( rc3 ; de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "we took into account the fact that some of the galaxies in rc3 just have a @xmath20 measurement , and we corrected this effect by calculating the @xmath18 magnitude as @xmath21 in the cases where @xmath22 is provided by rc3 .",
    "the rc3 contains galaxies brighter that 15.5mag which implies that we have no problems with completeness in the southern hemisphere .",
    "our combined sample consists of 888 galaxies with @xmath16mag in both northern and southern hemispheres .",
    "as we were looking for nuclear rings that are assumed to lie in the galactic plane , we excluded from the list of 888 galaxies all those that were classified as edge - on in the rc3 catalogue ( galaxies with a slash , ` /',in the morphological type as reported by the rc3 catalogue ) .",
    "we also removed from our selection all the galaxies with an axis ratio smaller than 0.35 ( @xmath23 ) in hyperleda ( paturel et al .",
    "2003 ) because we considered that they are too highly inclined to give reliable results .",
    "we removed a total of 157 very inclined galaxies from the sample .",
    "next we retrieved those advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) , faint object camera ( foc ) , near - infrared camera and multi - object spectrometer ( nicmos ) , and wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) images from the @xmath10 archive which included the nuclear zones of our non edge - on galaxy sample .",
    "all the 248 galaxies that have not been observed by @xmath10 were removed from the sample at this stage because the resolution reached by ground - based telescopes would not allow us to detect ucnrs at the distances of most of the galaxies .",
    "we also removed all the satellite galaxies of the milky way because these dwarf irregular galaxies , though very well studied , are known not to have rings .",
