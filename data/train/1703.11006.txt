    "the electro - optic modulator @xcite is one of the most important components in silicon photonics , and cmos - compatible , micrometer - scale devices based on a modulated cavity resonance have been a central focus of research @xcite . typically in these systems , a local refractive index change of the silicon results in a change of the transmission through the cavity",
    "this is intuitively understood in the adiabatic limit , in which the modulation happens on a time - scale that is much slower than the one given by the photon life - time , but the phenomenology is in general much richer @xcite . here , we solve exactly the steady - state dynamics of a cavity with a peridocially - modulated resonance frequency .",
    "we provide a quantitative definition of the adiabatic regime , and find highly non - intuitive effects outside of it .",
    "the applications include transmission switching , lossless frequency conversion , and signal manipulation , and are thus relevant to the broad field of photonic communication .",
    "furthermore , systems of periodically - modulated , _ coupled _ resonator modes have recently been shown to break reciprocity , which can be used for non - magnetic photonic isolation @xcite , and even for photonic topological insulators @xcite .",
    "the approach we take in this work opens up a perspective to study these systems analytically , beyond the commonly employed approximations .",
    "we study two optical cavity configurations relevant to chip - scale technologies ( fig . [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the first one is a cavity coupled to two input / output ports , schematically represented as a distributed bragg reflector ( dbr ) cavity in fig . [ fig1](a ) . following refs .",
    "@xcite , the coupled - mode ( cm ) equations for this system read @xmath0 with @xmath1 representing the electromagnetic energy inside the resonator , while @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the input and output amplitudes in the @xmath4-th port , respectively . @xmath5 and @xmath6 correspond to input and output power .",
    "the resonance has a decay rate of @xmath7 .",
    "here we assume that the resonance decays entirely through the coupling to the ports , and moreover the decay rates to the two ports are equal .",
    "the resonance frequency in the absence of modulation is @xmath8 , and @xmath9 is the time - dependent modulation .",
    "the second configuration involves a single in / out port and is relevant for example to the case of a micro - ring resonator side - coupled to a waveguide ( fig . [ fig1](b ) ) .",

    "( [ eqn : starting1]-[eqn : starting2 ] ) describing panel ( a ) are also relevant to a micro - ring resonator coupled to _ two _ waveguides , one on each side .",
    "the crucial difference between the two systems in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] is the fact that in the one of panel ( b ) , the time - integrated transmitted power is always equal to the input power , since there is only one output port and energy conservation holds . in contrast , in panel ( a ) , the power can be arbitrarily split between the transmission channel ( @xmath11 ) and the reflection channel ( @xmath12 ) .",

    "next , we make an ansatz for the steady - state solution of the system , namely we look for a solution @xmath23-periodic in time , such that @xmath24 with @xmath25 constants that do not depend on time .",

    "the transmittivity spectrum has a component at every side - band , and the amplitude at the side - band with frequency @xmath34 consists of the sum of resonant contributions at @xmath35 , with appropriate weights .",
    "the normalized transmitted power is also @xmath23-periodic , and can be computed as @xmath36 for the micro - ring case of eqs .",

    "the theory presented so far is exact for all possible parameters of the modulation . to illustrate the results better ,",

    "we start our discussion with the most intuitive , adiabatic regime .",
    "we focus on the dbr cavity of fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) , but the same line of argument can be followed for the micro - ring case , and in fact for any modulated cavity with an arbitrary time - dependence of the resonance frequency .",
    "when the dynamic modulation is sufficiently slow , we expect that the time - dependence of all physical quantities can be computed using an effective static frequency defined by @xmath9 at every given @xmath43 .",
    "more precisely , for example for the steady - state transmission we expect to write @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the transmission of a static cavity at a resonance frequency @xmath46 .",
    "most numerical designs of resonant modulators implicitly assume this approximation @xcite . under what condition",
    "should the system be in this regime , however , has not been previously discussed rigorously .",
    "here , we derive self - consistently a condition that quantifies the range of parameters for which the system can be in this adiabatic regime .",
    "the following ansatz , @xmath47 can only be a steady - state solution to eq .",

    "( [ eqn : ad_cos ] ) is largest for @xmath52 , @xmath53 , while the rhs is smallest at those same times , and for @xmath54 .",
    "thus , for the evolution to be adiabatic at all times throughout the cycle and for all input frequencies , we finally obtain the condition @xmath55 , or , in the units we use in this paper , @xmath56 it is important to note that the adiabatic limit is not simply defined by a small @xmath57 , but by an interplay of all three parameters @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath7 .",
    "the adiabatic regime is illustrated in fig .",

    "the resonant frequency @xmath9 oscillates within the blue shaded region of panel ( a ) . note that , for these parameters , the condition of eq .",

    "( [ eqn : s_n ] ) , one can show that @xmath66 thus , for all @xmath22 we have @xmath67 .",
    "in this adiabatic limit and under the cosine modulation , we can further show through the fourier transform of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : ad_alpha ] ) that @xmath68 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : adiabatic](c)-(f ) , this is manifested in the fact that the plots are symmetric with respect to @xmath54 , but this is not the case outside the adiabatic limit , as we will show below .",
    "an interesting aspect of fig .",
    "2(c)-(f ) is that the transmission shows a flat - top rather than a lorentzian - like lineshape .",
    "this flat - top transmission is characteristic of the ` intermediate ' adiabatic regime , when @xmath69 .",
    "this is in contrast to the strongly - adiabatic regime with @xmath70 , when the modulation can practically be neglected , and @xmath61 becomes equivalent to the static transmission exhibiting a lorentzian lineshape .",

    "( [ eqn : ad_cond ] ) , the bessel functions @xmath72 have approximately comparable values for all @xmath73 .",
    "thus , @xmath74 for example is given by the superposition of broad peaks ( @xmath75 ) centered at every @xmath76 , with similar weights @xmath77 , resulting in the flat - top spectral feature .      when the adiabatic condition is not met , the transmission has a highly non - trivial time - dependence , as described by eq .",
    "( [ eqn : s_n ] ) .",
    "this expression is most easily understood in the limit of a large modulation frequency @xmath57 , or , more precisely , @xmath78 , when the light stays in the resonator much longer than one modulation cycle . in this case , the terms in the summation of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : s_n ] ) all become small if @xmath79 for every @xmath80 , while , for @xmath81 we have @xmath82 with this approximation , and using the identity @xmath83 , we find that only the zero - th component of the transmission is non - zero , or , more precisely , @xmath84 in other words , the transmission is time - independent in this limit , as can be intuitively expected when very fast oscillations are averaged out . furthermore , when the input frequency is close to @xmath85 for a given integer @xmath80 , there is a resonance feature in the transmission spectrum with the same lorentzian lineshape as the resonance of the static cavity , but with a magnitude scaled by @xmath86 .",
    "this result is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : highom ] , which shows the same plots as fig .",
    "[ fig : adiabatic ] , but for a dbr cavity with @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "we see that the transmission of the modulated cavity in panel ( c ) is precisely given by a collection of lorentizan peaks centered at every @xmath31 .",
    "each of these peaks has the same shape as the static transmission of panel ( a ) , with height scaled by @xmath89 . as expected from eq .",
    "( [ eqn : trans_highom ] ) , the time - dependence shown in panel ( b ) for @xmath54 is very close to constant .    interestingly , even though the transmission in this regime is time - independent , the output amplitude is _ not _ monochromatic at @xmath90 .",
    "instead , it contains components at all frequencies @xmath91 , with the bessel function scaling of eq .",

    "the main component in the output is the one at @xmath94 .",
    "however , when @xmath95 , the largest component is @xmath96 , i.e. the strongest output is at the cavity frequency @xmath8 and not at the input frequency @xmath90 .",
    "this shows that there is strong frequency conversion in the transmission signal due to the modulation in this high - frequency regime .",
    "the theoretical results presented thus far suggest a rich phenomenology of the modulated - cavity system . in this section ,",
    "we illustrate several aspects that are potentially relevant for applications in photonic technologies .      in the high - frequency regime , one striking consequence of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : trans_highom ] ) is that the transmission at @xmath81 goes to zero if @xmath97 is a root of the @xmath80-th bessel function .",
    "this suggests the possibility for a non - conventional switch , in which the transmission through the cavity can be tuned between zero and one through adjusting the amplitude of a _ time - periodic _ modulation . to verify this , and more generally that the cm results presented thus far are relevant to physical implementations",
    ", we also perform a first - principle maxwell - equations simulation using a recently - developed multi - frequency finite - difference frequency - domain ( mf - fdfd ) method that can incorporate a time - periodic refractive index modulation @xcite .",
    "specifically , we simulate a physical dbr , schematically shown in fig . [",
    "fig : switch](a ) : the cavity is composed of a central region of width @xmath98 m , with sixteen material layers of thickness @xmath99 m on each side . the relative permittivity alternates between @xmath100 ( black ) and @xmath101 ( grey ) .",
    "the cavity supports a resonant mode at frequency @xmath102thz , and we include a modulation of the permittivity of the central layer , @xmath103 , with frequency @xmath104ghz and @xmath105 .",

    ", the electric field has a component at every side - band to the source frequency @xmath90 , and can be written as @xmath107 to compare this simulation to cm theory , we first extrapolate the coupling constant @xmath7 by fitting the transmission of the un - modulated cavity ( inset of panel ( c ) ) as a function of input frequency . in that case , @xmath7 is simply the half - width at half - maximum of the lorentzian peak , and is found to be @xmath108 .",
    "next , we determine the dependence of the resonance frequency of the cavity on the permittivity @xmath109 of the central region , by simulating the un - modulated structure with a slightly higher @xmath110 .",
    "we find that , for @xmath111 , the resonant frequency changes by @xmath112 .",
    "this defines the relationship between permittivity change and resonant frequency change , and consequently between @xmath113 in the mf - fdfd and the @xmath58 value of cm - theory .",
    "the choice of @xmath114 corresponds to @xmath115 , which is a root of @xmath116 .    using these parameters , in panel ( b )",
    "we show the cm - computed transmission including the modulation .",

    "( c ) , we plot the electric field components at the monitor position computed using the mf - fdfd .",

    "the inset to panel ( c ) shows the transmission through the un - modulated cavity , which goes to unity at @xmath54 .",
    "therefore , for a sufficiently narrow - band signal near zero detuning , the dynamic modulation switches the system from complete transmission to complete reflection .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : switch](d)-(e ) , we illustrate the dynamics of the switching , by turning on and then off the cavity resonant frequency modulation .",
    "the computation was carried out by numerically solving eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : starting1]-[eqn : starting2 ] ) using a runge - kutta method . at time zero , the cavity is empty ( @xmath119 ) and not modulated .",
    "the steady - state of unity transmission is reached after a time that is a few @xmath26 . at time @xmath120 , the dynamic modulation with @xmath115 is turned on , and the system evolves into a steady - state of near - zero transmission . at time @xmath121 , the modulation is switched off , and the system returns to unity transmission .",
    "it is worth emphasizing how strikingly different this regime is from the adiabatic one : throughout the modulation , the transmission is close to zero even at times at which the input is resonant with the cavity mode , and the transmission of the system at such time would be unity in the adiabatic regime .      next , we illustrate the possibility for complete , lossless frequency conversion in the micro - ring system .",
    "this is not possible in the dbr case , where we have @xmath122 in the whole parameter range .",
    "however , in the ring case , because of the interference between the direct and the indirect pathways  see eq .",

    "furthermore , the frequency range for near - complete frequency conversion can be made arbitrarily large as long as the cm equations ( [ eqn : mr1]-[eqn : mr2 ] ) are a valid description of the system .",
    "finally , we also note that the system of panel ( b ) is in the adiabatic regime , which shows that non - trivial results like complete frequency conversion exist even in the adiabatic limit .",

    "<S> we provide an analytic solution to the coupled - mode equations describing the steady - state of a single periodically - modulated optical resonator driven by a monochromatic input . </S>",
    "<S> the phenomenology of this system was qualitatively understood only in the adiabatic limit , i.e. for low modulation speed . however , both in and out of this regime , we find highly non - trivial effects for specific parameters of the modulation . </S>",
    "<S> for example , we show complete suppression of the transmission even with zero detuning between the input and the static resonator frequency . </S>",
    "<S> we also demonstrate the possibility for complete , lossless frequency conversion of the input into the side - band frequencies , as well as for optimizing the transmitted signal towards a given target temporal waveform . </S>",
    "<S> the analytic results are validated by first - principle simulations . </S>"
