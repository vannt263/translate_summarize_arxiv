    "radio relics are synchrotron emissions often found on the periphery of clusters of galaxies . from their positions and prolonged shapes , they have been associated with cosmic ray ( cr ) electrons accelerated at shocks in the intracluster medium ( icm ) . in fact , shocks have been discovered at some relics by x - ray observations @xcite .",
    "it has often been believed that the cr electrons are accelerated at the shocks through the diffusive shock acceleration ( dsa ) mechanism , which is first - order fermi acceleration ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , recent observations have shown that the acceleration is much more complicated than expected .",
    "for example , the radio spectrum of the relic in the galaxy cluster 1rxs j0603.3 @xmath04214 ( `` toothbrush '' cluster ) is hard and curved , which contradicts predictions based on a simple dsa model @xcite .",
    "moreover , xmm - newton observations showed that the position of the shock does not coincide with that of the relic @xcite , although the shock - relic offset was not recognized in deeper chandra observations @xcite .    in @xcite",
    ", we showed that the discrepancies are solved if electrons are reaccelerated in turbulence _",
    "downstream _ of the shock . in this model ,",
    "the electrons are first accelerated at a shock through the dsa , although the efficiency does not have to be high .",
    "then , the seed cr electrons are efficiently reaccelerated in the turbulence through second - order fermi acceleration .",
    "turbulent reacceleration has been studied to explain the origin of giant radio halos observed in clusters ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite showed that it can also be applied to radio relics .",
    "turbulent ( re)acceleration behind shocks has been considered for objects such as supernova remnants ( e.g. @xcite ) and the fermi bubbles ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "while the relic in the toothbrush cluster has a complicated shape and the mach number of the associated shock is small ( @xmath1 ; @xcite ) , the northern relic in the cluster ciza  j2242.8@xmath05301 ( the `` sausage '' cluster ; @xmath2 ) has a clear bow - like shape @xcite and the mach number is relatively large ( @xmath3 ; @xcite ) .",
    "this may indicate that the dsa model is preferable .",
    "however , even this `` textbook '' example of a relic has a hard , curved radio spectrum , which is not easy to reconcile with dsa models @xcite .",
    "we note that there are modified dsa models in which fossil electrons upstream of the shock are reaccelerated at the shock through dsa ( e.g. @xcite ) or magnetic fields vary @xcite .",
    "these could result in a curved radio spectrum .",
    "in addition , the impact of the sunyaev - zeldovich effect on the radio spectrum could not be ignored @xcite . however , in this study , we attempt to apply our reacceleration model to the relic in the sausage cluster in order to solve the contradictions .",
    "we do not go into the details of the micro - physics of turbulent reacceleration ( e.g. , the cascade of turbulence , plasma instabilities , and so on ) , which are highly unknown at present .",
    "instead , we focus on finding out the parameters that are consistent with observations . the results will be helpful when more comprehensive models are constructed in the future .",
    "in the model of @xcite , electrons are first accelerated at a shock through dsa .",
    "the momentum spectrum of the accelerated electrons is @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the electron momentum and @xmath6 is the normalization .",
    "the index is given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the compression ratio : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the adiabatic index , and @xmath11 is the mach number of the shock ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the downstream density @xmath12 and the velocity @xmath13 are related to the upstream density @xmath14 and the velocity @xmath15 as @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "we assume that the minimum momentum of the accelerated electrons is @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the electron mass , and @xmath20 is the light velocity .",
    "the normalization @xmath6 in equation  ( [ eq : dsa ] ) is given as follows .",
    "the kinetic energy flux upstream of the shock is @xmath21 .",
    "we assume that a fraction @xmath22 of the flux is consumed to accelerate electrons .",
    "this means that the kinetic energy density of the accelerated cr electrons just downside of the shock is @xmath23 . on the other hand ,",
    "the density is also written as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the lorentz factor of a cr electron . from these equations ,",
    "we obtain @xmath26    we assume that turbulence develops downstream of the shock .",
    "the cr electrons accelerated at the shock are swept downstream with the icm and they are reaccelerated in the turbulence .",
    "the evolution of the momentum spectrum @xmath27 on the comoving frame is calculated using the fokker - plank equation , @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the diffusion coefficient for momentum .",
    "the initial spectrum is given by @xmath30 .",
    "since the cr electrons move with the icm , the distance of the electrons from the shock is written as @xmath31 .",
    "we assume that the electrons are scattered by alfvn waves because they can develop even on small scales through the cascade of turbulence and/or plasma instabilities ( see section  2.2.2 of @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the diffusion coefficient for momentum is @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the alfvn velocity , and @xmath34 is the spatial diffusion coefficient , @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the mean free path of the electrons ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "the alfvn velocity is written as @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the downstream magnetic field .",
    "when particles are scattered by magnetosonic waves , @xmath36 may be comparable to the coulomb mean free path of thermal particles @xmath39 ( e.g. @xcite ; see also @xcite )",
    ". however , when they are scattered by alfvn waves , @xmath36 may be much smaller than @xmath40 .",
    "thus , we assume that @xmath36 has the form of @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the reduction factor , @xmath43 is the reference momentum , and @xmath44 is the parameter representing the property of the turbulence .",
    "the coulomb mean free path @xmath40 depends on the downstream density @xmath12 and temperature @xmath45 .",
    "following @xcite , we set @xmath46 and @xmath47 ( kolmogorov case ) .",
    "it is to be noted that even if we adopt @xmath48 ( hard sphere approximation ) , the results do not change qualitatively .",
    "we expect that the turbulence and the alfvn waves decay with the distance from the shock and we include that effect in @xmath42 .",
    "assuming that the decay scale in space is @xmath49 , its time scale is @xmath50 .",
    "thus , the reduction factor is represented by @xmath51 this means that the mean free path increases as cr electrons move away from the shock with the icm . in equation  ( [ eq : evo ] ) , @xmath52 represents cooling of the cr electrons .",
    "we include synchrotron , inverse compton scattering of cosmic microwave background photons , non - thermal bremsstrahlung , and coulomb interaction @xcite .",
    "the synchrotron emission depends on @xmath38 .",
    "x - ray observations have shown that the shock parameters for the northern relic in the sausage cluster are @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56  kev @xcite .",
    "the coulomb mean free path downstream of the shock is @xmath57  kpc . since the spatial scale of turbulence should be much smaller than the width of the relic ( @xmath58  kpc ) , we assume that @xmath59  kpc ( @xmath60  myr ) .",
    "we choose the reduction factor at the shock ( @xmath61 ) , the acceleration efficiency ( @xmath62 ) , and the downstream magnetic field ( @xmath63 ) so that the resultant radio profile and spectrum are consistent with observations ( see later ) .",
    "in general , a smaller @xmath64 and/or a larger @xmath38 give a larger @xmath29 , which leads to more efficient reacceleration [ equations  ( [ eq : dpp])([eq : eta ] ) ] .",
    "we solve equation  ( [ eq : evo ] ) assuming that the whole relic is steady .",
    "this means that electrons are constantly accelerated at the shock and are reaccelerated in the turbulence .",
    "the cr electrons are swept with the icm and those at a distance @xmath65 from the shock were located at the shock @xmath66 ago .",
    "figure  [ fig : evo ] shows the evolution of the cr electron spectrum on the comoving frame . at @xmath67 ,",
    "the spectrum is given by equation  ( [ eq : dsa ] ) and @xmath68 . at @xmath69 ,",
    "the electrons are reaccelerated in the turbulence and the number of high - energy electrons ( @xmath70 ) increases .",
    "those electrons are responsible for the observed synchrotron emission .",
    "the acceleration time scale is given by @xmath71 , and it is @xmath72  myr at @xmath73 and @xmath74 . at @xmath75  myr , the turbulence significantly decays because @xmath76  myr and then cooling becomes effective .",
    "the cooling time is @xmath77100  myr for @xmath78@xmath79 .",
    "thus , the number of high - energy electrons decreases .    in figure",
    "[ fig : prof ] , we show the surface brightness at 610  mhz as a function of the projected distance from the shock ( @xmath80 ) . for that purpose",
    ", we transform the planar shock we implicitly assumed into a curved shock , and then project the radio emission along the line of sight on the sky . following previous studies , we assume that the shock has a ribbon - like curved surface and it is viewed edge - on with a viewing extension angle of @xmath81 ( the total angle subtend is @xmath82 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the curvature radius is 1.5  mpc .",
    "as can be seen , the model profile reproduces the observations well @xcite . at @xmath73 and @xmath74 ,",
    "the spatial scale of the reacceleration is @xmath83  kpc , which is a factor of a few smaller than the peak position of the surface brightness ( @xmath84@xmath85  kpc ) reflecting the increasing @xmath42 [ equation  ( [ eq : eta ] ) ] .",
    "we note that the slower rise of the radio profile at @xmath86 does not necessarily mean that our reacceleration model is superior to dsa models . for the latter",
    ", the radio emissivity generally has its maximum at the shock ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "however , if the shock is curved , the peak position is shifted to @xmath87 ( see figure 4 in @xcite ) .",
    "we also show the profile of spectral index @xmath88 between 153 and 2272  mhz in figure  [ fig : prof ] . at @xmath73 ,",
    "the index is @xmath89 , which is the prediction based on the dsa for @xmath54 : @xmath90 ( e.g. @xcite ) . at @xmath86 ,",
    "the index decreases a little because the momentum spectrum at @xmath70 is soft at the beginning of reacceleration ( see @xmath91  mpc in figure  [ fig : evo ] ) .",
    "then it starts increasing as the reacceleration proceeds .",
    "it would be difficult to observe this dip of the index because of the low surface brightness at @xmath92 ( figure  [ fig : prof ] ) .",
    "the index reaches the maximum , @xmath93 , at @xmath94  kpc , around which the surface brightness is also maximized .",
    "the maximum index is comparable to observation ( @xmath95 ) , which is inconsistent with the standard dsa model because it predicts @xmath96 from @xmath95 @xcite .",
    "then , the index and surface brightness gradually decrease owing to the decay of turbulence and cooling .    in figure  [ fig : spec]a , we show the radio spectrum of the whole relic and compare it with observations by @xcite .",
    "we assume that the length of the relic is 1.7  mpc and the viewing extension angle is @xmath81 .",
    "our model reproduces the curved spectrum very well , because the momentum spectrum of the cr electrons is not a power law ( figure  [ fig : evo ] ) .",
    "the curved spectrum is a natural consequence of second - order fermi acceleration affected by cooling and a finite acceleration time , which is of the order of @xmath97 in our case . in figure",
    "[ fig : spec]b , we show the broad - band spectra of the relic .",
    "the hard x - ray flux from inverse compton scattering is larger than the synchrotron flux , because the magnetic field of @xmath98 is smaller than @xmath99 , at which synchrotron cooling is comparable to the cooling by inverse compton scattering . ) , the relation between the synchrotron flux , the inverse compton flux , and the magnetic fields can not be discussed using the usual formula based on a power - law spectrum ( e.g. equation ( 5.10 ) in @xcite ) . ]",
    "we analyze the suzaku data of the sausage cluster ( see @xcite ) and find that the upper limit of the non - thermal emission is @xmath100 in the 0.310  kev band , which is consistent with our prediction in figure  [ fig : spec]b .",
    "the width of the relic @xmath101 depends on the cooling time of cr electrons .",
    "the typical frequency of synchrotron emission from an electron with a lorentz factor @xmath25 in a magnetic field @xmath102 is @xmath103 .",
    "the cooling time of the electron is @xmath104 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "thus , two values of @xmath102 give the same @xmath105 for a given @xmath106 .",
    "this means that for a given observation frequency @xmath107 , there are two values of @xmath102 that give the same @xmath101 . , which is often assumed when only cooling is important ( e.g. @xcite ) , because it also depends on the reacceleration of crs at @xmath108 .",
    "thus , the magnetic field that gives a certain @xmath101 depends on whether reacceleration is considered or not . ] for the sausage cluster , the value we adopted in figure  [ fig : spec ] ( @xmath63 ) is the smaller one .",
    "figure  [ fig : spec2 ] is the other solution with the larger magnetic field ( @xmath109 ) .",
    "the other parameters are the same as those for figure  [ fig : spec ] except for @xmath110 , and @xmath111 .",
    "figure  [ fig : spec2]a is almost the same as figure  [ fig : spec]a .",
    "moreover , we have confirmed that the profiles of surface brightness and spectral index for this large @xmath38 model are almost identical to those in figure  [ fig : prof ] . on the other hand , the hard x - ray flux in figure  [ fig :",
    "spec2]b is much smaller than that in figure  [ fig : spec]b , which can be used to discriminate the high and low @xmath38 models in future observations .",
    "note that in this large @xmath38 model , the spatial diffusion time ( @xmath112 ) of the crs is comparable to the advection time ( @xmath113 ) around the peak of the surface brightness ( @xmath11430  kpc ) .",
    "thus , the best fit parameters we obtained above would be somewhat changed if we include the effect of spatial diffusion .",
    "is shown in the legends ; @xmath115  myr corresponds to the distance of @xmath116266  kpc . , width=302 ]        , @xmath117 , and @xmath62 .",
    "( a ) integrated radio spectrum ( solid line ) .",
    "filled circles show the data from @xcite .",
    "( b ) broad band spectra .",
    "the solid line shows synchrotron emission and the dotted line shows inverse compton scattering.,width=302 ]     but for @xmath109 , @xmath118 , and @xmath111.,width=302 ]",
    "in this study , we have shown that turbulent reacceleration of electrons can explain the observed surface brightness profile and the hard , curved radio spectrum of the northern radio relic in the sausage cluster .",
    "this model also reproduces the properties of the relic in the toothbrush cluster ( 1rxs  j0603.3@xmath04214l ; @xcite ) .",
    "so far , curved radio spectra have been observed for the bright relics in three clusters ( sausage , toothbrush , and a  2256 ; @xcite ) . this may indicate that the turbulent reacceleration is a fairly common mechanism to create radio relics in clusters .",
    "the spatial scale of turbulence must be smaller than the width of the relic and the mean free path of cr electrons must be much shorter than the coulomb mean free path of thermal particles .    in our model , we assumed that the efficiency of turbulent reacceleration is the highest at the shock front [ equation  ( [ eq : eta ] ) ] .",
    "however , if it takes some time for eddies to grow up , the turbulent reacceleration starts to develop well behind the shock and the synchrotron emission would clearly be detached from the shock .",
    "if this is observed in some relics , it would support our model .",
    "moreover , x - ray observations with a high spectral resolution ( e.g. , hitomi , athena ) may reveal turbulence behind shocks .",
    "some key issues remain unsolved .",
    "first , the generation of turbulence needs to be addressed .",
    "if a shock travels through inhomogeneous gas , turbulence may be generated @xcite .",
    "in fact , some recent x - ray observations suggest that the icm in the outskirts of clusters is clumpy @xcite . using numerical simulations ,",
    "@xcite concluded that the amplitude of density fluctuation must be @xmath119 percent .",
    "however , the wavelengths of the fluctuation they studied are rather large ( @xmath120  kpc ) , and the evolution of turbulence when the wavelength is smaller ( say 10  kpc ) is not certain . alternatively ,",
    "if a shock passes through a turbulent region , turbulence could be amplified downstream of the shock @xcite . moreover , some plasma instabilities may be developing and generating turbulence downstream .",
    "second , relics are often polarized @xcite , which may be incompatible with the turbulent reacceleration model . for the sausage cluster ,",
    "the relic is strongly polarized at the 50 to 60% level @xcite .",
    "however , compressional amplification of the magnetic field may account for a large polarization of the radio emission @xcite .",
    "note that in our model the mean free path associated with the turbulent reacceleration ( @xmath36 ) is much larger than the gyro radius of the cr electrons : @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the elementary charge .",
    "in general , the mean free path is represented as @xmath123 , where @xmath124 is the gyro radius of a particle , @xmath102 is the background magnetic field , and @xmath125 is the fluctuation of the field ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "thus , @xmath126 means @xmath127 , which may indicate that the turbulence on the micro - scales is not strong and magnetic fields may be organized enough .",
    "if the model with the larger @xmath38 and @xmath64 is realized ( figure  [ fig : spec2 ] ) , the fluctuation @xmath128 is even smaller .",
