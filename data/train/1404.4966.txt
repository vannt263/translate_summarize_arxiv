    "strain engineering can be used to control the electronic properties of nanomaterials .",
    "this is of interest for fundamental physics , but is also relevant for potential device applications in nanoelectronics .",
    "because the electronic and mechanical properties of an atomic monolayer of graphene are strongly influenced by strain they have attracted considerable attention over the last years  @xcite .",
    "uniaxial strain was found to shift or even merge the dirac cones  @xcite , however , neither uniaxial nor isotropic strain produces a pseudomagnetic field .",
    "such fields can be produced only by inhomogeneous strain which , when applied to graphene , alters the hopping terms between nearest neighbors such that the additional contribution can be seen as a pseudo - magnetic field with opposite sign in the two dirac cones , preserving therefore the time - reversal symmetry  @xcite .",
    "the strain induced modifications of the electronic properties were subsequently confirmed by stm measurements of highly strained nanobubbles that form when graphene is grown on a pt ( 111 ) surface through the observation of landau levels . these were shown to correspond to strain - induced pseudo - magnetic fields larger than 300  t@xcite .",
    "therefore , the study of non - uniform strain distributions at the atomic scale is a promising road for strain engineering purposes  @xcite , e.g. , the possibility to generate a band gap . in the pioneering work by guinea _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite triaxial strain applied to an hexagonal flake of graphene was shown to induce an energy gap .",
    "this is a direct consequence of generating a constant pseudo - magnetic field profile at the center of the flake while being variable only at the corners .",
    "recent theoretical studies improved several aspects of the initial theory  @xcite .",
    "most of these works concern the strain induced modifications of the continuum low energy dirac hamiltonian which become more complicated as additional orders in strain and momentum are included @xcite .",
    "one such important correction is the spatial and strain dependent fermi velocity  @xcite .",
    "this shows that in addition to the pure gauge field given by the first order in strain , additional momentum dependent terms appear .",
    "it is also interesting to note that applying the triaxial stress on boron - nitride sheet decreases energy gap and localizes the frontier orbital in the center of hexagonal boron - nitride sheet  @xcite .    by using an atomistic model ,",
    "we choose both to express the gauge fields in terms of their full tight - binding expression  @xcite and to describe the electronic properties directly from the tight - binding hamiltonian with inhomogeneous hopping parameters calculated for the deformed graphene flake .",
    "furthermore , flakes of graphene can be useful for quantum dot applications .",
    "there are several studies which address the latter in terms of the energy spectrum of ( unstrained ) graphene flakes with different sizes and different edge structures  @xcite , within both the continuum model and the tight binding discrete model for the dirac equation  @xcite .",
    "recently it was demonstrated experimentally that by straining locally suspended graphene with an stm tip , it is possible to create such quantum dots  @xcite .",
    "recently the resonant tunneling in graphene quantum dot was studied by z. qi  _ et al _ using triaxially stressed graphene flake  @xcite .    in this study",
    "we analyze the effect of triaxial strain on the electronic properties of graphene by using an atomistic model which fully takes into account the relaxation of the graphene lattice using bond order interatomic potential . based on our simulations and using tight - binding theory we show that several of the predictions of ref .",
    "[ ] should be modified resulting in new physical effects .",
    "we found that the vector potential in a hexagonal flake of graphene under triaxial strain behaves differently for zig - zag or armchair terminated edges and the corresponding induced pseudo - magnetic field is spatially inhomogeneous in both cases .",
    "we also show that an energy gap appears in the zig - zag hexagon upon applying triaxial strain .",
    "this is due to the appearance of pseudo - landau levels , which form when the pseudo - magnetic field is large enough such that the magnetic length is smaller than the flake size . for hexagons with armchair edges",
    "we find that pseudo - landau levels are absent , due to the small induced pseudo - magnetic field in the center , and that the local density of states is enhanced mainly at the edge of the sample .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we review the theory of elasticity for triaxial strained graphene . in sec .",
    "iii we present our molecular dynamics simulation method for applying triaxial strain on a hexagonal flake . in sec .",
    "iv , the tight binding model used for calculating the pseudo vector potential and pseudo magnetic field is introduced .",
    "section v includes the main results of our work , i.e. lattice deformation obtained from molecular dynamics simulation , vector potential and pseudo magnetic field and local density of states for both zig - zag and armchair flakes .",

    "we apply triaxial stress on the edges of an hexagonal flake of graphene as indicated in fig .",
    "two different samples with armchair and zig - zag edges are considered and consist of 40234 and 40016 carbon atoms , respectively with optimized initial side i.e. @xmath14 nm . when applying stress , all atoms in the three none - alternative edges experience external constant force during each molecular dynamics simulation ( md ) which causes them to move along the direction of the arrows shown in fig .",

    "the system reaches its equilibrium size under the applied force , resulting in different strains for different forces . in our md simulations",
    "we have used the airebo potentials@xcite which is in particular suitable for simulating hydrocarbons .",
    "the stretching process is done at low temperature ( namely t=10k ) . after reaching the desired strain ( i.e. we study strains up to the breaking point ) we performed energy minimization to find the minimum energy configuration using the conjugate gradient method under the constant force condition .",
    "we notice that there is no out - of - plane deformation in the final minimized samples .",
    "we consider a measure of the strain determined by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the distance between the center of the hexagonal flake and one of the edges under stress .",
    "the final strained samples are no longer perfect hexagons ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the applied stress changes the reciprocal lattice as well as the real space lattice . using the two dimensional fourier transformation of the final strained samples",
    "the change in the reciprocal lattice ( brillouin zone ) is obtained . figures  [ fig2](a , b , c ) show the diffraction pattern of the original un - strained , strained zig - zag and armchair flakes , respectively where @xmath17 .",

    "the variation in the diffraction pattern is different from that of corrugated suspended graphene due to intrinsic thermal ripples@xcite .",
    "it is expected that such new patterns can be realized in experiment . the direct lattice and the reciprocal lattice deformations alter the hexagonal shape of the original brillouin zone and will change the vector potentials  @xcite .",
    "the electronic properties of graphene are described by a tight - binding hamiltonian for the @xmath19 carbon orbitals .",
    "we employ the hamiltonian that describes the low - energy band structure@xcite ignoring the spin degrees of freedom which is motivated by the fact that no spin - flipping terms are present in the hamiltonian .",
    "strain is included in the modified hopping amplitudes between the @xmath19 orbitals , @xmath20 , according to the empirical relation @xmath21 , where @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24  is the equilibrium inter - carbon distance and @xmath25 is the vector which connects the two neighboring atoms in the strained sample ; here we consider both nearest and next - nearest neighbor terms .",

    "[ fig4](f ) ) .",
    "we attribute this discrepancy to the change in the lattice structure due to the relaxation of the graphene sheet .",
    "we note that for the same @xmath49 the shape of the flake obtained from the md simulation is very different from the one obtained from the deformation defined by eq .",

    "our main focus in this work is to find the ldos maps , which could be directly accessed by stm experiments .",
    "the ldos maps are obtained by expanding the green s function at each atomic position in terms of chebyshev polynomials .",
    "the details of this expansion can be found in our previous works @xcite .",
    "here we use both nearest neighbor and next - nearest neighbor contributions in the tight - binding hamiltonian in order to account both for the strain induced vector potential ( nearest neighbor ) and the strain induced scalar potential ( next - nearest neighbor ) .",
    "first , in fig .",
    "[ fig5](a ) , we show the ldos for an atom in the a - sublattice ( which are under stress at the three edges ) in the center of the hexagon for various applied force strengths .",
    "several interesting effects can be observed .",
    "because we also include next - nearest neighbor hopping amplitudes in the calculation , the dirac point for the unstrained hexagon sits at a finite energy , @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the next - nearest neighbor hopping amplitude .",
    "we therefore shift all the ldos curves such that the dirac point of the unstrained configuration sits at the fermi level .",
    "we also observe an additional shift for the strained configurations because of the exponential suppression in @xmath51 , which could be understood in terms of a strain induced scalar potential , which shifts the dirac point downwards in energy  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the reduction in the hopping amplitudes shift the van - hove peaks , signaling also a change in the fermi velocity .",
    "another important effect , noted already in ref .",
    "[ ] , is the appearance of peaks in the ldos for the strained zig - zag hexagon .",
    "these correspond to pseudo - landau levels generated by the strong pseudo - magnetic field observed in the central region of the zig - zag hexagon . when compared to the regular landau levels generated by real magnetic fields , one important difference can be seen : we find that the zeroth landau level has a finite contribution to the ldos only in one sub - lattice , i.e. the sublattice pertaining to the edge atoms under stress .",
    "for the non - zero pseudo - landau levels the sublattice symmetry still holds .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig5](b ) where we show the ldos in the center of the strained hexagon ( with @xmath17 ) for the a and b sub - lattice and compare them with the ldos for the unstrained zig - zag case and the ldos in the center of the strained armchair hexagon .",
    "since the pseudo - magnetic field at the center of the armchair hexagon is small , the ldos does not show pseudo - landau levels , but shows a strain induced shift of both the dirac point and the van hove peaks .",
    "the relativistic nature of the pseudo - landau levels is clearly apparent from fig .",
    "[ fig5](c ) , where we plot the energy of the pseudo - landau levels for different strains as a function of @xmath52 .",
    "note that we shift the pseudo - landau levels such that the zero - landau level sits at zero energy .",
    "surprisingly , the relationship is linear .",
    "note that the pseudo - magnetic field ( also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4](f ) ) was extracted from the energy gap between the zero and first pseudo - landau levels by using a constant fermi velocity and the known relationship : @xmath53 .",
    "even though for low strains the pseudo - magnetic field is proportional to @xmath49 , the suppression of the fermi velocity ( signaled by the shift of the van hove peaks ) will lead to a non - linear dependence of the energy of the pseudo - landau levels on @xmath54 .",
    "this becomes more drastic at high strains , where the pseudo - magnetic field does not follow anymore a linear relationship with respect to @xmath49 ( see fig .  [ fig4](f ) ) .",
    "this can be seen more clearly in fig .",
    "[ fig5p ] , where the energies of the van hove peaks and of the pseudo - landau levels are plotted as a function of @xmath54 .",
    "although the spectrum of the unstrained graphene is not particle - hole symmetric , we fined that in the zig - zag strained graphene samples the higher - n pseudo - landau levels are symmetric with respect to the zeroth pseudo - landau level .",
    "next we show in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] the ldos maps for various energies for a strained zig - zag hexagon with @xmath17 .",
    "the contributions to each sub - lattice are plotted separately for clarity . in panels ( a)-(d )",
    "we show the ldos for the strained configuration , while in panels ( e)-(h ) the ldos for the unstrained zig - zag hexagon is shown for corresponding energies .",
    "the energy of the ldos map in panel ( a ) corresponds to the energy of the zero landau level .",
    "we observe a large increase in the ldos in sub - lattice a ( which are under stress at the three edges ) in the regions where the pseudo - magnetic field is large , together with a suppression of the ldos in sub - lattice b. this effect shows the most important difference between pseudo - magnetic fields and real magnetic fields . since a gap appears in the spectrum , and the time - reversal symmetry is not broken , this is a clear manifestation of a broken sub - lattice symmetry .",
    "if the hexagon would be pulled from the other three sides , the pseudo - magnetic field would change sign and the zero pseudo - landau level will appear in the other sub - lattice .",
    "the ldos map shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6](b ) corresponds to an energy close to the dirac point of the unstrained configuration .",
    "the only noticeable contributions come from the edge - like states , which are again seen only in sub - lattice a. the energies of the ldos maps shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6](c ) and  [ fig6](d ) correspond to the energies of the first and second pseudo - landau levels , respectively . in this case , we observe that the sub - lattice symmetry is preserved in the central region of the hexagon . for these energies",
    "the real and pseudo - landau levels are similar .",
    "interesting features appear also at energies near the van hove peaks , for which the ldos maps show resonant peaks at the center of the hexagon . at these energies peaks start developing , while there is no broken sub - lattice symmetry .",
    "it is important to note that the low energy theory which relates the strain to a pseudo - vector potential is not valid near the van hove peaks mainly because the dispersion is not linear anymore .",
    "movies of the ldos maps for all energies are presented as supplementary materials .",
    "next we show for comparison in fig .",

    "[ fig7 ] , both for the strained , panels ( a)-(d ) , and the unstrained configurations , panels ( e)-(h ) .",
    "the boundary condition now sets the wave - function to zero in both sub - lattices at all hexagon edges .",
    "the main symmetry , which is preserved also in the strained configuration is the mirror symmetry plus a sub - lattice exchange with respect to @xmath56 .",
    "the effect of strain on the ldos maps is not so drastic as the one for the zig - zag hexagon . besides the overall shift in energy due to the appearance of the scalar gauge field",
    ", the main modifications can be seen only at the edges of the hexagon where the pseudo - magnetic field is large . since the field changes sign",
    ", we see localization of states at the dirac point in both a and b sub - lattices .",
    "in this paper we studied the effect of triaxial stress on the electronic and structural properties of hexagonal flakes of graphene with zig - zag and armchair edges .",
    "we combined molecular dynamics simulations to obtain the relaxed atomic positions and the tight binding method to describe the electronic properties .",
    "we found that lattice deformations under triaxial stress are well described by continuum elasticity theory only for small strains ( @xmath48 ) and only in the central part of the sample .",
    "the pseudo gauge field was found to be neither circular symmetric nor homogeneous in space , i.e. there are modified triangular orbits for zig - zag flakes and none - orbital vectors for armchair flakes when the deformed lattice is fully relaxed .",
    "the corresponding pseudo - magnetic field is non - uniform over the sample and exhibits three fold symmetry for a zig - zag flake and a more complex variation for the armchair flake . only for zig - zag flakes",
    "we find that in the central region the pseudo - magnetic field is large and while it varies significantly near the edges , while for the armchair flakes the field is very small in the center and oscillating near the edges .",
    "the local density of states are completely different at the different sub - lattices and are mostly affected by the pseudo - magnetic field distribution . in the zig - zag hexagon",
    "the appearance of pseudo - landau levels breaks the sub - lattice symmetry in the zeroth pseudo - landau level and all relaxed samples show a shift in the energy levels as compared to the undeformed case due to the appearance of a strain induced scalar potential resulting from the expansion of the graphene flake .",
    "we find that molecular dynamics relaxation changes strongly the pseudo - magnetic field and the local density of states as compared to the deformed none - relaxed samples from elasticity theory .",

    "the corresponding result obtained when using the md relaxation is shown as open red circles in fig .",

    "[ figs1](b ) the histogram of c - c bond lengths in the central part ( @xmath575 )  of hexagonal flakes for the two before mentioned methods .",
    "the shorter the bond lengths , the more compact the lattice and the higher the local stress in the central part will be , which results in higher pseudo - magnetic field , see blue triangles and red squares in fig .",

    "[ figs1](c ) the ldos for two relaxed systems by md method for @xmath58 , a deformed system with @xmath59 ( black curve ) by using eq .  ( 1 ) and an undeformed hexagonal flake . here",
    "we use only the nearest - neighbor hopping amplitudes since the only effect of the next - nearest neighbor term is to shift the dirac point .",
    "the position of the pseudo - landau levels and the shift of the van hove peaks are not affected by the change in the next - nearest neighbor hopping . in the case of an undeformed sample ( ordinary hexagonal flake shown by blue triangles in fig .",
    "[ figs1](a ) ) , we see that there is no zero energy state at the dirac point . by deforming the lattice following eq .",
    "( 1 ) with @xmath59 ( hexagonal flake shown by black squares in fig . [ figs1](a ) ) pseudo - landau levels with energy separation proportional to @xmath60 appear for both electrons and holes .",
    "the md relaxation changes significantly the ldos profiles because of the mentioned lattice expansion .",
    "first , we observe that for the same deformation , @xmath59 , the gap between the zero and first pseudo - landau levels is much smaller , consistent with a much lower pseudo - magnetic field .",
    "we also find that fewer pseudo - landau levels can be distinguished , even at high strains , e.g. @xmath61 .",
    "this could be a consequence of the fact that at high strains the pseudo - magnetic field for the md relaxed system is not constant , and therefore the high-@xmath62 pseudo - landau levels are smeared out .",
    "here we show the effect of strain on the pseudo - magnetic field for different strains in zig - zag hexagonal graphene flakes .",
    "the larger the strain the larger the pseudo - magnetic field . in fig .",
    "[ figs2 ] we show the pseudo - magnetic field for strains in the range of [ 2.6@xmath0 - 22.5@xmath0 ] in the central region , i.e @xmath64 nm . it is seen that in the central portion of the zig - zag hexagonal graphene flakes the pseudo - magnetic field is not constant which is in contrast to the continuum elasticity theory prediction  [ 6 ] , and the result obtains from eq .",
    "( 1 ) ,  @xmath47 .",
    "in addition to the method for applying the stress presented here , one can fix the boundary atoms and shift them gradually in the direction perpendicular to the edges .",
    "since the boundary atoms are not allowed to be relaxed during the simulation , the inter - atomic distances at the edge remain constant giving high stress at the corners , which consequently affects the stress distribution through the system .",
    "the latter effect modifies both the pseudo - magnetic field and the ldos .",
    "we found that in case of such a fixed boundary condition the pseudo - magnetic field is higher than the one found from the constant applied force method , as shown in figs .",
    "[ figs3](a - d ) .",
    "moreover , the pseudo - magnetic is also more inhomogeneous .",
    "the recent experimental realization of triaxial strain in molecular graphene  @xcite confirms that the method used in the present work is realistic .",
    "the constant motion of the edges was recently used by z. qi _ et al . _ in order to study the resonant tunneling in hexagonal graphene  @xcite quantum dots .",
    "this should be modified in order to have the relevant order of magnitude of the pseudo - magnetic field and consequently the correct position of the landau levels .",
