    "the latter reported the observation of negative differential resistance , which was interpreted as the gurzhi effect  @xcite arising due to an increase in electron temperature due to current heating .    in graphene  @xcite , hydrodynamic flow",
    "was originally predicted  @xcite to occur at the charge neutrality point ( cnp ) , where thermally - excited electrons and holes undergo frequent collisions due to poorly - screened coulomb interactions  @xcite . in this regime , the authors of ref .",
    "have recently reported experimental evidence of the violation of the wiedemann - franz law , which is consistent with the occurrence of highly - frictional electron - hole flow .    in the future ,",
    "the strongly - interacting 2d electron - hole liquid in undoped graphene may enable investigations of solid - state nearly - perfect fluids  @xcite , i.e.  fluids with very low values of the shear viscosity ( in unit of the entropy density ) and therefore minimal dissipation  @xcite .",
    "at the cnp , however , carrier density inhomogeneities due to long - range disorder are unavoidable  @xcite and should be taken into account for a reliable description of the physics  @xcite .",
    "microscopic calculations  @xcite suggest that also doped graphene sheets can display hydrodynamic behavior above liquid - nitrogen temperatures and for typical carrier concentrations .",
    "the reason is easy to understand . in the conventional fermi - liquid regime ,",
    "i.e.  for  @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the fermi energy , pauli blocking is responsible for a very small rate of quasiparticle collisions and very long e - e mean free paths . in doped graphene  @xcite , @xmath6 $ ] for @xmath7 . as temperature increases ,",
    "however , the fermi surface  softens \" , pauli blocking is not as effective , and @xmath0 quickly decays , reaching a sub - micron size with an approximate power law @xmath8 .",
    "furthermore , in 2d crystals where momentum - non - conserving collisions are dominated by acoustic phonon scattering , @xmath2 decays like @xmath9 , thereby guaranteeing the existence of a temperature window where the hydrodynamic inequalities @xmath3 can be satisfied .",
    "doped graphene systems display very weak inhomogeneities due to the screening exerted on the long - range scattering sources by the electron liquid itself .",
    "moreover , doped systems are characterized by large viscosities  @xcite and values of @xmath0 that can be comparable to @xmath2 , thereby offering an ideal platform to access a hydrodynamic regime in which quantum corrections to the navier - stokes equation are necessary , e.g.  in finite magnetic fields .",
    "a recent experimental study  @xcite of ultra - clean single- and bi - layer graphene encapsulated between boron nitride crystals has indeed demonstrated that the 2d electron system in doped graphene displays hydrodynamic flow . for completeness ,",
    "let us also mention recent reports on hydrodynamic transport in narrow quasi-2d channels of palladium cobaltate  @xcite .",
    "the authors of ref .   demonstrated that the nonlocal resistance in the so - called `` vicinity geometry''fig .",
    "[ fig : setup](a)is negative in a carrier - density - dependent temperature window , as long as one is away from the cnp .",

    "as we will see below , negative nonlocal resistance in the vicinity geometry comes together with _",
    "current whirlpools_. these are regions of the 2d steady - state current spatial pattern that display a vortex and backflow towards the current injector  @xcite .",

    "the latter is less prone to ballistic contributions that also result in negative resistance , which may severely obscure viscous effects  @xcite .",

    "we clearly see that viscosity introduces a region @xmath15 near the injector where the 2d electrical potential is large and negative . [",

    "we hope that this work helps clarifying the subtle connection between backflow and negative nonlocal resistances due to viscosity in 2d electron liquids .",
