    "dominance is a functional inequality which arises in different application fields .",
    "it most often appears when discussing the preservation of properties during ( dis-)aggregation processes like , e.g. , in flexible querying , preference modelling or computer - assisted assessment  @xcite .",
    "it is further crucial in the construction of cartesian products of probabilistic metric and normed spaces  @xcite as well as when constructing many - valued equivalence and order relations  @xcite",
    ".    introduced in 1976 in the framework of probabilistic metric spaces as an inequality involving two triangle functions ( see  @xcite and  @xcite for an early generalization to operations on a partially ordered set ) , it was soon clear that dominance constitutes a reflexive and antisymmetric relation on the set of all t - norms . that it is not a transitive relation has been proven much later in 2007 in  @xcite .",
    "this negative answer to a long open question has , to some extent , been surprising . in particular since earlier results showed that for several important single - parametric families of t - norms , dominance is also a transitive and therefore an order relation  @xcite ( see also  @xcite for an overview and additional results on families of t - norms and copulas ) .",
    "the family of sugeno - weber t - norms has been one of the more prominent families of t - norms for which the dominance has not been completely characterized so far .",
    "first partial results could be achieved in  @xcite by invoking results on different sufficient conditions derived from a generalization of the mulholland inequality and involving the additive generators of the t - norms , their pseudo - inverses and their derivatives ( for more details on the differential conditions see  @xcite , for the generalization of the mulholland inequality look at  @xcite ) .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to close this gap .",
    "we present a proof for a complete characterization of dominance in the family of sugeno - weber t - norms .",
    "this is interesting because from all the families of t - norms discussed in section  4 in the monograph  @xcite , the family of sugeno - weber t - norms was , until now , the only family for which no complete classification result was available .",
    "but there are further aspects which make our results interesting :    first , the solution sets are of a completely different form than witnessed before for other families",
    ". so far dominance in single - parametric families has either been in complete accordance with the ordering in the family ( i.e. , dominance constitutes a linear order on the family of t - norms ) or dominance has rarely appeared between family members , i.e. , holds only in the trivial cases of self - dominance or when involving maximal or minimal elements of the family . for the family of sugeno - weber t - norms neither is the case .",
    "second , although the solution sets look different , dominance is a transitive relation on the family of sugeno - weber t - norms .",
    "third , the results have been achieved by the use of symbolic computation algorithms .",
    "more explicitly a quantifier elimination algorithm for real closed fields ( cylindrical algebraic decomposition ) has , after several transformation steps , been applied to logical equivalent formulations of the original problems .",
    "the present contribution is therefore also an example of a successful application of computer algebra and symbolic computation for solving polynomial inequalities .",
    "the following preliminaries shall clarify the necessary notions and summarize basic facts about the family of sugeno - weber t - norms .",
    "dominance as well as some basic aspects of quantifier elimination algorithms will be explained . we then provide and",
    "prove the main results  the characterization of dominance between two t - norms of the family of sugeno - weber t - norms and transitivity of dominance in the family .",
    "we finally discuss the results in more detail .",
    "we briefly summarize some basic properties of t - norms for a thorough understanding of this paper .",
    "excellent overviews on and discussions of triangular norms ( including historical accounts , further details , proofs , and references ) can be found in the monographs  @xcite , the edited volume  @xcite and the articles  @xcite .",
    "[ def : tnorm ] a _ triangular norm _",
    "( briefly _ t - norm _ ) @xmath0 is a binary operation on the unit interval which is commutative , associative , increasing and has neutral element @xmath1 .    speaking in more algebraic terms , @xmath2 turns the unit interval into an ordered abelian semigroup whose neutral element is 1 .",
    "the most prominent examples of t - norms are the _ minimum _ @xmath3 , the _ product _ @xmath4 , the _ ukasiewicz t - norm _ @xmath5 and the _ drastic product _",
    "they are defined by @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10    obviously , the basic t - norms @xmath11 and @xmath5 are continuous , whereas the drastic product @xmath6 is not . the comparison of two t - norms is done pointwisely , i.e. ,",
    "if , for all @xmath12 , it holds that @xmath13 , then we say that @xmath14 is _ stronger _ than @xmath15 and denote it by @xmath16 .",
    "the minimum @xmath3 is the strongest of all t - norms , the drastic product @xmath6 is the weakest of all t - norms .",
    "moreover , the four basic t - norms are ordered in the following way : @xmath17 .",
    "a t - norm @xmath2 is called    _ archimedean _",
    "if for all @xmath18 there exists an @xmath19 such that @xmath20    a t - norm @xmath2 is called _ strict _ if it is continuous and strictly monotone , i.e. , for all @xmath21 it holds that @xmath22    a t - norm @xmath2 is called _ nilpotent _ if it is continuous and if each @xmath23 is a nilpotent element of @xmath2 , i.e. , there exists some @xmath19 such that @xmath24    note that for a strict t - norm @xmath2 it holds that @xmath25 for all @xmath260,1]$ ] , while for a nilpotent t - norm @xmath2 it holds that for every @xmath23 there exists some @xmath27 such that @xmath28 ( each @xmath23 is a so - called _ zero divisor _ ) .",
    "therefore for a nilpotent t - norm @xmath14 and a strict t - norm @xmath15 it can never hold that @xmath16 .      in 1983",
    "s.  weber proposed the use of this particular family for modelling the intersection of fuzzy sets  @xcite . since then , its dual operations , the sugeno - weber t - conorms , defined for all @xmath29 and all @xmath30 by @xmath31 , have played a prominent role for generalized decomposable measures  @xcite , in particular , since they already appeared as possible generalized additions in the context of @xmath32-fuzzy measures in  @xcite .",
    "the family of sugeno - weber t - norms @xmath33 is , for all @xmath30 , given by @xmath34 the family is of particular interest since all but two of its members are nilpotent t - norms .",
    "parameters @xmath35 lead to nilpotent t - norms ( with @xmath36 as special case ) , while @xmath37 is the only strict member . for @xmath38 ,",
    "the sugeno - weber t - norms are continuous archimedean t - norms  @xcite , for @xmath39 they can be interpreted as convex combinations of @xmath5 and @xmath4 , and are therefore also copulas ( for more details on copulas see also  @xcite ) .    for @xmath40 , an interesting characterization of the family members has been provided in  @xcite : a t - norm @xmath2 is a sugeno - weber t - norm @xmath41 with @xmath40 if and only if @xmath2 is nilpotent , has an additive generator such that for each @xmath42 , the graph of the vertical section @xmath43 of @xmath2 is a straight line segment ( for more details on the additive generators and construction methods for t - norms we again refer to the monographs  @xcite , the edited volume  @xcite and the articles  @xcite ) .",
    "the dominance relation has , as t - norms do , its roots in the field of probabilistic metric spaces  @xcite .",
    "it was originally introduced for associative operations ( with common neutral element ) on a partially ordered set  @xcite , and has been further investigated for t - norms  @xcite and aggregation functions  @xcite . for more recent results on dominance between triangle functions resp .",
    "operations on distance distribution functions see also  @xcite .",
    "we state the definition for t - norms only .",
    "consider two t - norms @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "we say that @xmath14 _ dominates _",
    "@xmath15 ( or @xmath15 is dominated by @xmath14 ) , denoted by @xmath44 , if , for all @xmath45 , it holds that @xmath46    as mentioned already earlier , the dominance relation , in particular between t - norms , plays an important role in various topics , such as the construction of cartesian products of probabilistic metric and normed spaces  @xcite , the construction of many - valued equivalence relations  @xcite and many - valued order relations  @xcite , the preservation of various properties during ( dis-)aggregation processes in flexible querying , preference modelling and computer - assisted assessment  @xcite .",
    "every t - norm , in fact every function non - decreasing in each of its arguments , is dominated by @xmath3 . moreover",
    ", every t - norm dominates itself and @xmath6 .",
    "since all t - norms have neutral element @xmath1 , dominance between two t - norms implies their comparability : @xmath44 implies @xmath16 .",
    "the converse does not hold .",
    "due to the induced comparability it also follows that dominance is an antisymmetric relation on the class of t - norms .",
    "associativity and symmetry ensure that dominance is also reflexive on the class of t - norms .",
    "although dominance is not a transitive relation on the set of continuous , and therefore also not on the set of all , t - norms ( see the results by sarkoci  @xcite and also  @xcite ) , it is transitive on several single - parameteric families of t - norms ( see also table  [ tab : families ] ) .",
    "it is interesting to see that in all the cases displayed in table  [ tab : families ] , dominance is either in complete accordance with the ordering in the family ( i.e. , dominance constitutes a linear order on the family of t - norms ) or dominance rarely appears among family members , i.e. , holds only in the trivial cases of self - dominance and dominance involving maximal or minimal elements of the family ( for an overview on known results and referential details see  @xcite ) .    .dominance relation in several families of t - norms [ cols=\"<,^,^ \" , ]     therefore we inspect the solution set a bit in more detail .",
    "the following function is important for the description of the solution set , so that we briefly discuss its properties :    consider the function @xmath47 defined , for all @xmath48 , by @xmath49 then @xmath50 is strictly decreasing .",
    "moreover , @xmath50 is involutive , i.e. , for all @xmath48 we have @xmath51 .",
    "the function @xmath50 is continuous and differentiable .",
    "its first derivative can be computed , for all @xmath48 , as @xmath52 for @xmath53 it follows that we have @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 and therefore also that @xmath57 for all @xmath58 , i.e. , @xmath50 is strictly decreasing .    by simple computations it can be easily verified that indeed @xmath50 is an involution , i.e. , if @xmath59 then also @xmath60 and therefore @xmath61 for arbitrary @xmath48 .",
    "note that since @xmath50 is continuous and strictly decreasing , its range is a convex set .",
    "the boundary limits can be computed as @xmath62 and @xmath63 such that @xmath64 .",
    "moreover , @xmath65 is one of the fixpoints of @xmath50 .",
    "let us now turn to a series of results which emphasizes different aspects in the dominance relationship between the members of the family of sugeno - weber t - norms .",
    "[ lem0 ] for all @xmath66 , it holds that @xmath67 dominates @xmath68 for all @xmath69 .",
    "let @xmath70 be an arbitrary real number from @xmath71 and choose an arbitrary @xmath69 . if @xmath72 or @xmath73 , the dominance relationship trivially holds .",
    "we therefore assume that @xmath74 . if @xmath75 then @xmath67 dominates @xmath68 because of theorem  [ thm : main1 ]  ( iv ) . if @xmath76 , then @xmath77 and therefore @xmath78 such that @xmath67 dominates @xmath68 because of theorem  [ thm : main1 ]  ( v ) .",
