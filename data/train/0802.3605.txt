    "<S> the problem of the effective mass scaling in the single particle spectra calculated within the skyrme energy density functional ( edf ) method is studied . it is demonstrated that for specific pairs of orbitals the commonly anticipated isoscalar effective mass ( @xmath0 ) scaling of the single - particle level splittings is almost canceled by an implicit @xmath0-scaling due to other parameters in the skyrme edf . </S>",

    "<S> unlike in the other studies cited above our work firmly revealed the need for a simultaneous drastic reduction of the two - body so strength . </S>",

    "<S> the quantity @xmath48 can therefore be used for further fine tuning of the so strength and indeed , a reduction of the so strength by 40% shifts the sly4 curve by 250kev up as expected . </S>",

    "<S> this indicates a clear improvement of the isovector channel due to the presence of a strong isovector tensor component in the functional .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have investigated the impact of the fitting procedures and the datasets used to fit the skyrme energy density functionals with respect to their spectroscopic properties . </S>",
    "<S> we have demonstrated that the use of parameterizations fitted to reproduce bulk nuclear data in the thermodynamic limit and to binding energies of selected double - magic finite nuclei to analyze spectroscopic data may lead to rather poor results . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to an implicit internal @xmath0-scaling of , in particular , the two - body so strength which is a mere consequence of the fitting procedure . </S>",
    "<S> we have further demonstrated that conventional skyrme forces having the two - body so strength and tensor coupling constants fitted directly to the empirical s.p . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath85 so splittings behave according to the expected @xmath0-scaling law for particle - hole excitations . </S>",
    "<S> the present study seems to confirm the common expectation that effective interactions with large effective mass have a superior performance for calculations of spectroscopic data . </S>",
    "<S> it sends however a clear message that this conclusion is strongly dependent on the fitting process for effective forces . involving a larger set of single particle data , </S>",
    "<S> in particular selected high spin terminating states reveal the need for a considerable reduction of the conventional two - body spin - orbit term and at the same time the requirement for a strong tensor term introduced in ref .  </S>",
