    "the process of charm dimuon production stems from the @xmath7 charged - current ( cc ) production of a charm quark , which semileptonically decays into a final state secondary muon with its electric charge opposite to that of the muon from the leptonic cc vertex .",
    "figure  [ fig : dimuonevt ] shows a schematic feynman diagram of the process .",
    "the deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) production of charm quarks involves the scattering off both the strange and the non - strange quark content of the nucleon .",
    "however , the contributions from @xmath8- and @xmath9-quarks are suppressed by the small quark - mixing cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix elements .",
    "a measurement of the cross - section for charm dimuon production in neutrino dis off nucleons provides the most direct and clean probe of @xmath10 , the strange quark sea content of the nucleon .",
    "inclusive cross sections are indeed not very sensitive to the strange quark sea content , since , in this case , the complementary contributions from strange and non - strange distributions are strongly anti - correlated .",
    "in addition , the flavor selection offered by neutrino and anti - neutrino interactions allows a determination of both @xmath10 and @xmath11 separately .",
    "the strange quark contribution is particularly important at small values of the parton momentum fractions @xmath12 , where the quark distributions are dominated by the sea .",
    "this kinematic region is crucial in high - energy hadron collisions for the study of many processes and therefore an accurate determination of the strange sea is required for the interpretation of experimental data .",
    "the knowledge of the strange quark sea content of the nucleon and of charm production is also the dominant contribution to the systematic uncertainties in the electroweak measurements from ( anti)neutrino dis interactions  @xcite .",
    "traditionally , charm dimuon production in ( anti)neutrino interactions has always been measured in massive calorimeters , mainly composed of passive heavy materials ( iron , marble , lead etc . ) in order to obtain a sizeable number of events  @xcite .",
    "this detection technique , while relatively simple and efficient , is ultimately limited by the coarse resolution of the detectors and by the resulting systematic uncertainties .",
    "the high resolution nomad data allow a new level of precision in the measurement of charm dimuon production in neutrino interactions .",
    "the use of a low density target located inside a magnetic spectrometer measures the momentum and emission angle of all secondary particles produced in neutrino interactions .",
    "additionally , the detector offers the capability of making redundant _ in situ _ measurements of all relevant backgrounds , minimizing the reliance on monte carlo simulation ( mc ) of the hadronization process . for the first time a high resolution reconstruction of neutrino interactions",
    "can be achieved from high statistics samples , typical of the most massive calorimeters but without the corresponding limitations .",
    "furthermore , the neutrino spectrum in nomad is well suited to study charm production close to the charm threshold , providing enhanced sensitivity to the charm production parameters .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : charmprod ] gives a short overview of the charm dimuon production in neutrino charged current interactions . in section  [ sec - nomad ]",
    "we describe the neutrino beam and the nomad detector used for our measurement .",
    "section  [ sec : selection ] explains our event selection and the corresponding cuts . in section  [ sec : analysis ] and section  [ sec : unfolding ] we describe the analysis scheme used for our precision measurement and the unfolding procedure needed to extract the final cross - sections , respectively .",
    "we present our final nomad results in section  [ sec : results ] and provide a detailed discussion of systematic uncertainties in section  [ sec : syst ] .",
    "section  [ sec : charmfit ] discusses the extraction of charm production parameters and of the strange quark sea content of the nucleon from nomad data .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : summary ] gives a summary of the main results achieved .",
    "due to their larger mass , the sea strange quarks are suppressed with respect to the @xmath8 and @xmath9 sea quarks .",
    "the strange sea suppression factor : @xmath30dx } { \\int_0 ^ 1 x\\left [ \\overline{u}(x , q^2)+\\overline{d}(x , q^2)\\right ] dx},\\ ] ] increases with the momentum transfer @xmath15 .    experimental data on neutrino induced dis charm production is typically collected on heavy targets ( e.g. iron ) , rather than on free nucleons .",
    "nuclear corrections must then be applied to the structure functions entering the @xmath31 cross - section in order to take into account the effect of the nuclear medium . in general ,",
    "nuclear corrections in neutrino interactions are different from those for charged - lepton interactions  @xcite and can be described to a good accuracy by the model of ref.@xcite .    in the lo",
    "the dimuon cross section is related to the corresponding cross section for charmed - quark production as : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the production fraction of the charmed hadron @xmath34 , @xmath35 is the fragmentation function of the charm quark into a given charmed hadron @xmath36 carrying a fraction @xmath37 of the charm quark momentum , and @xmath38 is the corresponding inclusive branching ratio for the muon decays  . _ ] . here",
    "@xmath39 refers to a generic charmed baryon . at nlo",
    "the coefficient functions entering the sfs calculation depend , in general , on @xmath37 as well .",
    "the charm fragmentation function @xmath40 defines the energy of the outgoing charmed hadron and , in turn , of the secondary muon produced in the semileptonic decay . assuming a universal @xmath40 for all charmed hadrons and integrating over @xmath37 , eq .",
    "( [ eqn : frag ] ) becomes @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the effective semileptonic branching ratio , and the universal fragmentation function can be described by the collins - spiller parameterization  @xcite : @xmath43 ( 1+z)^2 \\left [ 1 - \\frac{1}{z } - \\frac{\\varepsilon_{\\rm c}}{1-z } \\right]^{-2}\\ ] ] with @xmath44 as a free parameter .",
    "this parameterization has a more accurate asymptotic behavior in the limit of @xmath45 than the peterson form  @xcite",
    ". the charmed fractions @xmath33 depend on the incoming neutrino energy .",
    "this fact can be explained by the contributions from quasi - elastic @xmath46 and diffractive @xmath47 production .",
    "measurements of @xmath33 and @xmath48 in neutrino interactions were performed by the e531  @xcite and chorus  @xcite experiments using the emulsion detection technique , which allowed them to reconstruct exclusive final states .",
    "the neutrino oscillation magnetic detector ( nomad ) experiment at cern used a neutrino beam produced by the 450  gev protons from the super proton synchrotron ( sps ) incident on a beryllium target and producing secondary @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 mesons .",
    "the positively charged mesons were focussed by two magnetic horns into a 290  m long evacuated decay pipe .",
    "decays of @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath52 produced the sps neutrino beam .",
    "the average neutrino flight path to nomad was 628  m , the detector being 836  m downstream of the be - target .",
    "the sps beamline and the neutrino flux incident at nomad are described in  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath53-flux in nomad can be estimated from the @xmath49 and @xmath50 production measurements in proton - be collision by the spy experiment  @xcite and by an earlier measurement conducted by atherton _",
    "et al . _",
    "the @xmath54-integrated relative composition of @xmath55 cc events , constrained _ in situ _ by the measurement of cc - interactions of each of the neutrino species , is @xmath56 .",
    "thus , 97.5% of the events are induced by neutrinos with a small anti - neutrino contamination .",
    "the nomad apparatus , described in  @xcite , consisted of several sub - detectors . the active target comprised 132 planes of @xmath57  m@xmath3 drift chambers  @xcite ( dch ) with an average density similar to that of liquid hydrogen ( 0.1  gm/@xmath58 ) . on average , the equivalent material in the dch encountered by particles produced in a @xmath53-interaction was about half of a radiation length and a quarter of a hadronic interaction length ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "the fiducial mass of the nomad dch - target , 2.7 tons , was composed primarily of carbon ( 64% ) , oxygen ( 22% ) , nitrogen ( 6% ) , and hydrogen ( 5% ) yielding an effective atomic number , a=12.8 , similar to carbon .",
    "downstream of the dch , there were nine modules of transition radiation detectors  @xcite ( trd ) , followed by a preshower ( prs ) and a lead - glass electromagnetic calorimeter  @xcite ( ecal ) . the ensemble of dch , trd , and prs / ecal was placed within a dipole magnet providing a 0.4  t magnetic field orthogonal to the neutrino beam line .",
    "downstream of the magnet was a hadron calorimeter , followed by two muon stations each comprising large area drift chambers ( mch ) and separated by an iron filter .",
    "the two stations , placed at 8- and 13-@xmath59 s downstream of the ecal , provided a clean identification of the muons .",
    "the charged tracks in the dch were measured with an approximate momentum ( @xmath60 ) resolution of @xmath61 ( @xmath60 in gev/@xmath62 and @xmath63 in meters ) with unambiguous charge separation in the energy range of interest . the energy deposition from @xmath64 and @xmath65",
    "were measured in ecal with an energy resolution of @xmath66 ( @xmath16 in gev ) .",
    "the experiment recorded over 1.7 million neutrino interactions in the active drift - chamber target in the range @xmath67  gev .",
    "the detector was suspended from iron pillars ( the  i s ) at the two ends of the magnet .",
    "the front pillar was instrumented with scintillators to provide an additional massive active target for neutrino interactions , the front calorimeter ( fcal ) .",
    "the fcal consisted of 23 iron plates 4.9 cm thick and separated by 1.8 cm gaps .",
    "twenty out of the 22 gaps were instrumented with long scintillators , which were read out on both ends by 3 in photomultipliers .",
    "the dimensions of the scintillators were @xmath68 @xmath58 . to achieve optimal light collection and a reasonable number of electronic channels",
    "five consecutive scintillators along the beam axis were ganged together by means of twisted light guides to form a module .",
    "ten such modules were placed above each other to form a stack .",
    "four stacks were placed along the beam axis .",
    "the area of the fcal `` seen '' by the neutrino beam was @xmath69 cm@xmath3 .",
    "the detector had a depth of about five nuclear interaction lengths and a total fiducial mass of about 17.7 tons , composed mainly of iron .",
    "the energy deposition in fcal was measured with a resolution @xmath71 ( @xmath16 in gev ) .",
    "the experiment recorded over 18 million neutrino interactions in the fcal in the range @xmath67  gev .    in front of the fcal",
    "there was a plane of scintillators , @xmath72 , used to veto charged particles entering the detector . before and after the trd there were two planes of scintillators , @xmath73 and @xmath74 , whose coincidence provided the main trigger for charged tracks in the drift chamber volume .",
    "the schematic of the fcal and the dch - tracker with a charm dimuon event candidate is shown in figure  [ fig : evtdimuon ] .",
    "the main trigger selection used for the analysis of fcal data requires an energy deposition in the fcal of at least 3.15 m.i.p .",
    "- m.i.p . is the signal of a minimum ionizing particle crossing one fcal stack - and no signal in the @xmath72 veto scintillator plane : @xmath75 - ( fcal trigger ) .",
    "this trigger vetoes through - going muons and has a live time of @xmath76 .",
    "a second independent trigger selection with lower threshold is used to measure the fcal trigger efficiency from data ( fcal@xmath77 trigger ) . for this trigger an energy deposition of at least 1.2 m.i.p . in the fcal",
    "is requested , in addition to the coincidence with a signal from the scintillator plane in the trd region : @xmath78 .",
    "the live time is @xmath76 .",
    "we measure the efficiency of the fcal trigger directly from data in the following way : @xmath79 we determine the fcal trigger efficiency separately for each of the 4 stacks and each of the 4 years of data taking , for a total of 16 configurations .",
    "the final trigger efficiency is obtained by averaging over the different stacks and years of data taking , weighted by the corresponding numbers of @xmath7 cc events identified in the data .    in order to take into account the saturation of the readout electronics , which resulted in a reduced value of the adc counts observed in the data at high energies , we apply a correction function to the adc response of each individual fcal module in the monte carlo .",
    "this correction function is obtained by minimizing the @xmath80 between the total energy distributions in the fcal for @xmath7 cc events in data and monte carlo .",
    "the energy deposited in each stack , @xmath81 , is calculated as the sum of the energy depositions ( in m.i.p . )",
    "of the ten individual fcal modules ( in m.i.p.)in the stack : @xmath82 the relative calibration of individual modules in m.i.p .",
    "( adc to m.i.p ) is performed by using the energy deposition of high energy muons from sps secondary beams crossing the fcal in between neutrino spills .",
    "the muon tracks are reconstructed in the drift chambers and extrapolated back to the fcal .",
    "the absolute energy deposition in gev is then obtained by dividing the values of @xmath81 by the appropriate mip / gev conversion factor @xmath83 : @xmath84 the constant @xmath83 is obtained from the default mc simulation by comparing the reconstructed to the simulated energy and is validated by the analysis of single muon events in data .    after determining the response function between the simulated energy and the energy reconstructed in fcal @xmath85",
    ", we extract the inverse function @xmath86 from the mc simulation by comparing separately the simulated and reconstructed shower energy for events originated in each stack .",
    "the reconstructed shower energy is obtained by subtracting the energy loss by the muons from the total energy measured in fcal .",
    "the analysis of fcal data proceeds with the selection of two independent samples : a ) inclusive @xmath7 cc events with a single negatively charged muon ; b ) dimuon events .",
    "all the applied cuts are relatively loose in order to avoid potential biases of the samples and to retain a large signal efficiency .",
    "in addition , we try to use similar selection cuts ( if applicable ) for both the dimuon and the @xmath7 cc samples .",
    "these criteria minimize systematic uncertainties from the event selection procedure .",
    "we identify two different dimuon samples : the opposite sign dimuons ( osdm ) with two muons of opposite charge , and the like sign dimuons ( lsdm ) with two muons of the same charge ( background sample ) .",
    "the momenta of the identified muons , @xmath87 for the primary muon and @xmath88 for the secondary one , are measured with high precision with the dch located in the low density spectrometer following fcal .",
    "we define the primary muon as the one with the largest transverse momentum relative to the beam direction .",
    "the total hadronic energy of the event , @xmath89 , is calculated from the sum of the energy of the hadronic shower measured in fcal and the energy of the secondary muon @xmath90 and of any other charged track measured in the drift chambers , minus the energy loss of the primary and secondary muons in fcal . the reconstructed neutrino energy is obtained as the sum of the energy of the primary muon and the total hadronic energy : @xmath91 .",
    "the dis kinematic variables are reconstructed in the following way : @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the angle of the primary muon with respect to the neutrino beam direction in the lab frame and @xmath18 is the mass of the proton .",
    "the applied cuts are :    * fcal trigger and good run . * one negatively charged muon , @xmath94 , identified by the mch . * a second muon , @xmath95 , identified by the muon system : either a @xmath96 from @xmath62-quark production / background or a @xmath97 from background .",

    "it is worth noting that we can obtain a further reduction on the uncertainty of the strange quark sea distributions by including both nomad and nutev / ccfr in a global fit  @xcite , since the kinematic coverage of nomad dimuon data is complementary to the one in nutev and ccfr .",

    "@xcite - since @xmath120 is expected to increase with the number of loops considered . from the same fit to nomad dimuon data including the e531 data from figure  [ fig : bmu ] we also extract the semileptonic branching ratio @xmath48 , parameterized according to eq .",

    "we have presented a new measurement of charm dimuon production using events originated in the front calorimeter of the nomad experiment ( fe target ) .",
    "our final data sample has the largest statistics - 15,344 charm dimuon events - as well as the lowest energy threshold - @xmath127 - among the existing measurements .",
    "we find the charm dimuon production rate , averaged over the nomad flux for @xmath128  gev@xmath3/c@xmath3 , to be @xmath129 compared to the rate of the inclusive @xmath7 cc interactions .",
    "a key feature of our analysis is the extraction of the whole background predictions from the data themselves , together with a substantial reduction of the minimal energy thresholds on the observed muons with respect to previous measurements .",
    "both achievements have been possible only through the use of a low density and high resolution magnetic spectrometer , allowing a detailed reconstruction of the energy and momentum of individual secondary particles produced in neutrino interactions .",
    "with such a high resolution detector and a control sample of more than @xmath0 reconstructed @xmath7 cc events , we could keep the total systematic uncertainties - including 17 different sources - on the ratio of charm dimuon to inclusive cc cross - sections at the level of about @xmath130 .",
    "this value makes our analysis the most precise measurement of charm dimuon production in neutrino interactions .",
    "finally , we used the new nomad data on charm dimuon production to determine the charm production parameters and the strange quark sea content of the nucleon within the context of a qcd fit . for the calculation of the charm contributions to the structure functions we use the running mass in the @xmath4 scheme and",
