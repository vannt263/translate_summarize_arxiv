    "an ongoing research effort , numerical relativity , attempts to solve the partial differential equations ( pdes ) pertaining to the einstein equations using numerical methods .",
    "a significant current focus is centered on the study of the relativistic two - body problem  @xcite .",
    "the broad features of the dynamics are already _ approximately _ known , through well established semi - analytical approaches , including perturbation theory  ( see e.g. , a review in @xcite ) and post - newtonian approximations  ( see e.g. , latest developments in @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it seems intuitively right that one should be able to leverage such knowledge and reduce the computational complexity of the problem .",
    "there have been recently a number of proposals on various non - standard _ physical approximations _ to the spacetimes involved in mergers  @xcite .",
    "a common theme among such proposals is the elimination of degrees of freedom which are thought of as not crucial for some phase of the computation .",
    "there is also presently activity on the mathematical notions underlying numerical relativity , with particular emphasis on the hyperbolicity properties of the equations ( see e.g. , @xcite ) and the nature of the propagation of the constraints . even while the mathematical structure of the general problem is under scrutiny , there are particular instances of initial value problems which provide significant insights . for example , characteristic evolution of spacetimes that admit caustic - free foliations appear to be completely tractable  @xcite .",
    "significant improvements have also been claimed using approaches which decompose the field variables in certain ways  @xcite .",
    "we would like to advance in this paper a different perspective for numerical relativity .",
    "we will avoid any physical approximation to the equations , but we will try instead to pin down geometrically and analytically the system by introducing additional `` guiding '' structures in the spacetime manifold .",
    "the key concept will be a background geometry , constructed analytically , or semi - analytically , and encompassing the a priori knowledge about the system .",
    "the true dynamics will then unfold as a `` correction '' on the background .",
    "the proposal is promising on several grounds .",
    "it is easy to show that reformulating the evolution in terms of finite perturbations can lead to significant gains in _ accuracy _ for systems that never deviate significantly from the background .",
    "this is also borne out in preliminary computations .",
    "it is possible that the _ stability _ of computations will improve as well .",
    "this is much harder to ascertain concretely .",
    "we note that currently the main avenues for improving stability are sought in the direction of securing hyperbolicity properties and the convergence of the constraints , but this effort has not been conclusive .",
    "the relevance of source terms seems less well understood .",
    "the concept of a background geometry has already been used in analytic studies of initial value problems ( see e.g. , in  @xcite ) , and it has also been claimed that the use of a background spacetime clarifies the task of defining energy and momentum quantities for the gravitational field  @xcite .",
    "the treatment presented in  @xcite is particularly enlightening for the motivation of this paper .",
    "there , two four - dimensional metrics are introduced on the spacetime manifold @xmath0 .",
    "one of them , say @xmath1 , is promoted to physical status by virtue of satisfying the einstein equations . the other , @xmath2 ,",
    "is relegated to a background role .",
    "its associated christoffel symbols , @xmath3 , are used for the construction of a covariant derivative @xmath4 .",
    "it is this derivative with respect to which one then expresses all relevant differential equations , e.g. , gauge conditions and the einstein equations .",
    "the fundamental evolution variables are the _ inverse metric differences _",
    "@xmath5 where @xmath6 is the determinant of the @xmath7 metric . with the imposition of the harmonic gauge ,",
    "@xmath8 one obtains the reduced set of einstein s equations , @xmath9 where @xmath10 denotes terms of order lower than two and barred quantities in the right - hand side are the ricci curvatures and scalars associated with the four dimensional background metric .",
    "two remarks are worthwhile here .",
    "first , if @xmath2 is _ any _ exact solution of @xmath11 then the rhs of this equation is zero , which reflects the importance of the background for the structure of the source terms .",
    "second , the hyperbolic characteristic structure of the equation is transparent , given its resemblance to a system of wave equations .",
    "it is noteworthy that whereas the source structure is background dependent , the hyperbolic structure solely relies on the _ physical _ metric .",
    "following this example , we will formulate here the einstein evolution problem with a view towards numerical applications .",
    "to this end we will work within the framework of the 3 + 1 decomposition .",
    "there are several reasons for opting for this path in view of the above mentioned ( covariant ) examples .",
    "maybe most importantly , we would like to have explicit control over the gauge functions , as we would like to construct them using a priori information . additionally , the 3 + 1 decomposition is tightly linked to a hamiltonian framework .",
    "we will not explicitly exploit this feature here , but this will ultimately facilitate a systematic use of background spacetimes derived from post - newtonian approximate solutions .    the main result of this paper is the introduction of a set of new 3 + 1 evolution systems for the einstein equations which explicitly separate a background geometry . the sets of evolution variables denote the finite deviations of the physical geometry from the assumed background .",
    "we derive systems involving second or first order spatial derivatives , with a corresponding change in the number of variables . in both cases",
    "we write the equations in a form which can explicitly cancel stationary or quasi - stationary balance terms , _ provided that adequate a priori description of those terms exists_. we found that implementing the background geometry concept in conjunction with a hyperbolic system requires a slightly generalised geometrical construction",
    ". we will hence talk about the strong and weak versions of the proposal , according to the strength of the assumptions on the specifications of the physical and background spacetimes .",
    "all systems are constructed as three - covariant with respect to the background metric .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii we review some results in order to establish the notation . in section iii",
    "we will describe a framework based on the introduction of a background spatial metric and develop the geometric objects emerging in this picture .",
    "we then write evolution equations for the spatial tensors describing the deviation of the physical geometry from a background one .",
    "the two natural sets emerging are closely related to the adm and einstein - christoffel systems .",
    "we argue that the metric compatibility condition in the latter is more properly seen as a geometric identity on the three dimensional riemann tensor . in section iv we will generalise the framework slightly , in order to develop a symmetric hyperbolic system for appropriate evolution fields . in section",
    "v we make a number of remarks .",
    "we discuss implementation issues and a number of potential applications .",
    "we will adopt the signature conventions used in  @xcite . throughout the paper ,",
    "greek indices denote spacetime indices running from 0 to 3 , whereas latin indices are spatial indices and run from 1 to 3 .",
    "parentheses and square brackets will denote symmetrization and antisymmetrization respectively .",
    "reference to geometric objects like vectors and tensors will refer to spatial objects , unless otherwise stated .",
    "we will systematically use an overbar to distinguish geometrical objects referring to a background geometry . raising and lowering of indices will always be using the physical metric .",
    "we will consider only the vacuum case , i.e. , absence of matter sources ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "studies of matter systems ( in particular fluids ) along similar lines are pursued separately  @xcite and a generalisation will be given elsewhere .",
    "the 3 + 1 decomposition ( also known as the arnowitt - deser - misner ( adm ) formulation ) of einstein s equations  @xcite has been discussed in detail in many works ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "it assumes that the spacetime has topology @xmath13 , and hence it is foliated by the level surfaces @xmath14 of a scalar function @xmath15 .",
    "the unit normal to the hypersurfaces @xmath14 , @xmath16 , satisfies @xmath17 .",
    "it can be used to decompose the four - metric as @xmath18 the vector field @xmath19 ( time threading of the manifold , @xmath20 ) giving rise to the relations @xmath21 and @xmath22 allows to write the metric element in the form @xmath23 here , @xmath24 is the lapse scalar , which is assumed to be positive , @xmath25 is the spatial shift vector , and @xmath26 is the spatial metric ( or first fundamental form ) induced on the hypersurfaces @xmath14 .    in terms of the unit normal , the second fundamental form or extrinsic curvature of the spatial hypersurfaces",
    "is given by @xmath27 where the time operator is @xmath28 , and @xmath29 denotes lie differentiation with respect to @xmath25 . in particular , @xmath30 where @xmath31 . the einstein equations are decomposed in a set of evolution equations for the components of the extrinsic curvature @xmath32 the momentum constraint @xmath33 and the hamiltonian constraint @xmath34 in these equations @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 are the canonical covariant derivative , ricci tensor , and scalar curvature associated with the spatial metric @xmath26 respectively .",
    "the einstein field equations are equivalent to the evolution equations ( [ hdot ] ) and ( [ kdot ] ) together with the constraints ( [ mcon ] ) and ( [ hcon ] ) . given initial data on an initial hypersurface @xmath39 , i.e. @xmath40 satisfying the constraints , and freely specifiable quantities @xmath24 and @xmath25 defined for all @xmath14 , one can use the evolution equations to find the future development of such data .",
    "the framework is explicitly three - covariant .",
    "we assume a second spatial metric field , denoted by @xmath41 , cohabiting with @xmath26 on each of the hypersurfaces @xmath14 .",
    "the four - dimensional manifold @xmath0 is then endowed with an additional four - metric defined by @xmath42 where @xmath43 the normal @xmath44 is now a unit normal vector with respect to _ both _ metrics .",
    "then , there is a unique projection operator onto the hypersurfaces @xmath14 , @xmath45 .",
    "as is clear , this construction uses the same lapse @xmath24 and shift vector @xmath25 for both spacetimes and hence the name _",
    "strong version_. taking into account the relations @xmath46 and @xmath22 we write the background metric in the form @xmath47 the extrinsic curvature associated with the background geometry can be computed from the expression @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the connection associated with the background spacetime metric @xmath2 .",
    "this leads to @xmath50    the two spatial metrics give rise to compatible covariant derivatives @xmath36 and @xmath51 satisfying @xmath52 and @xmath53 . if @xmath54 denotes the christoffel symbols associated with @xmath41 then @xmath55 , the difference of the christoffel symbols , is also a tensor . indeed , under a coordinate change @xmath56 , the christoffel symbols transform as @xmath57",
    "whence the tensorial transformation law for @xmath58 follows @xmath59 in fact , the explicitly covariant expression for @xmath58 is @xmath60 where @xmath61 we see that @xmath62 is the covariant derivative of the physical spatial metric with respect to the background spatial canonical connection .",
    "the two covariant derivatives acting on a general tensor field are related by @xmath63    pictorially our geometric construct is presented in fig .",
    "the unit normal vector field @xmath64 represents eulerian observers momentarily at rest on the hypersurface @xmath14 and is by construction the same for both spacetimes .",
    "the _ acceleration _",
    "1-form of those observers , @xmath65 , ( with @xmath66 ) , is the same as seen from both spacetimes .",
    "some calculations show that @xmath67 where we have used the fact that the background and physical four - covariant derivative have the same action on the scalar @xmath68 .",
    "we turn now to the task of writing the 3 + 1 decomposed einstein equations in terms of a background metric",
    ". one further identity we will need relates the ricci tensors of the two metrics ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) in terms of @xmath69 . using the explicitly symmetric form of the ricci tensor ,",
    "such an identity is : @xmath70    we rewrite the basic evolution system in the following form : @xmath71 where we have used the relation ( [ dtdb ] ) to convert covariant derivatives with respect to the connection @xmath51 into covariant derivatives with respect to @xmath51 . moreover , the lie derivatives in the time operator @xmath72 are expanded as @xmath73 and @xmath74 in the above equations , @xmath69 is shorthand for equations  ( [ eps],[delt ] ) .",
    "hence this is the classic adm form of the evolution system , but expressed using a background metric and connection",
    ".    it will be useful here to introduce an alternative expression for eq .",

    "the spatial connection tensor @xmath98 arose naturally with the consideration of a background metric .",
    "in contrast , we will need to explicitly introduce `` perturbative '' spatial metric and extrinsic curvature tensors . to simplify the notation we will use the symbol @xmath99 to denote `` perturbative '' quantities : @xmath100 .",
    "then , the relation between the `` perturbative '' spatial metric and extrinsic curvature tensors @xmath101 is given by @xmath102 on the other hand , we can always write the following evolution equation for the background extrinsic curvature @xmath103 which has to be considered as the definition of @xmath104 . in the special case where ( @xmath105 )",

    "in what follows we introduce a modified version of the framework described in sec .  [ sec2 ] .",
    "as before , in addition to the physical metric @xmath26 we assume a second metric field , denoted by @xmath41 , cohabiting with @xmath26 on each of the hypersurfaces @xmath14 , but instead of considering the same unit normal vector we consider a new one @xmath123 which we assume to be parallel to the physical one @xmath124 , i.e. @xmath125 ( @xmath126 ) . we can combine these objects to define a background four - metric in the following way @xmath127 where @xmath128 satisfies the same conditions as in the strong version [ see eq .",

    "the eulerian observers associated with the background metric follow the same worldlines as the corresponding observers in the physical spacetime , but their acceleration is different : @xmath138 as opposed to @xmath139 .",

    "there are many ways of reformulating einstein s equations in order to get a hyperbolic system of partial differential equations ( see  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the structure of the equations for @xmath142 suggests that the hyperbolicity properties will be very closely linked to the first - order symmetric hyperbolic formulation introduced recently in  @xcite .",

    "the main results of this paper are the introduction of a set of new evolution systems for the einstein equations which explicitly separate a background geometry .",
    "we have studied two broad classes , which differ slightly in their geometrical construction .",
    "an important realisation has been that for constructing a hyperbolic set of evolution equations one must relax the assumption of a common lapse .",
    "the reason lies with the fact that the use of a densitized lapse is important for inducing the appropriate modification to the principal part of the equations .",
    "this introduces a gauge function that incorporates information about the three metric . on the other hand ,",
    "having a background spacetime which shares the same lapse and shift as the physical one is crucial for a maximal simplification of the resulting equations .",
    "the choices are summarised in fig .",
    "the introduction of a background geometry makes all the systems explicitly three - covariant . besides a certain aesthetic appeal",
    ", this feature may be handy in applications involving multiple coordinate systems , e.g. , spherical coordinate patches adapted to black holes and infinity respectively .",
    "we note that in determining the light - cone structure , or in the case of the first order systems , the propagation of eigenfields , it is the physical metric that is always the governing field .",
    "this implies that there would be no unpleasant side - effects associated with the choice of a background spacetime that is causally incompatible with the physical one .",
    "we have not elaborated on the hamiltonian and momentum constraints .",
    "those are essential for the construction of consistent initial data .",
    "the conformal techniques and decompositions involved in reducing those equations to well behaved elliptic systems seem at first glance not to be particularly benefiting from the assumption of a generic background geometry .",
    "a key issue that must be considered is the way in which the use of a background geometry would modify the numerical properties of evolution equations for the einstein system .",
    "common to most approaches to the evolution problem is the solution of a quasi - linear system of explicitly or implicitly hyperbolic equations _ with sources_. for spacetimes involving compact objects , large curvature gradients are present .",
    "those gradients survive in the stationary ( non - dynamical limit ) and involve a balance between flux terms in the principal part of the equation and the source terms .",
    "the source terms are not homogeneous in the evolution fields which can also be expressed as the existence of longitudinal modes . for fluid spacetimes ( e.g. , neutron stars )",
    "this balance has physical underpinnings in the fluid pressure supporting the star . for black holes",
    "it is geometric in nature .",
    "the implementation of the systems developed here can proceed in a number of manners . after a suitable choice of background geometry , a direct discretization of the equations using standard discrete approximations is possible .",
    "a practise usually adopted is to ignore the constraint equations in the construction of the algorithm ( free evolution ) and to monitor them as time dependent error norms .",
    "the integration of a physical data set will then consist of a sequence of discrete timesteps into the future . in principle , for a stable and convergent algorithm",
    ", the solution can be found at any future finite time to any desired accuracy given enough resolution . with the use of prescribed background geometry one",
    "has the flexibility of a more interactive approach to the time evolution , namely through an _",
    "iteration _ of the evolution process",
    ". this technique could be useful in circumstances in which the background geometry is constructed analytically on the basis of a few poorly known parameters , e.g. , post - newtonian locations and momenta of black holes .",
    "the iterations would then provide improved estimates for those parameters . whereas _ any _ of the iterative steps can in principle converge to the true solution , it has been our argument that the residual errors will be dramatically reduced as one improves the guess on the background spacetime .",
    "the incorporation of matter dynamics has not been discussed here .",
    "there is no specific obstruction to the process . in contrary ,",
    "an implementation of closely related non - linear perturbation concepts to the relativistic euler equations is already underway with promising results  @xcite .",
    "an optimal application candidate would be the study of non - linear perturbations of a single black hole spacetime . in this case",
    "the stationary exact black hole solutions provide readily available first guesses for the background geometry .",
    "more speculative , but well motivated , is the application to multiple black hole systems . here",
    "the appropriate construction of an approximate spacetime would make heavy use of post - newtonian solutions .",
    "the framework provides a well defined path for systematically _ incorporating _ post - newtonian results into the full pde evolution , which only hinges on the suitable expansion of post - newtonian results into global metric data .",
