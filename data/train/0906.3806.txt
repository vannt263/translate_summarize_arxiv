    "recent evidences from supernova searches data [ 1,2 ] , cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) results [ 3 - 5 ] and also wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) data [ 6,7 ] , show an positively accelerating phase of the cosmic expansion today and this feature shows that the simple picture of the universe consisting of the pressureless fluid is not enough to describe the cosmological dynamics . in this regard ,",
    "the universe may contain some sort of the additional negative - pressure dark energy .",
    "analysis of the wmap data [ 8 - 10 ] shows that there is no indication for any significant deviations from gaussianity and adiabaticity of the cmb power spectrum and therefore suggests that the universe is spatially flat to within the limits of observational accuracy .",
    "further , the combined analysis of the wmap data with the supernova legacy survey ( snls ) [ 8 ] , constrains the equation of state @xmath3 , corresponding to almost @xmath4 contribution of dark energy in the currently accelerating universe , to be very close to that of the cosmological constant value . in this respect ,",
    "a lcdm ( cosmological constant plus cold dark matter ) model has maximum agreement with the recent data .",
    "moreover , observations appear to favor a dark energy equation of state , @xmath5 [ 11 ] . therefore , a viable cosmological model should admit a dynamical equation of state that might have crossed the value @xmath6 in the recent epoch of cosmological evolution [ 12 ] .",
    "in fact , to explain positively accelerated expansion of the universe , there are two alternative approaches : incorporating an additional cosmological component ( dark energy ) in matter sector of the general theory of relativity ( @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are energy - momentum tensor of ordinary matter and dark energy respectively ) , or modifying geometric sector of the theory ( dark geometry)(@xmath10 ) at the cosmological scales .",
    "multi - component dark energy with at least one non - canonical _ phantom _ field is a possible candidate of the first alternative .",
    "this viewpoint has been studied extensively in the literature ( see [ 13,14 ] and references therein ) . another alternative to explain current accelerated",
    "expansion of the universe is extension of the general relativity to more general theories on cosmological scales . in this view point , modified einstein - hilbert action via @xmath11-gravity ( see [ 15 ] and references therein ) or braneworld gravity [ 16 - 18 ] are studied extensively . in this framework the geometric part of the einstein s field equations are modified .",
    "for instance , dgp ( dvali - gabadadze - porrati ) braneworld scenario as an ir modification of the general relativity explains accelerated expansion of the universe in its self - accelerating branch via leakage of gravity to extra dimension . in this model ,",
    "equation of state parameter of dark energy never crosses the @xmath12 line , and universe eventually turns out to be de sitter phase .",
    "nevertheless , in this setup if we use a single scalar field ( ordinary or phantom ) on the brane , we can show that equation of state parameter of dark energy can cross phantom divide line [ 19 ] .",
    "one important consequence in the quintessence model of dark energy is the fact that a single minimally coupled scalar field has not the capability to explain crossing of the phantom divide line , @xmath13 [ 20 ] .",
    "however , a single but non - minimally coupled scalar field is enough to cross the phantom divide line by its equation of state parameter [ 13,14 ] .",
    "lorentz invariance violating vector fields in an interactive basis are other possibility to realize cosmological line crossing [ 21 ] .",
    "lue and starkman [ 22 ] based on the analysis firstly reported by sahni and shtanov [ 23 ] have shown that one can realize the phantom - like effect ( increasing of the effective dark energy density with cosmic time ) in the normal branch of the dgp cosmological solution without introducing any phantom field .",
    "this type of the analysis then has been extended by several authors [ 24 ] .",
    "the normal branch of the model which can not explain the self - acceleration , has the key property that brane is extrinsically curved so that shortcuts through the bulk allow gravity to screen the effects of the brane energy - momentum contents at hubble parameters of the order of the inverse of crossover distance [ 22 ] .",
    "since in this case @xmath14 is a decreasing function of the cosmic time , the effective dark energy component is increasing with time and therefore we observe a phantom - like behavior without introducing any phantom matter .",
    "it is important to note that crossing of the phantom divide line in this viewpoint is impossible without introduction of a quintessence field on the brane [ 24 ] .",
    "this idea has been studied further to incorporate curvature effects [ 25 ] .",
    "the importance of this type of reasoning lies in the fact that we do nt need to introduce phantom fields that violate the null energy condition and suffer from several theoretical problems .",
    "here we are going to study phantom - like effect in the normal branch of a general dgp inspired @xmath0 scenario .",
    "the dgp inspired @xmath0 scenarios have been studied in refs .",
    "[ 26,27 ] .",
    "our motivation to study phantom - like behavior of this extension of the dgp scenario is the fact that to have crossing of the phantom divide line on the dgp brane we have to incorporate a quintessence field on the brane [ 24 ] . on the other hand ,",
    "it is reasonable to assume that induced gravity on the brane can be modified .",
    "in fact , as has been argued in refs [ 28 ] , generalized version of dgp scenario ( such as modified induced gravity ) , can be ghost free and can give rise to transient acceleration ( see also [ 23 ] and [ 29 ] ) .",
    "here we are focus on the normal branch of the scenario which is ghost - free .",
    "we show that for the case with @xmath15 , the effective dark energy density reduces by increasing the values of the non - minimal coupling , @xmath16 .",
    "we extend our study to the general @xmath11-gravity to explore the role played by the modification of the induced gravity on the screening of the brane cosmological constant and the phantom - like effect .",
    "we show that phantom - like behavior can be realized in this setup without violating the null energy condition at least in some subspaces of the model parameter space .",

    "the reason for incorporation of this canonical scalar field lies in the fact that without scalar field it is impossible to realize phantom divide line crossing in dgp setup .",
    "we have shown that the effective dark energy density decreases by increasing the values of the conformal coupling @xmath16 in a constant cosmic time slice . however , for a constant @xmath16 , we have phantom - like behavior ( increasing of the effective dark energy density with cosmic time ) in the normal branch of the scenario without introducing any phantom field .",
    "then we have extended our study to a general dgp - inspired @xmath0 scenario where we incorporate possible modification of the induced gravity on the brane . in this case",
    "we obtained some new and interesting results which we summarize as follows : by adopting the ansatz @xmath161\\ , , $ ] we have shown that phantom - like behavior can be realized in the normal branch of the scenario if @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "in other words , for @xmath150 the effective dark energy in this dgp - inspired @xmath0 model has no phantom - like behavior .",
    "investigation of the expansion history of this model shows that this dgp - inspired @xmath0 scenario has the best fit with the recent observational data .",
    "in fact this model is very close to a lcdm scenario .",
    "finally we found conditions for transition to phantom phase of this model which has the potential to realize phantom divide line crossing .",
    "for the case of a quintessence scalar field non - minimally coupled to the induced gravity on the brane , the null energy condition is fulfilled since there is no phantom matter on the brane and the phantom dynamics is essentially gravitational which saves the null energy condition . also that the brane tension does not violate the null energy condition too . for a general dgp - inspired @xmath0 scenario ,",
    "the null energy condition is respected only in some subspaces of the model parameter space depending on the choice of the model of modified gravity . + * acknowledgement * + we would like to thank a referee for his / her important contribution in this work .    38 s. perlmutter _",
