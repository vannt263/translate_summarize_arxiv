    "renormalizability endows the standard model ( sm ) with enhanced predictive power due to the fact that ultraviolet ( uv ) divergences from quantum effects can be eliminated by a redefinition of a finite number of independent parameters , such as masses and coupling constants .",
    "furthermore , it has been known for a long time that , in the most frequently employed formulations in which the complete bare mass matrices of quarks are diagonalized , the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) quark mixing matrix @xcite must be also renormalized @xcite .",

    "a matter of considerable interest is the generalization of these considerations to minimal renormalizable extensions of the sm . in particular , in refs .",

    "a minimal realization of such a theory is the sm with right - handed dirac and majorana neutrinos @xcite , an appealing scenario that may explain the smallness of the observed neutrino masses and may lead to neutrino - less double beta decays .",
    "furthermore , this minimal extension may give rise to a number of observable phenomena , such as lepton - flavor and/or lepton - number violation in @xmath0 , @xmath1 @xcite and @xmath2-boson decays @xcite , or to possible lepton - number - violating signals at high - energy colliders @xcite .    the aim of this paper is to generalize the on - shell renormalization of the ckm matrix recently proposed in ref .",

    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "after briefly reviewing in section  [ sec : majorana ] the basic formalism of the seesaw mechanism in the minimal extension of the sm neutral - lepton sector , we evaluate in section  [ sec : self - energies ] the one - loop self - energy insertions ( see figs .",
