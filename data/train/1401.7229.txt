    "recently , an exponential increase in the demands of wireless service has imposed a significant challenge on the design of wireless networks .",
    "advanced techniques , such as physical - layer network coding ( pnc ) , has been developed to achieve high spectrum efficiency @xcite .",
    "the simplest model for pnc is the two - way relay channel ( twrc ) where two users exchange messages with the help of a relay node . with the well - known two - phase pnc protocol ,",
    "the relay node receives a combination of the signals transmitted from the two users in the first phase , and then broadcasts a network - coded message in the second phase .",
    "the desired message is then extracted at each user end by exploiting the knowledge of the self - message . as compared to conventional one - way relaying where four phases are required in one round of information exchange",
    ", pnc potentially achieves @xmath9 improvement in spectrum efficiency over twrcs .",
    "abundant progresses have been made on the pnc design for twrcs ; see @xcite and the references therein . in particular , it was shown in @xcite that , with nested lattice coding , the capacity of the twrc can be achieved within @xmath10 bit .",
    "later , the authors in @xcite introduced the multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) technique into twrcs .",
    "it was revealed that the space - division based network coding scheme proposed in @xcite achieves the asymptotic capacity of the mimo trwc at high signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) within @xmath11 bit per relay spatial dimension for an arbitrary antenna configuration .",
    "a natural generalization of the twrc is the multiway relay channel ( mrc ) , where multiple users exchange messages with the help of a single relay .",
    "several mrc models have been studied in the literature recently . specifically , the authors in @xcite studied a cellular two - way relaying model where a base station exchanges private messages with multiple mobile users via a relay node ; the authors in @xcite investigated mrcs in which the users are grouped into pairs and the two users in each pair exchange information with each other ; more generally , the authors in @xcite studied clustered mrcs , in which the users in the network are grouped into clusters and each user in a cluster wants to exchange information with the other users in the same cluster .",
    "approximate capacities of these mrc models were studied in @xcite and @xcite , while the exact capacity characterizations still remain open .",
    "also , these initial works on mrc are limited to the single - antenna setup , i.e. , each node in the network is equipped with one antenna .",
    "the mimo technique has been introduced into mrcs to allow spatial multiplexing . in a mimo mrc , as each user in general transmits multiple spatial streams , a new challenge to be addressed is to mitigate the inter - stream interference at the relay and at the user ends .",
    "degrees of freedom ( dof ) is a critical metric in characterizing the fundamental capacity of a wireless network @xcite .",
    "the dof of the mimo mrc has been previously studied in @xcite .",
    "for example , the authors in @xcite investigated the dof capacity of the mimo y channel ( a special case of the mimo mrc with three users ) and showed that the dof capacity can be achieved when @xmath12 , where @xmath1 denotes the number of antennas at each user , and @xmath2 denotes the number of antennas at the relay .",
    "the authors in @xcite generalized the results in @xcite by considering a three - user asymmetric mimo y channel with different numbers of antennas at the users , and proved that the dof capacity can be achieved for arbitrary antenna setups .",
    "recently , as parallel to the work in this paper , the work in @xcite established the dof capacity of the four - user symmetric mimo y channel for arbitrary antenna setups .",
    "further , the authors in @xcite studied more general data exchange models in which the users in the network are grouped into clusters , and each user in a cluster exchanges information only with the other users in the same cluster . in particular , the authors in @xcite derived sufficient conditions on the antenna configuration to achieve the dof capacity of a clustered mrc with pairwise data exchange , in which each user in a cluster sends a different message to each of the other users in the same cluster .",
    "note that the data exchange models considered in @xcite and @xcite can be regarded as the one - cluster case of the model studied in @xcite .",
    "moreover , the author in @xcite derived an achievable dof for a clustered mimo mrc with full data exchange , i.e. , each user in a cluster delivers a common message to all the other users in the same cluster .    in this work",
    ", we study a symmetric mimo mrc with pairwise data exchange , and derive an achievable dof for an arbitrary setup of the antenna numbers @xmath4 and the user number @xmath0 . roughly speaking , the dof of a network is the number of independent spatial streams that can be supported by the network . in the mimo mrc of concern ,",
    "multiple users are simultaneously served by a common relay . to ensure that multiple spatial streams are still separable at every user end ,",
    "the number of relay antennas is usually the bottleneck of the network to achieve a higher dof .",
    "therefore , the challenge is how to align the user and relay signals to efficiently utilize the relay s signal space . to this end",
    ", we propose a novel and systematic beamforming design to achieve efficient signal alignment .",
    "specifically , we refer to a bunch of spatial streams as a _ unit _ ,",
    "in which each pair of users who want to exchange information contribute two spatial streams , one from each user ; each spatial stream impinges upon ( or is emitted from ) the relay s antenna array at a certain direction , and these directions form a spatial structure , referred to as a _",
    "pattern_. the dimension of the space spanned by the spatial streams in a pattern gives a metric to evaluate the efficiency of this pattern .",
    "then , the signal alignment problem is to construct units with the most efficient patterns to occupy the overall relay s signal space .",
    "an achievable dof can be obtained by counting the number of units that can be constructed for any given antenna setup of @xmath4 .",
    "the main contributions of this work are summarized as follows :    * we show that , for the considered mimo mrc with @xmath3 , the proposed signal alignment scheme achieves the dof capacity for an arbitrary @xmath4 setup , which coincides with the dof result of @xcite , and improves the existing dof capacity result in @xcite by including @xmath13 . * for the case of @xmath5 , we derive the dof capacity of the mimo mrc for @xmath6 $ ] and @xmath7 .",
    "this result is stronger than the previous result obtained in @xcite , where the achievability of the dof capacity is limited in the ranges of @xmath14 $ ] and @xmath7 . * for @xmath5",
    ", we also derive an achievable dof for an arbitrary setup of antenna numbers @xmath4 satisfying @xmath15 .",
    "our analysis reveals that the achievable dof is piecewise linear and is bounded either by the number of antennas at each user or by the number of antennas at the relay .",
    "this piecewise linearity is similar to the dof capacity obtained for the mimo interference channel in @xcite . *",
    "finally , we derive an asymptotic achievable dof when @xmath0 tends to infinity .",
    "we show that the derived achievable total dof is upper bounded by @xmath16 for arbitrary values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
