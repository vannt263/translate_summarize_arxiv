    "the determination of the nuclear equation of state ( eos ) , which is of vital importance for the nuclear astrophysics , has been a central object of numerous studies of heavy ion ( hi ) collisions for the last two decades .",
    "if the efforts in the early 90 s were concentrated on the determination of the incompressibility @xmath2 of _ symmetric _ nuclear matter ( nm ) , for different types of the eos are usually distinguished by different @xmath2 values @xcite , recent studies of nuclear reactions involving unstable nuclei lying close to the neutron or proton driplines provide us with a unique opportunity to learn about the eos of _ asymmetric _ nm which has a large difference between the neutron and proton densities @xcite .",
    "the knowledge about the nm symmetry energy ( a key ingredient in the eos of asymmetric nm ) is vital not only in studying the dynamics of hi collisions involving radioactive nuclei and/or their structure , but also in studying the neutron star formation or the @xmath3-process of stellar nucleosynthesis @xcite . in particular , the most efficient process of the neutron star cooling , the so - called _ direct _ urca process in which nucleons undergo direct beta ( and inverse - beta ) decays @xcite , can take place only if the proton - to - neutron ratio exceeds 1/8 or the proton fraction @xmath4 in the @xmath1-equilibrium .",
    "the latter is entirely determined from the density dependence of the nm symmetry energy @xmath5 by the following balance equation @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the total nm density .",
    "it is of fundamental importance whether the direct urca process is possible or not . if the @xmath8 value can not reach the threshold for the direct urca process , then the neutron star cooling should proceed via the indirect or _ modified _ urca process which has a reaction rate of @xmath9 times smaller than that of the direct urca process and implies , therefore , a much longer duration of the cooling process @xcite .",
    "although a recent test @xcite of the microscopic eos against the measured neutron star masses and flow data of hi collisions has shown that the direct urca process is possible in some cases if the predicted neutron star mass is above a lower limit of @xmath10 solar mass ( @xmath11 ) , the overall cooling time of a neutron star is still unknown as yet @xcite due to the uncertainty about the high - density behavior of @xmath5 .",
    "we also note here a very strong influence by the neutron superfluidity in the inner crust of neutron star @xcite , where the superfluid effects can reduce the cooling time by a factor of @xmath12 . in the same direction , the cooling time might be further shortened by the possible phase transitions to quark matter or pion condensate occurring in the core of neutron star and leading , therefore , to a much higher central density and a smaller star radius @xcite .",
    "microscopic studies of the eos of asymmetric nm have been performed in both nonrelativistic and relativistic nuclear many - body theories , using realistic two - body and three - body nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) forces or interaction lagrangians ( see more details in recent reviews @xcite ) .",
    "these many - body studies have shown the important role played by the pauli blocking as well as higher - order nn correlations in the g - matrix used to generate the nm binding energy at different densities .",
    "these medium effects are considered as physics origin of the density dependence introduced into various effective nn interactions used presently in the nonrelativistic mean - field approaches . among different versions of the effective nn interaction ,",

    "since the hf method is the first order of many - body calculation , some realistic density dependences have been introduced into the original m3y interaction @xcite to effectively account for the higher - order nn correlations which cause the nm saturation . during the last decade ,",
    "different density dependent versions of the m3y interaction have been used in the hf calculations of symmetric and asymmetric nm @xcite , in the mean - field studies of nuclear structure @xcite as well as in numerous folding model studies of the nucleon - nucleus and nucleus - nucleus scattering @xcite . in view of these studies , it is now highly desirable to have a realistic version of the effective nn interaction for consistent use in the mean - field studies of nm and finite nuclei as well as in the nuclear reaction calculations . as an exploratory step , we perform in the present work a systematic hf study of nm using two density - dependent versions of the finite - range m3y interaction , the cdm3y@xmath0 interactions which have been used mainly in the folding model studies of the nucleon - nucleus and nucleus - nucleus scattering @xcite and m3y - p@xmath0 interactions which have been carefully parametrized by nakada @xcite for use in the mean - field studies of nuclear structure . for comparison ,",
    "the same hf study is also performed with some realistic versions of the gogny @xcite and skyrme @xcite interactions .",
    "like other mean - field approaches , we consider in the present hf study a homogeneous spin - saturated nm at zero temperature which is characterized by given values of neutron and proton densities , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , or equivalently by its total density @xmath15 and its neutron - proton asymmetry @xmath16 . with the direct ( @xmath17 ) and exchange ( @xmath18 ) parts of the interaction determined from the singlet- and triplet - even ( and odd ) components of the central nn force , the total nm binding energy is determined within the hf formalism as @xmath19 , \\label{e2}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 are the ordinary plane waves .",

    "the value of @xmath5 at the saturation density of symmetric nm , @xmath25@xmath26 , is also known as the symmetry energy coefficient @xmath27 which has been predicted by numerous many - body calculations to be around 30 mev @xcite .",

    "[ f4 ] and one can see that the stiffness of the nm symmetry energy is gradually increasing as one goes from fsugold and g2 to the hybrid results . it has been found by steiner @xcite that the rmf models typically have a large symmetry energy and a large proton fraction , and the du process becomes possible at rather low nm densities . this effect can be clearly seen in the hybrid and g2 results shown in fig .",
    "[ f4 ] where the corresponding proton fractions reach du threshold at the nm densities of @xmath75 and 0.32 @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "we note further that @xmath5 predicted in the hybrid model is very close to the rmf result by klhn _",
    ". _ @xcite using the nl@xmath76 parametrization where the proton fraction is reaching the du threshold at @xmath77 @xmath26 .",
    "the behavior of the proton fraction predicted by the fsugold model is somewhat different from those predicted by the hybrid and g2 models .",
    "namely , it approaches the muon - free threshold @xmath78 only at @xmath57 @xmath26 , like the microscopic apr result . with the predicted maximum neutron star mass of @xmath79 ,",
    "the fsugold model has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite to allow partially the du process in the neutron star cooling .",
    "however , if we adopt the _ averaged _ du threshold taken from ref .",
    "@xcite which takes into account the muon presence at high densities , then the du process is unlikely in this case because the proton fraction predicted by the fsugold model seems to saturate at densities @xmath80 @xmath26 , around a value of @xmath81 ( see lower panel of fig .  [ f4 ] ) like the apr results @xcite discussed above .",
    "although the experimental evidences are still divergent with respect to the asy - stiff and asy - soft type mean - field interactions , it is of interest to further explore the difference between these two groups in terms of the nm incompressibility . using the general definition ( [ e3])-([e4 ] )",

    "( [ e8 ] ) that the behavior of the isovector incompressibility @xmath84 should correlate closely with the nm symmetry energy @xmath5 .",

    "see more details in text.,scaledwidth=85.0% ]    we have plotted in fig .",
    "[ f5 ] the density dependence of @xmath84 given by the numerical differentiation of the hf results for @xmath5 and one can see that the @xmath84 value given by the ( asy - stiff ) cdm3y@xmath0 interactions is positive over the density range @xmath88 and gradually increases to @xmath89 mev at @xmath7 approaching 0.6 fm @xmath90 ( the du - onset density found with these interactions ) . on the contrary ,",
    "the @xmath84 value given by the ( asy - soft ) m3y - p@xmath0 and gogny interactions is negative over the same density range and decreases linearly to about -1000 mev at @xmath7 approaching 0.6 fm @xmath90 .",
    "since @xmath82 is actually determined from the first derivative of nm pressure @xmath47 with respect to the density , a strongly _ negative _ isovector incompressibility @xmath91 should indicate a decrease of @xmath47 in the transition from symmetric nm to the pure neutron matter .",
    "indeed , one can see in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] that a decrease of @xmath47 in the pure neutron matter was found with the ( asy - soft ) m3y - p@xmath0 and gogny interactions which pulls the calculated @xmath47 out of the empirical boundaries established by the hi collective flow data @xcite . based on this discussion",
    ", we conclude that the behavior of isovector incompressibility @xmath91 given by the ( asy - stiff ) cdm3y@xmath0 interactions is more consistent with the hi flow data compared with @xmath91 given by the ( asy - soft ) m3y - p@xmath0 and gogny interactions .    in the literature ,",
    "the discussion on the isovector part of the nm incompressibility is very often made based on the @xmath2 values estimated at the saturation density @xmath28 of symmetric nm .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the saturation density of asymmetric nm decreases rather quickly with the increasing neutron - proton asymmetry @xmath32 , and the pure neutron matter ( @xmath92 ) becomes _ unbound _",
    "( see lower panel of fig .",
    "[ f1 ] and also fig .  2 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . as a result ,",
    "@xmath28 is no more a stable extremum in the nm energy curve and various expansions around it like ( [ e5 ] ) might not be accurate for large neutron - proton asymmetries @xmath32 .",
    "for example , the second derivative of the approximated expression ( [ e5 ] ) for @xmath5 gives a purely parabolic density dependence of the isovector incompressibility , @xmath93 , which can strongly deviate from the exact hf result at high densities as shown in fig .",
    "in addition , the higher - order @xmath24 term in eq .",
    "( [ e5 ] ) has been shown by steiner @xcite to be important in determining the critical density for the du process in neutron stars . in the vicinity of @xmath28 ,",
    "the @xmath84 values given by the hf calculation ( encircled in fig .",
    "[ f5 ] ) are quite close to the corresponding @xmath31 coefficients of the expansion ( [ e5 ] ) , i.e. , @xmath94 . in the studies of the hi isospin diffusion @xcite or isospin dependence of the gmr excitation @xcite , the asymmetry of the nm incompressibility around @xmath28 was associated with the quantity @xmath95 which has been confined by these data to @xmath96 mev .",
    "the empirical @xmath97 value has been shown by a recent study of the neutron - skin thickness by centelles _",
    "@xcite to be around @xmath98 mev . from table  [ t0 ] one can see that @xmath97 values obtained from the ( asy - stiff ) dbhf , v@xmath99+ct , hybrid and mdi ( x=-1 ) results are in good agreement with the empirical values ; the asy - stiff cdm3y@xmath0 interactions give @xmath97 values of about -330 mev which are somewhat above the upper limit of empirical data ; the asy - soft mdi ( x=1 ) , m3y - p@xmath0 and gogny interactions give @xmath97 values of about -400 mev , right at the empirical upper limit .",
    "however , we note that a very recent mean - field study of asymmetric nm using a large number of skyrme - type interactions by chen _",
    "@xcite has found an optimum range @xmath100 mev and , thus , cast some doubt on previously adopted empirical @xmath97 values . in the context of our paper , this latest analysis seems to give preference to the ( asy - stiff ) cdm3y@xmath0 interactions .",
    "some further preference for the asy - stiff interactions can also be made based on the empirical constraints on the @xmath69 and @xmath30 parameters established recently by the msu group in the analysis of the isospin diffusion and ratios of neutron and proton spectra measured in hi collisions @xcite .",
    "namely , one can see in table  [ t0 ] that only the @xmath30 and @xmath69 values given by the ( asy - stiff ) cdm3y@xmath0 and sly4 interactions are lying within the ranges of the double constraint deduced from the isospin diffusion data : @xmath101 mev and @xmath102 mev ( see fig .  1 of ref .",
    "the ( asy - soft ) gogny and m3y - p@xmath0 interactions give @xmath30 values much lower than this limit and this indicates again that the ( asy - stiff ) cdm3y@xmath0 interactions comply better with the hi data .",
    "we note here also a similar empirical range for the slope parameter @xmath103 mev established recently in a systematic study of the correlation between the neutron - skin thickness and symmetry energy @xcite .",
    "however , the neutron - skin thickness has been shown by danielewicz @xcite to be mainly sensitive to the surface part of the symmetry energy term in a more elaborate mass formula for finite nuclei , while the extrapolation to the high - density behavior of the nm symmetry energy is based more on the volume term .",
    "therefore , the empirical ranges for @xmath104 and @xmath97 values deduced from the neutron - skin studies should be necessary reference points for any mean - field study of asymmetric nm but not sufficient constraints to restrict the behavior of the nm symmetry energy at high densities .",
    "finally , we note that all the mean - field calculations discussed in the present work do not take into account the _ hyperon _ presence in the neutron star .",
    "the hyperon population has been estimated to make up about 18% of the neutron star matter and shown to significantly soften the eos as well as reduce the limiting neutron star mass @xcite . in this case ,",
    "not only the direct urca process involving hyperons becomes possible @xcite but also the proton fraction is significantly enhanced by the hyperon presence .",
    "for example , the proton fraction of a hyperon star having mass @xmath105 is about 50% larger than that of a neutron - proton - lepton star of the same mass ( see fig .  5.28 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . as a result ,",
    "if we assume for simplicity a 50% rise in the proton fractions predicted , e.g. , by the microscopic apr calculation or fsugold model at @xmath106 @xmath26 ( see lower panel of fig .",
    "[ f4 ] ) , then the du process is well allowed within these models . concerning a typical asy - soft interaction like the gogny , m3y - p@xmath0 or mdi ( x=1 ) ,",
    "such a 50% increase of the proton fraction is still not enough to make the du process possible .",
    "in the framework of the self - consistent hf mean field , we have studied the bulk nuclear matter properties predicted by two different sets ( cdm3y@xmath0 and m3y - p@xmath0 ) of the density - dependent m3y interaction , sly4 version of the skyrme interaction as well as d1s and d1n versions of the gogny interaction .",
    "the hf results for the nm symmetry energy and proton fraction in the @xmath1-equilibrium are also compared with those given by the microscopic many - body studies ( dbhf and apr calculations ) using the bare nn interaction , and by the rmf studies using different parameter sets .",
    "we have concentrated our discussion on two main aspects : the nm binding energy and pressure in the symmetric nm and pure neutron matter , and the density dependence of the nm symmetry energy @xmath5 and the associated proton fraction ( [ e1 ] ) . for the symmetric nm ,",
    "the main conclusion is that all the effective nn interactions used here are more or less consistent with the microscopic apr prediction and empirical pressure deduced from the hi collective flow data . for the pure neutron matter ,",
    "the hf predictions for the nm binding energy and pressure show that the considered mean - field interactions are divided into two families which are associated with two different behaviors ( asy - soft and asy - stiff ) of the nm symmetry energy at high densities , where only the asy - stiff type interactions comply with the empirical nm pressure .",
    "these two families were shown to predict two different behaviors of the proton - to - neutron ratio in the @xmath1-equilibrium which , in turn , imply two drastically different mechanisms for the neutron star cooling ( with or without the direct urca process ) .",
    "although an ambiguity in the high - density behavior of the nm symmetry energy still remains due to the experimental evidences from hi studies favoring both the asy - soft and asy - stiff versions of the mean - field interaction , a comparison of the present hf results with the empirical constraints for the symmetry coefficient @xmath69 and slope parameter @xmath30 , given by the hi isospin diffusion data and ratios of neutron and proton spectra @xcite and the systematic study of the neutron - skin thickness @xcite , seems to provide some evidence favoring the asy - stiff type interactions .",
    "the asy - stiff behavior is also predicted by the fully microscopic bhf or dbhf calculations @xcite which include the higher - order many - body effects and three - body forces , and by the latest rmf studies @xcite .",
    "a big puzzle remains why on the ( nonrelativistic ) mean - field level , a wide range of the nuclear structure data can be consistently described only by using some asy - soft type effective interaction like the famous gogny forces or m3y - p@xmath0 interaction . in each case , the chosen parameter set for the effective nn interaction depends strongly on the nuclear structure and/or reaction data under consideration @xcite and there could be a plethora of systematic uncertainties in different choices for the mean - field interaction which are not under control and can lead , in particular , to the distinct _ soft _ and _ stiff _ scenarios . in any case , the ability of available structure and/or reaction data to constrain the eos for high - density neutron rich nm on the mean - field level is still limited and the most interesting challenges are lying ahead .",
