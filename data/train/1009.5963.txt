    "it should be noted that these sections concentrate mostly on the unique features of the experiment as examples of the wider programme .",
    "the final section of these proceedings provides a brief summary of the highlights of this work .",
    "the physics programme of can be summarised as the search for direct and indirect signs of physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) , generically referred to as _",
    "new physics _ , while simultaneously performing precision tests of the sm  @xcite .",
    "the searches for new physics are sensitive to particles with masses far in excess of the reach of experiments , lepton flavour violating ( lfv ) processes in the @xmath5 sector , on mass shell light dark matter and light higgs candidates , and manifestations of so - called dark forces .",

    "this opens up the possibility to study time - dependent asymmetries in @xmath6 decays in analogy to the violation studies that have been done at the existing @xmath4 factories .",
    "in addition to this unique potential , by accumulating a large sample of data at the @xmath2 , one will be able to make precision measurements of a number of decay constants and other parameters .",
    "these will improve theoretical understanding of experimental programmes at lhcb and the super flavour factories , in particular the measurements of @xmath7 , and of charm mixing .",
    "many of these measurements will be useful in validating lattice qcd and theoretical frameworks , and in parallel many rare decay studies will be able to provide constraints on new physics . * by having a polarised electron beam , it is possible to make precision tests of the electroweak sector that complement slc and lep measurements of @xmath8 .",
    "the benefit of having such a measurement is that it is essentially free from theoretical uncertainties .",
    "the polarised electron beam will enable one to reconstruct the @xmath5 polarisation , and use this information as a discriminating variable when searching for lepton flavour violating processes .",
    "one will also be able to measure the @xmath5 edm and @xmath9 using these data .",
    "once the design goals of have been achieved , there is scope to increase luminosity by up to a factor of four .",
    "if that is realisable then , just as with the @xmath4 factories , the physics programme of will expand significantly .",
    "those measurements of rare processes or small effects that would have been marginal in terms of sensitivity with 75would provide very significant constraints to further our understanding of nature at high energy if one accumulates several hundred .",
    "the precision of measurements that are central to the physics programme of this experiment would also be surpassed in almost all circumstances .",
    "as with any frontier , by pushing the intensity to a new level , one would be exposed to additional opportunities to constrain nature .    will be able to cover a wider range of measurements than the experiment , with more data . where there is overlap between the programmes of these two experiments",

    "many of these results will help us understand the flavour sector of the sm and new physics scenarios , which in turn may have relevance for the matter - antimatter asymmetry problem , and the origin of the universe .",
    "studies of rare decays may help elucidate the type of new physics and energy scale that this occurs at .",
    "precision measurements of @xmath8 , are related to the electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) process , central to the sm , and searches for light higgs particles may elucidate ewsb beyond the sm .",

    "a number of rare @xmath4 decays are sensitive to new physics through loops or flavour changing neutral current ( fcnc ) processes .",
    "in particular decays with suppressed sm amplitudes , that could interfere with significant non - sm amplitudes could be sensitive probes of new physics .",
    "there are a number of such channels , with interesting observables ranging from branching fractions and forward - backward asymmetries , to time - dependent cp asymmetry parameters discussed in ref .",
    "one particular example that is a golden channel for is @xmath12 . in order to observe these decays",
    "occurring at a sm rate , one needs to accumulate of the order of 75of data .",
    "with such an observation it would be possible to measure the branching fractions of both @xmath13 and @xmath14 , as well as the fraction of longitudinally polarised events @xmath15 in the latter mode . an experiment with a smaller data sample",
    "would not be able to measure all of these observables .",
    "the corresponding constraint obtained on the new physics parameters @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) are shown in figure  [ fig : bevan : snunubar ] .    while many of the measurements at will focus on detailed studies of cp violation",
    ", one should not neglect the possibility that cpt is violated .",
    "this symmetry , while conserved in the sm as a result of the intrinsic lorentz structure of the model , can be violated in scenarios beyond the sm , for example  @xcite .",
    "will be able to produce more stringent constraints on cpt in @xmath18 oscillations than previous experiments , reaching a precision of @xmath19 per mille on the real and imaginary parts of the cpt violating mixing parameter @xmath20 .",
    "in addition to the aforementioned searches for new physics , one should also recall that it will be possible to perform precision tests of the ckm mechanism using both direct and indirect constraints on the unitarity triangle .",
    "the observables accessible to a super flavour factory include several different measurements of all of the angles ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath7 ) , @xmath23 , @xmath24 ) = ( @xmath22 , @xmath21 , @xmath7 ) may also found in the literature . ] , as well as measurements of @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 . no other type of flavour experiment is able to perform such a set of measurements .",
    "for this reason , both and will provide powerful set of precision constraints on the description of cp violation and quark mixing in the sm . ref .",
    "@xcite contains more details on this part of the physics programme .",
    "the discovery of mixing in neutral @xmath10 mesons has a profound implication on the phenomenology of charm decays . as with neutral kaons and @xmath4 mesons , the establishment of mixing , which is interesting in its own right , also brings the potential for many new cp violating observables to be studied at future experiments .",

    "one advantage of studying charm decays at low energy is the relative lack of background , when compared to data accumulated at a higher energy resonance such as the .",
    "this is clearly manifest through the competitiveness of cleoc in a number of measurements of charm decays , when compared to the results from and on a number of branching fraction and decay constant measurements .",
    "the combination of kinematic constraint , tagged @xmath10 mesons , and a clean experimental environment make the @xmath2 a versatile laboratory to test many aspects of the sm and search for new physics .",
    "ever since the @xmath4 factories established mixing in the @xmath6 system , the possibility of utilising quantum correlations at charm threshold ( the @xmath2 resonance ) for time - dependent measurements has been a possibility .",
    "the physics sensitivity to cp asymmetries at charm threshold is under investigation .",
    "measurements of strong phases in dalitz decays at will play a significant role in reducing theoretical uncertainties in the measurements of @xmath7 and charm mixing at super flavour factories and .",

    "more details of the @xmath5 physics programme at can be found in ref .",
    "while the majority of new physics searches at concentrate on the potential for an indirect discovery , there is a class of light new particles that may be directly manifest in the data .",
    "these are light scalar particles that either fall into the category of a light dark matter candidate , or a light higgs particle  @xcite .",
    "dark matter could be light , and have gone undetected by experiments so far , if it couples weakly to the @xmath39 .",
    "many extensions of the sm introduce several higgs particles , and in extensions to mssm it is possible for some of these to be lighter than twice the @xmath54 mass . thus searches for both light dark matter ( with masses less than about 5 gev ) and light higgs particles at are essential in order to constrain their possible existence .    in addition to direct searches for manifestations of dark matter , it is possible to indirectly search for possible evidence of so - called dark force , with an associated hidden sector  @xcite .",
    "this concept has recently emerged , and is rapidly evolving field that is being tested by data from both astro - particle and particle physics experiments . in this model",

    "the dark photon can then decay into sm particles , and if the mass of the @xmath55 is below twice the mass of the proton , then @xmath55 is expected to decay into di-@xmath57 , @xmath58 , or @xmath59 final states . as with light higgs , and light dark matter",

    "these studies commenced with belle s discovery of the x(3872 )  @xcite , and a second boost to this activity was initiated by the discovery of the y(4260 ) in the study of @xmath60 using isr data at  @xcite .",

    "other outstanding issues range from simply confirming the existence of a particle , as is the case of the recently observed @xmath61  @xcite to determining their underlying nature . by understanding the underlying nature of some of these particles",
    ", one could make significant steps forward in our understanding of qcd , and in testing the framework of lattice qcd .",
    "there are a vast number of observables that will be measured at in @xmath4 , @xmath10 , @xmath5 , @xmath62 decays , as well as using other light mesons and baryons .",
    "measurements of rare decays , that are loop , or flavour changing neutral current ( fcnc ) dominated can be used to constrain many different types of new physics . in analogy to the way that fcncs have shaped our understanding of the sm , these will shape understanding of new physics models .",
    "precision tests of cp conjugate processes probe phase information of the ckm mechanism in the quark sector . in the charged lepton sector",
    "one is able to constrain possible lfv through searches for forbidden transitions in @xmath5 decays .",
    "the common coupling of charged leptons , irrespective of species , in the sm has been tested with some precision already in a number of possible ways .",
    "studies of light mesons , including @xmath62 decays to di - lepton final states can be used to increase the precision of these constraints and further test the validity of this symmetry .",
    "our physical framework is built upon the concept of lorentz invariance , and recently there have been attempts to go beyond this constraint in order to understand high energy theories such as quantum gravity .",
    "a consequence of lorentz invariance is the conservation of the cpt symmetry .",
    "this symmetry can be tested in @xmath4 , @xmath10 , and @xmath5 decays at , to complement the tests planned and already performed at the previous generation of @xmath4 factories , and in the kaon system through experiments such as cp - lear , kloe , and kloe-2 .",
    "if a cpt violation signal were to be found , this could have profound impact on our understanding of the foundations of physics .",
    "similarly any positive result of a direct search for dark matter candidates would have a profound impact on the understanding of both particle and astro - particle physics .    ultimately if no deviations from the sm are found in data collected at",
    ", then we shall be no closer to understanding the nature of new physics at high energy .",
    "however this outcome is not is not a bleak one , as a number of erroneous theories may have been ruled out by measurement , and any remaining candidate theory of new physics would be strongly constrained by those very measurements found to be compatible with the sm . in turn",
    "would have performed a precision test of the electroweak and flavour sectors of the sm .",
    "considering the sm confirmation scenario , it is worth noting that this is the most versatile experiment proposed to perform precision tests of the ckm mechanism .",
