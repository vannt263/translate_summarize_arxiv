    "interference between processes with different weak phases contributing to a same final state can generate an asymmetry in charge conjugate @xmath6 meson decays .",
    "the most established methods to extract the ckm phases exploits the interference between the phases generated in the @xmath2 @xmath7 oscillation and the phase of the decay of these particles in the same final state . using such approaches on the @xmath8 decay",
    ", the ckm @xmath9 angle is measured to a good precision . however , the other two ckm angles , @xmath10 and @xmath0 , retain sizable uncertainties , due to both experimental and theoretical difficulties .",
    "lhc should determine @xmath0 to @xmath11 in one year of data taking@xcite .",
    "any asymmetry observed in charge conjugated @xmath12 decays is interpreted as a manifestation of the ckm phases . in the two body decay scenario , direct @xmath13 asymmetry ( @xmath14 )",
    "was established by the experiments babar @xcite and belle @xcite by simply counting the difference in number of events of the @xmath15 and @xmath16 decays . in three body",
    "@xmath12 meson decays , babar and belle @xcite claim the observation of direct @xmath14 in the channel @xmath17 measured through the amplitude analysis of the final state @xmath1 .",
    "they see a difference in the decay fractions among the intermediate states in the @xmath18 and @xmath19 samples .",
    "that is the difference between the square of the fitted amplitude for the intermediate state integrated on the phase space .",
    "this quantity is a straightforward application of the two body strategy into the three body decays , including the requirement of a strong phase difference to observe @xmath14 .    beyond the fraction asymmetry quoted by belle and babar",
    ", one could explore the asymmetry associated with the interference among two intermediate states , i.e. the interference between two neighbor resonances decaying to the same three body final state . as will be discussed in detail in section iii , whenever the phase difference between two resonant amplitudes involves the weak phase",
    ", one should expect to see @xmath14 in the interference terms of the dalitz plot distribution .",
    "this contribution to the asymmetry depends only on the existence of a weak phase difference and it can be observed even in situations where there is no strong phase difference .",
    "there are a lot of opportunities for investigation of the asymmetry in the dalitz plot distribution rather than difference in the decay fractions alone@xcite .",
    "the idea of extracting @xmath0 exploring the dalitz interference among intermediate amplitudes in three body @xmath12 decays was initially proposed for @xmath20 @xcite , where @xmath21 plays a fundamental role as reference channel . however , the method is statistically limited by the low contribution of the cabibbo suppressed amplitude @xmath22 @xcite , and also estimated through the already observed cabibbo allowed @xmath23 channel @xcite . recently",
    ", a new effort has been made to study @xmath0 in @xmath24 decays , however this approach requires time - dependent analysis @xcite , having to deal with tagging inefficiencies that could be as large as 90% at lhcb @xcite .",
    "we present a new possibility to measure the ckm @xmath0 angle , through the interference terms in the amplitude analysis of three body @xmath12 decays .",
    "the method combines the experimental data from @xmath1 and @xmath2 , @xmath3 . from the charged @xmath25",
    "decays we have the _ penguin _ amplitude coefficient and phase of the channel @xmath26 .",
    "we then use this result in an untagged analysis of the neutral system , to extract the _ tree _ component strong phase and amplitude coefficient and the weak phase @xmath0 .",
    "the method is based on the ability to measure independently the relative amplitudes and phases for @xmath2 and @xmath7 decays in a joint untagged sample .",
    "the standard amplitude analysis , extensively used in non - leptonic three body heavy quark meson decays , is based on the isobaric model . in these analyses , the two body resonant intermediate state amplitudes",
    "are represented by breit - wigner functions multiplied by angular distributions associated with the spin of the resonance .",
    "the various contributions are combined in a coherent sum with complex coefficients that are extracted from maximum likelihood fits to the data .",
    "the absolute value of the coefficients , normally refereed to as magnitudes , are related to the relative fraction of each intermediate state and the phase takes into account rescattering or the final state interaction ( fsi ) between the resonance and the bachelor particle .",
    "this phase is considered constant because it depends only on the total energy of the system , i.e. the heavy meson mass .",
    "the presence of strong final state constant phases can be directly revealed through the interference between two different amplitudes .",
    "thus , the total isobaric amplitude , written as functions of the dalitz plot variables , @xmath27 and @xmath28 is :    @xmath29    the fit parameters are the coefficient magnitudes , @xmath30 , and the phases , @xmath31 . the non - resonant amplitude , @xmath32 is usually represented by a constant .",
    "each resonant amplitude , @xmath33 , is written as a product of three terms :    @xmath34    the first term are the blatt - weisskopf damping factors @xcite .",
    "@xmath35 is a term which accounts for angular - momentum conservation and depends on the spin , @xmath36 , of @xmath37 the resonance , such that it is 1 for a spin-0 , @xmath38 for spin-1 , and @xmath39 for spin-2 , in the case of the resonance formed by the pair of particles * 1 * and * 3*. @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the the 3-momentum of particles * 2 * and * 3 * , and @xmath42 is the angle between particles * 2 * and * 3 * , all measured in the resonance rest frame .",
    "the last term is a relativistic breit - wigner function given by :    @xmath43    where @xmath44 is the resonance mass and @xmath45 is the mass dependent width .",
    "the relative contribution of each intermediate state is given by fractions defined as :    @xmath46    where @xmath47 is related to the total number of events of the non - leptonic three body heavy meson decay .",
    "one important feature of the dalitz plot associated with the interference between two neighboring resonances is that there will be an @xmath14manifestation , independent of the strong phase differences . to illustrate this point ,",
    "let us develop a simple example of two resonant scalar amplitudes , interfering in a particular region at the three body decay phase space .",
    "suppose one of the resonant amplitudes , @xmath49 , has a _ tree _ component , with magnitude * @xmath50 * and strong phase * @xmath51 * and weak phase @xmath0 , plus a _ penguin _ contribution with * @xmath52 * and * @xmath53 * and no weak phase , interfering with another resonant amplitude , @xmath54 , with magnitude and phase * @xmath55 * and * @xmath56 * and the absence of weak phase .",
    "the charge conjugate total decay amplitudes are :    @xmath57    \\mathcal{a}_1 + a_r e^{i \\delta_r } \\mathcal{a}_r \\\\ a^- = [ a_t e^{i ( \\delta_t - \\gamma ) } + a_p e^{i \\delta_p } ]    \\mathcal{a}_1 + a_r e^{i \\delta_r } \\mathcal{a}_r \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    and    @xmath58    from equation 7 , we see that the first term has a similar behavior as the two body decays , i.e. @xmath14depends on the magnitude of the _ tree _ component and also on the phase difference @xmath59 , which must be non zero for @xmath14to be observable . this is the term responsible for the @xmath14quoted through the difference in integrated fractions made by babar and belle @xcite @xcite .",
    "however the presence of second or third terms , the interference ones , depends only on the magnitude of the _ tree _ component , since the phase difference has a sine form associated with the real part of the bw s product , but also a cosine component associated with the imaginary part of the bw s product .",
    "so the interference will always produce @xmath14provided that the magnitude associated with the weak phase is significant .",
    "interferences in the dalitz plot do not allow to associate directly the fraction , defined in eq .",
    "4 , with the number of events in a intermediate state channel .",
    "the relative phase between two amplitudes sharing the same phase space region can produce destructive or constructive interferences , decreasing or increasing the number of events in the three body final sample , in which case we lose deterministic information of the source of the events in the region . due this difficulty to the concept of the direct @xmath14to the three body decays , the asymmetry observed from fractions would be better refered as _ quasi - direct _",
    "@xmath14 .",
    "the direct @xmath14 in the three body decays , in the sense of event counting , would be more conveniently defined by the notion of two asymmetries , one local and one global .",
    "a global @xmath14is the difference between the total number of events of two conjugate three body decays .",
    "the local would be the difference in the number of events depending on the dalitz variables @xmath60 .",
    "in general , the global asymmetry loses part of dynamics information , since it is the integral over the phase space . on the other hand ,",
    "local asymmetry accounts for the difference of the magnitude square , or the first term of equation 7 , and also the asymmetry coming from the interference terms among two resonances , or the last terms of equation 7 .    the local cp asymmetry of the charged b meson three body decay can be defined through the subtraction of the two dalitz surfaces relative to the charged conjugated b signals :    @xmath61    we call @xmath48 the local asymmetry at the dalitz plot , with @xmath62 being the number of events in @xmath27 , @xmath63 .    for the neutral systems with @xmath2 and @xmath64 decaying to the same final state , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 for example , burdman and donoghue @xcite propose a convenient definition of local @xmath48 .",
    "they showed that for a decay with @xmath68 , the asymmetry is time independent and can be written as :    @xmath69    a measure of local @xmath48 is obtained by comparing the number of events in points of the dalitz plot symmetrical with respect to the diagonal line @xmath70 .    to quantify the total amount of asymmetry present in a three body decay",
    ", one can compute the sum of the modulus of @xmath48 , taking in account properly statistical fluctuations .",
    "we now introduce a new possibility to measure @xmath0 , based on a time - independent analysis of @xmath71 decays .",
    "the most relevant observed intermediate states for @xmath72and @xmath73 @xcite , are summarised in table [ tab : bkpipicontrib ] with the respective _ tree _ and _ penguin _ contributions , and ckm weak phases contained in the amplitude .",
    ".resonances and dominant contributions from @xmath74 decays .",
    "we denote allowed , suppressed by color and _ penguin _ amplitudes by @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as stated in section iv , the first step of the method would be to solve the charged mode dalitz plot , from which hypothesis 1 could be tested .",
    "the parameters @xmath52 and @xmath53 would then be input to the neutral system fit . since charged mode analysis presents no novelty and the statistical errors",
    "are expected to be low compared to the neutral decays we skip this step for this study .",
    "each 100k event sample of @xmath2 plus @xmath5 generated with the amplitudes and phases listed in the column input of table [ tab : viabilidade ] were fitted with an unconstrained model with just three parameters fixed . in the last column of table [",
    "tab : viabilidade ] we display the central values of the gaussian distributions of the 100 experiment s fit result and the errors are the width of the same gaussian distribution .",
    "the total number of events of each @xmath2 and @xmath5 is the result of the integration of either amplitude within the dalitz plot .",
    "the fact that the @xmath21 magnitude for @xmath5 is measured to be equal to the fixed @xmath78 is the test for hypothesis 3 .",
    "the extracted quantities are in agreement with the generated ones and with small errors , stating the feasibility of the joint fit method .",
    "using the parameters from table [ tab : viabilidade ] and the relations developed in section iv , we measure @xmath79 .    if in the unconstrained analysis , the three hypotheses prove to be correct , we can reduce the numbers of free parameters assuming that the @xmath80 resonances parameters from @xmath2 and @xmath5 are given by the following _ tree _ and _ penguin _ sum : @xmath81    instead of fitting for @xmath82 and @xmath83 , we fit for @xmath84 and @xmath0 since we can fix @xmath85 from @xmath1 result .",
    "this way , constraining the fit with the hypothesis previously tested we reduce the error in @xmath0 .",
    "we measure with the constrained hypothesis , @xmath86 and also we obtained for the ratio between the _ tree _ and _ penguin _ component @xmath87 .",
    "we discussed some aspects of the search of @xmath14 in three body b decays , emphasising the main characteristic of these decays , which is the interference among two neighbor resonances in the dalitz plot .",
    "in particular , we discuss how the ckm @xmath0 phase can be extracted applying the isobar model@xcite , extensively used in many charm meson three body decay amplitude analysis .",
    "we showed that the phase differences , coming from the amplitude analysis , can provide richer information than treating the three body decays as a straightforward extension of two body hadronic decays .",
    "we showed that if there is a weak phase difference between two intermediate state , @xmath14will be present in the dalitz plot regardless of the strong phase difference .",
    "we presented a method to extract the ckm @xmath0 angle using a combined dalitz plot analysis from @xmath1 and @xmath88 .",
    "this method use three basic hypothesis that can be tested before one proceeds to the constrained fit .",
    "for measuring the @xmath12 neutral analysis , we use a new technique of joint fit that allows us to extract , in an independent way , the amplitudes from two summed surfaces in a joint sample of @xmath89 untagged events .",
    "we carried a simplified fast mc study to estimate the errors associated to the joint fit technique . assuming a relatively low statistics for the anchor resonance @xmath21 we obtained @xmath0 with a @xmath90 error .    during the analysis",
    "we can measure cp violation by counting the number of events from @xmath2 and @xmath5 , information extracted in the joint fit , or exploring dalitz symmetries as discussed in @xcite .",
    "we can also measure the ratio and phase difference from tree and _ penguin _ amplitudes of the @xmath80 resonance , defining which theoretical approach , factorisable or non - factorisable , is more adequate .",
    "the method presented here is competitive with the other approaches to determine the ckm @xmath0 angle @xcite and needs the high statistics expected for the lhcb experiment , due to the small contribution of the reference channel @xmath91 .",
    "however , in the case that the @xmath92 resonance is dominated by the @xmath93 component @xcite , or even if the ratio between the tree and _ penguin _ is negligible @xcite , the @xmath94 amplitude could take the place of the charmonium as a reference channel in the analysis .",
