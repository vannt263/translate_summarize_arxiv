    "over the last several years , extrasolar planets have been discovered through precision doppler velocity surveys ( c.f .",
    "marcy & butler 2000 ) .",
    "butler et al ( 1999 ) reported the first evidence for a multiple planetary system around the f8v star @xmath1 andromedae .",
    "though the combined m sin@xmath2 values for these three planets implied a mass at least 5 times more than the combined mass of the planets in our own solar system , this discovery was heralded as the first evidence that our own system of planets is not unique .",
    "currently , there are seven systems of multiple planets known , and all are around apparent single stars like our own sun .",
    "during the course of our standardized search for wide companions to stars within 25 pc of the sun , we discovered a stellar companion to @xmath1 andromedae ( @xmath3hd9826:gl 61 ; 01:36:47.98 @xmath441:24:23.0,v@xmath34.10 , d@xmath313.5pc ) at an apparent projected separation of @xmath0750au . in this paper",
    "we present astrometry and spectroscopy to confirm its companionship and discuss the possible influence this secondary might have on the planetary system .",
    "finding companions at wide separations ( @xmath5 few hundred au ) involves searching large pieces of the sky around the nearest stars .",
    "the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ; skrutskie et al .",
    "1997 ) is currently presenting a wealth of new material with which previously unknown low - luminosity companions can be found at wide separations .",
    "we are in the middle of a 2mass - based survey around all stars within the third catalogue of nearby stars ( cns3 ; gliese & jahreiss 1991 ) for possible companions out to separations of 0.1 pc .",
    "the cns3 includes some 3800 stars believed to lie within 25 pc of the sun .",
    "companions that are m , l and t dwarfs will have red optical - to - near - ir colors ( r - j ) .",
    "optical photometry from the usno - a catalog , which is paired up with 2mass data during routine 2mass data processing , can be used for an appropriate color constraint .",
    "our candidates are 2mass detections within a search radius equivalent to a physical separation of 0.1 pc around the nearby star that either have no optical counterparts or have very red @xmath6 colors .",
    "confirmation of companionship and classification are then found by astrometric and spectroscopic follow - up , respectively .",
    "several stellar and substellar companions to nearby , main sequence stars have been found in this manner ( kirkpatrick et al 2001a,2001b ; wilson et al 2001 ; gizis , kirkpatrick & wilson 2001 ) , and the search has been standardized around all nearby stars to provide more robust statistics on the frequency of brown dwarf companions to stars .    during our search",
    ", we uncovered a candidate in proximity to the bright , nearby f8v star @xmath1 and .",
    "the candidate companion , 2massi j0136504@xmath4412332 , has infrared flux and colors ( j@xmath39.39@xmath70.03 ; j@xmath8k@xmath30.88 ) consistent with a mid m dwarf ( kirkpatrick & mccarthy 1994 ) at the distance of @xmath1 and .",
    "as shown in figure 1 , it lies 55@xmath9 from @xmath1 and at a position angle of 147@xmath10 .      the hipparcos mission ( perryman et al 1997 ) measured @xmath1 and to have the proper motion of @xmath11 -172.57@xmath70.52 and @xmath12 -381.03@xmath70.45 mas per year . from positions measured in the poss - i and poss - ii digitized images and 2mass ( table 1 ) , we find the candidate companion to have a proper motion over a 44.5 year baseline of @xmath11 -175@xmath78 and @xmath12 -390@xmath76 mas per year .",
    "since the two objects @xmath13 s agree to within 1 @xmath14 and the @xmath15 s within 2 @xmath14 , we conclude they have the same proper motion within the errors .",
    "we therefore conclude that this object , hereafter referred to as @xmath1 and b , is a common proper motion companion to the brighter star , which we will refer to as @xmath1 and a. the known radial velocity planets @xmath1 and b , @xmath1 and c , and @xmath1 and d orbit the brighter star @xmath1 and a. we note that if planetary and stellar companions are discovered in the same system , confusion can be avoided if stellar objects are noted with a capital letter , and planets noted with a lowercase letter .",
    "the companion was observed spectroscopically on 26 jul 2001 ut using the double spectrograph ( oke & gunn 1982 ) on the hale 200 in telescope at palomar observatory .",
    "the instrumental setup used the blue grating of 300 lines / mm and the red grating of 316 lines / mm with the 2@xmath160 slit to provide a wavelength coverage from 5200 to 9100   at a resolution of 9  .",
    "observations were reduced using standard techniques following kirkpatrick , henry , & mccarthy ( 1991 ) and flux calibrated using the standard star ltt 9491 ( hamuy et al 1994 ) .",
    "the spectrum is plotted in figure 2 and compared with spectral standards from kirkpatrick et al ( 1991 ) . the companion s spectrum is best fit by the m4.5v standard s spectrum . based upon the spectral - type mass relation for late f stars ( cox 2000,p .",
    "382 ) , we estimate @xmath1 and a has a mass of @xmath0 1.2 m@xmath17 , and using the spectral - type mass relationship of henry & mccarthy ( 1993 ) , we estimate a mass of 0.2 m@xmath17 for @xmath1 and b.",
    "the radial velocity monitoring group of marcy , butler and colleagues excluded binaries only if their separations were less than 2@xmath9 ( g. marcy , 2002 pers comm ) , so this system would still have been monitored had the companion been previously known . for @xmath1 and a , butler et al ( 1999 ) report a measured rms velocity semiamplitude of 15.1 m s@xmath18 , after extracting the three planetary orbits from the measurements .",
    "we calculate a 0.2 m@xmath17 stellar companion at 750 au would have a period of @xmath0 20000 yrs and a velocity amplitude of k @xmath0 100 m s@xmath18 depending on the eccentricity and inclination of the orbit",
    ". however , the maximum radial velocity _ change _ butler et al might have measured over their 11 year baseline would be a much smaller value , @xmath0 0.4 m s@xmath18 ( for i=60 and e=0.5 ) .",
    "for a highly eccentric ( e=0.9 ) orbit , it could reach as large as 0.9 m s@xmath18 .",
    "even so , this companion object would have not been detectable in the radial velocity measurements .",
    "since the announcement of the multiple planets around @xmath1 and a , there have been many theoretical models of the evolution and stability of three planets around a single star . while the inner planet is a typical close , hot jupiter with a small eccentricity ( 0.04 ) , the eccentricities of the outer two increase to 0.18 and 0.41 , respectively .",
    "interaction between the two outer planets has been proposed as the major influence of orbital evolution , but there has been much debate over the stability of such a system .",
    "rivera & lissauer ( 2000 ) , who , like laughlin & adams ( 1999 ) , ignore the innermost planet in the numerical simulations , found co - planar systems can be stable on small timescales , but the cause of the high eccentricities does not seem easily explained by only planetary interactions ( jiang & ip 2001 ) .    what influence would a distant stellar companion have on the orbits of a planetary system ? in the numerical models of the stabilty of planets within binary systems , holman & weigert ( 1999 ) found certain critical semimajor axes for which disruption of the orbit could occur , depending on the eccentricity of the binary stars .",
    "for the @xmath1 and system , the critical orbital radii range from approximately 40au to 240au for e=0.8 - 0.0 , respectively . while the known radial velocity planets are all well within this limit , we note that a circumprimary disk or remnant kuiper - belt could be disrupted by this companion , depending on its inclination and eccentricity . in the hd 141569 disk",
    ", it has been suggested that the outer gap observed in the debris disk could have its origin in gravitational perturbations caused by distant companions ( weinberger et al 2000 ) .",
    "another radial velocity planet with a highly eccentric orbit ( e@xmath30.63 ) is 16 cygni bb .",
    "it has been suggested that its high eccentricity might be due to interaction with the stellar companion , 16 cygni a , at a projected separation of 800 au ( mazeh , krymolowski & rosenfeld 1997 ; holman , touma , & tremaine 1997 ) .",
    "the tidal force of the secondary upon the smaller body was proposed to induce a modulation of the eccentricity over a long time scale ( @xmath010@xmath19yr ) .",
    "this would cause a planetary orbit that forms with a small eccentricity to slowly increase its eccentricity over the current age of the star ( @xmath0 3 gyr ) .",
    "they calculate the total increase is only weakly sensitive to the semimajor axis ratio if the period of the modulation is long , and therefore can be a large effect over the lifetime of that system .",
    "the projected separation of the 16 cygni binary is consistent with the projected separation we find here ( 750 au ) , though @xmath1 and b is approximately 0.4 the mass of 16 cygni a. however , the presence of multiple planets in the @xmath1 and system rules out the kind of effect noted above since the apsidal precession rate of the planets due to mutual interactions greatly outweighs any induced by the stellar companion ( chiang & murray 2002 ) . just as the moon , because of its proximity , has a larger effect on the terrestrial tides than the more massive but more distant sun , the mutual interaction of the planets @xmath1 and c and @xmath1 and d is much larger than any tidal forces from distant @xmath1 and b.",
    "we present astrometric and spectroscopic evidence that 2massi j0136504 + 412332 is a m4.5v common proper motion companion to the star @xmath1 and , which harbors a multiple planetary system .",
    "this represents the first system in which multiple planets exist within a multiple stellar system , but such a scenario might not be rare .",
    "there are residual velocity trends hinting of the presence of more than one planet around the binary stars 55 cnc and @xmath20 boo ( fischer et al 2001 ) .",
    "there are currently only single planets known around the multiple stars 16 cyg b , 94 cet , hd 142 , hd 179811b , hd 80606 , hd 195019 , gl 86 , and hd 89774 .",
    "unifying all aspects of extra - solar planetary formation and evolution into a consistent model that accounts for the distribution of known orbital parameters remains a daunting task .",
    "previously unknown stellar or substellar companions might be gravitationally affecting the entire system .",
    "the complete picture surely includes several factors including disk viscosities , planetary interactions , and companions .",
