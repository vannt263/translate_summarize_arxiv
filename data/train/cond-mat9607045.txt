    "exchange - correlation potentials and energies , of varying degrees of accuracy , have been determined by generating a density for the system of interest and then computing an exchange - correlation potential that yields the desired density as the ground state solution for the fictitious non - interacting system . in this context",
    ", researchers have used charge densities calculated by quantum chemistry methods for atoms   and molecules  @xcite , as well as quantum monte carlo methods for atoms  @xcite and for a model semiconductor  @xcite . the subsequent inverse problem ,",
    "namely the search of the corresponding exchange - correlation potential , has been performed using a variety of different techniques .",
    "for example , the exchange - correlation potential has been determined by expanding it in a set of basis functions and varying the expansion coefficients to reproduce the accurate density  @xcite .    with the exception of two - electron systems ,",
    "these accurate exchange - correlation potentials have never been separated into their exchange and correlation components according to the density functional theory definition . for many - electron systems ,",

    "for the special case of two electrons in a singlet state , the separation of the exchange - correlation potential into exchange plus correlation is quite simple since the exchange potential is simply given by the condition that it cancels the self - interaction term in the hartree potential .",
    "on the other hand , for many - electron systems , this decomposition into exchange and correlation components has never been done . in previous work",
    "@xcite , the exchange potential was defined as the difference of the effective kohn - sham potential yielding the hartree - fock density and the sum of the hartree and the external potentials .",
    "the correlation potential was then obtained as the difference of the exchange - correlation potential corresponding to the exact density and the above approximate exchange potential .",
    "note that this `` exchange '' potential is not an exchange - correlation potential since we are subtracting the wrong external potential : the hartree - fock density is the true ground state density for a hamiltonian with an external potential different than the original one .",
    "however , it is also not the exchange potential corresponding to the hartree - fock density ( although very close to it ) since it is not the functional derivative with respect to the density of the exchange energy evaluated for the orbitals obtained from the effective potential yielding the hartree - fock density .",
    "therefore , this separation scheme is incorrect : it involves two densities , the exact and the hartre - fock densities , and , moreover , the potential used for exchange is only approximately equal to the exchange potential corresponding to the hartree - fock density .",
