    "the @xmath0 observations continued over the next @xmath6  hr .",
    "launched on 1990 june 1 , @xmath0 carried two co - aligned instruments , an x - ray telescope and the wide field camera ( sims et  al .",
    "1990 ) covering the euv waveband . after an initial 6-month survey phase a programme of pointed observations began , continuing until the mission terminated in february 1999 .",
    "most observations with the @xmath1 were conducted through one of two broad - band filters , s1 which covered the range 60@xmath12140 ( 90@xmath12200  ev ) , and s2 which covered 112@xmath12200 ( 60@xmath12110  ev ) .",

    "since the field of view of the @xmath1 is much greater than that of the x - ray instrument in use at the time ( the high resolution imager ) , it was not seen by that telescope ( the @xmath1 has a field of view @xmath15 in diameter , the hri @xmath16 ) .",
    "the observation lasted for @xmath6  hr , although sw uma was not observed continuously due to various observing constraints ( e.g.  earth occultation , passage through radiation belts , scheduling of other astronomical targets ) .",

    "however , it was marginally ( @xmath18 ) detected during the @xmath1 all - sky survey , in the s1 filter , when it was also in quiescence .",
    "wheatley ( 1995 ) measured the survey count rate at 0.0075 count  s@xmath5 ( 68% confidence range 0.0044@xmath120.011 count  s@xmath5 ) .",
    "the system has been observed once before in the euv / soft x - ray regime during superoutburst , by @xmath19 during march 1986 ( szkody , osborne and hassall 1988 ) . on that occasion ,",
    "it was detected by the low energy detector le1 s 3000 lexan filter ( 0.05@xmath122.0 kev ) and also in the al / p filter ( 0.04@xmath120.08 , 0.13@xmath121.8 kev ) , but not by the medium energy me detector .",

    "note that in the optical the plateau phase lasted for @xmath20  days , during which the brightness declined steadily from a peak of m@xmath11 to m@xmath21 .",

    "]    the source was brightest in the euv at the start of the @xmath1 observation , at a count rate of @xmath4 count s@xmath5 , @xmath3  hr after the optical outburst had been first observed . at this point , it was the third brightest object in the euv sky between @xmath23 , after the steady white dwarf sources hz43",

    "hr the measured euv flux declined by a factor @xmath27 , in contrast to the optical brightness , which was essentially static but declined by no more than a factor @xmath28 .",
    "the euv flux then appeared to level out at @xmath29 count s@xmath5 .",
    "we have conducted a period search on the sw uma @xmath1 data , in particular to search for any evidence of the @xmath30 minute orbital period , @xmath31 minute `` superhump '' period , and other shorter periods such as a 15.9 minute optical period reported by shafter , szkody and thorstensen ( 1986 ) , which may be associated with the rotation period of the white dwarf .",
    "the data were binned in 30 second intervals for this analysis but the period search proved negative . a search for faster periods such as possible dwarf novae oscillations , using data",
    "binned at one second intervals , also proved negative .",
    "the rapid decline in the euv luminosity of sw uma so soon after rising to superoutburst is surprising .",
    "for example , the euv light curves of the dwarf novae u gem and ss cyg during normal outbursts follow the behaviour of the corresponding optical light curves throughout the optical plateau phase and during the subsequent rapid decline ( e.g  long et  al . 1996 , mauche 1998 ) .",
    "no rapid decline in the brightness of the euv light curve is seen so early in the outburst .",
    "however , similar behaviour to that seen here in sw  uma has been reported recently in the superoutburst euv light curve of the related su uma - type system oy  car ( mauche and raymond 2000 ) .",
    "this binary was observed for just over three days by the extreme ultraviolet explorer ( @xmath32 ) shortly after it went into superoutburst in march 1997 .",
    "the deep survey instrument light curve declined rapidly from a peak brightness of @xmath33 count s@xmath5 at the start of the observation , to @xmath34 count s@xmath5 after just @xmath28 days .",
    "the optical light curve declined much more slowly over the same period .",
    "then , perhaps more surprisingly , the euv brightness increased after @xmath27 days to @xmath35 count s@xmath5 ( see figure 2 of mauche and raymond 2000 ) .",
    "mauche and raymond draw comparisons to similar behaviour in the voyager fuv light curve of vw hyi in superoutburst ( polidan and holberg 1987 ) .",
    "an early euv / soft x - ray dip may also be present in that object s corresponding @xmath19 light curve ( pringle et  al .",
    "1987 ) .",
    "we now offer an explanation for the behaviour of the euv light curves of su  uma - type binaries during superoutburst , in terms of the interplay between the thermal and tidal instabilities which affect the accretion discs in these systems .",
    "we expand on the ideas put forward by mauche and raymond ( 2000 ) for the behaviour seen in oy car and vw hyi , and first discussed by osaki ( 1994 , 1995 ) .",
    "we assume that the decline in the wfc count rate represents a true decrease in the total euv flux . with observations in a single filter",
    "we can not rule out the possibility that the observed drop in count rate is instead due to a spectral variation ( e.g. a decrease in temperature ) , although we consider this unlikely .",
    "the lightcurves of su  uma systems show frequent , relatively short and weak normal outbursts interspersed by long , large amplitude superoutbursts .",
    "the normal outbursts are thought to arise because of a thermal - viscous driven disc instability due to the partial ionization of hydrogen ( see cannizzo 1993 for a review ) .",
    "each normal outburst only involves the accretion of a small fraction of the total disc mass onto the white dwarf .",
    "consequently , there is a gradual accumulation of mass and angular momentum in the disc . as a result",
    ", the outer disc radius expands until the tidal resonance radius is reached ( in systems with a mass ratio below @xmath36 , a resonance arises because of a 3:1 commensurability between the disc and binary frequencies , whitehurst and king 1991 ) . at this point",
    "the enhanced tidal interaction between the disc and the secondary star removes angular momentum from the outer disc and inhibits further evolution of the disc radius .",
    "osaki ( 1995 ) proposed that the superoutbursts of su  uma systems arise because of this thermal - tidal instability which spreads through the disc via a heating wave , on the short thermal timescale .",
    "the tidal interaction subsequently increases the mass accretion rate through the disc , triggering a superoutburst .",
    "the observed euv emission from an su  uma star in outburst is produced by the hot , inner regions of the accretion disc .",
    "once in outburst the surface density of the inner disc , and hence the resulting euv emission , will decay on the timescale @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the radius within the disc , @xmath39 is the shakura - sunyaev viscosity parameter , @xmath40 is the local sound speed and @xmath41 is the disc semi - thickness ( frank , king and raine 1992 ) .",
    "typical parameters of the inner disc in outburst ( @xmath42 cm , @xmath43 , @xmath44 km s@xmath5 , @xmath45 ) yield @xmath46 day .",
    "however , as outlined above , in a superoutburst the expansion of the accretion disc causes the tidal radius to be exceeded and the tidal instability to set in .",
    "the euv emission rate recovers when the inner disc is resupplied with mass as the tidal instability increases the mass transfer rate through the disc .",
    "we can estimate the timescale for the growth of the tidal instability from the delay between the time of super - maximum and the first appearance of superhumps in the optical light curve ( superhumps are small - amplitude modulations seen in the optical light curves during superoutburst , and are caused by the accretion disc becoming eccentric due to the action of the tidal instability ) .",
    "this timescale is between 3@xmath127 days in the case of sw  uma ( see warner 1995 , table 3.7 and references therein ) .",
    "so , if we associate the observed euv emission of sw  uma with viscous dissipation in the inner regions of the accretion disc we can understand the decline seen after super - maximum as the reduction in the surface density of the inner disc during outburst , with an expected e - folding time of @xmath47 day .",
    "we predict a subsequent rise in the euv flux after @xmath48 days , as the inner regions of the disc are re - supplied with mass by the action of the tidal instability , although none is seen in the data presented here since the rosat wfc observation ended @xmath47 day after the start of the optical superoutburst .",
    "the optical light curve remains approximately constant during this period as the optical emission of the accretion disc is dominated by its outer regions , where the surface density decays on a much longer timescale .",
    "the observations of oy  car by mauche and raymond are also in agreement with this picture .",
    "the euv light curve is seen to decay over 1.5 days , close to the viscous timescale of the inner disc , and recover after @xmath49 days ; the time between supermaximum and the first appearance of superhumps in the optical light curve in this system is @xmath50 days ( warner 1995 ) .",
    "we suggest that the behaviour seen here in the euv light curve of sw  uma , by mauche and raymond ( 2000 ) in oy  car , and possibly in the @xmath19 soft x - ray light curve of vw  hyi ( pringle et  al .",
    "1987 ) , is a common feature of superoutbursts in su  uma systems , compared with normal outbursts in u gem - like dwarf novae .",
    "the euv light curves can , therefore , provide both observational clues to the superoutburst mechanism and an observational means of discriminating between normal outbursts and superoutbursts in these systems .",
    "it is unfortunate that the last major mission observing the euv section of the electromagnetic spectrum , @xmath32 , has recently been terminated by nasa .",
    "no new observatories are planned for this waveband in the near future .      at peak brightness , at the start of the @xmath1 observation ,",
    "sw uma was the third brightest object in the euv sky between @xmath23 , and the fourth brightest object ever seen by the @xmath1 .",
    "the brightest was the euv transient re  j1255@xmath13266 , observed in 1994 june with the s2 filter at a peak degradation - corrected count rate of 76.5count  s@xmath5 ( dahlem et  al .",
    "watson et  al .",
    "( 1996 ) subsequently showed that re  j1255@xmath13266 was a wz  sge type cv system in outburst ( we discuss this outburst in more detail in the appendix ) .",
    "bright transient events have also been seen by @xmath32 .",
    "for example , u gem was one of the brightest objects in the euv sky during its 1993 december outburst when it was monitored by @xmath32 ( long et  al .",
    "the euv sky monitor @xmath51 has also observed a variety of transients , including cataclysmic variables in outburst , such as the su  uma - type binary vw hyi ( roussel - dupree and bloch 1996 ) . clearly , then , during outburst cataclysmic variable systems can provide some of the most intense sources of euv radiation in the sky . however",
    ", we also note that @xmath51 observed a number of shorter ( @xmath52 1  day ) transients of unknown origin and nature .",
    "these events could be previously unrecognised cvs or , for example , due to geocoronal stellar flares .",
    "we acknowledge the support of pparc for the @xmath0 project in the uk . this research has made use of data obtained from the leicester database and archive service ( ledas ) , operated by the dept . of physics and astronomy , leicester university ,",
    "uk , and from the simbad database operated by cds , strasbourg , france .",
    "in this research , we have used , and acknowledge with thanks , data from the aavso international database , based on observations submitted to the aavso by variable star observers worldwide .",
    "the exceptionally bright euv transient source re  j1255@xmath13266 was discovered by the @xmath0 @xmath1 in 1994 june during rapid exponential decline ( dahlem et  al .",
    "the @xmath1 count rate decreased exponentially over a period of four days , with an e - folding time of about one day .",
    "the rise was not covered , and the source was not detected in another @xmath1 observation eight days later , consistent with a continuing exponential decline .",
    "the outburst was not observed optically .",
    "watson et  al .",
    "( 1996 ) later identified the optical counterpart spectroscopically and concluded that it was probably a wz  sge - type cv system that had been in superoutburst ( wz  sge systems , a subset of the su  uma s , appear to show a strong preference for superoutbursts that last weeks , rather than normal outbursts which last for a few days ) .",
    "recently , though , wheatley , burleigh and watson ( 2000 ) have shown that the object was in quiescence just four days before the discovery observation , and concluded that this was most likely only a normal outburst of a wz  sge system .",
    "the superoutburst euv light curve of sw  uma ( figure 2 ) , together with the @xmath32 observation of oy  car discussed by mauche and raymond ( 2000 ) , now raises the possibility that the rapid euv decline of re  j1255@xmath13266 actually occured at the beginning of a much longer optical superoutburst .",
    "however , both sw  uma and oy  car show an euv decline for @xmath53  day , which then flattens off and possibly rises again . in rej1255@xmath13266",
    "the decline continued at a constant exponential rate for at least 4days and probably for more than 12days .",
    "we take this as further evidence that the outburst of re  j1255 + 266 detected by @xmath0 was probably a normal outburst of a wz  sge cv system , not a superoutburst ."
