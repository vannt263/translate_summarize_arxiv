    "in the early days of quantum mechanics , einstein and his colleagues designed a thought experiment @xcite intended to reveal what they believed to be inadequacies of quantum mechanics and they dreamed a causal world where no intrinsic randomness would present .",
    "bell showed that if experimenters enjoy complete free will in choosing measurement settings then quantum mechanics is indeed in contradiction with _ local realism _",
    "@xcite . later in @xcite , it has been shown that bell s locality condition can be thought of as a conjunction of two independent conditions namely outcome independence and parameter independence , popularly called no signaling , which restricts instantaneous communication between two spatially separated locations . in recent times , lots of interest",
    "have been found in simulating nonlocal correlations by violating these assumptions individually or collectively @xcite ; and in particular for singlet state correlation there exists several interesting simulation protocols @xcite .",
    "please note , in bell scenario any nonlocal correlation can be simulated by violating only the no signaling assumption ( i.e. allowing communication between two parties ) .",
    "moreover , for every such nonlocal correlation , there exists a different simulation protocol by violating only measurement independence condition .",
    "therefore in simulating bell nonlocal correlations there is no _ qualitative _ difference between these two simulation resources .",
    "interestingly , in this paper we show that this is not true in a more general situation called ` semi - quantum ' scenario which has been recently introduced in @xcite .",
    "we find that in semi - quantum scenario entangled quantum states reproduce correlations which can be simulated by reducing measurement independence but not possible by allowing communication .",
    "further we prove that such qualitative distinction between no signaling and measurement independence is absent in ` steering game ' scenario @xcite , a particular case of semi- quantum scenario .",
    "the bell game scenario @xcite involves two spatially separated players , say alice and bob .",
    "a referee picks indices @xmath0 and @xmath1 at random and sends them separately to alice and bob , respectively .",
    "the two players must compute answers @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively , and send the results to the referee , who will then pay them both .",
    "first , the players are told the rules of the game . knowing the rules , the players are allowed to agree on any strategy and to share any variable @xmath4 .",
    "the distribution @xmath5 of the shared variable @xmath6 must be independent of the referee s questions , say @xmath7 and @xmath8 ; otherwise the measurement independence assumption will be violated .",
    "after starting the game the two players are forbidden to communicate with each other .",
    "recently , f. buscemi has generalized the bell game into ` semi - quantum ' game @xcite . in this generalized scenario , instead of",
    "classical indices @xmath7 and @xmath8 referee sends quantum states @xmath9 and @xmath10 to alice and bob , respectively , without revealing the classical indices @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "here @xmath11 and @xmath12 be the hilbert spaces from where referee chooses input states for alice and bob , respectively .",
    "in general the set of quantum states @xmath13 and @xmath14 contain non orthogonal states . whenever referee chooses quantum states from a set of orthogonal states the situation turns out to be the bell game scenario . in between semi - quantum scenario and bell scenario another interesting situation has been considered in @xcite , namely ` steering game ' scenario . in steering game referee",
    "sends orthogonal quantum state @xmath15 to one party ( say alice ) and send quantum states @xmath16 ( in general non orthogonal ) to other party ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "recently , rosset _ et.al .",
    "_ proved a strong no - go result regarding simulation of correlations achieved in semi - quantum scenario @xcite .",
    "they have shown that any entangled state can generate correlations in such simulation task which can not be simulated by local operation assisted by classical communication ( locc ) @xcite even if there is no limitation on classical communication .",
    "such a strong no - go result is possible in semi - quantum scenario , as referee sends nonorthogonal quantum states to alice and bob , who will not be able to discriminate the states even if they are allowed to communicate with each other .",
    "interestingly , we show that a simulation protocol exists for such correlation if measurement independence assumption is reduced by suitable amount .     and",

    "c ) in _ steering game _ , alice is given orthogonal states @xmath17 whereas bob is given non - orthogonal states @xmath14.,width=302,height=302 ]",
    "in semi - quantum scenario the simulation task is defined via the 5-tuple @xmath19 ; where @xmath20 is the shared entangled state between the two players alice and bob , referee sends quantum inputs @xmath21 and @xmath22 to alice and bob respectively , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are positive - operator - valued - measure ( povm ) @xcite elements acting respectively on the composite quantum systems @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "consider the state @xmath20 of dimension @xmath27 , and alice and bob perform local measurements @xmath28 and @xmath29 with binary outcomes @xmath30 ; where the outcome @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) corresponds to the successful projection onto the maximally entangled state @xmath33 , i.e. @xmath34 the input states are chosen to have the same dimensions as the respective subsystem of a and b in @xmath20 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and constructed such that the corresponding density matrices @xmath37 , @xmath38 span the space of linear operators acting on @xmath39 and @xmath40 respectively . for more specific example of semi - quantum game",
    "let alice and bob share singlet states @xmath41 and consider that the referee chooses the quantum states from the vertices of a regular tetrahedron on the surface of the bloch sphere .",
    "using @xmath42 the vector of pauli matrices , and @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , we denote , for @xmath47 : @xmath48 the resulting correlations are then : @xmath49 the referee randomly chooses quantum states and sends to alice and bob who can share classical variable @xmath50 but the distribution of the classical variable does not depend on referee s input .",
    "as the input states are nonorthogonal alice and bob can not perfectly discriminate the states .",
    "moreover communications between alice and bob , even in infinite amount , have no use in discriminating those nonorthogonal input states . as a result",
    "no locc simulation protocol is possible for the correlation ( [ qicorre ] ) @xcite .",
    "interestingly , in the following section we show that to have a simulation protocol for the correlation ( [ qicorre ] ) alice and bob need not to know the referee s quantum input at all . rather using the correlation in the input states",
    "they can easily simulate the correlation-([qicorre ] ) if the distribution of the variable @xmath50 is made dependent on referee s inputs i.e. violating the measurement independence assumption .",
    "let alice and bob share hidden variable @xmath50 , taking @xmath51 distinct values @xmath52 .",
    "these variables are distributed according to one of two probability distributions @xmath53 and @xmath54 : + for @xmath55 @xmath56 and for @xmath57 @xmath58 the outcomes of alice and bob are fully determined by the parameter @xmath50 @xmath59 where , @xmath60 the corresponding correlations are of the form @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "it is clear that correlation ( [ simu ] ) is same as correlation ( [ qicorre ] ) .",
    "the lack of measurement independence required to reproduce the correlation ( [ qicorre ] ) can be quantified in several ways .",
    "measurement independence is the property that the distribution of the underlying variable is independent of the measurement settings or referee s input question , i.e. , @xmath64 bays theorem guarantees that is condition is equivalent to @xmath65 , which is often justified by the notion of experimental free will , i.e. , that experimenters can freely choose between different measurement settings irrespective of the underlying variable @xmath6 describing the system .",
    "the degree of measurement dependence is quantified by the variational distance @xcite @xmath66 clearly @xmath67 , where two extreme values signify complete measurement independence and complete measurement dependence , respectively .",
    "the fraction of measurement independence or free will is defined by @xmath68 thus , @xmath69 , with @xmath70 corresponding the case where no experimental free will can be enjoined and @xmath71 corresponding the case with complete experimental free will . for the above reduced free will model",
    "we have : @xmath72 and the amount of experimental free will is given by @xmath73 the degree of measurement dependence of the model can also be quantified by the mutual information between the labels sent by the referee and the shared variable @xmath50 which is defined as @xcite : @xmath74 maximizing the mutual information over all possible distributions of measurement settings the measurement dependence capacity @xcite of a given model can be obtained i.e. @xmath75 denote @xmath76 as the probability of sending the same label to alice and bob . then for our model the eq.([mu ] ) becomes @xmath77\\nonumber\\\\ - p h[p_{\\_sa(\\lambda ) } ] - ( 1-p ) h[p_{\\_di(\\lambda)}].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]     vs @xmath78 plot .",
    "the point @xmath79 correspond to maximum mutual information i.e. , _ measurement dependence capacity _ of the model ; and the point @xmath80 correspond to mutual information between the variable @xmath50 and @xmath81 when @xmath82 is uniform.,width=226,height=151 ]    from fig.[fig ] it is clear that measurement dependence capacity of our model turns out to be @xmath83 whereas for uniform distributions of measurement settings ( @xmath84 or @xmath85 ) the mutual information becomes @xmath86 .",
    "please note , distribution of the variable @xmath50 depends on referee s input in such a way ( eq.([distri_1 ] ) and eq.([distri_2 ] ) ) that having accesses the variable @xmath50 neither alice nor bob can guess the classical indices of their quantum states .",
    "actually @xmath50 does not contain any information about the individual quantum state send to alice or bob ; it only contains information about the correlation in the input states send to alice and bob and this is sufficient to provide the above simulation protocol .",
    "thus for correlation-([qicorre ] ) communication based simulation protocol is impossible while we provide a simulation protocol by sacrificing measurement independence . thus simulating the above quantum correlations ( correlation-([qicorre ] ) ) communication",
    "has no use while lack of measurement independence becomes useful ",
    "and hence it proves a qualitative distinction between no signaling and measurement independence ( or free will ) .",
    "our simulation model also makes it clear that the no - go result obtained in @xcite have been derived under free will assumption , which assumes no correlation between the referee s labels @xmath87 and any other physical parameter @xmath50 that propagates to the future ( and hence to alice and bob ) .",
    "this is a very strong assumption , and our result further shows that even a small amount of lack of measurement independence allows simulation of the correlations by non - quantum means without any need of communication .",
    "other than non - locality , a much discussed non classical feature of quantum mechanics is steering , first introduced by schrdinger @xcite and recently brought in attention by wiseman and his collaborators @xcite . in @xcite , cavalcanti _ et al .",
    "_ introduce the ` steering game ' as one of the interesting special case of semi - quantum game . in steering game",
    "the referee sends the orthogonal quantum states @xmath88 to one party ( say alice ) and sends quantum states @xmath10 ( in general non orthogonal ) to bob , without revealing the classical indices @xmath0 and @xmath1 . in the context of our work",
    "it is an interesting question whether in steering game scenario qualitative distinction between measurement independence and no signaling is possible .",
    "we answer this question in negation by providing a locc simulation protocol for all such steering games .    given the bipartite state @xmath89 shared between alice and bob , let us denote the set of all joint quantum conditional probabilities by @xmath90 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are classical results of alice and bob respectively that has to convey to the referee .",
    "@xmath91 is computed as : @xmath92,\\ ] ] where @xmath93 and @xmath94 . by @xmath95 , we denote the convex set of all @xmath96-povms on @xmath97 .    by simulation of the correlations @xmath98 , we mean that alice and bob are not allowed to share the state @xmath89 , but they have to reproduce the correlations in a given operational paradigm like losr or lossr or locc . now if the state @xmath89 is steerable then according to the result of cavalcanti _ et.al _ @xcite we know that @xmath98 can not be simulated by",
    "_ local operation with steering and shared randomness _ ( lossr ) resources and therefore by losr resources .",
    "interestingly if there allowed operational paradigm is locc then they will be succeed in the simulation task .      1 .",
    "bob locally prepares the state @xmath89 in his laboratory and takes another particle described by the hilbert space @xmath99 .",
    "2 .   receiving orthogonal quantum states @xmath15 s from referee , alice reveals the classical induces @xmath7 by performing von - newman measurement in @xmath17 basis .",
    "3 .   alice communicates her induces to bob by using @xmath100 bits , where @xmath101 be the cardinality of the set @xmath102 .",
    "4 .   receiving the information of alice s index @xmath7 , bob",
    "prepares the system @xmath103 in the state @xmath15 .",
    "5 .   receiving the quantum states",
    "@xmath16 s from referee , bob performs the required povm @xmath104 and @xmath105 and reproduces the joint conditional probability distributions @xmath106 .",
    "bob communicates the result @xmath107 to alice by using @xmath108 bits .",
    "note that , to perform the simulation task successfully , alice and bob require both way classical communications . if the simulation task demands that alice and bob have to reproduce the correlation only and",
    "does not further demand that the outcomes @xmath2 and @xmath3 have to be supplied to referee by the respective parties , then bob needs not communicate the result @xmath107 to alice .",
    "he sends both of the results @xmath107 and @xmath109 to referee himself and in this case one way communication ( @xmath100 bits from alice to bob ) suffices to complete the simulation task . to perform the simulation task",
    ", bob needs to have the resources in order to prepare the suitable bipartite state @xmath89 that exhibits steering . but this might be particularly relevant in a scenario where alice and bob want to pretend to be able to share such a state over long distances . in this scenario , they can reproduce the correlation without sharing the state and bob keeping it with him . actually by the above clever means , they will be able to preserve sufficient entanglement shared between them . thus following the above protocol",
    ", correlations achieved in all steering games can be simulated in locc operational framework with bounded amount of classical communication .",
    "one can also simulate such correlations without using communication but making the distribution of the classical variable @xmath50 dependent on the referee s input .",
    "thus in simulating correlations , achieved in steering game scenario , signaling and lack of measurement independence have same qualitative footing .",
    "experimental free will and no - signaling are two very important physically motivated assumptions . various important no - go results in quantum foundation have been derived under these assumptions . while bell s theorem @xcite and recently proved colebeck and renner s result @xcite consider both the assumptions , kochen - specker no - go result @xcite uses only free will assumption . in an interesting discussion @xcite of the measurement problem for a pr - box ,",
    "j. bub pointed out that , if bob has access to a parameter or ontic state @xmath6 which completely specifies the output values for both of his possible inputs , or even specifies whether these output values are the same or different , then either there is a violation of no - signaling principle or alices choice of input is not free but depends on the value of @xmath6 .",
    "actually bub s conclusion holds for any bell non - local correlation . in this paper",
    "we provide a simulation protocol with relaxed measurement independence for correlation achieved in a semi - quantum game whereas no simulation protocol involving only communication but no measurement dependence is possible for this correlations .",
    "thus our result proves that in ` semi - quantum ' scenario there exists correlation whose deterministic explanation is possible only if measurement independence assumption is relaxed and hence it establishes a qualitative distinction between no signaling and measurement independence .",
    "we further show that such distinction is not possible in steering game scenario . to prove the optimality of our model is an interesting open question .",
    "one may also get interested in constructing optimal reduced free will model for other semi - quantum games .",
