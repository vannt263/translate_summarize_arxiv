    "the aims of this paper are to provide a comprehensive derivation of a realistic effective quantum model for these spin - ice related materials and to understand its basic properties including nontrivial quantum effects .",
    "let us briefly review the classical ( spin ) ice .",
    "the low - energy properties of water and spin ices are described by ising degrees of freedom that represent whether proton displacements ( electric dipoles ) and magnetic dipoles , respectively , point inwards ( `` in '' ) to or outwards ( `` out '' ) from the center of the tetrahedron .",
    "the interaction among the ising variables favors nearest - neighbor pairs of `` in '' and `` out '' and thus suffers from geometrical frustration .",
    "this produces a so - called ice rule  @xcite stabilizing `` 2-in , 2-out '' configurations on each tetrahedron .",
    "macroscopic degeneracy of this ice - rule manifold produces pauling s residual entropy @xmath8  @xcite .    in the dipolar spin ice  @xcite",
    ", a rare - earth magnetic moment @xmath9 located at a vertex @xmath10 of tetrahedrons plays the role of the ising variable because of the large crystalline electric field ( cef ) , which is often _ approximately _ modeled by @xmath11 with the land factor @xmath12 and @xmath13 . here , @xmath14 is the quantum number for the total angular momentum @xmath15 , and @xmath16 defines a unit vector at a pyrochlore - lattice site @xmath10 that points outwards from the center of the tetrahedron belonging to one fcc sublattice of the diamond lattice and inwards to that belonging to the other sublattice .",
    "the amplitude of the rare - earth magnetic moment is so large that the interaction between the magnetic moments is dominated by the magnetic dipolar interaction  @xcite , @xmath17 ,    \\label{eq : h_d}\\ ] ] with @xmath18 and the summation @xmath19 over all the pairs of atomic sites .",
    "this yields a ferromagnetic coupling @xmath20  k between the nearest - neighbor magnetic moments for ho@xmath7ti@xmath7o@xmath4 and dy@xmath7ti@xmath7o@xmath4 with the moment amplitude @xmath21 and the lattice constant @xmath22    @xcite , providing a main driving force of the ice rule .",
    "it prevails over the nearest - neighbor superexchange interaction which is usually _ assumed _ to take the isotropic heisenberg form @xmath23 in the limit of @xmath24 , @xmath25 is reduced to an ising model  @xcite , which can explain many magnetic properties experimentally observed at temperatures well below the crystal - field excitation energy  @xcite . because of the ferromagnetic effective nearest - neighbor coupling @xmath26 , creating `` 3-in , 1-out '' and `` 1-in , 3-out '' configurations out of the macroscopically degenerate `` 2-in , 2-out '' spin - ice manifold costs an energy , and can be regarded as defects of magnetic monopoles and anti - monopoles with a unit magnetic charge  @xcite .",
    "then , the spin ice is described as the coulomb phase of magnetic monopoles where the emergent u(1 ) gauge fields mediate the coulomb interaction between monopole charges  @xcite .",
    "the density of magnetic monopoles is significantly suppressed to lower the total free energy at a temperature @xmath27 a few kelvin .",
    "simultaneously , the reduction of the monopole density suppresses spin - flip processes , for instance , due to a quantum tunneling  @xcite , that change the configuration of monopoles .",
    "hence , the relaxation time to reach the thermal equilibrium shows a rapid increase .",
    "these phenomena associated with a thermal quench of spin ice have been experimentally observed  @xcite and successfully mimicked by classical monte - carlo simulations on the coulomb gas model of magnetic monopoles  @xcite .",
    "this indicates that the quantum effects are almost negligible in the dipolar spin ice .",
    "it has been shown that the emergent gapless u(1 ) gauge excitations together with a power - law decay of spin correlations can survive against a weak antiferroic exchange interaction that exchanges the nearest - neighbor pseudospin-@xmath0 variables ( `` in '' and `` out '' )  @xcite .",
    "this @xmath28 spin liquid  @xcite can be viewed as a quantum version of the spin ice , though the macroscopic degeneracy of the ice - rule manifold should eventually be lifted in the ideal case under the equilibrium .      at a first glance",
    ", one might suspect that quantum fluctuations should be significantly suppressed by a large total angular momentum @xmath14 of the localized rare - earth magnetic moment and its strong single - spin ising anisotropy @xmath13 , since they favor a large amplitude of the quantum number for @xmath29 , either @xmath30 or @xmath31 .",
    "namely , in the effective hamiltonian , @xmath25 , a process for successive flips of the total angular momentum from @xmath30 to @xmath31 at one site and from @xmath31 to @xmath14 at the adjacent site is considerably suppressed at a temperature @xmath32 .",
    "the coupling constant for this pseudospin - flip interaction is of order of @xmath33 , and becomes negligibly small compared to the ising coupling @xmath34 .    in reality , however , because of the @xmath35 crystalline electric field ( cef ) acting on rare - earth ions [ fig .",
    "[ fig : crystal ] ] , the conservation of @xmath36 , which is implicitly assumed in the above consideration , no longer holds in the atomic level .",
    "eigenstates of the atomic hamiltonian including the @xmath37 coupling and the cef take the form of a superposition of eigenstates of @xmath36 whose eigenvalues are different by integer multiples of three . obviously , this is advantageous for the quantum spin exchange to efficiently work .",
    "attempts to include quantum effects have recently been in progress .",
    "it has been argued that the presence of a low - energy crystal - field excited doublet above the ground - state doublet in tb@xmath7ti@xmath7o@xmath4  @xcite enhances quantum fluctuations and possibly drives the classical spin ice into a quantum spin ice composed of a quantum superposition of `` 2-in , 2-out '' configurations  @xcite .",
    "we have proposed theoretically an alternative scenario , namely , a quantum melting of spin ice  @xcite .",
    "a quantum entanglement among the degenerate states lifts the macroscopic degeneracy , suppresses the spin - ice freezing , and thus leads to another distinct ground state .",
    "actually , the quantum - mechanical spin - exchange hamiltonian mixes `` 2-in , 2-out '' configurations with `` 3-in , 1-out '' and `` 1-in , 3-out '' , leading to a failure of the strict ice rule and _ a finite density of monopoles at the quantum - mechanical ground state_. namely , the quantum - mechanically proliferated monopoles can modify the dipolar spin - ice ground state , while a spatial profile of short - range spin correlations still resembles that of the dipolar spin ice  @xcite .",
    "they may appear in bound pairs or in condensates .",
    "we have reported that there appears a significantly large anisotropic quantum - mechanical superexchange interaction between pr magnetic moments in pr@xmath3o@xmath4  @xcite ( @xmath38 = zr , sn , hf , and ir )  @xcite .",
    "this anisotropic superexchange interaction drives _ quantum phase transitions among the spin ice , quadrupolar states having nontrivial chirality correlations , and the quantum spin ice _ , as we will see later .",
    "actually , among the rare - earth ions available for magnetic pyrochlore oxides  @xcite , the pr@xmath1 ion could optimally exhibit the quantum effects because of the following two facts .",
    "( i ) a relatively small magnitude of the pr@xmath1 localized magnetic moment , whose atomic value is given by @xmath39 , suppresses the magnetic dipolar interaction , which is proportional to the square of the moment size .",
    "then , for pr@xmath3o@xmath4 , one obtains @xmath40  k , which is an order of magnitude smaller than 2.4  k for ho@xmath7ti@xmath7o@xmath4 and dy@xmath7ti@xmath7o@xmath4 .",
    "similarly , quantum effects might appear prominently also for nd@xmath1 , sm@xmath1 , and yb@xmath1 ions because of their small moment amplitudes , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 , respectively , for isolated cases .",
    "( ii ) with fewer @xmath2 electrons , the @xmath2-electron wavefunction becomes less localized at atomic sites .",
    "this enhances the overlap with the o @xmath6 orbitals at the o1 site [ fig .",
    "[ fig : crystal ] ( a ) ] , and thus the superexchange interaction which is also further increased by a near resonance of pr @xmath2 and o @xmath6 levels .",
    "moreover , this superexchange interaction appreciably deviates from the isotropic heisenberg form because of the highly anisotropic orbital shape of the @xmath44-electron wavefunction and the strong @xmath37 coupling .",
    "since the direct coulomb exchange interaction is even negligibly small  @xcite , this superexchange interaction due to virtual @xmath44-@xmath45 electron transfers is expected to be the leading interaction .",
    "recent experiments on pr@xmath7sn@xmath7o@xmath4  @xcite , pr@xmath7zr@xmath7o@xmath4  @xcite , and pr@xmath7ir@xmath7o@xmath4  @xcite have shown that the pr@xmath1 ion provides the @xmath46 ising moment described by a non - kramers magnetic doublet .",
    "they show similarities to the dipolar spin ice .",
    "( i ) no magnetic dipole lro is observed down to a partial spin - freezing temperature @xmath47-@xmath48 k  @xcite .",
    "( ii ) pr@xmath7ir@xmath7o@xmath4 shows a metamagnetic transition at low temperatures only when the magnetic field is applied in the [ 111 ] direction  @xcite , indicating the ice - rule formation due to the effective ferromagnetic coupling @xmath49 k  @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", substantially different experimental observations from the dipolar spin ice have also been made .",
    "the curie - weiss temperature @xmath50 is antiferromagnetic for the zirconate  @xcite and iridate  @xcite , unlike the spin ice .",
    "the stannate shows a significant level of low - energy short - range spin dynamics in the energy range up to a few kelvin  @xcite , which is absent in the classical spin ice .",
    "furthermore , the iridate shows the hall effect at zero magnetic field without magnetic dipole lro  @xcite , suggesting an onset of a chiral spin - liquid phase  @xcite at @xmath51  k.    the discovery of this chiral spin state endowed with a broken time - reversal symmetry on a macroscopic scale in pr@xmath7ir@xmath7o@xmath4 without apparent magnetic lro  @xcite has increased the variety of spin liquids .",
    "one might speculate that this is caused mainly by a kondo coupling to ir conduction electrons and thus the rkky interaction  @xcite .",
    "however , the low - temperature thermodynamic properties are common in this series of materials , pr@xmath3o@xmath4 , except that a small partial reduction ( @xmath52 ) of pr magnetic moments probably due to conduction electrons affects the resistivity and the magnetic susceptibility in pr@xmath7ir@xmath7o@xmath4  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the onset temperature @xmath51  k for the emergent anomalous hall effect is comparable to the ferromagnetic coupling @xmath53  k  @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is natural to expect that a seed of the chiral spin state below @xmath54 exists in the pr moments interacting through the superexchange interaction and possibly the state is stabilized by the conduction electrons .",
    "another intriguing observation here is that without appreciable quantum effects , the chiral manifold of classical ice - rule spin configurations  @xcite that has been invented to account for the emergent anomalous hall effect will result from a magnetic dipole lro or freezing , which is actually absent down to @xmath55 .",
    "this points to a significant level of nontrivial quantum effects .",
    "ions form tetrahedrons ( dashed lines ) centered at o@xmath56 ions ( o1 ) , and are surrounded by o@xmath56 ions ( o2 ) in the @xmath35 symmetry as well as by transition - metal ions ( @xmath38 ) . each pr magnetic moment",
