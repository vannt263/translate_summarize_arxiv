    "lattice quantum chromodynamics ( lqcd ) is the only viable method for calculating the equation of state for quantum chromodynamics in the vicinity of the transition between hadrons and the quark gluon plasma . as such",
    ", lqcd provides an essential input for modeling and thereby understanding the physics of relativistic heavy ion collisions . using bg / l class supercomputers at llnl , bnl , and sdsc , the hotqcd collaboration has performed caculations of the equation of state and developed parameterizations suitable for input into hydrodynamic models . the essential results for these calcualtions are summarized in this proceedings .",

    "as described in the seminal work of wilson  @xcite and creutz  @xcite , the partition function for the qcd action can be calculated numerically on a discrete euclidean lattice . in this form ,",
    "the gluon action becomes a sum over all closed four - link loops ( plaquettes ) that can be evaluated with finite difference approximations .",
    "the full theory of qcd is recovered in the continuum limit , in which the lattice spacing is reduced to zero .",
    "both the p4 and asqtad gauge actions are symanzik improved , which means that they incorporate a six - link term that improves the convergence to @xmath3 . both p4 and asqtad _ stagger _ the fermion spinors on odd - even lattice sites , which preserves a discrete chiral symmetry ( i.e. exact chiral symmery is recovered in the continuum limit ) .",
    "both actions also include @xmath3 improvements , but they differ in their approach to further reducing cutoff effects .",
    "the p4 actions uses fat link smearing  @xcite , whereas the asqtad action uses tadpole coefficients  @xcite .",
    "the runs were performed along lines of constant physics , meaning that the bare quark masses are adjusted to maintain a constant value of the pion mass for a light quark mass set to one tenth the value of the strange quark mass .",
    "the temperature is determined by determining the distance @xmath4 at which the slope of the heavy quark potential equals @xmath5 .",
    "we use @xmath6  fm in this analysis  @xcite .",
    "the thermodynamic quantities were calculated by averaging over approximately 15k trajectories for 24 temperature values for p4 , and 17 temperatures for asqtad , with a corresponding zero temperature runs of approximately 5k trajectories .",
    "a complete listing of run statistics , parameters , and thermodynamic quantities is given in the appendices of  @xcite .",
    "the pressure and energy density are derived from the calculation of the interaction measure or trace anomaly , @xmath7 , which measures the deviation from the conformal limit .",
    "the pressure is obtained by integrating above a temperature , @xmath8 , for which the trace anomlay is close to zero .",
    "@xmath9    the expression for the trace anomaly from the fermion and gluon components is , @xmath10 here we use the notation @xmath11 to denote subtraction of the corresponding zero temperature values .",
    "@xmath12 is related to the derivative of the tadpole coefficient with respect to the gauge coupling and is used in the asqtad calculations ; this parameter is set to zero for p4 .",
    "the contributions from the gauge and fermion fields to the trace anomaly are shown separately in figure  [ theta_gf ] .",
    "the dominant contribution is from the gluon action ( left ) , although the cutoff effects appear to be larger for the fermion action ( right ) .",
    "note that this figure also includes results for @xmath13=4,6 lattices .",
    "the full trace anomaly calculations for p4 and asqtad are shown in figure  [ em3p_fits ] .",
    "the two actions show good agreement in the low and high temperature regions , although the peak is lower for asqtad than for p4 .",
