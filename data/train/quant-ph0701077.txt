    "recently , much attention @xcite has been drawn to the role of fidelity , a concept emerged from quantum information theory @xcite , in quantum critical phenomena @xcite .",
    "since fidelity is a measure of similarity between states , a dramatic change in the structure of the ground state around quantum critical point should result in a great difference between the two ground states on the both sides of critical point .",
    "for example , in one - dimensional xy model , fidelity shows a narrow trough at phase transition point @xcite .",
    "similar properties were also found in fermionic @xcite and bosonic systems @xcite . as fidelity is purely a quantum information concept , these works actually established a connection between quantum information theory and condensed matter physics .    however , except a few specific models such as the one - dimensional xy model and dicke model@xcite , it is tedious to evaluate fidelity from the ground state wavefunctions",
    ". therefore , a neater and simpler formalism is of great importance for the extensive application of fidelity to critical phenomena . for this purpose",
    ", we introduce the concept of fidelity susceptibility , which defines the response of fidelity to the driving parameter of the hamiltonian . at zero temperature , we show that fidelity susceptibility is intrinsically related to the dynamic structure factor of the driving hamiltonian , namely @xmath0 , that causes quantum phase transition .",
    "based on some well - developed numerical techniques for the ground state properties such as exact diagonalization ( ed ) @xcite and density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) @xcite , an applicable scheme is proposed to evaluate the dynamic structure factor of @xmath0 . on the other hand , starting from the definition of fidelity of a thermal state , we show that fidelity susceptibility is simply the thermal fluctuation term , such as specific heat @xmath1 for the internal energy and magnetic susceptibility @xmath2 for magnetization .",
    "these can easily be obtained from monte - carlo simulations @xcite .",
    "a general hamiltonian of quantum many - body systems reads    @xmath3    where @xmath0 is the driving hamiltonian and @xmath4 denotes its strength .",
    "the eigenstates @xmath5 which satisfy @xmath6 define a set of orthogonal complete basis in the hilbert space . here",
    "we restrict ourselves to the phase transition which is not induced by the ground state level - crossing .",
    "that means the ground state of the hamiltonian is non - degenerate for a finite system .",
    "next we change @xmath7 where @xmath8 is so small that perturbation is applicable . to the first order",
    ", the ground state becomes    @xmath9 following ref .",
    "@xcite , fidelity is defined as the overlap between @xmath10 and @xmath11 , that is    @xmath12    therefore , to the lowest order , we have    @xmath13 ^ 2 } + \\cdots .",
    "\\label{eq : fidelityexp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    clearly , fidelity is @xmath8-dependent and so it is an artificial quantity . despite of this",
    ", we can still see from eq.([eq : fidelityexp ] ) that the most relevant term in determining fidelity is its second derivative .",
    "compared with linear response theory , the coefficient term before @xmath14 actually defines the response of fidelity to a small change in @xmath4 . from this point of view",
    ", we introduce a new concept _ fidelity susceptibility _ as    @xmath15    with eq .",
    "( [ eq : fidelityexp ] ) , it can be rewritten as    @xmath16 ^ 2 } \\label{eq : fidelityexp2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the ground state .",
    "we would like to point out that although the aforementioned procedure is based on perturbation theory , fidelity susceptibility ( [ eq : fidelityexp2 ] ) only depends on the spectra of the hamiltonian @xmath17 and the hopping matrix @xmath18 .",
    "unfortunately , except for some very small systems which are usually far away from the scaling region ,",
    "eq.([eq : fidelityexp2 ] ) is almost not computable due to the lack of knowledge in the set of eigenstates . in order to overcome the difficulty , it is necessary to consider the time evolution of the system . for simplicity",
    ", we omit the parameter @xmath4 in the following expressions . define _ dynamic fidelity susceptibility _ as    @xmath19 ^ 2 + \\omega^2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    perform a fourier transformation and take derivative , we then obtain    @xmath20\\theta(\\tau)+ \\pi\\left[\\langle \\psi_0 |h_i(0 ) h_i(\\tau)|\\psi_0\\rangle -\\langle\\psi_0|h_i|\\psi_0\\rangle^2 \\right]\\theta(-\\tau ) , \\label{eq : fed_fluctuation}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with @xmath21 being the imaginary time and @xmath22 the two equations mentioned above are impressive as they reveal the mystery of fidelity in understanding quantum critical phenomena .",
    "the terms in the brackets in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fed_fluctuation ] ) are nothing but the dynamic structure factor of @xmath0 .",
    "therefore in the original definition of fidelity , we subconsciously choose the driving term @xmath0 as a candidate of the order parameter , though we might not think so at that time .    in order to arrive at a more computable formula ,",
    "we carry out an inverse fourier transformation and obtain",
    "@xmath23 d\\tau \\nonumber \\\\ \\label{eq : fidelityfnal}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the first term in the bracket can be calculated by    @xmath24    although fidelity is difficult to calculate from the ground state wavefunctions , eq .",
    "( [ eq : fidelityfnal ] ) and ( [ eq : dyfactor ] ) provide us with another practical way .",
    "especially , eq . ( [ eq : dyfactor ] )",
    "can be easily evaluated via the prevailing numerical techniques , say , ed and dmrg . for the ed ,",
    "once the ground state is obtained , the map from one state to another new state is just a standard lanczos step . while for the dmrg",
    ", the standard algorithm involves a transformation of the hamiltonian of a system and its environment , from a set of old basis to a set of new basis which is constructed by the @xmath25 largest weighted eigenstates of the reduced density matrix .",
    "precisely , for the system block @xmath26 , and environment block @xmath27 , where @xmath28 are constructed from @xmath25 largest weighted eigenstates of the corresponding reduced density matrix .",
    "the only modification is that , in addition to @xmath17 , @xmath0 should be independently transformed in the dmrg procedure , i.e. @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "once the final ground state is obtained , the mapping @xmath31 and @xmath32 is simply a standard step .    , versus @xmath33 of the half - filled hubbard model with @xmath34 and periodic boundary conditions .",
    "right : the fidelity susceptibility @xmath35 as a function of @xmath33 , obtained from the data of the left picture .",
    "all lines in the left picture collapse to a single line .",
    "[ fig : fid_hub],width=302 ]     for various system size .",
    "in order to avoid degeneracy in the ground state , the systems of @xmath36 and @xmath37 are diagonalized with periodic boundary conditions , while the systems of @xmath38 and @xmath39 with antiperiodic boundary conditions . [",
    "fig : fid_hubscale],width=302 ]    . clearly , @xmath40 is a constant if @xmath41 is very large .",
    "[ fig : chi_hub],width=264 ]",
    "in previous works @xcite , the fidelity gives us a deep impression that it can be used to signal any phase transition .",
    "for example , in the ising model,@xcite the fidelity collapses to zero at the critical point . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : fidelityexp ] ) , such a singular behavior can be interpreted as the divergence of the fidelity susceptibility .",
    "this interpretation is consistent with that the fidelity is intrinsically based on the landau s symmetry - breaking theory .",
    "the order parameter is just the driving term in the hamiltonian , then the divergence of the fidelity susceptibility becomes a crucial condition to signal a phase transition of landau s type .",
    "however , this restriction also make the fidelity fails to identify those phase transitions that is of infinite order .",
    "to check this point , also verify the above expression , we now study the fidelity susceptibility of a non - trivial model in condensed matter physics , more specifically , the one - dimensional hubbard model , where the phase transition happened at the half - filling case is of infinite order .",
    "the hamiltonian of the hubbard model reads @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the creation and annihilation operators for electrons with spin @xmath45 ( with @xmath46 ) at site @xmath47 respectively , @xmath48 , @xmath49 is the hopping integral , and @xmath50 denotes the strength of on - site interaction . at half filling ,",
    "the ground state of the hubbard model undergoes a quantum phase transition from an ideal conductor to a mott - insulator at the point @xmath51 @xcite . for simplicity , we diagonalize the hamiltonian for a 10-site systems with periodic boundary conditions using lanczos method , and compute fidelities with various interaction intervals and their corresponding susceptibility .",
    "numerical results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fid_hub ] . obviously , they support our conclusion that fidelity susceptibility rather than fidelity is more crucial in the ground state .",
    "that is the fidelity susceptibility does not depend on the value of @xmath52 , but the fidelity does .",
    "this fact makes it possible to evaluate the fidelity from the ground state @xmath53 without knowledge of @xmath54 .",
    "another interesting observation is that neither fidelity susceptibility is a maximum , nor fidelity is a minimum at the critical point .",
    "this fact goes somewhat beyond the physical intuition aroused by the original research motivation @xcite which expects that the fidelity should be a minimum at the critical point . though finite - size scaling analysis ( see fig . [",
    "fig : fid_hubscale ] ) shows that the fidelity susceptibility at @xmath51 may become larger and larger as the system size increases , the divergence of the rescaled fidelity susceptibility @xmath55 @xcite at the critical point is an unexpected phenomenon ( see fig . [",
    "fig : chi_hub ] ) .",
    "it is because for the half - filled hubbard model , the phase transition at @xmath51 is of the kosterlitz - thouless type . in this case",
    ", the ground - state energy as a function of @xmath50 can be expanded to any order around @xmath51 , and the density - density correlation defined by the @xmath50 term in the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonianhub ] ) does not have a long - range order , then the local order parameter for the symmetry - breaking theory is not well - defined . on the other hand , if @xmath50 deviates from the critical point , the scaling behavior shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fid_hubscale ] manifests that the fidelity susceptibility may increases in the small @xmath50 region .",
    "however , as the @xmath56 increases , the trend of @xmath35 is still similar to the case of @xmath51 . therefore , to find an appropriate driving term is very crucial for understanding the role of fidelity in quantum critical phenomena .",
    "for the hubbard model , besides the @xmath50 term , it seems be very necessary to introduce another non - local term for the fidelity .",
    "nevertheless , it is still a challenging problem at present .",
    "the generalization of fidelity to finite temperatures is proposed recently . based on the definition of fidelity between two mixed states",
    ", it has been shown that fidelity can be expressed in terms of the partition function @xcite ,    @xmath57    where @xmath58 , and @xmath59 here @xmath60 is the density of states and can be calculated from monte - carlo simulations @xcite such as wang - landau algorithm @xcite .",
    "then the fidelity susceptibility driven by temperature can be calculated as @xmath61 similarly , if the driving term in the hamiltonian is a zeemann - like term , which is crucial in landau s symmetry - breaking theory , then the fidelity susceptibility is simply the magnetic susceptibility @xmath2 , @xmath62 clearly , the specific heat is simply the fluctuation of the internal energy , i.e. @xmath63 , while the magnetic susceptibility is the fluctuation of the magnetization , i.e. @xmath64 .",
    "thus fidelity susceptibility is just the fluctuation ( structure factor ) of the driving term in the hamiltonian .",
    "in summary , we established a general relation between the fidelity and the structure factor of the driving term of the hamiltonian for both quantum and classical critical phenomena .",
    "such relation not only enables us to evaluate fidelity easily through prevailing numerical techniques such as dmrg , ed , and monte - carlo simulations , but also builds a straightforward connection between the concepts in quantum information theory and those in quantum many - body physics .",
    "we thank x. g. wen and h. q. lin for helpful discussions .",
    "this work is supported by the earmarked grant for research from the research grants council of hksar , china ( project cuhk n_cuhk204/05 and 400906 ) .",

    "since the value of @xmath52 should depend on the system size , otherwise , the fidelity between any two states separated by a given @xmath52 usually is zero for an infinite system ."
