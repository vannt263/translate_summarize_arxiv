    "for more than a few decades now , the observed properties of galaxies have been known to depend upon the environment in which they are located . for instance",
    ", elliptical and lenticular galaxies are systematically over - represented in highly overdense environments such as galaxy clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "similarly , measurements of the 2-point galaxy correlation function for different luminosity and color subpopulations have provided a complementary window to what galaxies populate different environments @xcite .",
    "furthermore , recent studies utilizing the sloan digital sky survey ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sdss ) and the 2-degree field galaxy redshift survey @xcite have found that a wide array of galaxy properties ( e.g.  color , luminosity , surface - brightness , star - formation rate , and agn activity ) correlate with the local density of the galaxy environment and that the observed correlations extend from the centers of clusters out into the field galaxy population @xcite .",
    "current hierarchical galaxy formation models predict that galaxies form in less dense environments and are then accreted into larger groups and clusters @xcite . within such models ,",
    "there are a plethora of physical processes that could explain the observed trends with environment .",
    "for example , galaxy mergers , which preferentially occur in galaxy groups rather than clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , can destroy galactic disks and thereby convert spiral galaxies into ellipticals and lenticulars ( toomre & toomre 1972 ) ; likewise , ram - pressure stripping within galaxy clusters can effectively suffocate star formation in member galaxies ( gunn & gott 1972 ) , and within overdense regions galaxies can be swept of their gas via feedback from agn , thus quenching the star - formation process @xcite .",
    "in recent years , many studies have focused on measuring the correlations between galaxy properties and environment at @xmath6 .",
    "for example , using large data sets from local surveys such as the sdss , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite measured the relationship between star - formation history and local galaxy density for environments ranging from voids to clusters . at high redshift , however , such analysis over a similar environment range and with a comparable sample size has yet to be completed due in large part to the lack of a suitable data set .",
    "while studies of clusters have pushed to high redshift , the range of environments probed in such studies has been limited , with galaxies grouped into coarse classifications ( such as field , group , and cluster populations ) and with statistically small spectroscopic sample sizes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "as discussed by @xcite , to measure galaxy environments accurately at @xmath3 , a survey must obtain high - precision ( i.e.spectroscopic ) redshifts over a large and contiguous field with a relatively high sampling rate .",
    "the deep2 galaxy redshift survey @xcite is the first survey at high redshift to provide such a sample , opening the door to studying galaxy properties and environments at @xmath3 over a continuous range of environments from voids to large groups .",
    "studying the relationship between environment and galaxy properties at high redshift should afford the perspective needed to understand the nature of the observed relations found locally .",
    "in particular , studying galaxy environments at higher @xmath7 will help determine whether the correlations observed in the nearby universe are a result of evolutionary processes with long time - scales or whether the observed relations were in place very early in the lifetime of the universe .",
    "constraints derived from @xmath3 studies should also yield information regarding the physical processes ( e.g.  ram - pressure stripping , harassment , and mergers ) and possible environment regimes ( e.g.  groups versus clusters ) that are significant in creating the trends seen locally .    in this paper , we study the environment of high - redshift @xmath8 galaxies in the deep2 galaxy redshift survey with a goal of determining the correlation between local density and galaxy properties when the universe was half its present age . in particular , we examine the relations between environment and galaxy color , luminosity , and [ oii ] equivalent width . in  2 , we describe the deep2 survey and the galaxy sample under study .",

    "the rest - frame [ oii ] equivalent width and error are derived from the total intensity of the doublet and the robust continuum . for all analysis utilizing [ oii ] equivalent widths ,",

    "for each galaxy in the data set , we estimate the local galaxy density using the projected @xmath2-nearest - neighbor surface density , @xmath48 . in computing @xmath49 , the full deep2 galaxy sample is employed and we utilize a velocity interval of @xmath50 along the line - of - sight to exclude foreground and background galaxies .",
    "the measured surface density depends on the projected distance to the @xmath2-nearest neighbor , @xmath51 , as @xmath52 , such that @xmath53 corresponds to a projected @xmath2-nearest - neighbor distance of @xmath54 comoving mpc and surface density of unity corresponds to a length scale of @xmath55 comoving mpc . from tests using the mock galaxy catalogs of @xcite ,",
    "@xcite find the projected @xmath2-nearest - neighbor distance to be a robust and accurate environment measure that minimizes the role of redshift - space distortions and edge effects .",
    "further details regarding the computation and sensitivity of this density measure as well as comparisons to other common environment estimators are presented in @xcite .      to correct each density estimate for the variable redshift completeness of the deep2 survey",
    ", we scale the density measured about each galaxy according to the local value of the 2-dimensional survey completeness map , @xmath56 , which accounts for variations in targeting rate and redshift completeness from position to position within the survey @xcite .",
    "each density value is also corrected for the redshift dependence of the sampling rate of the survey using the empirical method presented in @xcite : each density value is divided by the median @xmath49 of galaxies at that redshift over the whole sample , where the median is computed in bins of @xmath57 .",
    "using mock galaxy catalogs , @xcite conclude that such an empirical correction is effective at reducing the influence of variations in redshift sampling in the survey without overcorrecting variations in enviroment due to cosmic variance . correcting the measured densities in this manner",
    "converts the @xmath49 values into measures of overdensity relative to the median density @xmath58 , and is similar to the methods employed by @xcite and @xcite . to ensure that the applied corrections are not exceedingly large",
    ", we restrict the analysis presented in this paper to galaxies in the redshift interval @xmath1 , where the deep2 selection function is relatively shallow .      when calculating the local density of galaxies , the confined sky coverage of a survey introduces geometric distortions  or edge effects  which bias environment measures near edges or holes in the survey field , generally causing densities to be under - estimated @xcite .",
    "we define the deep2 survey area and corresponding edges according to the 2-dimensional survey completeness map and the photometric bad - pixel mask used in slitmask design  defining all regions of sky with @xmath59 averaged over scales of @xmath60 to be unobserved and rejecting all significant regions of sky ( @xmath60 in scale ) which are incomplete in the photometric catalog .",
    "areas of incompleteness on scales @xmath61 are comparable to the typical angular separation of galaxies targeted by deep2 @xcite , and thus cause a negligible perturbation to the measured densities .    to minimize the impact of edges on the data sample , we exclude any galaxy within @xmath62 comoving mpc of an edge or gap .",
    "such a cut greatly reduces the portion of the data set contaminated by edge effects @xcite while retaining @xmath63 of the full galaxy sample .",
    "combined with the restriction to the redshift regime @xmath1 , this gives a final sample comprising 14,214 galaxies .",
    "for easy reference , the details regarding the galaxy samples utilized throughout this paper are listed in table [ sample_tab ] .",
    "the distribution of overdensities , @xmath64 , for this sample ( sample c in table [ sample_tab ] ) is shown in figure [ envdist ] .",
    "due to the need to design deimos slitmasks such that spectra do not overlap and due to the adopted target - selection and slitmask - tiling schemes of the survey , the deep2 survey slightly under - samples projected overdensities of galaxies on the sky @xcite .",
    "such a bias in the survey is a critical concern for the measurement of accurate galaxy densities in highly - clustered environments .",
    "however , using the mock catalogs of @xcite to test the survey target - selection and slitmask - making procedures , @xcite find that while the deep2 survey under - samples dense _ regions of sky _",
    "( projected densities on the sky ) , the survey does not under - sample dense _ environments _ ( that is , local densities in three - dimensional space ) to any significant degree .",
    "we have determined the uncertainty in our environment measures using the mock galaxy catalogs of @xcite . in order to simulate the deep2 sample ,",
    "the volume - limited mock catalogs are passed through the deep2 target - selection and slitmask - making procedures as described by @xcite and @xcite , placing @xmath65 of targets on a slitmask . using the same techniques as applied to the data , we measure the environment for each galaxy in the simulated deep2 sample . for each mock galaxy , this `` observed '' environment",
    "is compared to the `` true '' environment as measured in the full volume - limited catalog using the real - space positions for all of the galaxies .",
    "measuring the scatter in `` true '' minus `` observed '' environment for the simulated deep2 galaxies shows a 1-@xmath66 scatter of roughly 0.5 in units of @xmath67 .",
    "the uncertainty in the overdensity values shows little dependence on environment , with only a slight increase in the errors at higher densities . for more details on the mock catalogs or tests of environment measures using them ,",
    "refer to @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "the local density of galaxies is thought to influence galaxy characteristics such as morphology and star - formation rate , and thus such galaxy properties are often studied as a function of enviroment .",
    "analyses performed in this manner are particularly helpful at recognizing scales or densities at which galaxy properties transition and are therefore useful in understanding the physical processes at play . measurements of galaxy environment , however , are significantly more uncertain than measures of other properties such as color or luminosity",
    ". therefore , by binning galaxies according to local density , there is a significant correlation between neighboring density bins which smears out any trends with other galaxy properties .",
    "consequently , in this paper , we instead study the dependence of mean environment on galaxy properties .",
    "the mean relations are weighted according to the inverse selection volumes , @xmath68 ; computing the mean in this manner minimizes the effects of malmquist bias @xcite in the sample . in computing the @xmath69 values ,",
    "we restrict the surveyed volume to @xmath1 and incorporate rest - frame color according to the k - corrections discussed in  3.1 .",
    "as shown in figure [ environ_vs_color ] , at @xmath3 , blue galaxies on average occupy less - dense environments .",
    "we observe a distinct transition in mean overdensity which corresponds well with the observed color bimodality .",
    "the mean environment for red galaxies at @xmath3 is more than 1.5 times more dense than for their blue counterparts . at very blue colors , @xmath70",
    ", we also find significant evidence for a fall - off in the mean overdensity .    the observed relationship between galaxy overdensity and rest - frame color at @xmath3 mirrors that seen in the local universe",
    ". the dependence of mean environment on color at @xmath71 exhibits a strong transition in mean density occurring at the location of the color bimodality and a further decrease in mean density for the very bluest galaxies @xcite .",
    "we find that this trend is already in place as early as a redshift of unity .",
    "as illustrated in figure [ cmd ] , the deep2 sample is heavily weighted towards blue galaxies at higher redshift ; in addition , the sampling rate for deep2 decreases significantly beyond @xmath72 ( see fig .",
    "[ nofz ] ) . the observed correlation between mean overdensity and color",
    ", however , is not a product of selection effects . by limiting the sample to @xmath73 and @xmath74 where the red galaxy sample is complete and any evolution in the measured galaxy density is negligible , the observed color dependence of mean environment persists with the contrast in typical overdensity for red and blue galaxies unchanged relative to that observed for the full @xmath1 sample .    using the group finder of @xcite , we are able to identify the set of galaxies within the data set not associated with groups or clusters , that is , the field population . in figure",
    "[ environ_vs_color ] , we show the mean dependence of environment on rest - frame @xmath33 color for this sub - population ( diamond symbols )",
    ". we find that among the field sample a weak trend with color exists such that red field members are found to be only slightly overdense relative to their blue conterparts . at very blue colors ,",
    "however , the trend with mean overdensity is clearly evident within the field galaxy population .      as shown in figure [ environ_vs_ew ] , the dependence of mean galaxy density on [ oii ] equivalent width , @xmath45}$ ] , is a strong monotonic trend at @xmath3 . on average , galaxies with smaller equivalent widths occupy regions of higher density . again , limiting the sample to galaxies in the redshift range @xmath73 and brighter than @xmath75 , we find the measured trend with @xmath76}$ ] to be essentiallly unchanged ; we do not appear to be biased by any redshift dependence or selection effect in the sample .",
    "the strength of the observed correspondence between environment and @xmath45}$ ] is not surprising given the close correlation between galaxy color and [ oii ] equivalent width , as shown in figure [ ew_vs_color ] and found in previous studies of galaxy properties at @xmath3 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "red galaxies in the deep2 sample are strongly clustered in the @xmath77}$ ] plane with @xmath45 } < 40{\\rm \\aa}$ ] , while for the blue galaxy population [ oii ] equivalent width tends to increase rapidly with decreasing color .",
    "fitting a @xmath78-order polynomial to the mean overdensity relation with color ( see figure [ environ_vs_color ] ) and subtracting off this dependence for each galaxy according to its rest - frame color , we find no evidence for any residual environment dependence on [ oii ] equivalent width separate from the color dependence ; the residual points in figure [ environ_vs_ew ] are consistent with a line of zero slope and intercept .",
    "given the uncertainties in the measured quantities , simulations indicate that we would be able to detect a residual slope as small as @xmath79 equivalent width at a 3-@xmath66 level .",
    "conversely , if we apply this same test in reverse and check for residuals in mean environment with @xmath33 color when the trend between mean environment and @xmath45}$ ] has been removed , we find that a strong residual trend between @xmath80 and @xmath33 does exist ( see fig .",

    "fitting to the dependence of mean overdensity on @xmath45}$ ] and subtracting off this dependence for each galaxy according to its [ oii ] equivalent width , we find a residual trend between mean environment and color .",
    "this result suggests that [ oii ] equivalent width does not have a relationship with environment separate from that observed with rest - frame @xmath33 color . while both galaxy properties are indirect tracers of star - formation and local studies find a galaxy s star - formation history to be strongly correlated with its environment ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is not suprising that galaxy color would be more closely correlated with galaxy environment .",
    "[ oii ] equivalent width more closely traces the instantaneous star - formation rate of a galaxy , which can be dictated by short - term processes such as minor mergers that are not inherently tied to the local density of bright galaxies on somewhat larger scales , which we measure in the deep2 data .",

    "color , on the other hand , tracks the history of the galaxy on longer time - scales and as such may be more strongly correlated with the larger - scale environment of the galaxy as probed by the deep2 survey .      within the local universe",
    "there is striking evidence that the correlation between environment and absolute magnitude is heavily dependent on color .",
    "@xcite find no luminosity dependence on the mean environment of nearby blue galaxies .",
    "for the red population , however , a strong luminosity dependence is observed , with the most luminous red galaxies on average residing in increasingly dense environments and with the intrinsically faintest local galaxies also found to populate regions of greater density @xcite .    when attempting to examine the luminosity dependence of environment in the deep2 survey , we must acknowledge the strong relationship between mean color and luminosity in the data . at @xmath81 ,",
    "the deep2 galaxy sample is dominated by blue galaxies including a population of faint @xmath82 , very blue @xmath83 objects ( see figure [ cmd ] ) .",
    "therefore , as a fair attempt to disentangle the environment dependencies on color and on luminosity at @xmath3 , we compute the weighted mean galaxy overdensity as a function of luminosity for red and blue galaxies separately .",

    "however , probe a significantly smaller portion of the galaxy luminosity function than similar studies at low redshift ; deep2 is unable to study the faintest red galaxies at high redshift which do not make the @xmath16 magnitude limit for the survey , while the most luminous red galaxies observed in the sdss are very rare , so few are included in the much smaller deep2 survey volume .    among the blue @xmath3 population ,",

    "these bright blue galaxies are also known to populate the high - mass end of the color - magnitude blue cloud , with stellar masses of @xmath103 @xcite and are preferentially found in regions of high overdensity where quenching is most likely to occur , the locations in models where it is driven by galaxy mergers , the stripping of gas by hydrodynamical and tidal effects , or agn .",
    "furthermore , those mechanisms which can cause the total stellar mass of a large galaxy to decrease ( e.g.  galaxy harassment ) are only effective in the most massive clusters , which are not represented within the deep2 sample ( see  6.2 ) .",
    "therefore , it is extremely unlikely that these galaxies can decrease in stellar mass from @xmath3 to @xmath4 .",
    "thus , we conclude that the bright blue galaxies in overdense environments at high redshift evolve ( i.e. , have their star formation quenched ) into members of the red sequence by @xmath104 . as such",
    ", our results within the larger set of observations suggest that the _ typical _ entry point onto the red sequence via quenching is fainter ( i.e. , less massive ) at @xmath4 than at @xmath105 .",
    "that is , the luminosity dependence of the mean environment for blue galaxies within the deep2 sample , when compared with the local sdss and recent deep2 results , is consistent with a `` downsizing of quenching '' as discussed by @xcite , in the sense that there exists a population of massive galaxies that was likely undergoing quenching at @xmath3 , which has no high - mass counterpart today . as part of an upcoming paper @xcite",
    ", we intend to examine these trends in detail by including stellar mass determinations alongside environment , color , and luminosity measures .      using the group finder of @xcite , we can associate each galaxy in our analysis with either a cluster , a group , or the field .",
    "this provides an interesting way to examine the contribution from bound structures of different size to the environmental trends presented in  5 .",
    "the deep2 galaxy catalog is dominated by group and field galaxies , with large clusters only scarcely represented . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ environ_vs_color ] , the relationship between median environment and rest - frame color mirrors the dependence observed for the mean , with the median relation negligibly affected by cluster members . within the survey volume ( sample c ) , only @xmath106 of galaxies are found in clusters ( i.e.  groups with velocity dispersions greater than @xmath107 and @xmath108 observed members ) .",
    "for the red sequence alone , the contribution is only slightly larger at @xmath109 . on the other hand ,",
    "field galaxies represent @xmath110 of the total , with the remaining @xmath111 locked into galaxy groups .",
    "such groups contain on average @xmath15 members in the survey sample , thus @xmath112 members overall given the @xmath65 sampling rate of the deep2 survey .",
    "knowing that cluster - sized objects within the deep2 survey volume make a negligible contribution to our results allows us to place constraints on the physical processes which may or may not have had a role in establishing the color - environment and luminosity - environment relationships .",
    "for example , in highly overdense environments numerous mechanisms have been identified that can potentially alter the colors of the cluster population , including ram - pressure stripping @xcite , galaxy harassment @xcite , and global tidal interactions within the cluster potential @xcite .",
    "although such processes all modify the star - formation histories of the galaxies on which they operate , such environments are not present in the deep2 sample in any statistically significant sense and the aforementioned processes do not operate efficiently in lower - density environments such as groups .",
    "thus , these cluster - specific mechanisms alone can not explain the established environmental relationships observed at @xmath3 .",
    "the interesting flip - side to the above discussion is that both group - sized systems and galaxies in the field are abundant in the deep2 galaxy catalog .",
    "such sub - populations offer an alternative place to look to understand the observed color- and luminosity - environment trends . to disentangle the contribution from each , we first remove all group and cluster members from the sample and then recompute each of our main results . in figure",
    "[ environ_vs_color ] , we overplot the @xmath105 relation between mean overdensity and galaxy rest - frame @xmath33 color for field galaxies alone ( diamond symbols ) .",
    "we find that for the field population only a weak trend of overdensity with galaxy color persists , where red field galaxies are found to be only marginally overdense relative to their blue counterparts .",
    "thus , not surprisingly , group - sized systems play a dominant role in establishing the density contrast observed at the color bimodality within the color - environment relation at @xmath3 .    while the difference in mean overdensity between red and blue galaxies is reduced by excluding group members , the trend towards lower mean overdensity at very blue colors",
    "is barely altered .",
    "the preservation of this trend among the field population is not surprising given the small fraction @xmath113 of galaxies at the bluest colors @xmath114 that are in groups .",
    "based on their [ oii ] equivalent widths , these very blue galaxies have the highest specific star - formation rates within the deep2 sample , which indicates that their stellar populations are predominantly composed of young stars . the nature of this interesting subpopulation will be investigated more throughly by @xcite .    having isolated the deep2 field galaxy population",
    ", we examine the dependence of overdensity on rest - frame @xmath34-band absolute magnitude for blue - cloud and red - sequence galaxies separately , as shown in figure [ environ_vs_amagbr ] ( diamond symbols , top and bottom panels , respectively ) .",
    "red - sequence field galaxies show a decrease in density contrast relative to the full red sequence across the entire magnitude range probed . unfortunately ,",
    "as such galaxies are rather rare within the deep2 sample , the statistics we obtain are somewhat noisy .",
    "blue field galaxies , on the other hand , are greater in number within deep2 and exhibit an interesting relationship between environment and luminosity ; when the contribution from group galaxies is removed , their contrast in density also decreases . however , the slope of this trend from faint to bright appears to have steepened somewhat ( see fig .  [ environ_vs_amagbr ] and table [ fits_tab ] ) , with the faintest blue field galaxies characteristically populating survey regions with overdensities approaching those of voids and the brightest blue field galaxies residing on average in environments of mean survey density @xmath115 .",
    "this behavior is consistent with current observations of the local galaxy population , where the characteristic luminosity of the blue field population also scales with environment , at least in under- to mean - density regions of the universe ( see figure 7 of * ? ? ?",
    "thus in comparison to the results of @xcite , at least qualitatively , the blue sequence field population shows a similar relationship with environment at both @xmath3 and the present day .",
    "this contrasts the bright blue group members , which through the quenching of their star formation must transition onto the red sequence where they are observed today in the local universe .",
    "this leads us to propose that at @xmath116 quenching is a process that dominates galaxy evolution down to systems of group size and not below .",
    "note that , although some red galaxies are found to reside in low density environments at @xmath3 they constitute only a small portion of the field population ( @xmath117 * ? ? ?",
    "conceivably , some of these galaxies could belong to groups missed by our group finder or to fossil groups of high virial mass but with underluminous satellite members . a more thorough study of the relationship between environment and luminosity in group and field galaxies in the sdss or the 2dfgrs is truly needed to measure the luminosity - environment trend among the blue field population locally , thereby completing this picture .",
    "one may naturally ask exactly what physical processes could have occurred within both cluster _ and _ group environments to explain the observed color and magnitude relations with respect to overdensity presented in this paper .",
    "we have already pointed out that many mechanisms that dominate cluster - sized systems _ alone _",
    "are unlikely to explain our results , as they do not operate efficiently in the lower - mass halos where our results show they need to .",
    "we will now discuss several processes that may be operating in this lower - mass regime .",
    "as shown by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , models of gas infall onto dark matter halos produce a natural bimodal distribution in gas temperature , dividing cold infalling gas from that which remains at the virial temperature to form a static hot halo .",
    "the dominant component of gas in a system , cold or hot , is found to change at a reasonably well defined dark matter halo mass of approximately @xmath118 out to at least @xmath119 .",
    "interestingly , this mass is low enough to include systems which are identified observationally as groups ; within the deep2 survey , galaxy groups are found to occupy dark matter halos with masses both above and below this critical mass @xcite .",
    "the above authors speculate that as a growing dark matter halo passes this critical mass , the infalling cold gas supply to the central galactic disk is shut off , and the galaxy will quickly burn its remaining fuel and redden ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . within this picture , blue galaxies in the deep2 @xmath3 sample are only just approaching this critical halo mass and will still be cold - accreting infalling gas from which star formation is fueled , even for the brightest blue galaxies in the densest environments ( figure [ environ_vs_amagbr ] ) .",
    "however , dark matter halos continue to grow at redshifts of @xmath120 , and thus these systems may eventually reach the transition mass , at which point the infalling gas instead heats to the virial temperature to build a quasistatic hot halo around the galaxy .",
    "if there is no subsequent cold gas supply to the disk , then star formation in such galaxies will ultimately become quenched , as observed in the local universe .",
    "the primary problem with this picture is that in systems more massive than the critical halo mass , quasistatic x - ray emitting hot atmospheres typically have central cooling times much shorter than the age of the universe ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the hot , dense central regions must then cool , and the gas condensing out of the flow will ultimately reach the galactic disk to feed the central galaxy star - formation reservoir , in a similar way as the infalling cold - accreting gas would when the system was much less massive .",
    "this is the classical `` cooling flow problem '' and has been extensively investigated in the literature over the past 30 or so years ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if left unabated , such unconstrained star formation can keep even the most massive galaxy in the `` blue cloud '' @xcite , in stark contrast to what is observed .",
    "because of this , the transition from cold to hot accretion for a galaxy halo is unlikely to be able to account for the observed quenching of @xmath3 bright blue galaxies alone .",
    "many authors have thus proposed agn as an energetically feasible mechanism with which cooling gas can be suppressed ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therin ) .",
    "@xcite demonstrate that if one assumes a low energy agn heating source fed from the quiescent hot halo surrounding the galaxy ( which , from above , can form when the host dark matter halo reaches a mass of @xmath121 ) , then the cooling flow gas can be effectively stopped , thereby quenching star formation and pushing the galaxy from the blue cloud and onto the red sequence .",
    "other group - scale processes may also contribute to the quenching of star formation .",
    "in addition to the mechanisms just discussed , galaxy mergers , which preferentially occur in galaxy groups @xcite , may be capable of triggering events which remove cold gas from the galactic disk to shut off star formation , at least for some ( perhaps extended ) period of time .",
    "such events can then potentially convert members of the blue cloud into red - sequence galaxies .",
    "early simulation work showed that mergers can disrupt galactic disks yielding merger remnants with surface - brightness profiles and density distributions similar to those of elliptical galaxies @xcite .",
    "along with a morphological transformation , merger events in systems rich in cold gas can also produce starbursts from which strong galactic super - winds flow @xcite , and merger - induced cold gas accretion on to central super - massive black holes can trigger energetic quasar winds which are capable of sweeping all gas from their hosts @xcite . in this way , a merger may initiate additional processes which result in a depletion of the star forming gas reservoir , leading ultimately to a quenching of the galaxies star formation if no addition cold gas supply is present .",
    "we conclude this section by mentioning an additional process that may be relevant to the present discussion , but may not be described as an environment - dependent effect . secular evolution ( or secular bulge - building ) is another means of triggering morphological evolution in a galaxy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "following secular evolution , subcomponents of a galaxy interact internally through the transfer of angular momentum along a galactic bar ( or spiral arms ) , from which matter can funnel inwards towards the galactic center .",
    "for example , @xcite suggests that the bulges of disk galaxies may result from the accumulation of massive clumps that formed within the galactic disk and migrated inward via dynamical friction .",
    "such instabilities provide a channel through which cold gas in the disk can transfer away its angular momentum to reach the central regions of the galaxy , potentially providing a source of fuel to the central black hole to trigger an agn outflow , as described above .",
    "the results presented within this paper , however , suggest that the quenching of blue galaxies is an evolutionary process that occurs preferentially in overdense environments .",
    "thus , it appears as if secular evolution can not be the _ only _ process responsible for the trends with environment observed at @xmath3 .",
    "while a clear relationship between rest - frame color and environment is already in place by a redshift of unity , and comparison to local samples indicates that star formation is being suppressed in more massive galaxies at @xmath3 than at @xmath4 , we are unfortunately not yet able to precisely quantify the differences between the two populations or the strength of this evolution .",
    "such a quantitative analysis requires establishing the local and @xmath3 galaxy samples on equal footing , for example , by measuring galaxy colors and luminosities in identical passbands and measuring environments using identical techniques and with equivalent galaxy samples .",
    "while beyond the scope of this current paper , future work utilizing the deep2 and sdss data sets @xcite will address this issue .",
    "it is possible , however , to combine the environment measurements at @xmath105 and @xmath4 into a general picture of how the overall galaxy population evolves . here",
    ", we discuss the results presented in this work and similar low-@xmath7 studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in light of both the larger framework of clustering evolution and the need for quenching mechanisms that operate most efficiently in group- and cluster - sized systems . the color - environment relations at low- and high - redshift epochs show amazing similarity in general .",
    "while quantifying the evolution in this relationship will be addressed in another paper , we speculate that the contrast in mean overdensity between red and blue galaxies increases from @xmath3 to @xmath4 as blue galaxies in overdense environments are preferentially quenched and join the red sequence and as already - quenched red galaxies continue to cluster into increasingly overdense environments .",
    "this larger picture is also consistent with the observed trends between environment and luminosity for both red and blue galaxy populations . unlike similar @xmath4 studies ,",
    "the deep2 survey unfortunately does not sample the faint end of the red galaxy luminosity function due to the @xmath122 magnitude limit of the survey . at bright magnitudes ,",
    "however , we find a trend towards increasing mean environment with luminosity for red galaxies similar to that found locally .",
    "the increasingly steep slope to the @xmath4 luminosity - environment relation at the very bright end of the red sequence @xcite is not seen in our higher - redshift results .",
    "to build such bright red massive galaxies requires cluster environments , which are relatively rare at @xmath3 but increase in number in a highly - evolved clustering distribution as seen locally .    for blue galaxies in all environments ,",
    "the @xmath3 relationship between mean overdensity and luminosity is significantly different from that seen at @xmath4 , with a strong slope such that bright blue galaxies are preferentially found in regions of higher overdensity and faint blue galaxies in underdense regions .",
    "in contrast , @xcite , suggest that the blue _ field _ galaxy population at low redshift shows a luminosity - environment trend quite similar to the @xmath3 relation presented in this paper .",
    "evolution such as this could be expected , if as the clustering of the galaxy distribution evolves , the bright blue galaxies in overdense regions at @xmath3 are preferentially quenched , while the faint blue cluster population becomes increasingly numerous from satellites first falling into denser regions .",
    "this evolution at the bright and faint end of the blue population would cause the trend between environment and luminosity along the blue cloud to flatten , thereby explaining the @xmath104 results of @xcite and @xcite .    in future work , we will attempt to clarify the exact physical processes responsible for the quenching of blue , star - forming galaxies by studying the relationship between environment , agn activity , and galaxy morphology within the deep2 data set @xcite . there",
    "the multiwavelength data of the extended groth strip ( egs ) will be invaluable in identifying the agn population , and high - resolution hst / acs imaging will be critical for classifying galaxy morphologies .",
    "in this paper , we present the first study of the relationships between galaxy properties and environment at @xmath3 to cover a broad and continuous range of environment from groups to weakly - clustered field galaxies . using a sample of galaxies drawn from the deep2 galaxy redshift survey , we estimated the local overdensity about each galaxy according to the projected @xmath2-nearest - neighbor surface density .",
    "we study the relationships between environment and galaxy color , luminosity , and [ oii ] equivalent width .",
    "our principal results are :    1 .",
    "we find a strong dependence of mean environment on rest - frame @xmath33 color ( fig .",
    "[ environ_vs_color ] ) , with blue galaxies on average occupying regions of lower density than red galaxies .",
    "the observed trend with galaxy color echoes the results of studies of nearby galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; all features of the global correlation between galaxy color and environment measured at @xmath4 are found to be already in place at @xmath3 .",
    "2 .   for the red galaxy population at @xmath3",
    ", we see clear evidence for a dependence of mean overdensity on luminosity , mirroring results from local studies ( fig .",
    "[ environ_vs_amagbr ] ) .",
    "unlike the sdss , however , deep2 does not probe the faint red galaxy population and includes relatively few luminous red galaxies due to the smaller survey volume , rendering the strongest effects seen locally undetectable .",
    "while low redshift studies find the mean environment of blue galaxies to be independent of luminosity , we find a strong increase in local density with luminosity for blue galaxies at @xmath3 ( fig.[environ_vs_amagbr ] ) .",
    "restricting to the blue field population in the deep2 survey , the dependence of mean overdensity on @xmath34-band luminosity persists , with the mean environment at or below the mean survey density over the luminosity range probed .",
    "4 .   the pair of galaxy properties which best predict environment at @xmath3 are galaxy color and luminosity ( table [ var_tab ] ) .",
    "additionally , while we do measure a modest difference in luminosity dependence for the mean environments of blue and red galaxies , we show that the dependence of environment on @xmath35 and @xmath33 is well represented by a separable function ( fig.[environ_model ] ) .",
    "the mechanisms of ram - pressure stripping , galaxy harassment , and global tidal interactions , which preferentially occur in clusters , can not alone explain the observed relationships between galaxy properties and environment at @xmath3 .",
    "our results are consistent with a downsizing of the characteristic mass or luminosity at which the quenching of a galaxy s star formation becomes efficient .",
    "we discuss how quenching appears to be a process that must operate efficiently in both cluster _ and _ group environments for consistency between our results and those at redshift @xmath4 .",
    "agn heating of cooling gas may satisfy this requirement , however the exact quenching mechanism still remains an open question .",
