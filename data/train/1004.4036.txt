    "the _ swift _ mission ( gehrels et al .",
    "2004 ) , launched in november 2004 to explore the gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) , has provided an excellent opportunity to detect and study the @xmath17-ray activities from known soft gamma repeaters ( sgrs ) as well as to discover new sgrs .",
    "sgrs , belonging to the class of ` magnetars ' ( duncan & thompson 1992 ) , are highly magnetized ( @xmath18 @xmath12 10@xmath19 g ) and slowly rotating ( @xmath20 @xmath12 2@xmath2112 s ) neutron stars characterized by short , bright bursts of hard x - rays and soft @xmath17-rays ( see mereghetti 2008 for a recent review ) . during its active state , an sgr can go through periods of intense bursting activity lasting from a few days to months , however , it can also remain dormant for many years .",
    "the bursts , often varying in duration , are classified into three main categories : short , intermediate and giant flares .",
    "the short bursts are the typical kind observed during an outburst , marked by timescales @xmath12 0.10.5",
    "s and luminosities @xmath12 10@xmath2210@xmath23 ergs s@xmath24 , whereas the intermediate bursts have timescales @xmath12 160  s and luminosities @xmath12 10@xmath2310@xmath25  ergs  s@xmath24 ( mereghetti 2008 ) .",
    "giant flares , the rare and unique events , are distinguished by their extreme energies ( 10@xmath2610@xmath27  ergs  s@xmath24 ) , long durations ( @xmath12 hundreds of seconds ) , and the presence of a coherent pulsating decaying tail , consistent with the spin period of the neutron star .",
    "persistent x - ray emission , interpreted as originating due to the magnetospheric currents driven by twists in the evolving ultra - high magnetic field ( thompson & duncan 1995 ) , has also been observed from sgrs in the 0.110 kev band with a typical x - ray luminosity of @xmath12 10@xmath28 ergs  s@xmath24 , and the spectrum is generally described by an absorbed powerlaw ( pl ) plus a blackbody component ( mereghetti 2008 ) .    according to the magnetar model ( thompson & duncan 1995 ) ,",
    "the dominant form of energy powering an sgr is its decaying ultra - strong magnetic field .",
    "the surface of the neutron star is heated and fractured by instabilities generating alfvn waves that accelerate electrons , and in turn give away their energy in short bursts .",
    "the model also suggests that the high - energy dissipated remains trapped in the magnetosphere as the ` trapped fireball ' , and it shrinks in size with time .",
    "alternatively , the bursts can arise from heating of the corona by magnetic reconnection in the stellar magnetosphere resulting in intermediate - type flares ( lyubarsky 2002 ) .",
    "the giant flares are caused by the sudden rearrangement of the star s magnetic field producing global crustal fractures ( thompson & duncan 1995 ) .    [ cols= \"",
    "< , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]      statistical studies have unveiled some basic properties such as the burst energy injection and radiation mechanisms of the sgrs ( gogus et al .",
    "1999 , 2000 , 2001 ) . in this subsection",
    ", we consider the statistical properties of the sgr 0501 + 4516 bursts .",
    "first , we investigated the fluence distribution of the sgr bursts with duration and estimated the significance of this correlation using the spearman test ( spearman 1904 ) .",
    "the fluences show a strong positive correlation with @xmath29 , with a pl index of 2.0@xmath10.2 as shown in figure 5 .",
    "the spearman rank order test applied to sgr 0501 + 4516 burst fluences and durations yielded a correlation coefficient @xmath30 = 0.9 and the probability ( @xmath20 ) that this correlation is due to a random fluctuation is 3.0@xmath1310@xmath31 corresponding to 95@xmath32 confidence level .",
    "such a correlation has been observed by gogus et al .",
    "( 2001 ) for sgr 1806 - 20 and sgr 1900 + 14 , which was interpreted to be similar to the pl relation between the total energy and duration of the earthquakes established by gutenberg & richter ( 1956 ) .",
    "next , we examined the burst spectral variations with temporal properties to draw comparison to other sgrs . for that , we computed the hardness ratio , defined as hr = ( @xmath33-@xmath34)/(@xmath35 ) , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the background subtracted hard and soft photon counts in the 25150 kev and 1525 kev energy bands , respectively .",
    "figures  6 ( a ) and ( b ) show hr plotted against the burst duration and fluence , respectively .",
    "we clearly see an anti - correlation in both cases and a powerlaw fitted to the data gave indices of @xmath210.20@xmath10.03 and @xmath210.10@xmath10.02 , respectively .",
    "this anti - correlation was further quantified by carrying out the spearman test and we obtain a correlation coefficient of @xmath30 = @xmath210.7 ( @xmath20 = 6.5@xmath1310@xmath36 ) for hr vs. burst durations and @xmath30 = @xmath210.8 ( @xmath20 = 1.8@xmath1310@xmath36 ) for hr vs. burst fluences . we discuss the observed correlations in  [ 5 ] ; a detailed analysis on the spectral evolution in sgr 0501 + 4516 will be presented elsewhere .",
    "we have carried out a comprehensive study of the spectral and temporal properties of the recently discovered sgr 0501 + 4516 .",
    "the observed burst durations in sgr 0501 + 4516 typically range from @xmath12 0.030.5  s and follow a lognormal distribution as seen in the case of other sgrs ( for example , gogus et al .",
    "2001 ; woods et al .",
    "@xmath37 durations of @xmath12 0.093  s and @xmath12 0.162  s were measured for sgrs 1806 - 20 and 1900 + 14 ( gogus et al . 2001 ) , respectively , and @xmath12 0.099  s for the anomalous x - ray pulsar ( axp ) 1e 2259 + 486 ( gavriil et al .",
    "the @xmath29 duration of the bursts observed from sgr 0501 + 4516 showed a lognormal distribution peaking at @xmath12 0.06@xmath10.02  s with an average value of @xmath12 0.16@xmath10.02  s for the 18 bursts .",
    "the short bursts observed from sgr 0501 + 4516 using _",
    "swift_-bat were fitted with 8 spectral models , out of which the single - component cpl and the two - component bb+bb models provided the best fit .",
    "feroci et al .",
    "( 1994 ) also suggested cpl and bb+bb as best - fit models for 10 short bursts from sgr 1900 + 14 observed using _",
    "bepposax _ in the 1.5100 kev energy range .",
    "we have also explored the possible correlations between the spectral and the temporal burst properties in sgr 0501 + 4516 and the implications of these observed features are discussed below in the context of the magnetar model ( thompson & duncan 1995 ) .    as shown in  [ 4.2 ] , the sgr 0501 + 4516 burst fluence follows a powerlaw distribution ( @xmath38 = 2.0@xmath10.2 ; see figure  5 ) with the burst duration .",
    "similar correlations have been found for earthquakes with pl indices ranging from 1.4 to 1.8 ( gutenberg & richter 1956 ; chen et al . 1991 ) and for solar flares with a pl index ranging from 1.53 to 1.73 ( crosby et al .",
    "earthquake - like behaviour for sgrs were first pointed out by cheng et al .",
    "( 1996 ) using sgr 1806 - 20 with a pl index of 1.66 .",
    "the pl relation between the seismic moment ( @xmath8 energy ) and duration was shown by lay & wallace ( 1995 ) , which yielded an index of 3.03 .",
    "gogus et al .",
    "( 2001 ) has also successfully investigated this correlation and obtained a pl index of 1.05@xmath10.16 and 0.91@xmath10.07 for sgr 1806 - 20 and sgr 1900 + 14 , respectively .",
    "this behaviour shown by earthquakes was also interpreted on the basis of self - organized criticality ( bak et al .",
    "1988 ) , providing a framework for understanding complexity and scale invariance in systems showing irregular fluctuations .",
    "self - organized criticality can be considered as a characteristic state of criticality formed by self - organization in a long transient period at the border of stability and chaos with the events following a powerlaw distribution . however",
    ", this theory can not predict the strength or time of the next event ( bak et al .",
    "moreover , we notice that this is the first time the pl index obtained from an sgr matches quite well with those measured in both earthquakes and solar flares , suggesting that sgr bursts are analogous to earthquakes and have both crustal and magnetospheric origins .    we have also investigated the hardness - fluence and hardness - duration correlations for the 18 bursts observed from sgr 0501 + 4516 .",
    "as suggested by other authors , hardness - duration and hardness - fluence anti - correlations are observed , as shown in figures  6 ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively . moreover , as pointed out by gogus et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , we see that the sgr bursts soften with increasing burst durations , the details of which will be presented in a follow - up paper .",
    "the hardness - fluence anti - correlation ( see figure  6 ( b ) ) has been explained by gogus et al .",
    "( 2001 ) as due to the emitting plasma in local thermodynamic equilibrium with the radiative area decreasing at lower fluences , and secondly , due to the spectral intensity of the radiation field being below that of a bb , causing the emitting plasma temperature to remain in a narrow range and higher at lower luminosities .",
    "however , it is also suggested that these two possibilities depend on the rate of energy injection into the atmosphere ( gogus et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "the cut - off energy @xmath2 obtained from the cpl model peaks around @xmath12  19.1@xmath11.8 kev ( figure  4(b ) and table  4 ) , consistent with that obtained using _ konus - wind _ observations ( @xmath2 in the range of 20 - 45 kev ; aptekar et al .",
    "the @xmath0 for sgr  0501 + 4516 is also in good agreement with those obtained for sgr 1900 + 14 and sgr 1806@xmath2120 ( see table  3 of feroci et al . 2004 and tables  9 & 10 of nakagawa et al .",
    "2007 ) . the magnetar model",
    "( thompson & duncan 1996 ) suggests that the nonthermal emission observed in the sgrs originate from the hydromagnetic winds of particles in the magnetosphere and the cut - off energy @xmath2 can be associated with the plasma energy distribution in the magnetosphere .",
    "this contributes to the hard x - ray emission through particle acceleration leading to comptonization and particle bombardment of the surface ( thompson & duncan 1996 ; mereghetti 2008 ) and/or from pairs created higher ( @xmath12100 km ) in the magnetosphere ( thompson & beloborodov 2005 ) .",
    "the spectra of sgr  0501 + 4516 were also well - fitted with a two - component bb model , with the low- and high - bb temperature clustered around 4.6@xmath10.5 kev and 12.8@xmath10.7 kev , respectively ( figure  4 and table  4 ) .",
    "these values are consistent with those reported by enoto et al .",
    "( 2009 ) using _ suzaku _ observations ( @xmath39 = 3.3@xmath40 kev and @xmath41 = 15.1@xmath42 kev ) .",
    "the soft and hard bb component gave a gaussian mean radii @xmath43 = 7.2@xmath11.5  @xmath44 km and @xmath45 = 0.9@xmath10.2  @xmath44  km , respectively .",
    "several lines of interpretation were made to account for the bb+bb emission .",
    "many recent studies have shown that the broadband ( 1100 kev ) spectroscopic studies of short sgr bursts are well approximated by the sum of two blackbodies .",
    "olive et al .",
    "( 2004 ) reported that the time - integrated 2150 kev energy spectrum of an intermediate flare from sgr  1900 + 14 observed with _",
    "was best described by the sum of two bbs with temperatures @xmath12 4.3  kev and @xmath12 9.8  kev .",
    "these results were in line with those obtained for the short bursts from sgrs 1900 + 14 ( @xmath46 @xmath12 3.23  kev and @xmath12 9.65  kev ) and 1806@xmath2120 ( @xmath46 @xmath12 4  kev and @xmath12 11  kev ) by feroci et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and nakagawa et al .",
    "similar results were also reported for the burst spectra of sgr  1900 + 14 and sgr  1627@xmath2141 with temperatures @xmath39",
    "@xmath12 3@xmath215 kev and @xmath41 @xmath12 9@xmath2110 kev ( israel et al .",
    "2008 ; esposito et al .",
    "olive et al .",
    "( 2004 ) interpreted the high - bb component to be arising from a trapped fireball , with the high - bb temperature being consistent with the theoretically predicted temperature of a trapped fireball ( @xmath12 11 kev ) and the low - temperature bb with the constant radius ( almost 30 times larger than the average radius of the fireball ) as originating from the surface of the neutron star .",
    "furthermore , they suggest that the emission regions observed may be due to the radiation transfer effects in a superstrong magnetic field . in addition , these two bb temperatures can be considered as arising from the propagation of ordinary ( o ) and extraordinary ( e ) photons across the magnetosphere , with the photosphere of the e - mode photons located closer to the neutron star surface and the scattering photosphere of the o - mode photons higher up in the magnetosphere as suggested by israel et al .",
    "our results are also consistent with these interpretations based on the magnetar model .    in figure  7 , we have plotted the soft and hard component bb temperatures as a function of the square of their corresponding radii to investigate any possible correlations .",
    "the size of the emitting regions derived from the soft bb temperature , though does not appear to have a constant value , approximates the expected radius of the neutron star and a powerlaw fit to the data yields an index of @xmath212.7@xmath11.2 .",
    "similarly , we fitted a powerlaw to the hard bb temperature and their respective radii , and we obtain a pl index of @xmath215.8@xmath11.0 .",
    "the spearman correlation test gives the following anti - correlation results : @xmath30 = @xmath210.5 ( @xmath20 = 0.06 ) for the soft bb temperature and @xmath30 = @xmath210.7 ( @xmath20 = 0.01 ) for the hard bb temperature .",
    "this clearly demonstrates the existence of a strong anti - correlation between @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "olive et al .",
    "( 2004 ) found a nearly constant radius for the low - bb temperature , independent of the temperature whereas the high - bb temperature showed a clear anti - correlation between the radius and the temperature ( see figure  7 of olive et al .",
    "such a correlation ( @xmath49 @xmath8 @xmath50 ) has been observed for sgr  1900 + 14 by israel et al .",

    "however , from our data on sgr 0501 + 4516 , we notice that the minimum radius of the soft bb overlaps with the maximum radius of the hard bb component , thereby suggesting that a fraction of the e - mode photons can be locally converted to the o - mode by compton scattering and by photon splitting if the effective temperature is high enough ( duncan & thompson 1995 ) .    we have determined the soft and hard bb luminosities ( @xmath54 and @xmath55 ) , and plotted them against each other to explore their correlation .",
    "figure  8 shows the bolometric luminosities of the two bbs for the bursts fitted with the bb+bb model . while feroci et al .",
    "( 1994 ) found a constant ratio for the bolometric luminosities of the bursts , we do not .",

    "the maximum bolometric luminosity obtained for the sgr 0501 + 4516 bursts is for the soft bb component with @xmath54 = 4.1@xmath1310@xmath57 @xmath58  ergs s@xmath24 corresponding to the radius @xmath6 = 14.2  @xmath44  km and temperature @xmath4 = 6.7 kev .",
