    "jets make good probes because their properties in vacuum can be calculated with perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( pqcd ) .",
    "previous results on two - particle azimuthal jet - like correlations have revealed a broadened away - side shape in central au+au collisions relative to _ pp _ , d+au and peripheral au+au collisions , or even double humped @xcite .",
    "the away - side shape is consistent with many different physics mechanisms including : large angle gluon radiation @xcite , jets deflected by radial flow or preferential selection of particles due to path - length dependent energy loss , hydrodynamic conical flow generated by mach - cone shock waves @xcite , and erenkov gluon radiation @xcite .",
    "3-particle correlations can be used to differentiate mechanisms with conical emission , mach - cone and @xmath3erenkov radiation , from the other mechanisms .",
    "additionally , the dependence of the conical emission angle on associated particle @xmath1 can be used to differentiate between mach - cone and qcd - erenkov radiation .",
    "the 3-particle correlation analysis method has been rigorously described in reference @xcite .",
    "results are reported here for trigger particles of @xmath4 gev / c and associated particles of @xmath5 gev / c , except where otherwise noted .",

    "combinatorial backgrounds must be removed to extract the genuine jet - like 3-particle signal .",
    "events are treated as composed of two components , particles that are jet - like correlated with the trigger particle and background particles .",

    "this background is obtained from mixing the trigger particle with a different event of the same centrality .",
