    "furthermore , if the @xmath42-gon is strictly convex , then there is a hyperelliptic involution of @xmath41 fixing @xmath43 , all paths in @xmath41 in direction @xmath44 intersect any boundary component of @xmath45 of @xmath43 , and the return map @xmath46 obtained by moving in direction @xmath44 is an interval exchange on @xmath47 intervals , corresponding to the ` inversive permutation ' @xmath48 .",
    "denote the convex @xmath42-gon representing @xmath41 by @xmath49 . since @xmath41 has genus at least two , @xmath50",
    "let @xmath51 denote the edges of @xmath49 , in cyclic counterclockwise order .",
    "let @xmath52 denote the angle that the edge @xmath53 makes with the horizontal direction where the @xmath53 are oriented so that @xmath49 is on their left .",
    "we consider @xmath52 modulo @xmath54 and write @xmath55 if the short path along the boundary of the circle of directions from @xmath56 to @xmath44 is in the counterclockwise direction .",
    "then convexity ( strict convexity ) is equivalent to @xmath57 ( resp .",
    "@xmath58 ) for all @xmath59 . for each @xmath59",
    "we denote by @xmath60 the index for which @xmath53 and @xmath61 are identified in @xmath41 .",
    "the convex hull of @xmath62 and @xmath63 is a parallelogram in the plane .",
    "denote its sides @xmath64 in the usual order .",
    "this parallelogram maps to a cylinder @xmath43 in @xmath41 , which is simple if and only if the sides @xmath65 and @xmath66 contain no vertices of @xmath49 in their interior .",
    "it is clear from convexity that any path in @xmath41 in direction @xmath67 intersects the boundary edges of @xmath43 , so to prove the first assertion we have only to find @xmath68 for which @xmath43 is simple .",
    "suppose @xmath43 is not simple and suppose with no loss of generality that @xmath65 contains vertices in its interior , then @xmath69 and @xmath70    assume first that @xmath71 , that is an edge of @xmath49 has three consecutive parallel edges . then replacing @xmath68 with @xmath72 ,",
    "we see from that neither @xmath73 nor @xmath74 can contain vertices in their interior , i.e. the parallelogram @xmath75 maps to a simple cylinder in @xmath41 , as required .",
    "now assume @xmath76 .",
    "then the equations @xmath77 imply that the angles @xmath52 assume only the four values @xmath78 , i.e. @xmath49 is a parallelogram .",
    "if it has three consecutive parallel edges we are done as in the previous case . otherwise @xmath79 and in each direction there are two consecutive parallel edges . since there are no spurious vertices on @xmath49 , in this case the gluing must be @xmath80 , and one sees that for any @xmath68 , @xmath81 maps to a simple cylinder , as required .",
    "now suppose @xmath49 is strictly convex . we claim that @xmath82 indeed , if this is not true then ( replacing @xmath68 with @xmath83 and re - indexing cyclically ) we would have for some @xmath84 : @xmath85 on the other hand , since @xmath84 there is some @xmath86 so that both @xmath86 and @xmath87 are in @xmath88 .",
    "this implies @xmath89 contradicting .",
    "the remaining assertions of the proposition follow easily from , where the involution is the symmetry with respect to the center of the parallelogram representing the cylinder @xmath43 .",
    "the following is an immediate consequence :    [ cor : hyperelliptic stratum ] suppose that @xmath41 is a translation surface with a presentation as a strictly convex @xmath42-gon , with @xmath50 .",
    "then :    * all vertices of the @xmath42-gon are singularities for the translation structure . *",
    "if @xmath7 is even then @xmath41 belongs to the hyperelliptic connected component of the stratum @xmath10 where @xmath90 is the genus of @xmath41 . *",
    "if @xmath7 is odd then @xmath41 belongs to the hyperelliptic connected component of the stratum @xmath11 where @xmath91 is the genus of @xmath41 .",
    "it was proved by kontsevich and zorich @xcite that in every connected component of every stratum there is a dense set of surfaces with a one - cylinder presentation .",
    "in particular having a convex presentation places no constraint on the topology of the surface .",
    "corollary [ cor : hyperelliptic stratum ] shows that having a strictly convex presentation does entail a topological restriction .",
    "we will need another consequence of proposition [ prop : central symmetry ] .",
    "[ cor : short saddle connection ] suppose @xmath41 is a translation surface of genus @xmath29 represented by a strictly convex polygon @xmath49 with opposite sides identified , and suppose @xmath43 is a simple cylinder in @xmath41 joining opposite sides of @xmath49 .",
    "let @xmath92 be the saddle connection joining the top and bottom of @xmath43 which is represented by two opposite segments on the boundary of @xmath49 .",
    "then any saddle connection parallel to @xmath92 is longer than @xmath92 , and @xmath41 has no other simple cylinder which is parallel to @xmath43 and contains a diagonal parallel to @xmath92 .",
    "in particular , a surface with a strictly convex presentation does not have a nontrivial translation automorphism .",
    "assume with no loss of generality that @xmath43 is represented by a central square in @xmath49 with opposing vertical edges identified .",
    "since @xmath93 does not cover the entire surface @xmath41 , and since @xmath49 is strictly convex , any vertical saddle connection in @xmath49 must pass through @xmath43 at least once and have endpoints disjoint from the top and bottom edges of @xmath43 ; in particular its length is greater than the height of @xmath43 .",
    "thus , if @xmath94 is another cylinder in @xmath41 which is parallel to @xmath43 , with a diagonal @xmath95 parallel to @xmath92 , the interior of @xmath95 must intersect @xmath43 , that is the interiors of @xmath43 and @xmath94 intersect .",
    "this is not possible for parallel cylinders .",
    "this proves the first assertion , and the second assertion follows by considering the image of @xmath43 under a translation automorphism .",
    "the following simple observation , noted by veech @xcite , is at the heart of our discussion .",
    "its proof is immediate from the definitions and is left as an exercise to the reader .",
    "[ prop : g invariant closed ] let @xmath96 be a connected component of a stratum of translation surface .",
    "then the subsets @xmath97 of @xmath96 consisting respectively of surfaces with no convex ( resp .",

    "as veech showed in @xcite , on a lattice surface , the direction of a core curve of a cylinder is always _ completely periodic _ , all non - critical leaves in that direction are closed .",
    "moreover the @xmath101-orbits of completely periodic directions are in bijective correspondence with the cusps of the quotient @xmath102 , i.e. with conjugacy classes of maximal parabolic subgroups of @xmath101 . in proving that a lattice surface has no convex presentation , our strategy will be to examine the various completely periodic directions on @xmath41 , and show that they can not be the direction of a core curve of a simple cylinder as in proposition [ prop : central symmetry ] .",

    "that is , all motions in the rel leaf except possibly motions in a particular direction destroy convexity .",
    "we proceed to the details .",
    "we take @xmath406 small enough so that it is contained in the neighborhood as in the preceding paragraph .",
    "that is , the notation @xmath407 makes sense in @xmath406 , for @xmath408 , and so does the notation @xmath404 .",
    "it follows from the preceding discussion that @xmath409 is obtained from @xmath410 as follows .",
    "we first subdivide the vertices of @xmath49 into two classes , according to whether they map to the singularity labelled @xmath411 or @xmath412 in @xmath41 .",
    "we then keep the vertices mapping to @xmath411 fixed and move all of the others by adding @xmath413 . connecting the vertices",
    ", this defines a new polygon @xmath414 if @xmath413 is sufficiently small ( and we can assume this by making @xmath406 smaller ) .",
    "we then apply the map @xmath334 to @xmath414 .",
    "the resulting polygon is @xmath415 .    since linear maps in @xmath13 preserve convexity , in order to prove the proposition it suffices to show that for any convex marked decagon @xmath49 , for which @xmath416 , the set of @xmath413 for which @xmath414 is convex , are contained in a one - dimensional linear subspace . to show this",
    ", it suffices to show that for any @xmath49 , there are three or more edges of @xmath49 which are consecutive and parallel , and connect distinct singularities ; for then any rel perturbation @xmath413 which is not in the direction of these edges will result in @xmath414 being non - convex .",
    "e.g. in the last polygon in figure [ marked decagons ] ( a square ) , this occurs in the top and bottom of the figure .",
    "if we move the black points up ( respectively down ) with respect to the white points , convexity will be destroyed at the vertex between edges @xmath113 and @xmath39 ( respectively between @xmath112 and @xmath113 ) in the top of the figure , so any rel operation which does not move points horizontally will destroy convexity .    .",
    "the top row can not appear in @xmath417 . ]",
    "the proof of existence of three parallel consecutive edges proceeds by a case - by - case analysis .",
    "we will show that the only marked decagons which represent surfaces in @xmath1 are those shown in figures [ marked decagons ] and [ marked decagons1 ] .",
    "since , by  [ sec : 9 and 16 ] , surfaces in @xmath417 have no strictly convex presentations , the decagon which is the first polygon in figure [ marked decagons ] does not appear in these eigenform loci .",
    "similarly , the octagon and hexagon in the top row of figure [ marked decagons ] also do not appear in @xmath417 , since they can be made into a strictly convex decagon by a rel perturbation , which would again contradict  [ sec : 9 and 16 ] .",
    "all the other polygons in the figure satisfy our claim .",
    "this will conclude the proof .    .",
    "]    when realized as a convex polygon in the plane , some sides of the marked decagon become parallel .",
    "this gives a partition of the set of edges into subsets of parallel edges , where each subset is composed of some pairs of edges identified in the marked decagon ( but possibly more than one pair ) .",
    "considering the different possibilities for these partitions , one finds the following possibilities :    * a strictly convex decagon . * a strictly convex octagon in which a pair of parallel edges are each a concatenation of two consecutive edges of @xmath49 .",
    "* a strictly convex hexagon in which two pairs of parallel edges are each a concatenation of two consecutive edges of @xmath49 . * a strictly convex hexagon in which a pair of parallel edges are each a concatenation of three consecutive edges of @xmath49 . * a parallelogram in which a pair of parallel edges is each a concatenation of four consecutive edges of @xmath49 . *",
    "a parallelogram in which one pair of parallel edges is each a concatenation of three consecutive edges of @xmath49 , and one pair of parallel edges is each a concatenation of two consecutive edges of @xmath49",
    ".    we will go over these cases one by one and show that all markings which give rise to a surface in @xmath1 appear in figures [ marked decagons ] and [ marked decagons1 ] .",
    "note that the total cone angle around singularities for a surface in @xmath1 is @xmath418 and hence all vertices of the decagon must be singularities of the translation surface .",
    "all indices in the discussion below will be given in cyclic order along the boundary of @xmath49 .",
    "also note that if @xmath419 are consecutive and @xmath252 are consecutive and parallel then we can not glue @xmath257 to @xmath420 and @xmath259 to @xmath421 because then the vertex between @xmath257 and @xmath259 will have cone angle @xmath54 , i.e. will not be a singularity , and we will not be in @xmath1 .",
    "we will call this the _ basic restriction_.    clearly case ( a ) corresponds to the first polygon in figure [ marked decagons ] . in case ( b ) , suppose @xmath419 and @xmath252 are two pairs of consecutive edges whose concatenations are parallel edges of the octagon . if @xmath257 is glued to @xmath421 and @xmath259 to @xmath420 in @xmath49 then we have the second polygon in figure [ marked decagons ] .",
    "the other case is forbidden by the basic restriction . by the same reasoning , in case ( c ) , we can only glue sides as in the third polygon in figure [ marked decagons ] .    in case ( d ) , let the three pairs of consecutive edges be labelled @xmath422 and @xmath423 .",
    "the gluing in figure [ marked decagons ] corresponds to identifying @xmath424 with @xmath425 .",

    "@xmath434 we have the polygon on the left side of figure [ marked decagons1 ] .",
    "so we have dealt with all cases in which @xmath257 is identified with @xmath431 , and by symmetry , when @xmath432 is identified with @xmath421 .",
    "now suppose @xmath257 is identified with @xmath420 and @xmath432 with @xmath426 . by the basic restriction @xmath259 is identified with @xmath431 and @xmath427 with @xmath421 .",
    "then the vertex between @xmath420 and @xmath426 becomes a regular point and we are not in @xmath1 .",
    "the remaining case is @xmath257 identified with @xmath426 and @xmath432 with @xmath420 .",

    "then the discussion reduces to case ( d ) .",
