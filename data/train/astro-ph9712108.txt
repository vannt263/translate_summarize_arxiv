    "standard big bang nucleosynthesis ( sbbn ; @xcite ; @xcite ;  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) predicts that a measurement of the primordial ratio d / h will give the most sensitive constraint on the cosmological baryon to photon ratio , @xmath11 .",
    "using the photon density measured from the temperature of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , we can then obtain the most sensitive constraint on @xmath12 , the cosmological baryon density in units of the critical density , where @xmath13 mpc@xmath14 .",
    "both @xmath11 and @xmath15 are fundamental cosmological parameters , and measurements of d / h in qso absorption systems can determine both to 10% accuracy .",
    "when we compare measurements of the primordial abundances of different light elements , h , d and @xmath7he in particular , we test the sbbn theory predictions . measurements of d / h in different astrophysical sites also constrains the history of star formation in these sites , once the primordial value of d / h is established , because d is totally destroyed ( astrated ) as gas is cycled through and ejected from stars ( @xcite ) .",
    "adams ( 1976 ) first suggested that deuterium could be measured in intergalactic gas clouds through lyman absorption lines in the spectra of distant qsos .",
    "deuterium lyman absorption lines are 82 on the short wavelength side of the corresponding hydrogen lyman lines , but adams notes that d can be detected in only very select absorption systems with simple velocity structure and high neutral hydrogen column density , n(h  i ) @xmath16 2 ( lyman limit systems ) . for high redshifts , @xmath17 , the lyman series is redshifted into the optical , and the lines are accessible to large ground based telescopes .",
    "the lyman absorption lines of d and h , and the lyman continuum absorption of h  i , constrain the column densities of d  i and h  i , and provide a measurement of d  i / h  i. the timescale for h and d ionization equilibrium is very short ( @xmath18 yr ) in the photoionized intergalactic medium ( @xmath19 ) , and we assume the ratio d  i / h  i is identical to d / h throughout this paper ( @xcite ) .",
    "the lyman limit system at @xmath20 towards q19371009 is an ideal site to infer a primordial value for d / h .",
    "the system is very metal - poor , less than 1/100 solar .",
    "deuterium is destroyed as gas is cycled through stars , but metals are produced in the cycle and the system s low metallicity limits the amount of deuterium which could have been destroyed .",
    "the gas in the system also has very low internal velocities , which can limit the amount of kinetic energy input through any high energy phenomena , such as supernovae or gamma ray sources .    in tfb , we presented high resolution spectra of q19371009 , and made the first measurement of d / h in a qso absorption system .",
    "this system has a high total neutral hydrogen column density , log n(h  i ) @xmath21 2 ( burles & tytler 1997a ) , and the corresponding absorption is optically thick throughout the entire lyman series .",
    "the deuterium feature is well determined by its profile in ly@xmath22 , and the column density of d is well constrained .    in this paper",
    ", we advance the methods of tfb to place more robust constraints on d / h in this absorption systems . in section 2",
    ", we describe our new method of constraining d / h , and in section 3 , we discuss the new results . in section 4 , we calculate the abundances for a number of metals and discuss the ionization state of the system . in section 5 , we compare our d / h value to the abundance of d in other sites , and other light elements , and we show that our d / h is probably primordial .",
    "we model the absorption spectrum along the qso line of sight as a finite number of discrete absorbing components .",
    "each component is modeled as a voigt profile ( spitzer 1979 ) , given by three parameters : column density ( n ) , redshift ( @xmath23 ) , and velocity dispersion ( @xmath24 ) . at every wavelength , we sum the optical depth contribution of all absorption line profiles in the model .",
    "the optical depth is converted to a normalized flux , and convolved with the instrumental response .",
    "the model spectrum can then be directly compared to the observed spectrum .",
    "we use the observed spectrum described in tfb .",
    "the tfb analysis was sophisticated since it was the first to simultaneously fit many metal and h lines , and to separate thermal and turbulent contributions to line widths .",
    "however , it also used many assumptions which we now remove .",
    "in tfb , we modeled the absorption system with two d / h components , labeled  blue \" and  red \" .",
    "the strong feature also required a third h  i component ( which contained only 1% of the hydrogen column ) to obtain an adequate fit to the spectrum of the lyman series .",
    "the positions of the two main components were  tied \" to the velocity positions determined from the narrow metal lines which were asymmetric , and well described by these two components .",
    "we fit the model to narrow regions of the spectrum containing only the lyman lines of interest , and did not include absorption from other lines along the line of sight .",
    "d / h was assumed to be equal in both components .",
    "the velocity dispersion of the red d line was determined from the dispersions of the corresponding h and metal lines in the red component .",
    "we found the value of d / h which gave the best fit to the data and the formal @xmath2 errors from the d and h column densities , log(d / h ) = 4.64 @xmath25 0.06 .",
    "we investigated systematic errors due to incorrect continuum placement in the regions of and the lyman limit , and estimated the systematic error @xmath26 log(d / h ) = 0.06 .",
    "the tfb analysis found a consistent model and a well - defined value for the most likely value of d / h .",
    "but its limitations lay in the assumptions and the calculation of confidence levels and the total errors on d / h .      in this paper , we present major improvements in our analytic techniques .",
    "we measure d / h with a variety of models and free parameters .",
    "we add new free parameters to describe the unabsorbed quasar spectrum , which we use to normalize the absorption spectrum .",
    "previously , we treated continuum uncertainties as systematic errors .",
    "the number and velocities of the d / h components are now also free parameters .",
    "we no longer require that the d and h lines have the same velocities as the metal lines .",
    "the d and h line profiles are constrained only by the spectra covering the lyman series lines . to include all the uncertainties from the modeling into the final uncertainty of d / h",
    ", we perform a @xmath4 analysis as a function of d / h .",
    "formerly , we calculated the errors from a quadrature sum of the total column density uncertainties of d and h. by calculating @xmath4 as a function of d / h , we can include the uncertainties from all the free parameters in our models , including the velocity dispersions , velocity positions , continuum levels , and column densities .",
    "the @xmath4 function gives the relative likelihood of all values of d / h versus the best fit value .",
    "the final confidence region can be directly calculated from the @xmath4 function , and can be considered more  comprehensive \" than the uncertainties which we reported before .",
    "the most critical addition to the present analysis is a measurement of the total hydrogen column density , . from our detailed study of the lyman",
    "continuum optical depth ( burles & tytler 1997a ) , we measured = 17.86 @xmath25 0.02 , and we use this constraint for all models .",
    "is much better constrained from the lyman continuum absorption than from the lyman series line profiles , which gave = 17.94 @xmath27 ( tfb ) , where the first error is statistical and the second is systematic . the new provides a very strong constraint for the models , allows us to add more free parameters to the models to test a variety of models and minimize the model fit with respect to d / h .      here",
    "we discuss the new models we have adopted to measure d / h . the absorbers in each model can be placed into one of two groups , depending on their association with the d / h absorption system ( dhas ) .",
    "the first group contains h  i absorbers which will not show d  i ( also labeled  unassociated \" ) , and the second group contains the high column h  i absorbers which show d  i and are associated with the dhas .",
    "we refer to absorbers in the second group as the `` main components '' . for each unassociated absorber , we add three free parameters to the model : one each for n , @xmath24 , and @xmath23 .",
    "each main component shows two lines : one of h  i and the other d  i. we also add one parameter for each line to allow a separation of @xmath24 into t and @xmath28 , because in general @xmath24(h  i ) can differ from @xmath24(d  i ) , but we tie three of the parameters in the two lines : @xmath29 , t(h  i ) = t(d  i ) , and @xmath28(h  i ) = @xmath28(d  i ) . in this paper , we do not use the metal lines to constrain d / h .",
    "the velocity dispersions of the main components are given by @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is temperature in units of @xmath32 k , @xmath33 is the atomic mass , and @xmath24 is in units of . for zero turbulent velocity dispersion ,",
    "we recover the thermal relation for the h  i and d  i lines , @xmath34 . in all models",
    "we require that @xmath35 5000 k in the main components . without this constraint , models which fit the data may include unobserved components with very low t.",
    "the background ionizing radiation is hard enough that the absorbing gas is unlikely to be cooler than a few 10@xmath7 k.    the results depend on assumptions we make when constructing the models .",
    "these assumptions include the number of d / h components , the total number of free parameters , and the spectral regions which we fit .",
    "the total number of free parameters is the sum of parameters of all the absorption components and the free parameters included in the continuum .",
    "for this analysis , we have chosen 7 models , and we measure d / h for each .",
    "we can then compare the best fit values of d / h for each model , and assess the effect of the different assumptions used in each model .",
    "all 7 models include the spectral regions listed in table 1 , the number of d / h components chosen for each model , and the 64 h  i absorbers listed in table 2 .",
    "the models are of three types .",
    "models 1 & 2 are the simplest and include 2 and 3 d / h components , respectively , with no free parameters in the continuum . the continuum is held fixed at the initial placement of the unabsorbed continuum level , which is shown as the solid lines at unity in figure 2 .",
    "the other five models allow for free parameters in the continuum in each region .",
    "the number of allowed continuum free parameters in each region is shown in table 2 .",
    "the final two models have three d / h components , but also allow for hydrogen contamination . in model 6 , an extra hydrogen absorber",
    "is introduced at redshift @xmath36 , which places h  i ly@xmath22 at the position of d - ly@xmath22 , and h  i ly@xmath37 at d - ly@xmath37 . in model 7 , the extra hydrogen absorber is introduced at @xmath38 , which places its at the position of d - ly@xmath37 , in the blue wing of .",
    "the model parameters are summarized in table 3 .",
    "we use the levenberg - marquardt method to minimize @xmath4 ( press et al .",
    "the details of the algorithm and computational techniques are presented in burles ( 1997 ) .",
    "the algorithm iterates until it converges on the best fit model .",
    "the @xmath4 of the final fit is assumed to be the minimum @xmath4 , @xmath39 .",
    "a given model will have @xmath40 free parameters , and the algorithm calculates a @xmath41 covariance matrix for each iteration .",
    "the 1@xmath42 uncertainties can be directly calculated from the diagonal elements in the covariance matrix of the final iteration .",
    "in all the models , we are interested in one parameter specifically , d / h . it is not straight forward to calculate the total uncertainty in d / h from the final covariance matrix directly , even if the errors are normally distributed . due to the intrinsic blending of the h  i and d  i lines , the formal errors in column density are correlated . instead , we choose to make d / h a free parameter in the models , and calculate as a function of the parameter d / h .",
    "we construct a list of d / h values , and model the spectrum for each value in the list . by designating d / h in each model",
    ", we reduce the number of free parameters , @xmath40 , by one for each d / h component in the model . now",
    "each main component ( components which have d absorption ) has only four free parameters : n(h  i ) , @xmath31 , @xmath28 , and @xmath23 .",
    "n(d  i ) is no longer free , but is given by n(d  i ) = n(h  i ) @xmath43 ( d / h ) .",
    "we assume that d / h is the same in all main components .    by constructing an array of as of function of d / h",
    ", we can calculate the most likely value of d / h and the confidence levels surrounding this value .",
    "we have effectively taken a cross section of the @xmath40-dimensional @xmath4 function to calculate the uncertainties of the single parameter , d / h . the one - dimensional function , @xmath44 , yields both the most likely value of d / h , and confidence levels about the most likely value .",
    "figure 1 shows the spectral regions stacked in velocity space .",
    "figure 2 presents each spectral region separately on the vacuum heliocentric wavelength scale .",
    "the unabsorbed qso continuum is now allowed to vary to achieve the best fit .",
    "the qso continuum is modeled by a low - order legendre polynomial , which accounts for smooth variations in the continuum on scales of 100 ( dashed lines in fig .",
    "2 ) . in the data reduction process",
    ", we use legendre polynomials to initially normalize the spectrum to the regions of the spectrum showing no absorption ( solid line at unity in fig .",
    "2 ) . in the forest ,",
    "the continuum is not well defined due to large regions of continuous absorption .",
    "we account for this uncertainty in the continuum in the forest by allowing the coefficients of the legendre polynomials to be free parameters , without bounds , in our models .",
    "therefore , the continuum is no longer fixed to the level on which we can only speculate . in statistical language",
    ", we fit the continuum level with a set of  nuisance parameters \" , which we allow to vary freely to improve the fit , because they are not of primary interest .",
    "we must choose regions of the spectrum to compare to the models .",
    "if we model the entire keck spectrum , the model would include over 1000 lines and over 40,000 pixels . for practical purposes , we can not model the entire spectrum simultaneously , the time required to complete the fitting procedure scales as the number of lines times the number of pixels . also , we want our model to be sensitive to d / h , and not other unrelated features in the spectrum .",
    "therefore , we select regions of the spectrum which include at least one lyman series line of the dhas . in principle , we want to include all lyman series of the dhas , but some lyman series lines are blended with other strong , unassociated absorption lines , and are not included in the selected regions .    in figures 1 & 2",
    ", we show the regions of the spectrum used in the model fitting .",
    "table 1 lists the regions used in our analysis , including the number of pixels and the order of the legendre polynomial used to model the unabsorbed continuum in each region .",
    "the damping wings of the feature absorb over a large wavelength range , therefore the span of the region is much greater than the other individual line regions .",
    "for the higher - order lyman lines , the regions of interest begin to overlap .",
    "the overlapping regions are combined into a single region containing multiple lyman lines and this region is labeled  ly - limit \" .      of the 9 regions , the region ( figure 2a ) has the highest snr per pixel , approximately 75 per 4 pixel .",
    "thus the entire fit is heavily weighted by ly@xmath22 , and the fit is most tightly constrained by the data is in this region .",
    "deuterium can be seen at 5557  , and is composed of 3 components in the model presented here .",
    "the fitted continuum contains 5 free parameters , and is reasonably consistent with our initial estimate of the continuum . only at the red edge",
    "does it begin to diverge significantly . and the overlap between the estimated and the best fit continua lies directly at the feature .",
    "the overlap in this region suggests that the new continuum determination will have little effect in the region .",
    "the region ( figure 2b ) is much smaller than ly@xmath22 .",
    "the flux returns to the continuum much closer to the center of the ly@xmath37 line , and there is no reason to include a larger section around ly@xmath37 .",
    "again , the best fit continuum lies close to the original continuum estimate over the entire region .",
    "the model fit to is not as good as ly@xmath22 , there is under - absorption in two places near d- .",
    "the blue wing of shows under - absorption , but there is a significant increase in the noise over some of these pixels ( @xmath45  ) , which is most likely due to bad columns being rejected in the original ccd images .",
    "the under - absorption on the blueward side of d - is likely due to a hydrogen line ( which is fit in model 7 ) that is blended with the deuterium feature .",
    "we label hydrogen lines which overlap and blend with the deuterium features  contaminating \" hydrogen .",
    "contamination will be discussed thoroughly in section 3.1 , and introduced into our models 6 & 7 .",
    "the models must produce a good fit to all the lyman lines simultaneously .",
    "we show each of the regions separately in fig . 2 to allow a close inspection of the data and model , and to display",
    "how well the model reproduces the observed spectrum .",
    "notice that there are additional absorbers overlapping the main components .",
    "these extra absorbers add free parameters to the fit , and in general , make the model less restrictive .",
    "that is , the parameters determining the main components can not be as tightly constrained when overlapping absorbers are included .    in figure 2i , we show the spectral region with the highest order lyman lines , ly-12 to ly-19 .",
    "the best fit continuum shows a significant difference from the initial estimate . the unabsorbed continuum in this region was difficult to estimate due to the lack of pixels with little or no absorption .",
    "the continuum was originally estimated as a constant flux level passing near the few pixels with the highest flux .",
    "the large amount of absorption in this region did not allow for a better estimate of the unabsorbed continuum initially .",
    "the difference between the best fit continuum ( dotted line ) and the initial continuum ( solid line ) is likely due to the simple approximation of the continuum level during the reduction .",
    "the shape of the best fit continuum is more likely and is a function of the instrumental sensitivity in this region .",
    "there are several regions of the spectrum shown in figure 2 of tfb which have more flux than expected by their model fit . in the models presented here",
    ", this unabsorbed flux is accounted for with the extra hydrogen components and a different continuum .",
    "figure 3 shows the major results of the fitting procedure with the seven models .",
    "table 3 summarizes the d / h measurements for each model .",
    "we performed the @xmath4 minimization procedure for 100 values of d / h over the range @xmath46 log(d / h ) @xmath47 for each of the seven models .",
    "for example , figure 3a shows the results for the 2 component model ( model 1 ) .",
    "the solid dark gray line represents one of the components and the dashed line represents the other .",
    "these graphs show the behavior of the main component parameters as a function of d / h .",
    "the parameters sometimes display discontinuous behavior , which is due to the non - uniqueness of voigt profile fitting .",
    "the @xmath4 minimization has found two equally likely solutions , and this exhibits itself with a discontinuous change in the parameter values .",
    "although the fitted parameters may be non - unique , remains a smooth function of d / h .",
    "the exact parameters which give the best fit are not well - determined , but the , and the d / h are well defined . in this analysis , we can not attempt to model the dhas exactly , but we can still find the relative likelihood for all values of d / h .    we can not model the individual components exactly because of the intrinsic blending of the absorption lines .",
    "but we do find that parameters which include all the components can be measured precisely . in figure 3 , the thick solid line in the column density plot represents the total neutral hydrogen column , .",
    "this is merely the sum of the column densities of all components in a given model at a specific value of d / h .",
    "we find that all seven models give a which is a smooth function of d / h , even though the individual column densities in the models are not . is the quantity subject to the constraint provided by burles & tytler ( 1997a ) , = 17.86 @xmath25 0.02 . for a model which gives an arbitrarily good fit to the spectral regions ,",
    "the best fit will depend only on the agreement with the constraint .",
    "we can measure d / h directly from figure 3 . with a @xmath4 function of one variable ,",
    "the confidence levels are easily determined .",
    "the 95% confidence levels correspond to @xmath48 , where @xmath49 . for each model in figure 3 , we find the minimum of the @xmath4 function and list this value in table 3 .",
    "the 95% confidence levels on d / h are also listed in table 3 , and are shown as vertical dashed lines in figure 3 .",
    "the fitting procedure is not perfect , and we can see in figure 3 that there are deviations from perfectly smooth @xmath4 functions .",
    "the fitting procedure can converge before reaching the absolute minimum @xmath4 , and we estimate that the difference between the absolute minimum and the calculated @xmath4 can be as large as 0.5 .",
    "we take this deficiency into account by setting the 95% confidence levels at @xmath50 .",
    "all of the regions of 95% confidence in figure 3 overlap with the central value of constraint .",
    "the best fit model of d / h must not only provide the best fit to the spectral regions , but must also fit the constraint of . for all models , the values of decrease smoothly with increasing d / h .",
    "n(d  i ) is tightly constrained by d - and d- , so as d / h increases , n(h  i ) must decrease , which gives smoothly varying functions of for each model . in all models ,",
    "the 95% confidence regions on d / h represent the model fits where the constraint is well satisfied .",
    "all seven models give consistent ranges for the 95% confidence regions , as seen in figure 4 .",
    "as expected , the models with more free parameters have larger confidence regions . except for model 6 , which includes hydrogen contamination at ly@xmath22 ,",
    "all models are consistent with @xmath51 or @xmath52 at 67% confidence .",
    "the shape of the functions indicate errors which are normally distributed in log ( d / h ) , and the 67% confidence levels should be one - half of the 95% levels .      in models 6 & 7",
    ", we investigate the effects of hydrogen contamination of the d - lyman lines .",
    "model 6 includes an additional hydrogen absorber at redshift , @xmath53 , which places its lines near the deuterium lines .",
    "figure 3f shows the results of the fitting procedure . for values of log",
    "d / h @xmath54 , the results are identical to model 4 , which did not include contamination . but for lower values of d / h , the contaminating hydrogen absorbs a significant amount of flux at the d - and d - lines , and gives a good fit by keeping nearly constant and lowering n(d  i ) .",
    "although contamination allows for lower d / h as expected , the introduction of an additional absorber with three free parameters does not improve the fit significantly .",
    "this result is in sharp contrast to another d / h system , towards q1009 + 2956 , where contamination significantly improves @xmath4 ( burles & tytler 1997b ) .",
    "we conclude that contamination is not significant in this d / h system for two reasons : ( 1 ) additional parameters for contamination do not improve the @xmath4 fit , ( 2 ) the likelihood of significant contamination drawn from distributions of the forest ( kirkman & tytler 1997 ; lu et al .",
    "1997 ) is small ( c.f . tytler & burles 1997 , tfb , @xcite , steigman 1994 ) .",
    "model 7 includes contamination at the position of d- , at @xmath55 .",
    "this redshift is much lower than the dhas , and the hydrogen absorber only affects d- . the extra absorber is initially placed at the center of d- , and is allowed to freely move to achieve the best fit to the data .",
    "the fit improves by @xmath56 , as the hydrogen absorber fills in the under - absorption seen in figure 2b .",
    "the best fit for model 7 is shown in figure 5 , and the improvement is easily seen upon comparison with figure 2b .",
    "the model shows under absorption in three pixels near 4689 (-60 km / s blueward of h- ) , but these pixels fall in a region of spectra with increased noise . in conclusion",
    ", we find model 7 is consistent with the results from the other models which did not include this contamination and the measurement of d / h is robust with any extra hydrogen absorption at alone .    the presence of contamination will give an overestimate of d / h .",
    "therefore , the upper limit on d / h is robust and not affected by the presence of contamination .",
    "all seven models are consistent with the upper limit , d / h @xmath3 .",
    "the metal absorption lines associated with the dhas were analyzed by tfb .",
    "we use the two component fit ( @xmath57 ) of tfb to measure the column densities of the ions shown in table 4 .",
    "if no feature is detected at the expected positions of the ionic transitions , then we place a 2@xmath42 upper limit on the total column density .",
    "more absorption components could be used to describe the metal lines in this dhas , but the qualitative results will remain unchanged .",
    "we used the program cloudy ( ferland 1993 ) , with an ionizing background spectrum calculated by haardt & madau ( 1996 ) , to calculate the ionization state of the gas in each component .",
    "table 5 shows the metallicities , temperatures , ionization parameter , and total hydrogen density in each component calculated from the cloudy simulations .",
    "the equilibrium temperatures calculated from the cloudy simulations can be directly compared to the temperatures determined from the velocity dispersions of the h , c and si lines . in the blue component , we find a good agreement between the temperatures shown in table 4 .",
    "but in the red component the cloudy equilibrium temperature is smaller than the temperature determined from the relative line widths , including @xmath28 .",
    "this may indicate another component near the velocity position of the red component .",
    "the cloudy simulations did not give an acceptable fit to all ions of si in the red component . a single phase of photoionization could not account for the three column densities observed , and the calculated [ si / h]@xmath58 came from si  ii and si  iii alone .",
    "we excluded si  iv for two reasons : ( 1 ) si  iv(1393 ) is blended with a c  iv(1550 ) at @xmath59 , and ( 2 ) it is likely that there is another component of higher ionization that contributes to si  iv .",
    "we have not attempted to model the metal lines with more than two components .",
    "although the column densities of the individual components would differ , the derived metallicities of the components would not greatly differ from the results shown in table 5 .",
    "all components would have a metallicity below 1/100 solar , independent of the model used .",
    "we can now test the tfb assumption that the h and d lines were at the velocities of the c and si metal lines .",
    "in general , this assumption adds a systematic error to the measurement if the metal lines are not aligned with the h  i and d  i lines .",
    "this dhas is rather unique , because all the metal lines , with different ionizations , show similar velocity structure . in figure 3 ,",
    "the velocity positions of the blue and red components used by tfb lie at @xmath60 respectively . in our models with three or four components ,",
    "two of the components lie near the velocity positions of the metal lines , with considerable variation , depending on d / h .",
    "but in the two component models , the component separation for the most likely d / h is 19 , rather then 15 , and the red hydrogen component is at a higher velocity position for all values of d / h .",
    "this shows that a systematic offset in the red component was introduced in the analysis in tfb by assuming that the h and d lines fell precisely at the metal line positions in the two component model .",
    "it is difficult to translate this velocity offset into a d / h change because , as seen in figure 3 , many other coupled parameters are involved .",
    "we have measured the deuterium abundance in the dhas at @xmath61 towards q19371009 . within the statistical uncertainties ,",
    "we conclude that this is the primordial value of d / h produced by big bang nucleosynthesis ( reeves et al .",
    "1973 ; @xcite ) .",
    "this absorption system is young ( @xmath62 gyr ) and very metal poor ( [ x / h ] @xmath63 ) .",
    "these characteristics place strong constraints on stellar astration of deuterium independent of initial mass functions and star formation rates ( jedamzik & fuller 1997 ; @xcite ) . to astrate significant amounts of deuterium , high mass stars would overproduce cno and si , and low mass stars would not have time to complete their evolution . with no post - bbn processes to create or destroy deuterium ,",
    "our measured value of d / h must represent the primordial value .",
    "due to its importance in the standard cosmological model , d / h has been measured in many astrophysical sites . in the local interstellar medium ,",

    "the next best candidate system to measure d / h , @xmath70 towards q0014 + 8118 , was shown to have an interloping hydrogen cloud within 10 of the expected position of deuterium ( tytler et al .",

    "many groups have discussed the significance of deuterium in galactic chemical evolution , and have used simple models to calculate the abundance ratio , d / h , as a function of time and metallicity ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in the past , deuterium evolution was required in order to extrapolate the ism and pre - solar nebula measurements of d / h back in time , and back to zero metallicity , to constrain the primordial d / h value .",
    "but now the problem can be inverted , we can use the values of primordial d / h , pre - solar d / h , and the ism d / h to constrain models of chemical evolution , deuterium astration as a function of time and metallicity , and the fraction of baryons which have been cycled through stars in the solar neighborhood .",
    "the ratio of the ism and primordial values gives an astration factor in the local ism , @xmath73 so we can make the simple statement that one - half of the gas in the local ism has been cycled through stars .",
    "this fraction can be used to place new limits on the stellar initial mass function and the amount of inflow and/or outflow in the local ism .",

    "the abundance yield of deuterium is a single - valued function of @xmath11 , and using output from the kawano bbn code ( @xcite ) , we find @xmath74 where the first error is the statistical uncertainty in the d / h measurement , and the second error represents the statistical uncertainty in the nuclear cross - sections ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that the magnitude of the measurement errors are comparable to the errors in the sbbn calculations .",
    "if we use the present - day photon density determined from the cobe firas measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb , @xcite ) , we can directly calculate the present - day baryon density @xmath75 where the error includes both uncertainties in @xmath11 .",
    "this value for the baryon density agrees with recent estimates of @xmath76 from observations of the cmb power spectrum , the intergalactic medium at @xmath77 , and rich galaxy clusters at @xmath78    the power spectrum of anisotropies in the cmb determines @xmath15 at the epoch of decoupling , @xmath79 ( hu & white 1996 ) .",
