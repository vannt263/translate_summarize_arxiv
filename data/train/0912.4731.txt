    "discovering the higgs boson is of the utmost importance for the lhc .",
    "the most difficult discovery region is when the higgs mass is below about @xmath1 gev , where only rare decays , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , have historically been considered discovery modes .",
    "recently , ref .",
    "@xcite developed an intriguing technique to recover the dominant mode , @xmath4 , in the kinematic region where the higgs is boosted . a boosted particle that decays visibly in the detector leads to large transverse momentum ( large @xmath5 ) where standard model backgrounds are smaller .",
    "for boosted particles with hadronic decays , the large transverse momentum of the decay products can cause what would otherwise be two separate jets to appear in the detector as a single `` fat jet '' . by `` fat jet '' we are referring to a jet with substructure consistent with that coming from a massive particle decay . for boosted particles that decay to @xmath0 , the jet substructure can contain two @xmath6-tagged subjets , which further reduces the background .",
    "amazingly , jet substructure techniques can achieve a theoretical significance up to @xmath7 for an integrated luminosity of @xmath8  fb@xmath9 at lhc @xcite .",
    "this has also very recently been validated by a realistic simulation done by the atlas collaboration , achieving significance nearly this high @xcite .",
    "jet substructure is itself insufficient to identify candidate higgs events from the plethora of standard model backgrounds in the absence of something triggerable .",
    "@xcite relied on higgs production in association with an electroweak gauge boson , @xmath10 , @xmath11 with the @xmath12 or @xmath13 decaying to leptons .",
    "the lepton(s ) provide crucial triggering for the candidate events and a powerful discriminator against qcd backgrounds .",
    "in this paper we consider the possibility that physics beyond the standard model , or simply `` new physics '' , is itself a substantial source of boosted higgs decaying - to-@xmath0 production .",
    "there are several reasons to think this is very promising : new physics can appear through qcd production , with a rate much larger than electroweak production .",
    "new physics can consist of particles significantly heavier than the higgs boson , so that decays to the higgs can , on average , lead to large boosts for every higgs candidate event . finally , new physics can have distinct triggerable collider signatures , some of which the lhc detectors are already designed to search , such as large missing energy @xmath14 .",
    "so , this paper assumes new physics has already been discovered and there is a distinctive enough signature of new physics to reliably separate out one or more `` new physics event samples '' that are reasonably pure .",
    "we then consider the region of high @xmath5 , where we expect a near pristine new physics event sample with negligible standard model background .",
    "this region has one very important advantage : since detector resolution scales as @xmath15 , going to high @xmath5 necessarily means we look into a region where detectors perform particularly well , e.g. , jet energy smearing is minimized . within each event sample",
    ", we propose to carry out a boosted - higgs - via - jet - substructure search .",
    "we find , in some circumstances , the higgs can be _ discovered _ within a jet - substructure - tagged search of new physics event samples well before conventional higgs search analyses reach comparable statistical significance .",
    "we demonstrate the effectiveness of higgs discovery using supersymmetry as our example of new physics .",
    "while our technique is completely general and model - independent , it is particularly well suited to the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "this is because the lightest higgs boson in the mssm has @xmath16  gev ( e.g.  @xcite ) when superpartners are below about 1  tev .",
    "secondly , the lightest higgs in supersymmetry decays dominantly to @xmath0 , exactly the mode we are searching for .",
    "finally , supersymmetry has a plethora of new particles that are at or beyond the electroweak scale .",
    "some of these particles can decay into the higgs , and in some instances , with a fairly large branching fraction .",
    "nevertheless , we stress that our methodology is model - independent . for every sample of clean ( nearly background - free ) new physics events , a boosted higgs via jet substructure should be performed . whether the search is successful depends on a convolution of the new physics scenario as well as the detector performance .",
    "important details of the new physics model include the total cross section of new physics , the fraction of new physics produced that can be cleanly separated from standard model backgrounds , the fraction of this sample that has higgs bosons resulting from new heavy particle decays , and the fraction of these higgs bosons that are boosted .",
    "important detector performance details include the @xmath6-tag efficiency , which includes tagging a jet as well as subjets , the jet energy resolution , fake rates , and so on .",
    "a boosted higgs boson has high transverse momenta @xmath17 .",
    "when the higgs decays to @xmath0 , this high transverse momenta causes the @xmath6-jets to be highly collimated . conventional search strategies to identify the higgs through the reconstruction of two separate singly @xmath6-tagged jets generally fails since it is much more likely for the @xmath6-jets to be merged into a single jet .",
    "going to smaller cone size would seem prudent , except that this has been shown to give poor mass resolution @xcite .",
    "instead , we exploit the recently developed technique to identify subjets within a `` fat jet '' consistent with the decay of a higgs to @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "identifying subjets inside a fat jet that resulted from the decay of a massive particle is not straightforward .",
    "jet mass , determined by some algorithmic prescription applied to the subjets , is one indicator .",
    "however , the distribution that results from ordinary qcd production still has a long tail into high jet masses . for a jet with transverse momentum @xmath5 , jet mass @xmath18 , and cone size @xmath19 ,",
    "the leading order differential qcd jet mass distribution goes as @xcite @xmath20 the challenge is thus to reduce the qcd jet background without losing significantly in mass resolution .",
    "further , when a jet with substructure is identified , we also need to determine the `` heavy particle neighborhood ''  the region to which qcd radiation from the higgs decay products is expected to be confined .",
    "analysis of jet substructure has received considerable attention .",
    "distinct algorithms have been proposed to identify higgs decaying to @xmath0 @xcite , fully hadronic decays of top @xcite , and even neutralinos decaying to three quarks @xcite .",
    "@xcite have also recently introduced a more general `` pruning '' procedure based on jet substructure to more easily discover heavy particles .",
    "our work employs a modified version of the iterative decomposition algorithm introduced by ref .",
    "@xcite , which uses an inclusive , longitudinally invariant cambridge / aachen ( c / a ) algorithm @xcite .",
    "the starting point to test our algorithm , both for new physics and sm background processes , is a set of final ( post - showering and hadronization ) particles .",
    "we generate signal events using pythia v6.4  @xcite , while the background events are first generated at parton - level using alpgenv13  @xcite .",
    "we use pythia v6.4 for showering and hadronization of all events .",
    "we also use the atlas tune  @xcite in pythia to model the underlying event .",
    "we do not perform any detector simulation or smearing of jets .",
    "a realistic atlas / cms specific search in the spirit of ref .",
    "@xcite is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "however , since high @xmath5 jets result in a large amount of energy deposited in the calorimeter cells where energy resolution is excellent , we do not expect smearing to significantly modify our results .",
    "we group the hadronic output of pythia into `` cells '' of size @xmath21 .",
    "we sum the four momentum of all particles in each cell and rescale the resulting three - momentum such as to make the cells massless @xcite .",
    "if the cell energy is bigger than @xmath22  gev , the cells become the inputs to the jet algorithm .",
    "we use the inclusive c / a algorithm as implemented in fastjet  @xcite to cluster the input cells in jets with @xmath23 . as we are trying to identify the higgs through its decay to bottom quarks ,",
    "the @xmath6-tag efficiency is paramount . for simplicity we work with a flat @xmath24 acceptance , with a corresponding fake rate of @xmath25 .",
    "our algorithm is as follows :    1 .",
    "the decomposition procedure starts with a @xmath6-tagged jet @xmath26 . after undoing its last stage of clustering ,",
    "the two subjets @xmath27 and @xmath28 are labeled such that @xmath29 .",
    "2 .   following ref .",
    "@xcite , subjets are checked for the existence of a significant mass drop ( @xmath30 ) as well as non - existence of an asymmetry defined by @xmath31 .",
    "we use @xmath32 and @xmath33 identical to ref .",
    "both subjets are required to be @xmath6-tagged and the @xmath5 of the daughter jet @xmath26 greater than @xmath8  gev .",
    "if these conditions are satisfied , this stage of clustering ( say , @xmath34-th ) is recorded and then the following is calculated : @xmath35 the quantity @xmath36 is an indicator of the similarity of the two subjets and is weighted by their separation @xmath37 .",
    "3 .   replace @xmath26 by @xmath27 and repeat from step  @xmath22 as long as @xmath26 has further subjets .",
    "4 .   select the stage of clustering for which @xmath36 is the largest .",
    "we anticipate that the two @xmath6-tagged subjets , at this stage , are most likely to have originated from higgs decay since they are more likely to be similar to each other .",
    "if the two c / a @xmath6-tagged subjets originate from higgs decay , the subjets with opening angle @xmath37 should contain all the perturbative radiation from the @xmath0 system by virtue of angular ordering @xcite .",
    "however , the subjets still tend to include too much contamination from underlying events .",
    "we then filter @xcite the events : we cluster the jet constituents again using a finer angular scale specific to the jet [ we use , @xmath38 and retain only the three hardest components @xmath39 .",
    "finally , we combine the three subjets and call the result a `` candidate higgs jet '' .",
    "we now demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm for one particularly interesting example of new physics , the minimal supersymmetric standard model .",
    "one of the most promising regions of parameter space with large associated higgs production occurs when the next - to - lightest supersymmetric particle ( nlsp ) is a neutral higgsino and the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) is the gravitino @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider two sets of supersymmetric parameters , given in app .",
    "[ spectrum - app ] .",
    "the first set , `` point 1 '' , follows ref .",
    "@xcite with a higgsino nlsp and gravitino lsp .",
    "point 1 is , not surprisingly , quite favorable to our analysis , with nearly one higgs boson produced in association with every pair of superpartners produced .",
    "it represents the incredible power of this analysis to reach high significance of light higgs discovery with relatively low luminosity at lhc .",
    "the second set , `` point 2 '' , still contains a gravitino lsp , but a bino lsp .",
    "this point is seemingly much less favorable to our analysis , with only about 4% of superpartner pair production containing a higgs boson from nlsp decay .",
    "nevertheless , we will see that the higgs signal can even be found here . with visible signals with just @xmath40 of new physics production",
    ", our methodology clearly has the potential to much wider applicability within the vast supersymmetric parameter space ( already in progress in ref .",
    "@xcite ) as well as applied to other models of new physics .    at first glance",
    "one might think that these two points seems rather specific and not particularly general , even for supersymmetry .",
    "however , a gravitino lsp is an automatic consequence of a low supersymmetry breaking scale .",
    "lep ii bounds from the search for higgsino - like charginos implies @xmath41 gev , and tevatron bounds from the lack of observation of inclusive @xmath42 implies @xmath43 somewhat heavier than this @xcite .",
    "the decay of a nlsp into the higgs is thus essentially always kinematically open .",
    "more typical neutralino mixing suggests that the nlsp is partly higgsino and partly bino , the mixture determined by the ratio of the higgsino mass to bino mass , @xmath44 .",
    "this implies the nlsp could decay into @xmath45 , @xmath13 , or @xmath46 depending on supersymmetric parameters .",
    "our choices of `` point 1 '' and `` point 2 '' , provide two particularly interesting examples into this parameter space .    in both points 1 and 2 ,",
    "several clean new physics event samples exist .",
    "the most distinctive event sample at the lhc is @xmath42 , which would provide the clearest first evidence for physics beyond the standard model .",
    "only relatively mild cuts on the photon energy and the total missing transverse energy are necessary to eliminate the sm background .",
    "right behind this discovery will be a larger sample of @xmath47 events , and with suitable cuts , that we explain in detail below , provide another clean new physics event sample with associated higgs production .",
    "colored superpartners are taken to be 750 gev for both points .",
    "this is well outside the sensitivity of tevatron searches and yet well within lhc capabilities with order fb@xmath9 integrated luminosity .",
    "our goal is find higgs bosons produced from nlsp decay , and so we are interested in inclusive superpartner production , @xmath48 where @xmath49 can be jets and/or leptons resulting from the superpartner decay chains .",
    "we choose to focus on @xmath47 as the primary discrimant of signal from background , but other signal samples such as @xmath50 may well be more appropriate in other regions of parameter space . for both of the points ( c.f .",
    "[ spectrum - app ] ) , the dominant source of superpartner production is first and second generation squark production . to gain some idea of the amount of signal we are working with for points ( 1,2 ) :",
    "the branching fraction to @xmath51 is about ( @xmath52,@xmath40 ) ; the fraction of boosted higgs bosons is about ( @xmath53,@xmath54 ) ; this leads to a cross section for boosted @xmath51 of about ( @xmath55,@xmath56 ) pb .    to simulate the supersymmetric signal , we use pythia v6.4 @xcite to generate parton level events with subsequent showering and hadronization .",
    "we assume the lhc is operating at @xmath57  tev , however our results follow quite well for lower energies that we have also simulated , including @xmath58  tev .",
    "we take leading order cross sections for squark and gluino production , however note that the k - factors can be sizeable @xcite .",
    "we select events that have at least one hard and isolated photon , at least one @xmath6-jet with high @xmath5 , and have large missing energy : @xmath59 for simplicity , we have taken the cuts to be identical for both points despite the fact that further optimization in significance can be achieved by tuning the cuts .",
    "more details of the effects of varying cuts will be presented in ref .",
    "@xcite .         to be conservative",
    ", we take the photon identification efficiency to be @xmath60 , with a jet - fakes - photon rate of @xmath61 .",
    "can actually be obtained in atlas with photon identification efficiency of @xmath60  @xcite . ]",
    "we then run our higgs - finding algorithm on the event sample that survives the cuts listed in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cut - level1 ] ) .",
    "roughly one in four events with a higgs boson pass this cut .",
    "the output of the algorithm contains candidate higgs jets .",
    "we show the result of our algorithm in fig .",
    "[ fig : results ] .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : results ] , the shaded region labeled susy contains many `` candidate higgs jets '' that are not , in fact , from higgs decay .",
    "instead , we must look for features in the @xmath0 invariant mass distribution , and it is here that one of the great advantages of using jet substructure becomes manifest : the clear identification of a higgs peak in both points ! in both points , neutralinos that decay to @xmath62 also pass our cuts .",
    "the @xmath13 peak is easily visible in point 2 , while in point 1 it forms merely an extended shoulder towards lower invariant jet mass . for point 2 ,",
    "both the @xmath13 and @xmath45 peaks are clearly evident , illustrating the importance of the high energy resolution attained using jet substructure .- jets completely misses the higgs peak in point 2 . ]",
    "the smaller feature near @xmath63-@xmath64  gev in both plots is due to hadronic top decay where either a mistag or cabbibo - suppressed @xmath65 decay resulted in two @xmath6-tagged jets in the same initial fat jet .    in this analysis",
    "the major standard model background is @xmath66 where one of the jets fakes an isolated photon .",
    "the @xmath66 background is modeled as the sum of leading order @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 jet samples with total cross section @xmath70  pb .  jets . ]",
    "further reducible and irreducible standard model backgrounds , such as @xmath71 @xcite , are negligible after applying eq .",
    "( [ eq : cut - level1 ] ) and a @xmath6-tag .",
    "the @xmath72 refers to @xmath73 or more jets ; we find that exclusive processes with two or fewer jets do not contain enough hard objects to fake our signal .",
    "we can make a crude estimate of the significance of the higgs peak for each point where all sm events and continuum supersymmetric events are counted as background .",
    "the supersymmetric continuum is simply derived by connecting the histograms between @xmath74  to  @xmath75 bins on either side of the higgs peak in point 1 ( 2 ) with a straight line ; all events in the lower trapezoid are the background , while the event above are the higgs signal .",
    "this procedure yields a significance @xmath76 for points ( 1,2 ) as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : results ] . adjusting the cuts , either by hardening the photon @xmath77 requirement or by adding",
    "a cut on the scalar @xmath77 sum , @xmath78  gev , can increase this slightly .",
    "remarkably , with as little as a few fb@xmath9 , a light higgs with mass @xmath79  gev could be discovered in the new physics event sample if the branching fraction to higgs bosons is order one .",
    "similarly , with just @xmath80  fb@xmath9 , strong evidence of a light higgs can appear in new physics scenarios where only about @xmath40 of the new physics event sample contains a higgs at all !    by comparison , conventional cut - based searches for higgs bosons in @xmath81 require integrated luminosity @xmath82  fb@xmath9  @xcite . by combining channels and using sophisticated optimization",
    ", the discovery luminosity can be brought down closer to @xmath80  fb@xmath9  @xcite , still well above the result of our simple analysis .",
    "obviously this comparison is blatantly unfair because the atlas / cms studies include a complete detector simulation .",
    "nevertheless , we do think it is intriguing that comparably high levels of ( theoretically - derived ) significance are possible with this methodology .",
    "we have demonstrated that higgs bosons produced copiously with distinctive superpartner production can be easily found with a jet substructure analysis .",
    "moreover , we have also shown that a higgs feature in the jet invariant mass distribution can be seen with only a few percent of superpartner production containing a higgs .",
    "this goes far beyond what conventional supersymmetric analyses , e.g.  refs .",
    "@xcite have achieved .",
    "we are now well underway simulating even more general mssm models with or _ without _ a gravitino lsp , and our preliminary results suggest we can still easily identify the higgs in the new physics event sample .",
    "details will be presented in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we can not overemphasize enough that our study using supersymmetry as new physics was nothing more than a convenient example , and our methodology can be applied to many models of new physics observable at the lhc . indeed , any new physics model that has a distinctive signal ( identified clearly from sm background ) as well as associated higgs production ( with the higgs decaying some of the time to @xmath0 ) can benefit from our proposal",
    ". it would be very interesting to consider new physics event samples from little higgs models or universal extra dimension models with associated higgs production .    finally , given the remarkable progress of dark matter direct detection experiments , there is a huge opportunity for nuclear recoils to be seen in the near future .",
    "many models of new physics with dark matter have a leading - order elastic - scattering cross section dominated by the exchange of a light higgs boson . if dark matter direct detection is observed consistent with elastic scattering , the techniques and methodology presented here becomes of exceptional importance to rapidly determine the connections between new physics , higgs physics , and dark matter .",
    "perhaps the most exciting prospect is that this technique could unite the origin of electroweak symmetry breaking with new physics with dark matter !",

    "<S> we exploit the recently developed techniques for discovering a boosted higgs using jet substructure . </S>",
    "<S> our requirements of new physics are quite general : there must be features in the new physics event sample that allow a clean separation from standard model background , and there should be higgs bosons produced in association with the new physics . </S>",
