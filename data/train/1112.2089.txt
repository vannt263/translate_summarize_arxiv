    "the herapdf1.0 parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) were extracted using the combined inclusive cross section data from the h1 and zeus collaborations taken at the hera collider during the hera - i running period 1992 - 1997  @xcite .",
    "these data come from neutral and charged current interactions from both @xmath1 and @xmath2 scattering .",
    "the combination of the h1 and zeus data sets takes into account the full correlated systematic uncertainties of the individual experiments such that the total uncertainty of the combined measurement is typically smaller than @xmath3 , for @xmath4  gev@xmath5 , and reaches @xmath6 , for @xmath7  gev@xmath5 .",
    "these pdfs have been updated to herapdf1.5 ( see lhapdfv6.8.6 , http : projects.hepforge.org / lhapdf ) by including a new preliminary combination of the hera inclusive cross section data from the hera - ii running period 2003 - 2007  @xcite .",
    "these data have greater accuracy at high @xmath8 and high @xmath9 than the hera - i data and thus they serve to decrease the pdf uncertainty in these kinematic regions . in this presentation",
    "we discuss the extension of the herapdf1.5 analysis to include inclusive jet data . the new pdf set which results is called herapdf1.6  @xcite .",
    "the jet data included in herapdf1.6 are : two sets of high-@xmath8 inclusive jet production data from zeus  @xcite , low-@xmath8 inclusive jet data from h1  @xcite and normalised high-@xmath8 inclusive jet data from h1  @xcite .",
    "the gluon pdf contributes only indirectly to the inclusive dis cross sections .",
    "however , the qcd processes that give rise to scaling violations in the inclusive cross sections , namely the qcd - compton ( qcdc ) and boson - gluon - fusion ( bgf ) processes , are observed as events with distinct jets in the final state provided that the energy and momentum transfer are large enough .",
    "the cross section for qcdc scattering depends on @xmath10 and the quark pdfs . for hera kinematics , this process dominates the jet cross section at large scales , where the quark densities are well known from the inclusive cross - section data , so that the value of @xmath10 may be extracted without strong correlation to the shape of the gluon pdf .",
    "the cross section for the bgf process depends on @xmath10 and the gluon pdf so that measurements of jet cross sections also provide a direct determination of the gluon density .",
    "perturbative qcd predicts the @xmath8 evolution of the parton distributions , but not the @xmath9 dependence .",
    "parton distributions are extracted by performing a direct numerical integration of the dglap equations at nlo ( nnlo fits are discussed in the presentation of radescu ) .",
    "a parametrised analytic shape for the parton distributions is assumed to be valid at some starting value of @xmath11 . for the herapdf the value @xmath12gev@xmath5 is chosen such that the starting scale is below the charm mass threshold , @xmath13 .",
    "then the dglap equations are used to evolve the parton distributions up to a different @xmath8 value , where they are convoluted with nlo coefficient functions to make predictions for the structure functions .",
    "the heavy quark coefficient functions are calculated in the general - mass variable - flavour - number scheme of @xcite , with recent modifications  @xcite .",
    "the heavy quark masses for the central fit were chosen to be @xmath14gev and @xmath15gev and the strong coupling constant was fixed to @xmath16 .",
    "the predictions are then fitted to the combined hera data sets for nc and cc @xmath17 and @xmath18 scattering .",
    "a minimum @xmath8 cut of @xmath19  gev@xmath5 was imposed to remain in the kinematic region where perturbative qcd should be applicable .    for the jet data the nlo cross - sections",
    "are made using nlojet++  @xcite but such calculations are too slow to be used in an iterative qcd fit hence the programme fastnlo  @xcite is used to make these calculations by convoluting pre - calculated weights with the pdfs and @xmath20 .",
    "the fit parameters are those necessary to specify the input analytic shape . just as for herapdf1.0 and 1.5 the valence quark distributions @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and the @xmath23-type and @xmath24-type anti - quark distributions @xmath25 , @xmath26 ( @xmath27 , @xmath28 )",
    "are parametrised at the input scale @xmath29gev@xmath5 by the generic form @xmath30 the parametrisation for the gluon distribution @xmath31 is extended , in comparison to the herapdf1.5 nlo parametrisation , to include a term @xmath32 , such that the nlo gluon may become negative at low @xmath9 and low @xmath8 ( however it does not do so in the kinematic region of the hera data ) .",
    "a further significant extension of the parametrisation is that the low-@xmath9 valence parameters , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are no longer set equal .",
    "otherwise the choice of central parametrisation is as for the published herapdf1.0(1.5 ) fits .",
    "briefly , the normalisation parameters , @xmath35 , are constrained by the quark number sum - rules and momentum sum - rule .",
    "the @xmath36 parameters @xmath37 and @xmath38 are set equal , @xmath39 , such that there is a single @xmath36 parameter for the sea distributions .",
    "the strange quark distribution is expressed as @xmath9-independent fraction , @xmath40 , of the @xmath24-type sea , @xmath41 at @xmath42 . the value @xmath43 would render the @xmath44 and @xmath24 quark densities the same , but the value @xmath45 is chosen to be consistent with determinations of this fraction using neutrino - induced di - muon production .",
    "the further constraint @xmath46 , together with the requirement @xmath39 , ensures that @xmath47 as @xmath48 .",
    "for the central fit only the @xmath21 pdf has non - zero @xmath49 and @xmath50 parameters .",
    "the experimental uncertainties on the herapdf are determined using the conventional @xmath51 tolerance , @xmath52 , for @xmath53c.l .",
    "however model uncertainties and parametrisation uncertainties are also considered .",
    "the choice of the heavy quark masses is varied in the ranges , @xmath54gev and @xmath55gev .",
    "the choice of @xmath56 is varied in the range , @xmath57 , and the choice of the strangeness fraction is varied in the range , @xmath58 . the difference between the central fit and the fits corresponding to model variations of @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath40 , @xmath56",
    "are added in quadrature , separately for positive and negative deviations , to represent the model uncertainty of the herapdf1.6 set .",
    "parametrisation variations for which the @xmath49 and the @xmath50 parameters for all the pdfs are freed one at a time are considered and variation of the starting scale @xmath42 in the range , @xmath61gev@xmath5 , is also considered as parametrisation variation . the difference between these parametrisation variations and the central fit is stored and an envelope representing the maximal deviation at each @xmath9 value is constructed to represent the parametrisation uncertainty .",
    "[ fig : jetnojetfrac ] compares the herapdf1.6 nlo fit including the jet data ( right ) to a the herapdf1.5f nlo fit which does not include these data ( left ) .",
    "note that the herapdf1.5f fit differs from the publically available herapdf1.5 nlo fits in that it has the same flexible parametrisation for the central fit as herapdf1.6 : there are extra parameters for the gluon pdf and the low - x behaviour of @xmath23-valence and @xmath24-valence are not required to be the same .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "hera jet data have been used in addition to hera inclusive data in order to determine the parton distributions in the proton in an nlo qcd fit .",
    "there is no tension between the jet data and the inclusive data .",
    "the pdf set including the jet data , herapdf1.6 , is similar to the publically available herapdf1.5 set both in pdf central values and in uncertainties .",
    "however , the advantage of using jet data is clearly seen when the strong coupling constant @xmath0 is allowed to be a free parameter of the fits .",
    "the uncertainty on the low-@xmath9 gluon pdf due to the correlation with @xmath0 is much reduced when jet data are used and an accurate value of @xmath0 can be obtained : @xmath62 , excluding scale error .",
