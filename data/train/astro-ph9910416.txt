    "@xmath0 nonthermal radiation in blazars is produced by thin shells , propagating at a constant relativistic ( @xmath1 ) speed along the conical jet ;    @xmath0 relativistic electrons are injected in the shells within a distance range @xmath2 , starting from @xmath3 .",
    "they are injected at a constant rate and with the two power - law energy distribution , @xmath4 for @xmath5 and @xmath6 for @xmath7 ;    @xmath0 radiative energy losses of electrons are dominated by comptonization of the quasar broad emission lines .",
    "this process is responsible for production of @xmath8-rays .",
    "the low energy break at few mev results from inefficient radiation cooling of lower energy electrons ;    @xmath0 intensity of the magnetic field is @xmath9 .",
    "evolution of the electron energy distribution is given by the continuity equation ( moderski , sikora & bulik 2000 ) @xmath10 where @xmath11 the second term on the rhs of eq .",
    "( 2 ) represents the adiabatic losses .",
    "the rate of the radiative energy losses is :    @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the magnetic energy density , @xmath14 is the energy density of the synchrotron radiation field , @xmath15 is the energy density of the broad emission lines , @xmath16 is the energy density of the near - ir radiation produced in molecular torus by hot dust , and @xmath17 is the fraction of the accretion disc radiation reprocessed by the dust into the near - ir band .",

    "in figure 1 we present the time averaged blazar spectra for four different values of the energy break @xmath30 .",
    "all models are computed for the following set of parameters : @xmath31 cm ; @xmath32 ; @xmath33",
    "ergs / s ; @xmath34 gauss ; @xmath35 ; @xmath36 ; @xmath37 s@xmath38 ; @xmath39rad , @xmath40 k , and @xmath41 . for",
    "the justification of this choice see baejowski et  al ( in preparation ) .",
    "we can see from fig .",
    "1 , that for @xmath42 the low energy tail of the c(bel ) component extends down to @xmath43 kev .",
    "thus , any presence of thermal nonrelativistic electrons should be imprinted as a bump , peaking around 2 kev . since blazar spectra extend down to much lower values without any bump ( comastri et al .",
    "1997 ; sambruna 1997 ; lawson & mchardy 1998 ) , we exclude the domination of c(bel ) in the soft x - ray band .    in order to get soft x - ray spectra which smoothly join the middle x - ray band",
    ", one needs to assume that @xmath44 .",
    "then the low energy break of c(bel ) moves above @xmath45 kev and x - ray radiation below this value is dominated by either by ssc or c(ir ) .",
    "noting that the ssc x - ray spectra are much softer than the observed ones ( @xmath46 vs. @xmath47 ; kubo et al .",
    "1998 ) , c(ir ) is a better candidate for x - ray production .",
    "this , however , can be the case if @xmath48 . for larger values of @xmath49 the low energy break of the c(ir )",
    "component moves to energies @xmath50 kev , and , then , at lower energies the c(ir ) spectrum becomes too hard in comparison with observations .",
    "we conclude that interpreting the blazar x - ray observations within the framework of our model implies that @xmath30 is enclosed in the range @xmath51 .      for a jet dynamically dominated by the energy flux of protons , @xmath52 , and for radiative energy losses of electrons dominated by comptonization of broad emission lines ,",
    "the pair content of the jet can be calculated from the formula ( sikora et al .",
    ", in preparation ) @xmath53 this , for our model parameters and @xmath54 gives @xmath55 thus , our results suggest that particle number in quasar jets is dominated by pairs , while the jet inertia is still dominated by protons ."
