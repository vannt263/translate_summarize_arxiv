    "there is a growing interest in physical systems possessing the so - called @xmath0 ( parity - time ) symmetry  @xcite , i.e. , as a matter of fact , dissipative quantum systems with the antisymmetry between spatially separated gain and loss .",
    "if the strength of the gain - loss terms does not exceed a certain threshold value , the @xmath0 -symmetric system has a purely real spectrum and its non - hermitian hamiltonians can be transformed into a hermitian form @xcite . making use of the similarity of the quantum - mechanical schrdinger equation to the parabolic propagation equation in optics",
    "it was proposed theoretically  @xcite and demonstrated experimentally @xcite that the @xmath0  symmetry can be realized , in the purely classical context of the wave propagation , in optics , where it implies that a waveguide with the @xmath0-balanced gain and losses allows the transmission of wave modes , emulating the index - guiding transmission in ordinary ( conservative ) waveguides .",
    "these findings stimulated numerous additional studies of the linear wave propagation in  @xcite @xmath0-symmetric systems with particular attention being focused on the periodic potentials  pt_periodic ( see also review  @xcite ) .",
    "due to optical applications , additional interest has been recently attracted by nonlinear @xmath0 -symmetric optical systems with periodic modulation of the refractive index  @xcite which demonstrated that stable solitons can be supported by the combination of the kerr nonlinearity and periodic complex potentials , whose spatially odd imaginary part accounts for the balanced gain and loss .",
    "the stability of such solitons was rigorously analyzed in ref .",
    "solitons can also be naturally found in linearly - coupled dual - core systems with balanced gain and loss in the two cores and intrinsic kerr ( cubic ) nonlinearity in each one @xcite , and discrete solitons were predicted in coupled chains of @xmath0-symmetric elements @xcite and in general network of coupled @xmath0-symmetric oligomers ( dimers , quadrimers , etc )  @xcite .",
    "in addition to introducing the usual kerr nonlinearity , the @xmath0-symmetric part of the system can be made nonlinear too , by introducing mutually balanced cubic gain and loss terms  @xcite .",
    "properties of solitons in @xmath0 systems may differ significantly from what is known about usual solitons in conservative models .",
    "in particular , different families of solutions bifurcating from different linear modes may merge in a single family , exhibiting increased stability  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the increase of the gain - loss coefficient in the @xmath0-symmetric kerr - nonlinear coupler leads to shrinkage of the stability areas for @xmath0-symmetric and antisymmetric solitons , until they vanish when this coefficient becomes equal to the inter - core coupling constant .",
    "we also mention recent intensive activity in study of the combined effect of linear and nonlinear @xmath0  @xcite on existence and stability of optical solitons .",
    "apart from the kerr nonlinearity , another fundamental type of nonlinear interactions in optical media is quadratic  ( @xmath1 ) , which gives rise to the second - harmonic - generation systems , which generate families of two - color solitons ,  @xcite .",
    "recently the soliton dynamics in @xmath2 materials was considered in the presence of a @xmath0-symmetric localized impurity  @xcite .",
    "the objective of the present work is to introduce a generic one - dimensional ( 1d ) system with the @xmath0-symmetric periodic complex potential and conservative @xmath2 nonlinearity , and construct stable solitons in it .",
    "the realization of such a system in the spatial domain is quite possible in optics , using appropriately juxtaposed gain and loss elements , like in ref .",
    "experiment , inserted into a @xmath1 medium .",
    "we here focus on the search for gap solitons ( gss ) in the system with the periodic potential , i.e. , localized solutions whose propagation constant belongs to regions of the forbidden propagation ( _ gaps _ ) in the underlying linear spectra . similarly to the usual @xmath1 systems ( which do not include gain and loss ) @xcite , the quadratic nature of the nonlinearity makes the interplay between the gaps of the fundamental - frequency ( ff ) and second - harmonic ( sh ) fields a fundamental factor affecting gs families .",
    "in particular , the generic mechanism of the creation of the families via bifurcations from edges of the bandgaps @xcite can work in the ff or sh component , or in both  @xcite .",
    "we here analyze all these possibilities .",
    "it is relevant to mention that , as the @xmath0-symmetric systems is a special type of settings at the border between conservative and dissipative systems , the solitons that exist in them may be naturally compared not only to their counterparts in conservative models ( as mentioned above , concerning the relation to gss in the conservative @xmath1 systems ) , but also to solitons in generic dissipative systems , with unbalanced gain and loss .",
    "the crucial difference of the dissipative solitons from their conservative counterparts is that they exist , as isolated attractors of the system , at a single value of the propagation constant , rather than continuous families parametrized by an arbitrary propagation constant @xcite . in particular , as concerns gss , 1d and 2d dissipative gap solitons in the complex ginzburg - landau equations with periodic potentials were reported in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this sense",
    "nonlinear @xmath0-symmetric systems , being not conservative and thus requiring the balance between dissipation and gain , but still allowing for existence of the continuous families of the solutions ( what is the generic property of the such system provided the nonlinearity obey the same symmetry as the linear part  @xcite ) occupy an intermediate position between the conservative and dissipative systems , and reduced to the former ones when the gain - loss coefficient becomes zero or the the later ones when appears dispalance between gain and loss .    the paper is organized as follows . the model is introduced in sec .",

    "dynamics shows that the amplitude of the perturbed unstable solution grows without oscillations .",
    "lastly , stable solutions have never been found for @xmath138 .",
    "this conclusion is qualitatively similar to that made in other nonlinear @xmath0 systems , where solitons do not exists above a critical level of the gain - loss coefficient @xcite .",
    "in this work we have introduced the model combining the linear @xmath0-symmetric part and the @xmath1 nonlinearity .",
    "the @xmath0 terms are represented by the complex potential acting on the ff ( fundamental - frequency ) component , whose imaginary part , accounting for the spatially separated and mutually balanced gain and loss , is , as usual , the odd function of the coordinate .",
    "the potential acting on the sh ( second - harmonic ) wave is assumed to be purely real .",
    "the complex linear potential gives rise to the corresponding bandgap spectrum .",
    "solutions for solitons were looked for in the semi - infinite and finite gaps , starting from the bifurcation which gives rise to such solitons at edges of the respective gap .",
    "families of the solitons have been thus constructed , and their stability was investigated by means of the linearization and direct simulations alike . while the system contains several parameters , we have primarily focused on effects produced by the variation of the amplitude of the imaginary part of the potential , which is specific to the @xmath0-symmetric system .",
    "a noteworthy result is that the present system may support of continuous family of solitons embedded into the continuous spectrum of the sh component , and a part of the family of such embedded solitons is stable .",
    "the analysis has been reported , chiefly , for the most physically relevant case of equal effective amplitudes of the real potentials acting on the ff  and sh waves .",
    "in addition , a more exotic case of the real potential acting solely on the ff component was investigated too ( in appendix a ) .",
    "a natural extension of this analysis may be performed for the two - dimensional version of the @xmath1 system with the @xmath0-symmetric periodic potential . in that case",
    ", it may be also interesting to construct vortex solitons , in addition to the fundamental ones , and investigate their stability .",

    "it particular , the instability area appears for values of @xmath5 above a certain threshold .",
    "however , the difference is that only one instability interval exists in this case , and the threshold for its appearance , @xmath140 , is higher than in the system where the periodic potential acts on both components .",
