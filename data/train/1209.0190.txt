    "solar granulation is the evidence of the hot plasma going upward and coming down in the intergranular lanes .",
    "g - band bright points ( thereafter gbps ) are found to be tracers of the convective motion , as they mainly move along intergranular lanes . in these movements , gbps can get close to a strong downflow and start spiralling like water in a bathtub , as reported by @xcite .",
    "this spiral motion was also found at larger scales , e.g. in supergranular junctions @xcite .",
    "moreover , the way of tracking these vortex motions is quite different : computing horizontal velocity fields by using local correlation tracking techniques , as one of the first works made about small - scale vortices in the photosphere of @xcite ; using either passive tracers , like balltracking @xcite or active tracers , as gbps in @xcite can be good tools to find these elusive events .",
    "the hop 0014 was a joint campaign using hinode instruments and the swedish   1-m solar telescope ( sst ) , among other ground - based telescopes at the canary islands observatories . on september 29 , 2007 a continuous sequence of high - quality data",
    "was taken .",
    "the target was a quiet sun region close to disk center observed at a variety of wavelengths .",

    "we focus in the data taken with hinode spectro polarimeter @xcite .",
    "this data set consist of the full stokes vector on the lines fe  @xmath0 630.15 and 630.25 nm , recorded from 08:20 to 09:45 ut in dynamic mode .",
    "the full fov was 2.66  @xmath1 40.57  and scanned with a cadence of @xmath235 s. the exposure time was 1.6 seconds leading to a noise level of 1.4@xmath1 @xmath3 ( @xmath4 is the mean continuum intensity ) and with spatial resolution of the sp measurements of 015 .",
    "the standard reduction procedure was applied to the sp data : correction for dark - current , flat - field and instrumental cross - talk .",

    "the top row displays the los magnetograms obtained by computing the max @xmath5 . in the middle sequence the integral of the absolute value of stokes @xmath6 is shown , and in the bottom one the line - of - sight ( los ) velocity .",
    "the magnetic structure , as seen in the magnetograms and the unsigned stokes @xmath6 maps , integrated from -29pm to + 29pm , shows the same configuration than in the first row , and can be generally described as having two magnetic lobes . at 08:48 ,",
    "some bright points ( as seen in the continuum and g - band , though not shown here ) start developing between the two lobes , and some of them can be seen moving nearby the southern lobe ( north at the top of the figure ) .",

    "these maps , which follow the granulation behaviour , show in black the redshifted parts , ( i.e. , downflows ) , and in white the blueshifts , that is , essentially , the granulation structure .",
    "the magnetic patches stay most of the time into intergranular lanes . a strong downflow region at 08:44 ut is visible there .",
    "the @xmath6 profiles in this region are asymmetric double - lobed , confirming the presence of gradients of velocity or magnetic field @xcite .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows a sample of the masks that can be used for removing noise in spectropolarimetric scans . due to the short exposure time , the noise level increases considerably . in order to remove the noise present in the data , we apply different thresholds to create masks .",

    "asymmetries in @xmath6 profiles can be due to very strong gradients of velocity or magnetic field , so this behaviour could be the result of a possible convective collapse event",
    ". however , there are other ways of producing such profiles : when two or more components with large doppler shifts relative to each other overlap @xcite . +",
    "we have analyzed a sequence of hinode sp data , applying a 3@xmath8-mask , we justify the use in this work , since a 5@xmath8 is more restrictive for identifying small magnetic elements .",
