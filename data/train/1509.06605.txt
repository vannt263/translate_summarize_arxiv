    "the  135.56  nm intersystem line ( @xmath1 ) is covered by the nasa / smex mission _ interface region imaging spectrograph _ ( _ iris _ , * ? ? ?",
    "unlike other strong lines in the _ iris _  spectral passbands , such as the h & k resonance lines of singly ionised magnesium @xcite or the  133.5 nm multiplet @xcite that form in the upper chromosphere to lower transition region , the  135.56 nm line generally forms at mid - chromospheric heights , see below . hence developing its potential diagnostics will provide a useful tool to exploit the data from _ iris _  and map different regions in the atmosphere .",
    "already the skylab mission discovered some interesting behaviour of the  135.56@xmath0 nm line  and its neighbouring permitted transition of  during a solar flare @xcite . the /  line ratio got greatly enhanced during the solar flare compared with its value in the quiet sun .",
    "the lack of a theoretical explanation makes it hard to interpret what the mechanism is behind such a dramatic change .",
    "@xcite suggested that this line ratio can be sensitive to the chromospheric electron density , a critical parameter for understanding the energy balance of chromospheric plasmas .",
    "non - thermodynamic equilibrium ( non - lte ) modelling of the neutral oxygen and intercombination was carried out by @xcite .",
    "the hydrogen ly@xmath2 line is very close in wavelength to an oxygen resonance line and radiative excitation of the oxygen line by hydrogen ly@xmath2 photons was found to be an important excitation mechanism for the  130@xmath0 nm resonance .",
    "the excitation by ly@xmath2 pumping is transferred to the lower excited states in the triplet system by radiative cascading .",
    "@xcite also confirmed that the ionization of neutral oxygen is dominated by charge - exchange reactions with hydrogen and therefore is determined by the ionization degree of hydrogen .",
    "they only included one state ( @xmath3 ) in the quintet system , which is the upper level of the intercombination . without the higher excited states in the quintet system",
    ", the authors concluded that the upper level of the  135.56@xmath0 nm line  was mainly populated by collisional excitation .",
    "they also reported that the formation of the   was less optically thick than the  resonance , due to the lack of a central reversal in the line profile .",
    "the basic formation of the neutral oxygen lines was revisited by @xcite with applications to a range of cool stars and solar chromospheric models , with a particular focus on the resonance the authors confirmed that the ionization degree of neutral oxygen is set by charge transfer with hydrogen , and the formation of the resonance lines is dominated by the ly@xmath2 pumping effect .",
    "the model atom developed by @xcite was developed for the purpose of studying the resonance lines in the triplet system .",
    "since the ionization balance is determined by charge transfer reactions with hydrogen and the excitation is dominated by hydrogen ly@xmath2 pumping , highly excited states do not have to be included when the interest is focussed on the resonance triplet .",
    "their model atom has more excited states in the quintet system compared to @xcite but the model atom is not complete enough for the study of the intersystem lines that may be populated through a recombination cascade in the quintet system .",
    "@xcite studied a number of  lines for elemental abundance analysis , among them the  777@xmath0 nm , which belong to the quintet system .",
    "the upper levels of the 777@xmath0 nm lines are populated mostly through radiative cascading processes within the quintet system , therefore such high - lying excited states were included in their study of the non - lte effects on the oxygen abundance .",
    "there was , however , no ly@xmath2 pumping effects included in their modelling . due to their inclusion of the highly excited levels in the quintet system , we use their model atom as a basis for constructing our simplified model atom .",
    "the layout of this paper is as follows : in section  [ sec : method ] we describe our radiative transfer computations and model atmospheres . in section  [ sec : quintessential ] we construct a simplified model atom for the study of the  135.56@xmath0 nm line  and describe this quintessential model atom . in sections  [ sec : steady_ion ] and [ sec :",
    "steady_hpop ] we discuss the basic formation mechanism and the effects from the hydrogen solution based on a 1d semi - empirical atmosphere . in section  [ sec : steady_mov ] we discuss different formation scenarios in a 3d atmosphere , in particular how velocity fields affect the line profile .. in section  [ sec : diag ] we present syntethic spectra and the potential diagnostics of the  135.56@xmath0 nm line . in section  [ sec : obs ] we show the comparison of our simulation with observations , and we conclude in section  [ sec : concl ] .",
    "we use rh @xcite to solve the non - lte radiative transfer problem .",
    "rh is a multilevel accelerated lambda iteration code for radiative transfer calculations that includes partial frequency redistribution ( prd ) treatment of the line profiles and also blending between lines .",
    "we use the rh 1d version to study the basic formation mechanism in section  [ sec : steady ] with the falc @xcite atmosphere . for synthetic profiles from the 3d atmosphere",
    ", we solve the radiative transfer column - by - column as a 1d problem using the 1.5d version of rh @xcite .",
    "we take the non - lte population densities of hydrogen from the model atmospheres and solve for the non - lte population densities of silicon ( the element responsible for the dominant background opacity ) in addition to oxygen .",
    "we use two model atmospheres for our study . in section",
    "[ sec : steady ] we use the semi - empirical solar chromosphere model falc @xcite to study the basic formation mechanisms .",
    "the falc model is a one - dimensional atmosphere in hydrostatic equilibrium that describes the atmosphere in an ill - determined averaged fashion .",
    "it is thus far from catching the dynamic state of the solar chromosphere but serves the purpose of providing a test - ground with reasonable atmospheric parameters for studying atomic processes to develop an understanding of the basic formation mechanisms .",
    "this understanding is essential for the development of a simplified atomic model that encompasses the essentials while being small enough to permit radiative transfer solutions in a 3d atmosphere .",
    "to study the formation properties in a more realistic atmospheric model that catches some of the dynamic state of the solar chromosphere , we use a snapshot calculated with the 3d radiation magnetohydrodynamic ( rmhd ) code _ bifrost _  @xcite .",
    "we use a snapshot that extends 24x24x16.8 mm@xmath4 in physical space , with resolution of 504x504x496 grid - points .",
    "it covers the upper convection zone ( from 2.5  mm below the height where optical depth is unity at 500@xmath0 nm , the zero point of our height scale ) , the chromosphere , transition region and lower corona and includes magnetic field with two main patches of opposite polarity separated by 8@xmath0 mm .",
    "the average unsigned field strength is 50 g .",
    "the simulation cube is snapshot 385 of the _ en024048_hion _ simulation that is available from the european hinode science data centre ( http://www.sdc.uio.no/search/simulations ) . a detailed description of the simulation _",
    "en024048_hion _ is given in @xcite .",
    "this is the same simulation cube that has been used in the previous papers on the formation of _ iris _  diagnostics @xcite and a number of other papers on line formation under solar chromospheric conditions @xcite .",
    "as a starting point for developing a simplified atomic model we use the 54-level model atom of @xcite . for the source of the atomic data , see that reference .",
    "this 54-level model atom contains extra high lying excited states and updated collisional data compared with the 14-level model atom in @xcite .",
    "we simplify the 54 level atom to a model atom with 16 levels to meet our purpose .",
    "we do this by replacing all levels above the most highly excited level in @xcite by effective recombination rates that catches the recombination cascade through these levels without solving for their population density , see below .",
    "our resulting model atom is with 16 levels instead of 14 levels as the @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are treated as separated levels , instead of a single merged term as in @xcite .",
    "a major uncertainty in the model atom is the importance of collisions with neutral hydrogen .",
    "these collisions may couple the quintet system with the triplet system and make the  135.56@xmath0 nm line  emission sensitive to the pumping by hydrogen ly@xmath2 radiation ; a process that takes place in the triplet system .",
    "collisional data for collisions with neutral hydrogen are largely unknown .",
    "a common approach in stellar abundance studies is to use a simplified recipe @xcite together with a scaling factor determined from a fit to observations .",
    "this approach is since a mismatch between observations and the non - lte solution may come from the deficiency of other approximations ( e.g. , 1d plane - parallel , hydrostatic equilibrium atmospheres ) and not from lack of neutral hydrogen collisions .",
    "@xcite included the drawin recipe in their calculation but did not include the effect of ly@xmath2 pumping .",
    "the effect on the  777@xmath0 nm lines was rather small .",
    "we have made experiments using the 1d falc model and find that neutral hydrogen collisions will make the ly@xmath2 pumping contribute to the population of the upper level of the  135.56@xmath0 nm line  and increase the intensity by up to 50% .",
    "however , quantum mechanical calculations of neutral hydrogen collisional cross - sections for other elements ( none have been made for  yet ) indicate that the drawin recipe may overestimate the rates by several orders of magnitude . for this reason we have chosen not to include collisions with neutral hydrogen but in light of the dependency we have found ,",
    "it is important to recognize this source of uncertainty in the resulting intensities .",
    "highly excited levels are important for providing recombination channels from the continuum . after the recombination , we expect further downward cascading through allowed radiative transitions . in the chromosphere , we expect all these transitions to be optically thin such that we can neglect the reverse transitions ( photoionization and radiative excitation ) .",
    "this makes it possible to introduce effective recombination rates that take into account the recombination channels without treating the levels in detail .",
    "in general , we have a radiative recombination coefficient given by    @xmath8    where the index @xmath9 stands for the continuum , the index @xmath10 the level it recombines to , @xmath11 the electron density , @xmath12 , @xmath13 the statistical weights , @xmath14 the electron mass , @xmath15 the temperature , @xmath16 the planck constant , @xmath17 the boltzmann constant , @xmath18 the ionization energy , @xmath19 frequency , @xmath20 the threshold frequency , @xmath21 the photoionization crossection , and @xmath9 the speed of light .    if we factor out the electron density , @xmath11 , the rest of the expression in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rci ] ) will be just a function of temperature after carrying out the integration over frequency .",
    "we can thus express the recombination to level @xmath10 as :    @xmath22    the advantage of such an approach is that if the net rate between the continuum and the state @xmath10 can be well approximated as this recombination process ( meaning that the reverse photoionization is negligible ) , then we can replace the radiative recombination with a fixed rate that is only a function of temperature .",
    "if the electrons in state @xmath10 further cascade down to other states with allowed transitions , e.g. , to states @xmath23 and @xmath17 , then the recombination to state @xmath10 can be split into recombination processes between the continuum and the states @xmath23 and @xmath17 , with a split given by the transition probabilities for spontaneous deexcitation , @xmath24 and @xmath25 :    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is the contribution to @xmath28 from recombination through level @xmath10 .",
    "this process can be repeated for all the levels where we want to take into account the recombination cascade without including the level in the model atom .",
    "for each level we keep in the model atom , we thus end up with recombination contributions from all levels we exclude that couple to our level through allowed transitions .",
    "these contributions are just summed up to get the total effective recombination to that level .",
    "figure [ fig : o_term_diag ] shows the term diagram of our quintessential model atom with 16 levels .",
    "the level energies and designations are given in table  [ tb : oi_terms ] .",

    "since the oxygen ionization is dominated by charge transfer with neutral hydrogen and protons , higher hydrogen ionization degree will result in higher oxygen ionization degree ( see equation  [ eq : oion ] ) .    as a secondary channel the quintet levels",
    "can also be populated through collisions from the triplet levels ( c6 - 5 in fig.[fig : rate_o ] ) , and with such a channel the ly@xmath2 radiation might have an effect on the 135.56 nm emission as well .",

    "we have made tests with and without the effect of ly@xmath2 pumping included and find negligible effect on the  135.56@xmath0 nm line  if only collisions with electrons couple the triplet and quintet system . collisions with neutral hydrogen may increase the coupling , but the collisional cross - sections are unknown and likely not large enough to affect the  135.56@xmath0 nm line , see section  [ sec : quintessential ] for a discussion .",

    "for the  135.56@xmath0 nm line , with its optically thin formation , this is obviously a bad choice .",

    "the shift of the  line is usually small ( 90% of the data points lie within @xmath85 5 ) and the average shift is 1.5 .",
    "this average shift is caused by a global oscillation that is of this value at the time of the simulation snapshot .",
    "the temporal average profile over a number of snapshots shows a shift very close to zero . using the  135.56@xmath0 nm line  as a wavelength reference , as is done for _ iris _ ,",

    "hydrogen is the dominant electron donor and the proton density can be well approximated by the electron density .",
    "the radiative recombination introduces another electron density dependency .",
    "we therefore anticipate the  135.56@xmath0 nm line  total intensity to be proportional to the square of the electron density .",
    "figure  [ fig : ne_i ] shows the pdf of the logarithm of the contribution function weighted electron density as a function of the logarithm of the  total line intensity . from the linear regression",
    "we get a slope 0.51 in the @xmath86 plot , equivalent to @xmath87 .",
    "this confirms that the total intensity indeed is proportional to the electron density squared .",
    "there is , however , a substantial width to the relation because of the temperature dependency of the recombination coefficient , see figure  [ fig : ratecoef ] .    , which is equivalent to @xmath87 .",

    "figure  [ fig : vw_wtot ] shows the pdf of the measure @xmath96 as a function of the total line - width of the intensity profile of the  135.56@xmath0 nm line .",
    "the relation expected for a gaussian velocity distribution without thermal broadening is shown with a straight red line .",
    "the relation expected for a flat velocity distribution ( all the velocities are equally probable , e.g. , a linear velocity gradient ) is shown with a blue straight line .",
    "it is clear that when the total line - width is small ( @xmath102 6 ) , the total line - width is larger than the velocity amplitudes indicate because the broadening is dominated by thermal broadening rather than non - thermal broadening . as the line - width grows bigger the broadening gets more and more dominated by non - thermal broadening .    with the knowledge of the temperature structure in the atmosphere , we may directly correlate the velocity field with the non - thermal broadening ( using equation  [ eq : wnth ] ) . figure",
    "[ fig : vw_wnth ] shows this correlation together with the expectations from a gaussian and a flat velocity distribution .",
    "the correlation from our simulation shows a tendency of a flat distribution when the non - thermal broadening is small ( @xmath1034 ) , and it gradually approaches a gaussian distribution for larger non - thermal broadening .",
    "thanks to the optically thin formation , the  133.56 nm line - width is a very good diagnostic of non - thermal broadening .",
    "we have explored correlations between atmospheric parameters in a snapshot of a radiation - mhd simulation of the solar atmosphere and observables of the  135.56@xmath0 nm line .",

    "we have therefore subtracted this constant level from the observed profile and added the continuum level from the simulations .",
    "the synthetic profile is more narrow than the observed profile .",
    "this deficiency of the simulation is also seen in profiles of the  k line @xcite and the multiplet at 133.5 nm @xcite . given the good correlation between the  135.56@xmath0 nm line  non - thermal width and the velocity field in the atmosphere this is an indication that the simulation has too small macroscopic velocities .",
    "in this work we have studied the basic formation mechanism of the  135.56 nm intersystem line .",
    "the line shows an optically thin formation and the emission gets contributions from the whole chromosphere .",
    "the radiative rate is dominated by a recombination cascade and the total intensity is therefore proportional to the electron density and the population density of ionized oxygen .",
    "the ionization balance is dominated by charge transfer collisions with hydrogen such that the final total intensity is proportional to the electron density squared .",
    "due to the optically thin nature of the  135.56@xmath0 nm line  formation we get a line - width that is a direct measure of the thermal and non - thermal broadening .",
    "the thermal width is rather small ( 3.2  at a temperature of 10  kk , which is a temperature at the upper range of what we find ) such that a profile with an 1/e width of more than 5  is dominated by non - thermal broadening .",
    "the  135.56@xmath0 nm line  thus provides a very good measure of non - thermal velocities in the chromosphere and is an excellent complement to the optically thick _ iris _  chromospheric diagnostics such as the h & k lines and the  lines around 133.5 nm .",
