    "applications of concepts of effective field theory to the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , in which the hadrons are viewed as bound system of three relativistic constituent quarks , make it useful to investigate the properties of relativistic equations of three particles interacting through effective attractive forces . in this scenario ,",
    "zero range interactions provide a simple , but important limiting case for short range forces  @xcite .",
    "the non - relativistic three - body system based on contact forces shows the thomas collapse  @xcite ; this effect occurs , since the binding energy of the system is unbounded from below .",
    "however , a relativistic treatment of the problem is necessary , if the binding energy becomes larger and eventually exceeds the size of the constituents .",
    "the relativistic three - particle problem with a contact interaction has been investigated using relativistic light front equations  @xcite .",
    "the regularization procedure that has been used avoids the thomas collapse .",
    "recently it has been revisited by carbonell and karmanov in a covariant light front approach without introducing an explicit regularization scheme in the three - body equation  @xcite .",
    "understanding the relativistic isolated few - body bound problem is the first step to study consistently the three - quark clusters at finite temperatures and densities .",
    "results of lattice calculations and model simulations suggest a rich structure of the qcd phase diagram  @xcite including the transition from quarks to nucleons as relevant degrees of freedom ( mott transition , i.e. dissociation  @xcite ) , the chiral restoration and the color superconductivity analogous to cooper pairing . in this context three - quark correlations",
    "should play an important role in the vicinity of the phase transition and are investigated within a green functions formalism using the dyson equation approach  @xcite . in this paper , we consider first the isolated case and then medium effects .",
    "we study the dependence on an invariant cut - off @xmath0 and show the relativistic analog of the thomas collapse .",
    "after that we study the equations in medium and calculate for different values of the cut - off @xmath0 the dissociation of the three - quark bound states as well as the critical temperature @xmath1 of the color - superconducting phase .",
    "for the time being we investigate bose - type relativistic equations . using a zero - range interaction the solution for the two - body propagator @xmath2 is given by  @xcite @xmath3 where the expression for @xmath4 corresponds to a loop diagram .",
    "in the rest system of the two - body system @xmath5 it is given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the logarithmic divergence appearing in the integral can be absorbed in a redefinition of @xmath9 .",
    "to do so one assumes that the two particle propagator @xmath2 has a pole for @xmath10 , i.e. @xmath11 the subtraction imposed by this condition in the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : tau ] ) makes @xmath2 finite  @xcite .",
    "however , in order to investigate the three - body bound state equation even if no two - body bound state exists , we use in the integral ( [ eqn : b ] ) an invariant cut - off @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "the requirement is that the mass of the virtual two - body subsystem is smaller than the cut - off , i.e. @xmath13 and hence @xmath14 . with this cut - off the integral",
    "is given by @xmath15 where @xmath16    the solution of the two - body propagator is the input for the three - body equation .",
    "for the mass of the virtual three - particle state , which is the sum of the on - shell minus - components of the three particles , we introduce a similar regularization that leads to parametric dependence of the vertex function @xmath17 on the cut - off @xmath12 , @xmath18     for different cut - off parameters @xmath19 and @xmath20 figs .",
    "a , b , c , and d respectively .",
    "horizontal dashed lines show the two - body break - up.[fig : m23l ] ]     from a fit of @xmath21 to the proton mass , with @xmath22 mev ( solid line ) , @xmath23 mev ( dashed line ) @xmath24 mev ( dash - dot ) .",
    "grey area bounded by @xmath25 ( upper ) , @xmath26 ( lower).[fig : l ] ]     from a fit of @xmath21 to the proton mass , with @xmath22 mev ( solid line ) , @xmath23 mev ( dashed line ) @xmath24 mev ( dash - dot ) .",
    "grey area bounded by @xmath25 ( upper ) , @xmath26 ( lower).[fig : l ] ]    we investigate the two- and the three - body bound state as a function of the strength @xmath27 for different values of @xmath12 .",
    "to solve ( [ eqn : fad ] ) we use the cut - off parameters @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the constituent mass , and @xmath30 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : m23l ] we show the two - body mass @xmath31 and the three - body mass @xmath21 in units of the particle mass .",
    "the values of the strength @xmath32 where bound states exist , become smaller as the cut - off @xmath12 increases . for certain values of these parameters the three - body bound state collapses , i.e @xmath33 , for a finite two - body mass .",
    "this corresponds to the nonrelativistic thomas collapse  @xcite . however , there is a region of parameters where both @xmath31 and @xmath21 exist . in this case",
    "it is possible to plot @xmath21 vs. @xmath31 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : m23 ] .",
    "the correlations between two- and three - body bound states are presented for the different cut - offs parameter chosen and for the regularization scheme , which we call b , used in  @xcite .",
    "this avoids the thomas collapse , because of the additional restriction @xmath34 for the intermediate state .    for weak",
    "bound two - body states the dependence of the resulting function @xmath35 is smooth and reproduces qualitatively in this range the results of the regularization b. however , we note that for the large invariant cut - off this function coincides with the result of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the introduction of a cut - off allows us to solve the three - body equation without assuming a two - body bound state , as e.g. utilized by  @xcite , but extending our regularization procedure .",
    "note that for a fixed @xmath36 the function @xmath37 is not monotonic .",
    "this is due to the necessary readjustment of the strength @xmath27 that eventually acts differently in the 2 and the 3-body system in combination with the cut - off .",
    "the function @xmath38 however for a given mass @xmath36 is a monotonic function as is should be to keep @xmath36 constant , see fig .",
    "[ fig : l ] .",
    "although the model neglects important aspects of the baryon dynamics , i.e. the spin , we introduce the proton mass ( @xmath39 mev ) as a scale of the calculation . on the light front",
    "the treatment of the spin is technically difficult and for the time being we average over the spin projections .",
    "this procedure can be justified in matter , because it means that the spins are washed out in the medium .",
    "the introduction of the scale allows us to obtain a relation between the parameters @xmath40 .",
    "we choose a different values of the quark mass:@xmath41 mev  @xcite and @xmath42 mev and a rather large one of @xmath24 mev .",
    "the fit to the proton mass determines the functions @xmath38 that are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : l ] .",
    "the grey area delimits the range of the parameters for which the two - quark bound states exist .",
    "the lines outside this area indicate where the proton can be found without bound two - body subsystems , i.e. the proton is described as a borromean system .",
    "that occurs for @xmath22 mev for all values of @xmath0 and for @xmath23 mev for values of @xmath0 above @xmath43 . with the choice of a certain value for the quark mass the model",
    "is parameterized by the input @xmath0 only .    in the following we assume @xmath23 mev and",
    "use it for the in - medium calculations .",
    "using the dyson approach we have derived consistent relativistic few - body equations for particles embedded in a medium of both finite temperature and finite density .",
    "they systematically include the effects of self energy corrections @xmath44 and pauli blocking factors , given in terms of the fermi distribution functions . for particles they are  @xcite @xmath45 + 1\\right)^{-1 } \\label{eqn : fermi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] expressed in terms of light front form momenta given by @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "the three - quark equation becomes @xmath48 solving eq.([eqn : med3 ] ) we calculate the three - quark binding energy as function of the temperature and the chemical potential for the different cut - offs .",
    "we can go further and estimate at which temperature and chemical potential the binding energy goes to zero and therefore the three - quark bound states disappear ( dissociation ) .",
    "the values of @xmath49 and @xmath50 for which this transition occurs are called mott lines and are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase ] .",
    "their behavior qualitatively reflects the hadronic - deconfined phase transition . at low temperatures the dependence on the cut - off is mild , but we note that at zero density the different @xmath0 give different values for the critical temperature .",
    "we can choose the cut - off by fitting our results to the lattice calculations .",

    "the preliminary results , shown in in fig .  [ fig : sc ] , present the qualitative behavior known from different model simulations .",
    "the question if the onset of the color superconductivity at @xmath54 occurs in the deconfined phase is still open and further investigations of the chiral restoration may answer it .",
    "in conclusion , we have presented relativistic equations of the three - body problem using a zero range interaction and investigated its stability in isolated and in - medium cases . utilizing a invariant cut - off @xmath0",
    "we have shown the relativistic analog of the thomas collapse ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "we find that the proton can be described as a borromean state in case of weakly bound systems .",
    "we have derived consistent relativistic three - quark equations at finite density and temperature .",
    "we find that the and the critical temperature for the color superconductivity agree qualitatively with results expected from other sources .",
