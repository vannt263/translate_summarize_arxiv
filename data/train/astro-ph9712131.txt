    "we measured emission lines for @xmath3 spectra in the stromlo - apm ( sapm ) redshift survey of galaxies with @xmath4 mag , covering 4300 square degrees of the southern sky .",
    "galaxies are at @xmath5 , and @xmath6 ( loveday et al . 1996 ) .",
    "these galaxies have been selected randomly at a rate of 1 in 20 from automated plate measurements ( apm ) scans ( maddox et al . 1990 ) .",
    "spectra were obtained using the dual beam spectrograph equipped with 4 ccds on the anu 2.3 m telescope .",
    "the wavelength coverage is 3700@xmath75000   in the blue , and 6300@xmath77600   in the red .",
    "the dispersion is typically 1   per pixel , and using a slit of width 8 the spectral resolution is 5  .",
    "we checked that our equivalent widths ( ew ) are not dependent on the area of each galaxy covered by the slit , which is @xmath8% on average .",
    "consequently , our results are comparable to integrated spectra of nearby galaxies , or to distant galaxies ( tresse et al . 1998 ) .",
    "we find that 62% of galaxies are h@xmath2 emission - line galaxies ( elg ) with @xmath9  .",
    "the remaining are classified as absorption - line galaxies ( alg ) .",
    "the sample is divided into equal numbers of elg and alg at @xmath10  .",
    "ew are not corrected for stellar absorption .",
    "when comparing surveys , percentages of elgs have to be taken with extreme care , since the spectral resolution , the aperture , the magnitude limit , the passband selection , etc . lead to very different percentages .",
    "the fraction of elg depends strongly on the absolute magnitudes , m(@xmath0 ) , and the size of galaxies ( figure  1 ) . from @xmath11 to @xmath12 mag , or from size",
    "10,000 to 100 kpc@xmath13 , it increases by a factor of @xmath14 or 4 , respectively .",
    "elg are more common than alg in intrinsically faint galaxies , and small systems .",
    "this agrees with the general picture where dwarves ( faint and small ) are more actively forming stars , than their bright counterparts in the local universe .",
    "this is a reflection of the difference between elg and alg luminosity functions ( loveday et al .",
    "it is also consistent with the `` peak '' of sfr observed at @xmath15 , since the overall luminosity density is dominated by bright galaxies , which formed most of their stars much earlier than dwarves , which are actively forming stars today .",
    "the mean and the median ew(h@xmath2 ) ( @xmath16  ) are respectively 19 and 15   in the sapm .",
    "the h@xmath2 line has the advantage that it is directly correlated to the `` instantaneous '' star formation rate ( sfr ) , or the time scale since the last burst . whereas [ o  ii]@xmath173727 line depends on the metallicity of the galaxy , and on the hardness of the global ionizing spectrum .",
    "ew(h@xmath2 ) is the ratio of the flux originating from massive , young stars ( ob type ) in h  ii regions , over the flux from the old stellar population emitting in the rest - frame @xmath18 passband , which forms the continuum at h@xmath2 . in figure  2",
    ", we show that the fraction of faint elg ( @xmath19 ) increases as a function of ew . from @xmath20 to @xmath21   ( which corresponds to a sfr increasing by a factor @xmath22 5 ) , the fraction increases by a factor @xmath23 .",
    "another way to look at this is to consider the fraction of high ew elg ( @xmath24  ) , which increases at fainter m(b@xmath25 ) .",
    "since b magnitudes are correlated with h@xmath2 luminosities , the fainter a galaxy , the smaller its h@xmath2 luminosity is ( tresse & maddox 1998 , and also these proceedings ) .",
    "so , faint galaxies with high ew(h@xmath2 ) , means they are blue galaxies .",
    "this corresponds also to the strong correlation between colors and ew(h@xmath2+[n  ii ] ) ( kennicutt & kent 1983 ) .",
    "they have a young stellar population , so blue colors , high h@xmath2 fluxes , and less old stars .",
    "massive , large galaxies , or bright galaxies do not have the strongest ew(h@xmath2 ) .",
    "the fraction of young stars to old stars is smaller than for faint galaxies , leading to a red continuum , and smaller ew on average .",
    "so they are older systems , and less numerous  but they are still contributing to most of the luminosity density in deep surveys .",
    "it is now well established that the faint end of the luminosity function of @xmath26-selected surveys is dominated by actively star - forming galaxies .",
    "this is what we find also in the sapm ( loveday et al .",
    "1998 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 for @xmath29 and 19  ) .",
    "we note that the overall sapm luminosity function at @xmath30 has a shallower slope than the one from the preliminary 2df data ( @xmath31 ) , which were selected from the same parent catalog as the sapm ( see maddox , these proceedings ) .",
    "the correlation between ew(h@xmath2 ) and ew([o  ii ] ) has been established by kennicutt 1992 ( k92 ) , using a selection of galaxies covering all spectral types .",
    "however , k92 s selection is not a truly representative statistical sample of the local universe , unlike our sample . in figure  3 , we find @xmath32 ) = 0.68\\ ew(h\\alpha)$ ] ( k92 : 0.61 ) , @xmath32 ) = 0.47\\ ew(h\\alpha + [ n~ii])$ ] ( k92 : 0.40 ) .",
    "this is consistent with k92 s result given the large scatter observed in both samples .",
    "our scatter is not due to poor signal - to - noise , but reflects certainly different stellar , dust and metal contents sampled .",
    "we emphasize that ew measured from the overall galaxy content are likely to be affected by dust . indeed , recombination emission lines originate from dusty h  ii regions , where hot stars ( ob type ) are formed , whereas the continuum at [ o  ii ] or h@xmath2 comes from long - lived stars sitting in less , or non obscured regions .",
    "ew([o  ii ] ) is more affected by the dust than ew(h@xmath2 ) .",
    "hence , the absolute ew relation should be in average slightly higher .",
