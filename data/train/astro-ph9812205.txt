    "the detection of early type galaxies at z@xmath21 requires deep ir imaging to overcome the observed large restframe optical k - correction and correspondingly minimal inferred passive spectral evolution for this class of galaxy ( e.g. stanford , eisenhardt & dickinson 1998 ) .",
    "the highest redshift example of an early - type galaxy is a luminous object reported by dunlop et al .",
    "( 1996 ) at z=1.55 .",
    "its restframe uv spectrum is dominated by late - type f - stars , equivalent to an age of @xmath9gyrs , for standard stellar synthesis models ( spinrad et al .",
    "following ordinary ellipticals to @xmath10 requires much deeper ir imaging now possible from space . the nicmos observation in the hubble deep field south ( fruchter et al 1999 ) represents a three magnitude increase in depth over the deepest ground based ir data , and with usefully high spatial resolution .",
    "this , in combination with deep optical images from the vlt allows easy identification of red @xmath11 ellipticals to @xmath12 , where significant spectral and density evolution is widely anticipated .    in section",
    "@xmath13 we briefly outline our spectral and profile fitting procedures and simulations as applied to the nicmos and vlt observations .",
    "in @xmath14 we discuss detections of early - type and other ir bright galaxies at high  redshift . in @xmath15",
    "we compare their statistical properties with local populations of hubble sequence galaxies of similar spectral type , for different evolutionary models . in @xmath16",
    "we briefly discuss a the absence of bright blue precursor ellipticals in the ir .",
    "three sets of images are utilized , the hdf - s nicmos observations in jhk ( fruchter et al .",
    "1999 ) , the higher resolution unfiltered hst stis image ( gardner et al .",
    "1999 ) and the vlt test camera images in ubvri ( fontana et al .",
    "we use the nicmos pipeline zero - points and have computed the vlt effective zero - points for the combined optical images from the eso photometric solution . the filter functions and instrument response curves",
    "are kindly made available by eso and stsci .",
    "the detection is performed using sextractor ( bertin & arnauts 1996 ) in a combined @xmath17 frame .",
    "near total magnitudes are measured in j , h , k and psf matched stis images within a matched aperture set .",
    "a total of @xmath18 galaxies are detected to h=27 within the central 50@xmath19 50  field .",
    "the vlt ubvri images have psf s @xmath9 times wider that the nicmos exposures , and require a different procedure .",
    "we measure magnitudes within a @xmath20 aperture and correct them to near - total magnitudes using versions of the @xmath17 band image degraded to the psf of each of the vlt passbands to ensure the colors are defined within the same apertures for all bands .",
    "photometric redshifts are estimated using the methods described in bentez ( 1999 ) .",
    "the empirical template set of coleman , wu , & weedman ( 1980 ) is used , and augmented with bluer local starbursts ( kinney et al .",
    "1996 ) , to determine the redshift probability distribution for each galaxy with bayesian weighting .",
    "the fraction of objects with highly reliable photometric redshifts ( p@xmath20.99 ) is @xmath21 to h@xmath025 ( @xmath22 for objects classified as earlier than scd ) .",
    "fainter than this magnitude limit the reliability of the photometric redshift estimates quickly degrades .",
    "we also allow for the quoted 10% uncertainty in the nicmos zero - points for our spectral fits .    for redder early types , more detailed fits to single burst synthetic models",
    "are justified to accommodate the known spread of metallicity and age .",
    "for this , the compilation of leitherer et al .",
    "( 1996 ) is used , including the synthetic galaxy spectra of bruzual & charlot ( 1993 ) .",
    "we also check that the colors of these objects are not compatible with dust reddened star  forming galaxies by generating reddened versions of the late and i m types in our template set .",
    "profile fitting is performed for bright galaxies in the ir ( h@xmath023.7 ) . for this",
    "we simulate nicmos images using the methods described in bouwens , broadhurst & silk ( 1998 ) to account for the pixelization , dithering and point spread functions and the available weight map for the nicmos dithering pattern .",
    "the @xmath23 sample contains five clear elliptical galaxies , of which four lie above z=1 .",
    "their sed s and surface brightness profiles are compared with the models in fig  1 and listed in table  1 .",
    "all the objects spectrally classified as ellipticals are also found to have spheroidal profiles ( fig  1 ) .",
    "the most impressive object ( nic3/et4 , fig  1 , table  1 ) is extremely red , consistent with minimal passive evolution at an estimated @xmath24 , with a clear de - vaucouleurs profile and uniform color over its surface ( @xmath6 300 pixels ) .",
    "the effective radius 1.6(2.2)kpc / h is consistent with its inferred luminosity @xmath25 in restframe r for @xmath26 ( binggelli , sandage & tarenghi 1984 ) .",
    "this ir conspicuous object is absent or only marginally detected in the u , b , v , r , i and stis bands ( fig  1 ) .",
    "dust reddened spectra extinguished with standard reddening ( calzetti , kinney , & storchi - bergmann 1994 ) are unable to generate the steep break from the relative flat ir .",
    "another elliptical identified at @xmath27 ( nic3/et3 , fig 1 , table1 ) with a clear de - vaucouleurs profile , is the luminous object reported by treu et al .",
    "( 1998 ) in the earlier nicmos test images and confirmed by stiavelli et al .",
    "( 1999 ) .",
    "we also find several ir - bright high - redshift galaxies of later spectral type , 10 objects with z@xmath21 and h@xmath025 .",
    "two typical examples are shown in fig  1 .",
    "the profiles of these objects are generally exponential .",
    "the sed s are very conspicuous with a turn up towards the uv , and a distinctive bump in the ir separated by a trough , so there is little uncertainty in redshift ( e.g. fig  1 ) .",
    "the best fit single burst minimum ages are typically @xmath28 gyr .",
    "comparison with the seds of cww show these objects span the spectral types of local sab to sbc galaxies . the full sample of 24 galaxies with h@xmath025 ( open histogram , fig  2 ) have a redshift distribution peaked at @xmath29 with high - z tail similar to that found for the hdf ( connolly et al .",
    "1997 , fernndez ",
    "soto , lanzetta & yahil 1998 , bentez 1999 ) .",
    "a reliable measurement of the space density of massive galaxies at high redshift provides a basic check of hierarchical models of galaxy formation , where the most massive haloes form late ( lacey & cole 1993 ) and in which ellipticals and massive spheroids may be viewed as the end product of the merging of smaller systems .",
    "the presence of so many luminous red galaxies at high - z in such a small field is surprising and indicates that relatively evolved luminous galaxies are commonplace at z@xmath21 .",
    "using the pozzetti , bruzual , & zamorani ( 1996 ) local luminosity functions for e / so - sbc as input , we recover 4(9 ) ellipticals from our realistic nicmos simulations for @xmath10 , @xmath23 , with @xmath30 and no evolution .",
    "adding the later - type ir - luminous galaxies allows a useful comparison with models ( fig  2 ) .",
    "the redshifts and luminosities observed above z=1 are consistent with no density or luminosity evolution of standard hubble sequence galaxies for @xmath31 .",
    "note , passive evolution is minimized here for consistency with the red seds by choosing @xmath32km / s / mpc and @xmath33 .",
    "the hierarchical model parametrization of kauffmann , charlot & white ( 1996 ) for @xmath34 underpredicts the numbers as expected .",
    "hierarchical models with @xmath35 may allow a declining density but must be checked for self consistency .",
    "the optical - ir colors prefer older higher redshift models and are consistent with no size evolution , but do not distinguish clearly between the above cosmological models .",
    "the integrated luminosity density to h=25 at 1@xmath0z@xmath02.5 is comparable with local estimates integrated over e / so - sbc types ( see fig  2 ) .",
    "the predicted luminosity density for @xmath10 at restframe 6000@xmath36 is @xmath37ergs/@xmath38/s / hz compared to @xmath39 ergs/@xmath38/s / hz , @xmath40 ergs/@xmath38/s / hz and @xmath41 ergs/@xmath38/s / hz , for @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 respectively .",
    "a factor of two decrease in luminosity density is implied relative to the popular low @xmath4 models assuming passive or no stellar evolution .",
    "our results seem to extend to @xmath45 the results of other authors notably lilly et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and kodama , bower & bell ( 1999 ) who find no evidence for a dramatic evolution in the density of early types galaxies to @xmath46 .",
    "the contrast of our results with the absence of distant ellipticals claimed by others ( kauffmann & charlot 1998 ; zepf 1997 ; franceschini et al .",
    "1996 ; barger et al .  1998 ; menanteau et al .",
    "1998 ) can be put in context by appreciating that the nicmos data is complete to @xmath47 , which is 3 magnitudes fainter than the deepest ground based data and 6 magnitudes fainter than most work on this question .",
    "two of the four ellipticals found here in the ir would barely register in the i band ( i@xmath627 ) and are certainly not bright enough for morphological classification in the optical even from space .",
    "recent claims of a decline in the elliptical density for z@xmath21 rely on significant passive evolution , where brightening enhances the expected numbers . the claim by kauffmann , charlot , & white ( 1996 ) , based on the cfrs ( lilly et al .",
    "1995 ) is subject to redshift incompleteness , in particular of red high - z galaxies , which are very hard to measure spectroscopically .",
    "some of the red galaxies reported here are bright enough in the ir to be detected in previous deep keck images ( moustakas et al .",
    "1997 ; hogg et al . 1997 ) but morphological classification is not possible in ground based images and deep complementary optical data are required to establish the break .",
    "the nicmos images directly show that luminous early type galaxies are present in significant numbers at high redshift with seds too red to be recognized as ellipticals in the optical even in the deepest wfpc2 images .",
    "an obvious problem with this kind of work is the presence of clustering in small field , rendering the results uncertain . to explore this",
    "we have searched for spikes in the redshift distribution using the approach described in bentez ( 1999 ) .",
    "the minimal number of structures along the light  of - sight to h=25 is three , at @xmath48 ( consistent with the @xmath49 redshift spike found in the hdf - s by glazebrook et al .",
    "1999 ) , @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "each of these structures corresponds approximately to the redshift of one or more elliptical galaxies , and the two higher redshift peaks contain @xmath52 of all the @xmath53 galaxies .",
    "our statistical analysis shows that it is virtually impossible that all the early type galaxies at @xmath54 belong to a single spike .",
    "a rough estimate of the expected clustering noise can be obtained by integrating the faint galaxy correlation function over the nicmos field for the range 1@xmath0z@xmath02 .",
    "connolly , szalay & brunner 1998 measure an amplitude @xmath55 for the angular correlation of hdf - n galaxies within @xmath56 slices to @xmath57 . assuming that @xmath58 , the total variance in the number of galaxies in a redshift slice @xmath59 is @xmath60 $ ] . for the interval @xmath61 with 35 galaxies this yields a variance of @xmath62 galaxies , which is 40% greater than poisson .",
    "if the early types are clustered like the integral of all types then we estimate their number to be @xmath63 in the range @xmath61 .",
    "the lack of spectral evolution of early type galaxies demonstrates that star - formation does not extend over time , but is confined to an early brief period , so that we should expect the precursors of these galaxies to appear extremely luminous and blue at higher redshift .",
    "the width of this period is constrained to be short by the tight e / so color - magnitude and m / l sequences ( e.g. bower , lucey & ellis 1992 , vandokkum et al .",
    "1998 ) . more directly , the lack of blue ellipticals in the hdf ( e.g. franceschini et al .",
    "1998 ) means this epoch lies at @xmath64 , and therefore may appear in the near - ir for redshifts in range 5@xmath0z@xmath015 as i or j band ` dropouts ' , provided the imf of early - type galaxies is not unusually deficient in hot stars .",
    "our simulated nicmos images show that significant numbers of elliptical galaxies are expected in the ir if they form luminous stars high redshift and were not significantly extinguished during the first gyr .",
    "the simulations include an exponential burst at @xmath33 with an e - folding time of 1gyr and predicts 6 , 10 and 15 objects for z@xmath25 to h=26 for , @xmath42 , @xmath65 , @xmath44 . in comparison ,",
    "no i or j band ` dropout ' galaxies are observed brighter than this limit .    at lower redshift ,",
    "five compact optically blue dropout galaxies are found , all consistent with a single redshift of @xmath7 .",
    "fits to their spectra are shown in fig  3 .",
    "these objects have low sfr of 6 - 23@xmath66 and very compact sizes in the h - band , @xmath60.5 kpc / h at restframe @xmath67 ( @xmath4=1 ) , and therefore appear unlikely to be the precursors of luminous elliptical galaxies if no evidence of sf is to remain by z@xmath61 .",
    "we have detected a substantial population of early type galaxies at z@xmath21 .",
    "these include @xmath68 profile galaxies in the redshift range z@xmath21 , all of which have surprisingly red colors despite their large redshifts .",
    "later spectral - types are also present in this redshift range , with a conspicuous ir bump .",
    "these galaxies are all luminous and well evolved , with minimum single - burst ages @xmath21gyr for a standard imf .",
    "the clear detection of early type galaxies and spheroidal components of other high - z disk galaxies points to the existence of a roughly similar density of luminous hubble sequence galaxies at @xmath5 , compared to the local universe .",
    "the declining density of luminous galaxies expected in hierarchical schemes can be made consistent with the data only with for low @xmath4 models .",
    "low @xmath4 helps accommodate the absence of spectral evolution , but in any cosmology the lack of bright ir - blue precursors of elliptical galaxies requires a very high redshift of formation z@xmath210 , for a standard imf and extinction .",
    "although the field studied is small , the number of red high - z galaxies detected is surprising and strongly suggests that the bulk of luminous galaxies were formed at @xmath69 . in the short ",
    "term a deep nicmos pointing in the hdf will provide similar data and help average over clustering .",
    "progress on this question awaits deep diffraction - limited ir imaging on large telescopes and improved ir facilities in space .",
