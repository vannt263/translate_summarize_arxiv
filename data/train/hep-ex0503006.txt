    "the accuracy of the monte carlo trigger efficiency has been checked from the two - track trigger , which requires at least two cdc tracks with an opening angle larger than @xmath17 , two or more tof hits as well as the ecl timing signal , using experimental events passing the high energy trigger based on a 1  gev threshold for an ecl total energy sum @xcite .",
    "the trigger efficiency depends on the average transverse momentum of the two tracks in the laboratory frame , @xmath18^{1/2 } \\cdot ( 1-|\\cos{\\theta^*}|^2)^{1/2}$ ] , where the latter is the transverse momentum of @xmath19 in the @xmath16 c.m .",
    "we determine the trigger efficiency as a function of @xmath20 , since each of the two - dimensional bins in @xmath21 and @xmath22 , where the number of events is measured , is associated with a @xmath20 value using the relation above . from the data ,",
    "the trigger efficiency is @xmath23 at @xmath24 gev/@xmath25 and @xmath26 at @xmath27 gev/@xmath25 .",
    "corrections for the monte carlo trigger efficiency are implemented according to the data , with a systematic error within @xmath28 .",
    "the accuracy of the pid efficiencies has been checked by comparing monte carlo estimates to those based on data .",
    "the efficiency associated with each of the four pid conditions ( section 2 ) is studied , using events passing all selection criteria except the condition in question .",
    "the overall pid efficiency is @xmath29 , @xmath30 and down to @xmath31 at @xmath32 , 3 and 4 gev respectively , with a systematic error less than @xmath33 in the whole @xmath21 range .",
    "the fake rate is @xmath34 - @xmath35 for @xmath36 - 4 gev , respectively .",
    "monte carlo studies indicate that the pid requirements are very efficient in rejecting electrons and other relativistic particles , so that events from @xmath37 and @xmath2 do not survive the selection , leaving those from @xmath38 as the main residual background . from monte carlo simulation and the measured cross sections for @xmath38 @xcite",
    ", the fraction of data that can be attributed to residual @xmath39 background , @xmath40 , is evaluated .",
    "based on monte carlo studies , the dependence of @xmath40 on @xmath22 is negligible and @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 at @xmath44 , 3.6 and 4.0 gev , respectively . for @xmath45 gev",
    ", @xmath40 is negligible .",
    "the values of @xmath40 have been checked in the data , using events passing all selection criteria except that on the normalized likelihood , @xmath46 .",
    "the number of signal events that would pass all selection criteria is estimated from the @xmath47 distribution of one of the two tracks , after requiring the other to satisfy @xmath46 .",
    "the values of @xmath40 inferred in this way are in good agreement with those above . the contribution from this source of background",
    "is subtracted from the data , using the expected @xmath40 from the monte carlo studies . the systematic uncertainty due to this source is @xmath48 or less in the whole @xmath21 range .",
    "possible non - exclusive backgrounds ( @xmath49 ) , most of them from @xmath50 events , have been searched for in the data .",
    "monte carlo studies show that a high purity sample of such background can be derived from events with larger @xmath51 and smaller @xmath52 , the latter being the transverse momentum balance of the three particles . by comparing monte carlo and data distributions of these parameters",
    "we obtain the fraction of the data attributed to this background type , @xmath53 .",
    "we find that the dependence of @xmath53 on @xmath22 is negligible , and it ranges from @xmath54 to @xmath55 for @xmath21 from 2 to 4 gev , respectively .",
    "corrections are made using the @xmath56 obtained above , and in total @xmath57 of the selected data are subtracted .",
    "the systematic error from this source is 2 - @xmath58 for @xmath21 from 2 to 4 gev , respectively .",
    "the fraction of the data attributed to @xmath50 events is also obtained as a function of @xmath51 . before the correction , a comparison of the @xmath51 distribution between data and monte carlo exhibits a total difference of @xmath59 between the two samples , while it is reduced to less than @xmath60 for any @xmath21 range after the correction ( fig .",
    "since the residual excess in the @xmath51 distribution could be attributed to residual non - exclusive backgrounds and a broader nature of the signal distribution than the monte carlo , the systematic uncertainty due to other possible non - exclusive backgrounds is limited to @xmath60 after the correction .",

    "all models based on this framework behave asymptotically as @xmath68 . for the diquark scenario ,",
    "two curves are provided @xcite : from the complete diquark model and from the same model with only helicity conserved amplitudes , where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are in opposite helicity states .",
    "the scale of the diquark predictions matches the data for @xmath61 - 3.0 gev , but the deviation becomes larger as @xmath21 increases ( fig .  4 ) . at higher energies",
    ", the data fall below the diquark predictions and exhibit a gradual approach to the three - quark model predictions @xcite . at medium energies between 2.5 and 4.0 gev , a steeper fall of the total cross section in @xmath21 is observed .    if we fit the data with a power law @xmath71 with @xmath62 floating ( fig .",
    "8(a ) ) , taking into account both statistical and systematic uncertainties as well as possible correlations between the latter , we obtain @xmath72 and @xmath73 in the range of @xmath61 - 2.9 gev and 3.2 - 4.0 gev , respectively ( the charmonium region between 2.9 and 3.2 gev is excluded ) . for completeness , we also show in fig .",
    "8(b ) the results of the fits with @xmath62 fixed at 10 and 15 .",
    "although for both ranges a good fit to the data can be obtained at @xmath64 , a smaller power , @xmath63 , describes the data above 3.2 gev reasonably well .",
    "this may imply that lower power terms become dominant at higher enegies , which is an indication for the transition to the asymptotic predictions .",
    "the angular differential cross section in @xmath22 is another observable most important to the study of the nature of the interactions involved in the process @xmath0 .",
    "all existing models based on the constituent scattering picture @xcite , as expected , predict an ascending trend , which is in agreement with the data for @xmath74 gev .",
    "this is due to the factor @xmath75 contained in the hard scattering amplitudes .",
    "the same trend is obtained from naive qed @xcite estimates : @xmath76 , in the massless limit .",
    "a simplified picture with diquarks would follow the naive qed expectation above @xcite , if all quark masses are neglected and only scalar diquarks are considered . in fig .",
    "9 we plot the differential cross section normalized to that averaged within @xmath77 , and compare various predictions to the data .",
    "we observe that the data rise more sharply in @xmath22 at higher energy ( see also fig .  5 ) . in comparison ,",
    "all current models predict a flatter trend in @xmath22 .    , normalized to that averaged within @xmath77 , for the two higher ranges of @xmath21 .",

    "theoretical predictions are from @xcite ( diquark ) , @xcite ( three - quark ) and @xcite ( handbag).,title=\"fig:\",width=257,height=257 ]    the deviation of the leading term qcd calculations  @xcite from the data at @xmath61 - 4.0 gev implies that power corrections are still significant at these intermediate energies .",
    "it is not surprising since the very threshold of @xmath3 production corresponds to @xmath78  gev .",
    "however , the diquark and handbag models  @xcite were developed in order to describe the intermediate energy region at the price of introducing model form factors , _",
    "etc._. the disagreement of the data at @xmath61 - 4.0 gev with their predictions ( see fig .  4 and 9 ) obviously necessitates their improvement .",
    "the descending trend of the differential cross section in @xmath22 observed at low energies ( @xmath79 gev ) can not be understood within the hard scattering picture ( fig .",
    "in a recent study based on non - perturbative qcd sum rules @xcite , this trend was proposed as a general feature for hadron pair production from two - photon collisions .",
    "the behavior is very natural if low partial waves are involved . in ref .  @xcite it was shown that even a simple model based on pole- and resonance - dynamics can reproduce this behavior .",
    "using the belle detector at the high - luminosity kekb collider , the cross sections for @xmath0 have been measured for @xmath21 from 2.025 to 4.0 gev and @xmath4 , with systematic uncertainties ranging from 7% to 14% .",
    "these results represent a great improvement in precision compared to all previous measurements and allow more accurate tests of various theoretical models .",
    "we also observed the production of @xmath5 and determined the product of the two - photon width of the @xmath6 and its branching ratio to @xmath3 .",
    "fitting to a power law @xmath71 shows that the best fit value of @xmath62 decreases as energy increases , and @xmath63 can not be rejected at energies above 3.2 gev , implying the gradual transition to the expectation from asymptotic predictions .",
    "the ascending trend for the differential cross section in @xmath22 predicted by the hard scattering picture is in agreement with the data for @xmath74 gev ; however , the data rise more sharply in @xmath22 as @xmath21 increases . the descending trend in @xmath22 at lower energies @xmath80 gev can be reproduced by non - perturbative approaches  @xcite .",
    "the descending trend of the differential cross section in @xmath22 changes to an ascending one with the increase of energy , which could be an indication for the transition from a soft resonance regime to the beginning of a hard regime .",
    "existing models suggested for the intermediate energies  @xcite can not provide satisfactory description of the observed energy and angular dependence in the studied energy range .",
