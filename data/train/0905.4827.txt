    "quantum hadro - dynamics ( qhd ) is an effective tool to understand nuclear force with baryons and mesons as the degree of freedom to provide a microscopic description of finite nuclei or infinite nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "the well known renormalizable quantum field theory was introduced by walecka based on baryons and a scalar and vector meson to study high density matter in the mean field theory , where the meson field operators are replaced by their vacuum expectation value or are treated as the classical fields . the model known as the @xmath3 model @xcite and its extensions ( complemented with cubic and quartic non - linearities of the @xmath4 meson )",
    "@xcite have been phenomenal in this respect .",
    "recently , there have been some efforts to extend the models including various interaction terms and generate new parameter sets in the relativistic mean field formalism @xcite with motivation to extend the applicability of the model in nuclear matter studies .",
    "parallel to that , another class of model , the sigma model evolved with the required features for a relativistic theory with chiral symmetry , the symmetry of the qcd or strong interactions",
    ". originally introduced by gell - mann and levy @xcite , later lee & wick @xcite emphasized the importance of chiral symmetry in nuclear matter studies .",
    "another interesting aspect was the introduction of dynamically generated isoscalar vector meson mass , first introduced by boguta @xcite to obtain the saturation properties of nuclear matter .",
    "it is now well established that nuclear matter saturation is realized through a balance between the scalar ( attractive ) and the vector ( repulsive ) component of the nuclear force mediated via mesons . among them , the mesons that are known to be important are the @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and the @xmath8 meson . as evident ,",
    "the mass of the scalar meson ( @xmath4 ) is not precisely known which seems to invoke challenge and interest for both the experimentalist and the theorist on account of its importance in nuclear and particle physics .",
    "the estimate from the particle data group ( pdg ) quotes the mass of this scalar meson ` @xmath0 ' or @xmath9meson in the range @xmath10 mev @xcite , seen as a @xmath11 resonance .",
    "since they are fundamental and constitute the higgs sector of the strong interaction , it is important and inevitable in the description of fundamental properties of matter and hence commands special attention .",
    "the range of the interaction and thus the fundamental properties of nuclear matter is sensitive to the mass of the @xmath9meson .",
    "for example , the inclusion of higher order interaction terms of the scalar field is known to considerably reduce the nuclear incompressibility , which is a fundamental constant of nature .",
    "apart from that there are important astrophysical implications related to nuclear incompressibility . with regard to chiral symmetry , the @xmath9meson plays the role of the chiral partner of pion and the symmetry is spontaneously broken in its ground state , as a consequence of which the scalar condensate attains a finite expectation value and the pions are rendered massless .",
    "the value of the scalar condensate reflects the strength with which the symmetry is broken and experimentally , this value is found to be @xmath12 131 mev @xcite as the pion decay constant ` @xmath13 ' .",
    "the rather precise value of the pion decay constant can serve as an alternative way to provide theoretical limits to the scalar meson mass . in the present work ,",
    "we look into these aspects and analyze the correlations between properties such as nucleon effective mass ( @xmath14 ) , the nuclear incompressibility ( @xmath15 ) , the scalar meson mass ( @xmath16 ) with varying saturation density ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "what follows in the next section is the description of the model attributes and the methodology adopted for the aforesaid purpose . in section iii , we present the results and the analysis of the present work .",
    "a comparison of our results with other theoretical and the experimental findings is also presented .",
    "finally we conclude with some important findings of the present work .",
    "the model we consider for the present analysis embodies dynamically generated mass of the vector meson .",
    "the explicit dependence of such a mass term on the scalar condensate then regulates the value of the nucleon effective mass and leads to the saturation of nuclear matter . using sigma model with dynamically generated mass for vector meson , glendening studied finite temperature aspects of nuclear matter and its application to neutron stars @xcite , but without @xmath18meson and its isospin symmetry influence on matter .",
    "although a nice framework respecting chiral symmetry , a drawback was its unacceptable high incompressibility and in the subsequent extension of the model @xcite , the mass of the vector meson is not generated dynamically .",
    "the model that we consider @xcite in our present analysis embodies higher orders of the scalar field in addition to the dynamically generated mass of the vector meson . here , we intend to analyze in detail the attributes of the model with respect to the inherent vacuum properties of chiral symmetry and its effect on the resulting eos .",
    "this would in turn interlink various properties of matter with the scalar condensate .",
    "we now proceed to briefly describe the salient features of the present model .",
    "the effective lagrangian of the model interacting through the exchange of the pseudo - scalar meson @xmath19 , the scalar meson @xmath4 , the vector meson @xmath20 and the iso - vector @xmath18meson is given by @xcite :    @xmath21   \\nonumber \\\\          & - & \\bar\\psi_{b}~\\left[g_{\\sigma~}~\\big(\\sigma + i\\gamma_5               \\vec \\tau\\cdot\\vec \\pi \\big)\\right]~ \\psi_{b } \\nonumber \\\\          & + & \\frac{1}{2}\\big(\\partial_\\mu\\vec \\pi\\cdot\\partial^\\mu\\vec\\pi          + \\partial_{\\mu } \\sigma \\partial^{\\mu } \\sigma\\big ) \\nonumber \\\\          & - & \\frac{\\lambda}{4}\\big(x^2 - x^2_0\\big)^2          - \\frac{\\lambda b}{6 m^2}\\big(x^2 - x^2_0\\big)^3          - \\frac{\\lambda c}{8 m^4}\\big(x^2 - x^2_0\\big)^4 \\nonumber \\\\          & - & \\frac{1}{4 } f_{\\mu\\nu } f_{\\mu\\nu }          + \\frac{1}{2}{g_{\\omega b}}^{2}x^2 \\omega_{\\mu}\\omega^{\\mu } \\nonumber \\\\          & - & \\frac { 1}{4}{\\vec r}_{\\mu\\nu}\\cdot{\\vec r}^{\\mu\\nu }          + \\frac{1}{2}m^2_{\\rho}{\\vec \\rho}_{\\mu}\\cdot{\\vec \\rho}^{\\mu}\\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the first line of the above lagrangian represents the interaction of the nucleon isospin doublet @xmath22 with the aforesaid mesons .",

    "@xmath26 and @xmath27 are the usual meson - nucleon coupling strength of the scalar , vector and the iso - vector fields respectively . here",
    "we shall be concerned only with the normal non - pion condensed state of matter , so we take @xmath28 and also @xmath29 .",
    "the interaction of the scalar and the pseudoscalar mesons with the vector boson generates a dynamical mass for the vector bosons through spontaneous breaking of the chiral symmetry with scalar field attaining the vacuum expectation value @xmath30 .",

    "the present analysis projects the interlink between the fundamental properties of matter such as the nucleon effective mass , the nuclear incompressibility and the sigma meson mass .",
    "aspects relating to the effect of nonlinearity in the scalar field interaction on the equation of state is investigated .",
    "the experimental value of the pion decay constant serves as a stern constraint on the vector coupling and in turn regulates the nucleon effective mass in the present model .",
    "further the combined constraint from the hic data @xcite and sigma meson mass @xcite seems to provide the upper limit to @xmath116 . within an acceptable range @xmath148 , the sigma meson mass is comes out in the range @xmath2 , which agrees very well with recent experimental and theoretical bounds .",
    "although within the specified range , the model predicts eos with incompressibility @xmath149 and lies on the upper range of the bound from the hic data , the eos corresponding to @xmath116 is found to be compatible with the dbhf prediction @xcite .",
    "the resulting high value of nucleon effective mass in the present model is a consequence of the dominant repulsive force in matter at high density , which may have interesting implications in the astrophysical context such as the modelling of neutron stars where the matter density is speculated to be in the range @xmath150 @xcite .",
    "overall , the model seems to provide a unified description of nuclear matter aspects , however the high incompressibility , although acceptable in the astrophysical domain needs to be brought down to enhance the applicability of the model in further studies .",

    "<S> the role of light scalar meson ` @xmath0 ' is investigated in nuclear matter in an effective chiral model in the mean - field approach . for the purpose , we scan the properties of the matter at various saturation densities imposing constraint such as the vacuum value of the pion decay constant @xmath1 . with a simple approach , the bound on the mass of the scalar meson is calculated and found in the range @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> further , the present analysis show that nuclear matter favor high nucleon effective mass and dominant repulsive forces at high density , the insight and the implications of which are discussed . </S>"
