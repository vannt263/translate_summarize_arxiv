    "in the standard model ( sm ) , all cp - violating effects derive from a single , complex phase of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix and predicate a distinctive pattern of cp - violation  @xcite .",
    "for example , in the decay of a b - meson to a cp - eigenstate @xmath11 , the time - dependent asymmetry @xmath12 realized from @xmath13 decay determines @xmath1 , where @xmath14 is given by @xmath15 and @xmath16 is a ckm matrix element  @xcite .",
    "this quark - level transition can be studied in a variety of b - meson decays , and departures of the determined time - dependent asymmetry from @xmath1 could signal the presence of non - sm physics , which may occur in @xmath17 mixing , in the decay amplitude , or in both  @xcite .    in this paper , we consider the decay @xmath4 , which is mediated by the @xmath18 transition at one - loop - order in the weak interaction .",
    "the decay @xmath4 is one of several penguin - dominated modes which probe @xmath1 .",
    "in contrast , in @xmath19 decay , and related charmonium modes , the @xmath20 transition operates at tree level . were the time - dependent asymmetries in tree- and penguin - dominated modes to differ , then non - sm physics could be at work in the penguin process  @xcite .",
    "current experimental results suggest that this could be the case  @xcite , though definite conclusions require both experimental results of improved precision and theoretical estimates of the subleading sm corrections .",
    "the numerical size of the sm corrections depend on the specific decay mode , mimicking the appearance of non - sm physics  @xcite , so that the needed estimates demand some care . in this context",
    "it is worth noting that the `` wrong phase '' penguin contribution , proportional to the weak phase of @xmath21 , is particularly small in @xmath19 decay ; indeed , the deviation of the time - dependent asymmetry @xmath22 from @xmath1 is @xmath23  @xcite  it is suppressed by both ckm and loop effects .",
    "thus the comparison of this asymmetry to a `` tree - only '' determination of @xmath1 permits a sensitive assay of new physics in @xmath24 mixing .",
    "currently this last is consistent with @xmath22 , as well as with other determinations of @xmath1 which employ information on the sides of the unitarity triangle , at the @xmath25 level  @xcite . in the case of the penguin modes ,",
    "the wrong - phase penguin is larger as it is suffers only ckm , i.e. , @xmath26 , suppression . in these modes",
    "the computed sm deviations from @xmath1 determine a much - needed baseline against which the experimental results can be assessed for new - physics effects , as new - physics - induced deviations from sin@xmath27 could certainly be channel - dependent as well .",
    "systematic studies of the sm corrections exist  @xcite in a variety of modes .",
    "the @xmath4 mode has received less attention , perhaps due to the ill - known quark structure of the @xmath5  @xcite ; this is a deficiency we wish to remedy .",
    "the @xmath5 is a fairly narrow resonance of non - breit - wigner form which couples to @xmath28 and @xmath29 final states .",
    "the quark structure of the @xmath5 meson is not well established .",
    "much discussion has revolved around whether it is better regarded as a @xmath30 state  @xcite or , perhaps , as a @xmath31 molecule  @xcite .",
    "the theoretical correction relevant to the interpretation of @xmath32 as a measurement of sin@xmath27 comes from the presence of the @xmath33 transition in the decay amplitude , and interconnected issues complicate its analysis . not only",
    "must we consider the possible non-@xmath34 structure of the @xmath35 resonance , but we must also recall that strong final - state interactions exist in @xmath28 scattering in the @xmath36 channel  @xcite .",
    "such final - state interactions give rise to the scalar form factor , and particularly the partial width @xmath37 , which can be computed through the unitarization of a scattering kernel compatible with low - energy constraints  @xcite .",
    "we presume the @xmath5 resonance to be sufficiently narrow relative to the energy released in the @xmath38 decay that we can approximate the full decay amplitude as the product of the two - body decay amplitude @xmath39 with @xmath37 , where we refer to ref .",
    "@xcite for a discussion of the assumptions implicit to this treatment .",
    "in particular , the strong phases associated with the long - distance physics of @xmath35 decay are presumed to be universal and not modified by the b - decay environment , so that the decay - specific phases are captured by the application of qcd perturbation theory in the heavy quark limit to the two - body decay process .",
    "corrections to the picture we employ can be estimated , though not in a systematically improvable way .",
    "for example , so - called final - state rescattering has been estimated for various @xmath40 penguin modes  @xcite , and ozi - violating effects can also be considered , the latter contributing significantly to @xmath41 decay , e.g.  @xcite .",
    "we reserve discussion of the impact of the computed @xmath42 and @xmath43 partial widths , as well as of possible ozi - violating effects , to a subsequent publication  @xcite .",
    "our particular focus is in the study of the sensitivity of our prediction of the cp asymmetries to the assumed quark structure of the @xmath5 ; the latter enters in the evaluation of the hadronic matrix elements of the @xmath44 transition .",
    "a priori one might think such effects to be most important in the assessment of the deviation of @xmath45 from @xmath1 . we proceed in the same vein as cheng and collaborators  @xcite , treating the @xmath5 as a @xmath34 state and employing the qcd factorization approach  @xcite for the hadronic matrix elements .",
    "we differ from this earlier work in the treatment of the @xmath46 form factor .",
    "we then perform a random scan over the theoretical parameter space , after beneke  @xcite , to assess , in part , the sensitivity of the results to the employed hadronic matrix elements and hence to the implicitly assumed structure of the @xmath5 .",
    "let us give a brief outline of this paper .",
    "we begin , in sec .",
    "[ tb ] , with a description of the theoretical framework and briefly review the role of the @xmath18 transition , with @xmath47 , in the determination of the cp - violating parameters @xmath12 and @xmath48 , as well as of the two - body branching ratio .",
    "we present a synopsis of the pertinent qcd factorization formulae as well . in sec .",
    "[ rnd ] we present the input parameters we use in our numerical calculations , reporting the cp - violating parameters which result from the use of our defined `` default '' set of input parameters .",
    "it should be emphasized that the factorization theorem from which the qcd factorization approach follows holds only at leading power in the heavy quark mass , and the estimate of @xmath49 power suppressed terms , though of apparent phenomenological importance , is uncertain .",
    "thus our random scan over the theoretical parameter space , effected to explore the possible range of @xmath50 and @xmath51 , takes both uncertainties in the theoretical inputs and in the assessment of the @xmath52 corrections into account .",
    "we report these results in sec .",
    "[ rnd ] as well .",
    "we conclude with a summary of our results and an outlook on future work in sec .",
    "we pattern our analysis after that of beneke , ref .",
    "@xcite , and , indeed , adopt a common notation .",
    "in particular , we employ the qcd factorization framework  @xcite for the computation of the @xmath53 matrix elements  @xcite and perform a random scan over the space of possible input parameters to estimate the uncertainty in their computation .",
    "we begin by recalling that the cp asymmetry @xmath54 into a cp eigenstate @xmath11 is given by @xmath55 here we have neglected @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the width difference of the @xmath38 eigenstates .",
    "we note @xmath58 is the mass difference of the @xmath38 eigenstates , @xmath12 is the cp asymmetry generated by the interference of @xmath38 - @xmath59 mixing and direct decay , and @xmath48 is an asymmetry reflective of direct cp violation .",
    "we recall  @xcite @xmath60 where @xmath61 with the factor @xmath62 characterizing @xmath17 mixing . if we treat the @xmath5 resonance as if it were a stable particle , as in ref .",

    "moreover , we have @xmath73 so that if @xmath74 is small , the functions @xmath75 and @xmath48 show little correlation  @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath75 in the sm shows certain systematic trends with @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "for example , if a color - suppressed tree amplitude @xmath76 contributes to @xmath77 , then @xmath75 is much larger than it would be if it were absent . in the latter event , the @xmath78-quark penguin amplitude @xmath79 drives @xmath77 .",
    "generally , @xmath80 .",
    "if the parameters describing the @xmath81 decay amplitude make @xmath82 small relative to @xmath83 , then @xmath75 can range over a wide array of values .",
    "such large excursions can be controlled , however , by demanding that the amplitudes be consistent with the empirical branching ratios  @xcite . in the case of current interest ,",
    "@xmath53 decay , there is no @xmath76 amplitude , so that we expect @xmath3 to be small on general grounds , and the imposition of a branching ratio constraint should no longer be crucial .",
    "however , we have found exceptional regions in theoretical parameter space for which @xmath84 is small with respect to @xmath79 and thus @xmath50 is large , so that it is , in fact , crucial to apply the branching ratio constraint to eliminate these large excursions .",
    "if we treat @xmath85 decay as a two - body process , then the decay rate is @xmath86 where @xmath87 , as we shall describe in detail , and @xmath88 we recall that the branching ratio is given by @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is the total decay width of @xmath38 meson . in reality",
    ", the @xmath5 is not a stable particle ; rather , it is a resonance which decays to both @xmath28 and @xmath31 final states .",
    "we wish to investigate the role of finite - width effects explicitly in a subsequent publication  @xcite : we neglect them here . to begin , we rewrite the two - body decay amplitude as @xmath91 where the superscript @xmath92 refers to the non - strange and strange quark components of the @xmath5 , respectively , so that @xmath93 we now proceed to calculate the @xmath94 amplitudes .",
    "the decay amplitudes of exclusive hadronic @xmath38-meson decays can be systematically analyzed in a combined expansion of inverse powers of the heavy quark mass @xmath96 and the strong coupling constant @xmath97  @xcite .",
    "the qcd factorization approach , in specific , permits the rigorous computation of these amplitudes , for certain two - body final states , in leading power in @xmath98 and in a power series in @xmath99 , where @xmath100  @xcite .",
    "its starting point is the effective weak hamiltonian for charmless hadronic @xmath38 decay , consisting of a sum of the products of ckm matrix elements , local operators @xmath101 , and wilson coefficients @xmath102 , evaluated in next - to - leading order ( nlo ) precision in @xmath99  @xcite .",
    "some dissension in the literature exists concerning the ingredients of the leading power analysis  @xcite , particularly in regards to the charm - quark penguin contributions  @xcite : in the qcd factorization approach any non - factorizable charm - quark penguin contributions appear in @xmath98 corrections .",

    "this is important for several reasons .",
    "first , the study of such modes is complementary to the study of the @xmath40 transition in @xmath337 mixing .",
    "the hint that the empirical weak phase determined from @xmath337 mixing is larger than the sm prediction  @xcite , if borne out , would require new sources of cp violation beyond that contained in the ckm paradigm .",
    "this makes the confirmation of , or constraints on , such effects in the @xmath40 penguin modes crucial .",
    "generally , we would like to assess the possible deviation of @xmath338 , the time - dependent cp asymmetry , from sm physics in a robust way , so that we can determine what new physics , if any , exists in these decay modes .",
    "to that end , the @xmath336 final state itself is of intrinsic interest .",
    "the time - dependent cp asymmetry in this case has no color - suppressed tree contribution ; it is intrinsically subject to less theoretical uncertainty than modes in which such contributions are present .",
    "moreover , its empirical study can be complementary to that of another theoretically clean process : @xmath339 , as both modes occupy the @xmath340 dalitz plot .",
    "indeed , @xmath341 and @xmath339 , assuming the @xmath342 to be ideally mixed , are the only known @xmath40 penguin modes which have no color - suppressed tree contributions .",
    "we have investigated the size of @xmath50 , i.e. , the deviation of @xmath338 from @xmath1 , in the @xmath256 decay process in the sm using the qcd factorization approach , assuming the @xmath35 to be a @xmath6 state .",
    "we employ a parameter scan to probe a broad range of possible theoretical models , exploring variations in the inputs at the 3@xmath8 level and ill - known @xmath52 corrections with 100% uncertainty .",
    "the @xmath256 decay mode has been studied by other authors within the qcd factorization approach  @xcite .",
    "our calculation differs most significantly from this earlier work in its treatment of the @xmath134 form factor , for which , for concreteness , we employ the cqm approach of refs .",
    "the earlier work simply asserts that the @xmath134 form factor ought be comparable to that of @xmath343 . our numerical studies support this , though we assign a large uncertainty to our assessment .",
    "the parameter scan technique we employ borrows heavily from the work of beneke  @xcite , in which the deviations to @xmath338 from @xmath1 were studied for the @xmath344 decay modes .",
    "that work eschewed the @xmath341 decay mode due to the uncertain @xmath34 structure of the @xmath35  @xcite ; thus we have studied the possible numerical uncertainty incurred by this with great care .",
    "our work also differs from beneke s in that we explore the theoretical model space for input parameters which vary within 3@xmath8 of their default values , as well as identify the parameter morphologies which give the largest excursions in @xmath50 .",
    "the assumed quark structure of the @xmath5 does enter in the evaluation of the hadronic matrix elements and in the assessment of the @xmath35 decay constant and the @xmath134 form factor in particular .",
    "we have investigated the range of @xmath50 which results from varying either the @xmath134 form factor and the @xmath35 scalar decay constant , after imposing the branching ratio constraint , giving @xmath334 $ ] for variations within 1@xmath8 and @xmath335 $ ] for variations within 3@xmath8 .",
    "the value of @xmath50 is simply not sensitive to the value of the @xmath345 form factor and the @xmath35 decay constant .",
    "although we can accommodate the experimental branching ratio in a @xmath34 model of the @xmath35 , we can not draw conclusions concerning the structure of the @xmath35 on the basis of our analysis .",
    "let us summarize our results for the range of @xmath50 and @xmath51 , which emerge from a scan of the complete theoretical parameter space , allowing for uncertainties in the infrared - cutoff dependent @xmath52 corrections , which we characterize by the parameters @xmath170 and @xmath169 .",
    "in limited regions of the parameter space , the @xmath84 amplitude can become small , driving large excursions in @xmath50 .",
    "such excursions are removed , however , by demanding that the theoretical model confront the empirical branching ratio up to some tolerance , that is , up to 1@xmath8 for the 1@xmath8 scans and up to 3@xmath8 for the 3@xmath8 scans .",
    "once we demand that our theoretical models satisfy the branching ratio constraint , the possible seed averaged range in @xmath3 is greatly reduced , giving @xmath289 $ ] and @xmath10 $ ] for the scans in which the parameters are allowed to range within 1@xmath8 and 3@xmath8 of their central values , respectively . in comparison , we find that @xmath51 ranges over @xmath294 $ ] and @xmath293 $ ] , respectively",
    ". generally , we find @xmath263 to be sufficiently small that the values of @xmath50 and @xmath51 are uncorrelated , note fig .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that we estimate the ranges using the extremal values of our parameter scans .",
    "this is a conservative approach .",
    "if we were to define the range of @xmath50 to capture , e.g. , 95% of the models about its most likely value in theory space , we would have much smaller ranges . retaining our current approach",
    ", we could also sharpen our estimates once improved measurements of the branching ratio become available .",
    "nevertheless , let us proceed to compare our range for @xmath50 with the empirical result .",
    "the time - dependent cp asymmetry induced by the interference between @xmath346 mixing and direct decay , as well as the direct cp asymmetry , measured by belle and babar  @xcite are @xmath347 and @xmath348 , respectively .",
    "the value of @xmath1 measured by belle and babar  @xcite in @xmath349 decays and related charmonium modes is @xmath350 , so that the empirical value of @xmath50 is @xmath351 for the @xmath352 decay mode .",
    "its error is substantially larger than our largest estimated value of @xmath50 , so that further refinement of the experimental results is warranted . if we compare our results with those of ref .",
    "@xcite for the @xmath344 decay modes , we see that the @xmath53 mode compares favorably : it yields small values of @xmath75 , as do the @xmath353 and @xmath354 modes .",
    "since both @xmath341 and @xmath339 decays lack color - suppressed tree contributions , the estimation of @xmath75 should be particularly reliable , so that significant differences in the empirical values of @xmath75 in these modes could truly signal new physics .",
    "we find that the largest single variation in our predictions of the decay amplitudes come from the uncertainty associated with the inverse moment of @xmath38 meson distribution amplitude @xmath230 which enters the decay amplitude through the hard scattering terms . in our scans for which the parameters range over 3@xmath8 of their central values",
    ", the hard scattering terms can dominate over all other terms in the decay amplitude and produce large values of the @xmath330 amplitudes .",
    "the cancellation of @xmath326 with @xmath327 reflected in the default values of the parameter set is no longer possible for such large values of the hard scattering amplitude .",
    "this mechanism generalizes to any other mode where @xmath326 and @xmath327 interfere destructively",
    ". however , these large excursions in the @xmath330 amplitudes do not generate large excursions in @xmath50 , as they also act to enhance the charm penguin amplitude .",
    "nevertheless , the extremal values of @xmath50 , and its negative values in particular , do come from the uncertainties associated with @xmath230 , @xmath170 , and @xmath169 .",
    "one expects this observation to be relevant to other @xmath40 mode as well , though if there is a color - suppressed tree amplitude , there is more freedom for @xmath305 to be large .    in future studies we would like to consider how the finite width of the @xmath5 resonance can impact the value of @xmath3 determined from @xmath355 and @xmath356 decay processes .",
    "in particular , we wish to consider the role of the @xmath357 and @xmath358 scalar form factors , as well as that of possible ozi - violating effects , in the determination of @xmath3 in a later publication  @xcite .",

    "explicit expressions for these amplitudes in terms of the light - cone distribution amplitudes for scalar and pseudoscalar mesons are given in @xcite .",
    "the general expressions for the leading - twist , light - cone distribution amplitudes for pseudoscalar and scalar mesons are written as @xmath362 here @xmath363 is zero , as are all the even gegenbauer moments , in the su(3 ) limit . in order to present simple expressions for the @xmath361 amplitudes , we truncate the expansion of the pseudoscalar meson after the second gegenbauer polynomial and that of the scalar meson after the third gegenbauer polynomial .",
    "we perform the integration over the light - cone distribution amplitudes in such a way that we always have @xmath364 , where @xmath365 we retain finite @xmath366 throughout the calculation and put @xmath367 only at the end to avoid dropping finite contributions .",
