    "the loewner equation @xcite is an important result in the theory of univalent functions @xcite that has found important applications in nonlinear dynamics , statistical physics , and conformal field theory @xcite . in its most basic formulation , the loewner equation is a first - order differential equation for the conformal mapping @xmath0 from a given `` physical domain , '' consisting of a complex region @xmath1 minus a curve @xmath2 emanating from its boundary , onto a `` mathematical domain '' represented by @xmath1 itself .",
    "usually , @xmath1 is either the upper half - plane or the exterior of the unit circle , but recently the loewner equation for the channel geometry was also considered @xcite .",
    "the loewner equation depends on a driving function , here called @xmath3 , that is the image of the growing tip under the mapping @xmath0 .",
    "an important development on the theory of the loewner equation was the discovery by schramm @xcite that when the driving function @xmath3 is a brownian motion the resulting loewner evolution describes the scaling limit of certain statistical mechanics models .",
    "this result spurred great interest in the so - called stochastic loewner equation @xcite .",
    "recently , the deterministic loewner equation was used to study the problem of laplacian fingered growth in both the half - plane and radial geometries @xcite as well as in the channel geometry @xcite . in this class of models",
    "the growth takes place only at the tips of slit - like fingers and the driving function @xmath3 has to follow a specific time evolution in order to ensure that the tip grows along gradient lines of the corresponding laplacian field . in spite of its simplicity",
    ", the model was able to reproduce some of the qualitative behavior seen in experiments on fingered growth @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , treating the fingers as infinitesimally thin is a rather severe approximation and so this `` thin '' finger model is applicable only if the width of the fingers is much smaller than the separation between fingers . on the other hand , there are other instances of laplacian growth where `` extended fingers '' ( i.e. , fingers with a finite , non - negligible width ) are observed @xcite and for such cases a description in terms of loewner evolutions is still lacking .",
    "one of the main motivations of this paper is to seek to develop a framework based on the loewner equation in which one can study more general growth problems in two dimensions .",
    "we start our analysis by first revisiting the problem of fingered growth discussed in @xcite and report here a novel exact solution for the case of a symmetrical configuration with three fingers .",
    "we then move on to discuss a general class of growth models where an interface grows into the upper - half plane starting from a segment on the real axis . in our model , the growth rate",
    "is specified at a certain number of special points along the interface , referred to as `` tips '' and `` troughs '' , which then determine the growth rate at the other points of the interface according to a specific growth rule ( formulated in terms of a polygonal curve in the mathematical plane ) . by making appropriate use of the schwarz - christoffel transformation , we are then able to derive the loewner equation for the problem .",
    "several examples are given in which the interface evolution is numerically computed by a direct integration of the loewner equation .",
    "we also briefly discuss a more general formulation of the loewner equation for interface growth in the upper - half plane where the growth rule is given in terms of a time evolving measure .",
    "this approach may open up the possibility for studying other interesting growth problems , such as the growth of fractal interfaces @xcite , within the context of stochastic loewner evolutions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] we briefly review the problem of fingered growth in the upper half - plane in the context of the chordal loewner equation and report a new solution for a symmetrical configuration with three fingers . in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] we discuss a general class of growth models in which the growing domain is delimited by an interface in the upper half - plane . here",
    "we first derive in sec .",
    "[ sec:3a ] a new loewner equation for the case in which the growth rule is specified in terms of a polygonal curve in the mathematical plane .",
    "several several examples are given in sec .",

    "we then briefly discuss in sec .",

    "our main results and conclusions are summarized in sec .",
    "[ sec:4 ] .",
    "in order to set the stage for the remainder of the paper and to establish the relevant notation , we begin our discussion by briefly reviewing the problem of fingered growth in the context of the chordal loewner equation . to this end",
    "we consider first the simplest loewner evolution , namely , that in which a curve starts from the real axis at @xmath4 and then grows into the upper half-@xmath5-plane @xmath6 , where @xmath7 the curve at time @xmath8 is denoted by @xmath9 and its growing tip is labeled by @xmath10 .",
    "now let @xmath0 be the conformal mapping that maps the `` physical domain , '' corresponding to the upper half-@xmath5-plane minus the curve @xmath2 , onto the upper half - plane of an auxiliary complex @xmath11-plane , called the `` mathematical plane , '' i.e. , we have @xmath12 , where @xmath13 with the curve tip @xmath10 being mapped to a point @xmath3 on the real axis in the @xmath11-plane , as shown in fig .  [ fig:1 ] .",
    "furthermore , we consider the growth process to be such that the accrued portion of the curve from @xmath8 to @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is an infinitesimal time interval , is mapped under @xmath16 to a vertical slit in the mathematical @xmath11-plane ; see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "the mapping function @xmath0 must also satisfy the initial condition @xmath17 since we start with an empty upper half - plane .",

    "the mapping @xmath20 maps the curve @xmath2 onto a segment of the real axis on the @xmath11-plane , whereas the accrued portion of the curve during the infinitesimal time interval @xmath15 is mapped to a vertical slit .",

    ", say @xmath27 , with the curve @xmath2 representing a finger - like advancing interface between the two phases .",
    "( here the finger is assumed to be infinitesimally thin . ) the complex potential for the problem can then be defined as @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the function harmonically conjugated to @xmath25 . on the boundary of the physical domain ,",
    "consisting here of the real axis together with the curve @xmath2 , we impose the condition @xmath27 , whereas at infinity we assume a uniform gradient field , @xmath30 , or alternatively , @xmath31 from this point of view , the mapping function @xmath16 introduced above corresponds precisely to the complex potential @xmath32 of the problem . in particular , the fact that in the @xmath11-plane the curve grows along a vertical line implies that the finger tip grows along gradient lines in the @xmath5-plane . to specify completely a given physical model , one has also to prescribe the interface velocity , which is usually taken to be proportional to some power @xmath33 of the gradient field :",
    "@xmath34 we anticipate that for a single growing finger the specific velocity model is not relevant in the sense that the finger shape will be independent of the exponent @xmath33 , which only affects the time scale of the problem .",
    "( for multifingers , however , different @xmath33 s may yield different patterns @xcite . )    for convenience of notation , we shall represent the mathematical plane at time @xmath14 as the complex @xmath19-plane and so we write @xmath35 .",
    "now consider the mapping @xmath36 , from the upper half-@xmath19-plane onto the mathematical domain in the @xmath11-plane ; see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "the mapping function @xmath37 can then be given in terms of @xmath16 by @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the inverse of @xmath40 .",
    "the above relation governs the time evolution of the function @xmath0 and naturally leads to the loewner equation . a standard way of showing this is to construct the slit mapping @xmath40 explicitly , substitute its inverse in ( [ eq:1f ] ) , and then take the limit @xmath41 .",
    "one then finds the so - called _ chordal loewner equation _ : @xmath42 together with the condition @xmath43 so that @xmath44 const . , which implies that the tip @xmath45 simply traces out a vertical line in the @xmath5-plane .",
    "the growth factor @xmath46 is related to the tip velocity by @xcite @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the inverse of @xmath16 .",
    "as already anticipated , we can take @xmath49 ( which corresponds to @xmath50 ) by reparametrizing the time coordinate . in the case of multiple growing fingers @xcite ,",
    "the chordal loewner equation becomes @xmath51 with the time evolution of the singularities @xmath52 given by @xmath53 we recall that conditions ( [ eq:12 ] ) ensure that the fingers grow along gradient lines , meaning that the path traced by each finger tip @xmath54 from time @xmath8 to @xmath14 is mapped by @xmath16 onto a vertical slit .",
    "notice also that if the growth factors @xmath55 are all the same they can be assumed to be constant , say , @xmath56 ( which corresponds to @xmath50 ) , since this amounts to a mere rescaling of the time variable . for two symmetrical fingers , i.e. ,",
    "@xmath57 , equation ( [ eq:11 ] ) can be integrated exactly to yield the mapping function @xmath0 , from which the finger shapes can be computed analytically @xcite . a related exact solution for two fingers",
    "was reported in @xcite .",
    "an exact solution for @xmath16 can also be obtained for a symmetrical configuration with three fingers where the middle finger grows vertically , say , along the @xmath58 axis , and the two flanking fingers are the mirror images of one another with respect to the @xmath58 axis .",
    "this situation is attained by choosing identical growth factors , @xmath59 , and symmetrical initial conditions , @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "this initial symmetry is , of course , preserved by the dynamics and so we have @xmath62 and @xmath63 for all @xmath64 , which implies from ( [ eq:12 ] ) that @xmath65 using this result one can integrate exactly the loewner equation ( [ eq:11 ] ) and obtain , after a straightforward calculation , the positions @xmath66 of the tips of the flanking fingers in terms of the following implicit equation @xmath67^{1+\\alpha}[\\gamma_{1,3}(t)^2-\\beta_{-}]^{1-\\alpha}=(1-\\beta_{+})^{1+\\alpha}(1-\\beta_{-})^{1-\\alpha}(a_{0}^2 + 3d_{0}t)^{2 } , \\label{eq:3f}\\ ] ] where @xmath68 and @xmath69 . in ( [ eq:3f ] )",
    "one considers only the roots that lie in the upper - half plane and satisfy the initial condition @xmath70 . in fig .",
    "[ fig:2a ] we plot this solution for @xmath71 and @xmath72 . from this figure",
    "one can see that the side fingers are ` repelled ' by the middle finger and tend to straight lines for sufficiently large times .",
    "in fact , one can verify from ( [ eq:3f ] ) that in the asymptotic limit @xmath73 the flanking fingers approach the straight lines arg@xmath74 and arg@xmath75 .",
    "if the growth factors are kept all equal but the initial condition is no longer symmetric , then the middle finger will initially be more repelled by the closest finger , thus leading to a symmetrical configuration in the limit @xmath73 where the asymptotic ( vertical ) position of the middle finger now depends on the initial condition . on the other hand ,",
    "if the growth factors are not all the same then the finger with greatest @xmath76 will grow faster and screen the others . here",
    ", however , the screening is partial in the sense that the ratio between the velocity of a slower finger and that of the fastest finger reaches a positive constant ( different from unity ) .",
    "an example of this case is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2b ] for the early stages of a three - finger evolution . in order to generate the curves shown in this figure we used the numerical scheme described in @xcite .",
    "more specifically , we start with the `` terminal condition '' @xmath77 and integrate the loewner equation ( [ eq:11 ] ) backwards in time , using a runge - kutta method of second order , to get the position of the respective tip @xmath78 .",
    "we dealt with the pole singularities in ( [ eq:11 ] ) in a manner similar to that used in @xcite , which in our case meant finding the appropriate root of a fourth - degree polynomial that gives the value of @xmath79 at time @xmath80 , from where the loewner can be integrated backwards to yield @xmath81 .",
    "it is interesting to notice that the curves in fig .",
    "[ fig:2b ] resemble certain fingering patterns seen in combustion experiments , see , e.g. , fig .",
    "1e of ref .",
    "@xcite , even though the solutions above are valid for the upper - half plane , whereas the experiments take place in a channel geometry , and we have used constant growth factors ( although with different values for each finger ) rather than equation ( [ eq : dteta ] ) .    before leaving this section we wish to recall here that the evolution entailed by the chordal loewner equation , as given by ( [ loewner ] ) or ( [ eq:11 ] ) , describes a rather general class of `` local growth '' processes @xcite in which there is one curve or a set of curves growing from the real axis into the upper - half plane @xmath6 .",

    "the different curves are for the same times as in fig .",
    "[ fig:8].,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig:10 ] we show for comparison the case in which the two tips have identical growth factors but where the interfaces now have different initial widths .",
    "we can see from this figure that the wider interface grows faster than the narrower one .",
    "this competition between the two growing interfaces resembles the so - called  shadowing effect \" in fingering phenomena , whereby the longer fingers grow faster and hinder the growth of the shorter fingers in their vicinities @xcite .",
    "[ a similar effect is obtained if we start with interfaces of equal width but with one of the tips having a larger growth factor than the other one .",
    "] we have thus seen that in spite of its simplifying assumptions , chiefly among them the unbounded geometry and the polygonal growth rule , our model exhibits certain dynamical features such as finger competition and screening that are qualitatively similar to what is commonly observed in laplacian growth processes @xcite .",
    "we will show next that it is possible , in principle , to extend the model to include more general growth rules that may describe more accurately the dynamics of specific growth processes .",
    "here we consider from a more formal viewpoint the loewner evolution of a family of increasing hulls @xmath91 in the upper - half plane @xmath6 .",
    "we denote by @xmath186 the growing interface at time @xmath8 and consider the mapping @xmath187 that maps @xmath9 to the interval @xmath188 $ ] on the real axis . to specify the growth rule let us consider the infinitesimal hull @xmath189 in the @xmath11-plane , where @xmath15 is an infinitesimal time step .",
    "note that in the growth models of sec .",
    "[ sec:3a ] the hull @xmath190 corresponds to the interior of the polygon defined by @xmath191 and the real axis ; see fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] . here",
    "we consider more general growth problems in which @xmath190 is not necessarily bounded by a piecewise - linear curve in @xmath6 . to be more precise , we consider the infinitesimal hull @xmath192 made of the set of points included between the real axis and the curve @xmath193 , @xmath194 , with @xmath88 real .",
    "we assume that @xmath195 is a simple curve that is at least twice differentiable .",
    "let us now denote by @xmath196 and @xmath197 the endpoints of the curve @xmath195 , that is , @xmath198 , where @xmath199 and @xmath200 .",
    "note that in the general case one has @xmath201 and @xmath202 , which allows for the endpoints @xmath203 and @xmath204 of the growing interface @xmath9 to move as time goes by .",
    "thus , in contrast with the model discussed earlier , here the endpoints are not necessarily kept fixed .",
    "let us now introduce a partition of the interval @xmath205 $ ] : @xmath206 , and let @xmath207 the piecewise - linear approximation of @xmath195 defined by this partition : @xmath208 , with @xmath207 , for @xmath209 $ ] , being given by a straight line .",
    "it is clear that the evolution entailed by the polygonal curve @xmath207 is described in terms of the loewner equation ( [ eq:1 ] ) .",
    "if we now take the limit @xmath210 , we then get the following evolution equation : @xmath211\\ln[g_{t}(z)-x]dx ,   \\label{eq : ld}\\ ] ] where @xmath212 with prime denoting derivative with respect to the argument @xmath88 .",
    "since the shape of the growing domain is fully encoded in the map @xmath16 , equation ( [ eq : ld ] ) specifies the growth model once the density @xmath213 is known .",
    "note that the class of interface growth models described in sec .",
    "[ sec:3a ] corresponds to the case when the density is a finite sum of dirac @xmath89 peaks .",
    "more generally , if we introduce a signed measure @xmath214 satisfying the conditions @xmath215 @xmath216 which are the analog of ( [ eq : sumd ] ) and ( [ eq : sd2 ] ) , we can then define the loewner evolution generated by this measure by the following equation @xmath217\\ln[g_{t}(z)-x ] d\\mu_{t}(x ) .",
    "\\label{eq : ldmu}\\ ] ] here the time evolution of the measure @xmath218 encodes the growth rule .",
    "we refer to ( [ eq : ldmu ] ) as `` loewner domains '' in contrast to the `` loewner chains '' discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] .",
    "although loewner domains can be regarded as equivalent to loewner chains  indeed , the densities @xmath219 and @xmath213 are obviously related to one another , the former description seems to be more convenient for the study of growing interfaces ( which encircle domains with nonzero area ) . from a more practical viewpoint , however ,",
    "the difficult task that remains in the case of loewner domains is to find the appropriate measure for physically relevant growth problems . in this context ,",
    "an interesting open question concerns the possibility of generating rough ( i.e. , fractal ) interfaces by means of a loewner evolution driven by random measures , in analogy with the stochastic loewner equation where random curves are produced @xcite .",
    "we have considered the problem of two - dimensional laplacian growth in the context of the loewner evolutions . we started by revisiting the problem of fingered growth and reported a novel exact solution of the chordal loewner equation for the case of a symmetrical three - finger configuration .",
    "we then discussed a more general class of growth models in which an interface grows from the real axis into the upper - half plane . assuming that the growth rule is specified in terms of a polygonal domain in the complex - potential plane and making appropriate use of the schwarz - christoffel transformation , we derived the corresponding loewner equation for the problem .",
    "several examples were explicitly discussed , such as the case of a single `` extended finger , '' an interface with two tips , and the case of two competing interfaces . although our model does not allow for a direct comparison with experiments , we have argued that its dynamics is reminiscent of certain typical behaviors seen in laplacian growth .",
    "we have also briefly discussed a possible extension of our loewner equation to include the case in which the growth rule is specified in terms of a generic ( not necessarily polygonal ) curve .",
    "more generally , we have introduced the notion of `` loewner domains '' in which the growth rule is described in terms of a time evolving signed measure .",
    "this opens up the possibility for studying other interesting ( and difficult ) problems , such as the growth of fractal interfaces , within the context of stochastic loewner evolutions .",
    "the extension to the radial geometry of the class of growth models discussed here is another interesting open problem ."
