    "the planned experiments @xcite for the observation of an @xmath5 plasma created from the vacuum in the focal spot of two counter - propagating optical laser beams with the intensity @xmath6 w/@xmath7 raises the problem of an accurate theoretical description of the experimental manifestations of the dynamical schwinger effect @xcite , see also refs .",
    "the existing prediction @xcite in the domain of strongly sub - critical fields @xmath8 of a considerable number of secondary annihilation photons is not rather convincing because it is based on the s - matrix approach for the description of quasiparticle excitations in the presence of a strong external electric field .",
    "in particular , this approach does not take into account vacuum polarization effects .",
    "apparently , an adequate approach for the description of vacuum excitations in strong electromagnetic fields is a kinetic theory in the quasiparticle representation .",
    "the simplest kinetic equation ( ke ) of such type for the @xmath5 subsystem has been obtained for the case of linearly polarized , time dependent and spatially homogeneous electric fields @xcite .",
    "some generalizations of the ke in the fermion sector have been worked out in refs .",
    "it can be expected , that electromagnetic field fluctuations of the @xmath5 plasma are accompanied by the generation of real photons which can be registered far from the focal spot .",
    "the first two equations of the bbgky chain for the photon sector of the @xmath5 plasma were obtained in @xcite .",
    "this level is sufficient for the kinetic description of the one - photon annihilation . in the presence of an external field such process",
    "is not forbidden @xcite . in the works",
    "@xcite it was shown that the spectrum of the secondary photons in the low frequency domain @xmath9 has the character of the flicker noise . in the work @xcite the inclusion of vacuum polarization effects in the one - photon radiation spectrum led to an essential change of the photon ke which was investigated in a broad spectral band including the annihilation domain @xmath10 .",
    "first we have considered the domain of large adiabaticity parameters @xmath11 , where the photon radiation from the focal spot turns out to be very small .",
    "however , the tendency of the effect to grow for @xmath12 has been discovered .",
    "this is just the domain of practical interest for parameters of modern lasers .    in the present work",
    "the effective mass model is considered which allows to investigate the photon radiation in the domain of rather strong fields not restricted to specific values of the adiabacity parameter .",
    "some crude estimations in the framework of this model @xcite lead to an unexpectedly large total photon production intensity .",
    "we will proceed from the photon kinetic equation @xmath13 for the one - photon annihilation mechanism taking into account vacuum polarization effects in the low density approximation @xcite . in eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the photon and electron ( positron ) distribution functions , respectively , @xmath16 is the wave vector of the radiated photon and @xmath17   \\label{2}\\]]is the high frequency phase .",
    "the two - time convolution @xmath18 of the four - spinors is a slowly varying function of its variables and can be replaced by its average @xmath19 , which is sufficient for coarse estimations .",
    "the effective mass model @xcite is based on the approximation@xmath20with the effective mass defined by the relation @xmath21where @xmath22 denotes the time averaging operation , @xmath23 is the frequency of the periodic laser field and @xmath24 is its field strength amplitude , @xmath25 is the adiabaticity parameter .    in this approximation",
    "the phase ( [ 2 ] ) becomes monochromatic @xmath26 @xmath27i.e .",
    "the approximation ( [ 3 ] ) leads to a suppression of multiphoton processes ( it corresponds to the large values of the adiabacity parameter @xmath28 ) and the mismatch ( [ 6 ] ) can be compensated by the harmonics of the fermion distribution functions in eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) only .    the inspection of the fermion distribution function shows , in particular , that it oscillates basically with twice the laser frequency @xmath29 .",
    "\\label{eq:7}\\]]the substitution of eqs .",
    "( [ 5 ] ) and ( [ eq:7 ] ) into the kinetic equation ( [ 1 ] ) allows to perform the time integration , leading to the appearance of two harmonics in the radiation spectrum only ( the 2@xmath30 and the 4@xmath31 ) , @xmath32 @xmath33 @xmath34 it is important that a constant component is absent here , because the mismatch ( [ 6 ] ) could not be compensated in this case by other sources of the time dependence on the r.h.s . of eq .  ( [ 1 ] ) . , where accounting for multi - photon processes in the phase ( [ 2 ] ) leads to a constant component @xcite . ]",
    "thus , in the case of the infinite system the solution ( [ eq:8 ] ) can be interpreted as `` breathing '' of the photon subsystem . however , the situation is changed , when the generation of the @xmath35 plasma is considered in a small spatial domain of the focal spot with volume @xmath36 due to the vacuum condition of the absence of the @xmath35 plasma in the initial moment of switching on the laser field . in this case",
    "one can expect , that all annihilation photons generated in the first half - period of the field will leave the volume of the system and therefore in the next half - period the reverse process ( photon transformation to @xmath5 plasma ) will be impossible .",
    "such a mechanism leads to a pulsation pattern for the photon radiation from the focal spot .",
    "it corresponds to introducing the condition of a positive definite photon production rate on the r.h.s of eq .",
    "( [ eq:8 ] ) .",
    "for estimations of the amplitudes ( [ eq:9 ] ) , ( [ 10 ] ) let us introduce the additional model approximation in the spirit of the model ( [ 3 ] ) @xmath37and the isotropisation condition @xmath38 .",
    "the integrals on the r.h.s of eqs .",
    "( [ eq:9 ] ) , ( [ 10 ] ) can then be calculated .",
    "for example , @xmath39where @xmath40is the root of the equation @xmath41 . from eq .",
    "( [ 13 ] ) it is follows the threshold condition plasma created from vacuum @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath42this condition is rather nontrivial because the effective mass ( [ 4 ] ) depends also on @xmath23 .",
    "the minimal permissible value @xmath43 corresponds to @xmath44 . for",
    "the 4@xmath31 harmonic the threshold value falls to @xmath45 , which is close to the parameters of the xfel @xcite .    the @xmath46 - dependence on the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ 12 ] ) corresponds to the flicker noise .",
    "this feature in the spectrum of radiated annihilation photons has been found first in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the number of photons with the frequency @xmath47 lying in the interval @xmath48 $ ] and radiated from the focal spot with the volume @xmath49 per time interval is @xmath50the fraction on the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ 12 ] ) is a slow function of the frequencies @xmath47 and @xmath23 and for the sake of a preliminary estimation it can be replaced by @xmath51 . for the 2@xmath30 harmonic",
    "we then obtain from eqs .",
    "( [ 12 ] ) and ( [ 15 ] ) @xmath52    as a representative characteristics of the effectiveness of the radiation from the focal spot domain we will consider the total photon number per time interval , @xmath53 the electron and positron distribution functions entering here are defined as the solutions of the corresponding non - perturbative kinetic equation @xcite describing vacuum creation of @xmath5 pairs under the action of a strong , time dependent electric field of a standing wave of two counter propagating laser beams . the cutoff parameter @xmath54 is introduced in order to take into account the annihilation photons in the radiation spectrum .",
    "the fermion distribution function @xmath15 is a rapidly decreasing function with its maximum in the point @xmath55 @xcite . on this basis for a rough estimation one can put @xmath56 in the arguments of these functions on the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ 17 ] ) , @xmath57where according to eq .",
    "( [ 13 ] ) @xmath58because the small @xmath59 is effective in the integral ( [ 18 ] ) . as the result , we obtain the following order of magnitude estimate @xmath60    for the xfel  parameters @xmath61 and @xmath62 nm @xcite we have according to the kinetic theory in the @xmath5 sector @xmath63 . from eq .",
    "( [ 20 ] ) then follows @xmath64 for the 4@xmath31 harmonic with the oscillation amplitude ( [ 10 ] ) the threshold for the generation of annihilation photons is lowered ( see discussion after eq .",
    "( [ 14 ] ) ) but the intensity of the photon radiation is also lowered so that the order of magnitude of ( [ 21 ] ) remains unchanged .",
    "we have considered the effective mass model @xcite which allows a rather simple solution of the kinetic equation describing ( in the framework of the one - photon annihilation mechanism ) the photon radiation from the focal spot of two counter - propagating laser beams .",
    "this simple model leads to considerable depletion of the spectrum of parametric oscillations of the @xmath35 plasma : only the 2@xmath30 and 4@xmath31 harmonics remain due to the condition of the absence of a constant component in the photon production rate .",
    "thus a compensation of the mismatch ( [ 6 ] ) is possible by means of these two harmonics only .",
    "the domain of applicability of this model is limited to the x - ray domain of the laser radiation .",
    "the model suggests a high integral luminosity of @xmath65 photons per sec from the focal spot .",
    "other features of the model are : the @xmath46-behavior in the infrared domain @xmath9 ( the flicker noise of electrodynamic nature ) and the threshold effect .",
    "these results are encouraging for a further detailed study of the photon kinetics on the basis of the one - photon annihilation mechanism in the domain of small adiabacity parameters @xmath66 .",
