    "thus , theoretical calculations have been performed mostly within the isolated - vortex approximation in the b phase,@xcite or within a constant amplitude in the a phase,@xcite both of which are justified near @xmath18 , and not much has been known about the phases realized in rapid rotation . on the other hand ,",
    "the polar state should be stable near @xmath4 at all pressures , as shown by schopohl@xcite and later by scharnberg and klemm@xcite in a different context of @xmath1-wave superconductivity .",

    "thus , the phase near @xmath4 is completely different from the experimentally observed a and b phases at @xmath19 , and there should be novel phases between @xmath18 and @xmath4 .",
    "although @xmath17 rad / s may not be attainable in the near future , clarifying the whole phase diagram of @xmath20 would stimulate experimental efforts towards the direction ; it certainly remains as an intellectual challenge .",
