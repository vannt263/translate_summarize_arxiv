    "the statistical mechanics of polyelectrolytes has recently been the object of much research , of both analytical nature and simulations , ranging from a description of the flexible single - chain properties  @xcite to the properties of the dense melts in collective coordinates  ( refs 8 - 10 and references therein ) .",
    "the presence of the long - ranged coulomb interactions makes such systems completely different to uncharged ones .",
    "underlying many of these approaches is the electrostatic screened interaction according to debye - hckel , of the form @xmath0 here @xmath1 represents the screening parameter , or its inverse the debye - hckel screening length , and @xmath2 is called the bjerrum length , @xmath3 here @xmath4 is the dielectric constant of the fluid , and @xmath5 the temperature multiplied by the boltzmann constant .",
    "the parameter , @xmath1 , is proportional to the bjerrum length and to the concentration of the counterions .",
    "its inverse is the debye screening length .",
    "the effective potential can be derived from the linearized poisson - boltzmann equation@xcite or by utilizing collective density variables together with the random phase approximation in statistical mechanics ( rpa ) approach@xcite and integration over salt and counterion degrees of freedom , which procedure again reproduces that form of effective screened interaction . in other models the mean spherical approximation ( msa ) is used.@xcite however , whether the yukawa form of the pairwise potential is truly accurate for macromolecular systems still remains a debatable question and even for the understanding of the critical behavior in the case of the simple electrolyte a debate concerning an appropriate minimal model exists ( see , e.g. levin and fisher@xcite ) .    on the statistical mechanical level ,",
    "the properties of the single chain have been under much discussion as to the precise dependence upon @xmath1 of the properties of the chain , which is expected to behave as with an enhanced persistence length due to the electrostatic interaction .",
    "recent approaches to the problem are a treatment by barrat and joanny@xcite and a renormalization treatment by liverpool and stapper.@xcite on the level of systems also of higher than extremely dilute concentrations recent work by muthukumar@xcite has been based upon the assumption of an electrostatically altered effective , gaussian step - length . as regards the implementation of the rpa it has also been shown@xcite that this approximation produces qualitatively correct results .",
    "it needs to be altered when strong , attractive interactions can cause complexation@xcite or when the effects of the strength of the potential are such that the gaussian assumption must fail .    the dynamics of polyelectrolytes has recently been addressed in scaling - theoretic approach by dobrynin _",
    "et al_.@xcite an important experimental result in those dynamical considerations is the fuoss law@xcite which states the proportionality of the viscosity and the inverse square root of the polyion concentration at sufficiently high densities .",
    "this was recently confirmed by dobrynin , rubinstein and colby.@xcite other treatments of this law have been by witten and pincus@xcite and by rabin.@xcite previously , a theoretical treatment@xcite of the polyelectrolyte solution viscosity has been given by one of the authors by making use of the results of a mode - mode coupling approximation by hess and klein@xcite in which a peak of the viscosity was derived .",
    "recent experimental work by isambert , ajdari , mitnuk , viovy and prost@xcite has highlighted a physical instability of a polyelectrolyte solution occurring when this solution is subjected to an external electric field .    in this paper",
    "we formulate the dynamics of a system of polyions with salt and counterions in the langevin approach , and couple the dynamics of these objects to a solvent which is assumed to be governed by linearized hydrodynamics .",
    "it is possible to bring the different length scales inherent to this problem , i.e. the charge screening length , the hydrodynamic screening and the polymer length , into relation with each other .",
    "it is assumed that the system is sufficiently dense and the chain conformations close to the gaussian ideal to permit the use of a random phase approximation ( rpa ) in the context of the dynamics ( see , e.g. ref 25 ) .",
    "furthermore , it is assumed that linearized hydrodynamic properties of the solvent apply and that the investigation is limited to the semi - dilute regime in which the effects of entanglements of the macromolecular strands can be neglected .",
    "importantly we find that this coupling of the dynamics produces results which are at variance with calculations where an effective debye - screened potential were used straight away .",
    "the paper is outlined as follows .",
    "section  ii introduces the dynamical equations of the model system .",
    "these expressions are reformulated in terms of a set of collective variables and expressed through the formalism of martin , siggia and rose@xcite and of peliti and de dominicis.@xcite the subsequent sections and subsections under iii show the results for computations of the correlation functions : this is the dynamical structure factor from which we draw conclusions about the diffusional behavior .",
    "the final section recounts the results , discusses the hydrodynamic aspects , and concludes on the interplay of the screening lengths .",
    "the model consists of the edwards hamiltonian for the flexible polyions with the excluded volume interaction written up to second virial order with the electrostatic potential containing the appropriate bjerrum length , @xmath6 , for the solvent .",
    "the dielectric constant for the solvent is given by @xmath7 , @xmath5 the boltzmann constant multiplied by the temperature , and @xmath8 is the electronic charge ( for the sake of simplicity only monovalent systems are discussed , although changing valences would present no significant problem in the formalism as used and approximated here . ) .",
    "furthermore , counterions and salt ions occupy the solvent such that overall electrical neutrality is maintained .",
    "we label the four different species of molecule , i.e. polyion , counterion , and the two types of salt ion , by greek subscripts @xmath9 .",
    "there are exactly @xmath10 identical ions of each species , with @xmath11 , which have position coordinates given by @xmath12 , where the contour length @xmath13 is only a relevant variable for the macroions ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "apart from this no further internal degrees of freedom are associated with any of the system constituents .",
    "the complete hamiltonian expresses the flexibility of the chains , the excluded volume contributions and the ( unscreened ) coulomb interaction . @xmath15",
    "the kuhn length of the chains is given by @xmath16 , and the numerator which contains kronecker delta functions of the term expressing the coulomb interaction is a technical description to exclude self - interaction by the point particles .",
    "formally , in order for the general form above to make sense , the lengths , @xmath17 , of the counterions and salt ions are one monomer .",
    "the coulomb interaction is represented by the matrix @xmath18 of the appropriate interaction between the polymer and the counterions of the system : @xmath19 the condition of electrical neutrality implies that @xmath20 must hold .",
    "the quantity @xmath21 represents the constant , linear charge density of the polymer .",
    "the matrix @xmath22 represents the excluded volume interaction between the various components of the system .",
    "the hamiltonian and the hydrodynamics then lead to the coupled , stochastic langevin equations of the system for the chain molecules , the counterions , and the fluid velocity field.@xcite when stick boundary conditions are employed the stochastic equations can be written as @xmath23 - \\frac{1}{\\zeta_\\alpha } \\frac{\\delta h}{\\delta { \\bf r}_{p\\alpha}(t ) } + { \\bf f}_{p\\alpha}(t ) = 0 \\\\ { \\bf l}^v & \\equiv & - \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t } { \\bf v}({\\bf x},t ) + \\left\\ { \\eta\\nabla^2{\\bf v}({\\bf x},t ) - \\sum_{p=1}^{n_1 } \\int_0^{l_{1 } } ds\\ , \\frac{\\delta h}{\\delta { \\bf r}_{p1}(s , t)}\\delta\\left({\\bf x}-{\\bf      r}_{p1}(s , t)\\right )   \\right.\\nonumber \\\\ & & - \\left .",

    "we are also working in the case of the incompressible fluid continuum@xcite and , hence , impose the transverse condition upon the velocity field of the fluid of bare viscosity @xmath30 .",
    "the components have friction coefficients @xmath31 which are in general different .",
    "the energy units above have been chosen such that @xmath32 and for subsequent sections the distance units of the polymer will also be chosen such that the prefactor @xmath33 in the hamiltonian vanishes .",
    "we now treat the set of coupled differential equations by using the functional integral approach of martin , siggia and rose@xcite and follow the scheme of fredrickson and helfand@xcite used for uncharged solutions of monodisperse polymers . here",
    "we shall be concerned primarily with the collective behavior of the system dynamics , and , in following the work of fredrickson and helfand , we shall later ignore contributions in the collective variables which are of order higher than two .    by making use of causality and",
    "that the jacobian of the transformation then becomes unity@xcite the functional integral expressions become : @xmath34 \\right\\ } \\right\\rangle .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] angular brackets indicate the averaging over gaussian noise and @xmath35 represents the volume .",
    "following ref  25 we introduce collective variables in terms of collective density and response functions for each species @xmath36 ( with a number , @xmath10 of molecules ) : @xmath37 clearly , the @xmath38 has no meaning when it relates to point - like salt or counterions in the system .    if one were to impose the additional condition that the whole system finds itself in a spatially varying , external field , which oscillates at a frequency @xmath39 , such as @xmath40 the langevin equations in the msr formalism of equation  2.5 would have an additional contribution in the exponent of : @xmath41    the linearized hydrodynamic formulation used here permits the integration over the fluid velocity fields to be performed exactly and enables the determination of the frequency  dependent structure factor of the molecular inclusions from which the diffusion coefficient of these components is derived",
    "consequently , one can write @xmath42 where @xmath43 . the variables and integrals are all expressed in terms of their of fourier representation , the random forces have been integrated and the functional integral over the velocity fields , which occur only to quadratic order , have been performed .",

    "this requires only the consideration of the limits given above .      as a consequence we can write the polymer - polymer structure factor for the case @xmath67 . by recalling the definition of the matrix @xmath60",
    ", this must be the 1,1 element of the inverse , @xmath68 , @xmath69 similar results hold for the cases of the other structure factors of the system .",
    "this is the structure factor of the polymers in the coupled systems of ions and counterions , where there is an excluded volume interaction between the polymer segments , and a dynamic effective interaction , and dynamic alteration to the distribution of the polyions .",
    "when the limits @xmath70 , @xmath71 are taken , the expression becomes equivalent to that of fredrickson and helfand.@xcite    although this factor looks rather complicated , the form of the equation can be simplified significantly by noting the definition of the debye parameter , @xmath72 and by introducing the quantity @xmath73 which differs from the conventional definition of the screening parameter by edwards@xcite by a factor of 4 .",
    "a plot of this structure factor is shown in figure 1 , where convenient values have been used for the parameters .",
    "the polyelectrolyte peak is clearly visible and moves to greater values of @xmath74 with increasing frequency .",
    "the peak has already been discussed in the context of statistical mechanics by various authors.@xcite    we find that broadening together with heightening in both @xmath74 and @xmath75 directions of the polyelectrolyte peak is a result of either a decrease of the polyion charge density or of an increase of debye parameter .      by inspection of the fraction , equation 3.2 ,",
    "it is easy to identify that the numerator is a second order polynomial in @xmath75 and the denominator , when expanded is a polynomial of fourth order in the frequency .",
    "this suggests that the diffusion in the present approximation has two modes , which can be extracted by breaking the expression 3.2 into its partial fractions .",
    "the result of this manipulation is : @xmath76 where the modes associated with the amplitudes @xmath77 and @xmath78 have the following values which have been expanded to their lowest orders in @xmath79 : @xmath80    this behavior to is to be anticipated in a system where there are two components coupled by an interaction such as the coulomb interaction , and has been previously deduced within the context of a far simpler assumption about the dynamics of the polyelectrolyte system .",
    "the mode @xmath81 has already previously been identified as the plasmon mode .",
    "it is not proportional to @xmath79 at large length - scales and agrees with that found by other methods.@xcite    the cooperative diffusion coefficient is given by the expression 3.6 .",
    "here we see that this is also given as in the paper of vilgis and borsali,@xcite with the limiting proportionality @xmath82 .",
    "this is the expected behavior .",
    "we note that in the present scheme of approximation the cooperative diffusion coefficient , @xmath83 , depends upon the interaction only through the linear charge density of the chains and the counterion concentration , whereas the plasmon mode is directly proportional to the bjerrum length .",
    "in the first scheme of integration of section  ii , where the immediate integration over the fluid velocity field degrees of freedom leads directly to the nonlinear term in the polymer density , which is the only term coupling the nature of the interaction into the hydrodynamic description and vice - versa . under the rpa for the transversal components too it is clear that this coupling term plays no contribution whatsoever , and then the dynamics of this system would be exactly as in the case derived by fredrickson and helfand.@xcite for frequencies @xmath84 and at large length scales @xmath67 a macroscopic solution shear viscosity is found @xmath85_{r})$ ] , with the intrinsic viscosity of the rouse model @xmath86_{r}= l\\zeta_{1}12\\eta$].@xcite at length scales below the radius of gyration , fredrickson and helfand find a hydrodynamic screening length @xmath87 , which screens the hydrodynamics such that at the smallest distances the viscosity is again @xmath30 .",
    "this is completely _ independent _ of the nature of the interaction between the polymer segments , as it contains only terms due to the connectivity of the polyion chains .",
    "however , the dynamic scattering intensity derived above can be implemented in an alternative computation of the reduced viscosity in the rouse as well as the zimm cases by making use of the results of hess and klein s mode - mode coupling computations,@xcite as has been done by vilgis , borsali , and benmouna,@xcite by implementation of the formula @xmath88 @xmath89 @xmath90 .",
    "the function @xmath91 represents the particle - particle correlation function .",
    "hitherto this formula could only be implemented by estimating the first cumulant frequency for the dynamical scattering intensity , but here we have already computed this from the more complete dynamical formalism .",
    "we have also shown that in the appropriate limits , the behavior of our more complicated system is like that derived by more conventional means , so we expect the occurrence of a viscosity peak to be qualitatively retained in this formalism .    it should be pointed out that the assumption of homogeneity of the separate constituents of charge and species in the solution , that these are in no way correlated when the gaussian approximation of the collective coordinates is made , provides the approximation which leads to the debye - hckel potential .",
    "this can also be derived in the other approximations , such as the linearization of the poisson - boltzmann equation .",
    "the rpa is valid for systems in which the temperature is high such that the various counterions can be understood to move almost independently and , and when the polymer density is high , such that the chains have a gaussian end - to - end distribution .",
    "the success of this calculation has been tested in many and varied fields .",
    "as has been shown the rpa can be applied to the dynamical case too , with the complicating factor of the occurrence of additional fields ; however , these are also quadratic .    in polyelectrolytes",
    "the effect of the condensation of counterions on the chains has been known for some time ( see refs 31 , 32 and references therein ) .",
    "the critical onset of this condensation for monovalent ions which is derived from models of charged cylindrical objects occurs in manning s theory@xcite when @xmath92 ( and at a lower clustering temperature in the case of solutions of rod - like polyelectrolytes ; see levin@xcite and levin and barbosa.@xcite ) such that we consider here the case of high temperature and low charge density .",
    "indeed , this other regime of counterion condensation on flexible objects is less well understood and would necessitate a different treatment than the rpa .",
    "firstly , it is noticed that the presence of the hydrodynamic interactions generates a term to third order in the density of the fields .",
    "attempts to approximate this as a linear or quadratic contribution to the integrand are bound to fail .",
    "this is because of the decoupling in the rpa of the fields relevant to the transverse and parallel @xmath93 directions .",
    "the cubic term is responsible for the coupling of the hydrodynamic properties of the system to the remaining dynamic properties , and we can see how its neglect , makes the diffusive motion not feature any properties of the solvent , except through the definition of the friction parameter , @xmath94 , where @xmath95 represents the particle radius . in order to understand more fully the role of the coupling ( not only that of the connectivity ) but especially of the nature of the interaction into the hydrodynamic properties , it becomes necessary to use an altered approach to the dynamics .",
    "this falls beyond the scope of this paper , and will be discussed in a subsequent publication.@xcite    we have given the dynamical structure factor of the system under discussion , and shown that it reproduces the polyelectrolyte peak at sufficiently low frequencies .",
    "we have also discussed the diffusive behavior of the system , and reconfirmed the occurrence of the `` plasmon '' mode using the dynamical formalism .",
    "the funding of this work by the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft : schwerpunkt polyelektrolyte is most gratefully acknowledged .",
    "the rpa has been computed before by fredrickson and helfand.@xcite here we present the relevant results for the case @xmath67 .",
    "@xmath96 apart from the nontrivial remaining averages @xmath97 and @xmath98 all remaining pairwise correlations are zero .",
