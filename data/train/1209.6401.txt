    "the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) and the upcoming international linear collider ( ilc ) are expected to perform precision tests of the standard model ( sm ) and explore the new physics at the tev scale @xcite .",
    "the large extra dimensions ( led ) model is one of the scenarios beyond the sm which are proposed to solve the hierarchy problem @xcite .",
    "the led model has only one fundamental scale , @xmath5  tev , and it may induce predictable collider phenomena at both the lhc and the ilc . up to now , many works on both the virtual kaluza - klein ( kk ) graviton exchange and the real kk - graviton production have been presented ; for example , the @xmath6 and @xmath7 processes were studied in the led model in refs.@xcite-@xcite .",
    "in fact , the triple gauge boson ( tgb ) production processes are sensitive to the quartic gauge couplings ( qgcs ) and thus related to the electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism @xcite .",
    "any deviation from the sm prediction hints at the existence of new physics , such as the higgsless or extra dimension signals @xcite . in discriminating physics beyond the sm",
    ", we should investigate the potential contributions from the extension models .",
    "compared with the thoroughly studied diboson production processes in extra dimension models , the tgb productions have been fully studied in the sm @xcite but gained less attention in the led model .",
    "not long ago , the neutral tgb production processes at the lhc , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , were studied in the framework of the led model in ref.@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the possible contributions of the virtual kk - graviton exchange to the @xmath12 and @xmath13 productions at both the lhc and ilc .",
    "the motivation for this work is shown in two fields : firstly , the @xmath12 and @xmath13 processes are directly related to the sm qgcs , namely @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , which are different from the absence of the neutral qgcs in the sm at the tree level @xcite . secondly , although the experimental precision is limited by our understanding of strong qcd background , the lhc can provide more precision measurements of the qgcs than the existing data from lep ii and tevatron searches due to its very high energy and luminosity @xcite . furthermore , in the future , the qgcs can be further probed with higher precision at the ilc due to its cleaner environment @xcite . in this sense , the lhc and the upcoming ilc will provide complementary studies on the tgb production channels . the paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we present the related theory of the led model used in our calculations . in section iii ,",
    "the calculation strategies are presented .",
    "the numerical results and analyses for the @xmath12 and @xmath13 production processes at both colliders are provided in section iv , and a short summary is given in the last section .",
    "in the led model @xcite , the spacetime is @xmath17 with @xmath18 being the number of extra dimensions .",
    "the only fundamental scale @xmath19 unifying the gravity and the gauge interactions is at the tev . to explore the phenomenological effects",
    ", one can extract the low - energy effective theory by the kk reduction in the brane - bulk picture @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "the sm particles are confined on a @xmath20-dimensional brane world volume while the gravity can propagate in the @xmath21-dimensional bulk .",
    "after the assumed torus compactification of the extra dimensions @xmath18 , the usual planck scale @xmath22 in the @xmath20 spacetime is related to the fundamental scale @xmath19 as @xmath23 @xcite , where @xmath24 is the radius of the @xmath18 torus .    in the following calculations , we adopt the de donder gauge for the kk - graviton part , while the feynman gauge ( @xmath25 ) is used for the sm part .",
    "we assume all the momenta flow to the vertices , except that the fermionic momenta are set to be along with the fermion flow directions",
    ". then we list the feynman rules for the relevant vertices and the propagator of spin-2 kk - graviton in the led model below @xcite , where @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 represent the fields of the graviton , fermion , @xmath31 boson , @xmath32 boson and photon , respectively .",

    "it should be understood that the point @xmath63 has been removed from the integration path , and we set the ultraviolet cutoff @xmath62 to be the fundamental scale @xmath19 routinely .",
    "the real part proportional to @xmath64 in eq.([res ] ) is from the narrow resonant production of a single kk mode with @xmath65 and the imaginary part @xmath66 is from the summation over the many nonresonant states .",

    "the leading order ( lo ) feynman diagrams with kk - graviton exchange for ( [ channel-1 ] ) and ( [ channel-2 ] ) channels are shown in figs.[fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] , respectively , while the lo additional feynman diagrams in the led model for the process ( [ channel-3 ] ) are depicted in fig.[fig3 ] .    from these feynman diagrams , one can find that the kk - graviton couples not only to the fermion pair , vector boson pair , and fermion - antifermion - vector boson ( @xmath73 ) , but also to the tgb including charged gauge boson , which is absent in the neutral tgb production processes as shown in ref.@xcite .",
    "therefore , it is natural to expect that kk - graviton in the led model may induce considerable effects at the tev scale on the tgb production processes concerning charged gauge bosons at the lhc and the future ilc .",
    "we express the feynman amplitudes for the partonic processes @xmath74 and @xmath75 as @xmath76 where @xmath77 @xmath78 is the amplitude contributed by the sm - like diagrams , while @xmath79 and @xmath80 are the amplitudes with kk - graviton exchange .",

    "the prime on the sum means averaging over initial spin states as declared for eq.([int - ppvvv ] ) .",
    "in this section , we present the numerical results in both the sm and the led model at the lhc and ilc . for the calculations at the lhc , we use the cteq6l1 pdfs @xcite with @xmath106 and @xmath107 ; the factorization scale is set to be @xmath108 and @xmath109 for the @xmath110 and @xmath111 processes , respectively .",
    "the active quarks are taken as massless , i.e. , @xmath112 , the ckm matrix is set to be the unit matrix .",
    "the other related input parameters are taken as @xcite @xmath113 since the led model is an effective low - energy theory , it breaks down in the non - perturbative region where @xmath114 or above . in order to make reliable and viable phenomenological predictions , we take the hard and conservative truncation scheme as setting the cut @xmath115 for proton - proton collision and the limit @xmath116  tev  @xmath117 for the @xmath105 collision , where @xmath118 and @xmath119 are the partonic and @xmath103-@xmath104 c.m.s energies , respectively . in evaluating the @xmath120 processes , we put a transverse momentum cut @xmath121  gev and a rapidity cut @xmath122 on the final photon in order to get rid of the ir singularity at the tree level .",
