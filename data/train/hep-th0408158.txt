    "in recent years , a whole body of knowledge has been developed about duality between gauge and string theories .",
    "a first point of duality is a remarkable proposal for string theory whose tension is running @xcite and its spectacular implementation in the case of type iib string theory on @xmath0 that turns out to be dual to @xmath1 supersymmetric yang - mills theory @xcite .",
    "although the corresponding string sigma models are still out of control that slows further progress , one can get some fascinating insights from simplified models .",
    "one is that of polchinski and strassler @xcite .",
    "they proposed to build string amplitudes from old - fashioned amplitudes @xmath2 integrated over the tension with an appropriate weight factor as @xmath3 where @xmath4 s and @xmath5 s are momenta and wave functions of particles .",
    "@xmath6 is a radius of @xmath7 .    in the hard scattering limit",
    "such defined amplitudes do fall as powers of momentum as it should be @xcite .",
    "this also shows that @xmath8 is related to a total number of constituents in hadronic states .",
    "more recently it was argued in @xcite that power law behavior is a feature of string amplitudes in warped spacetimes like @xmath7 .    in the regge limit evaluation of the amplitudes",
    "is more subtle .",
    "the result of @xcite based on the approximation of the integral by its dominant saddle point shows that the amplitudes have the desired behavior for special kinematical regions , but otherwise they develop logarithms .",
    "however , the use of semiclassical technique seems questionable as it is not clear what is a large parameter in the problem at hand .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is twofold .",
    "the first is to propose a possible scheme for studying the regge limit that is not based on semiclassical approximation .",
    "the second is to compare values of the regge parameters provided by the model with those of the real world .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we study the regge limit and find the leading corrections to the regge behavior . in section 3 , we discuss the physics behind violation of the regge behavior and compare it with the known technique of resummation of logarithms in qcd . in section 4 ,",
    "we present our estimations of the regge parameters .",
    "we close the paper with a summary and discussions .",
    "in this section we will discuss the regge behavior of the amplitudes .",
    "it is also of some interest to evaluate the leading corrections to it because this issue has not been addressed in the literature .",
    "in contrast , the leading corrections to the scaling have already been discussed in @xcite , where they turned out to be exponential .    as the first example",
    ", we take a tree amplitude of massless vectors in type i theory @xmath9 with a kinematical factor @xmath10 as in @xcite . using eq .",
    ", we get @xmath11 where @xmath12 .",
    "note that one can avoid the poles of the integrand ( @xmath13-functions ) by increasing @xmath14 or by deforming the integration contour in their vicinity .",
    "the integrals can be evaluated by first substituting @xmath15 and then @xmath16 with @xmath17 .",
    "the result is @xmath18 by expanding the exponent we get @xmath19 where @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath21 stands for a pochhammer polynomial .",
    "having derived the series , we can use it to study the regge limit .",
    "it is clear from that the first term simply provides the desired regge behavior , while all higher terms provide contributions that do not have the regge form .",
    "the dominant contributions contain @xmath22 factors .",
    "so , by keeping only such dominant contributions one can think of the series as an expansion in @xmath23 . to illustrate the point , let us consider the amplitude at next - to - leading order .",
    "it is given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 .",
    "using the reflection formula together with @xmath26 for @xmath27 in @xmath28 , we find @xmath29 which implies that the amplitude has the regge behavior with a linear trajectory @xmath30 for a special kinematical region , where @xmath31 from it follows that the leading correction to the regge behavior is logarithmic .",
    "it is straightforward to extend the analysis to type ii theories . as an example , let us take a tree amplitude for massless scalars rewritten as @xmath32 with a kinematical factor @xmath10 as in @xcite , and then modify it according to eq .",
    "@xmath33 where @xmath12 .",
    "note that the integrand as a ratio of @xmath13-functions has poles at @xmath34 .",
    "one can avoid them by increasing @xmath14 or by deforming the integration contour in their vicinity .",
    "the computation proceeds as before .",
    "the result is @xmath35 where @xmath36 .",
    "let us now examine more closely this expansion in the regge limit .",
    "if we restrict to leading order , what we will get is an expansion in @xmath22 again . at next - to - leading order",
    ", the amplitude takes the form @xmath37 where @xmath38 . discarding subleading terms ,",
    "what is left in the limit @xmath39 is @xmath40    thus the amplitude has the desired regge behavior with a linear trajectory @xmath41 for a special kinematical region , where @xmath42 from eq .",
    "it follows that the leading correction to the regge behavior is logarithmic .",
    "if @xmath43 grows , the logarithmic corrections become more and more relevant .",
    "so , it is necessary to resum contributions to all orders in eqs . and .",
    "to see how it works , consider , for instance , the logarithmic terms in .",
    "summing gives is dominated by @xmath44 . ]",
    "@xmath45 we focus on @xmath43-dependence , so @xmath43-independent contributions have been dropped .",
    "the integral is dominated by @xmath46 , and so it is proportional to @xmath47 .",
    "the last factor is of great importance as it is responsible for cancellation ( @xmath48 ) of the prefactor in . as a result",
    ", the regge form is lost .",
    "we end up with @xmath49 we will not attempt a similar derivation in detail for",
    ". however , we claim that the answer is that of @xcite .    to see the physical interpretation , take the amplitude at next - to - leading order ( eq . ) and rewrite it as @xmath50 where @xmath51 .",
    "one line of thought is to think of the right hand side as a string theory with the fixed tension defined by @xmath52 .",
    "if so , then the first term is just the tree amplitude . as to the second , it is nothing else but the one - loop planar amplitude of four massless vectors integrated over a corner of moduli space near @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "we define such a corner as a range between @xmath54 and @xmath55 , where @xmath55 is an arbitrary small parameter .",
    "then , to leading order the integral over the modular parameter gives @xmath56 that allows us to consider both the terms on equal footing .",
    "in fact , this is the case for higher corrections too .    to make the connection to qcd",
    ", we first note that @xmath57 can be expressed as a tree level diagram by virtue of the soft dilaton theorem .",
    "the amplitude then takes the form shown schematically in fig.1 .",
    "second , as noted above , the leading corrections are terms @xmath58 .",
    "one of the approaches to resum the leading logarithms in qcd is that of @xcite . at next - to - leading order ,",
    "gluons can be radiated into the final state .",
    "this effect is shown schematically in fig.2 .",
    "we see that on the string theory side the soft dilatons play a similar role of that of the radiated soft gluons . however , the final results are quite different . in qcd",
    "the resummation leads to the regge behavior , while in the string theory case it destroys such a behavior .",
    "finally , the point about the string models with running tension which may sound surprising is that tree amplitudes might be built in terms of multiloop amplitudes of the theories with fixed tension .",
    "we have provided some evidence supporting this idea .",
    "we believe that the issue is worthy of future study .",
    "from the early days of old - fashioned string theories ( dual resonance models ) it was of great interest to use them for the demands of experiment .",
    "all those models have free parameters which are not predicted by the theory but determined by fitting the experimental data ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . on the other hand",
    ", it became clear later that the string theories are more appropriate for the description of gravity , where a fundamental length is given by the planck length .",
    "if so , a typical slope of trajectories is of order @xmath59 .",
    "neither of these seems acceptable .    having derived the explicit formulae for the slopes , there is too great a temptation to check whether the slopes are able to meet the challenge of the experimental data .",
    "we begin with eq . which corresponds to the pomeron .",
    "as in @xcite , let us define @xmath14 in terms of a typical strong - interaction scale @xmath60 as @xmath61 .",
    "thus , the slope takes the form @xmath62 .",
    "the ratio @xmath63 can be traded for the t hooft coupling constant @xmath64 .",
    "the precise relation is not known , in general , for an arbitrary value of @xmath64 .",
    "we are led therefore to investigate the behavior of the slope by using the original maldacena s relation @xcite @xmath65 valid for large @xmath64 as well as the modified relation    @xmath66    valid for small @xmath64 .",
    "the use of these relations respectively gives @xmath67 and @xmath68 where @xmath69 .",
    "for @xmath70 , @xmath71 mev , and some values of @xmath72 , our estimates are presented in table 1 .",
    ".estimates of the pomeron slope at high scales set by @xmath73 . [ cols= \" < ,",
    "< , < , < , < , < \" , ]     we do not refer to scales where no reliable values of @xmath72 is possible .",
    "the values of the pomeron intercepts are known @xcite @xmath74 the same as the slopes , both the values of the pomeron intercepts are also inside a range of our estimates .",
    "unfortunately , the above simple estimates do not clarify the issue of the existence of two pomerons .",
    "in this paper , we studied the model in the regge limit .",
    "we found that the regge behavior holds for the special kinematical regions , otherwise it is violated by logarithms .",
    "we revealed the physics behind violation and its counterpart in qcd .",
    "we presented the numerical estimates of the regge parameters .",
    "it is quite remarkable that the real values of those are inside a range of ours .",
    "as noted earlier , the missing of control over the string sigma models describing warped spacetime geometries slows further progress in our understanding of gauge / string duality .",
    "it is therefore highly desirable to develop new technique that will allow us to consider more realistic models and apply them to the real world .",
    "our estimations show that even the simplified model of strings in warped spacetimes yields rather fascinating results .",
    "this provides some further evidence that such a direction is worthy of future study .",
