    "when we compare the amplitude of the r@xmath46 and m@xmath49 modes of the @xmath8 , @xmath62 and @xmath12 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : amplimode2 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : amplimode1 ] ) we find that when both the r@xmath46 and m@xmath49 modes are present together in the @xmath12 phase , their amplitude is slightly higher ( 4% larger ) than when condensed alone ( @xmath8 and @xmath62 phases ) .",
    "their combination , however , drives a sizeable gain of energy : the @xmath12 phase is 63 mev and 126 mev lower in energy than the @xmath8 and the @xmath62 phases , respectively .",
    "this means that the combination of the oxygen rotations with the antipolar m@xmath49 mode is much more cooperative than the combination with the polar mode @xmath44 .",
    "the @xmath11 phase can be understood as a distorted @xmath12 phase with additional m@xmath77 oxygen rotations along [ 010 ] .",
    "the resulting tilt pattern is a@xmath21b@xmath29c@xmath22 with a small energy gain of 2 mev with respect to the @xmath12 phase and a reduction of mode amplitudes m@xmath49 , r@xmath46 and m@xmath77 ( 16% , 7% and 22% reduction of the m@xmath49 , r@xmath46 and m@xmath77 modes with respect to the phases where they are condensed alone , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath8 , @xmath62 and @xmath78 , respectively ) .",
    "the m@xmath77 mode competes with the r@xmath46 and m@xmath49 modes in the sense their combination reduces their amplitude , but they cooperate to lower the energy of the system .    in the case of the monoclinc @xmath9 , @xmath1 and triclinic @xmath10 phases , the combination of the m@xmath49 mode with several oxygen rotations ( a@xmath22b@xmath29c@xmath22 for @xmath9 , a@xmath22a@xmath22c@xmath22 for @xmath1 and a@xmath22b@xmath22c@xmath22 for @xmath10 ) lowers the energy of the crystal and with an increase of the mode amplitude with respect to the phases where these modes are condensed independently . for example , the antipolar m@xmath49 mode has his amplitude increased by 11% , 10% and 19% in the @xmath9 , @xmath1 and @xmath10 phases respectively .",
    "this means that the dominant r@xmath46 oxygen rotations cooperate with the antipolar m@xmath49 mode to promote the ground state of wo@xmath0 .",
    "we note that in the @xmath8 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath3 , @xmath62 , @xmath61 , @xmath63 , @xmath12 and @xmath4 phases the mode decomposition shows only the primary modes we have condensed .",
    "this is different with the @xmath64 phase in which a secondary mode x@xmath52 appears with a small amplitude in the mode projections while we have condensed only the primary r@xmath46 and m@xmath77 modes ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : amplimode2 ] ) .",
    "this additional mode appears by improper coupling between the r@xmath46 and m@xmath77 modes such that the symmetry of the @xmath64 structure allows the x@xmath52 mode to develop even though the x@xmath52 mode is not unstable by itself.@xcite similarly , we observe the apparition of several additional secondary modes in the @xmath11 , @xmath9 , @xmath1 and @xmath10 phases , which we discuss in the next section .",
    "explored in our study but not observed experimentally.,width=321 ]    ; comparison between experiments and our calculations with the b1-wc functional are shown.,width=321 ]      the different phases arise from the condensation of one or several unstable modes ( primary modes ) of the cubic parent structure but , in some cases , also include the further condensation of stable modes ( secondary modes ) with significant amplitudes .",
    "often , the appearance of such secondary modes of large amplitude can be traced back in their linear coupling with the primary modes.@xcite this can be rationalized from the existence in the energy expansion of the @xmath39 phase of invariant terms of the form @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the amplitude of the secondary mode @xmath81 and @xmath82 the amplitude of the primary mode @xmath48 .",
    "depending of the number of primary mode involved , these coupling terms can be bilinear ( pseudo - proper ) , tri - linear ( improper and hybrid - improper ) , quadri - linear , etc .",
    "to clarify the origin of secondary modes in several low symmetry phases of wo@xmath0 , we restrict ourself here to the search of such multi - linear invariant terms in the energy expansion around its cubic phase by using the invariants software.@xcite in the last column of table  [ tab : mode_decompo_invariants ] we report these linear invariants up to the fourth order obtained for the @xmath64 , @xmath11 , @xmath9 and @xmath1 phases .",
    "the letters represent the mode amplitudes ( @xmath83 ) in the directions specified in the third column where the bold letters refer to the primary modes in the structure ( @xmath82 ) and the normal letters to secondary modes ( @xmath84 ) .    in the @xmath64 phase , we find that the x@xmath52 mode appears through a trilinear coupling with the oxygen rotations modes r@xmath46 and m@xmath77 ( hybrid - improper coupling , * * ab**c invariant in table  [ tab : mode_decompo_invariants ] ) .",
    "this additional hybrid - improper x@xmath52 mode is also found in @xmath64 of @xmath66bo@xmath0 perovskites  @xcite where the eigenvector corresponds to anti - polar motions of the a cation . in wo@xmath0",
    "the a - cation is absent and x@xmath52 corresponds to similar anti - polar motions but of oxygen instead of the a - site ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : unstable - modes - vesta ] ) .    in @xmath11",
    "the primary m@xmath49mode condenses along z , the r@xmath46 mode along z and the m@xmath77 mode along y and four additional secondary modes : x@xmath47 and x@xmath52 with a large amplitude and m@xmath52 and m@xmath46 with a small amplitude as well as an additional component of the m@xmath49 mode about the x direction . if we restrict ourself to the strongest x@xmath47 and x@xmath52 modes we find that both are coupled with the r@xmath46 and m@xmath77 modes through a trilinear coupling ( hybrid - improper , * * ab**e and * * ab**f invariants in table  [ tab : mode_decompo_invariants ] ) but also through a quadrilinear coupling with the r@xmath46 mode and the two components of the m@xmath49 mode ( * * ad**ce and * * ad**cf invariants in table  [ tab : mode_decompo_invariants ] ) .",
    "we can thus explain the appearance of the x@xmath52 and x@xmath47 modes through a trilinear coupling with the oxygen octahedral rotations and the appearance of the second x component of the anti - polar m@xmath49mode through a coupling with the secondary x@xmath52 and x@xmath47 modes and the primary r@xmath46 mode .",
    "the final structure can thus be seen as anti - polar through the m@xmath49 mode along z with a canting of its direction toward the x axis and through the x@xmath47 mode along the y direction , the whole distortions being associated with the @xmath85 pattern of oxygen rotation distortions .",
    "the transition from @xmath11 to @xmath9 can be seen as being induced by the condensation of the r@xmath46 mode along the remaining direction for the oxygen rotation octahedral distortions to @xmath85 .",
    "this means that we find the same mode coupling as in the @xmath11 phase plus some extra ones due to the additional mode condensation . because we do not induce a new irrep , the couplings are the same ( i.e. trilinear and quadrilinear between the primary r@xmath46 , m@xmath77 and m@xmath49 modes and the secondary x@xmath47 and x@xmath52 modes ) but in different directions from the @xmath11 phase : we observe the x@xmath47 and x@xmath52 modes in two directions instead of one .",
    "other modes also appear in the symmetry adapted mode analysis but with smaller amplitudes ( m@xmath46 , m@xmath47 , m@xmath52 and m@xmath86 ) , which we do not include in the invariant analysis .",
    "@xmath10 and @xmath1 are very similar in the sense that for both structures we can envisage the condensation of r@xmath46 modes in three directions and the m@xmath49mode in one direction .",
    "the difference is that in the @xmath1 phase the r@xmath46 mode is primary with the same amplitude in two directions and a different amplitude in the third direction ( @xmath87where the m@xmath49mode is primary in the z direction ) while in the @xmath10 phase the condensation of the r@xmath46 mode has different amplitudes in three directions ( @xmath88 ) . in @xmath1",
    "the presence of the x@xmath47 and m@xmath47 secondary modes can be explained by trilinear coupling with the r@xmath46 and m@xmath49 primary modes ( * * ac**d+**bc**d and * * ab**e invariants in table  [ tab : mode_decompo_invariants ] ) in a similar way as in the @xmath9 phase .",
    "this analysis shows that the low symmetry phases of wo@xmath0 are complex and involve numerous multilinear couplings of modes if one expands the energy about the cubic phase .",
    "we note that , amongst possible couplings , the coupling with the secondary x@xmath47 mode is most important in all low symmetry phases .",
    "going further , in order to test whether symmetry arguments can lead to the the polar @xmath2 phase using improper - like couplings , we have tested if there exists a coupling with a polar mode at the @xmath40 point .",
    "we did not find any couplings with the r@xmath46 , m@xmath77 or m@xmath49 modes .",
    "we thus conclude that it is not possible to generate polarity in wo@xmath0 in the limit to these primary modes , which are the ones appearing in other experimental phases .",
