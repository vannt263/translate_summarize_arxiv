    "2004 ) offers a unique probe of the ionization history of the universe during cosmological reionization . as observations of lyman-@xmath0 absorption in the spectra of high redshift quasars ( djorgovski et al .",
    "2001 ; becker et al .  2001",
    "; fan et a.  2002 , 2003 ; white et al.2003 ; songaila 2004 ) unambiguously indicate that the universe was reionized shortly before @xmath5 ( gnedin 2002 ) , the observations of lyman-@xmath0 at @xmath6 directly probe the pre - reionization era .    specifically , since the damping wing of the gunn - peterson absorption ( gunn & peterson 1965 ) of the neutral igm will affect the lyman-@xmath0 emission line if the @xmath2 region around the emitting galaxy is not large enough ( miralda - escud 1998 ; haiman 2002 ) , the observations of high redshift lyman-@xmath0 emitters tell us something about the distribution and sizes of cosmological @xmath2 regions - although , to understand what specific constraints the observations place is a horrendously difficult task emitters are discovered because they are highly lensed by foreground clusters of galaxies , determining the observational selection function is extremely difficult . ] .",
    "however , the very fact of discovering a high - redshift lyman-@xmath0 emitter may potentially be used to constraint the ionization history of the universe .",
    "for example , pello et al .  (",
    "2004 ) report a tentative discovery of a @xmath7 galaxy .",
    "is it possible to see a lyman-@xmath0 emitting galaxy at such a high redshift ?",
    "loeb et al .  ( 2004 ) used this fact to put some preliminary constraints on the ionization state of the igm around that galaxy . while a real situation is likely to be more complicated because of the variety of reasons ( @xmath2 regions are typically highly asymmetric because i - fronts propagate much faster across underdense voids then across dense filaments ; bright galaxies are biased , so it is likely that more than one galaxy is located inside a single @xmath2 region ; lyman-@xmath0 emitters can also be located inside @xmath2 regions of luminous quasars , which are often many times larger than @xmath2 regions of galaxies , etc ) , it is interesting to investigate how likely it is to find a high redshift galaxy unaffected by the damping wing of the gunn - peterson absorption from the surrounding igm .",
    "in order to construct a model for the gunn - peterson absorption in the pre - reionization era , we use a numerical simulation of cosmological reionization similar to the one described in gnedin ( 2000 ) . the new simulation , however , incorporates a significantly more accurate method for following the time - dependent and spatially - inhomogeneous radiative transfer using the optically thin variable eddington tensor ( otvet ) approximation of gnedin & abel ( 2001 ) .",
    "the simulation assumes a flat cosmology with the values of cosmological parameters as measured by the _ wmap _ satellite ( spergel et al.2003 ) , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 . ] .",
    "the size of the simulation volume is @xmath12 in comoving units , and the comoving spatial resolution of the simulation is @xmath13 .",
    "the simulation included @xmath14 dark matter particles ( with mass of @xmath15 ) , an equal number of baryonic cells on a quasi - lagrangian moving mesh , and about 3 million stellar particles that formed continuously during the simulation .",
    "only popii stars are included in the simulation as sources of ionizing radiation .",
    "the simulation was adjusted to reproduce the observed evolution of the mean transmitted flux in the lyman-@xmath0 line between @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( white et al .",
    "2003 ; songaila 2004 ) .",
    "we , therefore , can be confident that the evolution of the igm is treated correctly in the simulation at least at @xmath18 .    given a simulation , we identify all star - forming galaxies using the denmax halo finding algorithm of bertschinger & gelb ( 1991 ) . for each galaxy",
    ", we generate 100 lines of sight that originate at the galaxy location and go along randomly chosen directions .",
    "we then generate an absorption spectrum along each line of sight following the standard procedure . for the computational efficiency , we use liu et al .",
    "( 2001 ) approximation for the voigt profile .",
    "figure [ figlr ] illustrates the distribution of the baryon number density and neutral hydrogen number density along 3 random lines of sight originating at the location of the most luminous galaxy at @xmath19 .",
    "the @xmath2 region around the central galaxies is easily visible .",
    "because the brightest galaxies are highly clustered , smaller galaxies and other dense structures are often located within the @xmath2 regions of brighter ones . for example , in the top panel , an overdensity of the order of 10 is located within the @xmath2 region of the central galaxy .",
    "this overdensity is the outer part of a smaller galaxy , and is , therefore , significantly more neutral than the rest of the @xmath2 region ( in fact , more neutral than simple ionization equilibrium would predict , due to shadowing and time - dependent ionization ) .",
    "this neutral spike is sufficient to produce large damping wing absorption at the location of the galaxy and make the lyman-@xmath0 of the central galaxy unobservable .",
    "two bottom panels , however , show different , `` clean '' lines of sight that are not obscured by neighbors and produce lower absorption by the damping wing of the neutral igm outside the @xmath2 region .",
    "this illustrates that the effect of the damping wing of the gunn - peterson absorption strongly depends on the direction of the line of sight : the same lyman-@xmath0 emitting galaxy may be observable or non - observable depending on the direction of viewing .",
    "a significant complication , however , for the evaluation of the strength of the lyman-@xmath0 emission line from the central galaxy is the galaxy itself .",
    "synthetic lyman-@xmath0 spectra from simulation are often treated as _ absorption _ spectra , when , in reality , they are _ scattering _ spectra . for gas along a line of sight",
    "well outside the source of emission this is an appropriate approximation , since scattering off the direction of viewing removes the photons that could be observed , and , thus , appears as effective absorption .",
    "this is not true for the source of emission , since photons that were originally emitted in directions different from the line of sight are scattered into the direction of viewing .",
    "thus , without the proper line radiative transfer treatment ( which is not included in our simulation ) , it is not possible to accurately predict shapes of the lyman-@xmath0 emission lines from simulated galaxies . leaving such treatment for future work , in this paper",
    "we are concerned only with an - order - of - magnitude estimate of the effect that damping wings of the neutral gas outside @xmath2 regions have on lyman-@xmath0 emission lines .    in order to obtain such an estimate , we adopt a following simple procedure .",
    "we assume that the lyman-@xmath0 emission line from a typical galaxy has a width of the order of @xmath20 .",
    "thus , we exclude all lyman-@xmath0 absorption within a specified velocity distance @xmath21 from the systemic velocity of a simulated galaxy ( because within this distance we should treat the lyman-@xmath0 as scattering and not as absorption ) . also , since the significant suppression of lyman-@xmath0 emission at the systemic velocity may still make the red wing of the emission line visible , we choose the lyman-@xmath0 optical depth at @xmath22 as a quantity that roughly characterizes the damping wing absorption of the lyman-@xmath0 emission line .",
    "typical lyman-@xmath0 emission lines have gaussian widths of the order of @xmath23 , so @xmath22 roughly corresponds to @xmath24 to the red of the line systemic velocity . in this paper",
    "we use a range of values for @xmath25 to estimate the sensitivity of our results to that somewhat arbitrary parameter .    with this approach",
    ", we can calculate the lyman-@xmath0 optical depth at @xmath22 for each of 100 lines of sight for each of the simulated galaxy .",
    "thus , there are 100 values of the damping wing absorption optical depth @xmath26 , or , equivalently , the flux decrement @xmath27 , for each galaxy .",
    "these 100 values are not all the same , of course , so we can use them to approximately characterize the probability that a given galaxy ( labeled by its star formation rate ) has a given value of the lyman-@xmath0 flux decrement .",
    "as a test of our approach , we show in figure [ figfs ] the values for the lyman-@xmath0 flux decrement above which 3% and 10% of all galaxies lie - for example , solid lines indicate that for 3% of all galaxies the decrease in flux at @xmath22 is not more than a factor of 10 .",
    "the two values for the parameter @xmath25 are used - the difference between black and gray lines roughly indicates the uncertainty of our estimate .",
    "an interesting feature of fig .",
    "[ figfs ] is the lack of dependence of the flux decrement on the star formation rate .",
    "naively , one would expect that galaxies with lower star formation rates create smaller @xmath2 regions around them , and , therefore , should exhibit higher suppression of their lyman-@xmath0 emission lines - clearly at odds with our result .",
    "however , this naive argument misses an important fact that high redshift galaxies are highly clustered , so it is likely for a faint galaxy to be located close to a bright galaxy , within the bright galaxy @xmath2 region . in order to test that this effect is responsible for the lack of dependence of the flux decrement on the star formation rate , we compute the flux decrement versus the star formation rate for the sub - sample of isolated galaxies .",
    "we define a galaxy to be isolated if it does not contain a galaxy with a higher star formation rate within a sphere of predefined radius @xmath28 . short - dashed and dotted lines in in fig .",
    "[ figfs ] show the flux decrement for the top 10% of all galaxies",
    "( an analog of the long - dashed line ) for sub - samples of isolated galaxies with @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( in physical units ) respectively .",
    "as one can see , isolated galaxies exhibit a strong dependence on the star formation rate for rates above about @xmath31 . at",
    "even lower star formation rates a different effect takes over : since the star formation in dwarf galaxies is highly episodic ( c.f .",
    "ricotti , gnedin , & shull 2003 ) , the instantaneous value of the star formation rate and the size of an @xmath2 region cease to correlate .",
    "the redshift dependence of the lyman-@xmath0 flux decrement is shown in figure [ figfz ] .",
    "as once can see , our estimates become highly uncertain at @xmath32 - at these redshifts full radiative transfer in lyman-@xmath0 line is required to make an accurate prediction for the effect of the damping wing on the profile of the lyman-@xmath0 emission line . at lower redshifts , however , our estimates are more precise .",
    "somewhat unexpectedly , even at as high a redshift as @xmath1 , one percent of all lyman-@xmath0 emitters should have their emission lines barely affected by the damping wing . at higher redshifts",
    "the damping wing quickly becomes more significant , but finding lyman-@xmath0 emitters at @xmath4 should still be possible , although they must be quite rare .",
    "the reason for this rapid transition is quite simple : as the universe expands , @xmath2 regions increase in size , so at each moment there exists a characteristic scale for the size distribution of @xmath2 regions ( say , a typical size of an @xmath2 region around an @xmath33 galaxy ) . at the same time , the damping wing of the gunn - peterson absorption introduces another spatial scale ( about @xmath34 or proper distance of @xmath35 at @xmath32 ; miralda - escid 1998 ) .",
    "thus , when typical @xmath2 regions around bright galaxies exceed this scale , a substantial fraction of all lyman-@xmath0 emitters becomes observable .",
    "it is important to emphasize here that our estimate is likely only a lower limit : because of the finite size of the computational box , we miss the brightest galaxies which create the largest @xmath2 regions ( although the size of the simulation box was selected so as to make this effect not significant at @xmath6 ) . in addition , our simulation does not include quasars , which can create @xmath2 regions several times that of galaxies .",
    "high redshift quasars are rare ( there should be only about 2 sloan quasars in the whole observable universe between redshifts 9 and 10 , fan et al .",
    "2001 ) , so that effect is most likely not large too , but without a detailed simulation we can not estimate it , so we treat our results as a lower limit .",
