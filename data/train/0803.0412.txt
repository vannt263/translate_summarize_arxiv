    "<S> two main factors constrain the evolution of information exchange and intelligent processing . </S>",
    "<S> first , information comes at a cost that can be higher than the corresponding evolutionary gain . </S>",
    "<S> many organisms therefore , avoid sustaining excessive sensing and decision making abilities by preferring , for example , stochastic ( non - responsive ) behavior in a fluctuating environment @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> it is however still unclear what allowed humans to overcome them with such an efficiency .    </S>",
    "<S> we address here the question : what are the necessary evolutionary selection conditions for the development of communication ( significant information exchange and processing ) between members of a population ? </S>",
    "<S> previous attempts to answer similar questions , can be roughly separated into two main categories : first , analysis of the emergence of various communicative behavior strategies , e.g. cooperation @xcite , fair signaling @xcite or acquisition of a common language @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> second , applying information theory to investigate how signals become associated with meaning @xcite . in this work </S>",

    "<S> how can one be sure that they communicate , in the sense that some information is transmitted , comprehended and utilized for choosing a specific behavior , e.g. cooperation or selfishness ? </S>",
    "<S> for instance , no communication is required for interactions where the competitors choose their behavior independently of each other . on the other hand , significant information exchange occurs in the course of correlated reactions between two interacting organisms , that are committed to a common role agreement @xcite , e.g. who is the donor and who is the recipient . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , correlations between observable behavior patterns can serve as a quantitative measure of information exchange , allowing to construct an ab initio model of communication with no a priori assumptions concerning specific mechanisms of information transfer and processing .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we demonstrate that a unique set of evolutionary conditions provides a solution both for a stable , maximal information exchange between individuals and for the naturally occurring diversity of communication abilities across populations . </S>",
    "<S> communication skills in populations are evaluated by presence of correlated , rather than independent , behavior patterns . </S>",
    "<S> correlated behavior is predicted to co - evolve with an ability to affect the competitor s behavior , creating populations with a mixture of evolutionary important correlated interactions of the indirect reciprocity type @xcite , and more frequent non - responsive behavior , lacking any evolutionary gain . </S>",

    "<S> exist numerous measures for information in language - like signals , including shannon entropy @xcite and kolmogorov complexity @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> the lower the number of pairwise interactions in this mode , the greater the weight for each competition : @xmath93 the interactions of a population with high affect abilities @xmath94 are composed , therefore , of a small amount @xmath95 of evolutionary important competitions with negatively correlated reactions and significant information exchange , together with more frequent non - responsive behavior lacking any evolutionary gain ( fig . </S>",

    "<S> the prediction that development of communication is accelerated with population size variations , is supported by evidence of significant demographic fluctuations during human evolution @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the long time required to develop multicellularity on earth ( about @xmath115 of the entire evolution time - span ) @xcite can be associated with the slow development of positively correlated synchronous behavior mode @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> negatively correlated reactions of the indirect reciprocity type @xmath59 lack selfish competitions @xmath116 and match , therefore , the observations of relatively low aggression levels in humans @xcite . from a single interaction s perspective , indirect reciprocity can be interpreted as altruistic . </S>",

    "<S> only general evolutionary conditions are derived that lead to correlated statistics of reactions , assuming that the mechanisms for the necessary information exchange and processing can be implemented in various ways and are species dependent .    to conclude , a mathematical framework based on observable , correlated behavior patterns was developed for analysis of evolution of information exchange in populations . </S>",
    "<S> it predicts that the communication abilities of populations are related to negatively correlated interactions ( such as donor vs. recipient ) and affective behavior . </S>",
    "<S> it was found that fluctuations in population size accelerate significantly the evolution of these abilities , allowing thus to explain the uniqueness of the human - line evolution . </S>",
    "<S> competitions similar to games of chicken and battle of the sexes lead to a faster evolution of communication . </S>",
