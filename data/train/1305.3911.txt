    "the cosmology based on an elegant idea that our universe was started to be expanded from a spacetime singularity , known as big bang cosmology .",
    "the discovery of the cosmic microwave background @xcite abandoned the idea of the steady state theory of the universe @xcite .",
    "moreover , the data observed in the ` supernova cosmology project ( scp ) ' @xcite and the ` high - z supernova search team ( hst ) ' @xcite show that presently the universe is not only expanding but also accelerating .",
    "both of the groups concluded that their results are sensitive to a linear combination of @xmath0 ( scp ) and @xmath1 ( hst ) , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 being respectively the cosmic matter and vacuum energy densities .",
    "the negative sign in the linear combination signifies that the matter and vacuum energy have opposite effects on the cosmological acceleration .",
    "a positive vacuum energy causes to accelerate the expansion , while the matter tends to slow it down .",
    "the high density vacuum energy eventually wins over the matter and makes the universe to be expanded with an acceleration .",
    "such vacuum energy , characterized by the negative pressure @xmath4 , is interpreted as dark energy , constituting @xmath5 percent of the content of the present universe @xcite .    during early age the universe",
    "was solely filled up with this vacuum energy .",
    "the scale factor @xmath6 grew exponentially so that the ratio of the vacuum energy density would rapidly be approaching towards the critical density at this era .",
    "such phenomenon of exponential expansion is called _ inflation_. it was guth who first proposed such inflationary model @xcite to fix up ` monopole problem ' .",
    "it was soon observed that the inflation could solve other long - standing problems , such as ` flatness problem ' and ` horizon problem ' also .",
    "guth proposed that the scalar fields might get caught in the local minimum of some potential , and then rolled towards a true minimum of the potential .",
    "kazanas suggested @xcite that an exponential expansion could eliminate the particle horizon .",
    "according to sato @xcite exponential expansion would be able to eliminate domain walls , another kind of exotic relic .",
    "einhorn and sato @xcite argued that their model could solve ` magnetic monopole puzzle ' .",
    "it was then realized that guth s model of inflation had fatal problem as the transition from super cooled initial ` false vacuum ' @xcite to the lower energy ` true vacuum ' can not occur everywhere simultaneously @xcite .",
    "the guth version of inflation theory was then necessarily replaced by a new type ` slow roll inflation ' theory @xcite . a scalar field ,",
    "called ` inflaton ' was introduced to explain such phenomenon .",
    "coleman and weinberg @xcite introduced the symmetry breaking mechanism to the new inflation model . in the inflation theory linde @xcite added a new dimension by introducing the ` chaotic inflation ' in which initially one or more inflaton fields vary in a random manner with positions .",
    "linde @xcite also proposed the theory of ` hybrid inflation ' theories by introducing more than one scalar fields .",
    "in cosmology essentially inflation is nothing but a rapid exponential expansion of the early universe by a factor of at least @xmath7 in volume , driven by negative pressure .",
    "the detailed particle physics mechanism behind such phenomenon is still unknown to the researchers .",
    "it is also a super cooled expansion , when the temperature drops down from @xmath8 k to @xmath9 k , although exact drop of temperature is model dependent .",
    "such relatively low temperature is maintained throughout the entire inflationary phase and at the end of inflation the reheating occurs to attain the pre - inflationary temperature .    in the present article",
    "our motivation is to propose a new kind of inflation model based on the scalar potential with decreasing kinetic energy .",
    "the energy density is assumed to consist of a large constant part along with a small slowly varying part , termed as vacuum energy density .",
    "the constant part would generate an exponential expansion , whereas the variable part of the energy density participate in the dynamics of inflation . in a nutshell , therefore , we are strongly motivated by the idea that during inflationary age the expansion is approximately exponential in nature .",
    "we consider a scalar field @xmath10 , known as the inflaton , along with a potential @xmath11 to take part to vary the vacuum energy . at this stage of expansion the universe",
    "is assumed to be filled up with such vacuum energy .",
    "the expression of the vacuum energy density as well as vacuum pressure in presence of a spatially homogeneous inflaton @xmath10 in the robertson - walker spacetime becomes @xcite    @xmath12    which must be derived from the expression of the generalized energy - momentum tensor    @xmath13 + g^{\\mu\\rho}g^{\\nu\\sigma}\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial x^{\\rho}}\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial x^{\\sigma}}.\\ ] ]    such energy - momentum tensor is slightly different from that of the constant vacuum energy @xmath14 , which is proportional to the @xmath15 in the general coordinate system according to the lorentz invariance condition .",
    "the proportionality of @xmath14 to @xmath15 corresponds to the condition of negative pressure as @xmath16 , but by the introduction of inflaton such condition is deviated as neither pressure nor density remains constant .",
    "now the important issue is what should be the expression of @xmath11 .",
    "let us , as a check , consider the expression of potential in the following form :    @xmath17    it looks like the potential of the massive scalar field along with a constant term @xmath18 , which should be much larger than the term @xmath19 .",
    "the idea behind to introduce such potential is that it should be analogous to the vacuum energy density if there is no inflaton field at all .",
    "now , let us recall the friedman equation in presence of inflaton , which yields following two equations :    @xmath20    @xmath21 - 1=\\frac{k}{a^{2}h^{2}}.\\ ] ]    here @xmath22 represents the hubble parameter and @xmath23 is the mass of inflaton field .",
    "it is already mentioned that we are strongly motivated by the idea that during inflationary age the expansion is approximately exponential in nature .",
    "the presence of inflaton makes the universe to expand very fast , nearly exponentially .",
    "therefore , one may assume that the @xmath10 field is inversely proportional to the scale factor @xmath24 .",
    "such proportionality relation may be expressed as @xmath25 where @xmath26 stands for the ratio of the mass of the inflaton to the planck mass .",
    "the above relation implies that the expansion of the universe yields the decay of inflaton field in the same rate , although it is restricted in the inflationary era .",
    "now , using the proportionality relation given by the above equation the hubble parameter can be calculated from the eq .",
    "( 5 ) as @xmath27^{\\frac{1}{2}},\\ ] ] where @xmath28    if @xmath29 the hubble parameter can be approximated as @xmath30    let us now try to solve eq . ( 4 ) with the aid of eq . ( 9 ) .",
    "neglecting the second degree term of @xmath31 one can solve the equation to obtain the expression of inflaton as    @xmath32.\\ ] ]    we would like to obtain the analytical expression of the scale factor to realize the nature of the expansion in the inflationary age . by means of eqs .",
    "( 6 ) , ( 7 ) and ( 8) such expression can be calculated as    @xmath33    where @xmath34 is the initial value of @xmath24 , i.e. , the value of scale factor at the beginning of inflationary era .",
    "the value of @xmath24 , smaller than @xmath34 , corresponds to the quantum age . if @xmath35 the equation ( 11 ) gives    @xmath36    showing the approximate nature of exponential expansion .    to have a simplified and approximate expression of @xmath10 one",
    "can exploit the proportionality relation given by eq .",
    "( 6 ) as well as approximate expression of @xmath24 in eq .",
    "( 12 ) and find that the @xmath10 is approximately proportional to @xmath37 .",
    "this is possible if in the eq .",
    "( 10 ) it is assumed @xmath38 and @xmath39 ( where , @xmath40 is value of @xmath10 at the beginning of inflation phase ) or vise - versa .",
    "in addition to that the following relation is to be satisfied .",
    "@xmath41    this is an important relation showing that @xmath23 is neither imaginary nor zero because of the expression of @xmath42 being positive real quantity .",
    "again , according to the eq .",
    "( 6 ) the @xmath43 is proportional to @xmath44 , and therefore , the model proposed here is restricted only for the closed type of universe .",
    "it is also to be noted that the eq .",
    "( 6 ) shows a relatin between spacetime geometry and inflaton field , which readily solves the flatness problem and yields an approximate exponential expansion . the flatness condition @xmath45 @xcite gives an estimate of @xmath10 . utilizing this flatness condition and also the condition given by the eq .",
    "( 10 ) one can estimate @xmath46 where @xmath47 represents the planck mass .",
    "in this model we must keep provision for the universe to get out of the inflationary era and to begin the radiation dominated regime .",
    "the mathematical framework is to be handled so delicately that the inflation could end up .",
    "the total density @xmath48 of the universe may be expressed as @xmath49 where @xmath50 from the energy equation of the cosmology given by @xmath51 with @xmath52 it can easily be obtained @xmath53 , if the density varies as @xmath54 . if the density would comprise of only constant vacuum density @xmath18 , then @xmath55 . in the eq .",
    "( 14 ) @xmath56 is the varying density , whereas @xmath18 is the constant vacuum density .",
    "now one can treat such varying density as a state and the pressure - density relation may be realized as @xmath57 where @xmath58 is an operator which brings different phases of the universe and @xmath59 is the corresponding eigen value . in the inflationary phase of the universe the eigen value @xmath60 .",
    "now the operator @xmath58 operating on @xmath56 brings a change so that the eigen value @xmath59 becomes @xmath61 , leading to the end of inflation .",
    "it can be calculated that when @xmath62 the density @xmath56 is proportional to @xmath63 and thus the radiation age begins . at the radiation phase",
    "the varying density energy becomes @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 represent the radiation density and the scale factor , respectively , at the moment when inflation ends and radiation era begins .",
    "such radiation density @xmath65 can be estimated as @xmath67    now a question may arise what will be the nature of @xmath10 and @xmath31 at the end of inflation .",
    "relative to the time scale of inflationary age both of @xmath10 and @xmath31 vanish asymptotically and thus the potential @xmath68 reaches to a true vacuum .",
    "but in the global scale of time period @xmath10 should have a minimum value beyond which no inflaton field exists and the inflation era gradually exits to the radiation age .",
    "such minimum @xmath10 is given by @xmath69    this model does not deal with the dynamics of the universe in the radiation age .",
    "it only addresses the issue of possible deadlock at the end of inflation .",
    "the number of e - foldings can be calculated as @xmath70,\\ ] ]    where @xmath71 is the total time period for which the inflation lasts .",
    "thus it can be predicted for a large period that the number of e - foldings are directly proportional to the time period through which the inflation elapses . to have a large number of e - foldings",
    "therefore the time period of the inflationary phase is to be large enough .",
    "the minimum amount of inflation required to solve the various cosmological problems is about 70 e - foldings , i.e. an expansion by a factor of @xmath72 .",
    "the total number of e - foldings inflation described by this model will exceed the number depending on the period of inflation as well as mass of the inflaton field .",
    "to this end , let us critically discuss how the present model is advantageous compared to the earlier models .",
    "it has already been mentioned that the guth s model of inflation @xcite had problem that the transition from the ` false vacuum ' @xcite to the ` true vacuum ' does not occur everywhere at a time .",
    "linde s version could able to get rid of such drawback and well explain ` flatness ' and ` horizon ' problem .",
    "like the linde s model @xcite our model proposed an approximate nature of such exponential burst .    in the framework of the proposed model an important relation is deduced in eq .",
    "the left hand side of the said equation contains the terms representing the dynamics of the expansion , whereas the right hand side stands for the space - time geometry .",
    "followed by eq .",
    "( 13 ) it is quite evident that @xmath43 is not only non - zero but it is also a positive , interpreting the orientation of the universe is closed . in the equation ( 5 )",
    "the term @xmath43 is cancelled out ; which indicates that the expansion of the universe is independent of the orientation of the space . in the closed universe",
    "the massive inflaton field makes the universe flat in that stage .",
    "thus the presence of inflaton field not only fix the ` flatness problem ' , but it may also be interpreted that the origin of the inflaton is solely responsible for the orientation of space .",
    "to summarize , the basic philosophy behind the present paper is to explain the exact nature of exponential expansion in general .",
    "however , specifically the investigation provides the following novel features :    \\(i ) the model shows that in the inflationary era hubble constant , an approximate constant , evolves out of the inflaton mass .",
    "\\(ii ) the model keeps room for the end of inflation to avoid the possible deadlock .",
    "\\(iii ) it can also be predicted that for a large time period the number of e - foldings are directly proportional to the time period through which the inflation elapses . in other words to have a large number of e - folding the time period of the inflationary phase is to be large enough .",
    "it has already been shown that the proposed model can explain the flatness as well as the horizon problems .",
    "however , there is a great issue of monopole .",
    "it seems that at this stage monopole problem can not be tackled by the model as it is fixed through the process of reheating after the inflationary phase .",
    "this is therefore beyond purview of the present work .",
    "sr is due to support from the inter - university centre for astronomy and astrophysics , pune , india under which a part of this work was carried out ."
