    "null geodesics from an event at @xmath288 would focus exactly at @xmath289    because of the extreme distortion of the light cone by the plane wave , every spacelike hypersurface in this spacetime intersects at least one null geodesic more than once .",
    "a global cauchy surface can not be defined , but for local calculations one can define a partial cauchy surface and compute field theory bogolyubov coefficients .",
    "gibbons @xcite showed that although the quantum theory of a scalar field in a single plane wave background is easily calculable and yields no particle creation , the theory itself becomes singular at the focal plane where the cauchy horizon can no longer be neglected .",
    "plane gravitational waves are interesting string backgrounds to explore because the metric fields provide exact conformally invariant couplings on the string world sheet .",
    "this is because all the higher - derivative terms that could add ( worldsheet ) quantum corrections vanish identically.@xcite string propagation through gravity waves has been fruitfully explored in the past in the context of scattering amplitudes .",
    "a notion of  stringy singularity \" based on infinite string excitation was examined by horowitz and steif @xcite , sanchez and de vega @xcite and others .",
    "while this looks like a good operational definition of singular string propagation , it does nt shed light on the nature of causal volume delimitation in string theory and the potential physically - relevant pathologies that could occur when causal volumes are delimited by solutions to worldsheet rather than wordline mathematics .",
    "for this reason , we step back to that earlier work and re - examine it from a geodesic rather than an s - matrix point of view .",
    "in extending the geodesic picture to string theory , the test particle geodesics that define the boundary of the test particle light cone are represented by the zero mode of the string .",
    "this is the center - of - mass coordinate that obeys that standard geodesic equation .",
    "if we only look at the geodesics of test string zero modes , then the singularities and causal pathologies of general relativity remain with minor modifications ( in the cases where we trust the background spacetime approximation , at least . )",
    "this is basically telling us that test particles propagate in  stringy general relativity \" rather similarly to how they propagate in ordinary general relativity .",
    "the biggest difference comes from the rescaling of the stringy affine parameter relative to the test particle affine parameter by @xmath290 this has a noticeable effect mainly in the case of a dilaton black hole with purely electric charge .",
    "@xcite    if we take all string modes into account , the counterpart to a geodesic equation in string theory becomes @xmath291    in the single plane wave metric ( [ bert ] ) the equations reduce to    @xmath292    the mass shell constraints come from the vanishing of the worldsheet stress tensor and automatically satisfy the first equation above .",
    "if we choose the gauge @xmath293 we get    @xmath294    and the remaining second order equation reduces to    @xmath295    these equations do nt allow the rescaling of string proper affine parameter , so if we further fix the gauge by @xmath296 and try to rescale @xmath297 out of the equations through @xmath298 factors of @xmath297 end up in the @xmath299 terms . setting @xmath300 and expanding in open string modes using @xmath301",
    "we get    @xmath302    with @xmath303 obtainable by straightforward integration of ( [ constraint ] ) .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , string null trajectories are momentum - dependent and hence fail to satisfy the principle of equivalence observed in particle geodesics .",
    "so causal boundaries as determined by propagating strings become momentum - dependent .",
    "assigning @xmath304 and @xmath305 it is convenient to expand in the basis :    @xmath306    with @xmath307 and the @xmath308 obtained by integrating ( [ constraint ] ) .",
    "this is related to the more common expansion for strings in flat spacetime    @xmath309    through    @xmath310    applying continuity equations across the waves boundaries at @xmath281 and @xmath311 gives the linear transformation between incoming and outgoing mode constants @xmath312 and @xmath313 :    @xmath314    transforming back to the basis @xmath315 by undoing ( [ basis ] ) , the bogolyubov coefficients @xmath316 obtained match those obtained for @xmath38 in @xcite , which according to the conventions used here is    @xmath317    it is significant that this coefficient is zero in scalar quantum field theory @xcite .",
    "as gibbons explained , there is no mixing between in and out bases in that case because there is a global null killing vector guaranteeing that frequencies can be measured in the same way before and after the wave s passage .",
    "strings are excited because they have extended structure .",
    "string in and out bases are getting mixed in outright defiance of this target space killing vector that has such a powerful restrictive effect on quantum fields .",
    "the limit @xmath318 leads to a wave profile @xmath319 which in @xcite and @xcite was shown for bosonic strings to satisfy the definition of a singularity in terms of string propagation because the mass operator for the  out \" state in the  in \" vacuum diverges like @xmath320 .    for the single wave under consideration @xmath321 the axion - dilaton colliding wave metric requires @xmath322 so the limit in which one or both incoming waves has the profile @xmath323 is also the limit in which the maximal analytic extension of the collision region gives an extreme dilaton black hole with zero entropy but infinite curvature at the horizon and @xmath3 of the @xmath4 supersymmetry unbroken .",
    "@xcite    string motion through the wave represented by ( [ bert ] ) looks the same globally as the particle motion when plotted at the same scale as in figure @xmath324 the main difference becomes visible in the focusing region when the momentum is varied , as shown below :    0.25 cm    = 6.5 in     the surface swept out by @xmath325 plotted for : @xmath326 and @xmath327 0.25 cm    the plot above shows that the focal region as determined by strings becomes smeared by strings as the momentum decreases .",
    "this does not mean that string trajectories are no longer leaving the boundary of the causal future after they cross .",
    "this still has to be true at large distances .",
    "string effects obscure the location of the focal plane but not the effects of geodesic focusing itself .",
    "the geodesic focusing that determines the location of the focal plane of the extreme single plane wave in ( [ bert ] ) was shown in equation ( [ theta ] ) to control the focusing of the killing - cauchy horizon in the collision region as @xmath328 the killing - cauchy horizon for axion - dilaton colliding plane wave system is mapped to @xmath329 in the axion - dilaton black hole via the coordinate transformation ( [ ctrans ] ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath330 is locally identified with @xmath331 this demonstrates a relationship between infinite geodesic focusing in the colliding wave system and the infinite red shift in the black hole system .",
    "consider the  stringy stretched horizon \" as elucidated in @xcite .",
    "an observer accelerating at constant @xmath52 ( a fido ) near a black hole event horizon sees a passing freely falling string with a time resolution that decreases like @xmath332 with @xmath333 but we know that a measurement of the size of a string cut off at mode n grows like @xmath334 @xmath335 strings fill more space as we try to measure them with greater time resolution . since the resolution @xmath336 , the fido would see the passing string begin to grow like @xmath337 until it filled the horizon area . in @xcite the authors fixed @xmath338 and looked at @xmath339 in the plots in figure @xmath340 we fixed @xmath341 and varied @xmath297 instead , finding that as we try to look at the string with decreasing resolution @xmath342 the string gets longer and fills more space .",
    "the killing - cauchy horizon formed by axion - dilaton colliding plane waves maps to a _",
    "past _ horizon of an axion - dilaton black hole .",
    "( see figure @xmath343 ) so the  stringy stretched focal plane \" can be viewed as the time - reversed version of the  stringy stretched horizon \" described in @xcite . in other words , suppose we are in the maximally extended colliding plane wave spacetime described in section v , where two waves in a cylindrical universe collide to produce the axion - dilaton black hole spacetime in figure @xmath344 at @xmath345 a fido close to @xmath156 in region i would see a test string emerging from the collision region at @xmath346 filling the past horizon of the white hole created by the collision and then shrinking rapidly .",
    "this is the time - reversed version of what the fido at the future horizon sees .",
    "it is important to remember , however , that these nonsingular colliding plane wave metrics are unstable . the singular term in the curvature ( [ kasnerc ] ) only vanishes when the product @xmath347 is precisely zero everywhere , which only happens if the initial data is specified with an arbitrarily high precision .",
    "it was shown by yurtsever @xcite that two finite - sized gravity waves that are  nearly plane symmetric \" over some transverse size @xmath348 will collapse through plane - symmetric processes if the average focal length @xmath349 of the incoming waves satisfies @xmath350 there is a causality - based argument for this : the proper time in the collision region for the singularity or cauchy horizon to form is @xmath351",
    "so if @xmath352 the asymptotic evolution becomes dominated by @xmath353 plane wave dynamics before gravitational shock waves containing the information that the incoming waves are @xmath354 in extent could have time to reach the collision region .",
    "the mass - energy density contained in each incoming wave of thickness @xmath355 and average curvature @xmath356 would be on the order of @xmath357 the focal length @xmath358 which gives @xmath359 ( so the mass - energy per unit area in a finite , nearly - plane symmetric gravity wave is @xmath360 ) the total mass - energy in the collision region then would be @xmath361 so the condition @xmath362 implies @xmath363 in other words , the mass - energy in the colliding wave system is contained well within its schwarzschild radius when the two waves meet and the final product of this collision ought to be a black hole of size @xmath364    in the case of axion - dilaton colliding waves , these spacetimes are in general nonsingular and hence are believed to be unstable , in that small plane - symmetric perturbations on the initial data propagate to cause the killing - cauchy horizon to become singular .",
    "however , @xmath365 for the incoming waves , @xmath366 therefore @xmath367 and the limit @xmath368 is also the limit @xmath369 the condition @xmath362 implies @xmath370 this suggests that the collision of these finite waves could nucleate not one , but several axion - dilaton black holes , and in the maximally supersymmetric limit of @xmath371 the result could be an explosion of extreme dilaton black holes , which are nt really black holes because the event horizon is singular . for that to happen",
    "at least one of the incoming waves would have zero thickness and infinite curvature .",
    "such an incoming wave is already singular if we use the operative definition of a singular wave in string theory as a background in which the bogolyubov coefficient for string excitation becomes infinite .",
    "the local coordinate transformation between the trapped region of a schwarzschild black hole and a colliding plane gravitational wave discovered by ferrari and ibaez @xcite extends naturally to the class of axion - dilaton black holes that are classical solutions to the electric - magnetic duality - invariant action ( [ action ] )    @xmath372    the local coordinate transformation ( [ ctrans ] )    @xmath373    transforms an axion - dilaton black hole metric characterized by mass @xmath374 and complex axion - dilaton charge @xmath375 to the collision region of a colliding axion - dilation plane wave metric ( [ adcwmetric ] )    @xmath376    the constants @xmath81 and @xmath82 represent the focal lengths of the incoming waves obtained from above through the khan - penrose prescription @xcite and satisfy the relation @xmath377 this metric has a killing - cauchy horizon at @xmath378 where the spatial translation killing vector @xmath379 becomes null .",
    "the curvature at the killing - cauchy horizon is equal to the curvature at @xmath190 of the correspoonding axion - dilaton black hole and so is finite except in the schwarzschild and extreme electrically or magnetically charged dilaton limits where the curvature at @xmath157 diverges .",
    "the limit @xmath54 which for the black hole metrics corresponds to an extreme black hole , takes the axion - dilaton colliding plane wave metric to the bertotti - robinson metric ( [ bert ] )    @xmath380    which has a finite average focal length @xmath120 despite fact that the trapped region of the corresponding black hole has become infinitesimal .",
    "the product @xmath381 of the non - vanishing parameters describing the colliding waves is related to the entropy of a nonsingular extreme black hole with @xmath50 unbroken @xmath4 supersymmetry through    @xmath382    an incoming wave obtained from the bertotti - robinson collision region can be described in harmonic coordinates as a shock wave of thickness @xmath383 where @xmath81 is the focal length of that wave , and constant curvature of magnitude @xmath117 if we send @xmath384 while keeping the other incoming focal length @xmath82 finite , then the constraint @xmath120 says that @xmath86 the limit @xmath384 corresponds to a delta function incoming wave .",
    "the black hole corresponding to the @xmath385 limit has a singular horizon , zero entropy and @xmath3 of @xmath4 supersymmetry unbroken .",
    "this correspondence between an delta - function gravity wave and this extreme dilaton configuration with zero entropy is like a type of wave - particle duality in string theory , albeit not the usual one .",
    "the maximal analytic extension of the metric ( [ adcwmetric ] ) across the killing - cauchy horizon gives back the non - trapped regions of the corresponding axion - dilaton hole , but requires that the @xmath11 coordinate live on a circle of radius @xmath386 the resulting spacetime has two plane - symmetric single waves propagating in a cylindrical universe that collide and form a past horizon of an axion - dilaton black hole , shown in figure 4 .",
    "the propagation of test particle and test strings in a plane gravitational wave were compared .",
    "geodesic focusing for the axion - dilaton colliding wave system is controlled by the supersymmetric bertotti - robinson limit .",
    "the single plane waves obtained from this collision region metric therefore make good toy backgrounds to study stringy geodesic focusing .",
    "the string equivalent of a massless geodesic equation does not allow for rescaling the affine parameter ; consequently light cones as delimited by strings depend on momentum .",
