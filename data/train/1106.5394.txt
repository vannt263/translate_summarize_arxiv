    "in building high - fidelity quantum channels over long distances , qubits encoded in propagating photons play a unique role , since they provide the only way to transmit quantum information over kilometer distances  @xcite .",
    "however , also on a smaller scale rapid progress is made in the design of nano - fabricated photonic circuits for classical and quantum applications @xcite and compared to electric circuits @xcite or diverse qubit shuttling techniques @xcite , such photonic circuits could provide a fast and robust alternative for on - chip distribution of entanglement .",
    "therefore , the development of coherent interfaces between stationary and so - called ` flying ' photonic qubits is one of the essential steps in realizing quantum networks and is commonly included in the list of key criteria for general purpose quantum information processing platforms @xcite .",
    "the fundamental operation to be carried out in a quantum network is the transfer of an arbitrary quantum state @xmath0 between two nodes according to @xmath1 , which together with local operations allows the generation of inter - node entanglement .",

    ", the challenge is now to identify a suitable interconnection with optical quantum channels also for this larger class of qubits .",
    "this is , however , often hindered by lack of coherent optical transitions or the incompatibility with light .",
    "early suggestions to overcome this problem have been made in the context of hybrid systems , where , e.g. , superconducting devices are coupled to close - by atomic @xcite , molecular @xcite or spin systems @xcite .",
    "an optical interface could then in principle be realized by using , for example , the atoms as a mediator .",

    "setting , these resonators can coherently interact with light @xcite and their control near the single - quantum level has been demonstrated @xcite . on the other hand , they can also interact with solid - state qubits via magnetic @xcite or electric fields @xcite , and these abilities make them natural candidates for mediating indirect qubit - photon interactions , thereby realizing the desired qubit - light interface .    in a recent work @xcite we proposed the use of such optomechanical transducers ( omts ) for the implementation of optical communication protocols between two solid - state qubits , while related ideas have also been discussed in the context of traveling - wave phonon to photon converters @xcite .",

    "the resonator in turn interacts with the field of an optical cavity mode via radiation pressure or optical gradient forces as is currently experimentally explored with various different optomechanical ( om ) settings @xcite . as a result ,",
    "this configuration induces effective interactions between the qubit and photons which do not rely on the optical properties of the qubit system .",
    "therefore , this approach in principle enables quantum communication applications for a large range of solid - state qubits .",

    "@xcite . here",
    ", we present a detailed analysis of the effective qubit - fiber interactions and derive a cascaded master equation which describes the effective multiqubit dynamics in such a network . in particular , we describe the implementation of tunable qubit - fiber couplings for quantum state transfer protocols and discuss the role of thermal noise and stokes - scattering processes .",
    "these are the two main noise sources which are typically absent in analogous atomic settings . in the second part of the paper",
    "we then investigate the case of a single mode optical quantum channel relevant for optical on - chip communication schemes . in this setting ,",
    "the qubits are effectively connected by a finite number of mechanical and optical modes and we analyze the performance of entangling operations mediated by this type of network .",
    "the remainder of this paper is structured as follows : in section [ sec : singlenode ] we present a detailed description of a single omt as depicted in fig.[fig : overview](b ) and discuss the resulting effective qubit - fiber interaction together with the relevant noise processes in this system . in sec.[sec : longdistance ] we extend the model to an arbitrary number of nodes and derive a cascaded master equation for this multiqubit network .",
    "further , we give a protocol for state - transfer between two nodes and assess its performance . in sec.[sec : onchip ] we then study an on - chip setting where the individual nodes are coupled by optical resonators with a discrete spectrum and analyze the prospects for performing entangling gates between the qubits .",
    "finally , we discuss potential experimental realizations of the proposed omt in sec.[sec : realizations ] and close with concluding remarks in sec.[sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the aim of this work is to develop a theoretical model for the description of optical quantum networks where the interconversion between stationary and photonic qubits is realized by an omt at each node . as a first step we will investigate in this section the dynamics of a single node of such a network and derive a simplified model for the effective qubit - light interactions mediated by the om device .",
    "we consider a single node of an optical network as schematically shown in  fig.[fig : overview](b ) , where the coupling between a qubit and an optical fiber is mediated by an omt .",
    "the total hamiltonian for this system is @xmath3 where @xmath4 describes the coherent dynamics of the qubit and the om device , @xmath5 the free evolution of the optical fiber modes , and @xmath6 the coupling between cavity and fiber .",
    "the last term in eq .",
    ", @xmath7 , summarizes all additional interactions with the environment leading to decoherence as specified below .    for a general discussion",
    "we assume complete local control over the qubit , which is taken to be encoded in two states @xmath8 and @xmath9 of an isolated quantum system , and which interacts with the quantized motion of a mechanical resonator , e.g. , via magnetic field gradients  @xcite or electrostatic interactions @xcite . the mechanical resonator in turn",
    "is coupled to the field of an optical cavity mode via radiation pressure or optical gradient forces . in terms of the usual pauli operators @xmath10 and @xmath11 for the qubit , and the bosonic operator @xmath12 for the mechanical mode , the hamiltonian @xmath4 can be written in the form ( @xmath13 ) @xmath14 here , @xmath15 is the qubit s energy splitting , @xmath16 the strength of the qubit - resonator coupling and @xmath17 is the hamiltonian for the coupled om system .",
    "we point out that depending on the physical implementation , the jaynes - cummings type interaction assumed in eq",
    ". may emerge only as an effective description of an underlying driven two- or multilevel system . in this case",
    ", also @xmath15 is an effective parameter which can differ from the bare frequency scales in the system .",
    "( this will be discussed in more detail in sec.[sec : realizations ] where we consider the implementation of the hamiltonian for the specific examples of spin and charge qubits . )",
    "the om system consisting of a mechanical resonator coupled to a single optical cavity mode is described by the hamiltonian @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the mechanical vibration frequency and @xmath20 is the bosonic annihilation operator for the optical mode of frequency @xmath21 .",
    "the quantity @xmath22 is the single photon om coupling and corresponds to the optical frequency shift per zero point motion @xmath23 . in the last line of eq .",
    "we have included an additional external laser field of frequency @xmath24 , which coherently excites the cavity field . as detailed below",
    ", this driving field will allow us to enhance and also to control the om coupling by adjusting the slowly varying driving strength @xmath25 .",
    "we finally stress that the optical cavity might support additional degenerate modes which we ignored in writing eq .. as will be discussed below , this is valid as long as the om interaction does not cause scattering between the degenerate modes .",
    "the optical cavity of the om system is coupled to the modes of an optical fiber , which in the multinode setting considered below will serve as our quantum communication channel .",
    "the fiber supports many continua of modes described by bosonic operators @xmath26 , normalized to @xmath27=\\delta_{\\sigma,\\sigma'}\\delta(\\omega-\\omega')$ ] , where @xmath28 labels , e.g. , propagation direction or polarization .",
    "the free fiber hamiltonian is then simply given by @xmath29 .",
    "we assume that the om system is located at position @xmath30 along the fiber to which it is coupled according to @xmath31 where the coupling constants @xmath32 are defined in this way for later convenience . for definiteness , we consider the case where the cavity mode is side - coupled to a fiber with left- and right - moving modes of a single relevant polarization ( @xmath33 ) . in this case , the cavity - fiber coupling is naively estimated to be proportional to the overlap integral @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the mode function of the evanescent cavity field over the relevant interaction region of length @xmath36 ( see , e.g. , refs.@xcite for a detailed analysis of the coupling to a whispering - gallery mode cavity ) . for @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the vacuum cavity wavelength , we can roughly distinguish between two cases . for a standing - wave cavity mode @xmath39 and photons from the cavity will be emitted into both directions ( @xmath40 ) , while for a running - wave mode such as @xmath41 , a preferred emission into a specific direction can be achieved ( in this case @xmath42 ) .",
    "although in principle both configurations could be relevant for different quantum communication applications , we will for concreteness focus in the following on the case where @xmath20 describes a circulating running - wave cavity mode that couples to the fiber according to @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the right - propagating fiber - field .",
    "the coupling of the cavity to this continuum of modes will lead to an irreversible decay of the cavity field at the rate @xmath45 .",
    "to proceed , we eliminate the time - dependence in eq . by transforming all photonic operators to a frame rotating at the laser frequency .",
    "this amounts to replacing @xmath17 by @xmath46 and @xmath5 by @xmath47 , where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the detunings of the cavity and fiber modes from the laser frequency , respectively .",
    "we then use a standard born - markov approximation to eliminate the fiber modes @xcite and describe the resulting dissipative dynamics in terms of a quantum langevin equation ( qle ) for the cavity field , @xmath50 - \\kappa c   - \\sqrt{2\\kappa_f } f_{\\rm in}(t ) - \\sqrt{2\\kappa_0 } f_{0}(t ) \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , we have introduced a total decay rate @xmath51 , where @xmath52 accounts for additional intrinsic losses of the optical cavity mode and @xmath53 is the associated noise operator .",
    "we have further defined operators @xmath54 and @xmath55 which obey the input - output relation @xmath56 and we specify vacuum white noise statistics for the fiber input , i.e. , @xmath57=\\delta(t - t^\\prime)$ ] and @xmath58 , as well as for @xmath53 .",
    "in addition , the mechanical resonance generally has a finite intrinsic width and is connected via its support to a thermal bath of temperature @xmath59 .",
    "this is commonly modeled by the qle @xmath60 - \\frac{\\gamma_m}{2}b -\\sqrt{\\gamma_m}\\xi(t)\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath61 is the decay rate of the mechanical amplitude .",
    "in contrast to the optical fields , the mechanical noise is characterized by a thermal white noise operator @xmath62 with statistics @xmath63 and @xmath64=\\delta(t - t^\\prime)$ ] . here , @xmath65 is given by the bose occupation number for a mode of frequency @xmath19 . in the high - temperature case ,",
    "where @xmath66 and hence @xmath67 , the relevant thermal decoherence rate will turn out to be @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the quality factor of the mechanical resonance and typically @xmath70 .",
    "below , we will often take the limit @xmath71 and whenever doing so it is understood that we keep the decoherence rate @xmath72 constant .      in typical experiments",
    "the om coupling @xmath73 is too small to allow coherent interactions between the mechanical system and individual cavity photons .",
    "therefore , to achieve an appreciable and also tunable coupling we consider the case of a strongly driven om system where the effective coupling between mechanics and light is amplified by the coherent field amplitude inside the cavity .    starting from the qles ,",
    ", we perform a unitary transformation @xmath74 and @xmath75 such that the c - numbers @xmath76 , @xmath77 describe the classical mean values of the modes and the new operators @xmath20 and @xmath12 represent quantum fluctuations around them .",
    "we require any classical ( that is c - number ) contributions to the transformed qles to vanish , which yields the following system for the classical response :    [ eq : classicalresponse ] @xmath78    for @xmath79 and @xmath80 the steady state solution is @xmath81 with @xmath76 determined from @xmath82 this relation is still approximately valid if @xmath83 is slowly varying compared to the characteristic response time .",
    "this means , e.g. , @xmath84 for the case @xmath85 which is of relevance below . within these limits ,",
    "a desired temporal profile @xmath86 can be directly related to the applied laser power and phase by means of eq .. for more rapid variations the system has to be integrated exactly to capture all retardation effects .    in the strong driving regime",
    "where @xmath87 the om coupling of eq .",
    "can be linearized : after going to the displaced operators in the qles , and eliminating the classical forces , we drop terms of order @xmath73 relative to those of order @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "the result of this procedure is equivalent to replacing @xmath90 by the linearized om hamiltonian @xmath91 here , we have introduced the laser - enhanced om coupling @xmath92 , which describes interconversion between phonons and photons , as well as the renormalized cavity detuning @xmath93 .",
    "although the latter shift is small in the regime of interest identified below , one has to take it into account when varying @xmath94 .",
    "we will drop the tilde in what follows and also note that we have ignored a contribution @xmath95 to @xmath4 , which can be compensated by local fields acting on the qubit .",
    "finally , if the cavity supports many degenerate modes @xmath96 that couple to the mechanical resonator according to @xmath97 , then only the om coupling to the driven mode is enhanced .",
    "the others may then be neglected due to @xmath98 , which justifies our single - mode treatment . however , this argument breaks down if there is phonon - assisted scattering between the modes , i.e. , for an interaction of the form @xmath99 .    in summary , the om system can be described by an enhanced , linear coupling @xmath100 in @xmath101 between the resonator and an undriven cavity mode .",
    "the qubit dynamics is determined by the heisenberg equations of motion    [ eq : qubitqle ] @xmath102    and the linearized om dynamics ( qles , with @xmath103 ) can be written compactly by introducing the vectors @xmath104 and @xmath105 : @xmath106 here , the drift matrix @xmath107 describes the response of the om system and is explicitly given by @xmath108 where @xmath109 gives the full linearized om coupling and @xmath110 corresponds to the often - applied rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) , which is valid for @xmath111 and renders the coherent part of the dynamics excitation - number- or energy - conserving .",
    "the noise sources driving the om system are summarized in @xmath112 , where @xmath113 represents the fiber input - field and the intrinsic noise is contained in @xmath114 .",
    "the statistics of these noise vectors follow directly from the definitions in the previous subsection and can also be found in app.[sec : applongfiber ] .",
    "we finally note that the system described by @xmath107 generally exhibits self - oscillations for blue detuning @xmath115 as well as bi - stability for red detuning @xmath116 and strong coupling @xmath117 ( see , e.g. , ref.@xcite ) .",
    "however , in this work we will only consider parameters where these phenomena do not occur .",
    "the dynamics of a single node as described by eqs . and allows for a coherent conversion of a qubit excitation into a photon propagating in the optical fiber , as is indicated in fig.[fig : singlenode](a ) : first , the excitation is transferred to the mechanical resonator at a rate @xmath118 , from where it is then up - converted by the excitation - number conserving terms of the om interaction into a cavity photon with a rate @xmath119 , and subsequently emitted into the fiber at a rate @xmath120 . at the same time , this transfer is affected by decoherence in form of mechanical dissipation and photon loss , thereby degrading the fidelity of the interface under realistic conditions .",
    "our goal is now to derive a simplified model for the interface which captures all of these aspects in an effective description for the qubit - fiber coupling only .    to proceed ,",
    "let us first look at the dynamics of the linearized omt , which is fully characterized by the drift matrix @xmath107 defined in eq .",
    "( see also ref.@xcite for an extensive discussion ) .",
    "it has two independent eigenvalues which we identify with @xmath121 , where @xmath122 are the frequencies and @xmath123 the decay rates of the associated om normal modes ( the remaining eigenvalues are simply complex conjugates ) .",
    "we take @xmath124 to be real and positive for simplicity and focus on the case @xmath125 relevant for resonant excitation transfer , where we can distinguish between two regimes : for weak om coupling , @xmath126 , the resonator and cavity modes retain their respective characters and we have , e.g. , @xmath127 , @xmath128",
    ". however , due to a small admixing between the modes the optical cavity provides an additional decay channel for the mechanical system and can lead to significant modifications of the mechanical damping rate . in the limit @xmath129 it is given by @xmath130 ( see left panel of fig.[fig : singlenode](b ) . in the opposite regime of strong om coupling , @xmath131 , resonator and cavity hybridize and the om system exhibits a normal mode splitting ( @xmath132 ) .",
    "this hybridization also implies that both modes decay with the same rate @xmath133 ( right panel of fig.[fig : singlenode](b ) ) . in more general terms we can introduce an om damping rate @xmath134 , which for arbitrary parameters is defined as @xmath135 and reproduces @xmath136 and @xmath137 in the two respective limits .",
    "as @xmath134 is the rate at which mechanical excitations are converted into traveling photons , it sets a maximal transfer rate for the omt .",
    "we expect @xmath138 for typical parameters , which justifies taking limit @xmath71 .",
    "we now consider the experimentally relevant regime where the qubit - resonator coupling @xmath16 is small compared either to @xmath134 or to the detuning from the nearest normal mode , that is , the regime where @xmath139 . in this limit , the dynamics of the om system is fast compared to the qubit - resonator coupling and can hence be adiabatically eliminated , yielding the desired effective description of the omt . to this end",
    ", we formally integrate eq . to obtain @xmath140 where we have neglected transients and",
    "@xmath141 is the om steady state solution in the absence of the qubit ( see eq . for @xmath142 ) .",
    "we may now in a born - markov approximation and to lowest order in @xmath16 replace the qubit operators by their free evolution , i.e. , @xmath143 and re - insert the result into eq .. by keeping only the resonant terms , we obtain effective qles for the qubit operators ,    [ eq : effqubitqles ] @xmath144 \\sigma^- - \\sqrt{\\gamma } \\sigma_z f_{\\rm in}(t)\\,,\\\\ \\dot\\sigma_z & = -\\gamma ( \\mathbb{1}+\\sigma_z )   + \\sqrt{4\\gamma}\\left ( \\sigma^+ f_{\\rm in}(t ) + f^\\dag_{\\rm in}(t )   \\sigma^-   \\right)\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with noise operators @xmath145 . from eq .",
    "we further obtain an effective input - output relation for the fiber field , @xmath146 in eqs.- we have introduced the effective decay rate @xmath2 and frequency shift @xmath147 by the relations @xmath148 where @xmath149 is the om response matrix .",
    "further , @xmath150 is the branching ratio resulting from intrinsic cavity decay and @xmath151 .",
    "note that in writing eq .",
    "we have neglected small corrections related to finite @xmath152 , as well as non - rwa corrections and counter - rotating terms @xmath153 .",
    "the effective equations of motion together with the input - output relation are familiar from atom - light interactions @xcite and describe a two level system which is directly coupled to an optical fiber with an effective decay rate @xmath2 . the om system which mediates this interaction has disappeared from the dynamics , but still determines @xmath2 , @xmath147 , @xmath154 , which can thus be controlled by appropriately adjusting om parameters .",
    "this can be seen in more detail from the expression for the decay rate , @xmath155 where we have assumed @xmath110 and @xmath156 . a plot of the full expression from eq .",
    "is given in fig.[fig : singlenode](c ) for the case @xmath157 and one clearly observes the underlying mode structure of the om system as discussed above .",
    "the decay @xmath2 is suppressed if the qubit is detuned from the om eigenmodes , while under resonance conditions , @xmath158 , it scales as @xmath159 , and we obtain @xmath160 and @xmath161 in the weak and strong coupling regime , respectively .",
    "as we will discuss in more detail in sec.[sec : statetransfer ] below , it is essential for the implementation of deterministic quantum state transfer protocols within quantum networks to have control over the shape of the emitted photon , which can be accomplished by considering a time - dependent decay rate @xmath162 . to achieve this ,",
    "we may make use of the fact that in principle any of the om parameters entering @xmath2 could be varied in an experiment , that is , we consider @xmath163 . the effective markovian description of the qubit dynamics and the algebraic relation in eq .",
    "remain valid as long as the om parameters are tuned slowly relative to the time - scale of the effective resonator decay @xmath164 , such that @xmath165 , etc . in this sense",
    "we may adiabatically adjust the effective qubit decay rate and hence acquire control over the generated signal photon .    _",
    "examples_. as a specific example we consider tuning the om coupling along a path as indicated by the dashed line in fig.[fig : singlenode](c ) . here , @xmath94 varies between 0 and @xmath166 while the qubit frequency is fixed at @xmath167 and @xmath157 .",
    "this corresponds to tuning the lower normal mode in and out of resonance with the qubit , such that @xmath2 can be varied within a certain range @xmath168 $ ] . for @xmath169 the qubit is far detuned by @xmath170 from the resonator mode to which it couples and therefore , the effective decay rate is suppressed according to @xmath171 , which realizes @xmath172 . a residual decay is still provided by mechanical damping @xmath173 , which , however , is negligible for the parameters considered below . by increasing @xmath124 up to @xmath174",
    "we reach the opposite limit of strong om coupling , where the lower om normal mode is in resonance with the qubit and a maximal decay of @xmath175 is achieved . within these limits , a desired time - dependence of the effective decay @xmath176 can thus directly be translated into a profile @xmath94 via eq ..    similarly , we can vary the cavity frequency along the dashed line in fig.[fig : singlenode](d ) , where we chose @xmath167 and it is assumed that the driving laser is at constant power .",
    "this means that @xmath124 varies according to eq . , which has been included in the plot .",
    "we choose @xmath177 at @xmath178 , such that @xmath179 for this path is the same as for the previous one .",
    "starting from this point , the effective decay can be turned off by increasing the cavity detuning as far as needed , with a residual decay due to the resonator as before .      as already mentioned above",
    ", the omt does not only mediate the desired coherent interactions between the qubit and the optical channel , but under realistic conditions also adds noise . in the effective qles this noise appears first of all in form of the operator @xmath180 , which generally represents an effective non - vacuum input that heats the qubit .",
    "second , noise processes also affect the out - field @xmath181 given in eq .",
    "where on the one hand the term @xmath182 represents excess photons which are emitted into the fiber independently of the qubit state and on the other hand @xmath183 accounts for loss of qubit excitations through the cavity s intrinsic decay channels .",
    "let us first look at the noise operator @xmath180 which appears in the qles for the qubit . from its definition in terms of the om drift matrix @xmath107 we see that two - time correlations of @xmath180 decay with @xmath184 .",
    "therefore , on the scale of the effective qubit dynamics , it can be considered as nearly white noise and is characterized by an effective occupation number @xmath185 this expression can be readily evaluated in fourier space as shown in app.[sec : applongfiber ] and for @xmath80 we obtain @xmath186 the first contribution ( given for @xmath110 ) is due to the thermal noise of the resonator s environment and roughly scales as @xmath187 . the second contribution to @xmath188 describes heating due to non - energy - conserving terms in the om coupling , @xmath189 , and accounts for photons scattered from the strong driving beam into the cavity while simultaneously creating a mechanical excitation .",
    "we see that for a qubit on resonance with an om normal mode ( @xmath190 ) the conditions for small thermal noise are @xmath191 , while to reduce the stokes scattering events we need @xmath192 .",
    "the latter conditions describe the so - called resolved side - band regime and therefore , we conclude that the conditions for a low noise omt are equivalent to the requirements for om ground state cooling @xcite .",
    "the second type of noise is the contamination of the cavity output with noise photons originating from up - converted thermal noise or stokes scattering events , as described by the term @xmath193 in eq .. to analyze the effect of these excess photons let us in a first step",
    "imagine that at time @xmath194 the qubit is prepared in the excited state and that we record the number of photons emitted into the fiber during a time - interval @xmath195 .",
    "the observed photon number is given by @xmath196 and for simplicity , we assume that the qubit operator evolves according to @xmath197 , while being uncorrelated with @xmath182 .",
    "we then obtain @xmath198 with the number of excess photons given by @xmath199 which simply yields @xmath200 for time - independent om parameters . for @xmath201 , @xmath202 , @xmath71 , and @xmath203 this quantity",
    "can be estimated , with the matrix @xmath204 defined in app.[sec : applongfiber ] . neglecting non - rwa corrections to the thermal contribution",
    ", we obtain @xmath205 which we evaluate to leading order in @xmath206 . ] to be @xmath207 , and for a qubit resonant with an om mode we may use @xmath208 to obtain the scaling @xmath209 while the terms in parentheses are small under the low noise conditions identified above , the prefactor is much larger than one due to the condition @xmath210 underpinning the adiabatic elimination",
    ". the number of excess photons may thus exceed one and make the signal photon difficult to detect in general .",
    "however , this estimate did not take into account the fact that the qubit emits in a bandwidth @xmath2 around @xmath211 , while the om noise floor is spread over a bandwidth @xmath134 .",
    "therefore , we expect that the excess photons can be substantially reduced to @xmath212 by appropriate filtering , which cancels the large factor @xmath213 appearing in eq .. indeed , we find below that the omt at a second node provides exactly this filtering .",
    "with the concept of the omt laid out in the previous section we are now ready to consider a quantum network , where the omts in the various nodes serve to link the qubits to a common optical fiber , as depicted in fig.[fig : overview ] . to obtain an effective description of the multiqubit dynamics ,",
    "we proceed as before by linearizing the om couplings and eliminating the coupled omts .",
    "we will then discuss how to realize a state - transfer within a two - node network .",

    "however , since the intrinsic level splitting @xmath440 of superconducting qubits is typically in the ghz range , we need to bridge the gap to the mhz resonator frequency @xmath19 in order to obtain a jaynes - cummings coupling .",
    "therefore , we modulate the gate voltages as described in ref.@xcite with frequency @xmath672 and amplitude @xmath673 , which yields the coupling of eq . with @xmath674 here , @xmath675 is the charging energy of the qubit , @xmath676 the equilibrium resonator capacitance , and @xmath439 the equilibrium electrode separation of the coupling capacitance . for @xmath677 , @xmath678 , and",
    "@xmath673 a couple of volts one easily obtains values in the mhz regime ( see also refs.@xcite ) .",
    "if it is necessary to place the qubit further away from the resonator , the coupling could also be mediated by an intermediate normal - conducting wire , or additional superconducting circuitry @xcite .",
    "we estimate the optical @xmath581-factor due to the presence of the electrode , which we assume to cover one third of the resonator and to be thinner than the typical skin - depth of @xmath679 nm . the field then penetrates the whole object and an estimate for the @xmath581-factor is given by @xmath680 @xcite , where @xmath681 is the imaginary part of the relative permittivity of the tip and @xmath682 its volume . using @xmath683 for noble metals at optical frequencies",
    "@xcite we find @xmath684 , which again exceeds the intrinsic @xmath581 .",
    "as has been discussed in sec.[sec : longdistance ] and [ sec : onchip ] , the fidelities for quantum networking operations resulting from the above numbers are mainly limited by intrinsic qubit - dephasing .",
    "improvements of @xmath406 would thus have a big positive impact on the performance and also , especially superconducting qubits would profit from leaving the regime where the evolution of the om degrees of freedom is adiabatic .",
    "in conclusion , we have discussed the potential of micro - mechanical resonators to mediate interactions between dark qubits and light . we have described in detail the dynamics of a single omt and found that the conditions for low - noise operation overlap with those for om ground - state cooling .",
    "further , we have derived an effective description of a multiqubit cascaded network that is suitable for long - distance quantum communication , discussed the relevant noise - sources in such systems , and presented an efficient protocol for state transfer between two nodes . in addition , we have shown how omts can be utilized in an on - chip setting to perform entangling gates between qubits that are spaced by less than @xmath685 . here ,",
    "omts might provide an alternative to other coupling schemes @xcite for scalable quantum processors .",
    "we point out that the ingredients needed for the omt are quite generic and may be implemented with a variety of solid - state qubits and different om systems in the optical , as well as the microwave domain @xcite . in this work",
    ", we have specifically discussed a potential realization for spin and charge qubits , showing that long- and short - distance communication is feasible for present - day technology .",
    "the gate - schemes presented in this work only provide a starting point for optimized and more complex protocols .",
    "in particular , the long - distance state transfer protocol could be extended by schemes to correct for photon loss ( see , e.g. , ref.@xcite ) , while the on - chip gates could profit from spin - echo techniques to reduce the impact of qubit dephasing . in both settings , the limitations posed by imperfect qubits",
    "could be overcome by departing from the adiabtic desciption of the omt and devising fully dynamical gate sequences .",
    "this seems especially worthwhile for charge qubits , where the qubit - resonator coupling @xmath16 can be made large rather easily .",
    "the benefit would be shorter gate - sequences at the price of possibly stronger requirements on controllability .",
    "more generally , the omt can be used to realize complex qubit - light interactions , which may have applications in the implementation of nonlinear optical devices on a few - photon level .",
    "these are particularly interesting in the context of integrated nanophotonic systems , where the proposed device naturally fits in .",
