    "at the ams / maa joint meetings in san antonio in january of 1999 , alice dean presented a paper on rectangle - visibility graphs .",
    "a graph is defined to be a rectangle - visibility graph if there exists a set of closed rectangles on @xmath0 , with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and disjoint except possibly for overlapping boundaries , such that each vertex corresponds to a rectangle and two vertices are joined by an edge if and only if there exists an unobstructed horizontal or vertical corridor of positive width connecting the two corresponding rectangles @xcite .",
    "there are many other concepts of visibility graphs ; two of the most commonly used are the line - segment definition ( @xcite , @xcite ) and the simple polygon definition ( @xcite , @xcite ) .    in this paper , we consider visibility graphs corresponding to an extended notion of visibility .",
    "namely , we define a * sightline * to be a line segment between points in two different regions intersecting no other region . a graph @xmath1 ( all graphs we consider will be finite and simple ) is then defined to be a * visibility graph * if there exists a set of disjoint nonempty connected regions in @xmath0 , with each region corresponding to a vertex of @xmath1 , such that two vertices are connected by an edge in @xmath1 if and only if there exists a sightline between the corresponding regions . throughout this paper",
    ", we will identify vertices with the regions representing them .",
    "note that the regions are required to be connected .",
    "if we do not make this requirement , all connected graphs turn out to be visibility graphs by means of a simple construction .",
    "let @xmath1 be an arbitrary connected graph ; order the vertices @xmath2 so that for all @xmath3 , the induced subgraph @xmath4 is connected .",
    "start with a disk representing @xmath5 .",
    "for each @xmath6 in ascending order of @xmath7 , cut a disk out of each area labeled @xmath8 for all @xmath9 such that @xmath8 and @xmath6 are adjacent in @xmath1 .",
    "label the interior of this disk @xmath6 .",
    "it is then straightforward to check that this yields a visibility representation of @xmath1 , as illustrated in figure  1 .    by requiring the representing regions to be connected",
    ", we eliminate trivial constructions of this nature .",
    "in addition , we can require our representing regions to have other properties such as openness , compactness , and convexity ; each of these yields a different theory of visibility graphs .",
    "we can restrict the theory further by choosing our regions from a severely limited list of objects , such as rectangles , disks or even points .",
    "naturally , with each restriction , the number of representable graphs decreases .",
    "we will be concerned primarily with * compact visibility graphs * , graphs that can be represented as visibility graphs using compact connected subsets of @xmath0 .",
    "( a subset @xmath10 is * compact * if and only if it is closed and bounded ; this is equivalent to requiring every infinite sequence @xmath11 of points in @xmath12 to have a convergent subsequence . )",
    "this restriction allows us to give and prove a necessary property of graphs in this class , while at the same time preserving enough flexibility to facilitate visibility representations for a wide range of graphs .",
    "we begin by considering the case in which our representing regions are not only compact , but also convex .",
    "we define a graph to be a * convex compact visibility graph * , or if it can be realized as a visibility graph in @xmath0 with all representing regions both compact and convex .",
    "one of our main theorems is the following , which gives a necessary condition on such graphs .",
    "[ premain ] if @xmath1 is a convex compact visibility graph , then every edge of @xmath1 must be either a bridge or part of a @xmath13",
    ".    the following lemma will be useful in the proof of the theorem .",
    "[ conhull ]    suppose we have mutually visible regions @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "if any other region intersects a segment joining a point of @xmath14 and a point of @xmath15 , then the edge @xmath16 is part of a @xmath13 in the corresponding visibility graph .",
    "take @xmath17 and @xmath18 so that @xmath19 is a sightline and @xmath20 intersects some other region .",
    "we have two cases : either @xmath21 is a sightline or it is not .",
    "it suffices to consider only the second case ; if @xmath21 is a sightline , then switching the labels of the regions @xmath14 and @xmath15 and replacing @xmath22 by @xmath23 puts us in the situation of the second case .",
    "consider the straight line path @xmath24\\rightarrow b$ ] from @xmath25 to @xmath26 ; as @xmath15 is convex , the image of this path lies entirely in @xmath15 . because all representing regions are compact , for any given region @xmath27 intersecting some sightline @xmath28 there exists some minimal value @xmath29 with @xmath30 intersecting @xmath27 before @xmath15 .",
    "( note that if one such line intersects @xmath27 before @xmath15 , all such lines that intersect @xmath27 must do so before @xmath15 , as @xmath15 and @xmath27 are convex . )",
    "since @xmath31 is occluded , at least one such interloping region exists .",
    "pick the region @xmath27 with @xmath29 minimal , so that @xmath32 is unobstructed for @xmath33 ; if more than one such region exists , pick the one closest to @xmath34 along the line @xmath30 . call the first point of obstruction @xmath35 . then @xmath14 is adjacent to @xmath27 via the sightline @xmath36 .",
    "furthermore , each point on @xmath37 lies on @xmath32 for some @xmath33 and thus must be unobstructed by the definition of @xmath29 .",
    "therefore , @xmath27 is also adjacent to @xmath15 via the sightline @xmath37 , and so the edge @xmath16 is part of the triangle @xmath38 .",
    "we now proceed to the proof of theorem  [ premain ] .",
    "let @xmath14 and @xmath15 be mutually visible regions in a convex compact visibility representation of @xmath1 . because @xmath14 and @xmath15 are compact convex regions , we can find common external tangent lines @xmath39 and @xmath40 to @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "let @xmath41 ( respectively , @xmath42 ) be a point in the intersection of @xmath14 ( respectively , @xmath15 ) and @xmath43 , as shown in figure  2 .",
    "if any other region contains a point in the closed region bounded by @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and these two tangent lines , then this point blocks some sightline between @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "therefore , we can apply lemma  [ conhull ] to conclude that the edge corresponding to @xmath16 is part of a triangle .",
    "we may assume , therefore , that no such region exists .",
    "if every other region is contained either in the area bounded by @xmath14 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 ( and on the opposite side of @xmath14 from @xmath15 ) or that bounded by @xmath15 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 , it is clear that @xmath16 must be a bridge . otherwise , we have one of two cases :    _ case 1 .",
    "some region has nontrivial intersection with both some @xmath44 and the open half - plane on the opposite side of that line from @xmath14 and @xmath15 . _    without loss of generality",
    ", we may assume that this line is @xmath39 , and that the region intersects @xmath39 on the opposite side of @xmath14 from @xmath15 .",
    "let @xmath27 be the first such region encountered by traveling along @xmath39 from @xmath14 away from @xmath15 . because @xmath27 extends at least to @xmath39",
    ", we can construct , as in figure  3 , a sequence of points @xmath45 in @xmath27 so that @xmath45 converges to @xmath46 , and each point @xmath47 is on the opposite side of @xmath39 as @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "now , let @xmath48 be any region besides @xmath27 that intersects the open half - plane on the other side of @xmath49 from @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "then @xmath48 will not intersect the segment @xmath50 by our choice of @xmath27 .",
    "since @xmath48 and @xmath50 are compact sets , the distance @xmath51 between them is positive ; let @xmath52 be the smallest such @xmath51 .",
    "then , if we pick @xmath7 large enough so that @xmath53 , the sightlines @xmath54 and @xmath55 must be unobstructed . thus @xmath38 is a triangle .",
    "no such region exists ; therefore , some region must lie entirely on the opposite side of some @xmath44 from @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "_    we may suppose without loss of generality that this line is @xmath39 .",
    "consider the set of all regions @xmath56 lying on the opposite side of @xmath39 from @xmath14 and @xmath15 . since each region is compact , and does not intersect @xmath39 itself , each has some minimum distance @xmath57 to @xmath39 . choose a region",
    "@xmath48 with minimum distance @xmath52 , and let @xmath58 be such that @xmath59 . now , consider the sightlines @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "these sightlines , which lie entirely on the opposite side of @xmath39 from @xmath14 and @xmath15 , must be unobstructed , for any intervening region @xmath62 would necessarily have @xmath63 .",
    "therefore @xmath64 is a triangle .",
    "thus , in both cases , the edge @xmath16 is part of a triangle .",
    "this completes the proof of the theorem .",
    "the basic concept used in the proof of theorem  [ premain ] is the division of @xmath0 into three areas : the convex hull of @xmath65 , the area blocked from @xmath14 by @xmath15 or from @xmath15 by @xmath14 , and the remainder . using this division",
    ", we showed that if any region @xmath27 intersects either the first area or the third , then @xmath16 is part of a triangle , and if no such region exists then @xmath16 is a bridge .",
    "this division and the proof carry through in the case where the representing regions are not required to be convex .",
    "the details are similar to those of the proof of theorem  [ premain ] , though slightly more technical , and are left to the reader .",
    "[ main ] if @xmath1 is a compact visibility graph , then every edge of @xmath1 is either a bridge or part of a @xmath13 .    in light of this result , one might wonder whether or not the property of convexity is irrelevant to the set of representable graphs ; that is to say , whether all compact visibility graphs are compact convex visibility graphs .",
    "however , figure  4 shows an example of a graph that is a compact visibility graph , but not a convex compact visibility graph .",
    "one might also wonder whether the converse of theorem  [ main ] is true , that is , whether or not every graph satisfying the conclusion of theorem  [ main ] is a compact visibility graph .",
    "this is easily shown to be false , however . to construct a counterexample",
    ", we make use of the following lemma .",
    "[ ncon ] suppose that @xmath1 is a visibility graph of any type , and @xmath66 is a vertex all of whose neighbors are pairwise adjacent in @xmath1 .",
    "then @xmath67 is a visibility graph of the same type .",
    "( by * type * of a visibility graph , we mean a type of restriction on the allowable regions in its representation . )    construct a visibility representation of @xmath1 , and remove the region corresponding to @xmath66 .",
    "consider any edge @xmath16 in the resulting visibility graph , with corresponding sightline @xmath68 . if we consider @xmath19 in the original representation , the only region that can possibly block it is the region corresponding to @xmath66 .",
    "however , if this is the case , then @xmath14 and @xmath15 are each connected to @xmath66 using subsegments of @xmath19 as sightlines , so , by the hypothesis , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are adjacent in the original graph . furthermore , if @xmath66 does not block @xmath19 then @xmath14 and @xmath15 are certainly adjacent in the original graph .",
    "thus the edge @xmath16 also occurs in @xmath67 .",
    "clearly @xmath67 is also a subgraph of the resulting visibility graph , so the two are identical , and the lemma is proven .",
    "now , consider the graph @xmath1 shown in figure  5 , which satisfies the conclusion of theorem  [ main ] .",
    "suppose @xmath1 were a compact visibility graph ; by lemma  [ ncon ] , we could then remove the four outside vertices to obtain a representation of @xmath69 using compact regions .",
    "however , no such representation exists ( as @xmath69 does not satisfy the conclusion of theorem  [ main ] ) , and so @xmath1 can not be a compact visibility graph .    in the proof of lemma  [ ncon ]",
    ", we made explicit use of the geometry of the visibility representation of @xmath1 .",
    "indeed , the geometry of this representation yields a condition on the graph itself , as shown in the following theorem .",
    "[ k4 ] suppose that there exists a convex compact visibility representation of @xmath1 such that two sightlines @xmath68 and @xmath70 intersect , with @xmath71 contained in distinct regions @xmath72 .",
    "then the vertices @xmath14 and @xmath15 are part of a @xmath73 inside @xmath1 .    if the regions @xmath14 and @xmath15 are both contained in the line @xmath74 , or if either region is a point , the proof is fairly straightforward and is left to the reader .",
    "suppose not ; then , without loss of generality , there exists some point @xmath75 not on @xmath74 .",
    "we define a point @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is sufficiently small that @xmath78 still crosses @xmath79 and @xmath80 is still a sightline .",
    "( if this latter condition were impossible , we could construct a sequence of points in some other region converging to @xmath19 , and thus @xmath19 would also not be a sightline . )",
    "we furthermore require that @xmath15 not be contained in the line through @xmath81 and @xmath25 .",
    "now , we have @xmath82 not tangent to @xmath14 , and thus for @xmath26 sufficiently close to @xmath25 we have @xmath83 not tangent to @xmath14 .",
    "pick @xmath84 not on the line @xmath82 . then , take @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is sufficiently small that @xmath87 is a sightline and crosses @xmath70 , and so that the line @xmath83 is not tangent to @xmath14",
    ". then @xmath88 is tangent to neither @xmath14 nor @xmath15 , for it has points from both regions on either side of it .",
    "because of this construction , we can assume without loss of generality that our extended sightline @xmath74 is tangent to neither @xmath14 nor @xmath15 .",
    "let @xmath89 be the minimum distance between any pair of regions ; these distances are well - defined , as all regions are compact . for any line segment @xmath90 ,",
    "let @xmath91 be the length of the projection of @xmath92 onto a line perpendicular to @xmath68 , and @xmath93 be the length of the projection of @xmath92 onto a line parallel to @xmath68 ; then @xmath94 and @xmath95 are always non - negative .",
    "let @xmath96 , where the infimum is taken over all sightlines @xmath92 ( between regions besides @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) intersecting @xmath68 .",
    "it is a simple consequence of compactness and the non - tangency of @xmath74 to @xmath14 and @xmath15 and compactness that we have @xmath97 .",
    "now , since the regions are compact and the line @xmath74 is tangent to neither @xmath14 nor @xmath15 , we can pick @xmath98 be sufficiently small so that a line drawn from @xmath34 ( respectively @xmath25 ) at an angle at most @xmath98 from @xmath68 must intersect @xmath15 ( respectively @xmath14 ) before any other region .",
    "pick @xmath99 so that @xmath100 .",
    "let @xmath101 be a sightline crossing @xmath68 with @xmath102 , and let @xmath27 and @xmath48 be the regions containing @xmath35 and @xmath103 respectively .",
    "we claim that @xmath104 is a @xmath73 in @xmath1 .",
    "to verify this claim , we establish the existence of edges @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 , and @xmath108 .",
    "let @xmath109 be the triangle @xmath110 in the plane , and consider the visibility graph @xmath111 defined by the regions @xmath112 , where @xmath113 ranges over all the regions intersecting @xmath109 from our original visibility representation of @xmath1 ; see figure  6 . as @xmath109 is convex , and all of these new regions",
    "are contained in @xmath109 , all relevant sightlines will also be contained in @xmath109 ; furthermore , @xmath111 is clearly a subgraph of @xmath1 .",
    "now , @xmath111 is a visibility graph , and @xmath114 is an edge of @xmath111 . by theorem  [ premain ] , we know that @xmath114 is either a bridge or part of a triangle .",
    "since @xmath35 and @xmath103 are on opposite sides of the unobstructed sightline @xmath68 , no region besides @xmath14 can intersect both @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "taking the sequence of regions encountered along @xmath117 gives a path from @xmath27 to @xmath14 in the graph @xmath111 , and similarly taking the sequence of regions along @xmath116 gives a path from @xmath14 to @xmath48 .",
    "composing these yields a path from @xmath27 to @xmath48 not including the edge @xmath114 , since @xmath48 can not appear in the first part ( as it appears in the second ) , and @xmath27 can not appear in the second .",
    "consequently , removing the edge @xmath114 can not disconnect the graph @xmath111 , so @xmath114 can not be a bridge in @xmath111 .    therefore , @xmath114 must be part of a triangle in @xmath111 , so there must exist some region @xmath62 with both @xmath118 and @xmath119 edges of @xmath111 .",
    "unless @xmath120 , @xmath62 must lie either entirely above the unobstructed sightline @xmath121 or entirely below it .",
    "however , if @xmath62 lies above this line , the sightline @xmath122 corresponding to the edge @xmath119 crosses @xmath68 .",
    "furthermore , as @xmath123 and the distance from @xmath124 to @xmath35 is at least @xmath52 , it follows from our choice of @xmath125 that @xmath126 , a contradiction .",
    "similarly , @xmath62 can not lie below @xmath121 , as then @xmath127 .",
    "consequently , @xmath62 must be the region @xmath14 , so that both of the edges @xmath105 and @xmath107 occur in @xmath111 and , therefore , in @xmath1 .",
    "interchanging @xmath14 and @xmath15 shows that the edges @xmath106 and @xmath108 must also occur in @xmath1 , so that @xmath104 forms a @xmath73 as desired .",
    "theorem  [ k4 ] rules out an additional class of graphs , and places constraints on possible representations of many more graphs . noting that if a visibility representation has no crossing sightlines , the corresponding graph is planar",
    ", we obtain the following corollary .",
    "every convex compact visibility graphs either is planar or contains a @xmath73 .",
    "an example of a graph that this corollary excludes from being a convex compact visibility graph is shown in figure  7 .",
    "theorem  [ main ] shows that many simple graphs are not compact visibility graphs ; in particular , @xmath128 is not a compact visibility graph for @xmath129 .",
    "furthermore , it is easy to check that every nonempty compact visibility graph must be connected",
    ". nevertheless , we can construct large families of compact visibility graphs .",
    "if @xmath1 has a plane drawing such that all of the internal faces are triangles , then @xmath1 is a compact visibility graph .    assume first that @xmath1 has no cut vertices , that is , vertices @xmath66 such that @xmath67 is disconnected .",
    "we start with a plane drawing of @xmath1 , which we may assume has convex boundary face , and construct from this drawing a compact visibility representation of @xmath1 .",
    "consider any edge @xmath130 .",
    "we break @xmath130 at an arbitrary point in its interior , and interlace the two halves of @xmath130 together at this point , as shown in figure  8 .",
    "we then take as the representing region for @xmath66 the union of all the half - edges containing @xmath66 .",
    "it is clear that every edge @xmath130 corresponds to a sightline ; furthermore , every sightline lies entirely in the interior of some face of the drawing , and thus only connects regions corresponding to the vertices of this face . as these vertices form a @xmath13 in the graph , there are no extraneous edges added , and so this assignment of regions shows that @xmath1 is in fact representable as a visibility graph .    in the case where @xmath1 has a cut vertex @xmath66",
    ", we can split the vertex as in figure  9 and then represent the resulting graph as a visibility graph as before , except that we do not do the above for the edge @xmath131 .",
    "this yields a representation of @xmath1 as a visibility graph .",
    "a simple corollary of theorem 4 , as every tree has a plane drawing with no internal faces , is the following .",
    "all trees can be represented as compact visibility graphs .",
    "in fact , all trees are convex compact visibility graphs , or even compact disk visibility graphs .",
    "since @xmath128 is not a compact visibility graph for @xmath129 , one might suspect that a planar graph @xmath1 is a visibility graph if and only if it has a plane drawing such that all of the internal faces are triangles .",
    "this , however , turns out to be false . consider the case of @xmath132 .",
    "this is easily seen to be a compact visibility graph ( as in figure  10 ) , but it is a planar graph with no such drawing for @xmath133 .",
    "the key point here is that the induced subgraph on the four - sided face is not @xmath69 ; given this , we conjecture that the following modification of the converse holds .",
    "a planar graph @xmath1 is a compact visibility graph if and only if it has a plane drawing such that for all internal faces @xmath134 of @xmath1 , the subgraph @xmath135 induced by the vertices of @xmath134 is a compact visibility graph .",
    "throughout the previous two sections of this paper , we have assumed that our representing regions are compact . in this section ,",
    "we give our rationale for this assumption , as well as some comments about the non - compact theory .",
    "theorem  [ main ] does not hold in the non - compact case . indeed , the cycles @xmath128 are visibility graphs , as shown by the two representations in figure  11 .",
    "furthermore , if we eliminate the hypothesis of compactness , we can even realize disconnected graphs as visibility graphs .",
    "let @xmath14 be the set @xmath136 , @xmath15 be the set @xmath137 , and @xmath27 be the single point @xmath138 , as represented in figure  12 .",
    "then the only unblocked sightlines are between @xmath14 and @xmath15 , and so @xmath139 is a visibility representation of a disconnected graph .    combining the technique of interlacing presented in figure  12 with the second method for realizing @xmath128 presented in figure  11",
    ", we can realize any connected planar graph as a visibility graph .",
    "given a face @xmath134 , for each vertex @xmath66 we construct in the interior of @xmath134 interlocking spirals @xmath140 , each having infinitely many turns ; one of these spirals is shown in figure  13 .",
    "the region corresponding to @xmath66 then consists of the union over all faces @xmath134 containing @xmath66 of the spirals @xmath140 .    while it is not true that we can represent any graph as a visibility graph ( consider the case of two isolated vertices ) , the fact that all connected planar graphs can be realized as visibility graphs leads to the following conjecture :    [ all ] any connected graph is representable as a visibility graph .",
    "it is natural to extend the concept of visibility graphs to higher - dimensional euclidean spaces .",
    "specifically , one might consider the case of @xmath141 .",
    "analogues to rectangle - visibility graphs exist in @xmath141 ; in particular , fekete and meijer @xcite consider the question of which complete graphs are representable as box - visibility graphs .",
    "alternatively , one can require that the sightlines be strictly vertical , and that each representing set lies in a horizontal plane ; the question of such representations has been considered by alt , godau , and whitesides @xcite",
    ".    in @xmath141 , conjecture  [ all ] is true ( using our notion of visibility ) .",
    "let @xmath142 be a spanning tree for an arbitrary connected graph @xmath1 ; using the construction shown in figure  1 with spheres instead of circles , we first construct a visibility representation of @xmath142 . then , to add an edge between two vertices @xmath143 and @xmath144 , we pick any points @xmath145 and @xmath146 , and remove all points on the interior of the line segment @xmath70 .",
    "it is clear that this will only add the single sightline from @xmath143 to @xmath144 , as the line has thickness 0 and all representing regions have positive thickness .",
    "unlike in the two - dimensional case , this construction does not disconnect any regions .",
    "after all remaining edges of @xmath1 have been added in this fashion , one is left with a visibility representation of @xmath1 .    in the compact case , we have results similar to those in @xmath0 . with only slight modifications , the proof of theorem  [ main ] carries over into @xmath147 , so that theorem  [ main ] is true in general euclidean spaces .",
    "this suggests the following two questions .",
    "is it true that all graphs representable as compact visibility graphs in @xmath141 are also representable as compact visibility graphs in @xmath0 ?",
    "does there exist a positive integer @xmath148 such that all graphs representable as compact visibility graphs in any euclidean space are representable as compact visibility graphs in @xmath147 ?",
    "two other venues to which visibility graphs generalize easily are the torus @xmath149 and the sphere @xmath150 ; mohar and rosenstiehl @xcite briefly considered the former case with restricted sightlines . in order to make sense of the general concept ,",
    "we must define the notion of a straight line in both settings .",
    "we define straight lines on the torus by considering it as the quotient space @xmath151 ; on the sphere , we take the straight lines to be the ordinary geodesics . which graphs are representable as visibility graphs in these new settings ?",
    "the generalized concept of a visibility graph lends itself to various applications .",
    "since the set of representing regions contains all of the information about the graph itself , it can be used as an encoding of information about the @xmath148 vertices of a graph @xmath1 and the @xmath152 connectedness relations into a set of @xmath148 objects .",
    "if we require the representing regions to be disks , we have this information using @xmath153 coordinates : one triple @xmath154 for each disk .",
    "visibility graphs also can be used naturally to represent various kinds of networks . for instance , consider a network of army bases on a battlefield that communicate with each other via torch signals ( or , if you will , lasers ) .",
    "the graph of this network will then be the visibility graph represented by the layout of the bases .",
    "similarly , on a more global scale , one may wish to manipulate the situation so that one can communicate in this fashion with one s allies and at the same time intercept lines of communication between one s enemies . in this latter case of two rival alliances ,",
    "it is appropriate to partition the vertices into two classes , and only consider sightlines between two regions of the same class ; what pairs of networks can be realized in this fashion ?",
    "the concept of visibility graphs provides a natural representation of graphs in @xmath0 that can be used to examine these questions .",
