    "the estimation of both types of critical temperatures is effectively achieved from the location ( in temperature axis ) of the second - order moment of the quark multiplicity , know as susceptibility and from the intersection of light and strange quark condensates with the deconfinement order parameters @xmath53 and @xmath54 .    both chiral condensates ( @xmath38 and @xmath39 ) , which can be characterized through thermal , dense and magnetic in - medium modifications of rho - meson , for instance @xcite .",

    "we conclude that the influences of the magnetic field are almost the same as that of the baryon chemical potentials , especially on decreasing the phase - transition temperature .",

    "the latter is conjectured to connect the cross - over of the qcd boundary at low density ( chemical potential ) and the first - order phase transition at high density @xcite . in light of this , we recommend systematic measurements for the phase - transition characterizing signals such as the fluctuations and the dynamical correlations in various interacting systems and centralities .",
