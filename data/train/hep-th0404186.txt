    "indeed , a peculiar type of charts is selected , made out of those charts which , to a given @xmath9 , associate a neighbourhood of the origin of the vectorial space , @xmath10 , tangent to @xmath6 at @xmath3 .",
    "this local , punctual approach can certainly be intuitively motivated different ways .",
    "let us just mention that it seems intimately related to some of the practical aspects met in the situations of satellites navigation such as the gps or galileo systems . in effect ,",
    "each of the satellites belonging to a gps constellation , so to say , realizes somehow this kind of a local punctual equivalence by registering other satellites own ephemeris and calandar data , as well as proper times given by embarked atomic clocks . in this respect",
    ", one can say that spatio - temporal charts are achieved  on board \" , on some kind of  table of the charts \" @xmath10 , as one would say with the help of a navigation terminology broadly used in the gps technologies . from the mathematical standpoint , it will therefore be postulated that these  on board \" or  table of the charts \" aspects , are those of a running vectorial tangent spacetime @xmath10 .",
    "one has indeed to realize a set of charts of the projective space defined on , and associated to each moving tangent spacetime .",
    "that is , in particular , and at a given fixed proper time , charts of the celestial sphere attached to a given observer at @xmath3 .",
    "this , in turn , amounts to recognize that the charts are implicitly associated to a conformal geometry .    in order to stress the fundamental deployment aspect of our approach",

    "we build up the mathematical formalism corresponding to the deployment of a conformal geometric structure from an isometrical one .",
    "we assume the unfolded spacetime @xmath6 to be of class @xmath12 , of dimension @xmath13 and locally connected .",
    "let @xmath3 be a particular point in @xmath6 , @xmath9 an open neighborhood of @xmath3 in @xmath6 , and @xmath10 its tangent space .",
    "the so - called _  punctual \" _ principle of equivalence we will be relying on ( compatible with the usual ones from m. ghins view ; private communication ) , states that it exists a local diffeomorphism , @xmath14 , we call the  equivalence map \" , attached to @xmath3 , and putting in a one - to - one correspondence the points @xmath15 with some vectors @xmath16 in an open neighborhood of the origin of @xmath10 : @xmath17 we will see that this description is really well - suited since it is also strongly related to the mathematical tools to be used in the sequel , where any given point @xmath3 acquires a specific mathematical status .    let us add that a more standard local equivalence principle would consist in considering @xmath11 an euclidean space @xmath18 and the equivalence map @xmath19 as a local chart of an atlas of @xmath6 on an open neighborhood @xmath20 , such that :    @xmath21    moreover , we assume that each of these two kinds of spacetimes is endowed with a metric field , denoted by @xmath22 for @xmath6 , and by @xmath23 with signature @xmath24 for @xmath11 .",
    "eventually , we make the general assumption that @xmath11 has a constant riemaniann scalar curvature with value @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) , and then is  conformally flat \" , i.e. , the weyl tensor is vanishing .",
    "this assumption , in view of the h. weyl theorem @xcite , will ensure the integrability of the conformal lie pseudogroup associated to @xmath23 , and denoted here by @xmath27 .",
    "then if @xmath28 , @xmath29 is a solution of the pde system : @xmath30 with @xmath31 , @xmath32 the jacobian of @xmath33 , and @xmath34 its pull - back .",
    "also , @xmath35 is a function associated to , and varying with each @xmath33 . as a particular case , the set of diffeomorphisms @xmath33 for which @xmath36 constitutes the so - called  poincar lie pseudogroup @xmath37 \" or , equivalently , the lie pseudogroup of isometries .",
    "we denote by @xmath38 the elements of @xmath37 .",
    "contrarily to appearances , an element @xmath33 ca nt be defined in a somewhat one - to - one correspondence , out of a given element @xmath38 and a given function @xmath35 .",
    "this can be obtained only if the metric field @xmath23 on @xmath11 satisfies a particular condition , that we will call  s - admissibility \" , which will be defined and precised in the sequel . moreover ,",
    "if the latter condition is satisfied , then only the elements of a proper lie sub - pseudogroup of @xmath27 , we denote by @xmath39 , can admit such a decomposition , as will be demonstrated at the exterior differential forms level ( see theorem 3 below ) .",
    "this s - admissibility condition allows us to define a deployment in the sense of a deformation from the @xmath37 pseudogroup to the @xmath27 one .",
    "in fact , since both spacetimes @xmath6 and @xmath11 are locally diffeomorphic to @xmath18 , the above alluded deployment relates the geometrical structures , i.e. , their metric fields .",
    "then we consider that the metric field @xmath40 on @xmath10 , is a deployment or a deformation of @xmath23 .",
    "the deployment or deformation terminology will accordingly be used in either cases of @xmath6 and @xmath11 , or @xmath41 and @xmath23 .",
    "we have to focus on the fact that though spacetimes @xmath6 and @xmath11 are diffeomorphic in view of the equivalence map , their two respective metric fields are not , i.e. , @xmath22 is not a pull - back of @xmath23 .",
    "nevertheless these two metric fields will be conformally equivariant . in some analogy with the decomposition for @xmath33 , the metric field @xmath41",
    "will be described in terms of @xmath23 and some other fields which will reveal to be thinkable in terms of unified electromagnetic and gravitational fields . in fact , the deformations in @xmath39 of the applications @xmath42 will define tetrads used to obtain @xmath41 out of @xmath23 .",
    "hence , as a result , the equivalence map will be also parametrized by electromagnetic and gravitational potentials .",
    "this classical approach based on deformation theory , differs from the classical gauge one in general relativity @xcite .",
    "indeed the latter are developed out of a given gauge lie group .",
    "but at first , they are not lie pseudogroups , and in a second place , they are assossiated to lie groups invariance of the tangent spaces ( not the tangent fiber bundle but the fibers ) at any fixed base point @xmath3 .",
    "they can accordingly be regarded as isotropy lie subgroups of the corresponding pseudogroups .",
    "for instance , in fixing the function @xmath35 to a constant , the set of applications @xmath33 becomes a lie group and not a lie pseudogroup .",
    "in that case the applications @xmath33 would depend on 15 real variables at @xmath43 , and no longer on a set of arbitrary functions , as we will be seen in the conformal pseudogroup case .    also it is neither a kaluza - klein type theory nor is it based on a riemann - cartan geometry . in the present model , there is no torsion .",
    "it also completly differs from the h. weyl unifications and the j .-",
    "souriau approach @xcite .",
    "close approaches to ours , are developed on the one hand by m. o. katanaev & i. v. volovich @xcite , and on the other hand by h. kleinert @xcite and j .- f .",
    "pommaret @xcite . at lower dimensions ,",
    "other general relativity models are investigated within similar approaches such as models of gravity in @xcite for instance .",
    "in fact , our present work can somehow be viewed as an extension of the t. fulton _",
    "_ approach and model @xcite , or , as a continuation of the original works of j. haantjes @xcite .",
    "to finish , we indicate that the mathematical tools used for this unification finds its roots , first in the conformal lie structure that has been extensively studied by h. weyl @xcite , k. yano @xcite , j.  gasqui @xcite , j. gasqui & h. goldschmidt @xcite and j .- f .",
    "pommaret @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , we only partially refer to some of these aspects since it mainly has to do with the general theory of lie equations , and not exactly with the set of pde we are concerned with .",
    "we essentially indicate , succintly , the cornerstones which are absolutely necessary for our explanations and descriptions of the present framework .",
    "first of all , and from the previous sections , we assume that the pseudogroup of relativity is no longer poincar but the conformal lie pseudogroup .",
    "in particular , this means that no physical law changes occur , shifting from a given frame embedded in a gravitational field , to a uniformly accelerated relative isolated one @xcite .",
    "the conformal finite lie equations are deduced from the conformal action on a _ local _ metric field @xmath23 defining a pseudo - riemannian structure on @xmath44 .",
    "we insist on the fact we do local studies , meaning that we consider _ local _ charts from open subsets of the latter manifolds into a common open subset of @xmath18 . hence by geometric objects or computations on @xmath18 ,",
    "we mean _ local _ geometric objects or computations on the manifolds @xmath6 , @xmath45 and/or @xmath11 .",
    "also , it is well - known that the mathematical results displayed below are independent of the dimension when the latter is greater or equal to 4 @xcite .    let us consider @xmath46 , the set of local diffeomorphisms of @xmath18 of class @xmath12 , and any function @xmath47 .",
    "then if @xmath28 ( @xmath27 being the pseudogroup of local conformal bidifferential maps on @xmath18 ) , @xmath29 is a solution of the pde system ( [ first ] ) . in fact",
    "other pde must be satisfied to completely define @xmath27 as will be seen in the sequel . also , only the @xmath48 positive conformal factors are retained so as to preserve one orientation only on @xmath18 , and we will accordingly restrict ourselves to those @xmath33 which preserve that orientation ( we recall that @xmath35 _ is a varying function depending on each @xmath33 and consequently not fixed _ ) .",
    "we denote @xmath49 the metric on @xmath18 such that by definition : @xmath50 , and we agree on putting a tilde on each tensor or geometrical  object \" relative to , or deduced from the metric @xmath49 .",
    "now , performing a first prolongation of the system ( [ first ] ) , we deduce another second order system of pde s connecting the levi - civita covariant derivatives @xmath51 and @xmath52 , respectively associated to @xmath23 and @xmath49 .",
    "these new differential equations are ( see for instance @xcite ) @xmath53 : @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the exterior differential and @xmath56 is the ",
    "@xmath23-dual \" vector field of the 1-form @xmath57 with respect to the metric @xmath23 , i.e. , such that @xmath58 : @xmath59 since the weyl tensor @xmath60 associated to @xmath23 is vanishing , the riemann tensor @xmath61 can be rewritten @xmath62 as : @xmath63 where @xmath64 is defined by ( see the tensor ",
    "l \" in @xcite up to a constant depending on @xmath1 ) @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the ricci tensor and @xmath67 is the riemann scalar curvature .",
    "consequently , the first order system of pde in @xmath68  connecting \" @xmath69 and @xmath61 , can be rewritten as a first order system of pde concerning @xmath70 and @xmath64 . using the torsion free property of the levi - civita covariant derivatives and applying again the covariant derivative @xmath52 on the relation ( [ 3 ] ) ,",
    "one obtains the following _ third _ order system of pde ( since @xmath35 is depending on the first order derivatives of @xmath33 ) : @xmath71 in which we have defined the symmetric tensor @xmath72 by : @xmath73 to go further , it is important again to notice that the relation ( [ 10 ] ) is directly related to a third order system of pde , we will denote by ( t ) , since it is deduced from a supplementary prolongation procedure applied to the second order system ( [ 3 ] )",
    ". then it follows , from the well - known theorem of h. weyl on the equivalence of conformal structures @xcite , and because of the weyl tensor vanishing , that the systems of differential equations ( [ first ] ) and ( [ 3 ] ) when completed with the latter third order system ( t ) , becomes an involutive system of order three .",
    "let us stress again that @xmath35 is merely defined by @xmath33 and its first order derivatives , according to the relation ( [ first ] ) .",
    "looking only at those applications @xmath33 which are smooth deployments of applications @xmath38 , this third order system of pde must reduce to a particular system of pde , associated to a conformal lie sub - pseudogroup we denote by @xmath39 . indeed , if @xmath35 tends towards the zero function ( with respect to the @xmath74-topology ) then , the previous set of smoothly deformed applications @xmath33 must tend towards the poincar lie pseudogroup . but",
    "this condition is not satisfied by all of the applications @xmath33 in the conformal lie pseudogroup @xmath27 , since in full generality , the non - trivial third order system of pde ( t ) would be kept at the zero @xmath35 function limit : the sub - pseudogroup @xmath39 would have to be defined by an involutive second order system of pde which would tend towards the involutive system defining the poincar lie pseudogroup .",
    "the systems of differential equations ( [ first ] ) and ( [ 3 ] ) would be well suited to define partially this pseudogroup @xmath39 .",
    "the @xmath1-acyclicity property of @xmath39 would be restored and borrowed , at the order two , from the poincar one , provided however that an , a priori , arbitrary _ input _ perturbative function @xmath35 is given before , instead of being defined from an application @xmath33 in accordance with the relation ( [ first ] ) . but the formal integrability is obtained only if the tensor @xmath64 satisfies one of the following equivalent relations ( see fromula ( 16.3 ) with definition ( 3.12 ) in @xcite ) : @xmath75 deduced from relation ( [ 7 ] ) , in order to avoid adding up the supplementary first order system of pde ( [ 10 ] ) to ( [ first ] ) , @xmath35 being considered an input function . in fact , as it is well - known , the relations above are a consequences of the constant riemann curvature tensor assumption , but they appear in a different way .",
    "then , considering the system ( [ first ] ) and ( [ 11 ] ) , the system ( [ 10 ] ) reduces to a second order system of pde concerning the input function @xmath35 only , which is thus constrained , contrarily to what might have been expected , and such that : @xmath76\\omega(x , y)\\right\\}+d\\alpha(x)d\\alpha(y)\\ , .",
    "\\label{12}\\ ] ] obviously , as can be easily verified , this is an involutive system of pde , since it is a formally integrable system with an elliptic symbol ( i.e. a vanishing symbol ) of order two .    thus , we have series of pde deduced from ( [ first ] ) defining all the _ smooth _ deformations of the applications @xmath38 contained in the conformal lie pseudogroup @xmath27 .",
    "in addition , the metric field @xmath23 satisfies the relation ( [ 11 ] ) ( which is an einstein equation when the stress - energy tensor is proportional to the metric , or when the latter is vanishing but with a non - zero cosmological term ) . in that case ,",
    "such a metric field @xmath23 , or the substratum spacetime @xmath11 will be called _ s - admissible _ ( with s as  substratum \" ) , and this s - admissibility is assumed in the sequel .",
    "setting @xmath77 in an orthonormal system of coordinates , then the pde ( [ first ] ) , ( [ 3 ] ) and ( [ 12 ] ) defining @xmath78 can be written , with @xmath79 and @xmath80 as :    @xmath81    [ confeq ]    where @xmath82 is the kronecker tensor , and where one denotes as usual @xmath83 , etc   ,",
    "@xmath84 and @xmath85 for any tensor @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the inverse metric tensor , and @xmath88 is the riemann - christoffel form associated to the _ s - admissible _ metric @xmath23 .",
    "this is the set of our starting equations .",
    "it matters to notice that the ( t ) system is not included in the above set of pde .",
    "indeed , the latter being already involutive from order 2 , this involves , by definition of involution , that the ( t ) system is redundant since all the applications @xmath89 , solutions of ( [ confeq ] ) , will also be solutions of all the systems of pde obtained by prolongation .",
    "it is pertinent to notice that @xmath90 or , equivalently , the tensor @xmath91 might be considered as an abraham - etvs type tensor @xcite encountered in the etvs - dicke experiments for the measurement of the stress - energy tensor of the gravitational potential .    at this point",
    ", it may also be worth making contact with some previous set of physical interpretations @xcite ( up to a constant for units and with @xmath43 ) according to which the tensor @xmath90 is ascribed to the stress - energy tensor , @xmath92 to the gravity acceleration 4-vector , and @xmath35 to the newtonian potential of gravitation .",
    "let us now look for the formal series , solutions of the pde system ( [ confeq ] ) , assuming from now on , that the metric @xmath23 is analytic .",
    "we know these series will be convergent in a suitable open subset and thus will provide analytic solutions , since the analytic system is involutive and in particular elliptic , because of a vanishing symbol ( see , in appendix 4 of @xcite , the malgrange theorem for elliptic systems ) .",
    "nevertheless , we need of course to know the taylor coefficients . for instance",
    ", we can choose for the applications @xmath68 and the functions @xmath35 the following series at a point @xmath93 : @xmath94 with @xmath95 being a suitable open neighborhood of @xmath96 to insure the convergence of the series , @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 are multiple index notations such as @xmath100 , @xmath101 with @xmath102 and similar expressions for @xmath103 .",
    "likewise , @xmath104 and @xmath105 are sets of taylor coefficients , whereas the @xmath106 and @xmath107 are real values and not functions of @xmath96 , though of course , they can also be values of functions at @xmath96 ( let us remark that we could consider instead the vector : @xmath108 , which strengthens the equivalence principle we are using with @xmath10 as substratum spacetime @xmath11 ) .    also we must add that usual partial derivatives will be used in these taylor series determinations instead of covariant derivatives .",
    "the use of either of the two derivatives is thoroughly as discussed in the appendix , and shown to be basically equivalent .",
    "we call the  generalized haantjes - schouten - struik system \" ( ghss system ) , the system of pde ( [ third ] ) ( see @xcite for this system , but at @xmath109 ) .",
    "it is from this set of pde that gauge potentials and fields of interactions could occur . from the series @xmath110 , at zero - th order one obtains the _ algebraic equations _ ( @xmath111 ; @xmath112 ) : @xmath113 and it follows that the @xmath107 s such that @xmath114 , will depend recursively only on @xmath96 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "it is none but the least the meaning of formal integrability of so - called involutive systems .",
    "hence the series for @xmath35 can be written as a convergent series , @xmath117 , developed with respect to powers of @xmath118 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "let us notice that we can change or not the values at @xmath119 of the series @xmath110 , by varying @xmath96 , @xmath115 or @xmath116 .",
    "let @xmath120 be the 1-jets affine bundle of the @xmath12 real valued functions on @xmath18 .",
    "then , from the latter remark , it exists a subset associated to @xmath121 , we denote by @xmath122 , the set of elements @xmath123 , such that there is an open neighborhood @xmath124 , being projected on @xmath18 in an open neighborhood of a given @xmath125 , for which , for all @xmath126 , then , @xmath127 .",
    "assuming that the variation @xmath128 with respect to @xmath96 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 is vanishing , at a given fixed @xmath119 , is the subset @xmath129 a submanifold of @xmath120 ?",
    "from @xmath130 it follows that ( @xmath131 ) : @xmath132 we recognize a regular analytic pfaff system , we denote by @xmath133 , generated by the 1-forms @xmath134 and @xmath135 , and the meaning of their vanishing is that the solutions @xmath110 for @xmath35 do not change for such variations of @xmath115 , @xmath116 and @xmath96 .",
    "also , as can be easily verified , the pfaff system @xmath133 is integrable since the frbenius conditions of involution are satisfied , and all of the prolongated 1-forms @xmath136 with @xmath114 , are linear combinations of these @xmath137 generating forms , thanks to the recursion property of formal integrability .",
    "then the subset @xmath129 of dimension @xmath1 containing a particular element @xmath138 , is a submanifold of @xmath120 .",
    "it is a particular leaf of , at least , a local foliation @xmath139 on @xmath120 of codimension @xmath137 .",
    "then , since the system of pde defined by the involutive pfaff system @xmath133 , namely the ghss system , is elliptic ( i.e. , vanishing symbol in the present case ) and formally integrable , one deduces that it exists on @xmath120 , local analytic systems of coordinates @xmath140 of the transverse submanifold of the foliation , such that each leaf @xmath129 is an analytic submanifold @xcite for which @xmath141 and @xmath142 @xmath143 . in other words , all the series @xmath144 with @xmath145 are convergent and correspond to one single analytic solution @xmath146 ( @xmath147 ) , analytic with respect to @xmath119 as well as with respect to the @xmath60 s .",
    "this results from the @xmath110 continuous series convergent character , whatever the fixed set of given values @xmath119 , @xmath96 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "thus , in full generality , considering the difference @xmath148 we have the relation : @xmath149 with the @xmath60 parameters related by ( @xmath97 ) @xmath150 now , we consider the @xmath151 s as values of differential ( i.e. @xmath12 ) functions @xmath152 : @xmath153 , as expected for usual taylor series coefficients , and defined on a starlike open neighborhood of @xmath96 ( the integrals above define none but the least than a homotopy operator , and that  starlike \" open subsets obviously mean simply connected open subsets @xcite ) . roughly speaking",
    ", we make a pull - back on @xmath18 by differentiable sections @xmath61 , inducing a projection from the subbundle of projectable elements in @xmath154 to @xmath155 .",
    "then , we set ( with @xmath156 , @xmath157 and no changes of notations for the pull - backs ) :    @xmath158    [ rhoab ]    and it follows that the integrals ( [ integsig ] ) must be performed from @xmath96 to @xmath159 in a starlike open neighborhood of @xmath96 . in particular , if @xmath160 is an element of the  null \" submanifold , or stratum , corresponding to the vanishing solution of the  ghss system \" , then the difference ( [ diffs ] ) involves that @xmath161 with @xmath162 this result displays the functional dependencies of the @xmath60 deformation parameters of the solutions of the  ghss system \" , with respect to the functions @xmath163 and @xmath164 .",

    "eventually , we will end up this section with a few speculations concerning the point base @xmath3 motion in a spacetime endowed with the metric field @xmath41 .",

    "on the one hand , if we denote by ( @xmath389 )    @xmath390    [ prec ]    then we recover in ( [ lnu ] ) , up to some suitable constants , the lagrangian density for a particle ( with charge @xmath391 ) , with the _ velocity n - vector @xmath20 _ ( @xmath392 ) , embedded in an external electromagnetic field . but also from the relation ( [ thomas ] ) we will find _  a generalized thomas precession \" _ if the tensor @xmath393 , assumed to depend on @xmath110 , in that specific case only , but not on @xmath96 , is ascribed ( up to a suitable constant for units ) to a _  polarization @xmath1-vector \" _",

    "now , if the @xmath405 s are constants and in the case of an explicit @xmath110 dependence of the @xmath349 s , not the one induced by @xmath406 , this would lead to a modification of the action @xmath384 resulting from the introduction of lagrange multipliers @xmath407 and @xmath408 ( @xmath131 ) in the lagrangian density definition .",
    "we would then define a new action of the type : @xmath409 the associated euler - lagrange equations would be analogous to ( [ geod ] ) , but with additional terms coming from the generalized thomas precession previously evoked .",
    "moreover , since we have the constraint @xmath392 , we need a new lagrange multiplier denoted by @xmath410 .",
    "then the variational calculus would also lead to additional precession equations giving rise to torsion . in the present situation",
    ", torsion is not related to unification but to parallel transports on manifolds which is a well - known geometrical fact @xcite .",
    "hence , the existence of a precession phenomenon for a spin or polarization @xmath1-vector @xmath393 would be correlated with the existence of linear ode for a charged particle of charge @xmath391 interacting with an electromagnetic field .",
    "otherwise , without ( [ thomas ] ) the ode s would be non - linear and there would nt be any kind of precession of any spin or polarization .    consequently the motion defined by the second term in the r.h.s . of ( [ geod ] ) for a spinning charged particle would just be , in this model , a point of view resulting from an implicit separation of rotational and translational degrees of freedom achieved by the specialized ( sensitive to particular subgroups of the symmetry group of motions ) experimental apparatus in @xmath411 .",
    "this separation would insure either some simplicity ( i.e. , linearity ) or , since the measurements are achieved in @xmath411 , that the equations of motion are associated ( _ via _ some kind of projections inherent to implicit dynamical constraints , due to the experimental measurement process and apparatus , fixing , for instance , @xmath391 to a constant ) to linear representations of tangent actions of the lorentz lie group on @xmath411 . in the latter case",
    ", one could say , a somewhat provocative way of course , that special relativity invariance would have to be satisfied , _ as much as possible _ , by physical laws .",
    "note that this  reduction \" to linearity ca nt be done on the first summation in the r.h.s . of ( [ geod ] ) , which must be left quadratic contrarily to the second one , since the riemann - christoffel symbols ca nt be defined covariantly ( other arguments can be found in  @xcite ) .    to conclude , equations ( [ geod ] ) would provide us with another interpretation of spin or polarization ( the @xmath349 s ) as an object allowing moving particles to generate effective spacetime deformations , as  wakes \" for instance .",
    "in the present article , we have been using the pfaff sytems theory and the spencer theory of differential equations , to study the formal solutions of the conformal lie system with respect to the poincar one .",
    "more precisely , we determined the difference between these two sets of formal solutions .",
    "we gave a description of a  relative \" set of pde , namely the  ghss system \" , which provides the basis of a deployment from the poincar lie pseudogroup to a sub - pseudogroup of the conformal lie pseudogroup .",
    "we studied these two systems of lie equations because of their specific occurrence in physics , particularly in electromagnetism as well as in einsteinian relativity .    relying on this concept of deployment",
    ", we made the assumption that the unfolding is related to the existence of two kinds of spacetimes , namely , a substratum spacetime @xmath11 , from which the spacetime manifold @xmath6 is unfolded .",
    "we recall that not all of the given metrics on @xmath11 are admissible so as to define , at least along the lines proposed in the present article , such a deployment of @xmath6 out of a substratum spacetime @xmath11 . in the case of a substratum spacetime @xmath11 endowed with an appropriate s - admissible metric , allowing for unfolding , we assumed that @xmath11 is equivariant with respect to the conformal and poincar pseudogroups , and set its riemannian scalar curvature to a constant @xmath25 , and its weyl tensor to zero . at this stage",
    ", the deployment evolution can be trivial or not depending on the occurences of spacetime singularities ( of the deformation potentials ) parametrizing or dating what can be considered somehow as a kind of spacetime history .",
    "the deformation potentials are built out of a particular relative spencer differential sequence associated to the  ghss system \" , and describing smooth deformations of @xmath11 .",
    "then a  local \" metric @xmath41 , defined on a moving tangent spacetime @xmath10 to the unfolded spacetime @xmath6 , is constructed out of the s - admissible substratum metric @xmath23 , and of the deformation potentials .",
    "an unification of two of the most fundamental aspects of our physical word come out realized with , we think , a number of new and interesting new lights shed on various issues of contemporary physics .",
    "the tangent spacetimes dynamics are given by a system of pde satisfied by their lorentzian velocities @xmath1-vectors @xmath20 , exhibiting both classical electrodynamic and  local \" ( since metrics are local ) geodesic navigation in a spacetime endowed with gravitation .",
    "throughout , our approach has remained `` classical '' and quantization does nt seem to play much role . but",
    "quite on the contrary , we think that the formalism developed here could provide the basis of a new and deeper recasting of whole branches of physics , the quantic world included .",
    "this is of course because of the fundamental role played by symmetries at any scale , and not solely at the classical one . in this line of thinking",
    ", it is worth pointing out some recent reflexions of g. t hooft about ",
    "obstacles on the way towards quantization of space , time and matter \" @xcite .",
    "t hooft s theory of  ontological states \" , involved in his approach of  deterministic quantization \" , strongly requires such a description of spacetime as a fluid , as well as its close relationship with the principle of coordinate invariance .",
    "it is interesting to remark that the taylor coefficients could be defined , for any solution , from partial as well as covariant derivatives of the solution ; the results remain essentially the same . indeed , given a covariant derivative @xmath412 on @xmath10 ,",
    "the basis vectors @xmath413 associated to the coordinates @xmath414 , the notations @xmath415 and @xmath416 for derivatives of order @xmath417 , and the monomial @xmath418 ( where @xmath419 is an element of an @xmath221-vector space of finite rank type ) , the following relation at @xmath96 holds true : @xmath420 this result is nothing but an example of a more general situation such as the one encountered in the kumpera - spencer property @xcite @xcite or in the gasqui lemma ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 0.1 ) ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 0.2 ) .",
    "this shows also the vectorial ( not affine ) feature of the symbol spaces , i.e. , the space of elements @xmath419 at any given order @xmath421 .",
    "this property has also much to do with the so - called  meshing assumption \" of ghins and budden exhibited here as a ground mathematical property , necessarily satisfied in the framework of our gravity approach .",
    "moreover , in full generality we will not put any restrictions on the kind of vectors @xmath422 , the former to be defined by some constraints involving covariant derivatives for instance . in that case",
    ", we would consider for example , other taylor coefficients by substituting the @xmath423 for the @xmath424 .",
    "and then , considering @xmath425 to be invariant along a geodesic curve associated to the basis vector @xmath413 , we would deduce @xmath426 .",
    "this would simplify the taylor expansion .",
    "nevertheless , the discussion in what follows would be complexified , setting a supplementary restrictive assumption on @xmath35 ( for a detailed discussion on that point , one may see @xcite ) .",
