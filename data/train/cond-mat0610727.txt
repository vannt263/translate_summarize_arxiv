    "since the realization of the bose - einstein condensed ( bec ) atomic gases @xcite , there has been much interest in ultracold trapped atomic systems to study quantum many - body phenomena . besides the bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) @xcite , one can now study degenerate atomic fermi gases @xcite and bose - fermi mixtures @xcite .",
    "these systems offer great promise to exhibit new and interesting phenomena of quantum many - particle physics .",
    "sogo and yabu @xcite studied the ground state properties of fermi gas composed by two spin components with various repulsive interaction and showed the phase transition between the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic states .",
    "furthermore we extended this study on the spin phases of the ground state to that for the asymmetric gas with a nets spin in the presence of an external magnetic field and gave the phase diagram about these spin phases @xcite .",
    "an important diagnostic signal for many - body systems is the spectrum of collective excitations .",
    "such oscillations are common to a variety of many - particle systems and are often sensitive to the interaction and the structure of the ground state . in ref.@xcite",
    "we have also studied the spin excitation on the dipole and monopole oscillations in the two - component fermion condensed system .",
    "the frequencies of the collective oscillations with the out - of - phase show the dependence on the fermion - fermion interaction while those with the in - phase are not sensitive to the interaction .",
    "particularly the frequencies of the out - of - phase modes show rapid changes in the phase transition between the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic spin - phases .",
    "the monopole oscillations can be defined only in the spherical symmetric system . in usual experiments traps",
    "have elliptically deformed shapes , where the monopole oscillations are coupled with the quadrupole oscillations .",
    "if the trap is largely deformed with the axial symmetry the oscillations must be decoupled into the modes of oscillations along the transverse and longitudinal directions ; we shall call them the transverse breathing ( tb ) and longitudinal breathing ( lb ) modes .",
    "in this paper we study the coupled oscillation states of the two component fermi gases between the tb and lb modes in deformed traps .",
    "the oscillation behaviors are expected to show various features as the deformation of the trap is changed .",
    "the underlying theoretical tool to treat dynamic problems of dilute quantum gases is the time - dependent mean field theory .",
    "this is reduced to the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) for small amplitudes , and the theory in this form has been applied to density oscillations of these systems @xcite . when the single - particle spectrum is regular , the long - wavelength excitations are collective and simpler methods can be used to calculate the frequencies , in particular with sum rules @xcite or the scaling approximation . in this work",
    "we calculate the frequencies of these collective oscillations by using the scaling method @xcite .",
    "this scaling method is physically quite transparent , but it is in fact equivalent to the theory based on energy - weighted sum rules @xcite , as used for example in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we will only consider here the case of positive scattering lengths which correspond to a repulsive interaction .",
    "when the interaction is attractive , the system is superfluid in its ground state and the excitation properties are controlled by the energy gap .",
    "in addition we will focus only on the collective oscillations in the paramagnetic spin phases , and do not deeply discuss those in the ferromagnetic regime .    in the next section",
    "we will explain our formulation , and show calculational results in sec .",
    "3 . in sec.4",
    "we will summarize our work .",
    "we begin with the expression for the energy of a dilute trapped condensate in the mean - field approximation : @xmath0   \\label{etot}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath1 where @xmath2 are orbital wave functions indexed by orbit @xmath3 and component @xmath4 , @xmath5 are the longitudinal and transverse frequencies of the trapping field and @xmath6 is the coupling strength of a contact interaction .",
    "here we assume that all fermions have the same mass , @xmath7 , but we do not need to treat these components as the spin state of the same fermion .    in order to study the collective oscillation",
    ", we introduce the following scaling for the fermion wave - function : @xmath8 with @xmath9\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the wave - function in the ground state , @xmath11 are the time - dependent collective coordinates for the oscillation , and @xmath12 are the time - derivatives of @xmath11 .",
    "the factor @xmath13 is the gallilei transformation factor which is determined to satisfy the continuum equation .",
    "let us obtain the total energy under the above scaling by substituting the wave - function ( [ scwf ] ) into the total energy functional ( [ etot ] ) . the total energy becomes @xmath14 where the superscript @xmath15 indicates @xmath16 and @xmath17 at the ground state .    in this work we use the thomas - fermi ( tf ) approximation to evaluate the above total energies .",
    "the tf approximation makes the spherical symmetric in the momentum distribution at each position and gives the following relation : @xmath18 in addition the ground state densities @xmath19 become functions of @xmath20 .",
    "here we can then make a change of variables to simplify the appearance of the thomas - fermi equations as follows .",
    "@xmath21 where @xmath22 is a certain coupling constant which is chosen later .    with the scaled variables and the thomas - fermi approximation , the expression for the total energy at the ground state is @xmath23 where @xmath24 .",
    "the tf equations for the densities @xmath25 are derived by variation of the energy with a constrain on the fermion numbers .",
    "this yields @xmath26 in this equation @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the lagrange multiplier to constraint the numbers of the fermion-1 , @xmath29 and -2 , @xmath30 , respectively , and they are rewritten with @xmath31 and @xmath32 ; these @xmath31 and @xmath32 have the meanings of the fermi energy and the external magnetic field in fermion gas when the two components of fermions are described with two different spin states of one fermion .    in this expression the ground state",
    "is determined by the three variables , @xmath33 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , but the two variables , @xmath33 and @xmath31 , are not independent because of the scale symmetry in eq.([tfeq ] ) @xcite . in this work",
    "we choose @xmath22 as a critical coupling constant of the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phase transition at a fixed chemical potential in the symmetric system @xmath34 . with this choice",
    "the fermi energy is fixed to be @xmath35 .",
    "the solution of these equations is discussed in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite . with fixed values of @xmath36 and @xmath37 ,",
    "the spin phase of the two component fermi gas turns to be paramagnetic ( @xmath38 ) , ferromagnetic(@xmath39 ) in order as the coupling constant , @xmath33 , increases .",
    "furthermore the total energy in collective oscillations is given as @xmath40 with @xmath41 where @xmath24 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "the interaction energy @xmath45 appears @xmath46    in order to describe the collective oscillations , we obtain the variation of the total energy up to the order of @xmath47 ) as @xmath48 with @xmath49 @xmath50 with @xmath51 where the vector @xmath52 is defined as @xmath53 . the terms propritional to @xmath52 disappears because of the virial theorem .",
    "then the classical equation of motion for @xmath52 is harmonic , giving rise to the following eigenvalue equation for the oscillation frequencies , @xmath54 { \\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\lambda$}}= 0 . \\label{eigeq}\\ ] ]    before performing actual calculations , we should discuss the collective oscillations in some extreme conditions .    in the largely deformed system , @xmath55 or @xmath56 ,",
    "first , the four oscillation modes are decoupled into two groups , two oscillations modes in the longitudinal directions , and the other two modes in the transverse directions .",
    "we can obtain these decoupled modes by taking @xmath57 . in the symmetric system ,",
    "@xmath58 , furthermore , the two kinds of modes are further decoupled into the in - phase ( @xmath59 ) and the out - of - phase ( @xmath60 ) modes ; namely the four excited oscillations are decoupled into the in - phase transverse breathing ( itb ) , in - phase longitudinal breathing ( ilb ) , out - of - phase transverse breathing ( otb ) and out - of - phase longitudinal breathing ( olb ) modes .",
    "the oscillation frequencies in the symmetric system become @xmath61 where the superscripts @xmath62 and @xmath63 indicate the in - phase and out - of - phase modes , respectively , and the subscripts t and l denote the oscillations in the transverse and longitudinal directions , respectively .",
    "note that @xmath64 , @xmath65 and so on .",
    "next we discuss the oscillations in the near - spherical symmetric system , @xmath66 . in this system",
    "the oscillation modes are decoupled into the monopole and quadrupole oscillation modes .    by taking the collective",
    "coordinates to be @xmath67 , we can obtain the frequencies of the monopole oscillations with the following equation : @xmath68   \\left ( \\begin{array}{c } \\lambda_1 \\\\ \\lambda_2 \\end{array } \\right )    = 0\\ ] ] with @xmath69    by taking the collective coordinates to be @xmath70 , similarly , we can also calculate the frequencies of the quadrupole oscillations with @xmath71   \\left ( \\begin{array}{c } \\lambda_1 \\\\ \\lambda_2 \\end{array } \\right )   = 0\\ ] ] with @xmath72    in the symmetric system @xmath34 , these modes are also decoupled to the in - phase and the out - of - phase modes .",
    "then the oscillation frequencies in the symmetric system become @xmath73 where the subscript m and q indicate the monopole and quadrupole frequencies , respectively .",
    "in this section we discuss the collective oscillations coupled with the transverse and longitudinal breathing modes . as mentioned in the previous section we fix the fermi energy to be @xmath35 , which makes the parametric and ferromagnetic spin phase transition at @xmath74 when @xmath37 .",
    "density profiles illustrating these three regimes are shown in fig .",
    "the panels show the densities as a function of distance @xmath75 in a weak magnetic field ( @xmath76 ) and at three different interaction strengths : @xmath77(a ) , 0.95(b ) and 1.05(c ) .",
    "the solid and dashed lines represent the scaled density distribution of major and minor components of fermions . from top to bottom , the panels show paramagnetic ( a , b ) and ferromagnetic ( c ) .",
    "next we calculate the collective oscillations by solving eigenvalue equation ( [ eigeq ] ) . in this equation",
    "we obtain four eigenvalues corresponding to collective oscillation frequencies . for convenience",
    "we define these four frequencies as @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 in order of the frequencies from the larger one to the lower one .",
    "in addition we refer to the four collective modes with the frequencies @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 as modes-1 , -2 , -3 and -4 , respectively .    in fig .",
    "[ mdlt1 ] we show the frequencies of oscillations as functions of the deformation parameter @xmath82 at the coupling constant @xmath83 ( a ) , @xmath84 ( b ) and @xmath85 ( c ) .",
    "the solid lines represent the first and third frequencies @xmath78 and @xmath80 , and the chain - dotted lines indicate @xmath79 and @xmath81 . in these calculation",
    "we take the magnetic field to be @xmath86 , where the system is almost symmetric between the two component , @xmath87 . in the same figures ,",
    "furthermore , we also plot the frequencies of the transverse and longitudinal breathing modes with the dashed and dotted lines , respectively .",
    "first we see the strong level mixing between modes-2 and -3 at two deformation parameters , @xmath88 and @xmath89 ( @xmath90 ) . when @xmath91 and @xmath92 , the frequencies in the full calculation ( solid lines ) are almost the same as those in the calculations decoupled with the transverse and longitudinal modes ( dashed and dotted lines ) , though they are quite different when @xmath93 .    in fig",
    "[ mdlt2 ] we also give the same quantities but with @xmath94 .",
    "the system is not symmetric @xmath95 , but the results are quite similar to those in fig .",
    "[ mdlt1 ] though the difference in the frequency at the level mixing points between the modes-2 and -3 is a little larger than those in fig .",
    "[ mdlt1 ] .    for future discussions we refer to the three deformation parameter regions , @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath92 as the prolate deformed , the semi - spherical and the prolate deformed regions , respectively .",
    "the transverse and longitudinal breathing oscillation modes are almost decoupled in both the oblate and prolate deformed regions , while these modes are coupled in the spherical region .    in order to know the level mixing behaviors more ,",
    "we calculate the four following components : @xmath98 where @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 are components of the itb , ilb , otb and olb modes , respectively . in fig .",
    "[ evc1 ] we show the components of the eigenvectors at the mode-1 ( a ) , the mode-2 ( b ) , the mode-3 ( c ) and the mode-4 ( d ) with @xmath103 and @xmath86 .",
    "the solid , chain - dotted , dashed and dotted lines represent @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 , respectively .",
    "the results show that the phase of the modes-1 and -4 are in - phase in all @xmath104 regime . when the system is oblate deformed ( @xmath105 ) .",
    "the mode-1 is almost the itb mode .",
    "as @xmath104 increase , the system approaches the spherical , the ilb component in the mode-1 mode gradually becomes larger .",
    "when the system becomes spherical ( @xmath106 ) , the mode-1 becomes a mixed mode with the itb and ilb in the same ratio : namely the mode-1 is the monopole oscillation .",
    "as the system is further deformed to the prolate shape , the transverse component decreases and the longitudinal one increases and the oscillation becomes the in - phase longitudinal oscillation in @xmath107 limit .",
    "the mode-4 has the same behavior , but its phase is out - of - phase ; the otb mode when @xmath96 , the out - of - phase monopole mode at @xmath108 and the olb mode when @xmath109 .",
    "the variations of the modes-2 and -3 show more complicated behaviors .",
    "the mode-2 is mainly the otb mode in the oblate deformed region ( @xmath96 ) , and the olb mode in the prolate deformation region ( @xmath109 ) .",
    "the mode-3 is the ilb mode in the oblate deformation , and the itb mode in the prolate deformation . at @xmath88 and @xmath89 , the modes-2 and",
    "-3 make the level mixing and exchange their roles .",
    "namely the modes-2 and -3 are in - phase out - of - phase oscillations in the semi - spherical region , respectively .",
    "as @xmath104 approaches zero , the tb and lb oscillation modes are mixed . at @xmath106 ,",
    "the mode-2 becomes the in - phase quadrupole oscillations , ( @xmath110 ) and the mode-3 becomes the out - of - phase ones , respectively .",
    "thus we know that the four modes agree with the frequencies of the tb and lb modes , when @xmath111 ( @xmath112 ) , and @xmath113 ( @xmath105 ) . on the other hand these modes show different behaviors in the nearly spherical symmetric system ( @xmath114 ) , where the collective oscillations are described as the coupled modes of the monopole and quadrupole oscillations .    in fig .",
    "[ evc2 ] , furthermore , we show the same quantities in fig .",
    "[ evc1 ] but with @xmath94 .",
    "the feature discussed above is less clear , but also seen in the case of the strong magnetic field .",
    "when @xmath94 , the number asymmetry is not so small , @xmath115 .",
    "the mixing between the in - phase and out - of - phase modes is very small in modes-1 and -4 .",
    "the similar result was shown for the monopole oscillation in the spherical trap . even in modes-2 and -3 ,",
    "this mixing is seen only in the region near @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "hence we can disregard the mixing between the in - phase and out - of - phase modes in qualitative discussions , and consider that modes-2 and -3 exchange their roles around @xmath116 and @xmath117 .    in order to know more details of the deformation dependence",
    ", we should examine relations between the frequencies of the collective oscillations and the coupling constant @xmath33 .",
    "first we show the frequencies of the monopole and quadrupole oscillations versus the coupling constant @xmath33 in the spherical symmetric system ( @xmath118 ) with the @xmath86 in fig .",
    "the solid and dashed lines represent the results of the monopole and quadrupole oscillations . in the completely spherical symmetric system the monopole and quadrupole states are decoupled , and there is no level mixing between these two modes . in the paramagnetic phase ( @xmath119 ) ,",
    "larger frequencies correspond to the in - phase oscillation modes both in the monopole and quadrupole modes .",
    "the monopole modes make the level mixing between the in - phase and out - of - phase modes in the ferromagnetic phase ( @xmath119 ) , while the quadrupole modes do not show the level mixing .",
    "as the coupling becomes larger , the frequency of the oscillation modes except the in - phase monopole oscillation mode decreases monotonically until @xmath120 , and increases above that , while the frequencies of the in - phase monopole oscillation are almost invalid . when the coupling constant increases further , the level mixing between the two modes of the monopole oscillation occurs .",
    "next we study the non - symmetric system , where all the four modes can be mixed . in fig .",
    "[ spclmq ] we show the frequencies of the mode-1 , -2 , -3 and -4 as the functions of the coupling constant with @xmath121 ( @xmath122 ) ( a ) , @xmath123 ( @xmath124 ) ( b ) , @xmath125 ( @xmath126 ) ( c ) and @xmath127 ( @xmath128 ) ( d ) . in these figures",
    "we see again that the levels between modes-2 and -3 are mixed at a certain @xmath33 . when @xmath129 ( fig .",
    "[ spclmq ] ) , for example , the frequencies of modes-1 and -2 are @xmath130 , and those of modes-3 and -4 are @xmath131 at @xmath132 . as the coupling becomes larger , the frequencies of modes-2 and -4 monotonously decreases while those of modes-1 and -3 is almost invalid , and then the the level mixing between modes-2 and -3 occurs at @xmath133 .",
    "as the deformation parameter @xmath104 increases , the difference between @xmath134 and @xmath135 becomes larger , and the level mixing occurs at larger coupling constant .",
    "as the deformation parameter further increases , the level mixing disappears when @xmath96 because the minimum value of @xmath79 is larger than @xmath80 , and the level mixing can not occur .",
    "the @xmath79 becomes minimum at the border between the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases @xmath136 , where the level mixing occurs when @xmath88 .    in fig .",
    "[ spvcg ] we show the components of the eigenvectors at the mode-1 ( a ) , the mode-2 ( b ) , the mode-3 ( c ) and the mode-4 ( d ) with @xmath86 and @xmath137 .",
    "the mode-1 and the mode-4 are almost itb and olb modes in the weak coupling region , respectively . as the coupling , @xmath33 , increases ,",
    "the ilb and otb components are gradually mixed in both the modes . in the case of the mode-1 , this mixing is small , while in the mode-4 the olb and otb components are more largely mixed , particularly around @xmath136 .    in this figure , furthermore , we can also see the level mixing between modes-2 and -3 . at @xmath132 the mode-2 and",
    "the mode-3 are the ilb and otb modes . as the coupling increases , the itb and olb components are more mixed in the mode-2 and the mode-3 , respectively . at @xmath133 the level mixing occurs . the strength of the components is exchanged between the modes-2 and -3 .",
    "in this paper we study the collective breathing oscillations in the deformed traps .",
    "the oscillations contain the four kinds of the oscillation , itb , otb , ilb and olb modes .",
    "when the shape of the traps are largely deformed , either oblate or prolate , these modes are decoupled . as this shape becomes close to being spherical ,",
    "the transverse and longitudinal modes are coupled , and make the monopole and quadrupole oscillations .",
    "the borders between these coupling and decoupling are at @xmath138 and @xmath139 , where the otb and ilb modes make level crossing .    in the deformed traps the frequencies of the itb and ilb modes agree with twice of the trap frequencies and are not so different from those of the non - interacting system .",
    "the frequencies of the otb and olb modes show some coupling dependence and give information of the interaction , their qualitative behaviors are however similar to those in the dipole oscillation @xcite .",
    "in the semi - spherical traps , on the other hand , the collective oscillations exhibit more complicated behavior because of the level mixing .",
    "hence we can get significant information on many body system of fermi gas by investigate breathing oscillations with the various fermion - fermion couplings and deformations of the trap near being spherical ( @xmath140 ) .    in this work we do not discuss extremely deformed system ( @xmath141 or @xmath142 ) .",
    "in such extreme conditions the system becomes a quasi - low dimension one @xcite , and the collective oscillation can be expected to show quite different behaviors from those in our work @xcite .      for reviews ,",
