    "it can be regarded as one of the most intriguing results of half a century in physics of hot magnetized plasmas , that in macroscopically stable equilibria the confinement is nevertheless determined by micro - scale instabilities and fluctuations , with transport of energy and particles across magnetic flux surfaces being dominated by ubiquitous turbulence on small ( gyro radius ) scales and low ( drift ) frequencies @xcite .",

    "an improved understanding of the underlying turbulent dynamics and of its relation to design parameters , like the shape of the confining magnetic field , will facilitate the development of advanced magnetic confinement experiments .    the plasma shape of a tokamak enters into confinement and transport modelling through parameters specifying a vertical elongation @xmath0 and an outboard side triangularity @xmath1 that describe the deviation from a simple circular torus .",
    "the design criteria of the iter plasma shape with @xmath2 and @xmath3 ( at @xmath4 flux surface ) are based on a conservative regime that is well established in present experiments @xcite .",
    "more extreme variations of flux surface shaping were investigated with the experiment tcv ( tokamak  configuration variable ) which is able to achieve configurations up to @xmath5 and @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "experimental evidence suggests that large elongation is always beneficial for local and global energy confinement , whereas the role of triangularity depends also on the value of the plasma pressure gradient .",

    "shaping effects are complicated even for apparently simple circular equilibria @xcite , and efforts to perform modelling for edge plasmas most often incorporate technically complicated prescriptions in an inflexible way @xcite .",
    "an advantageous way to explore shaping is through the use of a covariant metric in a model with cartesian topology @xcite , but even then it was found that the use of experimental geometry , while most realistic for modelling purposes , may not be helpful to theoretical understanding , and hence standard `` kappa - delta '' models were used @xcite . in attempt to understand the effects of stellarator geometry , a set of analytical forms were used for the metric , varying each in turn to provide a small set of steps from tokamak to stellarator geometry @xcite .",

    "the emphasis is on physical mechanism , which is complimentary to and should also be helpful to the understanding of the more experimentally oriented modelling efforts .",
    "it is found that turbulent transport fluxes are reduced by increasing flux surface elongation @xmath7 .",
    "the influence of triangularity @xmath8 is much weaker and generally also depends on elongation and on a pressure shift .",

    "an enhancement of zonal flow amplitude in the spectra by elongation and x - point shaping is found to be weak in the dalf case and more pronounced in the itg case .",
    "the reduction of transport observed in our simulations in shaped tokamak geometry is mainly a result of local and global magnetic shear .",
    "we begin in section ii with a brief review and discussion of the role of sheared flows in tokamak turbulence in context of the toroidal flux surface geometry . in section iii the gyrofluid electromagnetic model gem for edge turbulence computations is presented , and the flux tube representation of tokamak geometry within a gem turbulence code is discussed in section iv .",
    "transport scalings by elongation and triangularity , that are obtained with this model , are presented in section v. resulting frequency and wave number spectra in tokamak divertor geometry are discussed in section vi .",

    "one of the main requirements for successful performance of fusion experiments is the prospect of operation in a high confinement h - mode @xcite . the formation of a characteristical transport barrier in magnetically confined toroidal h - mode plasmas is closely related to the presence of a radially varying electric field near the last closed flux surface @xcite . a radial electric field , @xmath9 , gives rise to a perpendicular e - cross - b ( exb ) flow through the relation @xmath10 .",
    "if @xmath9 varies with @xmath11 , then this flow is sheared , and this flow shear is what is invoked to explain the transport barrier @xcite .",
    "the flow shear ( vorticity ) is expected to suppress turbulent transport either by shearing the eddies apart @xcite or by simply tilting them so that their reynolds - stress interaction with the vorticity layer tends towards energy transfer out of the eddies and into the flow @xcite .",
    "neoclassical equilibrium effects can also produce these shear layers @xcite . as opposed to these mean exb flows , the fluctuating zonal flows in direct interaction with the turbulence",
    "have also been observed in tokamak edge regions @xcite .",
    "the transition between states of low ( l ) plasma confinement to the high ( h ) confinement regime featuring such an edge transport barrier is up to now not satisfactorily described by any of the existing first - principle theories @xcite . the notion that generation of zonal flows by direct drive of the turbulence can act to self - regulate by suppressing the driving turbulent vortices has lead to the development of predator - prey type bifurcation models that are able to describe specific characteristics of the l - h transition ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "early computations based on the resistive - g @xcite and collisional drift wave @xcite models found self - generated sheared flows which could be argued as an l - h transition trigger .",
    "however , more recent models in more comprehensive treatment of the toroidal geometry and also the full range of scales of motion do not find this @xcite .",
    "the phenomenology of these self consistent zonal flows receives wide interest @xcite , but they serve as a moderator of the turbulence rather than a suppression mechanism , as the energetic interactions with not only the pressure but also magnetic parts of the equilibrium tend to place each part of the overall dynamical system , which naturally includes the flows themselves @xcite .    after the initial discovery of the h - mode in the divertor experiment asdex @xcite it has been found in numerous large tokamaks around the world that the presence of a divertor ( originally designed to improve the impurity exhaust ) significantly enhances the prospect of reaching this state @xcite . however , up to now both the transition models as well as the numerical simulations have relied mainly on simplified representations of the plasma geometry . in our present work",
    "we investigate the effects of realistic flux surface shaping on tokamak edge turbulence using a gyrofluid model recently corrected for energy conservation properties @xcite , thereby updating previous gyrofluid results @xcite .",
    "this provides a counterweight to existing efforts based on collisional fluid equations and associated numerical schemes which can not treat the ion gyroradius scales and therefore overestimate linear phenomena based in the larger scales @xcite .",
    "the ion gyroradius necessarily enters because the dynamics is sensitive to phenomena in the range of the spectrum with perpendicular wavenumbers only slightly less than the inverse of the drift scale ( @xmath12 , also called `` ion sound gyroradius '' ) , and with comparable ion and electron temperatures @xmath12 is commensurate with the ion gyroradius @xmath13 @xcite",

    "transport in a fusion edge plasma is dominated by turbulent low - frequency drift wave motion that causes a fluid - like convection through exb vortices in a plane perpendicular to the magnetic field direction , acting in concert with parallel coupling dynamics tending towards dissipation @xcite . in general",
    "this is both nonlinear and electromagnetic @xcite .",
    "toroidal compressibility of zonal ( flux surface averaged ) exb flows opens channels in the nonlinear dynamics of the vortex - flow interaction that strongly affect the flow energetics @xcite .",
    "the origin of the compression is the geodesic curvature of the magnetic field lines .",
    "the flow is thereby coupled with poloidally asymmetric pressure sidebands which are consumed by the turbulence and global alfvn or parallel flow dynamics .",

    "@xcite and the various coupling effects throughout the flow / equilibrium system were analysed in refs .",
    "@xcite , and the sensitivity of the turbulence to the geodesic energy transfer effect was explored using an additional scaling parameter for the strength of its coupling @xcite .",
    "this geodesic transfer mechanism represents a restoring loss channel for the zonal flows , ultimately placing them in statistical equilibrium with the turbulence , with the reynolds stress ( spin - up ) mechanism continuing to operate . since the latter acts on all frequencies , the geodesic acoustic oscillation ( gam ) @xcite itself need not be present for the geodesic transfer mechanism to operate .",
    "the net result of this is that turbulent transport in 3d toroidal edge computations is found to be reduced but not completely suppressed by the self - generated zonal flows .",
    "this geodesic transfer effect was first studied for the case of a simple circular toroidal magnetic field @xcite , in the following we give both numerical evidence and a physical picture of how plasma shaping and the presence of a divertor via its modification of plasma geometry can influence the outcome of the gyrofluid turbulence / flow interaction .",
    "the dynamical character of cross - field exb drift wave turbulence in the edge region of a tokamak plasma is governed by electromagnetic and dissipative effects in the parallel response .",
    "the most basic drift - alfvn ( dalf ) model to capture the drift wave dynamics includes nonlinear evolution equations of three fluctuating fields : the electrostatic potential @xmath14 , electromagnetic potential @xmath15 , and density @xmath16 .",
    "the tokamak edge usually features a more or less pronounced density pedestal , and the dominant contribution to the free energy drive to the turbulence by the inhomogeneous pressure background is thus due to the density gradient . on the other hand , a steep enough ion temperature gradient ( itg ) in the edge does not only change the turbulent transport quantitatively , but adds new interchange physics into the dynamics .",
    "in addition , more field quantities have to be treated : parallel and perpendicular temperatures @xmath17 and @xmath18 and the associated parallel heat fluxes , for a total of six moment variables for each species .",
    "finite larmor radius effects introduced by warm ions require a gyrofluid description of the turbulence equations .",
    "both the resistive dalf and the itg models can be covered by using the six - moment electromagnetic gyrofluid model gem @xcite , but we will refer for the dalf model to its more economical two - moment version @xcite .",
    "the gyrofluid model is based upon a moment approximation of the underlying gyrokinetic equation .",
    "the first complete six - moment formulation was given for slab geometry @xcite , and later extended to incorporate toroidal effects @xcite using a ballooning - based form of flux surface geometry @xcite .",
    "electromagnetic induction and electron collisionality were then included to form a more general gyrofluid for edge turbulence @xcite , with the geometry correspondingly replaced by the version from the edge turbulence work , which does not make ballooning assumptions and in particular represents slab and toroidal eigenmode types equally well and does not require radial periodicity @xcite .",

    "concerning the geometric effect on this , we find different results for the dalf and itg parameters .    in the dalf case , the cumulative amplitude of the components in the radial spectrum of flow shear @xmath137 is the same within fluctuation error bars for aug geometry as for the circular torus .",
    "the lowest @xmath139 component in these spectra , which is found to be stronger in the aug case , makes up for only approximately 8% of the total vorticity .",
    "the spectra are shown in fig .",
    "[ f : zf - dalf ] .",
    "flow shear in the dalf case thus is not significantly enhanced by flux surface shaping .",
    "also the amplitude of zonal flows in the dalf frequency spectra in fig .",
    "[ f : freq - dalf ] is found to be comparable for circular and shaped configurations .",
    "the reduction of turbulent edge transport is in this case therefore mainly a result of the local magnetic shear effect @xcite .    in the itg case , the flow shear rate deduced from the @xmath139 spectra of zonal vorticity is cleary higher in all components for the aug tokamak than for the circular torus , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ f : zf - itg ] .",
    "the cumulative amplitude in the spectra is by 70% higher in aug geometry than in simple torus geometry .",
    "flux surface shaping introduced by elongation and x - point shaping clearly enhances flow shear significantly for itg edge parameters . the zonal flow amplitude in fig .",
    "[ f : freq - itg ] is also by a factor of three larger in the elongated configuration .",
    "this shear flow enhancement contributes to the overall turbulent transport reduction by elongation , as has been discussed in section v , in addition to the effects of magnetic shear damping and the reduction of interchange drive .",
    "the detailed relative importance of these three mechanisms may however change with varying plasma parameters .",
    "dalf : @xmath139 spectra of flow shear rate in aug geometry ( bold line ) and for the simple circular torus ( thin line ) .",
    "the cumulative flow shear amplitude in the spectra is similar for both cases.,width=283,height=207 ]     itg : @xmath139 spectra of zonal vorticity related to nonlinear growth rate ( setting the flow shear ) in aug and sct geometry .",
    "shear flows are cleary enhanced in the aug configuration in all components.,width=283,height=207 ]",
    "we have discussed the effects of flux surface shaping on tokamak edge turbulence and flows .",
    "elongation strongly reduces the turbulent transport , whereas triangularity was found to have only weak ( transport enhancing ) influence .",
    "two regimes of edge plasma parameters were studied : an electromagnetic resistive drift wave ( dalf ) case , and the ( itg ) case with an additional ion temperature gradient of @xmath84 .",
    "the scaling of local transport is roughly with the inverse square of elongation , showing a stronger reduction for itg parameters than for dalf parameters .",
    "the itg result is consistent with earlier findings with the previous version of the gem model @xcite .",
    "the mechanisms of flux surface shaping effects on turbulence have been discussed . the major cause for transport reduction by elongation is damping of turbulence by stronger local magnetic shear at the upper and lower parts of the torus on top of increased global magnetic shear .",
    "the supervening reduction of the interchange drive by a lower normal curvature has an additional turbulence reduction effect in particular for itg parameters , where the interchange drive is slightly weakend . in the itg case a significant enhancement of zonal flow shear by elongation and x - point",
    "shaping further contributes to transport reduction .",
    "the shear flow effect is on the other hand found to be negligible for dalf parameters .",
    "both the dalf and itg parameter regimes used in our computations seem consistent with the presently still poor experimental knowledge on edge ion temperature profiles , though this situation is rapidly improving @xcite .",
    "it can be assumed that additional core plasma heating , e.g. by neutral beam injection ( nbi ) used in particular for obtaining the transition to an h - mode , is both increasing the ion temperature at the pedestal top and the ion temperature gradient in the overall edge pedestal region .",
    "based on our results , the shaping of tokamak flux surfaces by elongation and by the additional presence of an x - point like in aug is expected to facilitate an enhancement of zonal flows when the role of the ion temperature gradient dynamics is pronounced by additional heating .",
    "it can be expected that this enhancement of zonal flows found for itg parameters is even more pronounced for more strongly shaped flux surfaces nearer to the separatrix .",
    "preliminary results suggest that such initial radially local flows have the ability to spread over wider regions of the pedestal in simulations with global profile evolution .",
    "some l - h transition theories include zonal flows as a trigger mechanism to induce the transition to a sustained mean shear flow .",
    "the enhancement of zonal flows by flux surface and x - point shaping in the presence of ion temperature gradient steepening may offer an additional explanation for the observation that h - mode access in tokamak experiments is facilitated by the presence of a divertor .",
    "the possibility to obtain a confinement transition within first principle computations of edge turbulence will thus have to be studied with a code that includes full temperature dynamics , realistic flux surface geometry , global profile evolution , and a coupling of edge and sol regions including realistic sheath boundary conditions , while in addition it maintains sufficient grid resolution , grid deformation mitigation , and energy plus enstrophy conservation in the vortex / flow system .",
