    "hs2324 + 3944 was recognized analyzing the hamburg schmidt survey plates ( hagen et al .",
    "1995 , wisotzki 1994 ) .",
    "it has been classified as a lgehpg1159 ( dreizler et al .",
    "1995 ) , following the scheme of werner ( 1992 ) .",
    "dreizler et al . ( 1995 , hereafter dwhe95 ) have made a detailed analysis of the spectral characteristics of hs2324 + 39 ; here is a brief summary of what they have found .",
    "hs2324 + 39 is a `` hybrid pg1159 star '' , showing h balmer absorption features in its spectrum , and it is the only `` hydrogen pg1159 '' not surrounded by a planetary nebula .",
    "the high h abundance ( h / he = 2.0 @xmath3 by number ) is about 10 times the upper limit found by werner ( 1995 ) for pg1159035 ! the abundances of he , c and n ( c / he = 0.3 , n / he @xmath4 0.002 ) are `` normal '' , whereas the o abundance ( o / he = 0.006 @xmath2 0.004 ) is quite low respect to the `` standard '' pg1159 stars ( o / he = 0.13 for pg1159035 ) .",
    "the effective temperature is equal to ( 130000 @xmath2 10000 ) k ; the surface gravity , corresponding to log @xmath5 = 6.2 @xmath2 0.2 , is one of the lowest for the pg1159 stars without nebula .",
    "in fact , hs2324 + 39 is located in a region of the @xmath0 ",
    "@xmath1 plane where most objects are central stars of planetary nebulae ( cspn ) ( dwhe95 fig .",
    "5 ) .    with these values for temperature and gravity , hs2324 + 39 results",
    "to be well within the gw vir instability strip .",
    "presently the group of the gw vir stars is formed by 13 objects ( 9 cspn , 4 not showing a nebula ) , whose luminosity has multi - frequency variations , due to the presence of non - radial g - mode pulsations ( bradley 1995 , silvotti et al .",
    "1995 and references therein ) .",
    "the typical values of the pulsation periods are 1035 minutes for the variable cspn ( also called pnnv ) , and 515 min for the pulsating stars without nebula ( also called dov ) .",
    "the driving mechanism proposed to explain the pulsations in all these stars is the @xmath6 mechanism , based on the c / o cyclic ionization ( starrfield et al .",
    "it has been shown ( stanghellini et al .",
    "1991 ) that even a small amount of h in the driving layers can be sufficient to inhibit the pulsation mechanism .",
    "such a high sensitivity to the chemical composition could in principle explain why not all the pg1159 stars do pulsate .",
    "now the high h abundance of hs2324 + 39 would suggest that no pulsations are possible for this star .",
    "therefore the presence or the absence of pulsations in hs2324 + 39 seemed to be an interesting test for the gw vir pulsation mechanism .",
    "for this reason i decided to investigate on the variability of hs2324 + 39 .",
    "the results of two photoelectric observations of this star are presented in the following section of this paper .",
    "a preliminary communication on the variability of hs2324 + 39 has been already published ( silvotti 1995 ) .",
    "i observed hs2324 + 39 with the 2-head photoelectric photometer ( piccioni et al .",
    "1979 , bartolini et al .",
    "1993 ) of the 1.5 m loiano telescope ( italy ) on october 19 and 20 , 1995 , with no moon .",
    "the tubes used , two emi 9784 qb , have a maximum sensitivity in the b band .",
    "both observations were carried out without filter , with an integration time of 2 s. the comparison stars of the two observations were different ( silvotti 1995 ) .",
    "the light curves of the target and the comparison star for the two nights are shown in silvotti ( 1995 ) . here",
    "i have selected the best curves , i.e. the difference of magnitude between target and comparison star for the 19/10 observation , and hs2324 + 39 alone for the 20/10 observation .",
    "the light curves are shown in fig .",
    "1 , where each point represents a 4 s integration ( the data were binned bringing the effective integration time from 2 to 4 s ) . in both light curves",
    "we can see several arc features with a mean period of about half an hour .",
    "the quiescent zone in the light curve of october 19 ( fig . 1 from about 0.3 to 0.35 fractional barycentric julian day ( bjd ) ) could be caused by the interference of different frequencies .    from the discrete fourier transform of the best night ( 19/10 )",
    "we obtain a period of ( 2130 @xmath2 70 ) s , with an amplitude of 10 mmag . the amplitude spectrum is presented in fig .",
    "2 , together with the spectrum of a sinusoid with the same time distribution , same period and same amplitude ( spectral window ) . if we make the discrete fourier transform of both nights together ( 32 @xmath7 duty cycle ) , the main peak is at about 2130 s ( amplitude 10 mmag ) , in very good agreement with the values obtained on the first night .",
    "things are a bit different considering the second night alone : the spectrum shows two peaks at ( 2220 @xmath2 80 ) and ( 1890 @xmath2 50 ) s. the amplitudes , which are respectively 14 and 12 mmag , are probably increased by the sky noise .",
    "it is not clear whether these two periodicities are real or not .",
    "the higher period ( 2220 s @xmath2 80 ) is not incompatible with the value found on the first night ( 2130 s @xmath2 70 ) .    in any case",
    "it is easy to verify that the data of the two successive nights are in phase , and can be very well folded over a single frequency ( fig .",
    "3 ) . in this hypothesis ,",
    "namely that the luminosity variations of hs2324 + 39 are due to a single pulsation frequency , we obtain the following best pulsation period @xmath8 :    @xmath9    the error has been estimated considering : @xmath10 the times @xmath11 of the minima are given by :    @xmath12 \\ , bjd$ ]    from fig .",
    "3 ( upper part ) the average shape of the pulse appears to be slightly asymmetric , with the descent steeper than the climb .",
    "hs2324 + 39 is a new h - rich peculiar pg1159 pulsating star .",
    "it seems to be a very interesting object for several reasons :    1 .",
    "it is , so far , the only pg1159 pulsating star with a high h abundance in its atmosphere ( he / h=0.5 by number , dwhe95 ) .",
    "this fact seems to be in contrast with the c / o pulsation mechanism proposed by starrfield et al .",
    "( 1984 ) , unless we admit that the h abundance drops to zero sharply in the driving regions . the hydrogen could be maintained in a thin surface layer by the gravitational settling .",
    "this hypothesis would imply some limits to the strength of the stellar winds and to the extension of the surface convection zone .",
    "a weak stellar wind is also suggested by the shape of the blue part of the civ components near 4650  in the spectrum of hs2324 + 39 ( dwhe95 fig .",
    "4 , leuenhagen 1995 ) .",
    "+ the edges of the theoretical gw vir instability strip obtained by starrfield et al .",
    "( 1984 ) and by stanghellini et al .",
    "( 1991 ) are calculated using the los alamos opacities .",
    "starrfield et al .",
    "( 1984 ) considered only carbon and oxygen in the surface , whereas stanghellini et al .",
    "( 1991 ) contemplated also the presence of helium .",
    "the presence of hydrogen was never considered .",
    "the most realistic models , with 50 @xmath7 carbon and 50 @xmath7 helium by mass ( stanghellini et al . 1991 ) , are pulsationally unstable at effective temperatures much lower than the real gw vir stars .",
    "more recently saio ( 1996 ) , using the opal opacities , has obtained overstable modes in models with a surface composition closer to the real gw vir stars ( y=0.38 , x@xmath13=0.4 , x@xmath14=0.2 , z=0.02 ) .",
    "a model sequence with a 3 @xmath7 ( by mass ) abundance of hydrogen was also computed ; the stability of g - modes results to be hardly affected by the existence of hydrogen . the chemical abundances obtained by werner ( 1995 ) for pg1159035 ( x@xmath40.015 , y=0.32 , x@xmath13=0.48 , x@xmath14=0.165 , taking z @xmath15 0.02 ) are quite similar to those used by saio ( 1996 ) . but for hs2324 + 39 ( x=0.20 , y=0.405 , x@xmath13=0.365 , x@xmath14=0.01 ,",
    "dwhe95 considering z=0.02 ) things are quite different : the h and o abundances , compared with pg1159035 , are in practice exchanged . nevertheless , the location of hs2324 + 39 in the @xmath0  @xmath16 diagram of saio ( 1996 , fig .",
    "5 ) is consistent with models having stellar masses between 0.58 and 0.60 @xmath17 , in good agreement with the value of 0.59 @xmath17 , obtained by dwhe95 comparing the location of hs2324 + 39 in the @xmath0 ",
    "@xmath1 plane with evolutionary tracks .",
    "the pulsation period of ( 2140 @xmath2 11 ) s is the longest ever observed in a pg1159 star .",
    "3 .   the duration of the pulsation period and the position of hs2324 + 39 in the @xmath0  @xmath1 plane ( dwhe95 ) would suggest the presence of a planetary nebula ( pn ) around the star .",
    "moreover all the other h - rich pg1159 stars are cspn .",
    "presently it seems that hs2324 + 39 does not have any pn remnant . a recent observation made at calar alto ( werner 1996 ) confirms this thesis .",
    "for all these reasons , a detailed study of the hs2324 + 39 pulsation should be undertaken . with precision asteroseismology",
    "some open questions regarding the structure and the mass of the external layers of hs2324 + 39 could be solved .",
    "the best way to achieve this purpose would be to observe hs2324 + 39 with the whole earth telescope ( nather et al .",
    ". the peculiar characteristics of hs2324 + 39 make this star very interesting and give us a possibility to improve our knowledge on the gw vir pulsation phenomenon .",
    "i am pleased to thank klaus werner , who suggested to observe this star and provided me with the finding chart .",
    "i also would like to thank gerald handler for having made available the preliminary results of his observations on hs2324 + 39 , taken at the mcdonald observatory ( texas ) , which were consistent with my results , and stefan dreizler for interesting comments about the pulsation of the pg1159 stars .",
    "thanks also to gianni tessicini and roberto gualandi for the technical support at the telescope .",
    "finally thanks to darragh odonoghue for his visit to the loiano observatory in the same period when the observations reported in this paper were carried out .",
