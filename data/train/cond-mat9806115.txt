    "the achievement of bose - einstein condensation of clouds of magnetically trapped alkali atoms @xcite by evaporation cooling to temperatures in the 100 nano - kelvin regime has revived the interest in the physics of weakly interacting bose - condensed gases . as is well - known the bulk properties of such gases are rather well described by ideal gases of quasi - particles , first derived microscopically by bogoliubov @xcite , which are collisionless phonons at long wavelength and approach free particles at short wavelength . in the case of trapped condensates of repelling atoms , to which we confine our discussion here , the quasiparticle description retains its usefulness .",
    "however , trapped condensates are spatially inhomogeneous .",
    "they form around the minima of the trapping potential and can form rather sharp surfaces .",
    "the thickness of the surface layer , given by the healing length @xcite , can become very small compared to the radius of the condensate .",
    "quasiparticles may therefore leave the condensate and reenter it after being reflected back by the trapping potential .",
    "therefore their dynamics are more complex than in a homogeneous system . in bogoliubov",
    "s approach single quasiparticles are described by wavefunctions , which are solutions of a set of linear wave equations .",
    "this is in complete analogy to the description of single particles in quantum mechanics by schrdinger s equation .",
    "we know that it is extremely fruitful to examine the classical limit of the schrdinger equation , which gives all of classical physics . in the same spirit we can examine the classical limit of the wave equations for the quasiparticles . in spatially homogeneous condensates",
    "this gives a simple theory of free quasiparticles with conserved momentum which are distinguished from free particles merely by their unusual relation between energy and momentum , and hence also between velocity and momentum .",
    "in the case of trapped inhomogeneous condensates recent work has shown @xcite that the classical limit of the dynamics of quasiparticles becomes more interesting because they experience forces both from the trap and from the condensate . in the case of isotropic traps , and",
    "hence also isotropic condensates , angular momentum conservation ensures the integrability of the quasiparticle dynamics .",
    "this can be used to construct wkb solutions of bogoliubov s wave equations for this case @xcite . in the experimentally more relevant case of axially symmetric traps integrability of the quasiparticle dynamics",
    "is lost and numerical studies @xcite indeed have shown a generally mixed phase - space in this case . detailed analytical work was performed for quasiparticle energies @xmath0 much smaller than the chemical potential @xmath1 . here",
    "two integrable limits were identified : ( i ) the phonon limit , where the phonon - like quasiparticle is confined to the interior of the condensate and is specularly reflected back when it strikes the surface , and ( ii ) a surface - particle limit , where the motion of the single - atom - like quasiparticle consists of rapid small - amplitude oscillations between the repelling main bulk of the condensate and the potential wall of the trap and a slow secular motion along the surface of the condensate .",
    "the numerical examination of the quasiparticle dynamics at larger energies ( and for the trap anisotropy of the experiment @xcite ) revealed @xcite a strong chaotic component at @xmath2 and a curious ` quasi - integrable ' regime at @xmath3 , where the dynamics in phase - space clusters around the tori corresponding to single atom motion in the trapping potential , however with small - scale chaos superimposed .    in the present paper",
    "we wish to study this large energy regime more closely , both analytically and numerically . in the spirit of chirikov",
    "pioneering work on the onset of chaos ( reviewed in @xcite ) we ask ` where are the resonances ' and answer this question by developing the first steps of the classical perturbation theory for the quasiparticle dynamics at large energy .",
    "we also examine the influence of the thickness of the surface on the appearance of chaos . in the thomas - fermi approximation @xcite this thickness",
    "is neglected , leading to a spatially discontinuous effective force on the quasiparticle .",
    "this violates assumptions of the kam theorem and turns out to be the reason that noticeable small - scale chaos survives even at very large energies , where the system should be close to the integrable limit of independent atoms in the trap .",
    "simulations with different boundary layers substantuate this hypothesis . for a condensate with boundary layer",
    "we study the transition to chaos as the energy is lowered to values comparable with the chemical potential .",
    "in the present section we give a brief derivation of the relevant equations of motion .",
    "the starting point is the gross - pitaevskii equation @xcite @xmath4 describing the macroscopic wavefunction @xmath5 of a bose condensate at temperature @xmath6 in a trap with potential @xmath7 and interaction @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the @xmath10-wave scattering length .",
    "we shall consider only the case of repulsive 2-particle interactions @xmath11 .",
    "the trap potential is taken as axially symmetric and parabolic @xmath12 the ratio between axial and radial trap frequency is @xmath13 .",
    "the particle number @xmath14 is conserved and assumed fixed .",
    "the equilibrium state of the condensate with chemical potential @xmath1 is a solution of ( [ eq:2.1 ] ) with @xmath15 which satisfies @xmath16 with vanishing axial angular momentum @xmath17 the small oscillations around the equilibrium state are waves of the form @xmath18 with @xmath19 considered as small and satisfy a linearized version of eq .",
    "( [ eq:2.1 ] ) @xmath20 usually the small oscillations are considered in second quantization ( where ( [ eq:2.6 ] ) becomes an operator equation , but retains its form ) , which brings out their particle - like properties , and they are then called quasiparticles . here",
    "we shall bring out the particle properties in a different way , by considering the ` ray - optics ' limit of eq .",
    "( [ eq:2.6 ] ) @xcite .",

    "( [ eq:2.13 ] ) with the hamiltonian ( [ eq:2.11 ] ) , ( [ eq:2.9 ] ) .",

    "the hamiltonian takes the form @xmath44 with @xmath45 in the following we shall restrict our discussion mainly to the case of vanishing axial angular momentum @xmath46 , but at the end we also present some results for @xmath47 in order to assess to what extent the case @xmath48 already captures the typical behaviour of the system .",
    "experimentally modes with @xmath46 or @xmath47 can be excited depending on the symmetry of the excitation mechanism .",
    "for @xmath46 the dynamics is restricted to a plane containing the @xmath37-axis , which can be taken as the @xmath49-plane @xmath50 , @xmath51 .",
    "the action angle variables of the unperturbed harmonic motion in the trap are @xmath52 with @xmath53 to express the perturbed hamiltonian in action - angle variables we need the fourier coefficients of the condensate density and its square @xmath54 the canonical transformation @xmath55 with @xmath56 and analogous for @xmath57 , @xmath58 removes the angle - dependence in the first order perturbation term and we are left with the second - order hamiltonian @xmath59 where @xmath60 eq .",
    "( [ eq:3.7 ] ) differs from ( [ eq:3.1 ] ) only by terms of higher than second order . for irrational @xmath13",
    "there are no resonances to zeroth order in the interaction , but in first order isolated resonances @xmath61 appear with integers @xmath62 , @xmath63 and the perturbed frequencies @xmath64 their distances in frequency space have to be compared with their widths , given by @xcite @xmath65 where @xmath66 if resonances overlap somewhere in phase space chirikov s criterion @xcite tells us that we should expect chaos there .",
    "unfortunately , eqs .",
    "( [ eq:3.7 ] ) , ( [ eq:3.8 ] ) are too difficult to evaluate analytically for a realistic equilibrium solution @xmath67 of the time - independent gross - pitaevskii equation",
    ". however , these equations are still useful to understand some qualitative features of numerical simulations of the complete hamiltonian dynamics at large energies .",
    "let us discuss in particular the case of large condensates to which the thomas - fermi approximation applies , in which the spatial derivative terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq:2.3 ] ) are neglected .",
    "the condensate density is then given by @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the heaviside step - function .",
    "as @xmath70 is an even function of @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath37 the perturbation amplitudes are nonvanishing only for even @xmath73 .",
    "therefore @xmath74 in ( [ eq:3.9a ] ) must be replaced by @xmath75 .",
    "the thomas - fermi approximation of the condensate density ( [ eq:3.10 ] ) has a discontinuous first - order derivative at the surface .",
    "this means that the fourier coefficients @xmath76 and @xmath77 at large @xmath78 , @xmath79 fall off like @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 , @xmath83 , respectively giving the @xmath84- resonances for large @xmath85 , @xmath86 widths , which according to eq .",

    "a condensate density with @xmath91 smooth derivatives and a discontinuous @xmath92 order derivative will give rise to resonance widths scaling like @xmath93 , @xmath94 and tori with large @xmath85 , @xmath86 can exist if @xmath95 .",
    "the critical order of smoothness for general hamiltonian systems with @xmath96 degrees of freedom was determined by chirikov @xcite as @xmath97 .    in fig .  1 a poincar surface of section of the dynamics at @xmath98 , @xmath46 , taken at @xmath99 and plotted in the @xmath100-plane",
    "is shown for the experimentally realized @xcite value @xmath101 .",
    "the action variable @xmath57 is plotted in units of @xmath102 . with the exception of tori at small @xmath57 and at large @xmath103 all tori in fig .",
    "1 are broken .",
    "the survival of the exceptional unbroken tori can be understood from the fact that for @xmath104 or @xmath105 ( with @xmath106 ) all the coefficients @xmath107 approach @xmath108 with the exception of @xmath109 or @xmath110 , repectively , which can not influence appreciably tori with frequency ratios @xmath111 .    in fig .",
    "1 a number of resonances with frequency ratios in the neighborhood of @xmath112 can be discerned .",
    "their frequency ratios are given on the right hand side of the graph .",

    "1 the action @xmath118 is small , while @xmath119 is large . the heaviside function in eqs .  ( [ eq:3.13 ] ) therefore restricts @xmath120 to small values of the order of @xmath121 while @xmath122 is not so restricted",
    ". therefore @xmath123 near the bottom of fig .  1 and @xmath124 holds there . in the upper parts of fig .  1",
    "@xmath125 is small while @xmath126 .",
    "the situation is therefore reversed and we obtain @xmath127 by the same argument .    the periodic orbit @xmath128 , @xmath129 which has @xmath130 forms the lower border of the range of @xmath118 .",
    "for this case the frequency shifts @xmath131 , @xmath132 are easily evaluated from eq .",

    "the arguments of the previous paragraph indicate , furthermore , that @xmath134 is minimal for this case , while @xmath135 is maximal , leading to a maximal value of the ratio @xmath136 where we used @xmath137 with @xmath130 in the last estimate . for @xmath138",
    "this gives @xmath139 , which is just barely larger than the ratio 0.4 of the 2:5 resonance visible near the lower border of fig .",
    "similar arguments apply to the upper border of the range of @xmath118 which is formed by the periodic orbit @xmath99 , @xmath140 with vanishing @xmath125 for which @xmath141 thus @xmath142 for @xmath138 this yields @xmath143 which is smaller than the ratio 0.333 of the 1:3 resonance visible near the upper border of fig .  1 .",
    "in general we can conclude that for fixed energy @xmath0 we should expect to see the strongest resonances in the interval @xmath144 which are , for @xmath101 , @xmath138 , the resonances 1:3 , 2:5 , 3:8 , 4:11 , 5:14 , 6:17 and are indeed all seen in fig .  1 with the exception of the 5:14 resonance . in its place a chaotic region",
    "the resonance values of the actions following from the perturbation theory are indicated on the right - hand side of fig.1 .",
    "the 4:11 resonance predicted close to the missing 5:14 resonance is nearly completely destroyed and barely separated from the chaotic region replacing the 5:14 resonance .",
    "let us now consider the effect of the sharpness of the boundary layer of the condensate .",
    "its thickness is given by the healing length @xcite @xmath145 it enters as an independent parameter whose ratio to the radial thomas - fermi radius @xmath146 is determined by the value of the chemical potential , i.e. by the number of particles in the trap , @xmath147 . as example we consider @xmath148 .",
    "the condensate with boundary layer is modelled by joining @xmath149 continuously with continuous three derivatives at @xmath150 , thereby fixing @xmath151 . here",
    "the abreviation @xmath152 is used .",
    "the degree of smoothness thereby introduced should be sufficient to see smooth kam tori .",
    "the model condensate ( [ eq:3.21 ] ) is of course not a solution of the gross - pitaevskii equation , but does not differ qualitatively from solutions taking into account the boundary layer @xcite . for our present purposes",
    "it is therefore perfectly acceptable while avoiding unnecessary complications . in fig .",
    "2 we compare poincar surface of sections in the same format as in fig.1 for the thomas - fermi approximation and the smooth model condensate with @xmath153 at energy @xmath154 and @xmath101 .",
    "it can be seen that with the smooth boundary layer included most of the broken tori of the thomas - fermi condensate seen in the upper part of fig.2 become smooth , as seen in the lower part of fig.2 , however with ripples on the tori still indicating the presence of the narrow boundary layer .",
    "if the boundary layer is narrowed further ( not shown ) these ripples become stronger and develop sharp cusps . the chaotic band at small actions @xmath155 survives even for very large quasiparticle energies @xmath156 .",
    "resonances within this band have a comparatively large width for two reasons . for one",
    "the factors @xmath157 are large , because @xmath155 is not far above the value @xmath158 where @xmath159 peaks ( with a logarithmic singularity in thomas - fermi approximation ) . for larger values of @xmath155 , of the order of @xmath160 , like for the 6:17 resonance or values of @xmath161 close to @xmath13 , @xmath157 is much smaller by a factor of the order of @xmath162 .",
    "second , the interaction coefficient @xmath90 has a resonantly enhanced contribution @xmath163 .",
    "the last factor in this expression favors resonances @xmath161 close to the ratio @xmath13 .",
    "the existence of the narrow boundary layer of the condensate furthermore leads to appreciable interaction coefficients @xmath90 even for comparatively high - order resonances whose overlap may be responsible for the formation of the chaotic band .",
    "the requirement that _ both _",
    "factors @xmath159 and @xmath164 must be large may explain the appearance of a band of actions @xmath155 with appreciable resonance overlap somewhat above the value @xmath158 .",
    "dynamically the chaotic band is related to orbits in a layer of actions @xmath165 which are just sufficient for the quasiparticle to hit or miss the condensate at random as it oscillates back and forth in x - direction .",
    "this mechanism is able to introduce sensitive dependence on initial conditions and exists , if only in a narrow band , even at very large energies . for just slightly smaller actions",
    "@xmath155 the quasiparticle has to pass the condensate twice in each period of @xmath166 and the tori are smooth even in thomas - fermi approximation , as can be seen in fig .  1 for @xmath138 . a similar mechanism for a chaotic band should actually exist also for the oscillations in the z - direction , the short axis of the condensate - ellipsoid",
    ". however the instabilty in this case for action @xmath167 seems to be much less pronounced ( which is plausible , because the perturbation by the condensate should be weaker along the short axis ) and is not visible in the numerical data .",
    "finally we consider numerically the transition to chaos in the condensate with boundary layer @xmath153 as the quasiparticle energy is lowered . in fig.3 the same poincar surface of section",
    "is plotted as in figs.1,2 ( and again for @xmath101 ) but in the @xmath168-plane rather than the @xmath169-plane .",
    "the two plots in the upper row are for @xmath154 and @xmath138 , those in the lower row are for @xmath170 and @xmath171 respectively .",
    "the plots for @xmath172 and @xmath173 can be compared with fig.2 and fig.1 respectively , but fig.1 is , of course for vanishing @xmath174 only .",
    "the slightly rounded thomas - fermi surface at @xmath175 is visible in these graphs .",
    "based on these and similar plots the transition to chaos can now be roughly described as follows : the chaotic band in a layer of small actions @xmath176 existing even at very large energies ( see the plot for @xmath154 ) becomes wider as the energy is lowered ( see @xmath138 ) .",
    "then , at a critical energy @xmath177 which we discuss further below , the periodic orbit along the long axis of the condensate - ellipsoid becomes unstable and a second chaotic region in phase - space surrounding the unstable orbit @xmath178 is created .",
    "the inner and outer chaotic regions then rapidly grow together as the energy is lowered further ( see @xmath179 ) and finally fill up most of the accessible regions of phase - space ( see the last plot with @xmath180 ) .",
    "apart from a continuous widening of the chaotic regions the main event in this transition to chaos is the appearance of the instabilty of the periodic orbit along the long axis of the condensate - ellipsoid , which for @xmath181 is the @xmath71-axis . in thomas - fermi approximation",
    "this orbit has the time - dependence for @xmath182 @xmath183 and for @xmath184 @xmath185 with @xmath186 and @xmath187 suitably adjusted by continuity at @xmath188 . to determine the energy where this orbit looses its stability we can perform a linear stability analysis for small perturbations @xmath37 ,",
    "@xmath189 away from this orbit , which satisfy @xmath190 the growth of a perturbation of the periodic orbit is determined by the monodromy matrix * m * for a half - period @xmath191 @xmath192 the hamiltonian form of the dynamics ensures that @xmath193 .",
    "the stability condition for the perturbations in @xmath37-direction then becomes @xmath194 with a little algebra it is straight - forward to evaluate * m * and its trace thereby reducing ( [ eq:3.26 ] ) to @xmath195 here @xmath196 and @xmath197 are the total lengths of the time - intervals during each half - period where @xmath182 and @xmath184 , respectively .",
    "they are given by @xmath198 for @xmath101 stability is lost , according to the criterion ( [ eq:3.27 ] ) for @xmath199 which is in reasonable agreement with the already quoted value @xmath177 determined from the numerical simulation of the complete quasiparticle dynamics .",
    "in the present paper we have studied the classical limit of the dynamics of the quasiparticles in a spatially inhomogeneous harmonically trapped weakly interacting bose gas . as is well known many properties of a bose gas are determined by its quasiparticles . for sufficiently large energies",
    "@xmath200 a classical description of quasiparticles should be possible .",
    "we have accordingly concentrated our attention on the large energy regime . for quasiparticle energies large",
    "compared to the chemical potential a perturbative expansion becomes possible .",
    "the dynamics then looks like that of an anisotropic harmonically bound particle which is perturbed by the presence of a weakly repelling condensate localized around the center of the trap with a rather sharp surface .",
    "the appearance of an infinitely sharp surface in the thomas - fermi approximation leads to the break - up of all tori with the exception of those in the immediate phase - space neighborhood of the periodic orbits along the main axes of the ellipsoidal condensate .",
    "therefore in this case chaos exists in phase - space for arbitrarily large energies @xmath156 .",
    "still resonances can be identified even in this case and their actions are well described by perturbation theory .",
    "we have compared this non - smooth case to that of a condensate with a smooth ( up to third derivatives ) but narrow boundary layer . in real condensates",
    "the thickness of the boundary layer is determined by the two - particle interaction and the number of particles @xcite . in that case",
    "smooth kam tori exist at sufficiently large energies , but they are rippled by the influence of the boundary layer .",
    "furthermore it turns out that an appreciable region of chaos in phase - space persists even to large energies .",
    "it is related to orbits along the long axis of the condensate - ellipsoid which are sufficiently perturbed in the direction of the short axis to sometimes miss and sometimes hit the condensate in a random way with sensitive dependence on small perturbations .",
    "finally we have studied how large scale chaos appears as the energy is gradually lowered to values of the order of the chemical potential .",
    "the instability of the periodic orbit along the long axis of the ellipsoid was found to play a major role in this transition .",
    "it is connected with the appearance of a second inner chaotic region at lower energies which joins up with the chaotic band existing also at large energies .",
    "our discussion so far has been restricted to the special case @xmath48 , where the classical quasiparticle dynamics is confined to a plane in configuration space containing the z - axis .",
    "one may well ask to what extent this motion already captures the typical behavior of the system . to examine this question at least",
    "numerically we have generated poincar surface of sections for @xmath201 both for fixed @xmath0 and varying @xmath33 or for fixed @xmath33 and varying @xmath0 .",
    "the surfaces of section are always taken at the value @xmath202 where the effective potential in radial direction , which includes the centrifugal barrier , has its minimum .",
    "in fig.4 we present a series of poincar surfaces of sections for @xmath33 fixed at a rather high value ( in units of @xmath22 ) @xmath203 and the same values of @xmath0 and also the same thickness of the boundary layer as in fig.3 .",
    "it is apparent that taking @xmath47 the mirror symmetry with respect to the z - axis and the @xmath189-axis which is present at @xmath46 is lost and replaced by a point symmetry with respect to the origin @xmath204 , which is , of course , to be expected .",
    "however , apart from this obvious difference the qualitative behavior displayed in fig.4 is the same as in fig.3 .",
    "as was shown in @xcite the energy and the angular momentum must satisfy the inequalities @xmath205 for @xmath206 and @xmath207 there exists a domain @xmath208 where the motion of the quasiparticles occurs outside the condensate in the thomas - fermi limit , and is therefore integrable .",
    "thus an additional transition from nonintegrable to integrable dynamics occurs for very high angular momentum @xmath209 as the energy is lowered from above to below @xmath210 .",
    "let us finally turn to the quantum mechanical implications of the classical dynamics we have studied .",
    "such implications exist both for the wavefunctions and the energies of single quasiparticle states which are of course closely connected .",
    "as the classical analysis is done in phase space it is most convenient for a discussion to use the husimi distribution @xmath211 where @xmath212 is a coherent state of the harmonic oscillators defined by the free trap . for each quantum state",
    "@xmath213 the function @xmath214 is a positive quasiprobability on the phase space , which due to the overcompleteness of the @xmath212 , contains the full information on @xmath213 .",
    "let us now turn to the poincar surface of sections displayed in fig.3 and discuss the corresponding quantum states via their @xmath214-functions : in fig.3a the @xmath214-functions at @xmath215 will be spread out along the tori with ( in the limit @xmath216 ) narrow peaks on the tori .",
    "the number of such states is semiclassically given by the phase space volume of the energy shell of thickness @xmath217 in units @xmath218 .",
    "the chaotic layer visible in fig.3a may correspond to several quantum states ( depending on the contribution of this layer to the phase space volume of the energy shell in units @xmath218 ) which are all spread out along the layer but with wave functions oscillating wildly in the corresponding configuration space so as to satisfy the orthogonality condition .",
    "if indeed several such states exist in an energy shell of thickness @xmath217 their energies will tend to repell each other .",
    "the energies corresponding to @xmath214-functions centered on tori will show no such repulsion .",
    "essentially the same discussion applies to fig.3b , 3c where the chaotic layer occupies a larger fraction of the phase - space volume and finally merges into a single domain . in the case of fig.3d , where essentially a single chaotic domain survives two different types of quantum states are possible : the first possibility is that the quantum states are all spread out over the chaotic domain with strong oscillations of their wave functions in the corresponding domain of configuration space to satisfy orthogonality and accompanying strong level repulsion",
    "the second possibility is that the quantum states show dynamical localization with respect to the action variable @xmath155 . in this case",
    "the quantum states still localize around different values of @xmath155 due to a coherent interference effect akin to anderson localization . in this case",
    "the wave functions can be orthogonal without energy level repulsion . which of these two possibilities is realized depends on the strength of the chaotic change of the action variable @xmath155 .",
    "if this change is sufficiently large , then the first possibility ( extended states with level repulsion ) will be realized . if however @xmath155 changes sufficiently weakly in a diffusive way such that its variance satisfies @xmath219 with a diffusion constant d , then the second possibility may be realized",
    ". then a fundamental estimate @xcite can be made of the localization length @xmath220 of @xmath155 according to @xmath221 where @xmath222 is the density of states at energy @xmath0 .",
    "dynamical localization then is predicted to occur as soon as @xmath223 where @xmath224 gives the width of the chaotic domain in @xmath155 .",

    "either analytically or numerically , so the question which of the two behaviors will occur in a given trap at energies @xmath227 must be left open here .",
    "numerical computations of quasiparticle energies have been performed for certain trap parameters and avoided crossings have been seen in the results for the regime @xmath228 ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , but a systematic study of the level statistics has not yet been performed for this case .",
    "however , the level repulsion typical for classically chaotic systems has already been built into a quantum theory of damping of the low - energy collective modes due to scattering of thermally excited quasiparticles at energies of the order of the chemical potential @xcite .",
    "this should only be a beginning .",
    "if the precedence of mesoscopic systems is any hint , we may expect that more properties of trapped bose condensates will turn out to be infiltrated by chaos in the future .",
    "the present work is an outgrowth of earlier work @xcite done in collaboration with andrs csords and pter szpfalusy to whom we are gratefull for sharing their insights .",
    "this work has been supported by the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft through the sonderforschungsbereich 237 `` unordnung und groe fluktuationen '' .",
