    "the study of black holes has been driven to the forefront of extragalactic research by the recent discovery of black holes as massive as a billion suns inside nearby bulge galaxies .",
    "simple physical arguments ( e.g. , silk & rees 1998 ) suggest that these enormous objects should profoundly affect the process of galaxy formation , a belief that is strengthened by the tight observed correlation between the masses of local galaxies and their black holes  ( gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 ; ferrarese & merritt 2000 ) . various theoretical models",
    "attempt to explain the existence of the correlation with a wide range of physical processes .",
    "since these models make discordant predictions for the evolution of the correlation over time , we decided to test them by measuring the relationship between galaxy and black hole mass in the distant past , at redshifts @xmath3 .    a novel approach ( see , e.g. ,",
    "kauffmann & haehnelt 2002 ) let us use our existing surveys ( steidel et al .",
    "2003 ; steidel et al .",
    "2004 ) of @xmath4 galaxies at redshifts @xmath5 to measure the dependence of galaxy mass @xmath6 on black hole mass @xmath7 over a 5-decade baseline of black hole mass , reaching masses roughly 1000 times smaller than the limits of other surveys ( e.g. , shields et al . 2003 ; walter et al .",
    "2004 ; croom et al .",
    "2005 ) at similar redshifts .",
    "after using the technique of vestergaard ( 2002 ) to estimate the masses of the black holes that powered each of the 79 active - galactic nuclei ( agn ) in our survey ( see figure  [ fig : check_mbh ] and the appendix ) , we estimated the typical halo mass for black holes in different mass ranges by measuring how strongly the other galaxies in our survey clustered around them .",
    "adelberger & steidel ( 2005 ) describe our analysis in more detail .",
    "briefly , we estimated the cross - correlation length @xmath8 from the number of galaxy - agn pairs with angular separation @xmath9 and comoving radial separation @xmath10 mpc with the approach of adelberger ( 2005 ) , then used the gif - lcdm numerical simulation ( kauffmann et al .",
    "1999 ) of structure formation in a standard cosmological model to estimate from @xmath8 the total ( dark matter plus baryon ) mean mass @xmath6 of the galaxies associated with black holes in each mass range .",
    "the relationship between @xmath8 and @xmath6 depends on the redshift and on the mass of the typical ( non - active ) galaxies in our survey , but the resulting systematic errors in @xmath6 are small compared to the random errors ( figure  [ fig : r0_vs_mass ] ) .",
    "we found galaxy - agn cross - correlation lengths of @xmath11 for the @xmath12 agn with @xmath13 and @xmath14 for the @xmath15 with @xmath16 .",
    "the inferred relationship between @xmath17 and @xmath18 is shown in figure  [ fig : emh_vs_mbh ] .",
    "if the predicted relationship between galaxy and black - hole mass has the form @xmath19 , with @xmath20 a function to be specified and @xmath21 a random deviate , the expectation value of @xmath22 for a given value of @xmath17 follows from the elementary relationship @xmath23 where @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 is the distribution of @xmath22 measured in the gif - lcdm simulation and extrapolated with the appropriate press - schechter ( 1974 ) formula , and @xmath27 is the distribution of @xmath17 at fixed galaxy mass , which depends on @xmath20 and on the characteristics of the random variable @xmath21 . solving equation  [ eq : elhgivenlbh ] numerically for different functions @xmath20 under the assumption that @xmath21 has a normal distribution with rms @xmath28",
    ", we find the theoretical tracks shown in figure  [ fig : emh_vs_mbh ] .",
    "the solid blue line is for a @xmath7@xmath6 relationship identical to the one observed locally , @xmath29 ( ferrarese 2002 ) .",
    "for this line we assumed @xmath30 , roughly the expected error in our black hole masses ( vestergaard 2002 ) .",
    "the line therefore assumes negligible intrinsic scatter in the correlation .",
    "it fits the data well .",
    "the other lines show that alternative relationships in the literature generally provide a worse fit .",
    "the green line results from scaling the ratio of black hole to galaxy mass by @xmath31 , as advocated by many semi - analytic models ( e.g. , haehnelt , natarajan , & rees 1998 ; wyithe & loeb 2002 ; volonteri , haardt , & madau 2003 ) .",
    "the red line shows the redshift @xmath32 prediction @xmath33 of a model in which black holes accrete a fixed fraction of the total gas mass in each merger ( di matteo et al .",
    "the dashed blue line assumes that the mean @xmath7@xmath6 relationship is the same as observed locally but that its intrinsic scatter has increased to @xmath34 dex .",
    "increasing the scatter decreases the typical mass of galaxies that contain black holes of a given mass .",
    "this is because galaxies with low masses are much more common than galaxies with high masses ; when the scatter in the @xmath7@xmath6 relationship is big , the largest black holes are more likely to reside in low mass galaxies with unusual ratios of @xmath35 than in high mass galaxies with normal ratios .",
    "the clustering of galaxies around agn would therefore be far weaker than we observe if there were no relationship at all between @xmath7 and @xmath6 .",
    "a @xmath36 test suggests that the three alternatives to the no - evolution model ( @xmath31 scaling , supply limited accretion , large @xmath28 ) disagree with the observations at the 9095% level .",
    "they can therefore be considered marginally consistent with our present data , although the odds are against them and more extreme evolution from the local relationship ( e.g. , haehnelt & rees 1993 ) can be ruled out with high significance .",
    "the apparent lack of evolution in the @xmath7@xmath6 correlation seems consistent with models in which the correlation results from active feedback from the black hole . in these models the black hole mass",
    "is pinned near the maximum allowed by its halo at all times .",
    "if this maximum is set by the escape velocity at a fixed proper radius from the black hole , it will not depend strongly on redshift .",
    "one might object that black holes are able to enter the quasar phase in these models only because their masses have temporarily fallen below the maximum allowed by their growing halos , and so the most luminous agn should never lie on the correlation .",
    "as long as the quasar phase occurs near the end of the accretion , however ( e.g. , hopkins et al .",
    "2005 ) , the black hole should have nearly achieved its equilibrium mass . in any case , a slight decrease in @xmath7 at fixed @xmath6 would make the predictions fit our data even better .",
    "it is a pleasure to acknowledge several interesting conversations with l. ho , l. hernquist , l. ferrarese , j. kollmeier , and s. white .",
    "this work would not have been possible without the efforts of our collaborators d. erb , m. pettini , n. reddy , & a. shapley .",
    "bob becker , richard white , and michael gregg generously shared their spectrum of fbqs0933 + 2845 .",
    "kla was supported by a fellowship from the carnegie institute of washington ; ccs was supported by grant ast 03 - 07263 from the national science foundation and by a grant from the packard foundation .",
    "we are grateful that the people of hawaii allow astronomers to build and operate telescopes on the summit of mauna kea .",
    "the general population of galaxies tends to cluster more strongly around individual galaxies with larger masses .",
    "we exploit this effect to estimate the masses of the galaxies that harbor black holes . after estimating the characteristic mass @xmath37 of the general galaxy population from its measured correlation length ( adelberger et al .",
    "2005 ) , we use the gif - lcdm simulation to calculate as a function of @xmath6 how strongly galaxies of mass @xmath38 cluster around galaxies of mass @xmath39 .",
    "we infer the masses of the galaxies that harbor various black holes by finding the value of @xmath6 required to match the observed cross - correlation length @xmath8 .",
    "figure  [ fig : r0_vs_mass ] shows the relationship we used to estimate from our measured cross - correlation length @xmath8 the typical mass of the galaxies containing the black holes ( green points ) . adopting other plausible relationships between @xmath8 and @xmath6 would change the inferred masses by less than their random uncertainties .",
    "percival et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and kauffmann & haehnelt ( 2002 ) have shown that halos undergoing mergers have the same correlation length on large scales as other halos of the same mass , so our estimates of @xmath8 should provide reasonable estimates of the halos masses even if agn are fueled by mergers .    to estimate the random uncertainty in @xmath8 , we took a monte - carlo approach that exploited the similarity of the agn - galaxy cross - correlation length to the galaxy - galaxy correlation length .",
    "we generated many alternate realizations of our data by treating randomly chosen galaxies in each field as that field s agn , rather than the true agn themselves , and recalculated @xmath8 for each simulated sample .",
    "since the galaxies in our survey outnumber the agn by more than twenty to one , the simulated samples are nearly independent of each other and of the true sample .",
    "we took the rms spread in @xmath8 among them as the @xmath40 uncertainty in our measured measured correlation length @xmath41 .",
    "the distribution of @xmath42 ^ 2 $ ] for the predicted values of @xmath8 in figure  [ fig : emh_vs_mbh ] should be roughly equal to the distribution of @xmath36 in the simulated samples around the line @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the galaxy - galaxy correlation length in our sample .",
    "we used this distribution to associate our measured values of @xmath36 with a @xmath45-value .",
    "our conclusion depends on the assumption that the estimated black hole masses @xmath7 are not wildly inaccurate .",
    "we estimate @xmath7 from an agn s luminosity @xmath46 at @xmath47  and civ line - width @xmath48 with the relationship that is observed in the local universe : @xmath49 ( vestergaard 2002 ) . correcting for a stellar contribution to the agns luminosities ( which we have not done ) would decrease our lowest observed values @xmath7 even further , strengthening our conclusions .",
    "our estimated black - hole masses would be too low for some agn with small @xmath7 if their observed civ emission line were produced in the narrow - line region rather than the broad - line region ( as we assume ) . in this case",
    "the line widths would be roughly equal to the galaxies stellar velocity dispersions ( nelson 2000 ) , at least for radio - quiet agn , but in fact the galaxies mean stellar velocity width ( @xmath50 km s@xmath51 ) is an order of magnitude smaller than the mean agn line - width for @xmath52 ( @xmath53 km s@xmath51 ) or @xmath54 ( @xmath55 km s@xmath51 ) .",
    "it is far smaller than even the smallest observed agn line - width in our sample , @xmath56 km s@xmath51 .",
    "radio - loud agn make up too small a fraction of our sample to affect our results if omitted . in any case",
    ", the observed range of @xmath7 is so large that our estimates of @xmath7 would have to be wrong by @xmath57 order of magnitude to alter our results significantly .",
    "we can not rule out the idea that the relationship between @xmath7 , luminosity , and line - width was utterly different in the past , but it seems easier to believe that the relationship between @xmath7 and @xmath6 has not changed at all .",
