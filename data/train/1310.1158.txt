    "the quantum mechanical description of electrons in solids  the band theory  @xcite offered a straightforward account for distinctions between insulators and metals .",
    "fermi liquid theory  @xcite has elucidated why interactions between 10@xmath3  @xmath4 electrons in simple metals can be readily neglected , thus validating inferences of free electron models .",
    "it came as a considerable surprise in late 30s when crystals with incomplete @xmath5 bands were found insulating  @xcite .",
    "the term `` mott insulator '' was later coined to identify a class of solids violating the above fundamental expectations of band theory  @xcite . peierls and",
    "mott stated  @xcite that `` a rather drastic modification of the present electron theory of metals would be necessary in order to take these facts into account '' and proposed that such a modification must include coulomb interactions between the electrons .",
    "study of correlations in solids , which are responsible for such a dramatic increase of resistivity in mott insulators , remains in the forefront of contemporary condensed matter physics  @xcite , and it was later found in many other materials , such as @xmath5 and @xmath6-electron inter - metallic compounds , as well as a number of @xmath7-electron organic conductors .",
    "the theory became predictive with the invention of the density functional theory ( dft )  @xcite . within the kohn - sham framework ,",
    "the computation of the density of the solid is reduced to a tractable problem of non - interacting electrons moving in an effective potential .",
    "the implementation of dft within the local density approximation ( lda ) and generalized gradient approximations ( gga ) in 1970s , and the increase in computational power in the past decades made it possible to predict materials properties _",
    "ab initio_. in weakly correlated materials the computed kohn - sham spectra is a reasonable description of the electronic spectra .",
    "however , materials with strong correlations , and in particular mott insulators , are not properly treated within these approximations .",
    "it s long been recognized that electron correlations are mostly local in space  two widely separated electrons are unlikely to be significantly correlated . within lda ,",
    "the kohn - sham potential in each point of space depends solely on the density at the same point , hence lda is local for each point in 3d - space .",
    "however , in solids with partially filled @xmath5-bands , the correlations are very strong between two electrons on the same transition metal ion , which is beyond the scope of lda .    in 1990s the dynamical mean field theory ( dmft )  @xcite was developed .",
    "this theory introduces non - locality in time , which is essential for description of paramagnetic mott insulators .",
    "this theory is also a local theory , but it is local to a given site rather than a point in space .",
    "dmft successfully predicted the mott - transition in the hubbard model  @xcite , as well as many other known features of correlated systems , such as the dynamical spectral weight transfer  @xcite , the existence of a mott end - point , and the value of the critical exponents at this mott end - point  @xcite .",
    "the cluster - dmft studies  @xcite show that this properties are genuine to the frustrated hubbard model .    within dmft ,",
    "the functional that contains all local correlations is known exactly , and can be calculated by solving an appropriate quantum impurity model , but the computational cost when including many interacting degrees of freedom on a given site increases exponentially , while the hybridization with non - interacting states does not increase the computational cost significantly . at present , modern computers allow us to treat interactions exactly within a complete @xmath5 shell of a transition metal ion or a complete @xmath6 shell in an inter - metallic compound , while the rest of the states must be treated by a mean - field method .",
    "the most popular choice of such a mean - field method is dft , hence the combination of the two methods , first proposed in 1997  @xcite , was named lda+dmft",
    "the method became very successful as it could predict properties of an extraordinary number of correlated materials previously resisting detailed material specific predictions ( for a review see  ) . the electronic structure and unusual physical properties of many actinides  @xcite , lanthanides  @xcite , @xmath8  @xcite , @xmath9  @xcite and @xmath10  @xcite transition metal compounds were explained using this approach .    in the early 2000s , the lda+dmft method was usually referring to the dynamical mean field calculation of a lattice model , namely the hubbard model , where the hopping parameters were derived by a so - called downfolding procedure : the bands near the fermi level were represented in terms of a small number of wannier states@xcite , and the resulting hubbard model was solved by the dmft method .",
    "the feedback of correlations to the electronic charge distribution , and hence the kohn - sham potential , was often neglected .",
    "also , usually the minimum number of wannier states were kept in the model , which made such model calculations conceptually simple , but less predictive , as the coulomb repulsion for a low energy model is strongly screened by the degrees of freedom eliminated from the model , hence a material specific and model specific calculation of the interaction strength @xmath11 was needed to make this method predictive .",
    "the constrained - rpa  @xcite was invented for that purpose , and was quite successful when the correlations are applied in the narrow energy window .",
    "an alternative route , which avoids construction of the low - energy model , was proposed by savrasov & kotliar  @xcite , in which the correction ( self - energy ) due to the correlations is added to the kohn - sham potential in a very limited region of the real space , such as the muffin - thin ( mt ) sphere of the correlated ion . in this approach ,",
    "all degrees of freedom local to an ion are treated exactly , while the non - local correlations are treated in a mean - field way by dft .",
    "no valence state is eliminated from the model !",
    "kohn - sham potential is computed on the self - consistent electronic charge .",
    "we call this methodology the all - electron method",
    ". the early implementation of this approach , together with electronic charge self - consistency , successfully predicted the phonon spectra of elemental plutonium  @xcite , but the impurity solvers at that time were not adequate to address many other challenging problems in correlated solids .",
    "the dft+dmft method has rapidly matured over the last few years , as several charge self - consistent implementations in various electronic structure codes appeared  @xcite , some with integrated state of the art impurity solvers  @xcite .",
    "the most significant difference between the earlier and more modern implementations of the method is the degree of localization of the electronic orbitals , which interact with strong coulomb interaction . in the early days , a set of wannier orbitals spanning a narrow window around the fermi level",
    "was typically treated by the dmft . since the non - local interactions and",
    "the non - local correlations are neglected in the dmft approach , one expects that a more localized choice of orbitals leads to better results within single - site dmft approximation .",
    "hence newer implementations applied correlations to more localized states , and kept a larger number of itinerant states in the model . a real space projector to the spherical harmonics within a mt - sphere around the correlated ion @xmath12 ( where @xmath13 is nonzero when @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) is a good example of extremely localized orbitals , which hybridizes with a large number of kohn - sham states , spanning a large energy window in band representation .",
    "such a set of real - space orbitals is clearly more localized than the popular choice of maximally localized wannier orbitals@xcite , which are constrained to faithfully represent some set of low energy bands .",
    "numerous successful predictions of this all - electron dft+dmft were published in the past decade nevertheless , its predictive power for transition metal oxides was questioned recently in refs .  .",
    "namely , using wannier functions for oxygen-@xmath16 states and transition metal @xmath5 states , the authors of refs .   concluded that fine tuning of several parameters , including the double - counting and the interaction @xmath11 is needed to describe the mott insulating state in early and late transiton metal oxides .",
    "moreover , the @xmath17 model requires occupancy of the @xmath5 orbitals to be close to unity for the mott state , while dft solution projected to the orbitals of their choice , predicts far larger occupancies , hence this discrepancy between dft occupancies and the dmft requirements lead them to suggest that the self - consistent dft+dmft can not describe the mott insulating state without fine tuning the interaction @xmath11 to be in the narrow range of @xmath18ev and ad - hoc fine tuning of the double - counting to reproduce the experimentally observed @xmath17 splittings .",
    "this calls for a critical reexamination of the application of the lda+dmft to the 3@xmath5 series .",
    "our methodology  @xcite was tested in numerous classes of materials , such as actinides  @xcite , lanthanides  @xcite , transition metal oxides  @xcite , iron superconductors  @xcite , and other transition metal compounds  @xcite .",
    "however , results for early and late transition metal oxides with our methodology are not available in literature .",
    "it is therefore important to test our methodology in this class of materials , which have mostly been studied using downfolded lda+dmft implementations .",
    "in this work we perform dft+dmft calculations for a series of early transition metal oxides : srvo@xmath0 , lavo@xmath0 , latio@xmath0 , and a cuprate parent compound la@xmath1cuo@xmath2 ; all the test cases which required fine tuning in refs .  .",
    "we show that no fine tuning or adjustable parameter is required in dft+dmft implementation of ref .  , and for a fixed value of on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath19ev mott gaps in all these compounds are in reasonable agreement with experiment .    the all - electron dft+dmft implementation  @xcite extremizes the following functional  @xcite    @xmath20= -{\\mathrm{tr}}\\ln\\left ( ( i\\omega+\\mu+\\nabla^2-v_{ks})\\delta({{\\mathbf{r}}}-{{\\mathbf{r}}}')-\\sum_{\\tau ll'}p({{\\mathbf{r}}}{{\\mathbf{r}}}',\\tau ll')(\\sigma - v_{dc})_{l'l } \\right)\\\\ -\\int [ v_{ks}-v_{ext}]\\rho d^3r -{\\mathrm{tr}}\\left(\\sigma g_{loc}\\right ) + { \\mathrm{tr}}(v_{dc } n_d)+ \\phi_h[\\rho]+\\phi_{xc}[\\rho]+\\phi_{dmft}[g_{loc}]-\\phi_{dc}[n_d]\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    of three pairs of conjugate variables .",

    "the local coulomb repulsion @xmath30 is parametrized with the slater parametrization with @xmath31ev , and , if not otherwise stated , @xmath19ev .",

    "@xmath32 is the external potential , containing the material specific information .",
    "@xmath33 is the projector to the local correlated orbital at atom @xmath34 with angular momentum indices @xmath35,@xmath36 .",
    "we use projector @xmath37 introduced in ref .   with an energy window of @xmath3820@xmath39 around the fermi level . for the maximal locality of correlated states ,",
    "this projector is implemented in real space and is nonzero only within the mt - sphere of the correlated ion . in section  [ comparison ]",
    "we test several different projectors , ranging from extremely localized to moderately delocalized , to understand the controversy in the literature regarding the dft+dmft results for the transition metal oxides .",
    "the vanadium and titanium @xmath40 states are treated dynamically , while the empty @xmath41 states are treated by a static mean field . the copper ion with its almost full shell requires dynamic treatment of all five @xmath8 orbitals .",
    "for the double - counting correction , we used two methodologies : a ) the fully - localized - limit ( fll ) formula introduced in ref .",
    "is used in section  [ comparison ] to ensure that the results are robust and that the simplification used elsewhere does not change the results appreciably from this standard prescription .",
    "b ) the method explained in ref .",
    "is used in most of this paper , where @xmath42= n_d v_{dc}$ ] and @xmath25 is also parameterized by the standard fully - localized - limit formula  @xcite @xmath43 , and @xmath44 is taken to be the nominal occupancy of the correlated ion .",
    "we name this method fixed - dc .",
    "in particular , for srvo@xmath0 with v@xmath45 ion we take @xmath46 , for lavo@xmath0 with v@xmath47 ion @xmath48 , for latio@xmath0 with ti@xmath47 ion @xmath46 and for la@xmath1cuo@xmath2 with cu@xmath49 ion @xmath50 .",
    "this double - counting scheme has two virtues : i ) it is numerically much more stable in the charge - self - consistent dft+dmft , as the noise from monte - carlo does not feed - back into impurity levels , and into large hartree shifts .",
    "ii ) the results are more robust with respect to small changes in projector , linearization energies , etc",
    ". both double - countings are equally justifiable on the phenomenological level .",
    "the determination of the exact double - counting is an open problem , but see recent progress in ref .  .",
    "the double - counting b ) ensures that at infinite @xmath11 one recovers atomic physics at the nominal valence . for discussion",
    "s sake , let us set @xmath51 to zero . in the absence of any double - counting correction ,",
    "the lower hubbard band in the atomic limit is positioned at @xmath52 , and the upper hubbard band at @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the center of the correlated state at @xmath55 ( in dft calculation ) .",
    "the center between the hubbard bands is at @xmath56 . to ensure that in the large @xmath11 limit the center of the correlated states does not move from its dft position , and that we recover the correct nominal occupancy",
    ", we must subtract from the dynamic self - energy the correction @xmath57 , which brings the center of the correlated state to its center in dft .",
    "hence a good choice for double counting correction ( in the absence of hunds coupling ) is given by @xmath57 with @xmath44 the nominal valence .",
    "in typical model calculations for the downfolded hubbard model , such nominal valence is automatically enforced .",
    "the dft part of our code is based on the wien2k package  @xcite .",
    "the exchange - correlation energy in dft ( @xmath28 $ ] ) is evaluated using the pbe functional.@xcite the dft+dmft calculations are fully self - consistent in the electronic charge density , chemical potential , and impurity levels .",
    "the temperature is set to 200k .",

    "these are all in excellent agreement with the experiment  @xcite .",
    "previous lda+dmft calculations of refs .",
    ", where only the @xmath40 states were treated in the model , gave very similar electronic spectra , hence results are very robust with respect to the choice of the correlated orbital .",

    "for large energy window ( @xmath60ev used here ) somewhat larger value of @xmath11 is needed , however , results are reasonable for an extended range of @xmath11 values between 6 - 10ev .",

    "the quasiparticle peak slightly narrows with increasing @xmath11 , but the mott gap does not open even for very large @xmath11 beyond 12 ev ( not shown in the figure ) .",
    "notice that this is inconsistent with the universal phase diagram in fig . 2 of ref .",
    "since @xmath67 falls deep inside the insulating regime for @xmath68 systems in that phase diagram .",
    "the lower hubbard band , located between the quasiparticle peak and oxygen bands , appears at @xmath69 ev and becomes even more pronounced at @xmath70 ev .",
    "the system is very mixed - valent ( non - integer occupancy ) in gga , but it becomes less mixed - valent with increasing @xmath11 .",
    "as expected , increasing correlation strength typically reduces mixed - valency . as is clear from fig .",
    "[ svo ] , results are not very sensitive to the strength of the coulomb repulsion , and any value of @xmath11 between 6 - 12@xmath62ev gives reasonable agreement with experiment .",

    "[ lvo ] displays dos for lavo@xmath0 for a range of @xmath11 values . in gga ,",
    "the @xmath40 states cross the fermi level , while the oxygen-@xmath16 bands are below -3.5@xmath62ev and the la-@xmath6 bands are just above the @xmath71 . for the correlation strength of 4@xmath62ev , lavo@xmath0 is still metallic , although the quasiparticle peak becomes extremely narrow , while the valence does not change appreciably from its gga value .",
    "larger @xmath72ev opens the mott gap , ( the critical @xmath11 is approximately 5@xmath62ev ) and an incoherent shoulder appears around @xmath73ev , and mixed - valency is reduced .",

    "the partial occupancies of the @xmath40 orbitals at @xmath19ev are @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 , hence the orbital fluctuations are strong due to the important role of hund s coupling , which prevents orbital polarization . this is all in good agreement with earlier dmft calculation of ref .  , which considered only the low energy @xmath40 degrees of freedom .",
    "notice that the oxygen-@xmath16 bands do not shift appreciably with increasing @xmath11 and their position is well determined by dft , in strong contrast to the calculations in ref .  , where the oxygen-@xmath16 bands move substantially for a small change in @xmath11 .    in latio@xmath0 , displayed in fig .",
    "[ lto ] , the oxygen-@xmath16 bands start around @xmath64ev and a very sharp la-@xmath6 state appears just above the fermi level at 1@xmath62ev .",
    "the position of this level is very sensitive to the rotation angle of the oxygen octahedra , and a larger rotation angle , which is obtained by the gga - optimization of the structure , shifts the level up by 0.5@xmath62ev compared to experimentally determined crystal structure  @xcite used here .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that octahedral rotations change the coordination of the a - site cation ( la ) drastically.@xcite it is due to screening by this sharp la-@xmath6 state that the mott gap does not open for @xmath79ev and is very small ( @xmath80ev ) at @xmath19ev .",

    "for the structure of ref .  , the orbital polarization is modest in our calculations ( @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 ) but for only slightly larger rotation , as measured in ref .  , the polarization is almost complete ( @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 ) . due to the substantial hybridization of the @xmath40 states with the la-@xmath6 states",
    "very near the fermi energy ( see fig .",
    "[ hyb ] ) , the screening is much stronger than it would be in the absence of this la-@xmath6 level .",
    "models which remove the la-@xmath6 states from consideration would hence need substantially reduced interaction @xmath11 to reproduce the experimentally observed mott gap  @xcite . indeed",
    ", our results clearly disagree with the phase diagram of ref .  , which leads us to believe that the @xmath87 phase diagram is more material specific , and also depends on presence of other states that can screen the interaction .",
    "to open a mott gap , a near integer occupancy is needed , but the critical value of @xmath11 and @xmath26 can be quite material specific .",
    "notice that the double counting is also proportional to the coulomb interaction @xmath11 , hence in the large @xmath11 limit , the upper and lower hubbard bands are pushed to positive and negative infinity respectively ; always resulting in an integer occupancy .",

    "the @xmath94 orbital is sharply peaked slightly below -2 ev , and the @xmath40 states start at -3 ev .",
    "a main finding of this paper is that the all - electron treatment with a large energy window requires a much larger value of @xmath11 than the corresponding lda+dmft study with the small energy window , which keeps the @xmath40 ( or @xmath41 ) states only .",
    "the bare coulomb repulsion @xmath11 of a model where all valence states are kept in the model is screened only by the degrees of freedom eliminated from the model , which are mostly core and semicore states , resulting in a much larger on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath11 in this treatment , but also more universal @xmath11 across similar compounds .",
    "the screening from model-@xmath11 down to the fully screened interaction @xmath95 is achieved here by the impurity solver ( see related discussion in the context of the model in ref . ) .    on the one particle level , it is best demonstrated by the impurity hybridization function , which contains signatures of all the valence states in the solid that screen the local degrees of freedom .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ hyb ] the average hybridization function ( average over orbitals ) for an electron on transition metal site in different compounds .",
    "we can understand qualitatively the influence of the window on the characteristic scale of the impurity model from the following argument .",
    "the kondo scale should not depend on the energy window chosen in the calculation .",
    "the kondo scale is a function of @xmath11 and impurity hybridization @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is some weighted average of the displayed hybridization function , with larger weight given to the low energy .",
    "when only the @xmath40 states in early transition metal compounds are kept in the model , @xmath11 has to be small , because the hybridization function is nonzero only within the narrow region around @xmath71 , and its average value is below 0.2@xmath62ev .",
    "when oxygen-@xmath16 states are added , @xmath98 increases tremendously in the interval @xmath99ev to @xmath100ev , and so does the weighted average @xmath101 , hence @xmath11 must increase to keep low energy scale intact .",
    "it is also clear from fig .",
    "[ hyb ] that the la-@xmath6 states screen the coulomb repulsion rather well , since they are located very near the fermi level ; hence elimination of la-@xmath6 states from the model would need to be compensated by a very material specific @xmath11 .",
    "finally , some extra screening is also coming from @xmath41 states above the fermi level , and since their position is very material dependent , their elimination requires further tuning of @xmath11 .",
    "however , when all these states are kept in the model , the large part of the screening is already contained in the model , and hence the all - electron @xmath11 is rather large and more universal .",
    "to asses the robustness of our results , we also tested the widely used fully localized limit ( fll ) double counting of ref .  , namely @xmath102 , where @xmath26 in the formula is computed self - consistently .",
    "we note that this makes charge self - consistency convergence a bit more challenging , but the results for the transition metal insulators studies here , are almost identical to those presented above for fixed double counting .    in fig .",

    "we again project to @xmath103 states for early transition metal oxides , and to @xmath104 and @xmath103 states in la@xmath1cuo@xmath2 , because these are the states which are correlated in the dmft calculations . for la@xmath1cuo@xmath2",
    ", we notice that the two localized projectors ( @xmath105 and @xmath106 ) both have occupancy close to nominal @xmath107 , and that the projector @xmath106 has slightly more charge ( 1% increase ) than the most localized @xmath105 . as shown by direct dft+dmft calculation above",
    ", @xmath106 gives the mott insulating state in la@xmath1cuo@xmath2 irrespective of small details in double - counting ( fixed - dc or fll - dc ) or charge - self - consistency . on the other hand , @xmath108 , which extends beyond the mt - boundary , contains some of the charge that should have been assigned to other itinerant states . as a result",
    ", it gives occupancy @xmath109 , almost identical to the charge on the wannier orbitals of ref .  .",
    "since construction of wannier orbitals inevitable results in some fraction of electrons being delocalized beyond the mt - boundary , it is not surprising that the 3@xmath5 occupancy is similar to our more delocalized projector .",
    "namely , maximally localized wannier orbitals need to faithfully represent a set of low energy bands , hence their localization is constrained to this condition .",
    "we verified that dft+dmft solution using @xmath108 and fll - dc results in metallic state , similar to finding of ref .  .",
    "for the insulating early transition metal oxides , the @xmath103 occupancies of both localized projectors @xmath105 and @xmath106 are again quite close to nominal valence , namely @xmath68 for latio@xmath0 and @xmath110 for lavo@xmath0 .",
    "on the other hand , the delocalized projector @xmath108 results in much larger @xmath26 , even larger than reported in ref .  .",
    "hence , wannier orbitals in ref .",
    "are more localized than our @xmath108 , but less than @xmath106 or @xmath105 .",
    "we verified that increasing localization of the projector always results in increased @xmath26 occupancy .",
    "the mott state within dft+dmft is again very robust using proj(1 ) and proj(2 ) , but not when proj(3 ) is used .",
    "finally , the 3@xmath5 occupancy in srvo@xmath0 is quite far from nominal @xmath68 valence even when using very localized projectors , and hence this mixed - valency results in metallic state even for very large values of local coulomb repulsion @xmath11 , in agreement with experimental observation of a metallic state in srvo@xmath0 .    in the early transition metal oxides",
    ", we projected the kohn - sham solution to the @xmath103 states , because the center of the @xmath104 states is sufficiently above the fermi level that it does not require dynamic treatment within the dmft .",
    "since the @xmath104 states strongly hybridize with the oxygen , the @xmath104 occupancy does not exactly vanish .",
    "however , the dft+dmft solution is very sensitive to the correlated @xmath103 occupancy in early transition metal oxides , since the @xmath104 states behave very differently , having a large gap .",
    "hence , the @xmath104 and @xmath103 charge should not be counted together when assessing stability of the dmft insulating solution , hence we presented the @xmath103 charge only in tables  [ tabel1],[tabel2 ] .",
    "we have shown in this paper that with the dft+dmft methodology of ref .  , a reasonable qualitative agreement between theory and experiment for the @xmath16 and @xmath5 spectra across the transition metal series is obtained , even when the coulomb repulsion @xmath11 and @xmath111 are fixed across the entire series , hence no tuning parameter is needed for qualitative description of correlated solids , which is a requirement for any ab - initio predictive method .",
    "this was possible because the dft+dmft method is implemented with a very localized projector , where the screening of the coulomb repulsion by other valence states through hybridization is very efficient .",
    "a large effort was undertaken recently by several groups  @xcite to implement dft+dmft in a way that does not require tuning parameters , and that has _",
    "ab inito _ predictive power . in our opinion , such mature state of dft+dmft has largely been reached , as demonstrated on early and late transition metal oxides here .",
    "this method gives a zeroth - order picture of the physics in correlated materials such as transition metal oxides .",
    "however , the position of oxygen states is not very precise is some compounds ( see latio@xmath0 ) , and better treatment of exchange would be needed to mitigate this deficiency .",
    "it was recently proposed in ref .",
    "that additional hartree term due to non - local interaction @xmath112 could mitigate this problem .",
    "however , in the charge - self - consistent dft+dmft used here , the hartree terms are taken into account exactly , and therefore no extra hartree shifts are justified .",
    "further corrections could come only from better treatment of the non - local exchange .",
    "furthermore , the gap sizes of mott insulators and positions of hubbard bands can be improved by calculating coulomb @xmath11 more precisely from first principles .",
    "this is an important open problem in condensed matter theory .",
    "methods such as gw  @xcite and constrained - rpa  @xcite show some promise in this direction , but more work is needed to get precise enough values of @xmath11 for modern dft+dmft codes , which use localized atomic orbitals in a large energy window .    in our implementation of dft+dmft , the position of oxygen states is not very far from its dft value , and quite insensitive to the value of the correlation strength , in contrast to finding of refs .  .",
    "while the position of the oxygen states in dft are not always in very good agreement with experiment , their small displacement does not lead to a major failure of dft+dmft .",
    "this shortcoming of lda is known to occur in other materials ( see for example ref .  ) and can be corrected by a better treatment of the non - local exchange as in hybrid dft or gw , but not by dmft .",
    "we have also shown in this paper that in transition metal oxides the self - consistent value of the correlated electronic charge @xmath26 of lda+dmft is closer to nominal valence than its lda value . a similar finding",
    "was reported in ref .   when studying the actinide series and its compounds .",
    "a systematic comparison with the x - ray data confirmed that the lda+dmft systematically improves the value of the correlated charge , @xmath113 , relative to its lda value .",
    "finally , the dmft method is an orbitally dependent method , and the results depend on the choice of the correlated set of orbitals .",
    "the convergence of the results with respect to the number of orbitals is not possible at present , because the quantum mechanical problem becomes too expensive to solve .",
    "the quality of the results hence rest on the educated choice of the correlated orbital ( the choice of the projector ) which determines the set of states that are treated very precisely , by summing all local feynman diagrams , and those that are treated by dft . since dmft truncates interaction and correlations beyond single site , a more localized orbital is clearly a better choice in this method . to recover similar results in a more delocalized basis , one would clearly need to go beyond single site approximation , which increases computational expense exponentially .",
    "we have shown that in transition metal oxides , the @xmath8 occupancies ( @xmath26 ) on the transition metal ion are not very far from nominal valence when sufficiently localized radial function is chosen for the projector .",
    "this is true even on the dft level .",
    "we have also explicitly demonstrated that the choice of a more delocalized radial orbital leads to valences substantially larger than the nominal valence , which posses a problem for dmft method , as noted in refs .  .",
    "for such a choice of correlated states , the non - local correlations would likely need to be considered to recover similar results as in more localized case . in conclusion",
    ", we successfully tested our implementation of the dft+dmft method in @xmath8 transition metal series .",
    "the method predicts qualitative features , such as existance of a metallic or insulating state starting from first principles .",
    "it can be made fully automated , and hence high - throughput screening of correlated materials is an attractive avenue for future research .",
