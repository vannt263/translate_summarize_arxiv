    "in recent years , with the advance of new fabrication technologies , it has become more feasible to actually utilize higher dimensional periodic dielectric structures ( or especially the photonic bandgap crystals ) @xcite for modifying the properties of the photon states as well as the properties of the spontaneous emission . like electrons in solid state crystals ,",
    "photons are prohibited to propagate inside photonic bandgap crystals due to the lack of available photon states . in general , the photon density of states ( dos ) of photonic crystals has a highly non - uniform distribution near the bandgap , which is totally different from the case in free space .",
    "such a non - uniform distribution of the dos has been investigated by many authors and has provided a new and experimentally feasible platform for investigating photon - atom interaction .",
    "many new phenomena such as photon - atom bound states @xcite , spectral splitting @xcite , quantum interference dark line effect @xcite , phase control of spontaneous emission @xcite , transparency near band edge @xcite , and single - atom switching @xcite have been theoretically discovered in the presence of the bandgap . from the aulter - townes spectra for atoms coupled to a photonic bandgap structure @xcite or equivalently a frequency - depended photon dos @xcite ,",
    "the modification of the spontaneous emission caused by the environment @xcite actually can be verified .",
    "however , all of the above studies only focused on the transient behavior of the atom - photon interactions and to the best of our knowledge there is still no theoretical treatment on calculating the steady - state fluorescence spectra in photonic bandgap crystals .    to investigate this problem ,",
    "the approach of the present paper is to treat the photon states of the photonic crystal as the background reservoir and introduce non - markovian noise operators caused by the non - uniform dos distribution near the band edge . to model the non - uniform dos distribution near the bandgap , an isotropic dispersion relation @xcite and an anisotropic dispersion relation @xcite",
    "have been proposed to serve as a simple but qualitatively correct model for theoretical analyses . with the use of the three - dimensional anisotropic dispersion relation",
    ", we will investigate the steady - state properties of the resonance fluorescence spectra emitted by a two - level atom which is embedded in a photonic bandgap crystal and driven by a classical pumping light .",
    "due to the non - markovian nature of the atom - field interaction in this case , we can not directly utilize the born - markovian approximation which is usually used in quantum optics for treating atom - photon interaction problems . to overcome this difficulty , we first derive the generalized optical bloch equations without any approximation and then use the zero - order liouville operator expansion to approximate the nonlinear terms . by solving the simplified linear equations in the fourier domain directly we can calculate the stationary two - time correlation functions of the atomic operators as well as the spectral distribution of the resonance fluorescence . when the emission frequency of the atom is far from the bandedge , the triplet spectral shape is obtained , just as one will expect intuitively from the results first calculated by b. mollow @xcite for the free space case .",
    "but when we change the emission wavelength of the atom to be close to the band edge , both the number of the peaks as well as their profiles are found to be varied depending on the wavelength offset between the atomic transition wavelength and the band edge",
    ". the details of these results will be reported in the rest of this paper .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ secbloch ] we derive the generalized optical bloch equations with noise operators caused by the surrounding reservoir . in section [ secpbg ]",
    "we use the anisotropic dispersion relation for modeling the photon dos of the three - dimensional photonic bandgap structure and based on this model , we present the calculated fluorescence spectra in section [ secfrs ] .",
    "finally , a brief conclusion is given in section [ secconclu ] and the first order liouville operator expansion is carried out in the appendix for accuracy checking .",
    "with the help of rotation wave approximation , one can use the jaynes - cummings model to describe the atom - photon interaction @xcite . for a single two - level atom embedded in a photonic bandgap crystal and driven by a monochromatic classical pump light ,",
    "the photon states in the photonic bandgap crystal can be treated as the background reservoir .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system can be written as : @xmath0 where the transition frequency of the atom and the frequency of the pumping light are denoted by @xmath1 and @xmath2 respectively , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the creation and annihilation operators of the background field reservoir , @xmath5 is the rabi - flopping frequency of the atom under the external pumping light and also represents the relative magnitude of the pumping light , @xmath6 , @xmath7 are the usual pauli matrices for a two - level atom , and @xmath8 is the atom - field coupling constant .",
    "here we use the index @xmath9 to label different photon states .",
    "the form of the coupling constant @xmath8 depends on the gauge one choose .",
    "although the lamb shifts calculated in non - relativistic quantum field theories are different with the @xmath10 and @xmath11 formula @xcite , one can use the @xmath12 formulation to get the correct form for the atom - field coupling @xcite , if the electromagnetic field varies little over the spatial extent of the electronic wave function . under the @xmath12 formulation",
    "the coupling constant @xmath8 can be expressed as : @xmath13 here we use notations @xmath14 for the magnitude of the atomic dipole moment , @xmath15 for the unit vector along the direction of the dipole moment , @xmath16 for the volume of the quantization space , and @xmath17 for the coulomb constant .",
    "the evolution equations for the atomic operators can be derived directly from the hamiltonian in eq .",

    "one can see that the correlation functions depend not only on the photon density of states , but also on the correlations of the atomic operators .",
    "( [ es1]-[es3 ] ) are called the generalized optical bloch equations and will serve as the starting point for our further derivation .",
    "due to the bandgap characteristics of photonic crystals , the spectral distribution of the photon dos will have one or more discontinuities and is highly non - uniform near the bandedge .",
    "although in general the dos of photonic bandgap crystals will vary with the geometrical structure and the dielectric constants of the materials they are made by , it is still possible to introduce some simple formula for approximately describing the dos behavior near the bandgap . in the literature an isotropic dispersion relation @xcite and an anisotropic dispersion relation @xcite have been proposed to serve as a simple but qualitatively correct model for theoretical analyses . however , according to the results from a full vectorial numerical calculation @xcite , the dos near the bandgap for a three - dimensional photonic crystal increases from zero and behaves more like the anisotropic model .",
    "this is why we will adopt the anisotropic model in the following derivation . from eq .",
    "( [ eqgk ] ) , one knows that the magnitude of the coupling constant is also dependent on the local electric field .",
    "although in general one should apply this position - dependent coupling constant with the actual dos to fully describe the photon - atom interaction within a photonic bandgap crystals , however for simplicity we will use the anisotropic model and a constant coupling coefficient for all the field modes to perform the numerical calculation .    for three dimensional photonic bandgap crystals ,",
    "if the wavevector that corresponds to the bandedge is @xmath33 , then the dispersion relation in the anisotropic model is described by the following form : @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is a model dependent constant and @xmath36 is the band edge frequency .",
    "based on this dispersion relation , the corresponding dos is given by : @xmath37 .",
    "the memory functions under the anisotropic model also can be derived as : @xmath38 where @xmath39 , and we have used the space average coupling strength @xmath40 in the derivation .    from fig .",
    "[ figgw ] , we can see that the spectrum of the memory function @xmath41 are non - uniform and asymmetric as we expect .",
    "when the frequency is below the bandedge frequency @xmath36 , the memory function becomes pure imaginary , indicating the inhibition of the spontaneous emission inside the bandgap .",

    "this is equivalent to use the equal time operator products to replace the two - time operator products .",
    "we have also checked the accuracy of the results by including the first order perturbation terms .",
    "the formulation is given in the appendix and the numerical results only show difference when the intensity pumping is extremely high .",
    "it should be noted that the approximation we have made is valid only when the time scale of the system response is much slower compared to the time scale of the memory function .",
    "however , with the use of our approximation , we still keep the finite response time of the memory function in the formulation .",
    "this allows us to study the effects that are not considered in the usual markovian regime , where the memory function is simply approximated by a delta - function .",
    "although our approximation includes only one portion of the non - markovian nature of the problem , it should still be quite valid for the fluorescence spectrum calculation considered in the present work since here the memory function time scale is typically much shorter than the atomic response time scale .    under the zero - th order liouville operator expansion approximation , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 , and with the identities of pauli matrices , the generalized optical bloch equations in eqs .",

    "in conclusion , we have developed a new formulation to calculate the fluorescence spectrum with non - markovian photon - atom interactions , and have successfully applied it to the case of a single atom embedded in a photonic bandgap crystal . by introducing liouville operator expansion , we can overcome some of the difficulties caused by the non - markovian nature of the problem due to the non - uniform distribution of the photon states in the photonic bandgap crystals . although the approximation we have made is valid only when the time scale of the system response is much slower compared to the time scale of the memory function , however , with the use of our approximation we can still keep the finite response time of the memory function in the formulation .",
