    "the first of the ten @xmath0,@xmath1-digit challenges @xcite , proposed to calculate the integral @xmath2 to ten digits .",
    "this was a real challenge since the integrand oscillates infinitely often inside the interval of integration . in this note",
    ", a general result is proved that will allow us to determine exactly the value of some highly oscillating integrals .",
    "to give you the flavour of what we will prove , here is one of our results : @xmath3 where the graph of the integrand is depicted in the following figure [ fig1 ] .     on @xmath4.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    in section [ sec2 ] we will prove our main results and in section [ sec4 ] we will give some detailed examples and applications .",
    "first , let us set the framework of our investigation . our starting point will be a @xmath5-periodic locally integrable function @xmath6 . for a nonzero real number @xmath7",
    ", we are interested in the evaluation of the integrals : @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are , respectively , the even and the odd components of @xmath11 . they are defined on @xmath12 by the formul : @xmath13 on the other hand , the cauchy principal value @xmath14 of the integral @xmath15 , plays an important role in this study . recall that @xmath14 is defined as follows :    @xmath16    in the next proposition , we prove the convergence of the integrals defined by and , and we describe their relationship to the principal value defined by .    [ pr41 ] consider @xmath6 , and a nonzero real @xmath7 .",
    "[ pr411 ] the integral @xmath17 is absolutely convergent .",
    "[ pr412 ] if @xmath18 , then the integral @xmath19 is convergent .",
    "[ pr413 ] the principal value @xmath14 is well defined and @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are defined by and , respectively .    indeed ,",
    "the first point is easy since , for @xmath23 , we have @xmath24 so @xmath25 and follows.to prove we consider the function @xmath26 defined by @xmath27 . since @xmath11 belongs to @xmath28 and @xmath29",
    "we conclude immediately that @xmath26 is continuous and @xmath5-periodic . in particular ,",
    "@xmath26 is bounded on @xmath12 .",
    "an integration by parts shows that , for @xmath30 , we have @xmath31 indeed , this version of `` integration by parts '' is a dirct application of fubini s theorem , see for instance ( * ? ? ? * theorem  5.2.3 ) .",
    "now , the following inequality @xmath32 proves the absolute convergence of the integral @xmath33 .",
    "this implies the convergence of @xmath34 and shows that @xmath35    on the other hand , for @xmath36 , we have @xmath37 because @xmath38 is odd , and @xmath39 is even . finally , noting that @xmath40 since @xmath10 is odd , and using and , we obtain by letting @xmath41 tend to @xmath42 , and the proposition follows .    using the notation of the preceding proposition , and the parity of @xmath43 and @xmath44",
    ", we obtain the following corollary that reduces the determination of @xmath21 and @xmath22 to that of @xmath14 .",
    "[ co41 ] using the notation of proposition [ pr41 ] , we have @xmath45    thus , the question is reduced to determining @xmath46 .",
    "the next proposition expresses differently this quantity .",
    "[ pr42 ] for @xmath6 , and a nonzero real @xmath7 , we have @xmath47 where @xmath14 is defined by .",
    "recall that,(see @xcite , ) @xmath48 with normal convergence on every compact set @xmath49 contained in @xmath50 . applying this to the compact segment @xmath51\\right\\}$ ] , and recalling that @xmath6 ,",
    "we conclude that @xmath52 which is the desired conclusion .",
    "the following lemma , will be of interest in formulating our main theorem .",
    "[ pr43 ] for @xmath6 , and a nonzero real @xmath7 , we have @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the sign of @xmath55 if @xmath56 and @xmath57 , and @xmath58 are the exponential fourier coefficients of @xmath11 .    for a nonzero real @xmath7 ,",
    "consider the continuous , @xmath5-periodic , function @xmath59 defined by @xmath60 the exponential fourier coefficients @xmath61 of @xmath59 are given by @xmath62 indeed , let us consider two cases :    * for @xmath63 , we have @xmath64 * and , for @xmath65 , we have @xmath66    combining these two points proves .now , since @xmath67 for every @xmath68 , we see that @xmath69 thus , the continuous , @xmath5-periodic , function @xmath70 is equal to its fourier series expansion . in particular , @xmath71 that is , by , @xmath72 finally , using proposition [ pr42 ] , we obtain .",
    "now , combining corollary [ co41 ] , proposition [ pr41 ] and proposition [ pr43 ] , we come to our main theorem .",
    "[ th41 ] consider @xmath6 and a positive real @xmath7 , then the following two integrals are convergent @xmath73 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are , respectively , the even and odd components of @xmath11 defined by .",
    "moreover , @xmath74    [ cor2 ] consider @xmath6 and a positive real @xmath7 .",
    "if @xmath11 is , and its fourier series expansion is @xmath75(x)=\\frac{a_0}{2}+\\sum_{n\\geq1}a_n\\cos nx$ ] , then @xmath76    if @xmath11 is , and its fourier series expansion is @xmath75(x)= \\sum_{n\\geq1}b_n\\sin nx$ ] , then @xmath77    there is a case where theorem [ th41 ] takes a more practical form .",
    "so , let us change our point of view .",
    "let @xmath78 be an analytic function on a domain @xmath79 , that _ contains _ the closed unit disk @xmath80 .",
    "for a positive real number @xmath7 , we are interested in determining the value of the integrals : @xmath81 where the real variable functions @xmath82 and @xmath83 are , respectively , the `` cos '' and the `` sin '' components of the function @xmath84 , defined on @xmath12 by the formul : @xmath85    the next theorem gives the answer to this question :    [ th1 ] let @xmath86 be an anlytic function on a domain @xmath79 that contains the closed unit disk , then , for every positive real @xmath7 , one has @xmath87 where @xmath82 and @xmath83 are defined by .",
    "indeed , by assumption , there is a power series @xmath88 with radius of convergence @xmath89 such that @xmath90 so , we can define a continuous , @xmath5-periodic function @xmath11 by @xmath91 . comparing and we see that @xmath92 and @xmath93 . on the other hand , from we conclude that the fourier coefficients of @xmath11 are given by @xmath94 if @xmath95 and @xmath96 if @xmath97 .",
    "thus , theorem [ th1 ] proves @xmath98 which is the desired conclusion .",
    "let @xmath55 be a positive number , and consider the analytic function @xmath86 defined on the domaine @xmath99 , by @xmath100 here , it is straightforward to check that @xmath101 so @xmath102    using theorem [ th1 ] we see that , for @xmath65 , we have @xmath103 thus , from , and after making the change of variables @xmath104 and @xmath105 , we get : @xmath106 or , equivalently @xmath107 this can be expressed as follows : for positive @xmath7 and @xmath108 , we have @xmath109 in particular , choosing @xmath110 we find the integral that we used to introduce our discussion . on the other hand , using @xmath83 from , and the second part of theorem [ th1 ] , we find that , for @xmath65 , we have        in our second example we consider the even function @xmath6 defined by @xmath114 it is well - known , ( see for instance ( * ? ? ? * chapter  3 ,  $ 14 ) , ) that @xmath11 has the following fourier series expansion @xmath115(t)=\\ln2+\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty\\frac{\\cos nt}{n}\\ ] ] thus , applying corollary [ cor2 ] we obtain that for every @xmath65 we have @xmath116 the change of variables @xmath117 and @xmath105 yields the following result : @xmath118        let @xmath119 and @xmath41 be positive real numbers , such that @xmath120 consider the meromorphic function @xmath86 defined by @xmath121 clearly , @xmath86 is analytic in the domain @xmath122 that contains the closed unit disk .",
