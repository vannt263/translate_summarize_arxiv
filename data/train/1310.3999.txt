    "as is widely known , potassium dihydrogen phosphate ( kh@xmath4po@xmath5 or kdp ) experiences a phase transition to a ferroelectric state when cooled below @xmath6122k  @xcite . at the phase transition the crystal structure of kdp changes from a tetragonal ( 42 m ) to an orthorhombic ( 2 mm ) structure due to an ordering of the positions of the hydrogen atoms .",
    "the ferroelectric transition in kdp at ambient pressure is often considered as an archetypical example of a first order phase transition close to the second order one , which is not quite true .",
    "the point is that although the changes of thermodynamic properties at the phase transition in kdp are indeed very small  @xcite , the order parameter jumps at the transition by about 1.8 @xmath7 ref .",
    "@xcite , which is quite significant when compared to the saturated polarization @xmath8 @xmath7 ref .",
    "this implies that strong first order features in the phase transition of kdp can not be ignored .",
    "a tiny hysteresis of the transition temperature measured during cooling and heating ( see later in the paper ) reflects the small volume and entropy change across the phase transition .",
    "the transition becomes second order at a tricritical point at @xmath62600 bar , which was well documented in a number of publications  @xcite .",
    "the anomalous behavior of the thermodynamic functions at the phase transition in kdp at ambient pressure was explained in  @xcite by the proximity to this tricritical point . at the same time",
    ", limited data available on the elastic properties of kdp are usually not taken into account when analyzing its phase diagram .",
    "however , it should be emphasized that elastic properties of ferroelectrics obtained from ultrasound measurements could differ significantly from the ones measured under static conditions . in the present case ,",
    "propagations of the longitudinal sound waves in the ferroelectric phase of kdp , causing local polarizations in the z direction , are unable to produce the corresponding @xmath9 mechanical strain , due to a frequency limitation . as a result",
    "the quantities @xmath10 , calculated through the standard expression @xmath11 , are , in case of the ferroelectric phase , not true elastic moduli .",
    "the quantities analogous to @xmath1 and @xmath0 of the paraelectric phase can therefore be called `` pseudomoduli '' . though hereafter we will not use different designations for these quantities ,",
    "their nature will be obvious to the reader from the context of the discussion .",
    "it is also important to remember that according to ref .",
    "@xcite the propagation of longitudinal ultrasound waves in kdp along the polar axis z creates an intensive depolarizing electrical field , which should strongly suppress the corresponding anomalies at the phase transition .",
    "an attempt to verify this statement is part of the current study .    elastic properties of kdp at the ferroelectric phase transition had attracted considerable attention since mason s seminal paper  @xcite . in its paraelectric tetragonal phase , kdp is piezoelectric and the @xmath9 mechanical strain is piezoelectrically coupled to the polarization along the z direction via the piezoelectric constant @xmath12 .",
    "the corresponding elastic modulus @xmath13 shows ( the curie - weiss ) anomalous behavior , as follows from shear wave propagation along the [ 100 ] direction with [ 010 ] polarization  @xcite .",
    "these measurements could only be made in the paraelectric phase due to the strong scattering of sound waves at domain boundaries in the ferroelectric phase .",
    "nevertheless the corresponding data were obtained by a brillouin - scattering technique  @xcite , which revealed the anomalous behavior of @xmath13 also in the ferroelectric phase , below @xmath14 . upon transition to the ferroelectric orthorhombic phase three more piezoelectric constants become active and as a result the mechanical strains @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 couple to the polarization in the z direction as well .",
    "consequently , elastic moduli such as @xmath0 , @xmath18 and @xmath1 may show anomalous properties in the ferroelectric phase .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge the only attempt to measure longitudinal moduli in kdp was made in ref .",
    "@xcite , and with limited accuracy .",
    "note that one can not expect an anomalous behavior of @xmath19 and @xmath20 since the corresponding piezoelectric constants @xmath21 and @xmath22 are equal to zero - although high order coupling can not be excluded , which would lead to insignificant variation of @xmath19 and @xmath20 in the vicinity of the phase transition .",
    "temperature dependence of elastic moduli @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath19 and @xmath13 in kdp . also shown ( in red / green * ( ? ) * ) is brillouin scattering data for @xmath13 from ref .",
    "we report results of ultrasonic studies of a single crystal of kdp in the temperature range 2 - 300k .",
    "during the course of this study , several runs were performed using the digital pulse - echo techniques ( see  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "several samples of kdp of 1.5 - 2 mm thicknesses with orientations along [ 001 ] and [ 100 ] were cut from larger high quality single crystals .",
    "the corresponding surfaces of the samples were polished to be parallel and optically flat .",
    "since the elastic and piezoelectric properties of ferroelectric materials depend on electrical boundary conditions , the samples were plated with gold or wrapped with a silver leaf  @xcite",
    ".     reduced temperature dependence of the elastic moduli @xmath0 and @xmath1.,width=283 ]     the temperature hysteresis of the elastic moduli @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath19 at the phase transition in kdp.,width=283 ]    the 36@xmath23 y ( p - wave ) and 41@xmath23 x ( s - wave ) cut @xmath24 transducers were bonded to the samples with silicon grease . for the measurements the experimental setup was placed within the ppms cryostat , with a temperature control ability of about 0.001k .",
    "the elastic moduli @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath19 and @xmath13 were obtained from the longitudinal and transverse sound velocities along the [ 001 ] and [ 100 ] directions .",
    "the domain structure does not prevent propagation of longitudinal ultrasound waves along the [ 001 ] , [ 100 ] and [ 010 ] directions , nor a shear wave in the [ 001 ] direction .",
    "of course , @xmath13 could only be measured at @xmath25 .",
    "the results of the experiments are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . shown therein is also literature data , which characterized the behavior of @xmath13 in the vicinity of the phase transition .",
    "splitting of the up and down curves of the temperature dependence of the elastic moduli in the hysteresis area .",
    "* if you used two different colours for up and down , it could be clearer for @xmath26k.*,width=283 ]     temperature dependence of @xmath0 in the ferroelectric phase of kdp.,width=283 ]     temperature dependence of @xmath1 in the ferroelectric phase of kdp.,width=283 ]",
    "as is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the elastic moduli @xmath0 and @xmath1 both demonstrate strong softening when approaching the phase transition point from the ferroelectric phase .",
    "their behavior can thus be described by a universal curve ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "both moduli are reduced by @xmath27 when the temperature increases from @xmath6110 k to the phase transition point at 122 k. in contrast , as was pointed out earlier , the shear modulus @xmath13 shows softening both in the paraelectric and ferroelectric phases , satisfying the relation @xmath28 at least in the paraelectric phase  @xcite .",
    "finally , the evolution of the shear modulus @xmath19 across the phase transition looks absolutely flat , though it reveals some structure at higher magnification ( the absolute fluctuation of @xmath19 in the entire temperature range studied does not exceed 1.5% ) the first order nature of the phase transition is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , [ fig4 ] , which show a small ( @xmath60.02k ) but distinct hysteresis of the elastic properties of kdp across the transition .",
    "the analysis of the temperature evolution of @xmath0 and @xmath1 in the ferroelectric phase shows that these quantities can be approximated by the expression @xmath29 with @xmath30 in the temperature range 0.001k@xmath310.2k ( see fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , [ fig6 ] ) .",
    "we note that our attempts to simultaneously determine the values of @xmath32 and @xmath33 were not quite satisfactory .",
    "so , at first , we fixed @xmath33 at the ( experimental ) values of @xmath14 , which are different for the cooling and heating runs , and found @xmath30 .",
    "then we fixed @xmath32 at 0.5 and fitted @xmath33 , which appeared ( within the experimental resolution ) not to be different from the experimental @xmath14 values .",
    "this implies that the temperature of the expected discontinuity of the elastic moduli is pretty close to the @xmath33 value in the relation @xmath29 .",
    "this situation agrees completely with the presence of a well defined hysteresis . on the other hand",
    "it probably indicates that the transition temperature is very close to the absolute instability temperature . remarkably , our analysis of the data in ref .",
    "@xcite shows that in the restricted temperature interval near the phase transition point the order parameter exponent in kdp is close to @xmath34 . whether this is a simple coincidence or results from some physical correlations remain to be seen .",
    "we recall now the suggestion that ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) longitudinal elastic waves propagating in a piezo active media may locally change the polarization such that the velocity of longitudinal waves in kdp may not experience any kind of abnormalities at the phase transition .",
    "the experimental data obviously contradict this statement , which could probably be explained by the domain structure of real samples .",
    "in conclusion , we report results of ultrasonic studies on a single crystal of kdp in the temperature range 2 - 300 k. the elastic moduli @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath19 and @xmath13 were calculated from longitudinal and transverse sound velocities along the [ 001 ] and [ 100 ] directions . the analysis of the temperature evolution of @xmath0 and @xmath1 in the ferroelectric phase shows that these quantities can be approximated by the expression @xmath2 in the temperature range 0.001k@xmath30.2k for reasons that remain to be resolved .",
    "the elastic constants @xmath0 , @xmath1 can be presented in a common reduced form , which again contradicts the conclusions made in ref .  @xcite .",
