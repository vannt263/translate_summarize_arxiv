    "the high force sensitivity allows precision measurement of the shift of the resonance frequency of a nanomembrane resonator .",

    "the q can be as high as @xmath22 even after metallization@xcite , which is expected to introduce extra material loss and clamping loss . from a transducer point of view , high q implies low thermomechanical noise and so high force sensitivity . here",

    "fabrication process of the nanomembrane is described as follows .",

    "the output power of the laser is stabilized with a current and temperature controller@xcite and is set to @xmath37 ( operating current @xmath38 ) which corresponds to the setpoint with the lowest frequency noise .",
    "then the light is attenuated to @xmath39 and sent to the nanomembrane through a circulator@xcite .",
    "the light reflected from the nanomembrane returns to the circulator and is collected with a photodetector .",

    "with fiber - membrane distance monitored in real time , the fiber is brought to the closest yet safe distance from the nanomembrane by operating the picomotors . during the approach",
    "the fiber is aligned several times with a tip - tilt stage@xcite  ( see fig .  [",

    "we measured the frequency response of the sin gold coated nanomembranes and studied how the quality factor is modified when they are covered with gold .",
    "the nanomembrane is excited with an oscillating voltage @xmath54 which is applied to the piezo actuator and the response is measured with the fiber interferometer .",
    "the amplitude - frequency response of the nano - membrane was obtained by measuring the oscillation amplitude of the nano - membrane and sweeping the driving frequency excitation .",
    "the frequency response was measured in a set of samples where the amount of surface covered by gold changes  ( see figs .  [",

    "<S> we present the instrumentation and measurement scheme of a new casimir force probe that bridges casimir force measurements at microscale and macroscale . </S>",
    "<S> a metallized high q silicon nitride nanomembrane resonator is employed as a sensitive force probe . the high tensile stress present in the nanomembrane not only enhances the quality factor but also maintains high flatness over large area serving as the bottom electrode in a sphere - plane configuration . </S>",
    "<S> a fiber interferometer is used to readout the oscillation of the nanomembrane and a phase - locked loop scheme is applied to track the change of the resonance frequency . because of the high quality factor of the nanomembrane and the high stability of the setup , a frequency resolution down to @xmath0 and a corresponding force gradient resolution of 3 @xmath1n / m is achieved . </S>",
    "<S> besides sensitive measurement of casimir force , our measurement technique simultaneously offers kelvin probe measurement capability that allows _ in situ _ imaging of the surface potentials . </S>"
