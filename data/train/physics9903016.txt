    "halogen negative ions have been subject of experimental and theoretical multiphoton detachment studies for over thirty years ( hall 1965 , robinson and geltman 1967 ) .",
    "apart from the negative hydrogen ion which traditionally receives a lot of attention , especially from theorists , they are definitely the most studied negative ions .",
    "nevertheless , there are very few firmly established results on the absolute values of the cross sections and photoelectron angular distributions in multiphoton processes .",
    "a number of experimental works reports the cross sections and angular asymmetry parameters measured in two - photon detachment at selected photon energies in f@xmath3 and cl@xmath3 ( trainham 1987 , blondel 1989 , 1992 , kwon 1989 , davidson 1992 , sturrus 1992 , blondel and delsart 1993 ) . for heavier halogen ions , br@xmath3 and i@xmath3 , the experimental data are scarce ( hall 1965 , blondel 1992 , blondel and delsart 1993 ) .    on the theoretical side",
    ", there were pioneering two - photon detachment calculations by robinson and geltman ( 1967 ) performed using a model potential approach , and a number of other perturbation - theory calculations employing the hartree - fock ( hf ) approximation for the ionic ground state , and either plane or hf waves for the photoelectron in the continuum ( crance 1987a , b , 1988 ) .",
    "the latter were applied to study @xmath4-photon detachment cross sections and photoelectron angular distributions from halogen negative ions for @xmath4 up to five .",
    "jiang and starace ( 1988 ) used a transition - matrix approach and examined the contribution of the lowest - order correlation processes in the two - photon detachment from cl@xmath3 .",
    "they showed that the role of correlations is small just above the threshold but increases with the photon energy and reaches about 20% , compared with the hf result . later on pan ( 1990 ) and pan and starace ( 1991 ) performed similar calculations of the two - photon detachment cross section and angular distribution for f@xmath3 .",
    "using first - order perturbation theory in electron interaction they included more correlation corrections and estimated the contribution of the many - electron effects at 10 to 20% in the cross sections , but almost negligible in the angular distribution asymmetry parameters . more recently van der hart ( 1996 ) used the @xmath5-matrix floquet theory to calculate multiphoton detachment from f@xmath3 and cl@xmath3 .",
    "he found a discrepancy with the results of the transition - matrix approach in f@xmath3 and cl@xmath3 within about 30% .    in the above works , except that of robinson and geltman , the halogen ion ground state was described either in the hf , or in a few - state configuration interaction approximation .",
    "consequently , the binding energy of the outer electron , as obtained from the calculation , was never in good agreement with the experimental electron affinity , and experimental energy values were used in the calculations of the multiphoton amplitudes and cross sections . on the other hand , the asymptotic behaviour of the ground - state wave function in these calculations remained incorrect .",
    "this may seem to have introduced only a small error in the calculation , since the bound - state wave function in the asymptotic region is small .",
    "however , as shown in the adiabatic theory of multiphoton detachment from negative ions ( gribakin and kuchiev 1997a , 1997b ) , the asymptotic behaviour of the bound - state wave function is crucial for obtaining correct absolute values of the probabilities of multiphoton processes . this theory based on the keldysh approach",
    "( keldysh 1964 ) approach shows that the electron escape from the atomic system in a low - frequency laser field takes place at large distances , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the photon frequency , @xmath8 is related to the initial bound state energy , @xmath9 , and @xmath4 is the number of quanta absorbed ( atomic units are used throughout ) .",
    "accordingly , the multiphoton detachment rates are basically determined by the long - range asymptotic behaviour of the bound - state wave function , namely by parameters @xmath10 and @xmath8 of the corresponding radial wave function @xmath11 .",
    "this result is obtained using the length form of interaction with the laser field , which proves to be the most convenient for multiphoton processes .",
    "the analytical adiabatic approach is valid for _ multiphoton _ detachment processes , i.e. , strictly speaking , for @xmath12 .",
    "however , the calculations for h@xmath3 and halogen negative ions indicate ( gribakin and kuchiev 1997a , kuchiev and ostrovsky 1998 ) that the analytical formulae should give reasonable answers even for @xmath13 . to verify these conclusions we performed direct numerical calculations of the two - photon detachment cross section of fluorine f@xmath3 negative ion ( gribakin 1998 ) within the lowest order of perturbation theory and compared the results obtained with different ground - state wavefunctions .",
    "we demonstrated explicitly the sensitivity of the cross sections to the asymptotic behaviour of the bound - state wave function and showed that the true cross section should be substantially higher than it was previously believed , based on calculations with the hf @xmath14 wavefunction .",
    "moreover , the use of the ground - state wavefunction with correct asymptotic behaviour in multiphoton detachment calculations is often more important than other effects of electron correlations .    in our previous work",
    "the asymptotically correct @xmath14 wavefunction was obtained using a model potential chosen to reproduce the experimental value of the @xmath14-electron energy .",
    "of course , any model - potential approach is not free from ambiguities related to the choice of the potential .",
    "the aim of present work is to perform more accurate calculations of the two - photon detachment in negative halogen ions using correct @xmath0 wavefunctions obtained within the many - body dyson equation method ( see , e.g. chernysheva 1988 ) .",
    "section 2 briefly outlines the method of calculation .",
    "a discussion of our results and comparisons with other calculations and experimental data are presented in section 3 .",
    "the total cross section of two - photon detachment of an electron from an atomic system by a linearly polarized light of frequency @xmath7 is @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the partial cross section for the final - state photoelectron orbital momentum @xmath17 and total orbital momentum @xmath18 , and the continuous - spectrum wavefunction of the photoelectron is normalized to the @xmath19-function of energy . for the detachment of the outer @xmath0 electron from the negative halogen ion",

    "the reduced dipole matrix elements are defined in the usual way , e.g. , in the length form , @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 s are the radial wave functions .",
    "the photoelectron angular distribution is given by the differential cross section @xmath37 where @xmath38 is measured with respect to the light polarization axis , and the asymmetry parameters @xmath39 are determined in terms of the two - photon transition amplitudes @xmath40 and scattering phases of the photoelectron @xmath41 : @xmath42 \\sqrt{[l_f^\\prime ] [ l^\\prime ] [ l_f^{\\prime \\prime } ] [ l^{\\prime \\prime } ] } \\nonumber \\\\",

    "the wavefunctions of the intermediate ( @xmath30 ) and final ( @xmath47 ) states of the photoelectron are calculated in the hf field of the frozen neutral atom residue @xmath48 .",
    "the photoelectron is coupled to the core to form the total spin @xmath49 and angular momenta @xmath50 for the intermediate @xmath51 and @xmath52 states ( @xmath53 ) , @xmath54 for the final state @xmath55 wave ( @xmath23 ) , and @xmath25 for the final - state @xmath56 wave ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "the intermediate state continua are discretized and represented by a 70-state momentum mesh with constant spacing @xmath58 .",
    "if one describes the initial state @xmath33 in the hf approximation , the asymptotic behaviour of the corresponding radial wavefunction is incorrect .",
    "namely , it is characterized by @xmath8 corresponding to the hf binding energy , rather than the exact ( experimental ) one .",
    "for example , in f@xmath3 the hf value is @xmath59 , whereas the true one is @xmath60 . as we have shown ( gribakin 1998 )",
    "is in fact much more important to have an asymptotically correct bound - state wavefucntion @xmath61 than to use correct initial state energy @xmath62 in equation ( [ me2 ] ) .",
    "the need for an asymptotically correct wavefunction was also clearly illustrated by the adiabatic hyperspherical calculation of multiphoton detachment from h@xmath3 by liu ( 1992 ) , where a 3.4% change of @xmath8 resulted in a 25% change of the two - photon cross section . in our previous paper",
    "we corrected the @xmath14 wavefunction by solving the hf equations for the f@xmath63 ground state with a small additional repulsive potential of the form @xmath64 $ ] , where the parameters @xmath65 and @xmath66 were chosen to ensure that the calculated energy was equal to the experimental value .",
    "our choice @xmath67 and @xmath68 ensured @xmath60 , and produced the asymptotic parameter @xmath69 , close to the value recommended by radtsig and smirnov ( 1986 ) .    in this work",
    "we refine the bound - state wavefunction using atomic many - body theory methods .",
    "the latter enable one to obtain a quasi - particle orbital which describes the bound electron in a many - body system from the dyson equation ( see , e.g. , chernysheva 1988 , gribakin 1990 , where it is applied to calculations of negative ions ) @xmath70 here @xmath71 is the single - particle hf hamiltonian and @xmath72 is the self - energy of the single - particle green s function . this energy - dependent non - local operator plays the role of a correlation potential , and , if known exactly , produces exact bound - state energies from equation ( [ dem ] ) . in most applications @xmath72",
    "is calculated by means of perturbation - theory expansion , and the lowest second - order contribution usually gives a considerable improvement on the hf results .",
    "note that in some sense the dyson equation provides the best single - particle orbital of the initial state for photodetachment calculations . because it is in fact a quasiparticle orbital , it incorporates certain many - body effects , namely , the ground - state correlations leading to the correct binding energy .    within the second order in the electron coulomb interaction @xmath73 the matrix element of @xmath72 between some single - electron states",
    "@xmath66 and @xmath74 looks like @xmath75 where the sums run over occupied states @xmath76 and @xmath77 , and excited states @xmath78 and @xmath79 , and the second terms in parentheses are exchange contributions .",
    "the lowest - order correction to energy of the orbital @xmath66 is given by @xmath80 calculated with @xmath81 .",
    "for all halogen negative ions the hf binding energies of the outer @xmath0 subshell are greater than the corresponding experimental electron affinities .",
    "hence , the correlation correction to the energy must be positive , which means a repulsive correlation potential . indeed ,",
    "our numerical calculations show that @xmath82 is dominated by the direct contribution in the second sum in equation ( [ sigma ] ) ( first term in parenthesis ) .",
    "for @xmath83 the sum over the occupied states is basically given by @xmath84 ( in many - body theory language this means that both holes are the outer @xmath0 subshell ) .",
    "it is obvious then that this contribution has @xmath85 in the denominator , and with a squared matrix element ( for @xmath86 ) in the numerator , it is explicitly positive .",
    "it also follows from our calculations that @xmath82 calculated in the second - order approximation overestimates the correlation correction .",
    "therefore , to obtain best ground - state orbitals for multiphoton detachment calculations we introduce a free parameter @xmath87 before the ( dominant ) direct term in the second sum of equation ( [ sigma ] ) .",
    "this parameter is then chosen to reproduce experimental values of the @xmath0 energies from the dyson equation . moreover , using different values of @xmath87 we can effectively simulate the fine - structure splitting , and obtain the wavefunctions for both fine - structure components of the @xmath88 subshell , the upper @xmath89 and lower @xmath90 , corresponding to the different binding energies . for heavier halogen negative ions ( br and i )",
    "the splitting between them becomes quite significant , and we account for different asymptotic behaviour of the corresponding radial wavefunctions in calculations of multiphoton processes . since we use @xmath82 from equation ( [ sigma ] ) in this semiempirical way , only the contributions of dominant monopole and dipole atomic excitations are included in the sums .",
    "note that the importance of large distances in multiphoton problems ( gribakin and kuchiev 1997a , 1997b ) supports the use of the length form of the photon dipole operator .",
    "this is in agreement with the results of pan ( 1990 ) who showed that the two - photon detachment cross sections obtained with the dipole operator in the velocity form are much more sensitive to the shift of the photodetachment threshold and correlation corrections , while the length form results are much more robust .",
    "the two - photon amplitudes @xmath91 ( [ me2 ] ) are calculated by direct summation over the intermediate states .",
    "it involves accurate evaluation of the free - free dipole matrix elements , and special attention is paid to pole- and @xmath19-type singularities of the integrand ( korol 1994 , 1997 ) .",
    "the main difference between the present calculation and our previous work ( gribakin 1998 ) is in the initial state @xmath14 wavefunction .",
    "the self - consistent hf calculation of the f@xmath63 ground state yields the @xmath14-electron energy @xmath92 ryd , much lower than its true value equal to the negative of the experimental electron affinity of f : @xmath93 ryd ( hotop and lineberger 1986 ) . in the previous work we used a model potential which reproduced the experimental energy , and yielded a @xmath14 wave function with the asymptotic parameters @xmath69 and @xmath60 ( cf .",
    "@xmath94 and @xmath59 for the hf wavefunction ) .    in the present work",
    "we obtain the @xmath14 wavefunction from the dyson equation ( [ dem ] ) . when @xmath72 is calculated within the second order , equation ( [ sigma ] ) , the @xmath14 energy equal to @xmath95 ryd is obtained .",
    "thus , the second - order approximation overestimates the strength of the polarization potential .",
    "when a scaling factor @xmath96 is introduced in the way outlined in sec .",
    "[ ground ] , we reproduce the experimental energy for the @xmath14 electron , and obtain an accurate dyson orbital of the @xmath14 subshell . this @xmath14 wavefunction is quite close to the hf one inside the atom , whereas for @xmath97 au it goes higher than the hf solution .",

    "the latter value of @xmath10 together with our best asymptotic parameters of the @xmath0 orbitals of the other ions are presented in table [ a ] , where they are compared with values recommended by radtsig and smirnov ( 1986 ) and nikitin and smirnov ( 1988 ) .",
    "the latter were obtained by matching the hf wave function with that possessing a correct asymptotic behaviour . unlike the use of the dyson equation with the many - body correlation potential ( even if somewhat adjusted ) , this procedure is not free from ambiguities .",

    "we neglect the fine - structure splitting for f@xmath3 and cl@xmath3 .",
    "the results of calculations of the two - photon detachment cross section and photoelectron angular distribution in f@xmath3 are presented in figures [ fcross ] and [ fangul1 ] .",
    "our results obtained using the hf @xmath14 orbital ( the hf two - photon threshold is at @xmath110 ryd ) are about 10% higher than the similar dipole length lowest - order hf results of pan ( 1990 ) .",
    "a possible source of this discrepancy was discussed in our previous paper ( gribakin 1998 ) , where we proposed that it could be associated with the fact that pan ( 1990 ) used the roothaan - hf expansion of the bound state . according to them",
    "electron correlation effects suppress the cross section in f@xmath3 by about 20% at the maximum .",
    "when we use the experimental energy of the @xmath14 electron together with the hf wavefunctions the magnitude of the two - photon cross section changes very little , as seen earlier by pan ( 1990 ) for both hf and correlated results ( dotted line in figure [ fcross ] ) .",
    "the hf results of crance ( 1987a ) are close to the above .",
    "the cross section of van der hart ( 1996 ) obtained within the @xmath5-matrix floquet approach is 30% higher ( dash - dotted line in figure [ fcross ] ) with a maximum of @xmath111 au at @xmath112 ryd .",

    "wavefunction , which had a larger value of @xmath10 , the cross section was about three times larger than the hf results ( gribakin 1998 ) . as follows from the adiabatic theory ( gribakin and kuchiev 1997a , 1997b ) , for a given @xmath8 the @xmath4-photon cross section is proportional to @xmath113 . ] .",
    "this cross section is shown by solid line in figure [ fcross ] , and we consider this to be our best evaluation of the cross section for f@xmath3 .",
    "the cusp on the curve at the single - photon threshold is a wigner threshold effect .",
    "it is a consequence of the abrupt threshold dependence @xmath114 of the @xmath51-wave single - photon detachment channel , which opens at this energy .",
    "the only other work that used an asymptotically correct @xmath14 wavefunction was the model potential calculation of robinson and geltman ( 1967 ) , which produced a cross section two times greater than those of crance , pan and van der hart .",
    "the results of robinson and geltman ( full squares in figure [ fcross ] ) are much closer to our results in comparison with all others .",
    "thus , we see that in _",
    "multiphoton _ processes the error introduced by using a bound - state wavefunction with an incorrect asymptotic behaviour could be much greater then the effects of electron correlations . of course , the difference between the experimental and hf energies is also a manifestation of electron correlation effects .",
    "it influences the result via the asymptotic behaviour of the ground - state wavefunction , and we see that this is the most important correlation effect in multiphoton detachment . the use of the asymptotically correct @xmath14 wavefunction changes the cross section by a factor of two and more , which is much greater than other correlation effects ( pan 1990 ) .",
    "this fact distinguishes this problem from the single - photon processes , where other correlation effects are essential .",
    "the angular asymmetry parameters @xmath45 and @xmath46 calculated using the dyson @xmath14-state wavefunction are shown in figure [ fangul1 ] .",
    "they reveal an interesting dependence on the photon energy with sign changes and cusps at the single - photon detachment threshold .",
    "figure [ fangul1 ] also presents the experimental points of blondel and delsart ( 1993 ) obtained at @xmath115 ryd , and the correlated dipole length results of pan and starace ( 1991 ) at the same energy .",
    "the asymmetry parameters ( [ beta ] ) are relative quantities , and the results of different calculations are much closer for them than for the absolute values of the photodetachment cross sections .",
    "thus , our present results are practically equal to those obtained in the model @xmath14 wavefunction calculation ( gribakin 1998 ) .",
    "there we also showed that the results from the analytical adiabatic theory ( gribakin and kuchiev 1997b ) are in good agreement with the numerical results from other approaches , including the plane - wave approximation , especially in @xmath46 .",
    "it appears that this parameter is on the whole less sensitive to the details of the calculation , because it is simply proportional to the amplitude of @xmath56 wave emission , and there are no interference terms in expression ( [ beta ] ) for @xmath46 .",
    "the experimental values of @xmath116 for f@xmath3 obtained in the earlier work of blondel ( 1992 ) are close to those of blondel and delsart ( 1993 ) .",
    "this is why f@xmath3 serves as a good benchmark for angular asymmetry calculations .",
    "figure [ fangul1 ] shows that our present calculations with the dyson @xmath14 wavefunction is in good agreement with experiment .",

    "this is why our total cross section , obtained as a sum @xmath146 , goes between the robinson and geltman and hf curves .",
    "the plane - wave approximation cross section of crance ( 1988 ) has a much higher maximum than all of the results presented in the figure .    as regards the photoelectron angular distribution , the asymmetry parameters for the @xmath106 and @xmath107 sublevels have similar dependences on the photon energy ( see figure [ brangul ] ) .",
    "they also follow the general trends observed for f@xmath3 and cl@xmath3 .",
    "the experimental data points of blondel ( 1992 ) obtained at @xmath115 ryd agree well with our calculations , except for the @xmath46 parameter in the @xmath107 detachment channel .",
    "our calculation demonstrates better agreement with experiment than the plane - wave approximation , or that which includes the first born correction ( blondel 1992 ) .",
    "the two - photon detachment calculation for i@xmath3 are performed in the same way as for br@xmath3 .",
    "the experimental energies of the @xmath109 and @xmath147 fine - structure sublevels in i@xmath3 are @xmath148 ryd and @xmath149 ryd , respectively ( hotop and lineberger 1985 , radtsig and smirnov 1986 ) .",
    "the hf approximation yields @xmath150 ryd .",
    "the dyson orbital of the @xmath109 state is obtained using the coefficient @xmath151 . in @xmath72 .",
    "it yields the experimental @xmath109 state energy , and the wavefunction with asymptotic parameters @xmath152 and @xmath153 au .",
    "the same calculations with @xmath154 reproduces the experimental @xmath147 energy , and produces a wavefunction with @xmath155 and @xmath156 au . using these ground - state wavefunctions together with the hf sets of the intermediate and final state hf wavefunctions we calculate the two - photon detachment amplitudes ( [ me1 ] ) and ( [ me2 ] ) for the @xmath109 and @xmath147 electrons , and",
    "obtain the total and differential cross sections ( [ jcr ] ) and ( [ jdcr ] ) .",
    "the cross sections are shown in figure [ icross ] . due to a larger difference in the binding energies the effect of non - statistical ratio between the maxima of the @xmath157 and",
    "@xmath158 cross sections is even more noticeable here than in br . in i@xmath3 their ratio in the region below the single - photon threshold",
    "is about @xmath159 instead of the statistical @xmath145 .",
    "the hf threshold is located between the two fine - structure thresholds .",
    "nevertheless , the sum @xmath146 would rise above the hf curve . on the other hand",
    ", it would be close but still lower than the model - potential results of robinson and geltman ( 1967 ) .",
    "the plane - wave calculations ( crance 1988 ) give an even higher cross section at the maximum .",
    "the angular distribution parameters are presented in figure [ iangul ] . for the @xmath109 electron detachment from i@xmath3",
    "there are two measuments at the photon energy of 0.171 ryd ( blondel 1992 , blondel and delsart 1993 ) , and the more recent one shows a much better agreement with our calculations . if we speculate that the earlier measurement for the @xmath147 fine - structure component was affected by the spurious background in a way similar to that seen in the @xmath109 data , larger absolute values of @xmath116 could be expected for the @xmath147 detachment measurements .",
    "this will bring them in better agreement with our calculated values ( figure [ iangul ] b ) . as for the @xmath126 parameters calculated in the plane - wave approach and with the first born correction",
    ", they show large scatter , similar to that seen in cl and br .",
    "it means that the potential between the photoelectron and the atom should be included non - perturbatively , at least at the hf level , as in the present calculation . of course , for a more accurate description one will have to include correlation effects , e.g. , the electron - atom polarization potential .",
    "in the present paper we have performed direct numerical calculations of the two - photon detachment from the halogen negative ions .",
    "we paid special attention to the proper description of the initial ground state wavefunction , namely , its correct asymptotic behaviour .",
    "the outer @xmath0 ground - state orbitals of the negative ions were calculated from the many - body theory dyson equation with the non - local correlation potential adjusted to reproduce experimental binding energies .",
    "we have confirmed the understanding based on the adiabatic theory ( gribakin and kuchiev 1997a , 1997b , gribakin 1998 ) that using asymptotically correct initial state wavefunctions is especially important for the absolute values of the multiphoton detachment cross sections .    for heavier halogen negative ions ( br and i ) our calculations reveal substantial non - statistical branching of photodetachment into the @xmath160 and @xmath161 final atomic states .",
    "this effect is mainly a consequence of the different asymptotic behaviour of the corresponding outer negative ion orbitals @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "our calculations also predict the existence of prominent cusps in the two - photon detachment cross sections and angular asymmetry parameters at the single - photon detachment thresholds .",
    "our cross sections are in general closer to those obtained by robinson and geltman ( 1967 ) , who worked within a model - potential approach and used asymptotically correct bound - state wavefunctions .",
    "our calculations of the photoelectron angular asymmetry parameters give best overall agreement with the measurements of blondel ( 1992 ) and blondel and delsart ( 1993 ) at the photon energy of 0.171 ryd .",
    "this work was supported by the australian research council .",
