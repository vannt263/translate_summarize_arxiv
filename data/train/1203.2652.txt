    "as an alternative to the standard formulation of quantum theory in terms of vectors in a hilbert space , it is possible to express quantum states , transformations , and measurements as functions on some state space .",
    "the most common of such representations is the wigner function  @xcite , which represents the quantum state of a particle as a distribution over the classical phase space of the particle .",
    "however , this function can not be interpreted as a probability distribution as it takes on negative values .",
    "such descriptions are referred to as _ quasiprobability representations _  @xcite .    the occurrence of negative probabilities in the description of a quantum state or measurement is often thought of as an indication of `` quantum - ness ''  @xcite .",
    "conversely , any state or measurement that can be described by non - negative ( true ) probabilities is sometimes said to be `` classical '' . for the wigner function of particle mechanics , hudson s theorem shows that a pure quantum state has a non - negative wigner function if and only if it is a gaussian state  @xcite .",
    "the discrete wigner function extends these results to finite - dimensional quantum systems . for finite odd dimensions , the only pure states with non - negative wigner functions are stabilizer states  @xcite .",
    "negative distributions , on the other hand , are nonclassical in the sense that they are contextual  @xcite and can serve as a resource for quantum computation  @xcite .",
    "however , preparing a system in a quantum state described by a non - negative wigner function is neither a necessary or sufficient condition to say that this system is classical .",
    "it is not necessary , because the wigner function is only one possible quasiprobability representation of quantum theory .",
    "one can construct a quasiprobability representation in which any individual state or measurement has a non - negative distribution .",
    "it is also not sufficient , as it is possible to make all quantum states have non - negative distributions , but this forces the conditional probabilities of some measurements to take on negative values  @xcite . to say that a system has a classical description , we require the set of preparations , transformations , and measurements we are considering to all",
    "have nonnegative distributions in a quasiprobability representation .",
    "consequently , we aim to determine what _ subtheories _ of quantum mechanics ( i.e. , theories constructed from closed subsets of quantum states , transformations and measurements ) are non - negative in some quasiprobability representation , or , alternatively , can be described `` classically '' .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a particular class of subtheories containing orthonormal bases both as a set of preparations and as a projective measurement . for a fixed quasiprobability representation ,",
    "if the distributions corresponding to the states in an orthonormal basis and the projective measurement in the basis are all non - negative , we refer to the basis as _ non - negative_.    the question we are then considering is what sets of bases can be simultaneously non - negative in some quasiprobability representation .",
    "additionally , we would like to determine what groups of unitary transformations permute a set of non - negative bases , as it then seems likely that circuits composed of such gates can be efficiently simulated . while our results are primarily applicable to single systems , we believe that these results may be important in the pursuit of additional classically - simulatable subtheories of multiple systems .",
    "at present , we know of very few nontrivial sets of quantum gates that can be efficiently simulated on a classical computer , such as the clifford group and matchgate circuits . finding other subsets of gates that are also efficiently simulatable may provide key insights into the nature of quantum computation and the origin of any advantage of quantum computation over classical computation .    while our results are derived in the context of single systems , it is important to note that several interesting questions remain on the `` quantum '' nature of single systems , as demonstrated by a range of phenomena such as the proof of contextuality for a single qubit  @xcite , models of quantum computation that use only one `` clean '' qubit  @xcite and recent results on the distillability of magic states  @xcite .",

    "in this section we motivate the study of quasiprobability representations , and non - negative subtheories within them , from a foundational perspective based on ontological models .",
    "we present our formalism for quasiprobability representations , and prove some elementary properties that any such representation of quantum mechanics must satisfy .",
    "one approach to explaining the predictions of quantum mechanics is to formulate an ontological model ( i.e. , a hidden variable model ) that reproduces some or all of the measurement statistics of quantum theory .",
    "such a model is defined over some ontic state space @xmath2 .",
    "preparations of quantum states correspond to probability measures @xmath3 over @xmath2 .",
    "measurements correspond to sets of conditional measurement probabilities @xmath4 of observing an outcome @xmath5 given that a system is in the ontic state @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "a desirable feature of such a model is a revised notion of noncontextuality  , so that each preparation as a density operator corresponds to a single probability distribution and each measurement effect corresponds to a unique conditional probability  @xcite .",
    "while no noncontextual ontological model can reproduce all of quantum mechanics , it may be possible to define a noncontextual ontological model for a subtheory .",
    "such a subtheory may still capture some of the essential phenomena of quantum mechanics .",
    "for example , the set of states , transformations , and measurements with gaussian wigner distributions in particle mechanics can be described by a noncontextual ontological model  @xcite . for finite odd dimensions ,",
    "the single qudit subtheory consisting of stabilizer states and measurements has an ontological model , namely the discrete wigner function  @xcite restricted to this set  @xcite .",
    "spekkens toy theory  @xcite also provides an ontological model that is in many ways analogous to the stabilizer subtheory of a single qubit . despite being `` classical ''",
    ", these models allow a variety of information processing tasks typically associated with quantum mechanics , such as quantum teleportation and dense coding ; see  @xcite .    an alternate but related approach to explaining quantum mechanical predictions",
    "is to use a quasiprobability representation . as with an ontological model , a quasiprobability representation",
    "is defined over a state space @xmath2 ( often , but not necessarily , a classical phase space ) which can be interpreted as an ontic state space , and it associates preparations and measurements with distributions and conditional distributions , respectively , over @xmath2 .",
    "a quasiprobability representation is a faithful representation of the density operators and measurement effects of quantum theory  that is , the map from operators on hilbert space to distributions on @xmath2 is linear and injective .",
    "such representations can maintain noncontextuality but nevertheless reproduce the quantum predictions because , unlike ontological models , the distributions corresponding to such preparations and measurements are allowed to take on negative values ( thus the term `` quasiprobability '' ) .",
    "that is , nonnegativity of distributions on ontic states is the classical assumption dropped by quasiprobability representations in order to reproduce the predictions of quantum theory",
    ".    a quasiprobability representation of quantum mechanics can not be non - negative for all preparations and measurements ; this fact is equivalent to the fact that an ontological model of quantum mechanics can not be noncontextual  @xcite .",
    "however , a quasiprobability representation can be non - negative for a subtheory of quantum mechanics ; specifically , the preparations , transformations and measurements within the subtheory can all possess non - negative probability distributions .",
    "in such cases , the quasiprobability representation provides a noncontextual ontological model for this subtheory .",
    "that is , the existence of a noncontextual ontological model for a subtheory and a quasiprobability representation that is non - negative for a subtheory are equivalent notions  @xcite . throughout this paper",
    ", we will restrict our language ( for the most part ) to that of quasiprobability representations and the possible existence of non - negative subtheories within them , although the reader should keep in mind that results for non - negative subtheories in quasiprobability representations apply identically to a perspective of noncontextual ontological models for such subtheories .",
    "an example of a quasiprobability representation frequently used in quantum optics is the wigner function .",

    "the upper bound from theorem  [ thm : qudit_final ] is 16 states , and even excluding the combinations of @xmath3 discussed above only reduces the upper bound to 14 states .",

    "moreover , if there are four non - negative bases , then they must correspond to the vertices of a right cuboid circumscribed by the bloch sphere .",
    "we provided an exhaustive list of all `` classical '' subtheories of a qubit that include states , measurements and nontrivial transformations .",
    "these cases revealed several interesting features .",
    "both families of three bases that are permuted by a nontrivial unitary group can only be non - negative in a quasiprobability representation when they are sufficiently `` far '' from being coplanar .",

    "are non - negative in some quasiprobability representation even when @xmath417 ( i.e. , the three bases are almost degenerate ) .",
    "we have also found that whenever a subtheory of qubit states and measurements are non - negative in some quasiprobability representation , there exists a quasiprobability representation in which all unitary transformations that permute non - negative states correspond to a permutation of the ontic states .",
    "while we have primarily focused on the qubit case , we have also shown that the results for qubits directly generalize in that any three mutually non - orthogonal non - negative bases in a quasiprobability distribution must be disparate and any four or more mutually non - orthogonal non - negative bases must either by disparate or satisfy a symmetry constraint . in this sense , quantum states and measurements with a small amount of complementarity",
    "can be quite difficult to model in a classical theory .",
    "in addition , we have obtained an upper bound of @xmath0 on the number of states that are elements of a non - negative basis .",
    "we conclude with some discussion of the implications of our results for quantum computation , and some future research directions . while our results have been presented in the context of single qudits , they are equally applicable to multiple qudit systems . our upper bound on the number of non - negative basis states of a qudit , although quite loose , suggests that universal quantum computation leads to negativity in _ any _ quasiprobability distribution .",
    "this matches the intuition obtained from the specific case of the single qudit discrete wigner function  @xcite .",
    "while our higher - dimensional results can be applied to quasiprobability representations of multiple qubit systems , it is not clear how this approach accords with classical simulations of quantum systems . in particular",
    ", multi - qubit stabilizers can be efficiently simulated classically  @xcite and yet do not correspond to a set of non - negative bases in any quasiprobability representation . to see this , note that stabilizer states and @xmath132 and @xmath418 measurements ( i.e. , in bases corresponding to stabilizer states ) can lead to violations of a bell inequality  @xcite and",
    "so can not admit a locally causal model .    a natural way of generalizing a quasiprobability representation for a single qubit to one for multiple qubits is to take tensor products of the operators @xmath7 and @xmath10 that define the single qubit quasiprobability representation via eq .   and .",
    "by construction , such a quasiprobability representation will be non - negative for all tensor products of the single qubit states with non - negative distributions , but may also be non - negative for other bases that include entangled states . for the entangled states to be accessible in a classical subtheory , there must be some unitary that permutes non - negative bases and maps a non - negative product basis to a non - negative basis that contains an entangled state .",
    "such a unitary can only be viewed as supervening on a permutation of ontic states ( which could always be done for a single qubit ) if it leaves the set of tensor products of the @xmath7 invariant under conjugation .",
    "unfortunately , it is unclear whether such unitaries exist for any set of operators that define our single qubit quasiprobability representations , although based on the results of @xcite we have some evidence to suggest that they do not .",
