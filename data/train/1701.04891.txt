    "quantum tomography as a way of inferring a quantum state is potentially the most precise measuring tool available to a physicist @xcite .",
    "however , this tool requires rather precise tuning .",
    "one needs to know characteristics of the measurement setup which necessarily involves a calibration of it .",
    "generally , it is quite a nontrivial task equivalent to quantum process tomography of the detecting system . provided that one can describe the setup with the few - parameter model ( such as efficiency and dark count rate of detectors , etc . ) , it is possible in some cases to perform the calibration without a complete set of known probes by trading some information about the probe for knowledge about the detector .",
    "for example , with a twin - photon state , one can find the absolute value of the detecting setup efficiency  @xcite ; entanglement also makes possible `` self - testing '' or `` blind tomography ''  @xcite .",
    "trading knowledge of probes ( preferably of the most general nature , such as gaussianity ) for information about the measurement gave rise to the concept of self - sufficient , or self - calibrating tomography @xcite .",
    "however , there is a possibility of skipping the calibration stage altogether .",
    "this possibility is given by the data - pattern tomography  @xcite .",
    "the idea of this method is somewhat similar to that of optical image analysis with a known optical response function  @xcite .",
    "an observer measures responses ( the data patterns ) for a set of known quantum probe states and matches them with the response obtained from the unknown signal of interest .",
    "the data - pattern tomography can also be understood as a search for the optimal state estimator over the subspace that is spanned by the probe states .",
    "this approach is naturally insensitive to imperfections of the measurement setup since all device imperfections are automatically incorporated into and accounted for by the measured data patterns .",
    "the data - pattern scheme was recently successfully realized with few - photon signals and coherent probes and was shown to be quite robust  @xcite .",
    "the efficiency of data - pattern tomography depends essentially on the choice of the basis set of probe states .",
    "it is highly desirable to use the smallest possible number of basis states .",
    "if the observer believes that the signal state is very likely residing in some operator subspace , he or she can make use of this insight to define the set of probe states that spans this subspace for data - pattern reconstruction  @xcite . naturally , the accuracy of the method depends crucially on the accuracy of the signal representation .",
    "systematic error intrinsic in the method is unavoidably amplified in the process of the signal inference since both probe and signal patterns are subject to statistical errors .    here",
    "we show that such an amplification of errors would not lead to breaking of essentially quantum features of the state .",
    "such a fragile feature as the entanglement survives the inference procedure , and for sufficiently high accuracy of the representation the fidelity of the signal reconstructions for the large number of signal state copies tends to the values close to the fidelity given by the representation .",
    "our simulation shows that this number of copies stands well within the region of experimental feasibility .",
    "moreover , entanglement is not broken even for a comparatively low number of signal copies , when infidelity is several times higher than the infidelity of the representation ( which is rather remarkable if one takes into account the main feature of the data - pattern approach : the density matrix of the signal is approximated by the mixture of nonorthogonal projectors ) .",
    "so the data - pattern scheme is quite feasible and reliable also for the reconstruction of multimodal states .",
    "also , we show that the representation of the signal in terms of the classical probe basis is quite robust with respect to the noise of the representation weights .    the outline of the article is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : basis ] we review the basics of the data - pattern scheme and discuss the selection criteria of optimal basis sets .",
    "after that , we analyze different basis sets of coherent states for the representation of single - mode states as the initial simple problem and entangled double - mode states with a small average number of photons .",
    "next , in sec .",
    "[ sec : analysis ] , the quality of such expansions based on the sets with optimal parameters is discussed .",
    "we analyze the stability of this procedure to the noise and evaluate entanglement and the purity of the represented states .",
    "last , but not least , in sec .",
    "[ sec : reconstruction ] we present simulations of the procedure of data - pattern reconstruction using optimal sets of coherent projectors for single - mode and entangled double - mode states and demonstrate the survival of entanglement .",
    "in this section , we consider the representation of optical quantum states based on the discrete basis set in data - pattern tomography . from a practical point of view , it is essential to find optimal basis sets with the minimum possible number of coherent projectors for the representation .",
    "however , to our knowledge , the optimization of the basis choice has not yet been fully discussed and analyzed ( here one can point to only two preliminary recent works @xcite ) . in experiments",
    "@xcite the reconstruction was done by considering only a set of probe states that was _ a priori _ deemed sufficiently large ( from @xmath0 to @xmath1 ) .",
    "we analyze the applicability of different sets of probe states for data - pattern tomography . for the chosen basis set",
    ", the efficiency of the reconstruction could be enhanced using , for example , the adaptive bayesian procedure @xcite .",
    "first of all , let us consider the general principles of the data - pattern scheme .",
    "we assume that there is an appropriately chosen finite set of probe states which can be described by the density operators @xmath2 , where @xmath3 .",
    "we would like to reconstruct the true signal state described by the density operator @xmath4 .",
    "the key point of the discussion is the possibility to fit the signal @xmath4 with a mixture of probes , @xmath5 where @xmath6 are real coefficients . in order to proceed with the reconstruction , an observer carries out a number of some measurements on the unknown signal state @xmath4 and a predefined set of probe states @xmath7 .",
    "the outcome @xmath8 in the @xmath9-th measurement can be described by positive operator - valued measures ( povm ) @xmath10 , @xmath11 p^{(\\rho)}_{jk}=tr(\\pi_{jk}\\rho ) , \\end{array}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 are probabilities for the probe @xmath13 or signal @xmath4 .",
    "such measurements under a finite number of signal and probe copies result in frequency distributions @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : scheme ] ) , which represent the data patterns for the signal state and the probe states , respectively .",
    "so from eqs .",
    "and   one has that the representation coefficients @xmath6 can be found by fitting the signal data pattern with probe data patterns : @xmath16 taking into account the physical constraints imposed on the density operator @xmath17 [ @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 .",
    "these constraints imply fulfillment of the following conditions for estimated coefficients : @xmath21    the possibility of accurate data - pattern reconstruction is closely related to the representation  . having preliminary information or making a reasonable guess",
    "about the class of plausible signal states ( such as the upper limit on the average photon number ) allows one to make the reconstruction using an appropriately chosen set of probe states spanning required subspace .",
    "the problem of the optimal basis - state selection naturally arises . to solve this problem",
    "our research presented here follows certain selection criteria imposed on the basis states @xmath22 .",
    "first of all , for practical purposes , it is advisable to use probe states that can be easily generated in the laboratory and provide an accurate representation of an unknown signal state .",
    "it was shown in previous works on the data - pattern scheme in the single - mode case that the usual coherent states satisfy these practical requirements rather well for a wide class of signal states  @xcite .",
    "notice that some time ago considerable attention was paid to representing nonclassical quantum states in terms of the nonorthogonal basis of pure quantum states ( here one can mention , for example , classical works @xcite ) .",
    "more recently , a number of works on representing entangled states using such coherent bases has appeared ( for example , @xcite ) . in the current work",
    ", we are implementing a quite different approach : a representation of the density matrix of the signal in terms of coherent - state projectors .",
    "second , it is desirable to use the smallest possible number of probe states in order to minimize computational resources for reconstruction of an unknown signal state . in subsequent research",
    "we use the fidelity @xmath23 as the measure of quality of representation  @xcite .",
    "aiming for practical applications , we require the accuracy of representation   to be greater than experimental measurement precision .",
    "it is not possible to evaluate the required accuracy precisely , but errors in recent works  @xcite on the data - pattern scheme may be taken as the reference point for our estimations . having relative experimental errors on the scale of several percent , we determine the required precision of the expansion   to be an order of magnitude greater .",
    "thus , the criterion of the required accuracy of the representation can be expressed as @xmath24 . notice that states that are close in terms of fidelity may have rather different physical properties , as has been shown theoretically and experimentally , for example , in  @xcite .",
    "so , when judging the quality of the state representation , we estimate also purity and the entanglement .",
    "third , the set of basis states must be suitable for representation of a wide range of quantum states with required precision . in this paper , we consider the broad class of states with small average number of photons which are widely used and applied in quantum cryptography and quantum computing  @xcite .",
    "next , we shall analyze the optimal basis sets of coherent projectors for the single - mode case as the initial simple problem .",
    "after that , based on the results obtained , we shall consider the case of entangled double - mode states .",
    "first , we consider the selection of the optimal basis sets for the single - mode case as the initial problem .",
    "for this case we analyze the expansion for the single - photon state , the coherent state with amplitude @xmath25 , the even coherent state ( the so - called `` schrdinger s kitten '' state ) @xmath26 , and the superposition of the vacuum and the single - photon states .",
    "we assume the basis sets @xmath27 , where @xmath28 are amplitudes of coherent projectors . to solve the formulated problem we use cvx for matlab , a package for specifying and solving convex programs  @xcite .",
    "the disciplined convex programming methodology is implemented in this system .",
    "it is assumed that one follows certain rules specifying a problem .",
    "if we take into account joint concavity of the fidelity @xmath29 in two arguments  @xcite , it can be verified that the problem of expansion formulated above satisfies the whole set of rules . to improve convergence ,",
    "we impose additional constraints on the absolute values of the coefficients @xmath30 : @xmath31 .",
    "it is most natural to select the discrete sets of coherent states @xmath27 by constructing _ the square lattice _ near the origin on the phase plane with the axes representing the values of the real and imaginary parts of complex amplitudes @xmath32 .",
    "let us discuss now the possibility of representing single - mode quantum states based on these states and find the optimal sets , which meet the above - mentioned criteria .",
    "the optimization parameters of these basis sets are the number of nodes along each axis @xmath33 and grid pitch @xmath34 .",
    "the increase in the accuracy of representation is provided by the increase in the number of nodes @xmath35 ( the number of coherent projectors ) and the decrease in grid pitch @xmath34 since the recognition of small - scale details on the phase plane requires advanced resolution . on the other hand , filling a large area of the phase plain with the lattice with small @xmath34 requires an excessive number of basis states .",
    "this means that there are some optimal values of the number of nodes along each axis @xmath33 and grid pitch @xmath34 .",
    "the dependencies of the fidelity on the parameters @xmath33 and @xmath34 enable us to find the optimal parameters of the square lattice taking into account the criterion of the required accuracy of the representation ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "the analysis of the representation   for the above - mentioned signal states enables us to determine optimal parameters in this case : @xmath37 , @xmath38 .",
    "notice that choosing probes not on the simple square grid but in a more sophisticated way may , in fact , lead to better accuracy with a smaller number of probes . for the signal with a small average number of photons we also consider the sets of coherent states chosen in the helical grid on the phase plane @xcite .",
    "all probe states are equidistant in radius and angle ; we optimize the number of nodes @xmath33 , the step of the radial distance @xmath39 , and the step of the angle @xmath40 , with @xmath41 .",
    "the optimization procedure for this set of probes gives the following optimal parameters : @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 .",
    "one can see that the use of the helical grid with optimal parameters requires indeed a smaller number of states in comparison with the square lattice .",
    "the analysis of the representation   given above is for pure states .",
    "however , obviously , the expansion   holds for mixed states as well .",
    "let us demonstrate how the accuracy of the representation fares with the mixed states .",
    "for this purpose , we analyze the fidelity of the representation for the mixed states @xmath45 ( @xmath46 $ ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : mixed - single ] shows that the fidelities of the representation of mixed states exceed the minimum required accuracy for optimal basis sets of coherent projectors in the cases of the square lattice and the helical grid .",
    "this analysis confirms that the method considered works appropriately for mixed states as well .       of the square lattice of coherent projectors : ( a ) the number of nodes along each axis @xmath47 ; ( b ) the number of nodes along each axis @xmath48 .",
    "the predefined double - mode states are @xmath49 with @xmath25 ( black bars ) , @xmath50 ( dark gray bars ) , @xmath51 ( light gray bars).,width=325 ]    now let us move to the consideration of the multimode case .",
    "since we are aiming , primarily , to show how the entanglement survives the data - pattern inference , we restrict ourselves to the double - mode case .",
    "the representations are analyzed for the following states : @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "we choose the basis sets @xmath54 as the tensor product of the coherent states selected in the nodes of the square lattice on the phase plane .",
    "the parameters to optimize are the number of nodes along each axis @xmath33 and grid pitch @xmath34 for the two modes .",
    "accurate representation   of states that are the tensor product of pure single - mode states is possible for the parameters found in the previous section ( @xmath47 , @xmath38 ) since @xmath55  @xcite .",
    "intuitively , in the two - mode case it is natural to expect some nontrivial complication due to the presence of entanglement .",
    "we analyze the expansions   for the pure entangled states mentioned above in this section .",
    "the results presented in fig .  [ fig : fidel - double ] indicate that , indeed , the representation of entangled double - mode states requires a greater number of nodes along each axis @xmath33 than in the single - mode case .",
    "this figure demonstrates that a representation with fidelity @xmath36 is possible for the sets with the following optimal parameters : @xmath48 , @xmath56 .",
    "it is also useful to demonstrate that the method considered works properly for mixed states in this case .",
    "for this reason , we consider the expansion of the state with the density operator @xmath57 ( @xmath46 $ ] ) .",
    "an analysis of the fidelities of the representation of these states confirms that optimal basis sets of coherent projectors are appropriate for the accurate expansion of mixed states as well ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : mixed - double ] ) .",
    "we close this section by noting that the basis sets of coherent projectors found are applicable for the essentially accurate representation of single - mode and entangled double - mode states with a small average number of photons .",
    "we note that the achieved precision of the representation  , @xmath24 , indicates that these optimal sets of probe states can reliably represent a wide class of signal states .",
    "this circumstance allows us to expect that these sets of coherent projectors may be successfully implemented in data - pattern tomography of single - mode and entangled double - mode states effectively .",

    "in this section we consider the quality of the expansion   using discrete sets of coherent projectors .",
    "since any real measurements are connected with the noise of different sources , it is essential to analyze the stability of the representation using the basis sets considered .",
    "after that , we shall analyze the conservation of entanglement for the expansion based on the optimal discrete sets .",
    "last , the purity of the expansions is investigated based on the analysis of their eigenvalues .      analyzing the stability of the reconstructions using the optimal basis sets ,",

    "it is not obvious that the expansion   based on the set of coherent projectors conserves the entanglement . in order to demonstrate this , we estimate entanglement for the same states represented using the square lattice of basis states .",
