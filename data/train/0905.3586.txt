    "the chirally invariant overlap formulation is known to have advantageous topological and continuum properties in the fundamental representation @xcite , but much less is known in higher dimensional representations .",
    "a naive use of the atiyah - singer index theorem at finite lattice spacing may lead to fractional topological charge @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the trace normalization factor of the representation and @xmath17 is the index of the dirac operator , if @xmath17 is not an integer multiple of @xmath18 .    here",
    "we study the 2-index symmetric ( sextet ) representation of @xmath0 in the quenched approximation . in this case",
    "this model has been considered previously in @xcite .",
    "our motivations for this work are twofold .",
    "first , the theory of @xmath20 fermions in the sextet of @xmath0 is a promising candidate for a walking technicolor model @xcite .",
    "the @xmath21 theory certainly breaks chiral symmetry and is a good testing ground for chiral and/or topological properties of sextet overlap fermions before addressing dynamical questions such as the infrared properties of the @xmath20 theory .",
    "results on non - abelian gauge theories with fermions in higher dimensional representations have been reported in @xcite .",
    "second , in @xmath22 @xmath23 super - yang - mills theory the gaugino condensate involving @xmath24 gaugino fields is non - zero due to the contribution of instantons to this correlation function since there are @xmath24 adjoint zero modes for a charge @xmath25 instanton .",
    "the general expectation is that the bilinear gaugino condensate is non - zero as well @xcite .",
    "however it is not clear if this non - zero value can be attributed to some special class of configurations if periodic boundary conditions are used .",
    "since the fermionic definition of the topological charge can lead to fractional values at finite lattice spacing as mentioned above , it is worth investigating what happens to these configurations in the continuum limit .",
    "if the fractional value @xmath26 does survive the continuum limit with periodic boundary conditions they potentially can explain the non - zero value of the bilinear gaugino condensate on @xmath27 .",
    "this would then be similar to the case of @xmath28 where fractional topological charge configurations do exist and it has been argued that these can explain the gaugino condensate @xcite .",
    "the main result of our paper is that once periodic boundary conditions are imposed , configurations where @xmath29 is not an integer disappear in the continuum limit . in the continuum",
    "all @xmath0 configurations respect the sextet index theorem , i.e. zero modes come in 5-tuples , furthermore the topological charge defined by the sextet index agrees with the one from the fundamental index and is an integer .",
    "although we have only measured the sextet and fundamental index for @xmath0 with periodic boundary conditions the following property of continuum gauge fields provides an opportunity to address the supersymmetric case of @xmath1 as well .",
    "an @xmath22 gauge field can always be deformed to lie in an @xmath1 subgroup and the representation then can be decomposed with respect to this subgroup . in our case",
    "the decomposition of the sextet of @xmath0 contains both the fundamental and adjoint of @xmath1 .",
    "this observation leads to the conclusion that in @xmath1 gauge theory the fundamental and adjoint index theorems both give the same definition of the topological charge in the continuum .",
    "in particular , the charge is an integer .",
    "consequently , the bilinear gaugino condensate can not be attributed to fractionally charged configurations subject to periodic boundary conditions .",
    "although we have not investigated other higher dimensional representations , we conjecture that our findings hold more generally .",
    "specifically , in a large periodic box , ( 1 ) the fermionic definition of the topological charge @xmath30 will always be an integer and ( 2 ) two definitions from two different representations will agree in the continuum limit .",
    "the adjoint representation of @xmath1 was investigated directly in @xcite and a slight increase has been reported in the probability of finding a configuration with adjoint index @xmath31 , suggesting @xmath32 , as the lattice spacing decreased at fixed physical volume .",
    "this raised the possibility that the probability stays finite in the continuum limit .",
    "we will show however that if the lattice spacing is too large the decrease in this probability with decreasing lattice spacing is quite small and can easily be confused with a slight increase at low statistics . a more consistent decrease of the probability with decreasing lattice spacing",
    "does however set in for sufficiently small lattice spacing .",
    "the atiyah - singer index theorem in the continuum states that @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the index of the dirac operator in representation @xmath35 , @xmath36 is its trace normalization factor and @xmath37 is the topological charge of the underlying gauge field . at",
    "finite lattice spacing a gluonic definition of @xmath37 is not available in general but the above relation can be employed to define it using the overlap operator which possesses exact chiral zero modes @xcite .",
    "clearly , two different representations may lead to different charges for the same configuration . also , if @xmath38 the fermionic definition may lead to non - integer charge . in the fundamental representation",
    "this problem does not arise because @xmath39 and the fermionic definition always gives an integer charge ( different choices for the negative wilson mass may still lead to different integers but in the continuum limit the charge will not be sensitive to this choice ) .",
    "for gauge group @xmath22 the @xmath16 factors for some of the most frequently used representations are given by , [ t ] t_f = , t_adj = n , t_s = , t_a = , where @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 refer to the fundamental , adjoint , 2-index symmetric and 2-index anti - symmetric representations , respectively . the index for @xmath22 will be denoted by @xmath44 . unless otherwise indicated @xmath37 and @xmath17 will stand for the absolute value of these quantities .",
    "we have measured the index of the dirac operator in both the fundamental and sextet representation in the quenched approximation at 5 different lattice spacings at the same physical volume . for a similar study in the fundamental representation only , see @xcite .",
    "the index was obtained by calculating the first few eigenvalues of the dirac operator until a non - zero eigenvalue is found and checking whether they are chiral or not .",
    "zero modes are clearly identified by their chirality being @xmath46 whereas non - zero modes have 0 chirality just as in the continuum .",
    "the non - zero eigenvalues carry important chiral information encoded in the banks - casher relation and random matrix theory .",
    "these findings will be reported elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the wilson plaquette action was used on symmetrical @xmath47 lattices with periodic boundary conditions and the sommer scale @xmath48 ( in the fundamental representation ) was used to set the scale @xcite .",
    "the negative wilson mass in the fundamental representation was chosen at @xmath49 while for the sextet it was set to @xmath50 . in both cases",
    "2 steps of stout smearing was applied with smearing parameter @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "the implementation of the overlap operator is the same as in @xcite .",
    "the simulation parameters are summarized in table [ simparam ] .",
    "the fundamental and sextet indices are tabulated in tables [ indices12 ] [ indices20 ] together with the number of configurations that have been observed with the given values ."
