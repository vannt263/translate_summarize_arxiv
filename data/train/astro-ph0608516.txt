    "recent observations ( adelberger 2003 , shapley 2003 ( s03 ) , steidel 2003 , adelberger 2005 ) based on a combination of quasar absorption - line and faint - galaxy techniques applied to the same cosmic volumes have revealed that uv - selected , star forming galaxies at redshift @xmath4 ( in brief , lyman break galaxies , lbgs ) show spectral absorption lines due to heavy elements .",
    "these absorption lines , which can be very strong ( @xmath5  @xmath6 ) , are often called  interstellar \" because they resemble the absorption lines produced by interstellar material in local galaxies .",
    "nevertheless , these lines appear ( without exception ) to be _ blueshifted _ with respect to the galaxy systemic velocity deduced from nebular lines .",
    "the typical velocity difference is @xmath7  km  s@xmath8 , but a non - negligible fraction of lbgs show differences in excess of 300  km  s@xmath8 ( pettini 2002 ) .",
    "these absorbing systems are often interpreted as arising in cool and/or neutral structures ( maybe a shell ) part of an outflow powered by supernovae associated with the detected galaxy star formation activity .",
    "an additional element in support of this hypothesis comes from the detection of _ redshifted _",
    "ly@xmath0 photons backscattered from gas behind the stars .",
    "quite interestingly , this emission could trace the receding part of the outflowing shell .",
    "finally , strong ly@xmath0 absorption is produced by the intergalactic gas within @xmath9 comoving mpc of most lbgs , but for about 1/3 the absorption is weak or absent .",
    "the transparency of the medium around some lbgs could arise from the gas collisional ionization / heating by the wind ( croft 2002 , adelberger 2003 , kollmeier 2003 , bruscoli 2003 , bertone 2005 , kollmeier 2006 ) , from a galaxy proximity ( photoionization ) effect , as pointed out by maselli ( 2004 ) , or simply reflect cosmic variance and artifacts of the data reduction ( desjacques 2004 , desjacques , haehnelt & nusser 2005 ) .    in general",
    ", one would expect to observe also infalling gas in the surroundings of lbgs arising either from gas accretion along the cosmic web filaments or because at least part of the outflowing gas could rain back onto the galaxy if its velocity does not exceed the escape speed of the system ( a process known as galactic fountain ) .",
    "in fact , the infall ram pressure might be of primary importance in confining and reverting the wind expansion ( fujita 2004 ) .",
    "this situation is clearly appreciated from the inspection of the results of recent , high resolution simulation of lbg outflows ( ferrara , scannapieco & bergeron ; see fig . 2 of that paper ) .",
    "however , observations so far have not found any experimental evidence of such physically - based expectation .",
    "the central aim of this paper is to understand why outflows are routinely observed in lbgs whereas gas infall seem to escape detection .",
    "this puzzle is possibly related to the following scenario . during the first phase of a starburst the galactic wind produces a cavity filled with hot gas , enclosed by a cold and dense shell . afterwards the shell fragments and the velocity of the cold debris starts decreasing while the hot gas escapes from the galaxy . whether or not they survive for some time , the uv light from the galaxy should become progressively less absorbed by the debris since their covering factor decreases with time as they travel to larger distances from the galaxy .",
    "observations may show a time evolution of the equivalent width ( ew ) of metal absorption lines and dust reddening produced by the decrease of the screening effect of the cold debris on the uv light from the galaxy . if the debris are not disrupted or ejected from the galaxy we should also observe the gas return ( infall ) process .",
    "the relevant question to pose then seems : can we observe galaxies during all these different evolutionary stages ?",
    "a large statistical galactic sample ( more than 800 galaxies at intermediate redshifts ) that can be used to test this model has been compiled by s03 . from the analysis of this data set a very interesting number of relationships emerge ( some of which already noticed by s03 and others obtained by correlating their data in a different way ) , which are listed in the following :    * the wind velocity , @xmath10 , is proportional to the star formation rate ( sfr ) : @xmath11 * the ly@xmath0 emission line ew is inversely proportional to the wind velocity : @xmath12 * the ew of metal absorption lines is proportional to the wind velocity : @xmath13 * the reddening is proportional to the wind velocity : @xmath14    should we interpret these properties as produced by intrinsic variations of the physical properties ( _ eg .",
    "_ , sfr , mass , size ) of lbgs ? or do they rather reflect the different ages of a single ( broadly speaking ) galactic population with uniform properties ?",
    "the relationships ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) naturally descend from the properties of a time evolving uniform population : as the cold debris move outward they are slowed down by gravity / energy losses , their covering factor decreases , and the ew and reddening also decrease .",
    "property ( 2 ) can easily be understood in the same framework .",
    "contrary to the metal absorption lines , the ew of the ly@xmath0 emission line increases with decreasing wind velocity ( _ ie .",
    "_ , increasing time from the starburst ) since the scattering by the outflowing neutral gas is reduced and a larger fraction of the blue wing of the ly@xmath0 line is transmitted .",
    "naively , relationship ( 1 ) can be interpreted as due to a variation of the energy input of the wind for galaxies with different star formation rate .",
    "however , a closer look at that relationship ( figure  [ fig : v_sfr ] ) shows that the dependence of @xmath10 on the sfr is not as the one expected under this assumption .",
    "assuming , for simplicity , a constant density profile for the gas in the galaxy core , the velocity is a very weak function of the sfr : @xmath15 with @xmath16 ( shown by the solid line ) . even assuming a more general gas density profile of the galaxy core , @xmath17 , would produce @xmath18 that is too flat to fit the observations for any realistic choice of @xmath19 . a very steep slope @xmath20 ( shown by the dashed line ) fits the observations , but would produce unrealistically large outflow velocities incompatible with the data .",
    "moreover , we will show later that the cold shell becomes unstable when the slope of the density profile becomes steeper than @xmath21 : at that point fragments decouple from the hot wind .",
    "thus , the steepest physical dependence of @xmath10 on the sfr is @xmath22 when @xmath23 , while the best fit to the data requires @xmath24 .    guided by the aforementioned arguments , in this paper we propose that the different observed",
    "wind velocities correspond to different starburst evolutionary times , and are not directly related to variations of their mean sfr or other internal properties .",
    "the proportionality of the wind velocity and sfr is incidental .",
    "it reflects the fact that both quantities decrease as the time elapsed from the starburst increases .",
    "we have organized the paper as follows . in   [",
    "sec : sca ] we describe our model analytically assuming a power law density profile for the gas . in ",
    "[ sec : res ] we assume a more realistic density profile of the gas and we compare the numerical results to the observations . in   [ sec : dis ] we discuss the implications of our model and provide an explanation for the lack of evidences for infalling gas in lbgs .",
    "to understand some basic features of lbg outflows we first resort to scaling arguments .",
    "we closely follow the method outlined in ferrara & tolstoy ( 2000 ) and madau , ferrara & rees ( 2001 ) to which we refer the interested reader for the details .",
    "assume that ambient gas pressure , gravity , and cooling can be neglected ; moreover , we take a constant mechanical luminosity for the starburst , @xmath25 ( the case @xmath26 can be explored but there is no analytical solution ) .",
    "then the outflowing ( thin ) shell radius evolution is described by : @xmath27 we further make the hypothesis that the halo gas density profile can be approximated ( at least piece - wise ) by a power - law profile : @xmath28 with @xmath29 and @xmath30 is the central density . as for a navarro , frenk & white ( 1997 , nfw ) dark matter halo baryons have a core radius @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the concentration parameter , we have used such relation in eq . [ rho ] .",
    "note that @xmath33 in the case of a central core , i.e. if @xmath34 . by substituting @xmath35 into eq .",
    "[ rs1 ] we find @xmath36 with @xmath37 ; we use the standard definition of @xmath38 @xmath39^{-1/3 } \\left ( \\frac{1+z}{4 } \\right ) ^{-1 } h^{-1 } { \\rm kpc}.\\ ] ] we also take @xmath40 . in the following ,",
    "we adopt the value @xmath41 , the appropriate overdensity of the core in a nfw profile . if we further define ] @xmath42^{-{1",

    "( [ rs2 ] ) can be casted in the very simple form : @xmath43 the velocity , time to @xmath44 , velocities to @xmath45 , masses to @xmath46 of the shell is then given by @xmath47 the dense shell is pushing on the rarefied interstellar medium ( ism ) gas . the ( external ) shell interface becomes rayleigh - taylor ( rt ) unstable if the shell is _",
    "accelerating_. in this case @xmath48 is parallel to @xmath49 , and the vector goes from the heavy ( shell ) to the light ( ism ) fluid and the rt instability develops . from maclow & mccray ( 1988 ) simulations we note that the rt fingers are beyond the thin shell solution , i.e. the instability develops outside the bubble .",
    "the nonlinear evolution leads to the formation of clumps which detach from the shell ; the hot gas wraps around them and escapes ; at the same time , the ram pressure on the clumps decreases so they lag behind the shock .",
    "hence , the onset of the rt instability is fixed by the condition that the acceleration of the shell becomes positive .",
    "the shell acceleration is @xmath50 the rt condition is satisfied when @xmath51 ; as @xmath52 for any reasonable density profile slope @xmath19 , this implies @xmath53 .",
    "hence the instability starts to develop at the time @xmath54 when the shell enters in the @xmath55 part of the gas distribution .",
    "before that it evolves in a @xmath56 density profile ( e.g. the baryonic core in a nfw profile or the inner part of a disk ) .",
    "the linear growth rate of the instability on spatial scale @xmath57 is given by @xmath58^{1/2 } \\simeq \\left[{2\\pi \\vert g_s(\\tau )      \\vert \\over \\lambda } \\right]^{1 \\over 2 } , \\label{rtgrow1}\\ ] ] the second equality descending by the fact that the density contrast between the shell and the ism gas is @xmath59 .",
    "note also that the instability grows first on the shortest scales and it diverges as @xmath60 . at these small scales , the rt is stabilized by viscosity and/or magnetic fields . as we are interested in the shell fragmentation , we estimate the growth time on a scale @xmath61 such that @xmath62 , which by eq .",
    "( [ rs3 ] ) is equal to @xmath63 .",
    "the maximum growth rate occurs when the acceleration is largest and scale is smallest , _",
    "i.e. _ , at @xmath64 . then @xmath65^{1/2 }                                   = \\sqrt{6\\pi q\\vert ( 3q-1)\\vert } ~\\tau_i^{-1 }                                   = { \\sqrt{6\\pi \\vert ( 2-\\beta)\\vert } \\over \\vert 5-\\beta \\vert } ~\\tau_i^{-1 } , \\label{rtgrow2}\\ ] ] where @xmath66 is the value appropriate for the stable region",
    ". given this range we find that the longest time corresponds to @xmath34 , for which @xmath67 .",
    "so what is @xmath54 ? as already mentioned , the baryonic core in a nfw halo has size @xmath68 , hence for the @xmath34 ( @xmath16 ) solution and for @xmath69 we find @xmath70 at the time @xmath71 , the instability becomes nonlinear and the shell fragments in dense clumps the move almost ballistically in the gravitational field of the dark matter halo from there on .",
    "their precise mass / number is difficult to calculate , but to a first approximation @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the shell thickness calculated at @xmath74 ; as now , we fix @xmath75 with @xmath76 .",
    "the mass of the shell is approximately equal to the swept - up mass in the halo . to write the equation of motion for the fragments ( note that this is _ independent _ of the mass of fragments ) we first derive the nondimensional gravitational acceleration : @xmath77 where @xmath78^{-1/2 } \\approx    0.32[(1+z)/4]^{-3/2}$ ]",
    "gyr is proportional to the halo free fall time .",
    "we have assumed a nfw profile with @xmath79 @xmath80 , and @xmath81 it follows that fragment velocity is governed by @xmath82 as @xmath83 , @xmath84 , then this approximation has been dropped . ]",

    "we neglect that complication , by noting that the time - weighted mean is @xmath92 when computing @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",

    "the fragments start to infall onto the galaxy unless , @xmath107 , in which case they are lost to the gravitational potential and ejected in the igm . using the value of @xmath44 from eq .",
    "[ tw ] , with @xmath23 and @xmath69 and the other fiducial values there , one obtains @xmath108  myr and @xmath109 .",
    "then we find @xmath110 @xmath111 we conclude that mechanical luminosities @xmath112 are required to eject the fragments ( @xmath113 ) from a typical lbg galaxy .",
    "this conclusion is approximate as our formalism is valid in @xmath83 ( see eq .",
    "[ vel ] ) and it actually overestimates the velocity ; nevertheless , it gives a first rough estimate of the escape of fragments .",
    "are these mechanical luminosities consistent with the observed lbgs ?",
    "the mechanical luminosity ( stellar winds and sne ) for a continuous star formation rate of @xmath114  yr@xmath8 , with @xmath115 , is @xmath116 ( this slightly top - heavy imf seems to be favored by the results obtained for high - redshift galaxies by malhotra & rhoads 2003 ) . assuming that a fraction @xmath117 ( veilleux2005 ) of this energy goes into kinetic energy , and the rest is radiated away , we find that @xmath118 .",
    "thus an enormous sfr of about @xmath119 solar masses / yr would be needed ( even more , given the overestimate of the velocity from eq .",
    "[ [ vel ] ] ) to eject the fragment .",
    "the fact that cold , dense gas is very difficult to eject does not exclude that the hot gas can instead be expelled , as already noticed by mac low & ferrara ( 1999 ) .",
    "suppose that after shell fragmentation the clumps move radially and keep constant size ( this is a reasonable assumption as long as they are embedded in and pressure - confined by the hot bubble interior gas flowing into the halo ) .",
    "then their covering factor of the source ( which is independent of their mass ) decreases with time as @xmath120}^2 =   { \\left[1.8   \\tau_i\\over x_s(\\tau)\\right]}^2 = 10^{-4 } \\tau^{-2 } , \\label{eq : c}\\ ] ] that is , the covering factor has already dropped to 1% when @xmath121 , which occurs at @xmath122 , or in dimensional units , after @xmath123  myr .",
    "finally , the hot shocked gas continues its expansion , leaving the clumps behind .",
    "where does the shock stop ?",
    "it stops when it reaches pressure balance with the igm surrounding the halo , i.e. when its velocity has dropped to the igm effective sound speed , which is in the formula below is assumed to be @xmath124  km  s@xmath8 .",
    "this happens approximately when the internal pressure @xmath125 is equal to @xmath126 or , at @xmath127 , @xmath128^{1/3 }   \\approx \\eta^{1/3 } \\left({\\dot m_{\\star } \\over { \\rm m}_\\odot { \\rm yr}^{-1}}\\right)^{1/3 } \\left({t_{burst}\\over   10 ^ 8{\\rm yr}}\\right)^{1/3 } { \\rm mpc}.\\ ] ] the previous argument neglects radiative losses , gravity and the possible infall ram - pressure ; hence , such estimate represents an upper limit to @xmath129 ( physical units ) .",
    "the aim of this section is to show quantitatively that the s03 data can be interpreted according to our model . by fitting the model to the data we attempt to infer some underlying properties of the lbg population .",
    "hereafter , we adopt a more realistic description of the gas density profile with respect to the idealized case adopted in   [ sec : sca ] .",
    "we also drop most of the simplifying approximations adopted previously .",
    "we solve numerically eq .  ( [ rs1 ] ) to calculate the evolution of the radius , velocity and acceleration of the shock front during the wind - driven phase .",
    "when the slope of the density profile becomes steeper than @xmath23 the cold shell becomes unstable to rt instability and fragments .",
    "the subsequent evolution of the cold fragments is calculated by solving eq .",
    "( [ eq : fra ] ) and the time scale for shell fragmentation is calculated from eq .",
    "( [ rtgrow1 ] ) .",
    "the quantitative results found in this section are robust as they are insensitive to the poorly known properties of the gaseous disk .",
    "we will show that our model is independent of the particular choice of the gas density profile , at least for `` beta models '' or exponential density profiles .",
    "the results are also insensitive to the values of physical parameters such as the disk scale height , core density etc . , provided that they obey a given relationship .",
    "a gas in hydrostatic equilibrium in a nfw dark halo with virial radius @xmath130 and concentration @xmath32 , has a density profile that is well fitted by a beta model ( makino , sasaki & suto 1998 ) @xmath131^{1.4}},\\ ] ] where , for a gas at the virial temperature , the core radius is @xmath132 and @xmath133 is the central gas density .",
    "it is likely that , due to gas cooling , the temperature of the gas is lower than the virial temperature . in this case",
    "the core radius will be smaller and the central density higher .",
    "independently of the assumed value of @xmath134 , if the gas mass is a cosmic fraction of the halo mass , @xmath135 , by imposing mass conservation and disk geometry we find @xmath136 we have assumed the following fiducial values for lbgs : total mass @xmath137 m@xmath138 , concentration @xmath69 ( @xmath139 kpc ) .",
    "the data fitting is insensitive to the functional form of the density profile .",
    "we have found that adopting an exponential density profile @xmath140 $ ] ( where now @xmath134 is the scale height ) the model fits the data equally well .",
    "the time scale for shell fragmentation depends on the shape of the profile .",
    "the evolution of the cold shell before fragmentation depends on the details of the profile but the subsequent evolution of the cold fragments is independent of the assumed profile .",
    "this happens because the fragmentation time - scale varies in such a way to keep the fragment velocity the same .",
    "we find that @xmath141 for the `` beta model '' , @xmath142 for the exponential profile with @xmath143 and @xmath144 for @xmath145 . during the acceleration and fragmentation phases , the velocity of the shell increases only by a factor @xmath146 of a few percent with respect to its initial value @xmath147 at zero acceleration .",
    "this is consistent with eq .",
    "( [ rtgrow1 ] ) that can be recast in terms of the variables of interest : @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "it follows that @xmath150 .",
    "the velocity evolution of the cold fragments is degenerate for choices of the mechanical luminosity of the starburst @xmath25 that obey @xmath151 , where @xmath152 is a constant and @xmath153 is the fraction of mechanical luminosity converted into kinetic energy of the cold shell ( the rest being radiated away by the hot gas ) .",
    "thus , further assuming eq .",
    "( [ eq : loc ] ) , it follows that the velocity of the fragments is proportional to @xmath154 .",
    "the cold shell driven by the starburst is stable for only a few myrs before it fragments and the clumps move ballistically .",
    "thus the appropriate value of @xmath25 to use is that corresponding to this early phase , when the kinetic energy input produced by the starburst is dominated by winds from massive stars and is @xmath155 , for stellar metallicities @xmath156 ( leitherer 1999 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath153 , the fraction of mechanical luminosity converted into kinetic energy of the supershell , is not well known from observations .",
    "we adopt the fiducial value @xmath157% ( vielleux 2005 ) .",
    "the lbg sample of s03 is grouped in four bins according to their ly@xmath0 equivalent width .",
    "each bin contains about the same number of galaxies ( about 200 ) . in our interpretation ,",
    "different bins describe a statistically steady - state time sequence and correspond to different times from the beginning of the starburst with typical time scale @xmath158 .",
    "thus , if we neglect differential selection bias effects in the data , we expect that equally time - spaced bins contain an equal number of galaxies of age : @xmath159 for bins @xmath160 .",
    "the observed star formation rate of the galaxies in each of the four bins is well fitted by an exponential function @xmath161 the numerical value of @xmath158 will be derived later by fitting the observations of the fragment velocities .",

    "the reason why we do not see infalling clumps is simple : we do not observe this evolutionary phase because it happens too late when the uv emission from the galaxy has faded and the galaxy can not be found using the lyman break selection criteria ( selection techniques based on infrared colors might instead detect these galaxies long after the process has come to an end ) .",

    "<S> a model for gas outflows is proposed which simultaneously explains the correlations between the ( i ) equivalent width of low ionization and ly@xmath0 lines , ( ii ) outflow velocity , and ( iii ) star formation rate observed in lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) . </S>",
    "<S> our interpretation implies that lbgs host short - lived ( @xmath1 myr ) starburst episodes observed at different evolutionary phases . </S>",
    "<S> initially , the starburst powers a hot wind bound by a denser cold shell , which after @xmath2 myr becomes dynamically unstable and fragments ; afterwards the fragment evolution is approximately ballistic while the hot bubble continues to expand . as the fragments are gravitationally decelerated , their screening ability of the starlight decreases as the uv starburst luminosity progressively dims . </S>",
    "<S> lbg observations sample all these evolutionary phases . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the fragments fall back onto the galaxy after @xmath3 myr . </S>",
    "<S> this phase can not be easily probed as it occurs when the starburst uv luminosity has already largely faded ; however , galaxies dimmer in the uv than lbgs should show infalling gas .    </S>",
