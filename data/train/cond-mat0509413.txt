    "yttrium manganite belongs to the the family of rare - earth manganites @xmath3mno@xmath0 ( @xmath4 rare earth element ) which have both ferroelectric and magnetic order .",
    "these compounds crystallize in the hexagonal space - group p6@xmath0 cm below the paraelectric - ferroelectric phase transition ( t  @xmath5  900  k ) .",
    "the six mn@xmath6 magnetic moments in the unit cell are located in planes separated by @xmath7    along the hexagonal axis . in the @xmath8 plane",
    "the mn atoms are placed along the @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 axes , whereas in the @xmath12 plane they are along the axes @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the mn atoms are centered in triangular bi - pyramids whose vertices are oxygen atoms . because of the large distance between adjacent triangular layers , ymno@xmath0 is a good candidate for a geometrically frustrated 2dimensional antiferromagnet although small exchange interactions along the hexagonal axis drives magnetic ordering at @xmath16  k. the magnetic structure of ymno@xmath0 was first studied by neutron diffraction by bertaut @xcite who found that two spin arrangements give similar agreement between observed and calculated powder diffraction patterns .",
    "both models describe a triangular arrangement of the @xmath17 magnetic moments in the basal plane with the coupling between adjacent layers being either ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic ( further on labeled according to their irreducible representations @xmath18 and @xmath19 respectively ; all representations are derived in ref .",
    "@xcite ; see fig.[magstruc ] ) .",
    "although both structures lead to very similar magnetic neutron intensities , muoz concluded from recent neutron diffraction studies that the probable magnetic structure of ymno@xmath0 corresponds to @xmath19 with the magnetic moment of the mn - ions being @xmath20  @xmath21 at saturation  @xcite .",
    "the reduction of the value of the magnetic moment from the expected 4  @xmath21 of mn@xmath6 free spins is taken as evidence that even in the ordered phase strong    . [",
    "cols=\"<,^,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     spin fluctuations are present due to geometrical frustration @xcite .",
    "+ the @xmath3mno@xmath0 ferroics have received renewed interest since anomalies in the dielectric constant @xmath22 are found at the magnetic ordering temperature t@xmath23 @xcite indicating a strong coupling between ferroelectric and magnetic properties .",
    "the origin of the magnetoelectric ( me ) effect in these compounds is still not fully understood but spin - lattice interaction might play an important role in these materials .",
    "for example , anomalies of the structural parameters were reported at t@xmath23 that yield evidence that coupling between spin and lattice degrees of freedom is at the origin of the me effect in ymno@xmath0  @xcite . in order to get more insight into the coupling between spin and structural parameters and their possible relationship with the magnetic and dielectric properties of ferroic materials , we investigated the influence of hydrostatic pressure on the magnetic ordering in ymno@xmath0 .",
    "polycrystalline ymno@xmath0 was prepared by a solid state reaction . starting oxides of y@xmath24o@xmath0 and mno@xmath24 with 99.99@xmath25 purity were mixed and grounded followed by sintering at 1000 - 1200@xmath26 c in air during 100h with several intermediate grindings .",
    "phase purity of the compound was checked with conventional x - ray diffractometer ( siemens d500 ) .",
    "the neutron measurements were performed at the neutron powder diffractometer dmc located at the cold source of the neutron spallation source sinq .",
    "the instrument was operated with @xmath27     and a pg - filter was installed in the beam to remove higher - order harmonics . for measurements at ambient pressure , 13  g of polycrystalline ymno@xmath0 were filled in a standard vanadium container ( @xmath28=15  mm ) . for the pressure experiments",
    "a clamp - type pressure cell was used , that can attain a maximum pressure of @xmath29  kbar .",
    "hydrostatic pressure is obtained by mixing the powder sample with fluorinert .",
    "the effective pressure was calculated from the known pressure dependence of the lattice parameters of nacl  @xcite that was mixed with the ymno@xmath0 sample .",
    "the sample was cooled in a @xmath30he cryostat of ill - type .",
    "a first series of measurements were done at ambient pressure in the temperature range 1.5  k @xmath31 t @xmath31 300  k. a typical neutron diffraction pattern is shown in fig .",
    "2(a ) that was analyzed with the rietveld method @xcite implemented in the program fullprof @xcite . the structural parameters found at t  =",
    "300  k are presented in table  [ structural ] .",
    "the fit of the magnetic structure of ymno@xmath0 was found to yield a slightly better agreement with the @xmath19-type ( magnetic r@xmath32 , @xmath33 ) than the @xmath18 structure ( magnetic r@xmath34 , @xmath35 ) .",
    "we note that the symmetry of the @xmath18 structure allows the magnetic moments to have a component out of the @xmath36-plane .",
    "however , agreement factors between observed and calculated intensities do not improve when spins are canted and we conclude that the magnetic moments lie in the hexagonal plane . with the @xmath19 structure , the value of the magnetic moment at t  =  1.5  k is @xmath37 , in good agreement with the results of muoz _ et al .",
    "_ the temperature dependence of the staggered magnetization is shown in fig .",
    "[ moments ] .",
    "although the maximum load was applied to the pressure cell , we found that the effective pressure was 7.8  kbar at t  =  1.5  k and increased to 9.6  kbar at t  =  300  k. however the pressure increased only slightly from 7.8 to 8.3  kbar in the temperature range 1.5  k  @xmath31  t  @xmath31  80  k where ymno@xmath0 is antiferromagnetically ordered .",
    "2(b ) shows a typical neutron diffraction pattern measured at t  =  20  k and p  =  8  kbar .",
    "apart from bragg reflections of ymno@xmath0 , the diffraction pattern contains now additional reflections due to the nacl powder .",
    "in addition , the background is high mainly due to the presence of fluorinert in the neutron beam . therefore the statistical quality of the data is much reduced when compared with the results obtained at ambient pressure .",
    "+ the applied hydrostatic pressure mainly altered the lattice constant @xmath9 whereas @xmath38 remained almost unchanged ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "the volume of the unit cell changed from v = 374.802(4 )  @xmath40   at ambient pressure to v  =  373.460(5 )  @xmath40   at p  =  9.6  kbar .",
    "comparison of the structural parameters shown in table  [ structural ] indicates that only the @xmath41-coordinate of the o1 atom is significantly modified by application of pressure . the shift of the o1 atom decreases the length of mn - o1 bond from 1.84    to 1.68   .",
    "a preliminary analysis of the data at t = 1.5  k showed that the neutron diffraction peaks of ymno@xmath0 have very similar relative intensities than observed at ambient pressure .",
    "least - square refinements of the diffraction pattern yielded good agreement factors for the magnetic structure with @xmath19 and @xmath18 symmetry , namely ( magnetic ) r@xmath42 and @xmath43 for @xmath19 and ( magnetic ) r@xmath44 and @xmath45 for @xmath18 respectively .",
    "hence , the spin arrangement of ymno@xmath0 is not modified by hydrostatic pressure up to p  @xmath46  8  kbar .",
    "however , the magnitude of the ordered magnetic moments is significantly reduced from @xmath47  @xmath21 at ambient pressure to @xmath48 at p  @xmath46  8  kbar for the @xmath19 symmetry .",
    "we note , that the ordered moment is reduced to @xmath49 for magnetic structure with @xmath18 symmetry .",
    "the temperature dependence of the ordered magnetic moment is shown in fig .",
    "[ moments ] .",
    "although from neutron powder measurements it is difficult to determine the value of t@xmath23 precisely , we conclude from our data that the difference of the temperature of the phase transition from the paramagnetic to the ordered antiferromagnetic state is less than @xmath46  5  k at p  =  8  kbar as compared to ambient pressure .",
    "a possible model to describe the magnetic and ferroelectric properties of ferroic materials was proposed by gong _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite that includes antiferromagnetic heisenberg exchange interactions and a double well potential for the lattice displacements giving rise to ferroelectricity .",
    "the me coupling is described by an interaction of the form @xmath50 and @xmath51 for the intraplane and @xmath52 for the interplane component respectively , where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the intra- and inter - plane me coupling constants , @xmath55 is the lattice displacement at site @xmath56 , and @xmath57 is the heisenberg spin operator , @xmath58 and @xmath59 denote the nearest neighbors to @xmath56 and @xmath9 and @xmath10 represent the nearest planes . in the mean - field approximation , the me coupling leads to a renormalisation of the intra- and interplane exchange integrals @xmath60 and @xmath61 to @xmath62 and @xmath63 respectively , where @xmath64 . in that approach ,",
    "the nel temperature is reduced by the me - coupling , but the value of the magnetic moment @xmath65 in the ground - state is essentially unaffected  @xcite .",
    "although , this is consistent with the observation that in homno@xmath0 , the spin reorientation temperature t@xmath66 of the manganese sublattice shifts to lower temperatures by about 1.5  k at p@xmath468  kbar  @xcite , the model does not explain the moment reduction observed in ymno@xmath0 .",
    "we investigated the influence of hydrostatic pressure on the properties of the magnetic ground - state of ymno@xmath0 .",
    "the magnetic structure of ymno@xmath0 is found to have @xmath19 symmetry at p  =  8  kbar . on the other hand , the ordered magnetic moment at saturation",
    "is significantly reduced by application of pressure .",
    "this suggests that coupling between the size of the magnetic moment and the volume of the unit cell is important in ferroic materials and that application of hydrostatic pressure leads to an increase of the spin fluctutations in ymno@xmath0 and enhances the 2dimensional character of the magnetic properties of that compound .",
    "we suggest that application of pressure leads to a renormalisation of the temperature dependence of the staggered magnetisation , i.e. the strain influences the sublattice magnetisation  @xcite .",
