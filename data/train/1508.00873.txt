    "the exchange parameters obtained with this multiband scenario revealed that @xmath135 is dominant over @xmath174 and @xmath175 . this allowed a tractable rkky description for the antiferromagnetic behavior of the gdco@xmath1zn@xmath2 compound . despite the fact that these compounds are structurally complex , we found that under certain reasonable approximations and using the combination of different experimental results with dft calculations , the rkky approach gave a very good quantitative description of the magnetic interaction , as expected for a naturally diluted structure of rare - earth ions .",
