    "the laser interferometer space antenna ( lisa ) is a collaborative esa / nasa enterprise to fly a space borne laser interferometer of arm - length 5 million km for the observation of gravitational waves ( gw s ) in the frequency window @xmath0 hz - 0.1 hz  @xcite .",
    "lisa is likely to observe the largest sample of galactic binary systems of stellar - mass compact objects , strongly dominated by double white dwarfs ( wd s ) , but including also neutron stars and possibly solar - mass black holes  @xcite . due to the very large sample of these ( electro - magnetically very faint ) objects ,",
    "it is therefore interesting to investigate new astrophysical information that lisa will be able to provide , and therefore estimate the errors associated with parameter measurements .",
    "all the investigations that have been carried out so far regarding short - period stellar mass binary systems have implicitly assumed lisa to work in the so - called long wavelength approximation ( which is equivalent to assuming that the instantaneous gw emission frequency is @xmath1 hz ) , in other words that the lisa transfer function is constant  @xcite . however the vast majority of the detectable systems ",
    "current estimates suggest that lisa will be able to resolve @xmath2 sources  will be in the frequency band 1 mhz - 10 mhz  @xcite , where the frequency and location dependent transfer function might introduce significant effects ; such effect has already been noted for the case of observations of black hole binary inspirals  @xcite .    here",
    "we address the effect of lisa s finite arm - length for parameter estimation in observations of monochromatic signals , and compare the results with those from previous analyses .",
    "the signal at the lisa michelson detector output reads  @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 describes the metric perturbation induced by gw s , and @xmath5 \\label{d}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is the detector response tensor . in the previous expression @xmath6",
    "is the unit vector along the @xmath7-th arms of the interferometer ( @xmath8 for the three arms of lisa here we simply consider one detector with @xmath7=1 and @xmath9=2 ) and @xmath10 \\,\\exp\\left\\{-i\\left[\\frac{f}{2f_{\\ast}}(3-{l}^a_{j}{n}_a)\\right]\\right\\ }   \\nonumber \\\\   & & + \\frac{1}{2}\\,\\mathrm{sinc}\\left[\\frac{f}{2f_{\\ast}}(1-{l}^a_{j}{n}_a)\\right ] \\,\\exp\\left\\{-i\\left[\\frac{f}{2f_{\\ast}}(1-{l}^a_{j } { n}_a)\\right]\\right\\ } \\label{t}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is the lisa transfer function which tends to 1 in the low frequency limit defined by @xmath11 ; @xmath12 mhz is the lisa transfer frequency ( @xmath13 km ) and the unit vector @xmath14 identifies the source location in the sky .",
    "we note the time dependence of @xmath15 due to the change in orientation of lisa during the year long observation time  @xcite .    setting @xmath16 in eq.([d ] ) and then substituting into eq.([h ] ) returns the familiar expression of the signal at the detector output in the long wavelength approximation  @xcite , @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the so - called antenna beam patterns and @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the two independent polarisations .",
    "we henceforth refer to these two representations as @xmath22 for the exact response function and @xmath23 for the response function in the long wavelength approximation .",
    "to establish at what frequency the two representations @xmath22 and @xmath24 become significantly different , we compute the overlap @xmath25 where @xmath26 represents the usual inner product between two functions @xmath27 and @xmath28  @xcite . notice that in eq  ( [ o ] ) we do not maximise over any of the signal parameters .",
    "we have calculated @xmath29 over the frequency range @xmath0 hz ",
    "hz for randomly selected sky locations and orientations of the orbital plane , which is identified by the unit vector @xmath31 along the direction of the orbital angular momentum ; we have found that @xmath32 at @xmath33 mhz ( the peak of the lisa sensitivity is at 3 mhz ) and the overlap drops rapidly below @xmath34 for @xmath35 hz , which suggests that at frequencies higher than a few mhz the low frequency approximation may no longer be appropriate ; this has important repercussions for signal detection through matched filters , and we are currently investigating this issue in more detail .    to investigate the statistical errors associated with parameter estimation we compute the fisher information matrix @xmath36 , and its inverse @xmath37 , which is related to the variance - covariance matrix through a straightforward normalisation of the off - diagonal elements  @xcite .",
    "we do this for both @xmath22 and @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath38 represents the vector of the unknown parameters , in our case the signal amplitude @xmath39 , the constant frequency @xmath40 , the arbitrary initial phase @xmath41 and the four angles that define the source geometry with respect to the detector ( in our representation we use as independent parameters @xmath42 ) .",
    "we also evaluate the lisa angular resolution , defined as @xmath43 .",
    "we investigate the differences between the expected errors computed using the low frequency approximation and the exact expression by computing their fractional difference @xmath44 where @xmath45 stands for either the mean - square error or the angular resolution and the subscript @xmath46 indicates that the long wavelength approximation has been used .",
    "we have calculated @xmath47 over the lisa observational window for randomly selected positions and orientations in the sky . here",
    "we show results for @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "the results are reported in figures  [ errora ] and  [ erroro ] and clearly show that the transfer function introduces characteristic modulations in phase and amplitude , c.f .",
    "eq.(3 ) that help in resolving the parameters more accurately .",
    "our preliminary results indicate that lisa s angular resolution differs by @xmath50 and @xmath51 at 5 mhz and 10 mhz , respectively , with respect to the long - wavelength approximation .",
    "analogously , @xmath48 differs by a few percent and @xmath52 , respectively .",
    "it is clear that the results depend strongly on the signal frequency and the source geometry , and @xmath24 becomes indeed an increasingly poorer representation of the actual detector output for @xmath53 5 mhz .",

    "we have shown that in the frequency range 1 mhz - 10 mhz , where most of the wd binary systems will be detected , the effect of the finite length of lisa arms can be significant and needs to be properly taken into account in lisa data analysis .",
    "our analysis is limited in two main respects : ( i ) we have explored only a limited portion of the whole signal parameter space , and ( ii ) we have not allowed for intrinsic frequency drifts of the signal during the observation time . the analysis to address the two former issues is currently in progress  @xcite ."
