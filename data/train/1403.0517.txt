    "the magellanic clouds ( mcs ) offer a unique opportunity to study galaxy interactions in unprecedented detail due to their proximity to the milky way ( mw ) .",
    "thus , detailed mapping of their gaseous content , the 3d kinematics of their stellar content , and the chemical - abundance makeup of these components are readily available for the clouds .",
    "the most obvious features of their interaction are the h  i structures known as the @xmath1-long magellanic stream ( ms ) , the bridge , and the leading arm ( la ) ( nidever et al .",
    "the recent work on the modeling of the clouds interaction by diaz & bekki ( 2012 ) makes a compelling case for tidal model , where the ms , bridge and la are made primarily of material pulled out from the smc during two close encounters between the two clouds .",
    "the first encounter took place @xmath2 gyr ago , and the second @xmath3 myr ago .",
    "this work used the most recent absolute proper - motion determinations for the clouds : one hst - based ( kallivayalil et al .",
    "2006 ) , the other ground - based ( vieira et al . 2010 ) .",
    "both determinations imply exactly two encounters between the clouds to reproduce the ms , la and bridge . as for their motion",
    "relative to the mw , hst measurements(kallivayalil 2006 , 2013 ) favor the scenario where the mcs are on the first passage about the mw , with the ms and la determined solely by the tidal interaction between the clouds .",
    "the ground - based proper - motion measurement allows for two pericentric passages of the clouds about the mw in the past 2.5 gyr , and thus some tidal influence of the galaxy in the formation of the ms , la and bridge is expected .",
    "the main drawback of the tidal models is that , while they produce a leading arm , all fail to reproduce the observed multi - branches morphology of the la , and its kinematics . a model by diaz & bekki ( 2011 ) that also includes a hydrodynamical interaction of the la with the diffuse , hot gaseous halo of the mw , better reproduces the kinematics along the la , but not its morphology .",
    "the la has a complex structure , possibly made of as many as four substructures according to for et al .",
    "( 2013 ) and venzmer et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , situated above and below the galactic plane , and encompassing @xmath4 in width .",
    "it has been argued that there is a strong drag exerted by the mw gaseous disk on the h  i substructures in the la ( mcclure et al .",
    "2008 , venzmer et al .",
    "this is implied by the head - tail velocity structure of the h  i clouds in the la , as well as the velocity gradient seen in a given la substructure / arm ( venzmer et al .",
    "thus it would be enlightening to search for newly formed stars in the la , an expected result of the hydrodynamical interaction between the ms gas and the mw gaseous disk and halo .",
    "we also note that the most recent ( @xmath5 myr ago ) encounter between the two clouds which created the bridge , is abundantly accompanied by recent star formation , a fact well known since the work by irwin et al .",
    "( 1990 ) and subsequent follow - up by , e.g. , demers et al .",
    "( 1998 ) .    in a recent study casetti - dinescu et al .",
    "( 2012 ) listed 567 ob - type star candidates in a @xmath6 7900 square degree area encompassing the periphery of the clouds , the bridge , the la , and part of the ms .",
    "the photometric and proper - motion selection was aimed at finding hot ( earlier than b5 ) and distant stars .",
    "also , the proper - motion selection was aimed at selecting stars with motions consistent with membership to the magellanic system . in the la region ,",
    "three stellar overdensities were found comprising a total of 45 candidates . this is a lower limit of such candidates , since the study is area - wise incomplete ( casetti - dinescu et al .",
    "2012 ) . here",
    ", we have spectroscopically observed 42 of the 45 candidates .",
    "their spatial distribution is shown in figure 1 . also shown",
    "is the h  i distribution from the gass survey ( mcclure - griffith et al .",
    "2009 , kalberla et al . 2010 ) for which we have restricted the velocity with respect to the local standard of rest , to be @xmath7 km / s .",
    "the three candidate overdensities we label : a at @xmath8 , b at @xmath9 , and c at @xmath10 . in",
    "what follows , we dscribe the spectroscopic observations and the results .",
    "intermediate - resolution spectra were obtained with the imacs spectrograph on the 6.5 m baade telescope at las campanas observatory .",
    "the setup gave a resolution of 1.3@xmath11 ( r@xmath123500 ) in the range 3650 to 5230  @xmath13 .",
    "the 1200 l / mm grating at the f/4 camera was employed at first order , with a blaze angle of @xmath14 and 0.75-wide slit , for a resulting resolution of 1.3@xmath11 ( r@xmath123500 ) in the range 3650 to 5230  @xmath13 .",
    "the average seeing during observations was 0.7  , and the resulting spectral the spectral signal - to - noise ratio was higher than 50 for all the targets .",
    "cross - correlation techniques ( tonry & davis 1979 ) as implemented in the iraf _ fxcor _ task , were used to measure heliocentric radial velocities ( rvs ) . in absence of a prior knowledge of the exact temperature and gravity of the targets ,",
    "the synthetic spectrum ( munari et al . 2005 ) of a main - sequence b - type star was adopted as the template .",
    "the final uncertainty , taking into account the relevant sources of errors , are estimated to be between 3 and 14  km  s@xmath15 , typically @xmath125  km  s@xmath15 for most of the targets .",
    "the spectra are also fitted with standard routines ( bergeron et al . 1992 , saffer et al . 1994 , napiwotzki et al . 1999 ) to derive the temperature , gravity , surface helium abundance , and , in some cases , rotational velocity .",
    "these values should be regarded as indicative , with errors @xmath16 km  s@xmath15 ] . at these colors ,",
    "our major source of contamination is foreground subdwarf o and b stars ( sdbs ) and white dwarfs .",
    "close binaries are extremely common among sdb s ( maxted et al .",
    "2001 ) , hence , rvs alone are not conclusive to assess the membership of our targets to the la . to distinguish main sequence stars from sdbs , besides the surface gravity",
    ", we can also use the surface helium abundance because the atmosphere of sdb s in the temperature range @xmath18  k is depleted of helium by a factor between 10 and 100 due to gravitational settling ( baschek 1975 , moni bidin et al .",
    "rotational velocity is also indicative , as fast rotators are common among early - type main sequence stars , but not among sdb s ( geier & heber 2012 ) .",
    "of the 42 candidates observed , we find 19 young , massive stars , together with 22 foreground sdb and white dwarf stars , and one uncertain object .",
    "the density of young stars in regions a and b is higher than in c , at a significance of @xmath19 in a , for instance , after correcting for areal incompleteness .",
    "we adopt rv = @xmath20  km  s@xmath15 as the lower limit for kinematical membership to the la based on h i velocities in the la ( e.g. , venzmer et al .",
    "note that , in this region of the sky , heliocentric and lsr rvs differ by a very small amount ( at most 14  km  s@xmath15 in region c ) .",
    "we find a total of six stars with rv @xmath21  km  s@xmath15 : four in region b , two in region a , and none in region c ( fig .",
    "1 ) . these are listed in table 1 , along with one other star of interest .",
    "remarkably , of the six stars with rv @xmath21  km  s@xmath15 , five are young , massive objects , as inferred from @xmath22 and helium abundance .",
    "three of these stars are also fast rotators .",
    "the rv average and dispersion of these five stars is @xmath23  km  s@xmath15 , and @xmath24  km  s@xmath15 respectively .",
    "even more remarkably , we find one candidate star to be a very hot , main sequence star with spectral type o6v ( tab .",
    "1 ) , and thus a massive ( @xmath25 ) , short - lived ( 1 - 2 myr ) star at a heliocentric distance of @xmath26 kpc . in figure 1 , we highlight the 19 young stars , the six stars with rv @xmath21  km  s@xmath15 , and the one o6v type star .",
    "we plot the rvs as a function of surface gravity , color - coded by effective temperature , in figure 2 , and highlight the fast rotators . as a guide",
    ", we also indicate the mean rv of the thin+thick disk populations and its @xmath27 standard - deviation range as derived from the besancon galactic model ( robin et al .",
    "the group of stars with rv @xmath21  km  s@xmath15 and @xmath28 stands out in this plot .",
    "a possible non - la origin for the young stars must be considered , i.e. , that these are runaway stars .",
    "such stars are believed to originate in star - forming regions of the galactic disk as massive binaries that are disrupted by either a supernova , or by a three- or four - body dynamical interaction , probably within a young star cluster ( e.g. , bromely et al .",
    "2009 ) in principle , all of our 19 young stars could be suspected of having such an origin .",
    "however , the five young b - type stars with rv @xmath21  km  s@xmath15 do not fit such a scenario , since their rv dispersion of 33  km  s@xmath15 is too low compared to that of runaway stars , @xmath29  km  s@xmath15 ( bromely et al .",
    "2009 ) . to obtain such a low velocity dispersion",
    ", the ejection mechanism would have to be directionally coherent , which is highly unlikely .",
    "for the remaining young stars , it is difficult to distinguish , on an individual basis , between a runaway star and an la member .",
    "this is because the rv is compatible with both the kinematics of a runaway star and the orbital motion of a binary star in the la .",
    "massive young stars are known to form predominantly in binary and multiple systems ( sana et al .",
    "2012 ) , thus it is likely that our single - epoch rvs are affected . given these two stochastic effects on rvs  contamination by runaway stars and binary orbital motion  it is remarkable that we have found five young stars exhibiting a dispersion of only 30  km  s@xmath15 , and a mean rv compatible with la kinematics . considering also the areal incompleteness ( casetti - dinescu et al .",
    "2012 ) , what we have discovered is probably the `` tip of the iceberg '' .",
    "absolute magnitudes and ages have been derived for all the young stars based on isochrones in the @xmath30 plane ( bressan et al .",
    "2012 ) . in figure 3 ,",
    "we plot distance modulus versus age for these stars .",
    "stars with rv @xmath21  km  s@xmath15 are once again highlighted . as a guide",
    ", the gray band indicates the kinematical distance ( 21 kpc ) with uncertainty , derived for a high velocity cloud in the la by mcclure et al ( 2008 ) that crosses the galactic disk . clearly , this kinematic distance is within the range of our stellar distances .",
    "a number of more nearby stars are also present in this young sample , and they may be more readily explained as having originated in the disk .    finally , we discuss the notable o6v star ( tab .",
    "its origin in the mw disk is doubtful , since it is too young ( 1 - 2 myr ) to have traveled at a reasonable speed to a galactocentric distance of @xmath31 kpc . to demonstrate this",
    ", we calculate its orbit using a three - component galactic potential model and find its last disk crossing occured over 500 myr ago . even allowing for uncertainties in the distance , the shortest time since",
    "last disk crossing in the orbit is 385 myr .",
    "therefore , this star could not have been born in the galactic disk .",
    "another possiblity is that it was born in the lmc and subsequently ejected , but this would require a velocity of the order of @xmath32  km  s@xmath15 for such a young star to reach its current position .",
    "this being an unrealistic value , the only viable possibility is that it was born _ in situ _ , far away from both the galactic disk and the lmc .",
    "these observations establish that conditions were met for recent star formation in the la material located in the outskirts of the galactic disk ( @xmath0 kpc ) , most likely as a consequence of the interaction between the galactic disk and portions of the la .",
    "we note that the most distant hi structure associated with the mw disk , is a spiral arm at @xmath33 to 24 kpc ( mcclure - griffiths et al .",
    "2004 ) , while stellar samples indicate shorter distances for the `` edge '' of the disk of @xmath34 kpc ( e.g. , minniti et al .",
    "2011 )    our findings cast new light on the interaction of the clouds with the mw , perhaps making a first infall scenario less likely .",
    "whether this is the case remains to be established by more complex models , and in light of the lower velocity of the clouds as indicated by the vieira et al .",

    "( 2009 ) and the kallivayalil et al .",

    "note , the group of six stars with velocities in excess of 150  km  s@xmath15 and log  g smaller than @xmath36 dex .",
    "five of these are classified as massive , young stars , and only one as a sdb , primarily on account of its low he abundance ( see table 1 ) .",
    "note also the hot , relatively low log  g star at rv @xmath37  km  s@xmath15 ( star symbol ) .",
