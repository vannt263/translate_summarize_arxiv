    "a reliable prediction of the total proton - proton cross section is fundamental to know which will be the underlying activity at the lhc and for new discoveries in physics from the lhc data . in this article",
    ", we shall describe a model @xcite @xcite for the hadronic total cross section based on qcd minijet formalism .",
    "the model includes a resummation of soft gluon radiation which is necessary to tame the fast high - energy rise typical of a purely perturbative minijet model .",
    "it is called the bn model from the bloch and nordsiek discussion of the infrared catastrophe in qed . in the first section",
    ", results are presented concerning the behavior of the qcd minijet cross section .",
    "it will then be explained how this term is included into an eikonal formalism where infrared soft gluon emission effects are added .",
    "the last section is devoted to the link between the total cross - section asymptotic high energy behavior predicted by our model and the model parameters .",
    "this relation also shows that our prediction is in agreement with the limit imposed by the froissart bound .",
    "hard processes involving high - energy partonic collisions drive the rise of the total cross section @xcite .",
    "these jet - producing collisions are typical perturbative processes and we can describe them through the usual qcd expression : @xmath0 with @xmath1 .",
    "this expression depends on the parameter @xmath2 which represents the minimum transverse momentum of the scattered partons for which one allows a perturbative qcd treatment .",
    "its value is usually around @xmath3 gev and it distinguishes hard processes ( that are processes for which a perturbative approach is used ) from the soft ones that dominate at low energy , typically for @xmath4 , i.e , well before the cross - section starts rising .",
    "the minijet expression also depends on the dglap evoluted partonic densities functions @xmath5 for which there exist in the literature different lo parameterizations(grv , mrst , cteq @xcite ) .",
    "we obtain an asymptotic growth of @xmath6 with energy as a power of @xmath7 .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig:1 ] , the value of the exponent depends on the pdf used and one has @xmath8 this result can be derived by considering the relevant contribution to the integral in ( [ eq1 ] ) in the @xmath9 limit . in this limit",
    ", the major contribution comes from the small fractions of momentum carried by the colliding gluons with @xmath10 . in this limit we know that the relevant pdf s behave approximately like powers of the momentum fraction @xmath11 with @xmath12 @xcite . from the previous consideration and noting that @xmath13 we obtain from ( [ eq1 ] ) the following asymptotic high - energy expression for @xmath6 :    @xmath14^{j - 1}.\\ ] ]    the dominant term is just a power of @xmath7 and the estimate obtained for the exponent @xmath15 is in agreement with our previous results .",
    "we now need to understand how to incorporate into a model for the total cross section this very fast rise at very high energy , which is present in the perturbative regime .",
    "firstly it is important to note that @xmath6 is an inclusive cross section and therefore contains in itself a multiplicity factor , linked to the average number @xmath16 of partonic collisions that take place during the hadronic scattering .",
    "we can approximate the energy driving term at high energy @xcite @xmath16 as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a function representing the overlap between the two hadrons .",
    "now we can derive an expression for the total cross section as a function of @xmath19 .",
    "assuming that the number of partonic collisions follows a poisson distribution , since each interaction is independent from the other , the probability of having @xmath20 partonic collisions is : @xmath21 the average number of partonic collisions should depend on the energy and on the impact parameter @xmath22 relative to the hadronic process @xmath23 . from the previous expression it is possible to obtain the inelastic hadronic cross section : @xmath24 } , \\ ] ] which is the usual eikonal expression",
    "if we consider the link between @xmath25 and the eikonal @xmath26 : @xmath27",
    "the eikonal representation allows to implement multiple parton scattering and to restore a finite size of the interaction . neglecting the real part of the eikonal function , an acceptable approximation in the high energy limit",
    ", the expression for the total cross section is @xmath28 .\\ ] ] the average number of partonic collisions receives contributions both from hard and soft physics processes and we write it in the form @xmath29 where the soft term parameterizes the contribution of all the processes for which the partons scatter with @xmath30 . it is the only relevant term at low - energy and it establishes the overall normalization , while the hard term is responsible for the high - energy rise . from ( [ mult ] ) , we approximate this term with @xmath31 where the minijet cross section drives the rise due to the increase of the number of partonic collisions with the energy and @xmath32 is the overlap function which depends on the ( energy dependent ) spatial distribution of partons inside the colliding hadrons . in some older models @xcite a simpler factorized expression for @xmath33 was used , with the overlap function depending only on @xmath22 .",
    "however , when up - to - date realistic parton densities are used , such impact parameter distributions , inspired by constant hadronic form factors , led to an excessive rise of @xmath34 with the energy . in our bn model",
    "we include an @xmath7-dependence in the overlap function that has to tame the strong growth due to the fast asymptotic rise of @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "we identify soft gluon emissions from the colliding partons as the physical effect responsible for the attenuation of the rise of the total cross section .",
    "these emissions influence matter distribution inside of the hadrons , hence changing the overlap function .",
    "they break collinearity between the colliding partons , diminishing the efficiency of the scattering process .",
    "the number of soft emissions increases with the energy and this makes their contribution important , also at very high energy .",
    "the calculation of this effect uses a semiclassical approach based on a block - nordsieck inspired formalism @xcite , the basic assumption of this technique is that all emissions are independent from each other , so the number of gluons emitted follows a poisson distribution .",
    "thereof one obtains a distribution of the colliding partons as function of the transverse momentum of the soft gluons emitted in the collision , i.e. @xmath35 the factor  @xmath36 is given by    @xmath37 = \\int { \\frac{{d^3 k}}{{2k_0 } } } \\sum\\limits_{m , n = colors } { |j^{\\mu , m } ( k)j_{\\mu , n } ( k)| } [ 1 - e^ { - ik _",
    "\\bot    \\cdot b } ] , \\ ] ] where @xmath38 is the distribution for single gluon emission in a scattering process and it is linked to the qcd current @xmath39 responsible for emission .",
    "we have proposed to obtain the overlap function as the fourier transform of the previous expression of the soft gluon transverse momentum resummed distribution , namely to put @xmath40 with @xmath41   \\label{hbq } , \\ ] ] this integral is performed up to a maximum value which is linked to the maximum transverse momentum allowed by the kinematics for a single gluon emitted , @xmath42 @xcite . in principle , this parameter and the overlap function should be calculated for each partonic sub - process , but in the partial factorization of eq.([nhard ] ) we use an average value of @xmath42 obtained considering all the sub - processes that can happen for a given energy of the main hadronic process@xcite : @xmath43 with @xmath44 .",
    "notice that consistency of the calculation requires that the pdf s used in eq .",
    "( [ qmax ] ) be the same as those used in @xmath6 . in are presented our results for @xmath42 as function of @xmath45 using @xmath46 gev .     using different input parton densities with @xmath46 gev.,height=374 ]",
    "the integral in ( [ hbq ] ) has another relevant feature , it extends down to zero momentum values , and to calculate it we have to take an expression of @xmath47 different from the perturbative qcd expression which is singular and not integrable in ( [ hbq ] ) .",
    "we use a phenomenological expression@xcite , which coincides with the usual qcd limit for large @xmath48 , and is singular but integrable for @xmath49 : @xmath50 } } .\\ ] ] this expression for @xmath47 is inspired by the richardson expression for a linear confining potential @xcite , and we find for the parameter @xmath51 that    * @xmath52 to have a convergent integral ( unlike the case of the richardson potential where @xmath53 ) * @xmath54 for the correct analyticity in the momentum transfer variable .",
    "@xcite shows our predictions , obtained for the total cross - section using a set of phenomenological values for @xmath2 and @xmath51 , and varying the parton densities .",
    "we also make a comparison with data and other current models .",
    "the froissart martin bound @xcite states that @xmath34 can not rise faster than a function which is proportional to @xmath55 . in order to see that in our model this bound is respected , we approximate our total cross section at very large energies as @xmath56 } \\label{sigtothard } , \\ ] ] with @xmath57 .",
    "we then take for @xmath6 the asymptotic high energy expression : @xmath58 with @xmath59constant and @xmath60 .",
    "being @xmath61 , we can consider in ( [ hbq ] ) the infrared limit @xmath62 where the integral receives the dominant contribution . in this limit",
    "we have @xmath63 apart from logarithmic terms . then , with @xmath64 @xcite ( again apart from logarithmic terms ) , we have @xmath65 and from this expression @xmath66 with @xmath67 . the very high energy limit of eq .",
    "( [ sigtothard ] ) then gives @xmath68 \\to \\left [ { \\varepsilon \\ln \\left ( { \\frac{s}{{gev^2 } } } \\right ) } \\right]^{1/p }   } .\\ ] ] the asymptotic growth of @xmath34 in our model depends on the parameter @xmath69 which fixes the asymptotic rise of the minijet cross section , and on @xmath51 which modulates the infrared behavior of @xmath47 . notice that @xmath70 and thus this approximated result links the restoration of the froissart bound in our model with the infrared behavior of @xmath47 .",
    "we can now understand why a knowledge of the confining phase of the strong interaction is necessary if we want to restore the finite size of the hadronic interaction .",
