    "complex networks have drawn increasing interests in various disciplines .",
    "recent studies have revealed that networks in the real world are far from fairly regular or totally random . particularly , real networks have small average shortest path length and high clustering at the same time , whereas conventional graphs such as lattices , trees , or the original random graphs are not equipped with these properties at the same time @xcite .",
    "the average path length is denoted by @xmath0 , and it more or less characterizes the diameter of the graph .",
    "the average of the shortest path length over all the pairs of vertices defines @xmath0 .",
    "the clustering property can be locally evaluated by the vertex - wise clustering coefficient , which is the number of connected triangles containing the vertex in question , normalized by the maximal number of possible triangles .",
    "if the vertex degree , or the number of edges emanating from a vertex , is @xmath1 , the normalization constant becomes @xmath2 .",
    "the clustering coefficient @xmath3 of the whole graph is the local clustering coefficient averaged over all the vertices .",
    "watts and strogatz proposed the small - world networks that simultaneously realize large @xmath3 and small @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "however , the small - world networks are short of the scaling property of vertex degree distribution denoted by @xmath4 . indeed ,",
    "not all but many real networks satisfy @xmath5 typically with @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "then , barabsi and albert ( ba ) developed the network model , which dynamically generates scale - free networks with @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the fundamental devices in the ba model are the network growth and the preferential attachment ; vertices are added one after another to the network , and edges are more prone to be connected to vertices with larger @xmath1 .",
    "various scale - free networks including extensions of the ba model , such as networks with dynamic edge rewiring @xcite , those with nonlinear preferential attachment @xcite , those with weights on edges @xcite , the fitness model @xcite , and the hierarchically and deterministically growing models @xcite have been proposed .",
    "these models largely yield more flexible values of @xmath8 , which is restricted to 3 in the original ba construction .",
    "furthermore , modifications to reinforce the clustering property , which the ba model lacks , have also been done .",
    "a simple solution is to embed a triangle - generating protocol into the ba model @xcite .",
    "introduction of a node deactivation procedure also enhances clustering @xcite .",
    "yet another solution is appropriately designed versions of the hierarchical models mentioned above @xcite . in short , large @xmath3 , small @xmath0 , and scale - free @xmath4",
    "can be simultaneously realized by the modified ba models or by the hierarchical construction .",
    "both models rely on the combined effects of network growth and the preferential attachment , although preferential attachment is not explicitly implemented in the hierarchical networks .",
    "nevertheless , every network is not apparently growing .",
    "networks can experience structural changes that are relatively much faster than network growth or aging processes .",
    "in economical networks of companies , friendship networks , peer - to - peer ( p2p ) networks , and networks of computer programs , for example , it seems natural that agents change their connectivity without significant entries or leaves of members .",
    "therefore , there has been a need for developing a nongrowing algorithm to generate realistic networks . in this regard , caldarelli _",
    "et al_. proposed a class of networks whose connections are determined by interactions of vertices that are endowed with intrinsic weights @xcite .",
    "the vertex weight is considered as a type of fitness @xcite , which describes the propensity of vertices to gain edges .",
    "it can be interpreted as money , social skills , or personal influence in social networks , activeness , the value of information attached to a vertex , concentration or mass of some ingredients in chemical or biological networks , or the vertex degree itself .",
    "surprisingly , scale - free topology spontaneously emerges even with weight distributions without power laws @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we analyze a subclass of their model that is based on a deterministic thresholding mechanism .",
    "the connectivity between a pair of vertices is determined by whether the sum of the weights of the pair exceeds a given threshold .",
    "actually , this class of networks is equivalent to the threshold graph in the graph theoretical context @xcite , and we also discuss its consequence .    despite the stochasticity and certain continuity in the real world , thresholding that is more or less `` hard '' is often observed . although the correspondence to our framework is not perfect , a common form of thresholding is that an agent on a vertex determines its action or state based on the number of neighbors taking a specific state .",
    "for example , propagation of riots , fashions , and innovations are considered to be equipped with thresholding mechanisms @xcite .",
    "these phenomena have been simulated by dynamic models , such as the threshold model for social decision @xcite , the minority games @xcite , the threshold voter models , and the threshold contact processes @xcite .    in this paper , we show that a baseline power law @xmath5 with @xmath9 rather than one with @xmath7 @xcite dominates this class of models and explore its cause and consequence . in sec .",

    ", we can assume @xmath18 of the next generation to be proportional to @xmath149 ( @xmath150 ) , which is often the case in real networks @xcite . in this case",
    ", it is easy to show that the neutrally stable fixed point of the abovementioned map is @xmath151 .",
    "our model , which yields @xmath9 , sets a baseline example of this class .    in terms of clustering ,",
    "we have observed the discrepancy in the scaling law @xmath95 for the exponential , logistic , and gaussian distributions with @xmath31 for the pareto , cauchy , and one - sided cauchy distributions . the pareto distribution with @xmath130 results in @xmath62 , which coincides with the scaling law for the exponential type of @xmath16 .",
    "it means that the consistency in @xmath4 for different choices of @xmath16 does not necessarily mean the consistency in network structure .",
    "the difference between the exponential tail and the power - law tail of @xmath16 is likely to cause qualitative discrepancy in @xmath30 . on the other hand",
    ", the degree correlation behaves similarly in all the examined cases , namely , @xmath79 . from a dynamical point of view",
    ", @xmath30 evolves from a general form to @xmath31 , which is realistic @xcite .",
    "this scenario matches the simulated dynamics shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : evolve](b ) . in this case , @xmath30 is initially just large for most vertices and converges to @xmath31 , which reflects the eventual separation of the network into the core and the peripheral part",
    ".    boosted by the original ba models , the power law of @xmath4 with @xmath114 has been pronounced in the first place @xcite . moreover , in percolation and contact processes on scale - free networks , the critical value of the infection rate is extinguished if @xmath152 @xcite .",
    "these results suggest relevance of the power law with @xmath153 .",
    "however , real scale - free networks have more dispersed values of @xmath8 @xcite , and many models have been proposed so that @xmath8 is tunable somewhere between 2 and @xmath154 @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the present model with intrinsic vertex weights ( also see refs .",
    "@xcite ) and another type of thresholding model @xcite broadly yield @xmath9 .",
    "we speculate that @xmath9 is another general law . in the parameter space of @xmath8",
    ", @xmath9 as well as @xmath7 often emerges as phase transition points of network characteristics @xcite .",
    "the @xmath9 law may be common to cooperative models such as those with thresholding , while the @xmath7 law underlies the competitive models represented by network growth with preferential attachment . actually , many real networks in the scale - free regime have @xmath8 close to 2 rather than to 3 @xcite .",
    "some networks such as the world wide web , e - mail networks , language networks , and ecological networks have @xmath8 even smaller than 2 @xcite .",
    "some of these observations can be understood as small deviations from our @xmath117 law , which may be explained by proper modification of the model @xcite , for example , by introducing stochastic thresholding @xcite , nonlinear relations between @xmath1 and @xmath18 @xcite , or many - body interactions .",
    "we have shown that the thresholding model , which is in the class of networks with intrinsic vertex weights , generates scale - free networks with @xmath9 , large @xmath3 , and small @xmath0 for a broad choice of weight distributions .",
    "even if we start with an arbitrary weight distribution , @xmath155 and @xmath31 are finally obtained .",
    "the competitive mechanisms , such as network growth with preferential attachment or hierarchical structure , are not mandatory for generating realistic networks @xcite",
    ". the cooperative thresholding mechanisms also result in desired properties rather generally , and they yield somewhat different characteristics from those of growing types of networks .",
    "in addition , they allow plausible physical interpretations , have core - peripheral structure , are equipped with inhomogeneity as in real networks , and facilitate analytical calculations @xcite .",
