    "graphene , a two - dimensional plane of carbon atoms arranged in a honeycomb lattice , has stimulated many experimental and theoretical efforts to study and understand its exotic electronic and optical properties  @xcite .",
    "graphene can be produced by mechanical exfoliation of bulk graphite  @xcite , by the decomposition of a sic substrate at high temperatures,@xcite or by epitaxial growth on different metal surfaces  @xcite .",
    "graphene on sic is well adapted for optical measurements as samples are of macroscopic size and lie on a substrate which can be insulating , and hence , transparent in a wide , from far - infrared to visible spectral range .",
    "raman scattering is a key element to graphene studies as it is a reliable and non - destructive technique to establish the monolayer character of a graphene specimen  @xcite or the negligeable interlayer coupling in multilayer epitaxial graphene ( meg ) samples @xcite .",
    "this relies on the analysis of the shape of the observed @xmath0 band feature ( the two - phonon peak around 2700  @xmath1 , also referred as @xmath2 or @xmath3 ) which is the second - order overtone of the @xmath4  band . while defects ( in a general meaning  impurities , interface roughness , etc . )",
    "are needed for the @xmath4 band to be observed , the @xmath0 band is always seen and it even appears as the most pronounced feature in the raman scattering spectrum of graphene . because of the doubly - resonant nature of the @xmath4  band@xcite and the fully - resonant nature of the @xmath0 band,@xcite they both show a dispersive behavior with the excitation energy , what allowed to tracing the phonon band structure of different carbon allotropes@xcite . in this paper , we show that a strong magnetic field applied perpendicular to the plane of a graphene crystal significantly affects the @xmath0 band feature . increasing the magnetic field up to 33 t",
    ", we observe a simultaneous red shift of the @xmath0 band energy and a strong broadening of the peak .    in the following , we show that the evolution of the @xmath0 band in magnetic field can be understood and modelled quantitatively as a pure orbital effect of the magnetic field on the intermediate states of the raman process , i.  e. , electrons and holes .",
    "the field induces circular orbits to the photo - generated electron - hole pairs , and this modifies the momenta of the optical phonons emitted during the raman scattering process .",
    "this leads to a red shift and to a broadening of the @xmath0  band feature as the magnetic field is increased , an effect that we observe experimentally and describe theoretically below .",
    "we note that this effect is not specific to a graphene monolayer as the two essential ingredients are the fully - resonant nature of the @xmath0  peak , and the free motion of electrons in the plane .",
    "thus , it should also be characteristic for the multilayer graphene and graphite .",
    "raman scattering measurements were performed in the backscattering geometry at liquid helium temperature and in magnetic fields up to 33  t applied perpendicular to the plane of the graphene crystal .",
    "a ti : saphire laser tuned at an accurately controlled wavelength of 720  nm ( corresponding to the incident photon energy @xmath5 ) was used for excitation .",
    "optical fibers , both with a core diameter of 200 @xmath6 m , were used for excitation and for collection . the resulting laser spot on the sample had a diameter of @xmath7600 @xmath6 m with a typical power of @xmath7100 mw .",
    "the samples presented in this study are meg grown by the thermal decomposition of the carbon face of a sic substrate @xcite . despite the fact that these samples contain @xmath770 layers , simple dirac - like electronic bands , such as the ones found in exfoliated graphene mono - layers ,",
    "persist in these highly graphitized structures because of the particular rotational stacking exhibited by the adjacent graphitic planes  @xcite .",
    "dirac fermions in such meg structures have been evidenced by magneto - transport  @xcite , by magneto - transmission  @xcite and , more recently , by scanning tunnelling spectroscopy  @xcite and by magneto - raman scattering experiments  @xcite .",
    "apart from the first few interface layers which are highly doped due to the charge transfer from the sic substrate  @xcite , the majority layers , which we probe with raman scattering , are quasi - neutral with densities as low as @xmath8 @xmath9 and mobilities as high as @xmath10 , as deduced from magneto - transmission experiments  @xcite .",
    "meg samples , and especially the highly graphitized specimens , are not homogenous on the scale of our laser spot and contain some bernal - stacked inclusions as observed through micro - raman scattering experiments  @xcite .",
    "typical raman scattering spectra of the @xmath0 band measured at @xmath11 and 30  t are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : spec ] . at zero field ,",
    "the @xmath0 band is observed as a slightly asymmetric feature composed of two lorentzian contributions . the main contribution to this feature",
    "is centered at 2646  @xmath1 with a full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of 26  @xmath1 and the second , weaker , contribution is centered at 2675  @xmath1 with a fwhm of 31  @xmath1 . as previously observed on similar samples  @xcite , the energy at which the @xmath0 band is observed is increased , for a given excitation wavelength , with respect to the energy at which the @xmath0 band is expected for exfoliated graphene flakes .",
    "the origin of this effect , probably due to the peculiar type of stacking of the graphitic planes and the resulting electronic interaction between these planes , is still a matter of debate  @xcite .",
    "the origin of the double component @xmath0 band feature observed in our experiment , different than the one observed in bulk graphite , is still not clear .",
    "it could be due to bernal - stacked inclusions under the large laser spot .",
    "we note that similar line shapes have also been observed in micro - raman scattering measurements on epitaxial graphene samples on sic and were interpreted as revealing graphene domains with different amount of strain  @xcite .",

    "from the very beginning , we would like to stress that the observed effect is quite unlikely to be related to the modification of the spectrum of the emitted phonons ( e.  g. , by electron - phonon interaction ) .",
    "indeed , electrochemically top gated graphene structures allowing to tune the fermi level up to 800  mev ( carrier density up to @xmath1310@xmath14 @xmath9 ) have been produced recently.@xcite raman scattering experiments in these highly doped structures showed that the evolution of the @xmath0 band central frequency with doping is moderate and monotonous , and can be described by a change of the equilibrium lattice parameter .",
    "modification of the phonon dispersion due to the coupling of phonons with low energy electronic excitations across the dirac point is noticeable near the @xmath15  point of the phonon band structure ( kohn anomaly ) , while the phonons involved in the @xmath0  band are too far from the @xmath15  point to be affected by the kohn anomaly .",
    "this argument remains valid even in magnetic fields used in our experiment .",
    "indeed , the magnetic field mixes wave vectors on the scale of the inverse magnetic length , @xmath16 at @xmath17 .",
    "the wave vector of the phonons responsible for the @xmath0  peak , measured from the @xmath15  point , is @xmath18 at 1.7 ev excitation .",
    "thus , @xmath19 and the kohn anomaly remains inaccessible for these phonons even at our highest fields .",
    "this is in striking contrast with the main first - order raman feature , the so - called @xmath20  band due to the doubly degenerate @xmath21 optical phonons at the @xmath22 point of the phonon band structure .",
    "these phonons are directly in the region of the kohn anomaly , and their frequency and lifetime are noticeably affected even by a moderate gate voltage.@xcite in strong magnetic fields , the @xmath20  band exhibits a pronounced magneto - phonon effect,@xcite as the phonon state is modified by the coupling to electronic inter - landau - level transitions.@xcite    in the following , we show that our observations are due to the finite curvature of the trajectories of the photo - excited electrons and holes in the magnetic field .",
    "the main idea is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : trajectories ] . in the semi - classical real - space picture of the raman",
    "process,@xcite the incident photon creates an electron and the hole with opposite momenta at an arbitrary location within the laser spot .",
    "they subsequently propagate along the classical trajectories , and emit phonons .",
    "if they meet at some other location , again with opposite momenta , they can recombine radiatively producing a scattered photon . in the absence of the magnetic field , the trajectories are straight lines , so that in order to meet at the same point with opposite momenta and contribute to the raman scattering signal",
    ", the electron and the hole must necessarily be scattered backwards during the phonon emission.@xcite this fixes the phonon momentum  @xmath23 ( measured from the @xmath15 or @xmath24 point ) as @xmath25 , where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the electronic momenta ( also measured from the dirac points ) before and after the phonon emission , @xmath28  is the excitation frequency , @xmath29  is the phonon frequency , and @xmath30  is the electronic velocity ( the slope of the dirac cones ) . a slight spread in the phonon momentum due to the quantum uncertainty , @xmath31 ( @xmath32  being the electron inelastic scattering rate ) , gives a contribution to the width of the @xmath0  peak , @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the phonon group velocity.@xcite    in a magnetic field , the electron and hole trajectories are no longer straight lines but , because of the lorentz force that acts on charged particles in a magnetic field , they correspond to circular cyclotron orbits . as a result , one can see from fig .",
    "[ fig : trajectories ] that ( i )  phonons with smaller momenta , @xmath35 , can be emitted , and ( ii )  since each phonon can be emitted at an arbitrary instant in time , the length of the arc describing the electron trajectory is random [ not exceeding the electron mean free path @xmath36 , and so are the angles  @xmath37 . note that the frequencies of the two emitted phonons remain equal even with an applied magnetic field due to the symmetry under @xmath38 rotation around the axis perpendicular to the crystal plane .",
    "tuning the magnetic field is , in this sense , equivalent to changing the resonant conditions of the raman scattering process at a fixed excitation wavelength and allows exploring part of the phonon band structure closer to the @xmath15 point .",
    "fact  ( i ) results in the overall red shift of the raman peak , while fact ( ii )  introduces an additional spread in  @xmath39 , and contributes significantly to the broadening of the peak as observed through raman scattering measurements .    to produce the observed effects , the electron and the hole do not have to complete a full orbit .",
    "the probability of this latter event vanishes as @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the cyclotron radius .",
    "this implies that the separation between the electronic landau levels , @xmath42 , may still be smaller than their broadening @xmath43 and , in our experiment , this is still the case even at @xmath44 . in other words ,",
    "even magnetic fields far from the quantization limit can give a noticeable effect .",
    "a closely related effect has been discussed in the context of density - density response of a degenerate electron gas in a non - quantizing magnetic field  @xcite .    to obtain some more quantitative information about the behavior of the @xmath0 peak in magnetic fields ,",

    "it is convenient to perform the calculation in the coordinate representation , analogously to the calculation for the @xmath4  peak in the vicinity of an edge@xcite ( details of this calculation are presented in the appendix ) .",
    "an essential ingredient of the calculation is the semiclassical electronic green s function for graphene in a magnetic field which was calculated in ref .  .",

    "since the density of the final phonon states is practically @xmath39-independent@xcite , @xmath53 describes the raman scattering intensity as a function of  @xmath54 , the raman shift measured with respect to the center of the @xmath0 peak at zero field . to illustrate the change of the peak shape in magnetic fields , we present in fig .",

    "this value for @xmath62 is chosen in order to reproduce the observed shift of the peak maximum for increasing magnetic fields . however , the resulting fwhm for the @xmath0 band is about twice smaller than the one observed experimentally at zero field .",
    "most likely , this indicates the presence of an additional broadening mechanism besides the electronic scattering . as we can not determine the nature of this mechanism , we model it by introducing phenomenologically an additional broadening of the @xmath0 band through a convolution of @xmath63 with a gaussian curve of width @xmath64 : @xmath65 there is no simple relation between the fwhm of the original @xmath63 peak ( @xmath66 at zero field ) , the fwhm of the broadening gaussian ( @xmath67 ) , and the fwhm of the resulting peak .",

    "this approximation is reasonable as long as the magnetic field is non - quantizing.@xcite at @xmath44 , electrons with energy @xmath69 measured from the dirac point , have a cyclotron frequency @xmath70 of about @xmath71 , so the strongest magnetic fields in this experiment seem to be close to the limits of validity of this approximation",
    ". beyond this regime , landau quantization of the electronic spectrum should manifest itself as oscillations of the peak intensity due to periodic modifications of the resonance conditions with increasing magnetic field , while in the experiment no such oscillations are observed .",

    "[ fig : param ] ( a)(d ) . clearly , without precise knowledge of the origin of the two @xmath0  band components we can not account for the slight difference in their zero - field widths .",
    "nevertheless , the fact that the calculation reproduces the red shift of the @xmath0 band energy as a function of the magnetic field which is quadratic for fields up to 510  t and linear at higher fields , with a single value of  @xmath62 for both components , shows that the electrons have the same dynamics in the parts of the sample , responsible for the two components .",
    "besides , the deduced value of @xmath61 is in good agreement with that deduced from the doping dependence of the @xmath0  peak intensity in exfoliated graphene@xcite ( given the energy dependence of  @xmath62 and the fact that the latter measurements were performed at higher excitation energy , the electron scattering in those samples is somewhat weaker than in ours ) .",
    "we also note that the found value @xmath61 is in reasonable agreement with the line width of electronic transitions in high magnetic fields measured in this range of energy on similar samples.@xcite this fact is remarkable because those measurements were performed in a quantizing magnetic field , and _ a priori _ the scattering rate does not have to be the same.@xcite    from eq .",

    "( it is sufficient to integrate over  @xmath39 first , and then over  @xmath74 ; the magnetic field enters only through  @xmath75 , which drops out . )",
    "this means that under the assumption of a constant phonon density of states , the frequency - integrated intensity ( the area under the peak ) of the @xmath0  band should not depend on the magnetic field .",

    "only the integrated intensity of the high - frequency component is field independent , while an overall decrease of @xmath76 of the integrated intensity of the low - frequency component is observed over the range of  @xmath77 between 0 and 33  t. does it mean that the phonon density of states decreases stronger for the lower - frequency component ? again , without precise knowledge of the exact nature of the two components it is hard to give an explanation for their different behavior .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied , both experimentally and theoretically , the evolution of the @xmath0 band of meg structures in intense magnetic fields .",
