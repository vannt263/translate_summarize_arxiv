    "highly sensitive methods of kerr and faraday rotation spectroscopy give a possibility to probe spin orientation within subpicosecond resolution  @xcite . a challenging problem in the spin physics",
    "is how to affect the spin by instantaneous non - magnetic methods , in particular , by static or optical electric fields . in semiconductors ,",
    "optical selection rules allow one to create spin - oriented carriers ( optical orientation ) which may then be accelerated by a static external electric field .",
    "another possibility to monitor the spin by electrical means arises due to the spin - orbit interaction which couples the electron orbital and spin degrees of freedom . in semiconductor heterostructures ,",
    "the spin - orbit interaction is described by the rashba and dresselhaus contributions to the electron effective hamiltonian linear in the electron quasimomentum @xmath0 , for review see ref .",
    "generally , they can be presented as follows @xmath1 where @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) are the pauli matrices , @xmath4 is a second - rank pseudotensor , and the effective momentum - dependent larmor frequency is defined by @xmath5 .",
    "hereafter , for definiteness , we consider zinc - blende - lattice based quantum wells grown along the direction [ 001 ] and use the coordinate frame @xmath6 , y \\parallel [ 110]$ ] and @xmath7 $ ] .",
    "we study here the electron spin dynamics in semiconductor heterostructures in the presence of an external in - plane electric field .",
    "the attention is focused on the so - called streaming regime  @xcite characterized by the periodic optical - phonon emission by electrons subjected to acceleration in the strong electric field .",
    "a number of interesting time - resolved spin effects are shown to be caused by the electric field .",
    "we also discuss a possibility to detect them in the pump - probe experiments , both in the absence and presence of an external magnetic field .",
    "in an external electric field @xmath8 , the carrier distribution is anisotropic in the momentum space . in particular , it is characterized by a nonzero electron drift momentum @xmath9 in the opposite to field direction .",
    "for comparatively weak fields @xmath10",
    "kv / cm , the anisotropy is weak : the ratio @xmath11 is smaller than @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the root - mean - square of the electron quasimomentum in the absence of the field .",
    "an application of the increasing field leads to a transformation from the linear dependence @xmath14 to the saturated behaviour .",
    "if the interparticle collisions play a minor role in the kinetics , the electron momentum - space distribution in strong electric fields becomes extremely anisotropic , _",
    "each electron accelerates quasiballistically in the `` passive '' region until reaching the threshold energy equal the optical - phonon energy @xmath15 and the corresponding threshold quasimomentum @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the electron effective mass .",
    "then it looses its energy by emitting an optical phonon and starts the next period of acceleration .",
    "thus , in the streaming regime realized in an appropriate range of the dc electric fields , the electron distribution in the momentum space has a steaming - like , or needle - like , form spread between the @xmath18-point @xmath19 and the point @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the unit vector in the direction opposite to the electric field @xmath22 .",
    "the formation of such an anisotropic electron distribution requires the following hierarchy of times @xmath23 here @xmath24 is the time of optical phonon emission by an electron in the `` active '' energy region exceeding @xmath15 , @xmath25 is the travel time through the passive region of the momentum space , @xmath26 is the momentum relaxation time due to electron scattering by acoustic phonons or static imperfections , and @xmath27 is the electron - electron collision time .",
    "the electron - electron scattering tends to convert the anisotropic distribution to the shifted maxwellian distribution with an effective electron temperature and a drift velocity @xmath28 .",
    "the corresponding time can be estimated by @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the electron 2d density and @xmath31 is the dielectric constant .    the electron distribution function @xmath32 is given by  @xcite @xmath33 where @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36\\:.\\ ] ] one can see from eq .",
    "( [ spin_independ ] ) that the penetration @xmath37 into the active region and the width @xmath38 of the distribution in the transverse direction @xmath39 are given by @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "thus , the needle - like distribution is formed provided @xmath42 which establishes the upper limit for the electric field strength . in this case",
    "the function @xmath43 can be approximated by the heaviside function @xmath44 and @xmath45 by @xmath46 .",
    "it is also worth to mention that the value @xmath47 gives the ratio between the numbers of particles in the passive and active regions as well as the ratio @xmath48 of the times spend by electrons in these regions .",
    "if the electrons are spin polarized with the average spin @xmath49 per particle , their spin distribution function in the @xmath50-space is given by the main contribution @xmath51 and an additional term of the order of @xmath52 .      in order to analyze consequences of elastic scattering by static imperfections , impurities and interface roughness , and/or quasi - elastic scattering by acoustic phonons , we start with the approximation of `` ideal streaming '' replacing the smoothed delta - function @xmath53 in eq .",
    "( [ spin_independ ] ) by the dirac delta - function and the smoothed theta - function @xmath54 by the heaviside step function .",
    "then the streaming distribution in the passive region reduces to @xmath55 in the following we include into consideration the elastic scattering by short - range imperfections and describe the scattering process @xmath56 by the rate @xmath57 normalized on the inverse momentum relaxation time @xmath26 as follows @xmath58 since the streaming regime is achieved provided @xmath26 is much longer than the travel time @xmath59 we treat the elastic scattering keeping the first order corrections in @xmath60 to the electron distribution function ( [ zero ] ) .",
    "then the scatter of electrons over all azymuthal angles @xmath61 gives rise to a correction @xmath62 which , in the passive region , satisfies the equation @xmath63 with the boundary condition @xmath64 at @xmath65 . here",
    "the right - hand side term represents the generation of electrons to the whole area @xmath66 due to the elastic scattering from the zeroth - approximation needle ( [ spin_independ ] ) while the term on the left - hand side describes the further acceleration of the scattered electrons in the electric field .",

    "these electrons reach the sphere @xmath71 , emit optical phonons and return to the point @xmath72 thus , in the first approximation , the total density @xmath30 should be replaced by @xmath73 . the perturbation procedure can be continued by the replacements @xmath74 and @xmath75 in the right- and left - hand sides of eq .",
    "( [ first ] ) , respectively .",
    "the constriction of the distribution function @xmath76 along the @xmath39 axis and the electron homogeneous occupation of the @xmath77 interval between 0 and @xmath78 substantially modifies the dyakonov - perel spin relaxation of the @xmath79 component controlled by the linear-@xmath50 term @xmath80 in eq .",

    "now we consider effect of elastic scattering on the spin relaxation and show that even the first - order correction in the ratio @xmath92 can modify @xmath82 .",

    "in systems with the effective hamiltonian containing the @xmath0-linear terms , the application of an electric field results in orientation of electron spins . such electrical spin orientation is allowed by the symmetry only in gyrotropic systems where some components of the second - rank pseudotensor @xmath4 are nonzero . in weak fields ,",
    "this effect has been studied in many works , see the review  @xcite , references therein , and the recent paper  @xcite . the spin polarization created by a weak electric field",
