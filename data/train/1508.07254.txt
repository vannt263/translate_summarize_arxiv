    "the blazar cta  102 ( b2230 + 114 ) is classified as a highly polarized quasar ( hpq ) , characterized by optical polarization exceeding 3%  @xcite .",
    "its high variability at optical wavelengths  @xcite and its spectral properties identify it also as an optically violent variable ( ovv ) quasar  @xcite .",
    "microvariability of cta  102 at optical wavelengths has been investigated by @xcite , who found that faster variability is associated with higher flux states .",

    "a radio flare in 1997 was related to the ejection of a new knot from the core @xcite , and another , in 2006 , was connected with both the ejection of a new superluminal feature and the interaction between this component and a recollimation shock at 0.1 mas  @xcite .",

    "recent mojave polarimetric multifrequency observations  @xcite reveal a rotation measure gradient across the jet width at 7 mas from the core , which suggests the presence of a helical magnetic field in the jet .",

    "this smaller viewing angle of the jet with respect to the observer during the second radio flare , which appears to last until the end of our vlba dataset ( june 2014 ) , is also in agreement with the significant differences observed between the ejections of components n1 and n4 . while component n1 is clearly identified in the jet as a bright ( @xmath46 jy ) component soon after its ejection , most of the increase in the total flux density during the second radio flare appears to be associated with the core region ( c0+c1 ) , with component n4 representing only a small fraction of the flare .",
    "the smaller viewing angle of the jet also leads to a more difficult identification of component n4 , which is not clearly discerned from the core until may 2014 ( 2014.33 ) .",
    "further support for the re - orientation of the jet toward the observed is also obtained from the analysis of the polarization , discussed in section [ sec : pol ] .",
    "to quantify the relationship among the light curves at the different wave bands , we perform a discrete cross - correlation analysis .",
    "the z - transformed discrete correlation function ( zdcf ) described by @xcite has been designed for unevenly sampled light curves , as in our case .",
    "we use the publicly available _",
    "zdcf@xmath17v1.2 _ and _ plike@xmath17v4.0.f90 _ programs , with a minimum number of 11 points inside each bin , as recommended for a meaningful statistical interpretation .",
    "we compute the dcf between each pair of light curves , including data from 100 days before to 100 days after the main @xmath0-ray outburst .",
    "time sampling of the light curves ranges from one day for the @xmath0-ray data to tens of days in the case of some other wavebands ( see figure  [ fig : cta102_mwl_lc ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : dcf ] displays the zdcf analysis for the optical-@xmath0 ( upper panel ) and uv-@xmath0 ( lower panel ) data .",
    "we find that the correlation peaks between the @xmath0-ray light curve and the optical and uv light curves give a time lag of @xmath47 and @xmath48 days , respectively , where a positive lag means that the @xmath0-ray variations lead .",
    "we therefore conclude that the variations at the three wavelengths are essentially coincident within the uncertainties .",
    "the sparser sampling of the x - ray data , as well as its double - peaked structure , precludes a reliable zdcf analysis .",
    "however , we note that the first x - ray data peak is coincident with the @xmath0-ray flare , and the second brighter x - ray flare occurs @xmath650 days later ( see figure  [ fig : cta102_mwl_lc ] ) .",
    "the triple - flare structure of the nir light curve during the @xmath0-ray flare ( see figure  [ fig : cta102_nir ] ) also prevents a unique interpretation of a cross - correlation analysis .",
    "nevertheless , from inspection of the light curves , we see that the first , brightest peak in the nir light curve ( 56193 mjd ) is simultaneous with the @xmath0-ray outburst within an uncertainty of 1 day , corresponding to the time sampling of both light curves .",
    "we obtain no significant correlation between the millimeter - wave and @xmath0-ray light curves .",
    "this can be due to the different timescales associated with the emission at these wavebands , as suggested also for other blazars ( e.g. , 1156 + 295 , * ? ? ?",
    "the rise time for the millimeter wave band is of the order of months , while for the @xmath0-rays it is of the order of few days .",
    "we note , however , that the 1 , 3 , and 7 mm light curves contain a significant flare coincident with the @xmath0-ray outburst .",

    "no significant increase in the degree of polarization at millimeter wavelengths is observed during the @xmath0-ray flare , but the evpas display a progressive rotation starting about one year prior to the @xmath0-ray flare .",
    "figure  [ fig : cta102_mwl_pol ] shows that between 2007 and mid-2011 the evpas at 3 and 1  mm are distributed around a mean value of @xmath6100@xmath5 . after this , the polarization at millimeter wavelengths starts a slow rotation by almost 80@xmath5 in one year ( from 2011 july to 2012 august ) , until the flare epoch . in coincidence with the @xmath0-ray flare , the rate of evpa rotation in the vlbi core and stationary component c1 increases significantly , leading to a rotation of almost 200@xmath5 in one year .",
    "subsequently , component n4 appears and the evpas of both c1 and n4 rotate again toward values similar to those at 1 and 3 mm , reaching @xmath52 .",
    "it is possible that during the flare , while the new superluminal component n4 is crossing the core zone , the evpas of the innermost region at 7 mm rotate due to the passage of the component .",
    "after this , when n4 can be distinguished from c1 and c0 , the evpas at 7 mm again follow the general behavior of the evpas at shorter millimeter wavelengths .",
    "a similar discrepancy between the 1 - 3  mm and 7  mm evpas occurs between mid-2009 and mid-2010 , when component n1 is ejected and becomes brighter than the core until mid-2010 ( see figure  [ fig : flux_comp ] ) .",

    "the latter leads to a rotation of the mm - evpas of @xmath6200@xmath5 over 3 years ( from 2011 july to 2014 august ) .",
    "this progressive rotation in the evpas can be produced by a change in the orientation of the innermost jet , which would be in agreement with the larger doppler factor and smaller viewing angle of component n4 associated with the @xmath0-ray event , as discussed previously ( see   [ sec:4 ] ) .",
    "the optical polarization executes rapid and pronounced changes in both degree of polarization and evpa associated with the @xmath0-ray flare .",

    "the plot of stokes parameters u vs.  q in figure  [ fig : uvsq ] reveals a clear clockwise rotation of the evpas ( marked in blue ) , in coincidence with the main flare in total flux and a rapid change in the degree of polarization .",
    "this clockwise rotation has been previously reported by @xcite .",
    "if we assume a model in which a relativistic shock does not cover the entire cross - section of the jet and is moving down the jet following helical magnetic field lines , which also propagate downstream , then we expect to observe a rotation in the evpa . this should be accompanied by a change in the degree of polarization , with a minimum in the middle of the rotation , where the flaring region contains magnetic field lines with opposite polarity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "evidences of a helical magnetic field in cta  102 jet can also be found in the detection of negative circular polarization @xcite and in a gradient in the rotation measure across the jet width at about 7 mas from the core @xcite , both in mojave observations .",

    "the synchrotron peak frequency during the flare is close to 10@xmath55 hz , at the upper end of the frequency range 10@xmath56 - 10@xmath55 hz of synchrotron peaks observed in luminous blazars @xcite . at the same time",
    ", we also observe a shift in the inverse compton peak to higher frequencies , which leads to a hardening of the spectrum between 0.1 and 1 gev .",
    "we note that neither of the other two , weaker @xmath0-ray flares display a similar shift in the peak of the inverse compton spectrum .",
    "in particular , the weaker first and third @xmath0-ray flares display a very similar inverse compton spectrum , peaking at nearly the same frequency , with only a minor hardening toward higher energies during the third flare .",
    "the shift of the @xmath0-ray peak toward higher frequencies during the main @xmath0-ray flare can be explained by a change in the viewing angle  leading to an increase in doppler factor  of the emitting region , in support of our hypothesis of a reorientation of the jet toward the line of sight during the multi - wavelength flare ( see    [ sec:4 ] and [ sec : pol ] ) .",
    "the ratio of the inverse compton to synchrotron peaks is of the order of 10 , which is not sufficiently large to rule out synchrotron self - compton scattering as the main mechanism for the production of the @xmath0-ray emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we have presented a multi - wavelength polarimetric study of the quasar cta  102 during an unprecedented @xmath0-ray outburst that was observed between 2012 september 23 and october 2 .",
    "we find that the @xmath0-ray outburst occurred simultaneously with flares from millimeter to x - ray wavelengths , with the exception that the 1 and 7 mm light curves peak almost one month after the shorter - wavelength flares .",
    "however , all of the millimeter - wave light curves begin to increase before the shorter - wavelength outburst , but took longer times to reach maximum flux and then to decay .    our dcf analysis confirms the coincidence between the @xmath0-ray flare and the optical - uv flare .",
    "the same analysis does not provide unambiguous correlation between the x - ray or nir and the @xmath0-ray light curves because of the multi - peak structure of the flare at these two frequencies and the relatively sparse sampling .",
    "the _ fermi _ lat daily light curve reveals two more @xmath0-ray outbursts apart from that in 2012 : one in 2011 june and the other in 2013 april .",
    "both outbursts are weaker and `` orphan '' . only the bright outburst in 2012",
    "september - october is coincident with flares at the other wavelengths and with the emergence of a new superluminal knot from the radio core .",
    "we have combined our multi - wavelength study of light curves with an analysis of multi - epoch vlba observations at 43 ghz that provide the necessary angular resolution to follow the evolution of the jet during the outburst . in the 43 ghz vlba images ,",
    "we observe the ejection of multiple superluminal knots from the radio core during the analyzed period , but only one of these knots , n4 , is associated with a @xmath0-ray flare .",
    "component n4 was ejected in @xmath57 , within a time range between 47 and 127 days before the main @xmath0-ray flare in 2012 ( 2012.73 ) , when the radio core started to increase in flux density .",
    "the interaction between a traveling feature and the stationary radio core appears to have triggered a number of @xmath0-ray outbursts in blazars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and radiogalaxies  @xcite .",
    "however , not every ejection of a new knot leads to a @xmath0-ray flare .",
    "for instance , it is not clear why a @xmath0-ray flare is associated with n4 in cta  102 and not with the other moving radio components .    from the analysis of model - fit components at 43 ghz",
    ", we deduce that the jet changed its orientation with respect to the observer when component n4 was ejected .",
    "this is derived from an analysis of the variability doppler factor and viewing angle , which indicates that a progressive increase in the doppler factor occurred , caused by a re - orientation of the jet toward the line of sight .",
    "this led to a minimum viewing angle of @xmath41.2@xmath5 when component n4 was ejected during the @xmath0-ray outburst .",
    "this change in the orientation of the jet is supported by the observed progressive , slow rotation of the millimeter - wave evpas starting almost one year before the ejection of n4 and the @xmath0-ray flare .",
    "we therefore conclude that the @xmath0-ray emission in cta  102 is related to a decrease in the viewing angle of the jet .",
    "this correlation between @xmath0-ray activity and orientation of the jet has been already observed in other bl lac objects @xcite , quasars @xcite , and radio galaxies @xcite , although there are different interpretations regarding the cause of the change in orientation .",
    "some authors consider a bent or precessing jet , while others suggest a helical jet with the radiating component following this helical path",
    ". a helical trajectory could also be the consequence of magnetic field lines twisting around a conical or parabolic jet @xcite .",
    "in the case of cta  102 , there are indications of a helical magnetic field structure @xcite .",
    "we associate the fast variability in the polarized optical emission , as well as the clockwise rotation displayed in the evpas during the outburst , with the helical path followed by the superluminal component in its motion along the outwardly propagating magnetic field lines . on the other hand , a number of similar rotations of the mm - wave and optical polarization vectors occurred in both the clockwise and counterclockwise directions over the entire 20042014 monitoring period .",
    "this can be interpreted in terms of random walks of a turbulent magnetic field @xcite .",
    "early results from the robopol program show that , while many evpa rotations related to @xmath0-ray flares can be produced by a random walk process , some are not @xcite .",
    "if the rotation associated with a @xmath0-ray flare is caused by a helical geometry of the magnetic field , then future such outbursts should be accompanied by similar clockwise rotations .",
    "the observed long - term rotation in millimeter - wave polarization vectors , together with the slower proper motion associated with component n4 , suggest a change in the jet orientation , so that it becomes more closely aligned with the line of sight during the ejection of component n4 and the multi - wavelength flare .    the close timing of the @xmath0-ray , x - ray , uv , and optical flares suggests co - spatiality of the emission at all these frequencies .",
    "knot n4 was 0.025 to 0.07 mas downstream of the core when the @xmath0-ray flare occurred , i.e. , it had not yet reached feature c1 at @xmath60.1 mas .",
    "this is confirmed by the increase in flux density in the 7 mm core during the @xmath0-ray outburst .",
    "hence we conclude that the bright @xmath0-ray outburst occurred inside the mm - wave core region .",
    "we observe component n4 for the first time in the vlba images on 2013 april ( mjd 56398 ) , when it was located at @xmath580.12 mas .",
    "the @xmath0-ray flare in 2013 april occurred between mjd 56387 and 56394 .",
    "therefore , a possible interpretation of this flare is the passage of component n4 through c1 , interpreted by @xcite as a possible recollimation shock .",
    "if the radio core were located within @xmath59 pc of the black hole ( bh ) , then the accretion disk or the broad line region could provide the necessary photon field to explain the high energy emission through external compton scattering .",
    "the 43 ghz radio core in cta  102 must be coincident with , or downstream of , the 86 ghz core that is located at a distance of @xmath60 pc ( @xmath61 gravitational radii for a bh mass of @xmath62 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) from the bh @xcite .",
    "a similar scaled distance , @xmath63@xmath64 gravitational radii , has been determined also for two radio galaxies , 3c  111 and 3c  120  @xcite and two blazars , bl lac and 3c  279  @xcite . for a mean viewing angle of the jet of cta  102 of 2.6@xmath5 @xcite",
    ", the distance of n4 from c0 is 4.613 pc , hence the @xmath0-ray outburst took place more than 12 pc from the bh . at this location",
    ", there should be a negligible contribution of photons from the disk or the broad line region , nor from the dusty torus ( located @xmath61.6 pc from the bh ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , for external compton scattering to produce the high energy flare .",
    "the lack of a suitably strong external source of photons favors synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) scattering of nir to uv photons by electrons in the jet with energies @xmath65 times the rest - mass energy , as the source of the @xmath0-ray emission .",
    "the ratio of @xmath0-ray to infrared ( synchrotron ) luminosity is @xmath66 , sufficiently low to be consistent with the ssc process .",
    "our study of the time variability of the multi - wavelength flux and linear polarization of the quasar cta  102 confirms its erratic blazar nature , revealing both strong connections across wave bands in one outburst and no obvious connections for other events . the bright @xmath0-ray outburst in late 2012",
    "was accompanied by contemporaneous flares at longer wavelengths up to at least 8 mm , with the increase in mm - wave flux starting before the @xmath0-ray activity .",
    "the polarization vector at both optical and millimeter wavelengths rotated from the time of the @xmath0-ray peak until @xmath67 days later . a new superluminally moving knot , n4  the feature with the highest doppler beaming factor during our monitoring ,",
    "according to our analysis  was coincident with the core in the 43 ghz vlba images 47127 days prior to the @xmath0-ray peak .",
    "we conclude that the outburst was so luminous because the jet ( or , at least , the portion of the jet where most of the emission occurs ) had shifted to a direction closer to the line of sight than was previously the case .",
    "the time delay between the epoch when n4 crossed the centroid of the core ( feature c0 ) and the epoch of peak @xmath0-ray emission implies that the main flare took place @xmath68 pc from the black hole . at this distance ,",
    "the only plausible source of seed photons for inverse compton scattering is nir to uv emission from the jet itself .",
    "the ratio of @xmath0-ray to infrared luminosity is only @xmath69 at the peak of the outburst , low enough to be consistent with ssc high - energy emission .",
    "multiple superluminal knots appeared in the jet during the 7 years covered by our vlba observations .",
    "these include a very bright component ( n1 ) ejected in @xmath70 and associated with a significant mm - wave flare in the core region ( @xmath64.2 jy ) .",
    "yet only component n4 is related to a flare at @xmath0-ray energies .",
    "two strong `` orphan '' @xmath0-ray flares have no apparent optical counterparts .",
    "a strong mm - wave event with neither a @xmath0-ray nor optical counterpart can be explained by an inability of the event to accelerate electrons up to energies @xmath71 needed to radiate at such frequencies , although the reason for this inability is unclear .",
    "orphan @xmath0-ray flares might be explained by a knot crossing a region where there is a higher local density of seed photons for inverse compton scattering @xcite .",
    "indeed , the second orphan flare corresponds to the time of passage of knot n4 through stationary feature c1 ( located  @xmath72 mas from the core ) , which could be such a region .    during the multi - wavelength outburst we observe intra - day variability in the optical polarized emission , as well as a clockwise rotation in optical evpas .",
    "this rotation could be caused by a spiral path traced by the knot moving along helical magnetic field lines that propagate outwards relativistically .",
    "alternatively , the various rotations of the polarization vector seen in our dataset , which are in the clockwise and counterclockwise direction over different time ranges , could be mainly random walks caused by a turbulent magnetic field .",
    "cta  102 displays the complex behavior characteristic of the blazar class of active galactic nuclei .",
    "nevertheless , we have found possible connections between variations in the multi - wavelength flux and polarization and in the structure of the jet in some events . continued monitoring of cta  102 and other bright blazars at multiple wave bands with as dense sampling as possible , combined with mm - wave vlbi imaging ,",
    "can eventually determine which connections are robust and the extent to which stochastic processes dominate the behavior of blazars .",
