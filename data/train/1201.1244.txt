    "a @xmath0-symmetric quantum theory is described by a hamiltonian that commutes with @xmath0 , where the operators @xmath1 and @xmath2 perform space reflection and time reversal @xcite .",
    "even if a @xmath0-symmetric hamiltonian is not dirac hermitian ( that is , it is not invariant under combined matrix transposition and complex conjugation ) , the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian can still be entirely real .",
    "@xmath0-symmetric hamiltonians are particularly interesting because they often have a parametric region of _ unbroken _ @xmath3 symmetry in which the eigenvalues are all real and a region of _ broken _ @xmath0 symmetry in which some of the eigenvalues are complex @xcite .",
    "these regions are separated by a phase transition that has been repeatedly observed in laboratory experiments @xcite .",
    "a heavily studied class of @xmath0-symmetric hamiltonians is @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a real parameter .",
    "the eigenvalues of this hamiltonian are all real when @xmath14 and mostly complex when @xmath15 .",
    "thus , the region of unbroken @xmath0 symmetry is @xmath14 and the region of broken @xmath0 symmetry is @xmath15 .",
    "these two regions are separated by a phase transition at @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "a special example of a @xmath0-symmetric hamiltonian whose eigenvalues are all real and positive is the cubic hamiltonian @xmath17 the @xmath18-dimensional , euclidean - space , field - theoretic equivalent of this quantum - mechanical theory is described by the lagrangian density @xmath19 this lagrangian is clearly not hermitian , but if we assume that the field @xmath20 transforms as a pseudoscalar , then it is @xmath0-symmetric .",
    "this is because under this assumption , @xmath20 changes sign under space reflection @xmath1 , and since @xmath21 changes sign under @xmath2 , the interaction term is @xmath0 invariant .",
    "while a conventional @xmath8 theory is interesting from a theoretical point of view , it is , of course , a physically unacceptable theory because the real cubic potential @xmath22 is not bounded below . as a consequence",
    ", there can not be a stable ground state .",
    "perturbation theory provides an easy intuitive explanation for the absence of a stable ground state .",
    "the feynman graphical rules for a conventional @xmath8 quantum field theory follow directly from the lagrangian density @xmath23 the momentum - space amplitudes for a vertex and a line are @xmath24 using these feynman rules , we can in principle calculate the ground - state energy density @xmath25 by summing all connected vacuum graphs . because all such graphs have even numbers of vertices , this sum takes the form of a formal taylor series in powers of @xmath26 : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the contribution of graphs having @xmath29 vertices .",
    "the key point here is that all graphs contributing to the ground - state energy density have the same sign and add in phase , and thus the coefficients in the series ( [ e6 ] ) all have the same sign .",
    "this series is divergent because the number of graphs having @xmath29 vertices grows like @xmath30 @xcite , but unlike the perturbation series for a @xmath10 field theory , it is not a stieltjes series @xcite because it does not alternate in sign .",
    "consequently , the borel sum @xcite of the perturbation series has a cut on the real - positive axis in the complex-@xmath26 plane .",
    "this perturbative argument shows that the ground - state energy density is complex ; the imaginary part of the energy density is the discontinuity across the cut .",
    "we conclude that the ground - state of the conventional @xmath8 theory is unstable ; that is , it decays ( tunnels out to infinity through the barrier in the potential ) with a lifetime given by the imaginary part of @xmath31 .    on the other hand",
    ", perturbation theory also gives a simple intuitive argument that the non - hermitian , @xmath0-symmetric lagrangian density ( [ e3 ] ) defines a theory with a stable ground state .",
    "note that the cubic potential in this theory is complex , and thus we can not ask whether it is unbounded below . the idea of a potential being bounded below applies only if the potential is real ; unlike the real numbers , the complex numbers are not ordered , so the notion of boundedness simply does not apply .",
    "we obtain the @xmath0-symmetric lagrangian in ( [ e3 ] ) from the conventional lagrangian in ( [ e4 ] ) by replacing @xmath32 by @xmath33 .",
    "when we do so , the perturbation series in ( [ e6 ] ) now _ alternates in sign_. as a consequence , it is a series of stieltjes and its borel sum is _ real _ @xcite .",
    "we conclude from this argument that it is likely that the ground - state for this theory is stable .",
    "while this perturbative argument is only heuristic , there is a rigorous proof @xcite that the spectrum of the cubic , quantum - mechanical @xmath3-symmetric hamiltonian in ( [ e2 ] ) is real and bounded below .",
    "it is not yet known at a rigorous level whether the energy levels of the unconventional quantum field theory in ( [ e3 ] ) are real and bounded below because for this theory one can only rely on perturbative calculations .    to show that the @xmath0-symmetric quantum field theory in ( [ e3 ] ) is a physically acceptable quantum theory one must ( in addition to proving that the spectrum of the theory is bounded below ) verify that there is a hilbert space with a positive inner product and that time evolution is unitary . to demonstrate this , one would have to show that there exists a linear operator @xmath34 whose square is unity and that @xmath34 commutes with both the hamiltonian and with the @xmath0 operator @xcite . in perturbation",
    "theory the @xmath34 operator for the @xmath7 theory has been calculated to leading order @xcite , but it is not known rigorously whether the lagrangian ( [ e3 ] ) defines a physically acceptable theory .",
    "( there may even be a critical value of @xmath32 at which a @xmath3 phase transition from a physically acceptable theory having real energies to an unphysical theory having complex eigenvalues occurs . )",
    "however , we do know for certain that the conventional @xmath8 lagrangian in ( [ e4 ] ) defines a physically _ unacceptable _ theory !    while the conventional lagrangian in ( [ e4 ] ) is physically unacceptable and the unconventional lagrangian in ( [ e3 ] ) may or may not be physically acceptable , it is certainly interesting to study these lagrangians from a mathematical point of view .",
    "the purpose of this article is to examine and contrast the renormalization - group properties of these two lagrangians .",
    "we will show that while a conventional @xmath8 theory in @xmath9 dimensions is asymptotically free , the @xmath7 theory is like a @xmath10 theory in @xmath11 dimensions ; that is , it is stable , perturbatively renormalizable , and trivial .    this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",

    "@xmath47 is marginal ( just as @xmath48 is marginal at @xmath49 ) .",
    "the theory turns out to be asymptotically free , as we will see below .",
    "normally , in textbooks the @xmath47 theory at or near @xmath9 dimensions is discussed for pedagogical reasons @xcite .",
    "this is because the perturbative results are easily established and the theory provides a simple example of an asymptotically free theory .",
    "furthermore , unlike the @xmath10 theory in @xmath11 dimensions , a contribution to the wave function renormalization constant @xmath50 is already present at the one - loop level . however , no physical meaning is attached to the conventional @xmath8 theory because , as noted earlier , it is unstable ( that is , the spectrum is unbounded below ) .    let us now examine the behavior of this @xmath8 theory near @xmath9 .",
    "let @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 represent the three integrals that appear in @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 above .",
    "with the help of ( [ e13 ] ) , at @xmath57 we get @xmath58 where here and in the following we introduce the t hooft scale @xmath59 and give only the divergent parts of @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",

    "\\label{e25}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in terms of the standard definitions for the renormalized quantities @xmath73 where the @xmath47 coupling constant @xmath74 is made dimensionless by introducing the t hooft scale @xmath59 , the renormalized vertex functions are @xmath75 where we have omitted the finite one - loop contributions . therefore , by adopting the @xmath76-scheme @xcite , we get @xmath77    finally , we define the _ dimensionless _ renormalized couplings @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath32 , which should not be confused with the bare parameters in ( [ e26 ] ) : @xmath80 the one - loop renormalization - group ( rg ) functions for the dimensionless renormalized couplings are then given by @xmath81",
    "from ( [ e31 ] ) , ( [ e32 ] ) , and ( [ e33 ] ) , we see that near @xmath9 the theory possesses only a gaussian fixed point ( gfp ) : @xmath82 .",
    "as is well known , the linearization of the rg equations around the gfp shows that near this point the couplings scale according to their scaling dimension .",
    "that is , by defining @xmath83 , we find that @xmath84 note that @xmath85 at the gfp .    finally , from @xmath86 we see that at @xmath9 the theory is asymptotically free .",
    "the explicit solution of the rg equation @xmath87 is @xmath88 where @xmath89 is an arbitrary scale and @xmath90 . in ( [ e35 ] )",
    "we immediately recognize the usual features of asymptotic freedom and infrared slavery .",
    "however , we emphasize that despite exhibiting these important physical properties , the conventional @xmath8 theory is unstable .",
    "by making the substitutions @xmath91 and @xmath92 in ( [ e31])([e33 ] ) , we find that @xmath93 unlike the conventional @xmath8 theory , we now have _ nontrivial fixed points _ at @xmath94 in addition to the usual gfp .    as in the conventional case ,",
    "the flow near the gfp is dictated by the canonical dimensions of the couplings .",
    "near the non - gaussian fixed points , however , the linearization of the rg equations gives the following _ new scaling behavior _ : @xmath95 where @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 are the eigenvalues of the @xmath99 jacobian matrix that defines the linearized rg flow around the non - gaussian fixed points , and @xmath100 , @xmath101 , and @xmath102 are arbitrary coefficients .",
    "this result comes from solving the linearized system of differential rg equations around the non - gaussian fixed points ( see fig .  [ f1 ] ) . from these equations we see that @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath32 are still eigendirections of the jacobian matrix , as was the case for the gfp . finally , the anomalous dimension of the field is @xmath103    it is worth noting that the hyperscaling relation that connects the anomalous dimension of the field with the eigenvalue @xmath104 , namely @xmath105 is satisfied , as expected . here , @xmath106 is the exponent that gives the anomalous scaling of the two - point function . near the critical region ,",
    "the latter behaves as @xmath107",
    "we have shown that the @xmath0-symmetric @xmath7 quantum field theory near @xmath9 dimensions possesses three fixed points , the gfp and two nontrivial ones in ( [ e40 ] ) . at @xmath9 ( @xmath16 )",
    "the three fixed points merge in a unique fixed point , which is the gaussian one . from the @xmath86 function ( [ e39 ] )",
    ", we can see that when @xmath16 , the theory is trivial : @xmath108 this allows us to conclude that the @xmath7 theory is energetically _",
    "stable _ , _ perturbatively renormalizable _ , and _",
    "trivial_. this triviality property is the same as for the conventional hermitian @xmath10 theory in @xmath11 dimensions . if we consider this @xmath7 theory in @xmath9 dimensions from an effective - field - theory standpoint ( as is the case for the higgs sector of the standard model ) , it can be treated as a perfectly sensible physical theory .    from the rg point of view",
    ", however , what seems to us to be more interesting is what happens when @xmath109 ( @xmath110 ) . in this case , if we consider the @xmath111 plane , we have a situation that closely parallels the ferromagnetic case as described in @xmath112 dimensions , where we have the _ gaussian _ and the _ wilson - fisher _ fixed points . in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] the ( @xmath113 ) plane for the ordinary @xmath10 theory in @xmath112 dimensions is shown and the rg flows on this plane are plotted .",
    "the gfp is at the origin , while the wilson - fisher fixed point is on the left of the @xmath114 axis .",
    "the dashed lines are the eigendirections and the wilson - fisher fixed point is at the crossing of the two eigendirections ( one of which is the relevant direction , the other the irrelevant one ) .",
    "the two fixed points , the gfp and the wffp determine the rg flows on this plane . in the case of a @xmath0-symmetric @xmath7 theory in @xmath115 dimensions",
    "the situation in the @xmath116 plane is essentially the same .",
    "however , the role of the @xmath117 term of the ferromagnetic model is played by @xmath79 , while the role of @xmath32 ( in the @xmath10 term ) is played by @xmath26 ( compare figs .",
    "[ f1 ] and [ f2 ] ) . in the @xmath116 plane",
    "the two eigendirections are the @xmath118 axis and the dashed line of fig .",
    "the non - gaussian fixed point is at the crossing of the two eigendirections .",
    "it is evident from figs .",
    "[ f1 ] and [ f2 ] that the rg flow in the ( @xmath79 , @xmath26 ) plane is the _ same _ as the rg flow in the ferromagnetic case ; that is , it is the same as the flow in the ( @xmath113 ) plane . in both cases these flows",
    "are governed by the two fixed points ( the gaussian one and the non - gaussian one ) . as is clear from figs .",
    "[ f1 ] and [ f2 ] , the gaussian fixed point of the ferromagnetic case corresponds to the gaussian fixed point of the @xmath7 theory ; the wilson - fisher fixed point of the ferromagnetic case corresponds to our non - gaussian fixed point : @xmath118 , @xmath119 .",
    "regarding the two fixed points in ( [ e40 ] ) , @xmath120 , it should be noted that in establishing this parallel , we refer to the square of the coupling constant @xmath26 rather than to the coupling constant @xmath32 itself .",
    "we do this because it is convenient to treat the two fixed points in a unified manner because the physics around either fixed point is the same .",
    "we note that the additional non - gaussian fixed points of the @xmath0-symmetric theory are also present in the conventional @xmath8 theory although they are purely imaginary [ see @xmath86 in ( [ e33 ] ) ] .",
    "therefore , by considering also the purely imaginary solutions to the equation @xmath121 in the conventional @xmath8 theory , in a sense we recover the results obtained by stating from the beginning that the @xmath8 coupling in the lagrangian is purely imaginary ( which is the case for the @xmath0-symmetric theory ) . in summary , while the equation @xmath122 in the conventional @xmath8 theory has one real and two imaginary conjugate solutions , in the @xmath0-symmetric theory all of the three solutions are real .    finally , we point out that in both the conventional and the @xmath0-symmetric theories the rg equations for @xmath32 and @xmath79 with @xmath123 and @xmath86 given by ( [ e32])([e33 ] ) and ( [ e38])([e39 ] ) , respectively , can be solved exactly . having defined @xmath124 as before , for the conventional theory we get @xmath125^{-5/9 } , \\label{e47}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and",
