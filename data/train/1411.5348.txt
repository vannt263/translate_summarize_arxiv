    "a current speeding up universe was discovered almost two decades ago , by using 42 type ia supernovae as standard indicators @xcite .",
    "further data have definitively forecasted this experimental evidence , confirming that the universe is accelerated at late times @xcite .",
    "particularly , after a particular transition epoch @xcite , the universe started unexpectedly to accelerate , showing that only standard matter can not be responsible for its present dynamics @xcite .",
    "the most accepted interpretation includes dark matter and dark energy , respectively responsible for structure formation and repulsive dynamics @xcite . in particular , the first component , i.e. dark matter , permits structures to cluster and form during early phases of universe s evolution , whereas dark energy seems to influence current dynamics , enabling the universe to positively accelerate at small redshift @xcite .",
    "the most accredited paradigm is named _ the @xmath4cdm model _ and assumes a non - evolving vacuum energy cosmological constant @xmath4 , which dominates over baryons and dark matter at our epoch @xcite .",
    "moreover , present data also prospect a spatially flat universe , characterized by baryons and cold dark matter which accounts for almost the @xmath6 of the whole energy content , while the @xmath4 density for about the @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "quite surprisingly , the corresponding dark energy equation of state for the pressure is negative , leading to a non - clear physical interpretation of the main components of the energy momentum tensor @xcite .",
    "thus , the observed speed up description is so far theoretically uncomplete and leads cosmologists to suppose that general relativity breaks down at precise energy scales @xcite .",
    "this fact would provide the expected repulsive effects , capable of accelerating the universe today @xcite .",
    "hence , a self consistent enlargement of general relativity reviews both dark matter and energy effects as fundamental properties of a single theory .",
    "those frameworks represent the well - known _",
    "modified theories of gravity _ , consisting of many models trying to include higher curvature terms , the torsion scalar , additional scalar fields , novel particles derived from supersymmetry and so forth ( see @xcite for details ) . among several possibilities ,",
    "a feasible extension of general relativity , which reproduces the dark energy effects , is the class of @xmath0 models .",
    "those paradigms manage to replace the ricci scalar @xmath8 in terms of a generic analytic function @xmath0 , modifying correspondingly the einstein - hilbert action @xmath9 as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a coupling constant related to the gravitational constant @xmath12 , @xmath13 the spacetime involved and @xmath14 the matter action .",
    "since @xmath0 is not known _ a priori _ , there exist many formulations of modified @xmath0 theories @xcite passing almost all the available experimental tests at the solar system regime .",
    "hence , there exists a strong degeneracy among cosmological models derived from @xmath0 approaches and the correct form of the @xmath0 function is still object of debate .",
    "however , any proposed @xmath0 represents a _ ad hoc _ formulation for describing the universe dynamics @xcite .",
    "frequently , in fact , the particular choice of @xmath0 is physically unmotivated and so the need of puzzling physical @xmath0 represents the main issue related to the @xmath0 picture .    the main purpose of our paper is to discriminate , among different sets of @xmath0 possibilities , the ones passing the local bounds offered by cosmography and to propose a model independent reconstruction of cosmographic @xmath0 functions . to perform our numerical analyses ,",
    "we need to numerically solve the modified friedmann equations .",
    "the modified friedmann equations explicitly depend upon the hubble rate @xmath15 and derivatives , the ricci scalar @xmath8 and the @xmath0 function and derivatives . hence , to express the friedmann equations in terms of a single variable , we rewrite them in function of the redshift @xmath16 . to fix the evolution of @xmath15 and then to calibrate the corresponding hubble rates , entering the friedmann equations , we assume that the curvature dark energy fluid is mimicked in terms of three consolidate dark energy candidates . in particular , we approximate the hubble evolution using the @xmath4cdm model , the chevallier - polarski - linder ( cpl ) parametrization and finally a phenomenological dark energy approximation ( starobinski @xcite ) .",
    "afterwards , we reconstruct the behavior of the @xmath0 function by numerically solving the above cited cosmological equations , fixing the free parameters to agree with the cosmographic bounds . in particular , we consider a numerical approach to determine the behaviors of @xmath0 , passing through the corresponding @xmath5 function , which is biunivocally determined by considering the dependence upon the redshift of the ricci scalar @xmath8 . hence , we rewrite the @xmath0 in terms of a redshift function only , i.e. @xmath5 , which consists in replacing the time dependence of @xmath8 by means of the more feasible variable @xmath16 . employing cosmological data around",
    "@xmath1 $ ] , in which the most of data is concentrated , we depict the shapes of @xmath5 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , i.e. the curvature equation of state of the fluid responsible for the universe speeding up in function of @xmath16 only .",
    "afterwards , inverting the numerical equations , i.e. passing from the redshift @xmath16 to @xmath8 , we will be able to build up the numerical behavior of @xmath0 in function of @xmath8 as well .",
    "further , we demonstrate that our method involves the smallest number of impositions possible , since to set _ model independent _ initial conditions on the involved friedmann equations , we make use of the above cited _ cosmography _ of the universe .",
    "indeed , cosmography represents a method to describe the universe dynamics , without using any assumptions _",
    "a priori_. the strategy of cosmography precisely assesses numerical settings in the redshift domain @xmath1 $ ] and it represents an accurate way to bound @xmath20 , the universe acceleration @xmath21 and its variation @xmath22 at present time . to permit cosmography to act on the initial settings of the friedmann equations , we propose the strategy of matching @xmath5 and derivatives with the cosmographic coefficients",
    "moreover , we assume that the ricci scalar and the corresponding derivatives may be related to the cosmographic coefficients as well .",
    "thus , we finally compare the cosmological results with the solar system constraints and we infer a class of @xmath0 functions which better behave as the universe expands . as a consequence ,",
    "we propose new viable @xmath0 functions , which are not postulated but inferred from numerically solve the friedmann equations .",
    "our treatment lies on a direct reconstruction built up in a model independent way , by using the universe cosmography .",
    "once our @xmath0 function is known , we turn back solving the friedmann equations , showing the behavior of our proposal in functions of the redshift parameter @xmath16 .",
    "thus , our methodology enables to highlight the correct form of the @xmath0 function , suggesting which one is really suitable for describing current dynamics .",
    "the paper is thus structured : in sec .",
    "ii , we focus on the main features of @xmath0 cosmology , highlighting the basic requirements that every @xmath0 paradigm should provide . in sec .",
    "iii , we describe the basic demands of cosmography as a tool to fix initial settings on the numerics we are going to show . in particular , we describe the role of every cosmographic coefficients and how cosmography can be framed in the context of @xmath0 gravity . in sec .",
    "iv , we match cosmography with @xmath0 theories and we show which coefficients are of particular interest in our procedures , emphasizing the peculiar property of cosmography to fix limits on @xmath5 model independently . besides we proceed to numerical reconstruct the @xmath5 function , calibrating the hubble rate in the interval @xmath1 $ ] using three different calibrating @xmath23 , i.e. the @xmath4cdm model , the cpl parametrization and a phenomenological reconstruction of dark energy .",
    "once the function is determined , we analyze the principal properties and we discuss their implications in modern cosmology . in sec .",
    "v , we describe the @xmath0 function and we calculate the corresponding properties in the time domain .",
    "we show that the function is compatible with some other paradigms already presented in the literature , although it actually differs from them for some other properties .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "vi is devoted to conclusion and final perspectives of our work @xcite .",
    "to determine the dynamical equations in @xmath0 cosmology , one varies eq .",
    "( [ actionmetric ] ) with respect to the metric @xmath24 .",
    "this leads to fourth order field equations of the form @xcite",

    "( [ set ] ) , the matter tensor is coupled to the curvature tensor as @xmath32 and the corresponding modified friedmann equations become @xcite @xmath33\\,,\\ ] ] and @xmath34 in these equations we neglected scalar curvature terms , i.e. @xmath35 , according to recent observations @xcite and we define the curvature density as @xmath36 the barotropic pressure as @xmath37 and we consider @xmath38 because we study universe expansion in the matter dominated phase . for our purposes",
    ", we assume the pressure to be barotropic since it does not explicitly depend upon the universe entropy @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the well - known effective curvature barotropic factor is therefore given by @xmath39 } { \\left [ f(r ) - r f'(r ) \\right ] /2 - 3 h \\dot{r } f''(r)}\\ , , \\label{eq : wcurv}\\ ] ] and represents the effective equation of state for the curvature term .",
    "finally , the corresponding ricci scalar @xmath8 can be framed in terms of the hubble parameter as @xcite @xmath40 where we assume @xmath41 , for @xmath42 to hold . in our calculations",
    ", @xmath43 represents the ricci scalar at our time @xmath44 , which corresponds to the redshift @xmath45 . later on ,",
    "we take into account the above cosmological equations and we describe their evolutions by numerically solving eq .",
    "( [ eq : fried1 ] ) .",
    "in particular , numerical outcomes derived from eq .",
    "( [ eq : fried1 ] ) enable us to frame the @xmath0 corrections and to obtain viable @xmath0 candidates , which would represent effective classes of cosmological @xmath0 models .",
    "the problem of fixing the initial conditions to use is here overcome by the use of cosmography . in the next paragraph , we report the basic demands offered by cosmography to set the initial conditions on @xmath0 functions , showing that it is possible to rewrite @xmath0 functions in terms of the redshift @xmath16 .",
    "we therefore highlight the basic requirements that each classes of @xmath0 functions must satisfy and we suggest which functions better work than others .",
    "in this section , we briefly describe the principal aspects of cosmography , characterizing its implications in the context of @xmath0 cosmology .",
    "to do so , we show how to determine numerical initial settings on the @xmath0 function , in order to reconstruct the @xmath0 shapes , in the interval @xmath3 .",
    "first developments towards a complete cosmographic theory has been discussed in @xcite , whereas the modern interpretation of cosmography has been firstly discussed by weinberg @xcite , who noticed that all cosmological observables may be expanded in taylor series .",
    "afterwards , it was soon clear that those series may be directly compared with data , without the need of postulating any cosmological model _ a priori _ @xcite .",
    "the first step is to expand the scale factor @xmath46 around present time @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "thus , the corresponding power series coefficients are referred to as the _ cosmographic series _ ( cs ) , if computed at @xmath47 .",
    "cosmography is essentially based on two simple assumptions , summarized as follows @xcite :    * cosmography requests the cosmological principle to hold .",
    "so , cosmography represents a model independent technique to fix cosmic bounds once spatial curvature is somehow fixed @xcite .",
    "present - time universe appears to be spatially flat , i.e. @xmath35 , and several confirmations , coming from this assumptions , are easily determined @xcite .",
    "hence , cosmography becomes at most a model independent approach to limit cosmological models at our epoch . since cosmography does not involve any cosmological model _ a priori _ , it is sometimes referred to as _",
    "cosmokinetics _ @xcite ;",
    "* current time description of our universe passes through a direct composition of the whole energy content , by means of a non - specified number of cosmological fluids , e.g. dark energy , neutrinos , radiations , baryons , etc .",
    "thus , the net pressure becomes a direct sum of different species , i.e. @xmath48 , which corresponds to separate the energy densities as : @xmath49 @xcite . in our work , we circumscribe our attention to barotropic fluids only , in which the pressure becomes an energy function only .    from the above assumptions",
    ", we immediately get how to model independently define the cs . indeed ,",
    "expanding @xmath46 , we easily get @xmath50 and so , for our purposes : @xmath51 where we truncated @xmath46 at the second order of taylor expansion . for guaranteeing causality among physical processes ,",
    "_ e.g. _ photon emissions from a source , we considered @xmath52 and we finally set @xmath53 , i.e. the scale factor today @xmath54 , without losing generality .",
    "the cosmographic coefficients are easily defined by :    [ pinza ] @xmath55    c    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]      +   +     , width=328,height=170 ]",
    "we get three expressions for @xmath5 and @xmath0 , for a total of six analyses .",
    "all the numerical results , performed by using the three hubble rates , i.e. @xmath4cdm , cpl , and the phenomenological one , generate close outcomes which converge to the approximate solution @xmath56 which represents an effective form of @xmath0 inferred from reconstructing @xmath0 from our numerical curves . for guaranteeing that eq .",
    "( [ fdir ] ) accurately reproduces the universe dynamics , we set the three free constant around the following values :    [ costanti ] @xmath57    while @xmath58 represents the cosmological constant and @xmath43 is the present value of the ricci scalar , which becomes @xmath59 using the cosmographic results .",
    "moreover , eq . ( [ fdir ] ) accurately reproduces the gravity lagrangian in the range @xmath60 $ ] .",
    "all curves of @xmath5 and @xmath0 , approximating to @xmath61 , provide the relevant fact that eq .",
    "( [ fdir ] ) reduces to the hilbert - einstein action @xmath62 , recovering general relativity with the addition of a cosmological constant .",
    "rephrasing it differently , the @xmath4cdm model persists to be favorite at small redshift domains , indicating however the cosmological constant as a limiting case of a more general paradigm .",
    "another significative result is offered by reconstructing the effective hubble rate from the first friedmann equation eq .",
    "( [ eq : fried1 ] ) , as due to the @xmath63 corrections of eq .",
    "( [ fdir ] ) .",
    "we find , in particular , that a viable approximation is the one plotted in fig .",
    "( [ dmpioneers ] ) .",
    "the approximation may be framed in terms of @xmath64 where    [ coeffffff ] @xmath65    that are in agreement with experimental cosmological prediction . here ,",
    "@xmath66 is fixed in terms of the planck results @xcite .",
    "the behaviors of @xmath67 and @xmath19 provide similar contributions in all the three models investigated and their numerical difference are proportional to the percent difference settled by the three different hubble rate .",
    "this suggests that our numerical outcomes do not strongly depend upon the initial conditions on @xmath15 and on its evolution .",
    "in this paper , we described a method to frame the correct @xmath0 , basing our attention on numerically solving the modified friedmann equations . among several possibilities to feature the @xmath0 by postulating its shape according to observations , we propose a new technique consisting in assuming initial settings on the modified friedmann equations offered by cosmography .",
    "the procedure shows the advantage to be model independently fixed in the redshift interval @xmath1 $ ] , leading to a @xmath0 reconstruction which well fits the experimental outcomes provided by present data .",
    "thus , we managed to alleviate the degeneracy among the different choices of @xmath0 functions , by initially reconstructing the dynamic equations in terms of the single variable @xmath16 . indeed , employing the correspondence @xmath68 and showing its invertibility in the redshift range @xmath69 $ ]",
    ", one can shift all variables in terms of the redshift @xmath16 , showing that all observable quantities of interest can be framed analogously .",
    "the differential equation we got has been derived by featuring the first friedmann equation in terms of @xmath16 .",
    "the initial conditions on its dynamics have been bounded by means of cosmography , i.e. a numerical technique which determines cosmic bounds at late times , by simply comparing taylor expansions directly to data .",
    "the powerful of cosmography , i.e. the fact of being completely model independent , set up the initial conditions on the @xmath0 functions and enables one to reproduce universe s expansion history as the knowledge of @xmath23 is somehow known .",
    "we proposed three hubble rates which actually provide the numerics in the interval @xmath3 , i.e. the @xmath4cdm , the cpl and the phenomenological approach .",
    "we aimed to choose those frameworks since are likely the simplest frameworks which better adapt their shapes to frame the universe evolution .",
    "correspondingly , we got a model independent reconstruction of @xmath5 , i.e. the function @xmath0 in terms of the redshift @xmath16 .",
    "we reported the shapes of @xmath5 for each model involved in our numerical analyses and we showed that our outcomes are basically similar but not equivalent , obtaining consequently different classes of plausible @xmath5 functions .",
    "in so doing , we passed through a numerical description of @xmath0 functions , by means of the auxiliary @xmath5 .",
    "in fact , we got a defined class of viable functions which integrate the numeric friedmann equations , providing integration constants accurately fine - tuned by means of cosmography itself .",
    "the final outcome lies on viable forms of @xmath0 functions , which extend the standard approach of general relativity .",
    "the terms here involved are compatible with recent developments on modified @xmath0 functions and permit to conclude that the universe is accurately featured by @xmath8 corrections to the standard hilbert - einstein action . besides , in order to extend @xmath0 effective expression till to the dynamics of the early universe , we are trying to apply our numerical procedure , here described , for redshift parameter major than unity , i.e. @xmath70",
