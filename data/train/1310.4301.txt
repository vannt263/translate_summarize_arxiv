    "one challenging problem that hinders the further development of wireless communications is the scarcity of available spectrum for the demands of various advanced wireless services .",
    "however , fcc s report shows that the licensed spectrum is heavily underutilized in temporal , frequency or spatial scales @xcite . a good solution to solve the above contradiction is the use of cognitive radio ( cr ) @xcite @xcite",
    ". generally speaking , a cognitive network is allowed to coexist with a primary network on the licensed spectrum by adaptively adjusting its transmit parameters , i.e. , power , time , and frequency , so that the resulting interference to the primary network meets a certain constraint .    intuitively , the design objective of a cr network is to maximize the spectrum efficiency while satisfying the given interference constraint . considering the dynamic activity of the primary network ,",
    "one feasible method is to access the idle spectrum in temporal or frequency scale through effective spectrum sensing @xcite-@xmath0@xcite .",
    "clearly , the performance of this method is dependent on the precision of spectrum sensing to a large extent .",
    "in fact , it is a passive way for spectrum efficiency improvement , because the spectrum is available only when primary user is inactive .",
    "a better method is to find the spectrum availability actively by making use of channel fading , no matter whether the spectrum is idle . as a simple example",
    ", the author in @xcite proposed to opportunistically control transmit power according to the instantaneous channel state information ( csi ) , so as to optimize the spectrum efficiency .",
    "the key of the realization of active spectrum share lies in exploiting the extra degrees of freedom other than time and frequency .",
    "inspired by interference avoidance through making use of spatial degree of freedom @xcite @xcite , the combination of cr and multiantenna technologies has been proved as an advanced way to achieve the goal of cr in previous literatures @xcite-@xmath0@xcite . in this paper , we focus on the design of a multi - antenna transmission scheme for the multiuser miso cognitive networks under limited csi feedback .",
    "the common to the previous works on multi - antenna cognitive networks lies in how to achieve a balance between increasing the transmission rate of cognitive network and decreasing the interference to primary network .",
    "a simplest method to tackle such a challenge is to transmit the signal of cognitive network in the null space of the interference channel from cognitive transmitter to primary receiver .",
    "it makes sense only when primary network can not bear any interference .",
    "if the interference is bearable within a given constraint , it has been proved that the optimal transmit direction , namely transmit beam , lies in the space spanned jointly by interference channel and the projection of cognitive channel from cognitive transmitter to cognitive receiver into interference channel @xcite .",
    "considering the availability of interference csi may be imperfect , an adaptive beamforming design method coupling with transmission mode selection was proposed , so that the qos requirement can be fulfilled with the minimum resource consumption @xcite .",
    "in addition , a robust beamforming method based on mean and covariance information of interference channel was given in @xcite .",
    "with the purpose of further improving spectrum efficiency , the research focus is shifting from single user to multiuser .",
    "the authors in @xcite first chose the users whose channels are quasi - orthogonal to interference channel so that the interference are controlled , then a given number of users whose channels are as orthogonal as possible are selected from the above user set , so as to decrease the inter - user interference in cognitive networks . similarly",
    ", an user scheduling scheme was presented to improve the performance of cognitive networks by exploiting the so - called multiuser interference diversity @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a joint power control and beamforming strategy was proposed to minimize the total transmit power while satisfying interference constraint to primary users and quality - of - service ( qos ) requirements of cognitive users simultaneously @xcite .",
    "all the above multiantenna schemes can improve spectrum efficiency while meeting interference constraint to some extent .",
    "however , they all fend off the question that how multiantenna cognitive transmitter knows the interference csi . naturally , the interference csi is critical to beamforming design and user scheduling at the transmitter . in traditional multiantenna systems ,",
    "the csi is usually obtained by limited feedback from the receiver to the transmitter through a quantization codebook @xcite @xcite . yet",
    ", in cognitive networks , the achievement of the interference csi needs the cooperation from primary receiver .",
    "inspired by this idea , cooperative feedback from primary receiver to cognitive transmitter was first proposed in @xcite , so the cognitive transmitter can design the optimal beamformer according to the instantaneous interference csi .",
    "meanwhile , the authors also gave a detailed discussion on feedback allocation between channel direction information and interference power control information , so as to optimize the performance while meeting the interference constraint .",
    "similarly , based on the cooperative feedback information , the authors in @xcite proposed to select the optimal cognitive user , such that the benefit of multiuser diversity can be obtained . intuitively , the more accurate the csi at the transmitter , the better the system performance .",
    "however , different from traditional multiantenna systems , primary receiver has no obligation to convey the csi to cognitive transmitter .",
    "this is an inevitable problem in cooperative feedback based cognitive networks .",
    "moreover , transmission mode , namely the number of accessing users , is also an important factor for performance improvement in multiuser multiantenna system @xcite @xcite . to be precise ,",
    "a large transmission mode can obtain high spatial multiplexing gain , while it may result in severe inter - user interference .",
    "hence , it is necessary to select the optimal transmission mode according to channel conditions , especially in the case of limited csi feedback , since the amount of csi has a great impact on mode selection . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors gave a comprehensive performance analysis for a multiuser miso downlink with limited feedback and feedback delay , then proposed mode switching between single - user ( su ) mode and multiuser ( mu ) mode by comparing the average sum rates for a given sinr .",
    "it is worth pointing out this work only considers two transmission mode , name @xmath1 and @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the number of transmit antenna at bs . in",
    "multiuser multiantenna cognitive network , mode selection is an effective way of coordinating intra - network ( inter - user ) and inter - network interference , and thus improve the performance significantly . yet , mode selection in cognitive network is a more challenging task , since it is affected by intra - network interference and inter - network interference simultaneously , especially when the csi is imperfect .      in this paper , we focus on a limited cooperative multiuser miso cognitive network . in order to let primary receiver help cognitive transmitter of its own accord",
    ", we propose that cognitive network purchases partial interference csi from primary network with an appreciate cost .",
    "therefore , primary network obtains some profits and cognitive network improves its performance , which is a win - win solution . intuitively , the more the feedback amount , the better the performance , but the higher the feedback cost .",
    "for the sake of balancing system performance and feedback cost , it is imperative to design a feedback efficient multiuser transmission scheme .",
    "thereby , we propose a concept of feedback utility function , defined as the difference of the average sum rate of cognitive network and feedback cost . in this paper , we take the maximization of feedback utility function as the optimization objective . as analyzed above , for a multiantenna broadcast channel with limited feedback , the number of accessing users , namely transmission mode , has a great impact on the average sum rate .",
    "hence , in order to maximize the feedback utility function , it is necessary to jointly optimize feedback amount and transmission mode .",
    "the main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows    1 .",
    "we propose a framework of limited cooperative zero - forcing beamforming ( zfbf ) for multiuser miso cognitive networks , so as to mitigate the inter - network and intra - network interferences effectively .",
    "we reveal the relationship among the interference , feedback amount , transmit power and number of accessing user , so that the parameters of cognitive network can be adaptively adjusted according to interference constraint .",
    "we define a feedback utility function as the difference of the average sum rate of cognitive network and feedback cost . by maximizing the feedback utility function",
    ", we get the optimal and suboptimal algorithms that derive the transmission mode and feedback amount .",
    "we investigate of the impact of feedback delay on feedback utility function , and obtain analytically the corresponding transmission mode and feedback amount joint optimization scheme .",
    "we present some relatively simple optimization schemes in three extreme cases through asymptotic performance analysis .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we give a brief overview of the system model and introduce the transmission protocol of cognitive network .",
    "section iii focuses on the derivation of the optimal feedback amount and transmission mode by maximizing the feedback utility function while satisfying the interference constraint .",
    "then , the asymptotic characteristics of the performance is analyzed in section iv .",

    "the acronym i.i.d means  independent and identically distributed \" , pdf means  probability density function \" and cdf means  cumulative density function \" .",
    "we consider a system composed of a primary network and a cognitive network , as seen in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "it is assumed that the two networks share the same spectrum for transmission .",
    "the cognitive network includes an @xmath3-antenna cognitive base station ( bs ) and @xmath13 single - antenna cognitive users . in order to guarantee the normal communication of primary network ,",
    "the interference from cognitive bs to the single - antenna primary receiver must satisfy a given constraint , which is the precondition that primary network allows cognitive network to access the licensed spectrum .",
    "meanwhile , primary transmitter will interfere with cognitive network . in this paper",
    ", we integrate the interference from primary transmitter into the noise at cognitive users , so we omit primary transmitter in this system . note that this paper focuses on mode selection but not user scheduling , we fix the user number @xmath14 because at most @xmath15 users are allowed to access cognitive network while one spatial degree of freedom of @xmath3-antennas cognitive bs is used for interference suppression . in practical network , if @xmath13 is large , we can combine space division multiplexing access ( sdma ) with time division multiplexing access ( tdma ) . specifically , cognitive users can access the network in different time slots based on some user scheduling schemes .",
    "it is assumed that the downlink is homogenous , where cognitive users have the same channel vector statistics , same path loss and same receive noise variance . the channels @xmath16 from cognitive bs to cognitive users are @xmath3 dimensional i.i.d gaussian random vectors with zero mean and unit variance , and the path loss is normalized to 1",
    ". the path loss component of interference channel from cognitive bs to primary receiver is @xmath17 with respect to that of downlink channel , and small scale fading component @xmath18 is also an @xmath3 dimensional circular symmetrical complex gaussian random vector .",
    "considering path loss varies slowly and is a scalar , we assume cognitive bs knows @xmath17 fully through the aid of a positioning system and the amount of exchange information can be neglected .",
    "cognitive network communicates in the form of time slot , and all the channels are assumed to keep constant during one time slot and fade independently slot by slot . at the beginning of each time slot ,",
    "primary receiver and cognitive users convey the corresponding csi to cognitive bs based on quantization codebooks .",
    "all the codebooks are designed in advance and stored at the transmitter and the receivers .",
    "assuming the codebook of size @xmath19 at primary receiver is @xmath20 , which is a collection of unit norm vectors , then the optimal quantization codeword selection criterion can be expressed as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the channel direction vector .",
    "specifically , index @xmath23 is conveyed by primary receiver and @xmath24 is recovered at cognitive bs as instantaneous csi of the interference channel .",
    "the quantization codebook of size @xmath25 at cognitive user @xmath26 is @xmath27 , and the same process of codeword selection , index conveyance and csi recovery is used to help cognitive bs to obtain csi of downlink channels .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the feedback amount @xmath28 is fixed and @xmath29 is dynamically variable as discussed below .",
    "based on the feedback information from primary receiver and cognitive users , cognitive bs determines the optimal transmit beam of the @xmath30th user of the selected @xmath31 users @xmath32 by making use of zero - forcing beamforming design methods , when given transmission mode @xmath31 .",

    ", we have @xmath38 and @xmath39 where @xmath40 .",
    "thus , the receive signal at the @xmath41th user can be expressed as @xmath42 where @xmath43 the normalized transmit signal related to the @xmath44th user , @xmath45 is the receive signal at the @xmath41th user , @xmath46 is the total transmit power of cognitive bs , which is distributed to @xmath31 users equally , and @xmath47 is additive white gaussian noise with zero mean and variance @xmath48 .",
    "then , the interference from cognitive bs to primary receiver , and the receive signal to interference and noise ratio ( sinr ) at cognitive user @xmath41 are given by @xmath49 and @xmath50 respectively .",
    "the precondition that cognitive network is allowed to access the licensed spectrum is that the interference from cognitive bs to primary receiver meets a given constraint .",
    "average interference constraint ( aic ) and peak interference constraint ( pic ) are two commonly used interference conditions in cognitive networks .",
    "previous works have proved that from the view of throughput maximization , given the same average and peak interference constraints , the aic is more favorable than the pic because of its more flexibility for dynamically allocating transmit powers over different fading states @xcite @xcite , thus we take the aic as the constraint condition in this paper . if @xmath51 is the allowable maximum average interference , the interference constraint is given by @xmath52\\leq\\bar{i}_{\\textrm{aic}}.\\label{eqn29}\\ ] ]    intuitively , when @xmath51 is given , the available maximum transmit power @xmath46 increases with the increase of feedback amount @xmath29 , and thus the performance of cognitive network improves accordingly , but the feedback cost also increases . in order to achieve a tradeoff between the performance and feedback cost , we take the maximization of feedback utility function as the optimization objective , which is defined as @xmath53\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath54-\\mu b,\\nonumber\\\\\\label{eqn9}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where ( [ eqn9 ] ) holds true since the @xmath55s of the users are i.i.d .",
    "@xmath56 is the pricing factor of feedback information from the primary receiver whose unit is rate penalty per feedback bit .",
    "@xmath56 is depending on cooperative cost , mainly including power and spectrum consumption for channel estimation , codeword selection and index feedback , and is determined based on a negotiation or competition scheme between cognitive and primary networks , such as stackelberg game @xcite . generally speaking ,",
    "if primary network asks for a higher unit price , cognitive network will purchase less feedback information , resulting in low profits .",
    "the optimal @xmath56 will be determined when one side can not further improve its utility , if the other side s utility is not deceased .",
    "once the price is determined , the owner of cognitive network will pay the owner of primary network .",
    "thus , these two networks can get some profits from cooperative feedback . in this paper , we concentrate on the optimization of feedback utility , so we assume the pricing factor has been determined by the two sides based on a certain method , such as stackelberg game .",
    "as seen in ( [ eqn9 ] ) , feedback utility function is a function of @xmath29 and @xmath31 . in order to maximize feedback utility function ,",
    "it is necessary to jointly optimize the two variables .",
    "hence , the focus of this paper is on the joint optimization of feedback amount @xmath29 and transmission mode @xmath31 by maximizing feedback utility function ( [ eqn9 ] ) while satisfying aic .",
    "as mentioned earlier , this paper focuses on the maximization of the feedback utility function while satisfying aic through adaptive mode selection and dynamic feedback control . as seen in ( [ eqn4 ] ) , given a channel condition @xmath17 , the interference @xmath57 is a function of transmit power @xmath46 , transmission mode @xmath31 and feedback amount @xmath29 .",
    "hence , when @xmath57 is given , there is a tradeoff among @xmath46 , @xmath31 and @xmath29 . on the other hand ,",
    "it is known from ( [ eqn5 ] ) that , @xmath46 and @xmath31 also have a great impact on the receive sinr , and thus the feedback utility function .",
    "therefore , prior to discussing the optimal transmission mode @xmath31 , we need to reveal the relationship among the interference , feedback utility function , transmit power , feedback amount and transmission mode .    by using zfbf based on limited feedback information from primary receiver ,",
    "the relation between the residual aic , transmit power , transmission mode and feedback amount is given by    _ theorem 1 _ : given @xmath46 and @xmath29 , the residual aic at primary receiver after zfbf is tightly upper bounded by @xmath58 .",
    "following the theory of random vector quantization ( rvq ) @xcite , the relationship between the original and the quantized channel direction vectors can be expressed as @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the optimal quantization codeword based on codeword selection criterion ( [ eqn1 ] ) , @xmath61 is the magnitude of the quantization error , and @xmath62 is an unit norm vector isotropically distributed in the nullspace of @xmath60 , and is independent of @xmath10 .",
    "therefore , the @xmath30th term of the sum in the right hand side ( rhs ) of ( [ eqn4 ] ) is derived as @xmath63 where ( [ eqn7 ] ) follows from the fact that @xmath37 is in the nullspace of @xmath60 , namely @xmath64 . due to the independence of channel magnitude component and channel direction component ,",

    "notice that the average interference without csi mismatch is @xmath58 , if @xmath169 , the csi mismatch leads to the increase of average interference .",
    "in other words , with the same average interference constraint and feedback amount , the available maximum transmit power decreases accordingly due to csi mismatch . otherwise ,",
    "if @xmath170 , the csi mismatch will decrease the average interference , so that cognitive bs can use higher transmit power to improve the performance .",
    "hence , the upper bound of transmit power in presence of delay while satisfying aic can be expressed as @xmath171 substituting ( [ eqn26 ] ) into ( [ eqn9 ] ) , we can derive the feedback utility function in presence of feedback delay , and thus the corresponding optimal @xmath29 and @xmath31 can be obtained by using the above proposed algorithm .",
    "in this section , for the sake of deriving the optimal @xmath125 and evaluating the performance easily , we analyze the asymptotic characteristics of feedback utility function in some extreme cases .",
    "if primary receiver can bear sufficiently high aic and/or @xmath17 is sufficiently small due to large distance between cognitive bs and primary receiver , such that aic can still be met even with @xmath127 and arbitrarily high transmit power .",
    "under such a condition , it is clear that @xmath127 is optimal in the sense of maximizing feedback utility function . in other words , without the help from primary receiver , cognitive network can work freely .",
    "it is equivalent to the traditional mode selection on broadcast channel . assuming a certain transmit power @xmath172 is used at cognitive bs , the optimal transmission mode is determined based on the average sum rate of cognitive users @xmath173 due to the complex expression , numerical search method is also used to derive the optimal @xmath31 .",
    "however , because of only one searching variable , the computation complexity can be reduced significantly .      in the case",
    "that primary receiver has a quite strict constraint on aic and/or @xmath17 is sufficiently large , the second term of the denominator in ( [ eqn12 ] ) can be neglected compared to the first one .",
    "hence , @xmath107 is reduced to @xmath174 and the corresponding pdf is @xmath175 therefore , the feedback utility function under this condition can be computed as @xmath176 it is known from ( [ eqn20 ] ) that , @xmath87 is a monotone increasing function of @xmath31 , so that @xmath177 is optimal . on the other hand , @xmath87 is a monotone decreasing function of @xmath29 , then @xmath127 is optimal .",
    "in fact , this case is equivalent to a noise - limited system , the help from primary receiver makes no sense and full multiplexing @xmath178 is propitious to improve the sum rate , so that it is reasonable to choose @xmath127 and @xmath177 .      when @xmath28 is quite large , but still fixed , @xmath179 . in other words , the inter - user interference can be neglected . under this condition",
    ", @xmath107 has the same expression as ( [ eqn18 ] ) , so that @xmath177 and @xmath127 are optimal .",
    "to examine the effectiveness of the proposed feedback efficient adaptive mode selection scheme in limited cooperative multiuser cognitive networks , we present several numerical results in different scenarios . for all scenarios , we set @xmath180 considering the maximum number of bs antennas in lte - a is 8 , @xmath181 due to the complexity constraint on codeword selection at primary receiver , and @xmath182",
    ". additionally , we use fuf@xmath183 to denote the maximum feedback utility function when selecting the optimal transmission mode @xmath184 and feedback bits @xmath185 , and use oa and sa to denote the optimal and suboptimal algorithms , respectively .",
    "interestingly , it is found that the suboptimal algorithm has the same optimization results as the optimal one in all scenarios , so that we could replace the optimal algorithm with the suboptimal one in practical networks .",
    "first , we testify the validity of the theoretical claims through numerical simulation with different path losses . in this case , we fix @xmath186 and @xmath187 for convenience . as seen in fig.[fig2 ] , in the whole region of interference constraint , the theoretical and simulation results are quite identical .",
    "especially when @xmath188db , the two ones are nearly coincident for different path losses .",
    "meanwhile , it is found that path loss @xmath17 has a great impact on mode selection and feedback bits , and thus maximum feedback utility function . as a simple example , at @xmath189db , fuf@xmath183 for @xmath190 has a performance gain of about @xmath191db over that for @xmath192 .",
    "this is because smaller @xmath17 leads to higher transmit power at cognitive bs for a given interference constraint .",
    "in addition , as shown in tab.[tab1 ] , in the case of high aic and small @xmath17 , @xmath127 is optimal , while @xmath127 and @xmath193 can maximize feedback utility function for the case of low aic and large @xmath17 , which are consistent with the asymptotic analysis results .",
