    "the breathtaking advances in quantum computation and quantum information processing in the last decade @xcite have stimulated progress in quantum optical state generation and engineering @xcite . among various schemes ,",
    "the proposal of pegg , phillips and barnett @xcite of the optical state truncation via projection synthesis has attracted considerable interest @xcite@xcite due to the simplicity of the scheme to generate and teleport ` flying ' qubits defined as a running wave superpositions of zero- and single - photon states .",
    "the scheme is referred to as _ linear quantum scissors _ ( lqs ) since the coherent state entering the system is truncated in its fock expansion to the first two terms using only linear optical elements and performing conditional photon counting .",
    "the optical state truncation can also be realized in systems comprising nonlinear elements including a kerr medium @xcite .",
    "such systems will be referred to as _ nonlinear quantum scissors _ ( nqs ) .",
    "both lqs @xcite and nqs @xcite can be generalized for the generation of a superposition of @xmath0 states .",
    "it is worth noting that there are fundamental differences between the states truncated by the lqs and nqs @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we analyze the effects of dissipation on state truncation by quantum scissors .",
    "various kinds of losses in quantum scissors have already been analyzed including : inefficiency and dark counts of photodetectors @xcite , non - ideal single - photon sources @xcite , mode mismatch @xcite , and losses in beam splitters @xcite .",
    "_ @xcite demonstrated that the lqs exhibit surprisingly high fidelity in realistic setups even with conventional photon counters so long as the amplitude of the input coherent state is sufficiently small .",
    "lqs has recently been realized experimentally by babichev _",
    "_ @xcite and resch _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , although only in the low - intensity regime .",
    "the effect of losses on the optical truncation in nqs has been studied for zero - temperature reservoir @xcite and imperfect photodetection @xcite .",
    "these studies of losses in lqs ( with few exceptions , e.g. , for @xcite ) have been based on the quantum detection and estimation theory using the positive operator valued measures ( povm ) @xcite . in quantum - optics textbooks ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , the quantum - statistical properties of dissipative systems are usually treated in three ways , by applying ( i ) the langevin ( langevin - heisenberg ) equations of motion with stochastic forces , ( ii ) the master equation for the density matrix , and ( iii ) the classical fokker - planck equation for quasiprobability distribution . in the next section",
    "we will apply the langevin approach to describe dissipative lqs , while in section 3 we shall use the master equation approach to study dissipative nqs .",
    "the linear quantum scissors device of pegg , phillips and barnett @xcite is a simple physical system for optical state truncation based only on _ linear _ optical elements ( two beam splitters bs1 and bs2 ) and two photodetectors ( d2 and d3 ) as depicted in figure 1 .",
    "if the input modes @xmath1 and @xmath2 are in the single - photon and vacuum states , respectively , and one photon is detected at d2 but no photons at d3 , then the lossless lqs device with 50/50 beam splitters truncates the input coherent state @xmath3 in mode @xmath4 to the following superposition of vacuum and single - photon states in mode @xmath5 @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the complex amplitude and @xmath8 is a renormalization constant .",
    "the state ( [ m1 ] ) is referred to as the truncated two - dimensional ( or two - level ) coherent state since it is the normalized superposition of the first two terms of fock expansion of the glauber coherent state . by introducing a new variable @xmath9 such that @xmath10 and @xmath11 , and @xmath12 , state ( [ m1 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath13 where , for brevity , subscript @xmath14 is skipped . if the @xmath15th ( @xmath16 ) beam splitter has an arbitrary but real transmission coefficient @xmath17 and an imaginary reflection coefficient @xmath18 , then the lqs generates the state @xcite @xmath19 ) by assuming identical bss ( @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) .    in general , the transmission and reflection coefficients of a perfect bss",
    "obey the conditions @xmath22 and @xmath23 , implied by the unitarity of bs transformation . by including dissipation ,",
    "these conditions can be violated .",
    "thus , the main goal of this section is to analyze the deterioration of the truncation process due to the noise introduced by lossy beam splitters and also by inefficient photodetectors . in the simplest approach ,",
    "one can model the bs losses and finite detector efficiency by adding to our system additional beam splitters , then all components of the system ( including the new bss ) can be assumed perfect . here",
    ", we apply another standard approach of the quantum theory of damping based on the langevin noise operators @xcite .",
    "we follow the analyses of barnett _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and villas - bas _ et al .",
    "the lossy bs1 transforms the input annihilation operators @xmath24 into the output @xmath25 as follows @xcite @xmath26 where we use the notation of figure 1 , and @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the langevin noise ( force ) operators satisfying the following commutation relations @xmath29 & = & [ \\hat{l}_{a2},\\hat{l}_{a2}^{\\dag } ] = 1-|t_{1}|^{2}-|r_{1}|^{2}\\equiv \\gamma _ { 1 } , \\nonumber \\\\",

    "the fidelity of the output state ( [ m7 ] ) of the lossy lqs to a desired perfectly truncated state , given by ( [ m1 ] ) , can be calculated from @xmath47 which leads us to the following relation latexmath:[\\ ] ] where @xmath92 is the scaled time given by @xmath93 , so @xmath94 .",

    "solution ( [ n04 ] ) describes the evolution of the nqs between the kicks only . on the other hand ,",
    "the evolution at each kick is given by @xmath99 where @xmath100|m\\rangle    \\label{n12}\\ ] ] in analogy to the milburn - holmes transformation for the pulsed parametric amplifier with a kerr nonlinearity @xcite . by observing",

    "thus , we have a complete solution to describe the effects of dissipation on , in particular , the truncation fidelity after the @xmath108th kick , which is given by @xmath109 where the perfectly truncated state @xmath110 was applied according to ( [ n01c ] ) .",
    "we studied dissipative quantum scissors systems for truncation of a glauber ( infinite - dimensional ) coherent state to a superposition of vacuum and single - photon fock states ( two - dimensional coherent state ) .",
    "we have contrasted the pegg - phillips - barnett quantum scissors based on linear optical elements and the leoski - tana quantum scissors comprising nonlinear kerr medium .",
    "we analyzed the effects of dissipation on truncation fidelity in the linear scissors within the langevin noise operator approach and in the nonlinear system in the master equation approach .",
