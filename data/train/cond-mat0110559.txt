    "the discovery of a superconducting state under pressure in a hole - doped spin - ladder cuprate @xmath9 with @xmath10 ( sintered powder ) @xcite and @xmath11 ( single crystal ) @xcite , has renewed the interest for superconductivity in low dimensional systems and its interplay with magnetism . these systems can be viewed as a link between high @xmath12 cuprates and quasi one dimensional organics which are two classes of exotic superconductors where the mechanism of superconductivity is still highly debated @xcite .",
    "undoped spin - ladders of general formula @xmath13 , where the copper valence is exactly @xmath14 ( @xmath15 with spin @xmath16 ) , consist of cuprate ladder planes separated by @xmath17 layers @xcite .",
    "their magnetic properties depend on the number of legs in the ladders @xcite . in case of an even number of legs the formation of spin singlets on each rung leads to the opening of a spin gap in the spin excitations . in the two - leg ladder compound",
    "@xmath18 the spin gap can be seen by the exponential drop of the spin susceptibility @xcite .",
    "this singlet ground state is not possible for an odd number of legs and a finite value of the spin susceptibility is reached at low temperature for instance in the three - leg compound @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath20 series has a more complicated structure built from the piling up of @xmath21 chains , @xmath17 ( or @xmath3 ) and @xmath22 two - leg ladders layers with an orthorhombic symmetry @xcite .",
    "the interlayer distance ( along the @xmath23 axis ) , which is @xmath24 in @xmath25 compound , is shortened upon @xmath3 substitution .",
    "moreover , there is a misfit between the lattice parameters of chains and ladders sublattices ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "this system is inherently hole doped as the stoechiometry implies an average copper valence of @xmath27 .",
    "however , optical measurements @xcite have shown that holes for the @xmath25 compound are residing mainly in the chains leading in turn to an insulating behavior and to a magnetic ordering revealed by neutron scattering experiments @xcite with a valency of @xmath28 for the @xmath29 ladder sites . then , although @xmath3 and @xmath17 are isovalent atoms , holes are transfered from the chains to the ladders upon @xmath3 substitution .",
    "consequently , the copper valency in the ladders increases from @xmath30 up to @xmath31 ( @xmath32 hole per @xmath29 ) as @xmath33 increases from @xmath34 to @xmath35 @xcite . at the same time , the longitudinal conductivity ( along the @xmath36 axis ) increases , leading to quasi one dimensional ( @xmath37 ) metallic properties @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that holes doped into the ladders will share common rungs since it is the configuration which minimizes the number of damaged spin singlets , @xcite . as far as the transverse a - axis is concerned , a confinement of holes pairs on the ladders below a confinement temperature called @xmath38 which is above room temperature for all samples with @xmath33 @xmath39 and drops to below @xmath40k for @xmath41 .",
    "however , as for undoped ladder compounds , a spin gap is still observed in the ladder plane and a smaller spin gap @xmath42 is also present in the chain sublattice .",
    "the existence of a spin gap on ladders was demonstrated by @xmath43-nmr measurements which can easily separate the contributions coming from copper nuclei belonging to chains and ladders .",
    "the spin part of the nmr shift , which is directly proportional to the spin susceptibility , allows an accurate determination of these gaps . upon @xmath3 substitution ,",
    "the amplitude of the spin gap in the ladders decreases from @xmath44 @xcite or @xmath45 @xcite for @xmath25 down to @xmath46 for @xmath33=12 @xcite while it remains practically unchanged in the chains ( @xmath47 ) @xcite .",
    "therefore , the spin gapped structure survives the existence of a finite concentration of holes in the ladders in agreement with theoretical suggestions @xcite . for samples with the largest @xmath3 concentration ,",
    "an applied pressure in the range @xmath48 stabilizes a superconducting ground state in the ladder planes with a transition temperature passing through a maximum at @xmath49 around @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "the great interest of superconducting spin ladders lies in the theoretical prediction of superconductivity in the @xmath51-wave channel which is a direct consequence of the spin gapped character of the magnetic excitations @xcite .",
    "the possible link between the predicted superconducting phase of isolated ladders and the ( @xmath52 ) phase stabilized under high pressure in @xmath53 is therefore a challenge in the physics of strongly correlated low dimensional fermions .    an early pressure study carried out on @xmath54@xcite concluded to the existence of low lying spin excitations under high pressure conditions _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath55 when superconductivity appears at @xmath56k .",
    "however , recent nmr studies at @xmath57 and inelastic neutron scattering experiments at @xmath58 argued that the spin gap does not change under pressure @xcite .",
    "consequently , it is a very important matter to study how the transient domain between the spin gap regime and the situation with low lying spin excitations develops under pressure .",
    "the compound @xmath59 also investigated in this work is the closest to the situation of the undoped spin ladders although displaying the chains and ladders structure similar to the @xmath60 series with an average @xmath29 valence of @xmath61 as compared to @xmath27 in the latter series @xcite .",
    "our work presents the results of a study of the whole @xmath62 series ( called @xmath63 from now ) on including the parent compound @xmath64 @xcite ( @xmath65 ) via nmr shifts and relaxation measurements under pressure up to @xmath66 which is a pressure well above the critical pressure ( @xmath67 ) needed for the stabilization of superconductivity in @xmath5 .",
    "some preliminary measurements performed on @xmath68 only up to @xmath69 have appeared in reference @xcite .",
    "section ii provides some experimental details .",
    "nmr shifts and relaxation results are presented in sec.iii .",
    "these results are discussed in sec.iv , in terms of magnon excitations in undoped and doped spin ladders .",
    "we shall see how this picture breaks down when the superconducting phase is approached .",
    "the interpretation of the gaussian relaxation time in sec .",
    "v provides an access to the spin correlation lenght .",
    "finally , the relation between spin gap and pressure - induced superconductivity is discussed in the sec .",
    "experiments have been carried out on single crystalline samples of @xmath62 @xmath70 and @xmath64 grown by the traveling solvent floating zone method @xcite . @xmath71",
    "nmr measurements have been performed at a fixed magnetic field of @xmath72 tesla ( @xmath73 ) _ via _ a fourier transform of the spin echo on the central transition @xmath74 using phase alternation techniques .",
    "the echo signal was obtained after the pulse sequence @xmath75 with @xmath76 @xmath77 .",
    "the @xmath78-factor of the resonance circuit did not exceed @xmath79 .",
    "this provides a rather uniform irradiation of the central line for the measurements down to @xmath80 k. the broad @xmath43 spectrum at low temperature was obtained by summing up the fourier transforms of spin echo signals taken at different frequencies with a frequency increment such as @xmath81 khz which is kept smaller than the full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) of a single fourier spectrum .",
    "the possible influence of the phase adjustment on the line shape for each fourier transformed subspectra was minimized in the following way .",
    "the resonance circuit was tuned at every step @xmath82 .",
    "a subspectrum was obtained at a fixed phase and then was passed through a rectangular band - pass digital filter @xmath83 .",
    "the comparison between different spectra @xmath84 shows that the peak position can be measured with an accuracy of @xmath85 khz .",
    "nmr data have been obtained in a seemingly non magnetic high hydrostatic pressure cell . however , in order to take into account the unavoidable slight shift of the external field generated by the tungsten carbide piston close to the sample , the nmr signal from the copper rf coil has been used as a field marker ( known to be only weakly pressure dependent)@xcite .",
    "the influence of the piston was manifested in an additional @xmath86-independent positive shift of the resonance frequency for @xmath43 in the @xmath87 coil , @xmath88 , remaining within @xmath89 depending on pressure as well as in a slight broadening of the @xmath90 nmr line from @xmath91 ( fwhf ) ( without piston ) to @xmath92 in the presence of the piston .",
    "the fwhm of @xmath90 spectra never exceeded @xmath93 at any pressure and temperature.consequently , we can be confident that all shifts or line broadenings reported in this study exceeding @xmath94 are related to intrinsic properties of the samples .",
    "shift values reported in this work have been calculated relative to the @xmath43 resonance in a diamagnetic substance , namely @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the resonance frequency of copper metal nuclei.the magnetic shift of the @xmath97nmr line was determined using a simulation software taking into account quadrupolar corrections to the zeeman frequency in a second order perturbation theory .    for a magnetic field",
    "@xmath98 parallel to the @xmath99-axis of the sample the resonance frequency of the central transition reads@xcite ,    @xmath100    where @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 are the nmr shift , the larmor frequency in a diamagnetic substance and the quadrupolar tensor components respectively .    for a magnetic field",
    "@xmath98 parallel to the @xmath23-axis of the sample ( _ i.e. _ the transverse axis corresponding to the alternate packing axis of chains and ladders ) the resonance frequency of the central transition reads ,    @xmath104    following the determination of the quadrupole tensor in @xmath105 @xcite , the second term in eq .",
    "( 2 ) amounts to @xmath106 ( @xmath107ppm ) with a negligible temperature dependence as compared to the temperature dependence of the first contribution since @xmath108 remains practically temperature independent @xcite .",
    "the pressure dependence of the quadrupolar contribution is not easy to estimate .",
    "however , considering the @xmath109 ppm change of the quadrupolar contribution at @xmath110 which is observed upon @xmath3 substitution between @xmath111 and @xmath11 in @xmath9@xcite and the expected equivalence between the chemical pressure of @xmath3 and the applied pressure which is a result of the present study we can conclude that a change of the quadrupolar term exceeding @xmath109 ppm in @xmath69 is very unlikely .",
    "the @xmath43 knight shift is very anisotropic in spin ladders .",
    "hence , a precise orientation of the single crystal in the magnetic field along the corresponding axis is requested for the determination of the actual @xmath112 temperature dependence .",
    "the situation @xmath113 which maximizes the value of the total shift has been reached through a fine adjustment of the angular position of the pressure cell in the magnetic field .    under some circumstances , line shifts and broadenings at low temperature both exceed largely @xmath94 .",
    "since the @xmath90 nmr line does not broaden significantly below @xmath79 k under any pressure , the drastic broadening of lines taking place at low @xmath86 can not be explained by the external field generated by the piston .",
    "this broadening is thus an intrinsic property of ladders .",
    "very similar features have been reported in the nmr study of @xmath114-doped @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "measurements of the spin - lattice relaxation time @xmath115 have been performed in the same field of @xmath113 by the saturation recovery method .",
    "the recovery of the longitudinal magnetization @xmath116 towards the equilibrium magnetization @xmath117 was fitted by the expression@xcite ,    @xmath118    parameters @xmath119 and @xmath120 are equal to 0.1 and 6 respectively for the central transition of a spin @xmath121 with non - zero electric field gradients ( @xmath122 ) when the relaxation is purely magnetic @xcite .",
    "the transverse relaxation was measured by the spin - echo decay method and the spin echo amplitude as a function of the time @xmath123 between the first @xmath124 and the second @xmath125 pulse was fitted above @xmath126 by the following expression , @xmath127\\ ] ] where @xmath128 is the gaussian time associated with the nuclear spin - spin coupling through the conducting electrons and @xmath129 is the lorentzian spin - echo time which reads , @xmath130 .",
    "figures.1 - 3 show the @xmath86 dependences of the @xmath43 nmr shift @xmath131 in samples @xmath9 and @xmath59 under ambient and also at high pressures after subtraction of the small quadrupolar contribution in eq .",
    "the nmr shift consists of two contributions ; the orbital @xmath132 and spin @xmath133 ( knight shift ) contributions , @xmath134 which can both be pressure and temperature dependent although no temperature dependence is expected for the orbital contribution .",
    "the second term @xmath135 is proportional to the uniform spin susceptibility @xmath136 , @xmath137 the hyperfine form factor for the @xmath138 ladders , @xmath139 , can be written as ,    @xmath140    @xmath141    where @xmath142 and @xmath143 are the on - site and supertransferred hyperfine fields , respectively . for a separate estimate of @xmath144 and @xmath145",
    "we assume @xmath146 at @xmath147 due to the presence of a spin gap in the spectrum of spin excitations .",
    "then , @xmath148 .    a previous nmr study of @xmath54 under pressure",
    "@xcite has argued that the pressure induced increase of the knight shift at low temperature with the concomitant suppression of the spin gap announced in our preliminary works @xcite could actually be ascribed to the orbital part of the shift decreasing under pressure .",
    "it was proposed that the reduction of the orbital shift could be due to a reduction of the number of holes in the @xmath149 orbital being transferred from @xmath29 to @xmath150 sites under pressure .",
    "all our data of nmr shifts show a similar line position ( between @xmath151 and @xmath152 ) at low temperature under ambient pressure irrespective of the amount of @xmath3 substitution for the entire @xmath9 series , ( see figures.1a,2a ) , @xcite . unlike the data presented in reference@xcite the pressure dependence of the nmr shift is much larger at low temperature than at room temperature @xmath153 at @xmath154 , see figure.3a and",
    "therefore can not be ascribed to a temperature independent pressure dependence of the orbital shift .",
    "in addition , according to the data presented in reference @xcite we should have obtained a reduction of @xmath155 for @xmath144 at @xmath156 . our results of figure.3a",
    "would thus impose the spin part @xmath157 to be reduced by a factor about two at room temperature and @xmath158 , an assumption which we find unlikely .",
    "we can thus claim that all pressure dependences of nmr shifts for the @xmath159 series are attributable to the spin part .",
    "interestingly , we have found that @xmath144 in @xmath59,fig.1a , @xmath160 is appreciably larger than @xmath144 in the @xmath159 series which may be associated with a difference in symmetry and magnitude of crystalline fields in this compound .",
    "the interesting feature in fig.1a is the finding of rather similar values at high temperature and also at low temperature independent of @xmath33 and of the applied pressure whereas big changes are observed in the intermediate temperature regime . for more heavily @xmath3-substituted samples @xmath3 ( 8,9 and 12 ) ,",
    "figures.2a,3a the story is quite different since the low temperature part becomes strongly affected by a change of @xmath33 and also by the pressure .",
    "we notice an only small pressure dependence of @xmath161 at @xmath162 which is _ at variance _ with the strong dependence observed at lower temperature .",
    "consequently , we can again assume the pressure dependence of @xmath144 to be negligible and the spin contribution to the nmr shift can be derived by the following equation ,    @xmath163    the data of @xmath157 are shown in figures 1b,2b and 3b .",
    "for lightly doped samples , the pressure ( up to @xmath164r ) does not affect the knight shift at low temperature ( which remains zero ) .",
    "this is _ at variance _ with what is occurring when the @xmath3 content overcomes @xmath33=8 .",
    "then , the spin part of the shift becomes pressure dependent at low temperature and a significant upturn of the nmr shift is observed at very low temperature although essentialy under high pressure .",
    "no such effects are observed in lightly @xmath3-doped samples .",
    "the pressure dependence of the zero temperature shift in @xmath68 fig.3b is indicative for the appearance of low - lying spin excitations above @xmath6 .",
    "this situation is reminiscent of the growth of zero frequency spectral weight which is observed in the undoped two - leg ladders upon substitution of @xmath15 by non - magnetic impurities@xcite .",
    "a marked curie - tail associated with the center of the spectrum is observed at low temperature under pressure in all samples with @xmath165 . since this curie contribution",
    "is not detected at ambient pressure in the same samples we feel confident that it can not be attributed to impurities or instrumental shifts of the magnetic field .",
    "there is also an intermediate regime in which @xmath166 is activated .",
    "the scope of the present paper will be limited to the temperature regime in which knight shifts are activated .",
    "an other paper will be devoted to low lying spin excitations and the occurence of low temperature line shifts and broadenings .",
    "we shall assume that the temperature dependence of @xmath157 can be ascribed to the spin excitations above the spin gap @xmath167 as for the undoped two - leg ladders .",
    "hence , we fit the spin part @xmath166 using the following troyer expression , valid in the low temperature domain @xcite , @xmath168 the values of @xmath167 thus obtained via fitting the data to eq .",
    "( 10 ) for @xmath169 and @xmath68 at ambient and under a pressure of @xmath69 are displayed in fig.4 .",
    "the effect of pressure is large at all @xmath3 contents .",
    "the relative reduction of @xmath167 under pressure is steadily increasing with the density of holes ( _ vide infra_).we note that the data at ambient pressure agree fairly well with those published in ref.@xcite .",
    "the spin gap value of 840k which is obtained for @xmath65 is significantly larger than the results of undoped @xmath22 ladders which are obtained through the @xmath170 knight shift in @xmath171 , ( @xmath172k ) @xcite or by susceptibility in the @xmath18 structure @xcite .",
    "however , these results fit rather well with our overall doping dependence of the spin gap in hole - doped ladders pertaining to the @xmath60 series which is presented in the present work .",
    "temperature dependences of the spin - lattice relaxation rate @xmath173 for @xmath174 axis at various pressures are displayed in figs.5a , b and 6 .",
    "it should be noted that the recovery curve of the nuclear magnetization was best fitted above @xmath175 according to eq .",
    "( 3 ) with a single @xmath115 component and with values for the @xmath119 coefficients very close to values expected for magnetic relaxation of the central line in the presence of strong quadrupolar coupling , namely @xmath176 .",
    "@xmath177    a look at figs.5a , b and 6 reveals at glance the clear existence of several different regimes for the temperature dependence of the relaxation rate in agreement with previous studies of hole - doped spin ladders , @xcite . in all samples there is an activated regime in ranges depending on the @xmath3 content which breaks down at low @xmath86 . below 30k",
    "we can clearly see the emergence under pressure of a contribution to @xmath178 which is linear in temperature ( korringa - like ) when @xmath33 exceeds the value 8 .",
    "this low temperature domain has been considered earlier in ref@xcite and will be the subject of a further reinvestigation .",
    "moreover , @xmath178 s for all @xmath9 compounds become nearly @xmath86-independent at high temperature and show a tendency to increase under pressure .",
    "figures 7a , b display the @xmath86 dependence of the gaussian component of the spin - echo decay rate @xmath179 measured with @xmath73 at different pressures .",
    "we observe that @xmath179 increases gradually on cooling and is suppressed by increasing pressure and doping .",
    "the determination of @xmath180 is no longer possible below 150k in the heavily doped samples , @xmath181 .",
    "this is due to a drastic shortening of @xmath182 at low temperature which prevents the derivation of the gaussian component .",
    "the purpose of this section is to examine how the observed knight shifts can be related to the spin excitations of the @xmath53 spin ladders since @xmath166 is likely to be governed by these excitations .",
    "there are first the spin excitations present in the undoped limit , _",
    "i.e. _ excitations localized on the rung triplets in the strong coupling limit which give rise to a degenerate one - magnon band starting at the energy @xmath167 for @xmath183 when the coupling along the legs is switched on",
    ". there is also a two - magnon continuum starting at the energy @xmath184 , ( see fig.8 ) .",
    "these magnon excitations are indeed very robust against the weakening of the rung coupling since at intermediate coupling @xmath185 the spin gap is still of order @xmath186 @xcite . furthermore the magnon gap is also robust against doping up to 0.25 hole per @xmath29 site _ albeit _ a significant decrease is observed as expected from the theory @xcite . there is also an other kind of triplet spin excitations which must be considered when spin ladders are doped .",
    "they consist of hole pairs on the same rung dissociating into two individual quasiparticles on different rungs@xcite .",
    "the role of quasiparticles on the nmr data will be discussed elsewhere .    in the gapped regime",
    "we shall assume that low lying excited states correspond to the excitations of single magnon modes with @xmath187 at the energy @xmath188 .",
    "these modes govern the temperature dependence of the susceptibility , leading to the troyer formula @xcite .",
    "we may notice as pointed out in ref@xcite that the formalism leading to eq .",
    "( 10 ) applies only to the very low temperature regime.in particular , the repulsion between magnons which prevent two magnons from occupying the same rung is not properly taken into account and is essential to get a correct temperature dependence.this may be a reason explaining why troyer s formula is followed only up to about @xmath189 in figs .",
    "1b and 2b .",
    "values for the spin gap derived from a fit of the experimental data in figs . 1b,2b,3b with the troyer formula are displayed in figure 4 _ versus _",
    "@xmath3 content at @xmath190 and @xmath191 .",
    "figures 5a , b,6 tell us that the spin gap is steadily decreasing upon @xmath3 doping as long as @xmath33 is smaller than 8 . as established by the optical spectral weight data , @xmath3 doping amounts to a redistribution of the holes between chains and ladders @xcite .",
    "the main effect of @xmath3 doping on the structure is a reduction of the @xmath23 parameter .",
    "a similar conclusion is reached by analyzing the effect of hydrostatic pressure .",
    "this is the @xmath23 parameter which is most sensitive to pressure .",
    "hence , using the spin gap _ versus _ @xmath33 displayed in fig .",
    "4 and structural data under pressure @xcite , we are in a position to establish a correspondence between the respective roles of pressure and calcium doping .",
    "the contraction of the lattice parameters induced by a pressure of @xmath192 corresponds to the additional substitution of three @xmath17 by three @xmath3 , _",
    "@xmath193 @xcite .",
    "we can attribute the decrease of @xmath167 upon ca substitution in fig .",
    "4 to a transfer of holes from the chains to the ladders .",
    "we can also use the doping calibration curve to plot the variation of @xmath194 against the hole density in the ladders .",
    "this plot is displayed in fig .",
    "9 where spin gaps at each @xmath3 doping levels have been normalized by the experimental value of the gap in the @xmath65 compound at ambient pressure , 840k .",
    "furthermore , we have assumed a negligible amount of holes in the ladders of the @xmath65 sample under ambient pressure , given the average @xmath29 valence of 2.04 and the distribution of holes between chains and ladders in @xmath195 which supports the dominant role of holes in the chains .",
    "subsequently all gaps have been normalized to the undoped ladder value .    the amplitude of the intraladder coupling although unknown in @xmath65 should not depart strongly from the values obtained in layered cuprates or the undoped @xmath196ladder , namely @xmath197 leading in turn to @xmath198 .",
    "the numerical results for the heisenberg ladder@xcite would thus correspond to @xmath199 which is a reasonable value in the undoped ladder limit .",
    "this is consistent with the anisotropy ratio which has been derived from the interpretation of the neutron scattering data in @xmath200 introducing a smaller four - spin exchange interaction @xcite . as pressure",
    "is increased we can expect some redistribution of the holes to take place between chains and ladders with a maximum concentration for the holes on the ladders reachable under pressure corresponding to the uniform situation , namely @xmath201 . using the measured value of the spin gap in @xmath65 , the plot of fig .",
    "9 suggests that the density of holes in the @xmath65 ladders amounts to @xmath202 under @xmath69 .",
    "we have also assumed in fig .",
    "9 the ladder hole density reaching the saturation value of 0.25 in @xmath68 under pressure .    the data in fig . 9 have been compared to the calculation of the gap for a two - chain hubbard model using the density matrix renormalization group @xcite .",
    "we notice a good agreement between the theory and the experimental data at ambient pressure .",
    "however , the agreement is no longer satisfying at @xmath69 when @xmath33 is larger than 8.we are thus forced to look for an other source of pressure dependence for the spin gap in @xmath3-rich ( strongly hole - doped ) samples .",
    "we notice a persistent discrepancy between the determinations of the spin gap by nmr and inelastic neutron spectroscopy ( ins ) .",
    "several attempts to measure the spin gap in pristine and @xmath3-substituted samples of the @xmath9 series by inelastic neutron spectroscopy have provided a gap of about 32 - 35 mev in all compounds independent of the ca concentration @xcite .",
    "the disagreement is even more striking in @xmath203 when spin gaps are measured by the two techniques @xcite .",
    "since neutron data have been obtained at low temperature it could be argued that finite temperature effects could affect the determination of the spin gap via suceptibility and relaxation time measurements via magnon damping possibly enhanced by the dissociation of quasiparticle pairs @xcite .",
    "however the comparison between neutron and susceptibility data remains a major challenge in the physics of doped spin ladders .",
    "furthermore , no pressure dependence could be detected by neutron spectroscopy in @xmath3 rich samples @xcite .",
    "what is badly needed now is a neutron measurement of the spin excitations in the pressure domain @xmath204 .",
    "what is most remarkable in fig.3b is the existence of a finite value for the knight shift at low temperature in @xmath68 at pressures larger than @xmath205 .",
    "this contribution is also visible in samples with a smaller @xmath3 content although only in the high pressure limit .",
    "a small contribution is still observed in @xmath206 under @xmath207 but the zero temperature knight shift of @xmath208 would not depart from zero even under pressure , see fig .",
    "a finite zero temperature knight shift is the signature of low - lying spin excitations .",
    "a look at figures .",
    "3b and 4 suggests that the onset of a zero temperature knight shift corresponds to a critical value of the spin gap @xmath209k .",
    "the low temperature knight shift has been the subject of an extensive pressure study only in @xmath68 samples .",
    "the data show a steady increase of the low temperature knight shift above @xmath6 going along with a decrease of the spin gap displayed in fig .",
    "we have used the same nmr resonant circuit to look for superconductivity in @xmath68 under @xmath158 without any magnetic field applied .",
    "the onset of the tuning frequency shift occurs at 6.7k , see fig .",
    "10 . in spite of a small signal due to an nmr circuit which is not optimized for the detection of superconductivity",
    "we take it as the signature of the superconducting ground state under @xmath154 . the onset temperature given by ac methods",
    "is known to be one or two degrees below the transition temperature obtained by the onset of the resistive transition when the transition is not extremely narrow .",
    "hence this ac result at @xmath154 is in fair agreement with the accepted phase diagram for superconductivity @xcite .",
    "most interesting on fig.11 displaying the pressure dependence of @xmath210 and @xmath211 is the coexistence under @xmath154 of superconductivity at 6.7k with a finite spin gap of 80k and a large zero temperature knight shift .      our first attempt to understand the spin lattice relaxation data presented in figs .",
    "5a , b and 6 will be to examine how far one can go into the interpretation using magnon modes of the undoped spin ladder corresponding to spin triplet excitations .",

    "iv.b from the value of the spin gap taking into account the inter - ladder coupling interaction .",
    "a feature of the @xmath326 phase diagram ( figure .",
    "11 ) that deserves a special consideration is the existence of a maximum of the superconducting critical temperature when pressure drives the characteristic energy scales for pair binding energy and the spin gap down to values of the order of @xmath211 .",
    "beyond this optimal pressure for the highest @xmath211 , denoted as @xmath327 , these intra - ladder gaps become irrelevant and hence @xmath211 decreases under pressure .",
    "the latter pressure domain is also characterized by a temperature dependence of resistivity along the inter - ladder @xmath328 direction that becomes metallic @xcite .",
    "such a change of behavior in @xmath211 can be seen as a cross - over from strong to weak coupling conditions for long - range superconducting order .",
    "arguments in support of this viewpoint follow from simple considerations about mechanisms of long - range superconducting order in coupled ladder systems .",
    "let us consider in the first place the region below @xmath327 where the gaps are larger than @xmath211 ; in this domain , long - range superconducting coherence perpendicular to ladder leg direction can only be achieved through a josephson coupling .",
    "an analysis based on the renormalized perturbation theory@xcite shows that the josephson coupling takes the form of @xmath329 where @xmath330 stands as the size of the superconducting hole pairs within the ladders , while @xmath331 is the inter - ladder single electron hopping ( @xmath332 ) .",
    "this expression contains the usual term @xmath333 for the effective transverse motion of the pairs requiring an intermediate energy of order @xmath334 ( the confinement temperature of hole pairs on ladders , see sec.i ) and a factor @xmath335 that accounts for the increase in probability for pair hopping due to delocalization of holes forming the pairs along the ladder direction@xcite . as for pair correlations of isolated ladders , they are well known to be strongly enhanced in the presence of a spin gap .",
    "numerical and analytical results for @xmath336 and repulsive hubbard models for example@xcite , show that ` d - wave ' pair susceptibility follows a power law @xmath337 for temperatures below the spin gap , where @xmath338 .",
    "a molecular - field approximation of the josepshon coupling that rigourously takes the influence of intra - ladder correlations into account , allows one to obtain at once an expression for the transition temperature .",
    "thus from the condition @xmath339 one finds , @xmath340 which assumes that @xmath341 .",
    "it follows that @xmath211 increases when @xmath334 decreases , a feature that is essentially governed by the increase of the josephson coupling under pressure .",
    "now when pressure is further increased , one reaches the domain where @xmath342 and a change in the physical picture of the transition occurs .",
    "the gaps are no longer relevant for the mechanism promoting long - range order and its description evolves toward a weak coupling picture @xmath343 a situation that bears close similarities with the antiferromagnetic ordering of quasi - one - dimensional organic conductors with a charge gap under pressure@xcite .",
    "when the metallic character of the normal state is well developed along longitudinal and transverse directions the motion of the holes is likely to be coherent along both directions leading to fermi liquid conditions @xmath343 or deconfinement of holes , in agreement with the restoration of a metallic transverse resistivity .",
    "thus sufficiently above @xmath327 , the transition temperature should follow from a weak coupling bcs prescription which yields @xmath344 here @xmath345 is the residual attractive coupling between deconfined holes .",
    "since pressure weakens the strength of short - range superconducting correlations , it will lead to a decrease of @xmath346 at the energy scale @xmath331 for deconfinement@xcite .",
    "this in turn reduces @xmath211 as a function of pressure .",
    "it follows then that a maximum of @xmath211 is expected when the ladder system evolves from strong to weak coupling conditions for hole pairing at @xmath347 .",
    "a qualitative description of the pressure profile of @xmath211 and @xmath210 is summarized in figure . 13 .",
    "the present work has reported a @xmath43-nmr study of the spin gap structure and of the spin excitations under pressure of the doped @xmath348 ladders in the @xmath60 family covering a wide range of hole doping .",
    "a similar study has been performed with the compound @xmath59 in which the ladders are nearly undoped .",
    "the spin gap is found to decrease steadily from @xmath65 ( @xmath349k ) to @xmath206 ( @xmath350k ) as @xmath33 is increased and more smoothly at larger @xmath3 concentration up to @xmath68 . comparing the effect of pressure on the spin gap and on the lattice parameters enables us to explain the @xmath33 and @xmath309 dependences of the spin gap in the low @xmath3 doping range by the evolution of the hole doping from 0.028 up to 0.15 .",
    "a pressure of @xmath69 does not alter the spin excitations qualitatively when @xmath351 since the susceptibility is still reaching a zero value at low temperature .",
    "however in @xmath3 rich samples , pressure promotes the existence of low lying spin excitations giving rise to a finite susceptibility at low temperature .    the salient result of this study is the coexistence in the @xmath68 sample under the pressure of @xmath154 of gapped spin excitations ( with a gap of 80k ) with superconductivity at 6.7k .",
    "the results of the present work provide a further confirmation to the early study published by mayaffre et - al @xcite although the actual title of ref @xcite may appear as somewhat misleading in the light of coexisting gapped and low lying spin excitations .",
    "these new results are supporting the exciting prospect of superconductivity induced by the interladder tunnelling of preformed pairs @xcite at least in the pressure domain where the pressure remains smaller than the pressure corresponding to the maximum of the critical temperature for superconductivity .",
    "after the study of the spin - lattice relaxation of @xmath43 nuclei in the @xmath62 series for various levels of @xmath3 substitution and also under pressure we are able to identify two different temperature regimes . a fairly consistent interpretation of the spin lattice relaxation data above 50k is obtained by taking into consideration two and three - magnon modes relaxation channels responsible for the activated nuclear relaxation in the gapped temperature regime and a quasi-1d spin dynamics at high temperature .",
    "using a linear combination between two and three magnon modes enables us to remove the discrepancy between activation energies obtained from susceptibility and @xmath352 experiments .",
    "the dependence of the gaussian relaxation time has confirmed that the rise of the correlation length at low temperature is limited by two factors ; the quantum limitation due to the finite spin gap and the average distance between holes .",
    "it is the second factor which prevails in @xmath3-rich samples under pressure .",
    "a kink in the temperature dependence of @xmath353 at high pressure in heavily doped samples has been attributed to the manifestation of a cross - over between the behavior of isolated ladders at high temperature and the behavior of coupled ladders at low temperature .    doped cuprate spin ladders in which the doping can be controlled by pressure are remarkable prototype compounds for the study of the mechanism for superconductivity in cuprates .",

    "<S> we discuss the interplay between superconductivity and the spin gap and suggest that these new results support the exciting prospect of superconductivity induced by the interladder tunnelling of preformed pairs as long as the pressure remains lower than the pressure corresponding to the maximum of the superconducting critical temperature . </S>"
