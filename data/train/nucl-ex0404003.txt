    "the @xmath18 has a short lifetime of 1.3 fm / c therefor the rescattering of the decay daughters is expected to be large . due to the long life - time of the @xmath16 resonance ( 44 fm / c ) we would expect no significant signal loss by rescattering of the daughters since most of the decays happen outside of the fireball , which is in agreement with our observation .",
    "using the measured values of k(892)/k and @xmath3(1520)/@xmath3 a thermal model , including rescattering , but no regeneration , predicts the lifetime interval between chemical and kinetic freeze - out to be @xmath245 fm / c .",
    "the decrease of the @xmath3(1520)/@xmath3 and k(892)/k@xmath17 ratio from p+p to au+au collisions occurs already for very peripheral collisions ( 50 - 80% ) and remains nearly constant up to the most central collisions ( 5% ) . in terms of the lifetime of the system between chemical and thermal freeze - out , @xmath25 ,",
