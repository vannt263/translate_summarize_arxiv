    "we also used the average density of states @xmath65 for the density of states factor in @xmath63 and put @xmath66 equal to 1 . for the range of dopings",

    "it depends only weakly on doping for @xmath73 . in this region",
    "the order parameter also varies only slowly along the fermi line , describing thus rather isotropic s - wave superconductivity . below",
    "@xmath74 @xmath75 rapidly decreases with decreasing doping wich is caused by a soft mode which freezes into an incommensurate bond - order wave at @xmath76 @xcite . as a result the s - wave order parameter becomes less and less isotropic with decreasing @xmath70 changing , for instance , for @xmath77 by about a factor 3 along the fermi line but it does not pass through zero .",
    "the d - wave coupling constant @xmath78 would be zero in the uncorrelated case .",
    "decreasing @xmath70 from large values correlation effects increase and the static vertex function @xmath79 develops more and more a forward scattering peak in the transferred momentum @xmath80 @xcite . in the extreme case where @xmath81 is proportional to @xmath82 @xmath75 and",
    "@xmath78 would become degenerate .",
    "1 shows that this degeneracy is nearly reached at low dopings .",
    "the strong localization of the effective interaction is caused by the forward scattering peak in @xmath81 and , in addition , by the incipient instability at @xmath83 which is also very localized in @xmath84-space .",
    "the neglect of retardation effects which leads to the bcs - formula eq.(6 ) is doubtful for several reasons .",
    "first , @xmath85 no longer corresponds really to a weak - coupling case .",
    "secondly , @xmath3 is no longer small compared to the frequency of the soft mode near @xmath83 which means that the frequency dependence of @xmath38 can not be neglected for these dopings .",
    "thirdly , and most severely , the formation of the forward scattering peak in the static vertex function @xmath81 is accompagnied by a strong frequency dependence which should be taken into account on the same footing as its momentum dependence .",
    "we thus have solved the gap equation eq.(2 ) assuming only that the momenta can be put right onto the fermi line but keeping the full frequency and momentum dependence along the fermi line .",
    "2 shows the obtained results for @xmath3 for a s - wave ( dashed line ) and a d - wave ( solid line ) order parameter , together with the @xmath3 curve for the uncorrelated case ( dash - dotted line ) .",
    "the first observation is that correlation effects always suppress s - wave superconductivity .",
    "the suppression is large for @xmath86 and becomes less pronounced at smaller dopings in agreement with previous results based on the static approximation @xcite .",
    "the order parameter associated with the dashed line in fig .",
    "2 varies only slowly along the fermi line , i.e. , we have a usual s - wave order parameter without nodes . in a gutzwiller description",
    "this order parameter would be exactly zero if retardation effects can be neglected and @xmath13 is taken : integrating out the phonons the effective interaction becomes in the static limit proportional to the double occupancy operator .",
    "any matrix element formed with gutzwiller wave functions thus would be zero .",
    "in contrast to that the enforcement of our constraint at large @xmath0 s , namely , that only @xmath24 out of the total @xmath0 states at a given site can be occupied at the same time , gives rise to another effect , which is absent in the gutzwiller treatment : the effective interaction becomes more and more long - ranged with decreasing doping .",
    "this makes isotropic s - wave superconductivity possible even in the presence of a @xmath13 constraint .",
    "2 nevertheless shows that the reduction of @xmath3 due to the constraint is substantial except at very small dopings where the effective interaction becomes extremely long - ranged and the suppression by the constraint is small .",
    "the kernel @xmath41 is in the absence of correlations and in the static limit negative for all arguments @xmath36 and @xmath87 .",
    "this implies that the s - wave symmetry has always the highest @xmath3 .",
    "according to our numerical studies the same is also true in the correlated case which explains why the solid line in fig .",
    "2 , describing d - wave superconductivity , is always below the dashed line . as indicated previously the very existence of finite values for @xmath3 with d - wave symmetry",
    "is in our model due to electronic correlation effects .",
    "1 showed that the momentum dependence of @xmath43 causes in the static limit a finite coupling strength in the d - wave channel . the solid line in fig .",
    "2 proves that a finite @xmath3 in the d - wave channel results from this even if the strong frequency dependence of @xmath43 is also taken into account .",
    "3 shows results for the isotope coefficient @xmath4 in the case of s - wave ( dashed line ) and d - wave ( solid line ) superconductivty .",
    "we assumed hereby that @xmath6 is inversely and @xmath21 directly proportional to the the square root of the mass rendering @xmath63 independent of the mass . neglecting the frequency dependence of @xmath43",
    "there is only one energy scale involved in the gap equation which yields @xmath88 independent of doping , @xmath63 , etc .",
    "in contrast to that the curves in fig . 3 show that @xmath4 increases monotonically with decreasing doping and is always larger than 1/2 .",
    "the deviaton of @xmath4 from the value 1/2 is due to the frequency dependence of @xmath43 which increases with decreasing doping @xcite and acts as a second energy scale .",
    "the non - adiabatic effects produced by electronic correlations thus always increase @xmath4 for our range of parameter values .",
    "this should be contrasted to the case where vertex corrections due to the electron - phonon interaction has been studied @xcite , and where @xmath4 may be larger or smaller than @xmath5 .",
    "we can conclude from our results that models based on phonon - induced effective interactions in the presence of correlations seem not to be very attractive models for high - t@xmath7 superconductivity because a ) the largest transition temperatures are found for s - wave symmetry for all dopings and b ) the isotope coefficient is larger than @xmath89 , especially at low dopings .",
    "experimentally , high-@xmath3 cuprates exhibit d - wave superconductivity and , at least near optimal dopings , small isotope effects .",
    "superconducting instabilites of the pure @xmath1 model have been studied in @xcite .",
    "the smallest eigenvalue of @xmath40 and , correspondingly , the largest @xmath90 always occur in the d - wave symmetry channel . on the other hand , the phonon - induced effective interaction described by @xmath41 favors in the @xmath1 model mainly s - wave superconductivity . in this section",
    ", we will consider the case where both effective interactions are present and study the symmetry of the resulting superconducting state , its transition temperature and isotope coefficient .",
    "4 shows the two lowest eigenvalues of the matrix eq.(5 ) which occur in the s- and d - wave symmetry channel . for @xmath38 both terms in eq.(3 ) have been included . for @xmath91",
    "the lowest eigenvalue has d - wave symmetry and decreases steadily and strongly with decreasing doping diverging finally at @xmath83 . comparing the solid lines in figs . 1 and 4 of this work and fig . 2 in @xcite",
    "one sees that the lowest eigenvalue is roughly additive in the @xmath1 and the phonon contributions though , of course , @xmath40 and @xmath41 do not commute with each other .",
    "note also the considerable contribution of the phonon part to @xmath78 though the overall dimensionless coupling constant has the rather moderate value @xmath85 .",
    "the eigenvalue @xmath75 ( dashed line in fig .",
    "4 ) is rather constant for @xmath92 and decreases much less towards lower dopings than @xmath78 .",
    "there is a crossover from d - wave to s - wave symmetry in the lowest eigenvalue at @xmath93 suggesting that the s - wave order parameter is more stable than the d - wave order parameter at high dopings .",
    "such a crossover is expected for general reasons : for large dopings correlation effects play a minor role . as a result",
    "the d - wave part in the phonon - induced effective interaction as well as the whole @xmath1 part becomes small whereas the s - wave part of the holstein model will dominate .",
    "a comparison of the solid lines in figs .",
    "1 and 4 nevertheless shows that the latter is very effectively suppressed by the @xmath1 part at practically all considered dopings .",
    "for instance , @xmath94 in fig .",
    "1 is for @xmath86 about a factor 4 larger than in fig .",
    "the solution of the gap equation eq.(2 ) is not straightforward because @xmath38 contains both instantaneous and retarded contributions and because the various retarded contributions have different effective cutoff energies .",
    "we developed in @xcite a method to solve eq.(2 ) directly avoiding the use of pseudopotentials .",
    "the only simplification is that we put the momenta in retarded ( but not in instantaneous ) contributions to the fermi line .",
    "this approximation has been checked numerically and found to be very well satisfied in our case .",
    "using the fact that the instantaneous kernel consists only of a few separable contributions eq.(2 ) can for a given matsubara frequency reduced to a linear matrix problem of order 1 and 3 for d- and s - wave symmetry , respectively .    in fig .",
    "5 we have plotted the calculated values for @xmath3 for d - wave symmetry @xmath50 as a function of the doping @xmath70 .",
    "the dashed - dotted line corresponds to @xmath95 , the solid line to @xmath96 .",
    "the figure shows that phonons always increase the @xmath3 for d - wave superconductivity .",
    "the increase is especially large at low dopings .",
    "this is quite in contrast to calculations in the weak - coupling case @xcite where the @xmath3 of d - wave superconductivity is lowered by phonons .",
    "the physical picture in the latter case is that the effective interaction of the electronic part is repulsive and strongly peaked near the @xmath9-point whereas the phononic d - wave part is attractive and diminuishes especially at the @xmath9-point the repulsion causing a lowering of @xmath3 . in our case",
    "the dependence of the static effective interaction of the pure @xmath1 model on the transferred momentum can be inferred from figs.1a ) and 1b ) in ref .",
    "for small dopings the phonon part is restricted to small momenta which means that it would contribute only near the @xmath14-point in fig .",
    "1b ) of ref . @xcite . as a result",
    "the total effective interaction would become even more attractive around the @xmath14-point and elsewhere not be changed .",
    "this clearly would enhance the d - wave part of the effective interaction which is also in agreement with fig .",
    "4 . from figs . 1",
    ", 4 and 5 it is evident that the large lowering of the eigenvalue @xmath78 due to phonons corresponds only to a rather moderate increase in @xmath3 .",
    "this means that the use of a bcs - formula with a fixed effective cutoff would grossly overestimate the increase in @xmath3 for d - wave superconductivity due to phonons .",
    "what has been overlooked in such an approach is that we deal with at least three energy scales , namely @xmath66 , @xmath29 , and @xmath6 .",
    "for instance , the instantaneous contribution of the @xmath1 part is characterized by the energy scale @xmath66 whereas the phononic one by @xmath6 .",
    "since @xmath97 it is evident that the phononic part in @xmath78 will contribute to @xmath3 much less than the @xmath1 part .",
    "we were unable to find any finite transition temperatures @xmath98 for @xmath99 , i.e. , for symmetries different from the d - wave symmetry .. taking the accuracy of our calculation into account this means that @xmath100 for @xmath99 . as shown in fig .",
    "2 the phonon - induced effective interactions leads to a considerable @xmath3 for s - wave superconductivity . the @xmath1 part to the effective interaction ,",
    "however , is very repulsive in the s - wave channel prohibiting s - wave superconductivity .",
    "we can not exclude that the crossover at @xmath93 in fig . 4 in the lowest eigenvalue from d - wave to",
    "s - wave could stabilize a s - wave order parameter at large dopings .",
    "another possibility is that other symmetries than d- or s - wave become stable at large dopings in view of the approximate degeneracy of the eigenvalues of practically all symmetries in the pure @xmath1 model @xcite . in any case",
    ", the corresponding @xmath3 s would be smaller than @xmath101 for all dopings and thus be rather irrelevant .",
    "the behavior of the isotope coefficient @xmath4 as a function of doping is another interesting test for any theory of high-@xmath3 superconductivity .",
    "6 shows the calculated @xmath4 for @xmath85 , @xmath69 , @xmath102 in the case of @xmath50 symmetry .",
    "it is always positive , starting from small values at small dopings . with increasing doping it increases monotonously approaching values near @xmath5 at large dopings .",
    "our calculated curve shows the typical behavior of the experimetal data , namely , a small value for @xmath4 at optimal doping and substantial values far away from optimal doping @xcite .",
    "the curve in fig .",
    "6 is the result of several    competing effects .",
    "we saw in fig .",
    "3 that correlation effects in the phonon - induced part cause a doping dependence of @xmath4 which is opposite to that in fig .",
    "6 , namely , a monotonously increasing @xmath4 with decreasing doping starting at the classical value of @xmath5 at large dopings .",
    "including also the @xmath1 part the large values of @xmath4 at low dopings are nearly completely and at larger dopings partially quenched .",
    "part of this effect may be understood from fig .",
    "5 . it shows that the relative importance of the phonon contribution increases steadily with increasing @xmath70 except at very small dopings . in a simple picture",
    "one thus may argue that at small dopings @xmath3 is mainly due to the @xmath1 part .",
    "this part decays faster than the phononic part with doping so that @xmath3 at larger dopings is mainly due to the phonons . a more realistic interpretation of fig .",
    "6 should , however , also take into account the complex competition between the three energy scales @xmath66 , @xmath29 , and @xmath6 , pair breaking effects , etc .",
    "in order to get more insight into the behavior of @xmath4 we have calculated @xmath3 and @xmath4 in the @xmath50 symmetry channel for the fixed doping value @xmath103 as a function of the phonon frequency @xmath6 .",
    "[ fig : fig7 ] shows the result for @xmath104 and @xmath85 . the solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig7 ] represents the value for @xmath3 , multiplied with 10 .",
    "since we keep @xmath63 fixed the coupling constant @xmath21 approaches zero in the adiabatic limit @xmath105 which means that @xmath3 in this limit is solely due to the @xmath1 part .",
    "with increasing phonon frequency @xmath3    increases monotonously , passing over from an initial sublinear to a linear behavior .",
    "the solid line shows that phonons always increase @xmath3 for d - wave superconductivity .",
    "the absolute values in the figure are quite remarkable : though the employed coupling constant for @xmath63 is rather moderate and though the phonon contribution to @xmath3 in the d - wave channel is entirely due to correlation effects @xmath3 increases by nearly a factor 3 for @xmath106 corresponding to about the largest phonons in the cuprates . the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig7 ] represents the dependence of @xmath4 on @xmath6 . for small @xmath6 @xmath4",
    "is practically zero .",

    "[ fig : fig7 ] may be understood in physical terms roughly in the following way . in our model",
    "the static effective coupling is independent of the phonon mass , i.e. , of @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath4 is thus determined by an effective energy cutoff . for small @xmath6",
    "s this cutoff is mainly given by electronic parameters in the @xmath1 part leading to a small value for @xmath4 . at large @xmath6 s the phonon contribution to @xmath3 , which is only due to electronic correlations , determines mainly the total effective energy cutoff causing a value of @xmath4 near @xmath5 .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have treated the electron - electron and the electron - phonon interactions in a generalized @xmath1 model by means of a systematic @xmath11 expansion and have solved the resulting linearized equation for the superconducting gap by reliable numerical methods .",
    "we found that electronic correlations affect phonon - induced superconductivity in several ways : instabilities towards d - wave or other symmetries different from s - wave become possible .",
    "the corresponding transition temperatures are , however , always smaller than that of s - wave superconductivity . moreover , the @xmath3 for s - wave superconductivity is at larger dopings heavily and at small dopings somewhat suppressed by correlations .",
    "the isotope coefficient @xmath4 is @xmath5 at large dopings but increases with increasing correlations , i.e. , decreasing dopings , both in the s- and d - wave channel .",
    "including also the @xmath1 part in the effective interaction we found that within our numerical accurracy only d - wave superconductivity is stable for dopings @xmath67 and that the phononic part always increases @xmath3 for the above dopings .",
    "the @xmath1 part in the effective interaction changes the dependence of @xmath4 on doping : @xmath4 assumes now small values at low dopings and increases monotonously with doping towards the classical value @xmath5 at large dopings .",
    "keeping @xmath63 fixed and varying the phonon mass , i.e. , @xmath6 we find that @xmath3 and @xmath4 increase monotonously with @xmath6 and that @xmath4 varies between zero at small and roughly @xmath5 at large phonon frequencies within the interval @xmath107 .",
    "our findings differ in many aspects from the corresponding results based on weak - coupling calculations @xcite . in these calculations",
    "@xmath3 for d - wave superconductivity induced either by a @xmath8 or a spin - fluctuation term is always suppressed by phonons .",
    "for instance , in the fluctuation - exchange approximation @xmath3 drops to zero if the phonon - mediated on - site attraction @xmath108 becomes comparable to the hubbard term @xmath8@xcite .",
    "we treated the opposite case where @xmath109 and found a different behavior , namely , that phonons enhance the @xmath3 for d - wave superconductivity .",
    "our different result is mainly caused by corrections to the bare electron - phonon vertex due to the strong electron - electron interaction .",
    "this vertex develops for not too large dopings a forward scattering peak so that only phonon with small momenta can couple to the electrons . as a result the electron - phonon and the @xmath1 contributions to the gap decouple in @xmath36 space .",
    "our calculations show that the two contributions no longer cancel each other to a large extent but , on the contrary , enhance each other . for a momentum - independent bare electron - phonon coupling weak - coupling calculations",
    "yield a small , often negative value for the isotope coefficient @xmath4 which is rather independent of doping .",
    "in our case the strong momentum - dependence of the effective electron - phonon coupling , induced by electronic correlations , causes a strong dependence of @xmath4 on doping : being always positive , @xmath4 is small at optimal doping and assumes values of roughly @xmath5 at large dopings in agreement with the basic features of the experimental data in the cuprates .",
    "the presented results are accurate at large @xmath0 s because we have taken only the leading terms of a @xmath11 expansion .",
    "phonon renormalizations and vertex corrections due to the electron - phonon interaction are of @xmath2 and thus have been omitted .",
    "on the other hand it is known that in the physical case @xmath13 anharmonic effects in the atomic potentials and the formation of polarons occur if @xmath63 is about 1 or larger @xcite .",

    "<S> the corresponding isotope coefficient @xmath4 is larger than @xmath5 and increases with decreasing doping . </S>",
    "<S> including also the @xmath1 part in the gap equation the leading @xmath3 has always d - wave symmetry with phonons giving a positive contribution to @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath4 is very small at small dopings and increases towards the classical value @xmath5 with increasing dopings similar as in many cuprates . </S>",
    "<S> considered as a function of the phonon frequency @xmath6 at a fixed coupling strength @xmath4 increases monotonously from zero to about @xmath5 with increasing @xmath6 .    </S>",
