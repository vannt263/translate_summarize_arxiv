    "in the last decade , we have witnessed a flood of low - mass star and brown dwarf detections , due to improvements in infrared array technologies and the advent of large - scale , near - infrared sky surveys using these detectors . in 1995 , the first brown dwarfs were discovered after decades of failed searches  the companion object gl 229b @xcite and the pleiades brown dwarf teide 1 @xcite . since then , nearly one hundred brown dwarfs have been detected as companions to nearby stars and in the field , most made by new sky surveys such as the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass @xcite ) , the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss @xcite ) , and the deep near - infrared survey ( denis @xcite ) .",
    "others have been identified photometrically in various cluster surveys ( see contribution by r.  rebolo , these proceedings ) .",
    "these surveys have finally brought brown dwarfs out of the realm of the theoretical and into that of the observational .",
    "two new spectral classes have also been defined as a result of these low - mass discoveries .",

    "t spectral class _ , defined by the presence of ch@xmath1 absorption at 2.2 @xmath0 @xcite , is discussed here .",
    "the prototype for this class , gl 229b , shows ch@xmath1 and h@xmath2o absorption bands throughout the near - infrared @xcite , exhibiting a spectral morphology similar to those of the giant planets @xcite .",
    "gl 229b remained the solitary t dwarf until mid-1999 , when 2mass , sdss , and the new technology telescope deep field uncovered field analogs . to date , at least 23 t dwarfs have been identified @xcite , a number sufficient to begin consideration of spectral classification .      the classification of late - type dwarfs ( which we define here as objects later than spectral type k7v ) has been done for over one hundred years using a variety of features in photographic , red optical , and near - infrared spectra .",

    "2 we address red optical classification , based on a spectral sample of bright t dwarfs identified by 2mass and sdss . in  3 we discuss near - infrared classification of a larger sample , and discuss spectral features important for classification . in ",
    "4 we describe spectral features in the near - infrared which may depend on specific gravity , and could therefore append a second dimension to a temperature scheme , in analogy to the mk luminosity classes .",
    "we summarize our discussion in  5 .",
    "l dwarfs are classified by @xcite using 630010100   red optical spectra at 9   resolution , obtained with the low resolution imaging spectrograph ( lris @xcite ) mounted on the keck 10 m telescope . as shown in fig .",
    "6 of @xcite , this spectral range samples most of the prominent molecular and atomic features in late - m and l dwarf spectra , and a recipe  for spectral classification from m7v to l8v is presented based on measurements of spectral indices on selected standards . in order to make a direct comparison with this l dwarf scheme , we have obtained optical spectra for nine t dwarfs utilizing the same instrumental setup as @xcite .",
    "data acquisition and reduction are described in @xcite .",
    "reduced spectra are shown in fig .  2 for 2mass 0559 - 14 @xcite and gl 570d @xcite , along with data for gl 229b @xcite and l dwarfs 2mass 1507 - 16 ( l5v ) , 2mass 0920 + 35 ( l6.5v ) , and 2mass 1632 + 19 ( l8v ) @xcite .",
    "spectra are displayed on a log scale and offset in order to highlight features .",
    "a few general trends are readily apparent .",
    "most obvious is the increased spectral slope from 800010100  in the t dwarfs , a feature which has been attributed to pressure broadened k i at 7665 and 7699  @xcite . a drop in flux shortward of 6600",
    " is due to the similarly broadened na i d lines at 5890 and 5895  @xcite",
    ". increased h@xmath2o absorption at 9250  is seen in the t dwarfs , strongest in gl 229b and gl 570d .",
    "crh ( 8611  ) , feh ( 8692  ) , and na i ( 8183 , 8195  ) features weaken in the late l dwarfs , and are completely absent in the t dwarfs .",
    "the behavior of the cs i ( 8543 , 8943  ) lines is less straightforward , appearing to strengthen slightly from l5v to 2mass 0559 - 14 , but weakening in gl 229b and gl 570d , with the 8943  line becoming blended with ch@xmath1 at 8900  .",
    "rb i ( 7800 , 7948  ) lines may be strengthening from mid - l to 2mass 0559 - 14 , but lack of signal prevents their detection in the other t dwarfs ( only five objects in our sample exhibit flux shortward of 8000  ) .",
    "feh ( 9896  ) is known to weaken from mid- to late - l @xcite , and is barely detected in 2mass 1632 + 19 ; however , 2mass 0559 - 14 shows a clear band , while gl 229b and gl 570d do not .",
    "cah ( 6750  ) may be present in all of the spectra shown here , but is exceedingly weak in the latest l dwarfs and 2mass 0559 - 14 .",
    "it is clear , then , that there are qualitative differences in the optical spectra of l and t dwarfs .",
    "the t dwarfs themselves appear to be distinguishable , based on their spectral slope , the presence of 9896  feh , and the 9250  h@xmath2o band strength . to explore these differences quantitatively ,",
    "we have examined a set of spectral indices , as described in table 1 .",
    "index values are plotted in fig .  3 for the five brightest t dwarfs in our sample and gl 229b ( open circles ) , as well as late - m and l dwarf standards from @xcite ( solid circles ) .",
    "t dwarfs are ordered by their h@xmath2o index .",
    "the deepening of the 9250  h@xmath2o band in the t dwarfs is readily apparent , as is the increased spectral slope measured by the color - d index .",
    "weakening of the 8611  crh and 9896  feh bands from types l to t is similarly seen in their respective indices .",
    "the ki - a index , which measures the relative depth of the broadened k i doublet ( or alternately its breadth ) , peaks at around l8v , then decreases through the t dwarfs ; this is due either to lower signal - to - noise in the latter objects or the formation of kcl at t@xmath3 @xmath4 950 k @xcite .",

    "based on these spectral indices and the quality of the observed spectra , we make three conclusions regarding t dwarf classification in the optical :    * l and t dwarfs ( later than 2mass 0559 - 14 ) appear to be distinguishable in the red optical , due to the absence of crh ( 8611  ) and feh ( 8692  ) bands , increased 9250  h@xmath2o absorption , and increased spectral slope in the t dwarfs .",
    "* t dwarfs can be separated in the red optical based on the presence or absence of the 9896  feh band , 9250  h@xmath2o band strength , and spectral slope .",
    "the observed scatter , however , restricts us to only distinguishing `` early '' t dwarfs ( e.g. , 2mass 0559 - 14 ) from `` late '' ones ( e.g. , gl 570d ) . * despite these successes , the faintness of these objects in the optical ( m@xmath6 @xmath4 24.6 for gl 229b @xcite ) makes it necessary to consider classification in the near - infrared .",
    "the spectral energy distribution of t dwarfs peaks at around 1.27 @xmath0 , the center of the j - band window , due to the combined effects of temperature and h@xmath2o , ch@xmath1 , and collision - induced ( cia ) h@xmath2 absorption features .",
    "the 12.5 @xmath0 region also encompasses the defining 2.2 @xmath0 ch@xmath1 band . in our program to identify these cool brown dwarfs , we have acquired 12.5 @xmath0 spectra of 14 t dwarfs at a resolution of r @xmath4 100 ( 100 at 1 @xmath0 ) using the near - infrared camera ( nirc @xcite ) mounted on the keck 10 m telescope .",

    "the spectra in fig .",
    "4 are ordered by visual inspection , based on the increasing strengths of the 1.15 and 1.6 @xmath0 absorption bands .",
    "the 1.15 @xmath0 feature begins in the late l dwarfs as a blend of h@xmath2o , two k i doublets ( 1.169 & 1.177 , 1.243 & 1.252 @xmath0 ) , na i ( 1.138 , 1.141 @xmath0 ) , and feh ( 1.19 , 1.21 , 1.24 @xmath0 ) @xcite , but is later influenced by ch@xmath1 absorption at 1.1 @xmath0 in the t dwarfs .",
    "the deepening and broadening of this feature and the adjacent h@xmath2o / ch@xmath1 absorption at 1.4 @xmath0 causes the j - band flux to become more peaked and narrow toward the latest objects shown .",
    "the 1.15 @xmath0 feature also depresses the 1.243 & 1.252 @xmath0 k i doublet , unresolved in the nirc data .",
    "there is significant suppression of the h- and k - band peaks between sdss 1021 - 03 and 2mass 2254 + 31 , coinciding with a large near - infrared color difference between these objects ( j - h @xmath4 0.5 mag redder in sdss 1021 - 03 ) .",

    "we have defined near - infrared spectral indices in analogy to those derived for the red optical spectra .",

    "t dwarfs are ordered as in fig .  4 , while l dwarfs are ordered by their spectral type from @xcite .",
    "aligned symbols represent multiple spectra for the same object , allowing us to estimate the approximate noise in these values , as well as compare spectra of different resolutions .",
    "there is an obvious correlation between the depth of the 1.15 @xmath0 h@xmath2o / ch@xmath1 band , the 1.3 @xmath0 ch@xmath1 band wing , and the 1.6 @xmath0 ch@xmath1 band , all of which steadily increase from the late - l dwarfs through 2mass 0415 - 09 .",
    "the k - shape index ( measuring the change of the 2.17 @xmath0 kink ) also increases toward unity ( no kink ) over this range , although with more scatter .",
    "similarly , the j / k peak ratio appears to generally increase , although there is less agreement between the nirc data and data from the literature .",
    "one object , 2mass 0937 + 29 ( see below ) is particularly discrepant .",
    "finally , the j / z peak ratio shows the least correlation with morphological order , with variations no more than 40% of the mean , suggesting noise as a possible contributor .",
    "overall , their appears to be a good correlation in the strengths of the ch@xmath1 and h@xmath2o absorption band strengths , and these are likely to be crucial features for spectral typing in the near - infrared .",
    "k i lines , unresolved in this data , are also important indicators of temperature ( being higher energy lines than the broadened 7665 & 7699  k i doublet in the red optical ) , so that classification spectra in this wavelength regime should be of sufficient resolution to permit measurement of these lines . these data can be easily obtained using existing instrumentation .",

    "this example suggests that comparison of the k - band peaks for a sample of classified t dwarfs may allow segregation by gravity ( and therefore mass ) , in analogy to the dwarf / giant segregation made in the mk luminosity classes .",
    "variations in metallicity may also play an important role in h@xmath2 strength , and the effects of cia h@xmath2 absorption at other wavelengths ( i.e. , near peaks at 0.83 and 1.25 @xmath0 ) needs to be similarly investigated .",
