    "in recent years , the multisensor estimation fusion or data fusion has received significant attention for target tracking , artificial intelligence , sensor networks and big data ( see @xcite ) , since many practical problems involve information or data from multiple sources .",
    "the problem of multisensor estimation fusion is that how to optimally fuse sensor data from multiple sensors to provide more useful and accurate information for the purpose of estimating an unknown process state @xcite .",
    "currently , the estimation fusion technology has rapidly evolved from a loosely related techniques to an emerging real engineering discipline with standardized terminology @xcite .",
    "generally speaking , there are two traditional architectures for estimation fusion , namely , centralized fusion structure and distributed fusion structure . the centralized architecture is sending the raw data of each sensor to the fusion center , theoretically , which is nothing but an estimation problem with distributed data",
    ". moreover , the centralized fusion approach can usually reach optimal linear estimation in mean squared error ( mse ) sense @xcite . however , the distributed architecture is propagating the estimation of each sensor to the fusion center , which decreases computational burden in the fusion center , but it may not get the optimal linear estimation in mse sensse . due to its important practical significance , distributed estimation fusion has been studied extensively , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .    for multisensor point estimation fusion in probabilistic setting ,",
    "many results have been obtained ( see , e.g. , books @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite provides the optimal linear estimation fusion method for a unified linear model .",
    "@xcite proves that the distributed fusion algorithm is equivalent to the optimal centralized kalman filtering in the case of cross - uncorrelated sensor noises , and the one for the case of cross - correlated sensor noises is proposed in @xcite .",
    "when there exists the limitation of communication bandwidth between a fusion center and sensors , @xcite achieves a constrained optimal estimation at the fusion center .",
    "in addition , @xcite proposes lossless linear transformation of the raw measurements of each sensor for distributed estimation fusion .",
    "most existing information fusion algorithms are based on the sequential estimation techniques such as kalman filter , information filter and the weighted least - squares methods @xcite , which need to know the accurate statistical knowledge of the process and measurement noises .    since the limitation of human and material resources in real life",
    ", we can not obtain the exact statistical characteristics of noise , which may lead to poor performance for the state estimation ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "especially for the nonlinear target tracking systems , it is more sensitive to the precise distribution information of noise . in many engineering applications ,",
    "it is easier to obtain the upper bound and lower bound of a unknown noise @xcite . in the unknown but bounded setting ,",
    "the earliest work about the set - membership filter is proposed by @xcite at the end of 1960s , and it is later developed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these robust filters are derived through set - membership estimate , usually a bounding ellipsoid of containing the true state . moreover , the set - membership filter for nonlinear dynamic system has also been investigated by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and references therein",
    ".    for multisensor set - membership fusion in bounded setting , @xcite proposes a relaxed chebyshev center covariance intersection ( ci ) algorithm to fuse the local estimates , geometrically , which is the center of the minimum radius ball enclosing the intersection of estimated ellipsoids of each sensor . in order to account for the inconsistency problem of the local estimates",
    ", @xcite proposes a covariance union method ( cu ) and it is more conservative than ci fusion .",
    "however , the judgment and calculation about correlation may be difficult .",
    "since the set - membership filter only needs to know the bound of the noises , rather than the statistical properties of noises , it does not require to judge the correlation between each sensor , which inspires us to consider set - membership information fusion .",
    "when the dynamic system is linear dynamic systems , @xcite proposes some algorithms of multisensor set - membership information fusion to minimize euclidean estimation error of the state vector .",
    "however , for nonlinear dynamic systems , the multisensor set - membership information fusion has not received enough research attention .",
    "these facts motivate us to further research the more challenging set - membership fusion problem for nonlinear dynamic systems .    in this paper ,",
    "two popular fusion architectures are considered : centralized and distributed set - membership information fusion .",
    "firstly , both of them can be converted into a semidefinite programming ( sdp ) problem which can be efficiently computed , respectively .",
    "secondly , their analytical solutions can be derived surprisingly by using decoupling technique .",
    "it is very interesting that they are quite similar in form to the classic information filter in mse sense @xcite . in the two analytical fusion formulae",
    ", the information of each sensor can be clearly characterized , and the knowledge of the correlation among measurement noises across sensors are not required .",
    "finally , multi - algorithm fusion is used to minimize the size of the state bounding ellipsoid by complementary advantages of multiple parallel algorithms .",
    "a typical numerical example in target tracking demonstrates the effectiveness of the centralized , distributed , and multi - algorithm set - membership fusion algorithms .",
    "in particular , it shows that multi - algorithm fusion performs better than both the centralized and distributed fusion .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
