    "the mass of the mesino could fall roughly in the range @xmath247 to @xmath248 gev for the interval of @xmath134 masses favored by the analysis of the bottom quark cross section .",
    "charged @xmath245-mesino signatures in @xmath0 decay include single back - to - back equal momentum tracks in the center - of - mass ; measurably lower momentum than lepton pairs ; an angular distribution consistent with the decay of a state of spin @xmath249 into two fermions ; and ionization , time - of - flight , and cherenkov signatures typical of a particle whose mass is heavier than that of a proton . on the other hand , possible baryon - number - violating r - parity - violating decays of the bottom squark lead to @xmath250 , @xmath251 , and @xmath252 final states .",
    "these final states of four light quarks may be indistinguishable from conventional hadronic final states mediated by the two - gluon intermediate state . since the bottom squark decay mode is predicted to be substantial for @xmath1 s ,",
    "decays of the @xmath1 primarily via the @xmath246 possibility would offer an excellent opportunity to observe bottom squarks or to place significant limits on their possible masses .    we acknowledge valuable conversations with geoff bodwin , zack sullivan , and tim tait . work in the high energy physics division at argonne national laboratory is supported by the u.  s.  department of energy , division of high energy physics , under contract no .",
