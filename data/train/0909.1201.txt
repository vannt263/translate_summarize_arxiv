    "there are many different notions of a stratified space .",

    "this makes them ideal for studying the topology of stratified spaces .",
    "two such tools for studying that topology are holinks and popath spaces .",
    "the popaths between two strata are any paths which travel from one stratum to the other passing only from ",
    "lower strata to higher strata \" . on the other hand the holink between two strata",
    "consists only of popaths which instantly leave one stratum for the other .",
    "popaths are very useful in obtaining a categorical view of stratified spaces .",
    "however for a space with many strata the space of popaths between two strata could be difficult to compute or visualize .",
    "the holink between two strata only depends on the two strata involved and with this in mind is easier to deal with , but problems may arises because holink paths ca nt be composed .",
    "therefore a result connecting these concepts becomes desirable .",

    "it may seem strange to require a result which is stronger than just the inclusion being a homotopy equivalence , but exactly this result has already found a relevance in the work of jon woolf @xcite and seems to be required to construct a particular map to prove that a stratified space can be reconstructed from its popath category ( the author hopes to show this in the near future ) .",
