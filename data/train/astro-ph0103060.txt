    "since the process of the generation of neutron star ( ns ) magnetic fields ( mfs ) and , hence , their initial structure , strength and localization is still under discussion , we here intend to investigate the evolution of ns mfs which penetrate the entire star",
    ". though there are arguments that the ns mf may be confined to the crustal layer , where it has been generated by thermoelectric effects during the early hot period of the ns s life when the temperature gradients in the crust are immense ( blandford , applegate & hernquist 1983 ; urpin , levshakov & yakovlev 1986 ; wiebicke & geppert 1996 ) , one has also to consider the possibility that the ns mf permeates both the crust and the core of the star .",
    "this could be the field structure from the very beginning of the ns s life , either according to the simple model of flux conservation during the collapse or due to a very efficient dynamo action in the core of the proto  ns as described by thompson & duncan ( 1993 ) .",
    "+ in a recent paper ( konenkov & geppert 2000 , hereafter kg00 ) we considered the flux expulsion from the superfluid core of a ns . since the transition from the normal to the superfluid state of the matter in the cores of nss may occur rather early after the ns s birth ( page 1998 ) , we assumed that the protons in the core form a superconductor of type ii ( baym , pethick & pines 1969 ) and the magnetic flux is concentrated in an array of proton flux tubes ( fluxoids ) .",
    "there are several forces acting on to the fluxoids ( for details see sec .",
    "2 ) , driving them outward into the normal conductive crust of a ns , where the magnetic flux may decay ohmically . considering an initial field structure where the mf at the surface and in the core has the same strength , we showed that the field evolution in the crust leads to a deceleration of the flux expulsion which is the more pronounced the stronger the initial surface mf is .",
    "it turned out , that the main force , which is responsible for the flux expulsion from the core , is the buoyancy force .",
    "+ we have also confirmed the result of ding , cheng & chau 1993 ( hereafter dcc ) , that not the entire magnetic flux is expelled from the core , but a certain part of it remains there for eternity .",
    "this results in a nonvanishing residual field @xmath0 , which can be in the range of @xmath1 g , depending on the model parameters . + it is well known that the equation of state ( eos ) , which describes the state of matter in the core region of the ns , has a crucial influence on the crustal mf decay in isolated nss ( urpin & konenkov 1997 ; page , geppert & zannias 2000 ) .",
    "the eos determines the compactness of the ns and , hence , the scale length of the mf in the crust , as well as the cooling history of the ns . while a softer eos causes an smaller scale which , in turn , leads to a more rapid field decay , a softening of the eos decelerates also the cooling . in a warmer crust",
    "the mf will be dissipated faster too . since the eos influences also - via the moment of inertia - the spin  down which is one important process for the core flux expulsion",
    ", we will consider in this paper the field evolution for nss modelled with three different eos , covering the whole range from very stiff to soft ones .",
    "+ however , the assumption that the field strengths at the ns s surface and in its core are initially of the same order of magnitude is not the only conceivable one .",
    "there are good reasons to assume that the field strengths at these positions differ considerably .",
    "this could be , e.g. , a consequence of a field amplification during the collapse by flux conservation which results in a flux permeating the whole star with , say , @xmath2 g and a very efficient field generation after the formation of the ns by the thermoelectric instability in the crustal layers , producing there , say , @xmath3 g. thus , we want to investigate here the effect of different initial ratios @xmath4 , that is , initial magnetic configurations , for which the crust contains the bulk of the magnetic flux and only a tiny fraction of it is anchored in the core . +",
    "another process which determines the initial mf structure in the new  born ns is the post core",
    " collaps accretion of fall  back matter after the supernova explosion .",
    "if this accretion is hypercritical the ram pressure overwhelms the pressure of a possibly existent mf and submerges it .",
    "the depth of submergence depends on the total amount of accreted matter and on the eos of the ns matter ( for details see geppert , page & zannias 1999 ) .",
    "given the parameters as estimated for sn 1987a ( chevalier 1989 ) , a mf generated by dynamo action in the proto  ns or amplified simply by flux conservation during the collaps would be submerged down to the crust  core boundary or even into the core .",
    "the rediffusion of that submerged mf would last at least @xmath5 years , thus , the ns born in sn 1987a will not appear as a pulsar in the near future , unless field generation processes in the crust will transform thermal into magnetic energy relatively fast . however ,",
    "also fall  back much weaker than observed in sn 1987a will cause a certain submergence and , hence , a delayed switching on of pulsars ( muslimov & page 1995 ) . the discrepancy between the real age ( @xmath6 years ) and active age ( @xmath7 years ) of the pulsar b1757 - 24 ( gaensler & frail 2000 )",
    "can be explained at least partly by the assumption that the mf of this pulsar was submerged and rediffused during @xmath8 years ( see sec .",
    "3 ) . generally ,",
    "if there was initially some field generation in the whole ns , the post  supernova accretion onto the new born ns will lead to a field structure with @xmath9 , i.e. to a field structure having a much weaker mf strength at the surface than in the core .",
    "it is our aim to consider here the effect of different submergence depths onto the flux expulsion from the core and its consequences for the early ns evolution .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we give a short description of the model .",
    "it will be based on the model of the interplay of forces that determine the flux expulsion from the ns s core presented in detail in kg00 .",
    "the numerical results for the different initial field structures are presented in section 3 and section 4 is devoted to the discussion and conclusions .",
    "we calculate the velocity of the flux carrying proton tubes ( fluxoids ) using the model described in detail in kg00 .",
    "namely , fluxoids are supposed not to be rigidly tied with the neutron vortices ( srinivasan et al . 1990 , jahan - miri & bhattacharya 1994 ) , but to move under the common action of the buoyancy force , the drag force and the force exerted by the neutron vortices .",
    "+ the superfluid core participates in the rotation of the ns by forming an array of quantized neutron vortices .",
    "the radial velocity of vortices at the crust - core boundary is determined by @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the averaged angular velocity of the core superfluid , @xmath12 is the radius of the ns core . in this paper",
    "we consider the evolution of isolated nss .",
    "we assume , that the rotational evolution is determined by energy losses due to magneto ",

    "the buoyancy force , acting on the unit length of a fluxoid , is given by ( muslimov , tsygan 1985 ) : @xmath18 where @xmath19 g @xmath20 is the quantum of the magnetic flux , @xmath21 is the london penetration depth , and @xmath22 is the proton coherence length , which is less than @xmath23 for a superconductor of type ii . the buoyancy force is always positive , i.e. directed outward .",
    "the drag force per unit length of a fluxoid , resulting from the interaction of the normal electrons in the core with the magnetic field of a fluxoid ( harvey , ruderman , shaham 1986 , jones 1987 ) , is given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the number density of electrons in the core , which is assumed to be about 5% of the number density of neutrons , @xmath26 is the elementary charge , @xmath27 the fermi energy of the electrons , and @xmath28 is the velocity of fluxoid . for the fermi energy and electron number density",
    "we take the values determined by the density at the crust  core interface , @xmath29g/@xmath30 . when @xmath31 ( fluxoids are moving outward ) , one has @xmath32",
    ", i.e. @xmath33 hampers the expulsion of the flux from the core of ns .",
    "the force , acting on the unit length of a fluxoid exerted by the neutron vortices , is given by ( dcc ) @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the lag between the rotational velocity of the core superfluid , @xmath11 , and the rotational velocity of both the crust and the charged component of the core , @xmath36 , while @xmath37 denotes the averaged core magnetic field .",
    "the observed spin period @xmath38 of a ns is related to @xmath36 by @xmath39 .",
    "the maximum lag @xmath40 , which can be sustained by the pinning force , defines also the maximum force , which can be exerted by the vortices on to the fluxoids ( see dcc and jahan  miri 2000 for a more detailed discussion ) . according to dcc , @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the fractional concentration of protons , @xmath43 is a numerical factor of order of the unity",

    "we assume hereafter @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52    vortices can either move outward faster than fluxoids ( forward creeping , @xmath53 ) , or the velocities of both kinds of flux tubes can coincide ( comoving,@xmath54 ) , or neutron vortices can move slower than fluxoids ( reverse creeping , @xmath55 )",
    ". the vortex acting force can be both positive or negative , depending on the sign of @xmath56 , i.e. @xmath57 can either promote the expulsion or impede it .",
    "the sum of the powers of the forces , acting onto the fluxoids in the core , is equal to the poynting flux through the surface of the ns core : @xmath58   \\cdot d\\vec{s}_{core } , \\label{main_eq}\\ ] ] where the summation runs over all fluxoids .",

    "is taken over the length of each fluxoid , while the integral on the r.h.s .",
    "of ( [ main_eq ] ) is performed over the surface of the core ; the normal vector of this surface is directed into the core .",
    "we consider the evolution of a poloidal field , which is supposed to be dipolar outside the ns .",

    "of the equation ( [ main_eq ] ) can be rewritten as : @xmath68                             \\cdot              d\\vec{s}_{core } =   \\frac { b_{p0}^2 r_c^2}{6 } \\frac{\\partial s(r_c , t ) } { \\partial t } \\frac{\\partial s(r_c , t ) } { \\partial r}.\\ ] ]    assuming the mf in the core to be uniform , one can introduce the total core forces @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the mean length of the fluxoid and @xmath71 is the number of fluxoids .",
    "it is worth mentioning that @xmath72 both in the forward and in the reverse creeping regimes , but @xmath73 .",
    "one can now introduce the crustal force @xmath74 when @xmath75 is positive and @xmath76 is negative the crustal force is negative , i.e. it prevents the roots of the fluxoids to move towards the magnetic equator .",
    "the crustal force is proportional to @xmath77 .",
    "now one can rewrite equation ( [ main_eq ] ) as : @xmath78 which determines the velocity of fluxoid @xmath28 .",

    "therefore , the crustal force determined by the equation ( [ f_c_eq ] ) coincides with the crustal force determined by the equation ( 8) from kg00 , however , a smoother numerical procedure can is achieved with the recent version .",
    "+        the evolution of the magnetic field in the solid crust is governed by the induction equation without a convective term : @xmath80 it can be rewritten in terms of the stokes stream function as : @xmath81 and should be supplemented by the boundary conditions at the surface ( @xmath82 ) and at the crust - core boundary ( @xmath83 ) . while the outer boundary condition is given by @xmath84 at @xmath82 , the inner one is time - dependent and determined by equation ( [ forces_eq ] ) .",
    "the conductivity in the regions of interest in the crust is determined by the scattering of electrons at impurities and phonons .",
    "the phonon conductivity is dependent on the temperature , and , hence , on the cooling history of the ns .",
    "the impurity conductivity is temperature independent and is determined by the concentration of the impurities @xmath85 .",
    "the relaxation times for both electron scattering processes depend strongly on the density and on the chemical composition of the crust . for the phonon conductivity we use the numerical data given by itoh et al .",
    "1993 , for the impurity conductivity we apply the analytical expression derived by yakovlev & urpin 1980 .",
    "+ the evolution of the magnetic field in the superconducting core is driven only by the motions of the fluxoids : @xmath86 this equation can be rewritten in terms of the normalized stream function @xmath67 by : @xmath87 the assumption of the homogeneity of the magnetic field in the core leads to the following ansatz for the fluxoid velocity @xmath88 and for @xmath64 in the core @xmath89 with this , the solution of equation ( [ simpl_conv ] ) describes the evolution of the core mf at the crust  core boundary as @xmath90 note , that in equations  ( 15 ) and ( 17 ) of kg00 there are two misprints .",
    "however , the numerical computation was based on the correct equations .",
    "we use the procedure described in kg00 to find the velocity of the fluxoids and , consequently , the magnetic and rotational evolution of ns . +",
    "although the induction equation is linear , the problem , as shown in section 2 , is a nonlinear one in terms of the magnetic field , and has a time and field dependent boundary condition at the crust  core interface . additionally , equation  ( [ forces_eq ] ) which determines the flux expulsion velocity is nonlinear in @xmath28 too . for the calculations described below we use the standard cooling scenario considered by van riper ( 1991 ) for the neutron star model based on a stiff ( pandharipande & smith 1975 ) , medium ( friedman  pandharipande 1981 ) and a soft ( baym , pethick & sutherland 1971 ) eos .",
    "the cooling histories for those eos are taken from van riper ( 1991 ) .",
    "+ the main influence of the choice of the eos on to the mf evolution comes via the different density profiles which determine the scale lengths of the mf in the corresponding ns models .",
    "+ in all our model calculations we apply the initial rotational period @xmath91 s , a value which is generally accepted for new  born nss .      in order to extract the effects of different eos on to the flux expulsion from the ns s core we apply for all models the initial surface and core magnetic field strengths @xmath92 g , an impurity parameter @xmath93 and the standard cooling scenario .",
    "+ we consider three qualitatively different eos and use the corresponding density profiles calculated for a @xmath94 ns ( for details see urpin & konenkov ( 1997 ) and references therein ) .",
    "the soft eos is represented by the bps model with a radius of @xmath95 km and a crust thickness of @xmath96 m .",
    "the corresponding values for the medium ( fp model ) and stiff ( ps model ) eos are @xmath97 km , @xmath98 m , and @xmath99 km , @xmath100 m , respectively .",
    "the effect of increasing stiffness of the eos describing the state of the core matter is at least threefold : i ) since @xmath101 the increasing radius of the ns @xmath15 leads to a more efficient spin ",
    "down for a given surface mf @xmath14 and ns mass @xmath102 ; ii ) the larger scale of the mf and iii ) the faster cooling of the ns cause a deceleration of the crustal field decay .",
    "+ in figure  1 we show the evolution ( from top to bottom ) of the mf , velocities of vortices and fluxoids , forces and rotational periods of ns models based on a very soft ( bps ) and a very stiff ( ps ) eos . as in the case of the medium fp eos ( see kg00 ) , at the beginning the dominating expulsive force is @xmath103 .",
    "this is because in the core of the magnetized and rapidly spinning ns there exists a large number of fastly outward moving neutron vortices , which act on the fluxoids .",
    "as shown in the third panel of figure  1 , during that relatively short early period of @xmath104 years , @xmath103 is balanced by @xmath105 , while the other forces in eq.([forces_eq ] ) are negligible . however , because of the preceding ns spindown , the number of vortices in the core ( and , hence , @xmath103 ) decreases , and @xmath106 becomes the main force , which drives the fluxoids outward .",
    "in kg00 we have shown , that in case of an intermediate eos , the timescale of the expulsion of the magnetic field from the core @xmath107 is determined by the balance of @xmath106 and @xmath108 .",
    "one can see that , although @xmath106 and @xmath108 are still the dominant forces governing the expulsion timescale both for nss with stiff and soft eos , in the case of the bps model one can not neglect @xmath103 in the balance of forces .",
    "nss with softer eos spin down slower than nss with stiffer eos . in @xmath45 years",
    "a ns with the soft eos spins down to only 0.19 s , while a ns with the stiff eos spins down up to 1.26 s. thus , @xmath103 , which is proportional to the number of vortices , i.e. inversely proportional to the spin period of the ns , plays a more important role in the dynamics of fluxoids for nss with a soft eos .",
    "the evolution of their surface mf follows closely the core field decrease , because the diffusion timescale of the crustal currents is smaller than the expulsion timescale of the core field .",
    "the expulsion of the flux in case of the bps model stops at about @xmath109 years , leaving behind a residual field @xmath110 g , since then the vortex acting force balances @xmath106 and prevents further expulsion .",
    "therefore , the slight spindown results in a relatively short residual spin period @xmath111 s and a high strength of the residual mf .",
    "+ in the case of a ns model with a stiff eos , the expulsion timescale appears to be much shorter than the dissipation timescale of the field in the thick crust .",
    "when the mf in the core has been reduced by @xmath112 orders of magnitude ( after @xmath113 years ) , the surface field is still @xmath114 g. thus , the evolution of the surface mf in nss with stiff eos is insensitive to the details of the physics of the superfluid core ( but , of course , is sensitive indirectly via the cooling history of ns which is extremely sensitive to the occurrence of superfluidity ) . in order to check the sensitivity of the results with respect to another _ a priori _ unknown parameter of our models",
    ", we varied @xmath85 in the range @xmath115 and found , that the surface mf begins to decay for any @xmath85 when the core flux is almost completely expelled .",
    "+ since the ns with stiffening of the eos spins down more effectively ( because of the larger radius and the longer decay  timescale of the surface mf ) , at the end of the evolution a smaller number of neutron vortices remains in the core which can hold there only a smaller number of fluxoids than in case of a softer eos ns model .",
    "thus , the residual field becomes weaker with stiffening of the eos .",
    "+       in the crust ( @xmath117 ) .",
    "lines marked by 1 , 2 , 3 correspond to @xmath118 and @xmath2 g , respectively .",
    "the @xmath119 corresponds to the density @xmath120 .",
    ", width=302 ]            there exist some observational and theoretical evidences that the initial core field might be weaker than the surface one .",
    "thus , chau , cheng & ding ( 1992 ) concluded from an analysis of glitch observations in the vela pulsar that the mf at the crust  core boundary is in the order of @xmath121 g while the surface mf is about three to four orders of magnitude larger .",
    "such a difference in the field strengths at the surface and at the crust  core boundary could be produced by the thermoelectric instability ( blandford , applegate & hernquist 1983 , urpin , levshakov & yakovlev 1986 , wiebicke & geppert 1996 ) , which may transform thermal into magnetic energy effectively during the very early period of ns s life in its outermost crustal layers .",
    "+ in figure  2 we show the initial field configurations in terms of the stoke s stream function @xmath122 for @xmath123 g and @xmath124 and @xmath125 g. the calculations have been performed for an initial period @xmath91 s , an impurity parameter @xmath93 and an initial density where the crustal field matches the inner one , @xmath126 g @xmath127 . in order to show clearly the effect of different @xmath128 , we will not vary @xmath85 and @xmath129 as well as present the results for the medium fp eos and standard cooling only .",
    "+ we show in figure  3 the evolution of the field components , of the forces acting on to the fluxoids in the core , of the velocities of both the fluxoids @xmath28 and of the neutron vortices @xmath130 , and the rotational evolution in terms of the rotational period @xmath131 .",
    "+ since @xmath132 , @xmath73 , but @xmath133 , a relative decrease of the field strength in the core reduces @xmath108 , @xmath106 and @xmath105 much faster than @xmath103 , thereby enforcing the role the vortices play for the dynamics of the fluxoids for the weaker @xmath37 . as seen from the third panels of figure  3 apart from the early stages of evolution ( @xmath134 years ) the fluxoids are completely in the comoving regime , and their motion is totally determined by those of the neutron vortices , and the velocity of fluxoids at @xmath135 is the greater , the smaller @xmath136 is .",
    "consequently , a mf configuration with @xmath137 results in a `` spin  down induced '' flux expulsion as described by jahan - miri & bhattacharya ( 1994 ) for accreting nss , and the influence of the crustal force on the dynamics of fluxoids is negligible .",
    "+ the decay of the surface mf almost fully coincides with that in case of the purely crustal magnetic configurations ( urpin & konenkov 1997 , page et al . 2000 ) . only in the case of @xmath138 g ,",
    "the value of @xmath14 during the plateau phase at @xmath139 years is slightly higher than in the case of @xmath140 or even @xmath141 g. however , the most remarkable difference is that the surface mf decays not down to zero , but to a nonzero residual value .",
    "since @xmath142 after @xmath143 years the ceasing of the spin  down of the ns , when @xmath14 has been decayed down to the weak @xmath37 , results in a ceasing of the further field expulsion from the core .",
    "thus , in the case of @xmath118 and @xmath141 g , @xmath144 and @xmath145 g , respectively . + it is worth mentioning that the choice of a stiffer eos leads to a more extended phase of forward creeping . for such stiff eos and relatively strong core fields ( @xmath146 ) after about @xmath5 years even the reverse creeping stage can be entered .",
    "+      a possible explanation for the discrepancy between the estimated rates of supernovae and of pulsar births in the galaxy ( frail 1998 ) is the delayed switch  on of a pulsar .",
    "this feature has been discussed by muslimov & page ( 1995 ) , who considered a relatively shallow submergence of the initially present mf .",
    "however , the immediate consequence of a supernova ( type ib or ii ) explosion will be a fall back of matter on to the new born ns ( colpi , shapiro & wasserman , 1996 ) . in case this fall back accretion is hypercritical the ram pressure of the back  falling matter is larger than the pressure of a , say , @xmath3 g initially present mf and the accretion flow is purely hydrodynamic ; conditions as could be estimated for the sn 1987a ( see chevalier 1989 ) . applying the time dependence of the fall back accretion rates given by colpi et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , geppert , page & zannias ( 1999 ) calculated the submergence of a ns mf for different eos as a function of the total amount of accreted matter @xmath147 .",
    "it became clear that for values as inferable for sn 1987a ( chevalier 1989 ) the mf has been submerged so deeply that the created ns will not shine up as a radiopulsar for more than @xmath5 years .",
    "+ when the fall back accretion ceases the submerged field will start the rediffusion towards the surface of the ns .",
    "once the ns is an isolated one during all its life , for given conductive properties of the layers above the field maintaining electrical currents and a given eos determining the cooling and the scalelength of the field , the submergence density @xmath148 down to which the mf has been buried by fall back accretion is the only parameter which defines the duration of that rediffusion process @xmath149 .",
    "evidently , the larger @xmath147 the larger @xmath148 and , hence , the larger @xmath149 . + in order to show clearly the effect of the different @xmath148 we will use the same representation as in the preceding section for the medium eos with @xmath93 . in that way figure  4 shows the evolution of the ns for @xmath150 , and @xmath151 g @xmath127 , which corresponds roughly to an total amount of accreted matter of about @xmath152 , and @xmath153 , respectively .",
    "+ the process of flux expulsion from a ns with initially submerged mf is qualitatively different from that of a standard ns .",
    "since at the beginning of the ns s life , after the fall back has finished , the surface mf @xmath65 is practically zero , there is no spin  down and , hence , the velocity of the vortices @xmath130 is zero too .",
    "thus , the neutron vortices , because being fixed in number and location , will not force the fluxoids to move outward , but will impede them to be expelled by the buoyancy force .",
    "the immobility of the fluxoids and the initial smallness of the crustal forces results in a situation where the balance of forces is given only by @xmath154 , where the vortex acting force @xmath103 is just compensating the buoyancy , while @xmath105 and @xmath108 are many orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath103 , @xmath106 .",
    "+ when the field would remain buried there were no chance to expell the core flux because the number of vortices remains constant in a stationary rotating ns .",
    "however , depending on @xmath148 the submerged crustal field rediffuses towards the surface thereby causing an increasing braking of ns s rotation . as shown in figure  4 that the spin  down onsets",
    "the later the deeper the crustal field has been submerged . the initially immobile neutron vortices start to move outward and the proton fluxoids , tightly bounded to them by @xmath106 follow their motion towards the crust , i.e. the fluxoids are in the comoving state . with increasing @xmath28 the drag force @xmath105 rises and ,",
    "since the crustal force is still negligible , the balance of forces is determined by @xmath155 . during that early epoch",
    "the core field does not change which results in a constant and positive @xmath106 . since ,",
    "on the other hand both @xmath105 and @xmath103 are negative , the increasing absolute value of drag force reduces the absolute value of the vortex acting force . by the vertical line with mark",

    "exactly at that moment there is no interaction between the fluxoids and the vortices and the balance of forces is given by @xmath162 .",
    "+ however , the rediffusion of the crustal field continues beyond @xmath163 and the velocity @xmath130 ( and hence @xmath28 ) increases too .",
    "the change in the sign of @xmath103 reflects the change in the state of flux expulsion : while early on the vortices hampered the movement of the fluxoids , now the positive @xmath103 supports the flux expulsion , though it is still @xmath164 .",

    "the fluxoids can no longer follow the motion of the vortices , which cut now through the fluxoids , hence , the forward creeping regime has been reached .",
    "close to this moment , the crustal force becomes comparable to @xmath106 , however , both are small in comparison with @xmath103 and @xmath105 .",
    "later on , when the surface mf @xmath14 becomes comparable to the core field @xmath37 , the transition from a `` submerged '' to a `` standard '' field configuration has been performed .",
    "the velocity of fluxoids is no longer determined by @xmath103 and @xmath105 , but instead by @xmath169 and @xmath170 , a situation which is the same as described in kg00 and the evolution goes through the phases of the forward creeping , the comoving , and the reverse creeping regime .",
    "it turns out , that the long  term magnetic and rotational evolution does not depend crucially on @xmath148 ; it affects mainly the ns behaviour in its early life and may lead to the phenomenon that a young ns is recognized to be an old one because its active age , @xmath171 , is apparently high .",
    "however , especially for very deep submergence of the field , the pulsar may also turn to look younger than its real age when the rediffusion progresses ( see geppert et al 1999 ) .",
    "the rediffusion of the initially submerged mf may lead to some interesting metamorphoses of ages of nss : the young nss look older or younger than they really are .",
    "for example , from the magnetic evolution of the ns at the right panel of figure 4 , one can estimate at @xmath172 years an active age of about @xmath173 years , and a braking index @xmath174 .",
    "the pulsar b1757 - 24 in snr g5.4 - 1.2 has an active age of @xmath175 years and a braking index @xmath176 , while its real age was estimated from the morphology of the snr to be @xmath177 years ( gaensler & frail 2000 ) .",
    "obviously , the assumption of mf submergence in nss can at least partly explain the discrepancy between true and active age , and the occurence of a small braking index for this pulsar ( muslimov & page 1995 ) . + the other process which generates a strong surface field after the ns s birth , the thermoelectric instability , may not account for those apparent discrepancies in the ages , because this instability acts effectively at most during the first few thousand years of the ns s life .",
    "+ note however , that with increasing @xmath148 , @xmath0 increases while @xmath178 decreases .",
    "an increase of @xmath148 from @xmath3 g @xmath127 to @xmath151g@xmath127 causes an increase of @xmath0 by a factor of @xmath179 and decreases @xmath178 by a factor of @xmath180 .",
    "this can be understood from the fact that for larger @xmath148 the spin  down",
    "starts later . during that longer period a small amount of core flux has been expelled and dissipated in the inner crust as well as the ns cooled down , thereby enhancing the conductivity in the surface layers which decelerates the rediffusion .",
    "thus , in the process of rediffusion the surface mf can not reach the same high value as for the corresponding case with shallow submergence . therefore , the spin  down in case of the deep submerged mf is less efficient , @xmath178 is smaller , which reduces the efficiency of the flux expulsion from the core , resulting eventually in a larger @xmath0 .",
    "+      ) for the soft and the stiff eos",
    ". the maximum stresses , given by equation  ( [ s_max ] ) for @xmath181 dyn/@xmath20 and @xmath182 , are shown as horizontal lines.,width=302 ]    in this paper the crust of the ns is assumed to be solid and not deformed by maxwell ( and others ) stresses , i.e. the crustal mf evolves only through ohmic dissipation and does not affect the elastic properties of the crust .",
    "the opposite case was considered by ruderman ( 1991a , b ) and ruderman , zhu and chen ( 1998 ) , who investigated the consequences of the changing core mf configuration for the spin history , especially glitches . moving the roots of the fluxoids at the crust  core interface , crustal strains are built up and relaxed by large  scale crust  cracking events . from our calculations we can estimate the shear stress at the crust  core boundary .",
    "the total force , acting upon the crust by the expelled flux is balanced by the force , acting from the crust on the fluxoids , i.e. @xmath169 . the maximum of @xmath183 is reached at that stage of evolution , when the balance of @xmath106 and @xmath108 determines the velocity of fluxoids .",
    "it seems to be a rather common situation , that the maximum force , which acts on the crust , does not exceed greatly the buoyancy force , which acts on the fluxoids from the beginning of the ns evolution .",
    "this force is about @xmath184 dyn , as one can see from figure  1 , for @xmath185 g. the shear stress exerted at the base of the crust is given by    @xmath186    where @xmath187 is the thickness of the crust and @xmath188 is evaluated by use of equation ( [ f_c_eq ] ) . in figure  5 we compare @xmath189 , calculated for @xmath185 g and @xmath93 , with the maximum shear stress the crust can sustain before yielding , as estimated by ( ruderman 1991a ) ,    @xmath190    where @xmath191 is the elastic strain limit , @xmath192 for a @xmath193 years old ns , and @xmath194 dyn @xmath195 is the shear modulus of the crust .",
    "it is seen that the shear stresses reach their maximum after @xmath196 years and become negligible when the magnetic flux is expelled from the core .",
    "clearly , the probability for crust  cracking increases with a softening of the eos .",
    "therefore , while for nss with a soft eos early crust ",
    "cracking events , as glitches , may occur , their appearance in young ( @xmath197 yrs ) nss with stiffer eos hints to an initial field strength larger than @xmath198 g and/or to a smaller yield strain ( @xmath199 ) of the young ns crust .",
    "in order to investigate the magnetic and rotational evolution of isolated nss whose mf penetrates both its core and crust , we solved the system of equations which describe the expulsion of the mf from the superfluid core and its subsequent ohmic dissipation in the solid crust .",
    "thereby we assumed that the spin ",
    "down is driven by magneto ",
    "dipole radiation .",
    "+ in a recent paper ( kg00 ) we considered this process for a ns whose state of matter is described by a medium eos and discussed the effects of different initial field strengths and impurity concentrations in the crust . for initial field strengths larger than @xmath3 g , our study yielded a decay time for the surface field @xmath200 years . in the present paper we considered the effect of different eos on the mf evolution and its consequences .",
    "we studied also qualitatively different initial mf structures .",
    "+ in the case of a configuration , where the initial mf strengths at the surface and in the core are of the same order of magnitude ( modelled in this paper by @xmath201 ) we have found , that the main force , which drives the fluxoids outward , is the buoyancy force @xmath106 .",
    "the expulsion timescale is determined by the balance of @xmath106 and @xmath108 , which depend mainly on the core field strength and on the crustal conductivity , and is not affected by the spin history of the ns .",
    "the surprising result is that the expulsion timescale depends only weakly on the eos . since stiffer eos results in a thicker crust",
    ", one would expect , that @xmath108 , which depends on the rate of dissipation of crustal currents , counteracts the expulsion of the magnetic flux from the core of a ns with the stiffer eos for a longer time .",
    "however , the total core forces are proportional to @xmath202 ( see eq .",
    "( [ f_eq ] ) ) , i.e. , the total buoyancy force is about @xmath203 times stronger for the ps - model than for the bps model .",
    "the interplay of these effects results in rather similar flux expulsion timescales for different eos .",
    "+ however , the evolution of the observable surface mf differs substantially for soft and stiff eos . for the soft bps and medium fp ( see kg00 ) eos the diffusion timescale of the crustal field appears to be much shorter than the core flux expulsion timescale .",
    "thus , the evolution of the surface and core mfs are tightly connected . moreover , for the soft and the medium eos the decay timescale of the surface mf depends on its initial strength . in the case of the thick crust as modelled by the ns with the ps eos we have found , that the diffusion of the crustal field lasts longer than the expulsion of the core field by approximately two orders of magnitude .",
    "that means , in case of a stiff eos the surface field evolution is not sensitive to the details of physics of the forces acting upon the fluxoids in the core , and does not depend strongly on the initial mf strength .",
    "hence , for a stiff eos the evolution of the surface mf coincides with that , considered by konar & bhattacharya ( 1999 ) , for an initially expelled flux .",
    "this result is valid for initial surface mfs in the range of @xmath204 g , and for impurity parameters in the range of @xmath205 .",
    "+ it is generally accepted that the mf of normal radiopulsars decays weakly during their lifetime ( bhattacharya et al .",
    "1992 , hartman et al .",
    "unfortunately , the results obtained from our scenario of field evolution do not allow to select or to reject some eos as being not in accordance with observational facts .",
    "all models lead to decay timescales of the surface field comparable or exceeding the radiopulsars lifetime . + as in the case of the medium eos ( see kg00 ) , not the entire magnetic flux is expelled from the core , but some part remains there for eternity , resulting in a residual mf of nss .",
    "this can be important for the explanation of the long - living mfs of millisecond pulsars .",
    "however , for those nss a more complex analysis is required , which takes into account all the effects of accretion occuring in binary systems .",
    "+ for a `` crustal '' mf configuration , when initially almost the whole magnetic flux is confined to the ns s crust , we have found that the neutron vortices play a very important role for the dynamics of the fluxoids .",
    "the velocity of the fluxoids appears to be equal to that of the vortices during almost the whole evolution , so that the flux expulsion can be really called `` spin  down induced''(srinivasan et al .",
    "1990 , jahan miri & bhattacharya 1994 ) .",
    "however , the evolution of the surface mf coincides almost completely with that of a purely crustal field as considered by urpin & konenkov ( 1997 ) , and page et al .",
    "correspondingly , all conclusions of those papers are applicable to this magnetic configuration , namely the conclusion , that models of nss , based on the medium and stiff eos with standard cooling yield a satisfactory agreement with observations .",
    "+ for a ns with an initially submerged crustal field we found that the submergence affects the evolution only during the early periods of the ns s life , as long as the crustal field is diffusing back to the surface .",
    "then , the further magnetic and rotational evolution of the ns becomes similar to the `` standard '' evolution as described in kg00 .",
    "the only reminder of the submergence episode is the relatively weak correlation of the residual field strength with the submergence depth and its anti  correlation with the final rotational period .",
    "+ we also calculated the shear stresses at the bottom of the crust , which arise when the footpoints of the fluxoids are moved along the crust  core interface .",
    "we found that total force , which acts on the crust from the moved fluxoids ( being equal to the force , which acts from the crust on to the fluxoids , i.e. @xmath108 ) , does not exceed strongly the buoyancy force , which acts onto the fluxoids from the very beginning of the evolution .",
    "it can be strong enough to break the crust , especially when a soft eos decribes the state of the core matter and the crust is relatively thin .",
