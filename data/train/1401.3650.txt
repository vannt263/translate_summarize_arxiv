    "the miniboone collaboration at fermilab has reported measurements of the neutral - current elastic ( nce ) flux - averaged differential neutrino @xcite and , more recently , antineutrino @xcite cross sections on ch@xmath0 as a function of the four - momentum transferred squared @xmath1 .",
    "measurements of the neutrino and antineutrino charged - current quasielastic ( ccqe ) cross sections on carbon have also been reported in @xcite . at the few gev energy region considered in the miniboone",
    "experiments theoretical models based on the impulse approximation ( ia ) are usually unable to reproduce the experimental cross sections @xcite unless calculations are performed with a value of the nucleon axial mass @xmath2 significantly larger ( @xmath3 gev/@xmath4 ) than the world average value from the deuterium data of @xmath5 gev/@xmath4  @xcite .",
    "this has been viewed as an indication that the reaction can have significant contributions from effects beyond the ia .",
    "a careful analysis of all nuclear effects and of the relevance of multinucleon emission and of some non - nucleonic contributions is required for a deeper understanding of the reaction dynamics @xcite .",
    "models developed for quasielastic ( qe ) electron scattering  @xcite and able to successfully describe electron scattering data can provide a useful tool to study neutrino - induced reactions .",
    "a reliable description of the effects of final - state interactions ( fsi ) between the ejected nucleon and the residual nucleus is very important for the comparison with data  @xcite .",
    "the relevance of fsi has been cleary stated in the case of the exclusive reaction within the distorted - wave impulse approximation ( dwia ) , where the use of a complex optical potential ( op ) whose imaginary part produces an absorption that reduces the calculated cross section is essential to reproduce the data . in the case of the inclusive @xmath6 reaction , as well as of ccqe and nce neutrino scattering ,",
    "the use of the dwia with an absorptive complex op is not correct and different approaches have been adopted . in the relativistic plane - wave impulse approximation ( rpwia )",
    "fsi are neglected . in other approaches based on the ia fsi",
    "are incorporated in the final nucleon state either retaining only the real part of the relativistic optical potential ( rrop ) , or using the same relativistic mean field potential considered in describing the initial nucleon state ( rmf ) @xcite .    in the relativistic green s function ( rgf )",
    "model the components of the nuclear response are written in terms of matrix elements of the same type as the dwia ones of the exclusive process , but involve eigenfunctions of the op and of its hermitian conjugate , where the imaginary part has an opposite sign and gives in one case an absorption and in the other case a gain of strength .",
    "a detailed description of the model can be found in our previous work @xcite .    in @xcite",
    "we have already discussed the results of different relativistic descriptions of fsi for nce scattering averaged over the @xmath7 and @xmath8 miniboone flux .",
    "we note that the rgf is appropriate for an inclusive process like ccqe , whereas the nce scattering is a semi - inclusive process where the final neutrino can not be detected and only the final nucleon is measured . as a consequence , the rgf may include channels which are not present in the experimental nce measurements , but it can also recover important contributions which are not taken into account by other models based on the ia . in comparison with the miniboone nce neutrino scattering data ,",
    "the dwia and rmf generally underpredict the experimental cross section , while the rgf results are in reasonable agreement with the data . in this report",
    "we extend the comparison to miniboone nce antineutrino data which have only recently become available .",
    "in all the calculations we have adopted the standard value of the axial mass , i.e. , @xmath9 gev@xmath10 , and we have neglected strangeness effects in the nucleon form factors .",
    "the bound nucleon states are taken as self - consistent dirac - hartree solutions derived within a relativistic mean field approach using a lagrangian containing @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 mesons @xcite .    in the rgf calculations",
    "we have used three parametrizations for the relativistic op of @xmath14c : the energy - dependent and a - dependent edad1 ( the @xmath15 represents the energy and the @xmath16 the atomic number ) and the energy - dependent but a - independent edai ops of @xcite , and the more recent democratic ( dem ) op of @xcite .",
    "edai is a single - nucleus parametrization , which is constructed to better reproduce the elastic proton-@xmath14c phenomenology .",
    "in contrast , edad1 and dem depend on the atomic number @xmath16 and are obtained through a fit to more than 200 data sets of elastic proton - nucleus scattering data on a wide range of nuclei that is not limited to doubly closed shell nuclei . in @xcite the evolution of qe electron scattering cross sections along different isotopic and isotonic chains evaluated within the rgf with the dem op is presented : the different number of nucleons along the chains produces different ops , but the results for the cross sections are always reasonable , even for nuclei with large asymmetry between the number of neutrons and protons .     cross section as a function of @xmath1 .",
    "the data are from @xcite . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : miniboone_models ] our nce @xmath17 cross sections are displayed as a function of @xmath18 , where @xmath1 is defined assuming the target nucleon at rest , @xmath19 is the nucleon mass , and @xmath20 is the total kinetic energy of the outgoing nucleons .",
    "these results have already been published in @xcite and are presented here again for completeness .",
    "the rpwia results , where fsi are neglected , show a satisfactory , although not perfect , agreement with the magnitude of the data whereas the rrop ones , which are calculated retaining only the real part of the edai potential , underestimate the data but for @xmath21 ( gev@xmath22 . the rgf cross sections are in better agreement with the data .",
    "the differences between the rgf results are due to the different imaginary parts of the relativistic ops adopted in the calculations , which produce large differences in the neutrino - nucleus cross sections evaluated at fixed neutrino energies and at small values of the outgoing nucleon kinetic energy ,    , but for @xmath23 cross section .",
    "the data are from @xcite . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : miniboone_models_nubar ] we present our flux - averaged nce @xmath23 cross sections as a function of @xmath1 .",
    "in @xcite we already presented theoretical predictions for antineutrino cross sections using the set of efficiency coefficients given in @xcite for neutrino scattering .",
    "the selection for the antineutrino nce sample is slightly different from the neutrino one and the efficiencies are only approximately similar .",
    "the results displayed in fig .  [ fig : miniboone_models_nubar ] are evaluated with the correct efficiencies for antineutrinos .",
    "also in the antineutrino case the rrop cross sections are lower than the rpwia ones , whereas the rgf produces larger cross sections .",
    "the data are underpredicted by the rrop and satisfactorily described by the rpwia . a better agreement with the data",
    "is generally provided by the rgf , in particular when the dem op is adopted .",
    "the rgf - edai results are enhanced at @xmath24 ( gev@xmath22 and the rgf - edad1 cross sections are similar to the rpwia ones in the entire kinematical range of miniboone @xmath8 flux .",
    "all the models are able to reasonably reproduce the first datum at @xmath25 ( gev@xmath22 .",
    "to @xmath7 nce scattering cross section with total error .",
    "the data are from @xcite . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio ] we show our results for the ratio of the @xmath8 to @xmath7 nce scattering cross section . ratios of cross sections are particularly interesting , owing to the fact that in the ratios distortion effects are largely reduced and different descriptions of fsi are expected to produce similar results @xcite . from the experimental point of view , both @xmath7 and @xmath8 nce measurements were made in the same beamline and with the same detector but with opposite horn polarities @xcite . despite the fact that the experimental @xmath7 and @xmath8 fluxes are not identical",
    ", the ratio of the two cross sections should minimize the errors and provide a useful observable to test various theoretical models .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio ] all the models give , as it was expected , very close results . in particular ,",
    "the rgf results are practically independent of the parametrization adopted for the op ; small differences can be seen only at very low @xmath1 , but all the results are within the experimental errors . at large @xmath1",
    "all the results slightly underestimate the data .",
    "this is related to the fact that the @xmath8 cross sections in fig .",
    "[ fig : miniboone_models_nubar ] are underestimated for @xmath26 ( gev@xmath22 , whereas the @xmath7 cross sections in fig .",
    "[ fig : miniboone_models ] are within the error bars in the entire range of @xmath1 .",
    "the predictions of different relativistic descriptions of fsi have been compared with the nce miniboone data for @xmath7 and @xmath8-nucleus scattering .",
    "the rgf results are able to describe the data , both for @xmath7 and @xmath8 scattering , without the need to increase the standard value of the axial mass .",
    "visible differences on the rgf cross sections at low values of @xmath1 are produced by the use of different parametrizations of the phenomenological op .",
    "the best agreement with the data is given by the rgf - dem results .",
    "in the ratio of the @xmath8 to @xmath7 nce scattering cross sections fsi effects are strongly reduced and the rgf results are practically independent of the choice of the op .",
    "the experimental ratio is reasonably described when @xmath27 ( gev@xmath22 and slightly underestimated when @xmath28 ( gev@xmath22 by all the rgf results .",
    "different and independent models have confirmed the important role of contributions other than direct one - nucleon emission .",
    "owing to the flux - average procedure , @xmath7-nucleus reactions at miniboone can have important contributions from effects beyond the ia in some kinematic regions where the experimental @xmath7 flux has significant strength @xcite .",
    "although contributions like , e.g. , rescattering processes of the nucleon , non - nucleonic @xmath29 excitations , or multinucleon processes are not included explicitly in the rgf model , they can be recovered , at least to some extent , by the imaginary part of the phenomenological op .",
    "the use of such a phenomenological ingredient , however , does not allow us to explain in detail the origin of the enhancement of the rgf results with respect to the results of other models based on the ia . at present , lacking a phenomenological op which exactly fulfills the dispersion relations in the whole energy region of interest , the rgf predictions are not univocally determined from the elastic phenomenology . a better determination of a relativistic op , which closely fulfills the dispersion relations , deserves further investigation .",
