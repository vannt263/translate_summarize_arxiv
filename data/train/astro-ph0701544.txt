    "the investigation of the primordial processes that sculpted the structure of the kuiper belt is still an active topic of research .",
    "several models have been developed over the last decade , based on the effects of neptune s migration on the distant planetesimal disk ( malhotra  1995 ; hahn & malhotra  1999 ; gomes  2003 ; levison & morbidelli  2003 ; see morbidelli et al@xmath0 2003 for a review ) .",
    "however , many aspects of the kuiper belt have not yet been fully explained .",
    "moreover , a new paradigm about the giant planets orbital evolution has recently been proposed ( tsiganis et al@xmath0 2005 ; gomes et al@xmath0 2005 ; see morbidelli  2005 or levison et al@xmath0  2006 for reviews ) , which calls for a global revisiting of the kuiper belt sculpting problem .    in this evolving situation , chiang et al@xmath0  ( 2006 , hereafter c06 )",
    "have recently proposed an novel scenario .",
    "the idea is based on a recent pair of papers by goldreich et al@xmath0  ( 2004a , b , hereafter g04 for the pair and g04a and g04b for each individual paper ) , who , based on analytic arguments , predicted that originally planets began to grow between @xmath2 and @xmath3au .",
    "however , as these planets grew to masses of @xmath4 their orbits went unstable , of them were ejected , leaving uranus and neptune in their current orbits .",
    "c06 argued that this violent process could explain the structure of the kuiper belt that we see today .",
    "we review the c06 scenario in more detail in section  [ sec_chiang ] . like g04",
    ", the c06 scenario was not tested with numerical simulations , but was solely supported by order - of - magnitude analytic estimates , which were only possible under a number of simplifications and assumptions .",
    "therefore , the goal of this paper is to simulate numerically c06 s scenario , in order to see if the presence of neptune mass bodies ( or a similar configuration ) in a primordial planetesimal disk is indeed consistent with the observed structure of the outer solar system ( the orbital distribution of the kuiper belt and of the planets ) . because g04 and c06 scenarios heavily rely on the presence of a highly collisional planetesimal disk , we need first to develop a new numerical integrator that takes collisions into account as well as their effects on the dynamical evolution .",
    "this code is described and tested in section  [ sec_code ] . in section",
    "4 we then describe the results of the simulations that we did of c06 s scenario .",
    "the conclusions and the implications are discussed in section  5 .",
    "as we discussed above , c06 s scenario for sculpting the kuiper belt is built on g04 s scheme for planet formation . in g04",
    ", the authors pushed to an extreme the concept of runaway ( ohtsuki & ida 1990 ; kokubo & ida 1996 ) and oligarchic growth ( kokubo & ida 1998 ; thommes et al@xmath0 2003 ; chambers , 2006 ) of proto - planets in planetesimal disks . unlike previous works",
    ", they assumed that the bulk of the mass of the planetesimal disk is in particles so small ( sub - meter to cm in size ) that they have very short mean free paths .",
    "in this situation the disk is highly collisional , and the collisional damping is so efficient that the orbital excitation passed from the growing planets to the disk is instantaneously dissipated . with this set - up , the extremely cold disk exerts a very effective and time enduring dynamical friction on the growing planetary embryos , whose orbital eccentricities and inclinations remain very small . consequently , the embryos grow quickly , accreting the neighboring material due to the fact that gravitational focusing is large .    the order - of - magnitude analytic estimates that describe this evolution lead to the conclusion that the system reaches a steady state consisting of a chain of planets , separated by 5 hill radii embedded in a sea of small particles .",
    "as the planets grow , their masses increase while their number decreases .",
    "this process continues until the surface density of the planetary embryos , @xmath5 , is equal to that of the disk , @xmath6 .",
    "if the mass of the disk is tuned to obtain planets of uranus / neptune mass when @xmath7 then the conclusion is that about 5 of these planets had to form in the range 20@xmath8au .",
    "g04 argue that when @xmath7 the dynamical friction exerted on the planets by the disk is no longer sufficient to stabilize the planetary orbits .",
    "consequently , the planets start to scatter one another onto highly elliptical and inclined orbits .",
    "they assume that are ejected from the solar system in this scattering process ( no attempts were made to model this event ) .",
    "once have disappeared , the two remaining planets feel a much weaker excitation , and therefore their orbits can be damped by the dynamical friction exerted by the remaining disk .",
    "become uranus and neptune , with quasi - circular co - planar orbits at @xmath2 and @xmath9 au .",
    "c06 argues that this basic scenario , with some small modifications , can explain much of the structure currently seen in the kuiper belt .",
    "the kuiper belt displays a very complex dynamical structure . for our purposes , four characteristics of the kuiper belt",
    "are important : 1 ) the kuiper belt apparently ends near @xmath10au ( trujillo & brown  2001 ; allen et al@xmath0  2001 , 2002 ) .",
    "2 ) the kuiper belt appears to consist of at least two distinct populations with different dynamical and physical properties ( brown  2001 ; levison & stern  2001 ; trujillo & brown  2002 ; tegler & romanishin ,  2003 ) .",
    "one group is dynamically quiescent and thus we call it the _ cold population_. all the objects in this population are red in color .",
    "the other group is dynamically excited , inclinations can be as large as 40@xmath11 , and thus we call it the _ hot population_. it , too , contains red objects , but it also contains about as many objects that are gray in color . the largest objects in the kuiper belt reside in the hot population .",
    "3 ) many members of the hot population are trapped in the mean motion resonances ( mmrs ) with neptune .",
    "the most important of these is the 2:3mmr , which is occupied by pluto .",
    "4 ) the kuiper belt only contains less than roughly @xmath12 of material ( jewitt et al .",
    "1996 ; chiang & brown  1999 ; trujillo et al .  2001 ; gladman et al .  2001",
    "; bernstein et al@xmath0  2004 ) .",
    "this is surprising given that accretion models predict that @xmath13 must have existed in this region in order for the objects that we see to grow ( stern  1996 ; stern & colwell ,  1997 ; kenyon & luu ,  1998 , 1999 ) .",
    "c06 suggests the following explanation for the kuiper belt s structure .",
    "first , in order to make the edge ( characteristic  1 above ) , they assume that the planetesimal disk is truncated at @xmath14au . this assumption is legitimate given the work of youdin & shu ( 2002 ) and youdin & chiang ( 2004 ) on planetesimal formation .",
    "they assume as a variant of the pure g04 scenario  that some coagulation actually occurred in the planetesimal disk while the planets were growing .",
    "this coagulation produced a population of objects with a size distribution and a total number comparable to the hot population that we see today .",
    "because this population constitutes only a small fraction of the total disk s mass , their existence does not change the overall collisional properties of the disk , which are essential for g04 s story .",
    "thus , during the final growth of the ice giants , c06 envisions three distinct populations : the ` planetary embryos ' ( objects that eventually become neptune - sized ) , the ` kbos ' ( macroscopic objects of comparable size to the current kuiper belt objects , formed by coagulation ) , and ` disk particles ' ( golf - ball sized planetesimals that constitute the bulk of the disk s mass and which have a very intense collision rate and damping ) .",
    "the kbos are not massive enough to be affected by dynamical friction , but are big enough not to be damped by collisions with the disk - particles .    as the planets grow to their final sizes , c06 estimate that the kbos can be scattered by the growing planets to orbits with eccentricities and inclinations of order of 0.2 .",
    "these , they argue , become the hot population , which has observed eccentricities and inclinations comparable to these values . after original planets are removed by the dynamical instability and",
    "the ice giants evolve onto their current orbits inside of @xmath15au , c06 suggest that there is still a population of disk particles between 40 and @xmath16au . with the planets gone , this disk can become dynamically cold enough to allow large objects to grow in it , producing a second generation of kbos on low - eccentricity and low - inclination orbits .",
    "these objects should be identified , in c06 s scenario , with the observed cold population of the kuiper belt .",
    "the mass of the disk between 40 and @xmath16au , however , should retain on order of half of its original mass , namely about 20  @xmath17 according to the surface density assumed in c06 s equation  ( 13 ) .",
    "how this total mass was lost and how the cold population acquired its current , non - negligible eccentricity excitation , are not really explained by c06 .",
    "the authors limit themselves to the radial migration of neptune , after the circularization of its orbit , although admit that it is not at all obvious how planet migration would proceed in a highly collisional disk . as for the mass depletion , however , it is not clear ( at least to us ) why collisional grinding would become so effective at this late stage while it was negligible during the planet formation and removal phases , when the relative velocities much higher .",
    "at this point we want to emphasize that , although the ideas presented in g04 and c06 are new and intriguing , the papers do not present any actual models .",
    "most of the arguments are based on order - of - magnitude equations where factors of 2 and @xmath18 are dropped and approximate time - scales are set equal to one another in order to determine zeroth - order steady state solutions .",
    "in addition , simplifications are made to make the problem tractable analytically , like , for example , at any given instant all of the disk particles have the same size .",
    "another example of a simplification is that the rate of change of the velocity dispersion of the disk particles due to collisions is simply set to the particle - in - the - box collision rate  the physics of the collisions are ignored .",
    "while making such approximations is reasonable when first exploring a problem and determining whether it could possibly work , numerical experiments are really required in order to determine whether the process does indeed act as the analytic expressions predict .",
    "finally , many of the steps in these scenarios are not justified .",
    "of particular interest to us is the stage when , according to g04 , ice giants are removed from the system via a gravitational instability .",
    "the papers present order - of - magnitude equations that argue that such an instability would occur , but the authors are forced to speculate about the outcome of this event .    indeed , we suspect , based on our experiences , that g04 s expectations about the removal of the ice giants are naive .",
    "in particular , levison et al@xmath0  ( 1998 ) followed the dynamical evolution of a series of fictitious giant planet systems during a global instability .",
    "they found that during the phase when planets are scattering off of one another , the planetary system spreads to large heliocentric distances , and , while planets can be removed by encounters , the outermost planet is the most like to survive .",
    "similarly , morbidelli et al@xmath0  ( 2002 ) studied systems of planetary embryos of various masses originally in the kuiper belt and found that in all cases the embryos spread and some survived at large heliocentric distances . from these works",
    "we might expect that g04 s instability would lead to an ice giant at large heliocentric distances ( but still within the observation limits ) , rather than having a planetary system that ends at @xmath15au with a disk of small particles beyond .",
    "granted , the simulations in both levison et al@xmath0  ( 1998 ) and morbidelli et al@xmath0  ( 2002 ) did not include a disk of highly - damped particles that can significantly affect the evolution of the planets , so new simulations are needed to confirm or dismiss the g04/c06 scenario . in this paper",
    "we perform such simulations .",
    "we are required to develop a new numerical integration scheme to account for the collisional damping of the particle disk .",
    "this scheme is detailed and tested in the next section .",
    "in this section we describe , in detail , the code that we constructed to test the c06 scenario . before we can proceed , however , we must first discuss what physics we need to include in the models . as we described above",
    ", our motivation is to determine how a system containing a number of ice - giant planets embedded in a disk of collisionally damped particles dynamically evolves with time .",
    "our plan is to reproduce the systems envisioned by g04 and c06 as closely as possible rather than create the most realistic models that we can .",
    "thus , we purposely adopt some of the same assumptions employed by g04 .",
    "for example , although g04 invoke a collisional cascade to set up the systems that they study , their formalism assumes that the disk particles all have the same size and ignore the effects of fragmentation and coagulation .",
    "we make the same assumption .",
    "in addition , although g04 invokes a collisional cascade to grind kilometer - sized planetesimals to submeter - sized disk particles , they implicitly assume that the timescale to change particle size is short compared to any of the dynamical timescales in the problem .",
    "thus , their analytic representation assumes that the radius of the disk particles , @xmath19 , is fixed .",
    "they determine which @xmath19 to use by arguing that disk particles will grind themselves down until the timescale for the embryos to excite their orbits is equal to the collisional damping time ( which is a function of @xmath19 ) .",
    "then @xmath19 is held constant .",
    "we , therefore , hold @xmath19 constant as well .",
    "in addition , g04 does not include the effects of gas drag in their main derivations , we again follow their lead in this regard .",
    "our code is based on symba ( duncan et al .",
    "1998 , levison & duncan 2000 ) .",
    "symba is a symplectic algorithm that has the desirable properties of the sophisticated and highly efficient numerical algorithm known as wisdom - holman map ( whm , wisdom & holman 1991 ) and that , in addition , can handle close encounters ( duncan et al@xmath0  1998 ) .",
    "this technique is based on a variant of the standard whm , but it handles close encounters by employing a multiple time step technique introduced by skeel & biesiadecki  ( 1994 ) .",
    "when bodies are well separated , the algorithm has the speed of the whm method , and whenever two bodies suffer a mutual encounter , the time step for the relevant bodies is recursively subdivided .    although symba represented a significant advancement to the state - of - art of integrating orbits , it suffers from a basic and serious limitation . at each time step of the integration",
    ", it is necessary to calculate the mutual gravitational forces between all bodies in the simulation .",
    "if there are @xmath20 bodies , one therefore requires @xmath21 force calculations per time step , because every object needs to react to the gravitational force of every other body .",
    "thus , even with fast clusters of workstations , we are computationally limited to integrating systems where the total number of bodies of the order of a few thousand .    yet , in order to follow both the dynamical and collisional evolution of the numerous small bodies present during the g04 s scenario , we need to implement a way to follow the behavior of roughly @xmath22 particles .",
    "this clearly is beyond the capabilities of direct orbit integrators .",
    "only statistical methods can handle this number of objects . in the following ,",
    "we describe our approach to this problem .    as described above , the systems that c06 envisions have three classes of particles : the planetary embryos , the kbos , and the disk particles .",
    "each class has its unique dynamical characteristics .",
    "the embryos are few in number and their dynamics are not directly effected by collisional damping .",
    "thus , in our new code , which we call _ symba_col _ , they can be followed directly in the standard @xmath20-body part of symba .",
    "the kbos are not dynamically important to the system from either a dynamical or collisional point of view .",
    "since we are more concerned here with the final location of the ice giants than the dynamical state of the kuiper belt , we ignore this population .",
    "finally , we need to include a very large population of submeter - sized particles that both dynamically interact with the rest of the system and collisionally interact with each other .",
    "thus , we have added a new class of particle to symba which we call a _ tracer _ particle .",
    "each tracer is intended to represent a large number of disk particles on roughly the same orbit as one another .",
    "each tracer is characterized by three numbers : the physical radius @xmath19 , the bulk density @xmath23 , and the total mass of the disk particles represented by the tracer , @xmath24 .",
    "for example , the runs presented below , we set @xmath25 cm or @xmath26 m and @xmath27 .",
    "in addition , we typically want to represent a @xmath28 disk with @xmath29 tracer particles , meaning that @xmath30 ( although the exact numbers vary from run to run ) .    the first issue we needed to address when constructing symba_col , was to determine an algorithm that correctly handles the gravitational interaction between the embryos and the disk particles .",
    "since there are only a few embryos and they are relatively large , the acceleration of the tracers due to the embryos can be determined using the normal @xmath20-body part of symba .",
    "it is less obvious , however , whether the gravitational effect of the disk particles on the embryos can also be effectively simulated using the normal @xmath20-body part of symba , i@xmath0e@xmath0 using the forces directly exerted on the embryos by the tracers . to argue this position , let us point out that the gravitational effect of the disk particles on the embryos is well approximated by the _",
    "dynamical friction _ formalism , which , assuming a maxwellian velocity distribution , can be written as ( chandrasekhar 1943 ; also see binney & tremaine  1987 ) : @xmath31 \\vec{w } , \\label{eq_df}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 ) , @xmath33 is the velocity of the embryo , @xmath34 is the velocity dispersion of the disk particles , @xmath35 is that mass of an individual disk particle , ` erf ' is the error function , and @xmath36 is the background volume density of the disk .",
    "so , if @xmath37 , the acceleration of the embryos due to the disk is independent on the mass of individual disk particles .",
    "thus , although @xmath38 , the direct acceleration of the embryos due to the tracers is roughly the same as if we had each individual disk particle in the simulation as long as @xmath39 .",
    "therefore , in general , we can employ the standard @xmath20-body part of the symba to calculate the gravitational effects of the embryos and the disk particles on each other .",
    "we return to the issue of how big @xmath40 needs to be in the next section .",
    "all that is left is to consider the effects of the disk particles on each other .",
    "there are two effects that must be included : collisional damping and self - gravity .",
    "we handle the former through monte carlo techniques .",
    "the first step in our collisional algorithm is to divide the solar system into a series of logarithmically spaced annular rings that , in the simulations performed here , stretched from @xmath41au to @xmath42au .",
    "as we describe more below , the logarithmic spacing is employed by the self - gravity algorithm . in all , we divided space into @xmath43 such rings in our production runs ( although in some of our tests , we used @xmath44 rings ) .",
    "we use these rings to statistically keep track of the state of the disk particles .",
    "in particular , as the simulation progresses , we keep track of the tracer particles moving through the ring and from this calculate : 1 ) the total mass of disk particles in that ring ( @xmath45 ) , and 2 ) the vertical velocity dispersion of the disk particles , @xmath46 .",
    "these values are recalculated every @xmath47 , by moving each tracer along its kepler orbit in the barycentric frame and adding its contribution to each ring as it passes through .",
    "we set @xmath48yr .",
    "in addition , as the tracers orbit during the simulation , we keep a running list of their velocities and longitudes as they pass through each individual ring .",
    "entries are dropped from this list if they are older than @xmath47 .    at each timestep in the simulation",
    ", we evaluate the probability , @xmath49 , that each tracer particle will suffer a collision with another disk particle based on the particle - in - a - box approximation .",
    "in particular , @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the local number density of the disk particles , @xmath33 is the velocity of the tracer relative to the mean velocity of the disk , and @xmath52 is the timestep .",
    "it is important to note that @xmath51 is not the number density of tracers , but the number density of the disk assuming that all disk particles had a radius of @xmath19 .",
    "therefore , @xmath49 does not carry any information about the mass or number of tracers , but is only dependent on the surface density of the disk , its vertical velocity dispersion , and @xmath19 .",
    "in addition , the analytic derivations usually assume that @xmath53 , however , here we use the true velocity of the individual tracer .",
    "once we have determined @xmath49 , we generate a random number between 0 and 1 , and if @xmath49 is larger than this number , we declare that the tracer has suffered a collision with another disk particle .",
    "now , we need to determine the velocity of the impactor , and again we turn to our rings .",
    "as we stated above , as the tracers orbit during the simulation , we keep a running list of particles that had passed through each ring , keeping tract of their individual velocities .",
    "the impactor is assumed to have the same location as the target , but its velocity is chosen from this running list appropriately rotated assuming cylindrical symmetry .",
    "we also assume that two particles bounce off of one another ( as in g04 ) , but that the coefficient of restitution is very small .",
    "the end result is that we change the velocity of our target tracer to be the mean of its original velocity and that of the impactor .",
    "we have to spend a little time discussing how we decide which velocity in our running list to choose because if this is done incorrectly it leads to a subtle error in the results . in an early version of the code",
    "we simply chose the velocity at random .",
    "this is the same as assuming that the disk is axisymmetric , and thus collisions try to force particles onto circular orbits .",
    "however , in a situation where the disk is interacting with a massive planet on an eccentric orbit , the natural state of the disk is for its particles to evolve onto eccentric orbits whose longitude of perihelion , @xmath63 , is the same as the planet s , and whose eccentricity , @xmath64 , is a function of the eccentricity of the planet and the distance from the planet .",
    "in essence , this situation should produce an eccentric ring .",
    "experimenting with our original code showed that in situations where the ring is massive , the assumption of axisymmetry causes the planet to migrate away from the disk at an unphysically large rate , as collisions try to force particles onto circular orbits while the planet tries to excite their eccentricities .",
    "thus , we found that our code needs to be able to support eccentric rings .",
    "we found we can accomplish this by modifying the method we use for choosing a velocity for the impactor . in particular , in addition to storing a particle s velocity in the running list , we also keep tract of its true longitude , @xmath65 .",
    "we choose from the running list the velocity of the object that has the @xmath65 closest to that of the target tracer . in this way",
    ", asymmetries can be supported by the code .",
    "we show an example of this in the test section below .    through experimentation",
    "we also found that we need to include self - gravity between the disk particles , at least crudely . in an early version of the code",
    "we did not include this effect and found that under certain conditions there was an unphysical migration of planetary embryos .",
    "in particular , in situations where disk particles became trapped in a mmr with an embryo ( particularly the 1:1 mmr ) the embryo was incorrectly pushed around by the disk particles if there was a large number of additional disk particles in the system . this did not occur if the particle self - gravity was included .",
    "there are too many tracers in our simulations to include self - gravity directly .",
    "thus , we employ a technique originally developed for the study of disk galaxies , known as the particle - mesh ( pm ) method ( miller  1978 ) . in what follows ,",
    "we use the formalism from binney & tremaine  ( 1987 ) .",
    "we first define a modified polar coordinate system @xmath66 and @xmath67 , where @xmath68 and @xmath67 are the normal polar coordinates , and define a _ reduced _ potential , @xmath69 $ ] and a _ reduced _ surface density @xmath70 $ ] such that : @xmath71 if we break the disk into cells this becomes : @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 is the green s function : @xmath75 when @xmath76 and @xmath77 , and @xmath78,\\ ] ] where @xmath79 and @xmath80 are the grid spacings .    for this algorithm we found that it is best to assume that the disk is axisymmetric",
    ", so equation  [ eq_vlm ] becomes @xmath81 @xmath82 note that equation  [ eq_vl ] is one dimensional , and thus it only supplies us with a radial force .",
    "the tangential and vertical forces are assumed to be zero .",
    "we made this assumption due to the small number of tracers in our system .",
    "however , a simple radial force is adequate for our purposes .",
    "also , the form of equation  [ eq_vl ] allows us to use the rings already constructed for the collisional algorithm .",
    "all we need is that relationship between @xmath83 and the total amount of mass in ring , @xmath45 .",
    "we find that @xmath84,\\ ] ] where @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 are the outer edge , inner edge , and radial center of ring @xmath88 .",
    "so , equation  [ eq_vl ] gives us the reduced potential at the center of ring @xmath88 and thus the true potential can be found ( @xmath89 ) . to calculate the radial acceleration at any location",
    ", we employ a cubic spline interpolation scheme .",
    "finally , the acceleration of a particle is calculated by numerically differentiating this interpolation .      in this subsection",
    "we describe some of the tests that we performed on symba_col .    in this test ,",
    "we the behavior of a disk of particles initially on eccentric orbits as collisions damp their relative velocities .",
    "in particular , we evolved a system containing the sun and 1000 tracers , which were uniformly spread in semi - major axis from 30 to @xmath90au .",
    "initially , the tracers were given a raleigh distribution with an rms eccentricity equal to 0.1 , and an rms @xmath91 equal to @xmath92 .",
    "the total mass of the ring was @xmath93 and we set @xmath94 cm .",
    "3.0truein    the solid curve in figure  [ fig_t1f_e ] shows the temporal evolution of the eccentricities in the above system .",
    "as the system evolved , the ring collapsed ( i@xmath0e@xmath0 eccentricities and inclinations dropped ) as the collisions damped out random velocities . during this process",
    ", we found that a small fraction of the particles were left behind because as the ring collapsed these particles found themselves in regions of space where there were no other particles .",
    "for example , if a particle had a relatively large initial inclination and happened not to have suffered a collision early on , then it can be left behind on a large inclination orbit because it finds itself traveling above and below the collapsing disk most of the time .",
    "eventually , it will hit another particle because it penetrates the disk , but this can take a long time .",
    "the end result of this process is that during the collapse , there is always a high velocity tail to the eccentricity and inclination distributions . to correct for this ,",
    "we plot the median eccentricity rather than the more standard rms eccentricity in figure  [ fig_t1f_e ] . in this system",
    ", we find that the e - folding damping time of the eccentricity is @xmath95 years .    in order to test",
    "whether our code has converged we performed a second experiment . recall that in the first run , we used 1000 tracers , @xmath43 , and @xmath96yr .",
    "this produced the solid curve in the figure .",
    "the dotted curve shows the results for a high resolution run where @xmath44 , @xmath97yr , and we used @xmath98 tracer particles .",
    "we now need to calculate what g04 s development would predict .",
    "g04a s equation  ( 50 ) states that @xmath99 plugging in the appropriate values for this test , we find that g04 predicts that the collisional damping time , @xmath100 , should be @xmath101yr , which is about a factor of 3 shorter than we observed . however , we believe that the agreement is reasonably good because g04 s derivations were intended to be order - of - magnitude in nature and that factors of a few were typically dropped .    as discussed above , we that our code must be able to support an eccentric ring if the dynamics demand it , and we described our methods for doing so . here",
    "we present a test of this ability .",
    "in particular , we studied the behavior of a @xmath93 narrow ring of collisional particles under the gravitational influence of saturn . in order to enhance the eccentricity forcing of the ring",
    ", we set saturn s @xmath102 .",
    "the semi - major axes ( @xmath103 ) of the disk particles was spread from @xmath104 where @xmath105 is saturn s semi - major axis .",
    "the particles had an initial eccentricity of 0.1 .",
    "of importance here , the initial @xmath63 was randomly chosen from the range of 0 and @xmath106 .",
    "thus , if we define two new variables , @xmath107 and @xmath108 , then at @xmath109 the tracer particles fall along a circle of radius @xmath64 in @xmath110@xmath111 space ( figure  [ fig_t8_hk ] ) .",
    "2.4truein    we find that as the system settles down , the particles evolve to a point in @xmath110@xmath111 space ( figure  [ fig_t8_hk ] ) . and",
    "since this point does not sit at the origin , the particles have the same @xmath64 and @xmath63 , i@xmath0e@xmath0 they form an eccentric ring .",
    "unfortunately , we know of no analytic theory describing the behavior of this ring . however , we can take a clue from the secular theory of the response of a massless test particle to an eccentric planet ( brouwer & clemence 1961 , see also murray & dermott  2000 ) , which predicts that the ` forced ' eccentricity of the particle is : @xmath112 where @xmath113 are the laplace coefficients . plugging in the appropriate values",
    ", we find @xmath114 .",
    "this should be an upper limit to the actual eccentricity of the ring because the collisions within the disk , which are not included in equation  [ eq_eforce ] , should decrease eccentricity .",
    "we find the ring has an eccentricity of @xmath115 , although the exact values changes over time .",
    "thus , the ring seems to behaving reasonably .",
    "interestingly , we also find that this ring s precession is negative , which implies that self - gravity is important to its dynamics , which again is reasonable .    :",
    "as g04 explained in detail , a system consisting of growing embryos in a sea of disk particles will be in one of two possible modes .",
    "if the velocity dispersion of the disk particles is large enough that the scale height of the planetesimal disk exceeds the radius of the embryo s hill s sphere , @xmath116 , then the disk behaves as if it is fully three dimensional .",
    "this occurs if @xmath117 .",
    "this situation is to as the _ dispersion - dominated _ regime .",
    "however , if collisions damp planetesimal random velocities strongly enough , @xmath34 can get much smaller than @xmath118 and the system enters the so - called _ shear - dominated _ regime . in this mode , growth proceeds in a qualitatively different way , and can be much more rapid than dispersion - dominated growth ( also see rafikov  2004 ) . in the extreme , the velocity dispersion can be so small that the entire vertical column of the planetesimal disk is within the protoplanet s hill s sphere , thus making accretion a two - dimensional process .    given the different nature of these two regimes , we test each of them separately .",
    "we with the dispersion - dominated regime .",
    "this test with a population of ten @xmath119 km radii embryos spread in semi - major axes between 25 and @xmath90au .",
    "this implies that @xmath120 .",
    "the initial eccentricities of the embryos were set to 0 , but the inclinations were given a raleigh distribution with an rms @xmath91 equal to @xmath121 to insure that the embryo - embryo encounters can excite inclinations .",
    "the disk was spread between 20 and @xmath8au and was designed so that @xmath122 .",
    "we set @xmath123 m . the disk was represented by at least 2000 tracers , where the eccentricities and inclinations were chosen from raleigh distribution with an rms eccentricity and @xmath124 equal to @xmath125 .",
    "figure  [ fig_t8f_ei ] shows the temporal evolution of the eccentricities and inclinations of both the embryos ( solid curves ) and the disk particles ( dotted curves ) as observed in several runs where we varied @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "4.2truein    g04 predicts that the eccentricities of both the embryos and disk particles would increase until a steady state is reached .",
    "this steady state is caused by a balance in the heating and cooling processes in both populations .",
    "the disk particles are being excited by the embryos , while they are being damped by collisions . at the same time",
    ", the embryos are exciting each other , while they are being damped due to dynamical friction with the disk particles .",
    "this steady state is clearly seen in our simulations ( figure  [ fig_t8f_ei ] ) .",
    "indeed , g04 s analysis allows us to predict what the steady state eccentricities should be .",
    "in particular , in the regime of interest , g04 finds ( equation  76 ) that for the disk particles @xmath128 where @xmath129 is the escape velocity of the embryos . plugging in the above values , we find that @xmath130 , which corresponds to an rms eccentricity of @xmath131 ( the circular velocity at @xmath15au is @xmath132 so that @xmath133 ) .",
    "this is in excellent agreement with our simulation . for the embryos ,",
    "if @xmath134 is defined to be their velocity dispersion , then recently chiang & lithwick ( 2005 , their equation 45 ) showed that @xmath135 which is @xmath136 in our test problem .",
    "we observe this ratio to be roughly @xmath137 .",
    "we believe that our simulations are reproducing the g04 s predictions fairly well given the order - of - magnitude nature of g04 s derivations .    as in our previous test , we must consider whether our code has high enough resolution . to investigate this issue",
    ", we performed four simulations where the only difference was the resolution of the disk .",
    "the black , red , and blue curves in figure  [ fig_t8f_ei ] show the results for an increasing number of tracer particles ( 2000 , @xmath98 , and @xmath138 , respectively ) . in all these cases @xmath139 . in addition",
    ", the green curves ( labeled ` hires ' ) show the results for a simulation with @xmath98 tracer particles , but where @xmath44 . in all cases",
    "the behavior of the systems are very similar .",
    "we must also consider conserved quantities when testing our code .",
    "unfortunately , collisions do not conserve energy , and so the only conserved quantity is the angular momentum vector of the system . in the run presented in figure  [ fig_t8f_ei ] , we find that angular momentum is conserved to 1 part in @xmath140 over @xmath141myr , which is satisfactory .    finally , g04 predict that the embryos will grow as they accrete the disk particles .",
    "in particular , their equation  77 predicts that @xmath142 for the parameters in this test , this predicts @xmath143 . in the simulation ,",
    "all embryos started with @xmath144 km . at the end of @xmath145 years , equation  [ eq_dr ] forecasts that the embryos should grow @xmath146 km .",
    "we find at the end of the simulation that the average embryo radius is @xmath147 km .",
    "again , the agreement is good .    : as a final test of our code , we study the behavior of a system containing embryos with a mass of @xmath148 embedded in a @xmath149 disk of planetesimals spread from 27 to @xmath150au .",
    "the radius of the disk particles was set to @xmath151 cm .",
    "this problem was designed so that the system should be in the shear - dominated regime .",
    "5.0truein    the results from several simulations with different disk resolutions is presented in figure  [ fig_t5f_e ] .",
    "we start with a discussion of code convergence .",
    "we preformed simulations with @xmath126 between 2000 and 32,700 particles . in almost all runs",
    "@xmath152 , however we created one simulation with @xmath153 ( marked ` hires ' in the figure ) .",
    "in all these calculations , we find that the behavior of the disk particles was the same .",
    "thus , we conclude that even in the highly damped shear - dominated regime , our collisional code has adequate resolution for all the cases we have studied .    the behavior of the embryos , on the other hand , only converged for @xmath154 . struggling to calculate accurately the dynamical of the tracers on the embryos .",
    "equation  [ eq_df ] shows that the strength of dynamical friction should not depend on the size of the tracer particle if @xmath155 , but the question is how big does this ratio have to be .",
    "we abide by this restriction in all the simulations that follow .",
    "for the shear - dominated regime , g04 predicts ( their equation  77 ) @xmath156 where @xmath157 is the angular size of the sun as seen from the embryo .",
    "in addition , g04 s equation  110 says @xmath158 plugging in the appropriate values for this test , we find that g04 predicts that @xmath159 and @xmath160 .",
    "in our simulation we find @xmath161 and , after convergence , @xmath162 , which is in very good agreement with g04 s analytic theory .    in conclusion",
    ", in this subsection we presented a series of tests of symba_col . in all cases",
    ", the code reproduces the desired behavior .",
    "in addition , in those cases where direct comparison with g04 s derivations is appropriate , there is reasonable quantitative agreement , within a factor of a few .",
    "this level of agreement is about what one should expect given the order - of - magnitude nature of g04 s development .",
    "thus , in the remainder of the paper we employ the code to test c06 s scenario for the early sculpting of the kuiper belt .",
    "in this section we use symba_col to perform full dynamical calculations of the scenario reviewed in  [ sec_chiang ] .",
    "in particular , for reasons discussed in  [ sec_chiang ] , we concentrate on the phase when the ice giant system becomes unstable .",
    "thus , we start our systems with a series of ice giants , each of which is @xmath163 , spread from 20 to @xmath164 , which corresponds to a spacing of roughly 5 hills sphere . in all cases ,",
    "the initial eccentricities and inclinations of the ice giants were very small ( @xmath165 ) , and jupiter and saturn were included on their current orbits .    at the time of the instability ,",
    "c06 predict that the mass of the planetesimal disk should be about the same as the total mass of the ice giants , i@xmath0e@xmath0 @xmath166 .",
    "however , given the nature of g04 s derivations , this number is very uncertain .",
    "thus , we study a range of disk masses : @xmath167 , 80 , 120 , and @xmath168 . in addition",
    ", it is uncertain what @xmath19 should be , and thus we study two extremes : @xmath25 m and @xmath26 cm .",
    "the simulations initially contain 2000 tracer particles which are spread from @xmath169 to @xmath170au .",
    "the initial eccentricities of the disk particles were set to @xmath165 , while the inclinations set to half of this value .",
    "these parameters put our code in a regime where its validity and convergence has been demonstrated in the tests in  [ sec_tests ] .    except where noted , we integrated the systems for @xmath171yrs , with a timestep of @xmath172yr .",
    "as described in levison & duncan  ( 2000 ) , symba , and thus symba_col , has difficulty handling close encounters with the sun .",
    "therefore , we remove from the simulation any object the reaches a heliocentric distance less than @xmath173au . in all , we performed 10 simulations .",
    "4.3truein    we start the discussion of our results with the @xmath25 m runs . in particular",
    ", perhaps the best way to begin is with a detailed description of the behavior on one particular simulation . for this purpose",
    "we chose the @xmath174 run since it is closest to g04 s nominal @xmath7 situation .",
    "figure  [ fig_aqq1 ] shows the temporal evolution of the nominal simulation . in the figure",
    "each ice giant is represented by three curves of the same color .",
    "the curves show its semi - major axis , perihelion , and aphelion distances .",
    "the black curve shows the semi - major axis of the outermost disk particle .",
    "in addition to the curves , there are columns of points .",
    "these points show the semi - major axes of all the disk particles at that particular time .",
    "the system remains relatively quiescent for the first @xmath175yr . during this time , the disk particles rearrange themselves so that a large fraction of them are in the trojan points of the ice giants .",
    "this behavior can be seen in the two leftmost column of dots in the figure .",
    "in addition , two rings of particles form immediately interior to and exterior to the embryos .",
    "originally the embryo growth rate is large , the in the first @xmath176yr .",
    "but after that time , very little growth happens .",
    "again , this is due to the fact that most of the mass of the disk is found in the trojan points of the embryo and in isolated rings where they are protected from the embryos . at @xmath177 years",
    "the system becomes mildly unstable and undergoes a ` spreading event ' that moves the inner ice giant inward and the outer one outward .",
    "such events are common in our simulations . after this event the eccentricities of the ice giants decrease presumably due to the fact that they are further from one another . for the next @xmath178myr",
    "the system is stable .    during this period of relative quiescence",
    "the disk particles concentrate in three main areas .",
    "roughly 30% of the disk particles can be found in a ring between the orange and red embryos .",
    "this ring therefore contains @xmath179 !",
    "it is very narrow as well  only @xmath180au in width .",
    "roughly the same amount of material can be found in a ring at @xmath16au , beyond all of the embryos . this ring is also very narrow with a width of only @xmath181au .",
    "finally , 29% of the disk can be found in the trojan points of the green embryo .",
    "this implies that there is more mass in the lagrange points than in the embryo , itself .",
    "the characteristics of these structures leaves us wondering how physically realistic they are .",
    "after all , our code ignores fragmentation , which may be important as the ring forms .",
    "in addition , once the ring forms , the relative velocities are very small and the surface densities are large , thus we might expect either two - body accretion or a gravitational instability to form larger objects .",
    "we believe that the ring is an artifact of the simplistic collisional physics that we inherited from g04 and they are probably not physical .    at @xmath182myr , the red and green embryos in the figure",
    "hit the 4:3 mean motion resonance with one another .",
    "this destabilizes the embryos and they undergo a series of scattering events with one another .",
    "a large number of disk particles are released from their their storage locations at this time .",
    "this period of violence lasts for @xmath183yrs , but eventually the dynamical friction caused by the released disk particles is able to decouple the embryos from one another .",
    "amusingly , the blue and orange embryos get trapped in the 1:1 mean motion resonance with one another , which lasts for over 5 million years .    during the remainder of the simulation ,",
    "the ice giants migrate outward .",
    "the disk particles that were liberated during the instability are spread out enough that their collisional damping time is longer than the time between encounters with the embryos .",
    "thus , the planets hand the particles off to one another allowing a redistribution of angular momentum",
    ". this process , which is called _ planetesimal - driven migration _ is well understood ( see levison et al@xmath0  2006 for a review ) since it was discovered over 20 years ago ( fernndez & ip  1986 ) and has been studied as a possible explanation of the resonant structure of the kuiper belt ( malhotra  1995 , hahn & malhotra  2005 ) .",
    "4.2truein    however , collisional damping still does play a role during this time .",
    "as the planets migrate , four relatively high mass rings start to form . at the end of the simulation",
    "the most massive of these contain @xmath184 !",
    "indeed , the final system is shown in figure  [ fig_final1 m ] .",
    "figure  [ fig_final1m]a shows the eccentricity of objects as a function of their semi - major axis .",
    "the planets are in color , with the ` error - bars ' showing the range of heliocentric distances that they travel as they orbit .",
    "we find that the inclinations , which are not shown , are roughly what one would expect  i@xmath0e@xmath0 the @xmath91 s are roughly half the eccentricities , this is a general result that we see in all the runs .",
    "the size of the symbol in the figure scales as the mass of the planet to the @xmath185 power .",
    "the disk particles are shown in black . figure  [ fig_final1m]b presents a histogram of the mass of the disk particles as a function of semi - major axis .",
    "there are three important things to note about the final system : 1 ) none of the ice giants was ejected from the system .",
    "2 ) there is a planet in a nearly circular orbit at a large heliocentric distance ( although it is close enough that if it actually existed it would have been discovered long ago ) .",
    "although this system may not be finished evolving , it is very unlikely that this planet will be removed .",
    "3 ) almost all the disk particles survive . of the @xmath186 of material in the disk , @xmath187 are still present at @xmath141myr .",
    "almost all of this mass is found in four massive rings interior to @xmath15au .",
    "we performed 3 other simulations with @xmath94 m and the stories for these simulations are , for the most part , very similar .",
    "the final states of these systems are shown in figure  [ fig_finalallm ] .",
    "this figure is the same as figure  [ fig_final1m]a , which fits in the sequences between figure  [ fig_finalallm]a and b. the first thing to note is that the entire planetary system went unstable in the @xmath188 run . in this case , a @xmath189 ring formed in saturn s 1:2 mean motion resonance that eventually drove up saturn s eccentricity until the jupiter - saturn system was disrupted .",
    "we will ignore this run in the following analysis because it clearly can not represent what happened in the solar system .",
    "there were no planetary ejections in any of these simulations in the remaining runs .",
    "there was one merger in the @xmath190 run . in all cases ,",
    "we find massive planets at large heliocentric distances , inconsistent with the current solar system and the expectations of g04 and c06 .",
    "4.9truein    as we described above , we are interested in setting up our initial conditions so that they represent c06 s hypothetical solar system immediately before the instability sets in , when the ice giants are presumably almost fully formed .",
    "that is reason we started with systems where the initial mass of the ice giants was set to @xmath191 .",
    "thus , to test this assumption it is interesting to look at the amount of mass accreted by the ice giants during our calculations .",
    "the colors in figure  [ fig_final1m]a and figure  [ fig_finalallm ] indicate the mass of the planet .",
    "we found that between 10% and 16% of the original disk mass is accreted by the ice giants in our @xmath94 m runs .",
    "the amount of embryo growth increases monotonically with disk mass .",
    "the ice giants in the @xmath192 run only accreted a total of @xmath193 of planetesimals , while they grew roughly by a total of @xmath194 in the @xmath190 simulation run .",
    "the planets in this run are probably too large to be considered good uranus and neptune analogs .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the more massive the disk , the more excited the final system of ice giants is .",
    "we think that this is due to the fact that the more massive disks produce larger planets , which , in turn , produce stronger mutual perturbations , and thus stability is achieved only with wider orbital separations .",
    "4.5truein    we now turn our attention to the @xmath94 cm runs  the results of which are shown in figure  [ fig_finalallcm ] . the same basic dynamics that we discussed above work with these systems and we get the same basic results .",
    "this includes the fact that jupiter and saturn went unstable in the @xmath188 run .",
    "the main difference between the @xmath195 runs here and those in the @xmath94 m is that in these runs the ice giants accreted much more of the disk material . for example",
    ", the ice giants in the @xmath190 run accreted a total of @xmath196 of planetesimals in the @xmath94 cm run , while they accreted @xmath194 in the @xmath94 m simulation .",
    "this is probably due to the fact that , at least at early times , collisions between the disk particles are more frequent and thus the system remains cooler . as a result , the gravitational focusing factor of the ice giants remains larger so that the accretion rate is higher . as a consequence ,",
    "the final ice giant systems that we obtain in these runs are , for the same initial disk mass , more excited and spread out than those constructed in the @xmath94 m simulations ( figure  [ fig_finalallm ] ) .    in response to the large accretion rates in our @xmath94 cm",
    "runs , we decided to push our simulation back to an earlier time in order to determine if we can produce ice giants on the order of the same size as uranus and neptune for this value of @xmath19 .",
    "in particular , our systems started with five embryos of @xmath197 each .",
    "the orbits of the embryos and the geometry of the disk was the same as in our previous integrations .",
    "we preformed 4 simulations with @xmath198 , 85 , 128 , and @xmath199 .",
    "as with the previous cases , the orbits of jupiter and saturn became unstable in the high disk mass .",
    "the final systems are shown in figure  [ fig_finalallsm ] .",
    "the planets grew , their orbits spread .",
    "the final systems always had a planet well beyond @xmath15au .",
    "finally , in this section we briefly study the growth of the ice giants from much smaller planetary embryos .",
    "our goal here is to make sure that the initial conditions used above were not artificial in some respect .",
    "that is , given the order - of - magnitude nature of g04 s arguments , perhaps we start the above calculations in the wrong state . for example , in all the above runs , we started with ice giants , as suggested by c06 .",
    "however , perhaps the natural system should contain such objects , rather than five , and then the system might evolve as c06 suggested . thus , in this section we present simulations where we start with small planetary embryos and let the system evolve naturally . unfortunately , these simulations are computationally expensive and thus we can only perform a couple of test cases .    in particular , our systems started with 6 embryos of @xmath200 each , spread from 21 to @xmath201au .",
    "the initial eccentricities and inclinations of these particles are very small ( @xmath202 ) .",
    "these objects were embedded in a disk of 18,000 tracer particles spread from 20 to @xmath15au , with a total mass of @xmath203 .",
    "two simulations were done , one with @xmath204 m and one with @xmath204 cm .    performing a computation with 18,000 tracer particles",
    "is very cpu intensive .",
    "we needed such a large number of tracers to adequately resolve the dynamical friction between the tracers and embryos , which , as we explained above , requires that @xmath205 .",
    "however , as the embryos grow , such a large number of tracers were no longer needed .",
    "thus , our plan was to continue the integrations until the average embryo mass was @xmath93 , after which we would remove out of every tracer particles at random while keeping the total mass of tracers constant .",
    "4.0truein    figure  [ fig_s4_mass ] shows the temporal evolution of the average embryo mass in both the simulations .",
    "the dotted curve is from the @xmath94 m .",
    "note that the growth rate is very small  the average mass of the embryos at @xmath206myr was only @xmath207 .",
    "in addition , during the last @xmath208 years of the simulation , the growth rate was only @xmath209 .",
    "we terminated the simulation at this point because it was clear that this simulation was no going to produce uranus- and neptune - sized planets fast enough .",
    "this is true because uranus and neptune , their ice giant status notwithstanding , do each have several @xmath17 of h and he in their atmospheres .",
    "the most natural way to account for this is if these planets finished their accretion in @xmath210 years , before the gas nebula was completely depleted ( haisch , lada & lada 2001 ) .",
    "as figure  [ fig_s4_mass ] shows , however , the @xmath94 cm runs , indeed , produce reasonable uranus and neptune analogs within @xmath41myr .",
    "in fact , by this time , the embryos have an average mass of @xmath211 .",
    "the final system is shown in figure  [ fig_s4_m_final ] . at @xmath141myr ,",
    "this run has four ice giants ranging in mass from 10.6 to @xmath212 .",
    "recall that the system started with six embryos .",
    "there were two mergers that reduced the number to four .",
    "thus , none of the ice giants were ejected .",
    "two of the resulting planets have semi - major axes beyond the current orbit of neptune .",
    "of particular note is the @xmath213 ice giant on an orbit with a semi - major axis of @xmath214au and an eccentricity of 0.01 .",
    "this system suffers from another problem as well .",
    "less than 50% of the tracers were accreted by the planets .",
    "thus , there is still @xmath215 of material concentrated in narrow rings through the outer planetary system .",
    "c06 has recently proposed a new and innovative scenario for the primordial sculpting of the kuiper belt .",
    "the idea is based on a recent pair of papers , g04a and g04b , that , based on order - of - magnitude analytic arguments , predicted that originally planets began to grow between @xmath2 and @xmath3au . as these planets grew to masses of @xmath4",
    "their orbits went unstable , of them were ejected , leaving uranus and neptune in their current orbits .",
    "c06 argued that this violent process could explain the .",
    "like g04 , the c06 scenario was not tested with numerical simulations , but was solely supported by back - of - the - envelope analytic estimates .    therefore , here we presented a series of integrations intended to simulate numerically c06 s scenario .",
    "we performed 12 simulations starting at the stage where the 5 ice giants are predicted to become unstable . in these simulations we varied the mass contained in the background disk , the size of the disk particles ( either @xmath26 m or @xmath26 cm ) , and the initial mass of the ice giants .",
    "we found that in the simulations in which the mass of the disk @xmath216 , the orbits of jupiter and saturn were not stable .",
    "contrary to g04 s conjecture , planetary ejection never occurs .",
    "instead , we found that the planetary systems spread and thus all our final systems contained a planet in an orbit far beyond the current orbit of neptune ( but still at a distance at which it would not escape detection ) .",
    "all our systems had at least one planet beyond @xmath10au .",
    "indeed , the semi - major axis of the outermost giant planet in these systems ranged from 52 to @xmath217au .    , we performed two simulations that initially contained six earth - mass embryos .",
    "one run had @xmath204 m , and the other had @xmath204 cm . in the @xmath204 m run ,",
    "the growth rates were too small to allow uranus - neptune analogs to form in a reasonable amount of time . however , four ice - giants with masses between 10.6 to @xmath212 formed in the @xmath204 cm run .",
    "the outermost of these had a semi - major axis of @xmath214au and an eccentricity of 0.01 .",
    "all the simulations we have performed show the same basic behavior  the system spreads during the growth and dynamical evolution of the ice giants .",
    "planetary ejections are rare .",
    "we believe these results are generic enough to be universal .",
    "therefore , we believe that it is safe to rule out the c06 s scenario for the sculpting of the kuiper belt , as well as g04 s scenario for the formation of uranus and neptune .    we think that the problem with g04 is not in the derivation of the various estimates , but rather in some of simplifying assumptions that they were forced to employ to make the problem analytically tractable .",
    "indeed , on microscopic , short - term , scales , we were able to reproduce much of the behavior that g04 predicted ( see  [ sec_code ] ) . in the case of the problem",
    "we address in this paper , g04 s assumption that the surface density of the disk particles remains smooth and uniform is probably at fault , since we find that the formation of rings and gaps actually dominates the dynamics .",

    "<S> chiang et al@xmath0  ( 2006 , hereafter c06 ) have recently proposed that the observed structure of the kuiper belt could be the result of a dynamical instability of a system of @xmath1 primordial ice giant planets in the outer solar system . </S>",
    "<S> according to this scenario , before the instability occurred , these giants were growing in a highly collisionally damped environment according to the arguments in goldreich et al@xmath0  ( 2004a , b , hereafter g04 ) . here </S>",
    "<S> we test this hypothesis with a series of numerical simulations using a new code designed to incorporate the dynamical effects of collisions . </S>",
    "<S> we find that we can not reproduce the observed solar system . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , g04 and c06 argue that during the instability , of the ice giants would be ejected from the solar system by jupiter and saturn , leaving uranus and neptune behind . </S>",
    "<S> we find that ejections are actually rare and that instead the systems spread outward . </S>",
    "<S> this always leads to a configuration with too many planets that are too far from the sun . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we conclude that both g04 s scheme for the formation of uranus and neptune and c06 s kuiper belt formation scenario are not viable in their current forms . </S>"
