    "cluster algebras were introduced by fomin - zelevinsky @xcite , and have been influential in many settings including algebraic combinatorics , lie theory , poisson geometry , teichmller theory , total positivity and quiver representations .    the first link to quiver representations and tilting theory for algebras was given in @xcite .",
    "cluster categories were defined in @xcite , giving a categorical model for cluster combinatorics . for type @xmath1 ,",
    "an independent approach was given in @xcite .",
    "a cluster algebra is in essence a commutative ring with a distinguished countable family of generators , called _",
    "cluster variables_. the cluster variables can be grouped into overlapping sets of equal finite size @xmath2 , called _ clusters_. any given cluster variable can be uniquely expressed as a rational function in the elements of a fixed initial cluster . by the laurent phenomenon , @xcite , these rational functions are actually laurent polynomials with integer coefficients .",
    "corresponding to each cluster there is a quiver @xmath3 , with @xmath2 vertices .",
    "the cluster algebra is said to be acyclic if it admits a cluster for which the corresponding quiver @xmath3 has no oriented cycles . in this case",
    "there is a corresponding finite dimensional hereditary algebra , the path algebra of @xmath4 ( for some field @xmath5 ) giving rise to a cluster category .    in @xcite",
    "a surjective map @xmath6 from the cluster variables of an acyclic cluster algebra to the exceptional indecomposable objects in the corresponding cluster category was given .",
    "in  @xcite a map was defined in the opposite direction , and it was shown that this map is a bijection with @xmath6 as inverse ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "our exposition is made in such a way that it is easy to see where the fact that @xmath6 is a bijection is used .",
    "an interesting property of the map @xmath6 from @xcite is the following .",
    "choose a cluster whose corresponding quiver is acyclic . if a cluster variable ( not from this cluster ) is expressed as a laurent polynomial in the cluster variables from this cluster there is a natural interpretation of the monomial in the denominator in terms of the composition factors of its image under @xmath6 ( regarded as a @xmath4-module ) .",
    "this generalized earlier results in this direction  @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to ask whether for an arbitrary choice of initial cluster it is possible to interpret the monomial in the denominator of a cluster variable in terms of the composition factors of the module ( over an appropriate cluster - tilted algebra ) corresponding to the image of the cluster variable under @xmath6 .",
    "the cluster - tilted algebra involved should be the endomorphism algebra of the cluster - tilting object @xmath7 obtained by forming the direct sum of the images of the fixed initial cluster under @xmath6 .",
    "we remark that such an interpretation has been found in the dynkin case in  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we give a precise answer to this question for the general case by giving necessary and sufficient conditions on the cluster - tilting object @xmath0 for this to hold .",
    "for a given acyclic cluster algebra , these conditions hold for all cluster - tilting objects @xmath0 in the corresponding cluster category if and only if the algebra is of finite cluster type or of rank 2 . in the tame case",
    "we show that a cluster - tilting object @xmath0 satisfies the conditions if and only if no indecomposable regular summand of @xmath0 has quasilength exactly one less than the rank of the tube in which it lies , and that this is equivalent to @xmath8 for each indecomposable summand of @xmath0 .",
    "in fact this last condition is necessary for any path algebra @xmath4 , and we conjecture that it is also sufficient in general .",
