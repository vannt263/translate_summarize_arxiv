    "classicalons_. although the existence and properties of classicalons have not been studied at all , it has been somehow suspected that they might form below the length scale called the _ classicalization radius _",
    "the classicalization radius is defined as the classical radius down to which high - energy shells of fields propagate essentially freely , without experiencing a significant correction from interaction .",
    "we can at least consider the condition @xmath0 as a necessary condition for the formation of classicalons .",
    "if classicalization really works then we would have to change our view of non - renormalizable field theories and wilsonian uv completion , in which a weakly coupled quantum field theory above the cutoff scale of an effective field theory is reconstructed by integrating - in some new degrees of freedom . in the classicalization approach ,",
    "a non - renormalizable field theory would unitarize itself by its own resources , above the scale that would otherwise be the uv cutoff of the theory .",
    "hence it is important to investigate the validity of the classicalization proposal .",
    "however , so far , the studies of the classicalization approach have been rather limited .",
    "one of the limitations is that all considerations in the literature assume perfect spherical symmetry .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study the classicalization proposal beyond spherical symmetry .",
    "unfortunately , we shall see that the above mentioned necessary condition ( [ eqn : classicalization - condition ] ) does not hold if spherical symmetry is significantly relaxed .",
    "thus , considerations in the present paper point towards the conclusion that classicalization does not serve as uv - completion for the class of non - renormalizable theories .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : review ] we shall briefly review the classicalization proposal .",
    "we shall also argue that classicalization does not serve as a way to uv complete the other classes of the field theories considered in the literature , except for the goldstone - type field theory .",
    "for this reason , we shall investigate the goldstone - type field theory in starting with sec .",
    "[ sec : non - spherical ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : non - spherical ] we consider a small non - spherical deformation and show that the classicalization radius tends to decrease in a region where a shell made of the field is slightly flattened . in sec .",
    "[ sec : planar - case ] , in order to describe a sufficiently large flattened region , we consider the high - energy collision of planar shells and show that the system never classicalizes before reaching sub - cutoff lengths .",
    "this no - go result is further strengthened by the analysis of a small non - planar deformation in sec .",

    "in the literature , the classicalization proposal has been studied for a scalar field without shift symmetry , a scalar field with shift symmetry ( goldstone - type field ) , and the graviton in general relativity . in this paper",
    "we shall investigate the robustness of the classicalization proposal for the theory of goldstone bosons . before going into further detail ,",
    "let us explain why we will not consider the other two cases .",
    "the example of the scalar field without shift symmetry has a lagrangian of the form @xmath2 in ref .",
    "@xcite , the second term on the right hand side was considered as a possible source of classicalization .",
    "however , one can redefine the field @xmath3 so that the sum of the first and the second terms becomes a canonical kinetic term of the new field @xmath4 .",
    "thus , the system is equivalent to a noninteracting canonical scalar field .",
    "the field redefinition does not work for @xmath5 , but in this regime @xmath6 has a wrong sign kinetic term and unitarity is violated .",
    "therefore , the first two terms in this lagrangian do not serve as a good example of classicalization .",
    "the graviton in einstein gravity has been considered as a possible candidate that exhibits the classicalization phenomenon  @xcite .",
    "however , it is well known that in general relativity , one can form a black hole with arbitrarily small mass  @xcite .",
    "therefore , in general relativity one can in principle probe arbitrarily short distances unless new physics above the cutoff scale somehow prevents one from doing so .",
    "therefore , classicalization is unlikely to work in general setups in general relativity .    in this paper",
    "we shall consider the goldstone - type field , i.e. a scalar field with shift symmetry , since this is the only remaining situation that has been studied in the literature so far .",
    "classicalization of the goldstone - type field was investigated in the euclidean path integral formulation in @xcite . however , the background solution is singular and the corresponding euclidean action is infinite .",
    "therefore , it seems rather difficult to extract any physically meaningful insights from the result of @xcite .",
    "for this reason , in the present paper we will not adopt the path integral formulation .",
