    "giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) are the sites where the majority of galactic star formation occurs , and hence it is important to understand their properties if we are to understand how star formation proceeds within our galaxy .",
    "the two most abundant chemical species in molecular clouds are molecular hydrogen ( h@xmath3 ) and atomic helium , and between them they are responsible for the vast majority of the mass of the clouds .",
    "however , neither of these species can easily be observed within molecular clouds , as the gas temperature is too low to excite their internal energy levels .",
    "observational studies of gmcs are therefore forced to focus on less abundant tracers that can be observed at typical gmc temperatures .",
    "the most popular such tracer is carbon monoxide ( co).co , the most abundant isotopologue . ]",
    "unfortunately , co is not without its problems as a molecular gas tracer . at high column densities ,",
    "the problem is one of opacity : the co rotational transitions start to become optically thick , breaking the relationship between co emission and column density ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "fortunately , this problem can be avoided to a large extent by observing less common isotopic variants of co , such as @xmath1co or c@xmath4o , which remain optically thin up to much higher column densities . at low column densities , on the other hand ,",
    "the problem is one of abundance : in low extinction regions , co is strongly photodissociated by the interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) , making it very difficult to observe any co emission from these regions ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , let alone to learn anything about the thermal state or kinematics of this gas .",
    "it is therefore worthwhile examining other possible tracers of the gas within molecular clouds .",
    "one particularly interesting possibility is neutral atomic carbon .",
    "spin - orbit coupling splits the atomic carbon ground state into three fine structure levels with total angular momenta @xmath5 , and forbidden transitions between these three levels give rise to two prominent fine structures lines : the [ ci ]  @xmath6 transition at 609  @xmath0 m ( hereafter written simply as the @xmath7 transition ) and the [ ci ]  @xmath8 transition at 370  @xmath0 m ( hereafter the @xmath9 transition ) .",
    "the energy difference between the @xmath10 and @xmath11 levels is only @xmath12  k , while between the @xmath13 and @xmath11 levels it is @xmath14  k. therefore , at typical molecular cloud temperatures of 1020  k , both of the fine structure lines can be excited .",
    "so far , however , neutral atomic carbon has attracted much less attention than co as a molecular cloud tracer .",
    "there are several reasons for this .",
    "observationally , the [ ci ]  lines are harder to study than the low @xmath15 rotational transitions of co : they typically have lower brightness temperatures , and are also situated in a wavelength regime where the effects of atmospheric absorption can be highly significant .",
    "theoretically , it was originally thought that neutral atomic carbon would be abundant only at the edges of clouds @xcite , limiting its usefulness as a tracer of the bulk of the cloud .",
    "subsequent observations have shown that this expectation is incorrect , and that [ ci ]  609  @xmath0 m emission is widespread within clouds @xcite , and yet the perception of [ ci ]  as a tracer of cloud surfaces has proved difficult to shift .    in the past few years , however , there has been renewed interest in the prospects of [ ci ]  as a molecular gas tracer .",
    "the champ+ and flash instruments on the apex telescope have allowed both [ ci ]  lines to be studied with reasonable sensitivity from one of the best sites on the planet , and alma will allow these lines to be studied with much greater sensitivity and angular resolution once bands 8 and 10 are commissioned . moreover , in the longer term , ccat will be able to rapidly map [ ci ]  emission over large areas of the sky with good sensitivity .",
    "the time is therefore ripe for an in - depth look at what [ ci ]  emission can tell us about molecular clouds , using state - of - the - art numerical simulations .    in this paper , we take the first steps towards this goal .",
    "we present results from a simulation of the chemical , thermal and dynamical evolution of a @xmath16 turbulent molecular cloud illuminated by the standard interstellar radiation field , and examine in detail how the neutral atomic carbon is distributed in this cloud .",
    "we also make synthetic emission maps of the resulting [ ci ]  lines , and investigate how much we can learn about the cloud by looking at this emission .",
    "although our focus in this paper is the detailed analysis of a single simulation , we plan to follow this up in future work with a much broader parameter study .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section  [ method ] , we present the numerical approach used to simulate the cloud and generate the synthetic emission maps .",
    "we also outline the initial conditions used for our simulation .",
    "our main results are presented in section  [ res ] , where we examine the chemical and thermal state of the gas in the cloud , and investigate what we can learn about the properties of the cloud from the [ ci ]  emission .",
    "finally , in section  [ conc ] we present our conclusions .",
    "the chemical and thermal evolution of the gas in our model cloud is simulated using a modified version of the gadget 2 sph code @xcite .",
    "our modifications include a simplified treatment of the gas chemistry , based on the work of @xcite and @xcite , and described in more detail in @xcite , a detailed atomic and molecular cooling function @xcite , and a treatment of the attenuation of the interstellar radiation field within the cloud using the treecol algorithm @xcite .",
    "the same code has previously been used to model star formation in molecular clouds with a variety of metallicities @xcite , the formation of gmcs from converging flows of atomic gas @xcite , and the thermal state of the dense galactic centre molecular cloud known as the `` brick '' @xcite .",
    "more extensive discussions of the numerical details of the code can be found in these references . here , in the interests of brevity , we focus only on a small number of changes that we have made to the code compared to the version described in these previous works .",
    "the most important change that we have made involves our treatment of co photodissociation .",
    "previously , this was based on the work of @xcite , but we have now updated our treatment to follow the recent paper by @xcite .",
    "comparison of runs performed with the old and new treatments of co photodissociation demonstrates that the main difference in behaviour is a sharpening of the transition between regions dominated by neutral atomic carbon and regions dominated by co , owing to the steeper dependence of the co photodissociation rate on the visual extinction , @xmath17 , found in the newer work",
    ".    another important change that we have made to the chemical model is the inclusion of the effects of cosmic - ray ionization of atomic carbon @xmath18 and cosmic - ray induced photodissociation of c and co @xmath19 @xmath20 these processes were not included in the version of the chemical model described in @xcite .",
    "the rates that we have adopted for processes  [ react1 ] and [ react2 ] are based on the values given in @xcite , but have been uniformly rescaled in order to be consistent with our adopted cosmic ray ionization rate .",
    "the rate for process  [ react3 ] comes from @xcite , and has been similarly rescaled .",
    "finally , we have also added a simple treatment of the chemistry of @xmath1co , using an approach similar to that in @xcite .",
    "specifically , we have extended the @xcite chemical network to also follow the abundances of @xmath1c@xmath21 , @xmath1c , @xmath1co and h@xmath1co@xmath21 . for simplicity",
    ", we assume that most of the reactions involving these species are not isotope - selective and hence adopt the same reaction rate coefficients for them as for their counterparts that involve @xmath22c .",
    "however , we also include the reaction @xmath23 together with the reverse reaction .",
    "the forward reaction is exothermic , and has a reaction rate coefficient @xmath24 , but the reverse reaction is endothermic and has a rate coefficient @xmath25 @xcite . in cold gas , this imbalance between the rates of the forward and reverse reactions leads to chemical fractionation , increasing the @xmath1co - to-@xmath22co ratio significantly above the elemental @xmath1c - to-@xmath22c ratio .",
    "in addition , we also account for the fact that in low extinction gas , it is easier to photodissociate @xmath1co than it is to photodissociate @xmath22co , owing to the greater effectiveness of co self - shielding in the latter case ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this effect counteracts the effects of fractionation to some extent , but in conditions typical of local molecular clouds or photodissocation regions , fractionation generally dominates @xcite .",
    "we post - process our simulation data to produce synthetic emission maps in the @xmath6 and @xmath8 fine structure lines of [ ci ]  and the @xmath26 line of @xmath22co and @xmath1co using the radmc-3d radiation transfer codedullemond / software / radmc-3d/ ] , and making use of atomic and molecular data ( transition energies , radiative transition rates , collisional excitation rate coefficients , etc . ) from the lamda databasemoldata/ ] @xcite .",
    "we calculate level populations using the large velocity gradient ( lvg ) approximation , as described in @xcite .",
    "radmc-3d can not presently deal with sph data directly , and so before we can use the code to generate our synthetic emission maps , we must first interpolate all of the necessary data to a cartesian grid .",
    "by default , we use a cubic grid with a side length of @xmath27 ( approximately 16  pc ) and a grid resolution of @xmath28 zones . in appendix",
    "[ radmc - resolution ] , we demonstrate that this grid resolution is sufficient to allow us to fully resolve the [ ci ]  emission produced by our model clouds .",
    "we use radmc-3d to produce full position - position - velocity ( ppv ) cubes , with a velocity channel width of @xmath29 , and then produce maps of velocity - integrated intensity based on these ppv cubes .",
    "our analysis in this paper focuses on these integrated intensity maps , and we defer any discussion of the velocity structure of the clouds , as traced by the [ ci ]  emission , to a future paper",
    ". we account for unresolved small - scale velocity structure in the clouds by including a microturbulent contribution of @xmath30 in the emission and absorption line - widths computed for each grid zone . in practice , this choice has little influence on our integrated intensity maps .",
    "finally , we note that for consistency with @xcite and with observational work in this field , we express the line intensities in terms of the brightness temperature , @xmath31 , computed using the rayleigh - jeans approximation @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the specific intensity and @xmath34 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "our velocity - integrated intensity maps therefore have units of @xmath35 .      in this paper",
    ", we focus on the detailed analysis of the [ ci ]  emission produced by a single model cloud .",
    "the model cloud we chose to study is very similar to one of the clouds studied in @xcite .",
    "we adopted a cloud mass of @xmath16 , which we simulated using two million sph particles , giving us a mass resolution of @xmath36 .. ] the cloud was initially spherical , with a radius of 6.3  pc , giving it an initial mean hydrogen nuclei number density of @xmath37 .",
    "the initial gas temperature was set to @xmath38  k and the initial dust temperature was set to 10  k , but as the cloud quickly relaxes to thermal equilibrium following the start of the simulation , our results are not sensitive to these particular choices .",
    "we imposed a turbulent velocity field on the clouds , with a power spectrum @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the wavenumber .",
    "the rms velocity of the turbulence was @xmath41 , chosen so that the kinetic energy and gravitational energy of the cloud were initially equal .",
    "the turbulence was not driven during the simulation , but was instead allowed to freely decay .",
    "we simulated the cloud using vacuum boundary conditions , but applied an external pressure term using the technique described in @xcite to minimize the effects of the pressure gradient that would otherwise exist at the edge of the cloud .",
    "we stress that the cloud is gravitationally bound and so would collapse and form stars even if this external pressure term were absent .",
    "we took the metallicity of the cloud to be solar , with the standard local dust - to - gas ratio , and with total abundances of carbon-12 , carbon-13 and oxygen relative to hydrogen given by @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively @xcite .",
    "we also assumed that the cloud was initially atomic , with all of the carbon initially in the form of c@xmath21 .    for the strength and spectral shape of the interstellar radiation field",
    ", we used the results of @xcite in the ultraviolet and @xcite at longer wavelengths .",
    "the cosmic ray ionization rate for atomic hydrogen was set to @xmath45 , and the corresponding ionization rates for the other chemical species were scaled accordingly , as described in section  [ hydro ] above .",
    "we halted the simulation as soon as the first gas reached a density above our maximum density threshold @xmath46 .",
    "this density is too high to be reached purely by turbulent compression given our choice of rms turbulent velocity , and finding gas at this density therefore indicates that one or more cores have entered runaway gravitational collapse and will shortly begin forming stars .",
    "we found that this occurred at a time @xmath47 after the beginning of the simulation .",
    "in this section , we analyze the physical state of the cloud and the [ ci ]  emission that it produces . our analysis is carried out at @xmath48 , immediately before the onset of star formation in the cloud .",
    "we start by briefly examining the chemical and thermal state of the cloud ( section  [ chemtherm ] ) , before going on to examine how much of the cloud is traced by [ ci ]  emission ( section  [ how ] ) .",
    "we next examine how well we can estimate the [ ci ]  excitation temperature based on our synthetic emission maps ( section  [ calc_tex ] ) .",
    "finally , we explore the usefulness of [ ci ]  emission as a column density tracer in section  [ column ] , and compare it with another commonly - used column density tracer , @xmath1co , in section  [ 13co ] .      in the upper left panel of figure  [ rhotemp ]",
    ", we show the two - dimensional probability density function ( pdf ) of the gas temperature @xmath49 and the hydrogen nuclei number density @xmath50 in our model cloud at a point just before the onset of star formation .",
    "several distinct features are apparent . at low densities",
    ", there is a strong inverse relationship between density and temperature .",
    "this corresponds to the part of the cloud that is optically thin to the ultraviolet portion of the isrf .",
    "cooling in this region is dominated by c@xmath21 fine structure line emission , while heating comes primarily from the photoelectric effect .",
    "as the density increases , the balance between these two processes shifts in favour of cooling , leading to a drop in the temperature , as noted in a number of previous studies ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    above a number density @xmath51 ,",
    "the cloud temperature becomes largely independent of the density , although since there is considerable scatter in the temperature in this regime , it is somewhat misleading to describe the gas as isothermal .",
    "this scatter is related to the large scatter in the effective extinction seen by different regions of the gas that have similar densities ( see figure  [ rhoav ] ) , which leads to substantial variations in the efficiency of photoelectric heating , as well as in the chemical state of the gas . one notable feature in this regime is the distinct bump in the temperature distribution at @xmath52 and @xmath53  k , caused by h@xmath3 formation heating @xcite .",
    "finally , at @xmath54 , the scatter in the gas temperature largely disappears , and the temperature once again begins to decrease with increasing density .",
    "this feature corresponds to the point at which the gas and dust temperatures become strongly coupled , owing to efficient thermal energy transfer between the gas and the dust . above this density ,",
    "the gas temperature closely tracks the dust temperature .",
    "since the dust temperature is unaffected by velocity gradients within the gas and varies only weakly with @xmath17 owing to the steep temperature dependence of the dust cooling rate ( @xmath55 ) , most of the scatter in the temperature distribution disappears once we enter this regime .",
    "if we now look at the remainder of the panels in figure 1 , which illustrate the chemical state of the carbon in the gas as a function of temperature and density , we see that as we move to higher densities , we move from a regime dominated by c@xmath21 to one in which neutral atomic carbon dominates , and then finally to a co - dominated regime .",
    "neutral atomic carbon is present at a variety of different densities in the range @xmath56 , but becomes very rare at higher densities , where almost all of the available carbon is locked up in co.    in addition , it is clear that there is little neutral atomic carbon present in the warmer gas with @xmath57  k. this is easy to understand , as temperatures @xmath57  k are found only in regions where the extinction is low , so that photoelectric heating is effective , and in these regions , photoionization of c to c@xmath21 occurs rapidly .",
    "it is also interesting to look at how the chemical state of the gas varies as a function of extinction .",
    "however , in this case we need to be careful about how we quantify the extinction .",
    "a common choice is to work in terms of the line - of - sight value , which we will denote in this paper simply as @xmath17 .",
    "although this choice is simple , and is the same as the definition that we would use observationally , it is less than ideal when one is considering a turbulent cloud , as there is no guarantee that the extinction in other directions has much to do with the extinction along our particular line - of - sight . as an extreme example , consider the case where we happen to be looking along the long axis of a filament : we would see a high extinction , even though the extinction in directions perpendicular to the filament may be small .             a better way to quantify",
    "the amount of extinction seen by a particular sph particle is by means of a weighted sum over many different lines of sight from that particle to the edges of the cloud .",
    "fortunately , this is precisely the information that our treecol algorithm provides . as explained in more detail in appendix  [ treecol_res ] and in @xcite , the treecol algorithm provides us with a @xmath58 steradian map of the column density distribution surrounding each of our sph particles .",
    "each of these column density distributions is discretized using the healpix pixelation scheme , so that every sph particle has a column density map associated with it consisting of @xmath59 equal - area `` sky '' pixels .",
    "we can use these column density maps to define an effective visual extinction , @xmath60 , for each sph particle with the help of the following expression : @xmath61.\\ ] ] here , @xmath62 is the extinction corresponding to the column density in the direction defined by `` sky '' pixel number @xmath63 , and for each sph particle , we sum over its @xmath59 associated `` sky '' pixels .",
    "our choice of weighting factor is motivated by the fact that the co photodissociation rate scales with the visual extinction as @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "however , we have also explored the effects of using a smaller weighting factor of 2.5 ( motivated by the fact that the photoelectric heating rate scales with @xmath17 as @xmath65 ; see e.g.@xcite ) but find that in practice our results are not particularly sensitive to this choice .",
    "finally , we also include in our estimate a term @xmath66 , corresponding to extinction arising within the gas represented by the sph particle itself ( which is not included in our treecol calculation ) .",
    "we assume that this local contribution is proportional to the product of the local density and the smoothing length of the sph particle .    in figure  [ rhoav ] ,",
    "we show how the chemical state of the gas varies as a function of density and @xmath60 .",
    "we see that although density and effective extinction are correlated , there is significant scatter in the relationship , particularly at low densities",
    ". this scatter can amount to as much as an order of magnitude variation in @xmath60 at a given density , and since photochemical rates typically depend exponentially on @xmath60 , the scatter in their values at a given density can be far larger ( c.f .",
    "@xcite , who find a similar result for turbulent clouds without self - gravity ) .",
    "figure  [ rhoav ] also shows us that c@xmath21 dominates in the region with @xmath67 , as we would expect given the effectiveness of carbon photoionization at low @xmath60 .",
    "there is also some neutral atomic carbon in this region , but very little co. neutral atomic carbon begins to take over from c@xmath21 above @xmath68 , peaking at @xmath693 , and then declining at higher extinctions as co starts to dominate .",
    "we see , therefore , that the behaviour of c@xmath21 , c and co in our turbulent clouds is very similar to that seen in 1d pdr cloud models , which find a similar layering as one moves from low to high extinctions .",
    "the main differences here are the much larger scatter that we have in the turbulent case , owing to the scatter in the @xmath50-@xmath60 relationship , and the fact that the regions with @xmath693 where c dominates are not found only at the edges of the cloud , but instead are distributed throughout the cloud .",
    "( solid line ) , plotted as a function of @xmath50 .",
    "we also show the cumulative atomic carbon mass fraction ( dotted line ) , i.e.the fraction of the total amount of atomic carbon located at or below @xmath50 , plotted as a function of @xmath50 .",
    "the vertical dashed line indicates the critical density of the [ ci ]  @xmath7 transition , computed assuming that all of the hydrogen is in molecular form , and that the gas temperature is 20  k. the vertical dot - dot - dot - dashed line indicates the critical density for the @xmath9 transition , computed with the same assumptions .",
    "[ cumul_dense],width=316 ]    it is also useful to quantify how much of the total mass of neutral atomic carbon in the cloud is located at each density and temperature . in figure  [ cumul_dense ] , we show how the mass of the cloud below a density @xmath50 varies as we vary @xmath50 .",
    "we see that the majority of the gas is located in the density range @xmath70 , with less than 10% to be found at higher or lower densities .",
    "we also show in this figure the same quantity for the neutral atomic carbon , i.e.how much of the total mass of c is located below a density @xmath50 for a range of different values of @xmath50 .",
    "this follows the line for the total gas mass quite closely , although the fraction of the mass of neutral carbon at @xmath71 is a little smaller than the fraction of the total mass at these densities , since this lower density material contains significant amounts of c@xmath21 .",
    "if we compare the distribution of the neutral carbon with the critical densities for the @xmath7 and @xmath9 transitions ( illustrated by the vertical lines ) , we see that roughly 60% of the carbon is located below the critical density for the @xmath7 transition and roughly 80% is located below the critical density for the @xmath9 transitions .",
    "the values for the critical densities plotted here were computed assuming a gas temperature of 20  k , but in practice have little dependence on the temperature .",
    "we can therefore conclude that if the [ ci ]  emission is optically thin , much of it will be sub - thermal , meaning that analyses that assume local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) level populations for the carbon may give misleading results .",
    "we will return to this point in section  [ calc_tex ] below .",
    "( solid line ) , plotted as a function of @xmath49 .",
    "we also show the cumulative atomic carbon mass fraction ( dotted line ) as a function of @xmath49 .",
    "[ cumul_temp],width=316 ]    finally , it is also interesting to perform a similar analysis for the cumulative mass fractions of total gas and neutral atomic carbon as a function of temperature .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ cumul_temp ] .",
    "we see that almost half of the total gas mass is located in the temperature range @xmath72  k , and that there is almost no gas with @xmath73 or @xmath74 .",
    "we also see that , once again , the result for the neutral carbon closely tracks that for the total gas mass .",
    "we saw in the previous section that the range of densities containing most of the neutral atomic carbon is very similar to the range of densities containing the bulk of the cloud s mass .",
    "moreover , although most of the atomic carbon is found in gas with densities below the critical densities for the @xmath7 and @xmath9 transitions , it does not lie very far below @xmath75 .",
    "therefore , although we expect the emission to be sub - thermal , it will not be strongly sub - thermal .",
    "furthermore , the neutral atomic carbon is found primarily in gas with temperatures in the range @xmath76  k , and these temperatures are high enough to excite the @xmath7 transition relatively easily .    taken together",
    ", these factors suggest that [ ci ]  emission should be a good tracer of the gas in the cloud .",
    "to investigate whether this is the case , we have used radmc-3d to make maps of the velocity - integrated intensity of the [ ci ]  @xmath7 and @xmath9 lines produced by the cloud .",
    "these are shown in figure  [ cloud_maps ] , together with the cloud column density and the integrated intensity in the @xmath22co @xmath77 transition .",
    "we see that there is a good correlation between the structure that we see in the column density map and in the [ ci ]  @xmath7 emission map .",
    "the [ ci ]  emission traces most of the structure down to a total hydrogen column density of approximately @xmath78 , but does not pick out the low density gas at the edges of the cloud . comparing this map with the co emission map , we see that both tracers pick out the same basic cloud structure , but that [ ci ]  appears to do a slightly better job close to the edges of the cloud .",
    "the [ ci ]  @xmath9 emission also seems to be a good tracer of cloud structure in the denser regions , but becomes extremely faint towards the edges of the cloud .",
    "the widespread [ ci ]  emission that we see in our map is very different from the limb - brightened emission predicted by simple 1d pdr models , but is qualitatively consistent with the predictions of clumpy pdr models and with observations of [ ci ]  in real gmcs , which typically find a good correlation between the [ ci ]  and co emission ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is a testament to the central role that turbulence plays in structuring the cloud .",
    "as we have already seen , the neutral atomic carbon in our model cloud is found at a similar range of effective visual extinctions to those that we would expect based on pdr model results .",
    "the key difference is that gas with this effective extinction is not located in a single coherent structure at the edge of the cloud .",
    "because of the turbulent motions , the cloud is highly structured , allowing radiation to penetrate deep into the interior ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the [ ci ]  emitting surfaces that we see are therefore found throughout the cloud and are present along most lines - of - sight . the crucial role that density substructure within gmcs plays in explaining the observed [ ci ]",
    "emission has been understood for some time ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and our results strongly support this picture .    having established that the [ ci ]  @xmath7 line appears to be a promising gas tracer , the next step is to quantify what fraction of the molecular gas in the cloud it allows us to observe .",
    "a simple starting point is to compute what fraction of the total h@xmath3 mass is found along lines - of - sight with [ ci ]  integrated intensities greater than some minimum value @xmath79 , and then to look at how this value changes as we vary @xmath79 .",
    "the results of this analysis are shown in figure  [ cumul_emission ] , together with similar results for the [ ci ]  @xmath9 line , the @xmath22co @xmath26 line and the @xmath1co @xmath26 line .",
    "mass in the cloud traced by the [ ci ]  @xmath7 transition ( black solid line ) and the @xmath9 transition ( red solid line ) , plotted as a function of the minimum integrated intensity in the line .",
    "the same quantity is also shown for the @xmath22co @xmath26 transition ( upper blue dashed line ) and the @xmath1co @xmath26 transition ( lower blue dashed line ) .",
    "[ cumul_emission],width=316 ]    we see that for all of the lines , the fraction of the cloud that we detect is a strong function of the minimum integrated intensity . in the case of [ ci ]",
    "@xmath7 , almost 80% of the molecular mass of the cloud is located along lines of sight with integrated intensities in the narrow range @xmath80 . in the case of the [ ci ]  @xmath9 line , we see similar behaviour , but the minimum integrated intensity required in order to detect any given amount of the molecular gas",
    "is typically at least a factor of a few smaller .",
    "if we compare this with the behaviour of @xmath22co , we see that if our minimum integrated intensity for both lines is greater than @xmath81 , then @xmath22co is a superior tracer of the molecular mass .",
    "only once we start to look along very faint sight - lines does the [ ci ]  emission start to trace regions that would be unobserved in @xmath22co . for @xmath1co ,",
    "the story is rather different . for integrated intensities greater than around @xmath82 ,",
    "the behaviour of the @xmath1co @xmath26 line and the [ ci ]  @xmath7 line are very similar . at lower integrated intensities , the [ ci ]",
    "line becomes the better tracer , allowing one to study the 1520% of the molecular mass of the cloud that is not well traced by @xmath1co .      as a first step towards quantifying the properties of the [ ci ]  emission produced by our model cloud , we investigate in this section how accurately one can infer the excitation temperature of the carbon atoms based on the synthetic emission maps .",
    "for an atomic or molecular system with a lower energy level @xmath83 and an upper energy level @xmath84 , we can define an associated excitation temperature @xmath85^{-1},\\ ] ] where @xmath86 and @xmath87 are the fractional level populations of the lower and upper levels , @xmath88 and @xmath89 are the associated statistical weights of these levels , and @xmath90 is the energy separation between the two levels . in the case of neutral atomic carbon",

    "if the carbon is not in lte , however , then the excitation temperatures may differ from each other . because the critical densities of the @xmath7 and @xmath9 transitions are quite similar , it is often assumed that the excitation temperatures corresponding to these transitions are equal , but as we will see below , this is not always a safe assumption .",
    "one common technique for estimating @xmath92 from maps of [ ci ]  emission involves the assumption that the [ ci ]  lines are optically thin and that the contribution of the isrf ( including the cmb ) at the frequencies of the [ ci ]  lines can be neglected ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    ", we show the results obtained using these two approaches . in both cases , we restrict the region plotted to the set of sight - lines with @xmath99 . by enforcing this restriction , we avoid the poorly resolved regions at the edge of the cloud that are too faint in [ ci ]  to be observable with current instruments .",
    "we see from this figure that equation  [ tx_sch ] predicts values for @xmath92 of around 1520  k , with significantly higher values of up to 40  k along the lines of sight passing through the densest gas .",

    "we then compute a weighted mean value along each sight - line , using the local number density of atomic carbon as our weighting function : @xmath104 where we sum over all cells along a line of sight .",
    "comparison of the different maps shows that both of our approximations give biased views of @xmath92 .",
    "equation  [ tx_sch ] predicts excitation temperatures that are systematically too large , particularly for the densest lines of sight . at low column densities ,",
    "this error comes about because equation  [ tx_sch ] is actually a measure of the excitation temperature associated with the @xmath9 transition .",
    "although this is often assumed to be the same as the excitation temperature associated with the @xmath7 transition , we find that in practice the two excitation temperatures differ by several k in much of the [ ci ]  emitting gas . towards dense regions ,",
    "the performance of equation  [ tx_sch ] becomes even worse because of its neglect of the effects of line opacity . if one or both of the [ ci ]  lines becomes optically thick , then the ratio of integrated brightness temperatures for the two transitions is no longer proportional to the ratio of the column densities of the @xmath93 and @xmath94 level , and hence equation  [ tx_sch ] is no longer valid .",
    "if the @xmath9 transition becomes optically thick while the @xmath7 transition remains optically thin , then this leads to an underestimate of @xmath105 and hence and underestimate of the excitation temperature . in the far more likely case",
    "that the @xmath7 transition becomes optically thick while the @xmath9 transition remains optically thin ( see appendix  [ op_depths ] ) , then we overestimate @xmath105 and hence overestimate @xmath92 , potentially by a large amount .",

    "it is also interesting to compare the excitation temperature of the gas with the actual kinetic temperature .",
    "since we are observing the cloud in projection , our observations inevitably involve some degree of averaging of temperatures along each line of sight .",

    "are related by @xmath171 , where @xmath172 is the fractional abundance of atomic carbon weighted by mass and averaged along the line of sight . the mass - weighted average for the cloud as a whole",
    "is given by @xmath173 , but as we have already seen , the local abundance is not constant , but instead varies as a function of density and position in the cloud .    in figure  [ xci_av ] ,",
    "we show how @xmath172 varies as a function of the visual extinction .",
    "we see that there is a systematic increase in the mean abundance as we move to higher extinctions .",
    "this is particularly pronounced around @xmath174 , where we first start to probe regions that are well - shielded from the isrf , but even at much higher @xmath17 we still see an increase . using the mean value for the whole cloud as",
    "a proxy for @xmath172 is a reasonable approximation only for visual extinctions @xmath175 a few , but would lead one to significantly underestimate the total column density along diffuse lines of sight and overestimate it along dense sight - lines .",
    "moreover , @xmath176 is not an observable quantity ( unless the total column density of the cloud is already known ) , but must instead be estimated using a chemical model of the cloud , such as that included in our hydrodynamical simulation .",
    "this introduces yet more uncertainty into the final column density estimate , and leading us to conclude that this technique for estimating @xmath170 is likely in practice to be much less accurate than simply using the correlation between @xmath108 and @xmath17 discussed in the previous section .",
    "we have seen in the previous sub - sections that there are some interesting similarities between [ ci ]  @xmath7 emission and @xmath1co @xmath26 emission .",
    "both tracers are optically thin for a broad range of visual extinctions , and both trace a very similar fraction of the cloud mass when we restrict our attention to regions where the integrated intensity exceeds a few k  km  s@xmath177 .",
    "it is therefore worthwhile to directly compare these two tracers in more detail , so that we can better understand their strengths and weaknesses .                in figure",
    "[ ratio_maps ] , we examine how the integrated intensity ratio @xmath178 varies over the cloud . in the left - hand panel ,",
    "we compute this ratio only for lines - of - sight for which both @xmath108 and @xmath127 exceed @xmath179 .",
    "we see that within this region , @xmath180 is surprisingly uniform with a value close to one .",
    "this behaviour is in good agreement with observations of the [ ci]-to-@xmath1co intensity ratio in real clouds ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that often show almost uniform ratios .",
    "it is also clear that @xmath180 starts to increase towards the edge of the cloud , but the restriction of the image to regions with @xmath1co emission above our @xmath179 threshold acts to obscure how large @xmath180 can grow as we move towards the edge of the cloud .",
    "therefore , in the right - hand panel of figure  [ ratio_maps ] , we show how @xmath180 behaves when we remove this restriction .",
    "the colour scale is chosen to emphasize the change in @xmath180 at the edge of the cloud , although for practical reasons we limit the maximum displayed value to @xmath181 . comparing the two maps",
    "allows one to see very clearly the envelope of gas around the co - bright portion of the cloud that is well - traced by [ ci ]  but not by @xmath1co .",
    "it is also interesting to explore how well we can reconstruct the column density distribution of the cloud using these two tracers . in figure  [ recon]a , we show a column density map of the cloud that we have constructed using the empirical relationship between @xmath108 and @xmath17 given in equation  [ emp_fit ] , which we have already seen gives a good description of the relationship between [ ci ]  emission and dust extinction for lines of sight with @xmath182 . in figure",
    "[ recon]b , we show a similar map , constructed using the empirical relationship @xmath183 which gives a similarly good description of the behaviour of the @xmath1co integrated intensity for lines of sight with @xmath184 . we have chosen to perform this comparison using these empirical fits , rather than making use of the more common strategy of first inferring the c ( or @xmath1co ) column density from the observed emission , and then inferring the total column density from the column density of our tracer , because the latter technique inevitably introduces additional sources of error , as we have already explored in some detail .",
    "the comparison in figure  [ recon ] is therefore in some sense a `` best case '' scenario  we are unlikely to actually be able to reconstruct the column densities as well in practice .    comparing these two reconstructed maps with the true column density map shown in figure  [ cloud_maps]a , we see that , as expected , [ ci ]  allows us to better reconstruct the column density distribution towards the edges of the cloud , although we still miss some of the lowest column density material . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath1co seems to do better at tracing the highest density peaks , some of which are hard to pick out from the background when using [ ci ] .",
    "finally , we have also examined how well [ ci ]  and @xmath1co trace the cloud velocity .",
    "we have computed cloud - averaged spectra for the [ ci ]  @xmath7 line and for the @xmath1co @xmath185 line , and have plotted these in figure  [ linewidth ] , along with a cloud - averaged spectrum for the @xmath22co @xmath26 transition .",
    "we see that the linewidth and strength of the [ ci ]  and @xmath1co are remarkably similar .",
    "this is unsurprising , since in both cases , the cloud - averaged spectra are dominated by the bright emission coming from the high density regions of the cloud , and hence are largely tracing the same material . the fact that the [ ci ]  emission does a better job of tracing the boundaries of the cloud does not greatly affect the average linewidth , as little of the total [ ci ]  emission is generated in these regions .",
    "finally , the much higher optical depth of the @xmath22co emission means that a larger fraction of the cloud contributes to the cloud - averaged spectrum , resulting in a much brighter line with a greater linewidth .    co @xmath26 ( solid line ) , @xmath1co @xmath185 ( dotted line ) and the [ ci ]  @xmath7 transition ( dashed line ) , averaged over the entire synthetic image .",
    "[ linewidth],scaledwidth=49.0% ]",
    "in this paper , we have examined in detail the distribution of neutral atomic carbon within a model of a turbulent molecular cloud illuminated by the standard local interstellar radiation field , and have also studied the [ ci ]  fine structure emission produced by these carbon atoms .",
    "we show that the density substructure created by the turbulence naturally leads to widespread , spatially extended [ ci ]  emission , in good agreement with observations of real molecular clouds .",
    "most of the neutral carbon in our model is located in gas with a density in the range @xmath186 , and with an effective ( angle - averaged ) visual extinction @xmath187 .",
    "this gas is relatively cold ",
    "around 80% of the neutral carbon is found in regions with @xmath188  k  and so [ ci ] , like co , is primarily a tracer of the cold , dense phase within molecular clouds , and not the warm , space - filling phase traced by [ cii ] .",
    "our results suggest that [ ci ]  @xmath7 emission is a promising tracer of low column density gas in molecular clouds .",
    "although it is easier to detect the molecular gas using @xmath22co emission than using [ ci ]  emission , the relationship between @xmath22co integrated intensity and the column density of the gas is highly non - linear , owing to the effects of co photodissociation at low @xmath17 and line opacity at high @xmath17 .",
    "one can avoid the worst of the opacity effects by using @xmath1co in place of @xmath22co , but the effects of photodissociation are not so easily overcome .",
    "we find that @xmath1co emission is a roughly linear tracer of column density for line - of - sight visual extinctions in the range @xmath128 , although we caution that the fact that we are neglecting co freeze - out onto dust grains may affect our results at high @xmath17 . in comparison ,",
    "the integrated intensity of the [ ci ]  @xmath7 line is a linear tracer of column density for visual extinctions in the range @xmath131 .",
    "observing [ ci ]  in place of @xmath1co therefore allows one to better study the gas with visual extinctions @xmath189 , which in practice accounts for around 20% of the total mass of the cloud .",
    "however , at @xmath184 , @xmath1co is as good a tracer of the cloud as [ ci ] , while also being significantly easier to observe .",
    "our results are consistent with previous work that has suggested that [ ci ]  emission is a good tracer of molecular gas ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although whether this is still true for clouds in other environments ( e.g.lower metallicities , higher radiation fields ) remains to be seen .",
    "we have studied several different ways of estimating the excitation temperature of [ ci ]  based on the observed emission .",
    "we find that the best results are obtained if we use the @xcite method for computing @xmath92 along sight - lines with integrated intensities @xmath109 and adopt a constant value of @xmath92 for the fainter sight - lines , derived by averaging the estimated values for the bright sight - lines .",
    "the resulting excitation temperatures are typically @xmath19013  k , and are generally smaller than the kinetic temperature of the emitting gas , indicating that most of the carbon atoms are not in local thermodynamic equilibrium .    using our estimate for @xmath92 , we can determine the column density of neutral atomic carbon , @xmath149 , with reasonable accuracy in the regime where @xmath149 is less than a few times @xmath156 .",
    "comparison of the true and estimated column densities shows that although the error along any particular line of sight may be as high as a factor of two , there is no systematic offset between the estimated and real values . at higher carbon column densities",
    ", however , our estimate becomes inaccurate because it neglects the effects of line opacity , and we start to significantly underestimate the true value of @xmath149 .",
    "we find that in practice , we typically miss about half of the total atomic carbon when using this procedure .",
    "we have also explored whether using the @xmath22co excitation temperature as a proxy for the [ ci ]  excitation temperature can allow us to better reconstruct @xmath149 in the optically - thick regime .",
    "we find that it does allow us to partially correct for the effects of opacity , although we still miss as much as a third of the total atomic carbon .",
    "we therefore recommend that if one wants to estimate @xmath149 based on observations of the [ ci ]  fine structure lines , then the following procedure should be adopted :    1 .",
    "determine the excitation temperature of the @xmath7 line of @xmath22co using equation  [ tx_co ] .",
    "2 .   using this excitation temperature as a proxy for that of [ ci ] , estimate the optical depth in the [ ci ]  @xmath7 transition using equation  [ tau_est ] .",
    "3 .   compute the column density of atomic carbon in the @xmath93 level , @xmath152 , using equations  [ fcorr ] and [ n1_corr ] .",
    "repeat steps 2 and 3 for the @xmath94 level , using the integrated intensity of the @xmath9 transition in place of that of the @xmath7 transition , and using @xmath191 , @xmath192 and @xmath193 in place of @xmath194 , @xmath195 and @xmath196 .",
    "use the excitation temperature estimate together with equation  [ tex_defn ] to compute the column density of carbon in the @xmath103 level .",
    "sum the column densities of the three levels to obtain the final estimate for @xmath149 .",
    "if , as is often the case , the atomic carbon column density is estimated without correcting for opacity effects and with the assumption that the levels have lte populations , then our study suggests that the resulting values could be in error by as much as a factor of two .",
    "a major limitation of our present study is the fact that we have restricted our attention to a single example of a turbulent cloud . in future work",
    ", we plan to examine a wider sample of clouds , and to explore whether [ ci ]  emission remains a good tracer of the h@xmath3 column density as we reduce the metallicity of the cloud and/or increase the strength of the ambient interstellar radiation field .",
    "it will also be interesting to explore how the ability of [ ci ]  emission to trace h@xmath3 changes over time as the cloud evolves , as we have seen in previous studies that the co emission from clouds that are in the process of forming can change quickly on a relatively short timescale .",

    "any numerical study of the physics of molecular clouds inevitably has to grapple with the issue of limited numerical resolution .",
    "computational limitations prevent us from running our models at arbitrarily high resolution , and so it is important to establish whether this limitation significantly affects the conclusions that we draw from our model clouds . in the present study ,",
    "there are three potential sources of resolution - dependence : the numerical resolution of the hydrodynamical model itself , the size of the cartesian grid used during our radiative transfer post - processing step , and the discretization of column densities in the column density maps generated by our treecol algorithm .",
    "we examine each of these in more detail below .",
    "the simulation that we have studied in detail here was performed using two million sph particles to simulate @xmath16 of gas .",
    "this gives a particle mass of @xmath197 , which corresponds to a mass resolution of @xmath36 , if we use the standard convention that any `` resolved '' structure must consist of at least 100 sph particles .",
    "we have previously shown that this resolution is sufficient to model the star formation rate within our turbulent cloud @xcite , but that the low mass end of the stellar initial mass function is not properly resolved .",
    "this suggests that the resolution is sufficient to model the formation of pre - stellar cores , but not sufficient to properly follow the fragmentation that occurs within them .",
    "as most of the [ ci ]  emission in our model comes from gas that is at lower densities than the density of a typical pre - stellar core , it is reasonable to assume that two million particles will give us sufficient resolution to accurately model this emission .    to verify this assumption",
    ", we have run a higher resolution simulation of the same cloud using 20  million sph particles .",
    "the higher computational cost of this simulation makes it impractical to run it for as long as our lower resolution simulation , and so we have compared the results from the two simulations at a time @xmath198  myr , corresponding to roughly 30% of a free - fall time .",
    "turbulence has already created significant density substructure by this point in the evolution of the cloud and substantial amounts of neutral atomic carbon are present .",
    "@xmath7 line , computed at a time @xmath198  myr after the beginning of the simulation .",
    "the solid line is for a run with two million sph particles , while the dot - dashed line is for a higher resolution run with 20 million sph particles .",
    "there is slightly more emission from regions with very high integrated intensities in the high resolution run , but otherwise the two pdfs are very similar .",
    "[ wci_hydro],width=316 ]    in figure  [ wci_hydro ] , we compare the probability density function of @xmath108 that we obtain in the two different simulations .",
    "the only real difference that is apparent is that the high resolution simulation produces slightly more emission at high values of @xmath108 than the low resolution simulation .",
    "this may be a result of the fact that in the high resolution simulation , we are better able to resolve the wings of the density pdf , and hence are capturing slightly more of the emission from dense , [ ci ]  bright gas .",
    "however , the effect is small , and the mean [ ci ]  integrated intensity changes by no more than around 5% .",
    "it is therefore safe to conclude that the results presented in this study are not sensitive to the limited hydrodynamical resolution of our simulation .",
    "a second possible source of resolution dependence comes from our post - processing procedure . as described in section  [ post ] , radmc-3d can not presently deal directly with sph data , and hence we must interpolate our data onto a cartesian grid before running the code .",
    "the results presented in section  [ res ] are all based on maps produced using a cubical grid with a side length of @xmath27 and a grid resolution of @xmath28 zones .",
    "we have examined the sensitivity of our results to the choice of grid resolution by performing a similar post - processing step using a resolution of only @xmath199 grid zones . in figure  [ radmc - test ]",
    "we compare the probability density function of @xmath108 that we obtain with the two different grid resolutions .",
    "we see that they are almost identical , suggesting that our results are insensitive to our choice of grid resolution .",
    "in fact , it is easy to understand why this is the case .",
    "the size of a zone in the @xmath28 case is around 0.06  pc .",
    "we can estimate the density at which our sph smoothing length becomes smaller than a single grid zone by writing it as @xmath200 , where @xmath201 is the number of neighbouring sph particles smoothed over , @xmath202 is the particle mass and @xmath203 , where @xmath204 is the sph smoothing length . in our calculations , @xmath205 , @xmath206 , and hence @xmath207 . if we now set @xmath208 , we find that @xmath209 , corresponding to a number density @xmath210 .",
    "this value is significantly higher than the [ ci ]  critical density , and figure  [ cumul_dense ] demonstrates that not only is most of the gas in our simulation found at densities below this , but so is most of the neutral atomic carbon .",
    "therefore , the dense regions that are not well - resolved by our @xmath28 grid contribute only a small fraction of the total [ ci ]  emission , and our failure to resolve these regions has little impact on our results .",
    "@xmath7 line .",
    "the two sets of results shown here were produced using different grid resolutions during the radmc-3d post - processing step .",
    "the solid line corresponds to a grid resolution of @xmath28 zones , while the dot - dashed line corresponds to a grid resolution of only @xmath199 zones .",
    "the pdf produced using the lower resolution grid is somewhat noisier , particularly in the tail of the distribution at low intensities , but other than this , there is not a significant difference between the two distributions .",
    "[ radmc - test],width=316 ]    we have also performed a similar analysis for our co emission maps ( see figure  [ radmc - test2 ] ) .",
    "once again , we find that our failure to resolve the highest density structures with our cartesian grid has little impact on our results .    , but for the @xmath22co @xmath26 line .",
    "once again , we see that our grid resolution is sufficient to capture the bulk of the emission .",
    "[ radmc - test2],width=316 ]      @xmath7 line .",
    "the solid blue line shows results from a simulation performed using @xmath211 healpix pixels in the treecol algorithm , while the dark blue dash - dotted line shows results from a simulation performed using @xmath212 healpix pixels .",
    "we see that the results are essentially indistinguishable .",
    "[ treecol - test],width=316 ]    the final area in which the effects of limited numerical resolution may make themselves felt is in our treatment of the attenuation of the interstellar radiation field within the cloud .",
    "we model this using the treecol algorithm @xcite .",
    "this algorithm provides us with an approximate 4@xmath213 steradian map of the column densities of hydrogen nuclei , h@xmath3 and co seen by each sph particle , discretized into a number of equal - area pixels using the healpix pixelation scheme @xcite .",
    "the healpix scheme involves splitting up the sphere into 12 equal - area base pixels , each of which can then be further sub - divided .",
    "the amount of sub - division can be quantified by @xmath214 , the number of pixels along each side of one of the base pixels ; the total number of pixels then follows as @xmath215 . in treecol , by default we sub - divide each of the healpix base pixels into four sub - pixels , and hence @xmath216 and @xmath211 .",
    "we have found in testing that this choice appears to give us the best balance between computational efficiency ( which argues for a small value for @xmath59 ) and accuracy ( which argues for a larger value ) .",
    "however , we have also investigated the extent to which our results depends upon this choice . in figure",
    "[ treecol - test ] , we compare the pdf of integrated intensity in the @xmath7 line of [ ci ]  that we obtain from our default run with the corresponding distribution produced by a run with @xmath217 and @xmath212 .",
    "we see that the results are essentially indistinguishable , justifying our decision to use a small value for @xmath59 .",
    "in this appendix , we examine whether there are any physical conditions in which the @xmath9 transition of [ ci ]  is optically thick while the @xmath7 transition remains optically thin .",
    "we can write the optical depth at line centre in a transition with upper state @xmath84 and lower state @xmath83 due to an absorber with physical size @xmath218 as @xmath219 where @xmath220 is the absorption coefficient for the transition and we integrate along the path of the light - ray through the absorber .",
    "the value of the absorption coefficient at the centre of the line can be written as @xmath221 \\phi(\\nu_{ul}),\\ ] ] where @xmath222 is the einstein coefficient for stimulated emission for the transition , @xmath223 and @xmath224 are the number densities of absorbers in the lower and upper states , @xmath88 and @xmath89 are the statistical weights of these two states , @xmath225 is the frequency of the transition at the centre of the line , and @xmath226 is the line profile function . in general , for weak transitions such as the fine structure lines of [ ci ] , doppler broadening provides the dominant contribution to @xmath226 , allowing us to write its functional form as @xmath227 where @xmath228 , @xmath229 is the doppler width of the line and @xmath230 is the doppler broadening parameter .",
    "its value at line centre is then simply @xmath231    if we assume , for simplicity , that the gas is isothermal , then @xmath232 is independent of our position along the light - ray and can be taken out of the integral , allowing us to write the optical depth of the transition as @xmath233 { \\rm d}s , \\\\ & = & \\frac{hc b_{ul}}{4 \\pi^{3/2 } b }   \\left[\\frac{g_{u}}{g_{l } } n_{l } - n_{u } \\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath234 and @xmath235 are the column densities of absorbers in the lower and upper states , respectively . using this expression , we can then write the ratio of the optical depth in the @xmath9 transition , @xmath236 , to the optical depth in the @xmath7 transition , @xmath237 , as @xmath238.\\ ] ] the statistical weights for the @xmath239 and 2 fine structure levels of atomic carbon are @xmath240 , @xmath241 and @xmath242 , and so we can also write this as @xmath243.\\ ] ] finally , since @xmath244 we have @xmath245.\\ ] ] evaluating this using data on the frequencies and spontaneous transition rates for the two transitions taken from the lamda database @xcite , we find that @xmath246.\\ ] ]    if we assume that all three fine structure levels of the carbon atom have their lte level populations , then using this expression , it is easy to show that @xmath247 for all temperatures @xmath248  k , and that in the limit of large temperatures , @xmath249 . if the level populations are instead significantly sub - thermal , then the optical depth ratio is much smaller .",
    "we therefore see that it is indeed possible for the @xmath9 transition of [ ci ]  to be optically thick while the @xmath7 transition remains optically thin , but that it requires rather unusual conditions : the gas must be hot , sufficiently dense that the level populations are close to lte , and must have a total column density of carbon such that @xmath250 . the last condition is particularly restrictive , as it implies that for any given combination of temperature and density , the range of carbon column densities that gives rise to a situation with @xmath251 and @xmath252 spans only a factor of two . for comparison , in our simulations , we find values of @xmath149 spanning almost three orders of magnitude . therefore , in most cases , either both lines will be optically thin , both will be optically thick , or the @xmath7 transition will be optically thick while the @xmath9 transition remains optically thin , with the last possibility being particularly likely when the excitation of the fine structure levels is sub - thermal .    in the particular case of the cloud modelled in this paper , we can be confident that we are never in a situation with @xmath251 and @xmath252 .",
    "as figure  [ rhotemp ] demonstrates , almost all of the atomic carbon is found in gas with @xmath248  k , and the little that is not is found at densities @xmath253 , and hence will be sub - thermally excited ."
