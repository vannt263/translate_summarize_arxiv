    "for many years , one of the focusses of string theory has been an attempt to find realistic compactifications which could potentially make contact with low - energy phenomenology .",
    "much of the original work on this subject dealt with compactifications of heterotic string theory .",
    "but the more recent understanding of non - perturbative string theory and the role of d - branes has allowed a shift of focus to type iia / b string compactifications .",
    "in particular , one of the current promising avenues for studying standard model embeddings in string compactifications are type ii intersecting brane models @xcite .    more recently , beginning with the surprising observation of a positive cosmological constant ,",
    "there have been increasing attempts to find string models which can match current cosmological observations and theories @xcite .",
    "particular attention has been paid to the question of how inflation can be realized in string constructions .",
    "most of the recently constructed models have been shown to be fine - tuned in one way or another through the well known supergravity @xmath1 problem .",
    "until now , there has been relatively little effort aimed at bringing together these two strains by constructing string models which admit standard model physics at low - energy , with potentials which can exhibit inflation in the early universe .",
    "one of the most common attempts to embed inflation in string theory arises in brane inflation @xcite . in the most recent realistic implementation of these models @xcite ( see @xcite for the most recent comparison to data ) , the inflaton is an open string scalar which describes the position of a ( anti)d3-brane which is moving down a warped throat .",
    "the standard model is assumed to arise from open - string dynamics involving d - branes in a different throat ( see @xcite for an early attempt at joining both stories together ) .",
    "this type of scenario could arise , for example , in a string model where the standard model arose from branes at a singularity which are separated in the bulk from the throat where inflation occurs . in an intersecting brane model scenario , however , it is not clear that one can describe the full standard model by branes confined to a throat . in most known constructions in type iib ,",
    "one is forced to use magnetized d9-branes ( d9-branes with worldvolume magnetic fields turned on ) as part of the visible sector in order to generate the sm gauge group and matter content models for which the sm sector contains no magnetized d9-branes .",
    "for these models , a d3-brane would only couple gravitationally .",
    "but for more general constructions , this seems not to be the case . ] . since this d9-brane wraps the full compact space",
    ", it can not be separated from the inflaton sector . the dual statement in iia brane models",
    "is that the branes in question are d6-branes wrapping 3-cycles on the compact space ; such 3-cycles generically intersect each other topologically , and so can not be separated .    in this work ,",
    "we describe a scenario for @xmath0-term inflation @xcite which seems to appear straightforwardly in intersecting brane models ( ibm ) . in this scenario ,",
    "the inflaton and waterfall fields appear as non - vectorlike ( bifundamental ) matter arising from strings stretching between different hidden sector branes .",
    "one of the basic difficulties in embedding @xmath0-term inflation in string theory is that we require a flat direction ( which is our inflaton ) , but at the same time require that all tachyonic (  waterfall \" ) directions which could lower the inflationary potential are given positive mass . in our context of type iia",
    "/ b ibm s , we naturally tend to find a large number of d - flat directions .",
    "one can see this simply by noting that if we have @xmath2 @xmath3 brane stacks then we have @xmath2 d - term equations .",
    "but since each of these brane stacks generically has non - zero topological intersection with the others , we have @xmath4 scalar fields in the d - term equations .",
    "our basic idea will be to separate out one @xmath3 , whose @xmath0-term potential will give us the inflationary potential v_inf ^d = g^2(|_+|^2 - |_-|^2 - ) ^2 , where @xmath5 is a fayet - illioupoulos term that will give us the necessary vacuum energy during inflation when @xmath6 .",
    "the remaining @xmath0-terms will form v_rest ^d = g_j^2(|s|^2 + _ i q_i |_i|^2 -_j)^2 + where the dots represents other terms of the same form as the first one , @xmath7 are various chiral matter with charge @xmath8 under this particular @xmath3 gauge group .",
    "we now seek a flat direction for @xmath9 which lifts tachyonic directions for @xmath10 via yukawa couplings of the type @xmath11 .",
    "hence we can give a large initial vev to @xmath12 ensuring that the mass squared of @xmath13 are positive .",
    "given enough @xmath7 fields we can ensure that there exists a flat direction for @xmath9 spanned by the fields @xmath12 and @xmath7 .",
    "our flat direction can thus naturally act as the inflaton , which will tend to roll to the origin as a result of the one - loop coleman - weinberg type potential . as the inflaton rolls to the origin , eventually the yukawa couplings will no longer lift the waterfall fields sufficiently .",
    "they will become tachyonic ( in our case @xmath14 will be the waterfall field ) and cause inflation to end ( as usual in @xmath0-term inflation ) .",
    "of course , one must worry that yukawa couplings could also lift the flat directions , but we will see that with some mild fine - tunings we can ensure that the superpotential contributions are planck - suppressed . what aids us in our quest is gauge invariance ; the fact that the inflaton and waterfall fields are charged under hidden - sector groups limits the types of couplings which we must worry about .",
    "this type of slow - roll inflation generically predicts a near gaussian red spectra ( @xmath15 ) with an inflationary scale of order of the gut scale .",
    "the inflaton vev is always lower than the planck scale ( which is necessary for a consistent compactification ) and therefore it predicts a negligible amount of tensor fluctuations .",
    "while the simplest model predicts the formation of cosmic strings with a tension that is in conflict with the current bounds , we argue that simple extension can make the cosmic string unstable .",
    "since this scenario is set in the context of ibm s , it offers a rich phenomenology and it is possible to tie in various phenomenological processes with the inflationary phase .",
    "in particular , we show that this scenario naturally admits a type of hidden sector baryogenesis , fed by tachyonic preheating at the end of inflation .",
    "we also note that it is possible to generate the neutrino masses via a see - saw mechanism at the end of inflation . as such",
    ", we believe our model is very minimalist as we use the phase transition at the end of inflation for multiple purposes .",
    "although our scenario seems to arise most naturally in intersecting brane models , it can be studied purely from a low - energy effective field theory point of view .",
    "in fact , we do not present a specific implementation of this model into string theory in this paper .",
    "instead we present the general conditions that a string theory vacua will have to satisfy in order not to spoil the inflationary epoch or the reheating era .",
    "we also discuss how moduli stabilization and the uplifting to a de sitter vacua might affect our inflationary scenario .",
    "since our potential is coming from the d - term instead of the f - term we expect that we are less sensitive to these issues but in the absence of a complete string theory model , we can not completely elucidate these questions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we start with a brief review of intersecting brane model constructions in section 2 .",
    "we then present a method to achieve d - term inflation in the hidden sector in section 3 with particular attention to various fine - tuning issues .",
    "finally , we show how one can use our high scale inflationary physics to solve other beyond standard model phenomenology which might be happening at that scale .",
    "in particular we describe how to achieve hidden sector baryogenesis with tachyonic preheating in section 4 and how one could generate the neutrino masses in section 5 .",
    "section 6 contains our conclusion .",
    "we begin with a compactification of type iia / b string theory to 4 space - time dimensions with @xmath16 supersymmetry and with all closed - string moduli fixed .",
    "there is considerable evidence suggesting that this objective can be achieved in both type iia and type iib by compactifying on an orientifolded calabi - yau 3-fold and turning various rr , nsns and/or geometric fluxes .",
    "we will not rely on any specific mechanism for fixing the moduli , however , and will simply assume that we are left with a 4d theory with @xmath16 susy and no moduli .    in known compactifications of this form , one",
    "is typically required to add in spacetime - filling d - branes in order to cancel rr tadpoles ( essentially , to cancel spacetime - filling charges inherent to the compactification , so that there are no net spacetime - filling charges which would violate gauss law ) . in type iia , these branes are d6-branes which fill spacetime and wrap 3-cycles on the 6d compactification manifold . the type iib version is related to this by t - duality ( equivalently , mirror symmetry on the cy 3-fold ) , in which the branes are most generally d9-branes with magnetic fluxes turned on , which generate lower brane charge ( and they appear commonly in known ibm constructions ) .",
    "we will focus on the type iia description , as the spectrum has a more geometric interpretation in that case .",
    "the open strings which begin and end on these d - branes will generate a low - energy gauge theory with chiral matter .",
    "strings which begin and end on a single stack of @xmath2 branes will provide the degrees of freedom of a @xmath17 gauge multiplet and @xmath18 gauge groups are also possible if the brane stack lies on an orientifold plane .",
    "in several examples in the literature , the gauge group rank @xmath2 is related to the number of branes in the brane stack by a non - trivial factor .",
    "this results from constructions in which the calabi - yau 3-fold arises in an orbifold limit , where some gauge degrees of freedom are projected out . at our level of generality",
    "we need not worry about this subtlety ; in all relevant examples there will exist a number of branes in a stack which would yield @xmath17 gauge group for any integer @xmath2 . ] .",
    "moreover , for any two branes @xmath19 and @xmath20 with gauge groups @xmath21 , there will be chiral multiplets transforming in the bifundamental arising from strings stretching between the two branes .",
    "the net number of such multiplets is given by the topological intersection number @xmath22 .",
    "as these branes wrap 3-cycles on the compact 6d space , any two branes will generically have non - zero topological intersection number , and thus will have net chiral matter transforming in the bifundamental .",
    "the intersecting brane models which are relevant for phenomenology have a set of  visible \" sector branes on which live a gauge theory with mssm gauge group ( or a basic extension thereof ) and with sm chiral matter content arising from strings stretching between different visible sector branes .",
    "there are several known constructions of models of this kind in both type iia and type iib . in general",
    ", these models will have additional branes beyond those which yield the sm gauge theory , the so - called  hidden sector . \"",
    "these branes appear generically because of the need to cancel the rr - tadpoles generated by the compactification ; there is no reason why  visible sector \" branes alone should generate precisely the charges needed to cancel these tadpoles , and in all known constructions additional branes are required .",
    "it is this hidden sector which will be relevant for the d - term inflation model which we discuss here .",
    "one might worry that the appearance of such generic chiral matter would create anomalies which would destroy the consistency of the compactification .",
    "in fact , the cancellation of rr and k - theory tadpoles is both necessary and sufficient to cancel all cubic anomalies@xcite .",
    "mixed @xmath3 anomalies can still arise and are generally cancelled by the green - schwarz mechanism .",
    "these mixed anomalies will play an important role in our proposed model of baryogenesis .",
    "there are many known ibms on different orientifolded cy 3-folds ( most commonly , @xmath23 ) .",
    "our interest is not in any particular model ; indeed , if intersecting brane models do provide a realistic description of the world , then the relevant ibm is likely not among the models already constructed .",
    "thus , our interest is in a scenario for inflation which can occur in a large class of such models . in particular",
    ", we will not constrain our ibms to match any particular scheme for moduli stabilization , or any preferred low - energy model of phenomenology , provided they can still match data . as we have mentioned , these ibm constructions naturally arise with @xmath16 supersymmetry , due to their origin as a string compactification .",
    "this supersymmetry is also relied on in some closed - string moduli stabilization schemes such as kklt @xcite to assure control of the potential ( though it is by no means clear that supersymmetry is necessarily required in all constructions to give good control over the potential @xcite ) .",
    "however , the breaking of supersymmetry and the applicability of supersymmetry to the hierarchy problem is an open question .",
    "one can certainly attempt to implement familiar types of supersymmetry breaking mediated to the visible sector in such a way as to generate a higgs mass which is naturally small .",
    "but other options have also drawn attention .",
    "attempts to match lep data to the mssm have led to the so - called little hierarchy problem , which suggests to some that perhaps an alternative to low - energy susy is required , and various mechanisms ( for example , the little higgs , twin higgs , environmental selection ,  stringy \" naturalness , etc.@xcite ) have been proposed to deal with the hierarchy without supersymmetry .",
    "we will be agnostic about all such claims ; we demand supersymmetry at the string and moduli scale for control of the potential , but will admit any supersymmetry breaking which arises below that scale .",
    "there has been much recent activity in working out models of the early universe and , in particular , models of inflation in string theory .",
    "most of the recent activity has been set in the context of type iib since , in this case , explicit constructions of de sitter vacua with all moduli stabilized have been worked out @xcite . in particular , a string theory implementation of d - term inflation has already been proposed in this context @xcite . in these models the inflaton field is the distance between a d3 and a d7 and the vacuum energy is provided by fluxes on the d7 . from a four dimensional view point , these fluxes generates a field dependent fi term . as the d3 brane get closer to the d7 brane , the open string stretching between them becomes tachyonic and inflation ends .",
    "one expects there to exist type iia constructions which are mirror to the uplifted type iib constructions",
    ". however , such constructions could be much more complicated to realize explicitly in type iia language .",
    "uplifting vacua in type iia string theory has proved to be a rather technical issue and no explicit construction exists at the moment @xcite .",
    "it appears that one might need a combination of d - term @xcite ( with the caveats of @xcite ) and f - term breaking @xcite to uplift the vacua ( as for example in @xcite ) and it remains to be shown that this can be accomplished in a specific model where all the corrections are under control .",
    "but we will not need to rely on the details of the moduli stabilization or of the uplifting of the final vacuum to de sitter , only on their existence .",
    "for this purpose , one may consider type iia just as well as type iib as an arena for inflation in intersecting brane models .",
    "we can now describe the general type ii intersecting brane models we are considering . although we will count non - vectorlike matter representations by the topological intersections of branes , which is the appropriate geometric picture in type iia , similar formulae and results apply in type iib via mirror symmetry .",
    "we are interested in getting inflation in the open string sector from the various non - vectorlike bifundamental matter fields that are ubiquitous in ibms ( we denote these fields @xmath24 in the following ) .",
    "we suppose that all the adjoint and other vectorlike open string matter are also fixed around the string scale and for simplicity we do not consider the symmetric and antisymmetric matter that arises from strings stretching to the orientifold plane . since each @xmath25 is charged under two gauge groups ( both of which contains a u(1 ) in general ) we will get various fayet - illioupoulos terms in addition to the usual non - abelian piece . given @xmath2 stacks of branes with various gauge symmetries @xmath26 , we get v_d ~_j=1^n g_j^2 ( _ i q_i , j |_i|^2 -_j)^2 + v_na , where @xmath27 are the various fi terms , @xmath28 are the charges of the @xmath24 fields under the gauge group @xmath29 ( this is non - zero for two gauge groups only ) and @xmath30 is the non - abelian contribution to the @xmath0-term . from gauge invariance",
    "the only renormalizable terms in the superpotential will come from yukawa couplings of the following type w ~_i , j , k _ ijk _",
    "i_j_k + ( m_p^-n ) , where the sum runs over all combinations that are allowed by symmetry .",
    "assuming that all the @xmath24 fields have subplanckian value and canonical kinetic term , we get the following f - term potential v_f ~_i , j _ i , j^2 |_i|^2|_j|^2 + v_f , other + ( m_p^-2n ) , where @xmath31 is a constant potential depending on the vevs of all the other stabilized moduli .",
    "it is fixed by matching to the correct cosmological constant at the end of inflation .",
    "note that this is all very schematic ( we will work out an explicit example in the next subsection ) but this is enough to present the generic idea . at first all the @xmath25 fields are on the same footing and there is no favored clock or inflaton field .",
    "we pick out one of the @xmath0-terms ( assume it is a @xmath3 for the moment , though that is not essential ) to act as the inflationary potential .",
    "we can then classify our @xmath25 fields into three different sets : fields with charge @xmath32 and @xmath33 under that particular gauge group ( @xmath34 ) and fields @xmath35 that are neutral under that gauge group . for a convenient choice of the sign of @xmath5 , the fields which charge @xmath32 are the potential waterfall fields . by giving a large enough initial vev to some of the @xmath35 we can make sure that all the @xmath34 are massive through their yukawa couplings .",
    "since we have a large space of flat directions for the remaining @xmath0-terms ( excluding our inflationary term ) , we can simply move out along one of those directions , and use the resulting vevs to give mass to the waterfall fields .",
    "we then have a very flat potential that gives rise to the usual @xmath0-term inflation as the @xmath35 gradually roll back to the origin along the flat direction , due to one - loop logarithmic corrections .",
    "as the @xmath35 fields roll back towards the origin , the effective @xmath36 given to the waterfall fields ( here the @xmath37 ) will drop and one of them will eventually become tachyonic and condense , ending inflation .",
    "the @xmath38 are spectators fields and they are massive throughout the whole process .    we need to make sure that our @xmath0-flat direction is not lifted by yukawa couplings .",
    "any flat direction must involve turning on a set of fields such that the contribution of any field to a @xmath0-term is compensated by the contribution of other fields with the opposite sign charge to the same @xmath0-term .",
    "for example , if one drew the quiver diagram corresponding to the brane gauge theory , any closed oriented polygon would correspond to a possible flat direction .",
    "the only yukawa coupling permitted by gauge invariance would be @xmath39 , where @xmath40 are the fields forming the closed oriented polygon and @xmath41 was the number of sides . only for a triangle",
    "would the yukawa coupling be renormalizable ; for higher @xmath41 the yukawa couplings would be highly suppressed , yielding a very flat potential . to avoid the appearance of ",
    "triangles \" involving fields of the inflaton direction requires only the tuning of the sign of a few topological intersection numbers .",
    "let us illustrate this mechanism in more details by working out the simplest implementation .",
    "we will consider six stacks of hidden sector branes @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "these branes each fill spacetime and wrap different 3-cycles on the compact 6d space .",
    "the topological intersection numbers of our toy model are @xmath46 , with all other intersection numbers being zero .",
    "we can thus readily see that all cubic anomalies cancel .",
    "each brane stack yields a @xmath47 gauge group .",
    "we denote by @xmath12 , @xmath14 and @xmath48 the chiral multiplets stretching between @xmath19 and @xmath20 , @xmath20 and @xmath42 , and @xmath42 and @xmath19 respectively ( see fig .",
    "-term inflation .",
    "we have a total of 6 branes .",
    "brane @xmath42 is our inflationary brane .",
    "branes @xmath19 and @xmath20 give rises to the necessary yukawa coupling between the inflaton and the waterfall field .",
    "branes @xmath44 and @xmath45 are there to ensure that the @xmath0-term potential has a flat direction .",
    "this flat direction is broken by the @xmath49-term potential but this is planckian suppressed .",
    "finally , brane @xmath43 is necessary for the anomalies to cancel , it plays no other role during the inflationary era .",
    "@xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the various bifundamental fields at each intersections .",
    "also note that this picture is a two dimensional depiction of a configuration that actually lives in six curved dimensions.,width=377 ]    the @xmath3 gauge group living on each brane stack will contribute a @xmath0-term to the lagrangian .",
    "we thus obtain the @xmath0-term potential [ fulldterm ] v_d & = & g_c ^2 ( |_+| ^2 -|_-|",
    "^2 -_c)^2 + g_a ^2 ( |_-| ^2 -|_2 |^2 -|s| ^2 + |_3|^2-_a)^2 + & & + g_b ^2 ( |s| ^2 + |_1|^2 -|_+| ^2 -|_1|^2 -_b)^2 + g_d ^2 ( |_2|^2 -|_1|^2 -_d)^2 + & & + g_e ^2 ( |_1|^2 -|_2|^2 -_e)^2 + g_f ^2 ( |_2|^2 -|_3|^2 -_f)^2 , where @xmath52 are the gauge couplings of the gauge theories on the three branes , and @xmath53 are the fayet - iliopoulos terms .",
    "these fi - terms are set by the angles between the various branes , and thus are functions of the topological wrapping numbers of the branes and of the complex structure moduli ( in type iia ; khler moduli in type iib ) ( see e.g. @xcite for a recent discussion ) .",
    "since we have not dealt with the details of how the moduli are fixed , we can not solve for these moduli .",
    "but there are known mechanisms which are believed to provide a very large number of vacua , each of which has different values for the vevs of the moduli . relying on this type of statistics",
    ", we will treat the fi - terms as tunable parameters ( the tuning would occur by selecting a particular metastable vacuum to expand around ) .    for simplicity we set @xmath54 .",
    "we choose the @xmath42 brane stack as our inflationary potential , and we have v_inf ^d & = & g_c ^2 ( |_+| ^2 -|_-| ^2 -_c)^2 , + v_rest ^d & = & g_a ^2 ( |_-| ^2 -|s| ^2 + |_3|^2-_a)^2 + g_b ^2 ( |s| ^2 -|_+| ^2 -|_1|^2 -_b)^2 + & & + g_e ^2 ( |_1|^2 -|_2|^2 -_e)^2 + g_f ^2 ( |_2|^2 -|_3|^2 -_f)^2 . the flat direction is the path in field space along which the variation @xmath55 and @xmath9 is constant . will be constant but non - zero .",
    "this would not change our picture provided the potential is small .",
    "but in general , there will be additional fields arising in symmetric and anti - symmetric representations , as well as fields transforming in the fundamental of two gauge groups .",
    "these fields come from strings stretching between orientifold images , and we have omitted such terms for simplicity . but vevs for these fields will generally permit @xmath56 . ]",
    "this flat direction constitutes our inflaton .",
    "a yukawa coupling will arise from a worldsheet instanton stretching over the triangle generated by the three intersecting branes @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath42 or @xmath43 : w_yuk = _ s _ + _ - + _ s_1_2 . due to gauge invariance ,",
    "these are the only two renormalizable terms in the superpotential containing these fields .",
    "the only yukawa coupling relevant to the flatness of our inflaton direction is [ square ] w_2 = _ 2 m_pl s _ 1 _ 2 _ 3 .",
    "note that this coupling is planck - suppressed because it arises from a  square \" in the quiver diagram , rather than a triangle .",
    "higher suppressions are easily allowed by simply choosing more hidden sectors branes such that the flat direction is described by a polygon with more sides .",
    "since the uplifting of the flat directions can be suppressed sufficiently , we will simply drop this term for the moment . and since we are still on a flat - direction of @xmath57 , we will set this term to zero as well",
    ". we will take canonical khler potential for these open string fields the dependence on the size moduli is small .",
    "note that higher order corrections to the khler potential will not affect the @xmath0-flatness of @xmath58 but it will in general lead to corrections to the mass terms of @xmath13 . ] neglecting planckian corrections and setting @xmath59 , the f - term potential in this model is : v_f = ( _ ^2(|_+|^2 |_-|^2 + |s|^2 ( |_+|^2 + |_-|^2 ) ) + v_f , other ) where @xmath31 is the constant potential from all other f - term susy - breaking sectors .",
    "in order to have @xmath0-term inflation we need @xmath60 .",
    "although this is a working assumption throughout this paper , it could be relaxed and one could have an @xmath49 and @xmath0 term of the same order ( however , crucial details of the inflaton potential would change in this case ) .",
    "so we will assume the @xmath49-term potential is subdominant and we will drop it for the rest of this discussion ( note that one can not have a strictly vanishing @xmath49-term when the @xmath0-term is non - vanishing in supergravity ) .",
    "we will work in the regime where the inflaton vev is always smaller than the string / planck - scale , as well as below the masses of the moduli .",
    "as such , we are justified in ignoring gravitational corrections to the khler potential , and in using an effective field theory approach with excited strings and moduli integrated out .",
    "it is possible that these constraints can be relaxed consistently with inflation , but we will assume them in order to obtain a simple and standard framework .",
    "our scenario for inflation is thus very  field theoretic , \" and in fact can be implemented in effective field theory without necessarily relying on its string origin and motivation .",
    "note that it is possible to have some moduli unstable during inflation as long as their effects on the inflationary predictions are under control and that the moduli stabilize at a phenomenologically viable value at the end of inflation .",
    "note that , a priori , nothing picked out @xmath12 as the inflaton . it is the initial conditions and the existence of the appropriate flat directions which picks out the appropriate field to act as the inflaton .",
    "also we should emphasize that this model differs from the originally proposed @xmath0-term inflation model @xcite since the inflaton field is in a non - vectorlike representation .",
    "the tree - level potential is v_tree= g^2 ( |_+| ^2 -|_-| ^2 -)^2 + _ ^2 ( |_+|^2 |_-|^2 + |_+|^2 |s|^2 + |s|^2 |_-|^2 ) .",
    "the global supersymmetric minimum for this potential occurs at @xmath61 , @xmath62 .",
    "however , for @xmath63 , the non - vanishing minimum of the potential is at @xmath64 .",
    "this potential is thus of the hybrid form , with @xmath12 the inflaton field and @xmath14 the waterfall field .",
    "but one should remember that the actual inflationary path involves more than just the field @xmath12 . in some sense we may thus regard this as a multi - inflaton model , where @xmath12 is the inflaton which dictates when the waterfall field starts rolling .    for @xmath65 , we can thus set @xmath66 and write an effective potential for @xmath12 .",
    "this potential will have a one - loop correction of coleman - weinberg form , yielding @xmath67\\ ; , \\nonumber \\\\   & \\approx g^2 \\xi^2 \\left[1 + { g^2 \\over 4 \\pi^2 } \\log \\left({\\lambda^2 |s|^2 \\over \\lambda^2}\\right)\\right]\\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have taken @xmath68 and @xmath69 in the second line .",
    "note that the one - loop contribution is dominated by the @xmath12 dependence .",
    "this is the case because the coleman - weinberg contribution comes from the splitting of boson and fermion masses .",
    "but if we are on a flat direction of @xmath9 , then the boson masses are not split by these @xmath0-terms ( the fi contribution is cancelled by the contribution from the vevs of the fields ) . the only contribution to boson / fermion mass splitting comes from @xmath10 , and only @xmath12 couples to these fields via the yukawa coupling to generate the fermion mass .",
    "so for practical purposes now , @xmath12 is acting as our inflaton .",
    "note also that any pair of fields that couples to @xmath12 through a yukawa coupling will contribute to the coleman - weinberg potential . in front of @xmath70 . hence our @xmath71 . ] in our case we have two pairs @xmath13 and @xmath50 .",

    "one has to worry about whether or not the effective field theory approximation is valid for large values of the fayet - iliopoulos term .",

    "@xmath0-term inflation is a fairly robust model that has been extensively studied in the literature ( see @xcite and references therein for some detailed analysis ) . in this section ,",
    "we remind the reader of the simplest story .",

    "note that in the opposite limit where @xmath82 , we can still match the data although the observables will now depend on @xmath83 .",
    "we require that the initial value of @xmath84 ( which minimally corresponds to 60 efolds ) satisfy the following hierarchy of scales for the effective field theory approach to be valid @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the mass scale of the string moduli and @xmath87 is the string scale .",
    "we note here that we expect a spread in the masses of the moduli ( see for e.g @xcite where they study the spectrum of moduli masses via random matrix techniques ) . in order for inflation to go through unmodified ,",
    "we probably need the value of the inflaton to be lower than most masses of the moduli which might be a stronger requirement than taking it to be smaller than string scale .",
    "supposing that we have no more than 60 efolds , we get that the initial vev of @xmath84 is of order @xmath88 .",
    "one could potentially satisfy the needed hierarchy of scale with @xmath89 or @xmath90 .    with subplanckian vev for @xmath84",

    "it is argued that there is a region of the parameter space for which a complete fit of the model including the contribution of the cosmic strings to the power spectrum is possible @xcite . in this case",

    "we will see that this different feature has implications for baryogenesis .",
    "finally , we can quantify how much fine - tuning is needed in order not to spoil the slow - roll conditions .",

    "we see from ( [ finetuning ] ) that by using a polygon with enough sides ( @xmath41= 5 should do ) one can effectively eliminate the needed fine - tuning . hence it is possible to brane engineer a flat direction .",
    "it is also worth noting that the @xmath115 yukawa coupling is generated by worldsheet instantons , which generally are exponentially suppressed by @xmath116 , where @xmath117 is the area of the string worldsheet stretching between the brane stacks forming the polygon . in the large volume limit ( where known moduli - stabilization schemes are under control )",

    "remember that equation ( [ finetuning ] ) was obtained assuming @xmath120 and so we need to fine - tune both coupling constants .",
    "finally , since this model is really a multiple fields inflationary scenario , one might expect that isocurvature perturbations will be generated by the fluctuations of the @xmath7 and these perturbations might modify our fit to the data .",

    "this setup is perhaps the simplest version of our scenario which would arise in intersecting brane models , but it is not necessarily the most generic .",
    "one might expect , for example , that the various stacks could contain multiple parallel branes ( non - abelian gauge groups ) and that the various stacks could have @xmath121 ( more than one multiplet in the various bifundamentals ) .",
    "we will see that these more generic setups provide new constraints , but also new phenomenological features .",
    "the first serious worry is the possibility of multiple waterfall fields for the inflaton potential ( the @xmath0-term potential associated with the @xmath42 brane stack in our previous example ) .",
    "one source of new waterfall fields would be additional branes stacks with topological intersection with the brane stack @xmath42 .",
    "another source would be multiple topological intersections ( for example , suppose in our previous example that we had @xmath122 ) .",
    "if there exists a new brane stack @xmath123 with non - trivial topological intersection with @xmath42 , then the new @xmath0-term potential will be of the form v_d = g^2 ( |^i _ + |^2 - |^j_-|^2 |^k|^2 + ... -)^2 where @xmath124 is the scalar arising from strings stretching between @xmath123 and @xmath42 , and the superscripts index our choice of chiral multiplet ( if we have multiple chiral multiplets transforming in various bifundamentals ) .",
    "the charge of @xmath124 is determined by the sign of the topological intersection . in this more generic setup",
    ", one sees that there can be multiple waterfall fields which could condense , causing @xmath125 to go to zero . for inflation to occur , it is necessary for every waterfall field to get a mass which stays positive until the inflaton reaches its critical value ( and inflation ends ) .",
    "but in general this should not be a problem . recall that if we have @xmath2 brane stacks generating @xmath2 @xmath0-term equations , we generally have @xmath4 scalars which we can use to find flat directions .",
    "requiring those flat - directions to lift the @xmath126 waterfall fields of @xmath10 should still give us @xmath4 acceptable inflaton directions ( modulo the fine - tuning of the signs of intersections numbers to obtain planck - suppression of yukawa couplings ; for a flat direction given by an @xmath41-sided polygon , this means a choice of @xmath127 signs ) .",
    "another subtlety worth noting arises if one of the gauge groups is non - abelian . in this case",
    "there will be non - abelian @xmath0-terms of the form v_r",
    "^d = ( _ i _ i ^ t_r _ i ) ^2 where @xmath128 is a non - diagonal generator of the gauge group and @xmath129 is any scalar charged under the non - abelian symmetry ( there is no fi - term for these terms ) .",
    "if @xmath130 is a non - abelian group , then one must worry if the presence of the new @xmath0-term equation will prevent the full @xmath0-term potential from dropping to zero when @xmath14 condenses .",
    "indeed , if @xmath14 is the only waterfall field then @xmath131 will reach an @xmath132 fraction of the original value of @xmath133 ( due to the non - zero final value of @xmath134 ) . in this case , the waterfall will still end inflation but we would now need to be sure that the cosmological constant at the end of the waterfall is small to match observation . this would require a cancellation between @xmath135 ( which is an @xmath132 fraction of the inflation scale ) , and @xmath136 , which in turn presents an @xmath1-problem which must be resolved by fine - tuning . since we would have @xmath0-terms of order @xmath133 , we would in this case be led to a model of high - scale supersymmetry breaking .",
    "but it is important to note that this is only true in the simple example where there is only one waterfall field .",
    "if for example , we had @xmath137 , we would have two waterfall doublet fields @xmath138 . in this case",
    ", one can see that by condensing the upper component of the @xmath139 and the lower component of @xmath140 , one can set to zero all of the @xmath0-terms associated with brane stack @xmath42 ( furthermore , if @xmath141 , then the inflaton @xmath12 alone can give mass to all the waterfall fields via generic yukawa couplings ) .",
    "another way of phrasing this would be to note that although non - abelian @xmath0-terms will give us more constraints than our original @xmath126 , higher topological intersection numbers can give us more fields than our original @xmath4 , so that we can still find sufficiently many flat directions .",
    "finally , we briefly discuss a subtlety mentioned in @xcite .",
    "as they noted , it is potentially difficult to maintain low - energy supersymmetry while simultaneously fixing the fi - terms at a high - scale ( i.e. , fixing the closed string moduli on which the fi - terms depend at a high scale ) .",
    "if the @xmath3 associated to the @xmath0-term is anomalous ( with the anomaly fixed by the green - schwarz mechanism ) , then the vector boson becomes massive by eating the axion .",
    "however , the axion itself is in the same multiplet as the khler moduli , which are assumed fixed at a high scale .",
    "if supersymmetry is preserved , then this would imply that the vector multiplet becomes massive at a high - scale , in which case one should not see the @xmath0-term equation at low energies .",
    "one might worry that our scenario would face this difficulty , as the appearance of so many non - vectorlike representations would imply that many @xmath3 s have some mixed anomalies .    of course ,",
    "as noted in @xcite , this @xmath0-term picture can be made consistent by some amount of @xmath49-term supersymmetry breaking , and this amount can be made very small .",
    "this picture is completely consistent with our scenario .",
    "but one should remember that in our scenario , it is in fact possible to generate many non - anomalous @xmath3 s .",
    "one can see this simply by noting that the number of anomalous @xmath3 s with anomalies fixed by the green - schwarz mechanism is limited by the number of axions present ( basically , by the number of size moduli in type iib ) . for every axion ,",
    "only one @xmath3 can become massive ; if there are more @xmath3 factors arising from branes than there are axions , the remainder must be non - anomalous .",
    "generally , the non - anomalous @xmath3 s will not simply be the diagonal subgroup living on a brane stack .",
    "instead , they will arise as a linear combination of various diagonal @xmath3 s . but nothing in our inflation scenario depended on the fact that each @xmath3 lived on a brane .",
    "we only utilized the fact that for every pair of gauge groups there would generally be matter charged under both groups , and this will be true for linear combinations of these groups as well .",
    "so the picture above can go forward as before with each of the @xmath3 s having no mixed anomalies and arising from a linear combination of the diagonal @xmath3 s living on the various brane stacks .",
    "as long as there exists the appropriate fields with charges to be the inflaton and waterfall ( which should arise just as easily for a @xmath3 which arises from a linear combination ) , the story goes through as before .",
    "as was shown in @xcite , the condensation of the waterfall field which ends hybrid inflation is typically accompanied by tachyonic preheating ( as opposed to the usual parametric resonance ) in which energy is dumped into the long - wavelength modes of the waterfall field itself .",
    "light scalar fields interacting with the waterfall field will be dragged along into the process of preheating . after a while",
    ", we expect these excitations to decay to a bath of fermions and bosons in equilibrium .",
    "since this whole process is happening in a hidden sector , the reheating could be happening in multiple stages and it could take a while ( for sufficiently small coupling ) to reach the final relativistic bath of standard model particles .    this",
    "would in turn allow us to lower the temperature of reheating .",
    "this is usually needed to avoid the gravitino problem , in which a low mass gravitino is overproduced at the end of inflation and overcloses the universe .",
    "this is a serious problem to any theory of inflation with a high scale @xcite .",
    "it is naturally solved when the reheat temperature is roughly lower than @xmath142 gev for tev scale supersymmetry breaking .",
    "this can be accomplished very simply by having a long multi - stage reheating process where the inflationary energy goes through multiple stages before settling into its final standard model bath of particles .",
    "the details of the reheating process are model dependent as one would need to know exactly how strong are the coupling between the inflaton sector and the standard model branes .    finally , it is possible that density perturbations and/or non - gaussianities can be generated in the preheating era .",
    "these were shown to be possible by using second order analysis in @xcite .",
    "alternatively , it has been argued that the presence of extra light fields on which the mass of the waterfall field depends can also generate density perturbations at the end of inflation @xcite .",
    "all of this interesting issues are beyond the scope of the current work and we assume that they change the inflationary prediction only in a subdominant way .",
    "this scenario for inflation in intersecting brane models can also provide input for baryogenesis .",
    "one of the most interesting models of baryogenesis is electroweak baryogenesis @xcite , in which the mixed anomaly between @xmath143 and the weak group @xmath144 creates a non - trivial divergence in the baryon current : _",
    "j_b ^ tr [ f_w f_w ] .",
    "electroweak sphaleron processes can thus lead to microscopic baryon generation .",
    "if the electroweak phase transition is first order , then this transition provides the departure from thermal equilibrium necessary for the generation of a net baryon asymmetry .",
    "one of the reasons for the great interest in this mechanism is that it is determined by physics at accessible ( or soon to be accessible ) energy scales and thus can make definite predictions which can be tested . in this regard",
    "it is almost too successful ; ewbg in the standard model is already ruled out by lep data , and in the mssm it is tightly constrained into a very narrow window .",
    "these constraints largely arise from the necessity for the ewpt to be first order : in the standard model one needs @xmath145 gev , and in the mssm one needs @xmath146 gev ( the bounds from lep establish @xmath147 gev ) .",
    "in addition , the requirement that sufficient cp violation be provided by the higgs sector provides further constraints ( for an overview of all of these constraints , see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "thus , an interesting offshoot proposal of ewbg has been electroweak tachyonic preheating @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the electroweak phase transition is a cold transition which occurs at the end of hybrid inflation .",
    "the waterfall field which ends inflation is the higgs field , which simultaneously breaks the electroweak symmetry .",
    "such a fast cold transition will necessarily occur outside thermal equilibrium .",
    "furthermore , tachyonic preheating @xcite will robustly dump energy into the long - wavelength modes of the fields coupled to the waterfall field as it condenses .",
    "these modes can thus excite the electroweak sphalerons necessary for the generation of a baryon asymmetry .",
    "this proposal is a novel alternative which offers a chance to realize ewbg despite the constraints on the ewpt .",
    "however , it necessarily requires low - scale inflation ( in fact , electroweak scale ) , which is accompanied by its own set of constraints in order to generate the correct scale of density perturbations .    on a parallel track , a recently proposed model of hidden sector baryogenesis",
    "@xcite realizes a mechanism reminiscent of ewbg in a context very natural to intersecting brane models . in hsb , mixed anomalies between a hidden sector gauge group @xmath148 and @xmath143 result in a non - trivial divergence for the baryon current",
    "j_b ^ tr [ f_g f_g ] . as a result ,",
    "sphaleron / instanton processes in the hidden @xmath148 sector can generate a baryon asymmetry in much the same way that electroweak sphalerons generate it in ewbg .",
    "these hidden sectors are numerous and appear generically in intersecting brane models , and they generically have mixed anomalies with both @xmath143 and @xmath149 . since any one of these groups can generate a baryon asymmetry if it has a strongly first order phase transition , and it only takes one for the mechanism to work , hsb provides a robust mechanism for generating a baryon asymmetry in ibms .",

    "we may write this as _ j_b ^ c_b tr[f_g_b f_g_b ] + c_c tr[f_g_c f_g_c ] .",
    "long wavelength modes of the @xmath153 gauge fields will excite sphalerons of the hidden sector , which will in turn generate a baryon asymmetry via the anomaly , as in hsb ( and analogous to electroweak tachyonic preheating baryogenesis ) .",
    "moreover , this transition will occur at the symmetry breaking scale of the @xmath153 sector , which can be relatively high .",
    "so in this scenario , inflation does not need to be at a very low scale , avoiding one of the constraints of electroweak tachyonic preheating .    a prototype for this might be an example where @xmath159 and @xmath160 or @xmath161 , which would be very similar to electroweak breaking . in the original works on electroweak tachyonic preheating",
    ", numerical simulations demonstrated that when the electroweak gauge theory is broken by condensation of the waterfall field , tachyonic preheating would indeed dump energy into the gauge field , which in turn would excite sphalerons and ( accompanied by c and cp violation ) generate a baryon asymmetry .",
    "such a mechanism can certainly work in the hsb context for the gauge theories arising in intersecting brane models as well , provided that c and cp violation are present ( they should appear generically in the hidden sector gauge theory ; whether or not they are of the correct magnitude is a detailed model dependent question which one must answer hidden sector by hidden sector ) .",
    "but one still must ensure that after tachyonic preheating , when the radiation has thermalized , the sphalerons are shut off .",
    "otherwise , the sphalerons could wash out the generated baryon asymmetry .",

    "the majorana mass of @xmath176 arises from a tree - level interaction with the fermionic component of @xmath5 appearing as the intermediate line .",
    "we thus find @xmath185 , where @xmath186 is @xmath187 gut scale and is , therefore , of the right magnitude to generate the light neutrino mass .",
    "it is interesting to note that lepton asymmetry in this model can be generated by cp - violating out - of - equilibrium decays of right handed neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "this asymmetry is obtained via the tree and loop contributions in the decay of the lightest right - handed majorana neutrino into leptons and scalar higgs .",
    "the electroweak sphaleron process then converts the lepton asymmetry to a baryon asymmetry .    although hidden sector baryogenesis and the generation of mass for the neutrinos can both fit nicely and simultaneously into this picture of @xmath0-term inflation in ibms , it is not necessary for both mechanisms to appear simultaneously .",
    "for example , we can consider ibms where the baryon asymmetry is generated at the end of inflation by hsb associated with tachyonic preheating , while the neutrino masses are generated by unconnected dynamics .",
    "similarly , we can consider models where the condensation of the waterfall field generates the neutrino masses , but baryogenesis is dominated by contributions other than hsb ( including perhaps leptogenesis of the form discussed above ) .",
    "we have developed a scenario of @xmath0-term inflation which appears to arise quite straightforwardly in the context of intersecting brane models . in this case , the inflaton @xmath12 lives in a chiral multiplet arising from strings stretching between two hidden sector branes at their point of intersection .",
    "the waterfall field has a similar origin .",
    "a noteworthy feature of this type of inflation is that it can quite naturally generate a baryon asymmetry in the visible sector at the end of inflation via the recently proposed hidden sector baryogenesis mechanism @xcite .",
    "one can also easily generalize this model to additionally generate majorana masses for neutrinos .",
    "one of the puzzles of cosmological evolution has been the origin of the various required scales .",
    "one would need to understand where the scale of the majorana masses arises from , and depending on the mechanism of baryogenesis , also the origin of the scale at which one departs from equilibrium . the scenario we discuss here ties both of these scales directly to the scale of inflation ; to our knowledge , it is the only scenario to achieve this .",
    "further , both high and low scale supersymmetry breakings are compatible with baryogenesis which can happen in the hidden sector or via leptogenesis .",
    "although a key motivation for this scenario comes from the general features of intersecting brane models , this scenario can be thought of purely in terms of effective field theory . as such",
    ", it may have wider application .",
    "of course , we think of this as a scenario instead of a true  model \" since we have not illustrated with a specific construction .",
    "thus far , it has proven relatively difficult to generate specific examples of intersecting brane models in compactifications in which all closed string moduli are fixed , although some work on this subject has been done @xcite .",
    "there are many difficulties in combining an intersecting brane model with the features necessary for fixing moduli , such as fluxes and non - perturbative corrections , but it seems to us that these problems are technical in nature ; there is no clear reason why should nt be able to stabilize moduli in some compactification with an ibm .    more specifically , there are two main working assumptions in this paper that remain to be worked out in detail in order to achieve a consistent string theory embedding of this scenario .",
    "one assumption is that there exists a consistent moduli stabilization scheme where the @xmath0-term energy dominates over the @xmath49-term .",
    "secondly , we have not included any quantum corrections to the fi term which may depend on the inflaton field .",
    "one might expect that the quantum corrections are suppressed since the inflaton field is a bifundamental living at an intersection separated from the brane that generates the dominant fi term during inflation .",
    "we leave an investigation of these issues for future work  @xcite .    to the extent that one thinks of this as inflation in an intersecting brane model ( as opposed to a more generic effective field theoretic setting )",
    ", it obviously relies on the existence of many such moduli - stabilized ibms .",
    "it would of course be very interesting to understand specific examples of such moduli - stabilized ibms , and to see if this type of inflation scenario can be realized .",
    "along these lines , another very interesting problem is to better understand which branes and features are generic in the class of moduli - stabilized intersecting brane models , beyond the more well - understood set of toroidal orientifold constructions .",
