    "the spin liquid phase @xcite has been the focus of numerous theoretical as well as experimental studies as it appears in both gapless and gapped quasi- one dimensional quantum magnets .",
    "for instance , the two leg spin - 1/2 ladder compounds with standard geometry and antiferromagnetic exchange couplings exhibits a spin liquid state with a haldane type energy gap@xcite .",
    "this phase is characterized by exotic magnetic excitations , as the spinons which are topological excitations in the spin - 1/2 heisenberg chain , or the s=1 excitations , commonly called `` triplons '' , in the gapped ladders .",
    "one of the most fascinating manifestations of the magnetic excitations is the observation of a magnetic mode of heat transport@xcite in quasi - one dimensional magnets as the sr@xmath0cuo@xmath1 , srcuo@xmath0 chain or the sr@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 ladder compounds@xcite .",
    "these are electrically insulating compounds ( ceramics ) with a large , highly anisotropic heat conductivity that is attributed to the propagation of magnetic excitations along the chains ( ladders ) and of magnitude dictated by the magnetic exchange constant that is often of the order of magnitude of the fermi energy in metallic systems .    from the theoretical point of view",
    ", a ballistic magnetic heat transport is predicted in exactly solvable spin hamiltonians like the antiferromagnetic spin - 1/2 heisenberg chain .",
    "very high purity sr@xmath0cuo@xmath1 , srcuo@xmath0 compounds , which are very good realizations of this model as the interchain coupling is very weak , have confirmed this expectation . however , due to the presence of spin - phonon scattering , the heat conductivity becomes finite , monotonically decreasing with temperature above about 50k @xcite .",
    "the thermal conductivity of spin - 1/2 heisenberg and xy chains coupled to optical and acoustic phonons has been studied by numerical simulations and reveals similar behavior for the two models , with an enhancement in the heisenberg model due to larger energy current correlations @xcite .",
    "furthermore , bosonization@xcite and a boltzmann semi - phenomenological approach@xcite yield qualitatively similar behavior .",
    "the effect of next - nearest neighbor ( n.n.n ) interaction and interchain coupling on the thermal transport of the anisotropic heisenberg model has also been investigated by exact diagonalization ( ed ) on finite clusters @xcite .",
    "this study shows that while the thermal transport of the integrable one - dimensional s - 1/2 heisenberg model is infinite at all finite temperatures , both interchain and n.n.n .",
    "interactions which break the integrability of the model reduce the thermal transport , with the reduction being more pronounced for the interchain coupling .    for the spin ladder systems the situation is more complex . here",
    ", the ballistic magnetic thermal conduction is limited both by the magnon - magnon scattering as well as the magnon - phonon one ( as the elementary spin excitations , triplons , carry spin s=1 ) , even though the coupling to acoustic phonons is weak @xcite .",
    "what is really surprising and worth understanding is that , despite the scattering mechanisms , the thermal conductivity of the ladder compounds is as high as that of the spin chain ones@xcite .",
    "an early numerical study of the magnetic thermal transport in the two leg spin - 1/2 ladder , neglecting phonons , indicated that the interchain coupling results in diffusive thermal transport , at least in the high temperature limit@xcite .",
    "diffusive transport is a result of the interchain interactions which break the integrability of the decoupled heisenberg chains . for undoped ladder compounds ,",
    "it was found experimentally that the magnetic contribution is very large compared to the phononic one .",
    "the temperature dependence of the thermal conductivity of sr@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 measured along the ladder direction presents two peaks with the higher temperature peak associated with the magnetic transport mode .",
    "this is in strong contrast to the two orders of magnitude smaller conductivity along the rung direction which only shows the low temperature phonon related peak@xcite .",
    "the thermal conductivity of spin ladders systems , including phonons and impurities , has been approached theoretically mostly by low energy effective models@xcite and numerical simulations@xcite .",
    "the goal of this work is to sort out the effect of triplon - triplon scattering in limiting the thermal conduction along the leg direction . in particular",
    ", we study the interchain and anisotropy dependence of the thermal conductivity as a function of temperature using the bond operator formalism @xcite where the spin model is mapped to a bosonic one with hard core triplon repulsion .",
    "the anisotropies account for the eventual effects of spin orbit coupling and the crystalline electric field .",
    "although most ladder compounds are described with isotropic exchange interactions , the anisotropy plays an important role in some others like ( c@xmath5h@xmath6n)@xmath0cubr@xmath7 @xcite and cacu@xmath0o@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "we have implemented green s function approach to calculate the thermal conductivity , i.e. the time ordered energy current correlation .",
    "although the calculations are tedious and complex we have tried to elaborate the main steps in different sections and an appendix . in the last section we discuss and analyze our results to show how interchain interactions and anisotropies affect the thermal transport",
    "moreover , a comparison to exact diagonalization results @xcite is presented .",

    "the singlet and triplet bond operators satisfy bosonic commutations relations . as far",
    "as the ratio @xmath20 is nonzero there is a finite gap between the triplet and singlet states .",
    "thus , the population of singlet bosons is expected to be much higher than the triplet ones , which justifies to consider a condensation of singlets . in the presence of a finite gap",
    ", we neglect the quantum fluctuation of singlet density and replace the corresponding operators with its mean value , namely @xmath21 . using the bond operator transformation the hamiltonian can be written in terms of a bilinear term and a quartic one .",

    "the decrease of @xmath84 with temperature is in agreement with an experimental study on the two leg ladder at zero hole doping @xcite .",
    "the increase of rung exchange coupling enhances the energy gap between the singlet and triplet states on each rung which consequently reduces the number of triplons that participate in thermal transport and results in lower thermal conductivity .",
    "conversely , the decrease of rung coupling enhances thermal transport which asymptotically diverges as the rung coupling tends to zero as shown in fig.[fig1 ] for @xmath112 .",
    "this is in agreement with the ballistic transport of the integrable s - 1/2 heisenberg chain expected in the limit @xmath113 .",
    "this behavior has been observed in an exact diagonalization study on the two leg ladder @xcite and is compared with our results in fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "the green s function approach data present the behavior of a two leg ladder in the infinite size limit while the ed ones are obtained from a 14 rung system in the high temperature limit by setting k@xmath111t / j=1 .",
    "as the thermal scattering length is expected to be very short in the high temperature limit - as evidenced by the absence of finite size dependence@xcite - we expect a qualitative agreement and a similar trend in @xmath84 versus rung coupling as shown in fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "the green s function approach presented here gives accurate results at low temperatures ( k@xmath111t / j @xmath114 ) while the ed results @xcite are justified at high temperatures .",
    "this explains the quantitative difference between the two approaches in fig.[fig2 ] while a qualitative agreement of the trend of results is observed .",
    "we would like to add few comments on the accuracy of our results , which are based on the two particle scattering matrix ( @xmath115 ) that determines the self - energies and consequently the corrections on the spin excitation spectrum .",
    "@xmath115-function which has been presented in eq.([e178 ] ) has been calculated using ladder diagrams based on the brueckner approach . according to the brueckner approach , which is justified in the low density limit of bosonic gas ,",
    "the normal one particle green s functions is the only part of green s functions which constructs the feynman diagrams of the self - energy and @xmath115 , which means that the anomalous green s function can be neglected .",
    "this is justified -based on eq.([e10.4])- in which one of the terms in the normal green s function is proportional to bogoliubov coefficient @xmath116 . while both terms of the anomalous green s function show a dependence on the other bogoliubov coefficient @xmath117 .",
    "moreover , eq.([e131 ] ) implies that the bogoliubov coefficient @xmath117 is negligible in the low density limit of triplet bosons .",
    "therefore , the factors that increase the density of triplet particles reduce the accuracy of our approach . as a result , one can point out both conditions , the low temperature and high values of @xmath20 yield our approach works more accurately .",
    "the former is obvious while the latter case increases the gap in the excitation spectrum , which leads to more justified scheme of low triplet density . as a measure",
    ", the density of triplet bosons starts an incremental behavior at k@xmath111t / j@xmath118 , which proposes to indicate ( k@xmath111t / j)@xmath114 as the regime in which our approach gives accurate results .",
    "similarly , we would like to consider @xmath119 , where the density of triplets is low enough ( @xmath120 ) for a reasonable accuracy .",
    "we have also studied the effect of anisotropy on the thermal conduction of a spin ladder . in fig.[fig3 ] we plot @xmath84 versus normalized temperature for different values of anisotropies on the leg hamiltonian , namely @xmath121 for @xmath122 .",
    "this plot indicates a weak dependence on @xmath15 at very low temperatures .",
    "it can be understood from the fact that the singlet - triplet gap is practically independent of the leg anisotropy ( @xmath15 ) and thus the triplon density and the thermal transport are unaffected .",
    "this behavior is almost the same for weak coupling @xmath123 , the normal ladder @xmath124 and the strong coupling limit @xmath125 as shown in fig.[fig3 ] .",
    "all plots presented in fig.[fig3 ] show no dependence on the leg anisotropy .",
    "specially , at the strong coupling limit @xmath126 the thermal transport is clearly independent of @xmath15 where all plots fall on each other on the whole range of temperature .",
    "however , the situation is different for the rung anisotropy ( @xmath14 ) . here",
    "the rung anisotropy has a direct influence on the singlet - triplet energy gap and hence on the triplon density as shown in fig.[fig4 ] where @xmath84 is plotted versus normalized temperature for different values of the rung anisotropy .",
    "the increase of @xmath14 raises the triplon gap which gives lower conductivity at a given temperature .",
    "moreover , lower values of @xmath14 mean weaker interactions on the rungs which consequently improve the thermal conductivity up to the limit of the ballistic regime of the integrable chain .",
    "in addition , at fixed values of coupling constants which means fixed triplon density , lower temperature causes less scattering between triplons and consequently higher values in thermal conductivity .",
    "thus , as @xmath127 the scattering of triplons goes to zero which leads to the divergence of the thermal conductivity .",
    "in conclusion , we have presented the temperature dependence of the thermal conductivity of an anisotropic spin ladder model due to spin excitation modes . using a singlet - triplet presentation and a green s function approach",
    "the excitation spectrum of the spin ladder has been studied . in particular , the effect of anisotropies along the ladder and rung directions have been investigated .",
    "we have found that the anisotropy along the ladder direction has a major effect on the thermal conductivity , while the anisotropy along the leg direction has a minor one .",
    "also the results show that a decrease of the coupling exchange constant along the rungs results to a divergent behavior of the thermal conductivity versus temperature , reminiscent of the purely ballistic thermal transport in the heisenberg spin - 1/2 chain .    this work was supported in part by the office of vice - president for research of sharif university of technology . a.l .",

    "<S> the possible effect of spin - orbit coupling and crystalline electric field are investigated in terms of anisotropies in the heisenberg interactions on both leg and rung couplings . </S>",
    "<S> the original spin ladder is mapped to a bosonic model via a bond - operator transformation where an infinite hard - core repulsion is imposed to constrain one boson occupation per site . </S>",
    "<S> the green s function approach is applied to obtain the energy spectrum of quasi - particle excitations responsible for thermal transport . </S>",
    "<S> the thermal conductivity is found to be monotonically decreasing with temperature due to increased scattering among triplet excitations at higher temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> a tiny dependence of thermal transport on the anisotropy in the leg direction at low temperatures is observed in contrast to the strong one on the anisotropy along the rung direction , due to the direct effect of the triplet density . </S>",
    "<S> our results reach asymptotically the ballistic regime of the spin - 1/2 heisenberg chain and compare favorably well with exact diagonalization data . </S>"
