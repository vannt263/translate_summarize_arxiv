    "quantum control is a coherent manipulation of a quantum system , which enables a time evolution from an arbitrary initial state to arbitrarily given target states @xcite .",
    "recently , we proposed the conception of indirect quantum control(idqc ) @xcite . a similar work under the name of _ incoherent _ quantum control ind1,ind2,ind4 was proposed by r. roman et.al .",
    "for the control of spin - half particles .",
    "the idqc is a coherent manipulation for a quantum system via a coupled intermediate system ( called quantum accessor ) , which can be controlled directly . through the engineered interaction between the controlled quantum system and the accessor ,",
    "this indirect manipulation enable an ideal control of the system .",
    "a similar controllability for incoherent control @xcite has been studied in the @xmath0 case that both the controlled system and quantum accessor are spin-@xmath1 particles @xcite .",
    "our first paper @xcite on indirect quantum control was motivated by the pervious works on the quantum control with built - in feedback @xcite and on the dipole control for finite quantum systems @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a general indirect quantum control protocol is proposed and studied in detail with an engineered interaction totally fixed between the controlled quantum system and the accessor . in this scheme the accessor is modeled as a qubit chain with xy - type coupling .",
    "conditions for the complete controllability , such as the minimal number of qubits in accessor , the coupling way between the system and the accessor , are investigated in detail .",
    "different from the scheme proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the quantum control scheme proposed in this paper is mainly based on ingeniously preparing the initial state of the quantum @xmath2 . in this scheme ,",
    "the control function is encoded in a series of initial states of the accessor , which is prepared by means of a classical field , and realized through the conditional evolution of the controlled system from the initial states .",
    "so it is adequate to say that this is essentially an indirect control protocol where the initial preparation of the quantized accessor \" determines the time evolution of the controlled system to realize the target state .    in this paper",
    ", we assume that the interaction which governs the evolution of the controlled system depends on the initial state of the accessor , and it is switched off when the external field is switched on to manipulate the accessor .",
    "this switch off and on duality  can be approximately realized when the strength of the external field is much stronger than the system - accessor coupling .",
    "actually , in physical situations it is rather difficult to control the system state directly , but it is easy to manipulate the accessor state and modify the @xmath3 state by switching on and off the interaction between them .",
    "we will only consider the quantum controllability of finite dimensional systems , and leave the relevant infinite case tarn - infinite as an open problem .",
    "initialized in the eigenstate of its free hamiltonian .",
    "then the interaction is opened to govern the evolution of @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the above two steps complete a control cycle .",
    "the cycle is repeated until the target state is obtained.,width=7 ]    the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ csheme ] , we describe in detail the control steps of our idqc scheme by a model . in sec .",
    "[ controllability ] , we generally investigate the controllability , in a slightly generalized sense , of the scheme along the line of ref . jurdjeiv . in sec .",
    "[ example ] , we consider explicitly an example to illustrate the idqc scheme and the concerned controllability .",
    "let the controlled system @xmath5 be a finite - level system described by the hamiltonian @xmath6 and the quantum accessor @xmath4 be a high - dimension system described by the hamiltonian @xmath7 . in our scheme",
    "the control process is steered by the preparation of the initial states of @xmath4 .",
    "to realize the conditional evolution of the system , we require the interaction @xmath8 between the system and the accessor commute with @xmath7 , i.e. , @xmath9 = 0 $ ] .",
    "thus the hamiltonian of the total system of @xmath5 and @xmath4 can be written as @xmath10we observe that in our model @xmath7 commutes with both @xmath6 and @xmath11 . actually , in the standardapproach for ideal quantum measurement , we require a non - demolition property , defined by the above commutation relations . here",
    "we can imagine the controlled system as a detector , which will not dissipate the energy of the accessor , but on the other hand can record the manipulation information of the accessor .",
    "then the evolution of the controlled system is steered by the quantum states of @xmath4 .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian @xmath8 between the two subsystems enjoys the following nice property . for the fixed variable of the controlled system , which can be viewed as the classical parameter , the operator @xmath7 and @xmath12",
    "have the common eigenstates @xmath13 because of the commutating relation .",
    "the corresponding eigenvalues @xmath14 are parameterized by the variables of the controlled system and thus can be regarded as an operator acting on the hilbert space of the controlled system .",
    "thus for each eigenstate @xmath13 of the accessor and an arbitrary state @xmath15where @xmath16 is an operator acting on the state space of @xmath5 and depends on the initial eigenstate of the accessor . in this sense , we regard @xmath17 as an effective hamiltonian acting on the controlled system .    actually for an arbitrary initial state @xmath18 of @xmath5 and an eigenstate @xmath13 hamiltonian @xmath7 of the accessor @xmath4 with eigenvalue @xmath19 , we have @xmath20this means that different initial states of the accessor can induce different time evolutions of the controlled system , which are defined by the effective hamiltonian@xmath21therefore the different effective hamiltonian @xmath22 can be induced by preparing the different initial states of the accessor .",
    "the above simple observations motivate us to propose a new idqc scheme . in our control scheme",
    ", we assume that we can manipulate the accessor @xmath4 to any common eigenstate state of @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the system is manipulated by the series of effective hamiltonians @xmath23 induced by preparing different initial states of the accessor . here , we take the model hamiltonian as@xmath24where @xmath25 depends on the variables @xmath26 of the accessor and @xmath27 is the external field used to prepare the initial states of the accessor .",
    "we assume that @xmath27 is so strong that the system - accessor coupling can be ignored when the external field is switched on .",
    "therefore , we can formally use the step  function @xmath28 to describe the periodic control scheme .",
    "[ fig : controlscehme ] illustrates this switch on - off  duality control scheme . here",
    "the basic element is what we call control cycle ( dashed rectangular area in fig .",
    "[ fig : controlscehme ] ) consisting of the following two steps :    1 .   in the time interval @xmath29",
    ", the interaction is broken between the accessor and the controlled system , @xmath30 , and the accessor is prepared on the state @xmath31 with the classical field @xmath32 .",
    "2 .   in the time interval",
    "@xmath33 , the interaction between @xmath5 and @xmath4 is switched on @xmath34 and the classical field is removed . in this step ,",
    "the system evolves according to the effective hamiltonian @xmath35 .",
    "the encoding control information is recorded  by the system and we finish one cycle of manipulation .    in our scheme ,",
    "the controllability is realized by repeating this cycle .",
    "in this section , we consider the complete controllability of the controlled system @xmath5 with the above indirect scheme . for simplicity , we only consider the case where the controlled system @xmath5 is an @xmath36-level system . to explore the controllability",
    ", we define the set of discrete evolution operators @xmath37each element of which represents a manipulation completed in @xmath38 control cycles . in the @xmath39 cycle , the interaction between @xmath5 and @xmath4 is switched on for @xmath40 .",
    "the set of attainable states from the state @xmath41 is @xmath42where @xmath43 is the initial state of the controlled system . by definition",
    ", @xmath44 is a semigroup and a subset of the lie group @xmath45 .",
    "mathematically , the subsystem @xmath5 is completely controllable if @xmath46 is the whole lie group @xmath47 .",
    "however , physically speaking , this condition is by far too strong",
    ". it would be well acceptable to call @xmath5 completely controllable if an arbitrary state of @xmath5 can be approached by the state in @xmath48 to an arbitrary precision .",
    "this latter condition means that the closure @xmath49 of @xmath44 in @xmath50 is just @xmath47 itself . in view of this consideration",
    ", we will investigate @xmath49 .",
    "as far as complete controllability is concerned it is meaningful to investigate under what conditions @xmath49 is equal to @xmath47 . to this end",
    "we need to go into the details of @xmath6 and @xmath16 .",
    "but we will content ourself with considering a special case , which illustrates the main idea .",
    "we assume that for each @xmath51 the hamiltonian @xmath16 takes the form @xmath52 , where @xmath19 is a parameter that can be manipulated freely to enable @xmath53 to take zero or some real fixed number . for convenience , the model with this property",
    "will be referred to as the simplified model . and @xmath54 can be arbitrarily large , if necessarily .",
    "this fact turns out to be crucial for the complete controllability .    under the above assumption ,",
    "the effective hamiltonian reads@xmath55this is exactly the hamiltonian broadly discussed in the direct quantum control @xcite .",
    "but here it appears naturally in our scheme .",
    "so in some sense it can be said that the scheme proposed in this paper is at the bottom of the broadly discussed direct quantum control scheme .",
    "especially , the method of controllability proving developed in direct quantum control theory applies in our present case .",
    "the following two lemmas are essentially taken from ref .",
    "we would rather omit the proof .",
    "but we would like to point out that in the proof of lemma 2 the condition `` @xmath56 can be arbitrarily large , if necessarily '' plays a crucial role .",
    "the closure @xmath49 of @xmath44 is a lie subgroup of @xmath47 .",
    "[ lemma1 ]    in the simplified model , for each @xmath51 the single parameter subgroup @xmath57 of @xmath50 belongs to @xmath49 .",
    "lemma2    for the simplified model , if the lie algebra @xmath58 of @xmath47 can be generated by @xmath59 and @xmath60 s , then @xmath61",
    ".    * proof . *",
    "denote by @xmath62 the lie algebra of @xmath63 , which is a lie subgroup of @xmath47 according to lemma 1 .",
    "it directly follows from lemma 2 that @xmath64 for each @xmath51 . on the other hand for @xmath65 @xmath66by definition .",
    "but @xmath49 is a group , this should be true for an arbitrary @xmath40 .",
    "consequently , we have @xmath67 , and hence @xmath68 . finally , as @xmath69 and @xmath60 s generate the lie algebra @xmath58 and @xmath47 is a connected lie group we can conclude that @xmath61 .",
    "the proof of the proposition is thus completed .",
    "we have proved the controllability of the simplified model . in this model ,",
    "the control is attained by repeatedly and properly preparing the initial states of the accessor and the controlled system works as a detector , which records and reads the manipulation information encoded in the initial states of the accessor .",
    "this is also the main idea of the idqc proposed in this paper .",
    "in this section , we illustrate the above control scheme and its controllability with an example : a two - level accessor controls one qubit . in this simple example",
    ", we show that the scheme is equivalent to that of the direct quantum control .",
    "let the controlled system be a qubit described by the hamiltonian @xmath70 and the accessor be a two - level system with the free hamiltonian @xmath71 .",
    "we couple the controlled system and the accessor with the interaction @xmath72 .",
    "thus the total hamiltonian of the system reads @xmath73     and then the interaction is switched on for a time interval @xmath74 .",
    "the system evolves under the effective hamiltonian .",
    "this corresponds to the evolution on the bloch sphere along path @xmath75 .",
    "secondly , the interaction is switched off for @xmath76 and the system evolves under its free hamiltonian .",
    "the system evolves along the path @xmath77.,width=7 ]    it is easily seen that if the initial state of the accessor is @xmath78 , the effective hamiltonian defined above reads @xmath79if the initial state of accessor is @xmath80 , we obtain the effective hamiltonian@xmath81this effective hamiltonian is equivalent to the hamiltonian of a qubit controlled by a transverse magnetic field the direction of which can be reversed .    obviously , we have @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 /2i\\in su\\left ( 2\\right ) $ ] , producing the generators of the lie algebra @xmath85 .",
    "thus when @xmath86 proposition 1 applies and we conclude that the system is controllable .",
    "next , we would follow the controlling process step by step .",
    "the time evolution operator of the controlled system is calculated straightforward as@xmath87 , \\]]where @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "suppose that the initial state of @xmath5 is @xmath90 .",
    "first we close the interaction by taking @xmath91 and use the classical field to prepare the accessor @xmath4 in the initial state @xmath92 .",
    "then we stop the action of the classical field and switch on the interaction .",
    "driven by the effective hamiltonian @xmath93 for the time interval @xmath74 , the quantum state of the controlled system becomes @xmath94 \\otimes \\left\\vert 0\\right\\rangle _ { a},\\]]where @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "noticing that the wave function of the total system remains factorized , we obtain the state of the controlled system after the evolution as @xmath97 .   \\label{fstate}\\]]in this equation , when @xmath98 , we obtain @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "thus the state of the system is approximately@xmath101after that , we switch off the interaction and the free evolution of the system for a time interval @xmath76 . the state of the system then reads@xmath102the control protocol here is illustrated in the fig .",
    "[ fig : example ] . since an arbitrary state of the two - level system can be expresses as @xmath103",
    ", we can conclude that we can prepare the two level system to arbitrary states by choosing appropriate @xmath74 and @xmath76 .",
    "this proves the controllability directly .    before concluding our paper ,",
    "we point out that there is no limit to the control scheme , and it is different from the observation in ref .",
    "@xcite that there is a phase uncertainty due to the standard quantum limit .",
    "the hamiltonian we use here is non - demolition of the accessor , while the one in ref .",
    "@xcite is of the system . and",
    "it preserves the separability of the wave function .",
    "therefore , there is no control limit to our scheme .",
    "in this paper , we propose a general scheme to manipulate the quantum states of a quantum system by preparing the initial state of the accessor .",
    "different from our previous approach @xcite , we control the controlled system by preparing the state of the accessor . based on the scheme , we simplify the model and point out its equivalence to broadly investigated direct quantum control . and we take advantage of the proof of controllability of direct quantum control and prove the controllability of arbitrary finite dimensional quantum system .",
    "we investigated the concrete control process of our indirect control scheme with two - level system as an example .",
    "it is found that the two - level system to reach any given target state by preparing the initial state of accessor ( a qubit)only one time and the time evolution supplies the relative phase of the target state .",
    "finally , we point out that it is very important to study the concrete control protocol of our scheme for arbitrary finite dimensional quantum systems proposed in this paper . generalization of our approach to infinite dimensional quantum systems will be also in consideration .",
