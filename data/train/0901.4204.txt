    "spectral analysis by means of non - lte model - atmosphere techniques has for a long time been regarded as a domain of specialists . within the _ german astrophysical virtual observatory _",
    "( _ _ gavo _ _ ) project , we have created the vo service _ theossa _ ( theoretical simple spectra access ) .",
    "a vo user may use pre - calculated grids of spectral energy distributions ( seds , in a pilot phase calculated by the _ tbingen model atmosphere package _ ( _ _ tmap _ _ ) for hot , compact stars only ) which are ready to use and it may be interpolated between them to match the user - required parameters .",
    "this is the easiest way to use synthetic seds calculated from non - lte model atmospheres .",
    "if individual parameters are requested which do not fit to an already existing sed in the database , the vo user is guided to _ _ tmaw__. with this www interface , the vo user may calculate an individual model atmosphere , requesting effective temperature , surface gravity , and mass fractions of h , he , c , n , and o ( more species will be included in the future ) . for this calculation ,",
    "standard model atoms are used which are provided within the _ tbingen model - atom database _",
    "( _ _ tmad _ _ ) . since the vo user can do this without detailed knowledge of the programme code working in the background , the access to individually calculated seds is as simple as the use of pre - calculated seds - however",
    ", the calculation needs some time ( depending on the number of species considered , the wall - clock time is ranging from hours to a few days ) .",
    "standard seds ( e.g. within wavelength ranges of @xmath0  and @xmath1 ) of all calculated model atmospheres are automatically ingested into the _ gavo _",
    "data base and , thus , it is growing in time .",
    "example seds are show in fig .",
    "[ d.17-fig-1 ] .    in case",
    "that a detailed spectral analysis is performed , an experienced vo user may create an own atomic data file tailored to a specific purpose considering all necessary species and calculate own model atmospheres and seds .",
    "a similar approach is in preparation , using the newly developed _",
    "hotblast _ non - lte code for spherically expanding atmospheres .",
    "_ hotblast _ uses as an input the atmospheric structure of the static _ tmap _ model atmospheres to simulate the atmosphere below the wind region .",
    "spectral analysis by means of nlte model - atmosphere techniques requires the calculation of extended grids , varying photospheric parameters like e.g. effective temperature , surface gravity , and element abundances . since this is far beyond our computational capacity at the tbingen institute ( iaat ) , calculation of such model - atmosphere grids in the framework of _ _",
    "is necessary .",
    "_ _ _ _ is a research and development project that has created a grid research infrastructure for the german astronomical community during the years 2005 to 2009 .",
    "based on the globus toolkit ( gt4 ) middleware , _ _ connects compute cluster and storage resources with desktops and specialized hardware , e.g. robotic telescopes ( breitling et al .",
    "it resulted in several scientific applications and implements novel grid services , such as the information service _ stellaris _ ( hgqvist et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "carrying out the _ tmap _ model calculations on the compute resources of _ _ ensures a much better scaling to a potentially high number of requests than it would be possible on local compute hardware . also , the grid as a whole is more reliable than a local cluster : even when some of its resources fail , sufficient alternatives are available , given a stable network connection .",
    "when a new model is required , the _ theossa _ service calls a script package that independently submits jobs to computational grid resources .",
    "this package was originally developed for a different _ _ use case , but is parameterized so that it can easily be adopted to other implementations of so - called _ atomic grid jobs_. the label _ atomic _ in this context refers to a specific type of application for which all input data is transferred together with the software and there is no need for inter - process communication .",
    "the grid is thus used as a task farming mechanism .",
    "the flexible gt4 middleware is able to perform more complex requirements , but we found task farming to be an important requirement of many scientific use cases , such as _",
    "thus transfers of the _ tmap _ model - atmosphere software , input data and , upon completion , results become part of the standard job submission process in globus toolkit .",
    "the process is further explained in fig .",
    "[ d.17-fig-2 ] .",
    "we take advantage of the gt4 web services and control the process by a jsdl template ( job submission description language ) .",
    "whenever a new job is initiated , the template is applied to the specific case and a target machine is selected from a given list .",
    "optionally , a grid job broker can be used . upon completion of the calculation ,",
    "the results are passed on to the _ theossa _ service which stores it in its database and notifies the user .",
    "we thank the _ gavo _ and _ _ teams for support .",
