    "the construction of bing doubling , introduced in  @xcite , converts a knot @xmath5 into a two component link @xmath6 .",
    "the construction can be iterated , producing an entire family of links @xmath7 , where @xmath8 has @xmath9 components .",
    "figure  [ example ] illustrates the figure eight knot @xmath0 , its bing double @xmath6 , and the second iterated bing double @xmath10 .    from several perspectives , bing doubles",
    "are indistinguishable from each other .",
    "for example , all bing doubles have vanishing arf invariants , vanishing multivariable tristram - levine signatures , and trivial multivariable alexander polynomial  @xcite .",
    "in addition , all bing doubles are boundary links , and hence have vanishing milnor @xmath11 invariants  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the links @xmath8 bound identical embedded @xmath9 component surfaces in @xmath12 as follows : for every knot @xmath0 , @xmath8 bounds a surface where one component is a punctured torus and the rest are disks ( see section  [ sectionbackground ] ) .    the perspective from which bing doubles become interesting is the perspective of concordance . some  but not all  bing doubles are slice .",
    "work of casson and freedman in four - dimensional surgery first highlighted the importance of understanding when bing doubles are slice  @xcite .",
    "recent years have seen significant progress in this direction ; references include  @xcite . these investigations culminated with the following result of cha - kim  @xcite : if @xmath5 is not algebraically slice , then the @xmath13iterated bing double of @xmath0 , @xmath8 , is not slice .    , @xmath6 , and @xmath10 . ]",
    "our results point out additional ways in which iterated bing doubles are distinguished .",

    "( compare this to the parallel result for surfaces in @xmath12 mentioned above . ) furthermore , if a link @xmath15 is concordant to @xmath8 , then the genera of the surfaces which the link @xmath15 bounds will increase exponentially in @xmath2 .    to make this precise ,",

    "examples of such invariants include half the murasugi signature function  @xcite , @xmath24 the normalized levine - tristram @xmath25signatures  @xcite , @xmath26 , and , in the smooth category , the ozsvth - szab @xmath27 invariant  @xcite .",

    "this is the integers localized at two , the ring of rational numbers expressible with odd denominator .",
    "although much of our work could be modified so that results could be stated in the @xmath32coefficient setting , the proofs demand working with @xmath20 .",

    "let @xmath34 denote the positive whitehead double of the trefoil knot .",
    "since @xmath34 has trivial alexander polynomial , it is topologically slice  @xcite .",
    "however , as first shown in  @xcite , the ozsvth - szab @xmath27 invariant is nontrival .",
    "thus we have the following corollary .. 1 in    consider the knot @xmath35 , the untwisted whitehead double of the trefoil knot .",

    "the following result indicates one reason why , from the 4dimensional perspective , the appropriate measure of complexity for an iterated bing double @xmath8 is not given by the 4genus , but rather by the minimum 3genus of boundary links concordant to @xmath8 .    for any knot @xmath5 and @xmath38",
    ", there exists a collection of disjoint surfaces @xmath39 embedded in @xmath12 such that @xmath40 , genus(@xmath41 , and @xmath42 for @xmath43 .",
    "it is clear from the diagram that for any one component , say @xmath44 , of @xmath8 , there is a second component @xmath45 such that by changing two crossings ( of opposite sign ) between them , they become unlinked . for instance , in figure  [ example ] illustrating @xmath46 , either of the smallest circles can be unclasped from its adjoining loop by changing two crossings .",
    "notice that once that one circle is unlinked , the entire link becomes trivial .",
    "the trace of the homotopy corresponding to those crossing changes yields a singular concordance from @xmath8 to the unlink , with the only singularities being a pair of double points between two embedded annuli .",
    "capping the annuli off with disks in @xmath12 yields a set of singular disks in @xmath12 bounded by @xmath8 with the only singularities being a pair of double points between two of the disks .",
    "if the two double points are @xmath47 and @xmath48 on disks @xmath49 and @xmath50 , then disk neighborhood of @xmath47 and @xmath48 on @xmath49 can be removed and replaced by an annulus in the boundary of a tubular neighborhood of an embedded arc on @xmath50 that joins @xmath47 to @xmath48 .",
    "the effect is to convert @xmath49 into a punctured torus that is disjoint from @xmath50 as well as all the other disks .",
    "( that the resulting surface is orientable follows from the fact that the two crossing changes were of opposite sign . )",
    "this yields the desired surfaces .",
    "there are other ways to prove this theorem .",
    "most simply , any one component bounds a punctured torus in @xmath14 in the complement of the remaining components .",
    "the remaining components form an unlink , so bound disks in @xmath12 .",
    "the given proof has the advantage that it also shows that the _ clasp number _ of @xmath8 is 2 .",
    "( see  @xcite for one discussion of the clasp number of knots . )",
    "the clasp number is another 4dimensional measure of the complexity of a knot or link , but as we have just seen , it too is of limited value in studying bing doubles .",

    "we begin with the link @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the component of @xmath56 corresponding to the marked node of @xmath53 of depth one .",
    "because @xmath53 has a node of depth one , it follows that @xmath59 can be represented by the diagram on the left in figure  [ base ] , where the solid torus @xmath60 contains all components of @xmath59 except for @xmath58 . taking the 2fold cover of @xmath14 branched over @xmath58 , the remaining components of the link @xmath56 lift upstairs to the link represented on the right in figure  [ base ] , where each of the two components of the preimage of @xmath60 maps homemorphically to @xmath60 .",

    "the construction of the previous proof can be repeated , adding the 2handle to @xmath19 instead of to @xmath12 .",
