    "in a geometrical setting , symmetries are connected with isometries associated with killing vectors and , more generally , killing tensors on the configurations space of the system .",
    "an example is the motion of a point particle in a space with isometries @xcite , which is a physicist s way of studying the geodesic structure of a manifold . in @xcite",
    "such studies were extended to spinning space - times described by supersymmetric extensions of the geodesic motion , and in@xcite it was shown that this can give rise to interesting new types of supersymmetry as well .",
    "the geometric duality between a metric @xmath0 and its non - degenerate killing tensor @xmath1 was discussed in @xcite .",
    "the relation was generalized to spinning spaces , but only at the expense of introducing torsion .",
    "the physical interpretation of the dual metrics was not clarified @xcite .",
    "the geometrical interpretation of killing tensors was investigated in@xcite .",
    "recently the structural equations for a killing tensor of order two was investigated and the geometric duality between @xmath2 and a non - degenerate killing tensor @xmath3 was analyzed in@xcite .",
    "an interesting example of an einstein s metric which admits killing - yano tensors is taub - nut metric .",
    "taub - nut metric is involved in many modern studies in physics .",
    "for example the kaluza - klein monopole of gross and perry @xcite and of sorkin @xcite was obtained by embedding the taub - nut gravitational instanton into five - dimensional kaluza - klein theory .",
    "remarkably , the same object has re - emerged in the study of monopole scattering . in the long distance limit ,",
    "neglecting radiation , the relative motion of the bps monopoles is described by the geodesics of this space @xcite@xcite .",
    "the dynamics of well - separated monopoles is completely soluble and has a kepler type symmetry @xcite .",
    "the geodesic motion of pseudo - classical spinning particles in euclidian taub - nut were analyzed in @xcite and the symmetries of extended taub - nut metrics recently were studied in @xcite .",
    "taub - nut metric admits four killing - yano tensors which generate four non - degenerate killing tensors@xcite . on the other hand for a given manifold @xmath2 which admits a non - degenerate killing tensor @xmath3 two types of dual metrics exist @xcite .",
    "an interesting question is to investigate the connection between the symmetries of dual taub - nut metrics and the symmetries of taub - nut metric .    for these reasons",
    "the symmetries of the taub - nut dual metrics will be analyzed .",
    "the aim of this paper is to investigate the _ generic _ and _ non - generic _ symmetries corresponding to geodesic motion of pseudo - classical spinning particles on the taub - nut dual metrics.we will investigate the existence of the runge - lenz symmetry for the dual metrics .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "the geometric duality is presented . in section 3",
    "we investigate the symmetries corresponding to taub  nut dual metrics and we construct the spinning space . in section 4",
    "we present our conclusions .    in appendix 1",
    "we write down christoffel symbols and the scalar curvature for two interesting dual metrics .",
    "the calculus for all taub - nut dual metrics were done , but due to their huge and complicated expressions we can not write them out in this paper . in appendix 2 we present two plots of scalar curvature of two interesting dual metrics .",
    "the equation of motion of a particle on a geodesic is derived from the action @xmath4 the hamiltonian has the form @xmath5 where the poisson brackets are @xmath6 .",
    "let us suppose that the metric @xmath2 admits a killing tensor field @xmath3 .",
    "a killing tensor is a symmetric tensor which satisfies the following relation :    @xmath7    where @xmath8 denote covariant derivatives . from the covariant components @xmath3 of the killing tensor one can construct a constant of motion @xmath9",
    ". it can be easy verified that @xmath10 .",
    "the formal similarity between the constants of motion h and k , and the symmetrical nature of the condition implying the existence of the killing tensor amount to a reciprocal relation between two different models : the model with hamiltonian h and constant of motion k , and a model with constant of motion h and hamiltonian k.the relation between the two models has a geometrical interpretation : it implies that if @xmath3 are the contravariant components of a killing tensor with respect to the metric @xmath2 , then @xmath2 must represent a killing tensor with respect to the metric defined by @xmath3 .",
    "when @xmath3 has an inverse we interpret it as the metric of another space and we can define the associated riemann - christoffel connection @xmath11 as usual through the metric postulate @xmath12 . here",
    "@xmath13 represents the covariant derivative with respect to @xmath3 .",
    "this reciprocal relation between the metric structure of pairs of spaces constitutes a duality relation : performing the operation of mapping a killing tensor to a metric twice leads back to the original theory .",
    "the geometric duality between @xmath2 and a killing tensor @xmath3 was analyzed in @xcite.in this case killing s vectors equations in the dual space have the following form @xcite @xmath14 here @xmath15 are killing vectors in dual spaces .",
    "let us suppose that metric @xmath2 admits a killing - yano tensor @xmath16 .",
    "a killing - yano tensor is an antisymmetric tensor @xcite which satisfies @xmath17    the corresponding killing - yano equations in the dual space has the form@xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a killing - yano tensor on the dual manifold .",
    "d represents the covariant derivative with respect to @xmath2 .",
    "the four - dimensional taub - nut metric depends on a parameter @xmath20 which can be positive or negative , depending on the application ; for @xmath21 it represents a nonsingular solution of the self - dual euclidean equation and as such is interpreted as a gravitational instanton .",
    "the standard form of the line element is    @xmath22    the killing vectors for the metric ( [ ade ] ) have the following form : @xmath23 where @xmath24    the metric ( [ ade ] ) admits four killing - yano tensors@xcite .",
    "three of these , denoted by @xmath25 are special because they are covariant constant . in the two - form notation",
    "the explicit expressions are @xmath26 where the @xmath27 are standard expressions in terms of the 3-dimensional spherical co - ordinates @xmath28 .",
    "the fourth killing - yano tensor has the following form @xmath29    now we would like to investigate the symmetries of the dual taub - nut metrics .",
    "we will construct firstly the taub - nut dual metrics using the geometric duality between @xmath2 and @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "we know that when a manifold m admits a killing - yano tensor @xmath16 we can construct a corresponding killing tensor@xcite @xmath3 as @xmath30    using ( [ eky ] ) and ( [ ky ] ) the line element for the dual metric becomes    @xmath31    the taub - nut metric admits three more second - rank killing tensors of the form @xcite @xmath32 here @xmath33 and @xmath34 are given by ( [ kyf ] ) and([ky ] ) .",
    "they form a conserved vector of runge - lenz type .",
    "using ( [ ru ] ) the line element for the dual metrics becomes @xmath35    we found that the dual metric ( [ kilten ] ) has the same killing vectors like taub - nut metric ( [ ade ] ) because relation ( [ kiltex ] ) is identically satisfied .",
    "for @xmath36 the corresponding metric from ( [ taubi ] ) admits two killing vectors ( [ vec14 ] ) and ( [ vec15 ] ) but for @xmath37 we found from ( [ kiltex ] ) only one killing vector ( [ vec14 ] ) .    because the weyl tensor of ( [ kilten ] ) has non - vanishing components + ( e.g @xmath38 )",
    ", the metric is not conformally flat .",
    "we have obtained the same result for ( [ taubi ] ) but the expressions are too long to be provided here .",
    "now we would like to investigate the killing - yano tensors of order two for the dual metrics ( [ kilten],[taubi ] ) .",
    "we have six independent components of killing - yano tensor @xmath16 and 24 independent equations ( [ anoua ] ) .    replacing @xmath39 in ( [ anoua ] ) and using the corresponding expressions of christoffel s symbols for ( [ kilten ] ) we get a set of killing - yano equations .",
    "we found that ( [ anoua ] ) has no solution , therefore the dual metrics ( [ kilten ] ) and ( [ taubi ] ) have no extra symmetry of runge - lenz type .    in @xcite using geometric duality between @xmath0 and @xmath1 four dual tab - nut metrics were found .",
    "the inverse matrix of the covariant form from ( [ kilten ] ) give us the dual line element @xmath40 and the dual metrics corresponding to runge - lenz vector have the following form ( for more details see @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath41    next step is to investigate the symmetries of the metrics ( [ elem],[31eq ] ) .",
    "if we make the transformation to a new variable u as @xmath42 the line element ( [ elem ] ) becomes    @xmath43    where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are given by @xmath46 .",
    "the metric ( [ alta ] ) is a particular form of extended taub - nut metric presented in @xcite . on the other hand , in the case of geometric duality between @xmath0 and @xmath1 the equations ( [ kiltex ] ) and ( [ anoua ] ) are not valid ( for more details see @xcite ) .",
    "because of this the symmetries of the metrics ( [ elem],[31eq ] ) will be investigated using ( see @xcite ) the killing vectors equations @xmath47    and the killing - yano equations @xmath48 solving ( [ kilnou ] ) we found that the dual metric ( [ elem ] ) admits the same killing vectors as metric ( [ ade]).this result is in agreement with those from@xcite . for @xmath36 , ( [ kilnou ] ) give us for the corresponding metric in ( [ 31eq ] ) two killing vectors ( [ vec14 ] ) and ( [ vec15 ] ) . in the case",
    "@xmath37 from ( [ 31eq ] ) we found only one killing vector ( [ vec14 ] ) for the corresponding metrics .",
    "now we investigate if the dual metrics ( [ elem],[31eq ] ) admits killing - yano tensors of order two .",
    "our strategy is quite straightforward in this case .",
    "we simply write down all the components of the equation ( [ yanotex ] ) explicitly .",
    "the total number of components of @xmath16 is six , while the number of independent equations for eq.([yanotex ] ) is 24 .",
    "@xmath49    solving ( [ tabel ] ) we found no solution for the metrics ( [ elem ] ) and ( [ 31eq ] ) .",
    "then the dual metrics ( [ elem],[31eq ] ) have no killing - yano tensors and runge - lenz type symmetry .",
    "the weyl tensor has non - vanishing components for ( [ elem])(e.g .",
    "@xmath50 ) and then the metric in not conformally flat",
    ". metrics ( [ 31eq ] ) are not conformally flat because they have non - vanishing weyl tensor components , but all expressions are too long to be written here .",
    "an action for the geodesic of spinning space is : @xmath51 the overdot denotes an ordinary proper - time derivative @xmath52 , whilst the covariant derivative of a grassmann variable @xmath53 is defined by @xmath54 . in general , the symmetries of a spinning - particle model can be divided into two classes .",
    "first , there are conserved quantities which exist in any theory and these are called _ generic _ constants of motion .",
    "it was shown that for a spinning particle model defined by the action ( [ spin ] ) there are four generic symmetries @xcite .    1 .",
    "proper -time translations and the corresponding constant of motion are given by the hamiltonian : @xmath55 2 .",
    "supersymmetry generated by the supercharge @xmath56 3 .",
    "chiral symmetry generated by the chiral charge @xmath57 4 .",
    "dual supersymmetry , generated by the dual supercharge @xmath58 here @xmath59 represents the covariant momentum .",
    "the second kind of conserved quantities , called _ non - generic _ , depend on the explicit form of the metric @xmath60 .",
    "_ non - generic _ symmetries are associated with the existence of killing- yano tensors on a given manifold .",
    "the existence of a killing - yano tensor @xmath16 of the bosonic manifold is equivalent to the existence of a supersymmetry for the spinning particle with supercharge    @xmath61 satisfies @xmath62 , where @xmath63 .    for the metric ( [ kilten ] )",
    "we found the _",
    "generic _ symmetries ( [ prime][ultim ] ) in the following form    @xmath64    @xmath65    @xmath66    @xmath67    because the determinants of all dual metrics ( [ taubi],[elem],[31eq ] ) , do not vanish we have similar expressions , in corresponding cases , for the _ generic _ symmetries + ( [ prime][ultim ] ) .",
    "as it was shown above the dual metrics have no killing - yano tensors , and because of this we have no _ non - generic _ symmetries for metrics ( [ kilten ] , [ taubi],[elem],[31eq ] ) .",
    "recently geometric duality was analyzed for a metric which admits a non - degenerate killing tensor of order two @xcite . for a given manifold which admits a non - degenerate killing tensor of order two , geometric duality",
    "give us two types of dual metrics @xcite .",
    "an interesting example arises when the manifold admits killing - yano tensors because they generate killing tensors .    in this paper",
    "the symmetries of the dual taub - nut metrics were investigated .",
    "taub - nut metric admits four killing - yano tensors of order two and we have four corresponding dual metrics .",
    "we have obtained that the number of killing vectors of the dual taub - nut metrics depend drastically on their particular form .",
    "we found that metrics ( [ kilten],[elem ] ) have the same killing vectors as the taub - nut metric ( [ ade ] ) , the corresponding dual metrics for @xmath36 in ( [ taubi],[31eq ] ) have two killing vectors ( [ vec14],[vec15 ] ) , and for @xmath37 we get only one killing vector ( [ vec14 ] ) .",
    "we have obtained , by solving killing - yano equations , that all dual taub - nut metrics do not have killing - yano tensors .",
    "this means that all dual metrics do no admit extra symmetries of runge - lenz type .",
    "the scalar curvature of taub  nut metric ( [ ade ] ) is zero , but the corresponding dual metrics ( [ kilten],[taubi],[elem],[31eq ] ) have non vanishing scalar curvatures and no runge - lenz vector .",
    "we found that the scalar curvature of dual metric ( [ kilten ] ) is positive and the corresponding scalar curvature for ( [ elem ] ) is negative .",
    "we have obtained that the dual metric ( [ elem ] ) is a special case of extended taub - nut metric given in @xcite .",
    "we obtained also that all dual taub - nut metrics are not conformally flat .",
    "the spinning space was constructed and the _ generic _ and _ non - generic _ symmetries of the dual taub - nut metrics were analyzed .",
    "we found that dual taub - nut metrics have not _ non - generic _ symmetries .",
    "our result differs from those presented in @xcite .",
    "geometric duality , in case of taub - nut metric , reduces the number of symmetries of the dual metrics . finding the number of symmetries of dual metrics for a given manifold which admits a killing tensor is an interesting problem , and it requires further investigation .",
