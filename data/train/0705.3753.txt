    "as of today , theoretical investigations of the baryon - baryon interaction in the strangeness @xmath0 sector were performed within the meson - exchange picture @xcite as well as in the constituent quark model @xcite . in both approaches the assumption of @xmath1 symmetry is an essential prerequisite .",
    "it allows to connect the doubly strange cascade - nucleon ( @xmath3 ) and hyperon - hyperon ( @xmath4 ) interactions ( @xmath5 ) to the hyperon - nucleon ( @xmath6 ) and nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath7 ) interactions , i.e. to systems where a wealth of experimental information is available , which can then be used to constrain the parameters inherent to those approaches .",
    "indeed , the experimental knowledge on the @xmath3 and @xmath4 interactions themselves is quite poor . until the beginning of this century the only information available came from doubly strange hypernuclei and , moreover ,",
    "only three candidates for such hypernuclei were reported @xcite .",
    "the @xmath8 binding energies derived from these events indicated a strongly attractive @xmath9 @xmath8 interaction . however , more recently a new candidate for @xmath10 with a much lower binding energy was identified @xcite , the so - called nagara event , suggesting that the @xmath8 interaction should be only moderately attractive .",
    "this conjecture is also in line with evidence provided by the latest searches for the @xmath11 dibaryon , a bound state in the @xmath0 sector proposed by jaffe back in 1977 @xcite , whose existence is now considered to be practically ruled out @xcite .",
    "( see also the theoretical works @xcite concerning the attraction in the @xmath8 system . )",
    "very recently doubly strange baryon - baryon scattering data at lower energies , below @xmath12 gev , were deduced for the first time @xcite .",
    "an upper limit of @xmath13 mb at @xmath14 confidence level was provided for elastic @xmath15 scattering , and for the @xmath16 cross section at @xmath17 mev a value of @xmath18 mb was reported @xcite .    over the last decade",
    "a new powerful tool for understanding hadronic interactions has emerged , namely _ chiral effective field theory _ ( eft ) .",
    "this approach , which was pioneered by weinberg in the early nineties , incorporates explicitly the scales and symmetries of quantum chromodynamics .",
    "an important advantage of eft is that there is an underlying power counting that allows to improve calculations systematically by going to higher orders in a perturbative expansion and , at the same time , it allows to estimate theoretical uncertainties .",
    "in addition , it is possible to derive two- and corresponding three - baryon forces in a consistent way .",
    "the concepts of chiral eft have been applied in the last decade to the @xmath7 interaction and to the physics of light nuclei , resulting in a high - precision description of the experimental data , see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein .",
    "recently we utilized the chiral eft framework for investigating the @xmath6 interaction .",
    "in particular , we showed that the leading order ( lo ) chiral eft successfully describes the available @xmath6 scattering data @xcite .",
    "also the binding energies of the light hypernuclei are predicted well within chiral eft @xcite .",
    "the @xmath3 and @xmath4 interactions have not been studied using chiral eft so far . in this letter",
    "we report on the first chiral eft investigation of the @xmath0 sector , starting with a lo calculation . for this purpose",
    "we extend the recently constructed lo chiral eft potential of the @xmath6 interaction @xcite .",
    "we employ @xmath1 relations to connect the doubly strange with the singly strange channels and we confront the lo chiral eft predictions with the ( poor ) experimental knowledge .",
    "we construct the chiral effective potentials for the @xmath0 sector at lo using the weinberg power counting similar to the @xmath6 case considered in @xcite .",
    "the lo potential consists of four - baryon contact terms without derivatives and of one - pseudoscalar - meson exchanges .",
    "the lo @xmath1 invariant contact terms for the octet baryon - baryon interactions that are hermitian and invariant under lorentz transformations were discussed in @xcite and we refer the reader to these works for details .",
    "the pertinent lagrangians read @xmath19 here , the labels @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the dirac indices of the particles , the label @xmath22 denotes the five elements of the clifford algebra , @xmath23 is the usual irreducible octet representation of @xmath1 given by @xmath24 and the brackets denote taking the trace in the three - dimensional flavor space .",
    "the clifford algebra elements are here actually diagonal @xmath25-matrices .",
    "the @xmath3 and @xmath4 partial wave potentials derived from the above lagrangians are given in table  [ tab:2.1 ] for the singlet s - waves and in table  [ tab:2.1a ] for the triplet s - waves .",
    "the coefficients @xmath26 and @xmath27 are linear combinations of the low - energy coefficients @xmath28 s in eq .",
    "( [ eq:2.1 ] ) and refer to the central and spin - spin parts of the potential , see e.g. ref .",
    "the @xmath29 and @xmath30 potentials are listed also in tables  [ tab:2.1 ] and [ tab:2.1a ] for completeness .",
    "using the @xmath1 clebsch - gordan coefficients one can express the baryon - baryon potentials in terms of the @xmath1 irreducible representations , see e.g. @xcite and also @xcite .",
    "the last columns of tables  [ tab:2.1 ] and [ tab:2.1a ] show the @xmath1 content of the various potentials .",
    ".various lo baryon - baryon contact potentials for the @xmath9 partial wave in isospin basis .",
    "these potentials are flavor symmetric .",
    "@xmath31 etc .",
    "refers to the corresponding @xmath1 irreducible representation . [ cols=\"<,^,^,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     cross sections for those reactions and some more @xmath0 channels are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig:4.2 ] .",
    "the shaded bands show the cut - off dependence .",
    "we remark that the cross sections in fig .",
    "[ fig:4.2 ] ( a)-(c ) depend on the additional contact term , whereas the cross sections in fig .",
    "[ fig:4.2 ] ( d)-(f ) are independent of this term .",
    "thus , the latter results are genuine predictions of the @xmath6 eft interaction @xcite .",
    "obviously , the chiral eft results remain consistent with the experimental cross sections for the considered range of variations of the cut - off , cf .",
    "[ fig:4.2 ] ( b ) and ( c ) . in figs .",
    "[ fig:4.2 ] ( a ) , ( c ) , and ( e ) one clearly sees the opening of the inelastic @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 channels , respectively .",
    "[ fig:4.2 ] ( e ) also reveals that the pure @xmath35 component of the @xmath3 cross section is predicted to be quite small at low and intermediate energies , but it increases rapidly near the opening of the @xmath34 channel .",
    "this behavior is very similar to that found for the nijmegen nsc97f model @xcite and the quark model of fujiwara et al .",
    "@xcite . from fig .",
    "[ fig:4.2 ] ( d ) one observes that the @xmath36 cross section is rather large near threshold .",
    "this is also reflected in the corresponding scattering length , which is large too ( cf . table [ tab:4.1 ] ) and , therefore , rather sensitive to cut - off variations .",
    "we should mention , however , that the results in this channel will change significantly once the coulomb interaction is taken into account .",
    "indeed , exploratory calculations including the coulomb force showed that the scattering lengths are reduced by about 40% and the sensitivity to the cut - off becomes much weaker .",
    "in this letter we have presented first results for the doubly strange @xmath3 and @xmath4 interactions ( @xmath5 ) obtained within a chiral effective field theory approach based on the weinberg power counting , derived analogous to the @xmath6 system studied in @xcite , by relating the @xmath0 baryon - baryon interactions via @xmath1 symmetry to the @xmath6 interactions .",
    "the lo chiral potential consists of two pieces : firstly , the longer - ranged one - pseudoscalar - meson exchanges and secondly , shorter ranged four - baryon contact terms without derivatives .",
    "in addition to the five contact terms , already present and fixed in our study of the @xmath6 interaction , there appears an additional sixth contact term in the @xmath3 and @xmath4 systems that can only be fixed in the @xmath0 sector .",
    "the reaction amplitude is obtained by solving a regularized coupled - channels lippmann - schwinger equation for the lo chiral potential .",
    "we used an exponential regulator function to regularize the potential and applied cut  offs in the range between @xmath37 and @xmath38 mev . in order to incorporate the correct physical thresholds",
    ", we solved the lippmann - schwinger equation in the particle basis .",
    "we showed that the chiral eft predictions are consistent with the recently deduced doubly strange scattering cross sections .",
    "furthermore , a moderately attractive @xmath8 interaction could be achieved for natural values of the additional contact term  in line with recent empirical information on doubly strange hypernuclei .",
    "the presently available scattering data are , however , not sufficient to determine the value of the additional contact term more quantitatively .",
    "it is expected that in the coming years better - quality data on the fundamental @xmath3 and @xmath4 interactions as well as much more information about the physics of hypernuclei will become available at the new facilities j - parc ( tokai , japan ) and fair ( darmstadt , germany ) .",
    "the chiral eft developed here can then be used to analyze these upcoming data in a model - independent way .",
