    "the limiting distribution of the length of the longest increasing subsequence of a random permutation , was first determined by baik , deift , and johansson @xcite , who identified it as the tracy - widom distribution , which describes the limiting behavior of the largest eigenvalue of the gaussian unitary ensemble ( gue ) , as the size of the gue goes to infinity .",
    "the identification of the limiting distribution of @xmath7 , the length of the longest ( weakly ) increasing subsequence of a random word of length @xmath8 , whose letters are iid and chosen uniformly from an ordered , @xmath1-letter alphabet , was first made by tracy and widom @xcite .",
    "they showed that the limiting distribution of @xmath7 , properly centered and normalized , is that of the largest eigenvalue of the traceless @xmath3 gue . in the non - uniform iid case , its , tracy , and widom @xcite described the corresponding limiting distribution as that of the largest eigenvalue of one of the diagonal blocks ( corresponding to the highest probability ) in a direct sum of certain independent gue matrices .",
    "the number and respective dimensions of these matrices are determined by the multiplicities of the probabilities of choosing the letters , and the direct sum is subject again to an overall zero - trace type of condition .",
    "the well - known robinson - schensted - knuth ( rsk ) correspondence between sequences and pairs of young diagrams led tracy and widom @xcite to conjecture that the ( necessarily @xmath1-row and of the same shape ) young diagrams of a random word generated by an @xmath1-letter , uniform iid sequence have a limiting shape given by the joint distribution of the eigenvalues of a @xmath3 traceless element of the gue .",
    "since the length of the longest row of the young diagrams is precisely @xmath7 , this appears to be a natural generalization .",
    "johansson @xcite proved this conjecture using orthogonal polynomial methods .",
    "further , okounkov @xcite , and borodin , okounkov , and olshankii @xcite , as well as johansson @xcite , also answered a conjecture of baik , deift , and johansson @xcite regarding the limiting shape of the young diagrams associated to a random permutation of @xmath9 .",
    "in particular , as @xmath8 grows without bound , the lengths @xmath10 of the first @xmath11 rows of the young diagrams , appropriately centered and scaled , have the same limiting law as the @xmath11 largest eigenvalues of a @xmath12 element of the gue , a result first proved , for @xmath13 , in @xcite .",
    "extensions to the non - uniform iid case were addressed in its , tracy , and widom @xcite , who focused primarily on the top row of the young diagrams . here",
    "the obvious conjecture is that the limiting shape has rows whose suitably centered and normalized lengths have a joint distribution which is that of the whole spectrum of the direct sum of gue matrices described above .",
    "below , we prove this result as a special case of the markovian framework .",
    "kuperberg @xcite conjectured that if the word is generated by an irreducible , doubly - stochastic , cyclic markov chain , then the limiting distribution of the shape is still that of the joint distribution of the eigenvalues of a traceless @xmath3 element of the gue . for @xmath5 ,",
    "this was shown to be true by chistyakov and gtze @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , who , in view of further simulations , expressed doubts concerning the validity for @xmath6 . for @xmath4",
    ", we will show that the conjecture holds as well .",
    "however , for @xmath14 , this is no longer the case . indeed , some , but not all , cyclic markov chains lead to a limiting law as in the iid uniform case already obtained by johansson @xcite .",
    "the precise class of homogeneous markov chains with which kuperberg s conjecture is concerned is more specific than the ones we shall study .",
    "the irreducibility of the chain is a basic property we certainly must demand : each letter has to occur at some point following the occurrence of any given letter .",
    "moreover , the doubly - stochastic hypothesis ensures that we have a uniform stationary distribution .",
    "however , the cyclic ( also called _ circulant _ ) criterion , _",
    "i.e. _ , the markov transition matrix @xmath15 has entries satisfying @xmath16 , for @xmath17 ( where @xmath18 ) , is more restrictive : cyclicity implies but is not equivalent to @xmath15 being doubly stochastic . starting from a free - probability perspective , kuperberg was led to introduce this cyclicity restriction via simulations @xcite which appear to show that at least some irreducible , doubly - stochastic , _",
    "non-_cyclic markov chains do _ not _ produce such limiting behavior .",
    "the paper is organized in the following manner . in section @xmath19 , we present a combinatorial formulation of the @xmath7 problem and so obtain a functional of combinatorial quantities which describes the shape of the entire young diagrams with @xmath8 cells , along with a concise expression for the associated asymptotic covariance structure . in section @xmath20 , we apply markovian invariance principles to express the limiting shape of the young diagrams as a brownian functional for all irreducible , aperiodic , homogeneous markov chains ( without the cyclic or even the doubly - stochastic constraint . ) using this functional we are then able to answer kuperberg s conjecture . in section @xmath21 , we investigate , in further detail , various symmetries exhibited by the brownian functional and in particular obtain , for @xmath1 arbitrary , a necessary and sufficient condition for a cyclic markov chain to have the same limiting law as in the iid uniform case .",
    "still for @xmath1 arbitrary , a related characterization is also obtained for reversible markov chains with symmetric transition matrices , _",
    "i.e. _ in the doubly stochastic case . in section @xmath22 , we further explore connections between the various brownian functionals obtained as limiting laws and eigenvalues of random matrices .",
    "in particular , we relate the behavior of the terminal points of the brownian motions to the diagonals of certain gaussian random matrices , conjecturing that the off - diagonals scale according to some yet to be determined function of the spectrum of the covariance matrix governing the brownian motions . finally , in section @xmath23",
    ", we conclude with a brief discussion of natural extensions and complements to some of the ideas and results presented in the paper .",
    "the combinatorial development for the @xmath1-letter alphabet , as obtained in @xcite , resulted in @xmath24 partial sums @xmath25 , @xmath26 . using an even more straightforward development which involves @xmath1 quantities instead",
