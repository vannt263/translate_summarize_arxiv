    "the origin of recently discovered high - energy astrophysical neutrinos @xcite is not obvious . the flux of the neutrinos is quite large : they were observed already in two - year icecube data .",
    "the global distribution of arrival directions of the events is consistent with isotropy , as expected for their extragalactic origin , but the observed spectrum is a bit soft for powerful extragalactic sources .",
    "moreover , if the neutrinos are born in @xmath0-meson decays , which is the most natural astrophysical scenario , the accompanying flux of gamma rays from @xmath1 decays overshoots the observed isotropic diffuse photon flux measured by fermi lat @xcite below 820  gev unless a significant part of the neutrinos are of the galactic origin .",
    "this is because of electromagnetic cascades @xcite which transfer the energy of gamma rays from multi - tev to sub - tev bands by means of efficient @xmath2-pair production on the background radiation and subsequent inverse compton scattering . to overcome these troubles , models with several components of the neutrino flux of completely different origin , e.g.  from cosmic - ray interactions with the interstellar matter _ and _ from distant blazars ,",
    "are discussed . in these explanations , two very different classes of sources",
    "give roughly equal contributions to the observed neutrino flux by coincidence .",
    "another option is to consider optically thick sources which emit neutrinos but totally absorb photons .",
    "an interesting proposal to explain the icecube observation has been put forward in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the interactions of cosmic - ray protons escaping the galaxy with the circumgalactic gas result in the required diffuse neutrino flux .",
    "note that a similar mechanism has been proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite to contribute a significant amount to the diffuse gamma - ray background at energies @xmath3gev .",
    "the energy fluxes carried by diffuse gev photons and icecube sub - pev neutrinos are of the same order , and one may hope that they might have a common origin .    in this paper , we calculate the corresponding neutrino and gamma - ray fluxes ,",
    "account for propagation of photons and compare the resulting fluxes at the earth with the observational data obtained by icecube and fermi - lat .",
    "we demonstrate that the flux of secondary neutrinos from cosmic - ray interactions with the circumgalactic gas is insufficient to explain icecube astrophysical neutrino events , if realistic density of cosmic rays escaping the galaxy , normalized to the present - day cosmic - ray spectrum in the disk , is assumed . at the same time , secondary photons from the same interactions contribute substantially to the diffuse gamma - ray background at fermi - lat energies .",

    "recent observations suggest that our galaxy is surrounded by a huge ( extending to @xmath4  kpc from the galactic center ) halo of gas which we call here the milky way s corona in order to clearly distinguish it from the halo of stars whose size is approximately ten times smaller .",

    "@xcite suggested that the very same interactions may produce a significant part of the high - energy neutrino flux observed by icecube .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to calculate the corresponding neutrino and gamma - ray fluxes in a more precise way .",
    "there are two classes of observational results pointing to the existence of the milky - way gaseous corona :    * ovii and oviii absorption x - ray lines observed at zero redshift in the spectra of extragalactic sources and corresponding emission lines observed in the blank - sky spectrum , see e.g.  refs .",

    "x - ray spectroscopic observations are more precise statistically but have large systematic uncertainties because the oxygen is only a tracer of much more abundant hydrogen and other gases .",
    "derivation of the total gas density from these results depends crucially on the assumptions about the metallicity @xmath5 of the circumgalactic gas and of the fraction @xmath6 of the particular observed oxygen ion .",
    "the most precise studies  @xcite assume @xmath7 and @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the solar metallicity .",
    "these values are quite arbitrary ; moreover , they are assumed to be constant all the way up to the virial radius , while qualitative arguments suggest that @xmath5 should decrease with the galactocentric distance @xmath10 .",
    "in addition , recent simulations @xcite and ultraviolet ovi observations @xcite suggest that the hot gas is accompanied by a similar amount of cold and/or warm component , so that x - ray observations may underestimate the total amount of matter by a factor of two . therefore ,",
    "both the normalization and the radial dependence of the gas density inferred from the x - ray spectroscopy remain largely uncertain .",
    "contrary , estimates of the gas density from ram - pressure stripping of mw satellites are considerably less precise , but at the same time less model - dependent .    in ref .",

    "differential cross sections tabulated from qgsjet - ii-04 were used  @xcite .    the milky - way corona contribution is direction - dependent because of the non - central position of the sun in the galaxy .",

    "note that the amount of cosmic rays in a disk is often assumed to be proportional to the star formation rate which is the time derivative of the total mass .",
    "this is because cosmic - ray particles do not stay in a disk for long .    therefore , to calculate the photon , @xmath61 , and neutrino , @xmath63 , fluxes from coronae of remote galaxies , we solve the transport equations with the source term proportional to the total stellar mass density @xmath64 at the redshift @xmath65 , @xmath66 and include extra term for @xmath61 interactions with extragalactic background light ( ebl ) into the transport equation . for the ebl",

    ", the secondary neutrino spectrum roughly follows the cosmic - ray proton spectrum for which we assumed the power - law dependence .",
    "therefore , we omit the energy dependence in the following equations .",
