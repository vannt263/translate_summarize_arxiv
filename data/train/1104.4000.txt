    "although the existence of dark matter ( dm ) in the universe has been established , what it is made of remains a fundamental puzzle @xcite . within the standard model ( sm )",
    "three kinds of active neutrinos and their antiparticles , whose masses lie in the sub - ev range , may constitute hot dm . beyond the sm one or more species of sterile neutrinos and antineutrinos at a similar mass scale may also form hot dm , if they were thermalized in the early universe as their active counterparts .",
    "such light sterile particles are hypothetical , but their existence is more or less implied by current experimental and cosmological data . on the one hand , the long - standing lsnd antineutrino anomaly @xcite , the more recent miniboone antineutrino anomaly @xcite and the latest reactor antineutrino anomaly @xcite can all be interpreted as the active - sterile antineutrino oscillations in the assumption of two kinds of sterile antineutrinos whose masses are close to 1 ev @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , an analysis of the existing data on the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , galaxy clustering and supernovae ia favors some extra radiation content in the universe and one or two species of sterile neutrinos and antineutrinos at the sub - ev mass scale @xcite .",
    "we are therefore open - minded to conjecture that hot dm may in general consist of both active and sterile components .",
    "these relics of the big bang form the unseen cosmic neutrino background ( c@xmath6b ) and cosmic antineutrino background ( c@xmath7b ) , whose temperature @xmath8 is slightly lower than the cmb temperature @xmath9 ( i.e. , @xmath10{4/11 } \\",

    "but hot dm only has a tiny contribution to the total matter density of the universe .",
    "a careful analysis of the structure formation indicates that most dm should be cold ( nonrelativistic ) or warm ( semirelativistic ) at the onset of the galaxy formation , when the temperature of the universe was about 1 kev @xcite .",
    "a number of candidates for cold dm , such as weakly interacting massive particles and axions @xcite , have so far been investigated . in comparison ,",
    "warm dm is another interesting possibility of accounting for the observed non - luminous and non - baryonic matter content in the universe .",
    "its existence may allow us to solve or soften several problems that we have recently encountered in the dm simulations @xcite ( e.g. , to damp the inhomogeneities on small scales by reducing the number of dwarf galaxies or to smooth the cusps in the dm halos ) .",
    "a good candidate for warm dm should be sterile neutrinos and antineutrinos , if their masses are in the kev range and their lifetimes are much longer than the age of the universe @xcite .",
    "they could be produced in the early universe in several ways @xcite , and should be able to suppress the formation of dwarf galaxies and other small - scale structures and have impacts on the x - ray spectrum , the velocity distribution of pulsars and the formation of the first stars @xcite . hence it is likely to constrain their masses and mixing angles by measuring the lyman-@xmath11 forest and x - ray fluxes @xcite . in this connection some preliminary hints of kev sterile neutrinos and antineutrinos have recently been discussed @xcite .",
    "on the theoretical side , there are some interesting models which can accommodate sterile neutrinos and antineutrinos at either kev @xcite or sub - ev @xcite mass scales .",
    "a model - independent argument @xcite is also supporting the conjecture of warm dm hiding out in the  flavor desert \" of the sm fermion mass spectrum @xcite . here",
    "our main concern is purely phenomenological : how can one directly probe the sterile component of the c@xmath7b and the kev sterile _ antineutrino _ dm ? in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been shown that the sterile component of the c@xmath6b can in principle be detected by means of the thresholdless reaction @xmath12 , because the mass eigenstates of sub - ev sterile neutrinos contribute to @xmath13 and thus leaves a distinct imprint on the electron energy spectrum when they are captured on @xmath14 nuclei.b .",

    "a possible way out is to make use of some radioactive nuclei which can decay via electron capture ( ec ) @xcite .",
    "it has recently been pointed out that the isotope @xmath0 , which undergoes an ec decay into @xmath1 with a small energy release ( @xmath18 kev ) , may serve as a target to directly detect the active component of the c@xmath7b @xcite .",
    "this method also works in the presence of flavor effects , which are found to be appreciable and even important in some cases @xcite .",
    "here we shall adopt the same idea to probe the _ sterile _ component of the c@xmath7b and the kev sterile _ antineutrino _ dm . the ec decay of @xmath0 @xcite can be written as @xmath19 and a thresholdless capture of the incoming @xmath17 on the ec - decaying @xmath0 may happen via @xmath20 where @xmath21 is an orbital electron from the @xmath22-th shell of @xmath0 , and @xmath23 is the corresponding binding energy of the electron hole in @xmath1 .",

    "first , it is a useful and nontrivial extension of the discussions about the active component of the c@xmath7b in refs . @xcite and @xcite and may provide us with a novel approach towards the direct detection of relic sterile antineutrinos , which should be compared with relic sterile neutrinos .",
    "second , it illustrates a common way to probe hot and warm sterile antineutrino dm .",
    "although this way is extremely challenging and its prospect is rather remote , it is hitherto the most promising way in this connection .",
    "third , it may serve to highlight the importance of doing a high - statistics _",
    "calorimetric _ experiment to measure the @xmath0 spectrum , probe the absolute neutrino mass scale @xcite and even detect the c@xmath7b and warm sterile antineutrino dm .",
    "the remaining parts of this paper are organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we summarize the main formulas which can be used to calculate the energy spectrum of the ec decay in eq .",
    "( 1 ) and the rate of the relic antineutrino capture in eq . ( 2 ) .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the capture of hot sterile antineutrino dm in the ( 3 + 2 ) scheme of active - sterile antineutrino mixing .",
    "we show that the signature is located on the right - hand side of the spectral endpoint of the ec decay , and their interval is detectable if the target is big enough , the energy resolution is good enough and the gravitational clustering of sub - ev sterile antineutrinos is significant around the earth .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the capture of warm sterile antineutrino dm on @xmath0 nuclei .",
    "we calculate the capture rate by assuming the existence of one species of sterile antineutrinos at the kev mass scale .",
    "we find that it is in principle possible to identify a signal of this kind of warm dm , but the required target mass is too big to be accomplishable in the foreseeable future .",
    "we conclude in section 5 .",
    "the key point of relic antineutrino captures on the ec - dcaying @xmath0 nuclei is to capture the relic _ electron _ antineutrinos no matter how low their kinetic energies are . in the presence of @xmath24 species of light sterile neutrinos and antineutrinos , the flavor eigenstates @xmath25 and",
    "@xmath26 can be written as @xmath27 where @xmath28 ( or @xmath29 ) stands for the mass eigenstate of an active ( for @xmath30 ) or sterile ( for @xmath31 ) neutrino ( or antineutrino ) , and @xmath32 denotes an element in the first row of the @xmath33 neutrino mixing matrix @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "given current experimental constraints on sterile antineutrinos @xcite , it is reasonable to assume that the light sterile antineutrinos under consideration do not significantly affect the values of two mass - squared differences and three mixing angles of three active antineutrinos extracted from solar , atmospheric , reactor and accelerator neutrino oscillation data @xcite . in this assumption",
    "we shall use @xmath35 and @xmath36 together with @xmath37 and @xmath38 as typical inputs for our analysis . depending on the sign of @xmath39",
    ", there are two possible mass patterns for active antineutrinos : @xmath40 ( normal hierarchy ) or @xmath41 ( inverted hierarchy ) . in either case",
    "the absolute mass scale is unknown , but its upper bound is expected to be of @xmath42 ev as constrained by current cosmological data @xcite .",
    "we shall specify the values of @xmath43 and @xmath44 ( for @xmath45 ) when we numerically calculate the capture rates of relic sterile antineutrinos in sections 3 and 4 .",
    "now let us consider the ec decay of @xmath0 in eq .",
    "if the @xmath46-value of this reaction is defined as the mass difference between @xmath0 and @xmath1 , then the energy spectrum of the outgoing neutrinos will be given by a series of lines at @xmath47 .",

    "one may use eqs .",
    "( 5 ) and ( 6 ) to calculate the rate of the relic antineutrino capture on the ec - decaying @xmath0 nuclei against the corresponding background ( i.e. , the ec decay itself ) in the presence of active and sterile flavor effects , which are characterized by both the antineutrino masses @xmath43 and the antineutrino mixing matrix elements @xmath44 ( for @xmath75 ) .",
    "it is therefore possible to probe the existence of relic sterile antineutrinos at either sub - ev or kev mass scales .    in our numerical calculations",
    "we shall input the values of those parameters relevant to the atomic levels of @xmath1 given in ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein .",
    "the energy levels of the captured electrons are assumed to be fully occupied ( i.e. , @xmath76 ) and their binding energies and widths can be found in table 1 of ref .",
    "the atomic corrections for the electron exchange and overlap are neglected ( i.e. , @xmath77 ) , and the ratios of the squared wave functions at the origin ( i.e. , @xmath78 ) can be found in table 2 of ref . @xcite .",
    "because the nuclear shape factors @xmath62 are approximately identical in an allowed transition @xcite , they can be factored out from the sum in eqs .",
    "( 5 ) and ( 6 ) .",
    "note that the numerical results of @xmath79 and @xmath80 can be properly normalized by using the half - life of @xmath0 via the relation @xmath81 , where @xmath82 yr",
    ". then the distributions of the number of signal events and the number of background events are expressed , respectively , as @xmath83 for a given target factor @xmath84 ( i.e. , the number of @xmath0 atoms of the target ) and for a given exposure time @xmath85 in the experiment .",
    "to be explicit , let us focus on the capture of hot sterile antineutrino dm in the ( 3 + 2 ) flavor mixing scheme with two species of sub - ev sterile neutrinos and antineutrinos @xcite .",
    "the absolute mass scale of three active antineutrinos is characterized by @xmath86 ( normal hierarchy ) or @xmath87 ( inverted hierarchy ) , and its value is typically taken to be 0.0 ev , 0.05 ev or 0.1 ev in our numerical analysis .",
    "in addition , we choose @xmath88 ev and @xmath89 ev together with @xmath90 for two sterile antineutrinos . and @xmath91 are mainly for the purpose of illustration , they do not qualitatively affect our conclusions . ] accordingly , we have @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "such sterile antineutrinos are expected to be cosmologically friendly @xcite , and they should stay in full thermal equilibrium in the early universe @xcite . in this case",
    "the standard big bang model predicts the average number density @xmath97 today for each species of active and sterile neutrinos and antineutrinos .",
    "for our purpose , however , we are mainly concerned about the number density of relic antineutrinos around the earth because its value @xmath60 may be more or less enhanced by the gravitational clustering effect . a detailed analysis of gravitational clustering of relic neutrinos and antineutrinos in our local neighborhood has been done in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we take account of this effect by conjecturing a simplified power law relation between the relic antineutrino overdensity parameter @xmath98 and the corresponding antineutrino mass @xmath43 ( for @xmath99 ) : @xmath100 where @xmath101 and @xmath102 are independent of the subscript @xmath103 .",
    "note that the size of @xmath104 for a given value of @xmath43 should lie between the results obtained in two extreme cases as summarized in table 2 of ref .",
    "for simplicity , here we take the average of every pair of those extreme values as the central input of @xmath104 and one half of their difference as the error bar of @xmath104 .",
    "then we have @xmath105 corresponding to @xmath106 ev extracted from table 2 in ref . @xcite . after a least square analysis of the relation between @xmath43 and @xmath104 as illustrated in fig . 1 , we find that the best - fit values of @xmath101 and @xmath102 are @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "one may easily see that the deviation of @xmath104 from one becomes significant only when @xmath43 is larger than 0.1 ev ( e.g. , @xmath109 for @xmath110 ev ) .",
    "so in the ( 3 + 2 ) flavor mixing scheme under discussion , only two sub - ev sterile antineutrinos are relatively sensitive to the gravitational clustering effect .",
    "we calculate the rate of the relic antineutrino capture on @xmath0 nuclei against the rate of the corresponding ec decay by means of eqs .",
    "( 5 ) , ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) .",
    "our numerical results are presented in figs . 2 and 3 .",
    "some discussions are in order .",
    "\\(1 ) fig .",
    "2 illustrates the relic antineutrino capture rate as a function of the overall energy release @xmath111 in the case of @xmath112 . in the left panel @xmath113 ( i.e. , @xmath114 )",
    "is assumed , and in the right panel the gravitational clustering effect ( i.e. , @xmath115 ) has roughly been taken into account with the help of eq .",
    "the impact of different values of @xmath86 on the capture rate can be vertically seen in each panel .",
    "note that the value of the finite energy resolution @xmath55 is taken in such a way that only the signal of hot _ sterile _ antineutrino dm can be observed , since the signal of hot _ active _ antineutrino dm has already been discussed in ref .",
    "we find that it is in principle possible to distinguish the signal from the background when @xmath55 is smaller than @xmath116 ev . as the value of @xmath86 increases from 0 to 0.1 ev",
    ", the signal curve moves towards the higher @xmath117 region while the background curve moves towards the lower @xmath118 region .",
    "hence the interval between the peak of a signal and the background becomes larger for a larger value of @xmath86 , making it easier to detect this signal .",
    "if the heights of two neighboring signals are quite different and their locations satisfy @xmath119 , it will be difficult to distinguish between them because the higher signal is much broader and may essentially overwhelm the lower one .",
    "this feature can be seen in fig .",
    "2(e ) and fig .",
    "2(f ) , where the signal of @xmath120 and the signal of three active antineutrinos with nearly degenerate masses merge into a single one . in this case",
    "only the signal of much heavier @xmath121 is clearly distinguishable . in the right panel of fig . 2",
    "one may observe that the gravitational clustering effect can enhance the capture rate , and this effect is more significant for heavier sterile antineutrinos .",
    "if the gravitational clustering of relic antineutrinos were much more significant around the earth , it would be very helpful for us to detect the c@xmath7b by means of the capture reaction under consideration .",
    "\\(2 ) fig .",
    "3 shows the numerical results obtained from an analogous analysis of the relic antineutrino capture rate in the case of @xmath122 .",
    "we see that it is quite similar to fig . 2 , and their main differences appear in the location of the signal of three active antineutrinos and that of the endpoint of the ec - decay background .",
    "the first difference arises from the fact that the location of the signal of active antineutrinos is dominated by the mass eigenstates @xmath123 and @xmath124 which have slightly larger eigenvalues in the @xmath122 case than in the @xmath125 case . as for the second difference ,",
    "the spectral endpoint of the ec decay of @xmath126 is located at a smaller @xmath117 region in the @xmath122 case , simply because the lightest mass eigenstate @xmath127 hiding out in @xmath128 is associated with the smallest active antineutrino mixing matrix element @xmath129 .",
    "so we conclude that it is somewhat easier to observe the signals of hot active and sterile antineutrino dm when three active antineutrinos have an inverted mass hierarchy .",
    "\\(3 ) besides the energy resolution , another factor that obviously affects the observability of hot antineutrino dm is the absolute capture rate which depends on the number density of relic antineutrinos @xmath60 , the flavor mixing matrix elements @xmath44 and the number of the target particles @xmath84 . by using the default values of @xmath44 taken above",
    ", we illustrate the iso - rate curves for the sterile antineutrino overdensity parameter @xmath130 versus the target mass in fig .",
    "4 . as a free parameter independent of the neutrino masses @xmath43 . in the literature",
    "there are some different neutrino overdensity models which can actually predict very large values of @xmath104 ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . ]",
    "because of @xmath131 and @xmath132 , one may obtain very similar iso - rate curves for @xmath133 versus the target mass .",
    "these curves are simply straight lines in the double logarithmic scale , which can easily be understood with the help of eqs .",
    "( 5 ) and ( 7 ) . given @xmath134 , for example",
    ", a target with @xmath135 kg ( or @xmath136 kg ) @xmath126 could be enough to give a capture rate of one event per year ( or ten events per year ) .    finally , let us give a brief comment on the properties of the capture signals of hot sterile antineutrinos against the corresponding ec decays by taking the masses of sterile antineutrinos to be consistent with the values of @xmath137 and @xmath138 extracted from a global fit of the lsnd , miniboone and reactor antineutrino anomalies ( i.e. , @xmath139 and @xmath140 @xcite ) . in this case",
    "the dependence of the capture rates on the energy resolution , antineutrino number densities and target factors is quite similar to the one discussed above .",
    "the only change is the location of each sterile antineutrino signal . because of @xmath141 ev and @xmath142 ev in the present situation",
    ", it will be much easier to identify the sterile antineutrino signals on ec - decaying @xmath0 nuclei if the magnitudes of the mixing matrix elements @xmath143 and @xmath144 keep unchanged .",
    "now we turn to the capture of warm sterile antineutrino dm in the ( 3 + 1 ) flavor mixing scheme with one species of kev sterile neutrinos and antineutrinos . to be explicit ,",
    "we fix @xmath145 kev and @xmath146 in our numerical analysis , just for the purpose of illustration @xcite .",
    "because our main concern is to observe a possible signal of the relic antineutrino capture in the kev mass region , we simply assume three active antineutrinos to have a normal mass hierarchy with @xmath147 .",
    "a very similar signal can also be obtained for the inverted or nearly degenerate mass pattern of three active antineutrinos .",
    "one may also consider the gravitational clustering effect on the c@xmath7b as described in eq .",
    "( 8) , but it is insignificant in the present scenario where only active antineutrinos contribute to the c@xmath7b . as for the kev sterile neutrinos and antineutrinos",
    ", we follow ref .",
    "@xcite to assume that they were produced in the early universe through active - sterile neutrino or antineutrino oscillations and their number densities are able to account for the total amount of dm .",
    "given the average density of dm in our galactic neighborhood ( i.e. , @xmath148 @xcite ) , it is straightforward to estimate the number density of @xmath149 or @xmath150 .",
    "we obtain @xmath151 .",
    "we calculate the capture rate of warm sterile antineutrino dm on @xmath0 nuclei against the corresponding ec - decay background by using eqs .",
    "( 5 ) , ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) .",
    "our numerical result is shown in fig .",
    "5 . some discussions are in order .",
    "\\(1 ) in obtaining fig .",
    "5 we have chosen a typical value of the finite energy resolution @xmath55 to distinguish the signal from the background . the endpoint of the background is sensitive to @xmath55 , while the peak of the signal is always located at @xmath152 .",
    "so a comparison between @xmath55 and @xmath153 can easily reveal the signal - to - background ratio .",
    "the required energy resolution to identify the signal of warm sterile antineutrino dm is of @xmath154 , which should be easily reachable in a realistic experiment .",
    "\\(2 ) the main problem which makes the observability of kev sterile antineutrino dm rather dim and remote is the tiny capture rate .",
    "the latter is strongly suppressed for two simple reasons . on the one hand , the mixing factor between three active antineutrinos and the kev sterile antineutrino is too small @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the breit - wigner distribution function is too small when the signal of @xmath150 is located far away from the resonance energies @xmath155 . in fig .",
    "6 we depict the iso - rate curves for the mixing matrix element @xmath156 versus the target mass .",
    "one can see that a target with 600 ton @xmath0 is needed for @xmath157 , so as to obtain a capture rate of one event per year . hence it is almost hopeless to capture warm sterile antineutrino dm on the ec - decaying @xmath0 nuclei in the foreseeable future . in comparison",
    ", it seems somewhat more hopeful to detect warm dm in the form of kev sterile _ neutrinos _ on radioactive beta - decaying @xmath14 and @xmath16 nuclei in the long term @xcite .",
    "finally , let us give some brief comments on the detection prospects for three kinds of relic antineutrinos ( i.e. , hot active antineutrino dm , hot sterile antineutrino dm and warm sterile antineutrino dm ) . given a target made of the isotope @xmath126 , the capture of each kind of dm in a realistic experiment crucially relies on its energy resolution and target mass . because three active antineutrinos have relatively large mixing angles and relatively small masses , the corresponding hot active antineutrino dm has the largest capture rate but requires the most stringent energy resolution ( @xmath158 ev or smaller , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite ) for us to distinguish a signal from its background .",
    "in contrast , the situation for capturing warm sterile antineutrino dm is just the opposite . here",
    "@xmath159 kev is good enough because of @xmath160 kev , and this energy resolution requirement can be satisfied even today .",
    "but the capture rate of @xmath150 on the ec - decaying @xmath0 nuclei is so small that the desired target mass has to be formidably large .",
    "as we have seen in the above analysis , the capture of hot sterile antineutrino dm at the sub - ev ( or ev ) mass scale requires a relatively mild energy resolution and a reasonably large target mass as compared with the situations for detecting hot active antineutrino dm and warm sterile antineutrino dm in the same way .",
    "so it might be possible to probe the sterile component of the c@xmath7b by using the isotope @xmath126 as a target in the future .",
    "to pin down what dm is made of has been one of the most important and most challenging problems in particle physics and cosmology . in this paper",
    "we have addressed ourselves to the direct laboratory detection of possible contributions of light sterile antineutrinos to dm .",
    "such hypothetical particles might be a part of hot dm if their masses are in the sub - ev ( or ev ) range , or a good candidate for warm dm if their masses lie in the kev range .",
    "choosing the isotope @xmath0 as a target and assuming reasonable active - sterile antineutrino mixing angles , we have calculated the capture rate of relic electron antineutrinos against the corresponding ec - decay background in the presence of sterile antineutrinos at either sub - ev or kev mass scales .",
    "our analysis shows that the signature of hot or warm sterile antineutrino dm should in principle be observable , provided the target is big enough , the energy resolution is good enough and the gravitational clustering effect is significant enough .",
    "we admit that our numerical results are quite preliminary and mainly serve for illustration , but we stress that such a direct laboratory search for hot and warm sterile antineutrino dm is fundamentally important and deserves further attention and more detailed investigations .    why has one chosen the ec - decaying @xmath0 nuclei as a proper target for probing the antineutrino content of dm ?",
    "the reason is simply that the captures of relic neutrinos and antineutrinos require different types of radioactive nuclei : @xmath13 is involved in the capture reactions on the beta - decaying @xmath14 and @xmath16 nuclei , while @xmath17 is associated with the capture reactions on the ec - decaying @xmath126 nuclei .",
    "so it makes sense to look for another rather stable isotope which can undergo an ec decay with a much lower @xmath46-value , in order to do a more promising experiment for the direct detection of hot and warm antineutrino dm .",
    "although the present experimental techniques are unable to lead us to a guaranteed measurement of relic neutrinos and antineutrinos in the near future , we might have a chance to make a success of this great exploration in the long term .",

    "<S> capturing low - energy electron antineutrinos on radioactive @xmath0 nuclei , which decay into @xmath1 via electron capture ( ec ) , is a noteworthy opportunity to detect relic sterile antineutrinos . </S>",
    "<S> such hypothetical particles are more or less implied by current experimental and cosmological data , and they might be a part of hot dark matter or a candidate for warm dark matter in the universe . using the isotope @xmath0 as a target and assuming reasonable active - sterile antineutrino mixing angles , we calculate the capture rate of relic electron antineutrinos against the corresponding ec - decay background in the presence of sterile antineutrinos at the sub - ev or kev mass scale . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the signature of hot or warm sterile antineutrino dark matter should in principle be observable , provided the target is big enough and the energy resolution is good enough . </S>",
