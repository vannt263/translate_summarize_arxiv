    "overwhelming evidence now suggests  @xcite that non - baryonic dark matter contributes a substantial fraction @xmath0  @xcite of the energy density in the universe .",
    "experimental and observational data significantly constrain the fundamental properties of the particle(s ) which contribute toward this dark - matter abundance .",
    "nevertheless , a broad range of viable theoretical possibilities exist for what the dark matter in our universe might be .",
    "one possibility is that the dark sector is `` minimal '' in the sense that a single , stable particle species contributes essentially the entirety of @xmath1 .",
    "however , there also exist additional well - motivated possibilities in which the dark sector manifests a richer and more complicated _ non - minimal _ structure .",
    "for example , several particle species could contribute non - trivially toward @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "indeed , @xmath1 could even represent the collective contribution from a vast ensemble of potentially unstable individual particle species whose lifetimes are balanced against their cosmological abundances  a possibility known as dynamical dark matter ( ddm )  @xcite .",
    "other extensions of the minimal case exist as well .",
    "thus , once an unambiguous signal of dark matter is identified , differentiating between all of these possibilities will become the next crucial task for dark - matter phenomenology .",
    "this task presents a unique set of challenges . practically by definition ,",
    "the dark sector comprises neutral particle species with similar or identical quantum numbers under the standard - model ( sm ) gauge group .",
    "indeed , many theoretical realizations of the dark sector differ from one another only in the multiplicity and/or masses of such particle species and the strengths of their couplings to other fields in the theory . for this reason , evidence for a particular structure within the dark sector",
    "is not usually expected to manifest itself via the simultaneous observation of signal excesses in multiple detection channels .",
    "rather , such evidence will often appear only in the shapes of the distributions of particular kinematic quantities in one particular channel .",
    "such distributions include , for example , the recoil - energy spectra obtained from direct - detection experiments , the energy spectra of photons or other cosmic - ray particles at indirect - detection experiments , and the distributions of a number of kinematic variables ( particle momenta , invariant and transverse masses , ) at colliders .",
    "of course , some information about the properties of the dark particles can be ascertained merely by identifying the kinematic endpoints of these distributions .",
    "however , such information is typically insufficient to distinguish single - particle from multi - particle dark sectors .",
    "indeed , for such purposes , an analysis of the full _ shape _ of the distribution is required .    in many experimental contexts",
    ", the extraction of information from kinematic distributions is complicated by the presence of sizable backgrounds  backgrounds which can only be reduced through the imposition of stringent event - selection criteria . while such cuts are often critical for signal extraction , they can have unintended consequences for distribution - based searches .",
    "specifically , the cuts imposed on one variable can potentially distort the shapes of the kinematic distributions of other variables whenever those variables are non - trivially correlated .",
    "such effects are not particularly important in `` bump - hunting '' searches , in which the goal is merely to identify an excess in the total number of observed events over the expected background .",
    "by contrast , in distribution - based searches , these effects can obscure critical information and lead to misleading results  or , in certain cases , can actually amplify distinctive features which point toward different kinds of dark - sector non - minimality .",
    "these issues are especially relevant for collider searches , wherein a variety of different strategies often exist for extracting signal from background in any particular channel .",
    "indeed , different strategies may offer very different prospects for distinguishing among different dark - matter scenarios .",
    "effective strategies for distinguishing non - minimality in the dark sector been developed for certain detection channels .",
    "for example , it has been shown that ddm ensembles can give rise to statistically significant deviations from the kinematic distributions associated with traditional , single - particle dark - matter candidates at colliders  @xcite , at direct - detection experiments  @xcite , and at cosmic - ray detectors  @xcite .",
    "similar analyses have also been performed for other non - minimal dark - matter scenarios in the context of direct detection  @xcite , indirect detection  @xcite , and collider searches  @xcite . however , in general , it is also important to investigate the effects of correlations between kinematic variables and their impact on distribution shapes .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the prospects for distinguishing between minimal and non - minimal dark sectors on the basis of kinematic distributions at the the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) . for concreteness , we focus on the dijet  +  @xmath2 channel , primarily due to its kinematic simplicity and its relevance for a wide variety of new - physics scenarios , including supersymmetry , theories with universal extra dimensions , and theories including scalar leptoquarks .",
    "nevertheless , we emphasize that many of our findings transcend this particular analysis and apply more broadly to any distribution - based search for dark - sector non - minimality .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "[ sec : preliminaries ] , we introduce the class of minimal and non - minimal dark - matter models which will serve as benchmarks in our study . in sect .",
    "[ sec : varsddmvstdm ] , we then review the properties of various kinematic variables which can be constructed for the dijet  +  @xmath2 channel .",
    "we examine the kinematic distributions of these variables for both our minimal and non - minimal benchmark models and determine the degree to which each variable is sensitive to the structure of the dark sector . in sect .",
    "[ sec : correlbetweenvars ] , we proceed to examine the correlations between these different variables and provide a qualitative assessment of how cuts on certain variables affect the distributions of other variables . in sect .",
    "[ sec : results ] , we combine our results in order to assess the extent to which signal - event distributions can be used to differentiate ddm ensembles from traditional dark - matter candidates . finally , in sect .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] , we conclude with a discussion of how to extend our analysis of cuts and correlations among collider variables to other channels relevant for the detection and differentiation of dark - matter candidates .    before proceeding , one final comment is in order .",
    "our primary aim in this paper is to examine the information that different kinematic variables can provide about the structure of the dark sector and to assess the impact of correlations between these variables . in particular , it is not our aim to present an exhaustive quantitative analysis of the discovery prospects for dark - sector non - minimality in the dijet  +  @xmath2 channel .",
    "for this reason , we choose to focus on the signal contributions to the event rate and treat the sm backgrounds merely as a motivation for the cuts we impose on the signal distributions .",
    "however , we note that substantial residual backgrounds from processes such as @xmath3  +  jets , @xmath4  +  jets , and @xmath5  +  jets remain for this channel even after stringent cuts are applied .",
    "these residual backgrounds make extracting information about the dark sector particularly challenging . in sect .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] , we shall return to this issue and discuss potential techniques for further reducing these backgrounds in future collider searches for non - minimal dark sectors .",
    "these issues notwithstanding , we emphasize that the correlations we discuss here are every bit as relevant for a full study including both signal and background contributions as they are for this background - free analysis . moreover , many of the general considerations we discuss here transcend this particular channel and apply more broadly to any search which involves the analysis of kinematic distributions rather than merely the identification of an excess in the number of observed events .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , our goal is to examine the strategies and prospects for distinguishing non - minimal dark sectors on the basis of results in the dijet  +  @xmath2 channel at the lhc .",
    "however , dark sectors can exhibit various degrees of non - minimality ranging from just a few dark particles all the way to large ddm - like ensembles . in order to obtain a sense of the full scope of possibilities , in this paper we shall therefore consider two extremes which sit at opposite poles of complexity .",
    "the simplest situation one can consider is the case of a single dark - matter particle @xmath6 of mass @xmath7 . for concreteness , we take @xmath6 to be a dirac fermion which transforms as a singlet under the sm gauge group . we also assume that the theory contains an additional scalar field @xmath8 with mass @xmath9 which transforms in the fundamental representation of @xmath10 and which can therefore be produced copiously via strong interactions at the lhc .",
    "in addition , we also assume that @xmath8 couples to @xmath6 and right - handed sm quarks @xmath11 via an interaction lagrangian of the form @xmath12~ ,    \\label{eq : linttrad}\\ ] ] where the @xmath13 are dimensionless coupling coefficients . for simplicity , we take the @xmath13 to be real and focus on the case in which @xmath8 couples to a single light quark species , which we here take to be the up quark  , we take @xmath14 to be non - vanishing , while @xmath15 for @xmath16 .",
    "such coupling structures arise naturally for a variety of exotic particles in well - motivated extensions of the sm , including up squarks in flavor - aligned supersymmetry .",
    "note that in general the @xmath13 may be non - vanishing for either up - type or down - type quarks , depending on the @xmath17 charge of @xmath8 , but not for both simultaneously .",
    "furthermore , we assume that there are no other interactions within this simplified model which contribute to @xmath8 decay , so that the decay process @xmath18 dominates the width @xmath19 of @xmath8 .",
    "this situation arises naturally in any scenario in which there exists a symmetry under which @xmath8 and @xmath6 transform non - trivially but all sm particles transform trivially , thereby rendering @xmath6 stable .",
    "finally , we assume that the characteristic timescale @xmath20 associated with this decay process is sufficiently short ( @xmath21  s ) that @xmath8 decays promptly within a collider detector once it is produced .    at the opposite extreme of non - minimality",
    ", we shall consider a benchmark scenario in which the dark sector consists of an entire ensemble of individual components  , an entire so - called `` ddm ensemble ''  @xcite . indeed , in this paper such ddm ensembles will be taken as our canonical representatives of highly non - minimal dark sectors .",
    "the class of ddm models on which we choose to focus is that in which the constituent particles @xmath22 of this ensemble , @xmath23 , are sm - gauge - singlet dirac fermions with a mass spectrum of the form @xmath24 where the mass @xmath25 of the lightest constituent in the ensemble , the mass - splitting parameter @xmath26 , and the power - law index @xmath27 are free parameters of the theory .",
    "note that in this parametrization , @xmath28 and @xmath29 by construction , so that the index @xmath30 labels the @xmath22 in order of increasing mass .",
    "indeed , it turns out that many naturally - occurring ddm ensembles have mass spectra of this form .",
    "just as for the single - component case discussed above , we also assume that the theory includes an additional , heavy scalar field @xmath8 with mass @xmath31 which transforms in the fundamental representation of the sm @xmath10 gauge group .",
    "likewise , the @xmath22 are assumed to couple to this heavy scalar and to right - handed quarks @xmath11 via the interaction lagrangian @xmath32~.    \\label{eq : lint}\\ ] ] indeed , this is the analogue of the interaction lagrangian in eq .",
    "( [ eq : linttrad ] ) for the single - particle case , and the @xmath33 are a set of dimensionless coupling coefficients analogous to @xmath34 .",
    "once again , to facilitate direct comparison with the single - particle case , we focus on the case in which the @xmath33 are real and in which only @xmath35 is non - vanishing for each @xmath30 , while @xmath36 for all other quark species .",
    "we also likewise assume that decay processes of the form @xmath37 dominate @xmath19 to such an extent that all other contributions to that width can safely be neglected , and that all such decay processes occur promptly within the detector .",
    "finally , we assume that the @xmath38 scale across the ensemble according to a power - law relation of the form @xmath39 where the exponent @xmath40 is another free parameter of the theory .    in general",
    ", the number of dark - matter components in the ensemble can be quite large , and it is possible for the masses of the heaviest components in the ensemble to greatly exceed @xmath31 .",
    "however , only those states @xmath22 with @xmath41 can be produced through the decays of @xmath8 , and thus only those states will be relevant for the study in this paper . as a result , for the purposes of this study , we shall effectively consider @xmath42 to be the number of states in the ensemble with masses less than @xmath31 , with the understanding that @xmath43 but @xmath44",
    ".    we emphasize that we have chosen to focus on a scenario in which @xmath8 is a lorentz scalar and transforms in the fundamental representation of @xmath10 merely for concreteness .",
    "similar results will emerge in any alternative scenario in which @xmath8 transforms under the lorentz and @xmath10 groups in such a way that two - body decays to a sm quark or gluon and one of the @xmath22 are permitted and dominate @xmath19 . for example , the results obtained for an @xmath10-octet fermion whose width is dominated by decays of the form @xmath45 , where @xmath46 denotes a sm gluon , are quite similar to those we obtain in this paper .",
    "moreover , the enhanced pair - production cross - section in this case would improve the prospects for distinguishing dark - sector non - minimality .",
    "similar results would likewise emerge for different assignments of the coupling coefficients @xmath33 .",
    "in this section , we survey some of the kinematic variables in common use for the event topology discussed in sect .  [",
    "sec : preliminaries ] , with an eye towards assessing their possible utility in probing non - minimal dark sectors . as discussed in the introduction ,",
    "bump - hunting is not enough  we need to analyze the shapes of the _ distributions _ associated with these variables . in this connection ,",
    "several questions emerge .",
    "for instance , is it possible to distinguish non - minimal or multi - component dark sectors from traditional single - component dark sectors on the basis of such distributions ?",
    "if so , which kinematic variables provide the best prospects for doing this ? in short , we seek to understand the extent to which differences in the particle content of the dark sector can affect the shapes of the kinematic distributions of whatever useful variables can be constructed .    in this section ,",
    "we take the first step toward answering these questions by examining the qualitative features associated with the kinematic distributions of different variables and assessing to what extent these features are affected by dark - sector non - minimality .",
    "we begin by enumerating the kinematic variables we consider in this study and discussing their general properties .",
    "we then discuss the underlying methodology and assumptions inherent in our calculation of the corresponding kinematic distributions using monte - carlo techniques . finally , we present the results of this calculation and provide a preliminary assessment as to which variables have distributions which are sensitive to non - minimality , and which do not .      as discussed in the introduction ,",
    "one of the challenges of extracting information about the dark sector from the dijet  +  @xmath2 channel is the paucity of information contained in the description of any given event . indeed ,",
    "other than variables that characterize the angular size and substructure of the two jets ( considerations which are not particularly relevant for this analysis ) , such events are completely characterized by only six independent degrees of freedom : the six components of the momenta @xmath47 and @xmath48 of the jets @xmath49 and @xmath50 , respectively .",
    "nevertheless , a number of kinematic variables can be constructed from these six degrees of freedom which can be used to extract information from this channel .",
    "these include    * the magnitude @xmath2 of the missing transverse momentum in the event . * the magnitudes @xmath51 and @xmath52 of the transverse momenta of the leading jet @xmath49 and next - to - leading jet @xmath50 in the event , respectively , where the jets are ranked by @xmath53 . * the scalar sum @xmath54 of the transverse momenta @xmath51 and @xmath52 . * the scalar sum @xmath55 of @xmath2 and the transverse momenta @xmath51 and @xmath52 . * the absolute value @xmath56 of the angle between @xmath49 and @xmath50 . * the variable @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the invariant mass of @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "this variable was introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite and is correlated with the degree to which these two leading jets are back - to - back . *",
    "the transverse mass @xmath59 constructed from @xmath60 and the total missing - transverse - momentum vector @xmath61 . * the standard @xmath62 variable  @xcite .",
    "the last variable , @xmath62 , will play a significant role in this paper .",
    "we therefore pause to discuss its definition and properties in some detail .",
    "this quantity is essentially a generalization of the transverse - mass variable for use in situations in which more than one invisible particle is present in the final state for a given collider process . for the process @xmath63 , which is the primary focus of this study , this variable is defined as @xmath64~ ,     \\label{eq : mt2def}\\ ] ] where @xmath65 is a common `` trial mass '' which is assumed for _ both _ @xmath66 and @xmath67 ; where @xmath60 and @xmath68 are the transverse momenta of the two leading lets ( ranked by @xmath53 ) ; where @xmath69 is the total missing - transverse - momentum vector for the event ; where @xmath70 and @xmath71 represent possible partitions of this total missing - transverse - momentum vector between the two invisible particles @xmath66 and @xmath67 ; and where @xmath72 are the squared transverse masses of @xmath49 with @xmath66 and of @xmath50 with @xmath67 for any particular such partition , respectively . in this expression ,",
    "@xmath73 and @xmath74 denotes the masses of the two jets ( which are negligible in practice ) .",
    "note that by construction , the transverse energies @xmath75 and @xmath76 appearing in eq .",
    "( [ eq : transversemasses ] ) are both defined in terms of the trial mass @xmath65 .",
    "the @xmath62 variable in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mt2def ] ) is defined to be the minimum of the greater of these two transverse masses over all possible partitions of @xmath69 between @xmath70 and @xmath71 .    in cases in which each of the two decay chains in the event includes only one visible - sector particle in the final state ,",
    "it can be shown  @xcite that the partition of @xmath69 for which this minimum occurs is always the so - called `` balanced '' solution  , the solution for which @xmath77 . for this balanced solution , one finds that @xmath78 where @xmath79    one particularly useful feature of the @xmath62 variable is that it is bounded from above .",
    "indeed , the maximum possible value @xmath62 can attain within any sample of events is the one in which all of the particles involved are maximally transverse , and the transverse mass reconstructed for each of the two decay chains in the event coincides with its corresponding invariant mass .",
    "it therefore follows that in traditional dark - matter models , for which @xmath80 by assumption , the maximum possible value @xmath81 for @xmath62 is equal to the mass @xmath31 of the parent particle .",
    "however , since the value of @xmath7 is in general not _ a priori _ known , one can only examine the functional dependence of @xmath81 on @xmath65 .    in ddm scenarios , in which the masses @xmath82 and @xmath83 of the invisible particles associated with the two decay chains in a given event are not necessarily equal , the @xmath62 values obtained for a population of signal events in the @xmath84 channel may differ significantly from those obtained in traditional dark - matter models , even for the same @xmath31 .",
    "moreover , we emphasize that the kinematic endpoint @xmath81 itself is not particularly useful in discriminating between ddm ensembles and traditional dark - matter candidates ; rather , it is only by comparing the _ shapes _ of the full @xmath62 distributions that one might hope to distinguish ddm ensembles from traditional dark - matter candidates . of course , the maximum value of @xmath62 for a ddm ensemble is obtained for @xmath85 , with all final - state particles maximally transverse .",
    "thus , for a sufficiently large sample of events , one finds that @xmath86 , a result identical to that obtained for a traditional dark - matter candidate with @xmath87 .",
    "we emphasize that the list of kinematic variables we have presented in this section is by no means complete .",
    "indeed , a number of additional collider variables have been developed to extract information from channels involving substantial @xmath2 .",
    "these include ratios of the transverse energies of visible particles  @xcite , the so - called `` constransverse mass '' and variants thereof  @xcite , and numerous generalizations of the @xmath62 variable  @xcite , including particular variants  @xcite specifically designed for probing scenarios in which the invisible particles have unequal masses . while we do not consider any of these additional variables in this paper , we note that an analysis of the extent to which their kinematic distributions may be influenced by different sets of event - selection criteria would be completely analogous to the procedure outlined here .",
    "our ultimate goal is to examine the prospects these kinematic variables proffer for distinguishing between different dark sectors at the lhc .   as discussed in the introduction , an analysis of the full _ distributions _ associated with these kinematic variables is frequently required for this purpose .",
    "thus , using monte - carlo simulations , we explicitly derive kinematic distributions for these variables for both the traditional dark - matter candidates and the ddm ensembles included in this study .",
    "specifically , all data sets used in this study were generated at the parton level using madgraph  5/madevent  1.4.8  @xcite with model files obtained from the feynrules  @xcite package as inputs . in order to account for the effects of detector uncertainties ,",
    "we have smeared the original values for the magnitude @xmath53 of the transverse momentum , the azimuthal angle @xmath8 , and the pseudorapidity @xmath88 obtained for each jet in each parton - level data set according to the following procedure .",
    "we replace the value of each of these three jet parameters with a pseudorandom value distributed according to a gaussian probability - distribution function .",
    "we take the mean value for this gaussian function to be the original value obtained from the monte - carlo simulation and the variance to be the square of the uncertainty in the measurement of the corresponding variable . in particular , we take the uncertainty in the @xmath53 of each jet to be given by the jet-@xmath53 resolution for the cms detector .",
    "this resolution was evaluated in ref .",
    "@xcite as a function of @xmath53 and is well approximated by the expression @xmath89 we likewise take the uncertainties in @xmath88 and @xmath8 to be given by the pseudorapidity and azimuthal - angle resolutions of the cms detector , respectively .",
    "these resolutions were evaluated as functions of @xmath53 in ref .",
    "we find that the results are well approximated by the expressions @xmath90 for @xmath91  tev .",
    "in addition to the above smearing , we also incorporate a set of precuts into our analysis . in particular , we consider in our analysis only those events in each of these data sets which satisfy the following precuts , which are designed to mimic a realistic detector acceptance :    * a transverse momentum @xmath92  gev and pseudorapidity @xmath93 for each of the two highest-@xmath53 jets in the event . * a minimum separation @xmath94 between those two leading jets , where @xmath95 .",
    "note that these acceptance cuts alone do not guarantee that a particular event satisfies any particular detector trigger .",
    "indeed , we have chosen not to incorporate any particular triggering criteria into our precuts because different event - selection strategies may in principle be constructed around different triggers , and we wish to inject as little prejudice as possible about the event - selection strategy at this stage in the analysis . however , when we turn to assess the prospects for distinguishing ddm ensembles from traditional dark - matter candidates in sect .",
    "[ sec : results ] , we shall include additional cuts designed to satisfy triggering requirements .",
    "following the above procedures , we can now evaluate the distributions associated with each of our kinematic variables .",
    "we begin by considering the distributions associated with the variables @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and @xmath54 . indeed , these variables are of particular relevance for new - physics searches in the dijet  +  @xmath2 channel because cuts on these variables are particularly effective in reducing sm backgrounds from qcd processes , electroweak processes , _",
    "etc_. in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : alphatdeltaphihtjjdistsforddm ] , we display the @xmath96 distributions associated with a number of traditional dark - matter models characterized by different values of @xmath7 , as well as the distributions associated with a number of ddm ensembles characterized by different values of @xmath40 for fixed @xmath98  gev , @xmath99  gev , and @xmath100 .",
    "note that these distributions have been normalized so that the total area under each is unity .",
    "in the center panel of this figure , we display the @xmath97 distributions corresponding to the same parameter choices .",
    "the results shown in these two panels suggest that the shapes of @xmath96 and @xmath97 distributions are not particularly sensitive to the structure of the dark sector and therefore not particularly useful for distinguishing among different dark - matter scenarios . indeed , we find that the @xmath96 and @xmath56 distributions obtained for different choices of the ddm model parameters @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 do not differ significantly from the distributions shown in fig .

    "fig : alphatdeltaphihtjjdistsforddm ] .    in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : alphatdeltaphihtjjdistsforddm ] , we display the @xmath54 distributions associated with the same set of traditional dark - matter models and ddm ensembles as in the left and center panels .",
    "in contrast to the corresponding @xmath96 and @xmath56 distributions , which are largely insensitive to the structure of the dark sector , the @xmath54 distributions shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : alphatdeltaphihtjjdistsforddm ] display a somewhat greater sensitivity to the spectrum of masses and couplings of the invisible particles .",
    "however , despite this sensitivity , we also find that for any given ddm ensemble , there is generally a traditional dark - matter candidate with some value of @xmath7 which yields a fairly similar @xmath54 distribution .",
    "we now turn to the distributions associated with the kinematic variables @xmath2 and @xmath62 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : metdistsforddm ] , we display the normalized @xmath2 distributions associated with a number of traditional dark - matter models characterized by different values of @xmath7 as well as a number of ddm ensembles characterized by different values of the parameters @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath40 ( with @xmath100 ) .",
    "in contrast to the distributions for @xmath96 and @xmath97 displayed in fig .  [",
    "fig : alphatdeltaphihtjjdistsforddm ] , the @xmath2 distributions shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : metdistsforddm ] are far more sensitive to the structure of the dark sector .",
    "events which involve the heavier @xmath22 in a ddm ensemble tend to have smaller @xmath2 values .",
    "the contribution from such events therefore tends to shift the peak of the distribution to lower @xmath2  especially when @xmath40 is large and the branching fraction of @xmath8 to the heavier kinematically - accessible @xmath22 in the ensemble is sizable . on the other hand , the contribution from the lighter @xmath22 nevertheless contributes to the `` tail '' of the distribution at high @xmath2 .",
    "the interplay between these two effects results in distributions for ddm ensembles with shifted peaks and longer tails  distributions whose distinctive shapes are not reproduced by any traditional dark - matter candidate , regardless of the value of @xmath7 .",
    "moreover , it can also be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : metdistsforddm ] that the shape of the @xmath2 distribution associated with a ddm ensemble is also sensitive to the choice of ddm model parameters .",
    "indeed , as discussed above , larger values of @xmath40 serve to shift the peak of the distribution to lower @xmath2 . furthermore ,",
    "comparing results across the three panels shown in the figure , we also see that larger values of @xmath26 result in a sharp decrease in event count with increasing @xmath2 above the value for which the distribution peaks , whereas smaller values of @xmath26 result in a more gradual decline in event count with increasing @xmath2",

    "[ fig : mt2distsforddm ] , we display the @xmath62 distributions associated with a variety of ddm ensembles for the trial mass @xmath101 . note that this choice of @xmath65 generally yields the most distinctive distributions because the @xmath62 variable is restricted to the range @xmath102 for any particular choice of @xmath65 .",

    "[ fig : metdistsforddm ] , we find that the @xmath62 distributions shown in this figure display a significant sensitivity to the structure of the dark sector . moreover , the shapes of the distributions of these two variables depend on the ddm model parameters in similar ways .",

    "the individual contributions to the distributions from events with different values of @xmath82 and @xmath83 can be independently resolved , as shown in the right panel of the figure , and a `` kink '' behavior arises similar to that which arises in the case in which multiple invisible particles are produced from a single decay chain  @xcite . by contrast , for small @xmath26 , these contributions can not be resolved , and the tail of the resulting distribution appears smooth . in either case , it is evident from fig .",

    "thus , we shall not consider the distributions of these other variables further .    in summary , we conclude that the distributions of some kinematic variables , such as @xmath96 and @xmath97 , are almost completely insensitive to the degree of non - minimality of the dark sector . by contrast , we find that others , such as @xmath2 and @xmath62 , are particularly sensitive to such non - minimality .",
    "finally , we find that still others , such as @xmath54 , lie between these two extremes .",
    "in any experiment , signals come with unwanted backgrounds .",
    "finding cuts that reduce these backgrounds relative to the resulting signal is therefore an important task . although we are not performing a detailed analysis of the backgrounds in this paper , there are certain sm backgrounds which are endemic to dark - matter searches in this channel .",
    "along with these are certain cuts which are well known to be particularly advantageous in dealing with these backgrounds .    for example , cuts on variables such as @xmath96 and @xmath56  variables which are strongly correlated with the angle between the spatial momenta @xmath60 and @xmath68 of the two leading jets in a given event  are particularly effective in reducing the substantial qcd background in the dijet  +  @xmath2 channel .",
    "this is because qcd - background events tend to be back - to - back and therefore seldom have @xmath104 .",
    "indeed , the minimum cut @xmath105 imposed in cms searches in this channel  @xcite has been shown to be extremely effective in reducing  and indeed effectively eliminating  the sizable background from qcd processes .",
    "likewise , cuts on variables such as @xmath54 and @xmath55  variables which are correlated with the overall energy of the underlying event  can be effective in reducing the remaining sm backgrounds which are dominated by processes such as @xmath3  +  jets , @xmath4  +  jets with the @xmath4 decaying leptonically , and @xmath5  +  jets with the @xmath5 decaying into a neutrino pair .",
    "these variables are relevant for searches in the dijet  +  @xmath2 channel for another reason as well : detector triggers useful in selecting events involving hadronic jets and substantial @xmath2 frequently rely on the scalar sum of the transverse momenta of those jets exceeding a particular threshold .",
    "unfortunately , it is possible for cuts on these variables to significantly affect the shapes of the distributions we have calculated in sect .",
    "[ sec : varsddmvstdm ] .",
    "such cuts might therefore eliminate not only our backgrounds , but also the ability of kinematic variables such as @xmath2 and @xmath62 to discriminate between minimal and non - minimal dark sectors . to illustrate this possibility",

    "[ fig : metdistsforddm ] and [ fig : mt2distsforddm ] and impose a single additional cut @xmath106 .",
    "the results are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : metdistsforddmaftercuts ] and [ fig : mt2distsforddmaftercuts ] .",
    "note that although this cut also results in a substantial reduction in the signal - event count , our primary focus is on the _ shapes _ of the distributions .",
    "thus , the distributions in figs .",

    "[ fig : metdistsforddm ] ( or equivalently comparing those of fig .",
    "[ fig : mt2distsforddmaftercuts ] with those of fig .",
    "[ fig : mt2distsforddm ] ) , we see that our @xmath96 cut has had a significant impact on the shapes of these @xmath2 and @xmath62 distributions .",
    "such cuts can therefore have a significant effect on our ability to distinguish minimal from non - minimal dark sectors .",
    "indeed , this is true even when the variable on which the cut is imposed itself displays little sensitivity to the parameters which characterize the dark sector  as we have shown to be the case for @xmath96 .",
    "2.15 truein   2.15 truein   2.15 truein    2.15 truein   2.15 truein   2.15 truein    ultimately , cuts on variables such as @xmath96 and @xmath54 are able to affect the shapes of @xmath2 and @xmath62 distributions for only one reason : _ there are non - trivial correlations between these two groups of variables_. otherwise , in the absence of such correlations ( and given sufficient statistics ) , cuts on these variables would result in a uniform reduction in signal events across these distributions but leave the overall _ shapes _ of these distributions intact .    in order to explore this issue",
    "further , we turn to directly examine the correlations between the variables @xmath107  which are important for removing backgrounds and extracting signals  and the variables @xmath108  which are also important for distinguishing between minimal and non - minimal dark sectors .",
    "the correlations between this former set of variables and @xmath62 ( with a trial mass @xmath101 ) are illustrated in the scatter plots displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : scatterplotsmt2 ] for a benchmark set of traditional dark - matter models ( left column ) and ddm ensembles ( center and right columns ) . in each of these scatter plots ,",
    "we display several sets of data points associated with these different benchmark models .",
    "each data point corresponds to a single event chosen randomly from the monte - carlo data sample for that model : its color indicates the model with which it is associated and its coordinates indicate the values @xmath109 and @xmath110 of the two kinematic variables @xmath111 and @xmath112 of interest for the corresponding event .",
    "thus , the density of points within the region @xmath113 to @xmath114 indicates the relative likelihood of values for @xmath111 and @xmath112 within that range occurring in combination .",
    "a uniform density of points throughout a particular panel would imply that the variables are essentially uncorrelated .    clearly ,",
    "the results shown in fig .  [ fig : scatterplotsmt2 ] indicate not only that @xmath62 and the variables @xmath107 are correlated in interesting , non - trivial ways , but also that these correlations often depend sensitively on the masses and couplings of the dark - sector particles ! for example , we observe from the top left panel of this figure that there is far less overlap among the data - point distributions for traditional dark - matter models with different @xmath7 within the region of parameter space in which @xmath105 than there is within the region in which @xmath115 .",
    "therefore , while a cut on @xmath96 of this magnitude does significantly reduce the total number of signal events , this effect is offset at least in part by the fact that the @xmath62 distributions of the surviving data points for different @xmath7 are significantly more segregated from one another after the cut than before .",
    "indeed , the way in which @xmath96 and @xmath62 are correlated makes @xmath96 a particularly effective selection variable : not only are cuts on @xmath96 effective in reducing sm backgrounds , but they also serve to _ amplify _ distinctions between the shapes of the @xmath62 distributions associated with different dark - matter models ! indeed , as we shall see in sect .",
    "[ sec : results ] , this effect more than compensates for the loss in signal - event count that arises for a threshold cut @xmath116 on @xmath96 of the order necessary to effectively eliminate the substantial qcd background .    2.15 truein   2.15 truein   2.15 truein + 2.15 truein   2.15 truein   2.15 truein 2.15 truein   2.15 truein   2.15 truein    it is likewise evident from fig .",
    "[ fig : scatterplotsmt2 ] that similar correlations exist between @xmath56 and @xmath62 .",
    "however , cuts on @xmath96 and @xmath56 are to a large extent redundant , since both variables essentially reflect the degree to which the leading two jets in a given event are back - to - back .",
    "moreover , we note that cuts on @xmath96 are typically found to be significantly more effective in reducing sm backgrounds than cuts on @xmath56 . for these reasons ,",
    "we henceforth focus on @xmath96 , but we note that results similar to those we obtain in this study could in principle be obtained by imposing cuts on @xmath56 rather than @xmath96 .    by contrast ,",
    "[ fig : scatterplotsmt2 ] reveals that @xmath54 and @xmath62 are correlated in such a way that imposing a substantial minimum cut on @xmath54 distorts @xmath62 distributions in a reliable but far less advantageous manner .",
    "in particular , we observe from the bottom left panel of this figure that a minimum cut of @xmath54 results in a far more severe reduction in signal events for traditional dark - matter models with large @xmath7 than for those with small @xmath7 .",
    "this in turn implies that in ddm scenarios and other theories involving multiple invisible particles , information about the heavier particles tends to be washed out by the application of such a cut .",
    "it therefore follows that ddm ensembles with extremely large values of the coupling index @xmath40 will be somewhat more difficult to distinguish on the basis of their @xmath62 distributions , since the branching fractions of the parent particle @xmath8 to the heavier @xmath117 are comparatively large in this case .",
    "we note that while the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : scatterplotsmt2 ] correspond to the choice of @xmath118 , we find that the corresponding results for other choices of this trial mass exhibit the same qualitative features .",
    "however , as discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : varsddmvstdm ] , the window of possible @xmath62 values narrows as @xmath65 increases . in general , this narrowing results in a greater degree of overlap among the the data - point distributions associated with different dark - matter models and consequently makes distinguishing among such models more difficult .",
    "we also note that in both the @xmath119 and @xmath120 limits , the data - point distribution associated with a ddm ensemble reduces to that associated with a single dark - matter particle with @xmath87 , as expected .    since have seen in sect .",
    "[ sec : varsddmvstdm ] that the shape of the @xmath2 distribution is also sensitive to the structure of the dark sector , it is interesting to examine the correlations between @xmath2 and the variables @xmath107 as well .",
    "we find that each of these variables turns out to be correlated with @xmath2 in a manner extremely similar to that in which it is correlated with @xmath62 . indeed ,",
    "the corresponding scatter plots are qualitatively so similar to those shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : scatterplotsmt2 ] that we refrain from reproducing them here . as we shall see in sect .",
    "[ sec : results ] , these correlations likewise imply that imposing cuts on variables such as @xmath96 , @xmath56 , and @xmath54 can have a significant effect on the distributions of both @xmath2 and @xmath62 .",
    "as we have seen , the existence of non - trivial correlations between the variables @xmath107 and the variables @xmath121 implies that cuts on variables in the first set will distort the shapes of the kinematic distributions associated with variables in the second set .",
    "this is generically true for both traditional single - component dark sectors and non - minimal dark sectors .",
    "however , these correlations are ultimately a reflection of fundamental kinematic relationships between the masses , energies , and momenta of the particles involved in the production and decay processes associated with any particular event .",
    "this means that the way in which kinetic variables are correlated  and therefore the effect that a cut on one such variable will have on the distribution of another  is itself dependent on the properties of the dark - sector particles .    as a result ,",
    "the degree to which we can ultimately exploit the distributions associated with the @xmath121 variables in order to distinguish between any two dark - matter models  and , by extension , between minimal and non - minimal dark sectors  rests upon our understanding of the correlations that exist for those models .",
    "indeed , in order to assess the degree to which dark - sector non - minimality can be distinguished at the lhc , we must compare the effects of the correlations which arise in non - minimal dark sectors with the effects of the correlations which arise in minimal dark sectors . more specifically , for the case at hand , we must ultimately _ compare _ the correlations illustrated in the second and third columns of fig .",

    "we take the minimum value @xmath132 from among the @xmath127 obtained in our survey over @xmath7 as our final measure of the distinctiveness of the distribution associated with the ddm ensemble . moreover , for the case in which the expected population of events in each bin is sufficiently large , the @xmath133 statistic follows a @xmath134 distribution with @xmath135 degrees of freedom .",
    "we can therefore estimate the statistical significance of our results by comparing the value of @xmath133 to such a @xmath134 distribution in order to obtain a @xmath136-value .",
    "we then take the number of standard deviations away from the mean to which this @xmath136-value would correspond for a gaussian distribution as an estimate of the statistical significance of differentiation  , the statistical significance with which the signal distribution can be claimed to differ from the expected distributions for traditional dark - matter candidates .",
    "we note that in principle one could also incorporate a broader class of traditional dark - matter models with other particle properties and coupling structures into this survey ; however , the inclusion of such additional models in our analysis will not significantly impact our results .",
    "one subtlety which arises in quantifying the discrepancy between different kinematic distributions is that the reliability of most goodness - of - fit statistics breaks down in cases in which there are bins for which the expected number of events in the reference model is small or zero .",
    "for example , the @xmath127 statistic defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : defofgstatistic ] ) is infinite if the expected number of events in one or more bins is zero in the traditional dark - matter model to which the ddm model is being compared . in order to address this issue ,",
    "the event count in each bin in a given background - event distribution for which @xmath137 is treated as if it were @xmath138 .",
    "this is the event count which corresponds to the 95%  c.l .",
    "upper limit on the expected number of events for data which follow a possion distribution in the case in which no events are observed  @xcite .",
    "likewise , the event count in each bin in a given signal - event distribution for which @xmath139 is treated as if it were @xmath140 . note that while the normalization of each distribution is in principle fixed by the measurement of the total number of signal events , this procedure for treating low - statistics bins does not necessarily preserve the equality between the sum of the @xmath130 and the sum of the @xmath131 for any two kinematic distributions being compared .",
    "thus , the @xmath127 statistic for each @xmath7 in the survey takes the form given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : defofgstatistic ] ) , rather than the alternative form appropriate for data distributed according to a multinomial distribution .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     having defined the @xmath133 statistic in eq .",
    "( [ eq : defofgmax ] ) , we now turn to examine how the imposition of event - selection criteria can affect the distinctiveness of the distributions of key kinematic variables  in particular , @xmath62 and @xmath2 .",
    "we begin by examining the effect of imposing a minimum cut @xmath116 on @xmath96 . in the top left panel of fig .",

    "the results shown here correspond to an integrated luminosity @xmath141 at each of the lhc detectors .",

    "indeed , for all curves shown , @xmath133 actually _ rises _ with increasing @xmath116 within the range @xmath142 .",
    "as can readily be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : scatterplotsmt2 ] , this is precisely the range within which the @xmath96 cut effectively eliminates the region of parameter space within which the data - point distributions corresponding to different invisible - particle masses overlap , yet still retains the majority of the events in the region within which those data - point distributions are the most distinctive .",
    "a similar enhancement in the @xmath133 values obtained from the corresponding @xmath2 distributions is apparent in the bottom left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : gmincurves ] .",
    "we now turn to examine the effect on @xmath133 of imposing a minimum cut @xmath143 on @xmath54 . in the top right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : gmincurves ] , we plot the value of @xmath133 for the @xmath62 distributions associated with the same ddm ensembles as a function of @xmath143 . once again , the precuts are the only additional cuts imposed on the data .",
    "in contrast with the @xmath133 curves for @xmath116 , we see that the corresponding curves for @xmath143 fall monotonically due to the loss in statistics .",
    "this is to be expected , as we have seen that there is no advantageous correlation between @xmath54 and @xmath62 which can be exploited to offset this loss .",
    "the same behavior is also apparent in the @xmath133 values obtained from the corresponding @xmath2 distributions in the bottom right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : gmincurves ] .    despite the enhancement within the range @xmath142",
    "discussed above , it is nevertheless clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : gmincurves ] that increasing @xmath116 generally has the effect of diminishing our power to discriminate non - minimal dark sectors from traditional dark sectors .",
    "likewise , we see that a similar conclusion holds , perhaps even more dramatically , for cuts on @xmath54 . however , the extraction of signal from background typically requires more than simply one or the other cut in isolation : we typically need to impose an entire slew of cuts simultaneously .",
    "inevitably , these cuts , which are designed to enhance signal extraction , further reduce our power to resolve non - trivial dark sectors relative to traditional dark sectors .",
    "thus , we find ourselves in a position in which we must ultimately balance considerations related to signal extraction against those related to dark - sector resolution .    in order to study this issue",
    ", we adopt a set of cuts which is similar to those employed in the cms jets  +  @xmath2 analysis in ref .",
    "in particular , we simultaneously require that    * @xmath144  gev * @xmath145  gev * @xmath146  .",
    "in addition to these cuts , we also impose a minimum cut of the form @xmath147 on the data and examine the effect of varying @xmath143 on the statistical significance of differentiation between ddm and traditional dark - matter models . as discussed in sect .  [",

    "note also that these selection cuts are sufficient for passing cms triggering requirements , provided that @xmath149  gev  @xcite .",
    "our results are shown in table  [ tab : finalsigsforhtjjcut ] , where we display the gaussian - equivalent significance of differentiation for the @xmath62 distributions associated with several benchmark ddm models after the imposition of the selection cuts described above .",

    "results are given for several different choices of @xmath143 .",
    "the decline in sensitivity with increased @xmath143 can be qualitatively understood as follows . since events involving heavier @xmath22 tend to have both smaller @xmath54 values and smaller @xmath62 values , as shown in the bottom left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : scatterplotsmt2 ] , increasing @xmath143 results in a disproportionately severe reduction in events involving heavier @xmath22 in comparison with events involving lighter ones . as a result , increasing @xmath143 has the effect of washing out the imprints of the heavier @xmath22 in @xmath62 distributions and leads to a decrease in the significance of differentiation , as seen in table  [ tab : finalsigsforhtjjcut ] .",
    "similarly , the dependence of the results shown in table  [ tab : finalsigsforhtjjcut ] on the power - law index @xmath40 can be qualitatively understood as follows .",
    "as @xmath40 decreases , the width @xmath19 of @xmath8 will be increasingly dominated by the contribution from decays to the lightest dark - matter component @xmath150 . thus , for sufficiently small @xmath40 , the resulting kinematic distributions become effectively indistinguishable from those obtained for a traditional dark - matter candidate of mass @xmath87 .",
    "conversely , for sufficiently large @xmath40 , it turns out that @xmath19 will be dominated by the contributions from the most massive kinematically accessible states in the ensemble . in this regime ,",
    "the resulting kinematic distributions become effectively indistinguishable from those obtained for a traditional dark - matter candidate with @xmath7 equal to the mass of the most massive accessible ensemble component . indeed , as was noted in ref .",
    "@xcite in the case of three - body parent - particle decays , there exists a particular intermediate range of @xmath40 for any particular assignment of @xmath25 , @xmath26 , , within which the branching fractions of @xmath8 to two or more of the @xmath22 are of roughly the same order and the corresponding kinematic distributions are therefore more distinctive .",
    "taken together , then , the primary message of the results shown in table  [ tab : finalsigsforhtjjcut ] is that there are non - trivial regions of our parameter space within which the population of signal events associated with a ddm ensemble can be distinguished from the population of signal events associated with any traditional dark - matter candidate on the basis of the distributions of kinematic variables such as @xmath62 . indeed , with an integrated luminosity of @xmath151 in both lhc detectors , a statistical significance of differentiation close to @xmath152 is obtained for low - to - moderate values of @xmath143 for @xmath153 and @xmath154 .",

    "finally , we have shown that still other variables such as @xmath54 lie between these extremes .",
    "furthermore , we have also demonstrated that non - trivial correlations exist between the variables @xmath121 and the variables @xmath155 . in particular , we find that @xmath96 is correlated with @xmath62 and @xmath2 in such a way that a threshold cut on @xmath96 can actually _ enhance _ the distinctiveness of the corresponding kinematic distributions in certain situations . indeed",

    "we have shown that correlations between variables give rise to a non - trivial dependence of @xmath133 on the cuts imposed  a dependence which transcends mere issues of event count .",
    "due in part to these effects , the signal - event distributions associated with ddm ensembles can be distinguished from those associated with traditional dark - matter candidates at a significance level approaching @xmath152 in many situations .",
    "one final comment is in order .",
    "our focus in this paper has been on the correlations between selection cuts and kinematic distributions of signal events and on the effects that such correlations have on the distinctiveness of those distributions .",
    "we have therefore focused our analysis primarily on the signal contributions from different dark - sector models alone and have only incorporated the sm backgrounds into our analysis as a motivation for the cuts imposed on certain kinematic variables .",
    "however , despite the established efficiency of the selection cuts adopted here in reducing those backgrounds  @xcite ( and especially the contribution from qcd processes ) , we note that the residual backgrounds from @xmath3  +  jets , @xmath4  +  jets , and @xmath5  +  jets are still quite sizable .",
    "nevertheless , it may be possible to isolate these residual backgrounds using other techniques .",
    "for example , both the normalization and shape of the `` irreducible '' background from @xmath156  jets can in principle be determined from the related process in which the @xmath5 decays into a pair of charged leptons  @xcite .",
    "such information could in principle allow for a modeling of this background that would make background subtraction a viable possibility . further reducing",
    "the @xmath4  +  jets background is a significantly more challenging endeavor .",
    "however , while a full analysis of the effect of selection cuts on the combined contribution from both signal and background processes to the relevant kinematic distributions is beyond the scope of this paper , we emphasize that the correlations we have investigated here are every bit as relevant for such a study as they have been for this background - free analysis .",

    "<S> in this paper , we examine the strategies and prospects for distinguishing between traditional dark - matter models and models with non - minimal dark sectors  including models of dynamical dark matter ( ddm )  at hadron colliders . for concreteness </S>",
    "<S> , we focus on events with two hadronic jets and large missing transverse energy at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) . as we discuss </S>",
    "<S> , simple `` bump - hunting '' searches are not sufficient ; probing non - minimal dark sectors typically requires an analysis of the actual shapes of the distributions of relevant kinematic variables . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore begin by identifying those kinematic variables whose distributions are particularly suited to this task . </S>",
    "<S> however , as we demonstrate , this then leads to a number of additional subtleties , since cuts imposed on the data for the purpose of background reduction can at the same time have the unintended consequence of distorting these distributions in unexpected ways , thereby obscuring signals of new physics . we therefore proceed to study the _ correlations _ between several of the most popular relevant kinematic variables currently on the market , and investigate how imposing cuts on one or more of these variables can impact the distributions of others </S>",
    "<S> finally , we combine our results in order to assess the prospects for distinguishing non - minimal dark sectors in this channel at the upgraded lhc .    .7ex    </S>",
