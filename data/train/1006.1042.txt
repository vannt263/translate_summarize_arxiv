    "the beauty of quantum circuit lies in the fact that it can perform certain tasks which are impossible in the classical world .",
    "for example , we can consider teleportation and super dense coding .",
    "the teleportation is a quantum task in which an unknown quantum state is transmitted from a sender ( alice ) to a spatially separated receiver ( bob ) via an entangled quantum channel and with the help of some classical communications .",
    "the original scheme was proposed by bennet _",
    "et al . _ in 1993 @xcite .",
    "since then large number of teleportation schemes and their applications have been reported @xcite .",
    "some of these teleportation schemes are also experimentally realized by different groups @xcite .",
    "the initial proposals of teleportation were meant for perfect teleportation of an unknown qubit @xmath1 . by perfect teleportation",
    "we mean that the success rate of teleportation is unity .",
    "this requires a maximally entangled quantum channel .",
    "but immediately after the pioneering work of bennet it was realized that teleportation is possible even when the quantum channels are non - maximally entangled . in that case the success rate of bob will not be unity and the teleportation scheme would be called probabilistic .    in last two decades",
    "several authors have proposed protocols for transformation of more complex quantum states .",
    "for example , schemes for teleportation of epr pair ( @xmath2 @xcite , an arbitrary two qubit state @xmath3 @xcite and an arbitrary @xmath0-qubit state @xcite are proposed in recent past . at the same time",
    ", possibility of many - party quantum teleportation has been studied by different groups and these studies lead to schemes for controlled teleportation ( ct ) or quantum information splitting ( qis ) . in these schemes , alice shares",
    "prior entanglement with bob and at least one charlie ( supervisor ) .",
    "charlie is supervisor in the sense that he can control the channel between alice and bob .",
    "bob can properly construct the state sent by alice if charlie cooperates ( i.e. if charlie send the value of his measurements to bob ) .",
    "such schemes for controlled teleportation of an unknown qubit are recently studied by karlsson @xcite , jaewoo @xcite , zhang _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and yang _",
    "@xcite by using different tripartite entangled states as quantum channel . to be precise ,",
    "karlsson has used ghz state , zhang _",
    "_ @xcite and yang _",
    "@xcite have used ghz - like state and joo @xcite has used w state . here",
    "we would like to note that in 1999 , hillery @xcite had proposed a protocol for quantum secret sharing ( qss ) . now if we consider that the quantum secret is a quantum state then a qss scheme reduces to a scheme for quantum state sharing ( qsts ) or quantum information splitting ( qis ) .",
    "we can visualize the situation as if a secret ( which is a quantum state ) is teleported to charlie and bob and one of them ( bob ) can obtain the secret ( the quantum state ) if the other one ( charlie ) collaborates .",
    "now it is easy to realize that in our context , @xmath4 .",
    "consequently the proposed protocols may found specific applications in quantum secret communication schemes . in a ct protocol",
    "the measurements of alice and charlie are communicated to bob via classical communication channels and bob uses these information to choose the unitary operation to be applied by him .",
    "consequently , any ct protocol may be reduced to usual teleportation scheme either by keeping the charlie s bit with alice or by communicating the bit to bob .",
    "but that would only make the quantum channel more complex .",
    "further we wish to add that werner @xcite had shown that there exist a one to one correspondence between dense coding and teleportation when these schemes are assumed to be tight .",
    "as we have already mentioned different quantum channels may be used to teleport the same quantum state . so far",
    "the choice of quantum channel is a bit ad hoc and a trend of introducing more and more complex quantum channels have been observed in recent past .",
    "for example , brown state @xcite , w state @xcite , etc .",
    "are recently introduced as quantum channel for teleportation .",
    "but with the present experimental efficiency it is quite difficult to construct and maintain such multi - particle entangled states . keeping these facts in mind",
    "we have tried to minimize the quantum channel cost .",
    "to do so we have generalized the existing ideas and have shown that the non - maximally entangled state of generalized bell - like can be teleported ( perfectly or in controlled manner ) by using an optimal quantum channel .",
    "the paper also establishes that there exist a family of quantum states of ghz - type which can be used for perfect and probabilistic controlled teleportation .",
    "the paper also produces some of the recently reported results as special cases of the more general results obtained here . for example , teleportation schemes proposed by cola @xcite , an ba @xcite , zhang _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and yang _",
    "@xcite etc . can be obtained as special cases of the present work .    in section 2",
    "we have proposed a new scheme for teleportation of an unknown @xmath0-qubit non - maximally entangled state of the form @xmath5 by using a bell state . in section 3",
    "we have shown that the ct of the same state is possible if we use a ghz state as quantum channel . in section 4",
    "we have shown that the ct scheme described in section 3 may also be achieved by using any member of a family of 12 orthogonal ghz__-like _ _ states as quantum channel .",
    "some of the existing results are also obtained as special cases of this protocol . finally section 5 is dedicated to conclusions .",
    "suppose we wish to teleport an @xmath0-qubit non - maximally entangled state of the form    @xmath7    where @xmath8 , @xmath9 varies from @xmath10 to @xmath11 and @xmath12 in modulo 2 arithmetic .",
    "this state will reduce to generalized bell state ( gbs ) @xcite for @xmath13 .",
    "usual bell state and ghz state are special cases of gbs for @xmath14 and @xmath15 respectively . consequently a successful teleportation scheme for the above state will be able to teleport ghz state , bell state in general and epr states in particular .",
    "since @xmath16 is called generalized bell state @xcite , we may call @xmath5 as generalized bell - type state .",
    "now , without loss of generality we may consider the unknown generalized bell - type state to be teleported as    @xmath17    where @xmath18 .",
    "alice may teleport this unknown state to bob in following five steps :    step1 : let alice and bob share a bell state of the form @xmath19 the first qubit of this maximally entangled state is kept with alice and the second qubit is sent to bob .",
    "thus this particular bell state ( [ eq : t2 ] ) constitutes our quantum channel .",
    "the proposed protocol is valid for any bell state . now",
    "the input state of the circuit ( i.e. the state of the system after alice receives the unknown @xmath0-qubit state to be teleported ) is    @xmath20_{a_{1}a_{2} .. a_{n}ab}\\end{array}\\label{eq : t3}\\ ] ]    -qubit non - maximally entangled state of the form @xmath21 by using a bell state as quantum channel . ]    here the first @xmath22 qubits are with alice and the last qubit is with bob .",
    "step2 : alice performs @xmath0 cnot operations on her qubits ( as shown in fig .",
    "1 ) by using the first qubit ( @xmath23 ) as the control qubit and the next @xmath0 qubits as target qubits .",
    "this operations transform the input state of the system ( [ eq : t3 ] ) to @xmath24_{a_{1}a_{2} .. a_{n}ab}\\end{array}.\\label{eq:4}\\ ] ] here we may use the identities @xmath25 where @xmath26 , to obtain @xmath27_{a_{1}a_{2} .. a_{n}ab}\\end{array}.\\label{eq : t5}\\ ] ]    step 3 : alice applies a hadamard operation[multiblock footnote omitted ] on her first qubit @xmath28 to transform the state @xmath29 to    @xmath30_{a_{1}a_{2} .. a_{n}ab}\\end{array}.\\label{eq : t6}\\ ] ]    by using @xmath31 we can obtain @xmath32_{a_{1}a_{2} .. a_{n}ab}\\end{array}.\\label{eq : t8}\\ ] ] here we can easily observe that alice s first and last qubits @xmath33 and @xmath34 are entangled with the bob s qubit @xmath35 and the remaining @xmath36 qubits of alice ( i.e. @xmath37 ) are separable .",
    "step 4 : alice measures all her qubits in computational basis and classically communicate the results to bob . for simplicity of visualization",
    "we may consider this measurement as two step process in which alice measures the separable qubits first by applying a measurement @xmath38 in computational basis .",
    "this measurement reduces the state to @xmath39\\end{array}.\\label{eq : t10}\\ ] ] then alice measures her entangled qubits by applying a measurement @xmath40 .",
    "we will show in the next step that bob can reconstruct the initial state ( [ eq : state ] ) by using the values of @xmath41provided he has @xmath42 .",
    "step 5 : now it is easy to observe from ( [ eq : t10 ] ) that bob may construct @xmath43 by using the result of @xmath40 .",
    "this is so because from from ( [ eq : t10 ] ) we observe that if the measurement on alice s first qubit yield 0 then we do not need to change the relative phase of bob s state . on the other hand if the measurement yield 1 then bob has to apply a phase flip operation `` z '' to get the correct relative phase . again if the second measurement yield zero then the bit values are proper but if the second measurement yield 1 then bob has to apply a bit flip operation `` x '' to obtain @xmath42 . to be more precise , according to the outcome of @xmath40 , bob applies suitable gates as shown in table 1 to his qubit . after constructing @xmath44",
    ", bob creates @xmath36 ancilla qubits @xmath45 in accordance to the outcome of @xmath46 such that @xmath47 .",
    "then bob performs @xmath36 cnot operations on his qubits by using the first qubit as control qubit and rest @xmath48 ) qubits as target qubits . and retrieve the unknown state ( [ eq : state ] ) .",
    "as the measurement and classical communication can be replaced by non - local unitary operation we can convert the generalized circuit shown in fig .",
    "1 to a circuit for measurement less teleportation of a 2-qubit non - maximally entangled quantum state as shown in fig 2 .",
    "this is done only for comparison purpose .",
    "for teleporting a 2-qubit non - maximally entangled quantum state we need a bell state as quantum channel , 9 gates and quantum cost @xcite of our circuit is 7 where as gorbachev s circuit @xcite for the same purpose requires a ghz channel , 16 gates and quantum cost of the circuit is 10 .",
    "thus the special case of our circuit ( shown in fig .",
    "2 ) has lesser gate count , lesser quantum cost and lesser quantum channel cost as compared to gorbachev s circuit @xcite for the same purpose .",
    ".quantum gates applied by bob according to different measurement outcomes of alice . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     @xmath49    respectively . from ( [ eq : t102 ] ) and ( [: eq : t103 - 1 ] ) one can easily see that if alice measures @xmath50 using bell analyzers @xmath51 while charlie measures his qubit by a measurement @xmath52 in computational basis then the state of bob reduces to a one qubit state which can be transformed into the state @xmath53 by applying an unitary transformation @xmath54 as shown in table 2 .",
    "the choice of the particular unitary operation depends on the outcome of the measurement of alice ( @xmath55 and that of charlie ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "therefore , it is required that the alice and charlie sent their measurement outcomes @xmath51 and @xmath52 to bob using classical channels and after receiving them , bob chooses the unitary operations as per the table 2 . according to measurement @xmath46 bob",
    "will create n-1 ancillas @xmath45 , such that @xmath45= @xmath56 .",
    "finally bob performs @xmath57 cnot operations as shown in fig . 3 to reconstruct the unknown state ( [ eq : state ] ) .",
    "recently it is reported by zhang _ et al . _",
    "@xcite that ct of an unknown qubit is possible if alice , bob and charlie share a ghz-_like _ tripartite maximally entangled state of the from @xmath58 . almost in the same time",
    "have independently shown that the same task may be achieved by using @xmath59 .    here",
    "we that have shown that these states are not unique and there exists an underlying symmetry . to be precise ,",
    "not only ct of an unknown qubit but ct of an @xmath0-qubit non - maximally entangled state of the form ( [ eq : state ] ) is possible if we use quantum channel of the form @xmath60 where @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 are bell states usually denoted as @xmath64 for the calculational simplicity we may use a more compact notation in which a bell state is written as @xmath65 where @xmath66 are two digit binary representation of @xmath67 and @xmath68 respectively for example for @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 . now we can use this compact notation ( [ eq : bell - compact ] ) to describe the state of the quantum channel in general as @xmath72    @xmath73 are the input bits to the circuit and the output is a ghz-_like _ state ]    the subscripts @xmath74 used in ( [ eq : channel2 ] ) indicates that the first qubit of the channel is kept with alice and the second and third qubits are sent to bob and charlie respectively . the quantum circuit for generation of these states is given in fig 4 .",
    "now we may perform ct of an @xmath0-qubit state of the form ( [ eq : state ] ) by using ( [ eq : channel2 ] ) as quantum channel .",

    "this operation transforms the input state @xmath29 into    @xmath76 alice measures the separable qubits ( @xmath77 ) in computational basis and this correspond to the measurement @xmath78 this measurement reduces the state @xmath79 to @xmath80 where @xmath81 and @xmath82 can be written as @xmath83 and @xmath84 respectively . from ( [ eq : channel2 ] ) , ( [ eq : a - decompose ] ) and ( [ eq : b - decompose ] ) one can easily see that if alice measures the qubits 1 and 2 using bell analyzers @xmath51 and charlie measures his qubit by a measurement @xmath52 in computational basis then the state of bob reduces to a one qubit state which can be transformed into the unknown qubit state by applying an unitary transformation .",
    "the choice of the particular unitary operation depends on the outcome of the measurement of alice ( @xmath55 and that of charlie ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "therefore , when alice and charlie sent the outcomes of their measurements ( @xmath51 and @xmath52 ) to bob using classical channels then bob can choose appropriate unitary operations as per the table 3 to construct @xmath85 .",

    "consequently , bob always prepares his ancillas in state @xmath113 .",
    "the present protocol is not only more generalized compared to an ba protocol @xcite but it is much more simpler too .",

    "we may claim that our protocols which involve minimum non - local quantum resource is experimentally achievable .",
    "the biggest advantage of the proposed circuits lies in the fact that maintaining a multi - partite entangled quantum channel is costly . in our case",
    "the channel is optimal as far as the number of qubits are concerned .",
    "we have proposed two schemes for ct .",
    "one is by using ghz state as quantum channel ; and other is by using ghz-_like _ states as quantum channel .",

    "further an improved version of gorbachev protocol for teleportation of 2-qubit entangled state is also obtained as a special case here .",
    "another advantage of the present work lies in the fact that unitary operations to be performed by bob is always one qubit operation . in",
    "many of the existing protocols bob needs to implement more complex quantum gates .",
