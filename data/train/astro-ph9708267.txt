    "other 96 sources still remain unidentified .    except lmc",
    ", all previously identified egret sources with higher galactic latitude ( e.g. , @xmath5 ) are blazar type agn .",
    "these agn usually have strong , compact , flat - spectrum ( @xmath6 , where @xmath7 ) radio emission , strong optical polarization and significant optical variations on short time scales . the blazar class includes objects classified as bl lacertae type objects , high polarization quasars ( hpq ) , and optically violently variable ( ovv ) quasars . although the @xmath4-ray radiation of blazars has not been well understood , some observational properties of blazars are believed to result from a relativistic jet which is directed within @xmath8 of the line of sight .    by introducing bayes theorem to assess the reliability of the identification of egret sources with extragalactic radio sources , mattox et al .",
    "( 1997 ) recently demonstrated conclusively that egret is detecting the blazar class of agn .",
    "they also indicated possible radio identifications of sources with @xmath9 in the second egret catalog and its supplement .",
    "most of these radio sources have 5ghz radio flux larger than 50 mjy and spectra index larger than -0.5 .",
    "in order to assure some of these radio sources are more probably the identifications of egret sources , optical identifications of these radio sources are necessary . based on this idea",

    "this is because that the posteriori probability strongly depends on the priori probability which , for 87 gb 080459.4 + 495915 and 87 gb 080315.5 + 512613 , were estimated as 0.0213 and 0.0005 .",
    "this large difference of the priori probability reflects the fact that strong flat - spectrum radio sources are much more likely to be detected by egret .",
    "however , we also noted that 87 gb 080459.4 + 495915 has been suggested as the identification ( with lower confidence ) of another nearby egret source 2eg j0807 + 4849 ( thompson et al .",

    "but they thought another ovv quasar 3c 196 , namely 87 gb 080959.9 + 482202 ( z=0.87 ) , is the more possible identification of 2eg j0807 + 4849 than 87 gb 080459.4 + 495915 .",

    "although mattox et al .",
    "( 1997 ) obtained much larger posteriori probability for 3c 196 and 87 gb 080305.0 + 485033 than that for 87 gb",
    "080459.4 + 495915 , we must note that this is due to the large difference in the priori probability .",
    "they assumed that the priori probability is only dependent on the 5ghz radio flux .",
    "this may bring some errors in estimating the priori probability because the flat - spectrum radio sources are more likely to be detected by egret . in this letter",
    ", we will not make more discussions about the identification of 2eg j0807 + 4849 but only focus on the identification of 2eg j0809 + 5117 . for latter case ,",
    "the optical identification of the other possible flat - spectrum radio counterpart of 2eg j0809 + 5117 , namely 87 gb 080315.5 + 512613 , is helpful to see whether or not it could be the true identification .",
    "it is very easy to find the nearest optical source of 87 gb 080315.5 + 512613 in dss ( palomar digitized sky survey ) image .",
    "we think this source , which is only @xmath1 away from the radio position , is probably the optical counterpart of 87 gb 080315.5 + 512613 .",
    "its position is r.a.=08h07m01.1s , decl.=@xmath22 ( j2000 ) , which is also about @xmath2 away from the estimated position of 2eg j0809 + 5117 .",
    "show its dss image with size of @xmath23 and also the location of radio position .    in order to exclude the possibility that this optical source is a confusion source of 87 gb 080315.5 + 512613 , we performed a simple quantitative probability analysis .",
    "we adopted the method used by de ruiter , arp & willis ( 1977 ) to identify optical counterparts of 1.4ghz radio sources .",
    "the posteriori probability of an optical counterpart can be expressed as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the priori probability and @xmath26 is the likelihood ratio given by @xmath27 .",
    "the dimensionless variables @xmath28 and @xmath29 are defined as @xmath30 and @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the number density of optical sources , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the measured position difference between the radio source and an optical object , and @xmath35 , @xmath36 are given by @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "@xmath39 and @xmath40 are the standard deviations of the right ascension and declination positions of the radio source and @xmath41 is the measurement error of the optical position .",
    "patnaik et al .",
    "( 1992 ) estimated that @xmath39 and @xmath40 for their vla measurement are both about 12 milliarcseconds .",
    "for optical sources in palomar sky survey , we take a conservative value of @xmath41 as 1 arcsecond .",
    "the number density@xmath32 of optical sources in poss plate at galactic latitute of @xmath42 is estimated about @xmath43 ( de ruiter et al .",
    "the position differences @xmath33 and @xmath34 , in the sense radio - oprical , are -0.0854 arcsec and -1.8279 arcsec for our optical counterpart of 87 gb 080315.5 + 512613 .",
    "therefore , we obtain that @xmath44 . if we assume the priori probability @xmath25 of finding an optical counterpart to a radio source is about 25% , the posteriori probability for our optical counterpart will be 0.943 .",
    "even when we assume @xmath25 is 10% , the probability is still as high as 0.917 .",
    "therefore , we think that the nearest optical source to 87 gb 080315.5 + 512613 , is most probably its optical counterpart .",
    "the probability that it is a confusion source is very low .",
    "the spectroscopic observations of this source were performed twice on januray 5 and march 8 , 1997 using the ccd detector tek1024 mounted on the 2.16 m reflector at xinglong station of beijing astronomical observatory .",
    "the spectra dispersion is about 400@xmath45 and the exposures are 40 and 70 minutes respectively . the spectrum , after the standard light sky subtraction and the absolute flux calibration using midas ( munich image data analysis system developed by eso ) , is shown in fig .",
    "it is clear that the mgii line ( 2798@xmath0 at rest frame ) has shifted to 6008@xmath0 and the ciii ] line ( 1905@xmath0 at rest frame ) shifted to 4080@xmath0 .",
    "the average redshift is 1.14 .",
    "the v - band magnitude , measured at 5500@xmath0 , is about 18.5 .",
    "the luminosity distance @xmath46 is about 10738@xmath47 and the v - band absolute magnitude @xmath48 is about -26.7 ( we adopted @xmath49 and @xmath50 ) .",
    "this quasar has not been listed in any published catalogs of agn including a well - known one edited by vron - cetty & vron ( 1996 ) .    because all previously identified egret sources with higher galactic latitude",
    "are blazars , we expect that the optical source we observed is also a blazar - type quasar if it is really the counterpart of 2eg j0809 + 5117 .",
    "however , it needs to be confirmed by more observations such as measuring its optical variability and polarization .",
    "unfortunately , we are unable to do these measurement at beijing observatory at present .",
    "we strongly encourage other interested astronomers to do these observations .",
    "we have identified an optical source , which is most probably the counterpart of a flat - spectrum radio source 87 gb 080315.5 + 512613 , as a quasar with redshift of 1.14 .",
    "although more optical observations are still needed to be done to see whether or not it is a blazar - type quasar , we think it is quite possible that 87 gb 080315.5 + 512613 is the identification of 2eg j0809 + 5117 rather than another nearby flat - spectrum source 87 gb 080459.4 + 495915 ( oj508 ) .",
    "the latter one has been previously suggested to be the lower confidence identification of another egret source 2eg j0807 + 4849 ( thompson et al . 1993 ; nolan et al . 1996 ) .",
    "but mattox et al . (",
    "1997 ) recently indicated that another steep spectrum ovv quasar 3c 196 is the more potential identification of 2eg j0807 + 4849 than 87 gb 080459.4 + 495915 based on the probability analyses .",
    "however , in their analyses the priori probability is assumed independent on the egret exposure and radio spectra index , which might bring some errors to the estimated posteriori probability .",
    "our observation still can not exclude the possibility that 87 gb 080459.4 + 495915 is the counterpart of 2eg j0809 + 5117 .",
    "if the future observations on the optical variability and polarization of the optical counterpart of 87 gb 080315.5 + 512613 confirm it is a blazar - type quasar , we think it will enhance the possibility that 87 gb 080315.5 + 512613 is the identification of 2eg j0809 + 5117 .",
    "however , even at this stage we can not state conclusively that it is the true identification because there are still a lot of blazars not detected by egret .",
    "therefor , in order to improve the present status of the egret source identifications , much more observations and analyses are still expected to be done .",
