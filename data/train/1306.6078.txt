    "observes that `` people desire to be _ paid _ respect '' and identifies honorifics and other politeness markers , like _ please _ , as `` the coin of that payment '' . in turn ,",
    "politeness markers are intimately related to the power dynamics of social interactions and are often a decisive factor in whether those interactions go well or poorly @xcite .",
    "the present paper develops a computational framework for identifying and characterizing politeness marking in requests .",
    "we focus on requests because they involve the speaker imposing on the addressee , making them ideal for exploring the social value of politeness strategies @xcite . requests also stimulate extensive use of what call _ negative politeness _ : speaker strategies for minimizing ( or appearing to minimize ) the imposition on the addressee , for example , by being indirect ( _ would you mind _ ) or apologizing for the imposition ( _ i m terribly sorry , but _ ) @xcite .",
    "our investigation is guided by a new corpus of requests annotated for politeness .",
    "the data come from two large online communities in which members frequently make requests of other members : wikipedia , where the requests involve editing and other administrative functions , and stack exchange , where the requests center around a diverse range of topics ( e.g. , programming , gardening , cycling ) .",
    "the corpus confirms the broad outlines of linguistic theories of politeness pioneered by , but it also reveals new interactions between politeness markings and the morphosyntactic context .",
    "for example , the politeness of _ please _ depends on its syntactic position and the politeness markers it co - occurs with .    using this corpus ,",
    "we construct a politeness classifier with a wide range of domain - independent lexical , sentiment , and dependency features operationalizing key components of politeness theory , including not only the negative politeness markers mentioned above but also elements of _ positive politeness _",
    "( gratitude , positive and optimistic sentiment , solidarity , and inclusiveness ) .",
    "the classifier achieves near human - level accuracy across domains , which highlights the consistent nature of politeness strategies and paves the way to using the classifier to study new data .",
    "politeness theory predicts a negative correlation between politeness and the power of the requester , where power is broadly construed to include social status , authority , and autonomy @xcite . the greater the speaker s power relative to her addressee , the less polite her requests are expected to be : there is no need for her to incur the expense of paying respect , and failing to make such payments can invoke , and hence reinforce , her power .",
    "we support this prediction by applying our politeness framework to wikipedia and stack exchange , both of which provide independent measures of social status .",
    "we show that polite wikipedia editors are more likely to achieve high status through elections ; however , once elected , they become less polite . similarly , on stack exchange ,",
    "we find that users at the top of the reputation scale are less polite than those at the bottom .",
    "finally , we briefly address the question of how politeness norms vary across communities and social groups .",
    "our findings confirm established results about the relationship between politeness and gender , and they identify substantial variation in politeness across different programming language subcommunities on stack exchange .",
    "requests involve an imposition on the addressee , making them a natural domain for studying the inter - connections between linguistic aspects of politeness and social variables .    [",
    "[ sub : request_data ] ] requests in online communities + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    we base our analysis on two online communities where requests have an important role : the wikipedia community of editors and the stack exchange question - answer community . on wikipedia , to coordinate on the creation and maintenance of the collaborative encyclopedia , editors can interact with each other on user talk - pages ; requests posted on a user talk - page , although public , are generally directed to the owner of the talk - page . on stack exchange , users often comment on existing posts requesting further information or proposing edits ; these requests are generally directed to the authors of the original posts .",
    "both communities are not only rich in user - to - user requests , but these requests are also part of consequential conversations , not empty social banter ; they solicit specific information or concrete actions , and they expect a response .    [ [ sub : politeness_annotation ] ] politeness annotation + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    computational studies of politeness , or indeed any aspect of linguistic pragmatics , demand richly labeled data .",
    "we therefore label a large portion of our request data ( over 10,000 utterances ) using amazon mechanical turk ( amt ) , creating the largest corpus with politeness annotations ( see table  [ tab : data ] for details ) .",
    "we choose to annotate requests containing exactly two sentences , where the second sentence is the actual request ( and ends with a question mark ) .",
    "this provides enough context to the annotators while also controlling for length effects .",
    "each annotator was instructed to read a batch of 13 requests and consider them as originating from a co - worker by email . for each request ,",
    "the annotator had to indicate how polite she perceived the request to be by using a slider with values ranging from `` very impolite '' to `` very polite . ''",
    "each request was labeled by five different annotators .",
    "we vetted annotators by restricting their residence to be in the u.s .  and by conducting a linguistic background questionnaire .",
    "we also gave them a paraphrasing task shown to be effective for verifying and eliciting linguistic attentiveness @xcite , and we monitored the annotation job and manually filtered out annotators who submitted uniform or seemingly random annotations .    because politeness is highly subjective and annotators may have inconsistent scales , we applied the standard z - score normalization to each worker s scores .",
    "finally , we define the politeness score ( henceforth _ politeness _ ) of a request as the average of the five scores assigned by the annotators .",
    "the distribution of resulting request scores ( shown in figure [ fig : annotation ] ) has an average of 0 and standard deviation of 0.7 for both domains ; positive values correspond to polite requests ( i.e. , requests with normalized annotations towards the `` very polite '' extreme ) and negative values to impolite requests . a summary of all our request data is shown in table  [ tab : data ] .",
