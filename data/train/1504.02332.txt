    "the term _ natural units _ usually refers to the combination of the following two techniques : employing a different set of base units , usually natural constants relevant to the respective field @xcite ; and setting some or all of these base units to unity , i.e. , omitting them in calculations @xcite .",
    "since these techniques are usually introduced together , at times with little more than `` @xmath0 '' , students may be confused about their validity and how to apply them .",
    "we here try to address this issue by introducing a mathematical formalism for unit systems and transformations between them which only builds on basic linear algebra .    to this purpose",
    ", we incorporate numerical values into the dimension space introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite and thereby extend it to the vector space of physical values . in this vector space ( as in the dimension space ) , transformations between unit systems correspond to basis transformations .",
    "in addition , we explore the formalism s mathematical background and formally introduce this vector space on an axiomatic level .",
    "finally , we discuss the possible merit of our formalism for introducing the concept of natural units as well as some fundamental concepts of linear algebra .",
    "some general remarks on notation : though the aforementioned technique of setting some or all base units to unity can easily complement our formalism , we here refrain from using it for clarity s sake .",
    "we denote vector operations with encircled symbols ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) to avoid confusion with the corresponding regular aoperations .",
    "@xmath4  denotes the null vector . _",
    "physical value _ or just _ value _ refers to a possible value of a dimensionful or dimensionless , scalar physical quantity  @xcite .",
    "examples for physical values are , , @xmath5 , @xmath6 or the value of @xmath7 . a physical value can be represented in different ways , e.g. , and are two representations of the same physical value .",
    "let @xmath8 denote the set of all positively signed physical values .",
    "we regard @xmath8 as an @xmath9-vector space , with the multiplication of physical values as vector addition and their exponentiation as scalar multiplication , i.e. : @xmath10 for example , @xmath11{m s^{-2}}$ ] written with these operations is @xmath12 and @xmath13{n}\\cdot\\unit[3]{m}$ ] is @xmath14 .    to make @xmath8 closed under @xmath3",
    ", we have to accept values such as @xmath15 or @xmath16 . however , as we will discuss in sec .  [ avoiding ] ,",
    "whether these come up in application is tied to the unit system and not a consequence of our formalism , and they can be ( and usually are ) avoided by choosing the unit system accordingly .",
    "we will now reason that the vector - space axioms hold for @xmath8 with @xmath1 and @xmath3 and explore some of its fundamental properties in the process :    * commutativity and associativity of @xmath1 are inherited from the multiplication of physical values : @xmath17 * since @xmath18 for all @xmath19 , the neutral element of @xmath1 is @xmath20 , i.e. , @xmath21 . * since @xmath22 for all @xmath19 ,",
    "the inverse of @xmath23 under @xmath1 is @xmath24 , i.e. , @xmath25 . *",

    "compatibility of multiplications : = = - @xmath27 * distributivities : @xmath28",
    "as the si  base units together with the scalar  10 are independent by means of multiplication and exponentiation , they are linearly independent and thus form indeed an algebraic basis of their span . for simplicity , we restrict the discussion to the subspace spanned by @xmath29 in the following examples . using  @xmath30 as an ordered basis , we can write for example and later use : @xmath31{m}{s }      = \\unitfrac[10^{\\log{\\mathopen{}\\mathclose\\bgroup\\left(3\\aftergroup\\egroup\\right ) } + 8}]{m}{s }      \\approx 10^{8.5}\\ , \\unit{m \\ ,",

    "for example , one common system of ( partially ) natural units used by high - energy physics corresponds to the basis @xmath32{mev}\\aftergroup\\egroup\\right\\}}$ ] of @xmath33 . using eq .",
    "[ eq : representation ] , we obtain basis transformation matrices from @xmath34 to @xmath30 and vice versa :    @xmath35    with this , we can for example transform to the above natural units , i.e. , the basis  @xmath34 ( using @xmath36 ) :    @xmath37{fm } & = { \\mathopen{}\\mathclose\\bgroup\\left(-15,1,0,0\\aftergroup\\egroup\\right)}_\\mathcal{s } \\approx { \\mathopen{}\\mathclose\\bgroup\\left(-2.3,1,1,-1\\aftergroup\\egroup\\right)}_\\mathcal{n}\\\\ & = 10^{-2.3 } \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\unit{mev }",
    "} \\approx \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\unit[197]{mev}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      a usual requirement for a unit system is that physically meaningful values can be represented without any unit being raised to a non - integer power .",
    "for example one would avoid using @xmath38 as a base unit , as this would render the unit of length to be @xmath39 . using our formalism and assuming that at least one basis element of a unit system is a positive number ( usually  10 )",
    ", we can classify those unit systems for which the above requirement is fulfilled : suppose we have an established unit system corresponding to the basis @xmath40 with @xmath41 and @xmath42 and this system fulfils the above requirement .",
    "suppose further that we want to introduce a new unit system corresponding to the basis @xmath43 with @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "we can then write the transformation matrix @xmath46 from @xmath47 to @xmath48 and its inverse as follows : @xmath49 where @xmath50 represents some real number .",
    "the leftmost columns only contain non - zero entries in the first row because @xmath51 .",
    "as @xmath48 fulfils the requirement , each  @xmath52 for @xmath53 can be expressed in units from  @xmath48 without raising any @xmath54 for @xmath53 to a non - integer power and thus @xmath55  has only integer elements .",
    "analogously , @xmath47 fulfils the requirement if and only if @xmath56 has integer elements only . if @xmath55 having only integer elements is given , @xmath56 having only integer elements is equivalent to @xmath57 and to @xmath55 being a unimodal matrix .",
    "@xmath55 and @xmath56 correspond to transformation matrices in the vector space ( or more precisely , the @xmath58-module  -module is an algebraic structure that complies with the same axioms as a vector space , but with the scalars coming only from the ring of integers  @xmath58 instead of a field . ] ) of physical dimensions introduced in ref .",
    "we introduced the vector space of physical values and thereby provided a mathematical foundation for unit systems and transformations between them . from a practical perspective",
    ", our formalism allows transforming a representation of a physical value to a different unit system with one matrix  vector multiplication , using the same matrix for a given pair of unit systems .",
    "in particular , we hope that our formalism has didactic values for introducing natural units as it not only addresses how to apply this technique but substantiates its mathematical foundations and validity .",
    "though our formalism only requires basic concepts from linear algebra , it may be challenging for some students due its unusual vector addition and scalar multiplication . on the other hand ,",
    "the latter may be beneficial if our vector space is used as an example when teaching linear algebra , as it may help to illustrate how abstract , general and diverse the presented concepts are and act prophylactic against students conflating vector operations and regular operations .",
    "furthermore , using transformations between unit systems as example for basis transformations may help overcoming certain difficulties as there is no straightforward canonical basis .",
    "finally , our approach exemplifies the value of axiomatic systems , as validating a few axioms was all we had to do to be able to safely apply well - known concepts from linear algebra to a new structure .",
