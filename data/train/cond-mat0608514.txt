    "silicon completely dominates the present semiconductor market with the greatest shares of all sales .",
    "it has an ideal bandgap ( 1.12 ev ) for room temperature operation and its oxide ( sio@xmath5 provides the necessary flexibility to fabricate millions of devices on a single chip .",
    "high integration implies high - speed operation that is limited by the interconnect propagation delay of the signal between devices .",
    "this constraint suggests that the integration of si micro - electronics might be aided by optical interconnection .",
    "unfortunately , silicon does not respond strongly to optical excitations because it is an indirect bandgap semiconductor : the band extrema for electrons and holes are located at different points in the brillouin zone ( fig .  [ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "therefore , intrinsic formation or recombination of electron - hole pairs becomes a three - particle event , which is weaker than a two - body process .",
    "therefore , there are a number of areas where si can not compete and this has allowed other materials to dominate such as optoelectronics where the indirect bandgap precludes the use of si to produce efficient light emitting diodes and lasers . if the performance of si transistors or circuits could be improved by addition of another semiconductor material then numerous new applications could open up .",
    "silicon - germanium is one such material which may be epitaxially grown on silicon wafers and allows one to engineer the bandgap , energy band structure , effective masses , mobilities and numerous other properties while fabricating circuits using conventional si processing and tools.@xcite    there has been a tremendous effort in exploring the ways of breaking the silicon lattice symmetry and mixing different momentum states in order to induce optical gain .",
    "@xcite the radiative efficiency depends on the competition between non - radiative fast processes and relatively slow radiative processes . to optimize the efficiency we have to eliminate non - radiative channels by using high purity materials and increase the oscillator strength of radiative channels .",
    "the above criteria also apply to photovoltaics .",
    "one modality for improving the optical response is quantum confinement .",
    "confinement of the charge density in quantum wells ( qws ) permits the relaxation of the optical selection rules for an interband transition .",
    "in addition , the band folding in superlattice ( sl ) structures will enhance the absorption .",
    "consequently a si based sl will reduce the symmetry which translates into band folding toward the zone center ; and as a result vertical transitions will be available at energies closer to the indirect bandgap .",
    "the discovery of visible light emission from porous silicon has enticed many researchers to reactivate studies of the optical properties of silicon based nanostructures .",
    "@xcite efficient visible light emission has been observed in si - caf@xmath6 sls,@xcite si - sio@xmath6 sls,@xcite si nanopillar structures,@xcite and in si crystallites.@xcite    beryllium chalcogenides have attracted much attention for the blue wavelength of region light emitting devices or uv detectors.@xcite they provide long life - time ii - vi lasers because of the strong covalent bonding of be .",
    "bete and bese are wide - bandgap zinc blende semiconductors with lattice constants on either side of si : they have the lattice constants of 5.6269 and 5.1477  , respectively , 3.6 % larger and 5.2 % smaller than si .",
    "vegard s law indicates that the lattice matched composition with si is bese@xmath0te@xmath1 .",
    "thus recent developments @xcite in the growth of silicon lattice - matched bese@xmath0te@xmath1 open the opportunity for a new class of si based devices .     the band structure of bulk si with the parameters of @xcite @xcite adapted with the spin - orbit constant _ @xmath7",

    "the single group notations are used since the spin - orbit splitting can not be distinguished on the chosen scale . ]    in this paper we analyze quantum confinement and band folding in silicon based heterostructures ( si / besete heterostructures ) as ways of enhancing light absorption . a semiempirical tight - binding ( tb )",
    "method @xcite is used throughout the study .",
    "although nowadays ab - initio methods ( as they are formulated within density - functional theory)@xcite are becoming routinely utilized for electronic structure and optical properties , they underestimate the bandgaps and therefore they need to be used with care .",
    "moreover , the bandgap problem is solved within the so called gw ( _ g = green function _ , _ w = screened coulomb interaction _ ) approximation which is a computational demanding task and rarely used for large systems like ours ( in our case there is an alloy plus a heterostructure).@xcite in this work we choose a tb method together with a new method@xcite intended to deal with highly mismatched semiconductors , thus considering band - bowing of the besete alloy .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we discuss methods to improve the light absorption in si based heterostructures such as quantum confinement in a single ( uncoupled ) qw and band folding in sl structures . a significant increase in direct absorption",
    "is obtained for a narrow uncoupled silicon qw . in this spirit",
    ", we calculate the electronic and optical properties of si / besete sls using the tb method mentioned above . in the last section",
    "the conclusions are outlined .",
    "since both si and bese@xmath0te@xmath1 ( as we will see below ) are indirect band materials , full band calculations are required for a theoretical understanding of electron transport and optical properties in such heterostructures . for this purpose",
    "we use the empirical tight - binding ( etb ) method as one of the most used tools in research of complex molecular and solid - state systems . @xcite despite the fact that etb is based on physical approximations such as the one - particle picture , short - range interactions , etc .",
    "( a posteriori justified , however ) , it gives fast and satisfactory results .",
    "the short - range nature of the model is suitable for modeling heterointerfaces which are present in such quantum structures .",
    "one of the most popular tb models is the _ _ sp__@xmath8 model .",
    "@xcite this is a twenty - band model if spin - orbit coupling is included .",
    "@xcite the presence of an additional @xmath9 orbital is able to reproduce the bandgap in indirect semiconductors like silicon .",
    "the tb parameters of silicon are those from @xcite @xcite augmented with spin - orbit coupling according to @xcite .",
    "@xcite    bete and bese are quite new materials in the sense that there are few experimental facts about these semiconductors .",
    "the bulk tb parameters of bete and bese were determined by fitting the gw calculations of fleszar and hanke .",
    "@xcite the band bowing has been included through a generalization of the band anti - crossing model for highly mismatched semiconductors .",
    "@xcite the details of the model and the tb parameters can be found in ref .  .",
    "the energy band diagram for bese@xmath0te@xmath1 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .",
    "the material is seen to be indirect bandgap with the conduction band minimum at the @xmath10 point .",
    "the predicted fundamental bandgap is 1.83 ev .",
    "the direct bandgap is 3.59 ev and the spin splitting is 0.67 ev .",
    "previous electrical measurements @xcite indicate a conduction band offset of at most 1.2 ev for the si / bese@xmath0te@xmath1 heterostructure . as we will see in the following subsections",
    "there are interface subbands induced at the heterostructure interfaces .",
    "this fact may overestimate the conduction band offset .",
    "therefore we choose a value of 1 ev for the conduction band offset .",
    "this makes the si / bese@xmath0te@xmath1 a type ii heterostructure .",
    "thus the top of the valence band in si is higher than in the top of the valence band in bese@xmath0te@xmath1 .",
    "the tb parameters and the conduction band offset will be used in the following sections in order to calculate electronic and optical properties of the si / bese@xmath0te@xmath1 sl .",
    "energy bands for bese@xmath0te@xmath1 calculated with tb parameters from ref .  .",
    "]      the absorption edges in bulk silicon are indirect and the jumping of the electron from valence band ( vb ) to conduction band ( cb ) is assisted by a phonon ( in electron transitions from vb to cb the * _ k _ * momentum must be conserved ) .",
    "the band structure of si is shown schematically in the fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "the indirect bandgap is @xmath11 .",
    "the absorption process involves two steps , one is electron - photon interaction and the other is electron - phonon interaction .",
    "basically we have two processes denoted by 1 and 2 . in process 1",
    "an electron is first excited to the @xmath12 state and then by an emission of a phonon the electron arrives in the @xmath13 cb state . similarly for process 2 , however , in this process it starts with an emission of a phonon .",
    "for this reason , there is a long absorption tail between 1.12 ev and and about 3 ev that reflects the indirect nature of the bandgap .",
    "then a sharp rise in absorption occurs starting around 3.2 ev ( 380 nm ) that is associated with the direct transition at @xmath14 point ( @xmath15 whose energy is 3.4 ev ( 365 nm ) .    in direct bandgap materials",
    "light absorption in 2d systems is formally similar to 3d systems unlike the light absorption in indirect bandgap systems . the absorption coefficient for an uncoupled si/ bese@xmath0te@xmath1 qw has basically three components @xcite    @xmath16,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath17 is a constant",
    ", @xmath18 gives the direct bandgap contribution and @xmath19 gives the phonon assisted contribution with 1-phonon absorption , and @xmath20 is the phonon assisted contribution with 1-phonon emission . basically ,    @xmath21    @xmath22    @xmath23 is the bulk dipole matrix element between bands , @xmath24 is the matrix element contribution from electron - phonon interaction , and @xmath25 is the overlap between the envelope - functions at different brillouin points :    @xmath26    where @xmath27@xmath28 is the location in @xmath29space of each conduction valley . for silicon ,",
    "if @xmath30 is the growth direction , then the 2 valleys along z - directions ( with @xmath31 are responsible for direct transitions .",
    "the other four valleys contribute to phonon - assisted absorption . for infinite wells the overlap integral @xmath25 has the behavior depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] .",
    "for very narrow qw s the overlap integral tends to one , which means that in a genuine 2d system only the transverse momentum has to be conserved . for the other asymptotic limit ,",
    "i.e. very wide well , the overlap integral vanishes . in physical terms",
    ", this says that the system became genuinely 3d and any electromagnetic transition has to be vertical in the absence of phonons .",
    "moreover , from fig .  [ fig:3 ]",
    "we may expect to have a strong direct transition ( with an overlap integral no less than 0.1 ) for a qw with a width up to 20  , i.e. an ultrathin qw . in the following",
    "we will discuss the possibility of improving the oscillator strength in si/ bese@xmath0te@xmath1 based sls .",
    "the overlap integral ( eq.([eq:5 ] ) for infinite wells in silicon . the wave vector * * k**@xmath28 in eq.([eq:5 ] ) is the wave vector for silicon conduction valleys along @xmath32axis . ]",
    "the use of sl structures relaxes the condition of ultrathin qw .",
    "the alternation of qws and barriers along [ 001 ] growth axis will generate a band folding in the sl and band mixing of zone - center and zone edge states .",
    "@xcite the band mixing will inherently enhance the oscillator strength for direct transition in si structures .",
    "on the other hand , band folding will induce states in which vertical transitions are possible at energies far lower than 3.4 ev , the lowest energy for vertical transitions in bulk si .",
    "we consider a si / bese@xmath0te@xmath1 sl whose layers are perpendicular to [ 001 ] direction .",
    "we employ the nearest neighbor _ _ sp__@xmath8 tb hamiltonian including spin - orbit interaction .",
    "although there are optimized nearest - neighbor tb parameters in the literature@xcite we chose the parameters given in ref .  .",
    "these parameters include the chemical trends which are needed for an overall description of both valence and conduction bands .",
    "as it was noted before , the optimized nearest - neighbor parameters may have unphysical interaction energies and they are dedicated for either valence band or conduction band calculations.@xcite moreover the nearest - neighbor model has the inability to reproduce the transverse / light x - valley effective mass .",
    "however , the conduction band edges in low - dimensional structures will be determined by the longitudinal / heavy effective mass at the conduction band minimum .",
    "therefore we opted for a less accurate yet a very representative set of parameters because these parameters are within the physical capabilities of the nearest neighbor model .",
    "we denote this sl as a ( si@xmath3/(bese@xmath0te@xmath4 sl with @xmath35 two - atom thick layers of si and @xmath36 two - atom thick layers of bese@xmath0te@xmath1 repeated periodically .",

    ".. si , be , te / se , be , te / se ,  .. be , te / se . covalent bonds between si on the one hand and be or se / te on the other are not electrically neutral.@xcite for si - based heterostructures special care has to be exercised due to excess / deficiency of electrons at interface and due to antiphase domains.@xcite these problems can be overcome by vicinal growth and passivated surfaces.@xcite in this way one can minimize the interface charging effects .",
    "moreover , self - consistent ab - initio calculations show that the electric fields due to difference in ionicity between the two semiconductor constituents of a superlattice dominate the total electric field.@xcite therefore the accumulated charge with respect to the bulk contributes in a much lesser degree to the total electric field in the superlattice structure .",
    "in addition to that , the etb fully self - consistent calculations as those described by della sala and coworkers@xcite are not much different from those non - self - consistent calculations provided that the current densities in the confined system are low.@xcite all the above facts lead us to conclude that a `` zero - field '' approximation will give us at least a qualitative picture of si / bst structures .",
    "the tb matrix elements of the si / bese@xmath0te@xmath1 sl are taken directly from those bulk values .",
    "the on - site energies of the bese@xmath0te@xmath1 are accordingly changed to match the valence band offset at the interface .",
    "simple averages were used to supply the parameters connecting different materials at the interface .",
    "since the spin orbit must be included , the sl hamiltonian will be represented as having @xmath38 functions .",
    "once the tb matrix elements have been established the sl band structure reduces to the diagonalization of the @xmath39 matrix hamiltonian . the band structure of ( si@xmath40/(bese@xmath0te@xmath4 sl for @xmath41 and @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45",

    "the zero of energy corresponds to the top of the valence band in bulk si .",
    "the band folding effect can be seen as many crowded subbands .",
    "two interface bands ( i@xmath46 and i@xmath47 , one empty and one occupied , were found .",
    "they lie in the lower and upper parts of the bandgap of bulk silicon , respectively .",
    "the origin of these interface bands rests on the polar nature of the interface as was also found in gaas / ge sl .",
    "@xcite the polarity of the interface originates from the large differences in the on - site energies for the constituent atoms ( si and be or se / te ) . even if a ( 110 ) non - polar interface is used , one interface band is still found in ii - vi / iv sls .",
    "@xcite we calculated the planar charge density of some of the occupied and empty band edge states of the sl with @xmath48 at the @xmath49 point in the brillouin zone .",
    "the planar charge density of some of the band edge states and interface states are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] . by interface states we mean states that die away within a few layers from the interface .",

    "the charge density of the @xmath50 interface state has a maximum at the be - si interface , while the next occupied state is more confined in the bese@xmath0te@xmath1 layer , but it still spills over into the si barrier .",
    "the third occupied state spills more over into the si slab , not only due to interface but also due to the fact that the state is closer to the top of hole barrier in si .",
    "the charge density of the @xmath52 interface state has a maximum at the si - se / te interface , while the next empty state is confined , but it is still localized toward the interfaces . only the third empty state is genuinely confined to the silicon slab .",
    "we believe that the charge distribution of the interface subbands is related to the acceptor behavior of be and donor behavior of se and te with respect to si .",
    "@xcite          the electronic contribution to absorption spectrum is given by @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the absorption coefficient and @xcite    @xmath56    is the imaginary part of the dielectric function . here",

    "( [ eq:6 ] ) it is invoked the electric dipole approximation in the low - temperature case . in etb the expressions for optical absorption and , in general , the interaction with the electromagnetic field are different than those encountered in conventional quantum mechanics due to incompleteness of the basis.@xcite in the electric dipole approximation , however , the expressions of optical absorption are the same .",
    "the full temperature - dependent equations for optical absorption are derived in refs .   and .",
    "beyond the dipole approximation the standard expression ( [ eq:6 ] ) is no longer valid . the problem is treated exhaustively in ref . , where it is explicitly shown how the hamiltonian is altered by the vector potential of the electromagnetic field .",

    "similar results were found in the calculations for porous si with periodic boundary conditions:@xcite the absorption band edge does not vary much with si porosity .",
