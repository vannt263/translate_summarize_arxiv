    "the cepheus e ( cep e ) outflow was first detected in the @xmath10co j=1 - 0 transition in some of the early radio studies of star formation in molecular clouds . in his catalog of molecular outflows ,",
    "fukui ( 1989 ) first pointed out the presence of a bipolar , high velocity outflow in this region .",
    "the bipolar nature of cep e became clear with the k@xmath11 image of the molecular outflow obtained by hodapp ( 1994 ) , which included the stronger nir h@xmath0 lines , and revealed a relatively compact system ( with a size of @xmath12 1.5 ) .",
    "subsequent studies in the near / mid infrared have shown that the outflow is quite bright in the h@xmath0 ( 1,0 ) s(1 ) 2.12 @xmath13 m  line , consistent with models of shock excited h@xmath0 gas .",
    "suttner et al . (",
    "1997 ) have used three - dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of highly collimated molecular outflows in order to model the morphology of cep e. these simulations , however , required a very high density _ in _ the jet ( @xmath14 @xmath15 ) , which are not consistent with the hot and dense co bullets recently found in the flow , with densities of @xmath16 @xmath15 .    the iras 23011 + 6126 source",
    "was originally identified as the main candidate for the outflow source .",
    "however , the presence of multiple outflows in near infrared and radio wavelengths indicates the existence of at least two sources , which have recently been confirmed by ovro observations at 1.3 and 2.6 mm .",
    "the sources are embedded and invisible at optical and near infrared wavelengths , and are likely to be class i or class 0 protostellar objects .",
    "in addition , noriega - crespo et al .",
    "( 1998 ) detect one source at 6.9 @xmath13 m using isocam , which is well detected in all iras bands .",
    "the present study has been motivated by the detection of emission at optical wavelengths in a small section of the southern lobe of the cepheus e outflow by noriega - crespo ( 1997 ) and devine et al .",
    "noriega - crespo ( 1997 ) mentions that h@xmath6 and [ sii ] 6717/31 images reveal a compact knot which is the optical counterpart of the southern bowshock observed at 2 @xmath13 m by eislffel et al .",
    "this optical knot has been named hh  377 .    in this study",
    ", we explore the link between the physical properties of the outflow as determined from optical imaging and spectroscopy , and compare these results with those obtained from observations in the near infrared .",
    "our goal is to understand the development of very young stellar outflows ( we notice that cep e has a dynamical age of @xmath17 years ( noriega - crespo et al .",
    "1998 ) ) and the relationship between the mechanisms that produce the infrared and optical emission .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe the different observations obtained for this work , and comment on the reduction and calibration techniques . in section 3",
    ", we present the results obtained from our infrared and optical observations .",
    "finally , in section 4 we compare the physical properties of cepheus e deduced from the optical and the nir observations with other herbig haro objects .",
    "the optical and infrared observations were carried out at three different observatories . the log of the observations is presented in table 1 , and they are described in detail below .",
    "the nir images of cep e were obtained at two observatories .",
    "a set of images was obtained at the apache point observatory 3.5 m telescope ( apo 3.5 m ) with a @xmath18 array at f/5 and a 0.482  per pixel scale .",
    "the central wavelengths ( and bandpass ) of these images were at 2.12   ( 1@xmath19 ) , for the h@xmath0 ( 1,0 ) s(1 ) line , and 2.22(4@xmath19 ) for the nearby continuum .",
    "another set of images was obtained at the observatorio astronmico nacional at san pedro mrtir 2.1 m telescope ( oan spm 2.1 m ) with the ir camera / spectrometer camila , which has a @xmath20 array providing a 0.85 /pixel scale at f/4.5 .",
    "the central wavelengths ( and bandpass ) of the filters used to obtain these images were 2.12  ( 1@xmath19 ) , 2.25  ( 1@xmath19 ) for the h@xmath0 ( 2,1 ) line , ck ( 2@xmath19 ) and br@xmath21 2.16 .",
    "the frames were flattened with a combination of low and high illumination sky flats obtained at sunset .",
    "the data were processed by subtracting a median - filtered image of nearby sky frames taken with the same integration time and with offsets between 30 and 100 .",
    "bad pixels were removed with standard techniques .",
    "the processing of our frames was done with image reduction and analysis facility ( iraf ) based programs . for each filter , 10 ( apo data ) and 9 ( oan spm data ) overlapping frames were taken ( see table  1 for the integration times ) .",
    "the frames were aligned using several field stars , and median combined into the final images .",
    "the image scale and orientation were calculated using 7 common stars between the ir frames and an optical image from the digitized sky survey , with a resultant mean uncertainty of less than one arcsecond in the positions .",
    "the nir spectra were obtained with the multiple mirror telescope observatory ( mmto ) .",
    "the set of h and k band spectra of the north and south lobes of cep e were taken with the rieke fspec ir spectrometer .",
    "the slit was aligned in the e - w direction in both lobes ( see figure 1 ) and alternate exposures were chopped between the source and the local sky . the atmospheric absorption and sensitivity variation along the dispersion were corrected by observing a bright late - f type star at nearly the same airmass as the target data .",
    "the spectra were obtained with a 1.0@xmath22 wide slit , and the extraction was done over an area of 4.0 @xmath23 for each outflow lobe .",
    "as mentioned above , the south lobe of cep e is detected at optical wavelengths , in the h@xmath6 and [ s  ii ] 6717/31 lines .",
    "our narrow band images in h@xmath6 and [ s  ii ] were obtained with the 1.2 m telescope at fred lawrence whipple observatory ( flwo 1.2 m ) . a thinned ,",
    "back - side illuminated , ar coated loral @xmath24 ccd was used with a plate scale of 0.315 /pix .",
    "the central wavelength and fwhm of the narrow band h@xmath6 , [ s  ii ] and continuum filters are , respectively , @xmath256563 , 25  , @xmath256724 , 50  , and @xmath256950 , 400  .",
    "the ccd images were binned two by two giving a 0.63  /pix scale , and were processed using iraf , in the standard way . for each filter",
    ", the final image corresponds to the median - filter of three 600 seconds frames .",
    "a low resolution , long - slit spectrum over a @xmath26    wavelength range with @xmath27  / pix was obtained at the mmto telescope .",
    "the spectrum was reduced using iraf and flux calibrated using the standard star hr8687 .",
    "two long - slit spectra were also obtained at the flwo 1.5 m telescope with the fast spectrometer , using a loral @xmath28 coated ccd with 15@xmath13 m pixels .",
    "two different spectral resolutions ( 1.49  / pix and 0.75  / pix ) were used to cover the wavelength ranges of 5500 - 7000   and 6200 - 6800  . the slit width was 1.1  and the slit was oriented n - s . the spectra were flux calibrated with the standard stars bd284211 and g191b2b .",
    "the complex structure shown by cepheus e in vibrationally excited molecular hydrogen lines has been described in previous papers .",
    "figure  [ fig_ir ] shows a section of our h@xmath0 ( 1,0 ) s(1 ) continuum subtracted image , in which we plot the slit positions used to obtain the infrared spectra .    using the h@xmath292.121@xmath13 m and @xmath252.248@xmath13 m images we construct a ( 1,0)/(2,1 ) s(1 ) line ratio image .",
    "the line ratio is nearly constant throughout the outflow with a mean value of @xmath30 .",
    "this result is completely consistent with previous results on this object .    in our bracket @xmath21 + continuum image",
    "we have detected emission extending over both lobes .",
    "the distribution of this emission is very similar to the one of the continuum ck frame .",
    "because of this similarity we suspect that the flux detected in our br@xmath21 frame is on the whole continuum emission .",
    "this interpretation is consistent with the absence of br@xmath21 line in the spectra obtained for the brightest knots of both lobes ( see figure [ fig_irspec ] ) .",
    "the spatially integrated spectra in the h and k bands of the northern and southern lobes of cepheus e are shown in figure [ fig_irspec ] .",
    "these spectra were constructed by integrating along the slit over the width of the lobes ( @xmath31 ) for the slit positions indicated in figure [ fig_ir ] .",
    "the identified and measured h@xmath0 lines in these bands are indicated on the plots at the expected wavelengths . note that no br@xmath21 ( @xmath32 m ) line emission is detected in these slit positions , which correspond to the brightest knots of each lobe .",
    "table  2 lists the h@xmath33 transitions ( column 1 ) , their wavelengths ( column 2 ; see black & van dishoeck , 1987 ) ; the energy @xmath34 of the upper level ( column 3 , dabrowski 1984 ) , and the measured fluxes of the identified h@xmath33 lines ( columns 4 and 5 for the n and s lobes , respectively ) . from these spectra",
    "we determine a @xmath35 90@xmath36 km s@xmath9 between the northern and southern lobes , and the south lobe shows a blueshift . comparing the fluxes for ( 1,0 ) s(1 ) and",
    "( 2,1 ) s(1 ) lines from our spectra with previous values obtained from surface photometry for these transitions , we find that our ( 1,0 ) s(1 ) flux values are lower with respect of the eislffel et al .",
    "values , by a factor @xmath37 .",
    "whereas in the case of ( 2,1 ) s(1 ) fluxes the present and previous measurements are completely consistent .",
    "we have estimated the column densities @xmath38 assuming that the lines are optically thin , in order to determine the excitation temperature , @xmath39 , of the warm molecular gas in each lobe . under conditions of local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) , the relationship between column density and energy of the upper level @xmath34 , is @xmath40 = e(v , j)/k t_{exc } + c $ ] ; where @xmath41 is the degeneracy of the corresponding level , @xmath42 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath43 is a constant .",
    "figure [ fig_texc ] shows the excitation diagrams for cep e , south and north lobes .",
    "we plot @xmath44 versus energy @xmath34 of the level for each lobe using the fluxes listed in table  2 ( 3,2 ) s(5 ) line presented in table 2 .",
    "this transition shows a bigger column density than expected , which causes great dispersion in the estimation of the excitation temperature , so we have excluded it from our analysis . ] . in each panel , the transitions between the ( 1,0 ) vibrational levels are plotted with solid squares , the ones between the ( 2,1 ) levels with triangles and the ( 3,2 ) levels with solid circles .",
    "the excitation temperatures , t@xmath45 ( calculated from linear fits ) , are @xmath46 for the south lobe and @xmath47 for the north lobe .    in the case of a purely thermal population caused by a shock",
    ", it is expected that a single smooth curve should fit all of the transitions in the excitation diagrams , meaning that a single temperature describes the excitation . on the other hand , in the case of fluorescent h@xmath0 emission",
    ", the points within vibrational levels are expected to be aligned on separate curves , resulting in different temperatures for different vibrational levels .",
    "intermediate cases in which there is a combination of both excitation mechanisms are also possible ( fernandes & brand 1995 ; fernandes , brand & burton 1995 ) .    the derived excitation temperatures , t@xmath45 , for both lobes of cepheus e are consistent with the t@xmath45 measured in hh objects ( t@xmath48 k , gredel 1994 ) , whereas the excitation temperatures observed in collisionally plus fluorescent excited objects have t@xmath49 values ( fernandes , brand & burton 1997 ) . however , in figure [ fig_texc ] there are real dispersions around the dashed lines drawn in each panel .",
    "if we fit the points from different vibrational levels separately , there are slight differences between these fits and the fit obtained considering all of the vibrational levels together .",
    "we have computed the rotational excitation temperatures using the transitions within different vibrational levels .",
    "the resulting temperatures are listed in table  3 . in order to explore the excitation mechanisms occurring in the cep e outflow ,",
    "we have computed some interesting line ratios ( with the fluxes presented in table  2 ) , which are also listed in table  3 .",
    "this table gives the vibrational levels ( column 1 ) , the rotational levels of the transitions used for the ratios ( column 2 ) , the rotational temperature t@xmath50 derived from these transitions ( column 3 ) , the empirical ortho / para ratio derived for each vibrational level ( column 4 ) , and the ( 1,0)/(2,1 ) s(1 ) ratio derived for each spectrum ( column 5 ) .    as we can see , for both lobes of cepheus e the rotational excitation temperatures ( table 3 ) are lower than the calculated vibrational temperature t@xmath45 ( see figure [ fig_texc ] ) . though different from t@xmath45 ,",
    "the rotational temperatures are still consistent with the temperatures observed in collisionally excited objects .",
    "we should note that the vibrational level ( 2,1 ) shows the lowest rotational temperature .",
    "we find that the values obtained for the ortho / para ratio are similar for the two lobes of cepheus e. for the northern lobe there is a higher dispersion for this ratio between the different vibrational levels .",
    "this is a result of the dispersion in the points corresponding to the ( 2,1 ) and ( 3,2 ) levels ( see top panel of figure [ fig_texc ] ) .",
    "this dispersion is probably a result of the fact that the spectrum of the northern lobe is fainter .",
    "we conclude that the ortho / para ratios estimated for cep e are completely consistent with the lte value of 3 , as expected for collisional excitation .",
    "we analyzed the behavior of the ( 1,0)/(2,1 ) s(1 ) line ratio .",
    "column ( 5 ) of table 3 gives the @xmath51 and @xmath52 values obtained for the northern and southern lobes , respectively .",
    "these values are consistent with the result obtained from the ( 1,0)/(2,1 ) s(1 ) ratio image ( see above ) , and slightly lower than the ones measured from ( 1,0)/(2,1 ) s(1 ) frames by eislffel et al .",
    "also , the obtained ( 1,0)/(2,1 )",
    "s(1 ) line ratio is completely consistent with the value of 10 expected for collisional excited h@xmath0 lines , and does not approach the @xmath12 1.7 value expected for fluorescent excitation .",
    "a detailed analysis on the k - band spectra of cep e has already been performed by ladd & hoddap ( 1997 ) .",
    "they found that a c - type shock with 35 km / s can explain the k - band h@xmath0 fluxes and ratios .",
    "this is consistent with the iso long wavelength spectrometer observations , which show several emission lines from h@xmath0o transitions , as it is expected from molecular c - type shocks .    in cep",
    "e we find a similar situation as in other herbig - haro objects ( e.g. hh 1 - 2 ; davis et al . 1994",
    "; noriega - crespo & garnavich 1994 ) where j - type ( inferred from the optical spectra ) and c - type ( inferred from the ir spectral ) seem to coexist spatially .",
    "the case of cep e is particularly interesting since it appears to be a very young outflow , based on its compact size and the age of its exciting source .",
    "if so , a better interpretation of its spectral properties may require molecular time dependent shock models , which are currently under development .",
    "in contrast with the complex structure of the h@xmath33 outflow , the optical emission consists of only one compact knot ( hh  377 ) , which approximately coincides with the brighter h@xmath0 knot of the southern lobe . in figure 4",
    "we present an h@xmath0 1 - 0 s(1 ) contour map of cepheus e , overlaid on grey - scale and contour representations of our optical images .",
    "panel @xmath53 shows grey - scale representations of the h@xmath6 image and panel @xmath54 of the [ s  ii]6717,6731 image .",
    "panels @xmath55 and @xmath56 show the h@xmath6 and [ s  ii]6717,6731 images ( respectively ) as contour maps , over a smaller angular area .",
    "these maps clearly show the coincidence between the optical knot and the brightest region of the southern lobe of the ir flow .    in figure 4 , we see that a star still remains in the h@xmath6 continuum subtracted image ( panel @xmath57 ) , to the west of hh  377 .",
    "this stellar emission could indicate either that the star has intrinsic h@xmath6 emission , or that the stellar continuum has a substantially different slope than the continua of the stars used to obtain the relative scaling between the h@xmath6 and the continuum frames .",
    "the h@xmath6 and [ s  ii ] morphologies of hh  377 are different , the knot is resolved in both images , but it is clearly brighter and more compact in the [ s  ii ] image . in our [ s  ii ] image ,",
    "hh  377 has an angular size of 5 , resulting in a diameter of 0.02 pc ( at a distance of 0.75 kpc , hodapp 1994 ) for the knot .",
    "we can also see that the morphology of the southern lobe of cep e is qualitatively consistent with a bow - shock model , in which the wings have a stronger contribution of h@xmath0 emission , while the head is dominated by the atomic / ionic emission .",
    "finally , in figure 4 ( panel @xmath58 ) , we show the two slit positions used to obtain the spectra described in the following section .",
    "we have obtained two spectra ( intermediate and low resolution ) with the n - s slit ( see figure 4 ) , and a single ( low resolution ) spectrum with the e - w slit ( see the discussion in section 2.2 ) .",
    "our spectrophotometric data gives us the optical excitation conditions of hh  377 .",
    "figure 5 shows the flux - calibrated spectrum , extracted from a 4 @xmath59 in the e - w oriented slit ( see panel @xmath58 of figure 4 ) .",
    "the results obtained for the relative fluxes with and without reddening correction ( for our three spectra ) are listed in table 4 .",
    "column 1 gives the identification of the detected lines , column 2 lists the observed ( @xmath60 ) and reddening - corrected ( @xmath61 ) relative fluxes for the e - w slit , column 3 and 4 list the fluxes from the n - s slit at low and intermediate resolutions , respectively .",
    "the determination of the value of @xmath62 that we have used is discussed in the following section .",
    "in addition , the radial velocity estimate from these spectra is @xmath63 - 70@xmath64 km s@xmath9 .    from the spectrum with larger wavelength coverage ( see table 4 and figure 4 )",
    ", we can see that [ ni]5200 is greater than h@xmath8 and that the [ sii]6717/31 and [ oi]6300/64 fluxes are stronger than h@xmath6 .",
    "no [ oiii]5007 nor [ nii]6548,83 emission is detected .",
    "these observed characteristics are typical of low excitation herbig - haro objects .",
    "finally , we use the [ sii ] 6731/6717 line ratio to compute an electron density @xmath65 ( assuming an electron temperature @xmath66 k ) . as discussed in the following section ,",
    "this result is particularly interesting .",
    "as the limited wavelength coverage of our spectra does not allow us to use miller s ( 1968 ) method , we have determined the reddening by assuming that the intrinsic ( dereddened ) balmer decrement has a h@xmath6/h@xmath8=3 , ( i.e. , a recombination cascade value ) . using the measured h@xmath6/h@xmath8=7.75 ratio and the standard , @xmath67   ism reddening curve of mathis ( 1990 ) , we obtain @xmath68 ( corresponding to an @xmath69 optical extinction ) .",
    "this method is of course uncertain for the case of cepheus e ( and other hh objects ) since it is expected that in the case of low velocity shocks the balmer decrement could differ substantially from the recombination value .",
    "we have used the optical total - to - selective ratio @xmath70 which is frequently used in this cases and appears to be the most appropriate for hh objects .    in table 5",
    "we present line ratios observed for cep e from the fluxes given in column 2 of table 4 .",
    "the optical spectroscopic characteristics of hh  377 ( cep e ) identify it as a low excitation object .",
    "indeed , we find that the excitation of this object appears to be anomalously low , compared to other low excitation hh objects .",
    "for example , most of the observed line ratios obtained for hh  377 are consistent with the ones observed in other low excitation objects , except for the [ sii](6717 + 6731)/h@xmath6 ratio . for hh  377",
    ", this ratio is a factor of @xmath2 higher than the corresponding values for the low excitation hh objects ( hh  7 , hh  11 , hh34(jet ) , hh  47a , hh  111 d - j , hh  125 i and hh  128 ) , this fact is clear in second panel top to bottom , figure 6 .",
    "the [ sii ] 6731/6717 ratio is also the highest one observed ( with a value of @xmath71 ) .",
    "this line ratio implies an electron density @xmath724100  @xmath15 , which is the largest @xmath73 measured for any previously detected , low excitation hh object ( see figure 6 , bottom panel ) .",
    "the electron density is relatively high and comparable to the densities measured in high excitation hh objects .",
    "the low excitation in cep e suggests , however , a low ionization fraction and therefore a higher gas density than usual .    following raga et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , we compare the line ratios of cep e ( hh  377 ) with those obtained for other hh objects .",
    "we refer the line ratios to the [ oi]6300/h@xmath6 ratio , which is different from raga et al.(1996 ) , who plot all of the line ratios versus the [ n i](5198 + 5200)/h@xmath8 line ratio .",
    "we have done this because the [ n  i ] lines have a very low critical density ( @xmath12 2900 @xmath15 ) , so that collisional quenching will occur in cep e ( while not in the other low excitation hh objects ) .",
    "in figure 6 we plot the [ ni](5198 + 5200)/h@xmath8 , [ sii](6717 + 6731)/h@xmath6 , and [ sii]6731/6717 line ratios ( and also , the electron density @xmath73 ) as a function of the [ oi]6300/h@xmath6 ratio , indicating the values that correspond to high , intermediate and low excitation hh objects .",
    "the line ratios for cep e are indicated with an asterisk . in this figure",
    "we can see the anomalous line ratios , specially the [ sii](6717 + 6731)/h@xmath6 ratio and electron density ( @xmath73 ) obtained for cep e , in contrast to other low excitation hh objects .",
    "let us now compare the line ratios of hh  377 ( cep e ) with shock model predictions .",
    "the plane shock models of hartigan et al .",
    "( 1994 ) do show high [ sii](6717 + 6731)/h@xmath6 ratios , in better agreement with the observations of hh  377 . from this work",
    ", we list the range of line ratios obtained for models of shock velocities in the v@xmath74 - 30  km  s@xmath9 range ( labeled j4.20 - 30 in table 5 ) , and models with v@xmath75 - 40   km  s@xmath9 ( labeled j4.30 - 40 ) , in both cases with a high pre - shock density n@xmath76 @xmath15 and magnetic fields between 30 and 300 @xmath13 g .",
    "we have also listed the line ratios for models with v@xmath77  km s@xmath9 and lower pre - shock density ( n@xmath78 @xmath15 ) and the same magnetic field range than the models described above .",
    "we can see that the j4.20 - 30 models are the most successful at reproducing the line ratios observed in cep e. in particular , these shock models do reproduce the observed [ sii](6717 + 6731)/h@xmath6 and [ s  ii]6731/6717 ratios .",
    "interestingly , these models also predict an h@xmath6/h@xmath79 balmer decrement .",
    "this result seems to favor shock models with a very low shock velocity and high pre - shock density in order to reproduce the observed optical line ratios .",
    "one has to keep in mind that j - type shocks in molecular gas are restricted to velocities @xmath80  km s@xmath9 ( hollenbach & mckee 1989 ) in order to not dissociate h2 , and so at first order the simple j - type atomic / ionic plane parallel shock models are consistent with the rich h2 spectra observed in cep e.    we have estimated a new value for the extinction to cep e using the h@xmath6/h@xmath79 predicted by these models , obtaining @xmath81 ( corresponding to an @xmath82 optical extinction ) .",
    "however , it is important to note that for cep e , only the brightest region of the southern lobe of the h@xmath0 outflow reveals optical emission .",
    "this fact suggests that a high extinction close the outflow region could explain the observed differences between the optical and ir morphologies .",
    "lefloch et al .",
    "( 1996 ) determined values for the optical extinction using observations of the continuum emission of cepheus e outflow at 1.25 mm .",
    "they reported @xmath83 for the northern and southern h@xmath0 lobes , respectively ( on the same bright infrared knots which we analyze in this paper ) .",
    "these values are similar to our first @xmath84 estimation from the recombination cascade balmer decrement for hh377 , in the beginning of this section .",
    "the result implies a similar extinction for both infrared lobes . on the other hand , noriega - crespo et al .",
    "1998 find a constant @xmath85 = 00 s(3)/0 - 0 s(5 ) ratio that also indicates the lack of a steep extinction gradient between the north and south lobes and that the extinction is mostly important around iras 23011 + 6126 .",
    "this is interesting because we know that the south lobe is visible at optical wavelengths ( noriega - crespo 1997 ) , while the north lobe is not .",
    "it would be interesting to obtain extinction values for hh  377 through miller s method .",
    "this would give a realistic value for the fraction of the extinction which arises in the vicinity of the object , and would help to discriminate between and/or to constrain the different shock models .      in order to estimate the ionization fraction in the southern lobe of cep e ( hh  377 ) we use the [ oi]6300/h@xmath6 ratio , which for recombination h@xmath6 is given by @xmath86~6300 } ) \\over i(h\\alpha)}~=~\\it{x}(\\rm{o})~ { \\rm{n(o~i)}/ n(o ) \\over n(h{^+})/ n(h)}~ { \\it{q}_{ex }",

    "the ( 1,0)/(2,1 ) s(1 ) ratios ( 8.50 and 9.40 ) , and the ortho / para ratios ( values @xmath2 ) in both lobes are also consistent with the values observed in collisionally excited objects",

    "the overall extinction along the cep e flow varies drastically .",
    "one could speculate different reasons ( e.g. a large inclination with respect to the plane of the sky , a dense molecular gas core surrounding the source with a rapidly decreasing density profile and/or a non - homogeneous ism ) .",

    "these conditions ( high density , low ionization fraction and strong magnetic field ) are quite appropriate for the development of molecular c - type shock as well .",
    "previous comparisons of the h@xmath0 near - ir spectra with molecular shocks ( ladd & hodapp , 1997 ) , indeed indicated a preference for c - type shocks with @xmath126 .",
