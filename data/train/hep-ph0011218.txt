    "the properties of the hadronic final state can not be calculated directly in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "it is necessary to model the transition from the perturbatively calculable partonic final state to hadrons .",
    "one approach that has been successful in describing the general features of the inclusive energy spectra , in both @xmath0 annihilation and deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) experiments  @xcite , is the modified leading log approximation ( mlla ) .",
    "this uses the local parton hadron duality ( lphd ) approach  @xcite to relate the mlla partonic predictions to the hadronic observables .",
    "the hadronic final state reflects the underlying partonic behaviour . at small values of momentum fraction carried by the outgoing parton from the original hard scatter ,",
    "the parton shower development is dominated by gluon bremsstrahlung .",
    "the partonic properties can be calculated , on average , in the framework of the mlla .",
    "these mlla calculations have two free parameters : a running strong coupling , defined by a qcd scale @xmath1 and an energy cut - off , @xmath2 below which the parton evolution is truncated .",
    "lphd assumes that a simple normalisation factor , which does not explicitly include either the effect of particle masses or resonance decays , can be used to relate the hadronic distributions to the partonic ones . at large enough energies , away from where the parton evolution is truncated , this ` hadronisation ' factor should be approximately independent of the energy scale  @xcite at which the parton spectra are calculated .    in our previous study  @xcite",
    ", various approaches were taken to calculate the single particle spectra and their moments within the mlla framework and compared with @xmath0 data . in this paper",
    "the theoretical results are compared with deep inelastic scattering data in the current region of the breit frame  @xcite .",
    "the event kinematics of dis are determined by the negative square of the four - momentum of the virtual exchanged boson , @xmath3 , and the bjorken scaling variable , @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the four - momentum of the proton . in the quark parton model ( qpm ) ,",
    "the interacting quark from the proton carries four - momentum @xmath6    a natural frame in which to study the dynamics of the hadronic final state in dis is the breit frame  @xcite . in this frame ,",
    "the exchanged virtual boson is completely space - like and has a four - momentum @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the momentum of the proton in the breit frame .",
    "the particles produced in the interaction can be assigned to one of two regions , known as the current and target regions .",
    "the breit frame allows the maximal separation of the incoming and outgoing partons in the qpm .",
    "the current region in the breit frame of dis is analogous to a single hemisphere of @xmath9 annihilation . in the current region ,",
    "the outgoing struck quark from the proton has a momentum @xmath10 the scaled momentum spectra of the particles in the current region , expressed in terms of @xmath11 are expected to have a dependence on @xmath12 similar to that observed in  annihilation  @xcite at energy @xmath13 it should be noted though , that the current region of dis will have a different primary quark flavour composition than @xmath0 annihilation , in particular for heavy quarks .",
    "this paper extends the original zeus analysis by investigating the effect of introducing an effective mass term into the mlla predictions ( see section  [ sec : theory ] . )",
    "in contrast to the previous analysis of @xmath0 data  @xcite this effective mass was treated as an additional free parameter of the theoretical models and was fitted to the data .",
    "given a high - energy parton that fragments via secondary partons into a jet of hadrons , the mlla evolution equation allows the secondary parton spectra for the logarithmic scaled energy , @xmath14 to be calculated  @xcite .",
    "the variable @xmath15 is defined as @xmath16 where @xmath17 for dis ) is the energy of the original parton and @xmath18 is the energy of the secondary parton .",
    "the cut - off , @xmath2 limits the parton energy to @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the transverse energy of the decay products in the jet evolution . in order to reconstruct the @xmath15 distributions",
    "an inverse mellin transformation is performed .",
    "it is convenient to investigate the mlla spectra in terms of moments .",
    "the analytic form of the cumulant moments has been calculated in  @xcite for the first four moments .",
    "this allows the normalised moment , @xmath21 to be calculated and hence the dispersion ( @xmath22 ) , skewness ( @xmath23 ) and the kurtosis ( @xmath24 ) to be constructed , see for example  @xcite    @xmath25    the so - called limiting spectrum  @xcite is the case when @xmath26 the @xmath15 distribution , @xmath27 is dependent on one parameter @xmath28 which is given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is now the only free parameter . for this limiting case , fong and webber",
    "@xcite have also calculated the behaviour of the moments of the @xmath15 spectra with energy scale @xmath31 they point out that the spectra can be represented close to the maximum of the distribution by a distorted gaussian of the form :    @xmath32 \\label{eq : distg}\\ ] ]    where @xmath33 and @xmath34 is the mean .",
    "the differences between the parton spectra for quark ( and gluon ) jets are next - to - mlla effects and have been included in these investigations according to the approximate prescription of dokshitzer et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the mlla limiting spectra predicts that the @xmath35-dependence of @xmath36 should have the form    @xmath37    where @xmath38 is expected to be @xmath39  @xcite .",
    "the mean and peak position , @xmath40 are related , for the skew gaussian used here , by    @xmath41    thus the maximum is a function of several variables .    in the mlla approach",
    "discussed above , the partons are assumed massless so the scaled energy and momentum spectra are identical . experimentally the scaled momentum distribution is usually measured and as the observed hadrons are massive the equivalence of the two spectra no longer holds . in  @xcite",
    "the assumption is made that the cut - off @xmath42 can be related to an effective mass , @xmath43 of the hadrons .",
    "this allows the logarithmic scaled momentum distribution , @xmath44 to be written as    @xmath45    where @xmath46 and the energy of a hadron with a momentum @xmath47 is @xmath48 the limiting momentum spectra based on massless partons or massive partons with the @xmath49 being set to @xmath50 will be referred to as mlla-0 and mlla - m spectra , respectively .",
    "figure  [ fig : logxp ] shows the differential @xmath51 distributions , with statistical errors only , for charged particles in the current fragmentation region of the breit frame for nine @xmath52 values from the zeus experiment  @xcite .",
    "these distributions are approximately gaussian in shape with the mean charged multiplicity given by the integral of the distributions . as @xmath12 increases",
    ", the multiplicity increases and , in addition , the peak of the distribution moves to larger values of @xmath53 the data were fitted to the distorted gaussian of eqn .",
    "[ eq : distg ] over a range of @xmath54 units ( for @xmath55 ) or @xmath56 units ( for @xmath57 ) in @xmath51 around the mean .",
    "this is the range used by the zeus collaboration in their analysis of the data .",
    "the smooth curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : logxp ] result from the fit to the data ; they represent the data well .",
    "the fitted parameters were insensitive to the range of the fit . the @xmath58 values are not quoted here because the measurements are dominated by systematic errors .",
    "the zeus data , solid points , are compared with various mlla curves in figure  [ fig : datamlla ] . for clarity",
    "both the data and theory are normalised to a maximum value of unity .",
    "the theoretical curves ( solid line mlla - m , dotted line mlla-0 ) are calculated for @xmath59 both the mlla-0 and mlla - m describe well the general trend of the data .",
    "in particular , mlla - m describes well the central region of data for @xmath60 there is a trend however , for the mlla - m distribution to be more positively skew than the data ; this is particularly pronounced at low energies .",
    "in contrast , mlla-0 is consistently less skew than the data with the skewness being negative at low @xmath31 mlla - m and mlla-0 converge to similar distributions as @xmath12 increases . at low @xmath12",
    "the data are peaked at lower values of @xmath51 than the theoretical predictions while at high @xmath12 the predictions peak lower than the data .",
    "the histogram is a fit of mlla , in the theoretically allowed region , over the range of data above the horizontal dashed line ( 80% of the data as measured from the maximum of the distributions ) , taking both @xmath30 * and * @xmath49 to be free parameters .",
    "the normalisation of the distribution in each @xmath12 bin was allowed to vary .",
    "the fit gives @xmath61 and @xmath62 again , within the errors , the parameters were insensitive to the region of the fit to the data .",
    "the fitted mlla gives a distribution intermediate between mlla - m and mlla-0 .",
    "the data are well fitted for @xmath60 otherwise , the fit closely follows mlla - m and shows a similar disagreement with the data .    to study further the differences between the mlla predictions and the data , fits of a skew gaussian have been made to the mlla predictions , in a manner similar to the fits made to the data , in order to extract the moments .",
    "figure  [ fig : evol ] shows the first four moments of the @xmath51 spectra as a function of @xmath31 for the zeus data ( solid points ) , the mean and @xmath22 increase as @xmath12 increases , whilst the skewness and kurtosis fall . also shown",
    "are the results from the fits to the mlla - m and mlla-0 spectra , the upper and lower shaded areas respectively . for both mlla-0 and mlla - m",
    "the range fitted lay between 30% of the spectrum ( lower limit of band ) to 80% of the spectrum ( upper limit of band ) .",
    "the upper limit of the fit in @xmath51 was determined by the limit of the mlla spectrum if this were less than the percentage range . in all cases",
    "the skew gaussian describes the theory to better than 0.5% .",
    "there are two points to be noted when making these fits : firstly the fitted parameters of the theory depend on the range of spectrum fitted .",
    "secondly , fitting over a range greater than @xmath63 may mean that the skewness and kurtosis are not those of the distribution because the approximations made in deriving the expression become invalid .",
    "consequently the the fitted parameters should be considered as simply a parameterization of the distributions rather than accurate measures of the skewness and kurtosis .",
    "equally because the @xmath22 and kurtosis are correlated , the measured @xmath22 is fit - range dependent .    for @xmath64",
    "skewness and kurtosis , fig .",
    "[ fig : evol ] , the dis data are bracketed by the mlla - m and mlla-0 predictions as would be expected from the plots of figure  [ fig : datamlla ] .",
    "the skewness predicted by mlla - m is more positive than the data while mlla-0 underestimates the skewness ; for the highest @xmath12 both models approach the data",
    ". there is evidence of a systematic difference in the @xmath12-dependence of the mean between the models and the data for the energy range studied here .",
    "the dotted line shows the moments obtained from a fit to the massive mlla spectrum obtained using the fitted @xmath65 and @xmath66 it is evident that a reasonable description of all moments other than the mean is obtained ; the mean has an energy dependence that differs from that of the data .",
    "the energy dependence of the @xmath51 distribution has been explored further by studying the dependence of the peak position on @xmath31 this has the advantage , in comparison with the moments , that the maximum is relatively insensitive to the function used to parameterize the shape of the @xmath51 distribution .",
    "the @xmath12-dependence of @xmath36 is shown in figure  [ fig : peak ] .",
    "the shaded bands show the maxima derived from mlla-0 and mlla - m . for both cases",
    "the range of fit is from 30% to 80% . as before the dotted line uses the mlla parameters @xmath67 and @xmath68 from the fit .",
    "this plot confirms that the energy dependence of the dis data differs from that of any of the mlla predictions .    a good fit of eqn .",
    "[ eq : maxevol ] to the @xmath36 from the experimental data can be achieved with @xmath69 ( with @xmath70 set to zero ) , which is consistent with the @xmath30 value from the fit to the spectrum .",
    "however the value of @xmath38 is a factor two larger than expected and indicates again an inconsistency of the energy dependence of the data with the expectations of the mlla .",
    "these results are consistent with our previous analysis of @xmath0 data  @xcite .",
    "the hera dis data in the current fragmentation region of the breit frame have been compared to the mlla predictions as a function of @xmath31 in general , the data are well described within the lphd - mlla approach , with the predictions of mlla-0 and mlla - m bracketing the data . with increasing @xmath71 the various predictions of the mlla",
    "converge on the data .",
    "a fit has been made to the data using the massive mlla approach and values of @xmath30 and @xmath49 are found that give a reasonable description of the moments of the @xmath15 distribution .    in detail discrepancies",
    "are found between the theoretical predictions and the data . in particular , a consistent description of the evolution of the peak position of the @xmath15 distribution as a function of scale @xmath12 is not possible ; no energy - independent combination of @xmath30 and @xmath49 is found that can describe the data .",
    "the authors would like to thank valery khoze and wolfgang ochs for discussion and their many useful comments ."
