    "high - energy emission from gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) has been expected and various theoretical possibilities have been discussed by numerous authors ( see e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references there in ) .",
    "in fact , egret detected several grbs with gev emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "recently , the _ fermi _ satellite was launched and the onboard large area telescope ( lat ) is widely expected to detect high - energy ( @xmath0 gev ) emission from a fraction of grbs .",
    "in addition , other space- and ground - based gamma - ray observatories such as agile , magic , veritas and hess also regard grbs as one of the main scientific targets .",
    "theoretically there are the two main classes as high - energy emission mechanisms , i.e. , leptonic and hadronic mechanisms .",
    "the leptonic mechanisms include synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) emission and external inverse - compton emission , which are the most discussed scenarios for both the prompt and the afterglow emission components .",
    "high - energy ssc emission is produced by relativistic electrons that radiate seed synchrotron photons ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , there are various possibilities for external inverse - compton emission . for example , prompt gamma - ray photons or the x - ray flare photons may act as seed photons for the relativistic electrons accelerated during the afterglow phase in the external shocks ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "the hadronic mechanisms include synchrotron radiation of high - energy baryons , synchrotron radiation of the secondary leptons generated in photohadronic interactions , as well as the photons directly produced from @xmath4 decays . in order to see the baryon synchrotron radiation ,",
    "sufficiently strong magnetic fields are typically required ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . otherwise , photohadronic components would dominate over the baryon synchrotron component as long as the photon density is high enough .",
    "hadronic gamma rays can be observed only when the nonthermal baryon loading is large enough ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "so far , both emission mechanisms have been widely considered in the standard scenario ( see reviews , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , i.e. , the internal shock model for the prompt emission and the external shock model for the afterglow emission , respectively .",
    "both mechanisms can in principle produce @xmath5 tev photons , although high - energy photons may not escape from the source due to two - photon pair production , especially during the prompt emission phase @xcite . even if such super - tev photons can escape from the source , they still suffer from pair creation due to the interaction with the cosmic infrared background ( cib ) or the cosmic microwave background ( cmb )",
    ". in particular , the direct detection of tev photons would be difficult for grbs with redshift @xmath6 .",
    "on the other hand , the electron - positron pairs resulting from the pair creation are still energetic , so that they up - scatter numerous cmb photons via the inverse - compton process .",
    "such secondary photons are able to reach the observer in a longer duration than the duration of primary emission , and a significant fraction of them may be observed with a time delay due to several effects such as magnetic deflection and angular spreading .",
    "therefore , this emission is called `` pair echo '' emission , with a typical energy in the range of @xmath7  gev .",
    "this pair echo emission is not only indirect evidence of the intrinsic tev emission but also a clue to probe the weak intergalactic magnetic field ( igmf ) of @xmath8 g @xcite .",
    "the plaga s method is hitherto the only one to probe very weak magnetic fields of @xmath8 g. other methods utilizing faraday rotation or cosmic microwave background are sensitive to magnetic fields of order @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the presence of very weak igmfs has been predicted by several mechanisms , such as inflation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , reionization ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and density fluctuations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "observations of igmfs in voids would give important information on the origin of the galactic magnetic fields @xcite , although they may be contaminated by astrophysical sources such as galactic winds or quasar outflows @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we reinvestigate the observational effects of the possible pair echo emission of grb high - energy emission in the afterglow phase .",
    "three criteria should be satisfied to detect pair echo emission : ( 1 ) the object must emit @xmath1 tev gamma rays leading to pair echoes ; ( 2 ) the pair echo flux must be higher than the detector s flux sensitivity ; and ( 3 ) the pair echo emission component must not be masked by other emission components .",
    "concerning the point ( 1 ) , tev photons from grbs can be emitted during both the prompt and the afterglow phases .",
    "here we consider both as the primary emission components for the echoes , by acknowledging that during the prompt phase strong tev gamma rays are expected only for a small fraction of grbs due to the large @xmath10 optical depth , as has been studied by various authors @xcite .",
    "concerning the point ( 2 ) , we need to evaluate the pair echo flux quantitatively .",
    "this flux depends on the amount of the cib photons , the igmf strength , and the source distance . as for the cib",
    ", we use the acceptable cib models given by kneiske et al .",
    "( 2002 , 2004 ) . in order to take into account of the effects of the igmf properly ,",
    "we adopt the formulation developed by ichiki et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , which enables us to calculate the time - dependent spectra better than the previous works @xcite .",
    "in addition , we have also taken into account up - scatterings of the cib photons as well as the cmb photons .",
    "this effect was neglected in the previous work for simplicity @xcite , but it can be also important @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we focus on the detectability of the _ fermi _ lat , which is the most suitable one for our purpose , but also touch upon the capabilities of other ground based tev detectors such as magic and veritas . concerning the point ( 3 ) ,",
    "we pay special attention to the high - energy afterglow emission , which is the main competitor of the pair echoes , and compare the its strengths with respect to the echo components . such a comparison was not done for previous researchers who studied the pair echo . at present , a detailed comparison between the pair echoes and high - energy afterglows is highly uncertain , as both have never been clearly detected . since various predictions of",
    "high - energy emission rely on many model assumptions , they should be tested by observations of _ fermi _ , magic , veritas and other detectors . despite of these uncertainties",
    ", we think it would be interesting and important to study effects of pair echoes that can affect high - energy emission , especially in the late phase @xcite .",
    "for a typical long - duration grb , prompt gamma - ray emission is observed in a duration of @xmath11 s. the typical isotropic energy is around @xmath12 .",
    "the observed specific flux spectrum is well approximated by a broken power - law , @xmath13 for @xmath14 and @xmath15 for @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the break energy which is typically @xmath18 kev . @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the low- and high - energy photon indices , respectively . in this work , we extrapolate this spectrum to higher energies and adopt @xmath21 for @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the intrisic cutoff energy which is typically determined by the opacity of pair production .",
    "whether tev gamma rays can escape from the source strongly depends on the lorentz factor and the emission radius .",
    "only when these quantities are large , do we expect tev gamma rays escaping from the source , i.e. , @xmath24 tev .",
    "notice that although the ssc or possible hadronic mechanism leads to more complicated spectra ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , this simplification is sufficient for calculating the pair echo ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the pair echo is a kind of regenerated processes , which is composed of up - scattered cmb and cib photons .",
    "the resulting pair echo spectrum sensitively depends on the intrinsic cutoff energy , while it is not so sensitive to source electron spectral indices of @xmath25 for a given @xmath26 @xcite . when the intrinsic cutoff energy is low enough ,",
    "the resulting spectrum basically reflects the seed cmb and cib spectra , the inverse - compton spectrum is expected as @xmath27 below the peak .",
    "however , the pair spectrum is strongly affected by the cib field , and is proportional to @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the optical depth of photons with @xmath30 emitted at the redshift @xmath31 . since the pair echo spectrum is rather sensitive to the igmf and the cib spectrum , it is not easy to know a source electron spectral index @xmath32 . ] , which roughly leads to the spectral peak of @xmath33 . here , @xmath34 k is the local cmb temperature . on the other hand ,",
    "when the intrinsic cutoff energy is high enough , high - energy secondary photons are re - absorbed , and the resulting spectrum has the cutoff due to cmb / cib absorption . as the intrinsic cutoff energy is higher , the cascade effect becomes more and more significant , i.e. , repeating the pair creation and inverse - compton scattering is important .",
    "it affects the resulting spectrum , erasing the memory of the primary spectrum in the high energies .",
    "rather , the radiation energy output above tev is important for the pair echo flux , and we normalize the primary flux through the isotropic radiation energy above 0.1 tev , @xmath35 .    the prompt emission is followed by the afterglow phase , during which the relativistic ejecta is decelerated by a circumburst medium",
    ". a pair of external shocks ( forward and reverse ) form , from which electrons ( and possibly baryons ) are accelerated and radiate afterglow photons .",
    "high - energy emission during this phase was predicted by many authors in both of the reverse and forward shock models .",
    "( see * ? ? ? * and references there in ) .",
    "tev emission in the external shocks has a smaller optical depth for pair production , and hence , can escape the source more easily .",

    "is evaluated as @xmath57 by which we can normalize the ssc spectrum .",
    "the above temporal behavior is typically valid from the break time of @xmath58 s to the next break time of @xmath59 s during the so - called normal decay phase of x - ray afterglow .",
    "afterglow light curves of some grbs are steepened after @xmath60 , which is often interpreted as a jet break when the lorentz factor @xmath61 becomes the inverse of the jet opening angle @xmath62 ( rhoads 1999 ; sari et al .",

    "therefore , it may typically be difficult for pair echoes to explain gev emission whose time scale is shorter ( e.g. , grb 081024b and see also discussions in zou , fan , & piran 2008 ) , but they may also generate the high - energy extended emission .    for non - detections , one may obtain a constraint as @xmath157 } > { 10}^{-21.5}~{\\rm g}~{\\rm mpc}^{1/2},\\ ] ] for our optimistic prompt parameters .",
    "we need to observe primary tev emission for this purpose , but it is more difficult to make follow - up observations for short grbs with magic and veritas , compared to long grbs . note that significant and non - tentative tev signals have not been observed so far for both of the long and short grbs @xcite . this may be because a part of grbs can be tev emitters due to the small optical thickness for pair creation and tev photons from distant sources are significantly attenuated by the cib .",
    "in this paper , we have calculated the time - dependent spectra of the secondary pair echoes from the grb prompt and afterglow tev emission components that are attenuated by the cib , applying a recently developed formalism to properly describe the temporal evolution of the pair echoes .",
    "we have compared the flux of the pair echoes to that of the afterglow , taking into account up - scattering of the cib photons . in particular , we have demonstrated ( 1 ) that afterglow - induced pair echoes can be important after the jet break for long grbs with a canonical afterglow ; and ( 2 ) that prompt - induced pair echoes may also outshine the afterglow emission , if the prompt tev emission is intense , typically with @xmath158 .",
    "weak but non - zero igmfs can be crucial for detectability , since they make the duration of the pair echo emission much longer than the time scale of primary emission ( see figs . 2 , 4 , 6 , and 8) .",
    "although the detectability itself also depends on both of the spectral evolution of the primary emission and detector sensitivities , such non - zero igmfs can make it easier to detect secondary photons at late times when the pair echo emission remains shallow compared to the afterglow emission .",
    "concerning with the detection of pair echo signals ,  naked \" ( short ) grbs without a significant afterglow emission could be more promising .",
    "the pair echo should be observed as extended emission with the time scale of @xmath159 s. the observational prospects of such pair echoes are quite interesting for the recently launched _",
    "successful detections may be possible for nearby , bright events , and would open a new window to study the poorly unknown igmf . even in the case of non - detections ,",
    "lower limits on the igmf of @xmath160 }   \\sim { 10}^{-20}-{10}^{-21}~{\\rm g}~{\\rm mpc}^{1/2}$ ] may be obtained .",
    "the main caveat in hunting afterglow - induced pair echoes and pair echoes from short grbs is that nearby bright grbs do not seem frequent .",
    "although there is large uncertainty on the nearby burst rate , the rate of bursts occurring within @xmath161 is estimated as @xmath1 a few events per year ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the actual detection rate also depends on several factors such as the detector sensitivity and field of view ( e.g. , @xmath162 sr for the _ fermi_/lat detector ) , so that only a fraction of them would be detected .",
    "if all the bursts are ideal tev emitters , we can expect pair echoes for these bursts in the near future .",
    "however , it is unlikely that all the bursts are bright tev emitters ( and it seems more plausible for prompt emission due to significant attenuation by the pair creation ) .",
    "although it is currently impossible to predict how many bursts can be bright tev emitters in both the prompt and afterglow phases , the expected detection rate for @xmath163 bursts would be  at most \" @xmath164 events per year .",
    "there may be further complications about nearby grbs .",
    "some of the nearby long bursts detected so far seem somewhat dimmer than classical grbs occurring at @xmath6 , but their local rate may be higher than the estimated local rate of classical grbs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "hence , we may have more nearby bursts that can be detected in the kev - mev band by detectors with better sensitivities ( e.g. , _ exist _ ) .",
    "but , since the typical luminosity of such low luminosity bursts seems small , it is not so easy to see pair echoes from them .",
    "in addition , energetic short grbs assumed in figs .",
    "9 and 10 would also be rare , whose radiation energy is larger than the typical one ( @xmath165 ergs ) . nevertheless , possible detections of pair echoes would bring us a big impact in understanding grb physics and igmf , even though the bright tev grbs that can lead to such detections are rare",
    "the current on - orbit _ fermi _ satellite is suitable for such a purpose .",
    "magic and veritas can also provide valuable data via follow - up observations , since the pair echo emission can last for a long duration of time . in the near future",
    ", some constraints on the models may be achieved even for non - detections .",
    "we must also beware of the uncertainties in the intrinsic primary spectra since the pair echo flux depends on the amount of tev photons . as for afterglow emission",
    ", we only consider the conventional forward shock model with energy injection .",
    "although other parameter sets or other models such as the varying @xmath38 model can be considered , we expect that the qualitative features of the pair echoes themselves will not be changed significantly , as long as the light curve of high - energy emission is similar to that of x - rays and the amount of tev photons is not too different from that invoked in our case .",
    "as for the prompt emission , possible uncertainties may come from the intrinsic emission properties such as @xmath26 , as discussed in murase et al .",
    "( 2007 ) .",
    "the contamination by other high - energy emission components might complicate the picture further .",
    "there are many possibilities of high - energy gamma ray emission during the afterglow phase ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "for example , high - energy emissions associated with x - ray flares are expected at @xmath1 gev energies .",
    "gev photons can be produced by both of the leptonic mechanisms ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the hadronic mechanisms @xcite . in addition , the reverse shock electrons can also provide high - energy photons during the early afterglow phase .",
    "nonetheless , it is in principle possible to distinguish the pair echo emission from other possibilities , given an ideal broad - band ( optical , x - ray , mev and gev ) observational campaign .",
