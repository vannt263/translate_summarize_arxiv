    "_ showed that a transition from an extended to a localized states in the square lattice can occur at a disorder strength of 5 or 6 times higher than the band width of the anderson model hamiltonian @xcite . in 1979 ,",
    "conjectured , based on a scaling hypothesis , that the electronic states are localized in less than three dimensional ( 3d ) systems in the presence of any amount of disorder @xcite .",
    "the scaling hypothesis was later on supported by many studies of the anderson model on square lattices @xcite .",
    "further , altshuler _ et al .",
    "_ showed that weak electron interaction enhances the localization in these systems , whereas under strong electron interaction , 2d electrons behave like a wigner crystal and , as shown by tanatar _",
    "@xcite , even a small amount of disorder can make the system insulating at zero temperature .",
    "the theoretical analysis @xcite suggested that under strong electron interactions and small disordered regime , 2d systems can be conducting .",
    "most of these studies are done for infinite systems and square lattices , except some of the recent studies on the honeycomb lattices @xcite .",
    "a detailed review on the anderson transition is given in the ref .  .",
    "the study of anderson transition is not only important for material sciences but also relevant to understand the influence of the wavefunction dynamics on the physical properties of the disordered systems .",
    "the presence of disorder and/or interaction leads to a randomization of the hamiltonian , resulting in a random matrix representation in a physically suitable basis e.g. , site basis . the structure of the matrix e.g. , degree of sparsity is sensitive to various system conditions viz . ,",
    "dimensionality , shape , size , and boundary conditions .",
    "the statistical behaviour of the system can therefore be analysed by an ensemble of the disordered hamiltonians .",
    "such analysis has been a subject of extensive study during the past decade .",
    "it is now well - known that , in the weak disorder regime , the statistics can be well - modelled by the wigner - dyson universality classes of random matrix ensembles which correspond to extended , featureless eigenfunctions and a strong level - repulsion with statistics of the eigenvalues and the eigenfunction independent from each other .",
    "increasing the disorder in finite size systems causes the statistics to crossover from wigner - dyson to the poisson universality class ( with no level - repulsion and fully localized eigenfunctions in strong disorder limit ) .",
    "the statistics in the intermediate regime e.g. , near critical disorder is sensitive to the degree of eigenfunction localization which in turn is expected to depend on the system conditions besides disorder .",
    "the study @xcite however , showed that the statistics can be well - modeled by the single parametric power - law random banded matrix ( prbm ) ensembles .",
    "another theoretical study @xcite later on indicated the application of a wide range of random matrix ensembles ( besides prbm ) as the model for the intermediate statistics ; this study was based on the common mathematical formulation of the energy level statistics of a broad class of random matrix ensembles ( with varying degree of sparsity and disorder but same symmetry class ) .",
    "the formulation is governed by a single parameter , referred as the complexity parameter , a function of all system parameters including energy range of interest and therefore different ensembles are expected to show analogous statistics if their complexity parameters are same @xcite . as the theoretical claim about the existence of a complexity parameter is in clear agreement with the single parameter scaling conjecture of ref .  , it is highly desirable to seek its numerical validity in disordered systems .",

    "[ fig : lattices ] , we consider four lattice geometries , namely , square , triangular , honeycomb and kagom lattice which differ from each other in the coordination number and their bond connectivity .",
    "the coordination numbers of honeycomb , square , kagom and triangular , lattice are three , four , four , and six respectively .",
    "we note that the square and the kagom both have four nearest neighbour but their spectrum is completely different because of the bond connectivity .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sect2 ]",
    ", we introduce the model disordered hamiltonian ; here the theory leading to single parameter based formulation of the spectral statistics is also briefly reviewed . the section  [ sec : fluc ] briefly describes the statistical measures used in our numerical analysis .",
    "the section  [ sec : res ] presents the details of the numerical techniques as well as results ; this section is divided into four sub - sections one for each lattice system .",
    "the comparison of the statistics of physical parameters with respect to the single complexity parameter for various lattices is given in section  [ sect5 ] . in section  [ sect6 ] ,",
    "results are discussed and compared with the existing literature .",
    "_ the hamiltonian _ : we consider the standard anderson model @xcite under tight binding approximation realized on four different 2d lattice systems .",
    "the tight binding model hamiltonian is well suited for a metallic system , where electron - electron interactions are screened .",
    "the hamiltonian can be written in a single particle basis as @xmath0 where @xmath1 , and @xmath2 are random site energies and the nearest neighbour hopping energies . in this work ,",
    "the sites energies are considered gaussian distributed for each lattice system and the hopping energies are kept constant : @xmath3 .",
    "the gaussian type site disorder has been widely studied for the square lattice system and has a close analogy with real thin film materials .    _ the ensemble _ : the presence of the disorder in the system makes it inevitable to consider an ensemble of the hamiltonians . for the hamiltonian in eq.([eq : ham - def ] ) with on - site random energies , the probability density @xmath4 of the ensemble including all possibilities can be written in general as @xmath5    \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\times \\prod_{k , l ; k\\not = l } \\delta(h_{kl } -f_{kl } ) , \\label{bde1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the normalization constant , @xmath7 if @xmath8 correspond to nearest neighbour sites and otherwise @xmath9 .",

    "the statistical behavior of the hamiltonian @xmath20 , eq.([eq : ham - def ] ) , can now be analyzed using the ensemble ( [ eq : rho ] ) .",
    "an important aspect of eq.([eq : rho ] ) is that it can represent the ensemble density for a wider class of lattice systems under different conditions e.g. , random , anisotropic , variable range hopping , dimensionality and boundary conditions ; the only constraint on these system is to preserve the time - reversal symmetry which allows @xmath20 to be real - symmetric .",
    "its form is therefore appropriate for the verification of single parameter scaling conjecture .    _",
    "single parameter formulation _ : before proceeding to numerical analysis , it is helpful to briefly review the complexity parametric formulation of the spectral statistics .",

    ". the distribution for the intermediate states of localization can be derived by integrating @xmath41 over the associated eigenvector space . as shown in ref .",

    "the statistics other than mean level density is therefore governed by a rescaled parameter @xmath51 : @xmath52 the solution of eq.([diff - eig ] ) at @xmath53 corresponds to the wigner - dyson statistics .",
    "the @xmath54 limit correspond to the distribution at the initial state of the evolution ; for an insulator initial state , the spectral statistics reduces to the statistics of uncorrelated energy levels .",
    "the transition parameter @xmath55 is in general a function of various parameters e.g. , disorder , system size , dimensionality , energy range of interest , lattice topology .",
    "although both @xmath43 and @xmath46 contribute to the system dependence of @xmath55 , the crucial influence comes from @xmath46 due to its dependence on the localization length @xmath48 . for finite",
    "system sizes @xmath56 , a variation of system conditions e.g. , disorder leads to a smooth crossover of statistics between the stationary limits @xmath54 and @xmath57 .",
    "in infinite size limit , the statistics abruptly changes from one stationary limit to the other . if however , the limit @xmath58 exists , the corresponding statistics would belong to a universality class different from the two stationary limits .",
    "the existence of @xmath59 therefore is a criteria for the existence of critical spectral statistics @xcite .",
    "our main objectives in this paper is to study the influence of the system conditions on the statistical behavior and identify the critical regime . for this purpose ,",
    "we consider four different fluctuation measures namely , density of states ( dos ) , reduced partition number ( @xmath60 ) , the peak position of the nnsd and the dc electrical conductivity which can briefly be described as follows .    _ spectral measures _ : a well - known measure to analyse the short range correlations among energy levels is the nearest neighbour spacing distribution ( nnsd ) which describes the probability @xmath61 of two nearest neighbour energy levels to be found at a distance @xmath62 measured in the units of the mean level spacing around the desired energy regime .",

    "while nnsd gives the short range correlations of the energy levels , there is another measure which gives the long range correlations , namely , the number variance .",
    "it is defined as the variance of the number @xmath73 of unfolded energy levels in an energy interval @xmath74 centered at the energy regime of interest i.e. , the number variance @xmath75 .",
    "_ participation number _ : the dependence of @xmath55 on the localization length @xmath48 through @xmath46 results in sensitivity of the energy level statistics to eigenfunction behaviour .",

    "it is necessary to first rescale the energy eigenvalues by the local mean level spacing @xcite ( also known as _ unfolding _ of the levels ) .",
