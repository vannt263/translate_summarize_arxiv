    "since the famous thought experiment by schrdinger @xcite , macroscopic superpositions have been a part of quantum folklore that have annoyed specialists of the field .",
    "schrdinger considered a cat that was sealed into a steel chamber with a diabolic device that consists of a small amount of radioactive material and a geiger counter that was attached to a hammer device .",
    "if one radioactive nucleus would decay , then the geiger counter would trigger the hammer device , and the hammer device would scrap a small bottle of prussic acid which kills the cat . if the problem is studied strictly quantum mechanically , from outside the steel chamber , one finds that after a while the cat would be in a superposition state of alive and dead .",
    "if the cat would be in the statistical mixture of being alive or dead , the situation would not differ much from , e.g. , tossing a coin with the probability of 0.5 for heads or tails . in a classical model",
    ", we do not yet _ know _ the outcome , but the state of the cat ( coin ) _ is _ either alive or dead ( heads or tails ) , even before the measurement .",
    "the quantum cat ( coin ) behaves differently , with laws that allow superpositions between the outcome alive and outcome dead ( heads and tails ) .",
    "hence , rather than certain alive or certain dead ( heads or tails ) before the measurement , there must be quantum correlations between the the two outcomes .    for schrdinger ,",
    "the reason for putting the cat in the experimental spotlight was obvious .",
    "the absurd outcome of the experiment illustrated that , if the outcome was a result of treating everything  including the cat ",
    "strictly quantum mechanically , something was wrong , if not in the theory itself , then at least in the understanding quantum mechanics .",
    "as previous decoherence studies have shown @xcite , one should be wary of too many oversimplifications and approximations .",
    "the environment of the cat should also be modelled , not only a point - like cat in a vacuum .",
    "the interaction between the cat and the environment induces decoherence that damps quantum correlations out of the cat , resulting in a classical statistical mixture of living and dead cat . in other words ,",
    "the cat is too macroscopic to be in a superposition state .",
    "but what , then , is the upper limit of macroscopicity for a superposition state ?",
    "recent studies @xcite have pointed out that the macroscopicity question can perhaps be addressed with bose - einstein condensates .",
    "references @xcite consider superpositions of two - component atomic condensates , while dynamical creation of a macroscopic superposition between atomic and molecular condensates via photoassociation @xcite or feshbach resonance @xcite has also been studied .",
    "the work herein is a follow - up study of @xcite , one that includes dissociative damping of quantum correlations .",
    "in particular , we consider a macroscopic atom - molecule superposition created in a two step process : first , a joint atom - molecule condensate is created from an initial atomic condensate with strong photoassociation ( compared to the s - wave collisional interaction ) ; second , the photoassociation coupling is reduced , and a macroscopic atom - molecule superposition is created via strong s - wave collisions ; observation is based on a rabi - like oscillation of the system between the initial joint atom - molecule condensate and the corresponding macroscopic superposition . here",
    "the main concern is to determine whether or not dissociative decoherence prohibits the photoassociative formation of a macroscopic atom - molecule superposition .",
    "photoassociation occurs when two atoms absorb a photon , thereby jumping from the two - atom continuum to a bound molecular state @xcite . for initially quantum - degenerate atoms",
    ", there is an analogy in nonlinear optics : photoassociation is formally identical to second - harmonic generated photons @xcite , while s - wave collisions between the particles correspond to amplitude dispersion @xcite ; in each case , the inherent non - linearity entangles the particles , and potentially leads to macroscopic superpositions . in photoassociation , however , the molecular state is excited and may spontaneously decay to molecular levels outside the system ; also , the molecule may dissociate either back to the atomic condensate , or to a pair of noncondensate atoms of equal and opposite momentum via rogue @xcite , i.e. , unwanted @xcite , photodissociation .",
    "these problems can be overcome by coupling the excited molecular state with a stable molecular state using a second laser . in this two - color photoassociation ,",
    "the population loss via the excited molecular state can be made small by applying suitably large intermediate detunings .",
    "nevertheless , decay of the quantum coherence is still possible , even if the populations are unaffected , and it is this possibility that warrents an invstigation of rogue dissociation in macroscopic atom - molecule superpositions .    the possible creation of a macroscopic atom - molecule superposition using photoassociation was reported in calsamiglia et  al .  @xcite .",
    "although lacking decoherence effects , the results were promising and , moreover , ref .",
    "@xcite is an interesting starting point for our study for several other reasons : the possibility of a superposition of atom - molecule condensates is tempting in itself , since atoms and molecules are different objects ; the whole dynamical process of creating the superposition state can be modelled ; the dissociation environment can be modelled in a straightforward manner . in ref .",
    "@xcite the dynamical approach has been used but , instead of photoassociation , the macroscopic superposition state was created with the help of a magnetic field and feshbach resonance .",
    "the main source of decoherence was the laser - field induced interaction between atoms and the electromagnetic vacuum ; however , the role of decoherence due to the coupling between magnetic field modes and the condensate is unclear .",
    "also , the study of ref .",
    "@xcite considers the case of superposition very loosely .",
    "one can not prove that the state is a superposition state by using probability distributions only .",
    "of course , the possibility of a rabi - like oscillations to and from the macroscopic superposition @xcite , on which observation is based , is more likely in the presence of quantum coherence ; but , close revivals may also occur for nearly statistical mixtures . in all rigor ,",
    "a detailed study of superposition states should include the off - diagonal elements of the density matrix , including the possibility of dissociative decoherence .",
    "hence , we focus on decoherence due to the second order term of the master equation for the condensate modes in the perturbation theory ( anomalous quantum correlations induced by the first order term have been discussed elsewhere @xcite ) .",
    "our results are roughly summarized as follows . in general",
    ", the decoherence timescale @xmath2 should be longer than the particular interaction timescale @xmath3 , and thus macroscopic superpositions are possible only if the condition @xmath4 is fulfilled .",
    "our scheme is divided into two phases in which different interactions are dominant . in phase @xmath5 , we use photoassociation that is strong compared to collisions to drive the initial atomic condensate into a particular joint atom - molecule which serves as an initial state for the superposition engineering .",
    "thus , the time scale @xmath3 is the photoassociation timescale . in phase @xmath6 ,",
    "the intensity of photoassociation laser is turned down , and dominant collisions between condensate particles drive the system into a macroscopic atom - molecule superposition .",
    "the interaction timescale is then the collision timescale . with the given simulation parameters we can express the coherence condition as @xmath7(2n^2 + 2n+1 ) } , \\label{xid}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 , @xmath9",
    ", @xmath10 is the density and @xmath11 the number of particles in the thermal cloud . the",
    "interesting fact is that the condition  ( [ xid ] ) does not depend on the number of particles in the initial condensate , @xmath12 : with the chosen theoretical setup and parameter values , the photoassociation interaction , the collision interaction , and the coupling between molecular condensate and noncondensate modes depend similarly on @xmath12 ; thus , we find that simulations for @xmath13 condensate are applicable to more realistic @xmath14 condensates .",
    "with values @xmath15 and @xmath16 we have @xmath17 , and the macroscopic atom - molecule superposition will experience a considerable decay of off - diagonal elements .",
    "the best chance of avoiding rogue decoherence when creating a macroscopic atom - molecule superposition is for @xmath18 and @xmath19nk , which gives @xmath20 , but which is just out of reach of present ultracold technology  @xcite .",

    "again , recall the decoherence conditions : @xmath151 , @xmath170 ; @xmath153 , @xmath156 and @xmath157 ; @xmath158 @xmath169 ; and @xmath160 , @xmath163 and @xmath164.,width=302 ]     the density matrices of scenarios @xmath151  ( a , no damping ) , @xmath153  ( b , moderate damping ) , @xmath158  ( c , strong damping ) and @xmath160  ( d , weak damping ) at @xmath166 , when a macroscopic superposition state should emerge . only a small fraction of off - diagonal elements have survived from decoherence , even in the scenario @xmath160 , that has extreme parameter values of @xmath171 and @xmath172 . again , recall the decoherence conditions : @xmath151 , @xmath170 ; @xmath153 , @xmath156 and @xmath157 ; @xmath158 @xmath169 ; and @xmath160 , @xmath163 and @xmath164.,width=302 ]    overall , while decoherence is strong enough , the quantum correlations are damped out and sharp peaks in probability distributions smoothen .",
    "the decay of off - diagonal elements seems to be considerable also in the regime of moderate decoherence @xmath173 .",
    "strong decoherence effects @xmath174 would be even faster . in order to get a macroscopic superposition with the given setup",
    ", one should be safely in the regime of weak decoherence , i.e. , @xmath175 .",
    "however , the regime is not reachable using parameter values consistent with present - day technology .",
    "of course , there are a few possibilities to improve the result and get @xmath175 .",
    "first , one can reduce the density @xmath10 , but @xmath176 is somewhat rarified as it is , even for a condensate , and achieving @xmath177 could present challenges .",
    "the second possibility is to enter the non - markovian regime , which could considerably improve the @xmath178 at least in phase @xmath5 ; however , the non - markovian case will be studied elsewhere .",
    "other tricks are related to manipulating the interaction or the environment .",
    "the symmetrization of the environment @xcite would be a hard , maybe impossible , task to apply here due to the inherent nonlinearity ; but , creating specially a correlated environment might help since an uncorrelated heat bath is quite a harsh environment for coherence phenomena .",
    "finally , we note that the observation of the possible superposition state could present a problem .",
    "the assumption that the coherence of the state after phase @xmath5 can be verified , and thus one only needs to consider the density matrix profiles of the revival of this initial state after the superposition state @xcite , is perhaps too simple , at least in the markovian regime .",
    "while the system is driven from superposition to the revived state , rogue dissociation is still damping coherence out of the system .",
    "also , coherent tricks , such as phase - imprinting the revived state , would need extra time , and this introduces more decoherence . the best candidate for observing the macroscopic superposition",
    "is probably to try to entangle the superposition state with another system , and then to apply bell - type correlation experiments .",
    "the important point is that our approach is a dynamical one in which we _ make the macroscopic superposition in the presence of the decoherence _ , which differs from the standard way in which one takes the macroscopic superposition for granted and then puts it into a decoherent environment and looks how long it would last there .",
    "such studies do not make claims whether it is possible to create a macroscopic superposition or not , but they only make claims whether the initially prepared macroscopic superposition can be observed or not . therefore , our photoassociation - based approach suggests a possible experimental _ creation _ of the macroscopic superposition in a decohering environment .    hence , the aim of this study is to understand the effects of the rogue - dissociation - induced decoherence while trying to create a macroscopic superposition of bose - condensed atoms and molecules . in particular , ours is a two - stage scheme : in the first stage , the photoassociation coupling is strong compared to the s - wave collisional coupling , and a specific joint atom - molecule condensate is created ; in the second stage , the photoassociation coupling is turned down such that it is weak compared to the collisional coupling , and the system evolves into a macroscopic atom - molecule superposition .",
    "there is a constraint @xmath179 , which should be satisfied in order to get a macroscopic superposition of atoms and molecules .",
    "the dependency on relevant system parameters of the constraint @xmath178 was calculated in both stages of our theoretical setup .",
    "an interesting fact is that , for the given parameter ratios , @xmath178 does not depend on the number of particles in condensate @xmath12 .",
    "results for a modest , say , @xmath13 particle superposition state will therefore apply to a @xmath180 particle superposition state with the same density , given properly scaled laser frequencies and intensities .",
    "using @xmath178 one can easily , without heavy simulations , consider whether the macroscopic superposition state of atoms and molecules is within reach or not with given experimental setup parameters .    without any tricks ,",
    "the best chance to defeat rogue decoherence in creating an atom - molecule superposition corresponds to a density @xmath181 and temperature @xmath182 .",
    "nevethless , while this temperature may be accessible by making the trap shallow , the off - diagonal elements of density matrix will still experience considerable decay .",
    "one way to get better macroscopic superpositions in the present scheme is to challenge the assumptions or approximations of our study or , in other words , engineer the environment .",
    "we assumed that the environment is an uncorrelated heat bath , the system parameter values should be in the regime where markov approximation is valid , the environment particles are free and the environment is infinite . indeed , it may well prove interesting to examine the non - markovian regime , where a greater part of the physically - relevant parameter space is available , and/or to use a specially correlated environment .",
    "rogue dissociation is an important source of decoherence that should not be neglected in coherence studies of atom - molecule bose - einstein condensates .",
    "unfortunately , it seems to push coherent atom - molecule engineering ( macroscopic superpositions , quantum computation , etc . )",
    "one step further away from realization .",
