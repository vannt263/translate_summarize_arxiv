    "to date , the standard model ( sm ) has proven to be a very predictive and successful model of particle physics .",
    "however , there is no reason why the sm should only have three generations , and therefore examining the sm extended with additional generations is a worthwhile effort .",
    "phenomenological studies of the fourth generations quarks abound in the literature .",
    "the atlas collaboration @xcite excludes the bottom - like fourth generation quark @xmath1 with @xmath2 , and the top - like quark @xmath3 of @xmath4 .",
    "the fourth generation quarks enhance the higg - gluon - gluon fusion rate via loop contributions , and therefore the higgs production cross section is increased by a factor of nine .",

    "as it can be clearly seen , the fourth generation neutrino is expected to be much heavier than the sm neutrinos .",
    "the extreme hierarchy between the sm neutrinos and the fourth generation neutrino is rather puzzling .",
    "a split mass generation mechanism can explain the hierarchy in neutrino masses .",
    "the sm neutrinos could acquire mass through radiative corrections while the fourth generation neutrino acquires a tree level dirac and majorana mass contributions through its yukawa coupling with a fermion singlet , as shown in @xcite .",
    "however , a five generation model was necessary in order to obtain the @xmath9 as proven by the solar and atmospheric neutrino experiments .    in the light of the existing tensions in the fourth generation models",

    "presently , we have shown a model in which sm neutrinos derive naturally small neutrino masses while the fourth generation neutrino can obtain a large mass .",
    "however , it may seem strange that the heavy fourth generation quarks and the fourth generation neutrinos obtain their large masses from the same higgs doublet as do other sm particles .",

    "re - exploring the parameter space of scalar dm with the addition of three singlet fermions is a worthwhile endeavor though outside the scope of this paper .",
    "as mentioned before , assuming a fourth generation model , the sm - like model higgs is ruled out in the region @xmath62 at 95% c.l . the most recent result from the lhc @xcite suggests signals for the higgs boson around@xmath63 in the @xmath64 channel . in fourth generation models",
    "@xmath65 rate is suppressed even as @xmath66 rate is enhanced .",
    "fourth generation models might still be compatible @xcite if one considered signals from the @xmath67 channel only .",
    "however , the absence of an excess in the @xmath68 channel makes this observation somewhat mute , and if we must decide on a viable model of fourth generations , it will mostly likely demand an extended scalar sector or a sm higgs with a significant invisible width .",
    "there are a variety of ways explored in the literature in which the tension between collider data and fourth generation quarks can be reduced .",
    "scalar color octets modifies the coupling between the quarks and the higgs thereby reducing the production cross section @xcite .",
    "the gluon fusion rate can also be modified in the presence of vector - like fourth generation quarks @xcite .",
    "the exclusion can be evaded for a light higgs if the higgs has a significant invisible width .",
    "for example , if the higgs decays into a light fourth generation majorana neutrino , @xcite showed that higgs can still be allowed in @xmath69 .",
    "a similar result also occurs in a two higgs model with an inert doublet . in this case",
    "higgs could decay into a light inert scalar .",
    "the authors of @xcite show that the @xmath70 is still a viable window for a fourth generation model .",
    "the inert scalar could be dm or could decay to the light singlet fermions .",
    "but the case of three higgs doublets , the results of @xcite are slightly modified , since there is the mixing of the cp - even scalars in the non - inert higgs sector .",
    "suppose @xmath47 is the light of the cp - even scalar and sm - like , meaning @xmath71 , the production cross section of @xmath47 is still enhanced as in the case without extra higgs doublets . however , its invisible decay width can be enlarged , if it decays into light inert scalars .",
    "also the three higgs scenario allows for a bigger invisible width than the two higgs scenario because of the additional scalars from the third doublet .",
    "the authors of @xcite have investigated the parameter space in which the fourth generations with two mixed higgs doublets is compatible with recent lhc results .",
    "they have shown that fourth generations is still allowed in the @xmath70 region , even if one took into account hints in @xmath65 channel .",
    "on the other hand , suppose @xmath47 is the heavier higgs boson and not sm - like .",
    "@xcite notes that the unitarity bounds on a general two - higgs model allows for @xmath72 .",
    "how these unitarity bounds change with the addition of a third inert doublet is worth investigating further . at the very least in the non - inert sector of the scalar potential ,",
    "the unitarity bounds are unchanged .",
    "the model above presents a framework of naturally small sm neutrino and heavy fourth generation neutrino while allowing for a variety of dm candidates .",
    "we have also shown that these fourth generation models are compatible with the lhc higgs searches in the low higgs mass region , @xmath70 and in the high mass region @xmath73 .",
