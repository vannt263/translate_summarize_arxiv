    "the classical t tauri stars ( ctts ) are optically revealed , low - mass , pre  main - sequence stars that accrete material from a circumstellar disk and have a well - defined connection between accretion and outflow ( * ? ? ?",
    "* heg hereafter ) .",
    "accretion from the disk to the star is thought to be guided by the stellar magnetosphere , where a sufficiently strong magnetic field truncates the disk at several stellar radii and material follows field lines that direct it to the stellar surface at high latitudes @xcite .",
    "magnetospheric accretion controls the star - disk interaction , and an improved understanding of this process will shed light on outstanding issues in the innermost 10  @xmath3 of ctts systems , such as the regulation of stellar angular momentum and the launching of the inner wind .",
    "leading diagnostics of ctts accretion include the optical / uv continuum excess and the profiles of permitted emission lines @xcite .",
    "kinematic evidence for infalling gas in ctts began with the discovery that some ctts show inverse p cygni structure in upper balmer lines extending to velocities of several hundred km  s@xmath5  @xcite .",
    "later , more sensitive surveys found that redshifted absorption components are relatively common in some lines , especially in the upper balmer and paschen series @xcite .",
    "although redshifted absorption extending to several hundred km  s@xmath5  clarifies that material accretes in free - fall from at least several stellar radii , it has been the success of radiative transfer modeling of line formation in magnetospheric accretion flows in a key series of papers culminating with @xcite that has provided the strongest underpinning for this phenomenon . under the assumption of an aligned , axisymmetric dipole ,",
    "the models have had reasonably good success in reproducing the general morphology of hydrogen profiles and emission fluxes in some stars .",
    "the complementary assessment of accretion rates follows from interpreting the sed of the optical / uv excess , which has been successfully modeled for wavelengths shortward of 0.5  @xmath1 as arising in a hot accretion shock , where accreting material impacts the stellar surface after free - fall along funnel flows coupled to the disk ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* cg hereafter ) . to match the observations ,",
    "the accretion shock filling factor is less than 1% in most cases but can climb to 10% in a few of the most active accretors .",
    "the derived accretion rates range from @xmath6 to @xmath7 @xmath8  yr@xmath5  with a median of @xmath9  @xmath8  yr@xmath5  @xcite .",
    "additionally , zeeman broadening of unpolarized ctts photospheric lines indicates mean surface field strengths in the range 1 - 3  kg @xcite , sufficiently strong to induce disk truncation and drive funnel flows .",
    "however , these strong surface fields are not predominantly dipolar , as photospheric lines show only weak net circular polarization implying dipole components an order of magnitude smaller @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , an extended dipole component is inferred for the accretion flow , since the same authors find significant circular polarization in the narrow component of the  @xmath05876  emission line , thought to be formed in the accretion shock at the base of the funnel flow @xcite .",
    "the evidence for magnetospheric accretion is thus compelling ; however , the topology of the magnetosphere , the geometry of the accretion flow , and the disk truncation radius remain topics of considerable investigation , since their configuration impacts processes for angular momentum regulation and wind launching .",
    "one form of angular momentum regulation , known as disk locking , invokes a spin - up torque from accreting material just inside the corotation radius balanced by a spin - down torque at larger radii @xcite .",
    "this approach has been questioned by @xcite , who instead suggest accretion - powered stellar winds as a more likely means for stellar spindown , which must occur simultaneously with magnetospheric accretion from the disk ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "alternatively the x - wind model @xcite originally featured a narrow annulus of star - disk coupling close to the corotation radius , where closed field lines develop funnel flows and open field lines drive a centrifugal outflow that carries away angular momentum from accreting material , thus inhibiting stellar spin - up .",
    "the flexibility of this model to maintain its basic properties in the face of complex magnetospheric accretion geometries has recently been demonstrated by @xcite .",
    "if the stellar and disk fields are parallel , then an intermittent outflow can develop via a reconnection x - wind , which removes angular momentum from the star as well as the inner disk @xcite .",
    "evidence for non - aligned fields coupled with complex accretion geometries is mounting , coming from a variety of recent studies . using time - resolved spectropolarimetry of the mildly accreting ctts v2129 oph ,",
    "@xcite used zeeman detections from both photospheric features and emission lines from the accretion shock to construct a doppler tomographic map of the magnetic topology on the stellar surface .",
    "the dominant field on the star is a misaligned octupole , and accretion is confined largely to a high - latitude spot , covering @xmath10% of the stellar surface .",
    "these authors also attempt to reconstruct the 3d field geometry out to the disk interaction region and suggest that the large - scale field funneling accreting material from the disk is more complex than a simple dipole .",
    "however , such extrapolation techniques , while tantalizing , must be applied with caution at present , since there are numerous uncertainties in the reconstruction process @xcite .",
    "numerical magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulations of star - disk interactions demonstrate that non - axisymmetric funnel flows arise if the stellar field is tipped by only a few degrees relative to the rotation axis , breaking into two discrete streams under stable accretion conditions @xcite .",
    "if the accretion rate is sufficiently high , accretion is predicted to proceed through equatorial `` tongues '' that can push apart field lines @xcite .",
    "similarly , accretion spots can appear at a wide range of latitudes , including equatorial belts .",
    "such behavior has been observed in models featuring accretion along quadrupolar as well as dipolar field lines @xcite , accretion along field lines extrapolated from surface magnetograms @xcite , and accretion mediated by a dynamo - generated disk magnetic field @xcite .",
    "observational signatures for misaligned dipoles are being explored in radiative transfer models for hydrogen line formation in funnel flows , with subsequent predictions for rotationally modulated profile variations .",
    "initially @xcite presented radiative transfer models of hydrogen lines featuring curtains of accretion covering a limited extent in azimuth in geometries consistent with aligned dipoles .",
    "their model profiles exhibit certain characteristics of the observed line profile variability , such as rotationally modulated line strengths and the appearance of red absorption components at certain phases and inclinations , but the predicted level of variability is higher than observed .",
    "more recently , @xcite applied a radiative transfer code for h line formation to the 3-d output from the mhd simulations of @xcite , which prescribe the geometry , density , and velocity of two - armed accretion streams that result from dipoles misaligned with the rotation axis by angles ranging from 10@xmath11 to 90@xmath11 . applying temperatures similar to those from the @xcite axisymmetric models",
    ", they were able to reproduce some of the trends in continuum and profile variability from models .",
    "one of the larger discrepancies in comparing the model profiles to observed ones is that the model profiles for paschen and brackett lines are a factor of two narrower than the mean value observed by @xcite .",
    "the problem is likely more complex than simply finding another line broadening mechanism , since paschen  @xmath12 has recently been shown to have line widths that are correlated with the 1-@xmath1 continuum excess , in the sense that the narrowest lines are found among objects with the lowest disk accretion rates ( * ? ? ?",
    "* efhk hereafter ) . evidence that some of the hydrogen emission is formed in the accretion shock rather than the funnel flow",
    "is now clearly demonstrated from the discovery of circular polarization in the core of balmer lines @xcite .",
    "the implication is that hydrogren lines are not necessarily a definitive means for probing the properties of funnel flows , so additional probes are desirable .    in this paper , we explore a different means of diagnosing the geometry of the accretion flow , making use of the redshifted subcontinuum absorption in the @xmath13  @xmath14 @xmath15  transition of neutral helium ( @xmath16 ) , recently demonstrated to be a very sensitive probe of both outflowing gas in the inner wind and infalling gas in the funnel flow due to its frequent display of blue and red absorptions ( efhk ) .",
    "a subcontinuum absorption feature is a more tell - tale diagnostic of a kinematic flow than an emission profile , since its position ( blue or red ) indicates the direction of the flow , its width indicates the range of line - of - sight velocities in the flow , and its depth at a particular velocity indicates the fraction of the continuum ( stellar plus veiling ) occulted by material moving at that velocity . in the case of a red absorption , the absorption depth signals the fraction of the stellar surface covered by the funnel flow at each velocity , making it an effective probe of the ctts accretion geometry .",
    "this is the third in a series of papers about 1-@xmath1 diagnostics of accretion and outflow in ctts .",
    "the first , efhk , presented 1-@xmath1 spectra from 38 ctts including  @xmath010830  profiles , p@xmath12  profiles , and measurements of the continuum excess `` veiling '' in the 1-@xmath1 region . the second paper , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* kef hereafter ) , modeled blueshifted absorption components at  @xmath010830 , which appear in about three quarters of the sample , and found that while some stars have winds best explained as arising from the inner disk , others require an outflow moving radially away from the star in an accretion - powered `` stellar '' wind . in this paper , we analyze redshifted subcontinuum absorption at  @xmath010830  in 21 ctts that present red absorption in at least one observation .",
    "the following section describes the sample selection , data acquisition , and data reduction .",
    "section 3 presents the data and discusses variability . in section 4 ,",
    "we present model scattering profiles that arise in a dipolar flow geometry , show that they explain only a fraction of the red absorptions , and explore modifications to a dipolar flow that better explain the remaining observations .",
    "discussion and conclusions follow in sections 5 and 6 .",
    "in this paper we focus on the 21 of 38 ctts included in efhk that display redshifted subcontinuum absorption at  @xmath010830  at least once in a multi - epoch observing program with keck nirspec .",
    "it includes spectra presented in efhk acquired in november 2001 and november 2002 , when 8 of the 38 ctts were observed twice and 1 on three occasions .",
    "it also includes 33 additional spectra of 24 objects from that study , taken in 2005 , 2006 , and 2007 . in efhk ,",
    "19 out of 38 ctts showed red absorption at  @xmath010830 .",
    "in the subsequent observing runs ,  @xmath010830  red absorption was seen in 2 additional stars .",
    "thus , the 21 of 38 ctts ( 55% ) that have shown subcontinuum red helium absorption in at least one spectrum of 81 acquired between 2001 and 2007 form the sample for this paper . among the 21 stars with helium red absorption ,",
    "12 were observed more than once , with 6 observed twice , 1 observed three times , 4 observed four times , and 1 observed six times .",
    "the efhk sample was assembled to span the full range of mass accretion rates observed for ctts , from less than 10@xmath17 to @xmath18  @xmath8  yr@xmath5 , with a median rate of 10@xmath19  @xmath8  yr@xmath5 .",
    "most of them are from the taurus - auriga star - forming region and have spectral types of k7 to m0 .",
    "the subset of 21 stars that are the focus of this paper are identified in table  [ t.sample ] , along with their spectral types , masses , radii , rotation periods , median veilings @xmath20 at 0.57 @xmath1 , and mass accretion rates from the literature .",

    "stellar masses are then derived from the @xcite pre  main - sequence tracks , available online . since the escape velocity will be an important parameter in comparing observed to model profiles , we have given some thought to its accuracy . with a dependency on @xmath28 , the largest source of uncertainty in calculating the escape velocity",
    "is the uncertainty in @xmath29 , since temperature strongly affects both the mass and radius determination , while luminosity only weakly influences the radius estimate .",
    "we assess that the typical error in the escape velocity is @xmath30 .",

    "three of the 21 objects are known members of binary pairs resolved in our spectra where we have observed only the primary : dk tau a , hk tau a , and uy aur a. for another system , rw aur , we have resolved spectra of rw aur a and rw aur b , but only the latter shows red absorption at  @xmath010830  and thus qualifies as part of the sample for this study .",
    "there is conflicting evidence in the literature on whether rw aur b has a close companion at an angular separation of 0.12  with a k - band flux ratio of 0.024 @xcite . in our spectra",
    "we see the lines of only one object consistent with a k5 spectral type , and we call this rw aur b. an additional two objects are unresolved binaries : uz tau e and uz tau w. for these , we also see lines from only one star and attribute the 1-@xmath1 continuum and line profiles to the primary .",
    "in this study we concentrate on the red absorption seen at  @xmath010830  as a probe of the accreting gas , ignoring the blue absorptions that arise from disk and stellar winds ( kef ) . for each spectrum of the 21 stars that show subcontinuum redshifted  @xmath010830  absorption at least once , table  [ t.redabs ] lists the hjd of observation , the 1-@xmath1 veiling , and measurements of the red absorption . in this section",

    "the proportionality between @xmath25 and disk accretion rate is further corroborated by the excellent correlation between @xmath25 and the equivalent width of p@xmath12  emission ( efhk ) , assuming that the equivalent width of p@xmath12 , like that of p@xmath34 , is correlated with accretion rate @xcite .",
    "the prime message from figure  [ f.veil ] is that when the veiling is high , @xmath35 or @xmath36 , red absorption at  @xmath010830  is rare .",

    "even with our non - uniform sampling of individual objects , it is clear that the frequency of redshifted absorption in ctts with the highest veilings , seen in only 4% ( 1/25 ) of the total spectra of 9 objects , is significantly lower than that in ctts with more modest veilings , where red absorption is seen in 66% ( 37/56 ) of the total spectra of 29 objects .",

    "the reference sample will be used in all subsequent analysis unless we are explicitly considering profile or veiling variations .",
    "the uniqueness of the  @xmath010830  line in the study of accreting gas is immediately seen by comparing it to the p@xmath12  profile found in the same nirspec order .",

    "the gradual return to the continuum at the high - velocity end makes @xmath43  less straightforward to measure . in order to have a uniform definition for all stars , we conservatively define @xmath43  as the velocity where the absorption reaches 95% of the continuum level , with the consequence that it is somewhat smaller than the extreme infall velocity .",

    "the absorptions begin near the stellar rest velocity , so the fwqm reflects the true width of the absorbing velocities . in others",

    "thus , if a particular ray from a point on the stellar surface intersects the accreting flow such that the projection of the gas velocity along the ray extends from @xmath112 to @xmath113 , then continuum photons from ( @xmath114  km  s@xmath5 ) to ( @xmath115  km  s@xmath5 ) are scattered . because spontaneous emission is the dominant de - excitation route of the @xmath010830 upper state ( @xmath13 ) in comparison with other decay , collisional , or ionization processes , the photon absorption and subsequent re - emission is in effect a resonant scattering process if the small fine - structure energy differences among the three sub - levels are ignored . rather than following the photon path in detail ( e.g. , with a monte carlo simulation ) , we simply assume a single scattering in which the absorbed photon is re - emitted isotropically with the appropriate doppler shift , and it either hits the star ; hits the opaque , flat disk ; or escapes the system .",
    "while this is inconsistent with the assumption of an opaque line , we find that the exact contribution to the observed profile from the scattered photons has no significant bearing on our conclusions ( see subsequent sections ) , so the extra effort is unwarranted .",
    "the emergent spectrum at a particular viewing angle @xmath116 is made up of photons that , either because they are not absorbed or they are scattered , escape into a solid angle bin centered on @xmath116 .",
    "for a random selection of @xmath116 over @xmath117 steradians , @xmath118 is uniformly distributed .",
    "considering five viewing angles , we choose @xmath119 , 0.7 , 0.5 , 0.3 , and 0.1 , or @xmath120 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 , @xmath123 , and @xmath124 .",
    "figure  [ f.example ] shows an example of the components contributing to the emergent model profile in the case of @xmath87 ( @xmath125 , and @xmath89 ( @xmath126 ) , viewed at @xmath127 .",
    "the final emergent spectrum , shown in black , is the sum of contributions from the stellar and the veiling ( accretion shock ) continua , each shown separately in solid gray .",
    "the stellar contribution is the one with a normalized continuum level of 0.78 , due to scattering of the 4000-k continuum , while the veiling contribution is the one with a normalized continuum level of 0.22 , due to scattering of the 8000-k continuum .",
    "the ratio of these two continua , @xmath128 , is the 1-@xmath1 veiling @xmath25 , also noted in the figure .",
    "each solid gray component is further the sum of two subcomponents .",
    "one , shown with a dashed line in each case , is the absorption profile of the respective continuum .",
    "the other , shown with a dotted line in each case , is the emission profile , produced by scattered photons that escape toward the specified line of sight .",
    "the emission subcomponent is both broad and weak , since scattered photons can be red- or blueshifted and because for each photon absorbed , the ensuing emitted photon may hit the disk or star and not escape . thus the filling - in of the red absorption by its own associated scattered emission is generally slight .",
    "figure  [ f.example ] also illustrates an important aspect of the models , that the redshifted absorption in the emergent profile is affected differently by scattering of the stellar and the veiling continua . in this model , with @xmath129 and @xmath127 , the line of sight toward the veiling continuum intersects the portion of the accretion flow close to the star where the gas velocity is high ( see fig .  [ f.geom ] ) , and scattering of the veiling continuum produces a red absorption that extends from 0.27 to 0.87  @xmath48 .",
    "in contrast , the line of sight toward the stellar continuum intercepts portions of the accretion column with smaller infall speeds and a smaller velocity component is projected onto the line of sight .",
    "the red absorption thus produced ranges from @xmath130 to 0.74  @xmath48  and is also shallower than the one from the veiling continuum .",
    "the resultant absorption profile is thus complex in shape and broader than either of the two individually , and in this case it has a maximum depth of about 20% into the summed continuum .",
    "figures  [ f.simr2 ] , [ f.simr4 ] , and [ f.simr8 ] show the full range of model profiles for the three chosen values of @xmath77 : 2 , 4 , and 8  @xmath3 respectively ( corresponding to @xmath131 , @xmath132 , and @xmath133 ) . in each figure , the three rows show , from top to bottom , the three selections of @xmath88 , 0.05 , and 0.1 . in each row",
    ", the five panels show the profiles for the five viewing angles , from @xmath134 . within each of the 15 panels representing a unique combination of @xmath82 and @xmath116 ,",
    "the final emergent profile is shown ( solid black curve ) along with the separate contributions from scattering of the veiling continuum ( dotted curve ) and the stellar continuum ( solid gray curve ) , but not the subcomponents of absorption and scattered emission from each continuum source .",
    "we emphasize the following points from these three figures :    \\1 . when @xmath88 , the red absorption is dominated by scattering of the stellar continuum , generally showing small absorption equivalent widths and velocity widths .",
    "the profiles have a strong dependence on inclination , with shallow absorption at small inclinations and narrow , deeper , low - velocity absorption at high inclinations .",
    "the magnitude of the red absorption , measured by either the equivalent width or the maximum depth of absorption , is sensitive to the parameter @xmath82 . as @xmath82 increases",
    ", there is both an increase in the veiling continuum and an increase in the coverage of accreting field lines projected in front of the stellar surface for a given @xmath77 , enabling the line of sight to each point on the star to intersect more accreting field lines and hence yield a broader range in the projected velocity of the infalling gas .",
    "\\3 . for a given @xmath82 ,",
    "the red absorption is generally stronger at a larger @xmath77 ( smaller @xmath81 ) , since the accreting field lines then cover a greater range of solid angles , and the larger span between @xmath68 and @xmath69 produces a broader range in the gas velocity .",
    "however , inclination also plays a role , so that for a given @xmath82 and @xmath77 , the strongest absorption occurs at a line of sight @xmath116 that parallels the final part of the trajectory of the accretion flow . from the schematic in figure  [ f.geom ] , it can be seen that for @xmath131 , @xmath132 , and @xmath133 , the corresponding viewing angle to maximize the red absorption is roughly @xmath135 , @xmath122 , and @xmath121 respectively .",
    "thus an increased @xmath81 ( smaller @xmath77 ) requires a higher @xmath116 for a strong red absorption .",
    "this occurs because the contribution to the absorption from scattering of the veiling continuum is broadest when viewed in a direction parallel to the flow just before it impacts the star .",
    "\\4 . the observed emission , i.e.",
    ", the part of the profile above the continuum , is usually weaker than the absorption and is mostly blueshifted . only in the extreme but unrealistic case when @xmath90 ( @xmath136 ) with high @xmath82 ( 0.05 or 0.1 ) and excessive @xmath69 ( 13 and 35 @xmath3 for @xmath89 and 0.1 respectively ) does a double - peaked profile result when viewed close to edge on .",
    "the resulting accretion flow has a large solid angle , and since it is assumed to be in corotation with the star , the rotational broadening is considerable .",
    "this situation was included to complete our chosen parameter space and is not realistic .",
    "the veiling ( @xmath91 ) from the 8000-k accretion zone depends on @xmath82 , @xmath81 and @xmath116 .",
    "the dependence on @xmath82 is obvious , since @xmath91 scales almost linearly with @xmath82 ( eq .  [ [ e.veil ] ] ) .",
    "the dependences on @xmath81 and @xmath116 arise through their influences on the projected area of each continuum source .",
    "the parameter @xmath81 signifies the orientation of the veiling continuum , hence its direct effect on the veiled area viewed . although less sensitive to the viewing angle , the projected stellar continuum area changes because of the presence of the disk extending from @xmath68 ( dependent on @xmath81 and @xmath82 ) to infinity . for both @xmath136 and @xmath132 , @xmath25 at a given @xmath82 drops monotonically as @xmath116 increases from pole - on",
    "to edge - on , by a factor of 5 and 3 respectively . at @xmath131",
    ", @xmath25 varies less , dropping by a factor of 1.6 from @xmath120 to @xmath123 , then increasing slightly toward @xmath137 .",
    "for example , when @xmath87 ( @xmath129 ) and @xmath138 , @xmath25 ranges from 0.4 to 1.15 and @xmath20 ranges from 1.5 to 4.5 with viewing angle .",
    "in sum , a strong red absorption extending to high velocities , like those observed , requires @xmath82 ( and thus @xmath91 ) to be large so the contribution from scattering of the veiling continuum is enhanced and the angular extent of the flow on the star is increased .",
    "strong , broad absorption is also more likely when @xmath77 is large and the line of sight parallels the accretion flow close to the star .",
    "the relation between absorption magnitude and @xmath91 is a crucial test of the dipolar accretion model , as we will show in the following subsection when we compare the observations to our model profiles .",
    "+      in comparing our models with observed profiles , we focus on the red absorptions , since the small emission at blueward velocities expected from scattering in the funnel flow will often be overwhelmed by additional sources of emission , such as scattering and in - situ emission from a wind .",
    "the red absorptions are evaluated in context with the observed veiling , which is the basis for evaluating @xmath82 .",
    "it is immediately apparent that there is a mismatch between the model profiles in figures  [ f.simr2 ] , [ f.simr4 ] , and [ f.simr8 ] and the observed spectra in figure  [ f.redabs ] , since the majority of ctts are known to have @xmath139 ( cg ) while model sequences for @xmath88 ( implied @xmath140 and @xmath141 ) have shallow and/or narrow red absorptions bearing little resemblance to the ensemble of broad and deep observed  @xmath010830  profiles .",
    "a more explicit demonstration of the limitation of the models can be made from a quantitative comparison between the equivalent width and veiling for model and observed profiles .",
    "this comparison requires normalizing the observed profiles to their respective escape velocities , since in the models all velocities are in units of the escape velocity .",
    "the normalized equivalent width , @xmath142 , has an intuitive interpretation : it is simply the fraction of the continuum absorbed between rest and the escape velocity , with a value of 1 indicating total absorption over the entire range .",
    "figure  [ f.comp ] compares the normalized red absorption equivalent width @xmath143 to @xmath25 and @xmath20 for both models and observations of the reference sample . in the models we have assumed that the excesses at both @xmath22 and @xmath144 arise from an accretion shock that emits an 8000-k blackbody continuum",
    "this is known to be a valid assumption for optical veilings , and while the @xmath20 data points are not simultaneous with the observed absorption profiles , the fact that all but one of the objects with @xmath33 also have low @xmath20 indicates that this is a reasonable approach . unless the @xmath20 values for these objects were all a factor of 5 to 10 higher when the  @xmath010830  profiles were obtained than when the heg data were obtained , the two panels together clearly indicate that only a fraction of the observed data lie within the realm of the model results : those with weak red absorption and small veiling or those with modest red absorption and intermediate veiling .",
    "there is a glaring discrepancy between models and observations for stars with large @xmath143 and small @xmath25 .",
    "the values for @xmath143 and adopted escape velocities are listed in table  [ t.normal ] along with two additional properties of the red absorption : the normalized width and the depth .",
    "the normalized full - width at quarter - minimum , fwqm@xmath145 , is the width measured at one quarter of the absorption minimum as a fraction of the escape velocity .",
    "the depth of the absorption component at 0.75  @xmath48  normalized to 100% , @xmath146 , was chosen since it is sensitive to the infall geometry close to the star . as with @xmath143 ,",
    "a number of stars indicate a discrepancy with the basic dipole model , where objects with small veiling frequently have both fwqm@xmath145 and @xmath146 much larger than can be accounted for with the models .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ f.comp2 ] , which shows the comparison of the velocity - normalized equivalent width , velocity - normalized line width , and high - velocity depth to 1-@xmath1 veiling for observations and models .",

    "this conclusion is robust , since the models have been constructed to produce maximal red absorption for a given @xmath77 and @xmath82 , in that the @xmath010830 transition is assumed to be optically thick and the thermal / turbulent broadening has a generous 10  km  s@xmath5  half - width .",

    "figure  [ f.comp ] demonstrates that shifting all the model results to the left by a factor of 2 in @xmath25 or 3 in @xmath20 is still insufficient to account for the strong absorptions and low veilings .",
    "we thus conclude that those profiles with strong absorptions and small veilings lie outside the realm of model results for self - consistent dipole flows .      a simple way to keep the veiling small and yet have the accretion flow project a broad velocity range in front of the star is to let the flow arise over a large range of @xmath44 ( thus impacting the star over a large range of @xmath152 ) but to fill the whole enclosed volume only _ dilutely _ with accreting gas .",
    "we now distinguish between @xmath76 , the fractional surface area on the star over which the magnetospheric footpoints are distributed , and @xmath82 , the fractional surface area on the star occupied by accretion shocks at the base of field lines that carry accreting gas .",
    "we define @xmath153 as the fraction of @xmath76 occupied by all the accretion shocks . with enough dilution , i.e. , @xmath154 sufficiently small",
    ", @xmath76 can be large enough to provide the areal coverage over a large velocity range that is necessary for a broad and deep red absorption , while @xmath155 can remain small , as required to produce a low veiling .",
    "one way to achieve this is to postulate a large number of narrow accretion streamlets spatially separated from one another that together impact only a fraction @xmath154 of the outlined area @xmath76 .",
    "( we assume the many accretion shocks are dispersed randomly throughout @xmath76 . ) then , with an intrinsic thermal or turbulent line broadening of @xmath156  km  s@xmath5  associated with each streamlet , photons from the star can intersect a sufficient number of streamlets such that the continuum ( stellar or veiling ) will be absorbed over the full velocity range specified by the parameter @xmath76 as though the whole volume were filled .    the concept of many accretion streamlets dilutely filling a volume has the additional advantage of offering a credible explanation for how the lower level of @xmath010830 ( @xmath15 ) is populated over all streamlines . with the difficulty of maintaining a temperature high enough ( @xmath157  k ) for collisional excitation to the @xmath15  level in a freely falling gas , it is likely that photoionization is the excitation mechanism .",
    "then , if the source of ionizing photons is the accretion shock itself , the much smaller shocked area of an individual streamlet within a diluted flow , as compared to the shocked area of a single undiluted flow , will enable more ionizing photons to escape from the sides and ionize the gas in other streamlets , even at positions far from the star . or ,",
    "if the dominant source of ionizing radiation is located away from the streamlets ( e.g. , the stellar corona ) , these photons will be able to penetrate into the volume and ionize individual streamlets as opposed to ionizing just the skin of a single completely filled accretion flow .",
    "thus , many narrow streamlets dilutely filling a large volume not only yield a deep red absorption from the large coverage area over a broad velocity range of infalling gas , but they also readily account for the ionization of gas at each location in the flow to produce an optically thick @xmath010830 transition over the whole velocity range .",

    "we highlight the @xmath127 profile with a darker line , since this is the most probable viewing angle .",
    "although all profiles in figure  [ f.dilute ] are for @xmath88 , the associated veilings differ slightly because the accretion - heated area is distributed differently for different values of @xmath76 and @xmath81 , leading to slightly different projected areas . nonetheless , in all cases , @xmath162 .",
    "for these small veilings , the absorption , while quite strong when there is significant dilution , is almost entirely due to scattering of the stellar continuum , in contrast to the undiluted models where large veilings and scattering of the veiling continuum were necessary to produce strong absorption . as dilution increases for a given @xmath77 ,",
    "the red absorptions become increasingly strong and broad , due to the increased areal coverage over a broader range of velocities as the interval between @xmath68 and @xmath69 increases . for example , the maximum penetration depth of the red absorption into the continuum , @xmath40 , increases from 10% to 30% for @xmath163 between an undiluted and a @xmath164 flow . as before ,",
    "larger @xmath77 also increases the areal coverage and thus the depth and breadth of the absorption : for @xmath87 and @xmath165 , @xmath40 reaches to 50% of the stellar continuum for all viewing angles . in the unrealistic case of @xmath90 and @xmath166 , where @xmath69 extends to @xmath167",

    ", the impact region extends from @xmath188 to @xmath189 , while in the bottom row , the impact region extends from @xmath190 to the equator . in both cases , @xmath165 and @xmath88 . as expected , the absorption is strongest for a viewing angle within the confines of the flow ( i.e. , @xmath191 ) , and the profile becomes a nearly symmetric emission profile ( assuming axisymmetry and no rotation ) for views close to pole - on .",
    "when the viewing angle is aligned or nearly aligned with the column of absorbing gas , each radial model can produce the observed range of absorption depths at high velocities , with @xmath192% for profiles with @xmath193 in the top row and @xmath194 in the bottom row .",
    "we are not advocating radial infall starting from a large distance , and thus , the profile sequences in figure  [ f.radial ] are not expected to be realistic for the whole velocity range .",
    "however , the requisite deep absorption at high velocities , resulting from material moving faster than @xmath195 , all arises inside of about 2  @xmath3 .",
    "thus the message from these calculations is that the accretion stream only need move in a radial trajectory , i.e. , become less curved than a dipole , as it nears the star .",
    "the effectiveness of radial infall trajectories for material near the star in accounting for the high - velocity absorption in aa tau , dk tau , and dn tau is shown in figure  [ f.oplot ] .",
    "the figure shows model and observed profiles where ( 1 ) profiles are inverted so the vertical axis is a measure of the minimum stellar coverage fraction at each velocity and ( 2 ) only velocities in excess of 0.5  @xmath48  are plotted .",
    "the regime of diluted dipolar models with the largest @xmath146 is shown with dark and hatched shading , while the regime of flows with radial trajectories for gas near the star is shown with light shading .",
    "the dark shading is for the best case from our diluted dipolar models for a flow contained entirely within the corotation radius : @xmath166 originating between 3.0 and 6.2  @xmath3 in the disk and viewed from @xmath196 . although 8  @xmath3 is a more typical corotation radius , extending the flow out to this distance would not produce much additional absorption .",
    "the hatched region is for a diluted dipole that allows field lines extending out to nearly twice the corotation radius to participate in the flow , where the dashed lines are for the case @xmath87 , @xmath197 ( @xmath198 ) , seen from two viewing angles , @xmath120 and @xmath196 .",
    "although the latter two extreme dipolar models come close to producing sufficient absorption at high velocities , significant accretion beyond corotation is likely not physical .",
    "in contrast to the dipole trajectories , the regime of the four radial models from figure  [ f.radial ] with viewing angles nearly aligned with the infalling gas easily contains the observed stellar coverage fraction from 0.6 to 0.85  @xmath48 , with no requirement that the flow originate at radii beyond corotation .",
    "the realistic situation is likely to involve some complex magnetic field topologies with trajectories approaching radial as they near the star .",
    "the high opacity and resonance scattering properties of  @xmath010830  enable the geometry of magnetospheric accretion to be probed via absorption of gas seen in projection against the star , in contrast to previous studies that rely on the morphology of emission lines . under the assumptions that the flow is an azimuthally symmetric dipole and helium",
    "is sufficiently optically thick that all incident 1-@xmath1 radiation is scattered , we have illustrated the sensitivity of the red absorption to both the angular extent of the magnetosphere and the filling factor of hot gas from the accretion shock @xmath82 .",
    "if @xmath82 exceeds a few percent , the hot spot will be an important contributor to the scattering of the 1-@xmath1 continuum ; however , since the strongest and broadest  @xmath010830  absorptions are seen in stars with little or no 1-@xmath1 veiling , these red absorptions must instead arise almost solely by scattering of photospheric radiation . achieving the observed breadth and depth of the absorption",
    "requires a large angular coverage of the stellar continuum in the azimuthal direction over a wide range of velocities for many stars , with areal coverage in footpoints on the star of @xmath199 .",
    "we suggest that the required combination of wide flows and low filling factors of hot gas is a result of accretion in many narrow streamlets , each of which may have a dipolar configuration but which together only fill a small fraction of the enclosed volume .",
    "we have explored the case where the streamlets are uniformly distributed through the accreting volume , producing wide , dilutely filled flows that reconcile the need for absorption over a broad range of velocities with filling factors of hot gas @xmath200 , as observed ( cg ) .",
    "earlier studies also imply a discrepancy between the areal coverage @xmath76 of magnetospheric footpoints and the filling factor of hot accretion shocks @xmath82 .",
    "for example , magnetospheres with @xmath201 were invoked to model hydrogen lines arising from accretion flows in order to produce sufficient line fluxes and mass accretion rates @xcite .",
    "the seminal sequence of papers modeling hydrogen line formation in funnel flows from @xcite to @xcite also required filling factors that were larger than predicted by sed modeling of continuum excesses to account for observed emission line luminosities .",
    "the notion of accretion via streamlets that dilutely fill a large volume is a straightforward way to reconcile this discrepancy , simultaneously allowing large field sizes and small shock filling factors .",
    "although our model invokes diluted accretion flows in widely distributed streamlets of gas , an alternate scenario for diluted accretion is the one suggested by the mhd simulations of @xcite , where internal structure within the accretion flow gives a mass accretion rate ( and a corresponding blackbody continuum temperature ) that is highest at the interior and falls off toward the sides .",
    "although this scenario can also , for a large @xmath76 , produce a smaller veiling from the area - weighted blackbody continua than the undiluted @xmath160 case , the advantage to widely dispersed streamlets is that they provide a facile means for ionizing radiation to penetrate to most of the infalling gas , since distributed accretion shocks with small individual areas would allow ionizing photons produced in each shock to escape more easily from the sides and ionize helium at other locations .",
    "another consequence of such distributed accretion shocks is that photons from the shocks emitted toward the star would be incident on a larger area of the photosphere than for a single shock with the same @xmath82 .",
    "this may invalidate the usual assumption of a plane - parallel geometry for the radiative transfer of photons with the effect that , independent of the internal structure within an individual streamlet , the resultant veiling continuum would encompass a range in blackbody temperatures . in a wide flow where dilution is somewhat uniform , there will be many separate shocks with a range of blackbody temperatures surrounding them",
    ". there may be some observational support for this phenomenon in that the veiling continuum longward of 0.5  @xmath1 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; efhk ) is broader than the single 8000-k blackbody that is a good match to the excess at shorter wavelengths ( cg ) .",
    "constraints on the angular extent of accreting gas and the location in the disk where infall originates are relevant to models for disk locking and wind launching . although there are some cases where  @xmath010830  profiles resemble those expected from viewing an accretion funnel restricted to a narrow origination around the corotation radius , the suite of profiles expected from viewing this magnetic topology from all inclination angles is not consistent with the observations .",
    "the most extreme deep and broad absorptions instead require infall spanning a wide extent of origination radii , from a few @xmath3 out to at least typical corotation radii of 6 to 8  @xmath3 if the flows are dipolar .",
    "for other magnetic field configurations , such as a tilted dipole or a multipole field , significant red absorption need not require such a wide range in initial infall distances . in general ,",
    "the depth of the red absorption is governed more by the range of impact latitudes than by the range of initial radii ; only for a dipolar flow aligned with the rotational axis are the two ranges so closely linked .",
    "for example , in an aligned dipolar flow with @xmath87 and @xmath166 , the range in impact latitude of 23.6 - 35.3@xmath11 corresponds to a range in initial radius of 3.0 - 6.2  @xmath3 . in a more complex magnetic configuration ,",
    "a comparably wide range of impact angles could produce a strong red absorption without the need for such a large range of initial radii .",
    "the necessity for a dilutely filled flow does imply that there is not a sharp delineation on the disk for accretion onto the star .",
    "it likely indicates a very inhomogeneous field structure at large distances , with many local pockets distributed over a broad radial range on the disk giving rise to accretion streamlets . since our analysis assumes axial symmetry in a set of nested dipolar flows , the constraints that the breadth and depth of the red absorption place on the angular extent of the accreting gas are even more extreme if , as likely , accretion channels are in restricted azimuth zones .",
    "furthermore , there are some red absorptions that are so deep at velocities @xmath202 that a dipole morphology is inadequate , even when arising from 2 @xmath3 to the corotation radius . in these cases",
    "we find that radially directed infall can achieve the requisite depth of absorption , although other topologies that result in a large covering factor of the star at the highest velocities can likely be constructed .",
    "recent doppler tomographic maps of the ctts v2129 oph and bp tau , based on circular polarization of @xcite , reveal the locations of accretion hot spots on the stars .",
    "the spots span quite a broad latitude range ( extending roughly from the pole to @xmath158 ) but a very narrow azimuthal range .",
    "the narrow azimuthal range implies that the detection of  @xmath010830  red absorption requires an opportune time at which the accretion spots are directly in view .",
    "this situation is consistent with the result that bp tau , a mildly accreting ctts included in our  @xmath010830  survey , did not show any  @xmath010830  red absorption on the two occasions we observed it . at present , there are not enough tomographic data to see how consistent this pattern is among a range of accreting stars , although our detection of subcontinuum red absorption in 21 of 38 ctts , including 20 of 29 stars ( and 37 of 56 total spectra ) with @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) , would imply a large azimuthal coverage by the accretion spots . however , we note that even in the two stars with tomographic maps , there is a possibility that accretion impacts the stars over a wide range of longitudes .",
    "donati et al .  attribute only 2/3 of the  @xmath05876  emission but all of the  @xmath05876  circular polarization to accretion spots , based on the fraction of the emission that shows rotational modulation compared to that which is time - independent .",
    "the time - independent component , responsible for 1/3 of the  @xmath05876  emission , is attributed to a chromospheric component distributed uniformly over the stellar surface . however , since non - accreting wtts show either very weak or , more commonly , no  @xmath05876  emission @xcite , it would appear that tts chromospheres are not significant contributors to this line . instead , the time - independent component may be from more widely distributed accretion shocks that cover a broader range of longitudes .      in this paper",
    "we have focused on the 21/38 ctts that show redshifted absorption in  @xmath010830  at least once in an observational program with sporadic time coverage . clearly",
    "the absence of  @xmath010830  red absorption is also important in constraining the topology of magnetospheric accretion .",
    "an important point is that  @xmath010830  red absorption is rarely seen among ctts with the highest 1-@xmath1 veiling ( 1/25 observations ; see section 3.1 ) . of the 9 stars in the efhk survey in this category ,",
    "the only one that showed redshifted absorption , on 1 of 4 occasions , is dr tau .",
    "we suspect that in all 9 of these stars , emission from a wind exterior to the accretion flow , instead of from the flow itself , is filling in any redshifted absorption that may be present .",
    "if in - situ emission from the funnel flow were significant , it would be difficult for it to fill up the absorption at the red edge of the profile , since the geometry of the funnel flow results in smaller volumes at higher velocities , producing centrally peaked emission profiles that fall off rapidly toward both blue and red high velocities ( see the contribution to the emission from scattering of the stellar continuum in fig .",
    "[ f.example ] ) .",
    "the near absence of red absorption among these stars instead calls for a situation in which the redshifted absorption , if present , is filled in completely . in the case of dr tau ,",
    "it is clear that weak red absorption , confined to high velocities , is visible when the emission from the p cygni wind profile is weakest ( see fig .  [ f.multi ] ) . among the other stars in this high - veiling group , all have either broad blue helium absorptions indicative of viewing through a stellar wind or strong helium emission interpreted to arise in a conical stellar wind viewed obliquely ( see kef and efhk ) .",
    "either of these contributions to redward emission would be sufficient to fill up even a strong red absorption , provided the wind is optically thick and exterior to the accretion flow .",
    "when profiles from both  @xmath010830  and  @xmath05876  are considered , the evidence suggests that  @xmath010830  red absorption is rare or absent in ctts with large 1-@xmath1 veiling not primarily because the absorption is being filled in by wind emission but more because the geometry of the funnel flows is altered compared to that of low - veiling ctts .",
    "this inference is drawn from a study of  @xmath05876  profiles and optical veiling presented in @xcite , which includes many stars in common with efhk .",
    "they found that ctts whose  @xmath05876  profiles showed only a narrow component , consistent with formation in post - shock gas from an accretion shock , show an excellent correlation between the strength of narrow - component helium emission and optical veiling .",
    "in contrast , ctts whose  @xmath05876  profiles show a contribution from a broad component have reduced or absent emission from a narrow component relative to stars of similar optical veiling . while it might appear otherwise , this is not an esoteric point !",
    "it suggests that ctts with strong stellar winds and high optical and 1-@xmath1 veilings may have crunched or otherwise - altered magnetospheres resulting in weak narrow - component emission from a hot accretion shock , and there is a significant contribution to the veiling continuum from another source .",
    "in contrast , ctts without strong stellar winds ( many of which show disk wind profiles at  @xmath010830 ; see kef ) have extensive magnetospheres carrying accreting gas to the star , and hot accretion shocks are the dominant contributor to their optical veiling .",
    "we anticipate being able to test this suggestion shortly , following analysis of simultaneously obtained spectra extending from 0.4 to 2.2  @xmath1 .",
    "a second point regarding the frequency of  @xmath010830  red absorption is that , in contrast to ctts with high 1-@xmath1 veiling , red absorption is commonly seen in stars with lower veiling ( 37 out of 56 spectra for @xmath203 ; see section 3.1 ) . among this group ,",
    "some objects ( e.g. , tw hya and cy tau ; see fig .",
    "[ f.multi ] ) clearly show reduction of the red absorption as the emission , likely that of a stellar wind as indicated by the strong p cygni profile , increases . in such stars",
    "the appearance and disappearance of the red absorption is likely due , at least in part , to filling in by an exterior stellar wind , as in dr tau . in others ( e.g. , v836 tau and gk tau ; fig .",
    "[ f.multi ] ) , the weaker helium emission could arise simply from scattering in the funnel flow , and the absence of red absorption may indicate viewing at an azimuth with no funnel flow activity .",
    "azimuthal asymmetry in the funnel flow is also the likely explanation for the strongly variable red absorption morphology in objects such as aa tau and dk tau ( fig .  [ f.multi ] ) .",
    "the possibility that red absorption may be partially filled in , either by in - situ emission from the accretion flow or by scattered or in - situ emission from a wind , implies that the true magnitudes of some red absorptions are stronger and their constraints on the flow structure stiffer than the observations indicate .",
    "further , since red absorption can be completely filled in by in - situ wind emission or , in some cases , not be observed at all due to azimuthal inhomogeneities ,  @xmath010830  red absorption is likely more pervasive among ctts than is already apparent .",
    "inferences to date on the physical extent of accretion flows have largely relied on models positing that hydrogen and sodium lines are formed primarily in these flows @xcite . a correlation between the emitting area of the accretion flow and",
    "the magnitude of the mass accretion rate has been suggested by @xcite as the explanation for the well - established empirical correlation between infrared hydrogen line luminosities and accretion luminosities @xcite .",
    "the models of hydrogen line formation in magnetospheric flows predict that hydrogen line luminosities are primarily determined by the surface area of the accreting gas , not the density in the flow .",
    "the suggestion is that objects with higher accretion rates require larger emitting areas for their magnetospheres than objects with smaller accretion rates .",
    "since more extended magnetospheres are expected on theoretical grounds in objects with lower disk accretion rates , a further suggestion is that high - accretion - rate objects have wider azimuthal coverage of accreting columns .",
    "the red absorption profiles of  @xmath010830  give new insight into this phenomenon , since we have a clear indication of very extended and wide flows in stars with low accretion rates .",
    "for example , our limited phase coverage of the edge - on system aa tau shows that at the same time exceptionally strong red absorption at  @xmath010830  is observed , requiring extensive but dilutely filled accretion flows , the hydrogen p@xmath12 profile is weak , narrow , and symmetric , suggesting a small magnetospheric emitting area if it is formed in the accretion flow .",
    "we anticipate that time - monitoring campaigns combining profile monitoring of both  @xmath010830  and the immediately adjacent p@xmath12 line of hydrogen will provide a definitive assessment of the size and azimuthal coverage of the funnel flow and possibly also clarify the origin of the correlation between infrared hydrogen line luminosities and the accretion luminosity .",
    "we have probed the geometry of magnetospheric accretion in classical t tauri stars by modeling red absorption at  @xmath010830  via scattering of the stellar and veiling continua . between 2001 and 2007 ,",
    "we acquired 81 1-@xmath1 spectra of 38 ctts spanning the full observed range of mass accretion rates .",
    "of the 38 stars , 1 of 9 with @xmath35 and 20 of 29 with @xmath37 show red absorption at  @xmath010830  that extends below the 1-@xmath1 continuum in one or more spectra , demonstrating that red absorption from magnetospheric accretion is rare in objects with high veiling but is found in about two thirds of objects with moderate to low veiling .",
    "the red absorptions can be strong , deep , and broad , with equivalent widths up to 4.5   , maximum penetrations into the 1-@xmath1 continuum up to 61% , and widths at one quarter of the absorption minimum up to 320  km  s@xmath5 ; furthermore , they tend to be strongest in stars with the lowest veilings .",
    "we model the red absorption by assuming that an axisymmetric dipolar accretion flow scatters photons from the star and from hot zones in the accretion - heated photosphere that produce the 1-@xmath1 veiling and have filling factor @xmath82 . testing a range of magnetosphere widths and @xmath82 consistent with shock filling factors from the literature , we find that about half of the absorption profiles can be explained by dipolar flows in which the size of the flow is consistent with the size of the shock filling factor @xmath82 .",
    "weak absorptions in stars with weak veiling and intermediate absorptions in stars with intermediate veiling are explained by such flows , but strong absorptions in stars with little to no veiling are not .",
    "we introduce the concept of dilution as a means of producing a strong red absorption while keeping the filling factor and thus the veiling low . in a diluted flow",
    ", the magnetosphere can extend over a wide range of radii , with a large covering factor on the stellar surface , but this volume is incompletely filled by accreting gas . instead of a single thick flow , we posit multiple nested streamlets with a total filling factor small enough for a low veiling , but each with an intrinsic thermal or turbulent width sufficient to scatter photons as though the entire volume were filled , thereby yielding a large red absorption .",
    "the multiple streamlets can also explain how helium is ionized through the entire flow , rather than just the skin of a thick flow .",
    "large , dilutely filled accretion flows are necessary for about half of the objects , some of which require accreting streamlets to connect to the disk over a range from 2  @xmath3 out to or beyond corotation .",
    "a few stars show such deep absorption at redward velocities exceeding 50% of the stellar escape velocity that flows near the star with less curvature than a dipolar trajectory seem to be required .",
    "the frequency of  @xmath010830  red absorption is also informative .",
    "our limited temporal coverage suggests that the frequency of helium absorption differs in stars with high and low veiling .",
    "red absorption at  @xmath010830  is far more common in stars with low veiling . when it is absent from these stars , it is sometimes because helium emission from another source such as a wind fills it in and sometimes because of inhomogeneous azimuthal coverage of accreting magnetic columns . among stars with high veiling ( @xmath204 ) ,",
    "red absorption at  @xmath010830  is rarely seen . if these stars had accretion geometries similar to those of the low - veiling stars , they would be expected to have extremely strong red absorptions . even if the absorption were filled in by emission from the accretion flow , the stars",
    "would still be expected to show red absorption at high velocities . in the high - veiling stars , the paucity of  @xmath010830  red absorption , the presence of  @xmath010830  emission and blue absorption that suggest formation in accretion - powered stellar winds , and the weakness or absence of narrow - component  @xmath05876  emission from an accretion shock lead us to suggest that the magnetospheric accretion structure may be crunched or otherwise reduced in ctts with the highest disk accretion rates .",
    "we find the study of  @xmath010830  red absorption due to infalling gas projected in front of the star to be complementary to studies of emission lines modeled as arising over the full size of the accretion flow .",
    "the proximity of  @xmath010830  and p@xmath12 offer an excellent pair of lines for deeper investigation of magnetospheric geometries through intensive time - monitoring programs that can track non - aziumuthal structures as stars rotate .",
    "our limited phase coverage of aa tau demonstrates that this approach will be very effective , particularly when coupled with radiative transfer models that can constrain formation conditions for both lines simultaneously .",
