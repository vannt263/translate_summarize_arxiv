    "the fusion cross section at low energies crucially depends on the capture probability of the projectile by the target nucleus , i.e. on the probability to pass the coulomb barrier .",
    "there are many experimental and theoretical studies of heavy ion fusion reactions at extreme sub - barrier energies .",
    "the data obtained are of interest for solving the astrophysical problems related to nuclear synthesis .",
    "resent measurements of the fusion cross sections @xmath1 at energies @xmath2 below the coulomb barrier @xcite showed the very rapid fall of @xmath1 just below the barrier . in the @xmath0-factor representation @xcite , @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the sommerfeld parameter , the steep fall - off of the cross sections",
    "is related to a maximum of the @xmath0-factor .",
    "the indications for this maximum have been found in refs .",
    "however , its origin is still discussed .",
    "the so - called logarithmic derivative , @xmath5 , shows a growth at @xmath2 corresponding to the maximum of @xmath0-factor .    the experiments @xcite with the reactions @xmath6o,@xmath7ne+@xmath8pb , where the fusion and capture cross sections coincide , demonstrated the decreasing rate of fall of the cross sections at energies about 3 - 4 mev below the coulomb barrier .",
    "although this finding has to be checked in other experiments , it can not be presently ignored and deserves the theoretical analysis . in this paper",
    "we will show that unexpected behavior of sub - barrier fusion can be related to the switching off the nuclear interaction at external turning point @xmath9 .",
    "if the colliding nuclei approach the distance @xmath10 between their centers , the nuclear forces start to act in addition to the coulomb interaction .",
    "thus , at @xmath11 the relative motion may be more coupled with other degrees of freedom . at @xmath12 the relative motion is almost independent of the internal degrees of freedom .",
    "depending on whether the value of @xmath9 is larger or smaller than interaction radius @xmath10 , the impact of coupling with other degrees of freedom upon the barrier passage seems to be different .    to clarify the behavior of capture cross sections at sub - barrier energies , the further development of the theoretical methods is required .",
    "the conventional coupled - channel approach with realistic set of parameters is not able to describe the capture cross sections either below or above the coulomb barrier @xcite .",
    "the use of quite shallow nucleus - nucleus potential @xcite with adjusted repulsive core considerably improves the agreement between the calculated and experimental data . besides the coupling with collective excitations , the dissipation , which is simulated by an imaginary potential in ref .",
    "@xcite or by damping in each channel in ref .",
    "@xcite , seems to be important .",
    "the quantum diffusion approach @xcite is based on the quantum master - equation for the reduced density matrix and takes into account the fluctuation and dissipation effects in collisions of heavy ions which model the coupling with various channels . as demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite , this approach is successful for describing the capture cross sections at energies near the coulomb barrier . here , we apply it at wide energy interval including the extreme sub - barrier region . to avoid the effects of nuclear deformation , we treat reactions @xmath6o,@xmath7ne,@xmath13ca+@xmath8pb .",
    "the collisions of these spherical nuclei is treated in terms of a single collective variable : the relative distance @xmath14 between the colliding nuclei and the conjugate momentum @xmath15 .",
    "the coupling with other degrees of freedom is taken into account in the friction and diffusion .",
    "we use the nucleus - nucleus potential @xcite which naturally contains the repulsive part because of a density - dependent nucleon - nucleon force .",
    "the nucleon densities of the projectile and target nuclei are specified in the form of the woods - saxon parameterization , where the nuclear radius parameter is @xmath16 fm and the diffuseness parameter takes the values @xmath17 fm for the @xmath8pb , @xmath13ca , @xmath7ne nuclei and @xmath18 fm for the @xmath6o nucleus .",
    "the nucleus - nucleus potential @xmath19 has quite a shallow pocket ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "as the centrifugal part of the potential grows , the pocket depth becomes smaller , while the position of the pocket minimum moves towards the barrier at @xmath20 .",
    "this pocket is washed out at angular momenta @xmath21 . as demonstrated in refs.@xcite ,",
    "the internuclear potentials show a significant deviation from the conventional woods - saxon shape .",
    "the thicker the potential is , the smaller the penetrability is , and also the stronger the energy dependence of the penetrability is .",
    "the thick potential barrier obtained for the @xmath6o+@xmath8pb reaction is thus consistent with the recent experimental observations @xcite that the fusion excitation function is much steeper than theoretical predictions at deep sub - barrier energies .",
    "the present study suggests that the origin of the steep fall - off of fusion cross section is partly attributed to the deviation of the internuclear potential from the woods - saxon shape .",
    "the capture cross section is a sum of partial capture cross sections @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the reduced de broglie wavelength and the summation is in possible values of angular momentum @xmath24 at given bombarding energy @xmath2 .",
    "the partial capture probability @xmath25 is defined by the passing probability of the potential barrier in the relative distance @xmath14 at given @xmath24 .",
    "the value of @xmath25 can be obtained by integrating the propagator @xmath26 from the initial state @xmath27 at time @xmath28 to the final state @xmath29 at time @xmath30 : @xmath31 . \\label{1ab_eq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the second line in ( [ 1ab_eq ] ) is obtained by using the propagator @xmath32 ( @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 ) calculated in ref .",

    "thus , our diffusion approach contains the quantum mechanical barrier transmission probability . in the presence of coupling with internal degrees of freedom",
    "the capture at sub - barrier energies also occurs due to the quantum noise .",
    "the actions of friction and diffusion are the reverse of each other @xcite in the dissipation of energy . as a result , in the reactions treated the dissipation of energy is negligible at @xmath76 mev .",
    "the nuclear forces start to play a role at @xmath77 fm where the nucleon density of colliding nuclei approximately reaches 10% of saturation density . in fig .",
    "2 the interaction radius @xmath10 as well as internal and external turning points are shown for the @xmath6o+@xmath8pb reaction at zero angular momentum . if the value of @xmath78 corresponding to external turning point is larger than interaction radius @xmath10 , we take @xmath79 and @xmath80 in eq .",
    "( [ pc_eq ] ) . for @xmath81 , it is naturally to start our treatment with @xmath82 and @xmath83 defined by the kinetic energy at @xmath84 . in this case",
    "the friction hinders the classical motion towards smaller @xmath14 . if @xmath80 at @xmath85 , the friction almost does not play a role in the transition through the barrier",
    "thus , two regimes of interaction at sub - barrier energies differ by the action of nuclear forces and the role of friction at @xmath86 .",
    "besides the parameters related to the nucleus - nucleus potential , two parameters @xmath87 mev and @xmath88 mev are used for calculating the capture probability .",
    "all calculated results are obtained with the same set of parameters and are rather insensitive to the reasonable variation of them @xcite .    in figs .  3 - 5 the calculated capture cross sections for the reactions @xmath6o,@xmath7ne,@xmath13ca+@xmath8pb are in a good agreement with the available experimental data @xcite .",
    "there is sharp fall - off of the cross sections just under the barrier . with decreasing @xmath2 up to about 3.5 - 5.0 mev below the coulomb barrier the regime of interaction",
    "is changed because at external turning point the colliding nuclei do not reach the region of nuclear interaction where the friction plays a role . as a result , at smaller @xmath2 the cross sections fall with smaller rate . with larger value of @xmath10",
    "the change of fall rate would occur at smaller @xmath2 . however , the uncertainty in definition of @xmath10 is rather small . therefore , the effect of the change of fall rate of sub - barrier fusion cross section should be in the data if we believe that friction start to act only when the colliding nuclei approach the barrier .",
    "note that at energies of 5 mev below the barrier the experimental data have still large uncertainties to make a firm experimental conclusion about this effect .",
    "the effect seems to be more pronounced in the collisions of spherical nuclei .",
    "the collisions of deformed nuclei occurs at various mutual orientations from which the value of @xmath10 depends .",

    "the dependence of @xmath90 of @xmath2 is rather weak .",
    "the similar weak dependence has been found in ref .",
    "@xcite at extreme sub - barrier region .",
    "note that the found behavior of @xmath90 , which is related to the change of the regime of interaction between the colliding nuclei , would affect the angular anisotropy of the products of fission following fusion .    in fig .",
    "6 the functions @xmath91 and @xmath92 , and the fusion barrier distribution @xmath93 are presented for the @xmath6o+@xmath8pb reaction .",
    "the logarithmic derivative strongly increases just below the barrier and then has a maximum .",
    "this leads to the maximum of @xmath0-factor which is seen in the experiments @xcite .",

    "the same behavior has been revealed in refs .",
    "@xcite by extracting the @xmath0-factor from the experimental data .",
    "if for finding the logarithmic derivative we use only the cross sections calculated at the energies where the experimental cross sections are available , the function @xmath91 would be similar to that obtained with the experimental data @xcite .",
    "therefore , the energy increment in ref .",
    "@xcite seems to be too large to extract a function @xmath91 with a very narrow maximum .",
    "this increment should be at least 0.2 mev .",
    "the fusion barrier distribution calculated with this small energy increment has only one maximum .",
    "using larger energy increment of 0.6 mev , one can get few oscillations in @xmath93 .",
    "the quantum diffusion approach has been applied to study the capture or fusion cross sections at sub - barrier energies .",
    "the available experimental data at energies above and below the coulomb barrier are well described . due to the change of the regime of interaction ( the turning - off the nuclear forces and friction ) at sub - barrier energies ,",
    "the decrease rate of the cross sections is changed at about 3.5 - 5.0 mev below the barrier .",
    "this change is reflected in the functions @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 .",
    "the average angular momentum of compound nucleus versus @xmath2 would have a minimum and then saturation at sub - barrier energies .",
    "this behavior of @xmath90 would increase the expected anisotropy of angular distribution of the products of fission following fusion .",
