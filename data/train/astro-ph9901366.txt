    "the art of modelling the cosmic velocity field , which originates from the desire to interpret observed deviations from a uniform hubble expansion , has developed rapidly over the past few years .",
    "there are two main reasons for this .",
    "one is an increase in the quantity and quality of measured galaxy peculiar velocities .",
    "the other is the advent of nearly all  sky , flux  limited , redshift surveys that allow self  consistent theoretical predictions to be made with the requisite accuracy .",
    "although other possibilities have been proposed ( e.g. babul 1994 ) , the gravitational instability theory ( peebles 1980 ) has proven to be the most successful theoretical framework in which to interpret peculiar velocity data in relation to inhomogeneities in the mass distribution .",
    "early attempts to account for observed velocities within this general framework were rather simplistic due to incomplete knowledge of the distribution of galaxies in the local universe .",
    "thus , simple parametric models were developed to describe cosmic flows in terms of infall onto one or more spherical overdensities such as the virgo cluster , the great attractor or the perseus pisces supercluster ( davis and peebles 1983 , lynden  bell 1987 , peebles 1988 , han and mould 1990 ) .",
    "the situation changed dramatically when statistically complete , nearly all  sky , redshift catalogues of galaxies were constructed since it then became possible to predict peculiar velocities directly , assuming that luminous objects trace the underlying density field in some fashion .",
    "since then , several modelling procedures have been developed which are generally based on the simplifying assumption that the gravitating mass is distributed just like the tracer objects ( galaxies or clusters ) , although the relative amplitude of the deviations from uniformity , usually called the bias , is taken to be a free parameter .",
    "in addition to this  linear bias model , \" current methods also assume gravitational instability in the linear or mildly nonlinear regime ( e.g. yahil 1991 , kaiser 1991 , nusser and davis 1994 , fisher et al .",
    "1995b , sigad 1998 ) , and so require smoothing over scales where non - linear effects are important .",
    "this necessitates the additional assumption that smoothing a distribution that has evolved to a nonlinear state gives a result that can be modeled by linear or quasilinear evolution from smoothed initial conditions .",
    "because of their large sky coverage , the most extensively used redshift surveys are those based on the  point source catalogue \" ( psc ) of iras galaxies ( e.g. the 1.9 jy survey of strauss 1990 , the upgraded 1.2 jy catalogue of fisher 1995a , or the deeper but sparser qdot survey of rowan ",
    "robinson 1990 ) .",
    "other catalogues containing different kinds of objects such as optically selected galaxies ( e.g. shaya , tully and pierce 1990 , hudson 1994 , baker 1998 ) or clusters of galaxies ( scaramella 1995 branchini and plionis 1996 ) have also been used to produce model velocity fields on scales up to 200 . ]",
    "comparison of a model velocity field with directly measured peculiar velocities provides a means to constrain the density parameter , @xmath6 , while also testing the gravitational instability hypothesis and the assumed biasing scheme . a successful model for the peculiar velocity field",
    "may be used to recover the distribution of galaxies or clusters in real space , directly from their measured redshifts .",
    "this , in turn , allows investigation of the statistical properties of the objects distribution , free from the effects of redshift space distortions .",
    "overall , model velocity fields constructed using different surveys have proved to be remarkably consistent with one another ( freudling , da costa and pellegrini 1994 , baker et al .",
    "1998 ) and have succeeded in reproducing most of the characteristics exhibited by maps made directly from observed peculiar velocities .",
    "there are , however , two notable exceptions : the large bulk motion on very large scales claimed by lauer and postman ( 1994 ) and a dipolar coherence in the residuals between the velocity field obtained from the mark iii catalogue ( willick 1997 ) and the iras 1.2jy gravity field on scales of @xmath750 ( davis , nusser and willick 1996 ) .    here",
    "we present a new nonparametric model of the cosmic velocity field based on the recently completed survey of iras galaxies .",
    "this is the last of the nearly all - sky redshift surveys based on the iras catalogue and supersedes both the 1.2jy and the qdot catalogues which it contains .",
    "the denser sampling and lower flux limit of the survey allows us to model the peculiar velocity field on larger scales than was possible before without excessive contamination from shot noise .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in ",
    "2 we describe the dataset as well as two other redshift catalogues that we use to construct independent model velocity fields .",
    "two methods for generating the peculiar velocity fields have been implemented in order to keep track of systematic errors .",
    "these are presented in  3 , together with a detailed error analysis .",
    "a cosmographic tour is performed in  4 , along with a consistency check between the two velocity models and a comparison between the and 1.2jy model velocity fields . in  5 we take advantage of the large depth of the survey to compare the gravity field derived from it with the one derived from the distribution of abell / aco clusters .",
    "an estimate of the parameter @xmath8 , where @xmath4 is the linear bias parameter of iras galaxies , is obtained in  6 by comparing observed and predicted bulk velocity vectors . in  7",
    "we discuss our results further and summarise our main conclusions .",
    "the main dataset used in this work is the recently completed redshift survey described in detail by saunders ( 1998a ) .",
    "the catalogue contains some 15,500 iras psc galaxies with 60 @xmath9 flux , @xmath10 .",
    "the construction of the catalogue is described in detail in saunders ( 1998a ) and so we only summarize here its main features .",
    "the selection of potential galaxies from the psc emphasised completeness at the expense of contamination by cirrus , stars , agn , etc . because the completeness of the psc is not guaranteed to 0.6jy in 2hcon areas ( beichman 1988 , psc explanatory supplement ) ,",
    "we added to the psc any 1hcon detections from the point source catalogue reject file with fss counterparts ( moshir etal 1989 ) .",
    "we then selected sources with @xmath11 ( to eliminate the vast majority of cirrus sources ) and @xmath12 ( to eliminate the vast majority of stars ) .",
    "residual contamination was eliminated by a combination of optical identification on schmidt plates , examination of the raw iras addscan profile , information from the simbad database and , where still unclear , optical spectroscopy .",
    "large galaxies can have their flux underestimated by the iras beam , so we constructed an all - sky list of optically - selected galaxies with extinction - corrected diameters larger than @xmath13 .",
    "the psc detections for these galaxies were flagged for deletion .",
    "the optical catalogue was addscanned by ipac , and we used software provided by amos yahil to derive fluxes from the addscan profiles , and where the flux was sufficient , added them to the catalogue .",
    "for our purposes , one of the most important properties of the catalogue is its large sky coverage .",
    "the only excluded regions are two thin strips in ecliptic longitude that were not observed by iras , the magellanic clouds , and the area in the galactic plane where the b  band extinction , @xmath14 , exceeds 2 magnitudes .",
    "the extinction is estimated from the 100 @xmath9 background , and includes a correction for the estimated temperature gradient in the milky way ( saunders 1998a ) .",
    "overall , the catalogue covers @xmath15 of the sky . although we will occasionally consider galaxies with recession velocity as large as 30000 , for the most part we will restrict our analysis to the subsample of 11206 galaxies within 20000 in the local group ( lg ) frame .",
    "the distribution on the sky of galaxies in shown in galactic coordinates ( aitoff projection ) in the upper part of fig .  1 .    for comparison purposes",
    ", we have also applied our analysis to the similar , but shallower , iras 1.2jy redshift survey ( fisher 1995a ) .",
    "galaxies in this catalogue were also selected from the iras psc but using a higher ( addscan ) flux limit , @xmath16 jy , and different criteria for minimizing contamination by galactic cirrus .",
    "this catalogue has a somewhat larger sky coverage of @xmath17 . here",
    "we will use the 4939 iras 1.2 jy galaxies within 20000 of the local group .",
    "finally , in an attempt to extend our analysis , we use a completely different set of mass tracers consisting of a volume  limited sample of optically  selected galaxy clusters extracted from the abell ( 1958 ) and the abell , corwin & olowin ( 1989 ; hereafter aco ) catalogues .",
    "these were combined into a single homogeneous catalogue using the clusters in common between the two samples , according to the prescription described by branchini and plionis ( 1996 ; hereafter bp96 ) .",
    "the sample has a limiting depth of 250 and contains 493 clusters of richness class @xmath18 at @xmath19 , and @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the magnitude of the tenth brightest galaxy in the cluster .",
    "the number of galaxies in a flux limited sample decreases with distance , as may be seen in the lower plot of fig .  2 , for the ( upper histogram ) and 1.2 jy ( lower , shaded histogram ) surveys .",
    "we define a selection function , @xmath22 , as the fraction of galaxies that can be seen out to a redshift distance @xmath23 ( expressed in ) , given the survey flux limit . to determine @xmath22 we use the parametric maximum likelihood estimate proposed by yahil ( 1991 ) , in which the following analytic form for the selection function is assumed :",
    "@xmath24 the value of the normalization constant , @xmath25 , does not affect the modeling of peculiar velocities .",
    "in this paper we arbitrarily set @xmath26 if @xmath27 with @xmath28 .",
    "this choice is equivalent to imposing a lower cutoff in the 60 @xmath9 luminosity which , in turn , avoids giving too much weight to faint , nearby iras galaxies that may not trace the galaxy distribution reliably in the nearby volume ( rowan robinson 1990 ) .",
    "the relevant parameters have been determined via likelihood analysis using only the objects within 100 .",
    "the results are displayed in table  1 for the and 1.2jy surveys , both in redshift ( z- ) and real ( r- ) space ( i.e. after correction for redshift space distortions as discussed in  3.1 ) .",
    "the number density of galaxies as a function of redshift distance , predicted by eqn .",
    "( 1 ) , is shown in the lower part of fig .  2 , superimposed on the observed @xmath29 histograms .",
    "the theoretical curves provide a good description of the data .",
    "the ratio of the number of observed to the number of expected galaxies gives the radial overdensity field , shown in the upper part of figure  2 for both the ( thick line ) and the iras 1.2jy catalogues .",
    "a horizontal line is drawn at the mean density .",
    "the radial density fields traced by the two surveys are consistent with one another , but the larger shot noise in the 1.2 jy sample makes the amplitude of density fluctuations larger than in the survey at large radii .",
    "our estimator for the selection function is independent of clustering but requires prior knowledge of the evolutionary rate .",
    "springel and white ( 1998 ) have recently developed a new technique to estimate the rate of evolution of the selection function .",
    "for the 1.2jy catalogue they find rather strong evolution and this is even more dramatic in the catalogue ( springel 1996 ) .",
    "ignoring this effect could introduce spurious streaming motions in the model velocity field .",
    "however , we have verified that our selection function for is very similar to the one derived by springel ( 1996 ) within the scales relevant to our analysis .",
    "the difference between the two selection functions increases with distance but it is only 5% at 200 .",
    "strong evolutionary effects become important only beyond these scales and we shall therefore ignore them in our modeling .    for the abell / aco composite sample",
    "we adopt the selection function derived by bp96 : @xmath30 the estimated values of the parameters are listed in table  2 , and the expected number of clusters as a function of redshift distance is shown in the lower plot of fig .  2 as a thick line .",
    "the mean separation , @xmath31 , of the objects in a population of tracers limits the intrinsic resolution with which we the population probes the underlying cosmic fields .",
    "thus , @xmath32 , is a natural smoothing length which keeps the shot noise at a constant level . in a magnitude",
    "limited survey , @xmath31 increases with distance @xmath33 according to : @xmath34^{-1/3 } , \\label{eq : smooth}\\ ] ] where the average number density of objects @xmath35 has been estimated as @xmath36 and the sum extends over all @xmath37 objects contained within the volume sampled , @xmath38 .",
    "the value of the average number density within 100 , computed in redshift and real space , is shown in table  1 both for the and iras 1.2 jy catalogues .",
    "the more physically meaningful values of the mean galaxy separation at 100 , @xmath39 expressed in @xmath40 mpc@xmath41 , are also given in the table .",
    "because of our normalization ( @xmath42 within 6 ) , our estimate of @xmath35 for the 1.2 jy galaxies is slightly different from that of fisher ( 1995a ) .",
    "3 shows the mean interobject separation as a function of @xmath33 for the three samples considered . because of the shallower depth of the 1.2jy sample , its intergalaxy separation increases much more steeply with distance than in the sample .",
    "thus , at a fixed resolution , the survey probes cosmic structures out to larger distances than the 1.2 jy survey without an increase in shot noise .",
    "the dot  dashed line in fig .",
    "3 shows the abell / aco mean intercluster separation .",
    "locally , this is much larger than the corresponding separation in the galaxy surveys , but on scales above 170 , clusters start to become more effective than iras 1.2jy galaxies in tracing the cosmic density fields .",
    "the main aim of this paper is to obtain a self  consistent , non  parametric model of the velocity field in the local universe ( i.e. for @xmath43 ) .",
    "we do this by removing the redshift space distortions that affect the observed radial galaxy distribution in the survey using two different procedures .",
    "the first is the iterative technique devised by strauss & davis ( 1988 ) , applied by yahil ( 1991 ) , and further refined by sigad ( 1998 ) .",
    "the results presented here were obtained by applying the original yahil ( 1991 ) technique .",
    "the second procedure , used here primarily as a check for possible systematic effects , is the non  iterative technique developed by nusser and davis ( 1994 ) .",
    "the two procedures that we have implemented rely on three important assumptions .",
    "firstly , cosmic structures are assumed to have grown by gravitational amplification of small amplitude fluctuations present in the density field at early times ( gravitational instability , c.f .",
    "peebles 1980 ) .",
    "secondly , fluctuations on the scales of interest are assumed to be small enough that linear ( or mildly non - linear ) theory is applicable .",
    "thirdly , luminous objects ( galaxies or clusters ) are assumed to trace the underlying mass density field according to : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the mass overdensity at position @xmath46 , @xmath47 is the fluctuation in the number of luminous objects at this same location , and @xmath48 is the biasing parameter .",
    "( 5 ) is often referred to as the  linear biasing model . \"",
    "the reconstruction methods return a model of the cosmic velocity field that depends on the parameter @xmath49 .",
    "the value of @xmath50 must be determined _ a posteriori _ by comparison with other observational data .",
    "the two reconstruction techniques that we use are extensively discussed and tested by branchini ( 1998 ) where the reader may find further details . here",
    ", we simply outline the main principles of each method .",
    "* method 1 : the iterative technique *    in linear theory the overdensity is related to the peculiar velocity field by @xmath51 the model velocity field is then obtained by iteratively solving the system of equations : @xmath52 and @xmath53 eqn ( [ eq : vir ] ) follows from integrating eqn  ( [ eq : vdr ] ) ; @xmath54 is the peculiar velocity of a tracer object at position given by the radial unit vector @xmath55 ; and @xmath56 is the velocity of the local group .    during each iteration",
    ", the selection function and the mean number density of the population of displaced objects are recomputed .",
    "eqns  ( [ eq : vdr ] ) and  ( [ eq : vir ] ) are only valid in the linear regime and so the force field needs to be smoothed to eliminate nonlinear effects .",
    "we employ a  top hat \" filter with a smoothing radius @xmath57 $ ] .",
    "this choice eliminates most of the nonlinear contributions and keeps the shot noise at a constant level . to improve numerical convergence , we adiabatically increase the value of @xmath50 at each of ten iterations , from 0.1 to 1.0 ( strauss 1992b ) .",
    "note that the amplitude of the velocity vectors scales , to first order , linearly with @xmath50 .",
    "unless otherwise stated , all the plots of the model velocity fields that we present assume @xmath58 .    around high density regions , such as clusters",
    ", there may be triple  valued regions in which the same redshift is observed at three different positions along a given line - of - sight .",
    "we correct for this by collapsing the galaxies within clusters and implementing the  robust procedure \" (  method  2 \" ) of yahil ( 1991 ) to determine the locations of galaxies within triple  valued regions . for the collapsing procedure ,",
    "we have used two different datasets : the six nearest clusters listed in table  2 of yahil ( 1991 ) and a larger catalogue of 61 objects obtained by merging the 59 smac clusters of hudson ( 1998 ) with the yahil ( 1991 ) dataset .",
    "the results show that the collapsing procedure only affects the infall pattern around rich clusters .",
    "however , with the level of smoothing used here , the effect is negligible and no systematic differences are found when the model velocity fields are compared on a point  by  point basis .",
    "* method 2 : spherical harmonics expansion *    this procedure is based on the method proposed by nusser and davis ( 1994 ) . in linear theory , the velocity field in redshift space is irrotational and thus may be derived from a velocity potential : @xmath59 expanding the potential and the galaxy density field , @xmath60 , in spherical harmonics , and using the zeldovich approximation , it can be seen that the two fields obey a poisson  like equation : @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 are the spherical harmonic coefficients of the galaxy density and velocity potential fields respectively .",
    "we have considered the coefficients up to @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "we employ a gaussian filter with smoothing radius @xmath66 $ ] , compute the coefficients @xmath62 in redshift shells for the different catalogues , solve eqn .",
    "( [ eq : nd ] ) for @xmath63 , and then compute the full three  dimensional velocity field in redshift space using eqn .",
    "( [ eq : irr ] ) .",
    "galaxy positions and peculiar velocities at the real space positions , @xmath67 , are obtained by assuming a one  to ",
    "one mapping between the real and redshift space positions , @xmath67 and @xmath68 , along the line - of - sight .",
    "we minimize the problem of triple  valued regions by adopting the same cluster  collapsing scheme used above .",
    "redshift space distortions are only one of several effects that hamper the recovery of cosmic density and velocity fields from observational data .",
    "incomplete sky coverage is another , potentially serious , problem and we deal with it using a filling method similar to that introduced by yahil ( 1991 ) .",
    "we use their original technique to fill in the region at galactic latitude @xmath69 , but each real galaxy at @xmath70 is included to replace a synthetic object that resides in the same longitude  distance bin .",
    "masked regions at larger galactic latitudes are filled in with a random distribution of synthetic galaxies having the observed mean number density .",
    "tests performed by branchini ( 1998 ) using the mock catalogues described in the next section show that the only bias introduced by this filling in technique is a spurious bulk motion of @xmath71 ( see  6.1 ) . as a further check",
    "we have also used the new fourier interpolation technique developed by saunders et al .",
    "( 1998b ) , which interpolates structure across the mask under the assumption that the density field of galaxies is a lognormal random field . in doing this ,",
    "we have used a ` tapered ' , or radially - dependent , mask to take into account the known incompleteness in the at large distances ( @xmath72 ) and low latitudes ( @xmath73 ) , due to difficulties in making secure identifications and obtaining redshifts for obscured distant galaxies .",
    "the area of sky across which we interpolate is defined by @xmath74 at @xmath75 , increasing to @xmath76 at @xmath77 . outside this volume ,",
    "the is essentially complete .",
    "the model velocities predicted using this mask turned out to be almost identical to the ones obtained using the simpler filling in procedure described above .",
    "another source of random and systematic error is the radial selection function which , when coupled to redshift distortions , generates the so called rocket effect discussed by kaiser and lahav ( 1989 ) .",
    "this is a spurious acceleration measured from a magnitude - limited sample of galaxies by an observer who has a peculiar velocity unrelated to the true gravitational acceleration . in method  1",
    "this effect is quantified and corrected for using the mock catalogues discussed below . in method",
    "2 the rocket effect is explicitly accounted for by the second term in the right - hand side of eqn .",
    "( [ eq : nd ] ) .    finally , another potential source of bias is the fact that iras galaxies are preferentially of late morphological type and are less clustered than early types ( strauss 1992a , hermit 1996 ) .",
    "however , any biases arising from this are likely to be small since baker ( 1998 ) have shown that the ratio of the amplitudes of iras and optical galaxy density fields , smoothed on scales @xmath78 , is almost constant , implying a ratio of linear biasing parameters of @xmath79 .      we have used a suite of large cosmological n - body simulations to generate mock galaxy catalogues that mimic the main properties of the and 1.2jy redshift surveys .",
    "we use these to quantify random and systematic errors in our reconstructed velocity fields . for the fields inferred from cluster catalogues , we adopt the error estimates derived by bp96 and by branchini ( 1997 ) on the basis of a hybrid monte carlo / mock catalogue technique .",
    "the simulations we use are those described by cole ( 1998 ) .",
    "we consider two different cold dark matter cosmologies : a flat model with @xmath80 and cosmological constant term , @xmath81 , and a critical density universe ( @xmath82 ) with power spectrum shape parameter , @xmath83 . in both cases ,",
    "the fluctuation amplitude was normalized by the observed abundance of galaxy clusters .",
    "this requires setting @xmath84 ( eke , cole & frenk 1996 ) , where @xmath85 is the linear rms mass density fluctuation in top hat spheres of radius 8 .",
    "galaxies were identified with random particles from the simulations ( so that @xmath86 by construction ) . prior to generating the mock catalogues",
    ", we smoothed the velocities in the simulations using a top hat filter of radius 1.5 .",
    "this brings @xmath87 , the pairwise velocity dispersion of objects with projected separation @xmath88 , down to @xmath89 ( when only particles within 30 from the observer are considered ) .",
    "this value is in accordance with the recent analysis of the optical redshift survey of santiago ( 1995 , 1996 ) by strauss , ostriker and cen ( 1998 ) for galaxies outside high density regions . and with the estimate of @xmath87 for late type galaxies in the perseus ",
    "pisces redshift catalogue by guzzo ( 1997 ) .",
    "both these measurements refer to ` field ' galaxies , and are therefore well matched to the late type iras galaxies of the catalogue .    each mock catalogue",
    "is contained in a sphere of radius 170 and , for the purposes of error analyses , 10 nearly independent mock catalogues were obtained from each cosmological model .",
    "several constraints were applied in order to obtain mass distributions and velocity fields as similar as possible to those observed :    \\1 ) local group observers .",
    "hypothetical observers were selected from the set of particles with velocity , @xmath90 , lying in regions in which the shear within 5 is smaller than 200 and the fractional overdensity within the same scale ranges between -0.2 and 1.0 ( brown and peebles 1987 ) .",
    "these constraints mimic the local group environment .",
    "\\2 ) coherent galaxy dipole . a galactic coordinate system , @xmath91 , in the ( periodic ) computational volume was defined such that the velocity of the observer pointed towards @xmath92 , the direction of the dipole anisotropy observed in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation .",

    "the agreement between the fields can be better appreciated from the two lower plots .",

    ", a smoothing radius of 6 corresponds to the average galaxy separation at @xmath94 , i.e to the maximum distance out to which comparisons with observed peculiar velocities are still possible .",
    "the drawback of using a constant smoothing is that the shot noise increases with distance , artificially enhancing the density contrast in the outer regions , as may be seen in fig .  4 .",
    "with our adopted smoothing , the average shot noise in @xmath95 at a distance of 80is @xmath96 , rapidly increasing to @xmath97 % at 120 . a complete description of the mock catalogues , their use for error estimation and a detailed assessment of the reliability of our galaxy reconstruction methods is given in branchini ( 1998 ) .",
    "the corresponding analysis for the abell / aco cluster catalogues may be found in branchini ( 1997 ) .",

    "we analyse the data using method  1 above .",
    "visualizing three dimensional structures and the corresponding vector fields , is not easy .",
    "fortunately from this point of view , the most interesting structures in the nearby universe , on scales larger than the local supercluster , are roughly distributed along a planar structure , de vaucouleurs ( 1953 ) supergalactic plane ( at supergalactic coordinates sgz@xmath98 ) . in this analysis",
    "we will mainly follow the custom of displaying the density and velocity features in a two dimensional slice through this plane .",

    "this variable smoothing filter was chosen to maintain a roughly constant sampling error over the large range of scales considered .",
    "it represents a compromise between resolution in the inner regions and acceptable shot noise errors near the edge .",
    "the drawback is that , unlike the case of constant smoothing , the density contrast decreases with distance , as is clear from the map .",

    "the two methods succeed in reproducing the main features that we have already highlighted : remarkable large - scale coherence in the velocity field , clear infall patterns onto coma , perseus  pisces and the great attractor but no back - infall onto the latter .",
    "the only noticeable difference is that method  2 seems to blur slightly the sharp features ( like the cetus ridge ) produced by method  1 in the velocity field .",
    "quantitative evidence for the similarity of the two model fields is provided in the lower part of fig  8 , which shows a scatterplot of the sgy cartesian components of the reconstructed velocity fields , smoothed with a 6gaussian , measured within 80 . for both model velocity fields",
    "we have used @xmath58 . in the plots we show only 1000 points taken at random from the 73490 available .",
    "the peculiar velocities in the two models should obey the linear equation , @xmath121 where @xmath122 and @xmath123 denote any of the cartesian components of the peculiar velocity predicted by methods  1 and  2 , respectively , and @xmath124 is expected to be 1 if no systematic errors are present .",
    "the offset @xmath25 allows for possible differences in the predicted bulk flows in the two models .",
    "we obtain the values of @xmath25 and @xmath124 by minimizing @xmath125 where @xmath126 and @xmath127 are the errors in the velocities at a generic gridpoint @xmath128 in the two methods , and @xmath129 is the total number of points used for the comparison .",
    "we assume that @xmath130 , so that eqn .",
    "(  [ eq : chi2a ] ) becomes @xmath131 only @xmath132 of the @xmath129 points used in the comparison are independent .",
    "it can be shown that the quantity @xmath133 is approximately distributed as @xmath134 with @xmath135 degrees of freedom ( e.g. hudson 1995 ) .",
    "we can therefore approximately evaluate @xmath3 by setting @xmath136 so that @xmath137 we take @xmath132 to be the number of independent volumes within the volume sampled . with our smoothing radius , @xmath138 .",
    "we then find a regression slope , b@xmath139 .",
    "the zero point , a@xmath140 , indicates a systematic difference in the sgy component of the bulk velocity in the two models .",
    "this offset is only evident when the two velocity fields are compared in the cmb frame and almost disappears in the local group ( lg ) frame .",
    "as explained in  3 , the peculiar velocities are reconstructed in the lg frame .",
    "transformation to this frame is performed by adding the reconstructed lg velocity at each galaxy position .",
    "this can lead to systematic differences if the lg velocities predicted by the two methods do not agree .",
    "indeed , the zero point offset measured in the velocity  velocity scatterplot for the three cartesian components , ( -123,-47,132)@xmath50 , is similar to the difference between the predicted lg velocities in the two models , ( -150,-50,98)@xmath50 .",
    "no other systematic errors are detected as the regression slopes are close to one also for the two remaining components ( @xmath141 for sgx and @xmath142 for sgz . ) for the sgx and sgz components , the dispersions around the fit are only slightly larger than for sgy ( @xmath143 respectively . )",
    "this represents the intrinsic error in the reconstruction and is nearly a factor of 2 smaller than the average total error derived from the error analysis on the mock catalogues ( which also accounts for uncertainties in the filling in procedure , nonlinearity , finite volume effects , etc ) by branchini ( 1998 ) .",
    "since they were drawn from the same parent catalogue , we expect the and 1.2jy catalogues to give consistent model velocity fields , at least in the nearby volume where the sampling by 1.2jy galaxies is not too sparse . in analogy with the fields displayed in fig .  6 , fig .",
    "9 shows the 1.2jy density and velocity fields , smoothed with a 6gaussian , in a slice through the supergalactic plane .",
    "most of the characteristic structures previously identified in fig .  6 are also visible in fig .",
    "9 except that underdense regions in the 1.2jy map appear somewhat more extended than in the map .",
    "the overall pattern in the velocity field is reproduced in the 1.2jy map although the large - scale coherent flow along the camelopardalis , great attractor baseline is less evident in the latter . on the other hand ,",
    "the infall pattern around the great attractor in the 1.2jy survey spreads out over a larger region .",
    "these discrepancies might well be due to the larger shot noise in the 1.2jy catalogue .",
    "our 1.2jy model velocity field is consistent with that derived independently by webster , lahav and fisher ( 1997 ) using the method developed by fisher ( 1995b ) .",
    "comparison with their fig .  7d ( which assumes a cdm model with @xmath144 as a prior in the wiener filtering procedure ) reveals only one noticeable difference between the two maps .",
    "this is in the region of the great attractor , where the model of webster predicts a weak back - infall .",
    "the discrepancy , however , is small and may simply reflect our use of a constant 6gaussian smoothing , which is somewhat larger than the smoothing applied by webster    the lower part of fig  10 displays the difference between the and the iras 1.2jy overdensity fields , displayed in figs .  6 and 9 respectively , @xmath145 .",
    "positive ( continuous lines ) and negative ( dashed lines ) contours are shown , with the thick line delineating the @xmath146 contour .",
    "the main discrepancies between the two fields occur within the zone - of - avoidance , in the great attractor region and beyond . outside the galactic plane ,",
    "the radially increasing shot noise is responsible for the large discrepancies seen in the outer regions .",
    "apart from these local features , we notice that the mean value of @xmath147 , @xmath148 , is positive in the region shown in the figure .",
    "indeed , this is true within the entire spherical volume of radius 70 in which we find @xmath149 and @xmath150 @xmath40mpc@xmath41 ( for both catalogues the average density has been measured within 100 ) .",
    "if the errors were due to sparse sampling alone , then this discrepancy would be significant at about the @xmath151 level .",
    "however , the errors in the estimates of the average density are larger than this . in particular , as pointed out by davis , strauss and yahil ( 1991 ) , the intimate coupling between the estimation of the selection function and the average density itself generates uncertainties in the reconstructed average density which are large enough to account for the discrepancy we have detected .",
    "the mismatch in the average densities on a scale of 70 generates the infall pattern visible in the upper panel of fig  10 , while smaller scale features originate from local mismatches between the two density fields .",
    "11 ( lower panel ) shows a more quantitative comparison between the and 1.2jy overdensity fields , both smoothed with a 6gaussian and tabulated onto 64@xmath152 grids .",
    "the comparison is made in the cmb frame and assumes @xmath58 .",
    "only those gridpoints within 80 of the lg position are considered . as in the previous section ,",
    "we fit a straight line to the data and estimate the parameters by minimizing @xmath134 .",
    "the slope of this line is @xmath153 , indicating that there are no systematic differences between the two density fields .",
    "the negative zero point offset , @xmath154 , reflects the discrepancy between the average densities of the two catalogues discussed in the preceding paragraph ( @xmath155 ) .",
    "the scatter @xmath156 is similar to the average shot noise at the gridpoint positions both for ( @xmath157 ) and for the iras 1.2 jy ( @xmath158 ) catalogues .",
    "similar considerations apply to the velocity  velocity comparison in the upper panel in which , as in fig  8 , we only show the sgy cartesian component of the velocity .",
    "the comparison , performed in the cmb frame , assumes @xmath58 .",
    "there is a non  negligible zero point offset of @xmath159 which is comparable to the difference between the sgy components of the predicted lg velocities for two catalogues ( @xmath160 ) .",
    "the dispersion around the fit , @xmath161 , is again similar to the average shot noise in the peculiar velocities , computed as in yahil ( 1991 ) ( @xmath162 for and @xmath163 for iras 1.2jy ) .",
    "similar results are found from the scatterplots of the two remaining cartesian components .",
    "their slopes are consistent with unity ( @xmath164 and @xmath165 for sgx and sgz respectively ) and the zero point offsets are comparable to the discrepancies arising from the transformation from lg to cmb frames ( @xmath166 and @xmath167 ) .    finally , tadros ( 1998 ) have recently suggested that the catalogue should not be used down to 0.6 jy and that a more conservative cut in flux , 0.745 jy , should be adopted instead . to check whether possible incompleteness at the low flux limit could affect the modeling of the velocity field we have generated several different models for density and velocity fields using a suite of subcatalogues taken at different flux limits . with",
    "a 0.75 jy cut the density and velocity fields are still remarkably similar to those with the cut at 0.6jy .",
    "increasing the flux limit makes the density and velocity fields more and more like the iras 1.2 jy fields with which they almost coincide when the cut is taken at 1.2 jy .",
    "overall , our prediction for the velocity and density fields are robust and are not affected by incompleteness in the catalogue at low flux levels , at least within a region of 200 .",
    "the sampling density of the survey is high enough to allow investigation of the density field out to @xmath168 even with a 6gaussian smoothing .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "12 which displays the usual section of the density and velocity model along the supergalactic plane .",
    "the shot noise in this map is the same as in the maps discussed in  4.1 .",
    "the larger volume reveals the full extent of the coherent streaming involving galaxies from the camelopardalis supercluster all the way to the shapley concentration ( that begins to become visible at @xmath169 ) , passing through the local supercluster and the great attractor .",
    "the dynamical sources of the coherent motion seen in fig .",
    "12 are the same ones that we identified earlier as being responsible for the flow pattern behind the great attractor .",
    "the gravitational pull is mostly due to the shapley concentration , but the coherence is aided by the combined push of the two large voids ( at @xmath170 and @xmath171 ) that straddle the ridge and were only partially visible in fig .  6 .",
    "this map also reveals a large extension to other underdense regions , the sculptor void and the two connected voids behind the cetus  perseus ",
    "pisces  camelopardalis complex .    in fig .",
    "13 we show slices along four planes parallel to the supergalactic plane , at sgz@xmath172 and sgz@xmath173 . fig .",
    "14 shows the corresponding velocity fields .",
    "the same structures that we had identified in fig .",
    "7 can now be traced over larger scales .",
    "the shot noise is still small and so we can fully appreciate the large scale coherence of features in both the density and velocity fields . for example , figs .  13a and  13b show that the void that we had identified in the upper half of fig .",
    "7b actually extends over a much larger volume .",
    "similarly , the stream towards ( sgx , sgy)=(-50,50 ) that we had identified in the sgz=0 and sgz=+40 planes persists at sgz=+80 .",
    "no very large scale features are present in the plane at sgz=-40 ( fig.13c and 14c ) which , as we had previously noted , is dominated by a few isolated infall patterns onto the southern extensions of the pavo  indus  telescopium and perseus ",
    "pisces superclusters .",
    "new large coherent structures , however , begin to appear again in the plane at sgz=-80 .",
    "various surveys of iras and optical galaxies have been used to construct model velocity fields which proved to be remarkably consistent with one another ( yahil 1991 , kaiser 1991 , hudson 1994 , baker 1998 ) .",
    "we carry out a similar exercise here , using a completely different set of mass tracers , the abell / aco clusters . with these we can model the density and velocity fields out to very large scales , albeit with much larger sampling errors .",
    "bp96 have already employed the same abell / aco cluster subsample described in  2 to model the density and velocity fields out to 250 .",
    "the reconstruction technique they used is a simplified version of our method  1 ( cf .",
    " 3.1 ) in which the selection function ( which is nearly constant on the scales of interest ) is not iteratively updated , no special treatment is given to triple  valued regions and the procedure for filling in the zone - of - avoidance ( @xmath174 ) is the one used by yahil ( 1991 ) . in order to compare the and cluster model fields we smooth both with a gaussian filter of width 20 .",
    "such a large smoothing is required because of the large intercluster separation .",
    "15 shows the smoothed density fields along the supergalactic plane , within a distance of 150 , derived from the ( upper panel ) and cluster ( lower panel ) catalogues .",
    "overdensity contours are plotted in steps of @xmath175 for the galaxy field , and of @xmath176 for the cluster field .",
    "this is equivalent to rescaling the cluster field by a factor @xmath177 which , as we shall see in  5.2 below , is our estimate for the relative linear bias parameter between iras galaxies and galaxy clusters .",
    "as before , the heavy line traces the @xmath178 contour .",
    "the dashed lines show the approximate location of the zone - of - avoidance in the ( @xmath179 ) and cluster ( @xmath174 ) samples .    despite the @xmath177 rescaling",
    ", the density peaks appear more prominent in the cluster sample than in the map . this may reflect more severe undersampling of the cores of rich clusters by iras galaxies than was indicated by baker ( 1998 ) , or it may be due to shot noise in the cluster sample which , in spite of the heavy smoothing , is still substantial .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the great attractor region @xmath180 and the perseus ",
    "pisces supercluster @xmath181 , where the effect is strongest , both lie within the zone - of - avoidance of the cluster sample .",
    "it is therefore possible that the height of these peaks has been artificially amplified by the coupling between shot noise and the filling  in procedure .",
    "for this reason we shall exclude the region at @xmath174 from the quantitative analysis in  5.2 below .",
    "above @xmath182 the shapley concentration @xmath183 is the only peak with a larger amplitude in the cluster map than in the map .",
    "amplitudes aside , the positions of the peaks in the two density maps are very similar .",
    "the low density regions are also approximately coincident , although they are less extended in the cluster map in which voids also appear somewhat shallower .",
    "the latter effect simply reflects the fact that the assumption of local biasing , @xmath184 , breaks down at low @xmath185 because of the constraint @xmath186 .",
    "similar considerations apply outside the supergalactic plane .",
    "fig  16 extends the comparison between clusters ( left - hand side ) and galaxies ( right - hand side ) to four slices parallel to the supergalactic plane , at sgz=@xmath187 and sgz=@xmath188 .",
    "although some discrepancies in the position of peaks and voids exist , the large ",
    "scale features are remarkably similar across all the slices .",
    "in particular , the large overdense region at positive sgz is evident in both the clusters and density fields .",
    "unlike in the supergalactic plane , there appears to be no appreciable systematic difference between the amplitudes of density peaks of clusters and iras galaxies .",
    "17 shows the velocity fields inferred from the two samples , again with a 20gaussian smoothing , in a slice along the supergalactic plane .",
    "the amplitude of the velocity vectors is on an arbitrary scale but , for the clusters , the velocities have been rescaled by the factor @xmath177 .",
    "the two large overdensities lying within the zone - of - avoidance in the lower panel of fig .",
    "15 largely determine the infall patterns at those locations [ @xmath180 ] and [ @xmath181 ] . beyond @xmath191 , however , the galaxy and cluster velocity fields are very similar . both exhibit a large coherent flow along the camelopardalis , great attractor , shapley concentration baseline .",
    "the infall onto the shapley region is more prominent in the cluster map but , in general , the velocity field patterns are very similar at positive sgy , with an outflow at positive sgx , and a convergent flow towards the shapley concentration at negative sgx . below the zone - of - avoidance , at negative sgy , both maps show outflow from the sculptor void , but this is less prominent in the clusters map .",
    "note that a similar good agreement would have been obtained by considering the density ",
    "velocity maps by scaramella ( 1995 ) which also use the abell / aco cluster distribution .",
    "if biasing is a local process then , in the regime where mass fluctuations are small , we expect the amplitude of the bias to be independent of scale ( see e.g. cole 1998 ) .",
    "this expectation is consistent with the results of potent analyses performed by dekel ( 1993 ) and sigad ( 1998 ) and we expect it also to be valid in the present analysis in which the and cluster density and velocity fields have been smoothed with a 20gaussian filter .",
    "thus , on the scales of interest , we expect the two model density and velocity fields to be linearly related : @xmath192 where @xmath193 and @xmath194 stand for cluster and and represent either @xmath45 or any one of the cartesian components of the velocity field .",
    "the constant @xmath195 is the bias parameter of clusters relative to iras galaxies and @xmath196 allows for a relative offset in the mean density or bulk velocities of the two fields . for quantitative analyses",
    "it is most convenient to use the sgy cartesian component of the velocity field since this is the least affected by uncertainties in filling in the zone - of - avoidance . to estimate @xmath195 we adopt the strategy of hudson ( 1995 ) and branchini ( 1997 ) , already used in  4.2 , of regressing the two model fields by minimising the quantity @xmath197 where the subscript @xmath128 refers to any of the @xmath129 gridpoints within the comparison volume .",
    "the quantities @xmath198 and @xmath199 represent the errors in the cluster and fields , respectively .",
    "the errors in the cluster field , @xmath198 , have been estimated by branchini ( 1997 ) .",
    "they are the sum in quadrature of the intrinsic errors in the reconstruction procedure , as estimated by bp96 using montecarlo techniques , and the shot noise uncertainties which are dominant for the very sparse cluster fields .",
    "the latter were evaluated using the mock catalogue generated by kolatt ( 1996 ) which is designed to reproduce the distribution of structures in our local universe . a typical error in the cluster overdensity field is @xmath200 , and in the sgy  component of the velocity field it is @xmath201 .",
    "the errors in the fields have been estimated using the mock catalogues described in  3.2 .",
    "the basic procedure consists of comparing the density and velocity fields obtained by applying method  1 to the mock galaxy catalogues with the true fields in the parent n  body simulation .",
    "18 ( which is analogous to fig .",
    "4 ) compares the true and reconstructed density and velocity fields of a mock catalogue ( different from the one shown in fig .",
    "4 ) in a slice along the supergalactic plane ( upper panels ) .",
    "the maps of the density and velocity errors are shown in the lower panels .",
    "both fields are smoothed with a gaussian filter of radius 20 . as in fig .  4 ,",
    "the errors in the density and velocity reconstruction occur preferentially within the zone - of - avoidance .",
    "however , the correlation with the signal , which was present in the outer regions of fig .  4 , has been almost erased by the large smoothing .",
    "we have characterized the reconstruction errors by noticing that the residuals correlate with distance , galactic latitude and , for the velocity field , with the signal itself . from the analysis of the mock catalogues , we have derived two approximate expressions for the errors ( valid for @xmath202 : @xmath203 and @xmath204 where @xmath33 is the distance measured in ,",
    "@xmath4 is the galactic latitude in degrees ( not the linear biasing factor ) , and @xmath205 is the amplitude of the sgy cartesian component in .",
    "the actual assumed error at a gridpoint has been generated from a gaussian distribution centred on @xmath206 with dispersions of 0.04 for the overdensity and 40 for the @xmath207 field , respectively .",
    "the regression of the and cluster fields uses all the gridpoints within 120 and outside the cluster zone - of - avoidance ( i.e. at @xmath208 ) . as a result of the large smoothing applied ,",
    "not all the gridpoints in the comparison volume are independent .",
    "the number of independent points , @xmath132 , can be computed as in dekel ( 1993 ) , @xmath209 where @xmath210 is the separation between gridpoints @xmath128 and @xmath211 and @xmath212 is the smoothing radius of the gaussian filter .",
    "this expression has been derived for a smooth density field and its application to a velocity field requires some caveats . for a given comparison volume",
    ", the large coherence of the velocity field causes the number of independent points to be smaller than @xmath132 . on the other hand , our peculiar velocities",
    "are predicted using a sample covering a larger volume than that used in the comparison and this increases the number of independent points .",
    "because of these competing effects , we simply approximate the number of independent points by @xmath132 , even in the @xmath213 comparison .    as in  4.2",
    "we define the @xmath214 statistic which corresponds , in practice , to multiplying the errors @xmath215 and @xmath216 by @xmath217 in equation  ( [ eq : chi0 ] ) .",
    "we use this statistic to estimate the errors in @xmath195 and @xmath196 .",
    "19 ( upper panel ) shows a @xmath45@xmath45 scatterplot of the model cluster and overdensity fields measured at @xmath218 randomly selected gridpoints .",
    "all 6426 original points are used in the regression analysis .",
    "the solid line shows the best fit obtained by minimizing @xmath219 and the parameters of the fit are listed in table  3 .",
    "the resulting bias parameter is @xmath220 .",
    "this is consistent with results from an independent likelihood analysis in which the phenomenological power spectra of iras galaxies and abell clusters were compared ( e.g. peacock and dodds 1994 ) .",

    "this suggests that the exact weighting of galaxies in high density regions has only a minor effect on the regression analysis , mainly because the overdensity mismatch in large density peaks is restricted to a very few gridpoints . as a further check",
    ", we have repeated the @xmath45@xmath45 regression using a velocity model derived without applying our standard procedures for collapsing clusters and handling triple valued regions ( which should exacerbate any discrepancies associated with high peaks . ) the results , listed in the second row of table  3 , show that the effect on @xmath195 is indeed very small , leading to @xmath224 .",

    ". however , as indicated in table  3 , the resulting @xmath219 is large , @xmath227 .",
    "this could be due to an underestimate of the errors since the error analysis by branchini ( 1997 ) is based on clusters from the kolatt ( 1996 ) mock catalogues and these do not accurately match the abell / aco cluster distribution and velocities .",
    "we can obtain @xmath228 if we allow for a reasonable error underestimate in the cluster field of @xmath229 , in which case we obtain @xmath230 .",
    "note that consistent values of @xmath231 and @xmath232 are obtained within 1-@xmath3 whether or not the cluster errors have been underestimated at this level .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that the agreement of the @xmath45@xmath45 and @xmath207@xmath207 comparisons is not trivial .",
    "the @xmath45-@xmath45 comparison is local ; it is hardly affected by problems related to filling in masked regions but is potentially prone to the cluster core weighting problem .",
    "the @xmath207-@xmath207 comparison , on the other hand , involves the distribution of objects within the entire sample and thus is much more strongly affected by the unknown mass distribution within the zone - of - avoidance and beyond the sample s edge .",
    "we might therefore expect the two comparisons to be subject to different biases .",
    "the agreement in the estimates of @xmath195 from the two analyses suggests that systematic biases have been properly taken into account and that the linear biasing assumption is a good approximation , at least on scales larger than our 20 smoothing .",
    "in this section we consider the peculiar velocity , @xmath233 , of spheres of radius @xmath234 centred on the local group .",
    "this is a low order statistic that , in principle , can be estimated observationally .",
    "the expectation value of the bulk velocity , @xmath235 , averaged over scale @xmath234 is : @xmath236 where @xmath237 is the power spectrum of density fluctuations , @xmath238 is the fourier transform of the spherical top hat window function in real space , chosen to facilitate comparison between the theoretical definition ( eqn .",
    "[ eq : bv ] ) and its observational analogue ( eqn .",
    "[ eq : bv2 ] ) .",
    "it is worth stressing that eqn .",
    "(  [ eq : bv ] ) assumes equal volume weighting while the use of different weighting schemes may lead to quite different results ( kaiser 1988 , strauss et al .",
    "1995 , giovanelli et al .",
    "if the initial fluctuation field obeys gaussian statistics , then evolution through gravitational instability preserves a gaussian distribution for the amplitude of each cartesian component of @xmath233 , so that @xmath239 has a maxwellian distribution .",
    "this property makes it difficult to constrain @xmath237 from the measured @xmath233 .",
    "nevertheless , comparison of the measured @xmath233 with the velocities predicted from the gravity field allows , in principle , an estimate of the @xmath50 parameter . in practice , however , the bulk velocity is extremely sensitive to systematic errors both in the observational data and in the models .",
    "we attempt to take this carefully into account in the following analysis .",
    "the basis for our treatment of random and systematic errors in the model bulk velocity vector are , again , the mock catalogues described in  3.2 .",
    "finite volume effects are not a concern here since the volume of the simulation box is comparable to that of the sample . however , neglecting modes on scales larger than the size of the sample can bias the comparison between the model bulk flow and the measured one . in what follows",
    "we will treat these two effects separately .",
    "we first account for the intrinsic errors in the bulk flow model and we then address the problem of minimizing the effect of missing large - scale power .    from each mock catalogue",
    "we generate a model velocity field using methods  1 and  2 of  3.2 .",
    "the field is then smoothed onto a 64@xmath152 cubic grid of side 192 using a 12gaussian filter .",
    "the smoothing filter used here is different from the one used before because our aim is to perform a homogeneous comparison with the mark iii and sfi bulk flows .",
    "we measure the cumulative bulk velocity vector in the cmb frame by averaging over the peculiar velocities measured at gridpoints : @xmath240 where @xmath241 is the predicted velocity vector in the cmb frame at gridpoint @xmath242 .",
    "the sum @xmath243 extends over all the gridpoints contained within a sphere of radius @xmath234 .",
    "the same exercise is repeated using the original n  body velocity field .",
    "this gives an unbiased estimate of the true bulk velocity and the comparison between true and reconstructed velocities is an estimate of the error in the model bulk flow .    in the upper panel of fig .",
    "20 we show the average difference between reconstructed and true cumulative bulk velocity vectors .",
    "each cartesian component is displayed with a different symbol .",
    "the errorbars , representing the dispersion around the mean , are shown only for the sgy component .",
    "the dispersions for the remaining two components are larger by nearly a factor of two . from the plot",
    "we see that the errors in the sgy and sgz components of the reconstructed bulk flow are mainly random errors , but the sgx component is affected by a systematic positive bias .",
    "the amplitude of this systematic error decreases with distance ( from @xmath244 at 10 to @xmath245 at 100 ) .",
    "very similar results are obtained if the reconstruction is carried out using method  2 .",
    "these systematic errors arise mainly from the filling  in procedure for the zone - of - avoidance which , as we discussed in  3.2 , affects both the velocity fields and , via uncertainties in modeling the lg velocity , the transformation from lg to cmb frame . to corroborate this hypothesis",
    "we have performed 10 reconstructions using unmasked mock catalogues . with full sky coverage , the systematic bias in the sgx component disappears and the dispersions in the sgx and sgz components decrease by a factor of two . the systematic error in the sgx component",
    "is ultimately induced by the requirement of having only lg  like observers in the mock catalogues .",
    "in particular , visual inspection reveals that the galaxy dipole constraint in  3.2 almost invariably implies the existence of a great attractor  like density peak at a distance of 3060 , lying at negative sgx and partially overlapping the zone - of - avoidance .",
    "the filling  in procedure seems to underestimate the amplitude of this partially hidden density peak and this in turn causes a systematic offset in the sgx component of the reconstructed peculiar velocities , with minor effects on the two other components , as shown in fig .",
    "a similar bias is to be expected in the true model bulk flow because the great attractor really exists in our universe . to obtain bias - free estimates of the bulk flows",
    ", we must correct for such systematic errors . clearly , the best way of circumventing the problem is by restricting attention to the sgy component of the bulk velocity .",
    "however , sometimes one is interested in the amplitude of the bulk velocity and , in this case , a direct numerical correction of the systematic error is appropriate . since the amplitude of the estimated errors depends on @xmath50 , the errors displayed in the upper panel of fig .",
    "20 ( or the analogous quantity for the velocity amplitude ) can not be directly used to make quantitative corrections to the model bulk flow .",
    "however , we can take advantage of the fact that , to first approximation , the model velocities scale linearly with @xmath50 .",
    "thus , the ratio between reconstructed and true bulk velocities should be independent of @xmath50 .",
    "this ratio , averaged over our mock catalogues , is shown by filled circles in the lower panel of fig .",
    "20 , as a function of distance , with errorbars again representing the dispersion around the mean .",
    "since it is independent of @xmath50 , this ratio may be used as a multiplicative factor to correct the predicted bulk flow amplitudes for systematic errors .",
    "as expected , the corrections become very small when considering the sgy component ( open circles ) .",
    "we have performed a similar analysis to estimate errors in the bulk velocity obtained using method  2 and in the 1.2jy bulk flow model , obtained using method  1 .",
    "we are now ready to derive model bulk flows and their uncertainties from the and 1.2jy surveys .",
    "the upper left panel in fig  21 shows the amplitude of the cumulative bulk velocity vector , predicted using various samples and methods . in all cases",
    "the bulk flow was computed by integrating the density field out to the same distance of 200 , hence enforcing the same volume bias in all cases .",
    "the velocities are normalized to @xmath58 .",
    "open and filled circles show results using methods  1 and  2 respectively , and filled squares show results from the 1.2jy survey , all corrected for systematic errors as discussed in the preceding paragraph . for clarity",
    "only the 1@xmath3 error bars from method  1 are plotted .",
    "the filled triangles show the bulk velocity computed from the abell / aco model velocity field , rescaled by @xmath177 ( see  5.2 ) .",
    "there is remarkably good agreement between the cumulative bulk flows computed from the different sets of mass tracers , with typical deviations of less than @xmath246 from the mean in the amplitude from the different surveys and analysis methods .",
    "the directions of the cumulative bulk flow vectors , measured within 60 , are plotted in the upper right - hand panel of fig .",
    "the model bulk flow points , within 1@xmath3 , to the direction of both the 1.2jy and abell / aco model bulk flows .",
    "the direction of the cmb dipole , indicated by the asterisk , is plotted for reference at the centre of the figure . in the lower panel of fig .",
    "21 we show the misalignment angle of the various bulk flows with respect to the method  1 model . in all cases the misalignment is small and almost independent of radius .",
    "the only exception is the increasing misalignment angle at large radii between the bulk velocities determined using method  1 and method  2 .",
    "note the close alignment between the and clusters bulk flows at all radii .",
    "so far we have modelled bulk velocities in the nearby universe by considering only the gravitational effect of the mass distribution within 200 .",
    "bulk flows , however , are sensitive to the mass distribution on scales larger than those probed by our samples .",
    "neglecting large scale modes leads to a volume bias which can affect the comparison with observations .",
    "various methods have been proposed to restore the missing large scale modes ( e.g. strauss 1995 , tormen and bertschinger 1996 , cole 1997 ) . here",
    "we propose a simple statistical treatment based on linear theory , using eqn .",
    "( [ eq : bv ] ) to obtain a correction factor for the missing contribution to the amplitude of the bulk velocity from scales beyond the sample boundary .",
    "the correction factor is the ratio @xmath247 the numerator in this equation is the mean true bulk flow , while the denominator is the mean bulk flow generated only by density fluctuations on scales smaller than @xmath248 . in our case , @xmath249 .",
    "note that the ratio depends only on the spectral shape and on @xmath250 ; the dependence on @xmath50 cancels out .",
    "tests using large n  body simulations ( e.g. jenkins 1998 ) have shown that this approach is indeed effective .",
    "since the amplitude of the bulk flow follows a maxwellian distribution , and its components are gaussian random variables , we can numerically estimate the uncertainty in this correction . assuming that these uncertainties and the intrinsic random errors computed above are uncorrelated",
    ", we obtain the total random uncertainties on the model bulk flow by adding them in quadrature . in computing @xmath251",
    "we assume a cdm model with spectral shape @xmath83 , as suggested by a wide variety of data on the large - scale galaxy distribution ( e.g. baugh 1996 ) .",
    "we have applied the correction of eqn .",
    "( 22 ) to the bulk velocity reconstructed from the survey using method  1 .",
    "the resulting cumulative bulk velocity ( for @xmath58 ) is shown in fig .",
    "21 as a dot  dashed line labelled m1l .",
    "we regard this as our best estimate of the @xmath50dependent bulk flow .      in this section",
    ", we compare our best estimate of the predicted bulk flow velocity from the survey with recent observational estimates .",
    "this comparison serves two purposes .",
    "firstly , consistency between predicted and observed velocities lends support to the hypothesis that structure grew by gravitational instability and gives confidence in the integrity of the observational data .",
    "secondly , the comparison allows an estimate of the parameter @xmath252 .",
    "the determination of bulk flows from peculiar velocity surveys is prone to systematic errors .",
    "for example , zero - point errors in the calibration of the distance indicators coupled with limited sky coverage may mimic a bulk flow .",
    "similarly , the coupling of large intrinsic errors in distance measurements with inhomogeneities in the density distribution ( the inhomogeneous malmquist bias ) also results in a spurious outflow .",
    "thus , to perform an unbiased comparison with theoretical predictions requires full - sky , homogeneous surveys of peculiar velocities and an accurate model of the survey s window function .    in fig .",
    "22 we plot observational determinations of bulk flows derived from four ( almost ) independent datasets .",
    "the lower panel shows the full cumulative bulk flow as a function of distance while the upper panel shows its sgy component only .",
    "the filled triangles ( taken from dekel 1998 ) represent the cumulative bulk flows in the mark  iii catalogue .",
    "the sparse and noisy mark  iii velocities have been smoothed assuming that the velocity field is irrotational .",
    "this guarantees that a unique three  dimensional velocity field is derivable from the observed radial velocities , as in the potent method ( dekel , bertschinger & faber 1990 ) .",
    "the resulting three  dimensional peculiar velocity field , smoothed with a 12gaussian , and defined on a regular grid is directly comparable to our model prediction .",
    "the filled square shows the preliminary result by eldar ( 1998 ) who use a potent smoothing technique to derive the bulk velocity from the sfi catalogue ( giovanelli 1997a , 1997b ) .",
    "the open triangle in the lower panel is the bulk velocity inferred from 44 supernovae type  ia by riess , press & kirshner ( 1995 ) , as reported by dekel ( 1997 ) ( the effective radius of this last measurement is much smaller than the depth of the sample because the data were weighted by the inverse of the errors ) .",
    "finally , the open square at large distance shows the bulk velocity derived by lauer & postman ( 1994 ; lp94 ) from a sample of brightest cluster galaxies .",
    "the directions of the observed bulk velocity vectors are given in the right - hand panel .",
    "for the mark  iii , sfi and sn 1a determinations , they have been estimated from data within 50 .",
    "the direction of the lp94 bulk flow is taken from strauss ( 1997 ) and refers to a depth of @xmath253 .",
    "except for the lp94 result , there is excellent agreement between the various determinations of the bulk flow in fig .",
    "22 . these may be compared with the bulk flows predicted by the survey , indicated by the thick dot  dashed lines which enclose the 1@xmath3 allowed range .",
    "these are normalized to @xmath254 and corrected for volume bias .",
    "the filled circle in the right - hand plot marks the direction of the predicted bulk velocity vector within 50 .    requiring that the predicted bulk flow should match the measured one gives an estimate of @xmath50 . in performing this comparison",
    "we shall ignore the discrepant lp94 result which strauss ( 1995 ) and watkins and feldman ( 1995 ) , amongst others , have argued is inconsistent with currently acceptable cosmological models . the lp94 data point is also inconsistent with our predicted bulk flow derived only from the gravitational instability and linear biasing hypotheses . indeed , as shown in fig .",
    "22 , matching the amplitude of the lp94 bulk flow would require a value of @xmath255 , which is incompatible with all other current measurements ( e.g. giovanelli 1998a , 1998b , dekel 1998 and eldar 1998 ) and implies a very large misalignment angle of @xmath256 between the lp94 vector and the direction of our model flow velocity",
    ". in what follows we limit our comparison of model and observed bulk flows by imposing a series of restrictions designed to minimize possible systematic errors .",
    "these restrictions are :     we consider only the cumulative bulk flow from mark  iii as estimated by dekel ( 1998 ) . like the model velocity field , the mark",
    "iii velocities have been smoothed onto a regular grid and filtered on a similar scale .",
    "this ensures that the comparison is as homogeneous as possible .",
    " we consider mark  iii peculiar velocities calibrated according to the recent velmod analysis by willick and strauss ( 1998 ) .",
    " we exclude scales smaller than 30since small differences in the smoothing procedures applied to model and observed velocities in the nearby region can bias the comparison .",
    " we do not include the result of eldar ( 1998 ) which , although consistent with those of dekel ( 1998 ) , is still preliminary .    we perform the comparison between model and observed bulk flows using a likelihood technique similar to that used by strauss ( 1992a ) and schmoldt ( 1998 ) .",
    "the aim is to estimate the likelihood of a particular value of @xmath50 given the bulk flow observed in the mark  iii catalogue and the one derived from the survey using method  1 . under the assumption that the bulk velocities are gaussian",
    "random fields it is easy to show that the joint probability distribution for the observed and model bulk flows is a multivariate gaussian that depends only on its covariance matrix .",
    "the latter is completely specified by the value of @xmath50 and by the power spectrum of density fluctuations , @xmath237 . in this work",
    "we restrict attention to the family of cdm models for which @xmath237 , parametrised as in davis ( 1985 ) , is completely specified by its shape parameter , @xmath257 , and normalization , @xmath85 .",
    "although the latter can be regarded as an independent parameter , adopting the normalization inferred by eke , cole , and frenk ( 1996 ) from the observed abundance of galaxy clusters , allows one to relate @xmath85 to @xmath6 . in the following we consider only two cases , @xmath85 = 0.52 and 0.87 , which correspond to the cases of a critical , @xmath82 , and an open , @xmath80 , universe .",
    "( for a flat universe with @xmath80 , the required value of @xmath85 is similar ) .    given a cosmological model specified by @xmath85 , @xmath50 , and @xmath258 , we compute the joint probability of obtaining the cumulative bulk flow measured by dekel ( 1998 ) at 30 , 40 , 50 and 60 ( @xmath259 ) , and the m1 cumulative bulk flow displayed in fig .  22 , at all radii from 10 to 80 @xmath260 .",
    "we ignore the correction for volume bias .",
    "the resulting probability density is : @xmath261 where the covariance matrix @xmath262 is : @xmath263 the window functions are : @xmath264 for the mark  iii cumulative bulk flow measured within @xmath265 and @xmath266 for the cumulative bulk flow measured within @xmath267 . in eqn .",
    "( 26 ) , @xmath268 represents the outer radius of the sample , i.e. the maximum distance out to which the density field is integrated to predict peculiar velocities . the second term in the right - hand side of eqn .  ( 26 ) accounts for the volume bias affecting the m1bulk flow .",
    "this correction is robust in the sense that the alternative strategy of limiting the integration in eqn .",
    "( [ covariancematrix ] ) to @xmath269 gives very similar results .",
    "finally , we take into account random errors in the measured and modeled bulk flows by adding them in quadrature to the diagonal terms of the covariance matrix .    from the joint probability density distribution ( eq .  [ fv ] ) we construct the relative likelihood , @xmath270 , of different world models @xmath271 : @xmath272 the two plots in fig .",
    "23 show likelihood contours of @xmath273 in the @xmath274 plane , plotted at confidence levels of 68 , 90 and 99 % .",
    "the shape of these contours is very similar for the two normalizations although the range of allowed values of @xmath50 is somewhat larger for the high normalization . in both cases the likelihood peaks at @xmath275 ;",
    "low values of @xmath50 are excluded at high confidence level primarily by the requirement to match the amplitude of the observed bulk flow .",
    "no stringent constraint can be imposed on the shape parameter @xmath258 apart from an upper limit that follows from the fact that the power can not be confined to very small scales .",
    "the cluster normalization also defines a @xmath276 transformation .",
    "therefore , we can explore the effect of introducing an observational constraint on the hubble parameter , ( @xmath277 ) , which defines a vertical region in the @xmath278 plane .",
    "introducing this extra constraint has a major effect in the case of low normalization since it forces the power to originate from unacceptably small scales .",
    "by contrast , in the case of high normalization , the extra constraint on @xmath279 is perfectly consistent with the likelihood contours .",
    "following schmoldt ( 1998 ) we can set a more stringent constraint on @xmath50 by considering not only the bulk flow but the entire set of observational information available on peculiar velocities in the local universe .",
    "in particular , we use the cmb dipole ( @xmath56 ) , the amplitude of the local velocity shear ( @xmath280 ) , and the dipole in the gravitational acceleration induced by the distribution of galaxies in @xmath281 independent radial shells ( @xmath282 ) in order to compute the constrained probability function @xmath283 ) .",
    "the modeling of this probability distribution , its covariance matrix and the treatment of the errors may be found in schmoldt ( 1998 ) and strauss ( 1992a ) to which we refer the reader for a more detailed discussion . in this analysis",
    "we use the differential dipole , @xmath284 , measured by schmoldt ( 1998 ) in @xmath285 non - overlapping top - hat windows of width @xmath286 and the same values of @xmath287 and @xmath288 used in  3.2 .",
    "the effect of adding these new observational constraints is shown in fig .",
    "the overall shape of the likelihood contours does not change appreciably .",
    "however , the valley along the @xmath258 direction is now deeper and so the value of @xmath50 is better constrained .",
    "this is clearly seen in fig .",
    "25 where we plot the distribution of the normalized likelihood of @xmath50 obtained by marginalising the joint likelihood distribution over @xmath258 .",
    "the continuous lines give the marginal distributions after integrating over all values of @xmath258 , while the dot - dashed lines give the result of limiting @xmath258 to the values allowed by the extra constraints on @xmath279 . for @xmath289",
    ", we find @xmath290 ( 1@xmath3 ) , irrespective of the constraint on @xmath279 .",
    "thus , in a low density universe , a power spectrum normalized according to the cluster abundance is consistent with the velocity data .",
    "by contrast , for the low normalisation , @xmath291 , the constraints on @xmath50 change appreciably with the addition of the new constraints , leading to a larger value of @xmath292 ( 1@xmath3 ) . as may be seen in fig .  24 , however , in this latter case the relative probability within the strip allowed by the constraint on @xmath279 is smaller than in the case of high normalization , thus rendering a high @xmath6 universe less likely according to the velocity data . finally , it is interesting to note that the assumption of linear bias coupled with the cluster normalization of the power spectrum implies that @xmath293 , irrespective of the value of @xmath6 . from the variance of the galaxy counts at 8  , @xmath294 , and",
    "so we obtain @xmath295 , consistent with the estimates above at the 1@xmath3 level .",
    "the recently completed redshift survey of iras galaxies represents an almost ideal dataset for studying the mass distribution and the gravity field in the local universe . in this paper",
    "we have used the survey to develop a nonparametric model of the local cosmic velocity field which supersedes results derived from the shallower 1.2 jy and the sparser qdot surveys .",
    "our reconstructions are based on the assumptions that cosmic structure has grown by gravitational instability and that fluctuations in the galaxy distribution are proportional to fluctuations in the mass distribution .",
    "we have paid particular attention to a careful estimation of random and systematic errors using a suite of mock catalogues constructed from large cosmological n ",
    "body simulations . as a further check on the validity of our results ,",
    "we have implemented two independent methods for reconstructing the model velocity fields , both of which give consistent results .",
    "because of the large size of the survey , the density and velocity fields can be reliably reconstructed out to a depth of 150 .",
    "we have presented maps of the galaxy distribution which , with a smoothing of xs 6 , clearly show the relative sizes of the main structures that characterize our local universe .",
    "the two largest peaks in our neighbourhood are the great attractor , made up of the hydra  centaurus and pavo  indus  telescopium superclusters , and the perseus ",
    "pisces supercluster located in roughly opposite directions along the supergalactic plane .",
    "the local , coma - a1367 , and camelopardalis superclusters as well as the cetus wall are clearly visible in our maps , as is the giant shapley concentration which appears near the edge of the survey , behind the great attractor .",
    "the largest underdensity in our vicinity is the well - known sculptor void , but this is almost matched in size by a void in the background of the camelopardalis supercluster .",
    "three more underdense regions that exert an important influence on the local dynamics are the voids in the foreground of coma , in the background of the perseus ",
    "pisces complex , and behind the great attractor",
    ".    the local velocity field implied by the density field is complex .",
    "the dominant features are the organized infall patterns towards the large mass concentrations in the great attractor , perseus  pisces and coma regions .",
    "superimposed upon these are impressive coherent flows along a ridge between cetus and perseus  pisces and along the camelopardalis  virgo  great attractor  shapley direction .",
    "we see no prominent back - infall onto the great attractor . instead , the flow in this region is a result of an interplay between the compressional push of two nearby voids and the pull of the shapley concentration on much larger scales .",
    "the reconstruction of the velocity field agrees well with results from the 1.2jy survey within 80 , the region in which the latter provides adequate sampling .",
    "the only noticeable difference are the predicted bulk velocity vectors which ( in the cmb frame ) differ in the two surveys by @xmath296 in each cartesian component .",
    "this discrepancy arises from uncertainties in the way in which the zone - of - avoidance is filled in and from the sampling noise of the density field at large distances .",
    "while the former affects the and 1.2jy results equally , the latter is more severe in the 1.2jy case because of the larger shot noise .",
    "thus , the misalignment between the local group acceleration and the cmb dipole vectors is @xmath297 for the 1.2jy survey , but only @xmath298 for the survey ( schmoldt 1998 ) .",
    "comparison of the spherical harmonic multipoles of the two model velocity fields in radial shells confirms the consistency of the and 1.2jy survey predictions in the region of overlap ( teodoro 1998 ) .    as was the case with the 1.2jy survey ,",
    "the velocity field reconstructed from the survey is partially inconsistent with the peculiar velocities in the mark  iii catalogue .",
    "a visual inspection of the and 1.2 jy velocity maps ( figs .  6 and 9 ) shows some differences around the hydra ",
    "centaurus complex , where the mark  iii data exhibit a large shear , and in the perseus pisces region , which , in the mark  iii catalogue , appears to participate in a large streaming motion ( davis , nusser and willick 1996 ) . as pointed out by these authors , beyond 30",
    "there is a large coherent residual dipole in the difference between the 1.2jy gravity field and the mark  iii peculiar velocity field .",
    "this can not be ascribed to improper modelling of the gravity field by iras galaxies since the dipole depends only on the mass within the surveyed volume .",
    "furthermore , baker ( 1998 ) have shown that the gravity field in the optical ors survey ( santiago 1995 , 1996 ) is consistent with the 1.2jy gravity field ( and thus , by implication , with the field as well ) .",
    "this suggests that the undersampling of cluster cores by the predominantly spiral galaxy population in iras surveys does not have a large effect in the inferred gravity field . the most plausible explanation for the discrepancy between the mark  iii velocities and the iras ( and ors ) model predictions seems to be some systematic bias that affects the mark  iii catalogue beyond 30 ( baker 1998 , willick and strauss 1998 ) .",
    "as we saw in  5.1 , the density and velocity fields inferred from the survey agree well with those inferred from a sample of abell / aco clusters .",
    "this is perhaps surprising since clusters are selected in a very different way from galaxies , but it is reassuring and suggests that systematic errors are under control in both cases .",
    "comparison of the two model density and velocity fields , smoothed on the same cubic grid , out to a distance of 140 , gives the relative linear bias , @xmath195 , between the rich cluster population and galaxies .",
    "a simple @xmath134 analysis of the density  density and velocity  velocity comparisons gives very similar results , @xmath299 and @xmath300 , respectively .",
    "these values are consistent with the estimate , @xmath301 , obtained by peacock and dodds ( 1994 ) from an independent likelihood analysis of phenomenological power spectra .",
    "a more detailed comparison of the relative bias field of clusters and galaxies will be presented by plionis ( 1998 ) .    finally , averaging over the peculiar velocity field reconstructed from the survey , we have calculated the expected bulk velocity of concentric spheres around us . comparison of these predicted bulk flows with those measured from the mark  iii catalogue by dekel ( 1998 ) gives an estimate of @xmath302 .",
    "we implemented a likelihood analysis to carry out this comparison , taking into account the observed cmb dipole , the observed local shear field and the velocity of the local group predicted by the gravity field .",
    "if a high normalization for the power spectrum is assumed ( @xmath289 ) , then our best estimate is @xmath290 ( 1@xmath3 ) .",
    "this value of @xmath50 is consistent with results from analyses of the dipole ( schmoldt 1998 , rowan  robinson 1998 ) , and with the most recent determinations of @xmath50 from velocity  velocity comparisons ( davis , nusser & willick 1996 , willick 1997b , da costa 1998 , willick and strauss 1998 and , within 1-@xmath3 , also with sigad 1998 ) .",
    "adopting a low normalisation for the power spectrum gives a higher value of @xmath303 ( 1@xmath3 ) . while still consistent with most of the estimates above , such large values are only marginally consistent with the measured variance of the iras galaxy density field and the power spectrum normalization derived by eke , cole and frenk ( 1996 ) .",
    "furthermore , with this normalization the bulk flows are also difficult to reconcile with the observationally favored values of hubble s constant , @xmath279 , and the spectral shape parameter , @xmath258 .    a more accurate determination of @xmath50 , to 15% accuracy , is possible by performing a more detailed comparison between the peculiar velocity field inferred from the survey and the measured peculiar velocities at independent locations .",
