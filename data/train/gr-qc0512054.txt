    "as it was shown by majumdar @xcite and by papapetrou @xcite , if the energy density of the static dust equals the charge density , @xmath12 , one can write the line element using the harmonic coordinates , @xmath13 where @xmath14 , and the einstein  maxwell equations ( [ eq : einmax ] ) for the energy momentum tensor @xmath15 reduce to a nonlinear version of the poisson equation , @xmath16 ( @xmath17 is the 3-dimensional flat space laplacian operator ) . such matter is called the extremally charged , or electrically counterpoised dust ( ecd ) .",
    "the 4-velocity of the static ecd is @xmath18 , the charge 4-current is @xmath19 , and the 4-potential has only the time component , @xmath20 , where the electrostatic potential @xmath21 is related to the metric profile function by @xmath22 . for a formulation of the mp formalism in @xmath23 dimensional spacetimes , as well as for a recent compilation of references dealing with mp systems ,",

    "while one of the most remarkable features of the mp systems is that they do not require any spatial symmetry , spherically symmetric and asymptotically flat mp systems have played a role in obtaining valuable insights into the properties of astrophysically plausible systems , and are sometimes called ` bonnor stars ' @xcite . in the spherical symmetry ,",
    "the harmonic line element ( [ eq : dsuxyz ] ) is @xmath24 where @xmath25 , and the mp equation ( [ eq : einred ] ) can be written @xmath26 the prime denoting differentiation with respect to the harmonic coordinate @xmath27 .",
    "the energy momentum tensor due to the electrostatic field ( [ eq : emunu ] ) acquires the diagonal form : @xmath28 the total energy density , @xmath29 , involves the contribution from the ecd which is non - negative by assumption , and the manifestly non - negative contribution from the electrostatic field .",

    "we require that in the regularized solution the charge integral ( [ eq : q ] ) and the tolman  whittaker mass integral ( [ eq : m ] ) , when integrated over the @xmath40 slice , obey the relation ( [ eq : mqadm ] ) .",
    "all the singular configurations considered so far can be regularized by introducing a single spherical shell of ecd with the regular geometry in the interior .",
    "we will be using the @xmath0-shells with flat interior geometry , expecting similar behaviour also for the shells of finite thickness @xcite .",
    "the flat geometry in the interior ( with constant metric profile function @xmath88 ) is to be joined with the exterior geometry of our solutions , given by the metric profile function @xmath90 satisfying ( [ eq : mpeta ] ) and with the outermost node at @xmath115 , along a spherical ( timelike ) hypersurface given by @xmath126 . applying the israel s junction condition formalism @xcite , we will obtain the components of the required energy - momentum distribution on the junction hypersurface ( shell ) . on the both sides of the hypersurface we use the coordinates @xmath127 , while as the coordinates on the hypersurface we naturally adopt @xmath128 .",
    "the first junction condition requires that the induced metric on the hypersurface ( the first fundamental form of the metric on the hypersurface ) , given by @xmath129 , where @xmath130 , must be the same as induced by the metrics on either side of the hypersurface , i.e.  the discontinuity of the induced metric over the hypersurface must vanish . in our context",
    ", this requires that the metric profile function @xmath88 is continuous over the hypersurface .",
    "the regularized metric profile function @xmath131 can therefore be written @xmath132 where @xmath133 is the unit step function .",
    "the second junction condition requires that the extrinsic curvature ( the second fundamental form of the metric on the hypersurface ) , given by @xmath134 , where @xmath135 is the unit normal vector to the hypersurface , must be the same as computed from the metric on either side of the hypersurface . here",
    ", the nonzero components of the extrinsic curvature are @xmath136 where @xmath88 and @xmath137 are evaluated at @xmath138 .",
    "since in the flat interior we have @xmath139 , while in the exterior we have @xmath140 in general , the second junction condition can not be satisfied .",
    "however , given that the first junction condition _ is _ satisfied , it is still possible to join the two geometries , provided that we introduce ( allow for ) the appropriate distribution of the energy - momentum on the hypersurface ( shell ) .",
    "the components of the energy - momentum tensor on the shell are then given by the expression @xmath141\\big ]    - \\big[\\big [ k \\big]\\big ] \\ , h_{ab } \\big),\\ ] ] where @xmath142 and the double brackets denote the discontinuity of a quantity over the hypersurface .",
    "in our context , for the surface energy density of the shell we obtain @xmath143 while the surface tension , @xmath144 , vanishes identically . from this one",
    "can see that the energy - momentum distribution on the shell satisfies all standard energy conditions if @xmath6 is non - negative , while all energy conditions are violated if @xmath6 is negative .",
    "since in our solutions the adm mass is positive , the metric profile function @xmath88 is outwardly decreasing ( [ eq : bc1 ] ) as @xmath84 , but since it is continous and nonnegative for @xmath145 it must have a maximum at some @xmath146 .",
    "it follows that if the regularizing shell is introduced at @xmath147 , i.e.  where @xmath88 is outwardly increasing ( @xmath148 ) , all energy conditions are violated .",
    "if it is introduced at @xmath149 ( @xmath88 is outwardly decreasing , @xmath150 ) , all energy conditions are satisfied .    in the regularized geometry , the charge integral ( [ eq : q ] ) involves the contribution due to the charge density on the shell and due to the charge density of the ecd distribution outside of the regularizing shell .",
    "the resulting ( regularized ) charge density can be written , @xmath151 and when integrated over the @xmath40 slice the expected value @xmath87 is obtained . the tolman ",
    "whittaker mass integral ( [ eq : m ] ) involves the expression @xmath152 where the first term is due to the energy - momentum contribution of the shell and the second term is due to the exterior part of the original ecd distribution .",
    "the integral of this quantity over the @xmath40 slice yields @xmath87 , as it should be .",
    "thus , the relation ( [ eq : mqadm ] ) holds in the regularized system .",
    "we obtained a spectrum of asymptotically extremal reissner ",
    "nordstrm ( ern ) solutions in the majumdar ",
    "papapetrou ( mp ) system .",
    "the solutions are induced by the assumed distribution of the extremally charged dust ( ecd ) , they have positive adm mass , the metric profile function @xmath90 is finite at the harmonic radius @xmath47 , but it can have one or more nodes for @xmath89 .",
    "the outermost node corresponds to the naked pointlike singularity .",
    "such solutions are shown to exist only for a discrete set of values of a parameter @xmath100 related to the source strength ( allocated ecd / mass ) . here ,",
    "for instance , the solutions with zero to three nodes have source strengths : @xmath153 , @xmath154 , @xmath155 , @xmath156 .",
    "the situation resembles a quantum system with fixed boundary conditions , in which to the normalized set of eigenfunctions there corresponds a set of discrete eigenvalues with higher ones corresponding to higher excitations ( and increasing number of nodes ) .    for a distant observer",
    ", the adm mass of the mp spacetime equals the @xmath157 total electrical charge of the system . in the same time",
    ", the mass of the regular system can be given by the tolman ",
    "whittaker mass ( [ eq : m ] ) , and the total charge by the integral of the charge density ( [ eq : q ] ) .",
    "the spectrum of solutions with nodes in the metric profile function , due to the presence of the singularity , does not satisfy the expected relation among the different mass and charge parameters ( [ eq : mqadm ] ) .",
    "also , since the singularities are naked , the solutions can be taken as physically unacceptable .",
    "we conclude the discussion of these solutions by showing that by surrounding the singularity with a spherical @xmath0-shell of ecd the solutions can be regularized .",
    "interestingly , depending on the position of the @xmath0-shell , the energy density of the ecd can have either a positive or a negative sign ( see also @xcite ) . for solutions with positive adm mass and",
    "the outermost node is at @xmath115 , at some @xmath146 there is a maximum of @xmath90 .",
    "if the @xmath0-shell is placed in the region @xmath158 the energy density of the shell is negative , while if it is placed in the region @xmath159 , the energy density is positive . in the special case where the shell is placed exactly at @xmath160 , the required amount of ecd on the shell is zero , but in all these cases the required relation between mass and charge which one finds in the regular mp systems is restored . in the similar context , @xmath0-shells were used to regularize the multiple black hole ern spacetime in @xcite .",
    "however , @xmath0-shell regularization is not the only possible approach ; thick shells @xcite could nonetheless be applied to achieve the similar results .",
    "alternatively , instead of altering the ecd distribution to replace the central singularity with a patch of the regular spacetime , one could , along the lines of ref .",
