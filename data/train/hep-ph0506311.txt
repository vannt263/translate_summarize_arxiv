    "one has to resort to a renormalization - scheme choice that makes the uncalculated higher - order corrections negligible and adopt a renormalization scale that reflects the typical parton virtualities in the considered process .",
    "the latter procedure , however , may result into a scale in the region of only a few @xmath4 , where the application of perturbation theory for the conventional running coupling without infrared ( ir ) protection against the landau pole becomes inapplicable  a prominent example being the brodsky  lepage  mackenzie scale - setting procedure @xcite .",

    "we observe the same monotonic pattern , i.e. , no crossing , of curves , found already for the one - loop case , shown in fig.[fig : fapt - anu](b ) .",
    "we investigated numerically the range of negative values of @xmath24 and found that crossing appears only for indices @xmath116 , again in close analogy to the one - loop case .",
    "the pivotal results of this paper are collected in table [ tab : feynman.rules.fapt ] , where we provide the reader with explicit calculational rules to connect the standard qcd perturbation theory with fapt .",
    "we stress that the presented algorithm has broad applications in phenomenology and can play a major role in the perturbative analysis of observables both in inclusive and exclusive qcd reactions .",
    "with hindsight we can say that the requirement of analyticity at the amplitude level of hadronic quantities in qcd , expressed by karanikas and stefanis @xcite , is instrumental in improving perturbation - theory calculations .",
    "first , as shown in an accompanying paper by two of us ( a.p.b . and",
    "together with karanikas @xcite , it enables one to minimize both the sensitivity on the renormalization scheme and scale setting and also the dependence on the factorization scale .",
    "the reason for this latter advantage is that it includes into the `` analytization '' procedure not only the powers of the running coupling , but also logarithms ( or exponentials ) that may contain the momentum scale with respect to which analyticity is required .",
    "second , starting at this point , we have shown in the present work that invoking this analyticity principle gives rise to a generalization of the original apt to fractional powers of the coupling . as a bonus ,",
    "this approach improves the convergence of the perturbative expansion significantly  see fig .",
    "[ fig : fapt - pt ] .",
    "our main goal in this analysis was to work out in mathematical detail the procedure for determining analytic expressions for any real power of the running coupling and delineate the main results . to keep our presentation as general as possible ,",
    "we have purposefully refrained from considering specific examples and concentrated instead on generic features and expressions . in this vein , we have discussed products of the running coupling ( or its powers ) with ( powers of ) logarithms , which are typical for contributions encountered in higher - order corrections of qcd perturbation theory , or when taking into account evolution effects via the renormalization - group equation .",
    "similar logarithmic terms also appear in calculations employing light cone sum rules @xcite . in an analogous way",
    ", we have discussed the resummation of non - power series in the analytic images in order to capture the key features of sudakov resummation of soft - gluon effects ( see appendix [ app : anc ] ) .",
    "all these elements of fatp , required for further applications of this formalism to improve the calculation of any hadronic amplitude at the two - loop level , are collected in table [ tab : feynman.rules.fapt ] . in this context",
    ", we mention that we have developed approximate expressions for the two - loop analytic images in terms of one - loop quantities that can facilitate practical computations significantly .    in conclusion ,",
    "this report has emphasized rigorous methods rather than specific applications .",
    "a first example of the present framework is discussed in @xcite , focusing on the topic of the renormalization - scheme and factorization - scale independence of the electromagnetic pion form factor , relative to its treatment within the standard qcd perturbation theory or original apt .",
    "the methods presented here are intended to be used in the low - to - medium momentum range where the standard perturbative approach faces the problem of the landau pole and in processes or under circumstances where the original apt is insufficient because it is tied to integer powers of the coupling .",
    "we believe that our assortment of analytic expressions for a variety of expressions ranging from any real powers of the coupling to more complicated products containing logarithms , provides sufficient evidence for the usefulness of the approach for higher - order perturbative calculations .",
    "we wish to thank d.  v.  shirkov for valuable discussions and comments .",
