    "many aspects of biological life crucially depend on stability of cell membranes for which several properties are not understood yet .",
    "fluid lipid bilayers are the building blocks of biological membranes .",
    "pores in such systems play an important role in the diffusion of small molecules across biomembranes @xcite .",
    "as well pore formation is a possible mechanism for vesicle fusion @xcite . in order for any vesicle to be useful it must be relatively stable . yet in order to undergo fusion , long - lived holes must occur during the fusion transformation . how membranes actually manage to exhibit these two conflicting properties",
    "is not completely clear , but this can likely be realized only dynamically .",
    "dynamic properties are especially important for biological membranes , because their static characteristics describe a dead structure whereas life and biological functions are associated with molecular motions .",
    "thus , the desire to understand the dynamics of biomembrane rupture , which is the main aim of this paper , is hardly surprising .    on a microscopic level ,",
    "pores are formed owing to thermal motion of lipid molecules and , in principle , various types of pores can be distinguished .",
    "it usually is assumed that initially nucleated pores have hydrophobic edges ; the so - called hydrophobic pores @xcite which are spontaneously formed in the lipid matrix .",
    "the probability for the existence of such hydrophobic pores is determined by the free energy of pore as a function of pore radius ( see sections [ prob ] and [ anal ] below ) . and , when the hydrophobic pore exceeds a critical size , a reorientation of the lipids takes place converting the pore into an hydrophilic one where the head groups form the pore walls . as discussed in @xcite , these reorientation processes can occur at the very early stages of pore formation so that nucleation is the crucial step in the rupture process .",
    "note that thermal fluctuations can as well lead to transient unstable pores , often termed as pre - pores @xcite . in what follows",
    ", we will be interested on stable pores ( i. e. , a well defined density of pores which can be detected , e.g. , by neutron scattering , with individual pores forming and resealing reversibly ) and head group reorientation mechanisms will be disregarded .",
    "all details on hydrophobic and hydrophilic pores will be lumped into the effective model parameters like line tension , ( unstressed ) membrane surface tension , and pore size diffusion coefficient .",
    "electric breakdown method provides information on pore size which can be drawn from the dependence of membrane conductivity on applied voltage @xcite , but dynamical pore characteristics can be hardly found by this technique .",
    "one of the most relevant material parameter controlling pore dynamics is membrane surface tension .",
    "surface tension suppressing thermal fluctuations and promoting membrane adhesive properties , can induce adhesion of a membrane onto a substrate or to another membrane , and other tension induced morphological transitions including membrane rupture .",
    "a closed vesicle without pores can survive for a very long period of time .",
    "pores can form and grow in the fluid - lipid membrane in response to thermal fluctuations and external influences .",
    "several innovative techniques are available for observing transient permeation and opening of pores .",
    "these include mechanical stress , strong electric fields ( electroporation ) , optical tweezers , imploding bubbles , adhesion at a substrate , and puncturing by a sharp tip . in all instances ,",
    "the resulting transient pore is usually unstable and leads to membrane rupture for some level of the surface tension .",
    "using the rupturing of biomembranes under ramps of surface tension , the challenge of the dynamic tension spectroscopy ( dts ) is to identify and quantify the relevant parameters that govern the dynamics of membrane rupture and thereby characterize the membrane mechanical strength .        as a demonstration of the dts technique , evans et al .",
    "@xcite conducted experiments of rupturing fluid membrane vesicles with a steady ramp of micropipette suction ( fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "rupture tests on different types of giant phosphatidychlorine lipid vesicles over loading rate ( tension / time ) from 0.01 and up to 100 mn / m / s produce distributions of breakage tensions governed by the kinetic process of membrane failure .",
    "one might naively expect that lipid membranes to rupture at tensions close to hydrocarbon - water surface tension as lipids are held together by hydrophobic interactions .",
    "however , biomembranes rupture at much lower tension . as pointed out by evans et al .",
    ", rupture strength of a biomembrane is a dynamical property and that the level of strength depends on the time frame for breakage @xcite .",
    "energy barriers along the tension driven pathway are determinants of membrane strength , and the relative heights of these barriers lead to time - dependent changes in strength . to describe dynamic tension spectra they observed , evans et al .",
    "modeled the membrane breakage as a sequence of two successive thermally - activated transitions ( dependent of loading rates ) limited either by specific defect ( pre - pore ) formation or by passage over the cavitation barrier ( or evolution to an unstable pore ) .",
    "accordingly , this description was formalized into a three - state kinetic model for the membrane : the defect - free ground state , the defect or metastable state , and the ruptured membrane state @xcite .",
    "motivated by these experimental and theoretical investigations and findings , our objective in this paper is to develop a minimal theoretical framework of the dts method to describing the kinetic process of membrane breakage .",
    "based on the general framework of kramers reaction rate theory @xcite , we develop in this paper a theoretical framework for dts to describe the pore growth and membrane rupture dynamics as a markovian stochastic process crossing a time - dependent energy barrier . as mentioned , such a theoretical approach is conceptually similar to that used by evans et al . , @xcite ( see also , @xcite )",
    ". however , our description is more general than that presented in @xcite as it characterizes and describes both primary nucleation event followed by the continuous dynamics of pore growth and shrinking allowing hence easy to follow and adapt for further numerical treatments .",
    "in what follows , we treat the membrane as a two - dimensional continuum medium and we neglect shape fluctuations , i.e. , the parameter @xmath0 @xcite is small ( e.g. , @xmath1 for lipid bilayers )",
    ". we will deal with thermal fluctuations not related with shape fluctuations but with the process of barrier crossing for pore formation characterized by the parameter @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the typical energy cost for pore formation at the critical pore radius ( see eq.([pot ] ) below ) .",
    "thus , our investigations will concern the regime , @xmath4 .    within the framework of the dts",
    ", we describe the kinetic of membrane rupture as a succession of two processes : an initial pore nucleation followed by a diffusion dynamics of the pore size to membrane rupture .      for simplicity , we assume that the net process of pore nucleation in a membrane can be described by an activated process following a first - order kinetics with a rate @xmath5 , i.e.",
    ", the distribution of times for the membrane to remain free of pores is given by the exponential distribution with the rate , @xmath5 , which is a function of membrane characteristics .",
    "for the purpose of dts , we will assume that the pore nucleation rate @xmath6 is a function of membrane surface tension @xmath7 .",
    "once the pore is already formed in the membrane , the net energy @xmath8 of such a membrane of thickness @xmath9 with a circular pore of radius @xmath10 consists of two opposed terms @xcite : the surface tension @xmath7 , favoring the expansion , and the energy cost @xmath11 of forming a pore edge ( line tension ) , favoring the closure : @xmath12 assuming that @xmath13 and @xmath14 , and both are constant , eq.([fener ] ) predicts that for @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the pore radius for the maximum energy @xmath8 , the radial force associated with a change in radius tends to reseal the pore , and the membrane remains stable against pore growth .",
    "on the other hand , a pore with a radius larger than the critical value @xmath17 will grow without bound and , ultimately , will rupture the membrane . in dts experiments",
    "@xcite , the membrane is stressed such that ( provided that @xmath11 remains constant ) the surface tension grows linearly with time as , @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the unstressed membrane tension and @xmath20 is the loading rate constant . in this case , the critical radius @xmath21 becomes a decreasing function of time and any pore initially with radius @xmath22 will ultimately lead to membrane rupture at time such that @xmath23 as a result of the decreasing of both the critical pore radius and associated barrier energy .",
    "now , incorporating thermal fluctuations in this picture , one can view the rupture of the membrane as a brownian process crossing the time - dependent energy barrier @xmath24 $ ] .    to setup the equations of pore size dynamics",
    ", we consider a membrane with a pore of radius @xmath10 under mechanical stress that changes its surface tension . in this description model of dts",
    ", the surface tension @xmath7 in @xmath8 is a linear function of time as defined above .",
    "thus , neglecting inertial effects , the dynamics of @xmath10 is governed by the langevin equation with time - dependent potential , @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the friction coefficient to radial circular fluctuations with @xmath27 the internal 2d membrane viscosity , and @xmath28 is a gaussian random force of zero mean with correlation function given by the fluctuation - dissipation relation , @xmath29 , with @xmath30 being the thermal energy .      to work with dimensionless variables ,",
    "we define in table  [ tb1 ] scales of length , surface tension and time by @xmath31 , @xmath19 and @xmath32 , respectively , and we consider the following transformations : @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 ( with @xmath36 $ ] and @xmath37 ) .",
    "this operation leads us to define the control parameter , @xmath38 this parameter allows us to distinguish two regimes in the dynamics of the membrane rupture : the diffusion controlled regime when @xmath39 and the drift regime for @xmath40 limit . with these transformations eq.([lang1 ] ) can be rewritten as , @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a gaussian random force of zero mean with correlation function given by , @xmath43 , and we have defined the potential ( energy landscape for dts illustrated in fig  [ fig2 ] ) , @xmath44\\:\\:;\\:\\:\\varepsilon=\\frac{v(r_0)}{\\rm k_bt}=\\frac{\\pi\\gamma^2}{\\sigma_0{\\rm k_bt}}\\:.\\label{pot}\\ ] ] the potential @xmath45 is maximum at @xmath46 corresponding to the energy barrier @xmath47 .",
