    "cosmic inflation @xcite is a great idea to solve some cosmological problems and to predict the fine fluctuations of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",
    "hitherto the surviving and most economical model of inflation involves a single scalar field slowly rolling down its effective potential @xcite , with a canonical kinetic term and minimally coupled to the einstein gravity",
    ". we will call it the simplest single - field inflation , although there is still freedom to design its exact potential .",
    "the single - field inflation passed the latest observational test @xcite successfully , even with the simplest quadratic potential .",
    "nevertheless there are perpetual attempts to modify the simplest single - field inflation .",
    "some of them are motivated by incorporating inflation model into certain theoretical frameworks , such as the standard model of particle physics @xcite or string theory @xcite .",
    "some others put their stake on signatures that can not appear in the simplest single - field model , such as a large deviation from the gaussian distribution in the cmb temperature fluctuations .    among these modifications ,",
    "the two - field slow - roll inflation is the most conservative one , at least in my personal point of view .",
    "it introduces another scalar field rather than a non - conventional lagrangian such as non - canonical kinetic terms or modifications of gravity .",
    "it also retains the slow - roll condition , which makes the model simple and consistent with the observed cmb power spectrum . if both conventional lagrangian and non - conventional lagrangian are adaptable to the observational data , then the model with conventional lagrangian would be more acceptable , unless there are better and solid theoretical motivations for non - conventional lagrangian .    on the observational side ,",
    "two new features arise in two - field model .",
    "first , the model is able to leave a residual entropic perturbation between the fluctuations of dark matter and cmb @xcite .",
    "second , in a simple model with quadratic potential , numerical computations @xcite found that the non - gaussianity can be temporarily large at the turn of inflation trajectory in field space .",
    "longer - lived large non - gaussianities were discovered recently by @xcite in many other two - field models .    compared with the simplest one - field inflation ,",
    "the field space becomes two - dimensional in a two - field model .",
    "when the inflation trajectory is curved in field space , the entropic perturbation will be coupled to the adiabatic perturbation .",
    "so there are more uncertainties in calculation of cosmological observables , such as power spectra of cmb and their indices",
    ". it would be more complicated to honestly compute the bispectra and non - linear parameters , which reflect the non - gaussianity of the primordial fluctuations .",
    "fortunately , based on the extended @xmath0-formalism @xcite , vernizzi and wands @xcite invented an analytic method to estimate such non - gaussianities .",
    "they demonstrated the power of this method in a two - field model with additive separable potentials .",
    "this method was later applied by choi _",
    "et al_. @xcite to a model with multiplicative separable potentials .",
    "encouraged by the method of vernizzi and wands , we tried to improve it for the two - field slow - roll model with generic potentials but failed .",
    "finally , we only designed a larger class of models whose non - gaussianity can be estimated by this method .",
    "it is a class of models whose potential take the form @xmath1 with @xmath2 or @xmath3 . here",
    "@xmath1 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are arbitrary functions of the indicated variables as long as the slow - roll condition is satisfied .",
    "scalar fields @xmath6 and @xmath7 are inflatons .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in our convention of notations",
    ", we will prepare some well - known but necessary knowledge in section [ sect - preparation ] concisely . in section [ sect - hunt ] , we will present the exact form of our models , whose non - linear parameters will be worked out in sections [ sect - modeli ] and [ sect - modelii ] .",
    "some specific examples are investigated in section [ sect - examples ] .",
    "we summarize the main results of this paper in the final section .",
    "this is a note concerning references @xcite .",
    "some of our techniques stem from these references or slightly generalize theirs .",
    "sometimes we employ the techniques with few explanation if the mathematical development is smooth . to better understand them ,",
    "the readers are strongly recommended to review the relevant parts of @xcite .",
    "we are interested in inflation models described by the following action @xcite @xmath8.\\ ] ] because of the appearance of @xmath9 , the field @xmath7 has a non - standard kinetic term . following the notation of slow - roll parameters defined in @xcite",
    "@xmath10 the slow - roll condition can be expressed as @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 with @xmath14 .    as an aside , we mention that model is equivalent to the @xmath15 generalized gravity @xcite when @xmath16 .",
    "but then we find @xmath17 , which violates the the slow - roll condition .",
    "this is a pitfall in treating generalized gravity as a two - field model .",
    "this pitfall can be circumvented by the scheme in @xcite .    under the slow - roll condition ,",
    "the background equations of motion are very simple @xmath18 using them one may directly demonstrate @xmath19    observationally , the most promising probe of primordial non - gaussianities comes from the bispectrum of cmb fluctuations , which is characterized by the non - linear parameter @xmath20 . if @xmath21 , it would be detectable by ongoing or planned satellite experiments @xcite .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that the non - linear parameter in two - field inflation models can be separated into a momentum dependent term and a momentum independent term @xmath22 it is also proved in @xcite that the first term is always suppressed by the tensor - to - scalar ratio , leading to @xmath23 .",
    "hence this term is negligible in observation . for action",
    ", the second term @xmath24 may be large and deserves a closer look . here",
    "@xmath25 is the @xmath26-folding number from the initial flat hypersurface @xmath27 to the final comoving hypersurface @xmath28 . to evaluate",
    ", we will work out the derivatives of @xmath29 with respect to @xmath30 and @xmath31 in the next section , focusing on a class of analytically solvable models .",
    "making use of equations , the @xmath26-folding number can be cast as @xmath32 hence @xmath33 is an arbitrary function of @xmath6 and @xmath7 in principle , because @xmath34 along any classical trajectory under the slow - roll condition .",
    "however , for a given @xmath35 , we have to choose a suitable form of @xmath36 so that the integrations defined by @xmath37 in can be performed .",
    "later on we will fix @xmath36 to meet the ansatz for simplicity .",
    "but for the moment let us leave it as an arbitrary function of @xmath6 and @xmath7 . it is straightforward to obtain the first order partial derivatives @xmath38    akin to @xcite , we define an integral of motion @xmath39 along the trajectory of inflation @xmath40 here the explicit form of @xmath41 is determined by scalar potential @xmath42",
    ". we will give the expression of @xmath43 for some types of potential in this section .",
    "if we fix the limits of integration to run from @xmath44 to @xmath45 , then due to the background equations , @xmath46 along classical trajectories under the slow - roll approximation .",
    "so the constant @xmath39 parameterizes the motion off classical trajectories . in order to know @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 in",
    ", we should calculate the first order derivatives of @xmath39 on the initial flat hypersurface @xmath27 , @xmath51 differentiating with respect to @xmath39 , it gives @xmath52    on large scales , the comoving hypersurface @xmath28 coincides with the uniform density hypersurface .",
    "this implies under the slow - roll condition @xmath53 whose differentiation with respect to @xmath39 is @xmath54 combined with on the final comoving surface @xmath28 , it could give the solution for @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "this is in general difficult analytically . to overcome the difficulty",
    ", we introduce an ansatz : @xmath57    although we are free to design the function @xmath41 , the above condition is not always satisfiable .",
    "we have hunted for analytical models meeting this condition , and found it is achievable if @xmath58 with @xmath2 or @xmath3 .",
    "here @xmath1 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are arbitrary functions of the indicated variables as long as the slow - roll condition is satisfied . in this paper , we will pay attention to this situation .",
    "but it is never excluded that there might be other situations in which @xmath55 and @xmath56 are solvable from and , even if ansatz is violated .",
    "ansatz simplifies our discussion significantly . once it holds , equations and lead to @xmath59 while is reduced as @xmath60    as a result , the partial derivatives of @xmath29 take the form @xmath61 in these equations , we have adopted the notations @xmath62    in the above , the expression of @xmath37 and its derivatives involve nuisance integrals . to further simplify our study",
    ", we utilize one more ansatz @xmath63 in favor of this ansatz , we have @xmath64 and so do its derivatives .",
    "as was mentioned , ansatz can be satisfied by special forms of potential @xmath42 .",
    "now ansatz further constrains the form of @xmath42 and @xmath9 .",
    "let us discuss it in details case by case .      for this class of models",
    ", according to , we set @xmath65 while condition is met by @xmath66 or @xmath67 hereafter , as free parameters in our models , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 are arbitrary real constants .",
    "the normalization of @xmath74 is fixed for simplicity .",
    "this is always realizable by rescaling the field @xmath7 .",
    "taking @xmath75 , model recovers the well - studied sum potential @xcite , to which we will return in subsection [ subsect - sumpot ] . in subsection",
    "[ subsect - nspotii ] , we will study a specific example of non - separable potential that corresponds to @xmath76 in .    as will be discussed in subsection [ subsect - ieqii ]",
    ", there is an equivalence relation between case i in this subsection and case ii in the next subsection .",
    "models in class i can be transformed to those in class ii , and _ vice versa_. we will translate model to a nicer form and explore it .",
    "for this class of models , we take @xmath77 then condition is satisfied .",
    "condition can be met by @xmath78 or @xmath79 we observed that , and can be obtained from , and perfectly by the following replacement : @xmath80 in fact , there is a general equivalence relation between case i and case ii , on which will be elaborated in subsection [ subsect - ieqii ] .",
    "equation dictates @xmath35 implicitly as a differential equation . to obtain the explicit form of @xmath35",
    ", one should solve the equation .",
    "this could be done analytically in some corners of the parameter space .",
    "for instance , setting @xmath81 , equation gives @xmath82 however , if @xmath83 , it leads to a larger class of model @xmath84 leaving @xmath85 as an arbitrary function of @xmath6 .",
    "model or is separable and can be seen as the well - studied product potential @xcite .",
    "more discussion on models with product potential will be given in subsection [ subsect - prodpot ] .",
    "in the case that @xmath86 and @xmath87 , we find another model @xmath88 in subsection [ subsect - nspotii ] , we will study an example of non - separable potential which corresponds to @xmath75 in . since @xmath71 is an arbitrary real constant , equation can generate many other forms of potential @xmath35 .",
    "for example , when @xmath89 and @xmath90 , we get a model @xmath91      we have classified our models into two categories , corresponding to subsections [ subsect - casei ] and [ subsect - caseii ] . in case i",
    ", the potential @xmath1 is a function of sum @xmath2 . in case",
    "ii , the potential @xmath1 is a function of product @xmath3 .",
    "after the non - dimensionalization , case i can be translated to case ii by the transformation @xmath92 the last relation in is a corollary of the former ones because @xmath93 . on the other hand , via transformation , an arbitrary potential of case i can be transformed to that of case ii .",
    "so the two `` cases''are just two different formalisms for studying the same models .",
    "they are equivalent to each other .",
    "we are free to study a model in either formalism contingent on the convenience .",
    "for instance , using the formulae in this section , a model with potential @xmath94 and prefactor @xmath95 can be studied in two different formalisms :    * formalism i : @xmath96 , @xmath97 with @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 . *",
    "formalism ii : @xmath101 , @xmath102 with @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 .",
    "but apparently , for this model the calculation will be easier in formalism ii .",
    "because the dependence of @xmath35 and @xmath85 on @xmath6 and @xmath7 is unaltered , the quantization of perturbations is not affected by the choice of formalism . for the same reason ,",
    "the exact dependence of @xmath106 on @xmath6 and @xmath7 is the same in both formalisms .",
    "this model is given by , which is equivalent to model .",
    "corresponding to this model , the number of @xmath26-foldings and the integral constant along the inflation trajectory are @xmath109    we have defined the slow - roll parameters in . in the present case , they are of the form @xmath110    now equations and become @xmath111 while the function @xmath112 defined by takes the form @xmath113 then we get the partial derivatives of @xmath114 with respect to @xmath30 and @xmath31 , @xmath115 in terms of @xmath116.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with the above result at hand , it is straightforward to calculate @xmath117,\\\\ \\nonumber & & n_{,\\varphi_*\\chi_*}=-\\frac{2w^{*2}\\mathcal{a}}{\\alpha m_p^4u^*_{,\\varphi}v^*_{,\\chi}},\\\\ & & n_{,\\chi_*\\chi_*}=\\frac{1}{\\alpha m_p^2}\\left[\\left(1-\\frac{\\eta^*_{\\chi\\chi}}{2\\epsilon^*_{\\chi}}\\right)\\alpha v+u+\\frac{\\alpha^2}{\\epsilon^*_{\\chi}}\\mathcal{a}\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where for convenience we used notations @xmath118 for these notations , the relation @xmath119 holds . in the next section ,",

    "using formula we get the main part of non - linear parameter in this model @xmath122\\\\ & & + \\frac{v^2}{\\epsilon^*_{\\chi}}\\left[\\left(1-\\frac{\\eta^*_{\\chi\\chi}}{2\\epsilon^*_{\\chi}}\\right)\\alpha v+u\\right]+\\left(\\frac{u}{\\epsilon^*_{\\varphi}}+\\frac{v}{\\epsilon^*_{\\chi}}\\right)^2\\alpha^2\\mathcal{a}\\biggr\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the non - linear parameter depends on the exponent @xmath69 in a complicated manner . for the purpose of rough estimation , we assume both @xmath120 and @xmath121 are of order unity .",
    "this assumption is reasonable if @xmath123 , @xmath124 and @xmath125 are of the same order .",
    "it is also consistent with the relation @xmath119 .",
    "furthermore , motivated by the slow - roll condition and the observational constraint on spectral indices , we assume the slow - roll parameters are of order @xmath126 . in saying this we mean all of the slow - roll parameters are of the same order , which is a strong but still allowable assumption . after making these assumptions , we can estimate the magnitude of in three regions according to the value of @xmath69 .",
    "firstly , in the limit @xmath127 , we have @xmath128 .",
    "so the third term in curly brackets of is of order @xmath129 , while the other two terms are of order @xmath130 .",
    "consequently , we can estimate @xmath131 .",
    "it seems that a small value of @xmath69 could give rise to a large non - linear parameter .",
    "specifically , under our assumptions above , if @xmath132 , then the non - linear parameter @xmath133",
    ". however , this limit violates our assumptions . on the one hand , we have assumed @xmath134 . on the other hand ,",
    "equations tell us @xmath135 , which apparently violates our assumption in the limit @xmath127 .",
    "so we can not use the oversimplified assumptions to estimate the non - linear parameter in this limit .    secondly , for @xmath136 , we would have @xmath137 . then the last term in braces of is of order @xmath138 .",
    "the other terms can be of order @xmath139 .",
    "after cancelation with the prefactor , it leads to the estimation @xmath140 . that is to say , in this limit ,",
    "the non - linear parameter is independent of @xmath69 in the leading order and suppressed by the slow - roll parameters .",
    "the third region is @xmath141 . in this region ,",
    "the non - linear parameter is still suppressed , @xmath140 .",
    "our conclusion is somewhat unexciting .",
    "this model could not generate large non - gaussianities under our simplistic assumptions .",
    "however , one should be warned that our estimation above relies on two assumptions : @xmath142 and @xmath143 .",
    "although these assumptions are reasonable , they may be avoided in very special circumstances . to further look for a large non - gaussianity with our formula",
    ", one should give up these assumptions and carefully scan the whole parameter space in a consistent way .",
    "generally that is an ambitious task if not impossible .",

    "unfortunately , careful analysis ruled out this possibility . because the assumption @xmath158 implies @xmath159 , we find the non - linear parameter is not enhanced by @xmath71 but is suppressed by the slow - roll parameters , @xmath140 . the same suppression applies if @xmath71 lies in other regions .",
