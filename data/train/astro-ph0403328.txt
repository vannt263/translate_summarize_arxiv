    "the rotation induced oblateness of astronomical bodies is a classical problem in newtonian and celestial mechanics ( for the early history , see todhunter @xcite ) .",
    "it has twice played an important role in the history of science . in the early eighteenth century measurements indicated a prolate shape of the earth , in strong conflict with the newtonian prediction .",
    "this was later shown to be wrong by more careful measurements by maupertuis , clairaut , and celsius in northern sweden in 1736 .",
    "then , in 1967 , measurements of the solar oblateness were published and according to these it was much larger than the sun s surface angular velocity would explain . the confirmation of general relativity by mercury s perihelion precession",
    "would then be lost .",
    "also this problem is now gone and the modern consensus is that the solar oblateness is too small to affect this classic test of general relativity @xcite .",
    "the subject of the flattening of rotating astronomical bodies is thus quite mature .",
    "the classical theory is due mainly to clairaut , laplace , and lyapunov .",
    "also radau , darwin , de sitter and many others have made important contributions .",
    "more recent accounts of the theory can be found in , for example , jeffreys @xcite , zharkov et al.@xcite , cook @xcite , moritz @xcite and , partly , in chandrasekhar @xcite .",
    "some pedagogical efforts can be found in murray and dermott @xcite , or in kaula @xcite .",
    "as is plain from these references the theory is quite involved . only the unrealistic assumption that the body is homogeneous gives compact analytical results . otherwise a specified radial density distribution is needed and one resorts to cumbersome series ( multipole ) expansions , or purely numerical methods , for quantitative results . here",
    "we will present analytical results based on the assumption that the body consists of a central point mass surrounded by a homogeneous fluid , the so called point core model . by varying the relative mass of the fluid and the central point particle one can interpolate between the extreme limits of newton s homogeneous body and the roche model @xcite with a dominating small heavy center .",
    "the point core model goes back to the work of g.  h.  darwin .",
    "more recently it has been used to study the shape of outer planet moons , see hubbard and anderson @xcite , dermott and thomas @xcite .",
    "apart from the basic point core approximation ( i ) several further approximations are assumed here .",
    "these are : ( ii ) that the shape is determined by hydrostatic equilibrium and ( iii ) that the shape is ellipsoidal .",
    "these are not consistent . according to hamy s theorem ,",
    "see moritz @xcite , the exact shape is not ellipsoidal , so we regard an ellipsoidal shape as a constraint and find the equilibrium shape , among these , by minimizing the energy .",
    "a further approximation ( iv ) is the neglect of differential rotation .",
    "on the other hand fixed volume ( `` bulk incompressibility '' ) need not be assumed ; the equilibrium volume problem separates from the shape problem . in spite of these approximations , which are standard in the literature , the mathematics can be quite involved . in this article",
    "i hope to clarify and simplify it as much as possible .    mathematically our model then becomes a three degree of freedom mechanical system for which we can calculate the kinetic and potential ( gravitational plus centrifugal ) energies exactly .",
    "multipole expansions in terms of spherical harmonics are not needed .",
    "the three degrees of freedom correspond to the three semi - axes of the ellipsoid ( @xmath3 ) but these are transformed to three generalized coordinates that describe size ( or volume ) , @xmath4 , spheroidal , @xmath5 , and triaxial , @xmath6 , shape changes , see eq .",
    "( [ eq.def.xi.eta ] ) .",
    "the statics problem of equilibrium shape is solved by minimizing the potential energy , @xmath7 for a fixed @xmath4 , eq.([eq.energy.xi.tau ] ) . for slow rotation",
    "the shape will not be triaxial so @xmath8 .",
    "finding the shape , or flattening , is then only a matter of minimizing a dimensionless potential energy , @xmath9 given by the last two terms of eq .",

    "these appear to be , partly , new , and their usefulness is demonstrated by comparing with empirical data for the sun and the rotating planets of the solar system .",
    "variational methods have been used before to study similar problems , see for example abad et al .",
    "denis et al.@xcite have pointed out that variational methods generally fail to provide estimates of their accuracy .",
    "therefore the agreement of our formulas with empirical data , as demonstrated in table /cite(table ) , is important and demonstrates that our model catches the essential physics of rotational flattening .",
    "finally small amplitude oscillations near the equilibrium are investigated , starting from the lagrangian @xmath17 for our three degree of freedom model system .",
    "this gives useful insight into the physics of free stellar or planetary oscillations and their coupling to rotation .",
    "our approximations are , however , too severe for these results to be of quantitative interest .",

    "the formula for the volume of an ellipsoid now gives @xmath25 and we see that changes of @xmath5 and @xmath6 do not change the volume , only the shape of the ellipsoid",
    ".    in what follows we will also consider the special case of spheroids .",
    "a spheroid is an ellipsoid with two equal semi - axes .",
    "we take @xmath26 .",

    "more familiar parameters used to define the shape of a spheroid are the ellipticity @xmath0 and the eccentricity @xmath34 .",
    "the ellipticity is defined by @xmath35 this is sometimes also called the ( geometric ) oblateness or the flattening ( denoted @xmath36 ) . solving this equation , and expanding around @xmath37 , we have @xmath38{1-\\epsilon}}=1+\\frac{1}{3}\\epsilon + \\frac{2}{9}\\epsilon^2+o(\\epsilon^3).\\ ] ] one notes that @xmath0 is positive for oblate and negative for prolate spheroids respectively .",
    "the eccentricity , @xmath39 , is defined as the usual eccentricity of the ellipse that is the intersection of the spheroid and a plane containing the z - axis .",
    "one finds that @xmath40 gives the eccentricity of these ellipses in the oblate case . for the prolate case @xmath41",
    "consider a non - rotating spherically symmetric body consisting of point particles with masses @xmath42 and position vectors @xmath43 assume that rotation induces a deviation of the positions so that the new positions , @xmath44 , are given by @xmath45 this implies that we assume that the elastic displacement field can be parameterized by the shape parameters @xmath46 with non - rotating positions corresponding to @xmath47 .",
    "one notes that points @xmath48 that obeyed @xmath49 i.e.  were found on a sphere of radius @xmath50 , move to the surface given by @xmath51 the sphere is thus assumed to deform to an ellipsoid .",
    "assume that a body initially is spherically symmetric and has a mass density @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the ordinary distance from the center .",
    "it is tempting to assume that a natural deformation of the body when it starts to rotate is to a spheroidal shape in such a way that the originally spherical equidensity surfaces , @xmath54 , deform to similar spheroidal surfaces given by @xmath55 .",
    "unfortunately this is an approximation for real bodies . for a density that increases towards the center ,",
    "the ellipticity of the equidensity surfaces decrease with @xmath53 , in a manner described by clairaut s equation , see @xcite .",
    "note , however , that for a constant density , or a constant density with a central point mass , the assumption is not approximate , since any surface is an equidensity surface , only the shape of the outer surface matters .",
    "thus we now assume such a mass distribution . to be precise we assume that a mass @xmath56 is distributed with constant density @xmath57 inside the surface , @xmath58 , and that the point mass @xmath59 is at the center , @xmath60 , of the ellipsoid .",
    "the density @xmath61 is thus given by @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the three - dimensional dirac delta function .",

    "the square of this parameter , @xmath12 , also appears in the literature denoted @xmath70 ( or @xmath71 , or simply @xmath11 ) and is also called the moment of inertia coefficient .    we calculate the dimensionless moment of inertia @xmath12 for the undeformed @xmath61 of eq .",

    "this is the usual moment of inertia for a solid sphere of mass @xmath75 .",
    "this implies that @xmath76 is the squared ( dimensionless ) radius of gyration of the undeformed body .",
    "note that @xmath77 since the model can go between the limits of a point ( @xmath78 ) and a homogeneous sphere ( @xmath79 ) .    for the deformed body one gets , using ( [ eq.position.vectors.dep ] ) , @xmath80 @xmath81 is often denoted by @xmath82 . for spheroids ( @xmath8 )",
    "the other moments of inertia become @xmath83 for these one frequently finds the notation @xmath84 , and @xmath85 , respectively , in the literature .",
    "the quadrupole tensor , @xmath86 , is given in terms of the inertia tensor by @xmath87 it is identically zero for the undeformed body and diagonal for the same axes as the inertia tensor . for the spheroidal ( @xmath8 ) body its components are given by @xmath88 and @xmath89 thus @xmath90 ( or @xmath91 is positive for oblate and negative for prolate shapes .",
    "one measure of the oblate shape that is of great interest is the , so called , gravitational quadrupole @xmath92 .",
    "this dimensionless quantity , gives the deviation of the gravitational potential , @xmath93 , outside the body , from the simple @xmath94-dependence of spherically symmetric bodies .",
    "the first two terms in the multipole expansion of this potential are , see e.g.  stacey @xcite , @xmath95,\\ ] ] where @xmath96 is the polar angle ( colatitude ) in spherical coordinates , @xmath97 the total mass , and @xmath98 the equatorial radius of the body .",
    "one can show @xcite that @xmath92 of formula ( [ eq.grav.pot.j2 ] ) is given by @xmath99 .",
    "use of @xmath100 given in ( [ eq.quadrupole.comp.xx ] ) , and @xmath101 , then gives @xmath102 for the quadrupole .",

    ", one can derive a formula connecting @xmath92 with the angular velocity and the ellipticity .",
    "one uses that the shape of the surface is determined by the hydrostatic equilibrium equation @xmath104 where @xmath105 is pressure , @xmath61 mass density , and @xmath106 is the potential of the centrifugal force in a system rotating with angular velocity @xmath107 about the z - axis .",
    "this means that the surface of the body must be an equipotential surface of @xmath108 .",
    "the constancy of @xmath109 on the surface of the body can be used to derive the approximate relationship @xmath110 @xcite . here",
    "we have introduced the ratio @xmath2 of equatorial centrifugal to gravitational acceleration , @xmath111 here @xmath112 is the mean density . instead of @xmath2",
    "the notation @xmath113 occurs in the literature , see",
    "zharkov et al.@xcite , who reserve @xmath2 for the corresponding quantity with the equatorial radius @xmath98 replacing the mean radius @xmath4 ( recall @xmath114 ) .",
    "the advantage of the definition ( [ eq.acc.centrifug.grav.ratio ] ) is that it makes @xmath2 independent of flattening .",
    "the relationship ( [ eq.j2.alpha.epsilon ] ) , is only valid to first order in small quantities , so here the difference does not matter , but we will go to higher order below , so take notice .",
    "this relationship between the three quantities @xmath2 ( or @xmath113 ) , @xmath0 ( or @xmath36 ) , and @xmath1 , can thus be used to test the hypothesis of hydrostatic equilibrium empirically .",
    "this will be done below , using more exact results . for jupiter and saturn",
    "these will improve significantly on ( [ eq.j2.alpha.epsilon ] ) .",

    "there is a well defined theoretical average angular velocity ( essn @xcite ) but it is not directly observable . once an average angular velocity has been selected for the sun one can use the present theory and a theoretical @xmath12-value ( @xmath208 ) to estimate the solar oblateness and @xmath1 .",
    "the definition of average angular velocity in @xcite indicates that an angular velocity near the radius of gyration @xmath209 should be appropriate . the further assumption that angular velocity is constant on coaxial cylinder surfaces ( kippenhahn and weigert @xcite , ulrich and hawkins @xcite ) indicates that an angular velocity near the poles of the sun rather than equatorial angular velocity is relevant .    a handbook value @xcite for the polar angular velocity of the sun is @xmath210rad s@xmath211 .",
