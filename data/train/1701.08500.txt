    "zero forcing is an iterative graph coloring process where at each discrete time step , a colored vertex with a single uncolored neighbor forces that neighbor to become colored .",
    "the zero forcing number of a graph is the cardinality of the smallest set of initially colored vertices which forces the entire graph to be colored .",
    "zero forcing was initially used to bound the maximum nullity of the family of symmetric matrices described by a graph @xcite , but has since found a variety of uses in physics , logic circuits , coding theory , power network monitoring , and in modeling the spread of diseases and information in social networks ; see @xcite for more details .",
    "connected forcing is a variant of zero forcing in which the initially colored set of vertices induces a connected subgraph .",
    "the connected forcing number of a graph is the cardinality of the smallest connected set of initially colored vertices which forces the entire graph to be colored .",
    "various structural and computational aspects of connected forcing have been investigated in @xcite .",
    "the connected forcing number bounds parameters such as the maximum nullity , path cover number , and power domination number ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) ; it can also potentially be applied to power network monitoring and modeling propagation of information ( cf .",
    "other variants of zero forcing , such as positive semidefinite zero forcing @xcite , fractional zero forcing @xcite , and signed zero forcing @xcite have also been studied ; see also @xcite and the bibliographies therein .",
    "these variants are typically obtained by modifying the zero forcing color change rule , or adding certain restrictions to the structure of a forcing set .",
    "computing the zero forcing number and connected forcing number of a graph are both np - complete problems @xcite ; thus , approaches addressing the complexity of these problems include developing closed formulas , characterizations , and bounds for the forcing numbers of graphs with special structure ; such results are obtained in @xcite . in particular , graphs",
    "whose zero forcing number equals @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 have been characterized in @xcite , and graphs whose zero forcing number equals @xmath0 have been characterized in @xcite ; similarly , graphs whose connected forcing number equals 1 and @xmath3 have been characterized in @xcite . in this paper , we extend these results by characterizing graphs whose connected forcing numbers are 2 and @xmath0 .",
    "other related characterizations have been derived for graphs whose minimal rank is two @xcite and three @xcite , graphs whose positive semi - definite matrices have nullity at most two @xcite , three - connected graphs whose maximum nullity is at most three @xcite , and graphs for which the maximum multiplicity of an eigenvalue is two @xcite .",
    "many of these characterizations have been obtained using linear algebraic approaches ; in contrast , we employ novel combinatorial and graph theoretic techniques which make use of the vertex connectivity of a graph and the connectedness of its forcing set .",
    "we also present several other structural results , and introduce a generalization of zero forcing whose further study could be of independent interest .",

    "<S> zero forcing is an iterative graph coloring process where at each discrete time step , a colored vertex with a single uncolored neighbor forces that neighbor to become colored . </S>",
    "<S> the zero forcing number of a graph is the cardinality of the smallest set of initially colored vertices which forces the entire graph to eventually become colored . </S>",
    "<S> connected forcing is a variant of zero forcing in which the initially colored set of vertices induces a connected subgraph ; the analogous parameter of interest is the connected forcing number . in this paper , we characterize the graphs with connected forcing numbers 2 and @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> our results extend existing characterizations of graphs with zero forcing numbers 2 and @xmath0 ; we use combinatorial and graph theoretic techniques , in contrast to the linear algebraic approach used to obtain the latter . </S>",
    "<S> we also present several other structural results about the connected forcing sets of a graph .    </S>",
