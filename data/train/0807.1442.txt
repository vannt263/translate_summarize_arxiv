    "the t  expansion@xcite has motivated a great interest in the application of the connected  moments expansion ( cmx)@xcite and its variants@xcite to quantum  mechanical models . in spite of its limitations@xcite",
    "the cmx has proved useful for the study of many physical problems@xcite .",
    "recently , bartashevich@xcite proposed the connected  moments polynomial approach ( cmpa ) that yields approximate eigenvalues to all states as roots of a simple polynomial function of the energy with coefficients that depend on the moments of the hamiltonian operator .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to show that the cmpa is simply the rayleigh ",
    "ritz variation method ( rrvm)@xcite in a krylov subspace .",
    "it is our purpose to solve the eigenvalue equation @xmath0 by means of the rrvm@xcite in the krylov space spanned by @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is a properly chosen vector of the state space .",
    "the rrvm makes the trial function @xmath3 orthogonal to the subspace spanned by @xmath4 ; that is to say : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is one of the rrvm roots and an approximation to the corresponding eigenvalue .",
    "the coefficients @xmath7 are solutions to the secular equations @xmath8 where the matrix elements @xmath9 and @xmath10 are given in terms of the moments @xmath11 .",
    "there are nontrivial solutions to the homogeneous system of linear equations ( [ eq : secular ] ) only for the @xmath12 values of @xmath13 that are roots of the secular determinant @xmath14    it is well known that the rrvm approximate eigenvalues approach the exact ones from above : @xmath15}>w_{n}^{[n+1]}>e_{n}$ ] , @xmath16@xcite .",
    "this statement is not valid if by chance @xmath17 because @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and the eigenvector @xmath20 is bypassed by the method because it is orthogonal to the krylov space .",
    "here we assume that the rrvm converges , criteria for the convergence of the approach have been discussed elsewhere@xcite .",
    "it follows from ( [ eq : orthogonality ] ) that @xmath21 , which , by virtue of ( [ eq : trial ] ) , enables us to write @xmath22 and we conclude that if the coefficients @xmath23 satisfy @xmath24 then @xmath25 it is clear that we can arbitrarily choose @xmath26 and that the remaining coefficients @xmath23 , @xmath27 are identical to the @xmath28 of bartashevich@xcite .",
    "since equation ( [ eq : characteristic ] ) is satisfied by all the rrvm roots , we conclude that it is exactly the characteristic polynomial that results from the secular determinant ( [ eq : secular_det ] ) . in other words ,",
    "the cmpa is equivalent to the rrvm which explains why the cmpa sequences converge from above@xcite .    in our opinion",
    ", solving the well known determinantal equation ( [ eq : secular_det ] ) is probably easier than solving equations ( [ eq : pj_mui ] ) and ( [ eq : characteristic ] ) of bartashevich s cmpa .",
    "if we consider the @xmath12 equations ( [ eq : pj_mui ] ) plus ( [ eq : characteristic ] ) as a whole system of @xmath29 equations with @xmath29 unknowns @xmath30 , then we conclude that there will be nontrivial solutions provided that @xmath31 which is exactly the determinantal equation derived earlier by bishop et al@xcite .",
    "it is interesting to compare the original cmx approaches with the rayleigh ",
    "ritz variation method in the krylov space discussed above . for concreteness , we arbitrarily choose the so  called cmx - lt@xcite . fig  [ fig : convergence ] shows @xmath32 for the ground state of the dimensionless strongly ",
    "anharmonic oscillator @xmath33 . in both cases we chose the trial function @xmath34 , where @xmath35 , and calculated the `` exact '' eigenvalue @xmath36 by means of the riccati ",
    "pad method that exhibits remarkable rate of convergence for this kind of models@xcite .",
    "we appreciate that the rrvm converges smoothly from above while the cmx ",
    "lt exhibits great oscillation .",
    "the same situation takes places for other values of @xmath37 .",
    "we have shown that the cmpa is equivalent to the rrvm .",
    "consequently it applies to all the states and produces sequences of roots that converge from above .",
    "numerical difficulties in applications of the cmx have been attributed to singularities in the hankel matrix of connected moments which may not be invertible@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the hankel matrix of moments that appear in the calculation of the coefficients @xmath38@xcite ( or present @xmath23 s given by ( [ eq : pj_mui ] ) ) is always invertible .",
    "this is not surprising because one does not expect the rrvm to exhibit such kind of singularities .",
    "a numerical test on a simple anharmonic oscillator suggests that the rrvm may be more reliable that the cmx approaches ."
