    "the robustness of cluster mass estimates has become more and more important as galaxy clusters have been widely used as important cosmology tools ( e.g. , ebeling et al .",

    "precision cluster cosmology experiments using the mass function are based on accurately calibrated mass - observable scaling relations in terms of their shape , scatter , and evolution ( e.g. , vikhlinin et al . 2006 ; arnaud et al .",
    "2007 ) . to calibrate the mass - observable scaling relations ,",
    "the first necessary task is to obtain well - understood measurements of the cluster mass and observables ( e.g. , bhringer et al . 2007 ; zhang et al . 2006 , 2008 ) .",
    "x - ray measurements provide an important estimate of the cluster mass . with deep x - ray observations from _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ , one can precisely trace both temperature and electron number density distributions of the intracluster medium and thus measure the mass distributions with statistical uncertainties below 15% up to @xmath5 ( e.g. , vikhlinin et al .",
    "2006 ) . however , the accuracy of x - ray cluster mass estimates is limited by additional physical processes in the icm and projection effects .",
    "although the current total cluster mass calibration between two independent approaches , weak lensing and x - ray , shows an agreement ( e.g. , mahdavi et al .",
    "2008 , zhang et al.2008 ) , a radial dependence is found in the ratio of weak lensing and x - ray mass measurements ( e.g. , mahdavi et al .",
    "such a radial dependence is thought to be due to a bias in the hydrostatic mass estimates ( e.g. , nagai et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "cluster merging is one of many effects causing biases in the x - ray mass estimates .",
    "previous results on x - ray cluster maps ( e.g. , vikhlinin et al .",
    "2001 , markevitch et al .",
    "2003 , schuecker et al .",
    "2004 , finoguenov et al .",
    "2005 ) show that clusters are not simple hydrostatic equilibrium systems .",
    "both relaxed and unrelaxed clusters may be affected by additional non - thermal pressure processes .",
    "particularly , merging clusters of galaxies are often not in a hydrostatic equilibrium state .",
    "cluster mergers change the x - ray luminosities and temperatures of clusters , both in a transient sense and in the long term ( e.g. , ricker & sarazin 2001 ; poole et al . 2006 , 2007 ) , and also dramatically affect the properties of their galaxies ( e.g. , sun et al .",
    "the temperature distribution , as an important input in the x - ray mass estimate , can cause biases in the x - ray measured mass distribution .",
    "mergers seriously affect both mass estimates and observables , and thus the scaling relations of galaxy clusters ( e.g. , evrard et al .",
    "elimination of systematic uncertainties from the scaling relation calibration demands that major cluster mergers are identified and effects of major mergers on cluster mass estimates are quantified .",
    "substructure can be used to identify and trace the merging process and the substructure fraction can be used to link the cluster mass systematics with the mass assembly history ( e.g. , smith & taylor 2008 ) .",
    "substructure studies are enormously important to understand cluster mass estimates and the drivers of the scaling relations .",
    "cluster mergers create disturbances associated with both shocks and mixing of the stripped gas . as parameters controlling their relative importance , e.g. , the viscosity , are not so well constrained ( sijacki & springel 2006 )",
    ", it is unclear how much each contributes and at which scales each effect dominates .",
    "observationally , we are able to provide better constraints using spatial fluctuations of the temperature , electron number density , entropy and pressure maps .",
    "observational results can be compared with numerical simulations with different prescriptions to reveal more details of the merging physics .",
    "we aim to perform quantitative substructure studies using x - ray spectrally measured two - dimensional ( 2d ) maps to access the systematic errors in cluster mass measurements due to departures from hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "substructures in galaxy clusters have been intensely investigated since the _ rosat _ era using the x - ray surface brightness distribution from observations and simulations ( e.g. , jones & forman 1984 ; bhringer et al .",
    "2007 ; ventimiglia et al . 2008 ; piffaretti & valdarnini 2008 ) .",
    "however , substructures are less obvious in the x - ray surface brightness distribution than in the temperature distribution ( riemer - sorensen et al .",
    "2009 ; jee & tyson 2009 ; andersson et al .",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ telescopes , with their high spatial resolution , conveniently provide us the opportunity to perform substructure studies using also the temperature map .",
    "most such studies derive approximate x - ray temperature maps via x - ray hardness ratio maps ( e.g. , fabian et al .",
    "2001 , 2002 ; churazov et al . 2003 ; markevitch et al .",
    "2001 , 2005 ; finoguenov et al . 2005 ; zhang et al . 2005 ; forman et al .",
    "an alternative and more reliable way to derive x - ray temperature maps with high precision is to perform a spectral analysis in each spatial bin .",
    "this method avoids , for instance , spurious temperature variations due to underlying metallicity variations because the metallicity is determined simultaneously ( e.g. , henry et al .",

    "the orthogonal distance regression package ( odrpack  2.01 , e.g. , boggs et al . 1987 ) taking into account measurement errors on both variables is used for example , to derive correlations between observationally derived parameters .",
    "we use monte carlo simulations to evaluate the propagation of the errors in the x - ray mass modeling on all quantities of interest .",
    "spectrally measured 2d x - ray maps using most existing techniques require high photon statistics and are only applied to a few very nearby clusters / galaxies ( e.g. , henry et al .",
    "2004 ; reiprich et al .",

    "2004 ; pratt et al . 2005 ; sakelliou & ponman 2006 ; sanders & fabian 2007 ; simionescu et al .",
    "2007 ) . in most previous studies ,",
    "a relatively simple blank sky background subtraction was often applied .",
    "therefore , high signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) data are required to avoid large uncertainties caused by the background modeling .",
    "these technical limitations make this approach applicable only to targets with extremely good photon statistics , requiring 1 - 2 orders of magnitude higher exposures than the typical archival data for nearby clusters .",
    "it is a challenge to carry out such studies on medium quality data .",
    "a precise background subtraction method could make spectrally measured map analysis possible also for medium quality _ xmm - newton _ data to increase the size of the cluster sampling .",
    "snowden et al .",
    "( 2008 ) developed a precise background modeling method but only for the mos data and only to measure the radial temperature profile .",
    "we adopted their method and developed an advanced background modeling pipeline , which is applicable to both pn and mos data and which can be used to measure the spectral temperature for both the radial analysis and the map analysis .",
    "it allows us to perform reliable spectral analysis in each spatial bin to derive the x - ray maps , but for clusters with _ xmm - newton _ data with @xmath11  120,000 source counts in total .",
    "the xmmsas version 7.1.0 software combined with our in - house - developed pipeline is used for data reduction .      to demonstrate the robustness of the method and to determine the s / n threshold for such substructure studies",
    ", we composed a sample of four clusters showing different morphologies as well as different photon statistics in their _ xmm - newton _ data .",
    "four clusters of galaxies are selected from the highest x - ray flux galaxy cluster sample ( hiflugcs ; reiprich & bhringer 2002 ) according to the following criteria .",
    "( 1 ) the @xmath12 is the radius within which the density contrast to the critical density is @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath14 is the total mass within @xmath15 .",
    "for example , for @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the radius within which the density contrast is 200 and @xmath18 is the total mass within @xmath17 . the @xmath17 used here is derived from the cluster global temperature in reiprich & bhringer ( 2002 ) and the @xmath18-@xmath19 relation from simulations in evrard er al . (",
    "1996 ) . ] fits the _ xmm - newton _ field of view ( fov ) .",
    "( 2 ) the photon statistics are sufficient for the map analysis using spectral measurements but varies in a small range which gives 10 - 60 bins , of which the uncertainty of the spectrally measured temperature in each spatial bin is @xmath20% . ( 3 ) the background is mildly contaminated by flares .",
    "( 4 ) the map analysis has not already been published .",
    "the first criterion is important to measure the temperature distribution , and thus to guarantee reliable x - ray mass modeling to derive the mass bias .",
    "the second and third criteria are required to guarantee robust x - ray background modeling , particularly in the spectral analysis for the map analysis .",
    "in addition , the reason we chose those four clusters with slightly different photon statistics is to test how far from the cluster center and how reliably one can perform substructure studies with a range of data quality .",
    "such an investigation is important to justify the required photon statistics for substructure studies of galaxy clusters using x - ray maps on different levels .",
    "our empirical results will be useful for the community to sample clusters and to perform x - ray observations for such substructure studies .",
    "we set the fourth criterion in order to get new scientific results out of our tests .      to prepare the data",
    ", we apply iterative screening using a 2@xmath21 clipping as described in zhang et al .",
    "( 2006 , 2007 ) using both the soft band ( 0.3 - 10  kev ) and the hard hand ( 10 - 12  kev for mos and 12 - 14  kev for pn ) to filter flares .",
    "hereafter , we call those light - curve screened events for the clusters the target observations ( tos ) . the properties of the four clusters are presented in table  [ t : basic ] .      the `` edetect_chain '' command is used to detect point - like sources .",
    "point sources in the outskirts of the cluster are subtracted . in the cluster center , only these detected point - like sources carefully checked by eye and identified with detected point - like sources in chandra ( hudson et al .",
    "2009 ) are subtracted .",
    "there is good agreement between _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ detected central point - like sources .",

    "chandra_. for exo0422 , there are no evident point - like sources detected by _ chandra _ at the center .",

    "conservatively , we identify it as a point - like source and subtract it . for a0119 , there are no evident point - like sources in the cluster center in either _ xmm - newton _ or _ chandra _ data , co - spatial with a cd .      as also described in snowden et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , the following four background components have been taken into account in our background treatment .",

    "the fourth is the cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) .",
    "the treatment of the qpb and fxb has been documented using the filter wheel closed ( fwc ) observations for mos in snowden et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and for pn in freyberg et al .",
    "( 2006 ) .    as a first step to model the qpb and fxb",
    ", we extract the spectra using events out of the fov from the fwc observations to investigate the properties of the qpb and fxb using the 2 - 12 kev band as done in snowden et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and freyberg et al .",
    "the fwc mos1/mos2 ( pn ) spectrum can be well fitted by a `` powerlaw / b '' model together with six ( eight ) `` gaussian / b '' models to account for the fxb lines .",
    "the photon index of the `` powerlaw / b '' model , @xmath22 , is @xmath23 for mos1 ( reduced @xmath24 for 645 degrees of freedom ( dof ) ) , @xmath25 for mos2 ( reduced @xmath26 for 645 dof ) , and @xmath27 for pn ( reduced @xmath28 for 630 dof ) , respectively .",
    "the best fit provides reliable measurements of the `` linee '' parameter with a few percent precision and of the `` sigma '' parameter within a factor of 1.4 for the `` gaussian / b '' model . across the detectors we found the slope of the `` powerlaw / b '' is @xmath29 for mos and @xmath30 for pn , both varying by at most 15% .",
    "the properties of the fwc observations are consistent with the results found in de plaa et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and freyberg et al .",
    "( 2006 )    de luca & molendi ( 2004 ) pointed out that a simple renormalization of the qpb using the high energy band ( e.g. , 8 - 12  kev ) count rate may lead to systematic errors in both the continuum and the lines .",
    "we thus checked the out of fov - extracted spectra of @xmath31 tos .",
    "the slope of the individual tos is indeed inconsistent ( up to @xmath3250% ) with the stack fwc observations when the full 2 - 12  kev band is used .",

    "these ccds are then excluded as well for those observations .",
    "freezing the photon index of the `` powerlaw / b '' model and the `` linee '' and `` sigma '' parameters of the `` gaussian / b '' model to the best fit derived above using all events out of the fov from the fwc observations in the 3 - 10  kev , we obtained the normalization from the best fit .",
    "the renormalization factor ( @xmath39 ) of the continuum component is derived as the `` powerlaw / b '' normalization ratio of the to to fwc observations . the fwc spectrum ( @xmath40 )",

    "<S> recent work presenting the cluster maps showed an ability of x - ray maps to reveal and study cluster mergers in detail . here , we present a first attempt to use the study of substructure in assessing the systematics of the hydrostatic mass measurements using two - dimensional ( 2d ) x - ray diagnostics . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature map is uniquely able to identify the substructure in an almost relaxed cluster which would be unnoticed in the icm electron number density , and pressure maps . </S>",
    "<S> we describe the radial fluctuations in the 2d maps by a cumulative / differential scatter profile relative to the mean profile within / at a given radius . </S>",
