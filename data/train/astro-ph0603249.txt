    "this work studies the interaction of a rapidly rotating magnetized star with an accretion disk under conditions where the corotation radius of the star , @xmath0 , is less than the inner radius of the disk , @xmath1 .",
    "the radius @xmath2 is determined by the star s magnetic field and angular velocity as well as the mass accretion rate of the disk @xmath3 and the disk viscosity and magnetic diffusivity .",
    "disk accretion is disrupted for radii @xmath4 . at distances @xmath5",
    "the disk plasma acquires additional angular velocity due to  friction \" with the magnetosphere of the star which rotates faster than the keplerian motion of the disk .",
    "the behavior of the matter at @xmath2 depends on the ratio between angular velocity of the star and keplerian angular velocity at @xmath2 .",
    "the matter tends to be expelled from the disk if the centrifugal force is sufficiently larger than the gravitational force .",
    "this regime of interaction between a magnetized star and an accretion disk is called  propeller \" regime ( illarionov & sunyaev 1975 ) .",
    "this regime was investigated analytically ( e.g. , davies , fabian , & pringle 1979 ; lovelace , romanova , & bisnovatyi - kogan 1999 , hereafter - lrbk99 ; ikhsanov 2002 ; rappaport , fregeau , & spruit 2004 ; eksi , hernquist , & narayan 2005 ) , and numerically ( romanova et al . 2004b - hereafter rukl04 ; romanova et al .",
    "2005 - hereafter rukl05 ) .",
    "in the disk - magnetosphere interaction the magnetic field plays the main role in two processes .",
    "firstly , it disrupts the inner regions of the disk and thus determines the inner radius of the disk .",
    "secondly , the magnetic field determines the direction of plasma flow .",
    "matter of the disk at a distance @xmath6 is accelerated in the azimuthal direction if it is threaded by field lines connecting it with a star rotating more rapidly than the disk ; that is @xmath7 . in the opposite case where @xmath8 , the azimuthal motion of the disk matter is slowed down . in the first case the disk plasma gains angular momentum from the star and moves outward . in second case",
    "the disk plasma loses angular momentum and moves inward .",
    "thus , in the inner regions of the disk the action of magnetic field leads to enhanced accretion rate , while in the outer regions to reduced accretion or even to outflow of matter .",
    "the disk - magnetosphere interaction depends essentially on the ratio of the inner radius of the disk @xmath2 to the corotation radius @xmath9 . in the model",
    "studied here the location of the radius @xmath2 depends mainly on the magnetic field of the star and the disk accretion rate . in the absence of external plasma the magnetic field of the star",
    "is considered to be a dipole field with the magnetic moment @xmath10 parallel to the rotational axis .",
    "consequently the magnetic stresses are proportional to @xmath11 .    for @xmath12 , disruption of the disk",
    "is accompanied by the formation of `` funnel flows '' ( e.g. , ghosh & lamb 1978 ; knigl 1991 ; shu et al .",
    "funnel flows were recently investigated numerically using 2d and 3d mhd simulations ( romanova et al .",
    "2002 , 2003 , 2004a ) . in this paper",
    "we consider the opposite limit where @xmath13 . in this limit one",
    "expects that the closed field region of the star will contain relatively low - density plasma rotating with the star s angular velocity . outside of this region",
    "there is a relatively dense disk plasma threaded by open magnetic field lines .",
    "interaction between the two regions occurs by two processes : ( 1 ) by matter flow from open field lines to the closed field lines as a result of magnetic diffusivity ; and ( 2 ) angular momentum exchange between fast rotating matter of magnetosphere and slowly rotating disk .",
    "the first process can lead to penetration of significant amounts of matter with low angular momentum to the closed field lines .",
    "this can in turn lead to significant deformation of the field lines and possibly to their opening .",
    "the second process may lead to azimuthal acceleration of the disk matter sufficient to stop the accretion and to eject matter from the disk .",
    "an outflow from the system may occur .",
    "this paper treats disk accretion to a rotating magnetized star using magnetohydrodynamics . for the initial set up of the system",
    "we divide the space into the `` disk '' and the `` corona '' with a smooth transition between them .",
    "the disk is relatively cold and dense while the opposite is true for the corona .",
    "the disk and corona are separated by a specified level of density . in the disk",
    "we take into account viscosity and magnetic diffusivity of the plasma .",
    "we consider that both the viscosity and the magnetic diffusivity of the disk plasma are due to turbulent fluctuations of the velocity and magnetic field .",
    "we adopt the standard hypotheses where the molecular transport coefficients are substituted with the turbulent coefficients . to estimate the value of these coefficients , we use the @xmath14-model of shakura and sunyaev ( 1973 ) where the coefficient of the turbulent kinematic viscosity @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the isothermal sound speed and @xmath17 is the keplerian angular velocity at the given location .",
    "similarly , the coefficient of the turbulent magnetic diffusivity @xmath18 . here , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are dimensionless coefficients which are treated as parameters of the model .",
    "our numerical simulations have shown that the mhd flows which appear as a result of interaction between a rapidly rotating magnetized star and accretion disk can be divided to two types : `` weak '' and `` strong '' propeller . in the first case ,",
    "no outflows are observed ( rukl04 ) , while in the second case a large fraction of the mass accretion of the disk goes to the outflows ( rukl05 ) . in this paper",
    "we investigate regime of  strong \" propellers in detail .",
    "the inner disk radius @xmath2 is determined by the disk interaction with the magnetized star .",
    "the value @xmath2 varies with time significantly .",
    "we can consider however an average value of @xmath2 .",
    "this value depends on the parameters of the model which characterize both the star , its mass @xmath21 , magnetic moment @xmath22 , and angular velocity @xmath23 ; and the disk , the coefficients of viscosity and magnetic diffusivity , density , temperature and connected with them the accretion rate in the disk .",
    "the corona may also have a significant role . in order to decrease the influence of corona we have taken its density to be as low as possible . from the parameters of the model",
    "we can construct in addition to the corotation radius another important length termed the nominal alfvn radius , @xmath24^{1/7}$ ] ( e.g. , davidson & ostriker 1973 ) .",
    "here , @xmath3 is the disk accretion rate at large distances , which can be obtained from the simulations .",
    "another characteristic length can be obtained from the following .",
    "close to the star the magnetic field dominates , that is , the magnetic pressure is larger than the @xmath25 component of the momentum tensor of the matter @xmath26 . inside the region where the magnetic field dominates ,",
    "the plasma flow is controlled by the magnetic field and the flow is along the magnetic field lines .",
    "the boundary of this region follows from @xmath27 .",
    "this surface intersects the equatorial region along the circle with the radius @xmath28 , which we will call the magnetospheric radius .",
    "the strength of the propeller is determined by the value of the dimensionless ratio , @xmath29 or @xmath30 , and also by other dimensionless parameters of the model such as the @xmath14-coefficients of the viscosity and magnetic diffusivity .",
    "the characteristic feature of the disk - magnetosphere interaction in the strong propeller regime is the formation of an outflow of the disk matter along the opened magnetic field lines .",
    "this outflow is termed the `` wind . ''",
    "the matter outflows are strongest in the vicinity of the neutral line of the poloidal field , which starts approximately at the inner radius of the disk .",
    "this is the region of the most intense angular momentum transport from the fast rotating magnetosphere to the disk due to  viscous \" stresses . at the same time",
    "there is a magnetically dominated ( poynting ) `` jet '' which flows out along the opened magnetic field lines extending outward from the star .",
    "the wind has a large inclination angle relative to the rotational axis and for a very strong propeller it flows almost along the disk surface .",
    "in contrast , the jet becomes more collimated as the strength of the propeller increases .",
    "as the strength increases there is a sharp decrease of the accretion rate to the star .",
    "section 2 discusses theoretical approach to the problem .",
    "section 3 discusses our numerical model .",
    "section 4 discusses results and section 5 summarizes the work .",
    "for a stationary non - magnetic thin disk , the fluxes of matter @xmath3 and angular momentum @xmath31 are conserved along the disk ( see , e.g. , kato , fukue & mineshige 1988 ; lipunov 1992 ) @xmath32           r^2 \\left ( \\sigma v_r v_\\phi + \\tau \\right ) & = &           \\displaystyle{-\\frac{\\dot{l}}{2\\pi } } =   { \\rm const }   ~.\\\\         \\end{array}\\ ] ] here , @xmath33 is the surface density ; @xmath34 is the `` viscous '' stress acting in the disk , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are components of the flow velocity . here , @xmath37 is the inward mass flux , and @xmath38 is the inward angular momentum flux . from equations ( [ eq1 ] )",
    "we obtain @xmath39 here , @xmath40 is the angular velocity of the disk , and @xmath41 is an angular momentum per unit mass of the accretion flow .",
    "the viscous stresses are typically very small at the inner radius of the disk where the motion departs significantly from keplerian .",
    "the inner radius of the disk determined by this way is @xmath42 .",
    "the `` viscous '' stresses are determined by processes of turbulent fluctuations which are not fully understood .",
    "a simplified approach is commonly adopted where the @xmath43-component of the viscous stress tensor ( integrated over @xmath44 ) is expressed as @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is coefficient of turbulent viscosity . in the region of quasi - keplerian disk @xmath47",
    "@xmath48 @xmath49 @xmath50 three - dimensional simulations of the local regions of keplerian disks indicate that the viscous stress @xmath51 constitutes a fraction of the gas pressure ( integrated over @xmath44 ) in the disk .",
    "namely , @xmath52 , where @xmath19 is a dimensionless coefficient .",
    "the value of @xmath19 is in the rough interval @xmath53 ( balbus 2003 ) . comparing the last expression and ( [ eq3 ] )",
    ", we obtain the shakura - sunyaev formulae @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is an average isothermal speed in the disk",

    "the surface density @xmath56 is set by the local properties as well as the global quantity , the accretion rate @xmath3 .",
    "the same is true for the nominal inner radius of the disk @xmath57 , which is determined by the parameter @xmath58 . to understand how the processes at the inner edge of the disk influence the global characteristics of accretion process @xmath3 and @xmath31 , it is necessary to consider non - stationary processes .",
    "the continuity equation gives @xmath59 conservation of angular momentum gives @xmath60 = 0~.\\ ] ] if @xmath61 we obtain @xmath62 where @xmath63 is specific angular momentum .",
    "taking the first of equations ( 3 ) , @xmath64 and combining this equation with ( [ eq4 ] ) , and ( [ eq6 ] ) we obtain @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the angular momentum flux due to the viscous stress .",
    "the evolution of @xmath67 is described by a diffusion equation with diffusion coefficient @xmath68 .",
    "thus , perturbations generated for example by the star s magnetic field at the inner radius of the disk with periodicity @xmath69 diffuse out to distances @xmath70 . if @xmath71 , then @xmath72 .",
    "thus , disturbances of the inner part of the disk at say @xmath2 are not expected to influence the more distant parts of the disk at @xmath73 .      here , we consider the influence on the disk of an aligned dipole magnetic field of a rotating star following the treatment of lovelace , romanova , and bisnovatyi - kogan 1999(lrbk99 ) .",
    "the balance of mass , angular momentum and energy flows is considered in the region @xmath74 of figure [ r0 ] , where the surface @xmath75 is along the inner region of the disk , while the surface @xmath76 is sufficiently far away so that the flow can be considered to be undisturbed by the magnetic field of the star .",
    "the star s mass is @xmath21 , magnetic moment @xmath22 , and angular velocity @xmath23 .",
    "the accretion disk with accretion rate @xmath3 is located at @xmath77 and rotates approximately with keplerian velocity .",
    "the magnetosphere rotates with angular velocity of the star @xmath23 .",
    "it is accepted that the angular momentum flux through the surface @xmath75 is @xmath78 , where @xmath14 is a dimensionless constant which is an analogue of @xmath14-coefficient in the model by shakura - sunyaev . the inner radius of the disk @xmath2 is found to be @xmath79 here , @xmath80 is the corotation radius",

    "( we have simplified the lrbk99 treatment by taking @xmath83 in original formulae . )    equation ( [ eq8 ] ) was obtained under fairly general assumptions .",
    "however , the derivation assumed stationary conditions and a specific expression for the wind mass , energy , and angular momentum outflow was adopted from lovelace , berk , and contopoulos ( 1991 ) .",
    "equation ( [ eq8 ] ) implies that the inner radius of the disk @xmath2 or effective alfvn radius is determined not only by the mass and magnetic moment of the star and the accretion rate , but also by the star s angular velocity .    the processes giving the `` friction '' at the boundary between the inner edge of the disk and magnetosphere is treated phenomenologically by lrbk99 in terms of the dimensionless coefficient @xmath14 .",
    "the process evidently has a turbulent nature and needs a separate detailed investigation ( see , e.g. , rasttter & schindler 1999 ) .",
    "the interaction between the magnetized star and the disk depends significantly on the conditions in the corona",
    ". magnetic flux of the star extends into the corona and may thread the disk .",
    "we consider the corona to be a perfect conductor .",
    "differential rotation of the foot - points of magnetic field loops threading the star and the disk tend to inflate and open unless there are some opposing factors which suppress this tendency ( e.g. , gold & hoyle 1960 ; aly 1980 ; lovelace , romanova & bisnovatyi - kogan 1995 ; uzdensky 2002 ) .",
    "this was also confirmed by a number of numerical simulations ( e.g. , goodson , bhm & winglee 1999 ; fendt & elstner 2002 ) .",
    "one factor is the finite conductivity of the disk plasma which leads to reconnection of the inflated field lines ( e.g. , aly & kuijpers 1990 ; hayashi , shibata & matsumoto 1996 ; uzdensky , knigl & litwin 2002 ; yelenina & ustyugova 2005 ) .",
    "a second factor is the density of the corona . a sufficiently dense corona acts to inhibit opening of the magnetic field .",
    "alternatively , a rarefied corona favors the opening of field lines with the coronal field passing through a sequence of force - free configurations .",
    "the finite conductivity of the disk leads to the slippage of magnetic field lines relative to the disk matter and thus limits the build up of the toroidal magnetic field . a dense corona acts to oppose twisting of the magnetic field .",
    "we first consider the influence of the finite conductivity of the disk which is assumed to be thin . in a coordinate system attached to a point in the disk ohm s law",
    "is satisfied in the form @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the surface current density , @xmath86 is the electric field in the plane of the disk , and @xmath58 is the `` surface conductivity '' ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "thus , in the corona in the non - rotating frame , @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the flow velocity in the corona . in the disk , @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is the flow velocity in the disk .",
    "these relations can readily be combined to give @xmath92_t=0}~,\\ ] ] on the top side of the disk . here , @xmath93 is the surface magnetic diffusivity , @xmath94 is the unit normal to the disk , and index @xmath95 shows that at the left - hand - side only tangential to the disk components of vector are important . if we suppose that there is no outflow from the disk ( @xmath96 ) , then it follows from ( [ eq9 ] ) that a toroidal magnetic field is generated at its surface : @xmath97    in order to calculate the toroidal magnetic field we make a number of assumptions : first , for the coefficient of magnetic diffusivity we follow the shakura and sunyaev @xmath14 prescription , @xmath98 , here @xmath16 is an isothermal sound speed ( bisnovatyi - kogan & ruzmaiken 1974 ) .",
    "second , the magnetic field in the disk @xmath99 is taken to be the unperturbed dipole field of the star , @xmath100 .",
    "thirdly , the disk is assumed to rotate with keplerian angular velocity while the coronal matter above the disk rotates with the angular velocity of the star , @xmath23 . neglecting the variations of the tangential electric field @xmath86 across the disk , we obtain @xmath101 substituting ( [ eq11 ] ) to ( [ eq10 ] ) we obtain @xmath102 for @xmath103 there is a strong twisting of the magnetic field linking the star and the disk , latexmath:[\\[\\left| \\frac{b_\\phi}{b_z } \\right| = \\frac{2r    distance @xmath6 is far from the corotation radius where @xmath105 .",
    "this equation was derived earlier by lovelace et al .",
    "( 1991 ) .",
    "the discontinuity of the azimuthal component of the magnetic field at the disk surface @xmath106 means that there is a radial surface current flowing along the disk .",
    "the interaction of this current with the vertical magnetic field , @xmath99 , leads to the loss of angular momentum from both sides of the disk at the rate @xmath107 per unit surface area . for stationary conditions ,",
    "the conservation of the angular momentum balance gives @xmath108 = \\frac{rb_\\phi b_z}{2\\pi}= \\frac{\\mu^2}{\\pi \\alpha_{\\rm d}c_s r^4 } ( \\omega_*-\\omega_k)~.\\ ] ] assuming @xmath109 , and @xmath110 , this equation can be integrated to give @xmath111 where @xmath112 is a constant of integration .",
    "we identify the point @xmath113 , where @xmath114 , with the inner radius of the disk . at this distance",
    "the viscous and magnetic stresses lead to significant deviation of rotational velocity from keplerian . for a sufficiently large magnetic moment and a rapidly rotating star ,",
    "the deviation from keplerian motion is determined by the magnetic field .",
    "we can then estimate @xmath2 by comparing the first and the last terms on the right - hand side ( [ eq12 ] ) .",
    "this gives @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the nominal alfvn radius and @xmath117 is the hydrostatic thickness of the disk at the corotation radius .",
    "thus , @xmath118 .",
    "this derivation suggests that @xmath119 and @xmath120 .    in order to estimate the influence of the magnetic field on the disk",
    ", we consider a tube of field lines with one foot point frozen to the star and rotating with the angular velocity @xmath23 , and the other foot - point in the disk rotating with angular velocity @xmath121 .",
    "the field lines will be deformed due to the differential rotation and this gives rise to an azimuthal magnetic field component . furthermore , the field lines tend to open as a result of the differential rotation . at the same time",
    "the azimuthal component of the field acts in combination with the poloidal field applies a torque to the disk matter . to estimate the net effect on the disk",
    "we assume that the opening of the field lines occurs on a time scale @xmath122 , where @xmath123 at the surface of the disk .",
    "the magnetic stress on the disk during this process exerts a torque on the disk ( from both sides ) .",
    "the corresponding loss of angular momentum ( per unit area ) from both sides of the disk is @xmath124 .",
    "of course angular momentum per unit area of the disk is simply @xmath125 .",
    "the magnetic field will have a significant influence on the disk when @xmath126 assuming the disk to be roughly keplerian , @xmath127 with @xmath128 , and the magnetic field @xmath100 , we obtain the condition @xmath129 for the magnetic field to influence the disk motion .    in the limits of slowly and rapidly rotating stars , inequality ( [ eq13 ] )",
    "provides an estimate of the inner radius of the disk : for a slowly rotating star , @xmath130 , @xmath131 for a rapidly rotating star , @xmath132 , @xmath133 here , we have assumed @xmath134 , @xmath135 and dropped insignificant numerical coefficients .",
    "the first case corresponds to the situation where the corotation radius @xmath9 is much larger than the inner disk radius .",
    "the second case corresponds to the opposite inequality . in the first case",
    "the disruption of the disk occurs in the _ funnel flow _ regime .",
    "matter loses its angular momentum because of `` friction '' with the slowly rotating magnetosphere and accretes to the star along the dipole field lines , forming the funnel flows . in the second case the disruption of the disk occurs in the _ propeller regime _ where matter acquires angular momentum `` friction '' with the rotating magnetosphere and",
    "is driven away from the star , forming the outflows ( jets and winds ) .",
    "sketches of the flows are shown in the figure [ r1 ] .",
    "sketches of the radial variation of the disk angular velocity in the equatorial plane in the two cases are shown in figure [ r2 ] .",
    "the transition at @xmath5 between the magnetosphere region which rotates with the angular velocity of the star @xmath23 and the disk which rotates with keplerian angular velocity @xmath17 ( more exactly a part of the disk which rotates with quasi - keplerian velocity ) is not sharp , but instead occurs over some distance where instabilities may have a significant role .",
    "instabilities can act generate turbulence at the inner edge of the disk .",
    "we expect turbulence will be strongly developed in the `` propeller '' regime .",
    "figure [ r3 ] shows the dependence of the specific angular momentum @xmath136 on radius in the two cases .",
    "one can see that in the `` propeller '' regime there is a region where @xmath137 , which is the rayleigh criterion for axisymmetric instability ( chandrasekhar 1961 ) .",
    "the decrease of the angular momentum with the distance is only one of the reasons which may give rise to turbulence in the disk .",
    "nevertheless , it is reasonable to expect that the turbulent viscosity and magnetic diffusivity are significantly enhanced at the inner edge of the disk compared with the regions of the keplerian disk at larger distances .",
    "as discussed the nature of the interaction of the magnetized star with the accretion disk depends on many factors .",
    "nevertheless , we can try to classify the resulting configurations basing on the relations between three lengths , the corotation radius @xmath138 , the magnetospheric radius @xmath28 , and the inner radius of the disk @xmath2 .",
    "we recall that for @xmath28 we have in mind the location in the equatorial plane where @xmath139 it is convenient to use the radius @xmath28 for comparison with the other two radii even though it depends on the results of simulations .",
    "we also note that in the subsequent parts of the paper we will consider only the  propeller \" regime .",
    "that is , the star is rapidly rotating in the sense that @xmath140 .",
    "classification based on the ratio between @xmath2 and @xmath28 is not similarly clear , because all variables in the ( [ eq14 ] ) are rapidly varying functions of the position of the point .",
    "this is why significant variation of the parameters of the system , for example , the magnetic moment of the star , may not lead to significant variation of @xmath28 .",
    "an important quantity is sound speed in the corona , which determines variations of the density and pressure ( see section on initial conditions ) .",
    "results of our numerical simulations show that it is always a true that @xmath141 , but in spite of that the matter flow may have different morphology . in a number of cases the magnetic field forms configuration in which some of the poloidal field lines are well - collimated along the symmetry axis , while at larger distances the field part is pushed toward the equatorial plane ( rukl04 ) . in other cases",
    "the collimation along the open field lines is less prominent , but matter flows from the disk along the neutral layer where @xmath142 ( see also rukl05 ) .",
    "we trace such qualitative differences in the final picture of the disk - star interaction to the initial temperature or sound speed in the corona which determines the initial differences of density and pressure .    in the considered model we assume a cold quasi - keplerian disk surrounded by a relatively hot corona .",
    "the disk and corona are in the gravitational field of the central object , a star of mass @xmath21 which rotates with angular velocity @xmath23 around the same axis as the disk .",
    "the star has a magnetic moment @xmath10 which is aligned with the rotational axis of the star .    having in mind application of the results of the numerical modeling to t tauri type stars , we mention typical parameters , the mass of the star , @xmath143 g , its radius @xmath144 cm , the inner radius of the disk , @xmath145 cm , the magnetic field at the surface of the star ( in the equatorial plane ) , @xmath146 g , the temperature of the corona @xmath147 , and the temperature of the disk @xmath148 .",
    "the keplerian velocity at the inner radius of the disk is @xmath149 cm / s .",
    "the isothermal sound speed in the corona is @xmath150 cm / s ( for fully ionized hydrogen @xmath151 ) ; in the disk @xmath152 cm / s , where @xmath153ergs/(mol k ) is the gaseous constant .",
    "the magnetic moment of the star is @xmath154 g @xmath155 .",
    "we treat the density in both the disk and the corona as free parameters . for",
    "a fixed sound speed in the corona ( or the disk ) and a given magnetic field of the star , the choice of say the disk density determines the ratio of the alfvn speed and the sound speed , or equivalently the ratio of the magnetic and gas pressures .",
    "we chose the density such that in at least part of corona near the star , the magnetic energy density dominates , @xmath156 . at the inner edge of the disk",
    "the keplerian velocity is related to the sound speed as @xmath157 .",
    "we assume that the plasma flows are described by the equations of magnetohydrodynamics .",
    "further , we consider that any shock waves in the flow are outside of the considered region , for example , inside the considered region , on the surface of the star .",
    "this allows us to use an energy conservation equation in the form of an entropy continuity equation .",

    "we assume that the stress due to fluctuations of the velocity and the magnetic field can be represented in the same way as collisional viscosity by substitution of the turbulent viscosity coefficient .",
    "moreover , we consider that the viscous stress is determined mainly by the gradient of the angular velocity because the azimuthal velocity is the dominant component in the disk .",

    "bottom panels show energy fluxes carried by the magnetic field ( fig .",

    "one can see from figure 8c that significant energy is carried from the star by a poynting flux .",
    "figure 8 g shows the angular momentum flux carried by the viscous stress .",
    "this stress is large at the boundary between the disk and magnetosphere in the vicinity of the equatorial plane .",

    "it is evident that the disk has a sharp boundary both in density and in entropy .",
    "next , we evaluate the directions where most of the matter and angular momentum outflows . for this we calculated the distribution of the fluxes of matter and angular momentum as a function of @xmath266 ( the colatitude ) as a function of time at a given distance @xmath309 .",
    "figure 10 shows a plot of these distributions as a function of time .",
    "one can see that the matter flux to the wind is mainly in the range @xmath310 .",
    "thus , most of the matter flows into a wide - angle hollow - cone with a large inclination angle to the @xmath216axis ( figure 10a ) .",
    "there is also a flux of matter towards the star which is associated with the equatorial region of the disk .",
    "the angular momentum flux carried by matter has distribution similar to the distribution of the matter flux ( see figure 10b ) . the angular momentum flux carried by the magnetic field ( figure 10c )",
    "is concentrated in two stripes : @xmath311 ( near the axis ) , and @xmath312 ( closer to the disk ) .",
    "the larger flux is associated with the angular momentum outflow in collimated jet , along the field lines which start at the surface of the star .",
    "the other stripe , at larger angles @xmath266 is connected with the disk wind .",
    "the wide - angle , hollow - cone disk wind is similar to the stationary magnetocentrifugally driven winds predicted by blandford and payne ( 1982 ) and lovelace , berk , and contopoulos ( 1991 ) and first obtained and analyzed in mhd simulations by ustyugova et al .",
    "( 1999 ) . for such winds the angle of the poloidal field to the @xmath216axis at the surface of the disk @xmath313",

    "can have the angle @xmath315 less than @xmath316 ( ustyugova et al .",
    "2000 ; lovelace et al . 2002 ) .",

    "figures 11 ( a ,  d ) show distribution of the matter flux @xmath317 , and streamlines of matter flow at time @xmath307 .",
    "one can see that matter flows with the disk , then turns near the magnetosphere of the star and flows outward in a disk wind .",
    "some matter goes around the magnetosphere and flows to the jet along the field lines starting at the stellar surface .",
    "the white line shows the escape velocity @xmath318 . above this line @xmath319 .",
    "the color background of figures 11 ( b , e ) shows the plasma @xmath320 parameter .",
    "the dashed white line corresponds to @xmath321 .",
    "figures 11 ( c , f ) show isocontours of the @xmath322 which is the poloidal current flow through a horizontal disk @xmath323 centered on the @xmath216axis .",
    "figure 12 shows plots of different variables as a function of distance along a magnetic field line which starts from the disk in the vicinity of the neutral field line where the matter flux to the wind is the largest .",
    "the solid line shows the projection of the poloidal velocity onto this field line , the dashed line shows the projection of the velocity component normal to the magnetic field line .",
    "one can see that the poloidal velocity is nearly parallel with the poloidal field , which is in accord with the theory of stationary axisymmetric flows of ideally conducting plasma ( see , e.g. , ustyugova et al .",
    "the sound speed @xmath16 and escape velocity @xmath324 are also shown .",
    "one can see that the flow becomes supersonic and that the flow velocity exceeds the escape velocity @xmath324 .",
    "earlier , ustyugova et al . ( 1999 ) obtained dependences similar to those of figure 12 for the case of an ordered magnetic field threading a disk around a non - magnetized star .",
    "interaction of the magnetized star with the accretion disk can lead to the outflow and escape of a significant fraction of the matter incoming in the disk .",
    "we find in general that there is a _ jet _ and a _ disk wind _ giving outflows of energy , angular momentum , and matter from the system .",
    "the _ jet _ is identified as the flow in the region within the neutral line of the poloidal magnetic field .",
    "the magnetic flux in the jet is the flux emanating from the star .",
    "the _ disk wind _ is the flow outside of the neutral line of the poloidal magnetic field . for both outflows",
    "we take into account only the matter which has a velocity higher than the escape velocity @xmath324 .",
    "thus , the simulation region includes three flow regions , the disk , the jet , and the wind .",
    "these regions do not constitute the entire simulation volume because part of it is filled with relatively rarefied matter of magnetosphere and corona .",
    "accreting matter which is not accelerated to escape speed goes into the magnetosphere or the corona .",
    "these regions do not have a significant role in the matter and angular momentum flow .",
    "the star has an important role in absorbing mass and losing angular momentum .",
    "the star influences the plasma dynamics through the inner boundary of the simulation region .",
    "however the influence of the plasma on the star is noticeable on only an extremely long time scale .",
    "figure 13 shows the interactions between the different elements of the system .",
    "evidently , matter which comes through an accretion disk flows in part to the disk wind , in part to the jet , and in part accretes to the star .",
    "there is also angular momentum transport between different elements .",
    "the star represents a large reservoir of angular momentum which is transported to the disk through the closed field lines and to the jet through the open field lines .",
    "the positive direction of the fluxes is shown by arrows .    in all cases",
    "the fluxes of matter and angular momentum oscillate strongly in time , but always vary around an average value .",
    "see for example figure 10 . for this reason we calculated the time - averaged fluxes and investigated their dependences on the parameters of the model .",
    "we took as a base the mentioned reference case with dimensionless parameters @xmath325 , @xmath230 , @xmath281 , and @xmath282 .",
    "a series of simulations was then done to obtain the dependences of the time - averaged fluxes on different parameters .",
    "only one parameter was varied in each series .",
    "figures 14 - 16 show the derived dependences .",
    "figure 14 ( a - d ) show the dependences of the matter fluxes on our main parameters . here",
    ", @xmath326 is the mass accretion rate in the disk at the radius @xmath327 @xmath328 is the accretion rate to the star , @xmath329 is the matter flux to the wind , @xmath330 is the matter flux to the jet .",
    "as we mentioned , we distinguish between  strong \" ( with outflows ) and  weak \" ( no outflows ) propellers . results of modeling of the  strong \" propellers are marked with the filled symbols , while the  weak \" propeller results are indicated by open symbols .",
    "different symbols show different dependences : @xmath331 ( squares ) , @xmath332 ( circles ) , @xmath333 ( triangles ) , and @xmath334 ( gradient signs ) .",
    "the solid lines show approximations of these dependences .",
    "most of dependences could be approximated by a simple power law and have a clear sense .",
    "for example , the larger the magnetic moment @xmath22 and the larger the angular velocity of the star @xmath23 , the larger matter fluxes to the wind and jet and the smaller the accretion rate to the star . at smaller @xmath22 and @xmath23 , ejection of matter to the wind and jet becomes less efficient and we enter the  weak \" propeller regime with very weak or no outflows ( see fig . 14 a ,",
    "note , that all  weak \" propellers are on the left - hand side of the plots .",
    "it is interesting to look at dependences on viscosity , @xmath19 ( see fig .",
    "we see that matter fluxes to the wind / jet strongly increase with increase of viscosity , while the accretion rate to the star decreases .",
    "we conclude that the viscous stress contributes to launching the outflows . at sufficiently small viscosity , @xmath335 ,",
    "outflows are absent .",
    "the role of the viscosity is twofold .",
    "from one side , at larger viscosity , the  friction \" between the inner regions of the disk and magnetosphere is larger . from other side ,",
    "the radial velocity in the disk is proportional to @xmath19 , so that viscosity increases the matter flux per unit area and the inner region of the disk come closer to the inner regions of the fast rotating magnetosphere .",
    "both factors lead to enhanced outflows , but it is difficult to separate the two factors . in rukl05 test simulations",
    "were done for a case with @xmath336 , and with the density in the disk doubled .",
    "this of course increased the accretion rate but it also enhanced the outflows .",
    "figure 14d shows the dependence on the magnetic diffusivity .",
    "the dependence of the matter fluxes to the wind / jet on @xmath337 is more complicated than other dependences .",
    "namely , for @xmath338 , the fluxes @xmath329 and @xmath330 decrease with @xmath20 , because the mixing of the disk matter with the magnetic field of the magnetosphere become less and less efficient , and correspondingly the angular momentum transport from the star to the disk matter decreases . on the other hand , for @xmath339 , the diffusivity become too high , and the inner regions of the disk and magnetosphere are not coupled sufficiently to transport angular momentum .",
    "this explains the parabolic approximations of these dependences .",
    "we took into account all dependences shown in figures 14 ( a - d ) , and approximated them with analytic functions .",
    "we approximated the dependences on @xmath20 with power laws to the left and to the right of the dividing value @xmath340 . in figures 14 ( c - d ) , we show the dependences around @xmath341 and @xmath342 . we have made additional runs not shown in the plot at much smaller @xmath19 and @xmath20 , down to @xmath343 .",
    "also we have made runs for much larger values , up to @xmath344 .",
    "we show below dependences which incorporated all these runs , separately , for @xmath345 and @xmath346 .",
    "the matter fluxes to the wind @xmath329 , to the jet @xmath330 , through the disk @xmath326 , and to the star @xmath347 were approximated as : @xmath348 \\displaystyle{\\left(\\frac{\\alpha_{\\rm d}}{0.2}\\right)^{2 } } & \\alpha_{\\rm d } < 0.2        \\end{array } \\right.,\\ ] ] @xmath349 \\displaystyle{\\left(\\frac{\\alpha_{\\rm d}}{0.2}\\right)^{1.7 } } & \\alpha_{\\rm d } < 0.2        \\end{array } \\right.,\\ ] ] @xmath350 @xmath351    the matter flux to the disk wind increases with @xmath22 almost linearly and strongly increases with @xmath23 , while the accretion rate to the star @xmath352 strongly decreases .",
    "we note that dependences on @xmath22 and @xmath23 have a threshold character .",
    "namely , the matter fluxes to the wind and to the jet strongly decrease for @xmath353 and @xmath354 , where the system enters the  weak \" propeller regime ( see open symbols in figures 14 a , b ) .",
    "one can see from the figure 14b that the dependence of @xmath332 and @xmath331 on the angular velocity of the star @xmath23 also has a threshold behavior for @xmath355 .",

    "correspondingly , a larger part of the disk matter acquires additional angular momentum and flows to the jet and/or wind .",

    "we found the following dependences on different parameters : @xmath367 \\displaystyle{\\left(\\frac{\\alpha_{\\rm d}}{0.2}\\right)^{0.14 } } & \\alpha_{\\rm d } < 0.2~ ,        \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] @xmath368 \\displaystyle{\\left(\\frac{\\alpha_{\\rm d}}{0.2}\\right)^{0.5 } } & \\alpha_{\\rm d } < 0.2~.        \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ]    figure 16 ( a , b ) shows that both fluxes increase with @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "they increase with a similar rate so that the lines in figures 16 ( a , b ) are almost parallel .",
    "figures 16 ( c , d ) show that the fluxes depend only weakly on the @xmath14 coefficients of viscosity and diffusivity .",
    "they have maximum at @xmath358 .",
    "note that the angular momentum flux carried by the open field lines of the jet @xmath369 is similar to that carried by the closed field lines .",
    "that is , a star in the propeller regime in our range of parameters spins - down due to both : open and closed field lines .",
    "now , we can estimate the time - scale of spin - down for cttss and accreting neutron stars for parameters given in  3.4 .",
    "for cttss , the loss of the angular momentum of the star in our main case is @xmath370 .",
    "the star s angular velocity is @xmath371 , its angular momentum is @xmath372 , where @xmath373 .",
    "taking @xmath374 , the spin - down time - scale is @xmath375 years .",
    "note , that this time - scale was calculated for a magnetic field @xmath376 and a relatively low accretion rate , @xmath377 .",
    "the time - scale decreases with magnetic field of the star as @xmath378 and will be @xmath379 years for @xmath380 .",
    "time - scale also decreases with matter flux .",
    "thus , if cttss have a strong magnetic field in the past , then they were at the propeller regime and were spun - down in @xmath381 years .",
    "this time - scale is shorter than typical life - time of the cttss , which is @xmath382 years .",
    "we conclude that propeller mechanism may be responsible for fast spinning - down of cttss to presently observed slow rotation in the early stages of their evolution .    for an accreting neutron star , @xmath383 , @xmath384 .",
    "the star s angular momentum is @xmath385 .",
    "the time - scale of spin - down is @xmath386 years .",
    "this time - scale is shorter than expected life - time of millisecond pulsars in the accreting stage .",
    "however , millisecond pulsars have a different history of evolution compared to cttss , and they expected to be spined up during accreting stage ( bisnovatyi - kogan & komberg 1974 ) .",
    "however , the pulsar mechanism may be responsible for fast spinning - down of the pulsar during periods of decreased accretion rate .",
    "we performed a large number of axisymmetric mhd simulations and did extensive analysis of the interaction of a rapidly rotating magnetized star with an accretion disk in the propeller regime .",
    "the results can be divided to two classes ,  strong \" propellers and  weak \" propellers .",
    "the  strong \" propeller is characterized by the intense , wide - angle , conical matter outflow in the vicinity of the neutral line of the poloidal magnetic field and formation of well collimated , magnetically dominated jets along the rotational axis . in the  weak \" propeller regime",
    "there are no appreciable matter outflows from the disk and the collimated flow along the axis is much weaker .    in this work",
    "the four main parameters of the model were varied : the magnetic moment of the star , its angular velocity , and @xmath387 coefficients of the kinematic viscosity and magnetic diffusivity .",
    "we calculated time - averaged total fluxes of matter , energy , and angular momentum and investigated their dependences on the main parameters of the model .",
    "the average characteristics were calculated during @xmath388 periods of rotation of the inner disk .",
    "the derived dependences were approximated in most cases by power law functions .",
    "but some dependences showed a threshold character with the flux becoming negligible for a range of the parameters .    in all cases",
    "the interaction of the magnetized star with the accretion disk showed strongly non - stationary , quasi - periodic character .",
    "for example , in the reference case described in the paper , the typical  period \" of oscillations is several tens of our time - units .",
    "all fluxes of matter , energy , and angular momentum to the wind , jet , and star oscillate strongly with time .",
    "our simulation results are applied to classical t tauri stars and to millisecond pulsars .",
    "we conclude that propeller mechanism may be responsible for fast spinning - down of cttss to presently observed slow rotation during the first @xmath389 years of their evolution . in the case of accreting , magnetized millisecond pulsars ,",
    "the propeller mechanism may be responsible for relatively fast spin - down during periods of lower accretion .",
