    "great progress has been made towards an understanding of star formation ( sf ) on small scales in the milky way , but many open questions remain about its connection to large scale processes : what sets where sf occurs in galaxies and how efficiently gas is converted into stars",
    "? how important are global , galaxy - scale environmental parameters as opposed to small - scale properties of the interstellar medium ( ism ) ? what is the role of feedback in regulating sf ? to address such questions , theoretical modeling and simulations need to be constrained by comprehensive observations .",
    "both observations and theory have focused on the relationship between the star formation rate ( sfr ) and the gas density , for which a tight power - law relationship was observed in a large number of galaxies by @xcite .",
    "such a relationship was first suggested many decades ago by @xcite , who studied the distributions of atomic gas and stars in the galaxy . over the following decades , similar studies targeted individual local group galaxies , e.g. , m33 ( @xcite ) , the large magellanic cloud ( @xcite ) , and the small magellanic cloud ( @xcite ) . @xcite carried out the first comprehensive extragalactic study targeting a large sample of nearby galaxies and @xcite followed up this work , focusing on measurements averaged across galaxy disks . in a sample of 97 nearby normal and starburst galaxies",
    ", he found a close correlation between the galaxy - average total gas surface density ( @xmath6 ) and the galaxy - average sfr surface density ( @xmath2 ) . following this work ,",
    "it has become standard to study the relationship between gas and star formation via surface densities , which are observationally more easily accessible than volume densities .",
    "@xcite found @xmath7 , with intercept @xmath8 and power law index @xmath9  a relationship that is variously referred to as the `` star formation law , '' `` schmidt - kennicutt law , '' or `` schmidt law . ''",
    "@xcite derived @xmath10 . because the ratio @xmath11 describes how efficiently gas is converted into stars ( and",
    "is thus often referred to as the star formation efficiency , sfe ) , this super - linear power law index implies that systems with higher average gas surface densities more efficiently convert gas into stars ( left panel , figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "this measured value is close to @xmath12 , which is expected if the free - fall time in a fixed scale height gas disk is the governing timescale for sf on large scales .",
    "other studies working with disk - averaged , global measurements found @xmath9 to be in the range of @xmath13 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .     and @xmath14 for a large sample of nearby normal and starburst galaxies .",

    "makes it possible to look at how gas and sf relate within individual galaxy disks , opening up a wide range of environmental factors to explore .",
    "@xcite used bima song data ( @xcite ) to study 6 nearby spirals , @xcite explored a larger sample of nearby spirals , @xcite studied the local group galaxy m33 , and @xcite explored the gas - sf relation in m51 .",
    "these studies derived power law indices in the range @xmath15 , leaving it unclear whether a single relation relates gas and sf when galaxy disks are spatially resolved . further disagreement centered on the relationship of sf to different types of gas",
    " , h@xmath16 , and total gas .",
    "intuitively , one might expect a stronger correlation between sf and the cold , molecular phase , rather than the atomic phase .",
    "@xcite indeed found a much stronger correlation of @xmath2 with the molecular gas , @xmath3 ( compare figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "however , @xcite and @xcite both found a better correlation of @xmath2 with the total gas , @xmath17 , than with @xmath3 .",
    "one reason that different studies returned such different results were the wide range of sfr tracers employed in the various analyses .",
    "furthermore , different studies employed widely varying methods to correct the observed uv and h@xmath18 intensities for the effects of extinction by dust . because the correction factor is usually @xmath19 , the adopted methodology makes a large difference . a large step",
    "forward in this field came from the _ spitzer _ space telescope .",
    "as part of sings ( _ spitzer _ infrared nearby galaxies survey , @xcite ) , _ spitzer _ obtained high - resolution ir maps of a large sample of nearby galaxies . @xcite and @xcite demonstrated the utility of these maps to trace recently formed stars obscured on small scales , particularly when used in combination with h@xmath18  a tracer of unobscured star formation .    at the same time the vla large program things ( @xcite ) obtained the first large set of high resolution , high sensitivity 21-cm line maps for the same sample of galaxies .",
    "following shortly thereafter , the iram large program heracles mapped co emission for an overlapping sample of nearby galaxies ( first maps in @xcite ) . the result was , for the first time , a matched set of sensitive , high spatial resolution maps of atomic gas , molecular gas , embedded and unobscured star formation for a large sample of nearby galaxies .",
    "the resolution of the maps allowed hundreds of independent measurements per galaxy , leading to significantly improved statistics and the ability to carefully isolate regions with specific physical conditions .",
    "@xcite combined these data to compare , , and sfr across a sample of 7 nearby spiral galaxies .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the results of this analysis : the left panel shows @xmath0 , the middle panel @xmath3 , and the right panel @xmath20 versus @xmath2 ( derived from a combination of far uv and 24@xmath21 m emission ) .",
    "galex far uv emission was chosen to trace the recent , unobscured sf because of the low background in the fuv channel and the large field - of - view of the galex satellite . in these plots ,  and",
    "show distinct behaviors : the atomic gas shows no clear correlation with the sfr , whereas the molecular gas exhibits a strong correlation . as a result , the composite total gas - sfr relation is more complex than a single power law . in the combined ( total gas ) plot in the right panel",
    ", one can clearly distinguish where the ism is  dominated ( low gas columns , steep relation ) form where it is  dominated ( high gas columns , roughly linear correlation ) .",
    "if a power law is fit to the molecular gas distribution in the middle panel , one obtains @xmath22 .",
    "this can be restated as a constant ratio @xmath23 , which means that on average each parcel of  forms stars at the same rate .",
    "@xcite searched for correlations between @xmath23 and a number of environmental variables  ism pressure , dynamical time , galactocentric radius , stellar and gas surface density  and found little or no variation across the disks of 12 nearby spirals .",
    "on the other hand many of these same environemntal variables do correlate strongly with the -to-  ratio .",
    "the combined conclusion of these two studies was that the average depletion time in the molecular gas ( i.e. , @xmath24 ) of nearby spirals is fairly constant at @xmath25gyr , while the abundance of molecular gas is a strong function of environment .     versus @xmath0 ( left ) , @xmath3 ( middle ) and @xmath26 ( right panel ) for pixel - by - pixel data from 7 nearby spirals at 750pc resolution .",
    "the contours represent the density of sampling points ( pixels ) , where darker colors indicate a higher density .",
    "the  distribution saturates at about 10  m@xmath27  pc@xmath28 and shows no correlation with the sfr ( left panel ) .",
    "gas in excess of this surface density is predominently molecular .",
    "the middle panel illustrates the correlation between  and sfr , which can be described by a power law with slope @xmath22 .",
    "this implies a constant  depletion time of @xmath29gyr .",
    "the total gas plot ( right panel ) illustrates the different behavior of  and  dominated ism at low and high gas column densities , respectively.,width=576 ]    @xcite carried out a similar experiment to @xcite .",
    "they sampled the inner part of m51 with @xmath30pc diameter apertures and estimated local sfr surface densities from  emission .",
    "their integral field unit observations allowed for accurate estimates of internal extinction and corrections for contamination by the agn and diffuse ionized gas .",
    "they used a monte - carlo approach to incorporate upper limits into their power law fit .",
    "their results are in good agreement with @xcite regarding m51 in particular as well as regarding the general conclusions they reached : a virtual absence of correlation between sfr and , a strong correlation between sfr and  and a molecular gas depletion time that shows little variation with molecular gas column .",
    "recently , @xcite explored the impact of different sfr tracers and the role of possible contributions from diffuse emission and different sampling and fitting strategies on the relationship between @xmath3 and @xmath2 .",
    "they found that the sfr derived for low surface brightness regions is extremely sensitive to the underlying assumptions , but that at high surface brightness the result of a roughly constant  depletion time is robust .",
    "even more recently , schruba et al .",
    "( in prep . ) combined the heracles and things data to coherently average co spectra as a function of radius . with this approach",
    "they are able to trace molecular gas out to 1.2r@xmath31 , allowing them to study the relation between  and sfr where  dominates the ism .",
    "they demonstrate that the tight correlation between  and sfr crosses seamlessly into the -dominated outer disk ( left panel figure [ fig3 ] ) .    with so much effort expended measuring sfrs and gas densities over the years , it is interesting to ask whether the literature largely agrees .",
    "the right panel in figure [ fig3 ] shows a collection of literature measurements along with the data from @xcite . after matching underlying assumptions about how to derive physical quantities from the observables ,",
    "the literature data populate a well - defined locus in @xmath2@xmath26 space .     versus @xmath3 from schruba et al .",
    "( in prep . ) .",
    "they apply a stacking analysis to the heracles co data to probe the -sfr relation far into the regime where @xmath32 .",

    "_ right : _ comparison between different datasets using different methodologies from @xcite .",
    "the contours are identical to the right panel in figure [ fig2 ] and the overplotted symbols come from studies using a variety of sfr tracers and methodologies .",

    "the composite sample occupies a well - defined locus in @xmath33 space.,title=\"fig:\",width=240 ]    with some consensus emerging on the broad distribution of data in sfr-  space , attention is turning to the origin of the intrinsic scatter in the sfr-  ratio .",
    "@xcite looked at this as a function of spatial scale in m33 and showed that scatter in the co - to - h@xmath18 ratio increases dramatically once a resolution element contains only a single star - forming region ( i.e. ,  region or giant molecular cloud ) .",
    "this occurs at scales of @xmath34  pc in m33 but should be a function of the environment studied .",
    "they interpreted this finding as a result of the evolution of these regions , so that information on the life cycle of giant molecular clouds is embedded in the @xmath2-@xmath3 relation , especially at high resolutions .",
    "another avenue of investigation is the role of the host galaxy in driving the scatter in the sfr-  ratio .",
    "@xcite and @xcite found little environmental dependence of this quantity in large spiral galaxies , but with the completion of the heracles survey ( @xmath35 galaxies spanning from low - mass dwarfs to large spirals ) we can now apply a similar analysis to a much wider sample of galaxies .",
    "bigiel et al .",
    "( in prep . ) and schruba et al .",
    "( in prep . ) explore how scatter in the sfr - to-  ratio breaks into scatter _ within _ galaxies and scatter _ among _ galaxies .",
    "they find that scatter among galaxies dominates the relation , with a clear trend evident so that less massive , more metal poor , later type galaxies show systematically higher ratios of sfr - to- .",
    "@xcite saw this trend using integrated fir - to - co ratios .",
    "these new analyses show that once these galaxy - to - galaxy variations are removed , galaxies exhibit a very tight internal -sfr relation .",
    "maps reveal atomic gas out to many optical radii in spiral galaxies and over the past few years , galex uv observations have revealed widespread sf in the outer parts of many galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these outer disks have fewer heavy elements , less dust , and lower stellar and gas surface densities than the inner parts of spiral galaxies .",
    "contrasting the gas - sfr relationship in outer disks with that in the inner parts of normal galaxies gives a chance to assess the impact of these parameters on sf .    in the left panel of figure [ fig4 ]",
    "we show the results of a pixel - by - pixel analysis of outer galaxy disks : the open contours show @xmath2 versus @xmath26 for a sample of 17 spiral galaxies at 15 \" resolution ( corresponding to physical scales between 200pc and 1kpc ) from @xcite .",
    "sfrs are estimated from galex far uv emission and @xmath26 is estimated from hi emission alone , assuming a negligible contribution from molecular gas on @xmath36kpc scales in outer galaxy disks . for comparison ,",
    "the filled contours show sampling data from the star forming disks of 7 spiral galaxies from @xcite ( compare the right panel in figure [ fig2 ] above ) . in the outer disks ( open contours ) @xmath4 scales with @xmath26 , i.e. , @xmath0 , though the scatter in @xmath2 for a given  column is large .",
    "this is an interesting difference compared to the inner parts of spiral galaxies , where the  showed no clear correlation with @xmath2 ( compare section [ subkpc ] ) .     versus @xmath26 for the outer ( open contours ) and inner ( filled contours ) parts of nearby spiral galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "the combined distribution reveals multiple regimes : at large radii and low surface densities , @xmath2 scales with @xmath37 . over most of the area in disks ,",
    "@xmath2 is a very steep function of @xmath26 , with the -to-  ratio being the key determinant of @xmath2 . at high column densities ,",

    "the inferred  depletion time is about a hubble time at large radii , much longer than the molecular gas depletion times measured in many nearby spirals.,title=\"fig:\",width=240 ]    the -fuv relation observed for outer disks suggests two things .",
    "first , that at large radii the availability of  may be a bottleneck for star formation .",
    "even if stars form directly from , molecular clouds must be assembled from  and this will only be possible in regions with enough  to assemble these clouds .",
    "second , in the inner parts of galaxies many physical conditions important to the -conversion change while @xmath0 remains approximately fixed , but in the outer parts @xmath0 varies while other environmental conditions show comparatively little variation . as a result ,",
    "@xmath38 transitions from being a relatively unimportant driver for sf in the inner parts of galaxies to a key quantity at large radii .",
    "this is apparent from the right panel of figure [ fig4 ] , where we use extremely deep fuv data from galex and  data from things to trace sf and  out to almost four optical radii in the nearby spiral m83 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the  depletion time ( -to - sfr ratio ) inferred from the radial profiles in this plot is approximately constant at large radii : it is about a hubble time , i.e. , much longer than the @xmath29gyr molecular gas depletion time scale observed in the inner parts of galaxies .",
    "this suggests relatively fixed conditions for molecular cloud formation and that assembling , rather than forming stars out of , is the rate - limiting process for sf in outer disks .",
    "the combined distribution ( inner and outer disks ) in the left panel of figure [ fig4 ] can be divided into different parts according to gas column density , each part describing the relation between gas and sfr in a particular regime in a typical spiral galaxy disk . for low gas columns ( outer disks ) ,",
    "the sfr scales with gas column , though with significant scatter . at smaller radii and higher gas columns",
    " corresponding to much of the area inside the star - forming disk  the distribution becomes much steeper . in this regime , knowing @xmath26 alone is not enough to predict @xmath2 with any accuracy . across this regime",
    "the -to-  ratio is varying steadily as a function of other environmental quantities . at yet smaller radii and higher gas columns , the dominant phase of the ism transitions from atomic to molecular and a strong correlation emerges between @xmath26 and @xmath2 .",
    "there is good observational evidence ( e.g. , @xcite ) that at higher gas columns , the relation steepens further , so that the sfr - per-  ratio is higher in starburst galaxies than in normal galaxy disks .",
    "this may drive the frequent observation of @xmath39 in starburst galaxies .",
    "however , it must be emphasized that there is currently a lack of data probing normal disk galaxies and starbursts in a self - consistent way , so the details at the high end of this relation remain uncertain .",
    "with vast improvements in the data available for nearby galaxies some consensus is beginning to emerge on how different parts of galaxies populate the @xmath2-@xmath26 parameter space .",
    "the role of environmental quantities other than gas surface density alone are beginning to become clear and different relations are emerging for different types and parts of galaxies . when viewed in detail the composite relation may not be a simple power law , but it contains key information to constrain theories and to benchmark simulations .",
    "challenges remain , too .",
    "the determination of star formation rates at low surface brightness is still difficult .",
    "the use of co to trace  underpins almost all of this work but the co - to-  conversion factor remains imprecisely calibrated as a function of environment .",
    "finally , the fundamental units of star - formation , individual molecular clouds , remain largely observationally inaccessible beyond the local group  a situation that will not change until alma begins its full operations .",
