    "one of the ways to combat artificial spectrum scarcity  @xcite is to augment existing radio access techniques with opportunistic spectrum access  @xcite ( osa ) .",
    "wireless networks with osa capabilities are able to search for unused licensed portions of the radio spectrum and communicate over those vacant radio frequencies whenever available radio capacity is insufficient , while meeting the required interference constraints .",
    "orthogonal frequency division multiple access ( ofdma ) is a multiple access technique where orthogonally - divided frequency subcarriers are assigned to individual users of the network .",
    "a subcarrier assignment is usually performed by a central entity , often base station ( bs ) , and can be based on the quality of service ( qos ) requirements of the individual users . because of high spectral efficiency , as well as robustness against inter - symbol interference , ofdma was a design choice of recent wireless networking standards , e.g. the ieee 802.16  @xcite , the ieee 802.20  @xcite and 3gpp long term evolution  @xcite . as opportunistic spectrum use",
    "can be implemented efficiently with ofdma , it seemed natural to connect the strengths of ofdma with the flexibility of osa .",
    "the first paper that introduced such concept , denoted in the reminder of this paper as opportunistic spectrum ofdma ( os - ofdma ) was  @xcite ( referred therein as spectrum pooling ) where ofdm subcarriers assigned to individual osa users ( denoted as secondary users ( sus ) ) are deactivated whenever the primary user ( pu ) of the radio frequency band reappears . for a recent discussion on the topic of os - ofdma please refer to  @xcite .",
    "so far no theoretical work on the system - level and cross - layer performance of os - ofdma networks has been reported .",
    "the need for theoretical framework for os - ofdma is also motivated by the recent introduction of osa network standard ieee 802.22  @xcite .",
    "the ieee 802.22 , an extension of the ieee 802.16 standard , is designed to operate in the vacant tv bands . in the application domain",
    "the ieee 802.22 has already been proposed to bridge remote wireless sensor networks with the command center  @xcite or support internet connectivity in the rural areas  @xcite .",
    "our goal is to develop the analytical framework to analyze the impact of traffic characteristics of os - ofdma network subscribers , the activity of the pus of the radio spectrum , as well as the spectrum sensing algorithm and ofdm subcarrier assignment algorithm on the average throughput of os - ofdma network .",
    "our approach is based on a cross - layer markov chain - based analysis of os - ofdma , which allows the investigation of interactions between medium access control and spectrum sensing layer .",
    "since many options of os - ofdma subcarrier and subchannel assignment algorithms exist ( namely , non - continuos subchannel assignment , as advocated by  @xcite , and continuos version , as used in the ieee 802.22  @xcite ) it it is important to compare these designs using common analytical framework .",
    "in addition , analysis of two - stage spectrum sensing algorithm , proposed by the ieee 802.22 standard , is challenging due to its complex effect on the medium access control layer and has not been explored in the context of os - ofdma communication .",
    "finally , in the context of the ieee 802.22 analysis could provide estimates of what qos classes can be supported in os - ofdma , given realistic network conditions ( such as number and type of primary users , the number and type of qos classes enabled by os - ofdma network and the priority order in channel access for each class of users ) .",
    "considering related work , in  @xcite a general framework of the ieee 802.16 with osa capabilities has been proposed with a very simplified networking model , based on erlang - b formula  ( * ? ? ?",
    "v - a ) , where the focus of the paper has been mostly on propagation calculations , including coverage , interference and protection distances . in",
    "@xcite a simulation platform for the ieee 802.22-like network , with limited set of odfma design options , has been presented .",
    "focusing on the ieee 802.22 , interestingly , while many papers analyzed a certain functionality of the ieee 802.22 network , like efficient spectrum sensing algorithm design  @xcite , circuit design for dedicated spectrum sensing  @xcite , mimo extensions for the ieee 802.22 physical layer  @xcite , game theoretic analysis of the the ieee 802.22 networks coexistence  @xcite ,  @xcite ( with joint resource allocation ) , duplexing schemes  @xcite ( frequency hopping operation ) ,  @xcite ( time division duplex design ) , and mesh establishment  @xcite , it is desirable to develop unifying model that captures the ieee 802.22 intrinsic features such as multiple classes of traffic , two stage spectrum sensing , different types of pus and their temporal activity , and ofdma subcarrier allocation process .",
    "the work closest to the scope of this paper can be found in  @xcite in which the ieee 802.16 system was evaluated .",
    "obviously the model developed therein can not be used directly to evaluate os - ofdma system due to the lack of spectrum sensing and pus activity features .",
    "a work similar in our scope ( analyzing the system level aspects of subchannel / subcarrier allocation strategies for os - ofdma ) has been presented in  @xcite . however ,",
    "no comparison with the the ieee 802.22 subchannel assignment has been considered .",
    "furthermore , no qos classes , pu priorities and two - stage spectrum sensing mechanisms were included in the model .",
    "finally , we need to mention a set of papers analyzing performance of medium access control protocols for osa networks . some of the relevant ones include  @xcite , however none of those works consider ofdma , usually abstracting underlying physical channel structure .    in this paper",
    ", we propose an analytical framework to quantitatively assess the performance of a network based on os - ofdma , considering features such as channelization structure , subcarrier allocation , resource assignment to network subscribers and different spectrum sensing methods . in the model we consider different priorities and channel dwell times of sus and pus of the spectrum .",
    "the developed model allows to calculate capacity ( measured in terms of average throughput ) for real - time and non - real time qos classes of os - ofdma network .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "system model describing os - ofdma network design options in detail is presented in section  [ sec : system_model ] . analytical model for evaluating throughput of the considered system",
    "is presented in section  [ sec : analysis ] .",
    "numerical results follow in section  [ sec : numerical_results ] .",
    "finally the paper is concluded in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "we consider a centrally controlled network with os - ofdma , where a bs manages resources and coordinates spectrum sensing of individual os - ofdma network subscribers .",
    "although the proposed model is applicable to both uplink and downlink traffic , for simplicity we assume that only downlink traffic is transmitted . in this paper , we constrain ourselves to a single cell configuration with multiple sus and multiple pus , belonging to different user classes .",
    "this allows the exclusion of the effect co - channel and adjacent channel interference , as well as co - existence mechanisms in osa network , on the investigation of the relation between pu type , its activity level and os - ofdma design options .",
    "on the other hand , we consider transmission errors due to fading and noise on the subchannels .    a model of the osa protocol stack under consideration",
    "is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : systemmodel ] .",
    "we identify two main modules : ( i ) data transmission , which is responsible for regular data communication between sus , and ( ii ) spectrum sensing , which is responsible for efficient detection of spectrum opportunities for the osa network ; see also  @xcite for a similar model .",
    "each component has its unique physical ( phy ) and medium access control ( mac ) layer .",
    "obviously each layer has its unique design options , for example channel and subchannel management algorithms and multi - stage sensing .",
    "also osa network can be described by individual parameters such as type of traffic , activity level and bandwidth used . in section  [ sec : system_configuration ] we introduce specific os - ofdma system configurations considered in this paper . later in section  [ sec : design options ]",
    "we introduce the spectrum sensing and mac design options of interest .",
    "we aim to calculate the average throughput obtained at the data mac layer for all classes of su traffic , which will be described in detail in section  [ sec : user_types ] .",
    "the frequency domain consists of @xmath0 channels , each of which is composed of @xmath1 ofdma subchannels .",
    "the total number of subchannels is thus @xmath2 .",
    "each subchannel is further composed of ofdm subcarriers . in this paper , we constrain ourselves to subchannel domain analysis .",
    "furthermore , we assume that subchannel throughput @xmath3 is on average constant , while its average value depends on the physical layer characteristics such as modulation , error control coding , and mac layer overhead such as the ofdma preamble length .    in the time domain ,",
    "transmission segments are divided in frames of length @xmath4 . at the beginning of each frame ,",
    "sus of osa network detect the presence of the pu .",
    "we implicitly assume a synchrony between pu and su activity , as it is a well established and classical assumption in the theoretical analysis , see for example recent publications of  @xcite ,  ( * ? ? ?",
    "2 ) ,  ( * ? ? ?",
    "iii ) ,  ( * ? ? ?",
    "1 ) ,  ( * ? ? ?",
    "2 )  @xcite that follow the same path .",
    "note , however , that the proposed model is extendable to the case where pu slots are offset in time from su slots .",
    "this would require further analysis of pu channel access policies  @xcite which is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we emphasize , as in  @xcite , that assumption about the synchrony between pu and su connections allows to calculate throughput upper bounds compared to transmission on a slot - asynchronous interface .",
    "furthermore , we assume that each node in the osa network observes the same signal emitted by the pu , thus each su performs all the sensing measurements individually and sends the measurement result to bs on the uplink .",
    "then , bs makes a final decision about the presence of pu on each subchannel .",
    "we consider different types of pus and sus .",
    "for the pus , depending on the bandwidth and the activity level , we classify them into :",
    "( i ) a wideband pu ( wpu ) having low activity , i.e. with long busy and long idle times , and ( ii ) a narrowband pu ( npu ) having high activity , i.e. with short busy and shorter than wpu idle times .",
    "this classification makes the analysis more detailed and realistic .",
    "it also makes different scenarios of interest possible to analyze .",
    "for example , wpu can represent wireless video links , while npu can represent wireless microphones , both operating in the tv bands .",
    "for sus , again making our framework general and applicable to multiple scenarios , we consider two types of users : ( i ) those receiving real - time traffic , denoted as the constant bit rate ( cbr ) sus , and ( ii ) those receiving elastic traffic , denoted as variable bit rate ( vbr ) sus , which are included in the the ieee 802.22 standard . in our osa network model ,",
    "different types of su traffic flows are generated at the upper layers , i.e. application , network and transport , and forwarded down to data phy , while pu signals are detected at the spectrum sensing module , see fig .",
    "[ fig : systemmodel ] .",
    "furthermore , we assume that a hierarchical structure of users is present , such that the wpu has the highest priority in accessing bandwidth , npu is the second in access hierarchy , followed by cbr and finally vbr .",
    "in other words , if users of different classes could access the same subchannel , the lower priority class user must vacate in order for the higher priority class user to utilize the subchannel .",
    "the evacuated cbr switches to the other idle subchannels or drops the connection if there is no idle subchannel available . for vbr ,",
    "if the pu is detected , the active vbr connection squeezes the bandwidth  ( * ? ? ?",
    "iii - b ) excluding the channel or subchannel occupied by the pu , and if there is no channel detected as idle , it buffers data until the pu disappears .",
    "note that the behavior of vbr promises to obtain highest possible throughput , as demonstrated in  ( * ? ? ?",
    "v - b and fig .",
    "6 ) , assuming no switching overhead , while cbr does not consider buffering due to the excessive delay that this class might experience while waiting for wpu or npu to vacate the bandwidth .    because of the finite channel capacity , the number of users considered in the system is finite , but different for different user types .",
    "we assume that at most @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 of wpus , npus , cbr and vbr connections , respectively , can be active at the same time in the considered bandwidth  ( * ? ? ?",
    "iii - b ) .",
    "for the data traffic of sus and pus , for analytical tractability , we assume that all users generate new connections according to the negative exponential distribution for the inter - arrival time and burst departure time , which is again a classical assumption in performance analysis studies  @xcite .",
    "the analysis can be extended to the general distributions of pu and su traffic , which is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "note , however , that the recent measurement campaign  @xcite showed that more than 60% of measured pu activities distributions , including ism and cellular bands , fitted an exponential distribution .",
    "the average inter - arrival and departure time are denoted , respectively , as @xmath9 and @xmath10 for wpu , @xmath11 and @xmath12 for npu , @xmath13 and @xmath14 for cbr , and @xmath15 and @xmath16 for vbr .",
    "also we assume that connection of each class except for vbr occupies a fixed number of subchannels .",
    "we denote the instantaneous number of subchannels utilized by a connection class as @xmath17 for wpu , @xmath18 for npu , @xmath19 for cbr and @xmath20 for vbr .",
    "note that the number of subchannels assigned to every connection is fixed and @xmath19 , @xmath17 , @xmath21 , except for a vbr connection . in that case",
    "@xmath22 , which stems from the fact that one data frame consists of a group of ofdma symbols and the symbols in the ofdma frame can be assigned to multiple vbr connections . also , for vbr connections , the burst departure time depends on the number of subchannels used by vbr , thus @xmath16 is an average departure time when one subchannel is assigned to the vbr connection .        sensing phy senses the pu signal and passes the measurement about subchannel availability to the sensing mac layer for further processing .",
    "when a pu is present on the subchannel , it transmits a signal with a certain power and/or unique feature .",
    "thus by detecting the power and/or the feature , the su can decide whether the pu signal is on the subchannel or not .",
    "the main parameters for the spectrum sensing phy are the probability of detection , the probability of false alarm and the sensing time .",
    "there is a trade - off between the sensing time and the resulting probabilities  @xcite .",
    "that is , if a su takes a long time to sense a subchannel , the time for data transmission may be reduced .",
    "however , more idle subchannels can be detected because of high accuracy , which in turn may increase bandwidth utilization .",
    "therefore , sensing time and sensing accuracy are the critical design options for the sensing phy .",
    "in the sensing mac layer , the sus decide collectively , with the help of bs , on the pu state on the subchannel based on the sensing results of the sensing phy layer .",
    "we denote the detection based on multiple users as collaborative sensing and that based on multiple periods as multi - stage sensing .",
    "since the performance of collaborative sensing is relatively well known , see for example  @xcite , in this paper , we focus mostly on multi - stage sensing . for the first results of multi - stage spectrum sensing in network context refer to  @xcite for two - stage sensing multi - channel system , and  @xcite for two - stage sensing single channel system .    in this work we limit ourselves to two - stage sensing , noting that our analysis can be directly extended to multi - stage sensing .",
    "the procedure works as follows .",
    "first , the su senses the subchannel coarsely at the beginning of every frame , with short sensing time and low sensing accuracy .",
    "if the pu is detected , the su switches to fine sensing mode ( immediately , in the same frame ) , with long sensing time and high sensing accuracy . depending on the sensing strategy ,",
    "fine sensing can increase sensing accuracy  @xcite or frequency resolution  @xcite .",
    "two - stage sensing can be described by different sensing phy parameters for each stage .",
    "we denote the probability of detection as @xmath23 and @xmath24 , the probability of false alarm as @xmath25 and @xmath26 , and the sensing time as @xmath27 and @xmath28 for coarse and fine sensing stages , respectively .",
    "when setting @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 the two - stage sensing model reduces to a single stage sensing model .    in order to evaluate the effect of spectrum sensing on the system throughput , we consider two unique sensing strategies .",
    "firstly , we consider a sensing strategy where the su senses all channels , including the operating channel , with coarse sensing and when the su detects the pu on any of the channels , it immediately switches to fine sensing .",
    "we name this strategy as general two - stage sensing and denote it as s@xmath32 .    secondly , for a specific case when the bandwidth to transmit data is fixed and less than the whole allowed bandwidth , we investigate the following strategy . during coarse sensing the su senses not the whole bandwidth but only a fixed bandwidth that is currently utilized for data transmission . if the pu is detected on the channel , the su immediately senses all channels allowed to be utilized for the osa system with fine sensing and switches to one of the the channels detected as idle .",
    "we name this strategy as two - stage active channel sensing and denote it as s@xmath33 .",
    "since in this strategy , in contrary to s@xmath32 , there is no need to always sense all channels , the sensing time is reduced .      even though the osa network is aware of subchannels being idle or busy",
    ", it should determine how to utilize the subchannels detected as idle for data transmission .",
    "there are numerous methods to utilize the idle subchannels in an osa context , for a good overview we refer to  @xcite .",
    "however , we selectively study four strategies that are proper for the centrally - controlled os - ofdma - based network .",
    "those four strategies can be classified into two groups based on the purpose of the strategies .",
    "firstly , we need to determine how much bandwidth is utilized for data transmission from the channels detected as idle .",
    "one strategy is to utilize all channels detected as idle from the allowed bandwidth .",
    "this strategy may maximize channel utilization at the cost of the wideband rf and signal processing .",
    "we name this strategy as variable channel / subchannel bonding and denote it as b@xmath33 . on the other hand ,",
    "another strategy is to transmit data through only one channel , even though there may exist more channels detected as idle . because the su operates on the bandwidth of only one channel",
    ", the cost for the rf and signal processing is low .",
    "however , it is inefficient because some available bandwidth may not be utilized .",
    "since it is one of the operating modes of the ieee 802.22 , also advocated by federal communications commission  @xcite , we also include it in our study .",
    "we name this strategy fixed channel selection and denote it symbolically as b@xmath32 .",
    "secondly , we also need a strategy to avoid utilizing the subchannels on which the pu is detected . an efficient strategy is to notch out the subchannel detected as busy and utilize all other available subchannels for os - ofdma .",
    "we name this strategy subchannel notching and denote it as n@xmath33 . note",
    "that we assume for simplicity that it is possible to notch out subchannels and transmit on the adjacent subchannels without causing interference , which is a common assumption in system level analysis , e.g.  @xcite . on the opposite side ,",
    "a conservative strategy is to exclude ( block ) all subchannels within the operating channel from accessing , even though only one subchannel is utilized by the pu , which is suggested for the ieee 802.22 .",
    "we name this strategy channel blocking and denote it symbolically as n@xmath32 .",
    "please note that channel switching delays is in the order of tens to hundreds of microseconds  @xcite which is a fraction of the channel sensing time .",
    "dependent on protocol design , an additional ofdma frame might be needed to communicate the decision about channel switch between base station and terminals . for simplicity channel switching delay",
    "is neglected in the analysis .      because we have three groups of binary choices , i.e. s@xmath34 , n@xmath34 , and b@xmath34 , where @xmath35 , there can be eight possible combinations of design options . however , not all options are feasible .",
    "first , we do not consider the combination of subchannel notching ( n@xmath33 ) and fixed channel selection ( b@xmath32 ) , since it is a special case of n@xmath33b@xmath33 configuration with a single channel .",
    "also , for two - stage active channel sensing ( s@xmath33 ) , we only consider channel blocking ( n@xmath32 ) and fixed channel selection ( b@xmath32 ) , because two - stage active channel sensing ( s@xmath33 ) is applicable to fixed bandwidth utilization case only .",
    "this leaves four combinations of the design options which are summarized in table  [ tab : options ] .",
    "note , that all options except s@xmath32n@xmath33b@xmath33 , are considered by the ieee 802.22 standard .",
    ".summary of design options of considered in the paper [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : sens_setup ]    the results are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : sensing ] .",
    "first interesting observation is that two stage sensing does not always provide better performance than single stage sensing . comparing the total throughput at @xmath36 with @xmath37ms of all os - ofdma options ,",
    "two stage sensing shows worse performance than single stage sensing .",
    "this result is due to high probability of false alarm for this range of @xmath38 , see table  [ tab : sens_setup ] .",
    "in addition , for this network setup , the throughput is maximized at @xmath39ms and is larger than for @xmath36 which confirms that two - stage sensing can indeed benefit all os - ofdma operations .",
    "this also confirms that the design choice of the ieee 802.22 for spectrum sensing method was correct .",
    "when @xmath38 increases beyond the point for which the throughput is largest , the throughput of all os - ofdma implementations starts to rapidly decrease .",
    "this is due to the fact that the sensing overhead starts to dominate over potential improvement from decreased false alarm rate .",
    "this so called sensing - throughput tradeoff is in agreement with a similar investigation in the context of osa ad hoc networks  @xcite .",
    "note that the relation between sensing time and the obtained throughput are the same when looking at total , cbr and vbr throughput , see the shapes of all curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : total_ts ] , fig .",
    "[ fig : cbr_ts ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : vbr_ts ] .",
    "also , the different order in obtained throughput for each os - ofdma implementation are due to the specific os - ofdma options , not due to spectrum sensing parameters selected .",
    "for that , compare , e.g. , the position of s@xmath33n@xmath32b@xmath32 in fig .",
    "[ fig : total_ts ] with the position of the same implementation in fig .",
    "[ fig : cbr_ts ] . for",
    "more on this aspect please refer to section  [ sec : pu_activity_impact ] .",
    "finally , note that the simulation results match well with the analysis for all os - ofdma implementations .",
    "in this paper we have proposed an analytical model that allows the comparison of different designs of os - ofdma .",
    "we have considered design options that include channel bonding , subchannel notching and two stage spectrum sensing . as a performance metric",
    "we have derived average throughput obtained by the secondary users of the spectrum . in the analysis we have included the inter - relations of different connection classes and priorities , like constant and variable bit rate traffic of the secondary users , and wideband and narrowband primary users .",
    "we concluded that os - ofdma design that allows the flexible bonding of channels and notching of subchannels currently occupied by the primary users , obtains the highest throughput in comparison to the designs that do not consider those options .",
    "as one of our numerical results show , the improvement reaches couple of hundred percent when the activity level of the different primary user types is very high . also , as our investigation show , the two - stage spectrum sensing technique used in os - ofdma proves to increase the average network throughput , provided the probability of false alarm in the coarse sensing stage is low .",
    "if the inter - arrival time has a negative exponential distribution with average arrival rate @xmath42 , the number of connections generated in a frame of length @xmath4 has a poisson distribution .",
    "however , because we limit the maximum number of users to @xmath43 , the number of users including newly generated connections , @xmath44 , can not exceed @xmath43 . considering this",
    ", we derive the probability of @xmath45 new connections being generated in a frame , @xmath40 , as @xmath46 note that the subscript @xmath47 indicates the class of users , i.e. , @xmath48 for wpu , @xmath49 for npu , @xmath50 for cbr , and @xmath51 for vbr .",
    "further , denoting the departure rate of each connection as @xmath52 , the probability that @xmath53 connections are released from @xmath44 active connections during a frame of length @xmath4 , @xmath54 , can be calculated recursively as @xmath55 which after some manipulation reduces to @xmath56 since we only consider the connection release probability for users within the duration of a frame we abbreviate @xmath57 .",
    "in @xmath58 in ( [ eq : p11 ] ) , @xmath59 subchannels include @xmath60 subchannels that are occupied by pus but mis - detected and @xmath61 subchannels correctly detected as idle .",
    "therefore , @xmath62 , and thus to compute @xmath58 we define a supporting probability , @xmath63 , which is the probability that the number of subchannels detected as idle correctly and falsely are @xmath61 and @xmath60 , respectively .    in design option s@xmath32",
    ", a su performs the coarse sensing for all subchannels first , and then , if the su detects a pu on a subchannel , it immediately switches to fine sensing and senses all subchannels again with high sensing accuracy .",
    "thus , for a condition @xmath64 ( only coarse sensing is performed ) , the number of subchannels detected as idle must be the same as the number of all subchannels , i.e. @xmath65 .",
    "in other words , the case @xmath66 is impossible for the condition @xmath64 . for the condition @xmath67 ( no idle subchannel",
    "is detected after all stages of sensing ) only the case @xmath68 is possible . for @xmath69 , using the detection probability @xmath70 and the false alarm probability @xmath71 in the fine sensing stage , we can derive the probability that @xmath60 busy subchannels are mis - detected and @xmath61 idle subchannels are correctly detected for given @xmath72 wpus and @xmath73 npus .",
    "thus , @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 is the number of subchannels actually occupied by pus .",
    "therefore , @xmath58 can be derived as @xmath77",
    "to derive @xmath78 we need to consider the following three cases . first , if the osa network mis - detects existing pus and correctly detects all idle subchannels in the coarse sensing stage , @xmath64 because osa network will not advance to fine sensing .",
    "second , if the osa network detects at least one pu correctly or falsely in the coarse sensing stage and detects all subchannels as busy also correctly or falsely in the fine sensing stage , @xmath67 because after coarse and fine sensing no idle subchannel is detected . otherwise @xmath69",
    "thus , @xmath79",
    "for the case s@xmath32n@xmath32b@xmath33 , because the spectrum is utilized based on the unit of bandwidth of one channel rather than one subchannel , we introduce the probability of the number of channels detected as idle , @xmath80 , to compute the probability of the number of subchannels detected as idle , @xmath59 . denoting @xmath81 as the probability that the number of channels detected as idle is @xmath80 given @xmath72 wpus and @xmath73 npus in the @xmath82 sensing stage , ( [ eq : p13 ] ) is modified as @xmath83 there are two required conditions for @xmath84 in ( [ eq : p13a ] ) .",
    "first , the sum of the channels detected as idle and the number of wpus can not be greater than the total number of channels , i.e. @xmath85 .",
    "second , the number of npus can not be greater than the total number of subchannels that are not occupied by the wpus , i.e. @xmath86 .",
    "we denote @xmath87 as an indicator of those conditions , defining @xmath88 for @xmath89 or @xmath86 and @xmath90 , otherwise .",
    "next , we compute @xmath84 under the feasible conditions considering different sensing stages . under the condition that no channel is detected as idle after the fine sensing , i.e. @xmath67 , the number of channels detected as idle is @xmath91 under the assumption of perfect pu detection . on the other hand ,",
    "when all channels are detected as idle in the coarse sensing , i.e. @xmath64 , only @xmath92 is possible .",
    "the analysis for the condition that the su performs fine sensing and detects idle channels , i.e. @xmath69 , is not easy to derive directly because the number of channels detected as idle depends on the position of npus in the spectrum as well as the number of npus .",
    "thus , defining the number of channels actually occupied by the npu as @xmath93 , we deconstruct @xmath84 for @xmath69 into two components : the conditional probability of @xmath93 for given number of pus and the sensing stage , denoted as @xmath94 , and the conditional probability of the number of channels detected as idle for a given @xmath93 , denoted as @xmath95 .",
    "then , @xmath96 where @xmath97 because @xmath93 is the smallest when all npus are located on adjacent subchannels , i.e. @xmath98 , and the largest when all npus are located in different channels separated as far as possible , i.e. @xmath99 .    to compute @xmath100 in ( [ eq : p20 ] ) , we assume that any npu can appear on any subchannel with equal probability , and that false alarm can occur uniformly over all idle subchannels .",
    "then , we introduce a supporting function @xmath101 denoting the number of possibilities that @xmath45 items are distributed over exactly @xmath102 bins each of which has a capacity of @xmath103 items .    to derive @xmath101 first we introduce the supporting variable , @xmath104  the number of items in @xmath53-th bin where @xmath105 .",
    "then , there can be @xmath106 possible distributions for the @xmath53-th bin , and thus for @xmath102 bins there can be @xmath107 possibilities . because there should be no bin empty , @xmath108 .",
    "also , each of the bins has a capacity of @xmath103 items and the total number of items can not be greater than @xmath45 , and therefore @xmath109 .",
    "in addition , if the number of bins is less than the number of items or equal to zero , there is no way to fill all @xmath102 bins .",
    "thus @xmath110 where @xmath111 .",
    "then @xmath100 can be computed by dividing the number of possible events that @xmath73 npus are located on exactly @xmath93 channels each of which can have at maximum @xmath112 npus , i.e. @xmath113 , by the number of all possible events that @xmath73 npus appear on @xmath114 channels , i.e. @xmath115 . note that if there is no npu , i.e. @xmath116 , then @xmath93 should be zero . considering the possible case of selecting @xmath93 npu channels from a total of @xmath114 channels ,",
    "i.e. @xmath117 , we derive @xmath100 as @xmath118    now we present the derivation of @xmath119 in ( [ eq : p20 ] ) .",
    "if there exist @xmath72 and @xmath93 channels that are occupied by wpus and npus , respectively , and @xmath80 channels are correctly detected as idle , the remaining @xmath120 channels must be falsely detected as busy . considering the number of events of selecting @xmath80 channels from @xmath121 idle channels , we derive @xmath119 as @xmath122",
    "because for s@xmath32n@xmath32b@xmath33 the spectrum is utilized based on the unit of bandwidth of one channel , denoting a supporting probability @xmath124 as the conditional probability of the number of channels , we derive @xmath125 as follows @xmath126 to reduce the complexity of calculating @xmath127 we use an approximation that if the number of pus is the same at times @xmath128 and @xmath129 , the positions of npus at times @xmath128 and @xmath129 are also the same .",
    "this approximation is valid when the pu activity is not high . with this approximation",
    "we ignore the case that a certain number of npus disappear while at the same time the same number of new npus appear , but at different locations .",
    "also we assume that if the number of wpus and npus have changed , the number of channels detected as idle is independent of the number of wpus and npus at time @xmath129 , which means that @xmath130 . considering these approximations",
    "we derive @xmath127 as @xmath131 where @xmath132 is defined in appendix  [ sec : p13s0n0b1 ] as ( [ eq : p20 ] ) .",
    "to modify @xmath133 in ( [ eq : p15 ] ) , under the approximation of the perfect detection , depending on the number of subchannels occupied by pus , i.e. @xmath134 , we consider three cases . in the first case , @xmath135",

    ", the false alarm probability of each sensing stage affects the probability @xmath133 . in the last case ,",
    "@xmath137 , the probability of @xmath64 is zero and the false alarm probability of the coarse sensing does not affect the performance .",
    "following the same convention as for the derivation of ( [ eq : p6 ] ) in section  [ sec : s0n1b1 ] , denoting @xmath139 as the joint probability of the number of pus and the sensing stage , we derive @xmath133 as @xmath140 because expression @xmath141 is the steady state probability , denoting the state transition probability as @xmath142 , @xmath141 can be obtained by solving the markov chain with a state @xmath143 , such that @xmath144 and @xmath145 , where @xmath146 is the set of all possible @xmath82 , @xmath147 , and @xmath148 , and @xmath149 is the set of the same variables at time @xmath129 . then @xmath150 is computed as @xmath151    to compute @xmath152 in ( [ eq : p12a ] ) and @xmath133 in ( [ eq : p15a ] ) , we need to derive @xmath153 . for the derivation of @xmath153 , to avoid prohibitive complexity of calculation , we consider two specific cases .",
    "the first case is that there is no change for the number of wpus and npus between time @xmath129 and @xmath128 .",
    "this case is expected to happen most frequently because the pu generally has longer inter - arrival time and packet length than the frame size of the sus .",
    "the second case is that the numbers of wpus and npus are reduced as time goes from @xmath129 to @xmath128 .",
    "if the pu activity is not too high , this case happens when some of the existing pus disappear and no new pu enters into the subchannels . then subchannels detected as idle at time @xmath129 still remains idle even at time @xmath128 , which can affect the sensing stage significantly . for the other cases",
    ", we use a general approach . depending on the changes of the numbers of the pus",
    ", @xmath153 is derived as @xmath154 where @xmath155 . to analyze the first case in ( [ eq : p25s ] ) , where there is no change in the number of wpus and npus between time @xmath129 and @xmath128",
    ", we reuse the assumption that there is no change in the positions at subchannels of the npus for the same number of npus at times @xmath128 and @xmath129 , see section  [ sec : s0n0b1 ] . with this approximation , under the condition",
    "that there exists at least one channel at time @xmath129 , i.e. @xmath156 , there should also exist at least one idle channel at time @xmath128 , i.e. @xmath157 .",
    "thus , if no false alarm occurs , only coarse sensing is performed , i.e. @xmath158 and otherwise @xmath159 .",
    "next , for the condition that no channel is detected as idle at time @xmath129 , i.e. @xmath160 , there can be a large number of possible events depending on the positions of npus and false alarms .",
    "thus , instead of considering all the possible events , we consider two cases and apply approximations for each one .",
    "the first case is that there exists a small number of npus at time @xmath129 so that the npus can not occupy all @xmath161 channels , i.e. @xmath162 , where @xmath163 is defined in appendix  [ sec : p13s0n0b1 ] as ( [ eq : fs ] ) . in this case , because there exists at least one idle channel , we approximate that the su performs fine sensing and detects the idle channel at time @xmath128 , i.e. @xmath159 .",
    "in contrast , for the second case where there exists enough npus such that they are spread over all @xmath161 channels , i.e. @xmath164 , we approximate that all channels are detected as busy at time @xmath128 , i.e. @xmath165 . considering all these sub - cases , we derive @xmath166 as @xmath167 where @xmath168 .",
    "next , we analyze the second case in ( [ eq : p25s ] ) , i.e. @xmath169 and @xmath170 , which implies that the number of pus decreases .",
    "similar to the first case in ( [ eq : p25s ] ) , if there exist idle channels at time @xmath129 , i.e. @xmath156 , there must also exist idle channels at time @xmath128 , i.e. @xmath157 . if a false alarm does not occur on any of the @xmath1 subchannels in a channel utilized for data transmission , the su performs only coarse sensing , i.e. @xmath158 , and otherwise , @xmath159 . on the other hand , for the condition",
    "that there is no idle channel at time @xmath129 , i.e. @xmath160 , the probability of the sensing stage at time @xmath128 is calculated by dividing the number of the cases that @xmath171 npus occupy exactly all @xmath172 channels , @xmath173 , by the number of all possible cases @xmath174 .",
    "note that when @xmath160 , it is not possible to perform only the coarse sensing at time @xmath128 , because the channel that is going to be utilized for data transmission is not determined .",
    "in other words , the probability of @xmath175 under @xmath160 equals zero . as a result",
    ", the probability of @xmath176 under @xmath160 equals to one minus the probability of @xmath160 under @xmath160 .",
    "thus , we derive @xmath177 as @xmath178    finally , we compute @xmath179 in ( [ eq : p25s ] ) . in this case , again to simplify the computation , we ignore the effect of the sensing stage at time @xmath129 and only focus on the sensing stage at time @xmath128 .",
    "then , we compute the probability that the su performs only coarse sensing , i.e. @xmath158 , by dividing the number of cases that at least one channel remains idle and no false alarm occurs on that channel , @xmath180 , by all possible cases of all channels remaining idle , @xmath174 . on the other hand , the probability that the su detects no idle channel , i.e. @xmath165 , is calculated by considering the case that @xmath73 npus occupy exactly all @xmath172 channels , i.e. @xmath181 .",
    "note that for the case that there appears too many npus on the spectrum so that there is no possibility that even one channel can not remain idle , only @xmath67 is feasible .",
    "this case can be denoted as @xmath182 , because @xmath172 channels are available for the npu and each channel can have a maximum @xmath112 npus .",
    "considering all these cases , we have @xmath183",
