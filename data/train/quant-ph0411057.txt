    "the description of the dynamics of open quantum systems has attracted increasing attention during the last few years @xcite .",
    "the major reason for this is the identification of the phenomena of decoherence and dissipation , which characterize the dynamics of open quantum systems interacting with their surroundings @xcite , as a main obstacle to the realization of quantum computers and other quantum devices @xcite .",
    "secondly , recent experiments on engineering of environments @xcite have paved the way to new proposals aimed at creating entanglement and superpositions of quantum states exploiting decoherence and dissipation @xcite .    a common approach to the dynamics of open quantum systems consists in deriving a master equation for the reduced density matrix which describes the temporal behavior of the open system .",
    "the solution for the master equation can then be searched by using analytical or simulation methods , or the combination of both .",
    "this article concentrates on the developing of new monte carlo simulation methods for non - markovian open quantum systems .",
    "the general feature of the monte carlo methods is the generation of an ensemble of stochastic realizations of the state vector trajectories . the density matrix and the properties of the system of interest",
    "are then consequently calculated as an appropriate average of the generated ensemble .",
    "some common variants of the monte carlo methods for open systems include the monte carlo wave - function ( mcwf ) method @xcite , the quantum state diffusion ( qsd ) @xcite , and the non - markovian wave function ( nmwf ) formulation unravelling the master equation in an extended hilbert space @xcite .",
    "the mcwf method has been very successfully used to model the laser cooling of atoms .",
    "actually , 3d laser cooling has so far been described only by mcwf simulations @xcite .",
    "qsd in turn has been found to have a close connection to the decoherent histories approach to quantum mechanics @xcite , and nmwf method has been recently applied to study the dynamics of quantum brownian particles @xcite . the various monte carlo methods and related topics have been reviewed e.g. in refs .",
    "@xcite    in general , simulating open quantum systems is a challenging task . it has been shown earlier that the methods mentioned above can solve a wide variety of problems .",
    "nevertheless , sometimes there arise situations in which the complexity of the studied system or the parameter region under study makes the requirement for the computer resources so large that the solution may become impossible in practice , though not in principle .",
    "thus , it is important to assess the already existing methods from this point of view , and develop new variants to improve their applicability .",
    "this is the key point of this article .    here",
    ", we address the monte carlo simulation methods for the short time - evolution of non - markovian systems which are weakly coupled to their environments . in this case",
    ", the dynamics of the system may exhibit rich features , whereas the weak coupling may lead to extremely small quantum jump probabilities , the consequence being unpractically large requirement for the size of the generated monte carlo ensemble . to overcome this problem",
    ", we present below a method which in general allows to reduce the ensemble size .    by studying the hilbert space path integral for the propagator of a piecewise deterministic process ( pdp ) @xcite",
    ", we show that part of the expectation value of an arbitrary operator @xmath0 as a function of time @xmath1 , @xmath2 , has scaling properties which can be exploited in monte carlo simulations to speed up the generation of the ensemble , in the optimal case by several orders of magnitude .",
    "we derive a scaling equation , from which the result for @xmath2 can be calculated , all the quantities in the equation being easily obtainable from the scaled monte carlo simulations .",
    "we concentrate first on the lindblad - type non - markovian case which can be solved by the standard mcwf method , and then focus on the non - lindblad - type case which requires the use of the nmwf simulations in the doubled hilbert space .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "section [ sec : dyn ] introduces the master equation , the corresponding stochastic schrdinger equation , and the appropriate simulation schemes for the lindblad- and non - lindblad - type systems .",
    "the hilbert space path integral method is then used to calculate the expectation value of an arbitrary operator setting the scene for the scaling method which is presented in sec .",

    "we begin by considering master equations obtained from the time - convolutionless projection operator technique ( tcl ) of the form @xcite @xmath3 with time - dependent linear operators @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 .",

    "if the total ( cumulative ) jump probability for the time evolution period of interest is @xmath63 , we need on average to generate @xmath64 realizations to produce one realization which has a jump . to achieve good statistical accuracy",
    "we need obviously a large enough number of jumps and the minimum condition for the required ensemble size @xmath26 becomes @xmath65 .",
    "this leads us to the following observation which can be used to optimize the ensemble size of the monte carlo simulations ( within the approximations we use ) .",
    "we can artificially increase the number of jumps by scaling up the transition rate @xmath62 by a factor of @xmath66 . at the same time we must leave the non - hermitian hamiltonian @xmath55 unscaled since the ensemble average contribution given by realizations with @xmath55 only ( no jumps ) appears on the l.h.s . of the equation ( [ eq : aini ] ) .",
    "in other words , we are not allowed to scale the deterministic evolution of the state vector ( which includes also the rotation of the state vector towards the state with the smallest decay rate @xmath67 ) but only increase the number of jumps by scaling up the transition rates by a factor of @xmath66 . in the simulation",
    "this can be done easily multiplying the jump probabilities for various decay channels by a same factor @xmath66 .",
    "an explicit example how to do this for both of the cases we are considering , lindblad- and non - lindblad - type , is shown in the next section .",
    "the question is now how we can calculate from the scaled simulations the result we are looking for , namely the expectation value for arbitrary operator @xmath0 as a function of time @xmath2 .",
    "it can be shown , see appendix [ app : b ] , that the final result for @xmath2 starting from eq .",
    "( [ eq : aini ] ) can be obtained as @xmath68 this equation is the main result of the paper .",
    "it shows that the ensemble average of the scaled simulations can be used to calculate the result for the original problem we are interested in . in this equation",
    ", @xmath69 is the total transition rate ( see appendix [ app : b ] ) , @xmath26 is the size of the ensemble , @xmath70 the number of jumps in the simulations as a function of time , @xmath66 the scaling factor , @xmath71 the expectation value with respect the deterministic time evolution ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : a0 ] ) ) , and @xmath72 the ensemble average from the modified simulations where the scaling has been used ( see the discussion above ) .",
    "all of the quantities on the r.h.s . can be easily calculated in the simulation .",
    "actually , from a technical point of view , the only difference between the scaled and unscaled simulations is that in the former one we have to keep track of the number of jumps as a function of time . a task which can be easily done in the simulations .",
    "we also note that at time @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 and we obtain correctly for time @xmath73 : @xmath77 .",
    "thus , we can optimize the ensemble size by using the following procedure in the monte carlo simulations : i ) scale up jump probabilities by suitable factor @xmath66 .",
    "ii ) leave decay rates @xmath10 untouched in the non - hermitian hamiltonian @xmath55 iii ) calculate the result for @xmath2 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : fina ] ) .",
    "it is worth to emphasize here a common feature of monte carlo wave - function simulations . the deterministic evolution caused by the non - hermitian hamiltonian @xmath55 changes the relative weights of the occupied states due to the different decay rates of the various states .",
    "the scaling procedure incorporates this rotation by adding to the scaled ensemble average result [ the second term on the r.h.s .",
    "( [ eq : fina ] ) ] contribution from the deterministic evolution calculated with the appropriate weight ( the first term ) .",
    "since the reduction in the required ensemble size is directly proportional to the used scaling factor @xmath66 , the issue is now how large scaling factor we can use to optimize the simulations .",
    "the scaling method that we have developed is valid when there is maximally one jump per realization .",
    "this condition has to hold also for the scaled simulations as well .",
    "as soon as the scaling factor is so large that realizations with two or more jumps begin to occur , additional error ( with respect to the normal statistical error of monte carlo simulations ) starts to appear .",
    "in other words , the probability of having two jumps per realization has to be much smaller than the one jump probability .",
    "if the total probability for one jump is @xmath63 ( see the discussion above ) , the probability for two jumps equals @xmath78 and the estimate for additional error is simply given by @xmath79 .",
    "thus we can use the scaling factor which increases the jump probabilities e.g. to the order of @xmath80 introducing a manageable @xmath81 error in addition to the normal statistical error of the monte carlo simulations .    for the standard monte carlo simulations there exists a corresponding measurement scheme interpretation based on the continuous monitoring of the environment of the system .",
    "the scaling technique modifies the monte carlo simulation method in such a way that the measurement scheme interpretation is lost .",
    "the scaled simulations correspond to a stochastic schrdinger equation where the deterministic part generated by @xmath82 , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : sse ] ) , remains the same but the jump part is scaled with @xmath66 , i.e. the expectation value of the poisson increment becomes @xmath83 = \\beta \\gamma_i(t)\\|l_i\\psi\\|^2dt.\\ ] ] thus the stochastic schrdinger equation does not have a corresponding master equation , and actually does not need to have one for the scaling to work .",
    "this is because we are not looking for two master equations whose results are scalable from each other .",
    "rather the key point is to modify in a suitable way the equations for the simulations in order to make them faster and more efficient .    summarizing ,",
    "we have demonstrated above how the scaling works for the lindblad - type master equation with time - dependent but always positive decay coefficients @xmath10 .",
    "for this the standard monte carlo wave - function method can be used @xcite . in a similar way",
    ", it can be shown that the scaling works also for the non - lindblad - type case where @xmath10 may acquire temporarily negative values . in this case",
    "one needs to use the doubled hilbert space unravelling @xcite .",
    "we show examples of the scaling for both of these cases in the next section .",
    "the discussion above shows how it is possible to reduce the size of the generated ensemble in the monte carlo simulations for non - markovian systems .",
    "it is worth noting that for the markovian case the scaling is not needed because the jump probabilities can be increased trivially by increasing e.g. the time step size @xmath21 in the simulations . for the non - markovian case",
    "this does not work because the main features of the open system dynamics may be given by the time dependence of the decay rates , and @xmath21 has to be kept small compared to the temporal variations of the decay coefficients .",
    "we show below two examples for the scaling . in these examples",
    "we use the scaling factors @xmath84 and @xmath85 while the generated ensembles have the sizes of the order of @xmath85 . in other words , without the scaling ,",

    "[ fig : eg2 ] , and consequently the requirement for the ensemble size is at least @xmath86 without the scaling .",
    "thus , the reduction in the ensemble size by the scaling method is again found to be at least on the order of @xmath143 .",
    "it is interesting to compare the various terms in the scaling equation ( [ eq : fina ] ) in the non - lindblad case .",

    "we have demonstrated a scaling method for monte carlo wave - function simulations which can reduce the size of the generated ensemble by several orders of magnitude especially for weakly coupled non - markovian systems .",

    "the initial state of the system was a fock state . here ,",
    "we present a generalized scaling scheme which is able to treat arbitrary initial states of the system and arbitrary hamiltonians .",

    "is mostly given as a sum of the terms displayed in ( a ) and ( d ) . ]    in general , non - markovian systems , even when they are weakly coupled to their environments , can posses rich dynamical features despite of the fact that the quantum jump probability per stochastic realization is small during the time evolution period of interest ( see the examples above ) .",
    "this is the key area where the scaling method we have presented is useful .",
    "the small jump probabilities due to the weak coupling can lead to the situations where the requirement for the size of the generated ensemble in the monte carlo wave function simulations is unconveniently large . in these cases ,",
    "the scaling method can be used to reduce and optimize the generated ensemble size for efficient numerical simulation of weakly coupled non - markovian systems .    the scaling method presented here",
    "can be used when the master equation of the open quantum system can be expressed in the general form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : genmaster ] ) obtained by the time - convolutionless projection operator techniques ( the one - jump restriction still applies , see below ) . to compare our method to the other simulation methods for non - markovian systems one should actually compare the validity of the tcl with respect to the methods presented e.g.  in refs .  @xcite .",
    "thus , making a rigorous comparison is an involved task and is left for future studies .",
    "we initially note here that our method is not restricted with respect to the temperature of the environment ( while method presented in ref .",
    "@xcite is valid for the zero - temperature bath ) and is valid , at least in principle , to the order used in the tcl expansion of master equation to be unravelled ( while method presented in ref .",
    "@xcite is post - markovian , i.e. first order correction to markovian dynamics ) .",
    "however , it is worth mentioning that the validity of the tcl expansion is crucially related to the existence of the tcl generator ( see e.g.  page @xmath151 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the scaling method is limited to the cases where there is maximally one jump per realization in the generated monte carlo ensemble .",
    "moreover , it is also important to note that the same restriction applies also for the scaled simulations .",
    "these limits can be easily checked by calculating the jump probabilities from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : jp ] ) and ( [ eq : fw ] ) for the time period of interest or by monitoring the number of jumps in the simulations .",
    "as soon as more than one jump per realization in the scaled simulations begin to occur , one can estimate the error by calculating the ratio between the two - jump and the one - jump probabilities per realization . in the examples we have described ,",
    "we have not used very aggressive optimization of the ensemble size ( though the ensemble size reduction is on the order of @xmath143 ) , and no error has been introduced .",
    "this has been confirmed by monitoring the jumps in the simulations : no two - jump realizations was generated .",
    "thus , the error bars displayed in the figs .",
    "( [ fig : eg1 ] ) and ( [ fig : eg2 ] ) correspond to the usual statistical error ( standard deviation ) of the monte carlo ensemble .    in conclusion",
    ", the scaling method has limitations ( one jump per realization ) but it is interesting to note that in the region where the method can not be applied ( more than one jump per realization ) , it is not needed .",
    "this is because in this region there already occurs large enough number of jumps enhancing the statistical accuracy of the simulations .",
