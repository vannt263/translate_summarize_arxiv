    "one of the main goals of nuclear physics is to understand to what extent a nucleus differs from a loosely bound system of quasi - independent nucleons .",
    "when nucleons are very close spatially , corresponding to rare high momentum components of the single particle wave function , many interesting and potentially exotic configurations can arise .",
    "one way to look for such configurations is with reactions that are significantly sub - threshold to production from a free nucleon . of all such reactions ,",
    "photoproduction of charmonium is one of the cleanest because the charm quark content of a nucleon is expected to be small compared to the light quarks . in light meson photoproduction , the quark content of the mesons can originate in the nuclear target , while in the case of charmonium photoproduction , the quark - interchange mechanism is essentially absent , and the reaction must proceed via gluon exchange in order for color to be conserved .",
    "in addition , the heavy mass of the charm quark ( about 1.5 gev ) ensures a hard scale to the problem , making it more tractable in qcd .      the goal of this experiment was to study the production mechanisms in the extreme conditions of matter that may be relevant in heavy ion collisions .",
    "these conditions are ensured by using a photon beam energy well below photoproduction threshold on a free nucleon . in the quasi - free picture where a photon interacts with a single off - shell nucleon in a nucleus",
    ", the nucleon three - momentum @xmath1 must be pointing anti - parallel to the photon direction ( @xmath2 ) for the invariant mass of the photon - nucleon system @xmath3 to be above the threshold value of @xmath4 gev@xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the nucleon mass and @xmath7 is the @xmath0  mass .",
    "an additional constraint is that the missing energy @xmath8 can not be too high . specifically , we calculated @xmath3 for a given photon energy @xmath9 using @xmath10 from eq .",
    "[ eq : s ] , it is clear that larger values of @xmath8 correspond so smaller values of @xmath3 , for fixed values of @xmath11 .",
    "the highest value of @xmath8 that is kinematically allowed is shown as a function of the magnitude of @xmath1 for photon energies of 4 , 5 , 6 , and 8 gev in fig .  [",
    "fig : pmem ] ( for the case of @xmath1 anti - parallel to the photon direction ) .",
    "since @xmath8 must be greater than zero , this leads to the conclusion that for @xmath0  photoproduction , the minimum nucleon momentum @xmath11 increases as the photon energy decreases .",
    "in particular the minimum momentum for 4 gev photons is 1.15 gev , for 6 gev photons it is 0.35 gev , and for 8 gev photons it is 0.05 gev . as discussed below , it is generally thought that the region where few - nucleon short - range correlations , hidden color configurations , and other short - range effects play a significant role for momenta larger than 0.35 gev  @xcite , corresponding to a photon energy of 6 gev .",
    "this was therefore chosen as the ideal energy for the present experiment . in practice",
    ", we used a slightly lower energy due to accelerator limitations at the time that the data were taken .    another way to realize the importance of short - range correlations comes from the observation that the photon threshold to produce @xmath0",
    "meson is 5.7 gev for a deuteron target at rest , and 4.8 gev for a triton or @xmath12he target .",
    "thus , two - nucleon and particularly three - nucleon correlations in the carbon nucleus are needed to kinematically permit @xmath0  photoproduction with photons with energies below 6 gev . in the language of light - front ( infinite momentum frame ) qcd , photon energies of 4 , 6 , and 8 gev correspond to minimal light - cone fractions @xmath13 ,  1.4 , and 1.0 respectively , where @xmath14 . in the limit of very large quark masses",

    "the kinematics of the present experiment ( represented by the open circles in fig .",
    "[ fig : pmem ] ) all lie in the range @xmath16 , corresponding to the region of multi - nucleon correlations  @xcite .",
    "the recoil effects in these kinematics essentially remove the contribution of two - nucleon short range correlations , as in this case the recoil energy is taken by one nucleon ( this is the kinematic domain which was studied in recent jlab experiments using the @xmath17 reaction  @xcite and inclusive scattering  @xcite at @xmath18 ) .",
    "the dominant contribution originates from the region where at least two nucleons balance the struck nucleon momentum , i.e. three or more nucleon correlations , which were studied so far only in @xmath19 measurements  @xcite .     as a function of the negative @xmath2 component of missing momentum @xmath11 , for 4 , 5 , 6 , and 8 gev photons , for the case of quasi - free photoproduction of @xmath0  mesons from a nucleon bound in a nucleus .",
    "the circles represent the relative distribution of events predicted for the present experiment for the specific model described in the text [ although no events were actually observed ] .",
    "the values of light cone fraction @xmath20 are indicated for each photon energy.,width=384 ]      the high @xmath1 momentum region is where few - nucleon short - range correlations are known to be important  @xcite , potentially leading to significantly enhanced yields compared to a simple quasi - free model . in the hard - scattering picture",
    "@xcite , this could correspond to strong contributions of twist 3-gluon exchange , compared to the minimal 2-gluon exchange needed to ensure the @xmath0  color singlet final state .",
    "the influence of intrinsic charm contributions , or hidden color contributions , could potentially increase the cross section by an order of magnitude above the expectations of a quasi - free model ( see fig .",
    "5 of ref .",
    "another possibility to enhance the sub - threshold cross section is a diagram in which two gluons are exchanged to two different nucleons .",
    "this type of process could become important in the sub - threshold region , because each of the gluons could have a much lower momentum fraction than if the pair of gluons came from a single nucleon .      in @xmath21 collisions",
    ", it has been observed that anti - protons and kaons are produced on nuclear targets at substantially lower energies than is kinematically possible on free nucleons  @xcite .",
    "scattering on a single nucleon in the nucleus would , at these energies , require a single - nucleon momentum in the vicinity of 800 mev .",
    "while the @xmath21 data can be fit assuming such high momenta are sufficiently likely , this assumption leads to an underestimate of sub - threshold production in @xmath22 collisions by about three orders of magnitude  @xcite .",
    "there are at least two qualitatively different scenarios for the observed sub - threshold production of anti - protons  @xcite .",
    "one scenario is that the projectile strikes a local  hot spot \" with a high energy density in the nucleus .",
    "the effective mass of the scatterer is high , lowering the kinematic threshold .",
    "alternatively , the momentum required to create the anti - proton is not transferred locally , but picked up in an extended longitudinal region .",
    "establishing either scenario would teach us something qualitatively new about rare , highly excited modes of the nucleus .",
    "sub - threshold photoproduction can help to identify the correct mechanism , because the @xmath23 component of the photon is almost point - like at the charm threshold and below .",
    "effects due to the shrinking effective size of a hadron probe near threshold are eliminated .",
    "the @xmath23 pair is created locally , within a proper time @xmath24 .",
    "the extended acceleration scenario is thus not effective for charm photoproduction .",
    "if significant sub - threshold charm photoproduction occurs ( beyond what can be ascribed to the quasi - free model ) this selects the hot spot scenario .",
    "to model quasi - free photoproduction from a heavy nucleus , we use a convolution integral similar to the model for the deuteron described in ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath25 where the integral over nucleon momentum @xmath1 and energy @xmath8 is limited to the kinematically allowed region , as described above , and the photon - nucleon center of mass energy squared @xmath3 and momentum transfered @xmath26 are functions of @xmath8 , @xmath1 , and photon energy @xmath9 .",
    "the elementary amplitude is far off shell ( @xmath27 for the interacting nucleon is @xmath28 ) , which may lead of a significant suppression of the cross section , not taken into account in the present analysis .",
    "the photon flux @xmath29 is given by @xmath30 , where @xmath31 in the present experiment is the sum of the target thickness in radiation lengths divided by two , and an effective quasi - real electroproduction factor  @xcite of 0.02 .",
    "the cross section @xmath32 is for @xmath0  photoproduction from a free nucleon , and we assume for simplicity that neutron and proton cross sections are equal . the flux term  @xcite @xmath33 averages to about 1.7 for the kinematics of this experiment ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : pmem ] ) .",
    "the function @xmath34 is a carbon spectral function  @xcite .",
    "the spectral function is defined as the probability of finding a nucleon of momentum @xmath35 and separation energy @xmath8 in the nucleus . in this picture , the only unknowns are the model for @xmath32 and the carbon spectral function at high @xmath1 and @xmath8 .",
    "there are no published data on sub - threshold photoproduction , but it is useful to review the existing data just above threshold on a free nucleon , as this provides the baseline for sub - threshold predictions . the existing data below 20 gev come from cornell @xcite using 9.3 to 11.8 gev photons , and from slac @xcite from 13 to 21 gev .",
    "these experiments detected lepton pairs from the @xmath0  decay to provide relatively background - free measurements .",
    "additional unpublished data from slac @xcite detected only a single lepton , leading to relatively large background subtractions .",
    "the experiments typically parameterize the data according to @xmath36 .",
    "what is remarkable is that , while @xmath37 has values of 3 to 5 gev@xmath38 at high energy , which are characteristic of diffractive processes , the values drop rapidly near threshold , with cornell @xcite quoting a value of only @xmath39 gev@xmath38 for an 11 gev photon energy .",
    "it was pointed out by ref .",
    "@xcite , the actual slope of the data seems to be more like 1.5 gev@xmath38 , still quite small .",
    "the cornell value is more than a factor of two below the slac value of @xmath40 gev@xmath38 at 19 gev .",
    "it is difficult to reconcile the two experiments with a smooth fit , assuming the exponential form corresponds to an effective form factor .",
    "one way to resolve this is to assume that @xmath41 scales as a dipole form factor squared of the form @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "a reasonably good fit to all data up to photon energies of 100 gev can be found with @xmath43 gev@xmath5 . since each experiment measured over a limited range of @xmath26 , and @xmath44 increases near threshold ,",
    "a natural explanation for the variation of @xmath37 with photon energy can be found .",
    "we found a reasonable dipole fit to the low energy data is given by @xmath45",

    "@xcite , @xmath48 is unity for at the threshold for photoproduction . in the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite , a different definition of @xmath47 is used which yields a maximum value of about 0.8 , so factors such as @xmath49 do not cause a large threshold suppression .    in summary",
    ", there is a very large uncertainty in how to extend fits to existing free - nucleon cross section measurements below 11 gev .",
    "this is discussed in more detail below in the context of cross section limits from the present experiment .",

    "the electron beam impinged on a narrow solid @xmath51c target with a thickness ( in the beam direction ) of 2.5 gm / cm@xmath5 , or 0.06 radiation length ( r.l . ) .",
    "the effective photon flux per electron was @xmath53 , where @xmath9 is the photon energy , obtained by considering that on average half of the real photons produced in the target are usable , plus an effective 2% from small - angle electroproduction .",
    "the experiment used the high momentum spectrometer ( hms ) in coincidence with the short orbit spectrometer ( sos ) to measure lepton pairs from @xmath0   decays ( 6% branching ratio for each of @xmath54 and @xmath55 ) .",
    "the magnets of the hms were configured to detect positive charged particles while the sos had negative polarity .",
    "the hms central momentum was set at 3.5 gev/@xmath56 and the central scattering angle at 24 degrees .",
    "the sos had a central momentum set near its maximum value of 1.7 gev/@xmath56 and the central angle set to 53 degrees .",
    "these settings were chosen to optimize the acceptance for forward - angle @xmath0  mesons decaying to lepton pairs , with the assumption that the angular distribution of the lepton pairs is given by @xmath57  @xcite , where @xmath58 is the center - of - mass ( c.m . )",

    "the optimization was done assuming the elementary cross section model had the form @xmath45 nb / gev@xmath5 and the spectral function of benhar  @xcite ( with one of the high @xmath11 extrapolations discussed below ) to generate a sample of quasi - free @xmath0  mesons .",
    "the choice of spectrometer polarities was made to minimize backgrounds and random coincidences .",
    "the cw nature of the electron beam was essential to reducing accidental coincidences to an acceptable level .",
    "electrons in the sos and positrons in the hms were identified by requiring a signal of several photoelectrons in threshold gas cherenkov counters , with the threshold momentum for pions or heavier particles to produce cherenkov light set above the maximum accepted particle momentum in the given spectrometer .",

    "separating muons from pions was more problematic . in the case of the hms spectrometer ,",
    "the pion threshold in the gas cherenkov counter was set just below the maximum accepted momentum ( i.e. , about 8% above the central momentum ) .",
    "the threshold for muons was 25% lower than for pions , and therefore 17% below the central momentum of the spectrometer ( which has a nominal momentum acceptance of @xmath59 ) . with approximately 10 photo - electrons ( pe ) for fully relativistic particles ( such as electrons )",
    ", the muons produced on average 2 pe to 4 pe over the spectrometer acceptance . with a threshold of 1 pe",
    ", the efficiency was varied from 85% to 98% , depending on muon momentum .",
    "the original cherenkov counter in the sos was designed to be sub - atmospheric , hence could not achieve the correct index of refraction to trigger on muons .",
    "it was therefore replaced with the slac 1.6 gev spectrometer cherenkov counter modified for the scattered particle envelope in the sos .",
    "this detector was filled with c@xmath60f@xmath61 and was pressurized to trigger on muons , but not on pions .",
    "additional muon identification was provided by requiring minimum ionizing pulse heights in each of the four layers of the lead glass shower counters .",
