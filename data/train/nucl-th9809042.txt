    "this range of values agrees well with the theoretical prediction by the same authors @xcite for @xmath1 in nuclear matter , using model d of the nijmegen group @xcite to describe baryon - baryon interactions in an su(3 ) picture , in contrast with the @xmath1-nucleus repulsion obtained @xcite using model f @xcite .",
    "similar predictions were subsequently made with more detailed @xmath12 matrix evaluations by yamamoto _",
    "@xcite who argued for a considerable @xmath13 dependence of @xmath14 , such that the well depth for light and medium weight nuclei is significantly lower than for heavy nuclei where it approaches the value calculated for nuclear matter",
    ". it should be noted , however , that the predictions of the nijmegen model d for @xmath14 are extremely sensitive to the value assumed for the hard - core radius .",
    "nevertheless , the confidence in the predictive power of model d for this sector of strangeness @xmath152 hypernuclear physics , at least qualitatively , is to a large extent due to its success in yielding the attractive @xmath16 interaction necessary to reproduce the ( so far ) three known @xmath16 binding energies ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review of these calculations ) .",
    "if the interaction of @xmath1 hyperons with nuclei is sufficiently attractive to cause binding , as has been repeatedly argued since the original work of dover and gal @xcite , then a rich source of spectroscopic information becomes available and the properties of the in - medium @xmath17 interaction can be extracted .",
    "bound states of @xmath1 hypernuclei would also be useful as a gateway to form double @xmath18 hypernuclei @xcite .",
    "finally , a minimum strength for @xmath14 of about 15 mev is required to realize the exciting possibility of strange hadronic matter @xcite ; where protons , neutrons , @xmath18s and @xmath1s are held together to form a system which is stable against strong - interaction decay .",
    "some new information on the @xmath19 nucleus interaction has been recently reported from ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) counter experiments at the kek proton synchrotron .",
    "@xcite have shown fits to the very low energy part ( including the bound state region ) of the @xmath19 hypernuclear spectrum in the @xmath22c@xmath23 reaction on a scintillating fiber active target ( experiment e224 ) , resulting in an estimate of @xmath14 between 15 to 20 mev",
    ". the experimental energy resolution of about 10 mev in this experiment was too poor to allow identification of any bound state peak structure which could have given more definitive information on the well depth .",
    "a somewhat cleaner and better resolved spectrum has been recently shown @xcite from the brookhaven ags experiment e885 , but no analysis of these data has yet been reported .",
    "an earlier kek experiment ( e176 ) gave evidence for three events of stopped @xmath19 in light emulsion nuclei , each showing a decay into a pair of single @xmath18 hypernuclei .",
    "the first two events @xcite are consistent energetically with a @xmath19 _ atomic _ state in @xmath22c bound by @xmath24 .",
    "however , this value could only be ascribed to capture from the @xmath25 state which is estimated to occur in less than 1% of the total number of captures .",

    "it is seen that the sensitivity of the binding energies and strong interaction widths to the @xmath1-nucleus strong interaction is , for these examples , of the order of 100 ev , substantially smaller than a typical error of 100 kev incurred in emulsion work .",
    "we point out that there exist alternative interpretations of these two events as captures on @xmath34n , with binding energies consistent with the calculated value listed in the table , for example @xcite , @xmath35 .",
    "furthermore , a likely interpretation of the third event @xcite is due to capture on @xmath36o , with @xmath37 . clearly , whereas these emulsion events are consistent with capture from @xmath28 _ atomic _ states , they are useless as a source of information regarding the @xmath1-nucleus interaction .",
    "one clearly needs an alternative source of information on the @xmath1-nucleus strong interaction .",
    "such an alternative source is the measurement of x - ray energies from transitions between low lying levels of @xmath0 hadronic atoms .",

    ", we follow the example of @xmath38 atoms which , as was recently shown @xcite , gives rise to meaningful information about the @xmath39 nucleus interaction , particularly in the absence of any systematic evidence for bound @xmath39 hypernuclei .",

    "section [ sec : sum ] summarizes the present work .",
    "in considering the feasibility of measuring strong interaction effects in @xmath0 atoms , we are guided by the successful observation and measurement of strong interaction effects @xcite in @xmath38 atoms .",
    "the @xmath0 and the @xmath38 hyperons have very similar masses and lifetimes , namely 1321.32 and 1197.34 mev for @xmath0 and @xmath38 respectively , and 0.1642 and 0.1482 nsec for @xmath0 and @xmath38 respectively .",
    "consequently , major differences between the experimental x - ray counting rates should result mostly from differences between the production mechanism of the two kinds of hadronic atoms . in the @xmath38 case",
    "the production mechanism is the @xmath46 reaction at rest .",
    "the outgoing @xmath38 has a kinetic energy of 12.4 mev which means that it stops in a heavy target such as pb or w in less than 10@xmath47 sec and the outgoing pion has a kinetic energy of 83.2 mev which makes it quite easy to detect . for the @xmath0 particle",
    "the situation is less favourable .",
    "the production mechanism is the @xmath48 reaction which has a total cross section larger than 100 @xmath49b only in the kinetic energy range for @xmath20 of 1.0 to 1.8 gev ( see results summarized in ref .",
    "consequently the majority of the produced @xmath0 will be in the energy range of 100 to 300 mev , leading to stopping times in heavy targets of 0.01 to 0.3 nsec respectively .",
    "it is therefore essential that the @xmath0 particles slow down in a heavy degrader and not in the liquid hydrogen used for the production where the stopping times are much longer .",
    "a laminar target structure similar to that used in @xmath38 experiments @xcite seems the most suitable . without detailed calculations for specific target and degrader configurations",
    "it is only possible to estimate that up to 50% of the produced @xmath0 may survive the slowing down process .",
    "detection in coincidence with the outgoing @xmath21 is a must in such an experiment",
    ". the energy of this @xmath21 will be about 500 mev .",
    "when interested in the measurement of strong interaction effects in hadronic atoms it is also necessary to consider losses during the atomic cascade process . here ,",
    "again , it is possible to make use of the fact that @xmath38 atoms have been successfully observed , and that the @xmath0 and the @xmath38 hyperons have very similar masses and lifetimes .",
    "we have performed calculations of the atomic cascade for @xmath38 atoms of pb , in order to compare the predicted absolute x - ray yields with experiment @xcite .    the cascade program used here",
    "was based on that originally written by hfner @xcite for muonic atoms and later modified to include strong interaction effects .",
    "the hadronic atom is assumed to be formed in a state of large radial quantum number @xmath50 . to accommodate departures from a purely statistical distribution",
    "the initial population used is of the form    @xmath51    where for @xmath52 the statistical distribution is obtained .",
    "the atom initially de - excites by auger transitions and later by radiative transitions with the emission of x - rays . finally in a state of low angular momentum @xmath53 the hadron",
    "is absorbed by the nucleus and the x - ray cascade terminates .",
    "the probabilities for auger and radiative transitions are calculated with the usual electromagnetic expressions @xcite . for the strong interaction the input to the calculations",
    "are the measured or calculated absorption widths of low @xmath50 circular @xmath54 atomic states which are then scaled @xcite to obtain widths for non - circular states of a given @xmath53 and increasing @xmath50 .",
    "the probability that the hadron may decay during the atomic cascade is also included in the calculation .    for the strong interaction widths we used values predicted by the density dependent @xmath39 nucleus potential which reproduces all the available data @xcite . from a fit to the measured relative x - ray yields @xcite we obtain the value @xmath55 which corresponds to a small departure from a purely statistical distribution .",
    "the predicted absolute yields for the three transitions of interest are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigpby ] where it is seen that their variation with @xmath56 over its fitted range of uncertainty is not very large .",
    "note that the @xmath57 and @xmath58 transitions in @xmath38 pb have been observed @xcite .",
    "next we calculated the yields for @xmath0 atoms of pb for a range of values of @xmath56 .",
    "strong interaction widths of the relevant levels were calculated with a @xmath29 potential with @xmath30 fm as discussed below .",
    "figure [ fig : xipby ] shows the calculated absolute yields , which turn out to be very similar to the corresponding values for the @xmath38 pb atom . in both cases",
    "the @xmath59 transition is also shown because its energy is very close to that of the @xmath60 transition and the two will have to be separated .",
    "it is therefore concluded that @xmath0 atoms could be observed if the production yield and detection efficiency are not too small compared to the corresponding values for @xmath38 atoms .",
    "when selecting targets for possible experiments on @xmath0 atoms , it must be assumed that such experiments will probably not be feasible on more than very few targets , and one must therefore ask whether it is at all likely that useful information on the interaction of @xmath0 with nuclei will be obtained from the resulting rather limited range of data .",
    "useful hadronic - atom data normally consist of the strong - interaction shift and width for the ` last ' level observed plus , occasionally , the relative yield for the ` upper ' level , as discussed below . it has been shown very recently @xcite that the main features of the interaction of @xmath20 and @xmath38 with nuclei , as found from analyses of all the available data , may in fact , be obtained by analyzing a small fraction of the available hadronic atom data , if the target nuclei are carefully selected .",
    "a key point here is to have target nuclei over as wide a range of the periodic table as possible .",
    "this observation suggests that experiments on @xmath0 atoms may provide useful information .    in order to have some idea of the expected strong interaction effects in @xmath0 atoms and on the expected yields of x - ray transitions ,",
    "it is necessary to adopt some form of an optical potential which will describe , at least approximately , the interaction of the @xmath0 hyperon with nuclei and its dependence on the nuclear mass .",
    "the so - called @xmath29 potential @xcite in its simplest form is given by    @xmath61    where @xmath49 is the @xmath1-nucleus reduced mass , @xmath62 is the mass of the nucleon and @xmath63 is the nuclear density , normalized to the mass number @xmath13 .",
    "the parameter @xmath33 is a complex parameter , and is usually related to the hadron - nucleon scattering length @xcite .",
    "more refined potentials have been used with other hadronic atoms and will be discussed in the following section . for the present purpose",
    "we select the value of re@xmath64 fm which yields a potential depth of about 20 mev inside nuclei , and im@xmath65 fm , yielding for the imaginary potential a depth of about 3 mev . whereas the real potential may be regarded as ` typical ' , according to the discussion in sec .",
    "[ sec : int ] , the imaginary potential is about twice as large as estimated @xcite in model d. reducing the imaginary potential will only cause the calculated widths of the states to decrease by roughly the same proportion , and the relative yields ( see below ) of transitions to become larger .",
    "this will not , however , change the last observed atomic level .",
    "a further comment on the choice of the imaginary potential is made in sec .",
    "[ sec : dd ] .",
    "in choosing criteria for the suitability of a transition as a source of information on the @xmath1 nucleus interaction , we are guided by experience with other hadronic atoms @xcite and select x - ray transitions @xmath66 between circular atomic states @xmath67 with energies greater than 100 kev , where the strong interaction shift for the ` last ' @xmath68 level is at least 0.5 kev and the width less than about 10 kev .",
    "the ` upper ' level relative yield , defined as the ratio of the intensity of the @xmath66 x - ray transition to the summed intensity of all x - ray transitions feeding the @xmath69 state , is also required to be at least 10% .",
    "the ` upper ' level relative yield @xcite is given by the ratio of the radiative width for the @xmath66 transition to the total width of the @xmath69 level feeding the @xmath68 level .",
    "a measurement of the relative yield enables the strong interaction width of the ` upper ' @xmath69 level to be determined , in addition to deducing the strong - interaction level shift and width for the ` last ' @xmath68 level from the x - ray transition energy discussed above .",
    "altogether , these are the strong - interaction data provided by measuring atomic x - ray spectra .      strong interaction shifts and widths of @xmath0 atomic levels",
    "have been calculated using the above optical potential for a large number of nuclei .",
    "as the overlap of atomic wavefunctions with nuclei vary smoothly with charge number , it is to be expected that generally shifts , widths and yields will vary smoothly along the periodic table .",
    "figure [ fig : xipb ] shows calculated widths and ` upper ' level relative yields for the @xmath70 level in @xmath0 atoms for several heavy targets . calculated",
    "shifts ( not shown ) for the chosen potential are generally equal to or up to 30% larger than the widths , as long as both are smaller than 10 kev .",
    "it is seen from the figure that pb is a suitable target for the experiment .",
    "figure [ fig : xisn ] shows similar results for the @xmath71 state in medium - heavy @xmath0 atoms and it is seen that a suitable target may be found near sn or i. the dashed lines in this figure are obtained by reversing the sign of the real potential used for calculating the solid curves .",
    "it is seen that in such a case the range of suitable targets will move to between i and ba , where the strong interaction width and relative yield are more acceptable .",
    "the sign of the strong interaction shift will be reversed in this case , but it has no experimental consequences .",
    "this exemplifies a general property of hadronic atoms , which are dominated by the coulomb interaction , namely , that large variations in the strong interaction potential will move the proposed targets only a few units of charge along the periodic table .",
    "figure [ fig : xisi ] shows results for the @xmath72 state of @xmath0 atoms , where it is seen that for a si target the effects could be too small to measure whereas for ca the width could be too large and the relative yield too small . in this region a cl target may be appropriate , perhaps in the form of the liquid ccl@xmath73 .",
    "more detailed results for cl are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : xiclall ] where the sensitivities to assumptions regarding the optical potential are also typical of results for other targets .",
    "the solid curves connect points obtained within the @xmath29 potential eq .",
    "( [ eq : trho ] ) for fixed values of re@xmath33 , listed above the lines .",
    "the four points along each line correspond to values of im@xmath33 from 0.05 fm down to 0.02 fm in steps of 0.01 fm .",
    "departures from this @xmath29 potential are represented by the dotted lines , calculated from phenomenological density dependent ( dd ) real potentials similar to those found from analyses of experimental results for @xmath38 and @xmath20 atoms @xcite .",
    "the imaginary part of the potential is of the @xmath29 type and the points along the dotted lines correspond to the same values of im@xmath33 as above .",
    "the real potentials in these calculations are similar to the real potential for @xmath38 atoms @xcite , having an attractive pocket about 5 - 10 mev deep outside the nuclear surface , with a repulsive potential of about 20 - 30 mev in the nuclear interior .",
    "the results in the figure serve only to illustrate the expected range of strong interaction effects .",
    "if the actual values of shift and width turn out to be within the area covered by the lines , these effects will most likely be measurable .",
    "figure [ fig : xif ] shows calculated results for @xmath28 states in several @xmath0 atoms , and it is seen that f may be a suitable target , possibly in the form of teflon ( cf@xmath74 ) . to see what could be the effects of the carbon in the target we have also performed full atomic cascade calculations for c and f , and the expected x - ray spectrum for teflon is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : xicf2 ] .",
    "it seems that the presence of carbon in the target should not affect the possibility of observing transitions in @xmath0 f atoms .",
    "results for the @xmath29 potential with @xmath30 fm are summarized in table [ tab : preds ] , which includes several suitable targets across the periodic table where strong interaction effects are likely to be measurable .",
    "a range of targets is necessary if unusual features of the interaction , such as density dependence beyond the @xmath29 prescription , are to be unraveled by the experiment .",

    "[ fig : xisn ] and [ fig : xiclall ] .",
    "conversely , one may explore the extent to which measuring , say , four x - ray spectra ( e.g. table [ tab : preds ] ) will determine the @xmath1-nucleus potential . in the present section we address this question by choosing a one - boson - exchange ( obe ) motivated @xmath1-nucleus potential , use it to evaluate the strong - interaction shifts and widths for several targets across the periodic table , and then solve the inverse problem , namely determine the best - fit parameters for @xmath1 nucleus potentials of different forms .",

    "the main contribution to this difference does not arise just from folding the finite - size @xmath81 into @xmath79 , but is due to the summed effect of the dd terms ` @xmath83 ' which produce repulsion on top of the attractive contribution due to the sum of the ` @xmath82 ' terms . retaining the ` @xmath90 ' terms in eq .",

    "as the interactions take place at high @xmath50 , the lifetime of the @xmath7 atom is reduced by the stark mixing and the probability for the @xmath0 to decay during the atomic cascade decreases .",
    "some of the early qualitative discussions of stark mixing @xcite for @xmath106 atoms were placed on a more quantitative basis by leon and bethe @xcite .",
    "their calculations were later modified and extended by borie and leon @xcite to a range of exotic - hydrogen atoms such as @xmath107 and @xmath108 . of interest for the present work ,",
    "calculations using the borie and leon model have been used to fit measured x - ray yields for k- and l - series x - rays from antiprotonic hydrogen ( @xmath108 ) atoms @xcite . in using this model",
    "it has generally been found that , because of approximations in the calculation of the absolute value of the stark mixing rate , an overall normalisation factor @xmath109 is required to get a good fit to the experimental x - ray data .",
    "typical values of @xmath109 required to fit data for @xmath108 atoms are in the range 1.0 to 2.0 . in the present work calculations are made for @xmath109 over the range 0.5 to 5.0 .",
    "the present calculations were carried out using the borie and leon model @xcite with the program used in @xcite for calculations on antiprotonic hydrogen atoms , modified for @xmath7 atoms and including decays of the @xmath0 .",
    "the principal input values are the stark mixing normalization factor @xmath109 and the strong interaction widths @xmath110 and @xmath111 for the @xmath25 and @xmath112 levels respectively .",
    "the strong interaction width of the @xmath28 and higher @xmath113-states were all set to zero .",
    "the kinetic energy of the @xmath7 atom was taken to be 1  ev @xcite .",
    "the total strong interaction widths calculated by aerts and dover @xcite lie in the range @xmath110 = 1 to 50  kev for @xmath8 states and @xmath111 = 0.2 to 0.8  ev for @xmath9 states . in fig .",
    "[ fig : xid10 ] the fraction of @xmath8 and @xmath9 state reactions as a function of the stark mixing parameter @xmath109 is shown for three sets of strong interaction parameters , @xmath110 = 10  kev , @xmath111 = 0.2  ev ( labelled 1 ) , @xmath110 = 10  kev , @xmath111 = 0.8  ev ( labelled 2 ) and @xmath110 = 1  kev , @xmath111 = 0.2  ev ( labelled 3 ) .",
    "the fraction of @xmath7 atoms which decay is also plotted for case 1 ; cases 2 and 3 give almost indistinguishable values .",
    "the results are seen to exhibit only small sensitivity to the choice of strong interaction parameters , but considerable sensitivity to the value of @xmath109 .",
    "as the amount of stark mixing increases , the fraction of @xmath8 state capture increases , @xmath9 state capture decreases and the number of @xmath0 decays from the @xmath7 atom is reduced as expected .",
    "a particular feature of the borie and leon model is that it seems to over - estimate the amount of @xmath9 state capture .",
    "this problem has been discussed by batty @xcite for @xmath108 atoms .",
    "he finds that the introduction of an additional normalization factor @xmath114 , used for stark transitions between @xmath8 and @xmath9 states only , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath115 and @xmath116 transitions , gives significantly improved fits to the x - ray yield data with @xmath114 = 7.6 and much reduced values for the fraction of @xmath9 state annihilation in liquid hydrogen .",
    "here we use the same model and again fix @xmath114 = 7.6 .",
    "there is no particular reason for this choice of value for @xmath114 except that it gives a good fit to the @xmath108 atom results .",
    "the resulting values for the fraction of @xmath8 and @xmath9 state capture and of @xmath0 decays are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : xid76 ] for the same values of the strong interaction parameters as used in fig .",

    "however the fraction of @xmath0 decays largely stays unaltered .",
    "using @xmath8 and @xmath9 state capture fractions obtained in this way , with values for @xmath110 and @xmath111 given in table ii of ref .",
    "@xcite , the probability for the production of the @xmath6 particle from @xmath7 atoms can be calculated @xcite .",
    "aerts and dover @xcite also give in fig . 4 of their paper , values , as a function of the mass of the @xmath6 particle @xmath117 , for the branching ratios @xmath118 and @xmath119 defined by ,    @xmath120    and    @xmath121    weighting the fractions of @xmath8 and @xmath9 state capture by the corresponding @xmath118 and @xmath119 ( values for model d in ref .",

    "the results of @xcite show that @xmath6 particle production is more likely to proceed from @xmath8 states rather than @xmath9 states by a factor varying from 1.4 at @xmath117 = 2.23  gev ( @xmath122 = 0  mev ) to 14 at @xmath117 = 2.18  gev ( @xmath122 = 50  mev ) . as a result",
    "the probability of @xmath6 particle production increases with stark mixing ( increasing @xmath109 or @xmath114 ) as can be clearly seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : hprod ] .    on the other hand the branching fractions @xmath118 and @xmath119 both decrease as the binding energy @xmath122 increases .",
    "however the fraction of @xmath8 state capture increases somewhat from 0.46 to 0.57 and the @xmath9 state fraction decreases from 0.38 to 0.27 as @xmath122 increases from 0 to 50  mev .",
    "these changes are largely due to the reduction in the @xmath112 state strong interaction width @xmath111 from 0.61 to 0.25  ev as @xmath122 increases ; the above capture fractions were calculated for @xmath109 = 1.0 and @xmath114 = 7.6 . as a result , due to the increase in @xmath8 state capture , the decrease in @xmath6 particle production with increasing",
    "@xmath122 is less rapid than might be deduced solely from the overall reduction in the branching fractions for @xmath6 particle production from the @xmath7 atom .",
    "almost no quantitative information on the interaction of @xmath0 hyperons with nuclei is available at present and it is unlikely that conventional measurements of particle energies to investigate @xmath0 hypernuclei will have sufficient accuracy to alter this situation . in contrast , the usual precision for measuring the energies of x - rays from transitions between levels of hadronic atoms offers the possibility of obtaining quantitative information on the interaction of @xmath0 hyperons with nuclei . in the present work we have been guided by the successful observation and reasonably precise measurement of strong interaction effects in @xmath38 atoms , which has led to our best knowledge , so far , of the interaction of @xmath38 hyperons with nuclei .",
    "full atomic cascade calculations have been performed for @xmath38 and @xmath0 atoms and confirmed , as expected , that the processes within these two hadronic atoms are very similar .",
    "the remaining major differences are in the production reactions . whereas @xmath38 hyperons are produced by the @xmath124 reaction at rest , the @xmath125 reaction occurs at higher energies , thus causing decay losses during the slowing down time of the @xmath0 particle to be non - negligible .",
    "prior to such an experiment it will be necessary to optimize the experimental setup , which includes a hydrogen production target , a heavy moderator such as pb or w , the target to be studied and the detectors , both for x - rays and for the detection of the outgoing @xmath21 , which is essential in order to reduce background .    in the present work we have confined ourselves to studying the dependence of strong interaction shifts and widths in @xmath0 atoms on the various parameters of the problem , including the nuclear charge .",
    "adopting an optical potential for the strong interaction between the @xmath0 and the nucleus and assuming it to be attractive and 15 - 20 mev deep with an imaginary part of 1 - 3 mev , we are able to propose four targets along the periodic table , namely , f , cl , i and pb as suitable for x - ray measurements .",
    "this also proves to be a sensible choice of targets for moderate changes in @xmath4",
    ". nevertheless , even if the actual potential turns out to be very different from the one used in the present calculations , for example using potential g of sec . [",
    "sec : dd ] , only relatively small changes will result , because the whole phenomenon of hadronic atoms is dominated by the coulomb interaction . starting from a @xmath12-matrix based @xmath17 interaction ,",
    "we constructed a version of @xmath88 ( potential g ) which would indeed lead to a slightly different choice of optimal targets .",
    "it was shown that the qualitative features of such a potential can be deduced by an inversion procedure , where one fits a phenomenological dd potential to the strong interaction data deduced from @xmath0 atom experiments .",
    "although we do not consider potential g as a realistic one , this example served to demonstrate the feasibility of the inversion procedure .",
    "finally , the special case of @xmath7 atoms has been discussed in great detail , in view of its role in current experiments aimed at the @xmath6 dibaryon .",
