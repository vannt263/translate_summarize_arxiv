    "for instance , the white product of two quadratic algebras is equal to their degreewise tensor product @xmath14 .",
    "therefore , one can apply the method of j. backelin @xcite to prove that the white product of two koszul algebras is again a koszul algebra .",
    "+ koszul duality theory is a homological algebra theory developed by s. priddy @xcite in 1970 for quadratic algebras . to a quadratic algebra @xmath1 generated by a finite dimensional vector space @xmath3 , one can associate the _ koszul dual algebra _ @xmath15 . under this finite dimensional hypothesis",
    ", we have @xmath16 , that is black and white constructions are dual to each other under koszul duality functor .",
    "the main result of manin is the following adjunction in the category of finitely generated quadratic algebras @xmath17 using the general properties of internal cohomomorphisms , manin proved that @xmath18 is a hopf algebra and was able to realize well known quantum groups as black products of an algebra with its koszul dual . for more properties of manin s products for quadratic algebras , we refer the reader to the book of a. polishchuk and l. positselski @xcite .",
    "+ koszul duality theory was later generalized to binary quadratic operads by v. ginzburg and m. kapranov @xcite in 1994 .",
    "this generalization comes from the fact that an operad , like an associative algebra , is a monoid in a monoidal category .",
    "a quadratic operad @xmath19 is a quotient of a free operad by an ideal generated by a sub-@xmath20-module @xmath21 of @xmath22 , the part of weight @xmath23 of @xmath24 .",

    "@xmath32    when the operad @xmath19 is a binary quadratic operad generated by a finite dimensional @xmath20-module @xmath3 , they defined a _ koszul dual operad _ by the formula @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the dual representation twisted by the signature representation . as in the case of algebras , they proved that @xmath35 and they showed the adjunction @xmath36 in the category of finitely generated binary quadratic operads .",
    "+ from the properties of black and white products for associative algebras and binary quadratic operads , a few natural questions arise . where do the functors @xmath37 and",
    "@xmath38 conceptually come from ?",
    "is the black or white product of two binary koszul operads still a koszul operad ?",
    "can one do non - commutative geometry with an operad of the form @xmath39 ?",
    "one can also add : is it possible to recover classical operads as black or white products of more simple operads ? can black and white products help to describe the natural operations acting on cohomological spaces ?",
    "the aim of this paper is to answer these questions .",
    "+ let us recall that koszul duality theory of associative algebras and binary quadratic operads was extended to various other monoidal categories in the last few years .",

    "gan in @xcite , it was proved by p. van der laan in @xcite for colored operads and by the author for properads in @xcite .",
    "properad _ is an object slightly smaller than a prop which encodes faithfully a large variety of algebraic structures like bialgebras or lie bialgebras , for instance ( see appendix a for more details ) .",
    "we would like to emphasize that the koszul dual that appears naturally , without finite dimensional assumptions , is a comonoid ( coalgebra , cooperad , coproperad , etc ... ) .",
    "see section  [ koszul duality pattern ] for more details .",
    "+ to answer the first question about the conceptual definition of the functors @xmath37 and @xmath38 , we introduce a new notion of category endowed with @xmath23 coherent monoidal products .",
    "we call it _ @xmath23-monoidal category _ in section  [ 2-monoidal category ] .",
    "this definition generalizes previous notions given by a. joyal and r. street in @xcite in the framework of braided tensor categories and by c. balteanu , z. fiedorowicz , r. schwnzl and r. vogt in @xcite in the framework of iterated monoidal category and iterated loop spaces .",
    "all the examples given above are monoids in a @xmath23-monoidal category . in a @xmath23-monoidal category , we define the functors @xmath37 and @xmath38 by universal properties .",
    "this allows us to define white products for monoids presented by generators and relations in section  [ maninproducts ] .",
    "since the koszul dual is a comonoid , we define a black product for comonoids presented by generators and relations .",
    "( this notion is introduced and detailed in appendix  [ categorical algebra ] ) .",
    "+ the white product defined here coincides with the one of yu .",
    "i. manin for quadratic algebras @xmath41 , with the one of ginzburg - kapranov for binary quadratic operads @xmath42 and with the one of r. berger , m. dubois - violette and m. wambst @xcite for @xmath43-homogenous algebras .",
    "note that the white product is defined without homogenous assumption .",
    "therefore , one could apply them to non - homogenous cases . in this sense",
    ", it would be interesting to study the properties of the white products of artin - schelter algebras @xcite .",
    "+ under finite dimensional assumptions , the twisted linear dual of the koszul dual cooperad gives the koszul dual operad defined by @xcite . using this relation , we define a black product for operads in section  [ manin products for operads ] .",
    "we do several computations of black and white products and show that some classical operads can be realized as products of simpler operads .",
    "all these examples are products of koszul operads and the result is again a koszul operad .",
    "this fact is not true in general and we provide a counterexample in section  [ counterexample ] .",
    "whereas this property holds for associative algebras , it is not true here because the functors @xmath38 and @xmath37 are not isomorphisms . + we extend the adjunction of manin and ginzburg - kapranov and prove that @xmath39 is a hopf operad . since operads are non - linear generalizations of associative algebras , the notion of hopf operad can be seen as a non - linear generalization of bialgebras .",
    "hopf operads of the form @xmath39 can provide new examples of `` quantum groups '' , in the philosophy of @xcite .",
    "this adjunction also allows us to understand the algebraic structures on tensor products or spaces of morphisms of algebras .",
    "for instance , it gives a description of the structure of cohomology spaces .",
    "+ non - symmetric operads are operads without the action of the symmetric group .",
    "one can symmetrize a non - symmetric operad to get an operad .",
    "( it corresponds to the functor @xmath44 in the diagram above ) .",
    "the image of a non - symmetric operad under functor is called a _ regular _ operad .",
    "we define black @xmath45 and white @xmath46 square products for regular operads as the image of black and white products of non - symmetric operads in section  [ bw square ] . in the case of binary quadratic regular operads ,",
    "the black square product given here corresponds to the one introduced by k. ebrahimi - fard and l. guo in @xcite ( see also j .- l .",
    "loday @xcite ) .",
    "we prove the same kind of results for regular operads and square products than the ones for operads and manin s products .",
    "+ the adjunction for black and white square products allows us to construct natural operations on the chain complex defining the cohomology of an algebra over a non - symmetric ( regular ) operad .",
    "the example of associative algebras is very classical . since the introduction of this ( co)chain complex by hochschild in 1945",
    ", it has been extensively studied .",
    "m. gerstenhaber proved in the sixties that the cohomology of any associative algebra is endowed with two coherent products : the commutative cup product and a lie bracket .",
    "this structure is now called a _ gerstenhaber algebra_. ( gerstenhaber also used this lie bracket to study deformations of associative algebras .",
    "this led to the work of kontsevich on deformation - quantization of poisson manifold thirty years latter ) .",
    "in homotopy theory , there is a topological operad , formed by configurations of disks in the plane and called the _ little disks operad _ , whose action permits to recognize two - fold loop spaces . in 1976 , f. cohen proved that the operad defined by the homology of the little disks operad is equal to the operad coding gerstenhaber algebras .",
    "therefore the hochschild cohomology space is an algebra over the homology of the little disks operad .",
    "this surprising link between algebra , topology and geometry led deligne to formulate the conjecture that this relation can be lifted on ( co)chain complexes , that is the singular chain complex of the little disks operad acts on the hochschild ( co)chain complex of an associative algebra .",
    "this conjecture was proved by several researchers using different methods . in the present paper , we take a transversal approach .",
    "we prove that deligne s conjecture holds for a general class of operads and is not specific to the case of associative algebras . using manin s products ,",
    "we construct operations on the chain complex of any algebra over an operad of this class .",
    "( to be more precise , finitely generated binary non - symmetric koszul operads form this class ) .",
    "since these operations verify the same relations than the ones on the hochschild ( co)chain complex , deligne s conjecture is then proved with the same methods .",
    "+ since the white square product is the koszul dual of the black square product , we can compute the koszul duals of operads defined by black square product .",
    "the first example is the operad @xmath47 defined by m. aguiar and j .- l .",
    "loday in @xcite . using the explicit description of its koszul dual and the method of partition posets of @xcite",
    ", we prove that it is koszul over @xmath48 , which answers a conjecture of aguiar - loday . actually , with the same method",
    ", we show that the families @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , @xmath52 are koszul over @xmath48 .",
    "these families provide infinitely many examples for which deligne s conjecture hold over @xmath48 .",
    "+ appendix a is a survey on the notions of operads and properads .",
    "appendix b yields a categorical approach of algebra with monoids and comonoids ( ( co)ideal , ( co)modules ) .",
    "+ unless stated otherwise , we work over a field @xmath53 of characteristic @xmath54 .",
    "in this section , we define the general framework of _ 2-monoidal category _ verified by the examples studied throughout the text .",

    "<S> in this article we give a conceptual definition of manin products in any category endowed with two coherent monoidal products . </S>",
    "<S> this construction can be applied to associative algebras , non - symmetric operads , operads , colored operads , and properads presented by generators and relations . </S>",
    "<S> these two products , called black and white , are dual to each other under koszul duality functor . </S>",
    "<S> we study their properties and compute several examples of black and white products for operads . </S>",
    "<S> these products allow us to define natural operations on the chain complex defining cohomology theories . </S>",
    "<S> with these operations , we are able to prove that deligne s conjecture holds for a general class of operads and is not specific to the case of associative algebras . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we prove generalized versions of a few conjectures raised by m. aguiar and j .- l . </S>",
    "<S> loday related to the koszul property of operads defined by black products . </S>",
    "<S> these operads provide infinitely many examples for this generalized deligne s conjecture .    _ dedicated to jean - louis loday , on the occasion of his sixtieth birthday _ </S>"
