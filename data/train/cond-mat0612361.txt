    "most of the current experiments involving trapped atomic fermi gases focus on the bec - bcs crossover . by changing the magnetic field around a feshbach resonance ,",
    "the scattering length @xmath0 of the atoms can be varied from small positive values through very large values near the resonance to small negative values . for @xmath1 , @xmath2 ( where @xmath3 denotes the fermi momentum )",
    "the system can be considered as a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) of diatomic molecules .",
    "the crossover region , @xmath4 , is not yet very well understood from a theoretical point of view .",
    "finally , on the other side of the resonance , when @xmath5 , @xmath6 , the system should be in the bcs phase if the temperature is sufficiently low .",
    "however , the bcs critical temperature @xmath7 is extremely low , and very soon the magnetic field reaches the point where @xmath7 becomes smaller than the actual temperature @xmath8 , and the system undergoes the phase transition to the normal ( non - superfluid ) phase .",
    "one possibility to study the crossover experimentally is to measure the properties of certain collective oscillations .",
    "for example , the radial and axial breathing modes of a cigar - shaped trapped fermi gas have been measured over the whole crossover region @xcite . in these experiments",
    "one can observe how the frequencies and damping rates of the modes change from what one expects for a bec to what one expects for a collisionless normal fermi gas .",
    "assuming that , except in the collisionless normal phase , hydrodynamics is valid , the measured frequencies can give some information on the equation of state in the crossover region .",
    "however , this schematic picture is not completely accurate .",
    "since the system is in a trap , there is no sharp transition from the superfluid to the normal phase .",
    "this can be seen as follows : the bcs critical temperature @xmath7 depends on the atom density @xmath9 , and the density depends on the position @xmath10 . in the center of the trap ,",
    "the density @xmath11 and hence the local critical temperature @xmath12 are higher than in the outer part of the trap . as a consequence , for a given temperature ,",
    "the outer part gets already normal at a magnetic field where the inner part is still superfluid . to be more precise",
    ", a system in the bcs phase at finite temperature behaves effectively like a mixture of superfluid and normal components with densities @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively , which become @xmath15 , @xmath16 in the limit @xmath17 and @xmath18 , @xmath19 in the limit @xmath20 . as a consequence , if @xmath21 , the superfluid inner part of the trap behaves like a mixture of normal and superfluid components , while only the outer part with @xmath22 is completely normal @xcite .    if the collision rate was high enough , also the normal component of the gas would behave hydrodynamically .",
    "such a system could be described by landau s two - fluid hydrodynamics which has been applied to collective modes in trapped superfluid gases at finite temperature @xcite . however , although in the recent experiments the transition to the normal phase seemed to occur at a value of @xmath23 @xcite ( i.e. , the bcs phase has not really been reached ) , the system behaved already like a collisionless normal fermi gas .",
    "hence it seems to be clear that the normal component can not be treated in terms of hydrodynamics , but a description in terms of a vlasov equation is required .",
    "we note that there are other approaches to the description of the collective modes at finite temperature .",
    "in particular , let us mention the quasiparticle random phase approximation ( qrpa ) @xcite , which can be seen as the linearized form of the time - dependent bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) equations .",
    "however , for practical reasons this method is limited to systems with spherical symmetry and numbers of particles up to a few times @xmath24 .",
    "another disadvantage of this method is that it does not allow to include a collision term .    for the case of clean superconductors ,",
    "a semiclassical transport theory taking the coupling between normal and superconducting components into account has been developed by betbeder - matibet and nozires @xcite .",
    "transport theories of this type have also been used for describing the dynamics of superfluid @xmath25he @xcite . in a preceding paper @xcite , we derived the semiclassical transport equations for the case of trapped atomic fermi gases and applied them to the quadrupole mode of a gas in a spherical trap .",
    "we found that the presence of the normal component leads to a strong damping of the hydrodynamic collective mode .",
    "the same mechanism might explain the strong damping observed experimentally near the transition to the collisionless behavior @xcite . however , in ref .",
    "@xcite we had to replace the gap @xmath26 by a constant in order to find an analytical solution of the transport equations . due to this simplification , which can not really be justified , the damping of the hydrodynamic mode at a given temperature was much weaker than that obtained in qrpa calculations @xcite .    in the present paper we will work out a numerical method which allows us to treat the realistic @xmath10-dependence of the gap .",
    "in addition , the method is very versatile and allows to treat much more general cases than can be solved analytically in the constant - gap approximation .",
    "the basic idea is to replace the continuous phase - space distribution function of the quasiparticles by a sum of a finite number of delta functions in phase space , called `` test particles . ''",
    "in the normal phase , the test - particle method is routinely used for solving the vlasov equation , e.g. for simulating heavy - ion collisions in nuclear physics @xcite .",
    "it has also been applied to the simulation of the dynamics of normal trapped atomic fermi gases with collision term @xcite and of bose - fermi mixtures @xcite . however , to our knowledge , the test - particle method has not yet been used in the context of superfluid systems , and in fact the numerical difficulties are quite different from those encountered in the usual applications .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ transportbcs ] , we give a brief summary of the transport equations for the bcs phase and their linearization in the case of small deviations from equilibrium .",
    "we also give arguments why some terms which appear in the equations can be neglected .",
    "[ testparticlemethod ] we introduce the test - particle method for the case of small oscillations around equilibrium .",
    "we describe in detail a number of tricky points we encountered during the implementation of the method , in particular the calculation of the test - particle trajectories , the generation of the test - particle distribution in phase space , and the initialization after a delta - like perturbation . in sec .",
    "[ firstresults ] we present the first results obtained with the help of this method , again for the quadrupole mode in a spherical system .",

    ".    as the temperature @xmath8 approaches @xmath7 , the quadrupole mode of the normal phase ( that at @xmath356 ) becomes undamped , as it is the case within the qrpa .",
    "however , even though collisions are strongly suppressed at these low temperatures , it should be kept in mind that the collision term , which is neglected in the present work , is non - zero and its inclusion would lead to a finite lifetime of this oscillation , too .",

    "[ figqrpa ] we show the qrpa    , @xmath357 , @xmath259 .",

    "as one can see , the total normalization and the relative weights of the two peaks are in reasonable agreement . also",
    "the widths of the qrpa peaks are well reproduced by the semiclassical calculation .",
    "the main differences are that within the semiclassical calculation the two peaks lie a bit too high and that they are not as well separated as within the qrpa . a comparison of the two curves for @xmath339 and @xmath327 in the @xmath358 case shown in the middle of fig .",
    "[ figqfft ] , whose parameters are quite close to those of fig .",
    "[ figqrpa ] , suggests that the latter effect might be partly due to the restricted ansatz for the phase .",
    "however , as one can deduce from the irregular structure of the qrpa spectrum , even in a system with 32000 atoms shell effects , i.e. , effects which depend on the discrete single - particle spectrum , are still quite pronounced .",
    "it is clear that such effects can not be reproduced within a semiclassical calculation . in this sense",
    "the agreement between the two spectra is very satisfactory , in particular since one can assume that the shell effects decrease with increasing number of particles .",
    "in this paper , we developed a numerical test - particle method for solving the semiclassical transport equations for an ultracold trapped fermi gas in the bcs phase in the collisionless limit .",
    "these transport equations take into account the coupling between the dynamics of the cooper pairs ( superfluid component ) and the thermally excited bogoliubov quasiparticles ( normal component ) .",
    "we developed the method for the case of small deviations from equilibrium , so that the test - particle trajectories can be calculated in the equilibrium state .",
    "since the test - particles describe bogoliubov quasiparticles rather than real particles , the trajectories have very unusual properties compared with the trajectories one has to deal with when applying the test - particle method to the normal vlasov equation .",
    "our test particles can have the character of particles as well as holes , depending on whether their energy @xmath113 is positive or negative , and they can also be transformed from the one into the other if they hit the region where the gap @xmath50 becomes larger than their quasiparticle energy @xmath59 ( andreev reflection ) .",
    "another complication as compared with the normal vlasov equation is that the dynamics of the quasiparticles is coupled to the collective motion of the superfluid component , which is described by the phase @xmath56 of the order parameter .",
    "this phase has to be determined simultaneously with the evolution of the quasiparticle - distribution function by solving the continuity equation . in the present work",
    ", we make an ansatz for @xmath56 with time - dependent coefficients , leading to an approximate solution of the continuity equation .    as a first application , we calculated the response of a gas trapped in a spherical trap to a delta - like perturbation of quadrupole form .",
    "after this perturbation , the shape of the gas shows a damped oscillation . at low temperatures ,",
    "this oscillation is just the hydrodynamic quadrupole mode which is damped by its coupling to the normal component . with increasing temperatures , the extension of the normal component increases , and , as a consequence",
    ", the normal component can perform its own quadrupole oscillation .",
    "since the frequency of the quadrupole mode in the normal collisionless fermi gas is higher than that of the hydrodynamic mode , this leads to a two - peak structure in the response function .",
    "as the temperature approaches @xmath7 , the strength of the hydrodynamic mode disappears and only the normal mode survives .    the next step will be to apply the method presented here to more realistic cases , namely to the axial and radial breathing modes of a gas in a cigar - shaped trap containing a larger number of particles .",
    "in fact , the deformation and the large particle number do not pose a big problem , which is one of the main advantages of the present method as compared with quantum mechanical qrpa calculations .",
    "another possible application of the method is to study the dynamics of a vortex , where already the equilibrium situation is characterized by a non - vanishing phase of the order parameter .    however , there are still a number of unsolved problems and possible improvements of the method .",
    "first of all , the collision term @xcite should be included , which is an additional source of damping of the collective oscillations . as mentioned in the introduction",
    ", the possibility to include collisions is an important advantage of the present method as compared with the qrpa , where collision effects can not be taken into account since this would necessitate to include four - quasiparticle excitations .",
    "second , from a fundamental point of view , the fact that the continuity equation is only approximately fulfilled is of course unsatisfactory and one should think about another numerical method for solving the continuity equation .",
    "finally , one might ask the question how the present theory can be extended to the strongly interacting regime . unfortunately",
    ", this question is up to now completely open , since in this regime thermal fluctuations of the order parameter , which are not contained in the bdg equations , play a crucial role ( see , e.g. , ref .",

    "<S> at finite temperature , the hydrodynamic collective modes of superfluid trapped fermi gases are coupled to the motion of the normal component , which in the bcs limit behaves like a collisionless normal fermi gas . the coupling between the superfluid and the normal components is treated in the framework of a semiclassical transport theory for the quasiparticle - distribution function , combined with a hydrodynamic equation for the collective motion of the superfluid component . </S>",
    "<S> we develop a numerical test - particle method for solving these equations in the linear response regime . as a first application we study the temperature dependence of the collective quadrupole mode of a fermi gas in a spherical trap . </S>",
    "<S> the coupling between the superfluid collective motion and the quasiparticles leads to a rather strong damping of the hydrodynamic mode already at very low temperatures . at higher temperatures the spectrum has a two - peak structure , the second peak corresponding to the quadrupole mode in the normal phase </S>"
