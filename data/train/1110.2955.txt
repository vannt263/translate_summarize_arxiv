    "massive star formation ( m@xmath1 m@xmath2 ) is one of the most challenging astrophysical problems .",
    "it is established that most massive stars form from massive prestellar cores and occur in high - order multiple systems ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "nevertheless , all theoretical numerical models to date show that massive prestellar cores are unlikely to form without first fragmenting into several objects .",
    "in addition , recent observational work ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggests that collapsing massive dense cores are less fragmented than what numerical calculations produce although the limited observational resolution available precludes a definitive answer .",
    "for instance , isothermal simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , radiative calculations @xcite , magnetized ones @xcite and even calculations including radiative ionisation @xcite , tend all to form several fragments .",
    "indeed , both radiation and magnetic fields tend to reduce the number of fragments ( e.g. a factor of about 2 for highly magnetized cores ) without suppressing the fragmentation . to balance this fragmentation issue , @xcite proposed a column density threshold for massive star formation .",
    "however , this model only applies to massive star formation under certain conditions , and in particular to massive stars , whose formation has been possible thanks to the radiative feedback of low - mass protostars .    in this letter",
    ", we perform full radiation - magneto - hydrodynamics ( rmhd ) calculations of massive , turbulent , and magnetized dense cores .",
    "this work is an extension towards higher masses of the study by @xcite , who investigated low - mass star formation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 1 we discuss our numerical method and initial conditions .",
    "our results are presented in section 2 . in section 3",
    "we dicsuss a new scenario for massive star formation and section 4 concludes the paper .",
    "our initial setup is identical to the one used in @xcite , except that we do not use a barotropic equation of state .",
    "we consider 100 m@xmath3 spherical dense cores , which are threaded by a magnetic field parallel to the @xmath4-direction .",
    "the initial radius of the sphere is 0.67 pc and the total box - length is 2.76 pc .",
    "the density profile is given by @xmath5 , where @xmath6 g @xmath7 is the central density , and @xmath8 pc is the extent of the central plateau .",
    "we impose a density contrast between the central density and the edge density of 10 .",
    "the initial temperature of the core is uniform and equals 10 k. outside the cloud , the matter is also set to 10 k. the adiabatic index is set to @xmath9 .",
    "we use the rosseland @xmath10 and planck @xmath11 mean opacities derived in @xcite . at temperature",
    "@xmath12 k , we impose @xmath13 @xmath14 g@xmath15 , in order to limit the grain evaporation effect and to account for an inertia of the evaporation .",
    "we impose an initial subsonic turbulent velocity dispersion which follows a kolmogorov power spectrum @xmath16 , where the phases are randomly sorted in the fourier space .",
    "only one realization is explored in this study .",
    "the turbulence is not artificially sustained but , does not really decay as the gravitational time is typically shorter than the crossing time .",
    "the kinetic energy power spectrum peak roughly corresponds to the box size .",
    "the ratio of the turbulent to gravitational energies is given by @xmath17 .",
    "we do not include explicitly rotation but the turbulent field contains angular momentum ( both local and global ) .",
    "note that our initial conditions exhibits a relatively flat density profile , which should favor fragmentation @xcite .",
    "the magnetic intensity is set by the parameter @xmath18 , which represents the value of mass - to - flux over critical mass - to - flux ratio @xcite . in this letter",
    ", we explore 3 magnetization degrees : @xmath19 corresponding to a weak initial magnetic field , and @xmath20 and @xmath21 which are close to the observed values ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we also investigate an almost spherical case with no magnetic field and no turbulence ( model sphydro ) to serve as simple reference with respect to which the other simulations can be compared .",
    "all the simulations parameters are summarized in table [ condinit ] .",
    "future work will imply further investigations on the effects of turbulence or rotation , but this goes beyond the scope of this letter .",
    "we use the adaptive mesh refinement code @xcite , which integrates the self - consistent equations of rmhd using ideal mhd @xcite , and flux limited diffusion for rhd @xcite .",
    "we impose a refinement criterion @xmath22 , which insures that the local jeans length is resolved by at least 10 cells .",
    "the initial grid contains @xmath23 cells and we use 10 levels of refinement for an effective resolution of @xmath24 and a minimum grid size of @xmath25 au .",
    "we apply periodic boundary conditions for hydrodynamics and gravity , and we impose a temperature of 10 k for the radiation at the edge of the box .    cccccc model & @xmath26 & @xmath17 & @xmath27x@xmath28 ( au ) & coarse grid & @xmath29 ( myr ) + sphydro & @xmath30 & @xmath31 & 2.16 & @xmath32 & 0.4786 + mu130 & @xmath33 & @xmath34 & 2.16 & @xmath23 & 0.4935 + mu5 & @xmath35 & @xmath34 & 2.16 & @xmath23 & 0.5397 + mu2 & @xmath36 & @xmath34 & 2.16 & @xmath23 & 0.5982 +",
    "in this section , we qualitatively describe the results of the four calculations .",
    "calculations are synchronized at the time @xmath29 when the maximum level of refinement is reached ( see table [ condinit ] ) . the subsequent evolution after @xmath29 strongly depends on the physical conditions ( rotation , outflows , etc ... ) . at @xmath29 , the first hydrostatic core ( fhsc , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is forming .",
    "as expected , we note that the stronger the magnetic field is , the later the collapse occurs because magnetic fields  dilutes \" gravity . in figure [ col_dens ] ,",
    "column density and local jeans length maps of the four calculations are shown in the @xmath37-plane .",
    "the boxes are centered at the maximum density of the total computational domain . in the sphydro model ,",
    "only one central fragment is formed and the collapse is nearly spherical .",
    "the mass of the fragment , i.e. where @xmath38 @xmath7 , at time @xmath39 kyr is @xmath34 m@xmath2 .",
    "the integrated mass of the envelope from the fragment which is stable against fragmentation , i.e. @xmath40 , is @xmath41 m@xmath3 and the accretion rate is @xmath42 m@xmath2 yr@xmath15 .    in the mu130 model",
    ", the additional turbulent support clearly favors fragmentation ( 6 fragments are formed at that time ) over a region of 2000 - 4000 au .",
    "the mean separation between the fragments is about 1000 au and they are distributed at this early time along a filamentary structure .",
    "this separation corresponds to the typical jeans length associated with the region surrounding each fragment .",
    "the overall accretion rate on the fragments is relatively low , @xmath31 m@xmath2 yr@xmath15 , and consistent with the ones obtained in the low - mass star formation framework .",
    "the mean mass of the fragments is about @xmath43 m@xmath2 ( @xmath44 m@xmath2 in total ) and corresponds to the local jeans mass .    in the mu5 model",
    ", the core has fragmented into two main objects , one being formed by the merger of secondary fragments .",
    "the fragmentation zone has the same filamentary morphology as in the mu130 model , but the extent is smaller .",
    "the angular momentum is more efficiently transported than in the mu130 model because of the stronger magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the region where rotation can support the collapsing cloud is thus smaller .",
    "the local jeans length raises substantially indicating that the core is less prone to fragment .",
    "the accretion rate in this model is @xmath45 m@xmath2 yr@xmath15 .",
    "the mass within each fragment is @xmath46 m@xmath3 .    in the mu2 model ,",
    "there is only one fragment which drives a low velocity outflow ( @xmath47 km s@xmath15 ) of extent @xmath48 1500 au .",
    "the accretion rate is @xmath49 m@xmath2 yr@xmath15 .",
    "the local jeans length is much larger than in the mu130 and mu5 models and shows some typical features of magnetized dense core collapse .",
    "the region of small jeans length ( l@xmath50 au ) corresponds to the pseudo - disk that has formed perpendicular to the magnetic field lines at larger scales .",
    "the feature that appears in the vertical direction corresponds to the outflow that has been launched around the central fragment .",
    "as radiation preferentially escapes perpendicular to the pseudo - disk where the optical depth is smaller , the outflow region heats up and the local jeans length raises . at time",
    "@xmath51 kyr , the mass of the fragment is @xmath46 m@xmath3 and the associated jeans stable mass integrated through the envelope is @xmath52 m@xmath3 and extends to a radius of @xmath53 au .",
    "by contrast in the mu5 model , the stable jeans mass associated to each fragment is @xmath44 m@xmath3 and extends to a radius of @xmath54 au .",
    "we note that we have performed lower resolution calculations ( @xmath55 au and @xmath56 au ) which do not show any fragmentation at latter times , while similar mu130 simulations show a lot of fragments ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) . at times given in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the mass contained in the fragments with @xmath55 au is @xmath57 m@xmath2 for the mu130 model and @xmath58 m@xmath2 for mu2 ( respectively @xmath59 m@xmath2 and @xmath60 m@xmath2 with @xmath56 au . )      in this section , we focus on the thermal behavior observed in the sphydro model , i.e. without turbulence and magnetic field . figure [ profiles ] shows radial profiles of density and temperature at time @xmath39 kyr .",
    "the density profile exhibits the classical @xmath61 slope in the envelope @xcite . unlike the low mass star formation case , for which @xmath62 in the optically thin envelope , we find that the temperature profile in the preshock region ahead of the fhsc is steeper .",
    "the optically thick region extends up to a radius of @xmath63 au ( vertical grey line ) much larger than the fhsc radius @xmath64 au .",
    "the radiation is thus trapped in an optically thick bubble where the infalling gas can be efficiently heated and the jeans length raises efficiently . compared to the low - mass star case , the accretion rate and thus the post - accretion shock temperature are larger ( @xmath48250 k compared to @xmath4870 k ) .",
    "since @xmath65 for temperature @xmath0 k , this explains the larger optical depth found towards higher masses .",
    "the temperature profile is well fitted in the optically thick region with @xmath66 ( dotted line ) .",
    "such a profile is obtained assuming that the rate of change in kinetic energy , @xmath67 equals the radiative flux , @xmath68 ( with @xmath10 constant for temperature ranging from 100 k to 1000 k ) . at larger radii",
    "the optically thin behavior , @xmath62 ( dashed line ) , is recovered after a transition regime , until the equilibrium temperature of 10 k is reached .",
    "figure [ trho ] shows the temperature distribution as a function of the density at two times for the four models . to visualize the difference between our work and other studies , we overplot the barotropic law that is used in @xcite . with a full rmhd model",
    ", we obtain a spread in temperature and jeans mass which depends on the magnetization of the core that a barotropic eos can not reproduce . the sphydro and mu2 models are strikingly similar in the heating efficiency , even though the spread in temperature is larger in the mu2 model because of the initial turbulence . the rotation in not large enough to support the collapsing core at larger radii because of the magnetic braking , and matter is accreted onto a single fragment of similar size and accretion rate as in the sphydro model .",
    "the accretion luminosity on the fhsc , @xmath69 , is thus about the same . in the mu130 model ,",
    "the accretion rate is much lower and the contraction of the fhsc slower because of lower temperature . as a consequence ,",
    "the typical jeans mass is about 2 orders of magnitude lower than in the sphydro and mu2 models . as in other models",
    "@xcite , the mu130 model shows fragmentation in several objects even at time @xmath70 kyr , where three objects formed with separation of 3000 - 5000 au . as the magnetic braking is very small here , the radius at which the collapse is stopped and where fragmentation is taking place , is thus much larger than the fhsc radius , and the accretion luminosity negligible .",
    "even with a fragment undergoing second collapse , the radiative feedback would not be efficient at a distance of @xmath71 au to suppress fragmentation .",
    "for an optically thin envelope , the temperature indeed scales as @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the accretion luminosity on the protostar , @xmath74 ( @xmath75k at 3000 au with @xmath76 m@xmath77yr , @xmath78 m@xmath2 , and @xmath79 r@xmath2 ) .",
    "finally , the mu5 model shows an intermediate behavior . although the heating owing to the accretion shock on the central fragment is already large , external regions have time to cool and to continue collapsing to form a secondary fragment .",
    "as first suggested by @xcite in the low mass star formation framework , we show that there is a strong _ interplay _ between magnetic field and radiative transfer which may suppress initial fragmentation . because of the rotation slowdown owing to the magnetic braking ( most efficient at scales @xmath80 au ) , the infall velocity on the fragment is then greater . for massive dense cores ,",
    "the accretion is larger than for low mass ones and the amount of energy radiated away at the fhsc surface , the accretion luminosity , is thus much larger .",
    "depending on the initial conditions , we find three totally different behaviors :    * for a spherical massive dense core , without turbulence and magnetic field , we find that the core s envelope heats efficiently ( sphydro model ) , because the radius at which the accretion luminosity is released is small ( fhsc radius ) .",
    "we also find that contrary to the low - mass regime ,",
    "the optically thick regions is much more extended , up to @xmath81 au ( @xmath4810 au for the low - mass case ) . only one fragment is formed ; * in the mu130 model , the magnetic braking is too low to transport outwards angular momentum produced by the initial turbulence .",
    "7 fragments have formed by the end of the calculations .",
    "the fragmentation zone extends over a few thousands au , at which accretion luminosity is first released through a radiative shock .",
    "disks with radius @xmath82 au are also formed around the fragments , which give a second accretion shock at the disk edges .",
    "the infalling gas thus encounters several accretion shocks before being accreted onto several fhscs , which lowers the accretion luminosity . * for highly magnetized and turbulent massive dense cores ( mu2 model )",
    "we find very similar results to the sphydro model , i.e. a single fragment , because of the magnetic braking that lowers the radius at which the accretion luminosity is released to the fhsc radius .",
    "* we find an intermediate behavior for lower magnetization degrees ( mu5 model ) , where the core fragments into two objects of similar properties .",
    "the latter model may be the most realistic one , in accordance with observations ( see hereafter ) .",
    "our results suggest that the _ combined _ effect of magnetic fields and radiative transfer could control the early fragmentation of the core and we speculate that this could lead either to the formation of isolated massive stars or ob associations .",
    "the mu2 model gives raise to a single fragment with a large reservoir of mass @xmath52 m@xmath2 stable against fragmentation .",
    "the strong magnetic field case is thus a preferred scenario for non - runaway massive stars ( i.e. not ejected form a cluster ) that are found in isolation .",
    "our proposed scenario does not exclude the formation of close massive binaries and ob associations .",
    "fragmentation in massive binary system can possibly occur in more massive cores or in cores with different initial conditions than ours ( for example with stronger density fluctuations initially ) .",
    "they could also form during the second collapse phase as it has been shown in the low mass star formation framework @xcite .",
    "ob associations can also form by global collapse of a giant molecular cloud containing several massive magnetized dense cores .",
    "in addition , the mu5 model produce two fragments , that are also associated with a relatively high jeans mass reservoir .",
    "contrary to previous lower resolution studies @xcite , the secondary fragment is not produced by disc fragmentation , but rather by collapse along a filamentary structure .",
    "one can expect that this early fragmented system will also give rise to a close massive binary system following results of @xcite .",
    "recently @xcite report observations of a hot molecular core ( hmc ) in the massive star - forming region g3141 and conclude that the gravitational collapse of the hmc is controlled by magnetic field .",
    "they also observe a spin - down in the hmc which suggests that magnetic braking is acting and removing angular momentum .",
    "last but not least , they infer a mass - to - flux over critical mass - to - flux ratio of 2.7 which corroborates our results . at later evolution stages , @xcite observe a very massive star of @xmath81 m@xmath2 in apparent isolation from the massive cluster r136 , which could be formed from a highly magnetized dense core rather than being ejected form the dense cluster . @xcite report imaging of massive dense cores with high angular resolution .",
    "they find that fragmentation in massive core tends to lead to fewer high - mass fragments inconsistent with a pure gravoturbulent fragmentation ( which would correspond to the mu130 model ) .",
    "their results support our findings on the enhanced effect of the magnetic braking and radiative transfer when mass increases .",
    "in this letter , we propose a new mechanism to suppress initial fragmentation of highly magnetized massive dense cores and speculate that it can lead to massive star formation .",
    "our scenario differs form previous work , since it does not invoke stellar mergers as in the competitive accretion scenario @xcite , nor low mass protostars radiative feedback and high column density @xcite , nor disk fragmentation @xcite .",
    "we investigate the early stages of the collapse and fragmentation of turbulent , massive , and magnetized dense cores with rmhd calculations .",
    "we show that the combined effect of magnetic braking and radiative transfer suppresses fragmentation in the case of a strong magnetic field as it has been shown in the low - mass star formation framework @xcite .",
    "magnetic braking transports angular momentum outwards , and the accretion rate on the fhsc is thus larger .",
    "as shown in @xcite , all the infall kinetic energy is radiated away at the first core accretion shock and allows greater heating . the interplay between magnetic fields and radiative",
    "transfer is independent from the initial conditions other than magnetic fields strength . in addition , this interplay can only be caught in self - consistent rmhd models with thermal ( re-)emission and radiative shocks .",
    "this effect is expected to become stronger with appropriate physical models for the second collapse and second core formation and for protostellar evolution ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to reach the final stellar mass , the subsequent evolution of the forming protostars can then follow a disk accretion scenario @xcite .",
    "further work will imply detailed fragmentation and resolution studies ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and the introduction of sink particles to follow a longer dynamical range .",
    "we also neglect in this work ionization and protostellar feedbacks which influence further time evolution @xcite ."
