    "carbon nano - peapods were discovered almost one decade ago @xcite ( see also the review papers refs .  @xcite ) . they have been proven to be novel graphitic structures with electrical and mechanical properties that can not be reduced to the sum of properties of their subcomponents ( an empty carbon nanotube and individual fullerene molecules ) .",
    "peapods , a composite system consisting of a rigid single - wall nanotube ( swnt ) cage and an inner mechanically soft chain of fullerenes , can exhibit interesting nano - electro - mechanical properties if the coupling of delocalized electron states on the tube with the fullerene molecular orbitals is sufficiently strong .",
    "buckyballs inside a swnt are neutral objects and one can not expect any direct electrical influence of encapsulated molecules on electron transport along a nanotube shell . however , stm spectroscopy of semiconducting peapods @xcite showed that the local electron density of states in carbon nanotubes is strongly modified by encapsulated @xmath0 molecules .",
    "these measurements can be theoretically interpreted in terms of a strong hybridization of electronic states on the nanotube surface with the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals ( lumo ) of the encaged @xmath0 . the corresponding hybridization strength was estimated in refs .",
    "@xcite to be close to @xmath1 ev .",
    "this energy is comparable to other characteristic energies of swnts and this means that virtual hopping of delocalized electrons from the swnt to the local lumo states is possible and can strongly influence the electronic properties of the swnts .",
    "even though all samples in the cited experiment were semiconducting nanotubes , one could expect from theoretical considerations an analogous strong hybridization at least for _ chiral _ metallic nanotubes ( see ref .",
    "@xcite where a theory of scanning tunneling spectroscopy of long @xmath0 peapods was developed ) .",
    "notice that such a strong hybridization between fullerene - derived and nanotube - derived energy levels in peapods could shift the lumo states even below the fermi energy of the swnt .",
    "this possibility was however ruled out in recent photoemission experiments , @xcite .    in this work",
    "we suggest that a strong coupling between the electronic states on the swnt shell and the localized states on the fullerenes affects resonant tunneling transport of electrons through the metallic peapod system in a manner that is experimentally observable .",
    "in particular , we propose that resonant electron transport due to polaronic effects provides a method for studying the fullerene nanomechanical dynamics through the temperature dependence of the resonant conductance peaks .",
    "this should be readily observable since the characteristic temperature scale for the strong polaronic modification of the peaks is set by the fullerene vibration frequencies and may be very low compared to typical electronic energies .",
    "recent experiments with high - quality peapods demonstrated coulomb blockade and kondo physics at low temperatures , @xcite .",
    "the spacings of conductance peaks was found to be regular over a wide range of gate voltages , indicating that the constant interaction model of coulomb blockade ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) applies for these dots .",
    "the peak amplitudes , on the other hand , strongly fluctuate from peak to peak . in the case of an empty metallic swnt both peak spacings and amplitudes",
    "should ideally vary slowly with the gate voltage , except for variations of level spacings dictated by the particular swnt bandstructure which leads to four - electron shells . while earlier experiments on empty nanotubes have exhibited strongly fluctuating peak conductances ( see e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , defect - free swnts have indeed shown remarkably gate - independent peak amplitudes @xcite .",
    "we show here that for carbon nano - peapods , electromechanical effects can lead to strong fluctuations of the coulomb peaks .",
    "the mechanism will be effective even with defect - free nanotube shells .",
    "this phenomenon may explain the strongly fluctuating peak amplitudes seen in peapod experiments @xcite - detailed studies of coulomb blockade peak fluctuations could thus reveal polaronic effects in quantum dots .",
    "molecular conductors constitute another important class for which the vibronic coupling is also nearly always present , and for which it plays a fundamental role in the study of the transport properties , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in the following section [ spectrum ] ,",
    "we investigate how the presence of even one encapsulated fullerene molecule , treated as a short - range scattering potential , can influence the electron energy spectrum of the swnt by a strong polaronic effect .",
    "this will allow us to define the hamiltonian of the peapod in an independent electron model . in section [ transport ] , the current through the peapod and hence its conductance are evaluated and studied , in this regime of strong polaronic coupling .",
    "since the fullerene scattering potential in reality has an intermediate range , we discuss in section [ graphene ] how the peapod conductance is affected in the opposite limit of a long - range fullerene - induced scattering potential . here , the appropriate model for the swnt electrons involves the use of the dirac equation .",
    "finally , in section v we present our conclusions .",
    "the position of an individual buckyball inside the tube , for a partially filled peapod , is not fixed , and mechanical motion of the fullerene is excited in the process of virtual electron transitions onto and off the fullerene lumo level .",
    "the effective excitation energy @xmath2 strongly depends on the buckyball confinement potential . for vibrations in the nearly harmonic ( for small displacements )",
    "transverse girifalco potential @xcite the corresponding energy @xmath3 is of the order of mev s .",
    "notice that electro - mechanical vibrations of @xmath0 in the van der waals - like potential between two gold electrodes have already been measured ( @xmath4 mev ) in tunneling experiments @xcite .",
    "the longitudinal motion of @xmath0 inside the tube is less restricted and the corresponding excitation energy @xmath5 could be much smaller .",
    "it is worth to notice here that the nanotube shell of peapods can in fact be quite full of large ( @xmath6 nm ) holes in the tube walls .",
    "only a small number of openings , used before to fill the tube , are healed in the post processing , @xcite .",
    "the average spacing between the holes can be estimated to be @xmath7 nm , @xcite .",
    "the holes produce a repulsive potential for fullerenes inside the tube , which we will model in our analytical calculations as a harmonic confinement potential with a characteristic energy @xmath8 mev , corresponding roughly to the zero - point energy of a @xmath0 confined to a length equal to the estimated average spacing between holes .",
    "we start with a single encapsulated @xmath0 placed at a distance @xmath9 from the nanotube end . the virtual processes of electron hopping onto and off the fullerene lumo level ( shifted upwards by the charging energy @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the fullerene diameter ) produce a local attractive potential for conduction electrons on the tube , @xcite .",
    "the first question one has to consider in order to formulate a theoretical model for the problem is whether this potential is short- or long - range with respect to its effect on electrons in metallic nanotubes .",
    "if the characteristic length of the scattering potential due to the fullerene is defined by its diameter , of the order of @xmath1 nm , its range is determined by a comparison with the fermi wavelength , @xmath12 , of electrons in a metallic swnt . since @xmath13  , @xcite , and",
    "hence is remarkable close to the fullerene diameter , the range of the potential is of intermediate range .",
    "it is therefore not a priori clear which of the two different limits , where an analytical investigation is possible , is the more appropriate one and we shall therefore discuss both .    in the first limit",
    ", the scattering potential is described as a short - range potential , which means that the hybridization - induced scattering potential is able to strongly backscatter electrons with a large momentum transfer , @xmath14 .",
    "this is the regime studied in this section by means of a single - electron model . in the opposite limit",
    "the scattering potential is described as a long - range potential when the real band structure of the swnt becomes important .",
    "this limit is hence discussed in section [ graphene ] using the dirac equation .    a short - range hybridization - induced scattering potential with the hybridization strength @xmath15 ev changes the distribution of level spacings in the conduction band of a finite - sized nanotube .",
    "by solving the schrdinger equation on a finite interval ( @xmath16 ) with a @xmath17-function scatterer placed at point @xmath18 one gets the spectrum equation @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the electron wave vector , ( @xmath21 ) , and the amplitude of the local scattering potential in our case represents the hybridization potential of ref .  @xcite . in our notation",
    "@xmath22 here , @xmath23 and @xmath24 is the energy of the hybridized side - level ( @xmath25 if one takes into account the charging energy for electron hopping to the @xmath0 lumo level ) .    the energy spectrum of eqs .",
    "( [ ss ] ) and ( [ uk ] ) when @xmath26 is not a small rational number is irregular for energies not far from the fermi energy ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , and indicates certain deviations from the mean level spacing @xmath27 ( notice that due to the two identical conduction bands in a swnt its mean level spacing is @xmath28 ) .",
    "however , as one can see from fig .",
    "1 , for a single scatterer the `` randomization '' is not pronounced even for energies close to the fermi energy . about @xmath29 of the levels deviate from the mean level spacing less than @xmath30 , and among these levels @xmath31 deviate less than @xmath32 .    , for a peapod with just one fullerene inside . unlike an empty swnt ,",
    "the spectrum is not uniform ; still , for a single scatterer ( fullerene ) , the randomization is not pronounced .",
    "the fermi energy @xmath33 is such that @xmath34 . ]",
    "a shift @xmath35 in the position of a scatterer leads to shifts of all quantized energy levels @xmath36 where the derivative of electron momentum with respect to scatterer position can easily be found from eq .",
    "( [ ss ] ) .    in order to get analytical results we will model the potential that confines the longitudinal motion of our scatterer ( buckyball inside a tube ) as a harmonic potential . in the adiabatic limit , @xmath37 ,",
    "when the electron spectrum is well defined for any position of the vibrating impurity , the total hamiltonian for a two - terminal conduction geometry reads@xmath38 : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the hamiltonian for the leads and @xmath41 for left and right reservoir respectively .",
    "the quantum dot ( qd ) hamiltonian reads : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the set of levels shown in fig . 1 , @xmath2 is the vibration energy quantum , @xmath44 and @xmath45 is the amplitude of zero - point fluctuations of the bosonic field ( @xmath46  for @xmath0 and for an energy value @xmath47 ) ; @xmath48 and @xmath49 are fermionic and bosonic operators with canonical commutation relations .",
    "the tunneling hamiltonian finally reads : @xmath50 where we suppose that the hopping matrix elements @xmath51 between the two leads and the dot are of the same order .",
    "we should point out that the coupling to the electronic states of the swnt does not significantly affect fullerene vibrations , which are mostly determined by fullerene _",
    "confinement _ by structural defects on the carbon nanotube .",
    "this is true even though the coupling to each single electronic state may be strong and depend on the fullerene position .",
    "however , when evaluating the total fullerene energy shift caused by coupling to a very large number of different electronic states , the coordinate dependence averages out and such a coupling does not contribute to the mechanical force",
    ".    the hamiltonian @xmath52 can be diagonalized by means of a unitary transformation , see _",
    "e.g. _ @xcite : @xmath53 , with @xmath54 .",
    "the result of this transformation is @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the polaronic shift of the resonant energy level and @xmath57 is the electron - vibron coupling constant .",
    "the tunneling hamiltonian is also transformed by the unitary trasnformation and it reads @xmath58 where the operator @xmath59 is defined as @xmath60\\;.\\ ] ]",
    "resonant electron tunneling through a vibrating quantum dot was considered in many papers ( see e.g. refs .  @xcite and references therein ) . for strong electron - phonon interaction ,",
    "two non - perturbative effects determine the low - temperature electron transport - ( i ) a polaronic shift of the resonant energy level , @xmath61 and ( ii ) a `` polaronic blockade '' ( exponential suppression ) of the peak conductance at low temperatures , @xmath62 . in our case , the coupling `` constant '' @xmath63 is a level - dependent quantity and it strongly fluctuates from level to level .",
    "such fluctuations are well visible in fig .",
    "2 .     as a function of state index @xmath64 .",
    "the coupling constant strongly fluctuates since it is proportional to the derivative of the energy spectrum .",
    "the corresponding value for the 8-th level , of the order of unity , is off the scale .",
    "the fermi level is between the 10-th and the 11-th levels .",
    "we stress that we do not intend to show the actual and absolute numerical values of the couplings @xmath65 .",
    "these `` constants '' can be obtained by fitting the experimental data to theory , as in @xcite .",
    "2 only aims to illustrate the strong level - to - level fluctuations of the coupling constant . in the case of @xmath66 independent molecules in the peapod",
    ", the average value of the coupling constant can be @xmath66 times larger than the values shown in the plot .",
    "in particular , the values of the coupling constant @xmath65 shown in the plot have been evaluated for a sample whose length is ten nanometres , and with a lumo energy and a hybridization energy of the same order as the fermi energy .",
    "these are the same values used to evaluate the spectrum in fig . 1 . ]",
    "we observe that these coupling constants being proportional to the derivative of the energy spectrum exhibit much more pronounced fluctuations then the energies themselves .",
    "the mean value of @xmath67 for strong backscattering potential ( @xmath68 ) can be estimated as @xmath69 .",
    "so , for the case of @xmath66 independent scatterers @xmath70 is the characteristic range of the longitudinal confinement potential ) the total polaronic shift will scale as @xmath71 . since the charging energy of our 1d system also scales as @xmath71 , it will be difficult to single out polaronic effects in the distribution of peak spacings as a function of gate voltage .",
    "besides , the irregular character of level spacings could be caused by different physical effects , _",
    "e.g. _ , by electron scattering due to imperfections ( holes ) of the nanotube surface .",
    "is there another manifestation of low - energy electro - mechanical effects in resonant electron tunneling ?      in order to study the peak to peak fluctuations in the electrical conductance , we first recover in this section the electric current flowing through the system .",

    ", we will treat the leads , as in @xcite , as unaffected by the vibrons modes in the dot .",
    "besides , we suppose that the bandwidth in the contacts is much larger than both the resonance width and the vibron energy quantum , that is we will evaluate the electron part of green function in the so called wide - band limit , @xcite .    under such assumptions , the retarded single particle green function can easily be evaluated , see also @xcite , and it reads @xmath78\\exp\\left [ -\\lambda^2(2 n(\\beta\\hbar\\omega_0)+1)\\right]\\nonumber\\\\ & \\times&\\sum_{l=-\\infty}^\\infty i_l\\{2\\lambda^2[n(\\beta\\hbar\\omega_0)(n(\\beta\\hbar\\omega_0)+1)]^{1/2}\\}\\exp\\left [ l\\hbar\\omega_0\\left(i \\frac{t}{\\hbar}-\\frac{\\beta}{2}\\right)\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath79 is the bose distribution , @xmath80 , @xmath81 is the modified bessel function of the first kind , and for sake of simplicity , we have omitted the index @xmath64 from the coupling constant @xmath65 .",

    "the usual @xmath101 behaviour is recovered for the conductance , but the latter is strongly suppressed because of the factor @xmath102 .",
    "this is the signal of the reduced probability for an electron to tunnel from a bare electronic state in the reservoir to a polaronic state in the dot .",

    "the latter equation indicates that for temperatures larger than @xmath2 , a competition arises between the vibrons and the polarons , giving rise to a non - monotonic behaviour . at temperatures @xmath115 , when the polaronic blockade is completely lifted ,",
    "the conductance scales as @xmath116 , as can be numerically verified . at such high temperatures ,",
    "the polaronic effects get completely destroyed by the thermally excited vibrons .",
    "the temperature lifting of the polaronic blockade results in a _ non - monotonic _ temperature dependence of the conductance peak .",
    "this behavior is shown in fig .",
    "3 , where we plot the temperature dependence of the amplitude of the coulomb blockade conductance peak for different values of the electron - vibron coupling @xmath117 .",
    "it is clearly seen from the figure that polaronic effects are pronounced only for strong electron - vibron interaction ( @xmath98 ) , and in the temperature region @xmath118 anomalous temperature dependence of resonance peaks appears .",
    "the observation in an experiment of a low - temperature scaling which differs from the usual @xmath116-dependence for narrow coulomb blockade conductance peaks , in general , indicates that the level width is not the only relevant energy scale in the problem .",
    "an anomalous temperature behavior and @xmath119-scaling is the signature of strong polaronic effects , as experimentally observed , @xcite .",
    "the polaronic effects discussed in the previous sections appear due to strong backscattering of the swnt electrons by the fullerene - induced potential , which was assumed to be short - range . here",
    "we want to consider the opposite limit of a long - range potential , where we can also obtain an analytical solution . in this case",
    "the real band structure of the swnt electrons must be considered .",
    "it is known that the specific band structure ( dirac - like spectrum ) leads to a new type of backscattering by even a long - range potential . in this section",
    "we will study the influence on polaronic effects of this type of backscattering , which is closely related to the chiral properties of the carbon nanotube ( the chiral angle ) .",
    "the band structure of graphene in the vicinity of the fermi energy ( these points in the brillouin zone of 2d graphite are usually labelled k and k ) is described by the dirac hamiltonian for massless fermions @xmath120 , @xcite ( see refs .",

    "the scattering potential is sharp and this results in strong backscattering @xmath130 by the boundaries .",
    "the spinor wave function of an electron in a nanotube now takes the form @xmath131 , where subindices ( + , - ) label two identical bands of the energy spectrum .",
    "the general boundary condition for a finite - sized system of dirac fermions is the absence of current through the boundaries .",
    "this condition is satisfied in our case if we assume perfect reflection at the boundaries , @xmath132 , where @xmath133 denote right(left)-moving particles in the `` + '' or `` - '' band .    in reference",

    "now , we would like to incorporate this result in order to consider resonant tunneling through the one dimensional wire .",
    "this can be easily done in the limit when the distances from the scatterer to the ends of the wire are much bigger than the spatial extension of the potential .",
    "hence , if one is not interested in the exact position of the resonant level , then the resonant transmission through the given level can be obtained in the approximation where the scatterer can be treated as a point - like defect .",
    "such a defect will be characterized by the same scattering matrix obtained for the electrons propagating in an infinite wire as in @xcite .",
    "the local ( @xmath17-function ) potential at @xmath18 now represents a long - range imperfection which scatters fermions only within its own band .",

    "we are interested in transport through a metallic swnt , that is in the case of a massless dirac spectrum , @xmath135 . in this limit , @xmath136",

    "( [ ds])-([phi ] ) that for a massless dirac spectrum the reflection coefficient vanishes for @xmath142 , that is for armchair nanotubes .",
    "the corresponding spectrum is uniform with level spacing @xmath143 , and the total energy shift , @xmath144 , is induced by forward electron scattering by the long - range potential .",
    "the absence of electron backscattering in non - chiral swnts ( formally due to conservation of chirality ) has repeatedly been discussed in the literature ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in general , the suppression of backscattering in metallic swnts as compared to semiconducting nanotubes ( where the presence of a gap in the spectrum mixes states with opposite chiralities ) is often used to explain the remarkably good conducting properties of long metallic carbon nanotubes , @xcite .    for the spectrum in eq .",
    "( [ ds ] ) , one can easily estimate the electron - vibron coupling as @xmath145 .",
    "polaronic effects are determined by the square of this parameter , which is smaller by a factor @xmath146 then the analogous coupling expected for a short - range hybridization potential .",
    "the origin of such a weak polaronic coupling constant resides in the strongly reduced backscattering processes , since polaronic effects are extremely sensible to that .",
    "then , in transport measurements , where electronic backscattering with a large momentum transfer is expected because of the same order of magnitude of the electron fermi wavelength and the fullerene diameter , the description of the hybridization - induced scattering potential as a long - range potential is not adequate . in this case , short - range approximation ( sections [ spectrum ] and [ transport ] ) is more appropriate for description of polaronic effects .",
    "in conclusion , we have showed that the elastically soft subcomponent of peapods ( fullerene molecules trapped inside a swnt ) can strongly influence low - temperature properties of resonant electron transport through short metallic peapods .",
    "if encapsulated @xmath0 s do modify the electronic structure of metallic nanotubes , ( the effect was already observed for semiconducting peapods @xcite ) , the mechanical degree of freedom associated with fullerene dynamics will influence , via polaronic effects , both the distribution of conductance peak amplitudes and peak spacings as a function of gate voltage . in our model",
    "we considered independent vibrations of individual fullerenes ( a disordered chain of @xmath0 s inside a nanotube ) .",
    "this model predicts strong fluctuations and anomalous low - temperature behavior of coulomb blockade conductance peaks .",
    "such fluctuations have been experimentally observed , @xcite .",
    "one more question remains open , since our hamiltonian , eq .",
    "( [ hamilt ] ) , does not include the effect of the scattering potentials due to the holes on the external shell on the nanotube electrons . in principle",
    ", the scattering of the electrons by these holes should be included .",
    "our approximation , which neglects these effects , is based on two equally important observations .",
    "the first observation is that there is experimental evidence , @xcite , to suggest that electron transport through a peapod in a two - terminal conduction geometry , and in presence of a gate electrode , is ballistic over the entire sample ( whose length is around @xmath147 nm ) . in other words ,",
    "the holes on the nanotube shell do not hinder ballistic electron transport .",
    "the second observation is the following : the inclusion in the model of any topological defects ( holes ) in the tube shell would certainly affect the spectrum of the electrons in the nanotube and the level spacing",
    ". however this would only result in a renormalization of the coupling constant @xmath65 , which in our model is a fitting parameter .",
