    "we show that inflaton necessarily couples to all scalar fields gravitationally through the cosmic expansion .",
    "we explicitly show that , during the inflaton oscillation regime , the hubble parameter and the cosmic scale factor oscillate with ( twice ) a frequency of inflaton .",

    "in such models , the hubble parameter and the scale factor oscillate more violently with time during the inflaton oscillation regime .",

    "note that this is of the same order as the number density found in ref .",
    "@xcite where the particle creation at the transition from the de sitter universe to the matter or radiation dominated universe was studied .",
    "our approach shows that particle creation always occurs in the inflaton - oscillation dominated era and makes it clear and explicit that the gravitational particle production is induced by the inflaton - scalar coupling in the lagrangian .    if @xmath6 is massive ( but much lighter than the inflaton ) and stable , and assuming that its interaction is so weak that they can not be thermalized , its energy density per entropy density is given by @xmath88 where @xmath89 denotes the reheating temperature , which is completed by some other inflaton interaction terms .",
    "if @xmath6 is absolutely stable , this can be one of the production mechanisms of present dark matter .",
    "on the other hand , if @xmath6 is a moduli which decays into standard model particles through planck - suppressed interactions , this is another source of the cosmological moduli problem .    for nearly massless @xmath6 particles such as axion - like particles",
    ", the gravitationally produced @xmath6 particles may contribute to dark radiation .",
    "the energy density of such massless @xmath6 particles , normalized by the radiation energy density , is estimated as @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the hubble parameter at the completion of the reheating .",
    "thus its contribution to the present dark radiation energy density is negligibly small .",
    "one comment is in order .",
    "a scalar particle often obtains a hubble - induced mass through the coupling with ricci scalar @xmath16 or the planck - suppressed interactions with inflaton field .",
    "if such a mass term is absent , i.e. if @xmath6 is nearly massless during inflation , it necessarily develops quantum fluctuations of overhorizon modes which in turn will become a coherent oscillation after inflation , and this may be a dominant contribution to the @xmath6 abundance  @xcite . on the other hand , if @xmath6 obtains a hubble mass during inflation , its quantum fluctuation is suppressed .",
    "however , even in such a case , our production mechanism always works as long as @xmath92 , which in fact many inflation models including new inflation and hybrid inflation satisfy , and this may be a dominant contribution to the @xmath6 abundance . in this sense , the estimate ( [ rhochi ] ) gives a robust lower bound on the @xmath6 abundance unless @xmath6 is conformally coupled to the ricci scalar .",
    "next let us consider gravitational particle production of massless vector bosons and fermions .",
    "in order to see this , we first consider the following action for a massless vector boson : @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the field strength of the vector boson .",
    "if we use the conformal time @xmath58 , the action can be rewritten as @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the metric in the minkowski space - time and the summations are taken over @xmath97 . from this , it is obvious that the massless vector boson does not couple to the scale factor . note that this discussion holds also for non - abelian gauge fields .",
    "the same thing happens for the case of a massless fermion . to see this we consider the following action : @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the spinor field",
    ", @xmath100 is the vierbein and @xmath101 .",
    "here we use the greek letters @xmath102 as the einstein indices and the latin letters @xmath103 as the local lorentz indices .",

    "therefore , the scale factor does not couple to the massless fermion . note that these facts are closely related to the weyl invariance of massless vector bosons and fermions . in other words , this annihilation process is applied to any fields lighter than the inflaton if they are not weyl invariant .",
    "for example , if vector bosons and fermions are massive , they are coupled to the scale factor and hence produced by the inflaton oscillation .",
    "finally , let us see the inflaton - graviton coupling .",
    "the graviton is defined as the transverse - traceless part of the metric perturbation : @xmath111 where @xmath112 satisfies @xmath113 . expressing the two helicity modes by @xmath114@xmath115",
    ", it is known that the equation of motion of the graviton is the same as that of the minimally - coupled massless scalar field .",
    "thus @xmath116 satisfies the same equation as ( [ eqofm_s ] ) .",
    "it means that the graviton production rate is given by @xmath117 the abundance of graviton , or the gravitational wave , is given by eq .",
    "( [ rhodr ] ) .",
    "the present frequency of the gravitational wave is @xmath118 where we have taken the present scale factor to be equal to one .",
    "the present gravitational wave spectrum in terms of @xmath119 has a peak at this frequency and scales as @xmath120 for higher frequencies . around this frequency range ,",
    "the abundance of gravitational wave is typically below the observable level of future space laser interferometers  @xcite .",
    "in the previous section we have shown that , in the einstein gravity , the inflaton necessarily couples to scalar fields and graviton through the @xmath5 dependence of the scale factor , which is proportional to @xmath121 . in this section ,",
    "we discuss particle production in the extended gravity , since it sometimes happens that the hubble parameter as well as the scale factor oscillates more violently  @xcite .",
    "this means that the scale factor linearly depends on @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , we will expand @xmath34 and @xmath42 at the linear order in @xmath5 and neglect @xmath3 dependence in this section .",
    "let us consider the following action : @xmath122 + s_{\\rm m } ,      \\label{s_toy}\\ ] ] where @xmath123 is an arbitrary function of @xmath5 , which can be expanded as @xmath124 here we take @xmath125 without loss of generality by redefining @xmath5 as a deviation from the potential minimum .",
    "let us first consider the homogeneous mode of @xmath5 which undergoes a coherent oscillation around the potential minimum : @xmath126 .",
    "let us compute @xmath5-dependence of the scale factor @xmath42 . from the einstein equation ,",
    "we obtain @xmath127 where @xmath128 and @xmath129 the equation of motion of @xmath5 reads @xmath130 one of these three equations is actually redundant .",
    "it should be noticed that the hubble parameter @xmath34 is an oscillating function with time , as opposed to the case of the einstein gravity . to see this , we expand @xmath34 and @xmath5 as @xmath131 and @xmath132 , where the subscript @xmath133 represents the solution in the einstein gravity limit @xmath134 , and we regard the effect of non - minimal coupling @xmath135 as a small perturbation .",
    "thus we have @xmath136 for @xmath28 .",

    "are of the order of @xmath144 , and are subdominant compared to the first term . thus integrating this equation ,",

    "our finding may be understood as particle production in a time - dependent background in a broad sense . in the context of preheating  @xcite it is well known that the explicit coupling like @xmath225 or @xmath226 leads to efficient particle production .",
    "we emphasize that even if there are no explicit couplings among light particles and the inflaton , they actually couple to each other gravitationally .",
    "more formally , the factor @xmath227 in the action is directly related to the inflaton dynamics through the friedmann equation , which may also be regarded as the constraint equation that connects the metric to the inflaton . in the einstein gravity , the oscillatory behavior of the scale factor is rather mild , but in some extended gravity models , the oscillation might be more drastic so that the gravity - induced couplings are strong enough to complete the reheating .",
    "although in this paper we have considered the inflaton , similar discussions are applied to any coherently - oscillating scalar field , because the scale factor oscillates even if the energy density of the scalar field is subdominant in the universe .",
