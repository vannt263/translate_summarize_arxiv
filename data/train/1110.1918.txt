    "nowadays , it has been prevailing in both experimental and theoretical explorations that quantum coherence effect due to the role of phase in quantum superposition may exist in living processes .",
    "this essentially implies that there may exist quantum coherence effect in chemical reactions in some living processes , such as charge and energy transfer in photosynthesis  @xcite and singlet - and - triplet transition in avian compass  @xcite .",
    "it has long been questioned how migratory birds can navigate to their destination over hundreds of miles .",
    "one of the possible answers is given by the radical pair mechanism  @xcite .",
    "two unpaired electron spins in the radical pair are initially prepared in the singlet state . due to their interactions with the geomagnetic field and their environmental nuclear spins",
    ", the election spins coherently transit between the singlet and triplet states .",
    "since the singlet and triplet states could result in different products of chemical reactions , the direction and magnitude of the geomagnetic field determine the relative yields of two distinct products . by sensing the information incorporated in the final products of the chemical reactions in their retinas",
    ", the birds can find their way to their destination .",
    "therefore , the quantum coherence underlies in the avian compass since the singlet and triplet spin states correspond to different types of quantum entanglement .",
    "ever since it was proposed a decade ago , the radical - pair - mechanism - based avian compass has been in favor by a series of biological and chemical experiments  @xcite .    in this hypothesis ,",
    "the nuclear spins play a crucial role because there would be no coherent transition between the singlet and the triplet states if there were no nuclear spins  @xcite .",
    "previous studies mainly concentrated on the nuclear - spin environment without inter - coupling  @xcite .",
    "mostly recently , by taking into account the inter - coupling of the nuclear spins , we studied a special avian compass model with the nuclear environments modeled by an ising model in a transverse field  @xcite .",
    "the rationality of this model lies in the fact that the weak inter - nuclear - spin coupling is comparable with the zeeman energy splitting induced by the weal geomagnetic field .",
    "it was discovered that the quantum criticality in the environments enhances the sensitivity of magneto - reception . on the other hand , although various master - equation approaches were proposed to deal with such spin - dependent chemical reactions in the avian compass  @xcite , the underlying physical mechanism is still missing in studying the quantum coherence with microscopic models .",
    "thus , it is urgent to propose appropriate microscopic models for different kinds of chemical reactions to make the quantum coherence effect in those processes better understood .",
    "a case in point is the holstein s molecular crystal model , which is also regarded as a microscopic model of chemical reactions with electron transfer ( et )  @xcite .",
    "the holstein model was originally proposed to characterize the vibration - assisted et in one - electron molecular crystal  @xcite . here , in order to describe the chemical reaction of spin dependence as well as direction dependence , the holstein model is generalized to incorporate the degrees of freedom of spin to make electrons naturally interact with a magnetic field . additionally ,",
    "due to the presence of the nuclear - spin environments surrounding the electron spins , there would be coherent transition between the singlet and triplet states of the two electron spins .",
    "in contrast to the previous investigation using anisotropic hyperfine coupling  @xcite , the hyperfine interaction between the electron spin and its nuclear environment is isotropic in our model . based on this generalized model ,",
    "we calculate the chemical reaction rates of the singlet and triplet states of the electron spins . here , the chemical reaction rate is determined by the transition rate of one electron in a localized molecular orbit to another at a distance .",
    "it is discovered that the reaction rate of the triplet state sensitively responses to the variation of the direction of the magnetic field with respect to the polarization of two electron spins . on the contrary ,",
    "the chemical reaction of the singlet state does not demonstrate such dependence on the direction of the magnetic field .",
    "the above results are attributed to the invariance of the singlet state under the rotation of the system around @xmath0-axis , while the triplet one will be changed along with the rotation according to irreducible tensor of @xmath1 group .",
    "therefore , our proposed model may serve as a microscopic origin for the chemical reaction in the avian compass .    in the next section ,",
    "we generalize the holstein model to incorporate the electron spin degrees . in sec .",
    "iii , we consider a general case with an external magnetic field and nuclear - spin environments . in sec .",
    "iv , we study the dynamic evolution of the radical pair and obtain the chemical reaction rates for different initial states .",
    "finally , we summarize our main results in the conclusion . furthermore , we show the detailed calculations for the chemical reaction probability , the chemical reaction rate and the transition probability from the triplet state to the singlet state in appendix a and b respectively .",
    "many chemical reactions are accompanied by et , where the electron is transfered from one site to another ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "a very important but simple quantum - mechanical model for et reactions is the molecular crystal model , which was originally developed by holstein to describe so - called polaron motion in narrow - band conductors  @xcite and then understood as a microscopic model in describing simple chemical reactions @xcite .",
    "the model hamiltonian  @xmath2 is decomposed into two parts , i.e. , the ionic vibration part @xmath3 and the electron - phonon hybrid part @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the displacement of the @xmath6th ion , @xmath7 the harmonic vibration frequency with the reduced mass @xmath8 , @xmath9 the coupling constant of the two molecules , and @xmath10 the fermionic annihilation ( creation ) operator of the electron at molecule @xmath6 with spin @xmath11 .",
    "since the orbital energy @xmath12 is linearized as @xmath13 we explicitly obtain the electronic hamiltonian @xmath14 and the electron - vibration coupling @xmath15 here , the molecular orbital energy @xmath16 is spin - independent . in the next section",
    ", we will consider a more general case with an external magnetic field .",
    "the tunneling integral @xmath17 is assumed to be independent of the displacement @xmath5 and  @xmath18 denotes the electron - vibration coupling , where the term  @xmath19 for @xmath20 is neglected because the molecular orbital energy of the @xmath6th molecule changes negligibly when the displacement of the @xmath21th molecule varies .",
    "for simplicity , we assume two identical molecules , i.e. , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 . choosing coordinates @xmath25 and @xmath26 , we decompose the hamiltonian @xmath27 into two decoupled parts , i.e. , the one for the motion of the center of mass @xmath28 with @xmath29 , and the other for the relative motion    @xmath30    where we have introduced the bosonic operators @xmath31 @xmath32 is the effective frequency .",
    "next , we make the van vleck transformation , also called the polaron transformation  @xcite , @xmath33 for the above generalized holstein model , where @xmath34 is the transformation kernel and @xmath35 thus we can formally decouple the degrees of freedom of electron and vibration , obtaining @xmath36 , with @xmath37 and @xmath38    this molecular crystal hamiltonian  ( [ eq : holstein ] ) describes the et process for a two - local - orbit system . here , we generalize the holstein model by taking into consideration the degrees of freedom of the electron spins . up to now",
    ", the above generalization seems to be trivial , since we could totally separate the spin and orbital degrees of freedom .",
    "however , when a local external magnetic field is applied to the radical pair to form asymmetric couplings to the two electron spins , the spin - orbit coupling is induced . in this case",
    ", a spin - dependent et process takes place .",
    "these asymmetric couplings can also be implemented by coupling to their nuclear - spin environments .",
    "in the previous section , we described the generalized holstein model , with spin degree of freedom . in this section , on account of an external magnetic field and nuclear - spin environments , we investigate how a chemical reaction responses to its magnetic environment .    choosing the polarization direction of the spin state as the @xmath39-direction",
    ", we define the singlet state @xmath40 and triplet state @xmath41 of the electron spins as @xmath42 and @xmath43 respectively with @xmath44 being the vacuum state .",
    "-direction is @xmath45 , and the coordinate system is rotated around the @xmath0-axis with @xmath45 to coincide with the direction of the the magnetic field .",
    "the hyperfine coupling induced interconversion between the singlet and triplet states is modulated by the direction of the magnetic field , i.e. ,  @xmath45.,width=302 ]    in a simple case where the hyperfine couplings are isotropic , the hamiltonian , which describes the interaction between the electron spins and their asymmetric magnetic environments ( the magnetic field plus the nuclear spins ) , reads @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the external geomagnetic field with the inclination angle @xmath45 , @xmath48 the bohr magneton , @xmath49 the pauli operators for @xmath6th electron spin , @xmath50 the pauli operators for @xmath6th nuclear spin , and @xmath51 the hyperfine coupling constant between the @xmath6th electron spin and its environmental nuclear spin .    combining the relative vibration and spin hamiltonians , the total hamiltonian for a spin - dependent et reaction",
    "is obtained @xmath52 . after a rotation around @xmath0-axis with the angle @xmath45 ( fig .",
    "2 ) , combined with the van vleck transformation defined in eq .",
    "( [ van vleck transformation ] ) , we obtain @xmath53 , where the relative vibration hamiltonian @xmath54 is the same as that given in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : holstein]-[holstein1 ] ) , but the hamiltonian of the spin part is changed into      meanwhile , we make the same rotation and transformation for the quantum states of the whole system as in eq .",
    "( [ van vleck transformation ] ) .",
    "straightforwardly , after the combined transformation , the singlet and triplet states read as @xmath56 and latexmath:[\\ ] ] the eigenfunction of @xmath142 is approximated to the first order as @xmath143 with @xmath144 while the eigen energy is obtained to the second order as @xmath145 as a result , the time evolution operator is approximated as @xmath146 neglecting the the second - order terms , we obtain the conversion probability as @xmath147 where the coefficients @xmath148 are listed in table  iii ."
