    "about ten years ago the universal conductance fluctuations ( ucf ) were discovered in mesoscopic , metallic samples@xcite .",
    "the electronic conductance of these samples shows reproducible sample to sample fluctuations .",
    "the fluctuations are called universal because their magnitude is independent of the sample parameters such as the mean free path @xmath0 , and the average conductance @xmath1 .",
    "the dependence on sample dimension is weak .",
    "studies have mainly focused on the variance of the fluctuations , which is the leading and the universal part of the fluctuations .",
    "the conductance being a random variable showing such large fluctuations , one realized that one should consider its full distribution .",
    "it was soon clear that the first higher cumulants of the conductance are proportional to @xcite @xmath2 here the conductance is measured in units of @xmath3 , @xmath4 is the mean conductance at the scale @xmath0 , @xmath5 denotes the ensemble averaging , and the subscript @xmath6 indicates cumulants . in the metallic regime",
    "far from localization , where @xmath7 , the higher cumulants are thus small , and the distribution of the conductance is therefore roughly gaussian . however , for @xmath8 the decrease in magnitude of cumulants as described by eq .",
    "( [ eqglown ] ) is changed into a very rapid increase ( @xmath9 $ ] ) .",
    "this leads to the log - normal tails of the distribution @xcite . with increasing disorder ,",
    "the log - normal tails become more important . although the calculation of the full conductance distribution on the threshold of localization ( @xmath10 ) is today out of reach , it is quite plausible that the whole distribution crosses over to a log - normal shape in the strongly localized regime ( see refs . and",
    "for a discussion ) .",
    "indeed , it is well known that in the strongly localized regime in one dimension the conductance is given by the product of transmission amplitudes , yielding a log - normal distribution @xcite .",
    "although high order cumulants govern the tails of the distribution , they do not affect it near the center .",
    "a deviation from the gaussian distribution near the center should be revealed , first of all , in the lowest nontrivial cumulants .",
    "an important step in this direction was the recent calculation of the third cumulant of the distribution using random matrix theory by macedo @xcite .",
    "he found for the orthogonal ( @xmath11 ) and symplectic ensemble ( @xmath12 ) that the third cumulant of the conductance is proportional to @xmath13 , thus the leading term given by eq .",
    "( 1 ) vanishes ( see for instance ref .   for the definitions of the ensembles ) . for the unitary ensemble ( @xmath14 )",
    "even this sub - leading term vanishes .",
    "the physical reason behind this is not clear .",
    "( we recently learned that the same result in quasi one dimension was found by tartakovski @xcite by the scaling method described in ref .  . )",
    "however , random matrix theory is only valid in quasi one dimensional systems .",
    "therefore , it was not known whether this cancelation is unique to one dimension , or holds also in higher dimensions , which might indicate an overlooked symmetry of the system . that such a possibility exists was also suggested by the fact that the leading - order contribution to the third cumulant of the density of states vanishes in two dimensions @xcite .",
    "the question whether or not the cancelation holds in two and three dimensions was a major motivation for this work .",
    "let us finally mention that related to the conductance distribution , recently third cumulants @xcite and the full distribution functions @xcite of two related transmission quantities were calculated .",
    "these quantities , the speckle transmission and the total transmission , were measured in scattering experiments with electro - magnetic waves ( light and microwaves ) @xcite . in the regime",
    "considered , these distributions are independent of dimension . on a diagrammatic level",
    "this can be understood : the diagrams for the cumulants of the speckle and the total transmission are loop - less diagrams @xcite .",
    "the diagrams for the cumulants of the conductance , however , contain loops , and will therefore be , a priori , dimension dependent . for the electro - magnetic waves",
    "the landauer approach was used , however , for conductance properties this yields the same results as the kubo approach @xcite .",
    "therefore , the calculations presented below are also valid for classical waves .    in the present paper",
    "we will calculate the third cumulant of the conductance for any rectangular geometry in the metallic regime in quasi one , quasi two , and three dimensions . in section [ secucf ]",
    "we review the formalism for calculating conductance fluctuations . in section [ secg3 ] it",
    "is described how the leading diagrams can be found . in section [ seceva ]",
    "we calculate the third cumulant and discuss its dimension dependence . after considering the effects of inelastic scattering",
    ", we end with a conclusion .",
    "in this section we introduce our diagrammatic approach , to a large extent following the detailed paper of lee , stone , and fukuyama @xcite .",
    "we consider a sample with a rectangular geometry with sizes @xmath15 ; the conductance is measured across the z - direction .",
    "the scatterers are isotropic point scatterers .",
    "the scattering is calculated in second order born approximation , which assumes weak scattering .",
    "( the present calculation can be easily extended beyond second order born , this will yield the same results provided the correct mean free path is taken @xcite . )",
    "we consider the metallic , mesoscopic regime , which is characterized by the inequalities @xmath16 , where @xmath17 denotes the fermi wavenumber ; @xmath0 is the mean free path , related to the scatterer density @xmath18 and scatterer strength @xmath19 as @xmath20 .",
    "the relaxation time is given by @xmath21 .",
    "incoherent scattering is first neglected , that is , the incoherence length is much larger than any system size , @xmath22 .",
    "the conductance and its cumulants are calculated with the kubo formula .",
    "the transport through the sample is given by the so called ladder diagrams or diffusons , describing the multiple scattering of the electrons on the scatterers .",
    "in the conductance diagram the field creates an electron - hole pair at a current vertex somewhere in the sample , after some diffuse propagation this pair annihilates .",
    "this diagram thus contains a bubble , the corresponding propagator @xmath23 obeys the diffusion equation : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the diffusion constant .",
    "( correspondence with units often used with classical waves is found by identifying : @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 . )",
    "as mentioned we restrict ourselves to the conductance in the z - direction .",
    "the current is restricted to the z - direction by imposing fully reflecting boundaries in the @xmath30 and @xmath31 direction , and fully conducting boundaries in the @xmath32-direction : @xmath33 and similarly for the @xmath34 dependence . for rectangular geometries",
    "it is useful to write the solution of the diffuson propagator in ( discrete ) momentum space .",
    "following ref .",
    "( in present work there is an extra factor @xmath35 in the diffuson ) , we write the diffuson as @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the momentum vector @xmath38 .",
    "the @xmath39 s are the normalized , orthogonal eigenfunctions @xmath40 note that these eigenfunctions are not properly normalized if @xmath41 or @xmath42 , in which case one has to replace @xmath43 or @xmath44 by @xmath45 .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath46 in eq.([eqltoq ] ) are @xmath47\\ ] ] the longitudinal momentum @xmath48 takes positive integer values ; the transverse momenta @xmath49 and @xmath50 can in addition also be zero .",
    "in quasi two dimensional ( 2d ) geometries one has @xmath51 and only the terms with @xmath41 contribute in the eigenvalues . in quasi one",
    "dimensional ( 1d ) samples also @xmath52 , and @xmath50 is essentially restricted to zero . on the other hand , for very wide geometries @xmath53",
    "becomes a continuous variable and the sum over the @xmath30-variable ( or @xmath31-variable ) becomes an integral .",
    "the average value of the dimension - less conductance @xmath54 is @xmath55 the inverse of this , @xmath56 , will be a small parameter in our diagrammatic expansion .      for the calculation of the second and higher order cumulants of @xmath57",
    ", we need the vertices describing the interference between two diffusons .",
    "these vertices are known as hikami - boxes@xcite .",
    "formally they arise from the spatial derivatives @xmath58 and @xmath59 in the kubo formula for @xmath60 , where the indices @xmath61 label the directions of the incoming and outgoing current .",
    "we have drawn the boxes in fig.[figboxes ] , the corresponding expressions are labeled @xmath62 to @xmath63 , respectively :    @xmath64 , \\\\   h_e&=&4\\pi \\nu \\tau^3 \\frac{\\delta_{\\alpha,\\beta}}{3 } , \\\\ h_f&=&-2\\pi \\nu \\tau^5 \\frac{\\delta_{\\alpha,\\beta}}{3}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the @xmath65 s are the momenta of the diffusons ( the wavy lines ) , as numbered according fig .  [ figboxes ] .",
    "as the conductance is calculated in the z - direction , @xmath66 and @xmath67 are taken @xmath32 .",
    "likewise , only the z - component of the momentum in @xmath68 will be taken into account .",
    "@xmath68 comes in two flavors : @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "@xmath70 has an additional minus sign due to the reversed orientation of the advanced and retarded propagators of the current vertex .",
    "we used that the diffusons vary slowly on length scales of the mean free path , i.e. @xmath71 .",
    "finally , other boxes are sub - leading .      for clarity we briefly present the ucf calculation using this formalism .",
    "the ucf - diagrams are connected diagrams containing two conductivity bubbles and thus four current vertices .",
    "its diagrams are shown in fig .",
    "[ figg2kubo ] .",
    "the ucf diagrams contain two four - boxes ( @xmath62 or @xmath72 ) and two diffusons .",
    "for the orthogonal ensemble the combinatorial factor for the upper diagram is 4 .",
    "the lower diagram has combinatorial factor 2 , and the two hikami vertices bring , comparing eq .",
    "( [ eqhika ] ) to eq .",
    "( [ eqhikb ] ) , an additional factor of @xmath73 .",
    "thus one finds a pre - factor 12 for the sum of all diagrams with respect to a single diagram of the upper topology .",
    "( in the unitary ensemble cooperons do not contribute and this would be a factor 6 . ) for each incoming or outgoing current vertex there is a factor @xmath74 .",
    "it arises from the expression @xmath75 , that can be read off from eq.(2.5 ) in ref .",
    ", and the wavenumber @xmath17 that originates from each derivative in the kubo formula .",
    "next , we use the fourier decomposition of the diffusons eq.([eqltoq ] ) and interchange the sum over the eigenvalues with the spatial integrals . the two diffusons interfering at the hikami - box yield the orthogonality relations : @xmath76 .",
    "one finds @xmath77 in quasi one dimension this yields @xmath78 , which is the well - known result for the ucf in quasi one dimension@xcite .",
    "we now study the third cumulant .",
    "first , we rewrite eq.([eqglown ] ) into a relation for the relative cumulants : @xmath79 .",
    "the inverse power of @xmath54 on the right hand side can be interpreted as the number of hikami four - boxes in the diagrams . thus the third cumulant diagram contains four hikami four - boxes .",
    "indeed , it proves impossible to create @xmath80 diagrams with less boxes .",
    "diagrams with more boxes are sub - leading as they are of higher power of @xmath81 , which is a small parameter . in diagrammatic approaches it is often tricky to find all the relevant diagrams ; already for the much simpler set of ucf diagrams there was considerable discussion in the literature .",
    "we used the following considerations to find the set of diagrams for the third cumulant : the diagrams have six current vertices : three incoming ones and three outgoing ones .",
    "the diagrams contain four 4-point vertices and each vertex has at least two diffusons attached to it , see fig .",
    "[ figboxes ] .",
    "this leaves two possibilities : there are three boxes with each two diffusons and one box with four diffusons ; or , are two boxes with two diffusons and two boxes with three diffusons each .",
    "it is now an easy exercise to see that there are only four possible basic topologies .",
    "they are drawn in fig .",
    "[ figbasictop ] .",
    "the dots represent the 4-point vertices ; the lines represent diffusons .",
    "the next step is to insert the hikami - boxes and connect them in all possible ways to the diffusons .",
    "this yields many diagrams , yet not in all diagrams the outgoing electron - hole pair is the same as the incoming electron - hole pairing .",
    "such diagrams are not the product of three conductance bubbles ; they do not contribute to the @xmath82 process and are left out .",
    "we end up with the diagrams represented in fig .",
    "[ figtop ] . in the figure",
    "there are also diagrams of the same order with one six - box and two four - boxes .",
    "they can be obtained by contracting one diffuson in the diagrams with four - boxes . in physical terms",
    "the six - box diagrams correspond to processes where after an interference process , the amplitudes do not combine into a diffuson .",
    "instead , the amplitudes interact again directly without being scattered .",
    "we calculate the diagrams for quasi-1d , quasi-2d , and 3d geometries .",
    "the calculation goes similar to the ucf - calculation , that is , the sums over the momenta are taken outside the spatial integrals . if two internal diffusons interfere , the spatial integrals bring the orthogonality relations as used for the ucf calculation .",
    "however , two complications arise .",
    "first , at the hikami vertices not only two , also three , or four diffusons interfere ( as is seen from from the figs .  [ figbasictop ] and [ figtop ] ) , this gives more complicated structures .",
    "secondly , hikami - boxes @xmath68 and @xmath83 are @xmath84-dependent , corresponding to spatial derivatives of the diffusons .",
    "we therefore introduce the matrices @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 , which describe the interaction of the diffusons at the vertices .",
    "in the diagrams e.i ) , e.ii ) , e.v ) , and e.vi ) of fig .",
    "[ figtop ] four diffusons , two with momentum @xmath37 , and two with momentum @xmath88 interfere .",
    "the x - components of the diffusons couple as @xmath89\\ ] ] the y - components yield exactly the same integral , see eq.([eqdefq ] ) , and also the z - components yield the same expression",
    ". these diagrams will thus be proportional to @xmath90 .    in most other diagrams three diffusons",
    "interfere at a hikami box @xmath69 , this box brings a derivative @xmath91 .",

    "this confirms the random matrix theory result @xcite diagrammatically .    in higher dimensions",
    "the sums were performed numerically . in the numerical evaluation the sums over three sets of momenta are implicitly reduced to sums over two sets .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the fact that there are only two independent momenta present .",
    "the numerical evaluation remains , however , quite involved as in three dimensions one still has to sum over six variables and the convergence is quite slow .",
    "we find in the orthogonal ensemble for square , and cubic samples , resp .",

    "the third cumulant for wide slabs ( @xmath108 ) is proportional to @xmath109 . in the figures due to the multiplication by @xmath1",
    "there is proportionality to @xmath110 for wide slabs .",
