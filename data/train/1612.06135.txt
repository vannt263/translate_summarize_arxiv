    "the black phosphorus ( bp ) is the most stable form among the many allotropic modifications of phosphorus at room temperature and ambient pressure .",

    "recently there is revival of interest in bp from the prospective of a layered material which allows us to study the exciting properties of a mono and few layers of bp@xcite .",
    "it is found that the band gap depends on the thickness of its film : 0.3ev for thickness @xmath4 and 1.2 ev for single layer thick bp @xcite .",
    "this moderate band gap bridges the gap between the semimetallic graphene @xcite and relatively large band gap of transition metal dichalcogenide ( 1.5 - 2.5ev ) @xcite and makes it ideal for infrared optoelectronic application .",
    "another interesting feature of bp is its anisotropic atomic structure . at ambient pressure ,",

    "[ structure ] .",
    "each phosphorus atom is bonded with two in plane and one out of plane neighboring atoms .",
    "the puckered layers are bound together by weak van der waals interactions . due to this anisotropic atomic structure ,",
    "the effective masses of carriers in bp along arm chair ( ac ) are lightest and that along the layer stacking ( z ) are lighter than that along the zigzag ( zz)@xcite . recent upsurge of interest in layered bp has arisen due to this unique puckered 2-d honeycomb lattice in each phosphorus layer , giving anisotropic electronic@xcite , optical@xcite and vibrational properties@xcite .",
    "further , the direct band gap ( @xmath5 ) of bp arises from the out - of - plane p@xmath6-like orbitals of phosphorus and hence can be strongly modulated by pressure or c - axis strain .",
    "not surprisingly , the effect of pressure was studied on crystal structure and electronic properties in the early work @xcite .",
    "it has anisotropic compressibility : lattice parameters a and c decrease more in comparison with the lattice parameter b with increasing pressure . at room temperature ,",
    "the ambient pressure orthorhombic structure transforms to the rhombohedral structure at p@xmath7 @xmath34.7 gpa and then to the simple cubic structure ( sc ) at p@xmath8 @xmath3 11 gpa@xcite .",
    "these transition pressures are slightly higher if sample is cooled to liquid helium temperature first and then pressure is increased .",
    "the sc phase transforms to a simple hexagonal ( sh ) phase at higher pressure 137 gpa via an intermediate phase@xcite .",

    "al @xcite investigated the crystal structure of black phosphorus up to 280 gpa at room temperature using x - ray - diffraction experiment and found that sh phase goes to the bcc structure at 262 gpa .",
    "the sc phase exhibits superconductivity at 4.7 k@xcite .",
    "the superconducting temperature is slightly pressure dependent and increases with increasing pressure .",
    "the superconducting state remains for several hours even if the pressure is removed .",
    "bp shows superconductivity with high transition temperature ( 10k ) when it is cooled to 4k first and then pressure is applied .",
    "these experiments clearly establish that high pressure can be used to tune the material characteristic of bp significantly .",
    "the electrical conductivity of black p is also very sensitive to pressure @xcite .",
    "two anomalies have been reported at 1.7 and 4.2 gpa , the latter coinciding with the structural phase transition from orthorhombic to rhombohedral structure .",
    "the earlier work @xcite reported that the band gap decreased linearly with a pressure coefficient of @xmath3 0.17 ev/ gpa , closing at p@xmath9 @xmath3 1.5 gpa .",
    "recent magneto - resistance studies @xcite have termed this transition as electronic topological transition ( ett ) from semiconductor to 3d dirc semi - metal due to band crossover near the z - point in the brillouin zone with linear dispersion .",
    "interestingly , a colossal magneto - resistance of @xmath10 is seen at 2gpa at a field of 9 t , similar to 2d weyl semi - metals like wte@xmath11 , making bp as an elemental semi - metal with increased electronic structure .",

    "the role of lattice in pressure - induced electronic topological transition has been evident in softening of an acoustic phonon mode at 1.54 gpa in an earlier inelastic neutron scattering experiment@xcite , where anomalous compressibility and softening of longitudinal ultrasonic wave propagating along c - axis hint the relevance of electron - phonon interaction to pressure induced transitions .",
    "high pressure raman spectroscopy , a sensitive probe of lattice distortion under pressure , has been used in bp up to 13 gpa pressure , displaying changes in the pressure coefficients of raman frequencies of a few modes as well as appearance of new modes at the structural transitions at p@xmath7 @xmath3 4.7 gpa and p@xmath8 @xmath3 10.5 gpa@xcite .",
    "we revisit the high pressure raman studies in this work with two objectives : ( i ) to see the raman signature of electronic topological transition at p@xmath9 ; ( ii ) to extend the pressure range to 24 gpa , and ( iii ) to understand the phonon signatures using first - principles density functional theory ( dft ) .",
    "our main results are ( i ) the linewidths of the first order raman modes go through minimum at the ett near p@xmath9 @xmath3 1.1 gpa ; ( ii ) pressure dependence of phonon frequencies and appearance of new modes confirm the two structural transitions at p@xmath7 @xmath3 4.6 gpa and p@xmath8 @xmath3 11 gpa ; ( iii ) the first order modes b@xmath1 and a@xmath2 show anomalous softening in the rhombohedral phase ; ( iv ) all the three raman modes of the orthorhombic structure vanish above @xmath3 11 gpa in the sc phase ; ( v ) the new modes appearing in the rhombohedra phase show anomalous decrease in frequency with increasing pressure up to 24 gpa ; ( vi ) using first - principles analysis we show that the transition at the lowest pressure is an electronic topological transition to a phase with a strong @xmath15 topology , while the anomalies at higher pressure have a structural origin .",
    "we have also identified the symmetry of new modes observed in rhombohedral phase .",
    "raman measurements were carried out at room temperature in back scattering configuration with micro - optical system equipped with horiba 800 spectrometer , peltier - cooled charge controlled detector and 532 nm diode laser .",

    "we include van der waals ( vdw ) interaction with the parametrization given in grimme scheme @xcite . in self - consistent kohn - sham ( ks ) calculations of configurations of bulk black phosphorous with orthorhombic and rhombohedral unit cell ,",
    "the brillouin zone ( bz ) integrations were sampled with a uniform mesh of 18x16x16 and 16x16x16 k - points respectively , and 32x32x32 mesh of k - points was used in calculation of electron - phonon coupling of both the structural forms .",
    "phonon spectra and dynamical matrices at @xmath19-point ( q= ( 0 , 0 , 0 ) ) as a function of lattice constant ( or pressure ) were determined using density functional linear response as implemented in quantum espresso(qe)@xcite , which employs the green s function method to avoid explicit calculations of unoccupied khon - sham states .",
