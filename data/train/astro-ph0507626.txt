    "the so - called `` 21@xmath0 feature '' has been identified in 12 proto - planetary nebulae ( ppne ; kwok , volk , & hrivnak 1999 ) ( and arguably also in in 2 planetary nebulae [ pne ] associated with wolf - rayel central stars [ hony , waters , & tielens 2001 ] and in 2 highly evolved carbon stars [ volk , xiong , & kwok 2000 ] ) since its first detection in 1989 ( kwok et al .",
    "this feature has a similar spectral shape and peaks at the same wavelength ( @xmath120.1@xmath0 ) in all sources .",
    "the 21@xmath0-feature sources have quite uniform properties : they are mostly metal - poor , carbon - rich f and g supergiants with infrared excesses and overabundant s - process elements ( see kwok et al .  1999 ) .",
    "the origin of this feature , however , is still a mystery .",
    "a large number of candidate carriers have been proposed in the past decade , including hydrogenated fullerenes , polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon , hydrogenated amorphous carbon , diamonds , synthetic carbonaceous macromolecules , amides ( thiourea or urea @xmath2_2}$ ] ) , iron oxides ( such as fe@xmath3o@xmath4 or fe@xmath4o@xmath5 ) , sis@xmath3 , oxygen - bearing side groups in coal ( see kwok et al .  1999 ,",
    "andersen , posch , & mutschke 2005 and references therein ) , and more recently titanium carbide ( tic ) nanoclusters ( von helden et al .",
    "2000 ) , stochastically - heated silicon core - sio@xmath3 mantle nanograins ( smith & witt 2002 ; li & draine 2002 ) , doped sic ( speck & hofmeister 2004 ) , sic core - sio@xmath3 mantle grains and iron monoxide feo ( posch , mutschke , & andersen 2004 ) .    among these candidates ,",
    "tic nanograins have recently received much attention , because ( 1 ) laboratory spectra of tic nano - crystals exhibits a distinct feature at @xmath6  20.1@xmath0 , closely resembling the astronomical 21@xmath0 emission feature both in peak position and width and in spectral details ( von helden et al .",
    "2000 ) , although bulk tic does not show any noticeable feature near 20.1@xmath0 ( henning & mutschke 2000 ) ; ( 2 ) presolar tic grains are identified in primitive meteorites as nanometer - sized inclusions embedded in micrometer - sized presolar graphite grains ( bernatowicz et al .",
    "however , the tic model has been challenged by hony et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , chigai et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , and li ( 2003 ) . and",
    "11.3@xmath0 bands , the ti / si abundance ratio must be at least 5 times larger than the solar abundance ratio .",
    "one may argue that the arguments of hony et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and chigai et al .",
    "( 2003 ) do not readily rule out the tic hypothesis because ( 1 ) as a consequence of the so - called _ electron mean free path limitation _ effect , the imaginary parts of the dielectric functions of small metallic grains ( and therefore their optical / uv absorptivities ) are expected to be larger than those of their bulk counterparts ( see li 2004 ) ; ( 2 ) there is no reason to compare the solar ti / si abundance ratio with that of the 21@xmath0-feature sources .",
    "however , applying the kramers - kronig physical principle to the tic hypothesis , li ( 2003 ) readily ruled out the tic model because it was found that this model requires at least 50 times more tic mass than available , no matter how strong the uv / optical absorptivity of nano tic is . ]    more recently , sic seems to be an attractive candidate for the 21@xmath0 feature carrier : speck & hofmeister ( 2004 ) reported the experimental finding that sic , under certain circumstances , not only shows the well - known resonance feature at @xmath111.3@xmath0 , but also a secondary band which is centered at 2021@xmath0 .",
    "this secondary band was reported to appear only in the @xmath7-polytype , and nitrogen or carbon impurities were suspected to favor its occurrence .",
    "this hypothesis gains strength from the fact that ( 1 ) both silicon and carbon are abundant elements ; and ( 2 ) sic is a common dust species in c - rich circumstellar envelopes . due to the astrophysical significance of sic dust , it deserves a more thorough investigation . in this _ letter _ , we aim at investigating whether doped - sic can be a suitable carrier for the mysterious 21@xmath0 feature by comparing the model - predicted flux ratio of the 21@xmath0 feature to the 11.3@xmath0 feature with observed .",
    "as early as 1933 wildt had already suggested that sic grains might form in the cool atmospheres of n - type stars .",
    "this suggestion was confirmed 36 years later when gilman ( 1969 ) and friedemann ( 1969 ) performed thermodynamical equilibrium calculations and found that sic grains could condense in carbon stars .",
    "the presence of circumstellar sic grains was first revealed by the detection of an emission feature at 11.5@xmath0 in some carbon stars which was first attributed to sic dust by gilra ( 1972 ) .",
    "the detection of this feature and its identification as sic were confirmed by subsequent observations and interpretations ( treffers & cohen 1974 ; merrill & stein 1976 ; goebel et al .  1980 ; little - marenin 1986 ; goebel , chesseman , & gerbaut 1995 ; speck , barlow , & skinner 1997 ) .",
    "the formation of sic dust in carbon stars has also been indicated by the identification of presolar sic grains in primitive meteorites based on their isotopic anomalies ( bernatowicz et al .",
    "1987 ) .",
    "sic has @xmath170 polytypes , which can be divided into 2 general crystallographic types : cubic ( @xmath7 ) and hexagonal ( @xmath8 ) . while presolar sic grains were predominantly found to have a cubic lattice structure ( i.e. @xmath7 ; daulton et al .",
    "2003 ) , the 11.3@xmath0 emission feature observed for carbon - rich agb stars is best fitted by laboratory spectra of @xmath8 ( baron et al .",
    "speck , hofmeister , & barlow ( 1999 ) suggested that this discrepancy ( between meteoritic and astronomical identifications of the sic type ) is caused by the `` inappropriate ` kbr corrections ' made to laboratory spectra of sic taken using the kbr matrix method '' ; they argued that the carrier of the 11.3@xmath0 feature seen in carbon stars is actually @xmath7 ( instead of @xmath8 ) .",
    "more recently , clment et al .  ( 2003 ) found that the laboratory spectra of matrix - isolated @xmath7 nanoparticles perfectly match the astronomical 11.3@xmath0 feature .",
    "but mutschke et al .",
    "( 1999 ) argued that the 11.3@xmath0 emission feature itself is not a powerful discriminator of the sic crystal type ( also see papoular et al .",
    "1998 ) .    therefore , in this work we will consider both two types of sic grains .",
    "we approximate the grains as spherical feature and the 21@xmath0 feature will be significantly broadened .",
    "but since at these wavelength ranges micron or submicron - sized sic grains are in the rayleigh regime , the broadening effect is unlikely to differ much from one feature to another . therefore , it is sufficient to just consider spherical grains . ] and use mie theory to calculate their absorption and scattering properties .",
    "the complex index of refraction @xmath9 of @xmath8 is taken from laor & draine ( 1993 ) . ) in the 11.3@xmath0 wavelength range on those of spitzer , kleinman , & walsh ( 1959 ) , but broadened by a factor of @xmath116.7 .",
    "in addition , they introduced a `` continuum '' by adding a highly damped oscillator . ] for @xmath7 , adachi ( 1999 ) compiled the refractive indices recently determined by various groups in the wavelength range of @xmath10 , except there was no @xmath11 data for @xmath12 .",
    "largely based on the data compiled by adachi ( 1999 ) , we take the following `` synthetic '' approach : for @xmath13 , we take the imaginary parts of the refractive indices @xmath11 from laor & draine ( 1993 ) ; and @xmath7 should not differ much since they just depend on the atomic absorption cross sections of the constituent atoms and they are not sensitive to the exact crystal structure . ] for @xmath14 and @xmath15 , we take @xmath11 from adachi ( 1999 ) ; for @xmath12 , extrapolation is made from that of adachi ( 1999 ) at @xmath16 ; for @xmath17 , we assume @xmath18 .",
    "after smoothly joining the adopted @xmath11 , we calculate the real part @xmath19 from @xmath11 through the kramers - kronig relation ( bohren & huffman 1983 ) .",
    "if sic grains are indeed the carrier of the observed 21@xmath0 feature , they must have a resonance at this wavelength and we should include its contribution to their dielectric functions .",
    "we approximate this contribution in terms of a single lorentz oscillator @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the angular frequency ( @xmath22 is the speed of light ) , @xmath23 is the angular frequency of the transverse optical mode , @xmath24 is the damping constant ( @xmath25 and @xmath26 are respectively the peak wavelength and the fwhm of the 21@xmath0 feature ) , and @xmath27 is the plasma frequency . for spherical grains in the rayleigh regime , the parameters @xmath27 and @xmath23 can be determined from the feature strength @xmath28 ( bohren & huffman 1983 ) is the absorption efficiency at @xmath29 and @xmath30 is the grain radius . for grains in the rayleigh approximation ( i.e. @xmath31 ) , @xmath32 is independent of @xmath30 , where @xmath33 is the mass density of sic and @xmath34 is the mass absorption coefficient of sic at 20.1@xmath0 . in this work ,",
    "@xmath35 is treated as a free parameter . ]",
    "@xmath36^{1/2 } \\left[\\epsilon(\\infty)+2\\right ] ~~,\\ ] ] @xmath37^{1/2}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 is the dielectric function at @xmath39 : @xmath40 for @xmath8 ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "unfortunately , speck & hofmeister ( 2004 ) did not measure the absolute strength of the 21@xmath0 feature @xmath28 for their sic samples .",
    "we therefore treat @xmath28 as a free parameter : for a given @xmath28 value , we calculate the contribution of the 21@xmath0 feature to the dielectric functions of sic from eqs.([eq : epsilon],[eq : omegap],[eq : omega0 ] ) and add this component to the dielectric functions of laor & draine ( 1993 ) for @xmath8 and those described early in this section for @xmath7 .",
    "resonance ( see eq.[[eq : epsilon ] ] ) guarantees that the new dielectric functions also satisfy the kramers - kronig relation ( see bohren & huffman 1983 ) . ] for illustrative purpose , in figure [ fig : nk ] we plot the refractive indices of @xmath8 and @xmath7 with @xmath41 .",
    "the 21@xmath0 sources all have a weak emission feature at 11.3@xmath0 , which is commonly attributed to pahs ( see kwok et al .",
    "1999 ) . assuming that all the power from the 11.3@xmath0 feature is emitted by sic grains",
    ", one can place constraints on the size and the 21@xmath0 feature strength @xmath28 of sic dust by comparing the power emitted from the 11.3@xmath0 feature with that emitted from the 21@xmath0 feature . for this purpose ,",
    "we take hd56126 ( for which the dust and gas spatial distributions are well constrained ; see hony et al .  2003 ,",
    "meixner et al .",
    "2004 , hrivnak & bieging 2005 ) as a testing example .",
    "hd56126 ( iras07134 + 1005 ) , a bright post - agb star with a spectral type of f0 - 5i , is one of the four 21@xmath0 sources originally discovered by kwok et al .",
    "( 1989 ) and remains the best - studied 21@xmath0 source .",
    "the total power emitted from the 11.3@xmath0 feature and from the 21@xmath0 feature are respectively @xmath42 and @xmath43 ( hony et al .",
    "now the question is , with what grain size and what @xmath28 for the 21@xmath0 feature one can achieve @xmath44 ?",
    "apparently , the observational requirement of @xmath44 is best met if the grains are cold ( say , with an equilibrium temperature @xmath1150@xmath45 ) and have a large 21@xmath0 feature strength @xmath28 . since the further the grains are away from the central illuminating star , the colder the grains are , we just need to consider how cold sic dust can be at the outer edge of the dusty envelope around hd56126 . on the other hand , @xmath28 for the 21@xmath0 feature",
    "can not be arbitrarily large ",
    "it should not be inconsistent with laboratory measurements ( e.g. see fig.1 in speck & hofmeister 2004 ) .",
    "the equilibrium temperature of a sic grain of spherical radius @xmath30 at the the outer edge of the dust envelope around hd56126 can be determined by balancing absorption and emission @xmath46\\right)d\\lambda\\ ] ] where @xmath47 is the stellar radius ( @xmath48 is the solar radius ) ; @xmath49 is the distance from the central star to the outer edge of the dust envelope ( hony et al .",
    "2003 ) ; @xmath50 is the absorption cross section of sic dust of size @xmath30 at wavelength @xmath51 ; @xmath52 is the equilibrium temperature of dust of size @xmath30 at @xmath53 ; @xmath54 is the flux per unit wavelength ( @xmath55 ) at the top of the illuminating star s atmosphere which is approximated by the kurucz ( 1979 ) model atmospheric spectrum with @xmath56 and @xmath57 ; and @xmath58 is the dust extinction which is represented by the milky way standard extinction law with @xmath59 ( hony et al .",
    "2003 ) . for a sic grain of a given size @xmath30 and a given 21@xmath0 feature strength @xmath28",
    ", we calculate its equilibrium temperature from eq.([eq : t ] ) and its emission spectrum and then calculate @xmath60  the ratio of the amount of energy emitted from the 11.3@xmath0 feature to that from the 21@xmath0 feature .    in figure",
    "[ fig : asic ] we plot the emission spectra of @xmath8 grains of sizes @xmath61 , 0.05 , 0.1 , 0.5 and 1.0@xmath0 with @xmath62 for the 21@xmath0 feature .",
    "it is seen that even if one assumes @xmath63 , the calculated @xmath60 ratio ( @xmath64 for @xmath65 and @xmath66 for @xmath67 ) is still much larger than the observed ratio of @xmath60@xmath680.012.@xmath680.012 is already a very generous upper limit since we have attributed the entire 11.3@xmath0 emission to sic , while actually this emission must at least partly originate from pahs . ] in order to be consistent with the observation , one requires @xmath69 .",
    "this seems unlikely since the required strength for the 21@xmath0 feature is stronger than that for the 11.3@xmath0 feature of @xmath8 which is only @xmath70 .",
    "samples of speck & hofmeister ( 2004 ) , the 21@xmath0 resonance is far weaker than the 11.3@xmath0 resonance for both bulk and nano materials . ]",
    "similar results are obtained for @xmath7 ( see fig.[fig : bsic ] ) .",
    "band , @xmath7 appears to have another sharp band at @xmath112.6@xmath0 .",
    "this is caused by the asymmetrical nature of its index of refraction ( adachi 1999 ; see fig.[fig : nk]d ) . if we approximate the 11.3@xmath0 resonance by a lorentz oscillator , the secondary peak at @xmath112.6@xmath0 would disappear .",
    "but this does not affect our conclusion since we are considering the total power emitted in these features , rather than their peak heights . ]",
    "in  [ sec : rst ] we only consider grains large enough to attain an equilibrium temperature . for small grains with @xmath30@xmath68100@xmath71 , they will undergo single - photon heating : upon absorption of an energetic photon , they will be heated to a temperature which is higher than their equilibrium temperature , and most of the photon energy will be radiated away at this high temperature .",
    "therefore , the emission spectrum of a stochastically - heated grain peaks at shorter wavelengths than that calculated from its equilibrium temperature ( see draine & li 2001 ) .",
    "we thus would expect larger ratios of @xmath60 for small grains undergoing single - photon heating than those considered above , making things even worse .    however , it is still premature to rule out the sic hypothesis since the mid - ir spectra of doped sic samples of speck & hofmeister ( 2004 ) were obtained at _ room temperature _ for sic with a limited fraction of c impurity . while it is unclear how and to what degree temperatures will affect the 11.3@xmath0 and 21@xmath0 features of sic , it is known that the mid - ir spectra of silicates are affected by the sample temperature ( see bowey et al .",
    "moreover , recent experimental results have shown that the strength of the 21@xmath0 feature increases as the impurity content increases ( kimura et al .  2005a , b ) .",
    "the required 21@xmath0 feature strength ( see  [ sec : rst ] ) might be attainable by sic dust with a rather high level of impurity .",
    "laboratory measurements of the mid - ir spectra of heavily doped sic samples are urgently needed .",
    "finally , we note that there are over 700 c - rich agb stars known to show the 11.3@xmath0 sic feature from the iras ( _ infrared astronomical satellite _ ) lrs ( _ low resolution spectrometer _ ) survey , but none of these stars show the 21@xmath0 feature , suggesting that the amount of impurity incorporated into sic dust must be environment dependent ( e.g. the si / c ratio , speck & hofmeister 2004 ) , if doped sic is indeed the carrier of the 21@xmath0 feature .    in summary",
    ", we have examined the recent hypothesis of doped - sic as the carrier of the mysterious 21@xmath0 emission feature detected in 12 ppne .",
    "it is found that doped sic grains have to have a resonance at @xmath121@xmath0 too strong to be consistent with current laboratory measurements , in order for the model - predicted flux ratios of the 11.3@xmath0 feature to the 21@xmath0 feature not in conflict with the observed values .",
    "admittedly , it is still premature to discard the sic hypothesis since recent experimental results have shown that the strength of the 21@xmath0 resonance of doped sic appears to increases with the c impurity content , suggesting that heavily doped sic may be able to produce a sufficiently strong 21@xmath0 resonance .",
    "we call on laboratory measurements of the mid - ir spectra of sic with high levels of c impurity .",
