    "eugene wigner introduced random matrix models about fifty years ago into nuclear physics @xcite .",
    "the scope of applications has increased over the years @xcite including fields such as molecular and atomic physics , mesoscopics and field theory .",
    "more recently random matrix theory has started to be used in quantum information theory @xcite . for an introduction to such applications",
    "see @xcite .",
    "there the concept of individual qubits and their interactions becomes important .",
    "this implies that we enter the field of two - body random ensembles ( tbre ) @xcite , i.e. ensembles of hamiltonians of @xmath0-body systems interacting by two - body forces .",
    "while such ensembles have received considerable attention , it was first focussed on fermions and later also included bosons . yet in quantum information theory the qubits are taken to be distinguishable , and indeed the same holds for spintronics .",
    "interest in both fields has sharply increased recently @xcite .",
    "it is thus very pertinent to formulate and investigate tbre s for distinguishable qubits . as random matrix ensembles",
    "are mainly determined by their symmetry properties this ensemble will be very different from other tbre s .",
    "in particular , as the particles are distinguishable , their interaction can vary from particle pair to particle pair and can indeed be randomly distributed , thus introducing an entirely new aspect .",
    "this has the consequence that the topology according to which spins or qubits are distributed or interact will be important , thus chains , trees and crystals of particles with nearest , second nearest and up to @xmath1th order interaction can be represented .",
    "as mentioned above , random matrix ensembles are usually basically defined by the invariance group of their measure and , if that is not enough , some minimal information conditions @xcite or independence condition @xcite . note that we deal with a symmetry of the ensemble , rather than with a symmetry of individual systems .",
    "the two concepts are to some degree complementary , and the former has also been called _ structural invariance_. we propose an adequate definition for such ensembles in a very general framework in terms of independent gaussian distributed variables .",
    "we then give an alternate representation in terms of the invariance group and variables that determine the orbits of the hamiltonian on the ensemble under the action of the group .    in order to show the relevance of the new ensemble we address the simplest possible topology , namely the chain with nearest neighbour interactions .",
    "for this system we focus on the ensemble averaged structure of the ground state and demonstrate the existence of an unusual quantum phase transition @xcite , which is triggered by breaking of _ time - reversal invariance _ ( tri ) .",
    "entanglement , a key resource of quantum many - body systems in terms of quantum information , is to large extent related to quantum correlations , localization properties and quantum chaos .",
    "entanglement has also been used as a property , alternative to long - range order in spatial correlation functions , to describe systems undergoing a quantum phase transition @xcite . in one - dimensional systems such as quantum spin chains ,",
    "it was shown @xcite that the entanglement entropy of the ground state typically saturates or diverges logarithmically with size when approaching the thermodynamic limit .",
    "furthermore , it has been shown that logarithmic divergence implies quantum criticality .",
    "interesting results emerge when a spatially homogeneous spin model is replaced by its disordered counterpart , where the spin interactions are taken at random . in this case",
    "there is often no physical justification why random interactions should still obey specific restricted forms such as ising or heisenberg interactions . in this context ,",
    "we argue , it is more natural to use two - spin random ensembles ( tsre ) for distinguishable particles , specifically choosing quantum spins @xmath2 , though these ensembles can readily be generalized to arbitrary spin . by construction these ensembles , as given in section [ sec : def ] , are invariant with respect to arbitrary local rotations , which we may view as gauge transformations .",
    "another physical motivation for the definition of such ensembles is the coupling among arbitrary and perhaps mutually independent two level quantum systems which may come from completely different physical contexts such as e.g. two - level atoms , josephson junctions and photons .    in section [ sec : results ] we concentrate on one - dimensional systems or spin chains and present results of numerical calculations , mainly based on density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) @xcite , in which we investigate entanglement and correlation properties of the ground state , averaged over an ensemble , and the average spectral gap to the first excited state as well as its fluctuations .",
    "if we include the interaction with an external random magnetic field , and hence tri is broken , we find fast decay of correlations , saturation of entanglement entropy , and power law decay @xmath3 of the spectral gap @xmath4 with the system size @xmath5 while its distribution displays wigner - type level repulsion .",
    "when the strength of external field goes to zero , and time - reversal invariance is restored , we find long range order , logarithmically divergent entanglement entropy , and _ exponential _ decay of the spectral gap , while the level repulsion disappears .",
    "we argue that this quantum phase transition is non - conventional from the point of view of established models , since in what we shall call non - critical case we still find slow power law closing of the spectral gap .",
    "in this section we define the two - spin random ensembles of hamiltonians for systems with @xmath5 distinguishable spins or qubits with at most two body interactions and describe its basic ( invariance ) properties .",
    "if we do not allow all spins to interact , we have to define which ones do .",
    "the simplest case will be a chain with nearest neighbour interactions , but in general we need a graph , whose vertices correspond to spins and whose edges correspond to two - body interactions . we proceed to formalize this .",
    "let @xmath6 be an _ undirected graph _ with a finite set of @xmath5 _ vertices _ @xmath7 and a set of @xmath8 _ edges _ @xmath9 .",
    "in addition , let @xmath10 and @xmath11 be two non - negative functions defined on the sets of vertices and edges , respectively .",
    "to such a graph we assign a @xmath12 dimensional hilbert space of @xmath5 spins or qubits , placed at its vertices @xmath13 , and a set of @xmath5 pauli operators @xmath14 satisfying @xmath15 commutation relations @xmath16= { { \\rm i } } \\varepsilon_{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma}\\sigma^\\gamma_j \\delta_{j , k}$ ] .",
    "we also use the notation @xmath17 .",
    "let @xmath18 , @xmath19 , be a set of @xmath8 _ random _ real @xmath20 matrices , and @xmath21 , @xmath22 , be a set of @xmath5 _ random",
    "_ @xmath23 dimensional real vectors .",
    "the tsre then consists of the _ random _ hamiltonians @xmath24 the above defined functions on the edges and vertices of the graph are used to determine the average strength of the corresponding terms in the hamiltonian .",
    "the distribution of random two - body interaction matrices ( for short also _ bond matrices _ ) @xmath25 and the random external field vectors @xmath26 shall be uniquely determined by requiring the following two conditions : _ maximum local invariance _ and _ maximum independence _ expressed formally as :    1 .",
    "an ensemble of hamiltonians ( [ eq : h ] ) should be invariant with respect to an arbitrary _ local _ @xmath15 transformation , namely @xmath27 where @xmath28 , @xmath29 , meaning that the choice of local coordinate system is arbitrary for each spin / qubit . obviously , ( [ eq : can ] ) preserves the canonical commutation relations for the pauli operators",
    ". then it follows immediately that the _ joint probability distributions _ of @xmath30 should be invariant with respect to transformations @xmath31 where @xmath32 are arbitrary independent @xmath15 rotations for each @xmath33 .",
    "2 .   the matrix elements of the tensors @xmath34 and of the vectors @xmath35 should be _ independent _ random variables .    following arguments similar to those presented in @xcite it is straightforward to show that , in order to satisfy conditions ( i ) and ( ii ) above for pre - determined but general strengths of bonds @xmath36 and external fields @xmath37 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 should be _ gaussian independent random variables _ of zero mean and equal variance , which are uniquely specified in terms of the correlators @xmath38 where @xmath39 denotes an ensemble average .",
    "we abbreviate the ensemble defined in this way by @xmath40 noting that it depends on the graph and the strength functions @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "let us now describe some other elementary properties of tsre .",
    "we have seen that each member @xmath43 of @xmath40 can be parametrized ( [ eq : h ] ) by @xmath44 independent random parameters .",
    "however , we know for the classical ensembles , that a parametrization in terms of the structural invariance group , i.e. the invariance group of the ensemble and the remaining parameters is very useful . similarly in the present case for an arbitrary set of local @xmath15 rotations @xmath45 , the transformation of the parameters @xmath46 preserves the spectrum and all entanglement properties of @xmath43 . in fact , the transformation ( [ eq : gauge ] ) can be considered as _ a gauge transformation _ since , composed with the local canonical transformation ( [ eq : can ] ) , it preserves the hamiltonian @xmath43 ( [ eq : h ] ) exactly .",
    "two hamiltonians , specified by @xmath47 and @xmath48 , can thus be considered equivalent , and the gauge transformation ( [ eq : gauge ] ) defines a natural equivalence relation in @xmath40 .",
    "therefore , it may be of interest to consider a simplest parametrization of the set of equivalence classes , or in other words the orbits of a hamiltonian on the ensemble under the structural invariance transformations .",
    "we thus ask , what is a general _ canonical form _ to which each element @xmath43 can be brought by gauge transformations ( [ eq : gauge ] ) and how can it be parametrized ?",
    "let the integer @xmath49 denote the number of such parameters .",
    "the equivalent question for the classical ensembles leads to the eigenvalues as canonical parameters , since there the structural invariance group is much bigger .",
    "let us first consider the simplest connected graph , namely an open one dimensional ( 1d ) chain of @xmath5 vertices @xmath50 and @xmath51 bonds .",
    "there it turns out that the matrices @xmath52 can be simultaneously _ symmetrized _ , namely all @xmath53^t$ ] , by choosing the following gauge transformation @xmath54^t\\ ] ] and where @xmath55^t ,   \\label{eq : svd}\\ ] ] is a standard canonical singular value decomposition ( svd ) of the original bond matrix @xmath52 , with @xmath56 and @xmath57 diagonal matrices of singular values .",
    "since the initial transformation @xmath58 is still free , we can choose it such @xmath59 that the first bond matrix is even _",
    "diagonalized _ , @xmath60 .",
    "this symmetrization is unique provided that singular values of all svd s ( [ eq : svd ] ) are non - degenerate which is the case for a generic member @xmath43 .",
    "thus the number of parameters specifying the bond matrices is @xmath61 and in addition to @xmath62 external field parameters this gives @xmath63 independent parameters .",
    "we recover the original set of parameters if we add the @xmath62 parameters of the group of local rotations .",
    "second , we consider the case of a ring graph with @xmath5 vertices and @xmath64 bonds , which is obtained from the previous case by specifying the periodic boundary condition @xmath65 .",
    "we see that a general @xmath43 as given in ( [ eq : h ] ) can now be symmetrized only if the additional topological condition @xmath66 is satisfied . now all but one bond matrix can be symmetrized , for example the last one may in addition be multiplied by a topological rotation @xmath67 leading to three additional parameters .",
    "therefore in the case of a ring graph we have @xmath68 independent parameters ; again adding the @xmath69 parameters of the local rotations we obtain the full set of parameters .",
    "we can now consider the case of a general ( connected ) graph . from the previous examples",
    "it is evident that the only crucial additional parameter is the number @xmath70 of _ primitive _ cycles , i.e. such cycles which can not be decomposed into other primitive cycles .",
    "it is clear that each primitive cycle adds @xmath23 additional topological parameters ( or one @xmath15 topological @xmath71 matrix ) to the @xmath72 parameters which we would have for the case of a _ tree _ graph .",
    "therefore we have @xmath73 counting the cycle - contributions and taking the primitivity criterion into account again we obtain the the total number of parameters by adding those of the local rotations .",
    "the above considerations hold for the case of general bond and vertex strength functions @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "if , however , these functions are degenerate , or even constant , i.e. the average interaction strength and field strength do not depend on edges / vertices of the graph , then the structural invariance group of the tsre may be even larger . in the latter case",
    "this group is obtained as a semi - direct product of a _ discrete symmetry group _ of the graph @xmath74 and the gauge group of local rotations , the latter being the normal subgroup .",
    "we hope that the considerable invariance properties of the tsre will prove useful in a future analytical treatment of its properties .",
    "in this section we shall only consider the simplest case of a tsre on a 1d chain of @xmath5 vertices .",
    "in addition , we consider the most symmetric case of constant strength functions , say @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "such an ensemble of random spin chain hamiltonians @xmath77 shall be designated as @xmath78 where we explicitly assume open boundary conditions ; we shall , however , also consider a ring graph with periodic boundary conditions in which case we shall stress this separately . in particular we shall be interested in the zero temperature ( ground state ) properties of @xmath78 .",
    "we note that due to the large co - dimension of bond strength space the standard perturbative renormalization group of decimating the strongest bonds @xcite would not work and we have at this point to rely on a brute numerical investigation .",
    "still , it turns out that most zero temperature properties of @xmath78 can be efficiently simulated using white s density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) finite - size algorithm @xcite by which spin chains of sizes up to @xmath79 could at present be achieved .",
    "one should not forget that all numerical estimates of _ ensemble average _ or expectation value of some physical quantity @xmath80 , which will be designated as @xmath81 , require averaging over many , say @xmath82 , realizations from @xmath78 , such that the statistical error estimated as @xmath83 is sufficiently small .",
    "due to the lack of translational invariance the implementation of the dmrg is non - trivial and was only done for a chain with open boundaries .",
    "we note that for @xmath84 , any @xmath43 as defined in ( [ eq : h1 ] ) , or even more generally in ( [ eq : h ] ) , commutes with the following anti - unitary _ time - reversal _",
    "operation @xmath85 so , for _ odd _",
    "@xmath5 , all eigenvalues of @xmath43 have to be doubly degenerate ( kramer s degeneracy @xcite ) .",
    "however , as this represents more a technical than conceptual problem for the ground state ( or ground plane ) properties of @xmath78 we shall in the following restrict ourselves to the case of _ even _ @xmath5 .",
    "let @xmath86 , represent the ground state , and the first excited state , of @xmath43 , with eigenenergies @xmath87 , and @xmath88 , respectively .",
    "it is well known that the crucial quantity which determines the rate of relaxation of zero - temperature quantum dynamics is the spectral gap @xmath89 .    to clarify the difference with respect to tri",
    ", we plot the normalized gap distribution @xmath90 where @xmath91 for both cases , together with the theoretical level spacing distributions for the gaussian unitary ensemble ( gue ) of random matrices @xcite and for an uncorrelated poissonian spectrum ( fig .  [ fig:1 ] ) . for the non - tri case",
    "we choose @xmath92 and observe , to our accuracy , good agreement with the gue case for two chain sizes @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "our results suggest that the gue - like gap distribution , exhibiting level repulsion , also holds in the thermodynamic limit @xmath95 ; numerical results for odd @xmath5 give the same results . in the case of @xmath84",
    "the level repulsion between @xmath96 and @xmath97 gradually vanishes as we approach the thermodynamic limit , although no conclusive statement can be made about the limiting distribution . for odd @xmath5 , the ground state is degenerate for @xmath84 and the present analysis does not apply .",
    "being interested in the thermodynamic limit , it is an important issue to understand how @xmath98 scales with @xmath5 . the theory of quantum criticality @xcite states that @xmath4 remains finite in the thermodynamic limit for _ non - critical systems _ , and rapidly converges to zero , as @xmath95 for _ critical _ systems .    in fig.[fig:2 ]",
    "we plot the ensemble averaged spectral gap @xmath99 versus @xmath5 for different values of the field strength @xmath42 .",
    "we find a clear indication that in the non - tri case the spectral gap exhibits universal asymptotic power law scaling @xmath100 whereas in the tri case , @xmath84 , the asymptotic decay of the gap is _ faster than a power law _ , perhaps exponential @xmath101 , with @xmath102 .",
    "according to the standard theory @xcite both cases , @xmath103 and @xmath104 , should be classified as quantum critical , however as we shall see later , the case of slow power - law decaying average gap ( [ eq : powerlaw ] ) has many - features of non - critical systems , such as finite correlation length and finite ( saturated ) entanglement entropy .",
    "therefore we shall , at least for the purposes of the present paper , name the case @xmath105 as _ random non - critical _ ( rnc ) and the case @xmath104 as _ random critical _ ( rc ) .",
    "we note that the results for odd and even @xmath5 are in agreement in the rnc case .",
    "also results for the case with periodic boundary conditions up to @xmath106 show no significant difference from the results in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] for any @xmath42 .",
    "the second characteristics of quantum phase transitions we choose to investigate in the @xmath78 , is the entanglement entropy of a symmetric bi - partition of the chain @xmath107\\rangle}},\\ ] ] which measures the entanglement in the ground state between two equal halves of the chain .",
    "it has been suggested in non - random systems @xcite that for critical cases @xmath108 whereas in non - critical cases @xmath109 saturates in the thermodynamic limit .    indeed , as shown in fig.[fig:3 ] ,",
    "we find for the @xmath78 that @xmath109 saturates to a constant finite @xmath110 for the rnc case @xmath103 , while in the rc case it grows logarithmically @xmath111 we also note an interesting even - odd-@xmath112 effect which slowly diminishes as we approach the thermodynamic limit . as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite such an effect is induced by open boundary conditions .",
    "for periodic boundary conditions the entanglement entropy for rnc case is twice as large as in the @xmath78 with open boundaries .",
    "this further confirms the conjecture that only short - range correlations around the boundary between the two halves contribute to the entanglement .",
    "we note that our result is essentially different from results for other models , which can be obtained by perturbative real space renormalization group @xcite , for example for the disordered critical heisenberg chain @xcite , where @xmath113 and is in general model dependent @xcite .",
    "the fact that the entanglement is reduced in the rnc case with local disorder can be explained by chaotic behavior @xcite signalized by the level repulsion in the gap distribution .",
    "a similar effect can be observed in localization properties where hopping of excitations induced by inter - particle interactions is diminished by introducing local disorder @xcite .",
    "this effect of increased localization is useful for successful quantum computing and has important consequences for transport properties such as conductivity @xcite .",
    "the most direct probe of criticality is perhaps to investigate of long - range order and ( space ) correlation functions . in",
    "order to do this we compute the ensemble averaged fluctuation of the spin - spin correlation function between two vertices @xmath114 note that we have to consider average fluctuations of the spin - spin correlation function instead of the correlation function itself , since the latter have to vanish due to the local gauge invariance properties of the tsre .",
    "because of the local invariance of the tsre it is enough to consider a single type of correlation function , as the rhs of ( [ eq : c ] ) _ does not _ depend on indices @xmath115 if @xmath116 ; in fact in numerical computations we average over @xmath115 in order to improve statistics .",
    "we consider the hamiltonian ( [ eq : h1 ] ) with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "this allows us to average the fluctuation of the correlation over the chain and hence @xmath117 .",
    "we expect that the results would be qualitatively the same for the model with open boundaries and sufficiently large @xmath5 , but we obtain better statistics in this way .",
    "[ fig:4 ] shows the averaged correlation function fluctuation @xmath118 for a few choices of the control parameter @xmath42 and of the chain lengths @xmath119 .",
    "the results for chains of different lengths coincide for small distances @xmath120 whereas for larger @xmath120 finite - size effects are noticeable . for sufficiently large chains",
    "it can be conjectured that the fluctuations ( or effective correlations ) asymptotically decay in the rnc case as @xmath121 with a finite correlation length @xmath122 whereas the decay for the rc case is slower than exponential , perhaps a power - law , which indicates long - range order @xmath123 .      in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] we observe that the degree of localization depends on the control parameter @xmath42 and the correlation function @xmath118 decays on larger scales as we approach the critical point @xmath84 which results in a larger correlation length @xmath122 .",
    "eventually , the correlation length becomes infinite at the critical point @xmath84 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] we show the dependence of the correlation length @xmath122 on the control parameter @xmath42 as obtained by exponential fit of @xmath118 for a finite size @xmath124 .",
    "unlike conventional phase transition as in e.g. @xcite , the correlation length seems to diverge logarithmically as @xmath125 with @xmath126 ( indicated in the inset of fig.[fig:5 ] ) , even though algebraic scaling can not be entirely excluded with the numerical data that are available at present .",
    "large correlation length has strong effect on entanglement .",
    "long range correlations demand longer chains for the entanglement entropy to saturate whereas the saturation value itself also grows when the critical point is approached . in fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] we plot the entanglement entropy saturation value for various values of parameter @xmath42 and observe similar behavior as for the correlation length .    however , unlike the correlation length the quantity which diverges logarithmically when @xmath127 is not the entanglement entropy @xmath109 but its exponential .",
    "in fact , numerical data for small @xmath42 show good agreement with @xmath128 , where @xmath129 ( indicated in the inset of fig.[fig:6 ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath130 is to a good approximation proportional to the effective rank , or the schmidt number of the ground state @xmath131 @xcite , which denotes the number of eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix needed to describe the state of the system up to an error @xmath132 .",
    "in fact , the effective rank @xmath133 , rather than the entanglement entropy , is the decisive indicator of simulability by the dmrg method @xcite and , we believe , also a relevant quantity in the description of a quantum phase transition .",
    "in the present paper we have defined a two - body random matrix ensemble of independent spin hamiltonians which are invariant under local @xmath15 transformations and described them in a framework of undirected graphs .",
    "as the simplest example , we have studied a chain with nearest - neighbour interactions in a random external field and observed a non - conventional phase transition when the external field is switched off .",
    "the system is always critical in conventional terminology as it has a vanishing gap in the thermodynamic limit in all cases studied .",
    "yet we have shown that , in the presence of a random external field breaking time - reversal invariance , the locally disordered system has many properties of non - critical systems such as finite correlation length and finite bipartite entanglement entropy in the thermodynamic limit , whereas the gap decay obeys a universal power law dependence .",
    "the transition towards the critical point with vanishing of the external field exhibits logarithmic divergence for the correlation length and the effective rank of the ground state .",
    "we have no explanation for the logarithmic behavior in the quantum phase transition .",
    "the model proposed is much richer than the example discussed .",
    "thus we expect , that higher connectivity of the graph will yield very different results , but even an exploration of high temperature behaviour for the chain seems very worthwhile . in view of the large structural invariance group of the ensemble in the case of site independent average coupling and external fields",
    "we hope , that some analytic results can be obtained for this ensemble .",
