    "the growth of blood vessels is a complex multiscale process called angiogenesis that is the basis of organ growth and repair in healthy conditions and also of pathological developments such as cancerous tumors @xcite .",

    "blood brings oxygen and nutrients that foster tumor growth . in angiogenesis ,",
    "events happening in cellular and subcellular scales unchain endothelial cell motion and proliferation , build millimeter scale blood sprouts and networks thereof @xcite .",
    "angiogenesis imbalance contributes to numerous malignant , inflammatory , ischaemic , infectious , and immune disorders @xcite .",
    "for these reasons , immense human and material resources are devoted to understanding and controlling angiogenesis .",
    "theoretical efforts based on angiogenesis models go hand in hand with experiments @xcite .",
    "models range from very simple to extraordinarily complex and often try to illuminate some particular mechanism ; see the review @xcite .",
    "realistic microscopic models involve postulating mechanisms and a large number of parameters that can not be directly estimated from experiments , but they often yield qualitative predictions that can be tested . an important challenge is to extract mesoscopic and macroscopic descriptions of angiogenesis from the diverse microscopic models .",
    "early angiogenesis macroscopic models consisted of reaction - diffusion equations for densities of cell and chemicals ( growth factors , fibronectin , etc . )",
    "these models do not allow to treat the growth and evolution of individual blood vessels .",
    "later models focused on the evolution of the cells at the tip of a vessel sprout .",
    "the ten or so cells at a vessel tip are highly motile and do not proliferate .",
    "they follow chemotactic and haptotactic clues as they advance toward hypoxic regions that experience lack of oxygen .",
    "these cells are followed by proliferating stalk cells that build a capillary in their wake .",
    "thus _ tip cell models _ are based on the motion of single particles representing the tip cells and their trajectories constitute the advancing blood vessels @xcite .",
    "more realistic and necessarily more complex models illuminate tip and stalk cell dynamics , the motion of tip and stalk cells on the extracellular matrix outside blood vessels , blood circulation in newly formed vessels , and so on @xcite .    in recent work @xcite , we have been trying to bridge the gap between microscopic descriptions of early stage tumor induced angiogenesis that require large numerical simulations and macroscopic descriptions that are amenable to a more thorough theoretical study .",
    "we consider a simple tip cell model in which tip stochastic extension is driven by the gradient of growth factors ( chemotaxis ) , there is a random branching of tips and tips join with existing blood vessels ( anastomosis ) . we have derived a deterministic description for the density of vessel tips consisting of an integrodifferential equation for the tip density coupled to a reaction - diffusion equation for the tumor angiogenic factor ( taf , which comprises vessel endothelial and other growth factors ) @xcite .",
    "the stochastic model can be made more realistic by adding equations characterizing haptotaxis , the influence of other chemicals or drugs , etc .",
    "while cell densities can be extracted from numerical simulations of microscopic models , our equation for the tip density @xcite incorporates tip branching and anastomosis as derived from a stochastic model @xcite , not postulated ad hoc .",
    "it turns out that the tip density soon forms a moving lump that advances towards the tumor .",
    "the longitudinal section of the stable lump ( that we may term _ angiton _ ) is approximately given by a moving soliton - like wave @xcite .",
    "this wave is an exact 1d solution of a reduced equation for the marginal tip density on the whole real line that has constant chemotactic force and no diffusion .",
    "it appears by differentiating a domain - wall solution ( topological soliton ) connecting two spatially homogeneous states .",
    "numerical evidence shows that it is asymptotically stable @xcite . technically speaking",
    ", it is not known whether two soliton - like waves in the angiogenesis model equations emerge unchanged from collisions except for a phase shift .",
    "therefore we do not claim that angiogenesis soliton - like lump profiles are true solitons .",
    "however stable soliton - like waves are central to the arguments of the present paper and , by an abuse of language , we will call them solitons . in this , we follow extended usage in the physical literature in which other stable waves such as `` topological solitons '' @xcite or `` diffusive solitons '' @xcite are called simply solitons despite not emerging unscathed from collisions @xcite .",
    "the soliton shape and velocity depend on two collective coordinates .",
    "the vessel tip density approaches the soliton solution after an initial formation stage .",
    "after its formation and until the vessels are close to the tumor , the tip density is described by the soliton and the solution of its two collective coordinate equations .    in this paper , we deduce the equations for the angiogenesis soliton and its collective coordinates , solve the latter numerically and reconstruct the marginal tip density from the soliton formula .",
    "then we show that it agrees with both the solution of the deterministic description and with the ensemble average of the tip density as extracted from the stochastic process .",
    "although the fluctuations are large , we give numerical evidence that the position of the soliton peak is very close to that of the maximum of the marginal tip density for different replicas or realizations of the stochastic process .",
    "this implies that the simple description based on the soliton may give useful information about single replicas of the angiogenesis process .",
    "while our simple model needs to be completed to discuss control of angiogenesis , we show how changing a single parameter results in seemingly arresting the process .",
    "the rest of the paper is as follows .",
    "we recall the stochastic model of @xcite and its deterministic description @xcite in section [ sec : model ] . by a chapman - enskog method ,",
    "we derive a reduced equation for the marginal tip density in section [ sec : reduced ] . by neglecting diffusion and considering constant coefficients in the resulting equation",
    ", we find in section [ sec : soliton ] an analytical expression for the soliton of the marginal tip density @xcite .",
    "section [ sec : cc ] contains a derivation of the differential equations for the two collective coordinates of the soliton .",
    "the coefficients appearing in these equations contain spatial averages of the taf density . in section [ sec : numerical ] , we explain how to calculate the coefficients in the collective coordinate equations , solve them numerically , reconstruct the soliton and , through it , the marginal vessel tip density .",
    "we compare it with direct solutions of the deterministic description and ensemble averages of the stochastic process .",
    "although realizations of the stochastic angiogenic process provide very different looking vessel networks , we also show that the maximum of the marginal density for each realization follows closely the soliton peak .",
    "section [ sec : conclusions ] contains our conclusions and the appendices are devoted to technical matters .",
    "early stages of angiogenesis are described by a simple stochastic model in @xcite .",
    "it consists of a system of langevin equations for the extension of vessel tips , a tip branching process and tip annihilation ( anastomosis ) when they merge with existing vessels .",
    "a tip @xmath0 is born at a random time @xmath1 from a moving tip ( we ignore branching from mature vessels ) and disappears at a later random time @xmath2 , either by reaching the tumor or by anastomosis . at time @xmath1 , the velocity of the newly created tip @xmath0 is selected out of a normal distribution , @xmath3 with mean @xmath4 and a narrow variance @xmath5 . in addition , the probability that a tip branches from one of the existing ones during an infinitesimal time interval @xmath6 $ ] is taken proportional to @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the taf concentration and @xmath9 in which @xmath10 is a reference concentration .",

    "the chemotactic force is @xmath24 where @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 are positive parameters .",
    "the taf concentration solves @xmath28 here @xmath29 ( diffusivity ) and @xmath30 are positive parameters , whereas @xmath31 is a regularized smooth delta function ( e.g. , a gaussian with variances @xmath32 and @xmath33 proportional to @xmath34 along the @xmath35 and @xmath36 directions , respectively ) that becomes @xmath37 in the limit as @xmath38 .",
    "there is a counterpart to the stochastic model for the densities of vessel tips and the vessel tip flux , defined as ensemble averages over a sufficient number @xmath39 of replicas ( realizations ) @xmath40 of the stochastic process : @xmath41 as @xmath42 , these ensemble averages tend to the tip density @xmath43 , the marginal tip density @xmath44 , and the tip flux @xmath45 , respectively . in @xcite",

    ".units for nondimensionalizing the model equations . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     -1.6 cm    we can use the soliton construction as a simple means to evaluate the influence of new mechanisms on angiogenesis . for instance , suppose that some drug causes the friction coefficient @xmath50 to increase fivefold",
    ". then the marginal tip density gets delayed as shown by figure [ fig6 ] .",
    "this can be evaluated easily and cheaply by solving the cces .",
    "what does this mean for replicas of the angiogenesis process ?",
    "figure [ fig7 ] displays the vessel networks formed after 36 hours for @xmath51 and 29.4 in two different replicas of the stochastic process . for @xmath51 ,",
    "the vessel network of one replica of the angiogenesis process has reached the tumor at @xmath52 after 36 hours , for @xmath53 the vessel network is only half way through its road to the tumor after that time .",
    "had the increase in @xmath50 been the result of some therapy , we could have ascertained its merits by solving the cces and inferring the arrest of the vessel network from the result .",
    "previous work has shown that a simple stochastic model of tumor induced angiogenesis could be described deterministically by an integrodifferential equation of fokker - planck type with a linear birth term and a nonlinear death ( anastomosis ) term @xcite .",
    "anastomosis keeps the number of vessel tips rather small ( about one hundred ) and therefore the vessel tip density has to be reconstructed from ensemble averages of the stochastic process , which is not self - averaging .",
    "numerical simulations of stochastic and deterministic equations show that the vessel tip density advances from the primary vessel towards the tumor as a stable moving lump or angiton whose profile along the @xmath35 axis is soliton - like @xcite .",
    "an analytic formula for the longitudinal profile of the angiton ( called the `` soliton '' in this paper ) can be deduced by ignoring spatio - temporal variation of the tumor angiogenic factor and diffusion @xcite .",
    "this formula involves two collective coordinates that characterize the shape and velocity of the soliton @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we have derived the reduced equation for the marginal tip density by means of a chapman - enskog method .",
    "we have deduced the differential equations for the collective coordinates whose terms involve spatial averages over the fully grown soliton far from the tumor .",
    "we can deduce these equations both from the deterministic description and from ensemble averages of the full stochastic model . in both cases ,",
    "the soliton provides a good reconstruction of the deterministic marginal tip density or its version based on ensemble averages , provided the soliton is not too close to the tumor . as said before",
    ", fluctuations are large because anastomosis keeps a small number of active vessel tips at all time .",
    "nevertheless , we have shown that the position of the maximum marginal tip density as given by the soliton is quite close to that given by any replica of the stochastic angiogenesis process .",
    "this indicates that the simple soliton construction yields good predictions of the evolution of the blood vessel network .",
    "there are mechanisms not included in our stochastic conceptual model of angiogenesis .",
    "however , many mechanisms such as haptotaxis can be included by adding terms to the force @xmath54 in the langevin equation for the vessel tips that depend on additional continuum fields ( fibronectin , matrix degrading enzymes , etc ; see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the effects of anti - angiogenic factors could be treated by including additional reaction - diffusion equations and their effects on the vessel tips @xcite .",
    "such terms can be straightforwardly incorporated to the equations for the soliton collective coordinates using the same methodology as explained in the present paper .",
    "there are other models that postulate reinforced random walks @xcite or cellular potts models with monte carlo dynamics @xcite instead of langevin equations to describe the extension of vessel tips .",
    "insofar as fokker - planck equations can be derived from master equations in appropriate limits @xcite and branching and anastomosis are similar to those of our conceptual model , we could use the same methodology as in the present paper to study such models .",
    "let us recall that the soliton solution comes through a balance of birth and death terms , convection and time derivative terms in the equation for the marginal tip density .",
    "these terms would also appear in special limits of the random walk or cellular potts models .",
    "we consider the work presented in this paper a blueprint for using the soliton methodology to analyze more complex angiogenesis models and a first step to control angiogenesis through soliton dynamics .",
