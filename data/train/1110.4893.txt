    "in the following , we derive hamiltonian ( 1 ) of the main text , which describes the spectrum of a quantum dot formed in a straight , suspended carbon nanotube , in the absence of phonons ( i.e.  in a static tube ) . as usual",

    "the energy gap between the valence band and the conduction band is @xmath104 , where @xmath105 with @xmath106 being the curvature induced minigap , which is typically of order 10 mev , but proportional to @xmath107 , where @xmath108 is the chiral angle of the tube . for nominally metallic tubes , @xmath109 .",
    "the spin - orbit interaction has two terms , one that is diagonal in sublattice ( the @xmath110 term ) and one which is off - diagonal ( the @xmath111 term ) .",
    "the spin - orbit interaction connects the spin projection along the tube axis to the @xmath112 ( valley flavor ) quantum number through the prefactor @xmath113 .",
    "the microscopic derivation of this hamiltonian can be found in refs .  .",
    "finally , the term @xmath114 describes the confining potential of the quantum dot .",
    "it is assumed to be smooth on the atomic scale and hence has no sublattice structure .",
    "furthermore , an applied magnetic field couples to both the spin and orbital degrees of freedom .",
    "the coupling to the orbital degree of freedom appears through the aharonov - bohm flux , which modifies the boundary condition of the circumferential wave vector and hence changes @xmath115 . in total , the hamiltonian due to magnetic field is @xmath116 where @xmath117 .",
    "there are several ways to arrive at the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( 1 ) in the main text . here",
    "we will assume a hierarchy of energy scales , typical of many experimental realizations of nanotube quantum dots , namely @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the level spacing due to longitudinal quantization and @xmath120 , @xmath121 , and @xmath122 are the energy changes due to the external magnetic field , spin - orbit coupling , and valley mixing , respectively .",
    "this allows us to first solve for the dot wavefunction in absence of these three contributions and then project onto a single longitudinal mode .",
    "in passing we note that in order to get more information about dependence of the orbital magnetic moment and spin - orbit coupling on the number of electrons in the quantum dot , one has to be more precise and use a specific form of the confining potential , e.g. assuming a square well potential , as in refs .  .",
    "this was done in refs .  , where a method to experimentally extract the two spin - orbit parameters @xmath110 and @xmath111 , as well as @xmath123 , was shown .",
    "now imagine that one has solved for the case without magnetic field , spin - orbit coupling , and mixing between @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "this gives a set of longitudinal wavefunctions , each one four - fold degenerate due to the spin and valley degrees of freedom .",
    "the energy splitting between these shells is @xmath126 .",
    "we label these states by the valley and spin quantum numbers @xmath127 and @xmath128 , respectively , which indicate corresponding eigenvalues under @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "projected onto eigenstates of the spatial coordinates @xmath8 and @xmath131 ( the circumferential coordinate ) , the wave function in the envelope - function representation has the form@xcite @xmath132 where @xmath133 is the wave vector associated with the gap , @xmath134 is a pseudospinor describing the sublattice degrees of freedom , @xmath135 and @xmath136 describe the spin and valley degrees of freedom , respectively , @xmath137 and @xmath138 , and the precise form of the envelope wave function @xmath139 depends on the confining potential .",
    "we can now take matrix elements with respect to @xmath140 and @xmath141 and also a term describing the microscopic disorder that couples valleys : @xmath142 , where @xmath143 is a short - range disorder potential depending on the longitudinal and circumferential coordinate operators .",
    "( note that short - range disorder can be systematically incorporated into the envelope - function description , see e.g. , refs . .",

    "next we look at how the vibrations couple to the four states of the quantum dot .",
    "the amplitude of the tube is in terms of the harmonic oscillator raising / lowering operators given by @xmath150 where we focus on a single vibrational mode .",
    "the coupling to the spin is via the change of the tangent direction given by @xmath151 where @xmath152 is perpendicular to the tube and in the plane of the vibration .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian then becomes@xmath153 as above , we now project onto a single longitudinal mode , thus taking matrix elements of @xmath154 in the basis @xmath155 .",
    "such matrix elements involve form factors like @xmath156 at this point we note that the coupling is small for a symmetric dots and even harmonics , because the @xmath157 factors then tend to cancel , see discussion in the main text .",
    "the effective hamiltonian for coupling between the four states of the quantum dot and the vibration now becomes @xmath158    we see from eq .",
    "that the coupling of the vibrations to quantum dot states have different form factors from what one would get by simply setting into eq .",
    "( 1 ) of the main paper .",
    "however , when the energy scales are clearly separated as in the eigenstates @xmath155 are eigenstates of @xmath102 ( which can be seen from ) and therefore @xmath159 ( for the conduction band ) . therefore",

    "was derived under the assumption that the gap dominates over the longitudinal size quantization energy , which is valid for few - electron quantum dot .",
    "however , it is important to note that one could easily extend this to the more general case at higher energies by including the difference in form factors @xmath162 and @xmath163 without changing the conclusions and structure of our results qualitatively .",
    "we treat three different qubit realizations in the main text : the spin qubit ( s ) , the kramers qubit in a magnetic field perpendicular to the carbon nanotube ( cnt ) ( kx ) , and the kramers qubit in a parallel - to - cnt magnetic field ( kz ) .",
    "below , we express the three qubit hamiltonians @xmath164 , @xmath165 and @xmath166 as functions of system parameters and cnt deformation . to clarify the correspondence with the jaynes - cummings hamiltonian in eq .",

    "the quantum dot ( qd ) energy spectrum shows a crossing of the energies of a pair of spin states belonging to the same valley ( see fig . 2 of the main text ) .",
    "around this point these two levels are energetically well separated from the other qd levels .",
