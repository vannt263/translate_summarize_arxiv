    "increasing amounts of information are now circulated because of recent advancements in digitalization , thereby increasing the importance of protecting personal information .",
    "information that can identify a person should not be publicized or utilized without the person s consent . in the case of information regarding real estate ,",
    "the location can be identified by combining several information sources , which in turn might be used to identify a person , such as an owner or resident .",
    "spatial information of the sort that relates to real estate can be considered to require special protection .",
    "two factors are important in dealing with privacy - sensitive information .",
    "first , if information is leaked , then the organization responsible for the information risks receiving compensation claims because of privacy protection failure .",
    "second , to avoid possible troubles due to potential information leaks , publicized data tend to become very rough or vague to avoid potential trouble , often hindering the usefulness of real estate analyses aimed at understanding the market .    a promising way of dealing with this situation is to protect personal information by adding noise to acquired data .",
    "a typical example of sensitive information is transaction data , which can include transacted prices , real estate or transacting person characteristics , and information regarding transaction conditions .",
    "publicized data tend to omit information about characteristics of transacting persons , and hence , such contents are assumed not to be included in the database . in this case",
    ", one of the most sensitive types of data will be the transacted price .",
    "private information will be protected if noise is added to the price data",
    ". however , tactless noise addition seriously distorts data analysis results .",
    "therefore , providing a method of adding noise without distorting data analyses but still protecting privacy is very important .",
    "this study is devoted to proposing and applying such a method , assuming that the main concern of the analyses is hedonic analysis , i.e. , regression analysis with the transacted price being the response variable .",
    "@xcite reviewed statistical issues in publicizing individual data .",
    "he listed several methods of protecting personal information , such as ( 1 ) direct hiding by making the information secret , ( 2 ) global categorization by organizing values into several coarse classes , and ( 3 ) disturbance by replacing actual values with different ones ( such as swapping by exchanging individual values , the post - randomization method [ pram ] , or the addition of noise ) .",
    "direct hiding and global categorization are not appropriate for releasing data for detailed analyses because the resolution of the information can become very coarse .",
    "disturbance methods are superior in this aspect , although they usually introduce errors into analyses , and such effects must be carefully examined .",
    "one well - known method of protecting personal information is the statistical disclosure limitation ( sdl ) method .",
    "sdl is a general term for methods of protecting identification of personal data by adding perturbations , modifications , or summarization ( @xcite ) .",
    "the main concern is to reduce identification risk as well as to retain data usability .",
    "typically , three kinds of methods are often used to reduce identification risk , including ( 1 ) methods of establishing coarse categorization , ( 2 ) methods of generating new data with statistical characteristics similar to those of the original data , and ( 3 ) methods of adding noise to the original data ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "substantial research has been conducted on methods of establishing coarse categorization . in particular ,",
    "population uniqueness , the feature that a combination of attributes becomes unique in the parent population , has been studied extensively .",
    "for example , @xcite estimated the risk of population uniqueness for discrete data .    regarding methods of generating new data , the swapping method , in which categorical data are probabilistically exchanged ,",
    "is well known .",
    "one such swapping method is pram , which perturbs the exchanging of categorical data ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . in this method ,",
    "a transition probability matrix is constructed and then used as the basis for exchanging categorical data , while maintaining the original proportions of the categories .",
    "a variety of methods of adding noise , while carefully maintaining qualitative features , have been proposed .",
    "for example , @xcite focused on features such as the positivities of values and the magnitude relations between pairs of values .",
    "they proposed a method of adding noise such that the positivities of values , mean values , and variance - covariance matrices remain the same .",
    "one remarkable idea is to use multiplicative noise addition to avoid obtaining negative values .",
    "moreover , they demonstrated the stability of results after regression analyses .",
    "a similar method of maintaining the characteristics of attributes was proposed by @xcite .",
    "another method of adding noise to avoid the risk of identification is to introduce random noise distributed following a peculiar symmetric distribution with a hole in the center . with this method ,",
    "the perturbed value is never close to the original value , and therefore , the risk of identification is drastically reduced . in the actual application of this method ,",
    "the noise distribution is not publicized , hindering analyses using the distribution ( @xcite ) .",
    "in general , noise addition can influence the quality of subsequent analyses .",
    "@xcite noted that noise addition has an influence similar to that of introducing measurement errors to explanatory variables .",
    "several methods have been devised to minimize the influence of noise in particular analyses .",
    "for example , some methods maintain the original mean values and variance - covariance matrices ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . in our paper , which focuses on regression analysis , a method is proposed in which adding noise produces robust results .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : theory ] , we propose a method of adding noise to a response variable and show that some important statistics do not change with noise addition . in section [ sec : numerical ] , numerical experiments are conducted to examine how the results of multivariate analyses , apart from the assumed regression analysis , can change . finally , section [ sec : conclusion ] concludes with a summary and suggests possible extensions of our method .",
    "we assume that the @xmath0 design matrix @xmath1 is given by @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is an @xmath4-dimensional vector of ones , and the @xmath4-dimensional response vector is @xmath5 .",
    "we also assume that @xmath4 is sufficiently larger than @xmath6 and that the rank of @xmath1 is @xmath7 . then the ordinary least squares ( ols )",
    "estimator is @xmath8 a decomposition of @xmath5 based on the ols estimator @xmath9 is @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the predictive vector and @xmath12 is the residual vector .",
    "then the coefficient of determination defined by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the sample mean of @xmath5 , measures the goodness of fit resulting from the use of the ols estimator @xmath9 .",
    "the coefficient of determination , @xmath15 , is hence regarded as a key quantity in regression analysis .",
    "the @xmath16-value of the regression coefficient @xmath17 for @xmath18 , is another key quantity and is defined by @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the @xmath21-th diagonal component of @xmath22 . when gaussian linear regression is performed , @xmath23 has a student s @xmath16-distribution with @xmath24 degrees of freedom under the null hypothesis @xmath25 .",
    "the objective of the derivation presented herein is to add perturbation to the original response vector and achieve tractable tuning of the @xmath15 and @xmath16-values .",
    "any @xmath4-dimensional random vector @xmath26 may be used as the starting point .",
