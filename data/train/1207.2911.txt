    "mott lobes show first - order phase transitions , contrary to the case of spin-1 atoms in usual lattices where the phase transition of the mott lobe with one atom per site remains second order for all values of the spin interaction  @xcite . because of the richer properties of the energy functional in the spin-1 case it is no longer possible to determine the quantum phase of the system with a stability analysis of the mott phase only .",
    "the ground - state energy functional for each point in parameter space has to be analyzed , and we have given a detailed analysis of the size of the various mott phases in the atomic limit and pointed out the differences to the case of spinless bosons .",
