    "intracluster abundance variations are well - known among globular cluster stars on the red giant branch , subgiant branch , and main sequence ( see gratton et al .",
    "2004 for a thorough review ) . within halo globular clusters , at fixed stellar luminosity , some stars are observed to have a typical population ii abundance pattern , while others are depleted in carbon , oxygen , and magnesium , and enriched in nitrogen , sodium , and aluminum .",
    "this latter abundance pattern is most easily observed as unusually strong cn absorption in low - resolution spectra , whereby it was first discovered .",
    "consequently such stars are referred to as `` cn - strong , '' and the entire abundance pattern from carbon through aluminum is implied by that name . the existence of cn - strong stars in globular clusters is presently interpreted as a sign of an early enrichment process whose details are murky ( e.g. , cannon et al .",
    "1998 , bekki et al . 2007 ) .",
    "this process apparently occurs in all halo globular clusters @xcite , but not in open clusters ( e.g. , norris & smith 1985 , smith & norris 1984 ) , the halo field @xcite , or in the dwarf spheroidal satellites of the milky way @xcite .",
    "there are several possible explanations for the existence of cn - strong stars in globular clusters , including pollution of cluster - forming gas by agb star winds ( e.g. , cottrell & da costa 1981 ) , an early generation of stars with a top - heavy mass function ( e.g. , cannon et al .",
    "1998 ) , or wolf - rayet stars ( e.g. , smith 2006 ) .",
    "there is also an emerging paradigm that sufficiently massive globular clusters form their stars in two generations ( e.g. , carretta et al .",
    "2008 and dercole et al .",
    "2008 ) . in this picture ,",
    "cluster mass loss is driven by supernovae , primarily affecting the first generation of stars and accounting for the varying ratios of halo - like to enriched stars and differing horizontal branch morphologies .",
    "all of the various models have a few common characteristics : the process must happen quickly , since there is a limited time from the first star formation in a globular cluster until the @xmath0m@xmath1 stars that are presently red giants have finished forming .",
    "all models rely on intermediate- to high - mass stars as a source for polluting material , both because of their relatively short lifetimes and because the existence of anticorrelated mg and al abundances implies high - temperature fusion .",
    "all models also require a proto - cluster to have a significant gravitational potential ( to retain enriched gas ) and a sufficiently rarefied environment ( to prevent ram pressure stripping ) . given these characteristics ,",
    "it can be understood qualitatively why old , isolated halo globular clusters would contain cn - strong stars while lower - mass disk objects like open clusters would not .",
    "disk globular clusters , with their relatively high metallicities , provide an interesting intersection of those two populations , and a convenient testbed for models of the primordial enrichment process . if the process is prohibited by in - disk orbits or high metallicity , then disk globular clusters will have homogeneous abundance patterns similar to those in open clusters . however",
    ", if the high initial mass and relatively deep potential well of a proto - globular cluster is the key to allowing enrichment , disk and bulge globular clusters could also contain a subpopulation of stars with the same cn - strong abundance pattern observed in halo globular clusters ( if the yields of the enriching stars scale with metallicity ) .",
    "it is in this context that we consider our data set , which is comprised of keck / lris blue spectra of 24 upper red giant branch stars in the high - metallicity disk globular cluster ngc 6356 and 11 similar stars in ngc 6528 .",
    "ngc 6356 is in a location consistent with being a disk globular cluster ( e.g. , zinn 1985 ) : 2.7 kpc above the galactic plane , on the far side of the galactic center @xcite .",
    "its metallicity is [ fe / h]@xmath2 according to the 2003 revision of the @xcite catalog .",
    "ngc 6528 is located in baade s window , 0.6 kpc from the galactic center and 0.6 kpc below the plane . as such ,",
    "it is considered a bulge globular cluster @xcite , with @xcite and @xcite finding metallicities of [ fe / h]@xmath3 and @xmath4 dex from optical and infrared spectroscopy , respectively .",
    "we compare these spectra to lick / kast blue spectra of 22 red giants in the old open clusters ngc 188 ( [ fe / h]@xmath5 , carraro & chiosi 1994 ) , ngc 2158 ( [ fe / h]@xmath6 , carraro et al .",
    "2002 ) , and ngc 7789 ( [ fe / h]@xmath7 , tautvaiv sien et al .",
    "these are all northerly clusters , with estimated ages ranging from 1.3 gyr for ngc 7789 to 7.5 gyr for ngc 188 ( both age estimates from carraro & chiosi 1994 ) .",
    "we measure the strength of the cn absorption band at @xmath8 with the index @xmath9 defined by @xcite .",
    "this quantity , like most spectral indices , measures the magnitude difference between the integrated flux inside the absorption feature in question and in a nearby continuum region . by considering cn bandstrength variation as a proxy for the full enriched abundance pattern ,",
    "we hope to explore whether ngc 6356 and ngc 6528 exhibit cn bimodality like their low - metallicity halo counterparts do , or whether their similarity to open clusters includes a homogeneous abundance distribution along with near - solar metallicities and disk orbits .",
    "spectra in ngc 6356 were acquired on two nights in 2002 june , using the low resolution imaging spectrometer ( lris , oke et al .",
    "1995 ) at the keck i telescope on mauna kea .",
    "spectra in ngc 6528 were taken on two nights in 2003 june with the same instrumental setup . using a mirror in place of a dichroic ,",

    "it is also worth noting that @xmath23 rises with brightening @xmath24 in figure 2 , while @xmath9 does not .",
