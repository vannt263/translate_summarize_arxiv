    "the non - perturbative light - cone ( lc ) wavefunction ( wf)/distribtuion amplitude ( da ) of the b meson plays an important role for making reliable predictions for exclusive b meson decays .",

    "recently , ref.@xcite claims that it is the b - meson wf rather than the b - meson da that is more relevant to the b decays , and in the framework of the @xmath4-factorization theorem @xcite , they proved that the b - meson wf is renormalizable after taking into account the renormalization - group ( rg ) evolution effects , meanwhile , the undesirable feature @xcite of the b - meson da under evolution can be removed .",

    "ref.@xcite shows that when taking @xmath6 , one can give a reasonable perturbative qcd result for @xmath7 transition form factor that is consistent with what was obtained in the lc sum rule calculation @xcite and the lattice qcd simulation @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that in the ww approximation , the obtained analytic results for the b - meson wfs @xmath0 are unique , and the only missing part for practical numerical use is the rg evolution effect . however , there is very limited knowledge on the higher fock states contributions . in ref.@xcite , the b - meson distributions @xmath8 with 3-particle fock states",
    "are given and a rough estimation presented there shows that the 3-particle fock states contributions might considerably broaden the transverse momentum distribution that is derived from the ww approximation .",
