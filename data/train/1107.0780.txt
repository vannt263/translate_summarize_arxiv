    "an emerging tissue engineering technique is bioprinting @xcite via the automated layer - by - layer deposition of multicellular aggregates ( the bioink ) .",
    "subsequent postprinting fusion of the contiguous aggregates gives rise to the desired tissue construct . predicting the result of post - printing tissue formation is a task for theoretical modeling .",

    "dah states that structure formation in multicellular systems occurs due to ( i ) differences in cell - to - cell adhesion of different types of cells and",
    "( ii ) cell motility .",
    "cells seek positions with the largest number of strong bonds .",
    "for example , in a random mixture of two cell types of different cohesivities the more cohesive cell population sorts out and occupies the central region surrounded by the less cohesive population .    by incorporating dah , metropolis monte carlo ( mmc )",
    "simulations correctly predict the formation of multicellular structures of minimum energy of adhesion , and identify long - lived , metastable configurations @xcite .",
    "however , mmc can not predict the actual time evolution of multicellular systems .",
    "insight into time evolution emerged from experiments designed to verify dah , which revealed that embryonic tissues behave analogously to highly viscous liquids .",
    "the concept of tissue liquidity motivated a quantitative description of embryonic tissues in terms of parameters of continuum hydrodynamics , such as surface tension and viscosity .",
    "for example , the ( apparent ) surface tension @xmath0 was measured for several tissue types using a parallel plate compression apparatus @xcite and the values were found to be consistent with the sorting behavior of these tissues @xcite .    here ,",
    "by using the concept of tissue liquidity and dah , we formulate two alternatives to the mmc approach for modeling cellular motion and self - assembly : ( 1 ) a _ kinetic monte carlo _ ( kmc ) , and ( 2 ) a _ cellular particle dynamics _ ( cpd ) method .",
    "both these methods are capable of describing and predicting the real time evolution of the shape of multicellular systems and tissue constructs in certain morphogenetic processes and post - bioprinting structure formation . in the kmc method the configuration of the multicellular system is propagated in time through a standard rejection - free kinetic monte carlo algorithm .",
    "this approach should provide a more accurate description of the time evolution of a multicellular system than other grid based methods , such as , the mmc model @xcite or the widely used cellular potts model ( cpm ) .",
    "the latter uses a modified metropolis mc algorithm to update the configuration of the simulated system and postulates that time is proportional to the number of mc steps , which in general is not the case @xcite . in the cpd method",
    "@xcite individual cells are modeled as an ensemble of cellular particles ( cps ) that interact via short range contact interactions , characterized by an attractive ( adhesive interaction ) and a repulsive ( excluded volume interaction ) component .",
    "cps in a cell are held together by an additional confining potential that mimics the role of the cell membrane .",
    "the time evolution of the spatial conformation of the multicellular system is determined directly by recording the trajectories of all cps by integrating their equations of motion .",
    "what sets apart cpd from the other similar off - grid particle methods , such as newman s _ subcellular element method _",
    "( sem ) @xcite , is the employed force field ( especially the confining potential ) and its parametrization that makes the system behave as a complex viscous liquid . in particular , the cpd model parameters are determined such that the shape of two fusing spherical aggregates in the cpd simulation match as closely as possible the one observed experimentally , i.e. , two attached spherical caps ( see fig .  [ caps ] ) @xcite . to test and compare the kmc and cpd methods ,",
    "we apply them to simulate the fusion of two spherical aggregates and the evolution of cell sorting within an aggregate , two morphogenetic processes driving postprinting structure formation . for the theoretical description of the fusion of two identical spherical aggregates we use a simple continuum model introduced by frenkel @xcite and further developed by others working in the field of rheology @xcite .",
    "it is this theoretical continuum model that provides the link between the time scales of simulations and the time scales of experiments .",
    "once this link is established , the kmc and cpd simulations are used to quantitatively predict the time evolution of complex postprinted structures whose description using a continuum hydrodynamics approach is impractical .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : theory ] describes the kmc ( sec .",
    "[ sec : kmc ] ) and the cpd ( sec .",
    "[ sec : cpd ] ) methods , as well as the theoretical aspects of the continuum approach of aggregate fusion ( sec .",
    "[ sec : cont ] ) .",
    "section  [ sec : results ] contains the results and discussion of our kmc and cpd simulations , i.e. , fusion of identical spherical multicellular aggregates ( sec .  [ sec : fusion ] ) and cell sorting ( sec .",

    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the kinetic monte carlo method ( kmc ) was proposed as an alternative to the mmc method for simulating the evolution of ising models @xcite . when a system approaches equilibrium , or is in a metastable state , the metropolis algorithm rejects most trial moves because the acceptance probability is small .",
    "a main feature of the kmc algorithm is that it is `` rejection - free '' . in each step , one calculates the transition rates for all possible changes compatible with the current configuration , and then chooses a new configuration with a probability proportional to the rate of the corresponding transition .",
    "we designed and implemented a kmc algorithm to simulate the time evolution of a lattice model of multicellular systems .",
    "aggregates of cells in cell culture medium are represented on a 3d hexagonal close - packed lattice by associating each site to either a cell or to a similar sized volume element of medium .",
    "thus , the lattice spacing is equal to one cell diameter .",
    "we assume that each cell interacts with its 12 nearest neighbors ( 1st and 2nd neighbors considered to be nearest neighbors ) located at a distance of one lattice spacing from the given cell .",
    "lnteractions are expressed in terms of works of cohesion and adhesion @xcite , defined as the work needed to break up the contact between two neighbors of respectively similar or differing types of cells .",
    "for example , in case of a multicellular aggregate composed of a single cell type , the work needed to extract a cell from the aggregate ( i.e. model tissue ) is the work of cohesion , @xmath1 , multiplied by the number of the cell s nearest neighbor .",
    "the interaction between cells and the cell culture medium is set to zero .",
    "the movement of cells is described by assigning rates to swapping cells with adjacent cells of different type and/or with medium elements .",
    "these elementary moves occur with rates given by @xmath2 where the factor @xmath3 is the frequency of attempts to cross the energy barrier of height @xmath4 , and @xmath5 is the energy of biological fluctuations @xcite , the analog of the energy of thermal fluctuations , @xmath6 ( @xmath7 is boltzmann s constant and @xmath8 is the absolute temperature ) .",
    "it has been argued that @xmath5 is a characteristic measure of cell motility : the higher is @xmath5 in comparison to the energies of cohesion / adhesion , the higher is the motility of the cell @xcite .    due to the complexity of the cytoskeletal machinery responsible for cell movement , there is no unique way to assign a barrier height to the swapping of two cells .",
    "any reasonable choice , however , needs to be consistent with the following set of experimental observations on cell movement in 3d :    * relocation of cells in embryonic tissues and in some engineered tissues ( such as cell aggregates ) occurs according to dah @xcite : cells take advantage of their motility to establish the maximum number of strong bonds with their neighbors . * anchorage - dependent cells do not spontaneously dissociate from the cell aggregate they are part of @xcite . *",
    "the speed of cell movement in 3d matrices has a particular dependence on the strength of cell - matrix adhesion : cell movement is fastest at an optimal strength of binding .",
    "too weak or too strong binding hampers cell movement @xcite .",
    "consider a binary particle model for a multicellular system formed by two cell types , @xmath9 ( for a multicellular aggregate composed of one cell type , @xmath10 , surrounded by tissue culture medium , @xmath11 represents the medium particle ) .",
    "the configurational energy ( or total interaction energy ) , @xmath12 is expressed as @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 , with @xmath15 and @xmath16 being the energies of cohesion respectively for cell type 1 and 2 , and @xmath17 is the energy of adhesion .",
    "@xmath18 is total number of nearest neighbor pairs of different cell types cells , @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) the number of nearest neighbors of cell @xmath21 of type 1(2 ) , which are of type 2(1 ) and @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) the total number of cells of type 1(2 ) , which have at least one ( nearest ) neighbor of type 2(1 ) .",
    "( as the _ const _ is irrelevant for the evolution of the system , we set it to zero @xcite . )",
    "consider two nearest neighbor cells , @xmath21 and @xmath24 of different types ( without loss of generality we can set @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) .",
    "the system evolves in time towards configurations of decreasing energy @xmath12 , i.e. for @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) @xmath29 decreases ( increases ) . for @xmath27 and @xmath28 cells",
    "respectively phase separate ( cell sorting ) and mix ( cell mixing ) .",
    "elementary kmc moves consist of swapping two neighbors of different types ( swapping cells of same type does not change the energy ) .",
    "the contribution of two such cells , @xmath21 and @xmath24 to @xmath12 is @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "furthermore , the larger is @xmath32 the more likely is the kmc move to swap cells @xmath21 and @xmath24 .",
    "thus it is reasonable to define the energy barrier @xmath33 in eq .",

    "is obtained when the number of neighbors of differing type surrounding cells @xmath21 and @xmath24 is maximal .",
    "now we can formulate the steps of our kmc algorithm for simulating the time evolution of multicellular systems : ( s1 ) set @xmath36 ; ( s2 ) find all interfacial cells ( i.e. , cells in contact with cell culture medium or with cells of different type ) and compute the rates @xmath37 , @xmath38 , corresponding to all possible @xmath39 transitions involving these cells ; ( s3 ) calculate the cumulative rates : @xmath40 , @xmath38 ; ( s4 ) generate a uniform random number @xmath41 between @xmath42 and @xmath43 and carry out event `` @xmath44 '' for which @xmath45 ; ( s5 ) generate another uniform random number @xmath46 between @xmath42 and @xmath43 , and increment the time variable ( i.e. , @xmath47 ) by the non - uniform time step @xmath48 ( s6 ) update all rates @xmath49 that may have changed due to the previous transition `` @xmath44 '' ; ( s7 ) return to step s2 and repeat the process until the time variable reaches the desired target value .      the _ cellular particle dynamics _ ( cpd ) method is an off - lattice , particle - based computer simulation method that can describe and predict the time evolution of 3d multicellular systems during shapechanging biomechanical transformations @xcite . within the cpd formalism cells , regarded as continuous objects with self - adaptive shape ,",

    "each volume element is represented by a point - like cellular particle ( cp ) situated at its center of mass .",
    "cps interact via short - range contact interactions , characterized by an attractive ( adhesive interaction ) and a repulsive ( excluded volume interaction ) component .",
    "in addition , cps within a given cell are subject to a confining potential that assures the integrity of the cell .",
    "the time evolution of the spatial conformation of the multicellular system is determined directly by calculating the trajectories of all cps ( and , therefore , cells ) through integration of their overdamped langevine equations of motion .",
    "this minimalist model , when properly parametrized , has the features of a complex viscous liquid and it is suitable for describing the time evolution of multicellular aggregates and soft - tissue constructs .    for the @xmath51 cp in cell @xmath52 ,",
    "the equation of motion is    @xmath53    where @xmath54 is the position vector , @xmath55 is the potential energy function describing the interaction of the cps , @xmath56 is the friction coefficient , @xmath57 is a random force , and the dot denotes time derivative . the random force is modeled as a gaussian white noise with zero mean and variance @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the sort - time self diffusion coefficient of the cps .",
    "the cpd parameters @xmath59 and @xmath56 are related to the previously introduced biological fluctuation energy @xmath5 by the einstein relation @xmath60 .",
    "the cp potential energy @xmath55 has an intra - cellular and an inter - cellular component corresponding to cps belonging respectively to the same cell and to different cells , i.e. , @xmath61 where @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) labels the cellular particle @xmath64 ( @xmath44 ) in cell @xmath52 ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "we model the short - range contact inter- and intra - cellular interactions between cps through    [ eq : cpd - pot ] @xmath66 @xmath67 where @xmath68\\ ] ]    is the standard lennard - jones potential , and @xmath69 is the heaviside step function .",
    "note that instead of @xmath70 one could use any other potential that has a repusive core and a short range attractive part .",
    "for example , in sem @xcite a morse potential is used to describe the interaction between two subcellular elements .    however , the important addition in cpd is the second quadratic term in @xmath71 that , for @xmath72 , represents an _",
    "elastic confining potential _ used to maintain the integrity of the cell .",
    "this term , characterized by the elastic constant @xmath73 , guarantees that the cps within a cell remain confined inside the boundary of the cell .",
    "the time evolution of the multicellular system within the cpd approach is determined by numerically integrating the equations of motion ( [ eq : cpd - eq - motion ] ) for all cps .",
    "we have accomplished this by implementing the intra- and inter - cellular interaction forces , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : cpd - u])-([eq : cpd - pot ] ) , and a langevin dynamics integrator in the freely available massively parallel molecular dynamics package lammps @xcite .      for a multicellular system of a single cell type",
    "there are nine cpd model parameters that need to be determined : @xmath50 ( the number of cps per cell ) , @xmath59 , @xmath56 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath73 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "the choice of @xmath50 is determined by the degree of detail we want to describe individual cells . since we are interested in the time evolution of the shape of an aggregate formed by a large number of cells and not in the detailed description of the surface dynamics of individual cells , in the present work we make the reasonable choice of @xmath79 .",
    "because @xmath80 in determines the size of the interacting cps , we can set @xmath81 .",
    "the length @xmath76 in represents the size ( diameter ) of a cell , which comprises @xmath50 tightly packed cps of size @xmath80 .",

    "we set the confining potential parameters as @xmath85 @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",

    "the chosen value , for which @xmath88 , is suitable when cells in the aggregate are exposed only to adhesion and surface tension forces . by choosing @xmath89 ( i.e. , same as the biological fluctuation energy @xmath5 ) the dynamics of the cps inside a cell will have sufficient randomness to produce cell surface fluctuations that play an important role in cell motility @xcite .    thus , out of the nine cpd parameters we are left with only one , @xmath90 , that needs to be determined such that the time evolution of the shape of the multicellular system follows as closely as possible the corresponding experimental one . for this purpose we focus on the fusion of two identical spherical aggregates , as described in the next section . based on extensive cpd simulations",
    "we have found that the best agreement with experiment is obtained for @xmath91 , when the system behaves as a viscous liquid . by increasing @xmath90 above @xmath92",
    "the fusing cellular aggregates show sign of solidification and their behavior deviate significantly from experiment .",

    "the fusion of two contiguous cell aggregates is driven by surface tension , @xmath98 , and resisted by viscosity , @xmath99 .",
    "it is an experimental fact that during the fusion of identical spherical soft tissue aggregates the shape of the system is that of two touching spherical caps ( see fig .",

    "cell sorting has been extensively studied both _ in vitro _",

    "according to dah , the outcome of cell sorting in a two - component multicellular aggregate ( composed of two types of cells , labeled ` @xmath171 ' and ` @xmath172 ' ) depends on the relative magnitude of the corresponding works of cohesion / adhesion needed to separate cells of the same / different types ( i.e. , @xmath173 , @xmath174 , and @xmath175 ) , respectively @xcite .",
    "here we employ both kmc and cpd simulations ( described in secs .",
    "[ sec : kmc ] and [ sec : cpd ] ) to investigate cell sorting in a spherical aggregate of two cell types @xmath171 and @xmath172 , with @xmath176 .",
    "we consider three cases , referred to as c1 , c2 and c3 , that lead to qualitatively different experimental outcomes @xcite .",
    "c1 : for intermediate adhesion between @xmath171 and @xmath172 cells , i.e. , @xmath177 , the less cohesive @xmath171 cells engulf the more cohesive @xmath172 cells , thus leading to the complete segregation ( see fig .",

    "c3 : for weak @xmath171@xmath172 adhesion , i.e. , @xmath179 , the two types of cells completely separate by transforming the initial spherical aggregate into two attached homogenous spheroidal caps ( each containing either @xmath171 or @xmath172 cells ) as shown in fig .  [ snap_sort_kmc]d .",
    "thus , the degree of cell sorting is enhanced ( reduced ) for small ( large ) values of the adhesion energy @xmath175 , compared to the corresponding cohesion energies @xmath173 and @xmath174 . note that in terms of the interfacial tension @xmath180 ( defined below eq .",

    "although the results of our kmc simulations appear to be in good qualitative agreement with experiments on cell sorting @xcite , a quantitative comparison , e.g. , in terms of the time evolution of the sorting parameter , is not feasible because @xmath217 can not be measured experimentally .",

    "moreover , the fact that , for similar model parameters , @xmath243 in kmc is about twice as large as @xmath244 in the corresponding cpd simulation indicates that the self diffusive motion of cells in kmc occurs much faster than in cpd . in other words ,",
    "the multicellular system is more liquid - like in kmc than in cpd simulations .",

    "the growing interest for understanding shape changes in such tissue constructs stems from their applications in tissue engineering in general and in the emergent field of 3d bioprinting in particular @xcite .",
    "the kmc method is based on a lattice representation of the 3d tissue construct and dynamics is described in terms of rates associated with possible movements of cells . similarly to previously employed mmc studies ,",
    "the mixing pattern observed in kmc simulations disagrees with experiments . in both methods",
    "an elementary move consists in cells swapping positions with neighbors , which overestimates cell motility .",
    "nevertheless , the time scale calibration in kmc makes the simulated time course realistic as far as the shape evolution of multicellular tissue constructs is concerned .",
    "the cpd method is based on modeling individual cells in a tissue construct as interacting cps .",

    "the cpd force field parameters are determined such that the time evolution of the shape of the fusing spherical aggregates in the cpd simulation matches as closely as possible the experimental one ( i.e. , two touching spherical caps ) .",
    "once the cpd model is calibrated , this can be used to simulate the shape evolution of arbitrary 3d multicellular constructs .",
    "it should be emphasized that in cpd ( i.e. , computer ) units the calibrated cpd parameters ( and therefore the outcome of a cpd simulation ) are independent of the used cell type .",
    "however , the cpd units have specific values for different cell types .",
    "thus , the cpd simulations reported here can be applied as is to different cell types ; the corresponding cpd time unit @xmath130 should be determined in each case by equating @xmath245 ( see sec .  [",
