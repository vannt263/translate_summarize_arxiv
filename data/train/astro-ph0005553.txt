    "the lyman-@xmath0 forest absorption in the spectra of quasars provides a wealth of information about the properties of the intergalactic medium ( hereafter , igm ) .",
    "there has recently been a lot of interest in using the distribution of doppler parameters of fitted absorption lines , measuring the total velocity dispersion of the gas , to constrain the temperature of the igm @xcite . in this paper",
    "we develop a method to identify and to fit absorption lines , and to obtain the gas temperature from the distribution of the doppler parameters of the lines .",
    "our algorithm is intended to be simple to implement and be applied identically on simulations and observations .",
    "the temperature of the igm as a function of density is primarily determined by the balance between adiabatic cooling and photoionization heating , once ionization equilibrium with the background radiation has been established . however , during the epoch of reionization , the heating rate is higher because every atom needs to be ionized once ( and the ionization can occur on a short time - scale compared to the recombination rate ) , and the high opacity of the low - density igm implies that high - frequency photons are absorbed , delivering a much greater amount of heat for each ionization ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "other sources of heating may also contribute , such as compton heating by the x - ray background @xcite , or photoelectric heating by dust grains @xcite .",
    "constraining these sources of heating is one of the two primary reasons why we are interested in measuring the temperature .",
    "the other reason is the need to make accurate predictions for the statistics of the ly@xmath0 forest flux in order to constrain cosmological parameters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the temperature - density relation affects the predicted relationship between the power spectrum of the transmitted flux and the power spectrum of the initial mass density perturbations @xcite , as well as the predicted mean transmitted flux @xcite , which can be used to constrain the baryon density of the universe .",
    "recent ly@xmath0 forest simulations have shown that , when the structure of the absorption systems is adequately resolved , the predicted absorption line widths are smaller than observed if the temperature of the igm is determined from photoionization equilibrium , well after reionization has ended @xcite . to solve the discrepancy the temperature apparently needs to be higher .",
    "several authors have presented measurements of the igm temperature using different methods , generally finding values moderately higher than expected from photoionization equilibrium @xcite .",
    "our aim in this paper is to provide a new unambiguous measurement of the temperature , making a more exhaustive analysis than in previous work of the model uncertainties that result from comparing the observational results with a simulation .",
    "we develop a new line - fitting method as an alternative to the standard voigt - profile fitting with line deblending , which is much faster , unambiguous , and easy to implement .",
    "our method works by essentially assigning one line to each sufficiently deep minimum in the transmitted flux , and measuring the line width and central optical depth for each line . the gas temperature at each density is then derived from the distribution of line widths at each central optical depth .",
    "the systematic uncertainties and model dependence of the method used to derive the temperature are carefully analyzed , in a more extensive way than it was done in previous work .",
    "the new method is applied to observational data and to a simulation in exactly the same way , computing error bars due to the variance in our observed sample .",
    "the main idea of the method to measure the temperature of the igm was suggested by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the probability distribution of doppler parameters , @xmath20 , is characterized by a lower cutoff , @xmath21 , where @xmath20 rises sharply , with very few lines having narrower doppler parameters than this cutoff .",
    "the idea is that this cutoff is a measure of the gas temperature . in general ,",
    "absorption lines have both a thermal and a hydrodynamical contribution to their breadth ; however , for any set of lines with similar gas temperature , the narrowest ones will be those where the velocity field along the line of sight through the absorber is close to a caustic , so that the variation in the fluid velocity is minimized and thermal broadening dominates the observed line width .",
    "in fact , it was found by @xcite that the narrowest absorption lines are primarily thermally broadened .",
    "a tight relationship between density and temperature in the igm for gas at low densities , where shock heating is not very important , is expected theoretically and is found in numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "this implies that the narrowest lines at a given gas density ( corresponding approximately to the optical depth at the line center ) are not selected to have low gas temperature , but low fluid velocity dispersion .",
    "this justifies estimating the temperature from the lower cutoff of the doppler parameter distribution .    in  2",
    "we briefly describe the observational data and the simulation that we use . in  3 we describe our line fitting algorithm . in ",
    "4 we demonstrate how the line fitter works by running it on spectra from the numerical simulation . in  5 we describe our method for estimating the temperature from doppler parameter distribution , testing the conditions under which the temperature can be recovered in a model - independent way . in ",
    "6 we use the line fitter on the observational data and give results for the measured temperatures .",
    "the results are discussed in  7 .",
    "the appendix describes further details of our line - fitting method .",
    "we use the same set of eight quasar spectra as in paper i  .",
    "these spectra have sufficiently high resolution and signal - to - noise ratio to measure the shape of each absorption feature .",
    "the pixel noise is typically less than 5% of the continuum flux level , and frequently as low as 1% .",
    "the velocity resolution is 6.6 @xmath22 ( fwhm ) and the spectra are binned in 0.04    pixels .",
    "more details and statistics of this data set are given in paper i  and references therein .",
    "the seven quasars from the @xcite data set have previously constructed lists of regions that are suspected of containing metal lines .",
    "our main results include these regions in the spectra because they are not positively identified as containing metal lines .    in paper",
    "i  we defined three redshift bins : @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 , with mean redshifts @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 .",
    "we use these same three bins in this paper , which contain approximately the same amount of data .",
    "we test the profile fitting code and the procedure to measure the temperature on the output of the eulerian hydrodynamical simulation described in @xcite ( referred to as l10 in that paper ) .",
    "the cosmological model used has @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and large scale primordial power spectrum slope @xmath33 .",
    "the box size of the simulation is @xmath34 mpc , and it contains @xmath35 cells .",
    "we use outputs from the simulation at @xmath364 , 3 , and 2 .",
    "ly@xmath0 spectra are computed for a large number of lines of sight along the box axes .",
    "there is one free parameter that we can vary when computing the spectra , the normalization of the optical depth , which we adjust to reproduce the mean transmitted flux of the observations that we are comparing to ( the values of the mean transmitted flux are taken from paper i  ) . renormalizing the optical depth",
    "is equivalent to modifying the intensity of the ionizing background , as long as the effect of collisional ionization and the change in the gas temperature caused by the different heating rate can be neglected ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a test that these effects are in fact negligible ) .",
    "the optical depth is then mapped to transmitted flux using @xmath37 .    for each line of sight through the simulation ( parallel to one of the three axes ) , we estimate the effects of continuum fitting by defining the maximum transmitted flux along the line of sight to be the continuum flux , @xmath38 , and dividing the flux in all other pixels in the line by @xmath38 .",
    "we map the 288 cells along a line of sight onto smaller cells , with their size chosen to match the observations that we want to compare to .",
    "finally we convolve the spectra with the instrumental resolution of @xmath39 , and we add gaussian noise to each cell with a flux dependent dispersion @xmath40 , which is taken from paper i  .      before we describe the method we shall use to measure the temperature , it will be useful to examine the temperature - density relation in the simulation . in this paper",
    "we parameterize the mean temperature - density relation ( hereafter referred to as the @xmath41 relation ) as a power - law , @xmath42 , where the gas over - density is @xmath43 , for the purpose of measuring this relation from the data .",
    "although the @xmath41 relation naturally approaches a power - law form with @xmath44 when the thermal evolution is determined by photoionization heating and adiabatic expansion alone @xcite , in general it deviates significantly from a power - law .",
    "figure [ tvsdbscatter ] shows scatter plots of t versus @xmath45 for the three redshift outputs of the simulation .",
    "the solid lines are power - law fits to the range @xmath46 , to show that the @xmath41 relation in the simulation is only roughly consistent with a power law .",
    "there is a substantial dispersion of the temperature at a given density , and the relation between the mean temperature and the density deviates from a power - law .",
    "for example , using the @xmath47 simulation output , the best power - law fits in the restricted ranges of density @xmath48(0 - 1 , 1 - 2 , 2 - 3 ) yield @xmath11(0.15 , 0.30 , 0.39 ) , with a mean fractional temperature deviation around the fits equal to ( 4% , 11% , 18% ) .",
    "the dispersion is due to shock - heating and to the variable expansion or contraction histories of the gas at a fixed density .",
    "the reionization of occurs near @xmath49 in this simulation , heating the low - density gas to a temperature that is nearly constant with density .",
    "the parameters of the power - law fits to all three simulation outputs , in the range @xmath48(1 - 2 ) , are given in table [ basesimtdbtab ] .",
    "because of this deviation from a power - law form of the @xmath41 relation , a measurement of the temperature @xmath50 and power - law index @xmath51 should be understood only as an approximation to the true mean @xmath41 relation , near the effective density at which the measurement is made , and this effective density needs to specified .",
    "we use the following form to present our results in  6 : @xmath52 where @xmath53 is chosen so that the error bars on @xmath54 and @xmath55 are uncorrelated .",
    "each pixel in a spectrum receives optical depth contributions from an extended stretch of real space along the line of sight , so no unique temperature or density can be associated with the pixel .",
    "however , we can define the temperature and the gas density at pixels in spectra to be the optical depth - weighted average over the temperature and the density of all the gas that contributes to absorption in the pixel .",
    "this definition will be used later to assign a gas temperature to any identified absorption line , which we will define to be equal to the temperature of the central pixel .",
    "table [ basesimtdbtab ] shows fits to the @xmath41 relation for pixels , restricted over the same density range",
    "@xmath56 : we see that the mean relation is almost the same as for random points in space .",
    "this is true in spite of a larger difference in the density distribution ; for example , the median @xmath45 is @xmath57 for random points at @xmath58 , and is @xmath59 for spectral pixels .",
    "this difference in the median density is caused by the thermal broadening and velocity dispersion in absorbers , which spread high density regions out into low density regions .",
    "in this section we describe the procedure that we use to identify and fit absorption lines .",
    "the temperature measurement is based on the identification of absorption lines that can be adequately fit by a single gaussian in optical depth , over a certain interval around a point where the optical depth is maximum ; the narrowest widths among the lines that can be fitted in this way will give us the gas temperature .",
    "absorption systems that can not be fitted by a single gaussian must be broadened by a non - gaussian distribution of the fluid velocity , and can therefore be discarded for the purpose of measuring the gas temperature .",
    "in contrast to the standard voigt profile fitting approach , we make no attempt to fit the entire spectrum by superposing many absorption lines .",
    "instead , we fit only small regions around minima of the transmitted flux , each one with a single gaussian absorber .",
    "we therefore have a constant number of parameters to fit for each absorption line , making the algorithm simple , unambiguous , and fast .    before we explain the procedure for identifying and fitting lines , it is useful to understand qualitatively what the results will look like .",
    "figure [ fittedspec ] shows a section of the spectrum of q1422 , with the transmitted flux indicated by the dotted line , and the fitting solutions indicated by the solid lines .",
    "our method has selected all statistically significant maxima in optical depth that are well fitted by a single gaussian and identified them as absorption lines and has discarded the rest .",
    "the fits are done over the regions indicated by the solid lines .",
    "we will return to this figure once we have described the process used to fit the lines .",
    "our fitting method consists of taking each pixel in the spectrum as a candidate for containing the center of an absorption line . after requiring several conditions and eliminating most of the pixels as candidates ,",
    "a final list of absorption lines is obtained , each one having a fitting window where a fit to the three parameters of the line ( line center , central optical depth , and line width ) is performed .",
    "none of the fitting windows from adjacent lines can overlap in the final list , as seen in the example of figure [ fittedspec ] .",
    "the first operation is to determine an integer window width , @xmath60 , which sets the fitting region around each pixel @xmath61 , going from @xmath62 to @xmath63 .",
    "the width @xmath60 is the smallest one for which the following condition is obeyed , which ensures that there is a significant decline of the flux from the average value at the edges of the fitting window to the line center : @xmath64-f\\left(p\\right ) > e_d~\\sigma\\left(p ,",
    "p\\pm w\\right)~ , \\label{edcondit}\\ ] ] where @xmath65^{1/2}~,\\ ] ] @xmath66 is the noise at pixel @xmath61 , and @xmath67 is the first parameter of the fitting algorithm .",
    "@xmath67 is the number of `` @xmath68 '' significance required of the flux decrease .",
    "there are of course some pixels where the condition in equation ( [ edcondit ] ) is never obeyed for any width . in practice , the width @xmath60 is increased only up to some maximum value @xmath69 before the pixel is discarded as a candidate for a line center .",
    "this maximum width is chosen to be large enough so that it does not affect the results of the algorithm .",
    "in addition , the minimum value of @xmath60 is set to 2 pixels ( so that the fitting region has at least 5 pixels ) .",
    "some additional parameters are used in the algorithm to expedite the elimination of pixels as candidates for line fits , increasing the speed of the code without affecting the final result ; these details are described in the appendix .    for each pixel @xmath61 where a fitting width @xmath60 has been determined in this way , the line fit is performed by @xmath70 minimization .",
    "we fit the following profile to the flux within the window : @xmath71~. \\label{profeqn}\\ ] ] here , @xmath72 is the distance from the central pixel @xmath61 .",
    "the three parameters of the fit are @xmath73 ( the optical depth at the line center ) , @xmath74 ( the location of the line center ) , and @xmath75 ( the width of the line ) . the parameter @xmath74 is constrained to lie within the pixel @xmath61 , so that when @xmath61 is not close to the center of the line , a good fit will not be obtained . to account for the instrumental resolution ,",
    "the function in equation ( [ profeqn ] ) is convolved with a gaussian filter of width matching the resolution of the data .",
    "after the fit is performed , we impose a goodness - of - fit requirement : the probability of exceeding by chance the value of @xmath70 for the best fit should be larger than a certain value @xmath76 , which is a second parameter of our method . if the requirement is not satisfied , the pixel @xmath61 is discarded as a candidate for including the center of an absorption line .",
    "the two parameters @xmath67 and @xmath76 can be adjusted to optimize the temperature measurement , based on tests using numerical simulations that we will present in  4 .    because we require @xmath74 to be within pixel @xmath61 , acceptable fits to absorption lines",
    "are only found in pixels that are indeed close to a minimum of the flux , in an absorption feature that can be adequately fitted to a single gaussian within a certain window .",
    "typically , the list of pixels where acceptable fits are found will include groups of a few adjacent pixels around such minima .",
    "the final step of our algorithm is to select among any group of pixels with accepted line fits that are within their own fitting windows the one that yielded the best fit .",
    "this produces the final list of absorption lines .",
    "we can now understand the fitting example shown in figure [ fittedspec ] .",
    "the widths of the fitting windows , shown by the solid lines , are set by the value of @xmath67 ( here , @xmath77 ) and the noise level ( which in this case varies from @xmath78 in saturated pixels to @xmath79 at the continuum ) .",
    "the apparent maxima of absorption that have no corresponding fitted line do not increase in flux enough at their edges to satisfy the requirement in equation ( [ edcondit ] ) .",
    "the cluster of fitted lines near @xmath80@xmath81 demonstrates that our procedure does not automatically eliminate lines in blends , as long as they are clearly distinct maxima .",
    "apparently , the requirement that the optical depth be consistent with a gaussian curve is easily fulfilled by the peaks of all of the significant absorption lines .    throughout this paper",
    ", we shall be expressing all results concerning the line widths in terms of the equivalent temperature , denoted as @xmath82 , when the line width is assumed to be due to thermal broadening : @xmath83 k. this allows for an easier comparison of the results of numerical simulations and observations .",
    "note that line widths have usually been presented in the literature in terms of the doppler parameter , @xmath84 .",
    "an important property of this algorithm is that the distribution of line widths it measures should converge to a fixed answer as the signal - to - noise ratio of the observations is increased . in the limit of negligible noise and pixel size , and perfect resolution , every true minimum of the transmitted flux in the spectrum should be identified , and the fitted line width should reflect the second derivative around the minimum , because the size of the fitting window around each minimum should be very small . moreover , the second derivative around minima is a physically well motivated quantity to obtain the gas temperature .",
    "in contrast , the voigt profile fitting method does not converge at high signal - to - noise ratio because the number of blends assumed in an absorption system will change . whereas the voigt profile method attempts to fit the entire spectrum by superposing lines , our new method fits only small regions around the minima of transmitted flux as arising from a single absorber .",
    "we now apply our method to 1500 randomly selected lines of sight through the simulation output at @xmath47 , with the mean flux decrement , noise level and pixel size set to match the observations at @xmath85 ( see paper i  ) .",
    "we first set the two parameters of the line - fitting algorithm to @xmath77 and @xmath86 ( we shall analyze the optimal values of these parameters in  4.2 ) .",
    "a total of 6378 lines are identified and successfully fitted . for each absorption line",
    "we obtain four quantities : the optical depth at the line center , @xmath73 ; the doppler parameter converted to temperature units , @xmath82 ; the optical - depth - weighted temperature at the central pixel , @xmath87 ; and the optical - depth - weighted gas density at the central pixel , @xmath45 .",
    "figure [ dtscatter1](a ) shows @xmath88 vs. @xmath73 for all 6378 fitted lines .",
    "the solid lines at @xmath89 k and @xmath90 k are to guide the eye in evaluating the contribution of non - thermal broadening to @xmath82 .",
    "the noise that has been added to the simulated spectra ( see  2.2.1 ) is responsible for most of the absorption lines with @xmath91 . in figure [ dtscatter1](b )",
    "we show the fitted lines from the same set of spectra as figure [ dtscatter1](a ) , but without adding noise ( although the noise level that each pixel should have was still used to weight the @xmath70 fits ) ; the small number of lines that had @xmath91 in the presence of noise have been almost entirely eliminated ( the few remaining lines with @xmath91 arise because the optical - depth - averaged temperature at the central pixel of a line can be skewed by a contribution from very hot gas ) .",
    "figure [ dtscatter1 ] demonstrates that the contribution to @xmath82 from fluid motions is generally large , and therefore the doppler parameter of an individual line will usually overestimate the gas temperature . for @xmath92 ,",
    "the distribution of @xmath88 extends to values as low as @xmath93 k , implying that the lower cutoff in the @xmath82 distribution should provide a good measure of the median gas temperature at a given @xmath73 [ assuming that the lowest gas temperatures do not extend very much below the median value , as is true in the simulation ( fig .",
    "1 ) ] . however , for weak lines ( @xmath94 ) , thermal broadening is never clearly dominating , preventing a model - independent estimate of the gas temperature at the correspondingly low gas densities .",
    "the reason why the breadth of weak lines is always dominated by motions is that all the low density gas has not turned around from the hubble expansion .",
    "the eight histograms in figure [ dthist ] , constructed from the same fitted lines as figure [ dtscatter1](a ) , show more quantitatively the cutoff on the @xmath88 distribution near @xmath89 , for different optical depths . in the @xmath95 and @xmath96 panels of the figure ,",
    "the problem of estimating the temperature of the lower density gas is clearly seen . over the range @xmath97",
    ", the distribution of @xmath88 is the desirable one for our temperature measurement : there are many lines near @xmath89 , but very few with @xmath91 .",
    "the sharpness of the cutoff in figure [ dthist ] should of course be degraded in the observable @xmath82 distribution , owing to the scatter in the temperatures of the lines .",
    "figure [ tththists ] shows histograms of @xmath82 along with histograms of @xmath87 . by observing the histogram of @xmath82 we would like to determine the median of @xmath87 . for @xmath98 , the cutoff on the distribution of @xmath82 appears to coincide well with the peak of the distribution of @xmath87 . as we saw clearly in figure [ dtscatter1 ] , the number of lines with @xmath99 decreases quickly for @xmath100 .",
    "it is interesting to note in figure [ tththists ] the change in the distribution of the true temperature in the simulation with @xmath73 . at low optical depth ,",
    "the @xmath87 distribution is very narrow as a result of the simplicity of the evolution history of gas at low density , which generally expands peacefully in the voids , heated by photoionization and cooled adiabatically by its expansion .",
    "as the density increases , the heating history of the gas becomes more heterogeneous .",
    "the gas at higher densities is shock - heated more frequently and to a greater degree , and the evolution of the density itself since reionization ( when the initial temperature is set ) is more highly variable .",
    "for @xmath101 the range of gas temperatures increases , making the interpretation of the cutoff on the @xmath82 distribution more ambiguous .",
    "the two parameters of the line fitter , @xmath67 and @xmath76 , should be optimized to give the best statistical error bars on the location of the lower cutoff of the distribution of @xmath82 , which we will use to estimate the gas temperature .",
    "in order to do this optimization , we define a quality measure , @xmath102 , where @xmath103 and @xmath104 are the number of fitted lines with @xmath105 k , and with @xmath106 k , respectively . basically , @xmath107 is a measure of the statistical significance of the increase in the number of lines as the @xmath108 cutoff is crossed , computed by comparing the number of lines in bins of width 3000k on each side of the cutoff .",
    "the larger the value of @xmath107 , the more accurately we should be able to determine the temperature .",
    "for example , the set of fitted lines shown in figures [ dtscatter1]-[tththists ] ( fitted using @xmath77 and @xmath109 ) gives @xmath110 and @xmath111 , resulting in @xmath112 .",
    "when we remove the noise in figure [ dtscatter1](b ) we find @xmath113 and @xmath114 , yielding @xmath115 .",
    "we use a bin width of @xmath116 k because the errors in the measured temperature from our data will be of about this magnitude ( see  6 ) .",
    "table [ qchanges ] shows the @xmath107 values for a broad range of values of @xmath67 , and @xmath117 .",
    "we also list the @xmath107 value using two different values of @xmath76 , removing the noise from the spectra , removing the continuum fitting approximation , and using different random seeds for the added noise .",
    "we find that the changes in @xmath107 are usually smaller than the changes that can result from simply using a different set of random numbers for the noise that is added to the spectra .",
    "we conclude that the precise values taken by the parameters are not actually very important to the results .",
    "we use @xmath77 and @xmath86 when we analyze spectra matching the @xmath85 observational properties in the rest of this paper . from the range of @xmath67 with @xmath107 close to its maximum",
    ", we chose the smallest value of @xmath67 , @xmath77 , because we expect that increasing the number of accepted lines will make the analysis procedure more robust , particularly the computation of the error bars .",
    "we use two other redshift bins for the observational data ( see  2.1 ) , @xmath28 and @xmath26 . because the mean flux decrement , pixel size , and noise level are different in each bin , we determine a best value of @xmath67 separately for each .",
    "tests similar to the one in table [ qchanges ] , using the mean flux decrement , noise level , and pixel size matching the observations in the high and low @xmath118 bins , show that @xmath119 and @xmath120 are the best values to use when analyzing data in the @xmath28 and @xmath26 bins , respectively , although the values of @xmath107 obtained are only weakly sensitive to @xmath67 in each case .",
    "we fix @xmath86 at all three redshifts , because changing it does not significantly increase @xmath107 .",
    "in this section we combine our line fitting method with elements of the method of @xcite for constraining the temperature of the igm by measuring the lower cutoff on the distribution of @xmath82 .",
    "first we define the cutoff and how we associate it with an estimated temperature .",
    "then we use the simulation to translate the observed temperature - optical depth relation into the desired @xmath41 relation .",
    "all the results in this section are obtained from the simulation . in  6 we present results for the temperature measured from the observational data , using the method described in this section .",
    "@xcite presented a useful technique for quantifying the lower cutoff on a @xmath82 histogram like those in figure [ tththists ] .",
    "they smooth the histogram with a gaussian filter and define the cutoff to be the location of the maximum of the first derivative of the smoothed histogram .",
    "this derivative is given by @xmath121~ , \\label{difeq}\\ ] ] where the @xmath122th bin has temperature @xmath123 , @xmath124 is the label for @xmath125 individual fitted absorption lines with fitted temperature @xmath126 , and @xmath127 is the smoothing length .",
    "we plot in figure [ smoothhist1 ] the smooth histogram of @xmath82 and its derivative , as well as the smoothed histogram of the gas temperature , for @xmath128 k , using spectra from the @xmath47 simulation output with the @xmath85 observational noise , pixel size and mean flux decrement .",
    "we define the doppler parameter cutoff , @xmath129 , to be the value of @xmath82 where @xmath130 , given by equation ( [ difeq ] ) , is maximum , for the optical depth bin labeled by @xmath73 .",
    "our estimate of the gas temperature at optical depth @xmath73 is @xmath129 , after applying a small correction that we describe in detail in the remainder of this section .",
    "we compute error bars on the location of the cutoff on the @xmath82 distribution ( @xmath21 ) by bootstrap resampling @xcite .",
    "we generate a bootstrap realization of the @xmath82 histogram , for an optical depth bin containing @xmath125 fitted lines , by selecting @xmath125 lines at random from those in the bin ( with replacement ) and recomputing the histogram from the new set of lines .",
    "the error on @xmath21 is given by the dispersion in the @xmath21 values measured from many bootstrap realizations of the histogram .      in this subsection",
    "we investigate the relationship between @xmath129 and the physical temperature , @xmath87 , of the absorbers with central optical depth @xmath73 .",
    "we use spectra from the simulation , where we know the optical - depth - weighted temperature and density , @xmath87 and @xmath131 , of the absorption lines .",
    "we match the simulated spectra to the mean flux decrement , noise level and pixel size of the observations at @xmath85 ( see  2.2.1 ) . in ",

    "then , we compute the median central optical depth and gas temperature of the set of absorption lines that satisfy @xmath133k , in each optical depth bin .",
    "these sets of lines are the ones that actually determine the location of the cutoff in the @xmath82 histogram , so we examine first the relation between @xmath21 and their median temperature , which we denote by @xmath134 .",
    "the values of @xmath21 are shown as crosses with error bars .",
    ", comparable to the flux correlation length in the spectra ( paper i  ) .",
    "obtaining better statistics of the theoretical prediction for @xmath21 would require a larger simulation .",
    "however , for the analysis in the present paper the errors in the determination of the temperature from the observations are much larger . ]",
    "the temperature @xmath134 is shown as the filled squares ( the errors on the temperature are much smaller than those on @xmath21 )",
    ".    the triangles in figure [ firsttest ] show the effect on the derived cutoff , @xmath21 , of reducing the histogram smoothing to @xmath135 k. there is no important difference with the crosses ( the error bars for this smaller smoothing are similar to those on the crosses ) . by experimenting with different values of @xmath127",
    ", we have found that @xmath21 is not affected if @xmath127 is reduced , although the error bars obtained are significantly larger when reducing it below @xmath136 .",
    "increasing @xmath127 beyond @xmath137 leads to an increase of @xmath21 , because the smoothing is then larger than the intrinsic sharpness of the cutoff in the @xmath82 distribution .",
    "we therefore adopt @xmath128k from this point forward in the paper .",
    "the open squares show the effect of using _ all _ the absorption lines in every optical depth bin to compute the median temperature and optical depth , rather than using lines with @xmath133k only .",
    "there is a negligible difference in the derived temperature of the absorbers as a function of @xmath73 ; the reason is that , as we have previously seen , broader lines are by and large systems with higher fluid velocity dispersions , but their gas temperatures are not significantly greater , except at the highest optical depths where there is a slight difference ( the systematic shift to the right of the open squares relative to the filled ones is due to a larger median optical depth of the broad lines within each optical depth bin ) . in the rest of the paper , we always compute the medians of any properties of the absorption lines using only lines with @xmath133k .",
    "so far , we have seen that the doppler parameter cutoff @xmath21 provides a good estimator for the gas temperature of absorption systems at a given optical depth .",
    "our ultimate goal , however , is to measure the median gas temperature at a given gas density , for randomly selected points in the igm , which we shall henceforth refer to as @xmath138 .",
    "the peaks in absorption are at special locations , so their median temperature , @xmath134 , will generally not be exactly the same as @xmath138 . to examine this question ,",
    "we first compute the median density of the absorption lines in each optical depth bin , and then we calculate the median temperature of randomly selected points at this gas density . the result is shown as the dashed line in figure [ firsttest ] ; the dotted lines give the 25 and 75 percentiles of the temperature distribution at random points with the same gas density . comparing the dashed line to the filled squares",
    ", we see that the fitted absorption lines with relatively large optical depth typically have @xmath139 , i.e. , they are colder than random fluid elements at the same density .",
    "we believe the reason for this effect is the characteristic double - shock structure around the absorbers @xcite : the gas in the highest density tube along a filament ( or the highest density surface along a sheet ) is located between shocks , so it has been subject to less shock - heating than the surrounding gas .",
    "our method of analysis of the observational data in  6 will automatically correct for this difference between the temperature of the absorption lines and the temperature at random points .",
    "this systematic difference may introduce a potential uncertainty in the derivation of the gas temperature if it depends on quantities like the resolution of the simulation , the cosmological model that is assumed , or the heating at the reionization epoch .",
    "however , the temperature difference between lines and random points is negligible compared to the observational errors we will compute for the temperature in  6 , at least in the simulation we analyze here .      we need to test the robustness of the finding that @xmath140 for @xmath141 , which we have established so far in tests on the @xmath47 simulation output .",
    "we can change the @xmath41 relation that we are measuring by simply using the @xmath142 or @xmath143 outputs from the simulation ( see table [ basesimtdbtab ] ) , still creating spectra with mean flux , noise level , and pixel size matching the @xmath85 observations , as described in  2.2.1 .",
    "in addition to the varying @xmath41 relations , these spectra have different amplitudes of fluctuations , and different hubble constants .    figure [ testdifredz3 ]",
    "shows the comparison between @xmath129 and @xmath144 , using the @xmath142 and @xmath143 outputs of the simulation in addition to @xmath47 .",
    "the ( _ pentagons , squares , triangles _ ) show @xmath21 for the @xmath36(4 , 3 , 2 ) simulation output , and the ( _ solid , long - dashed , short - dashed _ )",
    "line show @xmath144 .",
    "we see that @xmath21 traces the temperature changes at the different redshifts extremely well , tracking the different slopes at @xmath142 and @xmath143 perfectly , and matching the increased overall temperature at @xmath47 .",
    "all three redshift outputs show the same strong increase in @xmath21 above the actual temperature for optical depths below unity , corresponding to @xmath145 in each case .",
    "we have seen that @xmath21 traces @xmath134 remarkably well for the mean flux decrement and noise level of our observational data at @xmath147 .",
    "we shall now verify that this is also true when the flux decrement and noise is set to the values appropriate for the other two redshift bins in which we separate the data , at @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "we first introduce a new type of figure that shows more clearly how accurately @xmath129 traces the gas temperature .",
    "figure [ testerrz3](a ) shows @xmath150 , where @xmath138 is the median temperature of random points at the density of each optical depth bin ( recall that this density is defined as the median density of absorption lines in each optical depth bin that have @xmath133k ) .",
    "the ( _ pentagons , squares , triangles _ ) are obtained from the simulation outputs at @xmath36(4 , 3 , 2 ) , and are the same points as in figure [ testdifredz3 ] except that we have subtracted @xmath138 .",
    "the temperature is correctly traced by @xmath21 at @xmath92 , and drops below @xmath21 at lower optical depths in the same way , independently of which simulation output we use . at @xmath151 , @xmath21 falls significantly below the temperature in the @xmath142 output ( this is seen clearly using more optical depth bins ) .",
    "the reason is that the temperature dispersion is higher at @xmath142 in the simulation , causing @xmath21 to reflect the lower cutoff of the true temperature distribution .",
    "the results when we fix the mean flux decrement and noise to the @xmath152 redshift bin of the observational data ( taken from paper i  ) are shown in figure [ testerrz3](b ) . here",
    ", we use the parameters @xmath119 and @xmath86 for the line fitting algorithm ( see  3 ) . the results are shown also using all three simulation outputs .",
    "again , we find the temperature is well traced by @xmath21 , but over a range of @xmath73 that has shifted to lower values . this is a result of the decreased optical depth at fixed gas density .",
    "absorption systems that are primarily thermally broadened exist above a gas density that is approximately constant at each redshift , but the corresponding optical depth varies rapidly with redshift . at high optical depths ,",
    "an additional effect is important in changing the degree to which @xmath21 traces the gas temperature : the increased shock - heating at low redshifts ( with increasing velocities of collapse ) implies a higher temperature dispersion , even at a fixed gas density .",
    "therefore , @xmath21 drops further below the median gas temperature as the redshift decreases .    the result for @xmath153",
    "is shown in figure [ testerrz3](c ) ( we use @xmath120 at this redshift ) .",
    "the doppler parameter cutoff ( @xmath21 ) now traces the temperature only at high optical depth , @xmath154 , for exactly the same reason : a fixed gas density has shifted to a significantly higher optical depth due to the increase in the mean flux decrement .",
    "so far , we have seen that the doppler parameter cutoff traces the gas temperature over a reasonable range of optical depth .",
    "we have shown this to be a consequence of the presence of some absorption lines that are primarily thermally broadened , and of the small dispersion of the gas temperature .",
    "we therefore expect that this relation between @xmath21 and @xmath138 will not be significantly changed depending on the model adopted in the simulation , or when the numerical resolution is increased .",
    "however , even over a restricted range of optical depth where @xmath21 and @xmath138 are best matched , the simulation predicts a difference between them , which we want to correct for when analyzing the observational data ( although this correction could be model dependent , and will need to be compared with other simulations in future work ) .",
    "in addition , we need to relate the central optical depth @xmath73 to the optical - depth - weighted gas density of the absorber , @xmath156 , in order to derive the @xmath41 relation of the gas from the observed @xmath21 as a function of @xmath73 . given the limited amount of data that we will analyze in this paper , it will be sufficient to parameterize the @xmath41 relation by a power - law , @xmath157 where @xmath53 is chosen to make the error on @xmath54 and @xmath55 uncorrelated . as discussed in  2.2.2 , this power - law",
    "should be understood only as a fit to the true relation , which should be more complex",
    ". the power - law form will be adequate here given our error bars , but larger sets of data might be used to detect deviations from a power - law .    in this subsection",
    "we develop the method to derive the parameters @xmath158 and @xmath51 , given the determination of @xmath21 at different optical depths .",
    "to obtain an accurate estimate of the gas temperature from observations , the systematic differences between @xmath21 and @xmath138 shown in figure [ testerrz3 ] can be used to correct the observed @xmath21 . however , this correction may be dependent on the model , and this dependence will not be known until a wide variety of additional simulations are analyzed .",
    "we therefore use only absorption lines over the range of @xmath73 where the offset between @xmath21 and @xmath138 is small ( @xmath159k for all three simulation outputs ) .",
    "the following optical depth ranges will be used : @xmath160 for @xmath28 , @xmath161 for @xmath27 , and @xmath162 for @xmath26 .    for each fitted line obtained from the observations ( within the accepted optical depth range ) ,",
    "we determine a temperature correction at the optical depth of the line by linearly interpolating from the two adjacent points in figure [ testerrz3 ] .",
    "the set of points used depends on the redshift bin of the observations and the simulation output we choose for the analysis .",
    "the corrected line width is @xmath163 , where @xmath82 is the observed line width , @xmath164 , @xmath165 is the cutoff of the @xmath82 distribution in the simulation , and @xmath166 is the median temperature in the simulation at random points with gas density equal to the median density of the absorption lines satisfying @xmath167k .      after the corrections just described , we have an estimate of the temperature as a function of @xmath73 . what we need , however , is the temperature as a function of @xmath45 .",
    "this will be derived by using a transformation from @xmath73 to @xmath45 that we obtain from the simulation .",
    "this introduces an inevitable model dependence in our measurement : the relation between @xmath73 and @xmath45 , given a fixed flux decrement , should essentially be subject to the same uncertainties that appear in deriving the parameter @xmath168 ( where @xmath169 is the photoionization rate due to the cosmic background ) from the observed mean flux decrement ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* , paper i  ) .",
    "figure [ dbtaucor ] is a scatter plot of the density and optical depth of the lines fitted from the @xmath47 simulation output ( with mean flux decrement matching the @xmath47 observations ) .",
    "the crosses show @xmath45 vs. @xmath73 for all of the lines , while the filled squares show only lines satisfying @xmath167k , where @xmath129 was determined for 10 optical depth bins as described earlier .",
    "the lines that determine the @xmath82 cutoff ( shown as squares ) tend to have a higher optical depth than other lines at the same density , because of their lower velocity dispersion .    to obtain the @xmath170 relation ,",
    "we assign the median density of the lines in each optical depth bin that we use to measure the temperature ( i.e. , those with @xmath167k ) with the median @xmath73 of the same lines .",
    "we use interpolation to calculate the density corresponding to any value of @xmath73 for the fitted lines in the observed spectra .",
    "one of the quantities affecting the @xmath171 relationship is the density - temperature relation itself , essentially because the temperature affects the recombination coefficient , which then changes the neutral fraction at a given density . in order for our determination of the @xmath41 relation to be self - consistent",
    ", we need to change the temperatures in the simulation so that they agree with the same @xmath41 relation .",
    "we do this in the following way : after determining a preliminary @xmath41 relation using the simulation with the true temperatures , we modify the temperature in every cell of the simulation using the formula @xmath172 where @xmath173 is the original temperature at cell @xmath122 , @xmath174 is the modified temperature , @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the parameters of the original @xmath41 relation of the simulation , and @xmath175 and @xmath176 are the parameters of the new @xmath41 relation that we wish to impose .",
    "we then iterate the application of this formula until the modified @xmath41 relation of the simulation matches the one from the observations .",
    "this modification of the temperatures in the simulation causes only a small change in the derived @xmath41 relation ( the value of @xmath50 is modified by only @xmath177% ) .",
    "we now describe the method we use to fit the parameters @xmath54 and @xmath55 to the values of @xmath45 and @xmath178 of a set of fitted lines .",
    "the simplest method would be to separate the lines in density bins , measure the cutoff @xmath21 in every bin , and then fit the power - law relation to the values of @xmath21 obtained at every bin .",
    "however , the binning could result in a degradation of the measurement errors : at least 50 lines are needed to obtain a reasonable estimate of the cutoff @xmath21 , and since our data yield only a few hundred lines for each redshift bin , the binning in line density would need to be very coarse .",
    "there is a simple solution to this binning problem if the cutoff on the distribution of fitted lines , in the @xmath179 plane , is described by a power - law ( recall that @xmath178 is the width of each fitted profile minus the expected non - thermal broadening at its optical depth , as described in  5.4.1 ) .",
    "after we have associated a gas density @xmath45 with each fitted line and corrected their temperatures using the simulation predictions , we rotate the absorption lines in the @xmath179 plane for many different assumed values of @xmath55 , using the formula @xmath180 for each assumed @xmath55 , we apply the cutoff determination technique to the @xmath181 distribution ( without density binning ) to find a value for the temperature and a maximum value for @xmath130 [ see eq .",
    "( [ difeq ] ) ] . as @xmath55 is varied , the best fit value of @xmath55 is the one that results in the maximum value of @xmath130 , i.e. , the sharpest cutoff on the @xmath181 distribution .",
    "note that the value of @xmath54 used in equation ( [ rotatet ] ) affects the size of the temperature changes in the rotation .",
    "we therefore also iterate in the determination of @xmath54 and @xmath51 by this procedure . in practice ,",
    "the measurement of @xmath54 is barely affected by the rotation in equation ( [ rotatet ] ) , so a single iteration is sufficient .    before presenting the results of applying our method to the observations",
    ", it will be useful at this point to summarize the full procedure we have described for measuring @xmath54 and @xmath55 from the @xmath82 distribution of the fitted absorption lines at every redshift bin .",
    "this consists of the following steps : + 1 .",
    "eliminate the absorption lines with @xmath73 outside the range where the temperature measurement is expected to be effective .",
    "correct the values of @xmath82 for all of the remaining lines using the systematic offset predicted by the simulation ( figure [ testerrz3 ] ) .",

    "+ 4 . determine an initial estimate for @xmath54 and @xmath55 with the method of fitting the power - law cutoff in the @xmath82 distribution as a function of @xmath73 that was just described .",
    "modify the @xmath41 relation in the simulation to more closely approximate the relation measured from the observations .",
    "repeat steps 2 - 5 until the @xmath41 relation measured from the observations matches the relation in the simulation .",
    "we now apply our line - fitting method to the observed spectra .",
    "table [ basicobsstats ] lists , for each redshift bin , the redshift range ( @xmath183 to @xmath184 ) and mean redshift @xmath185 , the mean flux decrement @xmath186 , the mean noise , the total number of pixels , the total path length , the value of @xmath67 we use to fit the lines , the total number of lines fitted , and the number of lines that we actually use to measure the gas temperature in the range of central optical depth from @xmath187 to @xmath188 .",
    "the parameters @xmath189 of all the fitted lines are shown in figure [ z3obsscatter](a , b , c ) for the redshift bins @xmath1(3.9 , 3.0 , 2.4 ) , as outlined crosses when the lines are not in any of the regions suspected to include metal lines , and as simple crosses when they are . for the quasar kp 77 ( included in the redshift bin @xmath190 ) ,",
    "the analysis to identify potential metal lines was not done , so all lines from this quasar are shown as outlined crosses .",

    "the vertical dotted lines indicate the optical depth range that we use for the final temperature measurement ( for the @xmath26 analysis , the upper limit on @xmath73 is outside of the figure , and eliminates a negligible number of lines ) .",

    "each bin in optical depth would be associated with the density listed in table [ bigtab ] , and the value of @xmath21 would be corrected by the listed @xmath192 .",

    "the different redshift outputs of the simulation are approximately equivalent to assuming different models with a different amplitude of the power spectrum ( paper i  ) , so we can use the different outputs to check that our measurement of the temperature is not greatly sensitive to the model that is assumed .",
    "paper i  found that the amplitude of the initial density perturbations in our simulation needs to be reduced by about 15% to agree with the observed power spectrum of the transmitted flux , meaning that the simulation output at @xmath143 has fluctuations that most closely match the observed ones at @xmath85 , and are slightly higher than the observed fluctuations at @xmath26 .",
    "the @xmath28 observational bin is closest in amplitude to the simulation output at @xmath47 .",
    "the most reliable temperature results should therefore be obtained by using the @xmath36(4 , 4 , 3 ) simulation outputs to analyze the @xmath1(3.9 , 3.0 , 2.4 ) observations , but we shall also give results for @xmath1(3.0 , 2.4 ) analyzed using the @xmath36(3 , 2 ) simulation outputs .",
    "the result at @xmath85 , using the @xmath143 simulation output to predict the @xmath193 relation and the necessary correction for non - thermal broadening , is : @xmath195\\left(\\frac{{\\delta_g}}{1.37\\pm 0.11}\\right)^{[0.29\\pm 0.30 ] }   { \\rm k}~,\\ ] ] where the error bars on @xmath54 and @xmath55 are uncorrelated ( which defines @xmath53 ) . the error bar on @xmath53 reflects only the uncertainty in the paper i  determination of the mean flux decrement , which affects the relation between density and optical depth .",
    "this result implies @xmath196k , where @xmath50 is the temperature at the mean density .",
    "the pivot density , @xmath197 , corresponds to an optical depth @xmath198 ( from the relation obtained as described in  5.4.2 ) when we repeat the fitting using the @xmath47 simulation output we find @xmath199({\\delta_g}/[1.24 \\pm 0.10])^{[0.33\\pm 0.28]}$]k , or @xmath200k ( @xmath201 ) .",
    "the difference between the two values for @xmath53 , 1.37 using the @xmath143 simulation , and 1.24 using the @xmath47 simulation , are mostly a reflection of the different optical depth normalizing factors ( i.e. , rescalings of the baryon density or the strength of the ionizing background ) needed to match the observed mean flux decrement .",
    "the normalizing factor is smaller for the @xmath143 simulation , giving a larger @xmath53 for the same optical depth , because the density fluctuations are of lower amplitude , leading to less saturated absorption and more absorption in voids ( see paper i  for a more detailed discussion of the optical depth normalizing factor ) .",
    "all the results obtained at the three redshift bins are listed in table [ plfittab ] .",
    "the data analysis at @xmath28 and @xmath26 is similar to the analysis at @xmath85 , except for the differences that we mention below .",
    "the temperature results at @xmath28 differ by @xmath202 k when the @xmath142 simulation output is used instead of the @xmath47 output , once the measured values of @xmath54 for the two are extrapolated to the same density .",
    "most of this difference results from the difference in @xmath53 , and the relatively high value of @xmath55 that is obtained at @xmath203 .",
    "the difference in @xmath53 is caused by the different amplitudes of density fluctuations in the two simulation outputs , so we expect that the temperature derived using the @xmath47 simulation output , which has the correct amplitude of fluctuations , is more reliable ( see paper i  ) .    in order to see the evolution of the temperature with redshift",
    ", we need to obtain the temperature at a fixed over - density at each redshift .",
    "it is useful to obtain the temperature at the mean density , @xmath50 , to compare our results to other work .",
    "however , the values of @xmath53 are close to @xmath204 at all three redshift bins , and we can therefore have a more robust result for the temperature evolution if we examine the temperature at @xmath204 , which we denote as @xmath16 in table [ plfittab ] .",
    "we note here that , because of the small range of optical depth used at @xmath26 , at this redshift we were forced to smooth the @xmath181 histograms with a gaussian filter of width @xmath205k , instead of our standard @xmath128k , in order to avoid problems with multiple , approximately equivalent , maxima of equation ( [ difeq ] ) as @xmath55 is varied .",
    "the primary results of this paper , the measurements of @xmath16 and @xmath55 , are summarized in figures [ tresultsfig ] and [ gmoresultsfig ] , respectively .",
    "these show two important conclusions : first , the temperatures are higher than the value expected if photoionization heating in equilibrium is the only heating source .",
    "second , we find no evidence for a rapid change of the temperature with redshift .",
    "this paper presents a measurement of the temperature - density relation of the intergalactic gas in the redshift range @xmath206 .",
    "the new method we have developed to perform this measurement is based on the same general idea as the previous work by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite : provided that there is a tight relation between the temperature and density of the gas , absorption lines of similar central optical depth should have little dispersion in their thermal broadening , and the varying line widths should correspond to variable amounts of hydrodynamic broadening . occasionally , some absorption lines will be subject to only a small degree of hydrodynamic broadening ; this will typically happen when most of the atomic hydrogen occurs near a velocity caustic along the line of sight .",
    "we therefore expect the histogram of line widths to show a rapid increase near the value of the doppler parameter corresponding to the gas temperature . in the absence of noise",
    ", every line should be wider than the thermal broadening width , so at least an upper limit to the temperature can be obtained unambiguously .",
    "the tests we have performed using a numerical simulation of the ly@xmath0 forest , based on a cdm model that successfully reproduces the observations of large - scale structure at present , confirm this general idea .",
    "however , they show that this method to recover the gas temperature works efficiently only over a limited range of line optical depths , which corresponds approximately to a range of gas over - density @xmath207 . at lower densities ,",
    "the gas is generally in hubble expansion and this effect dominates the contribution to the line widths in essentially all the lines .",
    "the minimum line widths can therefore only provide an upper limit to the temperature of this low - density gas .",
    "of course , the simulation can in principle be used to correct for the effect of line broadening due to hubble expansion , and to obtain the temperature by subtracting the hydrodynamic contribution to the minimum line widths . however",
    ", the results can then strongly depend on the assumed model and the numerical resolution of the simulation , especially as the thermal broadening becomes a small effect compared to the expansion .    at very high densities , the increasing dispersion of the temperature at a given gas density can result in a large difference between the typical gas temperature and the `` lower cutoff '' in the line width histogram .",
    "this implies again that the recovery of the median gas temperature from the distribution of line widths is highly sensitive to the model assumptions that affect the temperature dispersion and the turbulent motions in the gas .",
    "there are two main differences between the method we use to measure the gas temperature , and that used by previous authors .",
    "first , our line detection algorithm avoids the necessity of the voigt - profile fitting method to `` deblend '' lines , by simply throwing out any `` absorption lines '' that do not correspond to a clearly identified minimum in the transmitted flux , or that do not have a large enough region around that minimum that is adequately fitted by a simple gaussian in optical depth . in the method we use here ,",
    "every line width is essentially a measurement of the second derivative around a minimum in the flux .",
    "this is one important reason why the total number of lines we identify is much lower than @xcite , even though we use nearly the same data set .",
    "the second difference is that we restrict the absorption lines we use to lie within the range of central optical depth where the correction that needs to be applied to the temperature measured from the histogram of line widths ( as described in  5.4.1 ) is small .",
    "these differences explain our substantially increased error bars in measuring @xmath50 and @xmath51 , relative to those of @xcite . however , we believe our error bars are more reliable and model - independent , for the reasons we have discussed .",
    "we also note here that , even though we can not rule out a substantial change of the temperature we have measured depending on the numerical simulation of the ly@xmath0 forest that is used for comparing to the observational data , this possibility appears unlikely for several reasons , in addition to the arguments explained before about the small size of the correction @xmath192 that needs to be applied to the line width cutoff @xmath208 to obtain the gas temperature ( see  5.4.1 ) .",
    "the gas temperature of the simulation we use is lower than that observed only by a small amount : in the simulation , the temperature at the mean density is @xmath50=(14000 , 15800 , 12800)k at @xmath36(4 , 3 , 2 ) , while our measurement from the observational data is @xmath209 , @xmath210 , @xmath211)k for @xmath1(3.9 , 3.0 , 2.4 ) .",
    "the amplitude of the flux power spectrum of the simulation is also very close to the observationally determined one ( paper i  ) .",
    "we have also shown that we obtain nearly identical results for the temperature measurement when using different simulation outputs to analyze the same observations ( see figures [ tresultsfig ] and [ gmoresultsfig ] ) meaning that the dependence on the amplitude of the power spectrum is weak .",
    "our result for the gas temperature might also be affected by the limited resolution of the simulation we use ( with a comoving cell size of @xmath212 kpc ) .",
    "we have not yet performed a convergence test for the effects of resolution on the ly@xmath0 forest ; however , @xcite find that a mean particle spacing of @xmath213 kpc in their sph simulations is sufficient for convergence .",
    "we now compare our results for the evolution of the gas temperature with previous measurements .",
    "@xcite find a temperature at the mean density ( from their figure 12b ) @xmath214(@xmath215 , @xmath216 , @xmath217)k , at @xmath218 ( 3.6 , 2.75 , 1.9 ) .",
    "considering their large statistical error bars , our results appear to agree well with theirs , although the true temperature at @xmath219 must be at the low end of their error bar .",
    "@xcite give their temperature results as 16 separate points , in their figure 5 .",
    "we read off their points in each of our redshift bins and create error weighted averages for comparison with our results , finding @xmath220(@xmath221 , @xmath222 , @xmath223 ) at @xmath224(3.75 , 3.2 , 2.4 ) . in order to compare these with our temperatures , which have lower errors at @xmath204",
    ", we extrapolate the @xcite results to @xmath204 using their measured value of @xmath55 , obtaining @xmath225k at @xmath226 .",
    "our result at @xmath26 , @xmath227k , is higher than theirs by @xmath228 . because of this",
    ", we do not find evidence for the increase of the temperature with time between @xmath143 and @xmath47 that @xcite reported .",
    "our results are consistent with a constant temperature .",
    "actually , the data set analyzed by @xcite is almost identical to the one we analyze in this paper , with 7 of the 10 quasars used in the two papers being identical .",
    "however , our methods of analysis are very different , so that even the statistical error bars from the two analysis are largely independent .",
    "the main difference , as mentioned before , is in the number of lines that are identified .",
    "for example , we use 98 lines to measure the temperature in our @xmath229 bin , while @xcite use about 550 lines in a comparable bin , even though @xmath230 80% of the data that they use is identical to ours .",
    "is the value of the temperature we have measured in agreement with the known sources of heating and cooling in the intergalactic gas ?",
    "the evolution of the temperature is determined by the equation : @xmath231 where the cooling and heating rates per particle are denoted as follows : @xmath232 is the heating by photoionization , @xmath233 is the heating by photoionization , @xmath234 is the cooling off the microwave background , @xmath235 is the cooling by recombination , @xmath236 is the cooling by free - free emission , and @xmath237 is the cooling due to line excitation and collisional ionization .",
    "we have separated the terms for and photoionization because plays a dominant role for heating , but the other cooling terms include both hydrogen and helium .",
    "to see what the important terms for the thermal balance of the igm are , we now evaluate all the heating and cooling terms at the conditions where we have measured the temperature most accurately : a temperature @xmath238 k at a gas density @xmath15 , at @xmath47 .",
    "it is convenient to define the quantities @xmath239 , for each subscript corresponding to every heating and cooling term .",
    "we assume the model @xmath240 , @xmath241 , @xmath242 , and @xmath243 .",
    "we evaluate first the total cooling : the dominant term is adiabatic cooling , which is equal to @xmath244 on the right - hand - side of equation ( [ tbal ] ) if we assume a rate of expansion equal to the hubble rate ( i.e. , a constant @xmath131 ) .",
    "this assumption is of course not exact ; every gas element expands at a different rate , causing a dispersion in the temperature - density relation .",
    "however , at a density @xmath15 , the average rate of expansion is in fact not very different from the hubble rate .",
    "in addition , when we consider the evolution of the temperature at a fixed @xmath131 , the @xmath245 term in the total temperature derivative of the left - hand - side of equation ( [ tbal ] ) should partly compensate for the effect of expansion ( canceling it exactly if @xmath246 ) .    the next most important contribution is cooling off the microwave background , which is given by @xmath247 ( where @xmath248 is the thompson cross section , @xmath249 the electron mass , @xmath250 the electron density , and @xmath251 the total particle density ) . notice that this term becomes more important at higher redshift , growing as @xmath252 .",
    "we compute the other cooling rates using the formulae given in @xcite .",
    "recombination yields @xmath253 , and free - free emission @xmath254 .",
    "the atomic processes of line cooling and collisional ionization are completely negligible at this low density , for the photoionization rate @xmath255 that is obtained from the observed abundance of quasars .",
    "the total cooling rate is therefore @xmath256 .",
    "if this temperature is being kept roughly constant , as indicated by the measurement we have presented here , then the heating terms should approximately balance the total cooling .    to evaluate the heating rate ,",
    "we first assume ionization equilibrium ; we will discuss later how the heating from can be increased if the reionization is still in progress .",
    "the heating term due to ionization can then be expressed in terms of the recombination rate : @xmath257 , and the analogous expression for , where @xmath258 and @xmath259 are the recombination coefficient and the number density of hydrogen , and @xmath260 is the mean energy of the absorbed photons minus the ionization potential .",
    "the mean energy @xmath260 depends on the spectrum of the ionizing background , and we evaluate it as follows : assuming a background intensity per unit frequency @xmath261 from the ionization edge at @xmath262 to some maximum frequency @xmath263 , and approximating also the photoionization cross section as @xmath264 , we find @xmath265 ~,\\ ] ] where @xmath266 is the ionization potential .",
    "we use @xmath267 and @xmath268 for both and , which adequately approximates the shape of the spectrum found in numerical calculations when the emitted spectrum is a quasar power - law ( with @xmath269 ) , and the effect of absorption by lyman limit systems is taken into account @xcite .",
    "this yields @xmath270 and @xmath271 .",
    "we then obtain : @xmath272 , and @xmath273 .",
    "the total heating therefore falls short to compensate for cooling by a factor @xmath274 .",
    "an obvious way to increase the heating rate is to assume that the reionization is not yet complete ; in other words , that there are patches of low - density gas in the igm where all the helium is in the form of .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , there are two reasons why the heating rate is higher during the reionization , relative to the case of photoionization equilibrium .",
    "the first is that the ionization rate needs to be higher simply because every ion needs to be ionized once during the course of the reionization .",
    "the second is that _ all _ the hard photons will now be absorbed by a random ion in the igm , up to the frequency @xmath263 where the mean - free - path through the igm reaches the horizon length .",
    "for the baryon density we use and at @xmath47 , and assuming also that about 50% of all the helium is in the form of in the diffuse igm ( and not in dense clouds having a small covering factor over the hubble length ) , this maximum frequency is given by @xmath275 , i.e. , a frequency 13 times higher than the ionization edge .",
    "the mean energy of the absorbed photons is therefore equal to the mean energy of the emitted photons up to this maximum frequency , _ without _ weighting them with the photoionization cross section : @xmath276 ~,\\ ] ] where the subscript @xmath277 in @xmath278 indicates the mean energy per absorption during reionization , and the emitted spectrum from sources is @xmath279 . for @xmath275 and @xmath280",
    ", we obtain @xmath281 . since the recombination rate for at the mean density is equal to @xmath282 times the hubble rate @xmath283 at @xmath47 , and if the reionization is occurring over @xmath230 a hubble time near @xmath49 , it is reasonable to expect that the additional heating rate due to reionization is comparable to the heating rate due to balancing recombinations of .",
    "we therefore conclude that the heating from reionization can reasonably account for the igm temperature we have determined here",
    ".      one of the applications that the development of the new theory of the ly@xmath0 forest based on structure formation has had is to provide a measurement of the baryon density through its effect on the mean transmitted flux . for a fixed distribution of temperature , over - density , and peculiar velocities in the igm ,",
    "the ly@xmath0 optical depth at any point in the spectrum is proportional to @xmath284 , where @xmath285 is the photoionization rate due to the cosmic ionizing background . to be specific",
    ", we define the parameter @xmath286^{-1/2}~,\\ ] ] [ where we have used @xmath287 , which is highly accurate at the relevant redshifts and in a flat universe ] .",
    "as discussed by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and paper i  , a measurement of @xmath288 can be translated into a lower bound on @xmath289 by using the contribution to the ionizing background from known quasars as a lower bound on @xmath290 .",
    "this lower limit is on the high side of the range of @xmath291 that is allowed by primordial nucleosynthesis : @xmath292 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; paper i  ) .",
    "one of the main model uncertainties in deriving the relationship between the parameter @xmath288 and the predicted mean transmitted flux is the mean igm temperature .",
    "a higher temperature implies a lower recombination coefficient , and therefore a lower neutral hydrogen density .",
    "this implies that in order to reproduce a given observed mean transmitted flux , the mean density @xmath293 needs to be increased further to compensate the reduced recombination coefficient .",
    "the measurements of the igm temperature reported here and in @xcite , and @xcite , all coincide in finding temperatures that are high compared to what is expected if the igm is heated by photoionization and is in ionization equilibrium .",
    "as we have discussed , these higher temperatures can probably be understood as a result of the reionization .",
    "independently of its cause , the higher temperature implies an even higher value of @xmath288 than was obtained previously , which we can easily determine by modifying the temperature in the simulation to match the observations , as described earlier in  5.3 .",
    "we find that , when the temperature in the simulation is increased to match the observed one , the derived value of @xmath288 is increased slightly to @xmath294(@xmath295 , @xmath296 , @xmath297 ) at @xmath1(3.9 , 3.0 , 2.4 ) , from the previous values ( 0.0329 , 0.0274 , 0.0245 ) when the temperatures in the simulations are not modified ( paper i  ) .",
    "the errors are derived from the observational errors in the determination of the mean flux decrement from paper i  .",
    "changing the temperature of the simulation affects the value of @xmath288 not only by modifying the recombination coefficient , but by increasing the amount of thermal broadening , which can spread the absorption in saturated regions to the outskirts of absorption lines , increasing the mean absorption for a given @xmath288 .",
    "we find that the effect of thermal broadening is less important than the effect of the reduced recombination coefficient . as an example , if we replace @xmath298 in every pixel in the simulation , the inferred @xmath288 increases by 0.0017 ( where @xmath299 is the recombination coefficient ) , while the replacement @xmath300 changes @xmath288 by -0.00046 ( where @xmath301 is the dispersion of the gaussian thermal broadening ) .",
    "dynamical effects caused by the increased pressure of the gas would probably go in the same direction as the thermal broadening , since they would tend to spread the gas in absorption systems over wider regions .",
    "however , it seems unlikely that any such dynamical effects ( which can only be investigated by running the same simulation with different temperatures ) can be more important than the thermal broadening effect .",
    "the examples shown in @xcite ( see their figure 6 ) appear to confirm that the dynamical effects of increased pressure are not more important than the increased thermal broadening when the gas temperature is raised .    with the statistical error bars we have obtained on the @xmath41 relation , we can place more conservative lower bounds on @xmath288 than the ones obtained in paper i  .",
    "the lowest allowed value of @xmath288 needed to account for a given observed mean transmitted flux is obtained when @xmath54 is minimum and @xmath55 is maximum in equation ( 1 ) , because that yields the minimum temperature for the low - density gas that determines the optical depth in unsaturated regions of the ly@xmath0 spectrum .",
    "we set @xmath54 equal to the measured value minus twice the statistical error bar given in table [ plfittab ] , and @xmath302 , which is the value valid when the igm has been in photoionization equilibrium for a long time @xcite .",
    "any uniform heating of the igm , such as that caused by reionization , should give rise to a lower @xmath55 , although shock - heating can increase @xmath55 above @xmath303 , the simulations show that this happens only at high enough gas densities that the ly@xmath0 absorption is already saturated .",
    "the error in our observational determination of @xmath55 is too large to give us a better constraint than @xmath304 ( see table [ plfittab ] ) .",
    "the results of this exercise are @xmath305(0.0270 , 0.0192 , 0.0209 ) for @xmath1(3.9 , 3.0 , 2.4 ) , at 95% confidence , including the error from the mean flux decrement and the temperature measurements ( added in quadrature ) . using the lower bound obtained in @xcite of @xmath306 in the range @xmath307 , obtained by counting only radiation from the observed quasars , and",
    "not including the power - law extrapolation of the quasar luminosity function that has been observed only at redshifts @xmath308 , we obtain @xmath309 .",
    "this result is still consistent with the determinations of the deuterium abundance @xcite .",
    "however , if the quasar luminosity function extends to low luminosities with a similar power - law slope as observed at @xmath308 , or if emission from galaxies increases significantly the intensity of the ionizing background , then the higher baryon density implied would come into conflict with the primordial nucleosynthesis predictions and the observed deuterium abundance .    in summary",
    ", we have reached the following conclusions : + 1 .",
    "the temperature of the igm is @xmath310k at density 1.4 times the mean , independent of redshift , although an increase of @xmath311k from @xmath312 to @xmath313 can not be ruled out .",
    "the high temperature can not be explained by heating in ionization equilibrium , and probably indicates on - going reionization .",
    "the contribution of temperature uncertainty to the uncertainty in the baryon density required by the observed mean flux decrement in the ly@xmath0 forest is now well constrained .",
    "we thank adam steed and david weinberg for helpful comments on the manuscript .",
    "this algorithm has three input parameters that control how the fitting proceeds : @xmath67 sets the amount that the flux must increase from the center point to the edges of the window before a fit will be attempted , @xmath314 sets the minimum size of the window within which a fit is performed , and @xmath76 sets the quality of fit that will be accepted . in this paper",
    "we set @xmath315 .",
    "three more input parameters effect the speed of the code but are not important to the results : @xmath316 controls the degree of symmetry around a central pixel that is required for a fit to be attempted , @xmath317 sets the level of flux decrease , from the center pixel to the window edges , at which a point will be eliminated from consideration for fitting , and @xmath69 sets the maximum allowed window size .",

    "<S> the evolution of the temperature in the intergalactic medium is related to the reionization of hydrogen and helium , and has important consequences for our understanding of the ly@xmath0 forest and of galaxy formation in gravitational models of large - scale structure . </S>",
    "<S> we measure the temperature - density relation of intergalactic gas from ly@xmath0 forest observations of eight quasar spectra with high resolution and signal - to - noise ratio , using a new line fitting technique to obtain a lower cutoff of the distribution of line widths from which the temperature is derived . </S>",
    "<S> we carefully test the accuracy of this technique to recover the gas temperature with a hydrodynamic simulation . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature at redshift @xmath1(3.9 , 3.0 , 2.4 ) is best determined at densities slightly above the mean : @xmath2(@xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5)k ( statistical error bars ) for gas density ( in units of the mean density ) @xmath6(@xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the power - law index of the temperature - density relation , defined by @xmath10 , is @xmath11(@xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) for the same three redshifts . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature at the fixed over - density @xmath15 is @xmath16=(@xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19)k . </S>",
    "<S> these temperatures are higher than expected for photoionized gas in ionization equilibrium with a cosmic background , and can be explained by a gradual additional heating due to on - going reionization . </S>",
    "<S> the measurement of the temperature reduces one source of uncertainty in the lower limit to the baryon density implied by the observed mean flux decrement . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the temperature can not be reliably measured for under - dense gas , because the velocities due to expansion always dominate the widths of the corresponding weak lines . </S>"
