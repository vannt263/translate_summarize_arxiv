    "there is a considerable interest in the recent results reported by bicep2 @xcite .",
    "if confirmed they would give an important boost to the community working in inflationary cosmology since a non - vanishing tensor index @xmath3 ( @xmath4 when foreground subtraction based on dust models has been carried out @xcite ) , is a very distinctive characterisation of inflation @xcite .",
    "in particular , from this data the scale of inflation can be inferred to lie somewhere between @xmath5 and @xmath6 , which points at new physics at or beyond the @xmath7 scale .    here",
    "we study a model of inflation @xcite , based on a goldstone ( shift ) symmetry and in a hybrid mechanism : _ hybrid natural inflation _ @xcite .",
    "the original inflationary model based on an anomalous abelian symmetry is the _ natural inflation _ model of freese et al .",
    "@xcite . in natural inflation , quantum corrections",
    "generate a small mass term for the aspiring goldstone mode .",
    "a potential problem for the model is that , to produce sufficient inflation , the scale of symmetry breaking @xmath8 must be greater than the planck scale in which case large quantum gravity corrections could appear .",
    "hybrid inflation scenarios @xcite , where the evolution of more than one field is important , have become common within the inflationary paradigm .",
    "hybrid natural inflation _",
    "@xcite , in which a second field is responsible for terminating inflation , is a well motivated inflationary model .",
    "while this model was originally formulated to realise low scales of inflation @xcite , hybrid natural inflation finds applications beyond this purpose . in hybrid natural inflation",
    "the inflaton is a pseudo - goldstone boson with a small mass due to the rupture of the symmetry at the quantum level or by explicit breaking .",
    "since the end of inflation is triggered by a second field , the number of e - folds of inflation @xmath9 depends on the auxiliary field @xmath10 allowing for a viable model , with values of @xmath8 at or below the planck scale .",
    "the goal of this paper is to constrain the free parameters of hybrid natural inflation in light of the data from bicep2 . along the way",
    ", we find general consistency relations at which observables are subject if the slow - roll approximation is imposed .",
    "we find , in particular , that hybrid natural inflation can sustain a large scalar running index .",
    "the presence of a large running could be a possible resolution to the apparent tension between high values of @xmath11 and previous indirect limits based on temperature measurements @xcite .",
    "a large running would introduce a scale into the scalar power spectrum to suppress power on large angular scales @xcite .",
    "as discussed in @xcite the running is potentially detectable by large scale structure through measurements of clustering of high - redshift galaxy surveys in combination with cmb data .",
    "high - redshift may also be probed with the @xmath12 forest signal which tracks the density field .",
    "this could be a powerful probe to observe small - scale power spectrum ( ssps ) at @xmath13 mpc@xmath14 .",
    "mass function of collapsed gas in starless minihalos can be very sensitive to the ssps , thus providing a system for observing effects on the scalar running index . in @xcite",
    "an analysis is presented where halo mass functions and abundance of 21 cm absorbers are shown for several assumed combinations of the spectral index and running .",
    "@xcite and @xcite contain discussions on a ground - based stage iv cmb experiment , cmb - s4 with @xmath15 detectors by 2020 .",
    "it is expected that observations with this polarization experiment will probe large angular scales corresponding to low - multipole spectra @xmath16 and unambiguously detect tensor modes with large @xmath11 .",
    "these next - order measurements will presumably detect deviations in the power - law spectrum , parametrized as @xmath17 a detection of a non - zero running @xmath18 , through measurements of the e - mode damping tail , could provide information about the inflationary potential or point to models other than inflation .",
    "our presentation is organised as follows : in section  [ slowsec ] we determine general constraint equations among the observables based on the slow - roll paradigm .",
    "these constraints make no use of the specific form of the potential .",
    "failure to satisfy these equations by the values obtained for the observables in surveys would be a failure of the slow - roll approximation itself . section  [ hnisec ] presents a discussion of natural inflation in light of the bicep2 data . following this line of presentation",
    "we then generalise results for hybrid natural inflation where @xmath8 is not restricted by the number of e - folds .",
    "finally we summarise our results and conclude in section  [ csec ] .",
    "one can set constraints on the parameters of a given inflationary potential by imposing the requirement of acceptable inflation in terms of slow - roll parameters .",
    "this then leads to the determination of observables produced by that potential .",
    "the usual slow - roll parameters @xcite which involve the potential and its derivatives are @xmath19where primes denote derivatives with respect to @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath21 is the reduced planck mass @xmath22 and we set @xmath23 in what follows . in the slow - roll approximation the observables are given in terms of the usual slow - roll parameters @xcite as follows    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the tensor spectral index , @xmath11 is the usual tensor index or the ratio of tensor to scalar perturbations , @xmath26 the running of the tensor index , @xmath27 the scalar spectral index , @xmath28 its running , @xmath29 the running of the running , in a self - explanatory notation .",
    "the density perturbation at wave number @xmath30 is @xmath31 and @xmath32 is the scale of inflation with @xmath33 .",
    "note that all these quantities are described in terms of the inflaton scale @xmath34 , at which the perturbations are produced , some @xmath35 e - folds before the end of inflation . defining the quantity @xmath36 by @xmath37 we note that eq .",
    "( [ slowntk ] ) can be written as a constraint equation among the observables @xmath38 more constraint equations can be written as above but they have little chance of being falsified in the near future @xcite .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ slowntk2 ] ) is a model independent constraint on the observables and should be satisfied by _ any _ model of inflation based on the slow - roll paradigm .",
    "failure to satisfy this equation by the values obtained for the observables in surveys would indicate a departure from the slow - roll approximation itself . as a simple numerical example",
    "we see that the reported values @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and , @xmath41 yield @xmath42 .",
    "the values also set the scale of inflation in the range @xmath43 we stress that these values for @xmath26 and @xmath44 are _ model independent_. they only depend on the values given to @xmath45 , @xmath27 , @xmath46 _ and _ the validity of the slow - roll approximation .",
    "thus , according to the slow - roll approximation for single field inflation we are predicting that @xmath26 will take values within the range @xmath47 .    on the other hand , the equation for the running eq .",
    "( [ slownsk ] ) can be written as @xmath48thus , a determination of @xmath28 would be equivalent to a determination of the parameter @xmath49 . in hybrid natural inflation as well as in natural inflation ,",
    "@xmath28 is given by @xmath50where @xmath8 is the scale of the ( goldstone ) symmetry breaking .",
    "a determination of @xmath28 would be a determination of @xmath8 and , thus , a possible indication of new physics at or beyond the @xmath7 scale .",
    "we begin with a brief discussion of natural inflation which is then generalised to hybrid natural inflation .",
    "natural inflation is a single scalar field model , where the end of inflation is determined by the steepening of the potential until @xmath51 .",
    "thus , the inflaton value at the end of inflation , @xmath52 , is precisely determined and , up to an uncertainty about the number of intermediate e - folds of inflation , so is the inflaton value of the observable scales @xmath34 . as a result natural inflation has only two free parameters : the scale of inflation @xmath53 and @xmath8 .",
    "the natural inflation potential is given by @xmath54where we conveniently have defined @xmath55 . from ( [ slowns ] )",
    "we find that the spectral index is always less than one : @xmath56 .",
    "thus , @xmath8 is determined if we know @xmath57 and @xmath11 and is given by @xmath58 from the reality condition of @xmath8 , we find a bound on @xmath11 @xmath59 which is just within the range reported by bicep2 . as an example we calculate @xmath8 from eq .",
    "( [ nif1 ] ) in the case when @xmath40 and @xmath60 .",
    "for these values one gets @xmath61 and @xmath62    we see that natural inflation is marginally able to accommodate the data reported by bicep2 . the price to pay is a very large symmetry breaking scale @xmath8 , with @xmath63 . in table",
    "[ table1 ] we compare these values with other models and with results for the reported case @xmath4 when foreground subtraction based on dust models has been carried out @xcite .",
    "we now investigate whether hybrid natural inflation is able to lower the value of @xmath8 while , at the same time , keeping reasonable values for the observables .",

    "( [ hninsk ] ) , one can see that small values of @xmath8 would imply unacceptably large @xmath28 while large @xmath8 could give negligible contribution to the running .",
