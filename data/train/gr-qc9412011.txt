    "various phenomena associated with phase transitions at the early stage of the universe have been a subject of great interest in cosmology for two decades .",
    "cosmological first order phase transitions are caused by the decay of a metastable ( false ) vacuum in field theory , which produces true vacuum bubbles in the sea of false vacuum .",
    "a particular interest was taken in the false vacuum decay during an inflationary stage of the universe @xcite .",
    "recently , several authors considered a possible inflationary universe scenario which realize @xmath0 open universe @xcite , in contrast to the standard inflationary universe which predicts @xmath1 flat universe @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "the bubble nucleation process plays an important role .",
    "that is , one assumes a scalar field with a potential like in the new inflationary scenario but with a high potential barrier before the slow rolling inflationary phase .",
    "if the nucleation rate is small , nucleated bubbles do not collide , and a homogeneous and isotropic universe with negative curvature is realized in one bubble thanks to the @xmath2-symmetry of the bounce solution .",
    "the second inflation starts inside a bubble due to the flat part of the potential .",
    "then after the inflation , the universe gradually becomes curvature - dominated as it expands and the present universe with @xmath0 can be explained .",
    "the important problem is the quantum state of the scalar field after bubble nucleation because its quantum fluctuations may be considered as the origin of the cosmic structure .",
    "as is well - known , the false vacuum decay rate can be calculated by means of the euclidean path integral dominated by an @xmath2-symmetric bounce solution and the classical motion of the nucleated bubble is described by the analytic continuation of the bounce solution @xcite . but",
    "studies of the quantum state after the false vacuum decay have not been done so much .",
    "several pioneering works on this problem were done by rubakov @xcite , kandrup @xcite , vachaspati and vilenkin @xcite .",
    "recently , we developed a formalism to investigate the quantum state after false vacuum decay based on the wkb wave function in a multi - dimensional tunneling system @xcite , which was originally developed by banks , bender and wu @xcite , and gervais and sakita @xcite .",
    "for a simplified model of spatially homogeneous false vacuum decay discussed by rubakov @xcite , we showed that our formalism leads to the same results @xcite .",
    "as for the false vacuum decay due to an @xmath2-symmetric vacuum bubble , we also applied our formalism to a simple toy model and evaluated the expectation value of the energy momentum tensor inside the vacuum bubble @xcite .",
    "the result indicates that the field excitation occurs inside the vacuum bubble , _ i.e. _ , particle creation occurs there and it resembles a thermal state .    in spite of these investigations ,",
    "we have not yet obtained a clear understanding of the quantum state after bubble nucleation . neither the spectrum of created particles , nor the relation between the efficiency of the particle creation and the shape of the field potential has not been made clear .",
    "a difficulty originates from the fact that the mass of the quantum field is spatially inhomogeneous and time - dependent due to the non - trivial background field configuration .    in this paper",
    ", we tackle the issue by looking at the evolution of mode functions of a scalar field in a systematic manner and by investigating the spectrum of created particles , to obtain a better understanding of the quantum state after bubble nucleation .",
    "our strategy is as follows .",
    "the background field configuration is inhomogeneous and time - dependent in the conventional minkowski space - time coordinates .",
    "however , it keeps the lorentz group ( @xmath3 ) symmetry , which originates from the @xmath2-symmetry of the bounce solution .",
    "this implies that the system is homogeneous on the hyperbolic time slicing inside the future light cone within one bubble .",
    "this time slicing of the minkowski spacetime is called the milne universe .",
    "quantum field theory in the milne universe has been well investigated as an example of the quantization of a field in curved spacetime @xcite , and the relation of the vacuum state between the milne universe and the minkowski spacetime is well understood for a massive field , at least for two - dimensional spacetime .",
    "using this fact , we can define a natural vacuum state in the milne universe that corresponds to the usual minkowski vacuum .",
    "then we can gain an insight into the quantum state of a field inside an expanding bubble in terms of the particle spectrum observed by the comoving observers in the milne universe at late times .",
    "following this strategy , we first carefully investigate the evolution of the mode functions through the tunneling process in two - dimensional spacetime , based on the wave functional formalism recently developed by us @xcite .",
    "we find that the resulting mode functions can be expressed in a very transparent manner and the created particle spectrum can be evaluated mode by mode .",
    "then we extend the result to the case of four dimensional spacetime .",
    "this technical advantage will be very useful when we consider realistic cases of bubble nucleation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we review our formalism to investigate the quantum state after bubble nucleation . in section 3",
    ", we investigate the quantum state inside a vacuum bubble in two - dimensional spacetime on the basis of quantum field theory in the milne universe , and derive the formula for the spectrum of created particles .",
    "then the result is extended to the four - dimensional case in section 4 . in section 5",
    ", we apply our result to a simple thin - wall model which is similar to the one discussed by rubakov @xcite .",
    "the results are found to be similar to those obtained by rubakov in the case of a spatially homogeneous decay model .",
    "section 6 is devoted to summary and discussions .",
    "we use the units @xmath4 and @xmath5 and a bar ( @xmath6 ) to denote the complex conjugate .",
    "first , let us start reviewing our formalism to investigate the quantum state after false vacuum decay @xcite .",
    "it is based on the wkb wave function for a multi - dimensional tunneling system . for generality , we consider the @xmath7-dimensional minkowski spacetime .",
    "the conventional minkowski spacetime coordinates are denoted by @xmath8 with @xmath9 .",
    "we consider a system of two interacting real scalar fields @xmath10 and @xmath11 with the lagrangian @xcite , @xmath12 where @xmath13 , \\\\ { \\cal l}_{\\phi}&=&-\\int d^n{\\bf x } \\biggl[{1\\over2 } ( \\partial_\\mu\\phi)^2 + { 1\\over2}m^2(\\sigma)\\phi^2\\biggr],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here the @xmath10 field has a potential @xmath14 as shown in figure 1 , and decays from the false vacuum at @xmath15 to the true vacuum at @xmath16 through bubble nucleation .    in the lowest wkb picture ,",
    "the decay from the false vacuum can be described by a bounce solution @xcite .",
    "the bounce solution satisfies the classical euclidean field equation , and has the maximum symmetry to minimize the euclidean action . in our case",
    ", it has the @xmath17-symmetry , and depends only on @xmath18 , where @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) is the time coordinate in the euclidean space .",
    "thus we can write the bounce solution as @xmath21 .",
    "the subsequent motion of the bubble after nucleation is given by the analytic continuation of the bounce solution to the lorentzian time , which is given by @xmath22 .",
    "for simplicity , we neglect the quantum fluctuations of the @xmath10 field and consider only the quantum state of the @xmath11 field which will be affected through the coupling with @xmath10 as it decays from the false vacuum .",
    "note that one may regard @xmath11 as the fluctuation of @xmath10 itself , if desired @xcite .",

    "( 3 ) @xmath228 and @xmath237 :    using the asymptotic formulae ( [ eq : asymgg ] ) , we easily find @xmath217 in the region @xmath229 , @xmath238    ( 4 ) @xmath239 and @xmath237 :    in this case , using eqs.([eq : asymgg ] ) and ( [ eq : ikasymsp ] ) , we obtain @xmath217 at @xmath229 as @xmath240    the first two cases for which @xmath241 , the spectrum shows a similar feature , that is , it is constant of order unity at @xmath229 , and decreases exponentially at @xmath242 . on the other hand , in the latter two cases",
    "when @xmath243 , the particle creation is always suppressed exponentially by a factor of @xmath244 .",
    "this feature is the same as those obtained previously in the spatially homogeneous decay model of the false vacuum if we identify the euclidean tunneling `` time '' in the homogeneous model with the radius of the bubble wall @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated the quantum state of a scalar field inside a vacuum bubble nucleated in the process of false vacuum decay , focusing on the aspect of particle creation .",
    "we have used the wave functional formalism @xcite to investigate the quantum state .",
    "first , we have carefully analyzed the case of two - dimensional spacetime and presented a prescription to obtain the mode functions inside a future light cone of a bubble and an interpretation of the resulting quantum state in the particle creation picture . because of the existence of a natural vacuum in the milne universe , which corresponds to the conventional minkowski vacuum",
    ", we have been able to introduce the concept of `` particle '' in a natural way .",
    "the spectrum of created particles follows immediately by reading off the bogoliubov coefficients relative to the natural vacuum from the final form of the mode functions .",
    "we have shown that the bogoliubov coefficients are diagonal in the mode indices so that a mode - by - mode analysis of the quantum state is possible .",
    "then we have extended our method to four - dimensional spacetime and shown that it applies in essentially the same manner as in the case of two dimension .",
    "this technical advantage will be very useful when we consider realistic models , such as the case of a thick - wall bubble or the case of quantum fluctuations of the tunneling field itself @xcite .",
    "we have applied the technique developed here to a simple thin - wall model and found the following .",
    "( 1 ) the spectrum of created particles is always suppressed exponentially at large wavenumber with the characteristic scale of the spatial curvature on the hyperbolic time slicing inside the light cone ( _ i.e. _ , the cosmic time slicing in the milne universe ) .",
    "( 2 ) if the field becomes massive inside the true vacuum compared to the inverse of the wall radius , _",
    "@xmath245 , the particle creation is always suppressed by an exponential factor of @xmath244 .    in this paper , we have assumed the spacetime to be flat and only considered a massive field inside the true vacuum bubble .",
    "however , it is of great interest to develop a formalism by relaxing these restrictions . in the case of a massive field",
    ", the quantum state corresponding to the minkowski vacuum state can be written as a pure state in the milne universe .",
    "but it will not be the case for a massless field @xcite .",
    "this is because the massless modes propagate always along null directions and a half of them escape to future null infinity without intersecting the boundary light cone of the milne universe .",
    "thus the massless minkowski mode functions can never be expressed in terms of those in the milne universe alone .",
    "apparently a more careful analysis is necessary for the massless case .",
    "extension to the case including gravity is most interesting , especially in connection with the open universe inflation @xcite .",
    "as pointed out in the introduction , if we consider a one - bubble inflationary universe model to realize a negative curvature universe , the spacetime will be a de sitter universe and the quantum fluctuations of the inflation field inside a nucleated bubble will give rise to the cosmological density perturbations .",
    "hence , if it is possible to include the effect of gravity in our approach , we will be able to determine the spectrum of the density perturbations in the open universe inflationary scenario .",
    "this is now under study @xcite .",

    "also we would like to thank b. allen , r. caldwell , d. lyth and n. turok for enlightening discussions .",

    "2010 , 2841 and 05640342 , and in part by the sumitomo foundation .      in this appendix",
    ", we derive the formulae which relate the mode functions in the milne universe and those of the usual minkowski spacetime in four - dimensional spacetime . as we use the spherical coordinates in both cases , we omit the spherical harmonics from the mode functions .",
    "we start from the following formula which may be derived from eq.([eq : trfmb ] ) or ( [ eq : trfmbb ] ) , @xmath246 this gives the relation between the @xmath247 milne and minkowski mode functions .",
    "we extend the above formula to the case of @xmath248 . by mathematical induction",
    "we can show that @xmath249 using this fact , we operate @xmath250 on both sides of eq.([eq : lzero ] ) and integrates both sides of the equation with respect to @xmath251 , we find @xmath252 where @xmath253 noting that @xmath254 , if we change the integration variable @xmath255 to @xmath256 , we see that this is just an integral representation of the associated legendre function @xcite , @xmath257 hence we have @xmath258 using the formula , @xmath259 which can be derived by using the differential relation for the associated legendre functions , we find @xmath260 this result shows that @xmath261 is indeed the positive frequency function in the milne universe which describes the minkowski vacuum , as in the two - dimensional case .    by taking the complex conjugate of eq.([eq : kfour ] ) , and continuing it to the euclidean time @xmath262 @xmath107 , we obtain @xmath263 this equation corresponds to eq.([eq : emfb ] ) in the two - dimensional case and gives the expression for the euclidean mode function in the four - dimensional case .    99 a. guth , phys .",
