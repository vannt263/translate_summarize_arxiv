    "in recent years significant experimental progress has lead to sophisticated cooling and trapping techniques of polar molecules and of atomic species having a large dipole moment @xcite .",
    "a very promising approach for achieving ultracold polar molecules is the formation of weakly - bound molecules making use of a magnetic feshbach resonance and a subsequent transfer to the ground state using the stirap ( stimulated raman adiabatic passage ) scheme @xcite .",
    "based on this method gases of motionally ultracold rbk @xcite or lics @xcite molecules in their rovibrational ground states were achieved .",
    "this fascinating progress paved the way towards degenerate quantum gases with predominant dipole - dipole interactions ( ddi ) . in the case of magnetic dipoles the bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) of @xmath1 , an atom with a large magnetic moment of 6 @xmath2 , was already achieved in 2004 @xcite .",
    "although in chromium the ddi can be enhanced relative to the atomic short - range interaction by decreasing the strength of the latter using a feshbach resonance @xcite , the ddi is typically still smaller or at most of the same magnitude as the van - der - waals forces . in order to create an atomic gas with a ddi larger than the van - der - waals forces , it was possible to realise a bec of dysprosium ( @xmath3 ) @xcite and erbium ( @xmath4 ) @xcite .",
    "the properties of the ddi are completely different from those of isotropic short - range interactions , e.g. , the ones between two atoms with no ddi .",
    "the ddi has a _ long - range _ character as it decays as @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the inter - particle distance , and it is _ anisotropic _ which means that even the sign of the interaction depends on the angle @xmath7 between the polarisation direction and the relative position of the particles .",
    "a full and quantitative understanding of the behaviour of two particles in an external trapping potential is a prerequisite for the manipulation and control of ultracold two - body systems that have been proposed for possible quantum - computer realisations @xcite .",
    "this knowledge about the microscopic two - body physics is also important for the understanding of the rich physics of the corresponding many - body systems .",
    "for example , more accurate bose - hubbard parameters for describing an ultracold quantum gas in an optical lattice have been extracted from two - particle calculations in the absence @xcite or the presence of ddi @xcite .",
    "furthermore , inelastic confinement - induced two - body resonances @xcite were found to have caused massive atom losses also in quantum gases with many particles @xcite . evidently , the possibility to vary the interaction strength within ultracold atomic quantum gases with the aid of two - body magnetic feshbach resonances has been of paramount importance for the whole research field .",
    "different theoretical approaches to describe dipolar systems have been reported earlier .",
    "to describe an ultracold dipolar gas trapped in a harmonic confinement , in @xcite a pseudo potential as a function of the dipole moment is proposed for the short - range interaction , while for the long - range potential the anisotropic ddi is adopted .",
    "the approach described in @xcite uses a hard - sphere potential for the short - range part of the interaction potential between two dipolar particles in free space . in these approaches",
    "@xmath0-wave like scattering resonances induced by the dipolar interactions were observed .",
    "following the prediction of elastic confinement - induced resonances in quasi-1d confinement @xcite , such resonances for dipolar systems were considered in @xcite .",
    "the approach described in the present work extends the method described in @xcite which allows for the use of a realistic , numerically given born - oppenheimer potential curve for the short - range part of the interaction potential by adding an additional ddi .",
    "in contrast to the use of a @xmath8 pseudo - potential that supports a single bound state , the use of a realistic short - range potential supports often many deeply bound states . furthermore , in contrast to numerous previous works , see e.g.  @xcite , in our approach the external trap potential is chosen as a finite optical - lattice potential , i.e. , a truncated taylor series for a @xmath9 or @xmath10 optical - lattice potential . while a truncation at the second order yields a harmonic trapping potential , anharmonic multi - well potentials can be achieved , if the truncation is performed at higher orders . in this work",
    "it will be demonstrated that in an anharmonic trapping potential the coupling of center - of - mass and relative motion leads to the occurrence of inelastic resonances at which bound states with some center - of - mass excitation couple to states of unbound dipoles .",
    "this mechanism is analogous to the inelastic confinement - induced resonances described in @xcite for ultracold atomic systems without ddi .",
    "this article is organised as follows .",
    "first , the hamiltonian and the numerical method are introduced in section  [ ch : two ] and section  [ ch : method ] , respectively . in section  [ ch : results ] the influence of the dipolar interaction is investigated for two different trapping potentials .",
    "the results for an isotropic harmonic trap are shown in section  [ ch : harmonic ] , the ones for an anisotropic sextic potential with coupling between center - of - mass and relative motions in section  [ ch : sextic ] .",
    "a conclusion is provided in section  [ ch : summary ] .",

    "a rather unique feature of the present approach is that the short - range interaction potential @xmath53 can be chosen arbitrarily as some analytical expression , some numerically given potential curve , or a mixture of both .",
    "the only constraint is its isotropy .",
    "choosing a realistic atomic or molecular interaction potential provides the unique opportunity to investigate in a realistic fashion especially the regime where both , the isotropic short - range interaction as well as the ddi , have a comparable influence . such a study is not possible with model potentials ( such as , e.g. , zero - range potentials @xcite or hard spheres @xcite ) that do not realistically reproduce the behavior of the tail of the short - range potential .",

    "the full treatment of two particles interacting by an arbitrary isotropic interaction potential and confined in a finite optical lattice has been introduced in @xcite . in the present work",

    "these resonances manifest as broad avoided crossings in the energy spectrum and are found for @xmath168 , @xmath169 , @xmath170 , and @xmath171 .",

    "increasing the dipole interaction strength deepens the interaction potential @xmath82 and introduces a new bound state in the inter - particle potential .",

    "the centrifugal barrier @xmath174 shields the trap states from noticing the bound state that is much more confined compared to a trap state , see fig .",

    "the green state is a trap state with quantum numbers @xmath176 . from the selection rules of the ddi ( see section  [ ch : basis ] ) it follows that only states with equal @xmath108 quantum numbers can couple due to the ddi . consequently , this is a non - avoided crossing of two non - interacting states .",
    "furthermore , there is an avoided crossing between the blue state @xmath177 and the green state .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the selection rules of the ddi .",
    "the coupling of the trap states is significantly smaller than the coupling in the dir , because the coupling matrix element eq .",

    "hence , the coupling matrix element is larger for small @xmath6 , which is the case for the much more strongly confined bound state compared with a trap state .",
    "the avoided crossings between trap states can nevertheless be used to adiabatically transfer an isotropic trap state to a polarised one and could thus be used for some control scheme .      to investigate the influence of the short - range potential for dipolar particles , the @xmath0-wave scattering length of the short - range potential for zero ddi is varied by an inner - wall manipulation @xcite .",

    "bound states cross with trap states .",
    "the anharmonicity in the external potential leads to a non - vanishing center - of - mass to relative motion coupling .",
    "hence , these crossings are avoided for certain symmetries of the crossing states . at the avoided crossing",
    ", relative - motion binding energy can be transferred into center - of - mass excitation energy due to the anharmonicity in the external confinement .",
    "since this is an inelastic process , we denote these resonances as inelastic confinement - induced dipolar resonances ( icidr ) .",
    "these resonances are the dipolar analog for the feshbach - type resonances induced by a coupling of center - of - mass to relative motion systems of ultracold atoms without ddi @xcite .",
    "we follow the notation introduced in @xcite and denote these resonances as inelastic confinement - induced resonances ( icir ) . in complete analogy , also in the dipolar gases resonances appear due to the coupling of center - of - mass excited bound states and trap states with lower center - of - mass excitation for a non - zero coupling term @xmath206 .",
    "the difference between icir and icidr is that the adiabatic transformation of a trap state into a bound state is performed by a change of the scattering length ( for example using a magnetic feshbach resonance ) or the geometry of the external confinement in the case of icir and by a variation in dipolar interaction strength in the case of icidr .",
    "moreover , for ultracold atoms there exists only a single least bound state and the scattering length is determined by its position .",
    "hence , for a specific center - of - mass excitation only a single resonance ( with the lowest trap state ) exists in the case of icir .",
    "in contrast , there exists an entire series of bound states for increasing dipolar interaction strength .",

    "moreover , the trap state @xmath209 and the center - of - mass excited bound state @xmath213 have a non - vanishing coupling term , since these states have the same symmetry , which can be seen from the nodal structure of the cuts through the wavefunctions in fig .",

    "[ fig : wf_ci ] it can be concluded that solely states which have an even ( odd ) nodal structure can couple to each other .",

    "( [ eq : coupling_term ] ) , because the total integrand is anti - symmetric . it is important to note that it has been demonstrated that the coupling of trap states to center - of - mass excited bound states at an icir has lead to massive atom losses and heating in a cloud of cs atoms @xcite due to molecule formation @xcite . as a consequence",

    "a system of two dipolar particles interacting via a short - range potential trapped in a single well of an optical lattice was investigated .",
