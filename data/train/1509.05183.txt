    "several dynamical phenomena are associated with the mobility of human beings .",
    "pedestrian s movement patterns @xcite and associated behaviour , synchronized behaviour such as flocking or herding @xcite are some well known examples .",
    "mobility of human beings is often motivated by some definite purpose and emergent phenomena such as segregation and migration may result @xcite .",
    "dynamical phenomena associated with movement of human beings and animals have attracted the attention of physicists as many of these can be mapped to dynamical physical systems .",
    "for example , pedestrians movements can be analysed using a social force model @xcite and flocking phenomena can be studied in terms of the classical xy model @xcite .",
    "the segregation phenomena is fundamental in nature and seen to be present in the human society in different forms . in a heterogeneous society , consisting of different racial or cultural groups",
    ", it is often found that people prefer to live in the neighborhood of people belonging to the same group @xcite which results in a segregation .",
    "segregation may occur due to different factors such as age , income , language , religion , color etc . to achieve segregation in space",
    ", one must consider the movements of the agents following certain rules .",
    "a simple model of social segregation was proposed by schelling @xcite long before the issue of residential segregation received serious attention @xcite .",
    "this model illustrates how an individual s choice of living with the neighbor of the same kind can lead collectively to segregation .",
    "the model received attention from physicists as it was realised that its continuous analog , in space and time , corresponds to a dynamical model of solid or liquid flow @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", it has similarity with magnetic models with conservative dynamics @xcite and also the dynamical phenomena of phase ordering @xcite .",
    "later , several variants of the schelling model were studied . in @xcite",
    "a unified mathematical framework was developed for a broad class of models of the schelling type . in most of the schelling class models ,",
    "agents occupy sites of a two dimensional grid . in @xcite",
    "it was considered that the agents occupy districts ( or patches ) rather than sites on a two dimensional grid , which improves social realism of the model .    in the original schelling model , a utility factor",
    "is defined based on the fraction of opposing neighbours ; if the latter is greater ( less ) than @xmath1 , the utility factor is defined to be zero ( one ) .",
    "an unsatisfied agent with zero utility tends to move to a vacant site in the neighbourhood only if that makes the utility factor larger ( constrained dynamics ) .",
    "however , it was shown later that this leads to segregated clusters which are rather small in size .",
    "it was found that the system can reach a segregated state where large clusters are formed provided agents are allowed to move even when the utility remains same @xcite - this is called the unconstrained case .",
    "the configurations generated in this way are very similar to those occurring in the phase separation dynamics .    whether the dynamics is constrained or unconstrained is a major concern in the schelling model . in @xcite both",
    "the constrained and unconstrained cases were considered in one dimension and it was shown that the constrained model shows non - trivial static properties characterised by the presence of a symmetry breaking phase transition . on the other hand , in the unconstrained model the dynamics exhibit coarsening as in ising - like models with non - conserved order parameter . also , it was shown in @xcite that the constrained case corresponds to  solid - like \" flow while the unconstrained case mimics the flow of liquids .    in the present paper",
    ", we consider continuous values of the utility factor ( details in the next section ) and show that even subject to the constrained rule ( that unsatisfied agents can move to a different location only if their utility increases ) , it is possible to obtain good quality segregation , i.e segregated clusters are larger in size .",
    "this is comparable to the unconstrained case with discrete utility factors .",
    "the case of continuous utility was considered earlier in @xcite with added degrees of freedom and the effect of continuous utility alone was not obvious . in @xcite utility",
    "was regarded as a general function of @xmath2 .",
    "but only the case where @xmath3 was taken and a special form ( spiked ) of the utility function was used ( utility equal to 1 for @xmath4 and zero otherwise ) . in @xcite , where the mapping of the schelling model to a physical model in continuum had been made ,",
    "the utility factor was also taken as a continuous function .",
    "however , results were obtained only for the case where it has a step function like behaviour .",
    "the reason for considering utility as a continuous valued variable is twofold .",
    "first , it gives an idea of the degree of mismatch between the agent and their neigbhours .",
    "secondly , it provides a greater mobility to the unsatisfied agents as they can now move to a different location even when utility does not become positive necessarily but definitely improves .",
    "this is close to reality as it is not possible to attain an ideal state always ; especially in a single step .",
    "so in an indirect manner , the movements of agents become less constrained in the continuous case .",
    "apart from studying the segregation phenomena ( in terms of satisfied agents ) and related phase transitions , certain dynamical features are also studied for the two models .    in section ii we have defined the models and the quantities calculated and section iii gives the details of the simulation . in section iv results are discussed , section v contains study of the correlation function and section vi contains summary and discussions .",
    "first , we describe the schelling model with discrete utility factor where the agents belonging to two different groups are located on the sites of a chessboard .",
    "some sites are left vacant , the fraction of vacant sites is denoted by the dilution parameter @xmath5 .",
    "the neighborhood of an agent comprises eight nearest sites ( moore neighborhood ) .",
    "the agents are able to relocate according to the fraction of neighboring agents belonging to their own group . an agent located at the center of a neighborhood where the fraction of neighbors of opposite group ( denoted by @xmath2 ) is greater than a predefined tolerance threshold @xmath6",
    ", will try to relocate to a neighborhood for which @xmath2 is less than or equal to @xmath6 ( in the original model , @xmath7 ) .",
    "the agents for which @xmath8 , utility factor @xmath0 is defined to be equal to @xmath9 and the agent is said to be satisfied .",
    "otherwise the agent is unsatisfied and utility factor is @xmath10 .    in this paper",
    ", we have introduced the utility factor as @xmath11 which can essentially take continuous values .",
    "@xmath2 can take values between @xmath10 and @xmath9 and @xmath12 . in principle",
    ", @xmath2 takes a finite number of values , e.g. in a moore neighborhood @xmath2 can have @xmath13 different values .",
    "these values are evenly spread in the interval [ 0,1 ] .",
    "compared to the original model where @xmath0 is binary , @xmath0 can assume a much larger number of values , evenly spread in the interval [ @xmath14,@xmath6 ] and hence we regard it to be continuously varying .",
    "we allow here realistic constrained nonlocal jumps , i.e. movement to vacant sites where utility can be increased only for the unsatisfied agents who have @xmath16 .",
    "satisfied agents do not need to move .",
    "we consider here two models : model a and model b. in model a , an unsatisfied agent can move to any randomly chosen vacant site where @xmath17 . in model",
    "b an unsatisfied agent can move to any randomly chosen empty site provided @xmath0 has a larger value compared to the original one .",
    "effectively model a is equivalent to the original model where @xmath0 is discrete as only the sign of @xmath0 matters during a movement .",
    "however , it is useful to study model a to directly compare the results of model b with continuous utility factors .",
    "we check how the segregation is affected by varying the dilution parameter @xmath5 and tolerance threshold @xmath6 in these two models .",
    "a similar study was done in @xcite , with @xmath0 taking discrete values only .",
    "we take a @xmath18 lattice with a fraction @xmath5 of sites empty at random .",
    "agents belonging to two different groups ( of equal size ) occupy the rest of the sites randomly in the beginning . if @xmath19 and @xmath20 denote the number of agents belonging to two different groups , then @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the fraction of neighbors belonging to the opposite group @xmath2 is calculated by dividing the number of opposing neighbours by the total number of occupied neighboring sites .",
    "for example if @xmath25 neighboring sites are occupied and @xmath26 of them belong to the opposite group then @xmath27 .",
    "the total number of neighbors is a variable and can vary from @xmath10 to @xmath28 .",
    "if the total number of neighbors of any agent is @xmath10 then the agent is taken as satisfied , i.e. , they have a positive utility .",
    "segregation models are known to exhibit phase transitions .",
    "one can vary factors like the threshold value @xmath6 , the dilution factor @xmath5 , size of the two groups etc . to investigate the presence of a critical value below / above",
    "which segregation can occur .",
    "as already mentioned , in @xcite , a phase transition in the constrained case was observed as the dilution factor was increased . in the unconstrained model considered in @xcite , where satisfied agents could also move , it was found that by varying @xmath5 and @xmath6 , a phase diagram can be obtained .",
    "there are two transitions ; for very small @xmath6 the states are frozen , increasing @xmath6 one can get a segregated state while above a critical @xmath6 , a mixed state exists .    in the present model ,",
    "we calculate two important quantities .",
    "the first is @xmath29 , the fraction of agents with negative utility .",
    "if @xmath30 denotes the fraction of population with utility @xmath0 , @xmath31 @xmath29 is zero for @xmath32 trivially .",
    "the other quantity is the average utility defined as @xmath33 .",
    "the average fraction of opposing neighbours @xmath34 helps in understanding qualitatively whether segregation is reached .",
    "one can define @xmath35 to be the segregation factor ; the larger is @xmath36 , the better is the degree of segregation .",
    "three types of states may occur ; the frozen state where @xmath29 has large non - zero value and @xmath36 is very close to @xmath37 ( which is the value expected for a completely homogeneous distribution of agents which is initially chosen ) .",
    "this situation is analogous to the jamming transition @xcite in segregation model in which large numbers of agents remain stuck in unfavorable states .",
    "as @xmath6 is made larger , @xmath36 may increase .",
    "if @xmath36 is very close to @xmath9 and @xmath29 is negligible , one may call that a segregated state . for even larger @xmath6 , @xmath36 will decrease from its maximum value while @xmath38 ; eventually for @xmath32 , @xmath39 and @xmath38 , which is of course a mixed state .",
    "our goal is to study whether there are sharp or smooth transitions from one state to another as @xmath6 is increased .",
    "we have also calculated some dynamical quantities related to the motion of the agents .",
    "the first is the persistence probability @xmath40 , which is defined as the fraction of agents who have not moved till time @xmath41 .",
    "another quantity calculated is the mobility factor defined as the average distance travelled by the agents , denoted by @xmath42 .",
    "this is the average euclidean distance between the initial and final positions ( position after reaching steady state ) of the agents .",
    "these two factors have not been studied in the context of segregation models earlier , to the best of our knowledge .",
    "in the initial configuration the @xmath43 agents belonging to the two different groups are homogeneously distributed among the @xmath44 sites .",
    "a site is chosen at random at every time step .",
    "if the chosen site is occupied then it is tested whether the agents are satisfied or not .",
    "if the agents are satisfied they stay at their present site , otherwise they select one unoccupied site at random from all sites that are unoccupied at that moment .",
    "we assume that the list of unoccupied locations is available to the agents .",
    "the unsatisfied agents move to the randomly chosen empty site provided they become satisfied there ( model a ) or the utility factor increases ( model b ) .",
    "otherwise they stay at their present site .",
    "only one such attempt is allowed .",
    "dynamics stop when the system reaches an absorbing state ; i.e there is no change in the dynamical quantities measured .",
    "an absorbing state is always possible here .",
    "we have used @xmath5 values from @xmath45 to @xmath46 and @xmath47 . for each set of parameters",
    "@xmath48 initial configurations are used over which the relevant quantities are averaged .",
    "we have used different @xmath49 values ; results for @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 are presented .",
    "_ model a _ : we have studied the time dependence of various quantities defined in the last section and observed that they all reach a steady state value in time .     ( fraction of agents with utility factor @xmath16 ) for @xmath53 for @xmath54 and @xmath55 for several values of @xmath6 against time .",

    "we find that in general for small @xmath6 , @xmath29 reaches a nonzero saturation value but for larger values of @xmath6 , the saturation value of @xmath29 becomes zero ( fig .",
    "[ size1 ] shown for @xmath53 ) . plotting the saturation values ( inset of fig .",
    "[ size1 ] ) , we find that there is a critical value of @xmath57 where @xmath29 decreases to a negligible value ( @xmath58 ) discontinuously .",
    "hence this critical value separates two regions of @xmath38 and @xmath59 .",
    "@xmath60 depends on @xmath5 .",
    "next we discuss the behaviour of @xmath61 ( average value of @xmath0 ) in the steady state . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ jump3 ] , this goes from a negative value to a positive value as @xmath6 is made larger and crosses zero at a value of @xmath62 . in analogy with magnetic or liquid - gas phase transition , one can interpret the @xmath63 point as a coexistence point .",
    "thus @xmath64 acts as a field which separates the two regions with @xmath65 and @xmath66 much like an external field in magnetic systems below the critical point .    for complete characterisation of the system the variation of the saturation value of @xmath36 , the segregation factor as a function of @xmath6 is studied .",
    "we find that @xmath36 sharply increases from @xmath67 to a large value ( @xmath68 ) at a value of @xmath69 .",
    "hence we find a region where @xmath70 and @xmath67 which we identify as the frozen state . as @xmath29 drops sharply to zero at @xmath64 and @xmath36",
    "also shows a sharp increase at the same point , one can conclude that a transition between a frozen state and a segregated state occurs at @xmath64 . since there is hardly any finite size dependence in the data and all the quantities",
    "show sharp changes at @xmath60 we conclude that the transition is first order in nature .",
    "apparently , no sharp transition occurs between the segregated state and mixed state as @xmath36 decreases for larger values of @xmath6 approaching @xmath71 as @xmath72 monotonically .",
    "however we note that @xmath36 remains almost constant for a range of value of @xmath6 before decreasing .",
    "this suggests there may be another transition occurring at @xmath73 between a segregated state and a mixed state .",
    "as it is difficult to identify the second transition point , we define a `` transition point '' where @xmath36 becomes less than @xmath74 , i.e we define the state as segregated when @xmath75 . based on these findings , we show the transition points between the three different phases in the @xmath76 plane for model a in fig .",

    "the snapshots show the steady states for @xmath56 and @xmath53 . for a small value of tolerance threshold @xmath6 , the probability that an agent is unsatisfied is quite large . however , the probability that a favourable site be found by relocation is also small at small @xmath6 ( unless @xmath5 is sufficiently large so that the agent has more choice of making movements ) . for a more detailed discussion",
    "see section vi .",
    "thus the initial grey picture where the agents of two groups are mixed up remains almost unchanged i.e. , frozen in time .",
    "as @xmath6 is made larger , fewer agents will be unsatisfied , however , the probability to find an empty site which will satisfy the agent is larger and the system will undergo a time evolution and the steady state picture will show finite sized domains of agents of the same group making @xmath81 . for smaller value of @xmath5 , the effect will show up for a larger value of @xmath6 .",
    "if @xmath6 is made even larger , the need for relocation becomes less since now almost all the agents are satisfied .",
    "although some agents will move , the cluster sizes will be much less .",
    "this is apparent in the figures for @xmath79 ( fig .",
    "[ snap1 ] ) .",
    "we note that the snapshots are very similar to those of the constrained schelling model ( see for example @xcite ) which is consistent with the fact that model a effectively uses binary utility factors .",
    "the cluster sizes , even in the so called segregated state , are small with the interface showing a lot of roughness .",
    "_ model b _ : in model b also we have studied the time dependence of the relevant quantities and observed that they reach a steady state value in time .",

    "in fact we find that @xmath29 decreases with system size and as the @xmath29 values are already @xmath84 for @xmath55 , one can conjecture that @xmath29 would vanish for any @xmath6 in the thermodynamic limit ( see fig .",

    "it is different from the model of @xcite as only movement of unsatisfied agents are considered although in both models nonlocal jumps are allowed .",
    "model a shows a frozen state and a sharp transition to a segregated state at a nonzero value of @xmath6 .",
    "the segregation factor @xmath36 remains close to @xmath9 before decreasing slowly to @xmath37 , the value corresponding to a completely mixed state . defining the segregated state to be",
    "that for which @xmath111 , one can obtain a boundary between the segregated and the mixed state .",
    "the most striking observation for model b is that here the frozen state does not exist in the thermodynamic limit in contrast to model a and unconstrained model with discrete utility @xcite .",
    "one can justify the presence ( absence ) of the frozen state in model a ( model b ) for small @xmath6 in the following way .",
    "let the two groups be labelled x and y. let at a particular vacant site all the neighboring sites be occupied ( this will be more probable for small @xmath5 ) and @xmath112 be the number of y type neighbors .",
    "now the probability that an x type agent which is unsatisfied at its present position will jump to this particular vacant site is @xmath113 $ ] in model a. if @xmath6 is very small , then only very few terms will contribute to the sum .",
    "hence the probability is rather small and very few unsatisfied agents will be able to move in a finite time ( note that only one attempt is allowed ) for small @xmath6 and @xmath5 .",
    "thus for all practical purposes this makes the majority of the agents stay in their present unsatisfied state . in model b , the probability that an x type unsatisfied agent with @xmath114 number of y type neighbors in its present position will jump to this particular vacant site is @xmath115 $ ] .",
    "obviously this probability is much larger than that in model a and the frozen state ceases to occur in model b.    in model b , the segregation factor remains very close to @xmath9 from @xmath90 to a finite value of @xmath6 and then decreases slowly to @xmath37 .",
    "one can obtain a boundary between a segregated state and mixed state as in the case of model a.    since model a is identical to the constrained schelling model with discrete utility , it is not surprising that only small clusters are generated . in model",
    "b , large clusters are formed similar to the unconstrained model .",
    "this is confirmed from the calculation of the correlation as a function of time .",
    "of course , a rigorous calculation of cluster sizes as a function of the parameter @xmath6 and @xmath5 will be able to distinguish model a and model b more quantitatively and will be reputed in a future publication @xcite .",
    "other features like persistence probability @xmath40 and average distance travelled @xmath42 also show sharp differences in the two models . in model",
    "a , these quantities are largely affected by the presence of the phase transition at @xmath60 ; there is non - monotonic behaviour in model a. we may add the remark here that although the behaviour of @xmath40 and @xmath42 have clearly different behaviour in the two models , the variation with @xmath6 in model a for @xmath116 and in model b for @xmath117 is quite similar for both quantities .",
    "note that in these two regions @xmath66 and thus the agents are happy on an average , which seems to be the relevant factor determining the trends of @xmath40 and @xmath42",
    ". it will be interesting to compare these findings with real data , if available , in future studies .    in a way ,",
    "model b is a semi - constrained model as movements are less restricted here and perhaps it is not entirely surprising that the segregation occurs here to a larger extent .",
    "however , the absence of the frozen state is a complete surprise .",
    "the present model with continuous utility ( model b ) shows that moves which make utility larger , but not necessarily positive , helps in attaining segregated states more effectively .",
    "in contrast to the unconstrained model , this is a more realistic strategy as in the unconstrained model , the tendency to move keeping the utility factor unchanged does not seem to be practical . on the other hand , in the study of the constrained model b , we get the important message that even if one can not achieve the ideal state in a single step , it is worthwhile if an action brings one closer to it .",
