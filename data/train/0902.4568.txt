    "a leading candidate for the cold dark matter of the universe is the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm)@xcite .",
    "astrophysical constraints require the lsp to be colorless and chargeless , while direct dark matter ( dm ) search experiments strongly disfavour a sneutrino lsp .",
    "thus the favoured candidate for lsp in the mssm is the lightest neutralino @xmath3 the neutralino mass matrix is given by @xmath4 where @xmath5,@xmath6 and @xmath7 are the bino , wino and higgsino mass parameters ; and @xmath8 represents the ratio of two higgs vacuum expectation values .",
    "the lsp is the lightest eigenstate of the mass matrix .",
    "it can be a dominantly bino , wino or higgsino state or else a large admixture of these interaction eigenstates .",
    "much of the mssm phenomenology so far has been done in the context of minimal supergravity ( msugra)@xcite model , because of its simplicity and economy of parameters .",
    "this model predicts a dominantly bino lsp over the bulk of the parameter space .",
    "the bino does not couple to gauge bosons since it does not carry any gauge charge .",
    "so the main annihilation mechanism of the bino dark matter is via @xmath9-channel slepton exchange , @xmath10 .",
    "however the large slepton mass limits from lep@xcite , particularly in the msugra model , makes this annihilation mechanism inefficient .",
    "this leads to a gross overabundance of the dm relic density over the bulk of the msugra parameter space .",
    "there are only narrow strips of parameter space , like the stau coannihilation ( @xmath11 ) and resonant annihilation ( @xmath12 ) regions giving cosmologically compatible dm relic density@xcite which require however some stringent mass correlations between the annihilating lsps and the intermediate particle in the @xmath13-channel resonance or between a coannihilating sparticle and the lsp .",
    "in contrast , the higgsino and wino carry weak isospin @xmath14 and @xmath15 respectively .",
    "so a higgsino and wino - dominated lsp can pair - annihilate efficiently via their couplings to the @xmath16 gauge bosons , leading to an underabundance of dm relic density for sub - tev lsp masses .",
    "one can get cosmologically compatible relic density only for relatively large lsp masses of @xmath17 and @xmath18 , which make these models inaccessible to lhc .",
    "they can only be probed at a multi - tev linear collider like clic@xcite .",
    "it is evident from the above discussion that a mixed bino - higgsino or bino - wino lsp is expected to give cosmologically compatible dm relic density for sub - tev lsp masses , which can be probed at the lhc .",
    "this has been described as the ` well - tempered ' scenario in ref.@xcite .",
    "the dm relic density and the detection phenomenology of this scenario have been studied in a model independent way in ref.@xcite .",
    "it should be mentioned here that a very important example of the mixed bino - higgsino lsp occurs in the so - called hyperbolic branch / focus point ( hb / fp)@xcite region of msugra model .",
    "this is a narrow strip at the edge of the msugra parameter space , corresponding to very large ( multi - tev ) scalar masses .    in this work",
    ", we investigate a class of nonuniversal gaugino mass models , where the mixed neutralino lsp can be realised in a simple and economical way .",
    "in particular we construct two models @xmath19 the first giving a mixed bino - higgsino lsp and the second giving a mixed bino - wino lsp .",
    "the latter model also gives a triply mixed bino - wino - higgsino lsp over a significant part of the parameter space . for each of these two models",
    "we find cosmologically compatible dm relic density over broad bands passing through the middle of the parameter space in the @xmath20 plane .",
    "we also investigate the expected signals in both cases for direct and indirect dm detection experiments . in each case",
    "we find promising signals for future direct detection experiments .",
    "likewise we find promising indirect detection signals in each case for the icecube experiment , in the form of high energy neutrinos coming from dm pair - annihilation inside the sun .",
    "we also estimate the corresponding line and continuum @xmath0 ray signals coming from their pair - annihilation in the galactic core .",
    "we conclude with a brief discussion of the expected collider signatures of these models at lhc .",
    "sugra models with nonuniversal gaugino masses at the gut scale have been studied in many earlier works@xcite .",
    "we shall only summarize the main results here , focusing on the simplest and most predictive gut group , @xmath21 . here",
    "the gauge kinetic function that is related to the gut scale gaugino masses , arises from the vacuum expectation value of the @xmath22-term of a chiral superfield @xmath23 , which is responsible for susy breaking .",
    "this results in a dimension five term in the lagrangian ,",
    "l _ i _ j , where @xmath24 are the @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 gaugino fields @xmath19 bino ( @xmath28 ) , wino ( @xmath29 ) and gluino ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "since the gauginos belong to the adjoint representation of @xmath21 , @xmath23 and @xmath31 can belong to any of the irreducible representations appearing in their symmetric product , i.e. _ symm = 1 + 24 + 75 + 200 .",
    "the minimal sugra model assumes @xmath23 to be a singlet , implying equal gaugino masses at the gut scale . on the other hand if @xmath23 belongs to one of the nonsinglet representations of @xmath21 , then these gaugino masses are unequal but related to one another via the representation invariants .",
    "thus the three gaugino masses at the gut scale in a given representation @xmath32 are determined in terms of a single susy breaking mass parameter @xmath33 by m^g_1,2,3 = c^n_1,2,3 m^n_1/2 , [ relativegauginos ] where [ wts ] c^1_1,2,3=(1,1,1 ) ,  c^24_1,2,3=(-1,-3,2 ) ,  c^75_1,2,3=(-5,3,1 ) ,  c^200_1,2,3=(10,2,1 ) .",
    "the nonuniversal gaugino mass models are known to be consistent with the observed universality of the gauge couplings at the gut scale  @xcite , with @xmath34 .",
    "since the gaugino masses evolve like the corresponding gauge couplings at one - loop level of the renormalisation group equations ( rge ) , the three gaugino masses at the electroweak ( ew ) scale are proportional to the corresponding gauge couplings , i.e. m_1 & = & ( _ 1/_g ) m_1^g ( 25/60 ) c_1^n m^n_1/2 + m_2 & = & ( _ 2/_g ) m_2^g ( 25/30)c_2^n m^n_1/2 + m_3 & = & ( _ 3/_g ) m_3^g ( 25/9 ) c_3^n m^n_1/2 .",
    "[ gauginoew ] for simplicity we shall assume a universal susy breaking scalar mass @xmath35 at the gut scale .",
    "then the scalar masses at the electroweak scale are given by the renormalisation group evolution formulae  @xcite .",
    "a very important susy breaking mass parameter at this scale is @xmath36 , which appears in the ew symmetry breaking condition , ^2 + m_z^2/2= m_h_d^2 -m_h_u^2 ^ 2 -m_h_u^2 .",
    "the last equality holds for the @xmath37 region , which is favoured by the higgs mass limit from lep2  @xcite . expressing @xmath38 at the right in terms of the gut scale parameters via the one - loop rge gives  @xcite ^2 + m_z^2 & & -0.1m_0 ^ 2 + 2.1 m_3^g^2 -0.22 m_2^g^2 -0.006m_1^g^2 + 0.006 m_1^g m_2^g + + & & 0.19 m_2^g m_3^g + 0.03 m_1^g m_3^g , [ musqeqn ] at a representative value of @xmath39 , neglecting the contribution from the trilinear coupling term at the gut scale .",
    "moreover , the coefficients vary rather mildly over the moderate @xmath8 region .",
    "although we shall use exact numerical solutions to the two - loop rge in our analysis , one important result is worth noting from the simple formulae of eqs .",
    "( [ relativegauginos],[wts],[gauginoew],[musqeqn ] ) . for the singlet and @xmath40-plate representations of the susy breaking chiral superfield @xmath23",
    ", we have @xmath41 .",
    "this corresponds to a bino lsp , resulting in overabundance of dm relic density over most of the parameter space .",
    "on the other hand , for the @xmath42-plate and @xmath43-plate representations we get @xmath44 .",
    "this corresponds to a higgsino lsp , resulting in underabundance of dm relic density@xcite .    in general the gauge kinetic function",
    "may contain several chiral superfields , belonging to different representations of @xmath21 , which gives us the freedom to vary the relative magnitudes of @xmath5,@xmath6 and @xmath7 continuously .",
    "in particular we shall consider two models , where the gauge kinetic function contains a mixture of singlet plus @xmath42-plet superfields  ( @xmath45 ) in the first case and a singlet plus @xmath43-plet superfields  ( @xmath46 ) in the second . by adjusting the relative contribution from the two superfields",
    "we shall obtain a mixed bino - higgsino lsp in the first case and a mixed bino - wino lsp in the second , each giving favourable dm relic density over large regions of the parameter space .",
    "it should be mentioned here that mixtures of singlet and nonsinglet superfield contributions were first discussed in ref.@xcite . moreover , the @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 models were considered in the context of i ) direct detection of neutralino dm in ref.@xcite , and ii ) a bino dm in ref@xcite , where in the latter the relative contribution from the two superfields were adjusted to recover the bulk annihilation region of the right dm relic density in each case .",
    "nonuniversal gaugino mass models based on such mixed representations have also been considered more recently to investigate the higgs production phenomenology via susy cascade decay@xcite .",
    "to the best of our knowledge however , this is the first investigation of such nonuniversal gaugino mass models , to obtain the right relic density via mixed neutralino dm . as in @xcite",
    ", we shall vary the relative contribution of the two superfields via a single parameter , i.e m^1_1/2=(1-_75)m_1/2  and  m^75_1/2=_75m_1/2 , for the ( 1 + 75 ) model and m^1_1/2=(1-_200)m_1/2  and  m^200_1/2= _ 200m_1/2 , for the ( 1 + 200 ) model .",

    "750.50 |m_1| || m_1/2 < |m_2| for @xmath50 .",

    "( [ musqeqn ] ) that decreasing @xmath35 leads to increase of @xmath51 and hence decrease of higgsino fraction of lsp .",

    "a quantitative investigation of the lhc signature of these two nonuniversal gaugino mass models is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "we shall only remark on some prominent features , which are quite evident from the susy spectra of table  [ tab75 ] and [ tab200 ] .",
    "table  [ tab75 ] clearly shows an inverted mass hierarchy for the @xmath48 model where the lighter stop is about @xmath66 lighter than the 1st and 2nd generation squarks . moreover it is lighter than the gluinos over most of the parameter space .",
    "so one expects a susy signal from the channels [ lhc ] pp g g t t t_1 t_1 ,  pp t_1 t_1 inclusive of their antiparticles . in view of the singlet dominance of @xmath67 ,",
    "one expects it to decay via mainly gauge ( yukawa ) coupling to @xmath68 into [ decay-75 ] t_1 t ^0_1,2,3 ,  b ^+_1 .",
    "since all these neutralino and chargino states are nearly degenerate , we expect their @xmath69 to be largely carried by the lsp(@xmath70 ) , giving relatively large missing-@xmath69 ( @xmath71 ) events along with soft jets ( leptons ) .",
    "note however that one expects hard leptons and @xmath64-jets from the decay of the top quarks in ( [ lhc ] ) and ( [ decay-75 ] ) , resulting in hard and isolated multilepton@xmath72missing @xmath69 signal accompanied by @xmath73 @xmath64-jets for the pair production of gluon ( stop ) .",
    "the susy spectra of table  [ tab200 ] also shows an inverted hierarchy for the @xmath49 model with the @xmath67 being much lighter than the other squarks .",
    "moreover it is lighter than the gluino over essentially the entire parameter space . because of the rather heavy mass range of squarks and gluino in this model",
    "we expect a very important contribution to the lhc susy signal to come from the pair production of @xmath67",
    ". note that in this case the dominant decay channels are [ decay-200 ] t_1 t ^0_1,2,3,4 ,  b ^+_2 , since the higgsino dominated states are the heavier chargino and neutralino states @xmath74 .",
    "however these states are also quite close to the lsp @xmath70 in this case .",
    "therefore one expects signal characteristics as the earlier model .",
    "it should be mentioned here that similar characteristics of the lhc signal was noted for the focus point region of the msugra model in @xcite , and has since been studied in detail in @xcite .",
    "one expects similar features for these nonuniversal gaugino mass models of the mixed neutralino lsp as well . only in these models",
    "one can have relatively light scalar mass @xmath35 , so that the lighter @xmath67 is seen to be even lighter than the gluino , unlike the focus point case .",
    "we have investigated the dark matter properties of non - universal gaugino mass scenarios where the gauge kinetic energy function is a mixture of chiral superfields that transforms as singlet and the 75-dimensional or the singlet and the 200 dimensional representation of su(5 ) .",
    "the mixing of the representaions are chosen so as to probe the dark matter annihilation properties of lsps that are either a strong mixture of bino and higgsinos in the 1 + 75 model or a mixture of bino - wino or even a mixture of bino - wino - higgsinos in the 1 + 200 model .",
    "for each of the scenarios we have analyzed the dark matter relic density in relation to the wmap data and we have obtained broad regions of parameter space in the @xmath20 plane that satisfy the wmap data .",
    "we have identified the annihilation and coannihilation channels .",
    "we have further computed the direct detection rates of neutralino dm for the spin - independent and spin - dependent @xmath75 cross sections .",
    "the spin - independent cross section ranges would be successfully probed in the near future via xenon-1 t .",
    "we have also computed the neutralino - annihilation induced muon flux from the sun that originates from the high energy neutrinos produced via pair - annihilation of lsps in the solar core .",
    "we have found promising signals that will easily be probed in the icecube experiment .",
    "we have also obtained interesting photon signal rates ( both monochromatic and continuum ) for the indirect detection of lsps via @xmath0-rays .",
    "fgst / glast will be able to probe a significant region of parameter space with a possible boost factor .",
    "finally , we have described a few distinctive features of the expected lhc signals of these models .    *",
