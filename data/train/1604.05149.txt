    "<S> frequency comb assisted diode laser spectroscopy , employing both the accuracy of an optical frequency comb and the broad wavelength tuning range of a tunable diode laser , has been widely used in many applications . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we present a novel method using cascaded frequency agile diode lasers , which allows extending the measurement bandwidth to 37.4 thz ( 1355  1630 nm ) at mhz resolution with scanning speeds above 1 thz / s . </S>",
    "<S> it is demonstrated as a useful tool to characterize a broadband spectrum for molecular spectroscopy and in particular it enables to characterize the dispersion of integrated microresonators up to the fourth order .    </S>",
    "<S> = 1    frequency combs @xcite , providing an equidistant grid of lines with precisely known frequencies over a broad spectral range , have substantially advanced precision spectroscopy over the past decades . to date , diverse spectroscopic methods employing frequency combs have been invented , such as direct frequency comb spectroscopy@xcite , fourier transform spectroscopy @xcite and dual - comb spectroscopy @xcite . among these methods , </S>",
    "<S> frequency comb assisted diode laser spectroscopy @xcite , enabling broadband spectral characterization with fast measurement speed ( > 1 thz / s ) and simple implementation , has been successfully applied for distance measurement @xcite , dynamic waveform detection @xcite , plasma diagnostics @xcite and molecular spectroscopy @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one application benefiting from these advantages is the dispersion characterization of high - q microresonators @xcite , while alternative methods using direct frequency comb @xcite , white light source @xcite or sideband spectroscopy @xcite have several limitations including system complexity , low measurement speed , narrow bandwidth and inability to measure microresonators with free spectral ranges ( fsr ) exceeding 100 ghz .    </S>",
    "<S> the dispersion characterization is important for the dispersion engineering of integrated high - q microresonators for kerr frequency comb generation @xcite and bright dissipative kerr soliton formation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , properly engineered higher order dispersion can lead to the emission of a dispersive wave via the process of soliton cherenkov radiation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> several techniques based on geometry variation @xcite and additional material layers @xcite have been demonstrated to tailor the dispersion . </S>",
    "<S> however , to measure the higher order dispersion of microresonators , frequency comb assisted diode laser spectroscopy is currently limited by its measurement bandwidth , which is mainly determined by the wavelength tuning range of the used laser . therefore , using more than one laser to cover different spectral ranges is desired to overcome the bandwidth limitation thus enabling measuring the higher order dispersion . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate a method to extend the measurement bandwidth by cascading two widely tunable lasers covering the wavelength range from 1355 nm to 1630 nm . </S>",
    "<S> the validity of our method is examined by molecular absorption spectroscopy . </S>",
    "<S> we subsequently use this method to characterize the dispersion of a photonic chip - based silicon nitride ( si@xmath0n@xmath1 ) microresonator @xcite whose fsr is approximately 1 thz . </S>",
    "<S> this is the first time that higher order dispersion is directly measured for such microresonators .    </S>",
    "<S> the experimental setup is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : figure1 ] and is based on the setup described in ref . @xcite . two widely tunable mode - hop - free external cavity diode lasers ( ecdl 1 , ecdl 2 , santec tsl-510 ) with wavelength tuning ranges of 1355  1505 nm and 1500  1630 nm beat with a fully - stabilized spectrally broadened erbium - doped - fiber - laser - based frequency comb ( menlosystems fc1500 , repetition rate @xmath2250 mhz , range 1050  2100 nm ) . </S>",
    "<S> a 1310 nm/1550 nm wavelength - division multiplexer ( wdm ) splits the frequency comb into two branches . </S>",
    "<S> two optical switches are synchronized , such that ecdl 1 beats with the 1310 nm branch , and successively ecdl 2 beats with the 1550 nm branch . </S>",
    "<S> the purpose of using the wdm and synchronizing the optical switches is to suppress the comb lines which do not contribute to the beat signals , thus to prevent the photodiode saturation and to improve the signal - to - noise ratio of the beat signals .    the two ecdls scan one after the other with a scan speed of 10 nm / s . </S>",
    "<S> by using the band - pass filters labeled as bp 1 , bp 2 ( center frequencies @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) , the scanning ecdl generates four `` calibration markers '' per @xmath5 interval when the frequency distance to its nearest comb line is @xmath6 or @xmath7 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the key problem is the combination of the two individual traces generated by the two ecdl scans into a single continuous trace which covers the full measurement range . </S>",
    "<S> this is solved by using an auxiliary reference laser whose wavelength @xmath8 is set in the 1500  1505 nm range where both ecdls overlap spectrally . with a low - pass filter ( bp 3 ) , in each trace a `` reference marker '' is recorded when the ecdl scans over the reference laser . </S>",
    "<S> the reference laser is set initially @xmath9 from its nearest comb line , and its long - term drift is measured as < 20 mhz / h as shown in fig . [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : figure2](b ) . as long as the reference laser drifts less than @xmath9 from its initial position within the measurement time ( @xmath1060 s ) , which can be monitored by an electrical spectrum analyzer ( esa ) </S>",
    "<S> , we can unambiguously assume that the calibration markers adjacent to the reference marker are generated by the same comb line in both traces . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , using the reference marker , the indices of the calibration markers in both traces can be matched . as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : figure2](a ) , by combining the data before the reference marker in trace 1 with the data after the reference marker in trace 2 , a complete continuous trace from 1355 nm to 1630 nm is formed .    generally to combine individual traces into a single trace </S>",
    "<S> , it is required that : ( 1 ) each ecdl scans mode - hop - free ; ( 2 ) any two adjacent ecdls have a shared wavelength range ; ( 3 ) a low - drift stable reference laser exists whose wavelength falls in each shared wavelength range ; ( 4 ) calibration markers are well - resolved in each trace . </S>",
    "<S> once the above conditions are satisfied , such setup can be extended with more than two ecdls , enabling even broader measurement bandwidth .    </S>",
    "<S> the reference laser sets the frequency reference point , and the frequency axis is calibrated with respect to the frequency comb based on @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> assuming that the ecdls scan uniformly in each @xmath5 interval , the instantaneous frequency can be interpolated with respect to @xmath3 and @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the precision of frequency determination is limited by a 2.2 mhz / point resolution limit due to the oscilloscope s maximum 10 million data points per trace , and the error due to the 2 mhz bandwidth of the bps . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the total error is estimated as 4.2 mhz / point . </S>",
    "<S> however such error will not be prominent for spectral features with > 100 mhz linewidth , as the center frequency is usually obtained by line profile fitting whose precision is then limited by the signal quality , fitting function used , resonance splitting etc .    </S>",
    "<S> the reference laser s wavelength @xmath8 is read from a wavelength meter with an imprecision of few picometers ( corresponding frequency imprecision is few hundreds mhz ) . </S>",
    "<S> such imprecision will introduce a global offset to the absolute frequency calibration , but will not affect the continuity of the trace combination and the relative frequency calibration with respect to @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the global offset ( i.e. an absolute frequency measurement ) is much less important for certain measurements such as the dispersion measurement of microresonators where the entire frequency scan needs to exhibit a precise relative frequency calibration , but not necessarily an absolute frequency calibration .    in order to examine the validity of our method , </S>",
    "<S> e.g. the continuity of the combined trace and the relative frequency calibration , we implemented a molecular absorption spectroscopy of a gas cell composed of water ( h@xmath11o ) , carbon monoxide ( co ) and acetylene ( c@xmath11h@xmath11 ) , and compared it with the absorption line data from hitran__online _ _ @xcite ( www.hitran.org ) . the normalized transmission spectrum is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : figure3](a ) and the absorption lines for each kind of molecule are marked . as the spectroscopy is not doppler - free , </S>",
    "<S> a gaussian function is used to fit the doppler broadening profile @xcite , and the linewidth distribution is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : figure3](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the fitted line - center frequencies @xmath12 are then compared with the known frequencies @xmath13 from hitran__online _ _ , and a global offset @xmath14 mhz is observed due to the reason mentioned above . </S>",
    "<S> subtracting the global offset , the frequency deviations defined by @xmath15 are plotted in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : figure3](c ) . </S>",
    "<S> all the frequency deviations are distributed in a @xmath16100 mhz range around 0 mhz , showing the continuity of the combined trace and a good global accuracy of the relative frequency calibration . </S>",
    "<S> as the co lines suffer the least doppler broadening effect due to the largest molecular mass of co , their frequencies are more precisely fitted with smaller deviations . therefore to examine the precision of the relative frequency calibration , we fit the deviation distribution of co lines with a gaussian distribution and a 13.6 mhz standard deviation is shown . </S>",
    "<S> it should be emphasized that the 13.6 mhz standard deviation is not due to the method itself , but mainly due to the ghz doppler broadening and the resulting higher statistical fitting error in determining the line - center frequencies . to eliminate the doppler broadening and to demonstrate better precision , a doppler - free spectroscopy </S>",

    "<S> , dispersion describes the variation of the fsr over frequency . </S>",
    "<S> it can be expressed in a taylor series in analogue to the fiber case as    @xmath17    here @xmath18 is the angular frequency of the @xmath19-th resonance relative to the reference resonance @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath21 corresponds to the fsr . </S>",

    "<S> we measured the dispersion of a si@xmath0n@xmath1 microresonator fabricated using the photonic damascene process @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the microresonator has a radius of 23 @xmath25 ( corresponding @xmath26 thz ) and is coupled by a single - mode bus waveguide , as shown in fig . </S>",

    "<S> both a 3@xmath31 order and a 4@xmath32 order weighted polynomial are used to fit the @xmath29 , while the reference resonance @xmath33 is chosen at 193.12 thz ( 1553.5 nm ) . </S>",
    "<S> the fit is performed by weighting each resonance according to the inverse of its linewidth , as the center frequencies of broader resonances are less precisely fitted . as shown in fig . [ fig : figure4](d ) , the 4@xmath32 order weighted polynomial shows better fitting than the 3@xmath31 order one , indicating the necessity to consider the fourth order dispersion parameter @xmath34 in the fit . the dispersion parameters extracted from the 4@xmath32 order polynomial fit for both tm@xmath27 and tm@xmath28 </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : figure4](e ) plots the fitted linewidths of the tm@xmath27 mode . </S>",
    "<S> the global trend showing decreasing linewidth with increasing frequency is due to the fact that the waveguide - resonator external coupling strength is wavelength - dependent @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , an avoided modal crossing @xcite is identified around 213 thz where both modes have approximately the same local resonance frequency . </S>",
    "<S> at such a modal crossing point , the resonances deviate from the fitted dispersion curve and a local linewidth broadening is observed .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> we have presented a novel way to extend frequency comb assisted diode laser spectroscopy with cascaded lasers , enabling a full measurement bandwidth of 37.4 thz ( 1355  1630 </S>",
    "<S> nm ) at mhz resolution with scanning speeds above 1 thz / s . </S>",
    "<S> we show potential applications for molecular spectroscopy and for the measurement of higher order dispersion in microresonators which we demonstrate here for the first time in a si@xmath0n@xmath1 photonic chip - based microresonator . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore the described cascaded laser spectroscopy can be extended with more lasers , enabling a further increase of the measurement bandwidth . </S>"
