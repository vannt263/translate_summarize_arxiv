    "in his landmark 1954 paper @xcite , milnor introduced his epinonomous higher order linking numbers , and proved that when the multi - index @xmath2 had no repeated index , the @xmath3 were invariants of link homotopy . in a follow up paper @xcite ,",
    "milnor explored some of the properties of invariants with repeated indices .",
    "milnor s invariants have been studied extensively since that time . for string links ,",
    "these invariants are known to be finite type @xcite , and in fact related to ( the tree part of ) the kontsevich integral in a natural and beautiful way @xcite .    by work of habiro @xcite ,",
    "the finite type invariants of knots are intimately related to claper surgery .",
    "taking the view that link homotopy is generated by degree one clasper surgery on the link where both leaves of the clasper are on the same component , is it possible that milnor s isotopy invariants have some relation with clasper surgery ?    the answer is yes .",
    "let us define a _",
    "self @xmath0-move _ on a link @xmath4 to be a degree @xmath1 simple tree clasper surgery on @xmath4 where all leaves of the clasper are on the same component .",
    "if @xmath5 is obtained from @xmath4 by a sequence of self @xmath0-moves , we call @xmath4 and @xmath5 _ self @xmath0-equivalent_. these moves were introduced in @xcite , and as we have mentioned , self @xmath6-equivalence is link homotopy .    for an @xmath7-component link ,",
    "milnor invariants are specified by a multi - index @xmath2 , where the entries of @xmath2 are chosen from @xmath8 .",
    "let @xmath9 denote the maximum number of times that any index appears .",
    "a milnor invariant @xmath3 is called _ realizable _ if there exists a link @xmath4 with @xmath10 .    our main result is the following .",
    "* theorem [ mainthm ] * _ let @xmath3 be a realizable milnor number .",
    "then @xmath3 is an invariant of self @xmath0-equivalence if and only if @xmath11 . _",
    "notice that a self @xmath0-equivalence can be realized by self @xmath12-moves when @xmath13 , and thus self @xmath0-equivalence classes form a filtration of link homotopy classes . moving to",
    "larger and larger @xmath1 provides more and more information about the structure of isotopy classes of links .",
    "the classification of links up to link homotopy has been completed by habegger and lin @xcite . however , very little is known about the structure of links under these higher order moves .",
    "nakanishi and ohyama have classified two component links up to self @xmath14-equivalence @xcite , and it is known that boundary links are self @xmath14-equivalent to the trivial link @xcite .",
    "it is well known that milnor s link homotopy invariants vanish if and only if the link is link homotopic to the unlink . however , in example [ c3eg ] we will produce a boundary link that is not self @xmath15-equivalent to the unlink . as all milnor invariants vanish for boundary links , this example demonstrates that self @xmath0-equivalence behaves very differently for @xmath16 .",
    "much work remains to be done before we have a clear understanding of self @xmath0-equivalence .",
    "we define a self @xmath0-move to be surgery on a simple , tree - like degree @xmath1 clasper , all of whose leaves are on the same component . similarly , @xmath4 is self @xmath0-equivalent to @xmath5 if @xmath5 can be obtained from @xmath4 by a sequence of self @xmath0-moves .",
    "note that link homotopy is the same as self @xmath6-equivalence , and the self - delta equivalence of shibuya @xcite is the same as self @xmath14-equivalence .    for an @xmath7-component link ,",
    "milnor invariants are specified by a multi - index @xmath2 , where the entries of @xmath2 are chosen from @xmath8 .",

    "[ mainthm ]    suppose that @xmath11 and @xmath4 is self @xmath0-equivalent to @xmath5 .",
    "since milnor s invariants are well known to be isotopy invariants , it suffices to check a single self @xmath0-move realized by a clapser @xmath17 .",
    "the case @xmath18 is that of link homotopy , and was proven by milnor in @xcite .",
    "thus , we need only consider the case @xmath19 . to calculate @xmath20 ( resp .",
    "@xmath21 ) where @xmath2 has repeated indices , we may instead study the link homotopy invariants of @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) , the link obtained by taking the appropriate number of zero framed parallels of the components of @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) @xcite .",
    "in particular , if component @xmath24 of @xmath22 corresponds to componet @xmath25 of @xmath4 , then @xmath26 .",
    "since @xmath19 , the self @xmath0-move preserves the framing of the components of @xmath4 . that is , the clasper surgery carrying @xmath4 to @xmath5 carries @xmath22 to @xmath23 .",
    "the self @xmath0-move is realized by surgery on @xmath17 , that is , a clasper with @xmath27 leaves where all of these leaves land on the same component of @xmath4 .",
    "replace @xmath4 with @xmath22 .",
    "as @xmath11 , @xmath22 has at most @xmath1 copies each component of @xmath4 , so each leaf of the clasper @xmath17 grips at most @xmath1 components of @xmath22 .",
    "further , as each leaf of @xmath17 was on the same component of @xmath4 , each leaf of @xmath17 holds the same components of @xmath22 .",
    "use the zip construction on @xmath17 to produce simple claspers on @xmath22 . for a version of the zip construction without `` boxes '' , see 4.2 of @xcite .",
    "each simple clasper has at least two leaves on the same component of @xmath22 , and so is realized by link homotopy .",
    "see proposition [ easyprop ] .",
    "we have shown that @xmath22 is link homotopic to @xmath23 , so @xmath28 for all link homotopy invariants .",
    "hence , when @xmath11 , @xmath29 .",
    "suppose that @xmath30 .",
    "since the milnor invariant is realizable , by work of cochran @xcite , there exists a link @xmath4 where @xmath10 , and all lower order milnor invariants vanish .",
    "such a link can be obtained by bing doubling a hopf link along a trivalent tree whose leaves are labeled by @xmath2 , and then band summing components with the same label .",
    "this process is the same as a simple tree clasper surgery on the unlink , using the same tree , where leaves labeled @xmath24 grasp the @xmath24th component .",
    "since some index @xmath24 in @xmath2 is repeated at least @xmath27 times , this clasper has at least @xmath27 leaves on component @xmath24 and so can be realized by self @xmath0-moves .",
    "see proposition [ easyprop ] .    as all milnor invariants of the unlink vanish , we have that @xmath20 is not a self @xmath0 invariant when @xmath30 .",
    "we end this section with an example that demonstrates the power of our methods .",
    "self @xmath14-equivalence of links is equivalent to self - delta equivalence , a relation that has been extensively studied .",
    "much of this work relies on invariants of self @xmath14-(self - delta)-equivalence that are based on the coefficients of the conway polynomial .",
    "let @xmath4 be the whitehead double of the borromean rings ( equivalently the bing double of the whitehead link ) .",
    "see figure [ whbring ] .",
    "the alexander polynomial of this link is trivial is also @xmath31 . ] , but @xmath32 .",
    "thus , @xmath4 has trivial conway polynomial , but is not self @xmath14-equivalent to the unlink .",
    "( 140,122 )",
    "in the proof of theorem [ mainthm ] we used the fact that simple clasper surgery with multiple leaves on a single component could be converted to a self @xmath0-equivalence . in this section , we will find a partial converse to that fact and demonstrate its usefulness in the study of self @xmath0-equivalence .",
    "we say @xmath4 and @xmath5 are @xmath33-equivalent if @xmath4 can be transformed into @xmath5 by ambient isotopy and degree @xmath34 simple tree clasper surgery , where at least @xmath1 leaves of the clasper grasp component @xmath24 .",
    "suppose now that @xmath17 is a clasper representing a @xmath37 move",
    ". we will show that it is @xmath35-equivalent to a @xmath35 move .",
    "begin with the clasper @xmath17 .",
    "introduce a clasper @xmath38 representing a @xmath35-move as in figure [ clasperslide ] ( 2 ) .",
    "we choose @xmath38 so that by reversing the zip construction , we obtain the clapser with boxes shown in figure [ clasperslide ] . by move 12 of @xcite",
    ", we obtain the clasper @xmath39 , which is degree @xmath34 and has @xmath27 feet on component @xmath24 .",
    "thus , we can reduce any @xmath35-move to a sequence of @xmath40-moves , which is merely a self @xmath0-equivalence .",
    "let @xmath4 be an @xmath7 component brunnian link , and @xmath43 the @xmath7 component unlink .",
    "then @xmath4 is self @xmath0-equivalent to @xmath43 if and only if @xmath4 is @xmath44-equivalent to @xmath43 . [ bruneq ]    the ` if ' part follows from proposition [ easyprop ] .",
    "we will show the ` only if ' part .",
    "the idea of this proof is similar to that of theorem 1.2 in @xcite .",
    "while in @xcite they use the ` _ _ band description _",
    "_ ' defined in @xcite , we will use clasper theory .",
    "assume that @xmath4 and @xmath43 are self @xmath45-equivalent .",

    "we can describe @xmath4 as the unlink @xmath47 with claspers @xmath48 representing the self @xmath45-moves on the @xmath24th component .",
    "since @xmath4 is brunnian , @xmath49 is the unlink .",
    "thus , @xmath4 is obtained from the trivial link by @xmath45-moves corresponding to @xmath50 and by crossing changes between @xmath51 and @xmath52 .    passing a clasper through @xmath53 results in two new claspers , one of degree @xmath27 which has a new leaf on @xmath53 , and one of degree @xmath1 which does not .",

    "let @xmath5 be the link obtained by surgering the unlink @xmath47 only on the @xmath55 . by the construction of the @xmath55 , @xmath58 .",
    "since @xmath4 is brunnian , @xmath5 is the unlink , and so the claspers @xmath55 act trivially .",
    "since @xmath60 is the unlink , repeating the argument above shows that @xmath4 is expressed as the unlink @xmath47 with claspers @xmath61 of degree @xmath27 that have leaves on @xmath62 and claspers @xmath63 of degree @xmath64 that have leaves on @xmath65 .    repeating these process for each @xmath46",
    ", finally , we can express @xmath4 as the unlink @xmath47 with claspers @xmath66 of degree @xmath67 that have leaves on @xmath68 .",

    ", @xmath4 is not @xmath72-equivalent to the trivial link . using proposition [ bruneq ]",
