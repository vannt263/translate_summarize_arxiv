    "to distinguish crystals from liquids by the presence or absence of periodic order , while operationally sound , is a lob - sided and potentially misguided basis for the description of either material .",
    "clearly , the absence of periodicity in the liquid tells us only what the liquid is not . as for the crystal",
    ", periodicity can indeed describe the local arrangements of particles that determine the energetics of the phase , but only for crystals with small unit cells .",
    "a more generally useful distinction between the two phases is that a crystal is structurally homogeneous while a liquid is structurally heterogeneous . in a survey of the 4264 structures of the inorganic crystal structure data base",
    ", daams and villars  @xcite found that @xmath0 exhibited only 4 or less distinct local coordination environments .",
    "a survey  @xcite of molecular crystals found that @xmath1 consisted of only a single distinct coordination site .",
    "in contrast , simulations of amorphous binary alloys regularly report between 15 and 20 distinct local coordination polyhedra occurring with significant frequency .",
    "this number can only increase in the 3 to 5 component alloys frequently used in bulk metallic glasses .",
    "an approach to liquids based on the multiple possible local coordination structures would , by default , also cover the crystal structures .",
    "this consistent representation of the structure of both condensed phases provides one the fundamental motivations for the subject of this paper .    to refer to an arrangement of particles as a structure is to imply that it can be intelligibly decomposed into some finite number of components .",
    "a number of choices for these components have been considered ",
    "voronoi polyhedral  @xcite , delaunay tessellations  @xcite , common neighbours  @xcite , bond ring statistics  @xcite and tetrahedrality  @xcite .",
    "one of the most common is the local coordination polyhedra  @xcite  similar to a delaunay vertex except that the neighbours are defined by a cutoff separation rather than a geometric condition based on space - filling .",
    "the uses of local coordination shells to construct complex extended structures is the basis of the classic work of frank and kasper  @xcite .",
    "the coordination polyhedra have the appealing property that , for liquids comprised of particles that interact only by short range potentials , the potential energy is completely specified by the statistics of the coordination shells .",
    "the other attractive feature of any structural description is data compression .",
    "indeed , the full description of the environment of a particle involves @xmath2 continuous degrees of freedom , where @xmath3 is the number of neighbours of a site and @xmath4 the space dimension .",
    "in contrast , once a dictionary of distinct structures has been established , the local environment can be specified simply by indicating in which of the @xmath5 possible environments the particle is .",
    "such structural characterizations , therefore , correspond to a substantial coarse - graining ( or ` up scaling '  @xcite ) .",
    "what is neglected in this description are the continuum of distortions  local and global - that would effectively differentiate each local structure and result in elastic - like coupling between local structures over an extended range .",
    "the discretization of the space of structures gained through this coarse graining approximation is of considerable benefit for the calculation of the liquid free energy  both in terms of the mathematical practicalities ( replacing integrals by sums ) and in providing some sort of intuition regarding the connection between the particle properties and the stability of their liquid .    in a recent series of paper  @xcite , procaccia and co",
    "- workers have developed an empirical approach to the construction of a free energy in terms of an explicit decomposition of liquid structures into local coordination clusters which they refer to as quasi - species .",
    "they have applied this quasi - species construction to binary atomic mixtures in 2d  @xcite and 3d  @xcite , a molecular liquid  @xcite and a liquid characterised by tetrahedral coordination  @xcite . as described in ref .",
    "@xcite , nearest neighbour clusters are categorized by the total number of particles in the coordination shell . in a binary mixture of large and small atoms , the mole fraction of clusters",
    "are then denoted as @xmath6 and @xmath7 where @xmath3 is the number of neighbours and @xmath8 or @xmath9 denote the identity of the central particle .",
    "the composition of the coordination shell is not included in this classification . given the constraints of packing ,",
    "there are only a finite number of values of @xmath3 likely to be found about a particle of a given species , so the number of types of cluster is finite ( @xmath10 in 2d and 15 - 20 in 3d for the size ratios studied  @xcite ) .",
    "next , the average value of the structure concentrations @xmath11 are calculated over a range of temperatures and then inverted to give a cluster free energy @xmath12 using    @xmath13    note that this approach has factorized the free energy by neglecting any contribution to the free energy from interactions between clusters .",
    "the resulting free energies have been found to vary linearly with t over the temperature range studied , a result that permits an enthalpy and entropy to be defined for each cluster size , _ i.e. _",
    "@xmath14    the quasi - species construction is essentially descriptive ; a strategy for finding an optimal extrapolation of the observed @xmath15 dependence of the cluster concentrations . a shortcoming of this approach is the neglect of the correlations between neighbouring local structures in the calculation of the entropy .",
    "adjacent coordination clusters must overlap , so that a specific coordination on particle will impose a constraint on the possible coordination shells of its neighbour .",
    "such constraints are geometric and hence athermal and they result in complex correlations between the concentrations of various clusters . in this paper",
    "we present an explicit treatment of this problem in the calculation of the structural entropy . to this end , we employ a lattice model of liquids , namely the favoured local structure model , which we introduce in the following section . in section 3",
    "we derive an explicit expression for the liquid free energy in the high temperature limit based on an expansion in powers of the structure concentrations . a comparison between the approximate theory and monte carlo calculations is presented . in section 4",
    "we consider the extension of the treatment to address the free energy of the solid - liquid interface .",
    "the central challenge to developing a statistical mechanics based on local structures is to handle the identification and counting of these structures . allowing particles to only occupy discrete positions in space  _",
    "i.e. _ considering a lattice liquid  significantly simplifies these difficulties .",
    "this was a major motivation behind our development of the favoured local structure ( fls ) model .",
    "a lattice is selected and every vertex assigned one of two values .",
    "we shall refer to these two states as spin up or down .",
    "( in a standard mapping , the states can equivalently be thought of as atomic species a or b whose identity can be interchanged in a monte carlo procedure . ) the local structure associated with a given site is determined by the geometrical arrangement of the spins in the nearest neighbour sites .",
    "we can enumerate the @xmath5 possible distinct local structure , where two structures are considered distinct if they can not be transformed into each other by a rotation . for the 2d triangular lattice , @xmath16 and for the 3d face",
    "centred cubic ( fcc ) lattice we have @xmath17 .",
    "( note that in contrast with previous works  @xcite , we distinguish here spin inverted structures . )",
    "we assign an energy @xmath18 to each local structure , typically selecting a small number to have negative energies and hence be favoured ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fls ] ) .",
    "we shall refer to the model as the favoured local structure ( fls ) model .",
    "the essence of our hamiltonian is that the energy attributed to each site is determined by the entire local structure , not by the addition of pairwise interactions .",
    "a 2d version of the fls model has been studied  @xcite with the aim of establishing the relation between the choice of fls and the liquid entropy  @xcite and the freezing transition  @xcite .",
    "a novel liquid - liquid phase transition was identified , in 2d , when the fsl was chiral  @xcite .",
    "the extension of the fls model to 3d based is the subject of ref .",
    "this paper includes a comprehensive survey of the groundstates and phase transitions for all possible single fls choices on a fcc lattice .",

    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , employing periodic boundary conditions on an fcc lattice of typical size @xmath19 .",
    "we now introduce a framework to study the implications of the local structures on the liquid free energy .",
    "let @xmath20 be the vector of length @xmath5 whose components @xmath21 are the concentrations of the @xmath5 distinct local structures .",
    "the proportion of sites with local environment @xmath22 is thus equal to @xmath23 .",
    "as we include all possible environments , it follows that @xmath24 . at infinite temperature ,",
    "all spin configurations are equiprobable , and thus the concentration vector @xmath25 at infinite temperature is given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the coordination number of the lattice ( @xmath28 on the fcc lattice ) . here @xmath29 is the rotational degeneracy of @xmath22th structure , which ranges between @xmath30 ( for the all-_up _ and all-_down _ structures ) and @xmath31 ( for any of the @xmath32 minimally symmetric structures ) . for convenience we define the shifted concentrations @xmath33 such that @xmath34 as @xmath35 .",

    "( as in many real world cases ) the energy is completely determined by the numbers of different local structures , the interactions in this model are entirely entropic and , in this high @xmath15 limit , encoded within the _ interaction matrix _ @xmath43 . the _ covariance matrix _",

    "the concentration of local structure @xmath22 thus depends directly on the energy of fls @xmath53 through the term @xmath54 . at this level of approximation ,",
    "all concentrations are proportional to @xmath55 . substituting the equilibrium structural concentrations",
    ", we have    @xmath56    where @xmath57 is the key quantity that connects the energy of structures to the thermodynamic properties of the liquid . note",
    "that this quantity not only involves the structures energies , but also the entropic interaction between favoured structures . using eq .",
    "[ eq : ek ] to replace @xmath15 by @xmath58 we can write the microcanonical expression for the entropy ,    @xmath59    we note that a number of authors  @xcite have reported that the dependence of the configurational entropy on the inherent structure energy is well described by a quadratic function similar to that in eq .",
    "[ eq : micro ] .",
    "to evaluate the quantity @xmath60 in the expressions above , we need the matrix elements of the covariance matrix @xmath44 . for a system of @xmath40 sites ,",
    "the elements of @xmath44 are related to the correlations between fluctuations of concentration of structures at infinite temperature through @xmath61 recalling that @xmath62 , a value of @xmath63 corresponds to the case where concentrations of the two local structures correlate positively , due to a geometrical affinity for one another ( _ i.e. _ the presence of one structure facilitates the formation of the other in its neighbourhood ) while @xmath64 indicates a geometric antipathy between structures @xmath22 and @xmath53 . in this sense",
    ", the matrix @xmath44 ( or its inverse @xmath43 ) encapsulates the essential constraints imposed by the local structures in space , at least at the level of the pairwise overlap .",
    "note that the matrix @xmath44 ( unlike @xmath60 ) is independent of what energies",
    "are assigned to the local structures and so a single matrix applies for all possible versions of the fls model .    in practice , we compute exactly the covariances in eq .  [ eq : c ] by noting that it can be written as a finite sum of probabilities .",
    "indeed , working on the value of the infinite - temperature correlation between concentrations @xmath65 , we have : @xmath66 where @xmath67 and @xmath68 are two lattice sites , and @xmath69 equals one if the site at position @xmath67 is in the local environment @xmath22 , and zero otherwise . using translation invariance , we can set @xmath70 and write : @xmath71 where @xmath72 denotes the joint probability that site @xmath73 is in the local structure @xmath22 and site @xmath74 is in @xmath53 . if these two structures do not share any lattice site , they are independent at infinite temperature , and the probability thus factorizes to the average concentrations at infinite temperature @xmath75 .",
    "going back to the shifted concentrations @xmath76 , we can thus write : @xmath77 where @xmath78 means that we consider only positions @xmath74 whose local environment overlap with that of @xmath73 .",

    "some attempts at simplifying the expression for the entropy are informative .",
    "consider the following naive treatment of the problem in which we let each site be assigned one of the possible local structures independently of their neighbours .",
    "the result is a massive overestimation of the entropy as we have replaced the true number of possible states for a site , _ i.e. _ @xmath86 , with the very much larger number @xmath94 of possible local structures ( with their rotational variants ) .",
    "the lesson here is that local structures inherently span over several degrees of freedom , and so they can not decouple completely . we can however obtain a useful approximation by assuming that overlaps between structures are `` neutral '' , _",
    "i.e. _ that the presence of an fls at a given site does not affect the probability of having an fls at nearby sites . in this case , the entropy depends only on the symmetry properties of the local structures , which are encoded in the infinite - temperature concentration @xmath95 of fls @xmath22 ( eq .

    "structure in liquids matters most when we are interested in how that liquid will respond to some perturbation .",
    "a crystal surface , for example , will grow if the perturbations in local crystal order that it induces in the adjacent liquid are unstable and result in the propagation of the interface .",
    "crystal nucleation theory seeks to describe the unstable wing of the ( metastable ) equilibrium distribution of the local structures in the supercooled liquid .",

    "we have presented a formalism in which the free energy of a liquid is expressed explicitly in terms of the local coordination structure .",
    "the novel feature of this theory is the treatment of the structural contribution to the entropy which allows us to describe the entropic consequences of the geometry of an individual favoured local structure and the impact of multiple favoured local structures .",
    "the connection between structure and entropy arises from the overlap of the local coordination shells and the degree of local structural constraint this imposes .",
