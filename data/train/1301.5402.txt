    "the usual approaches for an explanation of the late - time acceleration of the universe are characterized by a departure from conventional cosmology . the proposed models , either assume the existence of dark energy @xcite , or require a modification of general relativity at cosmological distance scales @xcite , ( cf .",
    "@xcite for comprehensive reviews and references ) .",
    "less explored is the idea that the geometry of spacetime is not the so far assumed lorentz geometry ( see for example @xcite ) . due to its simplicity weyl geometry",
    "is considered as the most natural candidate for extending the lorentzian structure .",
    "we recall that a weyl space is a manifold endowed with a metric @xmath0 and a linear symmetric connection @xmath1 which are interrelated via @xmath2 where the 1-form @xmath3 is customarily called weyl covariant vector field ( see the appendix in @xcite for a detailed exposition of the techniques involved in weyl geometry ) .",
    "we denote by @xmath4 the levi - civita connection of the metric @xmath5    a consistent way to incorporate an arbitrary connection into the dynamics of a gravity theory is the so - called constrained variational principle @xcite . applying this method in the context of weyl geometry to",
    "the lagrangian @xmath6 one obtains the field equations@xmath7 where @xmath8 is the symmetric part of the einstein tensor ( see equations ( 30 ) and ( 31 ) in @xcite ) .",
    "if we express the tensors @xmath8 and @xmath9 in terms of the quantities formed with the levi - civita connection @xmath4 , the field equations become @xmath10 in the case of integrable weyl geometry , i.e. , when @xmath11 the source term is that of a massless scalar field .",
    "taking the divergence of ( [ field1 ] ) and using the bianchi identities we conclude that @xmath12    in this paper we study friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) cosmologies in a weyl framework . in section 2",
    "we explore the field equations derived from the lagrangian @xmath13 where the matter lagrangian , @xmath14 is chosen so that ordinary matter is described by a perfect fluid .",
    "it is shown that the presence of the weyl vector field can be interpreted as a fluid and we analyze the asymptotic behavior of the models .",
    "assuming an energy exchange between the two fluids we extend previous work @xcite . in section 3",
    "we consider a modification of the einstein - hilbert lagrangian , cf .",
    "( [ action ] ) , which may provide a mechanism of accelerating expansion .",
    "in the following we assume an initially expanding frw universe with expansion scale factor @xmath15 and hubble function @xmath16 .",
    "we adopt the metric and curvature conventions of @xcite .",
    "an overdot denotes differentiation with respect to time @xmath17 and units have been chosen so that @xmath18 ordinary matter is described by a perfect fluid with energy - momentum tensor , @xmath19 supplemented with an equation of state @xmath20 .",
    "since for spatially homogeneous and isotropic spacetimes there is no preferred direction , @xmath21 must be proportional to the fluid velocity @xmath22 , i.e. , @xmath23 ( in vacuum , we have to make the assumption that @xmath21 is hypersurface orthogonal , i.e. it is proportional to the unit timelike vector field which is orthogonal to the homogeneous hypersurfaces ) . formally the right - hand side of ( [ field1 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath24 with @xmath25 i.e. , the equation of state of the @xmath26fluid corresponds to stiff matter .",
    "therefore we are dealing with a two - fluid model with total energy density and pressure given by @xmath27 respectively , where @xmath28 i.e. , @xmath29 and @xmath30    the field equations are the friedmann equation @xmath31 and the raychaudhuri equation@xmath32   .\\label{rayc1}\\ ] ]    the bianchi identities imply that the total energy - momentum tensor is conserved , so that an interaction between the two fluids is induced .",
    "it is necessary to make an assumption about the interaction between the two fluids ( cf @xcite ) , otherwise the field equations constitute an underdetermined system of differential equations .",
    "the simplest assumption is that the energy - momentum of each fluid is separately conserved , so that the two fluids do not interact and the densities decay independently,@xmath33 the dynamical system ( [ frie1])-([cons ] ) was analyzed in @xcite .",
    "it was found that in expanding models the real  fluid always dominates at late times and therefore the contribution of the weyl fluid to the total energy - momentum tensor is important only at early times .",
    "the purpose of this section is to weaken the requirement of separate conservation of the two fluids .    in many cosmological situations",
    "the transfer of energy between two fluids is important , so one may assume that the two fluids exchange energy .",
    "the following simple model was proposed by barrow and clifton ( see @xcite for motivation and further examples ) , @xmath34@xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are constants so that the total energy is conserved ( see also @xcite for a singularity analysis of the master equation derived in @xcite ) .    in the case of separately conserved fluids , equations ( [ cons ] ) imply that the sets @xmath38 and @xmath39 are invariant sets for the dynamical system and by standard arguments , if @xmath40 for some initial time @xmath41 , then @xmath42 throughout the solution .",
    "this fact can be made more transparent by the following argument .",
    "assuming that @xmath43 we define the transition variable @xmath44 $ ] @xmath45 which describes which fluid is dominant dynamically @xcite . applying the conservation equation to @xmath46 and @xmath47 ,",
    "one obtains the evolution equation of the variable @xmath48,@xmath49 which implies that the sets @xmath50 are invariant under the flow of the dynamical system .",
    "furthermore , the transition variable @xmath48 is bounded , that is , if initially @xmath44,$ ] it remains in that interval for all @xmath51 .",
    "however , the choice ( [ cons1 ] ) and ( [ cons2 ] ) , has the peculiarity that the sets @xmath38 and @xmath39 are no longer invariant sets for the dynamical system and therefore the sign of the functions @xmath46 and @xmath47 is not conserved .",
    "this is also reflected to the fact that the transition variable @xmath48 no longer satisfies ( [ chi ] ) and eventually escapes outside the interval @xmath52 $ ] , thus exhibiting unphysical behavior .    in order to circumvent these difficulties ,",
    "one has to impose further conditions on @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "it turns out that the assumption @xmath53 in ( [ cons1 ] ) and ( [ cons2 ] ) is a sufficient condition for the boundness of the function @xmath48 . with this assumption",
    "we adopt the coley and wainwright formalism @xcite , for a general model with two fluids .",
    "the state of the system consists of the couple @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the total density parameter , @xmath56 in order to allow for closed models in our analysis , we define the compactified density parameter _ _  _ _ @xmath57 ( see @xcite ) @xmath58 or @xmath59 we see that @xmath60 is bounded at the instant of maximum expansion ( @xmath61 ) and also as @xmath62 in ever - expanding models .",
    "finally , defining a new time variable @xmath63 by @xmath64 one obtains the following dynamical system @xmath65 where the constant @xmath66 is @xmath67 in our case , we always have @xmath68 the parameter @xmath69 which determines the range of @xmath48 is given by@xmath70    the phase space of the two - dimensional system ( [ 2fluidjm ] ) is the closed rectangle @xmath71   \\times\\left [   -\\chi_{\\alpha},\\chi_{\\alpha } \\right]\\ ] ] in the @xmath72 plane ( see figure 1 ) . since @xmath73 the rectangle @xmath4 is shrinked compared to the phase space in @xcite and @xcite .    ) ]    the invariant sets of the system are denoted in the following table . @xmath74{lll}\\omega=-\\pi/2 & \\text{contracting empty models } & \\omega=0,h<0\\\\ \\chi=-\\chi_{\\alpha } & \\text{scaling solution } & \\frac{\\omega_{2}}{\\omega_{1}}=\\frac{1-\\chi_{\\alpha}}{1+\\chi_{\\alpha}}\\\\ \\chi=+\\chi_{\\alpha } & \\text{scaling solution } & \\frac{\\omega_{1}}{\\omega_{2}}=\\frac{1-\\chi_{\\alpha}}{1+\\chi_{\\alpha}}\\\\ \\omega=\\pi/4 & \\text{expanding flat models } & \\omega=1,h>0\\\\ \\omega=-\\pi/4 & \\text{contracting flat models } & \\omega=1,h<0\\\\ \\omega=\\pi/2 & \\text{expanding empty models } & \\omega=0,h>0 \\end{array}\\ ] ] it is easy to verify that the equilibrium points lie at the intersection of these sets and are denoted by @xmath75 ( expanding or contracting flat model ) and @xmath76 ( expanding or contracting open model ) .",
    "the subscripts indicate which fluid dominates .",
    "linearization around the equilibrium points is sufficient for the characterization of their stability and the result is the phase portrait is shown in figure 2 .    ) with @xmath77    regions iii and iv correspond to expanding models .",
    "the @xmath78 is a past attractor of all models with @xmath79 , i.e. , the evolution near the big bang is approximated by the flat frw model where the weyl fluid dominates .",
    "open models expand indefinitely and approach at late time a scaling solution  where the weyl fluid keeps a small fraction of the total energy density .",
    "flat models expand indefinitely and the evolution is approximated by the flat frw universe at late time . in both cases the real  second fluid dominates at late times .",
    "on the other hand , any initially expanding closed model in region iii , however close to @xmath80 , eventually recollapses and the evolution is approximated by the flat frw model where the weyl fluid dominates .",
    "we therefore conclude that the weyl fluid has significant contribution only near the cosmological singularities . in expanding models",
    "the `` real '' fluid always dominates at late times and therefore the contribution of the weyl fluid to the total energy - momentum tensor is important only at early times .",
    "the field equations ( [ field1 ] ) constitute the generalization of the einstein equations in a weyl spacetime in the sense that they come from the lagrangian @xmath81 there is however an alternative view , namely that the pair @xmath82 which defines the weyl spacetime also enters into the gravitational theory and therefore , the field @xmath83 must be contained in the lagrangian independently from @xmath84 in the case of integrable weyl geometry , i.e. when @xmath85 where @xmath86 is a scalar field , the pair @xmath87 constitute the set of fundamental geometrical variables .",
    "we stress that the nature of the scalar field is purely geometric .",
    "a simple lagrangian involving the set @xmath88 is given by @xmath89 where @xmath90 is a constant and @xmath91 corresponds to the lagrangian yielding the energy - momentum tensor of a perfect fluid .",
    "motivations for considering theory ( [ action ] ) can be found in @xcite ( see also @xcite for a multidimensional approach and @xcite for an extension of ( [ action ] ) to include an exponential potential function of @xmath86 ) . by varying the action corresponding to ( [ action ] ) with respect to both @xmath92 and @xmath86 one obtains @xmath93 and@xmath94 where @xmath95 is the dalembertian operator formed with the levi - civita connection @xmath4 . as mentioned above , ordinary matter described by @xmath96 is a perfect fluid with energy density @xmath97 and pressure @xmath98 . setting @xmath99 we note that for @xmath100 the field equations are formally equivalent to general relativity with a massless scalar field coupled to a perfect fluid . in weyl",
    "spacetime the scalar field has a geometric nature and no restriction exists for the sign of the value of @xmath101 . for @xmath102",
    "the weyl field @xmath86 plays the role of a phantom scalar field and therefore , it may provide a mechanism of late time acceleration .",
    "further investigation of this issue is the subject of future research ."
