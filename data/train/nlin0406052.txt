    "after the prediction of self - trapping @xcite of an optical beam in a nonlinear medium resulting in an optical soliton @xcite , there have been many theoretical and experimental studies to stabilize such a soliton under different conditions of nonlinearity .",
    "a bright soliton in ( 1 + 1 ) dimension ( d ) in kerr medium is unconditionally stable for positive or self - focusing ( sf ) nonlinearity in the nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nls ) @xcite .",
    "however , in ( 2 + 1)d in homogeneous bulk kerr medium one can not have a stable soliton - like axisymmetric cylindrical beam @xcite . also , in ( 3 + 1)d in such a medium one can not have a stable optical wave packet that remain confined in all directions . such a confined wave packet in ( 3 + 1)d is often called a light bullet and represents the extension of a self - trapped optical beam into the temporal domain @xcite . if the nonlinearity is negative or self - defocusing ( sdf ) , any initially created soliton spreads out in both ( 2 + 1)d and ( 3 + 1)d @xcite . if the nonlinearity is positive or of sf type , any initially created soliton is unstable and eventually collapses @xcite .    recently , through a numerical simulation as well as a variational calculation based on the nls it has been shown that the axisymmetric cylindrical beam in ( 2 + 1)d can be stabilized in a layered medium if a variable nonlinearity coefficient is used in different layers @xcite .",
    "a weak modulation of the nonlinearity coefficient along the propagation direction leads to a reasonable stabilization in ( 2 + 1)d @xcite . a much better stabilization results if the kerr coefficient is a layered medium is allowed to vary between successive sdf and sf type nonlinearities , i.e. , between positive and negative values @xcite .",
    "however , it has been shown that such a modulation of the nonlinearity coefficient in a kerr medium should fail to achieve stabilization of a light bullet @xcite or a general three - dimensional soliton @xcite .    as the stabilization of a light bullet is of utmost interest",
    ", we revisit this problem and find , to great surprise , that a spatiotemporal light bullet can be stabilized in a layered kerr medium with sign - alternating nonlinearity along the propagation direction .",
    "although , the present work is of interest from a theoretical point of view , it also has phenomenological or experimental consequences .",
    "recently , it has been emphasized @xcite that large negative values of the kerr coefficient can be created by using the cascading mechanism with a large phase - mismatch parameter .",
    "it has also been suggested @xcite that a layered medium with alternating sign of nonlinearity can be created with the technique of mesoscopic self - organization .",
    "hence a stabilized light bullet can be experimentally realized in the future .",
    "to stabilize a soliton in a sf homogeneous bulk kerr medium , the repulsive kinetic pressure due to the laplacian operator in space and time in the nls has to balance the attraction due to nonlinearity .",
    "for a light bullet of size @xmath0 , kinetic pressure is proportional to @xmath1 whereas attraction is proportional to @xmath2 in @xmath3 d. the effective potential , which is a sum of these two terms , has a confining minimum only for @xmath4 leading to a stable soliton @xcite . using a variational method",
    "we find that a layered kerr medium with sign - changing nonlinearity in ( 3 + 1)d can lead to an effective potential with a minimum which can stabilize the solitons .    in sec .",
