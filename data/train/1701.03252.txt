    "recently lots of natural parity charm and charm - strange mesons are observed in experiments@xcite , which are summarized in , where we have combined the statistical , systematic and model errors in quadrature for simplicity .",
    "these new resonances have great importance in improving our knowledge of the radial and orbital charmed excitations . especially for the spin - parity @xmath0 charm and charm - strange states",
    ", there may exist the @xmath7-@xmath8 mixing , which makes the assignments more complicated .",

    "in this work , we carried out a systematical research on the potential @xmath0 open charm mesons , including the charm - strange mesons @xmath16 and @xmath11 , charm mesons @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 . the main strong decay properties by taking these natural spin - parity resonances as the @xmath7 or @xmath8 states are achieved by using the bethe - salpeter methods . in particularly , the further @xmath21-@xmath22 mixing scheme is used to explain both the @xmath0 charm and charm - strange mesons .",
    "the obtained results and predicted properties can be tested in the near future experiments .",

    "both the total widths and ratio of corresponding partial decay widths are consistent with the experimental measurements .",
    "our predicted ratio @xmath24 for @xmath11 is @xmath12 , which could be used to test this @xmath21-@xmath22 mixing scheme in future . for the corresponding charm mesons ,",
    "since the experimental measurements are not consistent with each other , the identification and assignments are much more difficult . based on our results ,",
    "the babar @xmath17@xcite can be explained by the same mixing scheme with a mixing angle of @xmath25 .",
    "@xmath18@xcite and @xmath19@xcite are more likely to be @xmath7 predominant states , since their masses are consistent with the @xmath7 predictions , while our calculated total widths are both comparable with the experimental measurements under the @xmath7 or @xmath8 assignments . our results also show that , the measured width of @xmath20 is much smaller than the theoretical calculations under the @xmath8 assignment",
