    "network coding has emerged as an attractive alternative to routing because of the throughput improvement it provides by reducing the number of channel uses . in a wireless scenario",
    ", further throughput improvement can be achieved through physical layer network coding , a technique in which nodes are allowed to transmit simultaneously , instead of transmitting in orthogonal slots .",
    "information theoretic and communication theoretic benefits of physical layer network coding have been studied widely in the literature @xcite .",
    "the concept of physical layer network coding was first introduced in @xcite , in which it was observed that allowing the two users in a two - way relay channel to transmit simultaneously results in throughput improvement , without a degradation in the error performance . the compute and forward framework was introduced in @xcite ,",
    "in which it was shown that allowing the intermediate relay nodes to decode a linear combination of the messages according to the channel coefficients results in significantly higher achievable rates . a multi - level coding scheme based on the compute and forward framework",
    "was proposed in @xcite .",
    "the constellation constrained achievable rate regions for the wireless two - way relay channel with a layered hierarchical code design were obtained in @xcite . in @xcite , it was shown that for uncoded communication , changing the network coding map adaptively according to the channel condition results in significant increase in throughput . in @xcite",
    ", such adaptive network coding maps were obtained using latin squares .",
    "symbol error rate performance analysis of the physical layer network coding scheme in which network coding maps are changed adaptively according to the channel condition was presented in @xcite .",
    "obtaining latin square based network coding maps for the mimo two - way relaying scenario was considered in @xcite .",
    "physical layer network coding using latin squares for two - way relaying with qam signal set was considered in @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the design of physical layer network coding maps for the wireless two - way relay channel shown in fig .",

    "the end nodes a and b exchange messages with the help of the relay node r. we consider the framework introduced in @xcite , in which the network coding map used at r is chosen based on the channel realization .",
    "all the nodes are assumed to be be half - duplex .",
    "communication takes place in two phases : ( i ) multiple access ( ma ) phase during which a and b transmit simultaneously to r and ( ii ) broadcast ( bc ) phase during which r transmits the estimate of a many - to - one function of a s and b s transmission . to ensure decodability of b s ( a s ) message at node a ( b ) , the many - to - one function used at r should satisfy a condition called exclusive law @xcite and all maps satisfying exclusive law form latin squares@xcite .    due to the simultaneous transmission of nodes a and b during the ma phase ,",
    "distance shortening occurs in the effective constellation at r , when the ratio of the channel fade coefficients of the b - r and a - r links called the fade state , falls in the neighbourhood of a set of complex numbers called the singular fade states@xcite .",
    "the problem of finding network coding maps which remove the harmful effects of these singular fade states , henceforth referred as the removal of singular fade states , reduces to finding latin squares which satisfy certain constraints called the singularity removal constraints@xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "such latin squares were obtained by completing partially filled latin squares , obtained after combining singularity removal constraints ( more details on this are provided in section iii - b ) .",
    "also , it was conjectured in @xcite , that for any @xmath1-psk signal set , the singular fade states can be removed by latin squares which are filled in with the minimum number of symbols @xmath4 note that the number of symbols used in the latin square is equal to the size of the signal set used during the bc phase and hence needs to be kept as much minimum as possible @xcite .",
    "this paper focusses on obtaining latin squares which remove singular fade states using graph vertex coloring .",
    "the approach in @xcite which involves the completion of partially filled latin squares can be viewed as a special case .",
    "the preliminary notations related to graph theory and the signal model are presented in section ii - a and section ii - b respectively .",
    "the contributions and organization of the rest of the paper are as follows :    * the notion of singularity removal graph is introduced , which is a compact representation of the singularity removal constraints as well as the constraints imposed by the exclusive law . it is shown that every latin square which removes a singular fade state can be obtained by a proper vertex coloring ( for definition , see section ii a ) of the corresponding singularity removal graph ( section iii - a ) .",
    "* the two stage approach adopted in @xcite which involves completion of partially filled latin squares obtained by combining singularity removal constraints can be viewed as special way of coloring the singularity removal graph .",
    "the two stage approach can be viewed equivalently as first coloring a subgraph of the singularity removal graph , referred to as the vital subgraph , before coloring the rest of the singularity removal graph .",
    "the drawback of this two stage approach in relation to the one stage approach of coloring the entire singularity removal graph is that the two stage approach may not always result in a latin square with the minimum number of symbols ( section iii - b ) . *",
    "the minimum number of symbols in a latin square which removes a singular fade state is equal to the chromatic number ( for definition , see section ii a ) of the corresponding singularity removal graph .",
    "if for a singular fade state , the chromatic number of the singularity removal graph exceeds the size of the signal set @xmath0 used at the end nodes , then it means that there does not exist a latin square with the minimum number of symbols @xmath0 which removes that singular fade state .",
    "it is shown that for any square qam signal set , there exists singular fade states for which the singularity removal graphs have chromatic numbers more than @xmath0 ( section iv ) . * the conjecture in @xcite that for any @xmath1-psk signal set , all the singular fade states can be removed using latin squares which contain only @xmath1 symbols is proved . in other words , it is shown that for any @xmath1-psk signal set , all the singularity removal graphs can be colored using only @xmath1 colors ( section v ) .",
