    "migration of a bio - membrane in a narrow capillary is an important phenomenon for the understanding of the biological activities .",
    "for example , as was reported by skalak _",
    "et al._@xcite , red blood cells circulating in blood vessels show a large variety of shapes , such as a symmetric parachute and an asymmetric slipper shapes .",
    "especially , in the asymmetric shape , the vesicle shows tank - treading motion , where amphiphilic molecules rotate on the vesicle surface keeping the whole vesicle shape stationary .",
    "recently , to elucidate the physical origin of the behaviors of red blood cells in a capillary , several simulation methods have been developed . using surface element method ,",
    "noguchi and gompper simulated the shape transition of a vesicle between an oblate shape and a prolate shape@xcite .",
    "_ showed with use of the boundary integral method that the shape transition of a vesicle between the parachute and the slipper shapes is triggered by a decrease in the velocity difference between the vesicle center and the unperturbed external poiseuille flow@xcite . in these methods",
    ", the red blood cell is modeled as a closed surface which is discretized using a chain of bonds with fixed length ( 2 dimensional case in ref.[3 ] ) or using a triangular mesh ( 3 dimensional case in ref.[2 ] ) .",
    "contrary to these studies , in the present work , we use field theories for both of the vesicle shapes and the flow field@xcite . by using the field theoretic description",
    ", we can easily evaluate the free energy and the dissipation functional of the system , which enables us to determine the equilibrium or steady states of the system quantitatively . in the case of static simulations , the equilibrium shape of the vesicle",
    "is obtained by comparing the values of the total free energy of the vesicles among several candidates@xcite . similarly to this free energy analysis in the static simulations , in the case of our dynamical simulations , stable steady states of the vesicle and the flow field are determined by comparing onsager s dissipation functional instead of the free energy of the system@xcite .",
    "although there are some candidates for the field theory for vesicles , such as self - consistent field theory@xcite and ota - kawasaki theory@xcite , we choose the phase field theory(pft ) for describing the vesicle dynamics@xcite .",
    "contrary to the other field theories , by using pft , the interface between inside and outside regions of the vesicle can be described stably , and we can easily trace the moving interface driven by an external flow field . in this study , we extended the pft to realize the vesicle dynamics governed by equation of motion based on the onsager s variational principle .",
    "especially , we applied this theory to the dynamics of a vesicle in a 2-dimensional poiseuille flow in order to understand the origin of transitions of migration behaviors of the vesicle by analyzing the onsager s dissipation functional .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .    in section 2",
    ", we show the detail of our field theory based on onsager s principle . in section 3",
    ", we show our simulation method for the shape deformations of a vesicle in a 2-dimensional poiseuille flow . in section 4",
    ", we will show our simulation results .",
    "finally , in section 5 , we conclude this study .",
    "onsager s principle is a fundamental framework that describes the complex non - equilibrium behaviors of soft - materials , such as liquid crystals , gels , polymers and colloids@xcite .",
    "based on the onsager s principle , the dynamical equations for the vesicle and the flow field can be derived . in this study",
    ", we consider a two component system composed of amphiphilic molecules that form the vesicle and a surrounding solvent . for simplicity ,",
    "we assume that the mass density of the amphiphilic molecules and the solvent are the same .",
    "first , we define the flow velocity field @xmath0 as @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the coarse - grained velocity field of the amphiphilic molecules that form the membrane of the vesicle , @xmath3 is the velocity of the solvent , and @xmath4 is the volume fraction of the amphiphilic molecules , where we assumed an incompressibility condition on the total density of the membrane and the solvent . among the three velocity fields @xmath5 and @xmath3 , we choose @xmath6 and @xmath2 as independent variables . hereafter ,",
    "unless explicitly stated , we will suppress the argument of time @xmath7 for simplicity .",
    "as @xmath4 is a conserved variable , the following equation of continuity for @xmath4 should be satisfied : @xmath8 to obtain the equations of motion for @xmath6 , @xmath2 and @xmath4 , we introduce the onsager s dissipation functional @xmath9 defined by @xmath10 the first term on the right - hand side of eq.([onsager ] ) is the time derivative of the total free energy of the system @xmath11 , and the second term defines the lagrangian multiplier @xmath12 for the incompressibility condition ( @xmath13 ) , where @xmath12 corresponds to the local static pressure .",
    "the total free energy @xmath11 , and the third and the fourth terms on the right - hand side of eq.([onsager ] ) are defined as @xmath14^{2 } d{\\bf r } , \\\\",

    "@xmath26 is the dissipation functional of the flow field and @xmath27 is the contribution from the friction between the vesicle and the flow field . here",
    ", we note that , in the limit of @xmath28 , @xmath27 imposes the no - slip boundary condition on the solvent at the vesicle surface , while @xmath27 still has non - zero contribution .    due to the requirement of the non - equilibrium thermodynamics ,",
    "the time developments of the vesicle shape and the flow field are given by minimizing the onsager s dissipation functional @xmath9 , which leads to two conditions @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",

    "the third term on the left - hand side of eq.([stokes ] ) corresponds to the stress due to the bending energy of the vesicle . by combining eqs.([cont ] ) and",
    "( [ vm ] ) , we obtain the time evolution equation for the vesicle shape as @xmath32 where the first term on the right - hand side of eq.([time_phi ] ) represents the fick s law of linear diffusion of the amphiphilic molecules , and the second term is the contribution from the advection due to the external flow field .",
    "in order to simulate the vesicle behaviors based on eq.([time_phi ] ) , we use phase field theory(pft)@xcite . in the pft ,",
    "the vesicle surface is represented by a scalar order parameter field @xmath33 , which is called `` phase field '' , where @xmath34 is a position vector . inside and outside regions of the vesicle",
    "are specified by positive and negative values of @xmath35 , respectively .",
    "therefore the vesicle surface is defined by @xmath36 .",
    "as such an interface is a topological defect of the field @xmath35 , the interface is stable and non - vanishing even if vesicle is migrated and deformed by the flow , which is an advantage of the pft when simulating the flow behavior of the vesicle .    in the following , we rewrite eq.([time_phi ] ) , _ i.e. _ equation of motion for the density field of the amphiphilic molecules , into a form of a time evolution equation for the phase field @xmath35 . using the ginzburg - landau model for binary mixtures , we define the distribution of the amphiphilic molecules of the vesicle as@xcite @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the interface thickness .",
    "it is easy to check that @xmath39 defined by eq.([phi_2 ] ) takes non - zero value only on the membrane surface .",
    "as is well - known in the differential geometry@xcite , the mean curvature of the vesicle surface is obtained by a variation of the total surface area @xmath40 , which is proportional to the total component of the amphiphilic molecules @xmath41 with respect to an infinitesimal displacement of the vesicle surface in its perpendicular direction .",
    "therefore , we obtain the following formula@xcite @xmath42 where @xmath43 is a mean curvature multiplied by a constant that takes account of the dimensionality . using eq.([mean ] ) , the helfrich s bending energy for vesicle shapes are obtained by @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the bending modulus of the vesicle .",

    "our model system is characterized by several non - dimensional parameters . in our 2-dimensional model , @xmath19 and @xmath18 in eq.([total_f ] ) represent the total enclosed area and the perimeter length of the vesicle , respectively .",
    "we define the vesicle size @xmath71 as the radius of a perfect circle that has the same perimeter length @xmath18 of the vesicle .",
    "with use of the maximum velocity of the unperturbed poiseuille flow @xmath72(_i.e .",

    "the reynolds number and the capillary number usually satisfy @xmath80 and @xmath81 , respectively .",
    "we performed 2-dimensional simulations using eqs.([stokes ] ) and ( [ psi_time_3 ] ) . in eq.([stokes ] ) , for the stability of the numerical scheme , we relaxed the stokes approximation by introducing the inertia term that was neglected in eq.([stokes ] ) .",
    "we confirmed that this addition does not have any appreciable contributions to the dynamics of the whole system except for rapid oscillations of the quantities around their average value .",

    "it is convenient to introduce two alternating non - dimensional control parameters for the numerical scheme instead of the physical parameters @xmath82 and @xmath83 defined above . in order to define these control parameters , we rewrite our original equations ,",

    ", width=302 ]    to quantitatively explain the transitions among different steady states of the vesicle shown in the previous subsection , we focus on the dissipation functional defined by eqs.([onsager])-([w_slip ] ) ( for simplicity , we call this just `` dissipation '' ) . in the steady states , contribution from the time derivative of the total free energy @xmath119 is vanishing .",
    "( in the case of the snaking motions , time average of @xmath119 is zero instead of the instantaneous value of @xmath119 . )",
    "moreover , we found that the second terms on the right - hand side of eq.([onsager ] ) is negligible due to the incompressibility conditions of the flow field .",
    "figure [ ed ] shows the dependences of the components of the dissipation on @xmath99 , where the value of @xmath99 is a measure of the importance of the bending elasticity of the vesicle compared with that of the fluid .",
    "figure [ ed](a ) shows the contributions from the fluid flows in the outside and inside regions of the vesicle .",
    "these values represent the deviations in the dissipation from that in the unperturbed poiseuille flow . when the value of @xmath99 is increased , bullet , snaking and slipper shapes appear in this order . at each transition point between different shapes ,",
    "we observe a kink in the curve , which indicates an occurrence of a transition from one stable branch to another .",
    "this is analogous to the 1st order phase transition .    in the bullet region ( @xmath120 )",
    ", the dissipation of the outside fluid is increasing as @xmath99 is increased while the change in the dissipation of the inside fluid is less pronounced .",
    "the extra dissipation of the outside fluid from the unperturbed poiseuille flow is due to the disturbance near the surface of the vesicle , which plays the role of an essentially stick boundary for the fluid .",
    "when @xmath99 is small ( a flexible vesicle ) , the vesicle shape is deformed by the fluid flow so that the dissipation of the flow is minimized .",
    "such an adjustment of the vesicle shape becomes less effective when @xmath99 becomes large because of the increasing stiffness of the vesicle .",
    "this leads to an increase in the dissipation of the outside fluid .",
    "on the other hand , the inside fluid is static in the frame of the enclosing vesicle because the bullet shape does not change its shape with no flow on the membrane just like a rigid container for the inside fluid . in fig.[ed](b)(ii ) , the sum of the contributions from the inside and the outside fluids is shown .",
    "according to the above discussion on fig.[ed](a ) , the slight increase of this sum in the bullet region is coming from the outside fluid . on the other hand , fig.[ed](b)(iii )",
    "shows the dissipation due to the friction between the membrane and the fluid(both inside and outside of the vesicle ) along the vesicle surface .",
    "one can observe that the increase of @xmath99 induces an increase of the dissipation due to the friction at the vesicle surface , which is much larger than the increase in the viscous dissipation of the bulk fluid .",
    "thus , the main contribution to the dissipation of the whole system in the bullet region is the viscous dissipation of the outside fluid at the vesicle surface(hereafter we call this `` surface friction '' ) .    in the snaking region(@xmath121 ) , the slope of the curve for the outside fluid ( left - side figure of fig.[ed](a ) ) is smaller than that in the bullet region .",
    "this behavior means that the perturbation to the outside fluid imposed by the vesicle is more relaxed for the snaking motion than the bullet shape . as there is a tank - treading motion of the membrane for the snaking motion as well as the change in its whole shape , it is easier for the snaking vesicle to adjust itself to the outside fluid than the bullet shape so that the friction of the outside fluid is reduced .",
    "this adjustment is realized at the sacrifice of the increase in the dissipation of the inside fluid , which is almost the same amount as that of the outside fluid .",
    "the sum of these two contributions gives the increase in fig.[ed](b)(ii ) in the snaking region , which has a slightly larger slope than that in the bullet region .",
    "this increase is compensated by the reduction in the slope of the dissipation due to the surface friction ( fig.[ed](b)(iii ) ) induced by the tank - treading motion of the vesicle surface . as a result",
    ", the total dissipation @xmath122 has a smaller slope than that in the bullet region .",
    "the difference in the slopes of the total dissipation between bullet and snaking regions leads to a transition from the bullet branch to the snaking branch at around @xmath123 .    for the slipper region(@xmath124 ) , the effect of the tank - treading motion is much more pronounced , which is indicated by the abrupt decrease in the dissipation due to the surface friction ( fig.[ed](b)(iii ) ) .",
    "such a decrease in the dissipation due to the surface friction overcomes the increase in the dissipation due to the fluid(fig.[ed](b)(ii ) ) , and the total dissipation @xmath125 has a smaller slope than that in the snaking region .",

    "the horizontal and the vertical axes represent @xmath72 and @xmath74 , respectively . when the reduced volume @xmath74 becomes larger , the vesicle changes its shape from an asymmetric shape(slipper ) to a symmetric shape(bullet ) .",
    "although this symmetric - asymmetric transition is qualitatively similar to that reported in preceding researches@xcite , there is a certain difference between our results and the results reported by kaoui _ et al._@xcite . in order to explain this difference ,",
    "let us focus on the steady shapes of the vesicle in the case @xmath128 , for which we obtain only slipper shapes as is shown in fig.[phase_diagram_1 ] . in this case",
    ", the capillary number @xmath76 and the measure of the confinement of the vesicle inside the capillary @xmath129 take the values @xmath130 and @xmath131 , respectively .",
    "for the same conditions , however , kaoui _ et al .",
    "_ showed that the slipper shape and the parachute shape are the steady shapes instead of the slipper shape we obtained@xcite .",
    "the reason for this difference between our result and their result is the dissipation due to the friction at the membrane surface @xmath27 which is included only in our model . by combining eqs.([w_slip ] ) and ( [ vm ] ) , we obtain the relation @xmath132 where @xmath133 corresponds to the diffusion flux divided by the mobility @xmath61 of the amphiphilic molecules on the vesicle surface that tend to reduce the total free energy of the vesicle @xmath134 .",
    "the occurrence of such a diffusion motion of the amphiphilic molecules on the vesicle surface is the reason why the vesicle with a large deformation is not preferable with respect to @xmath27 . generally speaking",
    ", the slipper - shaped vesicle shows a smaller deformation than the parachute - shaped vesicle , because the amphiphilic molecules on the slipper - shaped vesicle undergo a tank - treading motion , which prevents large deformation of the vesicle due to the shear force of the external flow . as a result",
    ", the slipper shape is selected as the stable state .",
    "the zig - zag motion of the vesicle with @xmath108 , @xmath135 and @xmath127.,width=302 ]    in fig.[phase_diagram_1 ] , we found two types of ( damping ) oscillations of the vesicle motions , _ i. e. _ snaking and zig - zag motions , which can be observed in the region between the stable regions of the slipper and bullet shapes . the zig - zag motion is a damping oscillation in which the vesicle takes the parachute and the slipper shapes alternatively as is shown in fig.[zigzag ]",
    "the vesicle moves toward the wall of the capillary with the slipper shape and then turns .",
    "the parachute shape appears at this turning point .",
    "after such a turning , the vesicle moves toward the other wall again with the slipper shape .",
    "it is difficult to obtain the final stationary shape of the vesicle in this case because the period of the damping oscillation is very long .",
    "therefore , we can not identify which shape is chosen as the stationary shape in the region of zig - zag oscillations in fig.[phase_diagram_1 ] .",
    "so far , we have shown two types of oscillations , _",
    "i. e. _ the snaking motion and the zig - zag motion .",
    "in addition to these long - lived oscillations , we have also found a damping vacillating - breathing oscillation@xcite in the region @xmath136 .",
    "these oscillations have been reported in preceding works , where the vesicle is modeled with discretized meshes in 2-dimensions@xcite and 3-dimensions@xcite . in these works ,",
    "the vesicle deformations are induced by two different forces , _",
    "i.e. _ the force due to the flow field and that due to the bending elasticity of the vesicle , both of which are also taken into account in our simulations in the diffusion of the amphiphilic molecules . on the other hand , kaoui _ et al . _ proposed another model where the vesicle deforms due to the flow field without any friction.@xcite in this case , they reported only snaking oscillations and they did not observe the zig - zag and the vacillating - breathing oscillations .",
    "this result means that the various temporal oscillations are more pronounced by the contribution due to the friction at the membrane surface @xmath27 to the dissipation . because , in the model that includes both forces due to the flow field and the bending elasticity , the dissipation of flow field @xmath26 can compete not only with @xmath119 but also with @xmath27 , and this competition is essential for the oscillation behaviors of the vesicle",
    "in this article , by using a combination of the pft and navier - stokes equation , we derived , up to the first order in the local mean curvature of the vesicle , a set of dynamical equations which are equivalent to those obtained using the onsager s principle . using this model , we performed dynamical simulations of the vesicle in a 2-dimensional poiseuille flow which is a model of a red blood cell in a blood vessel .",
    "we simulated this model and found several types of behaviors of the vesicle , such as slipper shape , bullet shape , snaking motion , zig - zag motion and vacillating - breathing motion .",
    "an analysis based on the onsaer s dissipation functional revealed that the origin of these behaviors is the friction between the vesicle surface and the flow field of the solvent .",
    "moreover , we should note the main differences between 2 and 3 dimensional systems discussed in ref.@xcite , _",
    "i.e. _ ( i ) the absence of the slipper shape in 3-dimensional case and ( ii ) the absence of the tumbling behavior in the 2-dimensional case with a small viscosity contrast between outer and inner regions of the vesicle .",
    "our results do not contradict with these findings , and can give a reason for the stability of each of the stable behaviors .",

    "in this appendix , we derive eq.([noncons ] ) , _ i.e. _ the solution of eq.([psi_time_1 ] ) , that is correct up to the 1st order in @xmath43 . substituting eq.([time_phi ] ) into the left - hand side of eq.([psi_time_1 ] ) , we obtain the following relation : @xmath137 in order to mimic the essence of the derivation , we consider the case without advection ( i.e. @xmath138 ) .",
