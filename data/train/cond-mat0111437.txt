    "the jain hierarchical states @xcite are an interesting class of plateaus in the fractional quantum hall effect @xcite that still requires further theoretical and experimental investigation .",
    "a characteristic new feature with respect to the laughlin s plateaus , is the presence of edge excitations with neutral propagating modes that can not be directly measured in the conduction experiments . in this paper , we elaborate the proposal of ref.@xcite of testing these neutral excitations by means of their thermal current .",
    "we first use the conformal field theory ( cft ) description of the edge states to obtain a general relation between the thermal conductance and the gravitational anomaly @xcite of the chiral conformal theory .",
    "we start by recalling the well - known cft result expressing the specific heat in terms of the conformal anomaly @xmath1 @xcite : c_v= =  c  , t 0  .",
    "[ gen - cv ] the proof of this formula goes as follows : the thermal field theory is defined on the cylinder geometry made by the periodic euclidean time and the unbounded space ; in this geometry , the casimir effect implies a non - vanishing ground - state energy @xmath2 , that is given by the expectation value of the stress tensor and is proportional to the conformal anomaly @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the edge excitations of the quantum hall effect are described by more general cfts with unbalanced chiral and anti - chiral modes that propagate in opposite directions and are characterized by different central charges @xmath1 and @xmath3 , respectively . in these chiral theories , the expectation values of the energy @xmath2 and the momentum @xmath4 are tied together , such that the casimir effect is associated to a thermal current @xmath5 .",
    "the corresponding thermal hall conductance @xmath6 can be found in full generality by adapting the derivation of ( [ gen - cv ] ) ( see section 2 ) ; it reads : k=  ( c - |c )  .",
    "[ gen - k ] in this equation , the difference of central charges parametrizes the two - dimensional ( pure ) gravitational anomaly @xcite of the chiral conformal theory describing the single edge ( e.g. @xmath7 for the edges of the laughlin plateaus ) .",

    "the formula ( [ gen - k ] ) for the thermal conductance allows for the direct determination of the central charges of the edge states ; clearly , the measurement of @xmath6 requires a high - precision experiment that has not yet been realized , to our knowledge @xcite ; nevertheless , it should be feasible in principle @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the specific heat of edge states ( proportional to @xmath8 , in general ) can not be measured because it is masked by the overwhelming contribution of the lattice phonons @xcite .    in a finite sample , of typical linear extension @xmath9",
    ", there are finite - size corrections to the leading ( @xmath10 ) results ( [ gen - k ] ) and ( [ gen - cv ] ) .",
    "the exact thermal averages are then obtained by differentiation of the partition function ; the latter can be best computed on the geometry of the annulus , that involves an inner and an outer edge .",
    "actually , the annulus partition functions enjoy the property of invariance ( or , more generally , of covariance ) under modular transformations of the periodic time and angular coordinates @xcite .",
    "once the expression of the partition function is known , one can determine the finite - size corrections to ( [ gen - k ] ) : in particular the first , universal , term @xmath11 is of some interest as described hereafter .",
    "the edge excitations of the hierarchical hall states have been mainly described by two classes of conformal field theories : the abelian theories @xcite , and the @xmath12 minimal models @xcite .",
    "both theories are suitable generalizations of the simple scalar field theory that describes laughlin s plateaus ( chiral luttinger liquid ) @xcite .",
    "the first class considers several copies of the scalar theory , whereas the second class exploits the physical picture of the droplet of incompressible fluid @xcite , that is characterized by the @xmath12 symmetry @xcite@xcite .",
    "remarkably , these two classes of theories possess the same spectra of charged excitations , but differ in the neutral sector .",
    "therefore , the thermal conductances are expected to be different in the two theories and could provide a significant experimental test . actually , the conductances are equal to leading order ( [ gen - k ] ) , because the two theories share the same central charges . from the known expressions of their partition functions",
    "@xcite , we nevertheless obtain different first - order @xmath11 corrections : they are vanishing in the abelian theories , and non - vanishing in the @xmath12 minimal models .",
    "the derivation makes it apparent that power - law @xmath13 corrections are absent for all rational cft , namely the class of cfts with modular invariant partition functions .",

    ", we describe the thermal transport in cft and derive the general formula ( [ gen - k ] ) ; we then digress on the relation between the anomalies , chiral and gravitational , and the corresponding out - of - equilibrium processes of the hall and thermal currents , respectively .",
    "these are nice examples for the general picture of non - equilibrium dynamics envisaged in ref.@xcite . in section 3",
    ", we introduce the annulus partition function and obtain the finite - size corrections to ( [ gen - k ] ) , using the well - known @xmath14 cft of the laughlin plateaus as an example ; we then extend the finite - size analysis to the multi - component abelian cft of the hierarchical states . in section 4",
    ", we analyze the @xmath12 minimal model and find the @xmath11 correction stemming from the lack of modular invariance of its partition function . in the conclusions , we estimate the experimental precision that is necessary for measuring these finite - size differences .",
    "we start by recalling the results of ref.@xcite for the thermal transport of the edge excitations that are described by @xmath15 independent @xmath16-dimensional scalar fields .",

    "[ j - def2 ] the ( steady ) thermal current is defined as the ground - state value of the _ momentum density _ in the thermal field theory : j_q _ t = - _ t  ; [ j - def ] thus , it is proportional to the difference of the two chiral components of the stress tensor and is non - vanishing for chiral conformal theories .    in the quantum hall effect , this analysis applies to the single edge , that is typically described by a chiral cft ( e.g. @xmath38 for the laughlin states ) ; nevertheless , any hall device , like the bar or the annulus ( fig.[fig1 ] ) , always involves two edges with conjugate chiralities ; therefore , the total thermal current vanishes in thermal equilibrium .",
    "let us focus on the annulus geometry , characterized by the space - independent currents @xmath39 and @xmath40 , with indices numbering the edges , that satisfy @xmath41 .",
    "the non - equilibrium current can be described as follows : we homogeneously heat up one of the edges , say the inner one ( 1 ) , and find , within the linear response : j_q = j_q^(1)(t+t)+j_q^(2)(t ) ~  t  .",
    "[ j - der ] therefore , the thermal hall conductance is defined by : k= - ^(1)_t  , [ k - der ] and it involves the stress - tensor components of the single - edge cft .",
    "this formula is consistent with the earlier definition ( [ kdef ] ) , but it is also an exact result that can be used for computing the finite - size corrections . in the annulus geometry ,",
    "the thermal current is longitudinal , i.e. orthogonal to the temperature gradient , due to the presence of the external magnetic field ( this thermal analog of the hall conduction is called the leduc - righi effect in magneto - hydrodynamics @xcite ) .",
    "we now proceed to compute the thermal conductance ( [ k - der ] ) to the leading @xmath42 ) order ; disregarding the space periodicity , the thermal field theory is defined on the cylinder made by the unbounded space and the periodic euclidean time , with period @xmath43 .",

    "the reason for this fact can again be traced back to the hamiltonian ( [ hamin ] ) : the @xmath138-perturbation is actually made by the non - local operator @xmath158 , thus the general arguments for modular invariance in local field theory do not apply . note that the partition function ( [ zed2w ] ) is uniquely determined by the hamiltonian definition of the minimal models just outlined @xcite .",
    "we now proceed to compute the thermal conductance in the @xmath113 @xmath12 minimal models : using the definitions ( [ eme ] ) , we evaluate the average energies @xmath159 and @xmath160 following the same steps as in the abelian case .",
    "the @xmath102 modular transformation is still useful for expanding the non - covariant neutral characters @xmath157 in ( [ minchar ] ) : we need the transformation of the dedekind function , ( ) = ( -i)^-1/2  ( -1/ )  .",
    "[ s - dede ] the result is ( including the general case @xmath134 ) : k_minimal =    ( m-1 )  ,  =  .",
    "[ jqmin ] this conductance contains an additional term w.r.t . the abelian result ( [ jqabe ] ) , namely the first finite - size correction @xmath161 .",
    "one can check that it originates from the prefactor @xmath162 in the modular transformation of @xmath163 ( [ s - dede ] ) .    in summary",
    ", we have found that the thermal conductance in the @xmath12 minimal models ( [ jqmin ] ) displays a finite - size correction to the general result ( [ gen - k ] ) that is absent for all rational cfts including the abelian theories of the hierarchical states .",
    "such correction is a consequence of the lack of modular invariance in the minimal partition functions , but can also be obtained by straightforward expansion in @xmath164 , as described for the @xmath14 theory in eq.([epsc1 ] ) ; the latter derivation would make apparent that the correction arises from the different state counting in the minimal models , which is due to the projection of infinite states out of the abelian theory .",
    "it is also clear that this finite - size correction in @xmath165 is universal and independent of the shape of the sample .",
    "in this paper , we have found a general expression for the thermal hall conductance in terms of the gravitational anomaly of the chiral cft describing each edge .",
    "we have also obtained the finite - size expansion for the thermal conductance and computed the first universal , shape - independent correction .",
    "this was found to be different for two candidate conformal theories of the hierarchical hall states : the multi - component abelian theory has a vanishing correction , as any rational cft , while the @xmath12 minimal model has it non - vanishing .    the relative size of this correction w.r.t . the leading term @xmath166 is equal to @xmath167 , with @xmath168 .",
    "we estimate : @xmath169 and @xmath170 for hall samples of size @xmath171 and temperature @xmath172 , with @xmath173 , assuming comparable fermi velocities for neutral and charged modes @xcite .",
    "although it is a small effect , it may be measurable in future experiments of the type proposed in @xcite , in the favorable cases , like @xmath31 , where the leading term in the thermal conductance is predicted to vanish .",
    "such a difference could support either theoretical proposal for the hierarchical states .",
    "let us add that the cft prediction for the thermal conductivity presented here is independent of the impurity interactions , as discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "note also that further differences between the two cfts for the hierarchical theories involve the quantum statistics and require the measurement of four - point functions .",
