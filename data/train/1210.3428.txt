    "calculating the rate of type ia supernovae ( sne  ia ) and its dependence on redshift illuminates an important contributor to the metal enrichment history of the universe , the production rate of a specific cross section of stellar systems , and , when linked to star formation history , it can reveal the nature and relative fractions of the progenitor systems .",
    "theory and recent empirical evidence argues that the explosions are derived from degenerate , hydrogen depleted stars , namely white dwarfs @xcite .",
    "the nature of the companion star which must be present to feed mass onto these otherwise stable constructions , however , is more controversial",
    ".    it could very well be that there are two or more pathways leading to what we observe as sne  ia  including events from single degenerate progenitors ( e.g. a white dwarf accreting from a red giant star ; @xcite ) and double degenerate progenitors ( i.e. two white dwarfs ; @xcite ) .",
    "this is a potential obstacle for the further use of sne  ia  as cosmological probes if the local population used to calibrate the peak magnitude to light curve width relation differs systematically from the distant , cosmologically significant population ( i.e. if high redshift events obey a different relation , cosmology studies may be biased ; * ? ? ?",

    "the results are consistent with a power - law distribution that favors short delays ( for a review , see @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , sne  ia  appear to occur more frequently in late type galaxies with active star formation than in ellipticals ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "recently , the lick observatory supernova search ( loss ) reported that the rate of sne  ia  per unit luminosity of the hosts is higher for low luminosity galaxies than luminous ones @xcite .",
    "this so - called `` rate - size '' relation may be connected to a metallicity effect @xcite , since lower luminosity hosts tend to have lower global metallicities @xcite .",
    "white dwarfs that form in low metallicity environments may have a mass distribution that is biased to more massive objects as compared to solar metallicity populations @xcite , and this in turn may lead to a greater supply of sne  ia  progenitors .",
    "measurement of the sne  ia  rate was originally performed through searches targeting specific galaxies , and thus the rates derived were in units of the number of sne  ia  found per time per galaxy @xcite .",
    "this evolved into a rate per galaxy luminosity  snub or snuk , which give the number of sne  ia  per @xmath3 ( in the b or k - bands , respectively ) , per century .",
    "@xcite combined targeted photographic and visual surveys and found a sne  ia  rate of snub@xmath4 averaged over all galaxy types .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , have been widely adopted as the availability of wide field cameras has increased ( e.g. snls , essence , sdss - ii , ptf , panstarrs , skymapper ) .",

    "included in this survey category is the sdss - ii , which was designed to bridge the gap between the local sne  ia  and the high redshift events used as cosmological probes @xcite . over a three year period , the sdss - ii spectroscopically confirmed several hundred sne  ia  in the range @xmath7 .",
    "@xcite use a sub sample of ( normal ) sne  ia  discoveries to derive the @xmath8 rate , which is seen to increase roughly as a power - law with redshift , @xmath9 .",
    "sne  ia  rate studies have been conducted at even higher redshifts , including work done with the supernova legacy survey ( snls ; @xcite ) , _ hst _",

    "for the later , we determine an empirical pamd based on a volume limited sub - sample of the sdss - ii after discussing the pamd model that was actually used in the sdss - ii sne  ia  rate calculation ( and which we adopt for comparison to the sdss - ii ) . in  [ de ] we study our ability to detect point sources of various brightness as a function of seeing and limiting magnitudes , and we use this in  [ survey_eff ] to determine our overall survey efficiency  the probability of discovering sne  ia  drawn from a given population  as a function of distance .",

    "details of the full rotse - iiib supernova sample will be presented in a forthcoming paper . here",
    "we summarize the key characteristics of the sample selection process .",
    "the tss began survey operations in november of 2004 and was succeeded by rsvp in early 2008 .",
    "our survey instrument , rotse - iiib , has a 0.45 m aperture and a @xmath19 degree field of view .",
    "the search continues to operate and has been expanded to the other rotse - iii telescopes in australia , namibia , and turkey , but for this work we consider only discoveries made by rotse - iiib in texas prior to february 2009 .",
    "we typically targeted galaxy clusters such as virgo , ursa major , coma , and abell clusters for our supernova search , but in a few exceptional cases we chose to target specific galaxies ( e.g. m31 ) . in the present work",
    ", we remove this potential source of bias by selecting only the subset of sne  ia  found in the background of each field ( @xmath20kms@xmath6 , where @xmath21 is the redshift of the object targeted in a given field ) . during the search period , we detected 76 supernovae in total , and of these 46 were classified as sne  ia .",
    "after removing foreground and cluster supernovae , we are left with the 23 sne  ia  background events listed in table  [ table : disco ] .",
    "figures [ fig : winter_spring ] and [ fig : summer_fall ] show our sky coverage with the locations of the discoveries marked .",
    "fields with the highest concentrations of nearby galaxies were typically observed every night as weather and season allowed . over the first few years we observed the less rich fields on alternating nights .",
    "additional time was allocated for the survey in the rsvp era , and fields were added at that time .",
    "but for the summer - fall fields .",
    "]    for both tss and rsvp , we employed image subtraction techniques to reveal time variable events .",
    "the tss employed a modified version of the @xcite search code , and the rsvp used the process described in @xcite . for our survey , we typically observe each field multiple times each night . from these",
    "we create 3 co - added frames representing the average of the first half of the nights data ( new1 ) , the average of the second half ( new2 ) , and the average for the whole night ( new ) .",
    "we use filtering to remove particle events and other artifacts during the co - addition .",
    "we then subtract the properly convolved reference template from each of these to generate subtracted frames ( sub1 , sub2 , and sub ) . to remove contamination from solar system bodies and remaining artifacts , we require a candidate to be detected ( @xmath22 ) at consistent celestial coordinates on each of sub1 and sub2 . the candidate is finally required to be detected at the @xmath23 confidence level on the combined subtraction , sub .",
    "the typical fwhm for the survey was 3.2 pixels ( about 10  ) and the @xmath24 limiting magnitude for the nightly coadds was typically around 18.3 mag .",
    "we further vet potential sn candidates against catalogs of known time - variable phenomena .",
    "most of our fields were observed by the sdss as well , so we were able to remove contamination from un - cataloged variable stars by checking for matching `` host '' stars in the sdss data , which is complete to @xmath25 magnitudes below our survey depth .",

    "all sources judged as possible transients were spectroscopically classified by us or others in the community .",
    "this is a key distinguishing feature of our survey ; other wide - field transient searches generate more candidate supernovae than can be classified with the spectroscopic resources available , so a filtering process such as light curve fitting is typically employed to select only a subset for final spectroscopic confirmation .",
    "table  [ table : disco ] also notes the number of times that each discovery was recovered by the automated search pipeline ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "a final analysis of the data adds low significance ( i.e. @xmath27 ) detections that are not passed by the automated selection cuts , and we determine the peak magnitudes for each supernova in our sample by fitting light curve templates to these final data sets .",
    "we use r - band light curve templates for sne  ia  from loss , which were constructed by interpolating between the faint / fast sn  1999by and the bright / slow sn  1991 t @xcite . see  [ lf ] for a discussion of our unfiltered spectral response and a comparison to the r - band .",
    "we use mpfit.pro in idl to determine the best fitting template shape , and subtract off the galactic extinction in the r - band @xcite .",
    "we employ the distance modulus ( based on independent distance indicators when available through ned or otherwise based on the redshift in a flat , @xmath11kms@xmath6mpc@xmath6 , @xmath12 cosmology ) to determine the peak absolute magnitudes shown in table  [ table : disco ] .",
    "sn  2004gu was first observed near peak , which adds some uncertainty to the date and magnitude of maximum light ; however , spectroscopic phase information is consistent with the derived date of maximum light , and thus we expect the peak magnitude estimate to be accurate .",
    "according to its spectroscopic age , another event , sn2007sp , was first detected about two months after maximum light , so the light curve fit likely underestimates the peak .",
    "although our sample is small , it contains several sne  ia  worth of special note .    *",
    "* sn  2004gu * is a significant outlier on the hubble diagram , and other authors have grouped it with peculiar events like sn  2006gz and sn  1999ac , which may or may not be linked to super - chandrashekar explosions @xcite . * * sn  2006ct * showed the characteristic features of a type  ia supernova , but the blue - shift of the line minima near maximum light was only @xmath28kms@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the spectra show some similarities to the highly peculiar sn  2002es @xcite , which was also hosted by an early type galaxy , but the photometric decline of sn  2006ct @xcite is slower and more reminiscent of sn  2002cx @xcite and sn  2005hk @xcite . * * sn  2007if * is the most luminous type  ia supernova known , and it may be the result of a super - chandrashekar mass explosion @xcite . * * sn  2007qc * was hosted by an extremely low luminosity dwarf galaxy ( see  [ hosts ] ) . at @xmath29 ,",
    "the host is among the faintest detected for any sne  ia . *",
    "* sn  2008ar * showed spectroscopic evidence for high velocity material and unusually strong absorption in the ir triplet @xcite , which is reminiscent of sn  2007le @xcite .",
    "in addition , at least 7 of our sne  ia  ( 2004gu , 2005ck , 2005hj , 2006cj , 2007if , 2008ab , 2008by and possibly 2005bg ) show either unusually high luminosities or are spectroscopically classified as sn  1991t/1999aa - like .",
    "this appears to be a high fraction even for a magnitude limited survey when compared to the loss census of sne  ia  in targeted galaxies @xcite .",
    "our survey is flux limited , and as a result we have a bias against selecting low luminosity sne  ia .",
    "this bias is exacerbated by our removal of discoveries made at or below the redshift of the targeted galaxy clusters . to determine the event rate for the sne  ia  population as a whole",
    ", we must therefore correct the number of events in our observed sample for the fraction we are likely to have missed due to , among other concerns , their lower luminosities ( see  [ survey_eff ] ) .",
    "this requires knowledge of the intrinsic luminosity function for all sne  ia  in our search volume combined with the host galaxy absorption distribution .    in this section ,",
    "we consider the pseudo - absolute magnitude distribution ( pamd ) for sne  ia , which is the distribution one would obtain by correcting the peak observed magnitudes of a complete sample of sne  ia  for distance and galactic extinction but not for host galaxy extinction .",
    "this distribution can directly be used to test the selection efficiency of a flux limited survey ( see  [ survey_eff ] ) .",
    "first , we consider in  [ filtered_v_unfiltered ] how the available sne  ia  luminosity functions derived ( mostly ) through filtered observations may compare to our unfiltered survey data .",
    "we then discuss the pamd compiled by loss from their targeted , but volume limited sample @xcite in  [ losslf ] , and we derive an empirical pamd from a volume limited sub sample of the sdss - ii survey in  [ sdsslf ] . we find that the loss and sdss - ii pamds are not consistent , which is discussed in  [ loss_v_sdss ] .",
    "we calibrate our instrumental magnitudes against the usno - b1.0 r2 system since some of our search fields are outside of the sdss footprint .",
    "for fields covered by both the sdss and usno - b1.0 , we compared the usno - b1.0 photometry to sdss photometry converted to the r - band using @xmath30 , and we find the two systems agree to about 0.01mag on average and have a field to field dispersion of about 0.14mag .",
    "thus our unfiltered rotse - iiib magnitudes should be , on average , similar to the r - band , but objects with spectral energy distributions that differ significantly from the field stars employed in the calibration may be offset from their true r - band values .",
    "we estimate the potential offset between our unfiltered magnitudes and the true r - band system for sne  ia  as follows .",
    "we adopt the spectral energy distribution of a g5v star @xcite as representative of a typical field standard used in calibrating the photometric zeropoint of our unfiltered imaging data .",
    "we scale this template to zero magnitude in the r - band , and then measure the synthetic flux using the approximate transmission function of rotse - iiib @xcite , which is plotted in figure  [ fig : bandpass ] .",
    "we next scale a template spectrum for a branch - normal sn  ia  at maximum light to zero magnitude in the r - band and measure its flux in the rotse - iiib bandpass .",
    "the ratio of this and the scaled field star flux ( also measured in the rotse - iiib bandpass ) gives the expected departure of the rotse - iiib magnitudes from the true r - band system .",
    "we measure this offset in the range @xmath31 by redshifting the sn  ia  template , and find that our unfiltered magnitudes may be 0.05 to 0.10mag brighter than the true r - band system .",
    "we repeat this process for a high luminosity sn  ia  ( sn  1999aa ; @xcite ) , and a low luminosity event",
    "( sn  1991bg ; @xcite ) .",
    "we find that a sn  ia  with the same r - band brightness as a field standard will generate a magnitude in the unfiltered system ( calibrated against the r - band ) that is within @xmath32mag of its true r - band magnitude .        while this shows that our observed magnitudes should be similar to the true r - band system ,",
    "a more pertinent concern is how the derived absolute magnitudes will compare .",
    "in particular , we have calculated absolute magnitudes from our unfiltered data by simply subtracting off the distance moduli and galactic ( r - band ) extinction terms ; we have not included a `` k - correction '' term to account for the changing rest frame bandpass of our unfiltered system over the modest redshift distribution of our sample .",
    "below , we compare the pseudo absolute magnitudes derived from our data to rest frame ( k - corrected ) r - band magnitudes calculated for the same sources based on filtered photometry to check for an offset .",
    "the cfa3 sample includes mlcs2k2 @xcite fits for four of the supernovae in our sample @xcite , including two that were also in the sdss - ii sample @xcite .",
    "we calculate the pseudo - absolute magnitudes from these fits using the @xmath33 parameters and adding back in the host extinction term . for this comparison",
    ", we calibrate the rotse - iiib magnitudes against the sdss field stars ( converted to the r - band as described above ) to remove the usno - b1.0 vs. sdss - ii offset , which we find to be biased in this small overlapping sample .",
    "our pseudo absolute magnitude estimate for sn  2005hj is about 0.1mag brighter than the fits from the cfa3 and the sdss - ii . for sn  2005ir ,",
    "the sdss - ii and cfa3 differ from each other by about 0.1mag , which is comparable to the combined measurement error .",
    "our absolute magnitude for sn  2005ir is about 0.02mag brighter than the sdss - ii value and 0.09mag fainter than the cfa3 value .",
    "our measurements of sn  2006an and sn  2006cj are 0.03mag brighter and 0.16mag fainter than the cfa3 peak magnitudes , respectively .",
    "additionally , the nearby supernova factory has reported a peak v - band magnitude and @xmath34 color for sn  2007if that implies a peak absolute r - band maximum of about @xmath35mag .",
    "calibrating against the sdss r - band ab magnitudes , @xcite found the rotse - iii observations peaked at @xmath36 .",
    "field stars will typically `` brighten '' by about 0.22mag when converting from the sdss r - band system to cousins r - band ( vega ) magnitudes , which shifts the target photometry by the same amount .",
    "our estimate for the peak of sn  2007if is approximately 0.15mag brighter than the nearby supernova factory value .",
    "to , summarize , of the 7 pseudo - absolute magnitude measurements available in the literature based on ( k - corrected ) filtered photometry , our rotse - iiib estimates are @xmath32mag brighter in three cases , @xmath32mag fainter in 2 cases , and roughly the same in the remaining 2 cases .",
    "on average , our values are 0.02mag brighter .",
    "we conclude that there is no significant systematic offset between our unfiltered , pseudo - absolute magnitude estimates and the ( mostly ) r - band system that defines the luminosity functions considered below (  [ losslf ] and [ sdsslf ] ) , and these should agree to about @xmath32mag for individual events .",
    "we address the impact the possible systematic error in our magnitude system with respect to the loss and sdss - ii pseudo - absolute magnitude distributions will have on our rates in  [ conclusions ] .",
    "the lick observatory supernova search ( loss ) has recently published a distribution of pseudo - absolute magnitudes for sne  ia  from their volume limited search @xcite .",
    "like rotse - iiib , the loss survey engine ( the katzman automatic imaging telescope , or kait ) runs with an unfiltered ccd imager , but follow - up observations are often obtained through standard broadband filters . the sne  ia  luminosity function reported by @xcite is primarily constructed from r - band data , which the authors describe as the best match to their unfiltered survey data , and also from unfiltered observations as well . in the lower panel of figure  [ fig : bandpass ]",
    "we show the response curve for the cousins r - band compared to the typical unfiltered response of an apogee7 camera , which is used by loss .",
    "it is important to note that the loss sne  ia  luminosity function was drawn from a sample that was highly biased with respect to the host galaxy properties . in particular ,",
    "the loss targeted mainly high luminosity galaxies .",
    "it has been demonstrated that certain sne  ia  sub - types prefer certain host galaxies @xcite , so the luminosity distribution of the loss sample may be biased with respect to the larger population from which our sample is drawn .",
    "an obvious difference between the loss and rotse - iiib sn  ia  samples is the presence of high luminosity ( @xmath37 ) events in the latter .",
    "although we could follow previous works and simply discard our most luminous sne  ia , we instead chose to calculate an inclusive rate .",
    "we must , therefore , augment the loss luminosity function to account for such events or else our effective survey volume will be under estimated . lacking detailed demographics for this population ,",
    "we simply assume that the population of high luminosity sne  ia  represents only about 1% of sne  ia  in a given volume ; if it were much more these would be detected more frequently , and if it were much less we could not expect to find any in our small sample ( see  [ survey_eff ] ) .",
    "we assume that sn  2007if was a particularly luminous example of this population ( as noted above , it is the most luminous sn  ia  known ) and choose a half gaussian with a peak at @xmath38 and @xmath39mag to stand in for the unknown luminosity distribution .",
    "we will use this augmented version of the loss pamd to calculate the sne  ia  rate in  [ rates ] .",
    "for our rate calculations in  [ rates ] , we will also use the same bimodal - gaussian luminosity function attenuated by a host galaxy absorption distribution that was assumed by @xcite in deriving the sdss - ii rate .",
    "the model is a revised version of the distribution assumed by @xcite that takes into account the findings of @xcite .",
    "the difference makes for only a negligible change in our rate measurment .",
    "the intrinsic sne  ia  luminosity function is defined in terms of the mlcs2k2 light - curve shape / luminosity parameter , @xmath33 .",
    "the distribution of @xmath33 is defined as a gaussian with @xmath40 for @xmath41 and @xmath42 for @xmath43 , and it is truncated to lie within the range ( @xmath44 ) .",

    "in this section we determine the detectability of sources as a function of observed magnitude relative to the limiting magnitude of a given image .",
    "this curve will be used later to determine the probability of detecting simulated sources with various observed magnitudes , which is needed to calculate our overall survey efficiency .    to determine the probability that a source of a given brightness will be detected , we perform a monte carlo simulation .",
    "we add simulated point sources to our co - added images and determine the fractions recovered as a function of magnitude .",
    "this is done relative to the limiting magnitude of the images and coadds recorded in the logs , which is calculated from the 90th percentile magnitude of all objects extracted by sextractor @xcite .",
    "our reference images are typically constructed from dozens of the best individual frames from each field , so they contribute negligibly to the noise on the subtracted frames .",
    "we therefore choose to calculate the detectability of sources directly from blank sky regions of the co - added images without performing the computationally expensive process of image subtraction .",
    "a consequence of this is that we do not account for the effects of contaminating host galaxy light .",
    "other surveys that employ image subtraction have previously tested the effects of host light on detectability and found very little change from bright hosts to blank sky @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , our procedure may overestimate our detection probability for supernovae hosted by bright galaxies ( i.e. the rate may be _",

    "our results do , however , have direct applications for objects with faint hosts or otherwise dark backgrounds .    on a given image",
    ", the sensitivity to objects of a given magnitude will vary with location in the field due to variations in the instrumental psf as well as structure in the atmospheric transmissivity ( e.g. passing clouds ) , which can be resolved by our wide field . to account for these effects ,",
    "we locate a set of isolated field standards on each image to use in calculating the local psf and zeropoint .",
    "we divide each image into a grid with as many cells as can be made while maintaining around 100 or more field standards in each ( typically @xmath57 cells ) , and then calculate the average zeropoint and psf for each of these cells .",
    "the psf is found using the daophot routines in idl , and as noted above (  [ filtered_v_unfiltered ] ) , we use the usno - b1.0 r2 system for our zeropoints .    to locate appropriate blank sky regions",
    "at which we may add our simulated point sources , we first run sextractor on each unadulterated image with a low detection threshold to identify all objects and artifacts in the field .",
    "we then convolve the object mask image from sextractor with the average psf and select from the remaining , unmasked pixels when placing simulated sources .",
    "we find that even the small perturbations induced by adding a very faint ( @xmath58 ) test source can sometimes elevate a faint ( @xmath59 ) source previously ignored by sextractor into a spurious detection .",
    "it is therefore important to avoid locating test sources near such areas , which is why we use a lower extraction threshold when creating the object mask .",
    "we use the local psf and zeropoint determined above to determine the shape of the test source and scale it to a randomly chosen magnitude . using the dao_value routine",
    ", we create a thumbnail image of the source .",
    "we then add this source to the image one pixel at a time by drawing from a poissonian distribution with the expectation values set by the thumbnail pixel values and accounting for the detector gain .",
    "we finally run sextractor with the same parameter file used in the search . in order to simulate a statistically meaningful number of test objects without biasing the extraction process",
    ", we place only 20 test sources in each cell and repeat the simulation multiple times for each image . the minimum pitch for the test objects",
    "is set to be at least four times the average fwhm , so they do not interfere with each other . for the survey , candidates must be detected at a signal to noise greater than a set limit and they must have a fwhm between half and double the image average to be considered . both of these quantities are effected by the noise in the image and poisson statistics .",
    "we therefore define our detection efficiency from the number of simulated point sources that are detected by sextractor with parameters that pass these selection cuts relative to the total number simulated .",
    "we performed this test on over 7000 co - added images made from 2 or more frames . for comparison ,",
    "our survey includes about 55000 master subtractions .",
    "figure  [ fig : de_curves ] shows the average @xmath23 detection efficiency curves for isolated objects . as can be seen , the shape of the curve is robust to changes in the limiting magnitude , but the effect from variations in the fwhm is quite noticeable .    .",
    "the top panel shows that the shape of the detection efficiency curve is nearly independent of the limiting magnitude for a fixed fwhm .",
    "the lower panel shows that for a fixed @xmath60 , the shape of the detection efficiency curve depends strongly on the average fwhm of the image . for both plots ,",
    "the 50% completeness is brighter than the logged limit mainly because the simulations require a @xmath23 detection while the logged limits are derived from all extracted sources ( i.e. @xmath24 detections are included ) . ]",
    "accurate limiting magnitudes were not recorded for the co - added images during the first half of our survey , but we do have the limits for the individual images .",
    "using our later data , we determine an empirical relation between the limits of the individual images and the coadds derived from them .",
    "we started by assuming the limiting magnitudes for each individual image is approximately equal to three times the sky noise in the aperture . inverting this",
    ", we can find the sky noise expected on the co - added frame from the sum of the individual images , and turn this into a limiting magnitude guess .",
    "comparing these guesses to the actual values recorded in the logs over the second half of our survey , we find that the agreement is good for the deepest data , but there is a systematic offset for more shallow coadds . we perform a linear fit to these data and use it to derive magnitude limits for the coadds created in the beginning of the survey .",
    "it is not enough to merely detect a source to count it as a discovery ; each such candidate must pass additional screening to be included in our sample .",
    "this includes both machine cuts designed to reject false positives and cuts made by the humans who have the final say in elevating candidates to discoveries .",
    "often it is straight forward to determine the effects of the machine cuts through a monte carlo process : simulated supernovae drawn from the expected population are `` observed '' using the actual survey cadence and limiting magnitudes , and the resulting `` candidates '' are passed through the same machine vetting process as the real data .",
    "the sensitivity of the survey to sources with various apparent brightnesses and light curves can then be directly determined by noting the fraction of the simulated supernova that pass .",
    "the effects humans play in the ultimate selection of candidates could in principle be determined through a similar simulation if the test were performed concurrently with the actual survey to account for learned behavior . to get statistically meaningful results ,",
    "the human scanner would need to be presented with an enormous volume of simulated data , which is far too large of a burden on the researchers to be done in practice , although previous studies have performed limited versions of such human experimentation , which guide our tests .",
    "as stated above , the basic machine cuts applied to the raw candidates are 1 ) the fwhm should be between 0.5 and 2 times the image average , and 2 ) the signal - to - noise should be at least @xmath61 on sub1 and sub2 , and @xmath23 for sub .",
    "to help reduce the number of false positives created by imperfect subtraction of galaxy light , we also required that candidates near the cores of cataloged galaxies show an increase of at least 5% in flux over the reference template ( given the bright limits of our survey and prior coverage of our search fields by galaxy surveys , it is fair to assume that almost all galaxies as bright or brighter than our sne  ia  sample were cataloged ) .",
    "we are mainly sensitive to sne  ia  brighter than @xmath62 absolute , so hosts fainter than about @xmath63 are unaffected by this cut . of course , when the host galaxy is resolved , only the fraction of light coincident with the candidate matters in this percentage increase cut . for example",
    ", we recorded a 50% increase for sn  2005bg ( @xmath64 ) , which was discovered near the core of a @xmath65 host .",
    "candidates coincident with sources not listed in the galaxy catalogs ( typically foreground stars ) were required to show a 15% increase .",
    "the remaining candidates located more toward the outskirts of cataloged galaxies or in isolated regions were not required to show a minimum increase in flux .",
    "we do not include this selection criteria in our monte carlo simulations , so our efficiency in discovering supernovae in luminous host galaxies may be overestimated , which again means that our rate in giants may be underestimated .",
    "the basic setup for our efficiency calculation is similar to that used in previous rate studies ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "we determine the efficiency as a function of luminosity distance by considering a series of thin shells over which the efficiency ( and rate ) can be assumed to be constant . in each of these shells",
    "we simulate a number of sne  ia  randomly drawn from the pseudo - absolute magnitude distributions discussed in  [ lf ] , choose an appropriate light curve template and scale it to the given distance , and select a random date for maximum light . by comparing the expected magnitudes on the dates each simulated supernova",
    "would have been observed by our survey and using the actual survey detection limits on those nights , we determine the fraction of simulated sne  ia  that could have been detected in each distance bin .",
    "we take into account the detection efficiency curve discussed in  [ de ] appropriate to a given observation based on the limiting magnitude and fwhm recorded ( or estimated ) .",
    "for each observation epoch of each simulated supernova , we draw random numbers and compare these to the detection probabilities to determine if a simulated detection is made on each of the sub1 , sub2 , and sub . for each of our 177 fields",
    ", we simulated 100 sne  ia  in each of 360 distance shells spaced logarithmically from 40 to 1000mpc , which totals to over six million simulations for each pamd assumed . to naturally account for the changing number of survey fields , we allow simulated supernovae to peak anytime in any field during the entire survey period including off season .    to assess how accurately these simulations model the actual survey",
    ", we compare the luminosity distance , discovery magnitude , peak absolute magnitude , and detection number distributions predicted by the monte carlo simulations to the observed distributions .",
    "figure  [ fig : initial_cdf ] shows that the survey model discussed thus far is a poor representation of the true sample if the augmented loss pamd is adopted ( the same result holds if the sdss - ii model pamd is used ) .",
    "the model predicts the sne  ia  should be further away than observed , discovered at magnitudes fainter than observed , and the simulated supernovae are typically detected on fewer nights .",
    "this last result is key to understanding the failure of the model thus far .",
    "the model predicts that @xmath66% of the sne  ia  should be detected by the automatic search selection cuts on exactly one night .",
    "after all , the largest volume element is for the most distant events that are only detectable at their peak .",
    "since we have zero sne  ia  detected on just one night , it would seem that our survey is biased against such `` one - nighters . ''",
    "a possible explanation for this is the influence of the human scanners who have the final say in selecting targets .",
    "although it was never a formal requirement of the search that events be detected on more than one night ( and in fact , we triggered spectroscopic follow - up more than once on the same night based on a first detection ) , the informal requirement that candidates `` look good '' may have created a bias against the weakest detections .",
    "indeed , @xcite studied the response of human scanners to simulated supernovae and determined that there is such a bias against one - nighters .        to account for our apparent selection bias against weak detections , we apply a cut to the simulations and the real sample alike on the number of nights detected .",
    "we find that setting a minimum number of 5 nights , the model and actual distributions agree for both the augmented loss pamd and the sdss - ii model .",
    "this cut preferentially removes the most distant supernovae with the faintest observed magnitudes , so after applying this single correction , all of the model distributions considered agree with the actual observed sample ( fig .",
    "[ fig : final_cdf ] ) .",
    "the minimum number of detections was set by calculating the probability that the observed sample was drawn from the model distribution via a ks test .",
    "we assign a consistency probability , @xmath67 , by randomly drawing from the model distribution and comparing the maximum displacement in the cumulative distributions of the model and each draw . for 4 or fewer detections and the loss pamd",
    ", only 0.3% ( or 0.4% with the sdss - ii pamd model ) or less of the random draws have a displacement as large or larger than the real data compared to the models , so we reject these models . with a minimum of 5 detections ,",
    "the probability rises to 9% ( 5% ) , so we can not reject the null hypothesis that the data were drawn from this model distribution . in this case , the probabilities for the other three distributions are considerably higher , so the model does not appear to be inconsistent with the data .",
    "we also tested the effects of systematically shifting the input pamds in brightness .",
    "if we shift the augmented loss pamd 0.3mag fainter , both the predicted distance and absolute magnitude distributions become incompatible with the observed distributions ( as above we require pipeline detections on 5 or more nights ) . shifting the loss pamd 0.2mag brighter ,",
    "the predicted and observed distance distributions fall into agreement , but the absolute magnitude distributions are not compatible . with the sdss - ii pamd model , a shift of either 0.2mag",
    "fainter or brighter can be ruled out .",
    "this demonstrates that we would be able to detect if the magnitude system of the pamd employed was systematically biased with respect to our unfiltered magnitudes by more that expected from our checks in  [ lf ] .",

    "systematic offset , we do not find any evidence that our photometry is biased by the supernova light even in the faintest hosts .",
    "it is interesting that the b - band distributions of the sdss - ii and snls host galaxies appear to diverge toward the bright end , but there is a 12% chance that a random draw from the sdss - ii population would lead to an equal or larger displacement . as with the sdss - ii ,",
    "the deep coadds are sufficiently deep to detect all snls hosts brighter than about @xmath80 , and again the rotse - iiib sne  ia  prefer fainter hosts .    although loss targets specific galaxies , which biases the sample against low luminosity hosts , they adopt the @xcite k - band galaxy luminosity function and factor in their rate - size relation to determine the volumetric sne  ia  rate @xcite .",

    "if our sample s apparent preference of low luminosity hosts is a result of a selection effect , then our sne  ia  rate in giants should be lower than the actual rate while the rate in dwarfs should be accurate .",

    "special care must be taken to determine the actual survey area since the galaxy clusters of the survey are covered by an irregular grid of overlapping fields ( see figs .",

    ", we follow similar steps as reported in @xcite , but with an important difference .",
    "we start with the rate - size relation and snuk measurement from loss and combine this with the local galaxy k - band luminosity function @xcite . like the loss estimate , the calculation",
    "is done separately for early- and late - type galaxies , and then combined to give the final result .",
    "the published loss rate is determined by multiplying the local galaxy k - band luminosity densities ( @xmath117 and @xmath118 ) by average values of their snuk , which are determined from a weighted average involving the number densities from the galaxy luminosity functions .",
    "we choose to recalculate the loss rate through what we believe to be a more direct approach .",
    "we simply multiply the galaxy luminosity function by the rate - size relation function and integrate . with our approach , we find the volumetric rate implied by the loss sample is @xmath119sne  iampc@xmath5yr@xmath6@xmath100 .",
    "this is consistent with , if not slightly lower than , the published loss rate @xcite .",
    "we compute the statistical error through a monte carlo calculation including the uncertainty in the galaxy luminosity function , which gives a somewhat larger confidence interval than reported by loss .",
    "this rate is consistent with the sdss - ii rate , which is an odd result given the apparently different sne  ia  populations studied ( see  [ loss_v_sdss ] ) .",
    "thus , as was the case with the sdss - ii rate , the total rates we derive from our rotse - iiib sample are higher at the @xmath24 level .",
    "we also determine the loss rate in dwarfs and giants by simply changing the integration interval .",
    "again , loss and sdss - ii derive rates that are consistent with each other for dwarfs , giants , and the total host population even though their sne  ia  populations are apparently distinct ( see further discussion in  [ conclusions ] ) .",
    "using either sne  ia  pseudo - absolute magnitude distribution , our rate in giants is comparable to sdss - ii and loss , so there is no evidence that our selection process is biased against high luminosity hosts .",
    "however , with the loss distribution our rate in dwarf hosts is significantly higher than either sdss - ii or loss , and with the sdss - ii model pamd , our rate is higher at about the @xmath116 level .",
    "we have used the background population of supernovae discovered by the rotse - iiib telescope over a four year period to derive the volumetric rate of sne  ia .",
    "our rate is somewhat sensitive to the sne  ia  pseudo - absolute magnitude distribution ( pamd ) assumed in deriving our overall search efficiency , and we find that recent rates studies have used different , incompatible pamds .",
    "we have calculated our rates using both the loss pamd augmented with a small population of high luminosity events ( 1% of the total ) and the same pamd model ( and similar sample cuts ) employed in the sdss - ii rate measurement to quantify our distance dependent search efficiency . with the augmented loss pamd , we find a rate that is more than double published values in a similar redshift range .",
    "this rate is higher than the sdss - ii or loss rates at @xmath120% confidence ( ignoring systematics for the moment ) .",
    "similarly , performing the calculation on our `` normal - bright '' sne  ia  in a manner directly comparable to the sdss - ii measurement ( including the same pamd model ) , our rate is still nearly double that found by the sdss - ii out to a slightly higher redshift . in this case ,",
    "our rate is only higher than the sdss - ii value at the @xmath116 confidence level , however .",
    "the loss pamd is utterly incompatible with the sdss - ii model , which , in turn , is incompatible with the actual volume limited sample from the first year sdss - ii .",
    "neither the sdss - ii model nor the loss pamd allow for events as bright as sn2007if , so it would seem that none of the available distributions account for the full population of sne  ia .",
    "additionally , the large extinction value reported for the photometrically selected sdss - ii sn09266 suggests that these distributions may also fail to account for the true distribution of host absorptions .",
    "down to about -18.8mag , the loss and sdss - ii model pamds agree , but the loss sample shows almost double the relative contribution from fainter events .",
    "the solid agreement between the loss and sdss - ii rates is perplexing given that they are apparently sampling completely different sne  ia  populations .",
    "the systematic errors in our rate measurement are dominated by the uncertainty in the sne  ia  pamd , including how such distributions derived from ( mostly ) filtered photometry apply to our unfiltered data set .",
    "our total rate estimate with the sdss - ii model pamd is 30% lower than our rate with the augmented loss pamd .",
    "part of this is due to the exclusion of sne 2007if and 2008ab from the sdss - ii model rate due to their high luminosities ( both of these events also have dwarf hosts ) .",
    "the larger fraction of low - luminosity events with the loss pamd makes up the additional difference .",
    "our search is mainly sensitive to background supernovae with pseudo - absolute magnitudes brighter than about @xmath121mag , so at least 42% of sne  ia  are definitely missed by our search if the loss distribution is assumed , but this fraction falls to just 8% if we use the sdss - ii model .",
    "we use our rate based on the sdss - ii model pamd to constrain the lower bound on the sne  ia  rate and our augmented loss rate for the upper bound . adding in a @xmath122mag systematic offset to account for the allowed uncertainty in our unfiltered magnitude system with respected to the ( filtered ) pamds considered , our final sne  ia  rate ( including @xmath123 statistical errors ) at a mean redshift of @xmath0 is then between 3.7 and 13.3 in units of @xmath124sne  iampc@xmath5yr@xmath6@xmath100",
    ".    as our sample is spectroscopically complete , we do not include uncertainty for unclassified candidates .",
    "this can be an important concern for other , non - spectroscopically complete studies .",
    "for example , the sdss has reported 561 spectroscopically confirmed sne  ia , but there are at least 1070 photometrically probable sne  ia  uncovered by the same survey , and presumably many more transient candidates in all including peculiar sne  ia , which may not pass the photometric screening @xcite .",
    "there is also the question of whether all objects technically classified as sne  ia  from their spectra should really be grouped in the same physical category .",
    "for example , some have argued that some peculiar sne  ia , such as sn2005hk , may not be thermonuclear supernovae ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "one event in our sample , sn2006ct , bears some resemblance to this subclass , although we note some differences as well in ",
    "[ sample_notes ] . removing",
    "this one event would lower our total rates by about 6% . on the other hand , some events grouped with ccsne",
    "may actually be sne  ia  in disguise .",
    "in particular , some typeiin may be better suited in the sne  ia  camp @xcite . over our survey period",
    ", we discovered three background typeiin supernovae ( sne2006db , 2006tf , and 2008am ) , but none of these have been linked to typeia explosions .",
    "in using the augmented loss pamd , we have attempted to measure the total sne  ia  rate including hubble diagram outliers and other peculiar events .",
    "this should be directly comparable to the rate measured by loss who include sn1991t - like , sn1991bg - like , and sn2002cx - like events in their sample , but this has not always been common practice in the literature .",
    "many of the previous sne  ia  rate measurements have explicitly excluded events that deviate from the sub - sample of sne  ia  that are most useful as cosmological probes . for example , the recent sne  ia  rates measured by the snls @xcite are strictly valid only for sne  ia  with light curve widths close to the nominal value ( @xmath125 , but see also @xcite ) .",
    "sne  ia  like sn2003fg ( a.k.a .",
    "snls-03d3bb ) are not discussed .",
    "similarly , the sdss - ii explicitly removed their peculiar sne  ia , such as the interacting sn  2005gj , and the selection cut on the mlcs2k2 light - curve fits biases their sample against high luminosity , sn  1999aa - like events @xcite . because of this , the snls and sdss - ii rates only reflect the frequency for a fraction of the larger sne  ia  population .",
    "as to the high luminosity sne  ia  excluded by snls and sdss - ii , however , we note that if these constituted more than a few percent of the total population then they would completely dominate our flux limited sample , which is not the case .",
    "although the significance of our rates being higher than the canonical value is low , it is worth discussing how this may have come about .",
    "one point of intrigue is our excess of sne  ia  in dwarf galaxies over what would be expected from the loss or sdss - ii studies .",
    "if our rate for these hosts is correct , then either the sne  ia  rate size relation increases for the lowest luminosity hosts as compared to the range studied by loss , or the faint end of the galaxy luminosity function used to convert the loss luminosity specific rate to a volumetric rate may be under - counting the actual supply of dwarf galaxies .",
    "such correction factors are not required for the sdss - ii rate , so the higher frequency of sne  ia  in low luminosity hosts is puzzling . in the full background sample , 7 out of 23 of the rotse - iiib hosts are fainter than @xmath126mag , as are 5 out of the 18 used for the rate calculation with the augmented loss pamd .",
    "these fractions ( @xmath127% ) are significantly larger than the 1 out of 79 sne  ia  hosts in the sdss - ii @xmath105 sample that have such low luminosity hosts ( hosts brighter than @xmath128mag can be detected through our analysis out to this redshift limit , but only sdss - ii sn13038 is fainter ) .",
    "if this difference is attributed to a selection bias against giant hosts in the rotse - iiib sample , then we must increase our rate to account for the missing sne  ia  in giants . but to achieve the same low to high - luminosity host ratio as the sdss - ii , our already high rates must be increased by factors of 4 to 5 !",
    "another possibility to consider is that the sdss - ii may somehow be biased against low luminosity hosts , but this is difficult to imagine .",
    "a remote possibility is that the use of host photo - z s in selecting targets for spectroscopic follow - up may boost the likelihood of classifying sne  ia  in giants rather than in dwarfs , which were unlikely to have been detected in the reference data available during the search . in that case",
    ", there would still need to be a second bias to reject the sne  ia  in dwarfs since photometrically probable yet non - spectroscopically confirmed sne  ia  were included in the sdss - ii rates @xcite",
    ".    a possible contributor to the relative infrequency of dwarf hosts in the sdss - ii sample may be the cut on the mlcs2k2 light - curve fits used in selecting photometrically probably sne  ia  @xcite .",
    "this cut can remove high luminosity sne  ia , such as sn  1999aa , which tend to be associated with lower luminosity hosts @xcite .",
    "however , only one of the five sne  ia  from our rate sample that fall in @xmath126mag hosts can be considered highly luminous : sn  2007if . since",
    "the sdss - ii does contain a number of higher redshift sne  ia  whose hosts are not detected even in our deep coadds , it does not appear that the sdss - ii had a selection bias against either `` hostless '' sne  ia  or sne  ia  in dwarf hosts , and it is not obvious why such hosts are so much more frequent in the rotse - iiib sample .",
    "another questions is why is there such a larger fraction of faint ( pseudo absolute magnitude @xmath129 ) sne  ia  in the loss sample as compared to the sdss - ii ? despite being targeted , the loss galaxy sample spans a range of masses and colors , and the full loss galaxy sample has absolute b and k - band magnitude distributions that are consistent with the sdss - ii sne  ia  hosts in the @xmath79 range ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : hosts ] ) . applying the loss rate - size relation only to galaxies brighter than @xmath130 in the @xcite galaxy luminosity function and selecting only the 48% of sne  ia  fainter than @xmath131 in the loss pseudo - absolute magnitude distribution ,",
    "the _ minimum _ rate of low - luminosity sne  ia  implied is @xmath132sne  iampc@xmath5yr@xmath6@xmath100 . in this case",
    ", the first year sdss - ii @xmath1 sample should contain at least 6 sne  ia  fainter than @xmath133mag .",
    "even with the peculiar sn2005hk and the photometrically selected sdss - ii sn09266 ( with its heavy host absorption of @xmath134mag ) , there are still only 3 events in the sdss - ii @xmath1 first year sample at such low luminosities .",
    "it is not clear how the sdss - ii could have missed the faint tail of the sne  ia  distribution ( e.g. sn  1991bg - like events around @xmath135 ) , yet we know of only two such spectroscopically confirmed events discovered in the three years of the sdss - ii ( 2007jh and 2007 mm ; @xcite ) and only one possible sn2002cx - like event ( sn2007ie ; @xcite ) .",
    "additionally , the palomar transient factory @xcite has recently shown that there are perhaps even more varieties of peculiar , low - luminosity objects that may be spectroscopically classified as sne  ia   ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but these are apparently absent from the sdss - ii as well .",
    "the apparent lack of low - luminosity sne  ia  could mean that there was an unknown selection bias against such objects and that the total rate of sne  ia  is higher than found by the sdss - ii .    the tension between the loss and sdss - ii pamds poses a potentially worrisome systematic bias for sne  ia  rate studies .",
    "@xcite argue that the sdss - ii was sensitive to even sub - luminous sne  ia  below @xmath1 , so even if their model distribution were flawed , this would not have a significant impact on their rate calculation ( but again , the dearth of low - luminosity sne  ia  as compared to the expectations of loss is puzzling at best and may suggest the sdss - ii has altogether missed some sne  ia ) .",
    "however , if there is a low - luminosity population of sne  ia  that is not accounted for in the sdss - ii model distribution , this will lead to an overestimation of the search efficiency at the higher redshifts considered in @xcite , and thus an underestimation of the actual rate . in general , rate studies that push their samples out to the highest redshifts possible with their surveys have an even stronger malmquist bias and are thus more sensitive to systematic errors in their adopted pseudo - absolute magnitude distributions . these distributions",
    "may also vary with redshift .",
    "it is therefore important to securely determine the true sne  ia  pseudo - absolute magnitude distribution from complete , volume limited surveys as could potentially be done by the palomar transient factory at low redshifts and at moderate redshifts with the hyper - suprimecam on subaru .",
    "another issue that may lead to bogus rate evolution measurements is the changing definition of the sne  ia  sub population measured by different surveys .",
    "low to moderate redshift surveys often use light curve fits to select sne  ia  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but the highest redshift studies often have far fewer epochs available due to the increased follow - up cost , and must therefore rely more heavily on color selection techniques @xcite .",
    "it is not clear that these different cuts capture identical sub populations so that differences in the rates between different surveys may be taken directly as evidence for evolution in the sne  ia  rate .",
    "this question may be resolved by performing a rolling search similar to sdss - ii but sensitive to very high redshift sne  ia , as will be possible with the hyper - suprimecam survey .",
