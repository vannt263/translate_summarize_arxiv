    "casimir effect @xcite has attracted a lot of attention due to its wide applications in different areas of physics and its potential impact to nanotechnology . for a good review about the subject",
    ", one can read for example the book @xcite .",
    "naively , the casimir energy is a sum of the ground state energies of all the eigenmodes of the quantum field .",
    "however , the computation of the casimir energy is not a simple task since the naive summation is divergent and regularization is required . before the turn of the century , the exact computations were limited to some simple configurations with a particularly large amount of works being devoted to the configuration of two parallel plates .",
    "since the work of lamoreaux @xcite in 1997 , casimir force have been measured with high precision in various configurations @xcite .",
    "this has stimulated theorists to study the casimir force between any two objects . at the beginning ,",
    "several approximation schemes were developed for this purpose , such as the semiclassical approach @xcite , the optical path approximation @xcite and the multiple reflection approximation @xcite .    since the year 2006",
    ", exact computation of the casimir energy between two objects has become possible . in @xcite ,",
    "gies et al .",
    "derived a worldline representation of the casimir interaction between two objects imposed with dirichlet boundary conditions . in @xcite , bulgac et al . computed the casimir interaction energy between dirichlet spheres or between a dirichlet sphere and a dirichlet plate using the multiple scattering approach ,",
    "whose application in casimir effect can be dated back to the work of balian and duplantier @xcite .",
    "later several other researchers computed the casimir interaction in various configurations such as sphere - sphere , sphere - plane , cylinder - plane and cylinder - cylinder @xcite using some form of multiple scattering approach .",
    "a general scheme for computing the casimir interaction between any two objects was developed by emig et al . in @xcite for scalar fields and in @xcite for electromagnetic fields .",
    "a totally different approach was used by dalvit et al .",
    "they used mode summation approach to compute the casimir interaction energy of two eccentric cylinders with dirichlet , neumann or perfectly conducting boundary conditions .",
    "recently , we developed a general scheme for computing the casimir interaction energy between two objects from the perspective of mode summation approach @xcite , which is fundamentally equivalent to the scheme developed by emig et al . from the perspective of multiple scattering theory .",
    "the basic ingredients in the exact representation of the casimir interaction energy between two objects are the t - matrices of each of the objects and the translation matrices between the objects .",
    "the t - matrix of an object only depends on the coordinate system chosen and the boundary conditions imposed on that object , and it has been calculated for a plane , a sphere and a cylinder under various boundary conditions . the more difficult part in obtaining the exact representation of the casimir interaction energy is in the computation of the translation matrices . for cylinder - cylinder and sphere - sphere configurations , the translation matrices are well known . for cylinder - plane and sphere - plane configurations ,",
    "they have been obtained in @xcite . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", the translation matrices for the sphere - cylinder configuration have not been worked out before , and hence the casimir interaction between a sphere and a cylinder has never been studied . the goal of the current work is to fill in this gap .    in section [ sec2 ] , we generalize the operator approach in @xcite to compute the translation matrices between a sphere and a cylinder for a scalar field , and hence write down the tgtg ( exact ) formula for the casimir interaction energy between a sphere and a cylinder which are both imposed with dirichlet boundary conditions or neumann boundary conditions . in section [ sec3 ] , we do the same for electromagnetic casimir interaction between a perfectly conducting sphere and a perfectly conducting cylinder . in section [ sec4 ] , we use the exact tgtg formulas to derive the leading term of the casimir interaction energy when the separation between the sphere and the cylinder is large . in the appendix [ sec5 ] , we use the proximity force approximation @xcite and the derivative expansion proposed by @xcite to compute the small separation leading order term and next to leading order term of the casimir interaction . in principle , these can also be computed from the exact formula but it is too complicated to be included here .",
    "this problem will be addressed in the future .",
    "= 0.6    in this section , we derive the exact scalar casimir interaction energy between a sphere and a cylinder . as shown in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] , the centers of the sphere and the cylinder are situated at @xmath6 and @xmath7 respectively .",
    "the radii of the sphere and the cylinder are given respectively by @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the length of the cylinder is denoted by @xmath8 , and we assume that @xmath9 .    in spherical coordinates @xmath10 with center at @xmath11 , the scalar field @xmath12 , @xmath13 , where @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , can be expanded as @xmath17 here @xmath18where @xmath19 are the spherical bessel functions , @xmath20 are the spherical harmonics and @xmath21 are the associated legendre functions .",
    "the constants @xmath22 and @xmath23 are chosen so that @xmath24    on the other hand , the scalar field @xmath12 can also be expanded in cylindrical coordinates @xmath25 with center at @xmath26 : @xmath27 where @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 the constants @xmath33 and @xmath34 are chosen so that @xmath35    using multiple scattering formalism @xcite or mode summation approach @xcite , it was shown that the scalar casimir interaction energy can be written in the form @xmath36 where @xmath37 is called the tgtg formula .",
    "the matrices @xmath38 and @xmath39 are obtained by matching the boundary conditions on the sphere and on the cylinder respectively .",
    "these matrices are related to scattering matrices @xcite and have been computed in a lots of literature .",
    "they are diagonal matrices .",
    "for dirichlet boundary conditions , the diagonal elements @xmath40 and @xmath41 are given by @xmath42for neumann boundary conditions , @xmath43here @xmath44    the hardest part of the problem in is to compute the translation matrices @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "this has not been worked out before . in the following ,",
    "we generalize the operator approach introduced by wittman @xcite ( see also @xcite ) to calculate these translation matrices .    as in @xcite , we introduce the differential operator @xmath47 defined by @xmath48here @xmath49 , @xmath50 is the legendre polynomial of degree @xmath51 and @xmath52 is its @xmath53-times derivative .",

    "this leads to some doubt whether the casimir interaction energy is real . in the following ,",
