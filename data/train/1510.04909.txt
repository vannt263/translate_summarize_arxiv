    "diffraction patterns produced by grazing scattering of swift atoms and molecules ( with energies in the kev range ) on surfaces are nowadays becoming a powerful surface analysis tool , which is giving rise to a technique known as grazing - incidence fast atom diffraction ( gifad or fad ) winter11,zugarramurdi15 . in recent years",
    "the fad method was successfully applied to very different kinds of materials , ranging from insulators schuller07,rousseau07,schuller12 to semiconductors khemliche09,debiossac14 and metals @xcite , as well as structured  films @xcite and molecules seifertprl13 adsorbed on surfaces . however , in spite of the extensive experimental and theoretical work devoted to the research of fad since its first experimental observation @xcite , the complete understanding of the underlying quantum processes is far from being achieved . in particular , the study of the mechanisms that contribute to the coherence or decoherence of the scattered particles is  still in its infancy .",
    "the observation of quantum interference effects for fast atoms impinging on crystal surfaces strongly relies on the preservation of quantum coherence @xcite and in this regard , the coherence conditions of the incident beam play an important role . motivated by ref .",
    "@xcite , in this article we investigate the influence of the collimation of the incident beam on fad patterns making use of a recently developed approach , named surface - initial value representation ( sivr ) approximation @xcite . with this goal",
    "we explicitly take into account the experimental collimating conditions to determine the surface region that is _ coherently _ illuminated by the particle beam , using this information to build the initial wave packet that describes the unperturbed state of the incident particle within the sivr method .",
    "the sivr approximation is a semi - quantum approach that was derived from the initial value representation ( ivr ) method by miller @xcite by using the corresponding semi - quantum time evolution operator in the frame of a time - dependent distorted - wave formalism .",
    "this strategy incorporates an approximate description of classically forbidden transitions on the dark side of rainbow angles , making it possible to avoid the classical rainbow divergence present in previous semi - classical models for fad , like the surface - eikonal ( se ) approach @xcite .",
    "such a weakness of the se method affects the intensity of the outermost diffraction maxima when these maxima are close to the classical rainbow angles rubiano13 , i.e. the extreme deflection angles of the classical projectile distribution .",
    "the sivr approach , instead , provides an appropriate description of fad patterns along the whole angular range , even around classical rainbow angles , without requiring the use of convolutions to smooth the theoretical curves @xcite .",
    "therefore , the sivr method can be considered as an attractive alternative to quantum wave packet propagations , offering a clear representation of the main mechanisms of the process in terms of classical trajectories through the feynman path integral formulation of quantum mechanics .    in order to analyze the influence of the beam collimation on fad spectra , an extended version of the sivr approximation - including the collimating parameters -",
