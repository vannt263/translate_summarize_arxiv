    ". figures  [ fig : pxy_comp_t1_p1_d3 ] and  [ fig : pxy_comp_t0.42_p1_d10 ] compare the ik and the h - versions to calculate the lateral pressure @xmath2 for @xmath178 , @xmath168 and @xmath188 , @xmath183 , respectively . whereas both methods oscillate in phase with one another for the thicker film , they are anti - correlated for @xmath178 .",
    "the lateral pressure of the ik - method is positive close to the walls , but negative in the middle of the film , whereas the behavior is just vice versa for the h - method . due to the aforementionend ambiguity of @xmath2",
    "it is impossible to decide which methods yields the physically more realistic result .",
    "if the film thickness increases , the qualitative difference between the ik- and h - methods ( almost ) vanishes and only quantitative differences remain .",
    "the oscillations of @xmath2 clearly reflect the monomer profile . in the inner portion of the film",
    "they are much weaker for the h - method than for of the ik - method .",
    "this is related to the local nature of eq .",
    "( [ eq : p_t : harasima ] ) due to the presence of delta - function .",
    "density oscillations are thus incorporated not only in the kinetic term , but also also in the virial part of the harasima formula .",
    "both terms partially cancel each other . although the profile generated by eq .",
    "( [ eq : p_t : harasima ] ) is thus closer to @xmath194 than that of eq .",
    "( [ eq : p_t : raoberne ] ) , this should not be considered as an argument in favor of the h - method .",
    "a clear distinction between both methods would only be possible if one could find a quantity which specifically probes @xmath2 and whose behavior is known _ a priori _ , as it was the case for @xmath4 .      as mentioned in sect .",
    "[ subsec : ikh ] , integration of the pressure profiles over @xmath3 yields the same result for the ik- , h- and ik1-expressions . therefore , all methods must lead to the same surface tension @xmath82 [ i.e. , eq .",
    "( [ eq : kb : gamma ] ) ] .",
    "this expectation is nicely borne out by the simulation data for all film thicknesses and temperatures studied , where @xmath82 was calculated by eq .",
    "( [ eq : def : gamma ] ) . figure  [ fig : gammad5 ] exemplifies this behavior for @xmath195 ( @xmath196 ) . with decreasing temperature the surface tension increases by about a factor of 1.5 .",
    "qualitatively , this temperature dependence is expected .",
    "the monomer density of a polymer melt close to a hard wall exhibits a profile that is large at the wall and decays towards the bulk value in an oscillatory fashion with increasing distance from the wall ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : density_profile_und_zs_comp_t0.42_p1_d10_sym ] as an example ) @xcite .",
    "since the average density grows with decreasing temperature in a simulation at constant pressure , the maxima and minima of the profile become more pronounced .",
    "this means that there are more monomers in the highly populated layers at low than at high temperatures , and that the oscillations of profile become more long - ranged .",
    "these effects tighten the film so that the free energy needed to move monomers out of the interface , i.e. , the surface tension , should increase as temperature decreases .",
    "the same effect is expected when reducing the film thickness because the layering is more pronounced in thinner films .",
    "this expectation is borne out by the simulation data ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : gamma_von_t_d5 + 20_on_the_fly ] ) .",
    "contrary to @xmath82 , the discussion of sect .",
    "[ subsec : ikh ] implies that the surface of tension , @xmath5 , depends on the method applied .",
    "this fact is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : zsd5 ] which shows the temperature dependence of @xmath5 for the ik- , h- and ik1-methods .",
    "the difference between ik and the h - methods is rather small , whereas the ik1-result lies substantially above the values of the other two methods .",
    "since @xmath5 can be interpreted as the distance of closest approach of a monomer to the wall , i.e. , as the effective position of the wall , the following simple argument rules out the ik1-result : at temperature @xmath197 , a particle can only penetrate into a ( soft ) wall up to the point , @xmath198 , where the wall potential balances thermal energy of the particle , i.e. , @xmath199 .",
    "using eq .",
    "( [ eq : def : uw ] ) this gives @xmath200 equation  ( [ eq : def : zw ] ) is compatible with the ik- and h - predictions , but not with the ik1-result .",
    "another way to illustrate this point is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : density_profile_und_zs_comp_t0.42_p1_d10_sym ] where we plotted the monomer density profile of a film of thickness @xmath188 at @xmath183 . with increasing film thickness the ik- and h - values for @xmath198 approach one another  for @xmath201 for example , they are indistinguishable within the error bars ( not shown here )  , but the disparity to the ik1-result remains .",
    "the figure clearly shows that the ik1-method places the effective wall position deeply into the interior of the film , whereas it has to be situated in the region where the density profile approaches zero .",
    "we have reported simulation results for the pressure tensor of polymeric thin films which investigate the ambiguity in the definition of the potential part of this quantity .",
    "we studied three common methods : the method of irving and kirkwood  @xcite , that of harasima  @xcite and an approximation of the ik - method , the so - called ik1-approach  @xcite . on a microscopic scale ,",
    "our simulation results show significant differences between the ik- and h - methods for the lateral component @xmath2 of the pressure tensor . however , both methods agree with each other for the normal component @xmath4 .",
    "they lead to a constant profile in accord with mechanical stability . on the other hand ,",
    "the ik1-formula exhibits strong oscillations of @xmath4 , as also found in @xcite .",
    "the origin of this discrepancy comes from the fact that ik1-method corresponds to a zeroth - order approximation of the ik - expression , which assumes translational invariance of the two - particle density @xmath202 with respect to the difference vector @xmath203 .",
    "this assumption is not valid in thin films which exhibit density oscillations that are damped out only gradually with increasing distance from the wall .",
    "this local structure becomes more pronounced with decreasing temperature and film thickness .",
    "the more pronounced it is , the stronger the ik1-method will deviate from the ik - expression .    however , when integrated over the whole system all methods give the same result .",
    "thus , the surface tension , @xmath82 , of a planar system can still be calculated using each of these methods .",
    "this is no longer possible for moments of the pressure profiles , such as the surface of tension @xmath5 .",
    "the fact that ik1-expression can be used to calculate the surface tension although it is based on an incorrect expression for the local pressure tensor has occasionally caused confusion in the literature .",
    "for instance , pandey et al .",
    "@xcite applied the ik1-expressions to polymer films confined between one repulsive and one attractive wall , taking the local pressure profiles literally .",
    "the present analysis shows that the pressure profiles published in  @xcite are incorrect .",
    "thus we hope that the present analysis will help to avoid this confusion in future simulation studies .",
    "* acknowledgments * + we thank m. mller and j. horbach for enlightening discussions , and the unknown referee for valuable comments on the manuscript .",
    "generous grants of simulation time by the computer center at the university of mainz , the hlrz jlich and the rhrk in kaiserslautern are gratefully acknowledged .",
    "this work was supported by the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft under sfb262/d2 .",
    "is indebted to the european science foundation for financial support by the esf programme on `` experimental and theoretical investigations of complex polymer structures '' ( supernet ) .",
    "strictly speaking , there is also an ambiguity associated with the kinetic contribution to the pressure tensor .",
    "as pointed out , this contribution can be obtained by calculating the momentum flux across an infinitesimal surface @xmath40 at a given time , and then by averaging over time .",
    "the question is how the point in time when the particle crosses @xmath40 is determined ? is it when the particle just touches the surface ? or is it when its center of mass coincides with the position of the surface ? obviously , there are infinitely many possible definitions of a crossover time .",
