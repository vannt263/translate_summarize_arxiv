    "the following is an unedited text of section 1 of author s 1996 j robert oppenheimer fellowship research proposal :    neutrinos were introduced in physics by pauli to save conservation of energy and momentum in the @xmath0-decay : neutron @xmath1 proton + electron + anti - electron neutrino .",
    "all the planets and galaxies are embedded in a sea of neutrinos with a number density of roughly 100 neutrinos/@xmath2 .",
    "our own sun shines via thermonuclear processes that emit neutrinos in enormous number . because of their weak interactions , neutrinos , unlike photons , can pass through extremely dense matter very efficiently",
    "this fact makes neutrinos primary agents for energy transport in the dense matter associated with supernovae and neutron stars .    since their initial experimental observation by frederick reines and c. l. cowan , neutrinos",
    "are now known to exist in three types .",
    "these types are called `` electron , '' `` muon , '' and `` tau '' and are generically written as @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 .",
    "a series of empirical anomalies indicates that neutrinos may not have a definite mass but , instead , be in a linear superposition of three different mass eigenstates .",
    "the mass differences in the underlying mass eigenstates would cause a neutrino of one type to `` oscillate '' to a neutrino of another type as may have been seen recently at the lsnd neutrino oscillation experiment at lanl .",
    "the phenomenon of neutrino oscillations , if experimentally confirmed , will have profound consequences not only for nuclear and particle physics but also for astrophysics and cosmology .",
    "i have already noted the neutrinos to be prime drivers of supernova explosions .",
    "the phenomenon of neutrino oscillations will alter the evolution of supernova explosion .",
    "the basic problem that still stands unsolved is a robust theory of supernova explosions . in the context of supernova explosions , and the problem of obtaining successful explosions , i now follow colgate _",

    "they note that in some models `` this result in strong , large scale convective flows in the gravitational field of the neutron star that can drive successful , albeit weak , explosions . ''",
    "i emphasize that all authors find that without `` fine tuning '' the explosions are weak and lack about five percent of the energy needed for an explosion .",
    "qualitatively , this missing energy needed for a robust model of explosion may be provided if the length scales over which neutrino oscillations take place are of the same order of magnitude as the spatial extent of a neutron star and neutrino - sphere , because while    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ the energy flux in each of the electron neutrinos and antineutrinos is about @xmath6 few@xmath7 @xmath8 ergs s@xmath9 , with comparable fluxes of @xmath4 , @xmath10 , @xmath5 , and @xmath11 , _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    the    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ average energy of @xmath3 is about 10 mev , the average energy of other neutrinos is _ higher _ by a factor of 2 for @xmath4 and @xmath10 , and by a factor of 3 for @xmath5 , and @xmath11 .",

    "qualitatively this contributes in the direction of the robustness of the explosion .",
    "my resent work , with c. burgard , on the solution of terrestrial neutrino anomalies provides precisely the neutrino oscillation parameters that yield the oscillation length scales of just the right order of magnitude for supernova physics ( and in addition predict the observed solar neutrino deficit ) .    in order to make these qualitative arguments quantitative two additional physical processes affecting the above indicated _ vacuum",
    "_ neutrino oscillations must be incorporated : ( a ) the presence of large electron densities in astrophysical environment makes it necessary that relevant matter induced effects , suggested by mikheyev , smirnov and wolfenstein , be considered , and ( b ) my work , with c. burgard , on gravitationally induced neutrino oscillation phases also indicates that strong gravitational fields associated with neutron stars may introduce important modifications to neutrino oscillations , and hence to the suggested energy transport mechanism via neutrino oscillations . as part of my jro studies i propose to implement the above outlined program quantitatively .",
    "my quantitative and qualitative studies so far give reasons to claim that there is every physical reason to believe that the `` missing energy '' in the non - robust models for supernova explosion , the anomaly in the observed deficit in the solar neutrino flux , the excess @xmath12 events seen at lsnd at los alamos , and the anomaly associated with atmospheric neutrinos , _ all _ arise from the same underlying new physics the phenomenon of neutrino oscillations from one type to another .",
    "it is of profound physical importance to place these suspected physical connections on firm quantitative foundations .",
    "the above 1996 proposal was a logical continuation , and directly connected to , a work jointly done the same year with c. burgard .",
    "it has been widely known informally , without a full access to its text .",
    "this addendum fills the gap of its availability .    while writing these remarks the author has learned that the effect of neutrino oscillations on supernovae explosions was first presented in a talk by mazurek @xcite . soon afterward",
    ", wolfenstein showed that for collapsing stellar cores , matter effects dramatically suppress neutrino oscillations @xcite , with the following one - line _ abstract _ , `` it is shown that even if neutrino oscillations exist they are effectively inhibited from occurring in collapsing stars because of the high matter density . ''",
    "the suggestion that neutrino oscillations may play a significant role in supernovae explosions has been pursued vigorously , though often without acknowledging the proposal of sec . 1 , or talk of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the matter is far from settled , see , e.g , @xcite and whether or not neutrino oscillations play a significant role in supernovae explosions shall depend if there are shells / regions of space in stellar collapse where matter effects @xcite play no essential role . the spatial extent of these regions , we suspect , must be significantly smaller than neutron - star size .",
    "should such regions exist in actual astrophysical situations , the final outcome of neutrino oscillations on supernovae explosions shall depend , in part , whether or not the lnsd signal is confirmed @xcite .",
    "this is so because the lsnd - suggested @xmath13 alone gives _",
    "smallest _ , by about three orders of magnitude ( as compared with the solar and atmospheric data @xcite ) , required vacuum - oscillation length .",
    "assuming a @xmath14   as discussed on numerous occasions as early as 1994 at los alamos by one of us , '' symmetry noted in @xcite , though important , is not new .",

    "@xcite   the obtained length ranges from about 10 meters for a 1 mev neutrino , to 300 meters for a 25 mev neutrino .",
    "importantly , it is to be noted that neutrino oscillations form a set of flavor - oscillation clocks and these clock suffer gravitational redshift which can be in the neighborhood 20 percent .",
