    "the interaction of solitons has been a subject of great interest right from the beginning of their early investigations  @xcite .",

    "apart from its scientific importance soliton interactions have also a practical importance .",
    "for instance , interaction between optical solitons sets the limit on the rate of information transfer in fiber optic communication systems @xcite . due to important applications ,",
    "soliton interactions are extensively studied , both theoretically and experimentally , in optical fibers @xcite , photonic crystals @xcite and plasmas @xcite .",
    "recent experimental studies have shown that in addition to interactions between neighboring optical solitons in close proximity , there exists also a long range interaction between them @xcite .",
    "the generation of spatially separated coherent matter - wave packets and their subsequent interaction constitute the basic phenomena in the operation of modern atomic interferometers @xcite working in the solitonic regime @xcite where the fringe visibility is significantly increased compared with an ordinary atomic cloud , as demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "solitons have been experimentally observed in many areas of physics , including the bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) @xcite .",
    "the experiments with solitons in bec reported so far were concerned with the creation of solitons and studying their collective dynamics . regarding the type of interaction between matter - wave solitons a conjecture was made from the behavior of neighboring solitons in a soliton train @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , it would be interesting to explore systematically the interaction between two matter - wave solitons with varying spatial separation and relative phase .",
    "recent progress in controlled creation and manipulation of matter - wave solitons in bec @xcite indicates that such experiments on soliton interactions are now within the scope of current technology .",
    "a key role belongs to a minimally destructive polarization phase - contrast imaging technique @xcite , that allows to make multiple imaging of the soliton pair during a single experimental run , as reported recently with regard to phase - dependent collision of two matter - wave solitons @xcite .",
    "an essentially new method reported in ref .",
    "@xcite for controlled ( i.e. deterministic in both soliton position and momentum ) creation of matter - wave bright solitons and soliton pairs without the use of feschbach resonances opens new perspectives for investigation of soliton interactions in bec with unprecedented accuracy .",
    "experimental realization of chromium bec with long range dipole - dipole atomic interactions @xcite has opened new direction in the physics of ultra - cold quantum gases .",
    "subsequently two other species with strong dipolar interactions , namely dysprosium @xcite and erbium @xcite , were bose - condensed .",
    "the principal difference of chromium condensates from the alkali atom condensates is that , @xmath2cr has a large permanent magnetic dipole moment @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the bohr magneton . since the dipole - dipole force is proportional to the square of the magnetic moment ,",
    "the dipolar interactions in chromium condensate is a factor of 36 times stronger than in alkali atom condensates , like @xmath5rb ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "similar arguments pertain also for other dipolar quantum gases , @xmath7dy ( @xmath8 ) and @xmath9er ( @xmath10 ) .    in this work",
    "we study , by means of variational approximation ( va ) and numerical simulations , the interaction between two bright solitons in a dipolar bec .",
    "we employ a strategy similar to that used in the experimental investigation of the interaction forces between fiber optic solitons @xcite .",
    "following that idea in numerical experiments we create two bright solitons at some initial spatial separation , then give the pair a chance to evolve for some period of time , and finally measure the distance between the solitons when the evolution time has elapsed .",
    "depending on whether the distance between the solitons has increased , decreased or remained unchanged , compared to its initial value , we conclude about the type of soliton interaction as being repulsive , attractive or neutral , respectively .",
    "there is a qualitative difference between solitons in dipolar and non - dipolar media .",
    "specifically , two anti - phase solitons in dipolar media attract each - other at large separation and repel at short separation . due to this property",
    "they can form stable bound states with non - zero binding energy , whereas in non - dipolar media they always repel and never form stable bound state .",
    "the possibility of molecular type of interaction between solitons in dipolar bec moving in two neighboring wave - guides was shown in @xcite .",
    "the existence of stable multi - soliton structures in 2d dipolar bec was also reported in @xcite .",
    "our main objective in this work is to find the conditions when two interacting solitons in the same quasi-1d waveguide form a stable bound state , which can be considered as a basic matter - wave soliton molecule .",
    "when a stable bound state of two solitons has been realized , we characterize the soliton molecule by its bond length and binding energy .",
    "our work distinguishes itself from other relevant publications in that , we use the va with a gauss - hermite ansatz and analytically tractable function of non - locality ( response function ) , which allows to describe essential features of soliton molecules in dipolar bec .",
    "moreover , we provide detailed comparison of predictions of va with the results of numerical simulations of the gross - pitaevskii equation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "ii we introduce the governing equation and develop the va for the dynamics of soliton molecules in dipolar bec . in sec .",

    "similarity of the basic equations has been fruitful in transferring many ideas from nonlinear optics to the field of matter - waves @xcite . in this paper",
    "we transfer one more idea , concerning soliton interactions , from the field of fiber optics into the field of bec .",
