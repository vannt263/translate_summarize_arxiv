    "<S> the optical conductivity [ @xmath0 spectra of alkaline - earth - filled skutterudites with the chemical formula @xmath1sb@xmath2 ( @xmath3  =  sr , ba , @xmath4  =  fe , ru , os ) and a reference material la@xmath5fe@xmath6sb@xmath2 were obtained and compared with the corresponding band structure calculations and with calculated @xmath7 spectra to investigate their electronic structures . at high temperatures , the energy of the plasma edge decreased with the increasing valence of the guest atoms @xmath3 in the fe@xmath6sb@xmath2 cage indicating hole - type conduction . </S>",
    "<S> a narrow peak with a pseudogap of 25  mev was observed in srfe@xmath6sb@xmath2 , while the corresponding peak were located at 200 and 100  mev in the ru- and os - counterparts , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the order of the peak energy in these compounds is consistent with the thermodynamical properties in which the os - compound is located between the fe- and ru - compounds . </S>",
    "<S> this indicated that the electronic structure observed in the infrared @xmath7 spectra directly affects the thermodynamical properties . </S>",
    "<S> the band structure calculation implies the different electronic structure among these compounds originates from the different @xmath8 states of the @xmath4 ions . </S>"
