    "from detailed observations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite , the large scale structure ( lss ) of galaxies @xcite , and distant type ia supernovae ( sni - a ) @xcite many of the fundamental cosmological parameters are known quite precisely . very interestingly",
    "the precision of the data is now also at a level where particle physics beyond the standard model can be probed .",
    "one of the prime examples of this is the total cosmological energy density in relativistic particles .    in the standard model photons and neutrinos are by far the largest source of entropy in the universe ( and consequently also of energy density in the early universe ) , and neutrinos are therefore the largest source of entropy in non - electromagnetically interacting species",
    ".    in the early universe neutrinos decouple at a temperature of roughly 2 - 3 mev . shortly after this , electrons and positrons annihilate and transfer entropy to the photons .",
    "the end result is that the temperature of neutrinos is roughly @xmath5 .",
    "the total energy density in weakly interacting relativistic species is therefore @xmath6 .",
    "any additional relativistic energy density can be thought of as additional neutrinos , and from the perspective of late time evolution after neutrino decoupling it is customary to parameterize any such additional energy density in terms of @xmath3 @xcite , the equivalent number of neutrino species @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the density in a massless standard model neutrino species which has a temperature of exactly @xmath9 .",
    "the value predicted by the standard model is actually @xmath10 because of finite - temperature qed effects and incomplete neutrino decoupling ( see for instance @xcite for a review or @xcite for a very recent study ) .    in general , a species , @xmath11 , decoupling from thermal equilibrium while relativistic contributes an @xmath12 given by ( see for instance @xcite ) @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the number of helicity states of the species and @xmath15 is the effective number of degrees of freedom in the plasma at the time of @xmath11-decoupling .",
    "in the present paper we calculate cosmological constraints on @xmath3 from presently available data . in the past",
    "the main source for constraints on @xmath3 has been big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) .",
    "however , recently observations of the cmb , lss , and distant type ia supernovae have reached a precision where they can be used to constrain @xmath3 at a competitive level @xcite . here",
    "we perform a detailed and updated calculation of cmb , lss , and sni - a constraints on @xmath3 and compare them with present bbn constraints . in section 2 we discuss present observational constraints , and section 3 contains a discussion .",
    "using the presently available precision data we have performed a likelihood analysis for the relativistic energy density , parameterized in units of the effective number of neutrino species , @xmath3 .",
    "we assume the relativistic energy density to be distributed in @xmath3 light majorana fermion species , each with mass @xmath16 .",
    "the standard case with 3 very light neutrino species plus possible additional relativistic species just corresponds to taking @xmath17 .",
    "the reason why @xmath16 is allowed to be different from 0 is that there is a well - known degeneracy between @xmath16 and @xmath3 in cmb and lss data @xcite .    as our framework",
    "we choose a flat dark energy model with the following free parameters : @xmath18 , the matter density , the curvature parameter , @xmath19 , the baryon density , @xmath20 , the dark energy equation of state , @xmath21 , the hubble parameter , @xmath22 , the spectral index of the initial power spectrum , and @xmath23 , the optical depth to reionization . the normalization of both cmb and lss spectra are taken to be free and unrelated parameters .",
    "the dark energy density is given by the flatness condition @xmath24 .",
    "the priors we use are given in table  [ table : priors ] .",
    "the prior on the hubble constant comes from the hst hubble key project value of @xmath25 @xcite , where @xmath26 .",
    "lcl parameter & prior@xmath27&1&fixed@xmath28 & @xmath29&gaussian @xcite@xmath30 & 0.0140.040&top hat@xmath16 & 0  5 ev & top hat @xmath31 & -2.5  -0.5 & top hat @xmath22 & 0.61.4 & top hat@xmath23 & 01 & top hat@xmath32 &  & free@xmath33 &  & free    likelihoods are calculated from @xmath34 so that in 2-dimensional plots the 68% and 95% regions are formally defined by @xmath35 and 6.17 respectively .",
    "note that this means that the 68% and 95% contours are not necessarily equivalent to the same confidence level for single parameter estimates .",
    "in 1-dimensional plots the same formal confidence levels are given by @xmath36 and 4 .",
    "we perform our likelihood analysis using the `` gold '' dataset compiled and described in riess et al @xcite consisting of 157 supernovae using a modified version of the snoc package @xcite .",
    "any large scale structure survey measures the correlation function between galaxies . in the linear regime where fluctuations are gaussian the fluctuations can be described by the galaxy - galaxy power spectrum alone , @xmath37 .",
    "in general the the galaxy - galaxy power spectrum is related to the matter power spectrum via a bias parameter , @xmath38 . in the linear regime ,",
    "the bias parameter is approximately constant , so up to a normalization constant @xmath39 does measure the matter power spectrum .    at present",
    "there are two large galaxy surveys of comparable size , the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite and the 2dfgrs ( 2  degree field galaxy redshift survey ) @xcite .",
    "once the sdss is completed in 2005 it will be significantly larger and more accurate than the 2dfgrs . in the present analysis we use data from both surveys . in the data analysis we use only data points on scales larger than @xmath40/mpc in order to avoid problems with non - linearity .",
    "the temperature fluctuations are conveniently described in terms of the spherical harmonics power spectrum @xmath41 .",
    "since thomson scattering polarizes light , there are also power spectra coming from the polarization .",
    "the polarization can be divided into a curl - free @xmath42 and a curl @xmath43 component , yielding four independent power spectra : @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and the @xmath47-@xmath48 cross - correlation @xmath49 .",
    "the wmap experiment has reported data on @xmath44 and @xmath49 as described in refs .",
    "we have performed our likelihood analysis using the prescription given by the wmap collaboration  @xcite which includes the correlation between different @xmath50 s .",
    "foreground contamination has already been subtracted from their published data .",
    "we furthermore use the newly published results from the boomerang experiment @xcite which has measured significantly smaller scales than wmap .      in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we show the results of the likelihood analysis for all the currently available data . as with previous analyses which include wmap data the best fit is higher than @xmath51 , but with @xmath51 well within the 95% contour . in terms of @xmath3",
    "the formal allowed region is @xmath52 this can be compared with the previous limit of @xcite @xmath53 it is quite interesting to compare these limits .",
    "the parameter space used in the present analysis is larger ( taking @xmath20 as a free parameter ) , but also uses newer data ( the riess et al .",
    "sni - a data and the boomerang data ) .",
    "the new data significantly strengthens the constraint and clearly the severe degeneracy between @xmath20 and @xmath16 which affects the neutrino mass bound @xcite has no significant impact on the determination of @xmath3 .",
    "interestingly the value @xmath1 is excluded at @xmath54 , confirming the presence of a cosmological background of relativistic particles .",
    "however , at present observations are not precise enough to determine the exact nature of the relativistic background , such as whether it is of fermionic or bosonic nature .",
    "other studies have shown that the relativistic background must be weakly interacting around the epoch of recombination @xcite . at present",
    "all observations are therefore compatible with standard model neutrinos as the only non - electromagnetically interacting relativistic background , but can not definitively rule out a background of other light particles .",
    "in order to compare with the previous analysis , we also show @xmath34 for an analysis with only wmap and lss data , but keeping @xmath55 .",
    "the 95% allowed region is in that case @xmath56 , in very good agreement with fig .",
    "2b in @xcite .",
    "1 shows the quite significant improvement from including the new boomerang and sni - a data .",
    "= 8truecm      the other main probe of relativistic energy density in the early universe is big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) .",
    "it is therefore highly interesting to compare the bbn inferred values of @xmath30 and @xmath3 in order to check consistency .    at present",
    "the measured primordial helium-4 abundance is quite uncertain ( see for instance @xcite for a recent discussion ) .",
    "one of the most recent determinations is @xcite @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the @xmath59he mass fraction .",
    "however , the systematic uncertainty in the measurement is almost certainly larger than this .",
    "the primordial deuterium fraction is fairly well measured in high redshift absorption systems .",
    "we use the value @xcite .",
    "@xcite . evidently the uncertainty in the primordial deuterium abundance may also have been underestimated . ]",
    "@xmath60    based on these values we have calculated the allowed region in @xmath61 space .",
    "the result is shown in fig .  2 .",
    "the bbn determination is clearly compatible with the cmb+lss+sni - a determination .",
    "very interestingly the uncertainty in @xmath3 from cmb+lss+sni - a is now comparable to what can be obtained from bbn . using the @xmath59he and d abundances quoted above cyburt et al .",
    "@xcite find that @xmath62 at 68% c.l .",
    "this yields a 95% bound on @xmath63 of roughly 1.4 , comparable to the present bound from cmb , lss , sni - a .",
    "= 8truecm      given the stringent constraint on @xmath30 and @xmath3 from cmb , lss , and sni - a data , it is worthwhile to consider the bound on the primordial @xmath59he value which can be derived from these data . at 95% c.l .",
    "the bound is @xmath64 this is entirely compatible with the value @xmath65 recently derived .",
    "however , the allowed region is significantly larger than the value of @xmath66 suggested a few years ago based on a large sample of low - metallicity systems @xcite . in fig .",
    "3 we show isocontours for @xmath59he as a function of @xmath30 and @xmath3 overlayed on the likelihood analyses .    it should be noted that the allowed region is much larger than the value quoted in @xcite , @xmath67 ( in a comparable study @xcite found @xmath68 \\pm 0.0004 \\ , [ { \\rm syst}]$ ] , assuming @xmath69 . ) .",
    "the reason is that this assumes a fixed value of @xmath51 and therefore only applies if light , standard model neutrinos is the only source of relativistic energy .",
    "= 8truecm    because the primordial helium abundance has a direct influence on recombination it is in principle also possible to measure @xmath58 from cmb data alone",
    ". however , at present the bound is not competitive ( @xcite found a presently allowed range of @xmath70 at 68% c.l . ) . with future data",
    "the helium determination from cmb alone will improve significantly and allow for one more important consistency check between bbn and cmb .",
    "we have calculated updated constraints on the cosmological background of relativistic particles from cmb , lss , and sni - a . in the present analysis ,",
    "a larger set of cosmological parameters has been used , as well as new cmb and sni - a data .",
    "we find , at the 95% c.l . that the bound on the relativistic energy density in terms of the effective number of neutrino species is @xmath71 .",
    "the precision of this bound is now comparable to , or better than , what can be found from big bang nucleosynthesis considerations .",
    "furthermore , the systematic uncertainties plaguing the determination of the primordial helium determination makes any exact bbn bound hard to obtain .",
    "the present data also shows evidence for a cosmological background of weakly interacting , relativistic energy density at the @xmath72 level , an important confirmation of the standard cosmological model .",
    "the uncertainty in @xmath63 has decreased from roughly 10 five years @xcite ago to about 1.5 at present , an impressive improvement on a very short timescale . within the next five years",
    "the measurement of @xmath3 from cmb data alone could reach the 0.1 precision level @xcite , indicating an improvement by two orders of magnitude in the span of a decade .",
    "i wish to thank pasquale serpico , gary steigman , and roberto trotta for valuable comments .",
    "use of the publicly available cmbfast package  @xcite and of computing resources at dcsc ( danish center for scientific computing ) are acknowledged .",
