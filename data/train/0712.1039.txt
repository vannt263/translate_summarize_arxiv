    "denote by @xmath7 the collection of bounded analytic functions on a plane domain @xmath8 .",
    "let us denote by @xmath9 the set of multiplicative linear functionals on @xmath7 , i.e. @xmath10 is the maximal ideal space of @xmath7 .",
    "when @xmath7 separates the points of @xmath8 , there is a natural identification of @xmath8 with a subset of @xmath8 through the functionals defined by pointwise evaluations .",
    "the corona problem for @xmath7 is to determine whether @xmath10 is the closure of @xmath8 in the gelfand topology .",
    "the problem can be stated more concretely as follows . given @xmath11 and @xmath12 such that @xmath13 for all @xmath14 , do there exist @xmath15 such that @xmath16 we call the functions @xmath17 corona data , and the functions @xmath18 corona solutions .",
    "it has been conjectured that this can be answered in the affirmative for any planar domain . in the case of riemann surfaces ,",
    "a counterexample was first found by brian cole ( see @xcite ) , other examples being found later by d. e. barrett and j. diller @xcite , however , this is due to a structure that in some sense makes the surface seem higher dimensional , so one might hope that the restriction to the riemann sphere might prevent this obstacle .",
    "this problem was first posed in the case of the unit disc @xmath19 by s. kakutani in 1941 , which case was solved by l. carleson @xcite in 1962 .",
    "it is from this origin that the problem gets its name , as there would have been a set of maximal ideals suggestive of the sun s corona has the theorem failed in this case .",
    "the proof was subsequently simplified by l. hrmander @xcite by use of a @xmath20-problem , and then later in an acclaimed proof by t. wolff ( see @xcite or @xcite ) . a quite different proof of this result using techniques from several complex variables was later developed by b. berndtsson and t. j. ransford @xcite and z. slodkowski @xcite . besides the intrinsic interest of this result in classical function theory , the proof of this result introduced a number of tools and ideas which have proven to be of great importance in analysis .    following the appearance of this result , it was swiftly generalized to the case of finitely connected domains , and by now a number of proofs exist for this case , e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . although any planar domain can be exhausted by a sequence of finitely connected domains , to solve the problem on the larger domain one must control the norms of the corona solutions , @xmath21 , in the approximating domains in order to take normal limits , control which is unfortunately not provided by any of the proofs just cited .",
    "the corona problem was first solved for a class of infinitely connected domains by m. behrens @xcite , @xcite .",
    "these are `` roadrunner '' domains @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is a disc centered at @xmath24 and radius @xmath25 such that @xmath26 this summability restriction was improved somewhat in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "behrens @xcite also proved that if the corona theorem fails for a plane domain then it fails for a domain of the form @xmath22 , where @xmath27 is a sequence of discs clustering only at the origin . in this direction",
    "there is also a result of gamelin @xcite that the corona problem is local in that it depends only on the behavior of the domain locally about each boundary point .",
    "the next significant progress for infinitely connected domains was again achieved by carleson @xcite , who solved the corona problem for domains having boundary @xmath28 satisfying , for some @xmath29 , @xmath30 for every @xmath31 and @xmath32 , where @xmath33 denotes one - dimensional hausdorff measure .",
    "this proof followed an idea introduced in @xcite , constructing an explicit projection from @xmath34 onto @xmath7 .",
    "following in the same vein , p. jones and d. marshall @xcite used such projections to show that if the corona problem can be solved at the critical points of green s function for the domain , then it can be solved for the domain , and they provided a number of sufficient conditions for this criterion .",
    "later j. garnett and p. jones @xcite extended the result of carleson @xcite , showing that the corona theorem holds for any domain having boundary contained in @xmath35 .",
    "this was later extended by c. moore @xcite to the case of domains with boundary contained in the graph of a @xmath36 function .    due to the results in @xcite ,",
    "the corona problem for a domain can be solved if the critical points of green s function ( for a fixed base point ) form an interpolating sequence for @xmath7 .",
    "however , it was shown by m. gonzalez @xcite that for a large class of domains , conditions necessary for the critical points to be an interpolating sequence might fail .",
    "peter jones ( unpublished ) has given an explicit example of a class of domains where the critical point of greens function fail to form an interpolating sequence , namely the complements of certain square cantor sets ( which we describe more explicitly below ) .    throughout the remainder of this work , @xmath8 will denote the complement of a square cantor set @xmath0 . to fix notation",
    ", we define @xmath0 explicitly as @xmath37 , where the @xmath38 are defined inductively as follows .",
    "fix @xmath39 , which we assume satisfies @xmath40 for simplicity .",
    "( these conditions also ensure that @xmath7 is nontrivial . )",
    "put @xmath41 ^ 2 $ ] . at stage @xmath3 , we set @xmath42 where @xmath43 are squares with sides parallel to the axes and side length @xmath44 , and @xmath45 is a multi - index of length @xmath46 on letters @xmath47 . at stage @xmath48 , we construct squares @xmath49 , @xmath50 , of side length @xmath51 with sides parallel to the axes such that each @xmath52 , @xmath53 , contains a corner of @xmath43 .",
    "we define @xmath54 .",
    "some auxiliary definitions are also useful in this setting .",
    "the first of these is the quantity @xmath55 , which represents the normalized gap width between squares of the @xmath3th generation having common parent .",
    "it is useful also to introduce the thickened squares @xmath56 , and from these the `` square annuli '' @xmath57 given by @xmath58 .",
    "we note that our constants were chosen so that @xmath59 is a single square concentric with and containing @xmath43 .",
    "that @xmath60 follows from the assumption that @xmath40 .",
    "let us denote by @xmath61 the center of the square @xmath43 .",
    "( see figure [ fig1 ] . )    for the harmonic measures below , we will generally make the abbreviations @xmath62 and @xmath63 or @xmath64 when there is no risk of confusion .",
    "we briefly sketch the proof of the result of jones .",
    "let us denote by @xmath65 the critical points of green s function @xmath66 for the domain @xmath8 . for @xmath65 to be an interpolating sequence ,",
    "it is necessary that the sum @xmath67 be finite . roughly speaking ,",
    "each square annulus @xmath57 contains one critical point , and @xmath68 is of the same size as @xmath69 ( up to a constant factor ) for @xmath70 when there are @xmath71 such that @xmath72 for every @xmath3 .",
    "thus by harnack s inequality the convergence of @xmath67 is equivalent to the convergence of @xmath73 .",
    "but @xmath74 , so @xmath65 can not be an interpolating sequence .",
    "if one takes slightly more care in comparing harmonic measure to green s function , this can be extended to show that @xmath75 is not an interpolating sequence when @xmath76 for large @xmath3 , where @xmath77 is some absolute constant .    in the other direction ,",
    "it has been shown by jones ( unpublished ) that the critical points of green s function form an interpolating sequence in the case that @xmath0 has positive area .",
    "( this occurs iff @xmath78 . )",
    "this can be done via the techniques of @xcite using harmonic measure estimates ( see theorems 4.1 and 4.5 of that paper ) , or , alternatively , by solving a @xmath20-problem .    in the present work ,",
    "we prove the following result .",
    "[ corthmdim2 ] if @xmath79 is a square cantor set with @xmath80 and @xmath81 satisfy @xmath82 then there are @xmath83 such that @xmath84 +    this extends the result past the regime where the critical points of green s function form an interpolating sequence .    the basic outline of the proof is as follows .",
    "we first break the domain into a number of simply connected domains @xmath85 which , roughly speaking , are the cross - shaped domains @xmath86 . the fundamental idea is that found in @xcite , namely to apply carleson s original theorem for simply connected domains and then constructively solve a @xmath20-problem to obtain corona solutions for the whole domain .    to obtain the necessary cancellations , however , we require that the corona solutions on our simply connected subdomains have a certain amount of agreement on the overlaps of those domains . to achieve this",
    ", we build these special solutions inductively , the solutions at stage @xmath3 obtained first by choosing solutions according to carleson s corona theorem for simply connected domains and then solving a @xmath20-problem to alter the solutions to match the neighboring solutions already constructed .",
    "the method for solving the @xmath20-problem is much like in @xcite , employing an interpolating sequence in the simply connected domains @xmath85 to build our solutions . for our solution to have the desired special properties , however , we must choose our interpolating functions to have certain special properties , and it is here that we need the condition that @xmath5 .",
    "section 3 is devoted to constructing these interpolating functions and solving the associated @xmath20-problem in our simply connected subdomains .",
    "once these solutions have been constructed we paste these solutions together by solving another @xmath20-problem . in this case",
    ", the @xmath20-problem is solved using the ideas of rational approximation theory ( see @xcite or chapter xii of@xcite ) .",
    "essentially , one solves the @xmath20-problem on the intersection of two subdomains by the usual cauchy integral representation , but in order to be able to sum these various pieces , we must add additional cancellation to each piece .",
    "this is done by subtracting a bounded analytic function on @xmath8 which has singular support on a portion of the cantor set nearby and which matches derivatives of the integral at infinity .",
    "schwarz lemma bounds , in conjunction with the cancellations from our special corona solutions in the subdomains , then allow us to sum the terms and obtain the solution to the @xmath20-problem .",
    "this part of the proof implicitly makes use of the fact that for any @xmath87 there is @xmath88 such that @xmath89 for @xmath90 $ ] , where @xmath91 denotes the analytic capacity of the set @xmath4 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this parallels the thickness condition for the boundary employed in @xcite .",
    "thus the functions introduced to obtain cancellations are polynomials in the extremal function for this problem , the ahlfor s function , for a piece of the boundary .",
    "alternatively , one can take the function to be powers of the cauchy integral of the uniform measure on an appropriate subsquare @xmath92 of the cantor set ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the present work is part of the author s ph.d",
    ". dissertation .",
    "the author is naturally greatly indebted to his advisor , john garnett , for many helpful conversations and suggestions over the years , and would like to take this opportunity to express his gratitude .",
    "the author would also like to thank peter jones for helpful conversations .",
    "to begin the proof , let us first define simply connected , cross - shaped regions @xmath85 by @xmath93 . for these regions",
    "we distinguish the four boundary segments , denoted @xmath94 , which do not lie on a side of a square @xmath52 , @xmath53 .",
    "let us then define lozenges @xmath95 where @xmath96 and @xmath97 is some angle less than @xmath98 to be determined by the constructions below .",
    "we now define regions @xmath99 ( see figure [ fig2 ] . )",
    "we note that these regions remain simply connected , so that carleson s corona theorem for the unit disc @xmath19 provides corona solutions @xmath100 corresponding to @xmath101 in @xmath102 .",
    "we note that @xmath103 .",
    "the most important result for the present construction is embodied in the following proposition .",
