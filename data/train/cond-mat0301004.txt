    "there are many mathematical models for epidemics [ 1 - 5 ] . generally , the population is classified into susceptible ( s ) , infected ( i ) and recovered ( r ) according to the state of each individual .",
    "the sirs model is proposed to describe the outbreaks of foot - and - mouth disease ( fmd ) [ 1 ] .",
    "the model is generalized to include latency , incubation and variable susceptibility [ 4 ] .",
    "they have studied phase transitions in these models .",
    "also it is shown that [ 5 ] a ring vaccination programme is capable of eradicating fmd in sirs model defined on small - world networks ( swn ) .",
    "the concept of swn [ 2,3 ] is proposed to describe some real social networks .",
    "therefore swn is used successfully to model several real systems [ 5 - 8 ] .",
    "here our aim is to study phase transitions in some modified versions of sirs model ( including inhomogeneous mixing , latency , incubation and variable susceptibility ) defined on swn .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , the concept of swn is explained .",
    "phase transitions in some sirs versions are studied in section 3 . in section 4 ,",
    "some generalized versions are discussed .",
    "some conclusions are summarized in section 5 .",
    "if one considers all human in the world are occupying the vertices of a network , this social network has to satisfy two main properties : clustering and small - world effect [ 9 ] .",
    "clustering means every one has a group of collaborators , some of them will often be a collaborator by another individual .",
    "small - world effect means the average shortest vertex - to - vertex distance , @xmath0 , is very short compared with the size of the network @xmath1 ( the total number of vertices ) .",
    "regular lattices display the clustering property , because its clustering coefficient is high .",
    "the clustering coefficient @xmath2 is defined as the average fraction of pairs of neighbors of a vertex which are also neighbors of each other .",
    "but regular lattices do not display the small - world effect , because the distance @xmath0 increases as @xmath3 in @xmath4 dimensions .",
    "for a random graph [ 10 ] with coordination number @xmath5 , the total number of vertices @xmath1 is given by    @xmath6 which gives ,    @xmath7    the logarithmic increase with @xmath1 allows the distance @xmath0 to be very short even for large @xmath1 . then random graphs display the small - world effect . but a random graph does not satisfy the clustering property , because its clustering coefficient is given by @xmath8 this quantity goes to zero for large @xmath1 .",
    "therefore both regular and random lattices are not good descriptions for social networks .",
    "a swn consists of a regular one - dimensional ( 1-d ) chain with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "each vertex is connected to its nearest - neighbors by bonds .",
    "some shortcutting bonds joining between some randomly chosen vertices with probability @xmath9 are added .",
    "the probability @xmath9 is supposed to be small in order to preserve the clustering property of the regular lattice .",
    "the small - world effect is concluded as follows : for very small lattice size @xmath1 , it is less probable to find a shortcut , so the system behaves like a regular lattice , and    @xmath10    when @xmath1 becomes large enough , more shortcuts are expected and the system behaves as a random lattice i.e.    @xmath11    consider this transition occurs at certain system size @xmath12 , then @xmath0 obeys a finite size scaling law as    @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a universal scaling function , such that    @xmath15    after some calculation using the renormalization group theory [ 9 ] , one gets    @xmath16 for 1-d and considering the first - nearest neighbors only ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) , and    @xmath19    for general @xmath20-distance - nearest neighbors and any @xmath4 . these forms are valid only for @xmath21 and @xmath22 . then for @xmath23 ,    @xmath24 then swn are shown to combine both properties of social networks .",
    "also this structure combines between both local and non local interactions which is observed in many real systems .",
    "therefore the concept of swn is used in modelling several real systems [ 5 - 8 ] . here",
    "our interest is restricted to apply the concept of swn to some epidemic models .",
    "the population is classified into three classes : susceptible , infected and recovered .",
    "consider a function @xmath25 represents the state of an individual @xmath26 at time @xmath27 , such that ,    @xmath28 the transitions between the states s , i and r occur according to the following automata rules :    1 .   infection : + if @xmath29 and ( @xmath30 or both @xmath31 ) , then @xmath32 with probability @xmath33",
    ". 2 .   recovery : @xmath34 3 .   losing immunity : @xmath35    this model is approximated by the following set of differential equations :    @xmath36    @xmath37    @xmath38    this set of differential equations is a mean field approximation that ignores the spatial structure of the lattice .",
    "it assumes a global interacting system .",
    "but in reality a disease spreads locally with some non local interactions . also including some epidemic aspects like lower susceptibility , incubation to the differential equations",
    "is very difficult .",
    "on the other hand , it is allowed in lattice models [ 4,5 ] .    to study the phase transition in this model , the probabilities @xmath33 and @xmath39 are varied from @xmath40 to @xmath41 by step @xmath42 .",
    "the phase diagram is drawn as a relation between @xmath33 and @xmath39 .",
    "there are two limiting points : the first is when @xmath43 corresponding to the case of perfect immunization , and it is close to ordinary percolation [ 11 ] . the second case is for @xmath44 representing the case of zero immunization , and this case is well described by directed percolation [ 12 ] . for intermediate values of @xmath39",
    ", there are no clear relation to the percolation theory .",
    "the phase diagram is similar to damage spreading transitions [ 13 ] , where two phases appear : epidemic and non epidemic .",
    "ahmed and agiza [ 4 ] have studied phase transitions in some modified versions of 1-d sirs model including inhomogeneous mixing , latency , incubation and variable susceptibility . here",
    "we will generalize their work to swn .",
    "the swn used here is a 1-d chain of size @xmath45 with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "shortcuts are fixed beforehand with probability @xmath46 per bond .",
    "the models evolve for @xmath47 time steps . we will study four different versions of sirs model separately .",
    "the first is the original sirs itself .",
    "the automata rules are generalized to include the shortcutting neighbors as follows :    1 .",
    "infection : if @xmath29 and @xmath48 or @xmath49 ( if exists ) , at least @xmath31 ) , then @xmath32 with probability @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the shortcutting neighbor of the @xmath26-th individual ( if exists ) .",
    "rules for both recovery and losing immunity are the same as the original model . the phase diagram is shown in fig .",
    "it appears that an epidemic phase occurs at @xmath52 .",
    "this value is slightly less than that observed from the 1-d original model .    in some cases ,",
    "an infection does not spread directly , but it needs some time and suitable conditions to be transmitted . in order to model this phenomenon , the population is classified into four states : susceptible , infected , recovered and lower susceptible .",
    "then the state function is modified to :",
    "@xmath53    a lower susceptible individual has immunity greater than a susceptible individual ; but smaller than a recovered one .",
    "the model is defined on swn .",
    "consider @xmath54 of the population have a lower susceptibility .",
    "both infection and recovery rules are the same as in the first case .",
    "the other rules are modified to :    1 .",
    "losing immunity : if @xmath55 , then with probability @xmath56 @xmath57 2 .",
    "susceptibility : + if @xmath58 and @xmath59 or @xmath49 ( if exists ) , at least @xmath31 ) , then @xmath60 .",
    "the phase diagram is given in fig .",
    "2 . the epidemic phase occurs at @xmath61 .",
    "the epidemic region is smaller than that of the first case , because of the assumption that @xmath54 of the population are not infected directly .    the third case , in some infectious diseases , a diseased individual can be infecting but symptoms do nt appear ( incubation state ) .",
    "on the other hand , an infected individual may not be infecting but still has the symptoms ( i.e. latent state ) . this case",
    "is called incubation - latent model .",
    "we define this model on swn as follows : the state function is modified to :",
    "@xmath62    the rule of losing immunity is the same as in the original model ; but the other rules are modified as follows :",
    "incubation : + if @xmath29 and ( @xmath30 or @xmath49 ( if exists ) , at least @xmath63 ) , then @xmath64 with probability @xmath33 .",
    "2 .   recovery : + if @xmath65 , then @xmath66 .",
    "latency : + if @xmath67 , then @xmath68 .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "3 , the epidemic region extended again with @xmath52 . this case is similar but not identical to first case .",
    "fourth , an incubation both sick and infecting model is introduced . in some diseases like aids ,",
    "a diseased person is sick and infecting , so this model is called an incubation both sick and infecting model .",
    "the state function @xmath25 is defined as follows :    @xmath69    the model is defined on swn , and the automata rules become :    1 .   incubation : + if @xmath29 and @xmath70 ; @xmath71 or @xmath72 ( if exists ) , at least ) , then @xmath64 with probability @xmath33 .",
    "sick - infected : + if @xmath67 , then @xmath32 .    rules for both recovery and losing immunity are the same as in the original model . the phase diagram is shown in fig .",
    "4 , the epidemic phase occurs at @xmath73 .",
    "the epidemic region is extended more than the previous cases , because infection is expected from both sick - infected and incubation individuals .",
    "sometimes an infection is transmitted to some distant neighbors in addition to the nearest neighbors .",
    "this interaction with the distant neighbors is modelled by generalizing the automata rules , discussed in the previous section , to include distant neighbors at a distance @xmath20 .",
    "this means @xmath18 gives the first - nearest neighbors , @xmath74 gives the second - nearest neighbors in addition to the first - nearest neighbors , and so on .",
    "the case @xmath74 is studied for the four cases , and the results are summarized in table 1 .",
    "the epidemic phase increased significantly in the four cases .",
    "this is expected , because the infection spreads faster than in the case of @xmath18 .",
    "generally , every individual has his / her own immune system that differs significantly from the others .",
    "thus the susceptibility also differs from one to another .",
    "also , in some cases the probability of infection depends on the number of infected neighbors . to model this behavior , a modified probability of infection",
    "is considered . if @xmath33 is the probability of infection due to one infected nearest neighbor , then @xmath75 @xmath76 is the probability of noninfection due to @xmath77 infected nearest neighbors .",
    "then the modified probability of infection [ 14 ] is    @xmath78    per unit of time . beside the advantages of this form",
    ", it also implies that the probability of infection for each individual is not constant with time .",
    "using @xmath79 instead of @xmath33 is introducing inhomogeneity that is one of the main aspects in reality .",
    "inhomogeneous models are constructed for the four cases studied in the previous section .",
    "the same conditions are applied .",
    "the results are close to that of the models in swn , but there are slight differences from the results of the 1-d models . a comparison between the results of regular lattice , swn with @xmath18 , swn with @xmath74 and the inhomogeneous models is given in table 1 .        [ cols=\"^ \" , ]      + case 1 & 0.68 & 0.61 & 0.38 & 0.60 + case 2 & 0.80 & 0.71 & 0.43 & 0.74 + case 3 & 0.67 & 0.61 & 0.40 & 0.59 + case 4 & 0.47 & 0.41 & 0.24 & 0.40 +    table 1 : the critical value @xmath80 at which the phase transition occurs for all the studied models .",
    "phase transitions in some modified versions of sirs model for epidemics are studied using swn with both @xmath18 and @xmath74 . also , inhomogeneous models are introduced . only the case of @xmath74",
    "is found to significantly affect the phase transitions in all models .",
    "just slight changes are found in the other cases.**acknowledgements**we thank e. ahmed for helpful discussions ."
