    "the understanding and the control of the nanostructure magnetic properties is a challenging field of research , for both fundamental and applied physics . at the nanoscale ,",
    "finite size effects and surface contributions become dominant and lead to a modification of the properties as compared to the bulk , such as the enhancement of the orbital magnetic moment and of the magnetic anisotropy energy ( mae ) at the less coordinated atoms.@xcite however , technological applications of such structures for ultrahigh density magnetic storage media are limited by thermal fluctuations of the magnetization direction . to overcome this so - called superparamagnetic limit ,",
    "intense efforts are devoted to the investigation of materials with a high mae .",
    "in such a view fept@xcite and copt  @xcite have become some of the most studied materials as they display a very large magnetocrystalline anisotropy ( over @xmath3  j / m@xmath1 ) when ordered in the l1@xmath2  phase .",
    "the effect of the l1@xmath2  ordering in fept and copt on the magnetic anisotropy in bulk crystals or thin films has been widely studied on both experimental and theoretical points of view.@xcite in the case of nanostructures , as the surface modifies the local chemical environment , it is expected to have potentially a large impact on the mae .",
    "although many experimental studies had been performed@xcite , it is only recently that a clear impact of the dimension reduction on the mae has been experimentally evidenced for copt nanoparticles.@xcite by using model samples , and combining various techniques , the authors have indeed been able to reliably determine the mae of copt clusters with a diameter around 3  nm : while the anisotropy of chemically disordered particles was found to be higher than that of the bulk phase , it was the opposite for chemically ordered particles .    in this paper",
    ", we use an extension of the phenomenological anisotropy model of nel to investigate the effect of chemical ordering and size reduction in both fept and copt clusters .",
    "we first show that this simple model is in good agreement with bulk and thin film results .",
    "then , taking advantage of its simplicity , which allows us to perform an extensive study of fept and copt nanoparticles , we use this model to investigate the mae of clusters . taking into account finite size effects by mean of a statistical analysis on a large number of nanostructures",
    ", we demonstrate the impact of l1@xmath2  chemical ordering on the mae and show how the surface and the finite size modify the results as compared to the bulk .",
    "contrary to the results on pure fe and co clusters@xcite , here the surface induces a lowering of the mae for l1@xmath2  ordered clusters .    using a simple phenomenological pair - interaction model to calculate an effect as subtle as the magnetic anisotropy may seem a quite hazardous approach as compared to more elaborate models , like ab - initio calculations",
    "it is indeed well known that a theoretical determination of the mae is a hard task : because it corresponds to very slight variations in the total energy as a function of the magnetization direction , highly converged results are required .",
    "moreover , there is nowadays no available derivation of the nel model from first principles .",
    "nevertheless , this model , which is based on symmetries , has been found to be in good agreement with experiments on magnetic nanostructures@xcite . in particular",
    "it can remarkably well account for the prevailing effect of low - coordinated atoms on the mae .",
    "this let us think that this empirical model must be valid to a certain point , and that it can give reliable tendencies regarding the evolution of the mae in nanostructures with various parameters ( size , shape , configuration ... ) .",
    "besides , let us note that a nel expression for the local anisotropy is also used in atomic scale magnetic simulations based on a heisenberg - type model.@xcite . unfortunately , even it can be quite successfully compared to some ab - initio calculations and experiments ( see further in the paper ) , we can not _ demonstrate _ the validity of the nel model in the precise case under study : there is indeed no available ab - initio calculations of the mae for comparable copt or fept nanoparticles .",
    "however , in order to study the effect of size reduction and of chemical ordering in particles of a few nanometers ( which is precisely the size of interest for ultra - high density magnetic storage applications ) , there is no other method that can reasonably be used , and that would be more precise .",
    "we are then convinced that investigating such complex systems , which are out of reach for first - principle calculations for the moment , will give valuable physical insights . knowing the results predicted by this simple and crude model",
    "will then enable further comparison with more advanced calculations in the future .",
    "it is also important to check if the predictions of the nel model are correct in the case of alloy nanoparticles , and we hope that our work will stimulate experimental studies .",
    "the magnetocrystalline anisotropy ( mca ) arises from the coupling of the magnetization with the crystal lattice through the spin - orbit interaction@xcite . then , for a given magnetic atom , it is directly linked to its local environment . for a whole structure ,",
    "it is the signature of the system symmetries .",
    "it can be described using a phenomenological pair model , first introduced by l. nel@xcite . in its original form , for a single element crystal",
    ", the mca energy is written as a pair interaction over the first neighbors .",
    "the magnetic anisotropy energy of a dimer is expressed , using the lowest order term as  @xcite @xmath4    where @xmath5 is the magnetization unit vector and @xmath6 the unit vector along the bond .",
    "the prefactor @xmath7 is the anisotropy parameter , which has to be determined and is generally fitted on bulk experiments .    to consider a given structure , we need two more hypothesis .",
    "first we suppose that the magnetization direction is homogeneous over the whole structure ( macrospin approximation ) , which is a quite suitable approximation for nanostructures with dimensions close to the exchange length.@xcite second , we also suppose that the @xmath7 parameter is the same in the bulk and at the cluster surface , and can be extracted from bulk measurements .",
    "even if one could envisage a variation of the anisotropy parameter with the different environment in a structure , in fact the crude model of nel with a uniform @xmath7 extracted from bulk measurements has already shown a good agreement ( qualitative at least but also quantitative ) for such systems.@xcite as the purpose of our study is the prediction of the main tendencies , we will make this assumption in order to restrict the number of parameters in the model . on the basis of these two hypothesis , the total mca energy , @xmath8 ,",
    "is evaluated by performing a sum over all the nearest neighbor pairs .",
    "this leads to a quadratic form , that can be diagonalized into the orthonormal basis set @xmath9 .",
    "the normalization condition on @xmath5 further simplifies the expression to a biaxial form @xmath10    where @xmath11 is the volume of the structure , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are positive constants and @xmath14 a constant that can be omitted . note that , in general cases , the new basis is different from the one defining the atomic lattice .",
    "the direction @xmath15 ( respectively @xmath16 ) corresponds to the easy ( respectively hard ) magnetization direction , with the anisotropy constant @xmath12 ( respectively @xmath13 ) .",
    "this shows that this model , which is limited to second degree terms in @xmath5 , always leads to a biaxial second order magnetic anisotropy displaying two degenerated energy minima . at the equilibrium ( at zero temperature )",
    ", the magnetization lies along @xmath15 and @xmath17 corresponds to the minimum energy needed to switch the magnetization from one minimum to the other one .",
    "note that the value of @xmath13 does not influence this switching energy . for a bulk cubic crystal",
    ", this model would give a zero anisotropy , as the second order expression is not compatible with the cubic symmetry ( for a more accurate description of the mca in this case , one should use higher order terms in eq .",
    "[ eq1 ] , see ref . ) .",
    "however , this crude model is suitable to describe surface anisotropy where the cubic symmetry is locally broken .    to extend this model to an alloy containing two types of atom , named @xmath18 and @xmath19 in the following",
    ", three types of neighbor pair have to be considered:@xcite two between identical atoms and one between @xmath18 and @xmath19 atoms .",
    "we introduce three different anisotropy parameters : @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 respectively for @xmath18-@xmath18 , @xmath19-@xmath19 and @xmath18-@xmath19 pairs .",
    "the mca energy is then evaluated by summing eq .",
    "[ eq1 ] over all the nearest neighbors pairs , taking into account the chemical nature of the two atoms .",
    "this model allows us to describe the effect of l1@xmath2  chemical ordering on the mca .",
    "neglecting any tetragonal distortion , the atomic site lattice considered is face centered cubic ( fcc ) , and we focus on equiatomic alloys . in this case",
    ", the l1@xmath2  phase corresponds to an alternation of pure @xmath18 and pure @xmath19 planes in the [ 001 ] direction , leading to a chemical anisotropy along the @xmath23  axis .",
    "oppositely , in the chemically disordered phase named a1 , the atoms are randomly distributed on the lattice sites .",
    "the magnitude of the chemical order is usually quantified by the long - range order ( lro ) parameter @xmath24 , which varies between 0 ( totally disordered alloy ) and 1 ( perfectly ordered alloy)@xcite . defining two sublattices labelled @xmath25 and @xmath26 , corresponding to successive planes in the [ 001 ] direction , @xmath24 is given by @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the fraction of @xmath25 sites occupied by atoms @xmath18 . note that changing the sign of @xmath24 is equivalent to inverting the convention for the choice of the @xmath25 and @xmath26 planes . as this convention is arbitrary",
    ", the sign is meaningless and only the absolute value of @xmath24 has to be considered .",
    "conversely , the probability @xmath29 for each lattice site to be occupied by an atom of the correct type ( @xmath18 in a @xmath25 plane and @xmath19 in a @xmath26 plane ) is directly related to @xmath24 as @xmath30 . to calculate the mca of a bulk crystal of given order parameter",
    ", we consider the probability for a nearest neighbors pair to be a @xmath18-@xmath18 , @xmath19-@xmath19 or @xmath18-@xmath19 bond and we calculate its average magnetic anisotropy parameter @xmath31 .",
    "three different nearest neighbors pairs with equivalent @xmath32 are obtained : those lying in the @xmath25 planes , those lying in the @xmath26 planes and those linking atoms from two different planes .",
    "the corresponding @xmath32 parameters are respectively @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 : @xmath36l_{ab}.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    for a chemically disordered crystal ( @xmath37 ) , the probability to have a @xmath18 or @xmath19 atom on a given site is identical , and @xmath38 : the cubic symmetry is recovered and the mca is zero . as soon as a chemical order arises in the crystal ( @xmath39 ) , the cubic symmetry is broken and the second order mca term has a finite value . summing the different bond contributions in a fcc unit cell of volume @xmath40 ,",
    "the mae is obtained as @xmath41    with @xmath42 the unit vector aligned along the @xmath23 axis of the crystal .",
    "it corresponds to a uniaxial anisotropy , along the [ 001 ] direction ( @xmath23 axis ) , and coincides with the chemical anisotropy direction .",
    "the anisotropy constant for the bulk alloy is then given by @xmath43    and has a simple quadratic form . this evolution can be understood looking back at our model : as a pair interaction is considered , the model involves products of the occupation probabilities for a given site , which are linear in @xmath24 . if @xmath44 , the anisotropy constant is positive , meaning that the @xmath23 axis is the easy magnetization axis with the anisotropy constant @xmath45 .",
    "we now apply this model to the case of xpt crystals , where @xmath46 or co. in these alloys , a strong second order mca accompanies the chemical ordering into the l1@xmath2  phase , and originates both from a local chemical environment change and from a tetragonal distortion of the fcc lattice .",
    "however , this slight deformation has a much weaker influence on the mca@xcite and we neglect it in the following , as it was supposed in the previous development . in order to apply our model",
    ", we need to determine the parameters @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "as the magnetic moment on the pt atoms is small in these crystals  @xcite , we neglect the magnetic anisotropy of the pt - pt bonds by taking @xmath50 .",
    "a straightforward relation is then obtained between @xmath47 and @xmath49 by fitting equation [ eq : k(s ) ] on the experimental mae value of the l1@xmath2  ordered crystal .",
    "consequently , there only remains one adjustable parameter and we finally estimate @xmath47 from measurements on pure samples using the original nel model  @xcite : taking into account the magnetostriction parameters , the model gives @xmath51 , where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are respectively the bond lengths in the alloy and in the pure crystal .",
    "we have determined the parameters for both fept and copt ( see table  [ tab : parameters ] ) .",
    "the @xmath47 parameter for @xmath46 and has been calculated using the values given in ref .",
    "@xcite and a bond length of respectively 2.72    for fe and 2.71    for co.    .parameters @xmath47 and @xmath49 of the nel model for fept and copt , determined as explained in the text from the l1@xmath2  ordered bulk mae and the bulk fe and co nel model parameters@xcite . [ cols= \"",
    "< , > , > , > \" , ]     the predictions of the empirical nel model can be of great help to analyze experimental magnetic measurements . indeed , according to the present results",
    ", we can expect the chemically disordered particles to have a quite high anisotropy ( much higher than that of the bulk phase ) , whereas it should be in fact impossible to obtain small chemically ordered nanoparticles having an intrinsic mca as high as that of the bulk l1@xmath2  phase .",
    "this is consistent with our very recent experimental findings on copt nanoparticles.@xcite in addition , our calculations show that the anisotropy constant is falling off rapidly when a particle is not fully ordered , which could also be responsible of the experimental observation of a lower mae than expected .",
    "this point may be particularly relevant , since it is predicted that the most favorable configurations for small particles correspond to @xmath54.@xcite we emphasize that the results reported in this paper have been obtained by completely letting aside any energetic consideration for the various chemical arrangements .",
    "nevertheless , our model could easily be combined with a structural optimization method , either to determine the mae of a few particular structures predicted to be the most stable ones , or to determine the mae distribution of a statistical ensemble of structures , taking into account their probability of existence .",
    "another interesting feature predicted by our model is the significant mae distribution , even for a given particle size and a fixed chemical order parameter , which is due to the existence of a statistical set of chemical configurations . as discussed elsewhere,@xcite",
    "this can be one of the major source of mae distribution in realistic assemblies of clusters ( with a distribution of composition , size , shape ... ) .",
    "this feature , which is a particularity of magnetic alloys , should be directly visible in experimental measurements on well - defined samples .",
    "in this study , we have extended the anisotropy model of nel@xcite to describe the magnetocrystalline anisotropy in mixed fept and copt crystals .",
    "this phenomenological model allows us to describe the effect of l1@xmath2  ordering on the mca and appears to be in good agreement with previously reported results on bulk and thin films .",
    "we have used this model to investigate the specific modifications occurring in nanosized clusters of fept and copt with a truncated octahedron shape . in chemically disordered clusters",
    ", we have shown that there always exists a partial chemical order , due to the small number of atoms , and that , oppositely to the bulk , the mca is non zero . on the contrary , for l1@xmath2  ordered clusters , we have shown that surface induces a strong diminution of the magnetic anisotropy , due to the broken l1@xmath2  periodicity at the cluster surface .",
    "our finding points a lack in this type of ordered alloys as materials for high - density magnetic storage applications , where a high switching energy @xmath55 is needed to stabilize the magnetization direction . in pure or chemically disordered clusters , the anisotropy constant increases when the size decreases , thanks to a positive surface mae ( see e.g. ref .  ) , which attenuates the size variation of the switching energy . on the contrary , in the l1@xmath2  ordered copt and fept clusters , @xmath56 decreases when the size decreases due to the negative surface mae , which worthen the size variation of the switching energy . here , surface is a drawback that may be compensated by playing on appropriate surface effects . changing the surface anisotropy sign",
    "could be achieved using the high interface magnetic anisotropy that adds to surface magnetic anisotropy when the cluster surface is in contact with an appropriate non ferromagnetic material , like pt@xcite or coo@xcite .",
    "surface engineering , by embedding the clusters in the matrix or by synthesizing core - shell clusters with the non ferromagnetic shell around the magnetic core , appears to be complementary approaches to these l1@xmath2  ordered materials , in order to overcome the superparamagnetic limit in nanoscale clusters ."
