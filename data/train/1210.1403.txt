    "understanding light - matter interactions and mechanisms of light generation are of vital importance in elucidating many physical processes . while for most processes , a combination of a statistical approach along with maxwell s classical theory of electromagnetism suffices , several optical processes demand a quantum mechanical approach to the electromagnetic field@xcite .",
    "the quantum theory of light makes a clear distinction between different sources of radiation such as coherent , thermal , and single photon sources@xcite .",
    "radiation from the former two sources may be explained classically , while light from the latter can only be explained quantum mechanically . in other words ,",
    "the former two states are deemed classical , and the latter non - classical . due to their quantum nature ,",
    "non - classical sources of light display several counter - intuitive features evoking considerable interest in them .",
    "non - classical sources of light have been generated experimentally by several techniques@xcite and their possible applications in different fields , especially quantum information , are well explored@xcite .",
    "however , recent years have witnessed an emergence of interest in _ classical _ sources of light @xcite-@xcite these have been used in intriguing applications like ghost imaging@xcite-@xcite , and interferometry based experiments as in refs.@xcite , and have also formed an ingredient in the creation of non - classical states of light@xcite .    in this paper we demonstrate a method of creating classical incoherent light sources that can be tailored to mimic light from a thermal source or can be made to emit light quite distinct from that emitted by natural light sources .",
    "utilizing the fact that an acousto - optic modulator ( aom ) may be effectively used to introduce phase and intensity fluctuations to light rapidly and accurately@xcite , we create incoherent light having the desired coherence times and intensity statistics , or photon - number distributions , from input coherent light .",
    "the motivations for creating such sources are several .",
    "this technique offers an alternative to the current standard method of using a rotating ground glass plate@xcite to generate pseudo - thermal light .",
    "further , the electronic control of fluctuations provides a robust and flexible procedure for producing tailored classical light sources with predetermined photon emission rates .",
    "several interesting applications now become possible . for example , it is known that non - classical states can be generated by combining classical light , both coherent and thermal , with single photons ( fock state ) in photon addition experiments@xcite-@xcite , @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the ability to tailor classical states of light to have gaussian or non - gaussian photon number distributions as demonstrated in this paper , widens the field of generation of non - classical states of light by making many novel forms possible .",
    "in addition , classical non - gaussian states with tailored photon number distributions ( pnd ) may , in turn , be used to produce states with tailored non - gaussian entanglement .",
    "this is of importance in the quantum information theoretic context , where recent findings suggest non - gaussian entanglement to be advantageous over gaussian entanglement@xcite .",
    "this paper is arranged as follows . the experimental setup used in this study",
    "is described in section @xmath1 .",
    "section 3 describes the methodology for the generation of classical incoherent light with tunable temporal coherence .",
    "this is achieved by imparting random phase shifts to coherent light through the acousto - optic interaction , in a mach - zehnder interferometer ( mzi ) .",
    "measurements of the second - order correlation function , @xmath0 , both using a classical photodetector ( intensity - intensity correlation ) and photon counting detector ( photon coincidence detection ) , show the tunability of temporal characteristics , and the equivalence of the two forms of detection . in section 4 , we generate classical light sources with the desired pnds introducing intensity fluctuations to light by suitably modulating the diffraction efficiency of the acousto - optic modulator ( aom ) .",
    "two incoherent states , one thermal and the other a classical non - gaussian state were created as illustrative examples . in section @xmath2 we discuss the possible use of such tailored classical non - gaussian state in producing tailored non - classical states and non - gaussian entanglement .",
    "section @xmath3 summarizes the work presented in this paper .",
    "the schematic of the experiment is given in fig .",
    "1 . coherent cw laser light from an external cavity diode laser ( toptica , 767 nm , linewidth @xmath4 mhz ) was fiber coupled through a single mode polarization maintaining fiber .",
    "the light was then passed through a variable neutral density filter ( vndf ) ( to control the intensity of the beam ) onto beam splitter bs1 where it was amplitude divided into two parts .",
    "these two beams traversed along the two arms of a mach - zehnder interferometer ( mzi ) , which had an aom in each of the two arms , arranged such that the first order diffracted light proceeded further on , while the undiffracted light was blocked . after traversing the two arms of the interferometer , the beams were combined at bs2 , that is , the diffracted light beams of the two arms of the mzi interfered at bs2 .",
    "light emerging from one of the exit ports of bs2 was directed into an input of a 50:50 fiber - splitter , and then onto two detectors , d1 and d2 .",
    "the two aoms were driven by individual versatile function generators ( vfg , toptica ) which operated at 80 mhz radio frequency ( rf ) ; they were both referenced to a common 10mhz clock . using a labview interface",
    "we could tailor any distribution of phase and intensity fluctuations in the rf electrical signal being fed to the aom on time scales ranging from few hundreds of nanoseconds to seconds .",
    "these fluctuations were transferred to the diffracted light by the acousto - optic interaction thus providing fine electronic control over the phase and intensity of the light .",
    "measurements at the two detectors were used to determine the second order correlation ( intensity - intensity correlation ) function . for the case of continuous light intensity measurements ,",
    "the laser was operated at a power of around @xmath5 and d1 and d2 were two fast photodiodes ( thorlabs pd10a - ec ) . for the case of photon coincidence detection ,",
    "the laser light was strongly attenuated , photodiodes d1 and d2 were avalanche photo - diode ( apd ) based single photon counting modules ( spcm - aqr-15 perkin elmer ) where an incident photon results in a ttl pulse with a detection efficiency of 65% at 767 nm @xcite .",
    "the outputs of d1 and d2 were stored in a pc using data acquisition systems . in the case of classical detectors ,",
    "a digital storage oscilloscope was employed , while for photon counting , two counters on a data acquisition card ( ni m - series pci-6259 ) were used .",
    "in this section , we describe the creation of incoherent sources of light by imparting phase jumps to light by means of the aoms in the mzi ( fig.1 ) .",
    "the use of a mach - zehnder interferometer was motivated by the facts that , i ) phase changes imparted to light can be discerned only in an interferometric setup , and ii ) it enables the creation of a source with intensity fluctuations even though only phase jumps are imparted to light .      the action of the mzi in fig.[schematic ] may be mathematically represented by the transformation matrix @xmath6 where @xmath7 ( the operation of a beam splitter ) and @xmath8 ( the action of the two aoms ) are given by @xmath9 here @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the phase shifts imparted to light at aoms 1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "thus , in terms of the scalar wave field , @xmath12 , entering one of the ports of @xmath13 ( and with no input at its other port ) the output at @xmath14 is given by @xmath15 where 1 , 2 represent the input ports of bs1 and 1 , 2 the output ports of bs2 .",
    "it is clear that the second order intensity self - correlation at the output ports is given by @xmath16 where i can take values 1 ,",
    "2. in terms of field operators @xmath17 is given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 with @xmath20 being the input state , @xmath21 , @xmath22 the annihilation operators of the input modes , and @xmath23 those of the output modes , and @xmath24 is as defined earlier . in our setup , @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is a coherent state .",
    "simplification of eqs .",
    "[ g2classical ] and [ g2quantum ] , for the case of complete phase noise , ( i.e. , uniformly distributed noise , with phase spanning the entire circle ) both yield @xmath27 where @xmath28 .",
    "note that we have adjusted the mzi to match the dynamical paths in both arms and , therefore , the phase difference is the difference in the phases imparted at the two aoms .",
    "the temporal coherence of light , emerging out of the port 2 , was determined by intensity correlation technique in a standard correlation setup developed by hanbury - brown and twiss @xcite .",
    "equation(6 ) can be easily cast into the form @xmath29 where @xmath30 represents the probability of temporal overlap of @xmath31 and @xmath32 . in general , for complete phase noise given to aom 1 and 2 and phase jumps occurring at time intervals @xmath33 given by independent distributions @xmath34 and @xmath35 respectively , we have @xmath36 for the special case where one of the phases , say @xmath11 , is held constant eq .",

    "the agreement between theory and experiment is very good .",
    "the above measurements , which utilized classical detection of intensities with photodetectors , were repeated at the photon counting regime using apd based single - photon counting modules ( spcm ) .",
    "the laser light was strongly attenuated , so that , on an average , every @xmath48s , there was a 10% probability of detecting a photon . thus , there was , on an average , less than one photon in the interferometer at any instant of time .",
    "the output pulses from d1 and d2 ( apd based spcms ) were fed to two counters operating at a time bin of @xmath48s , that was shorter than the mean interval between phase jumps that ranged from @xmath45 to @xmath49 .",

    "[ correl](c ) and [ correl](d ) , along with theoretically expected values .",
    "the agreement is fair . in order to obtain sufficient statistics at single photon detection level , data had to be acquired over long durations",
    ". mechanical instability of the interferometer and dark counts are believed to have contributed to the deviation from the theoretical curves in the photon counting regime .    from the above",
    ", it is amply clear that classical light sources exhibiting bunching and with the desired temporal coherence characteristics may be created .",
    "the results also confirm the equivalence between classical intensity - intenstiy correlation and coincidence detection for @xmath0 measurement for classical states of light . in the present experiment ,",
    "the time scales for phase fluctuations are on the milliseconds time scales due to restriction of the data acquisition card .",
    "the setup allows for a temporal variation from  @xmath50 ( currently limited to @xmath51 by usb 2.0 communication ) to few seconds depending upon the stability of the interferometer .",
    "this provides an easy way of creating bunched light with long coherence times .",
    "further the bunching can be enhanced and higher values of @xmath52 can be obtained by using engineered partial phase noise in this interferometric setup@xcite .",
    "in this section , we demonstrate the creation of classical incoherent states with desired photon number distributions ( pnd ) , starting from an input coherent state .",
    "this was achieved by modulating the diffraction efficiency of a single aom by the addition of calibrated amplitude noise with the desired characteristics to the input rf electrical signal .",
    "this , in effect , modulates the transmittivity of the coherent state through the aom according to the chosen probability distribution function , thereby providing a source of classical light with a tailored photon number distribution .",
    "consider the coherent state @xmath53 being diffracted by an aom where the transmittivity into the diffracted order ( amplitude of the coherent state ) is modulated in time , in the from of @xmath54 .",
    "the modulated coherent state and its expansion in terms of number ( fock ) states can be written as @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the photon number distribution function and @xmath57 is the diffracted coherent state at maximal transmittivity , and @xmath58 is the fock basis . the ensemble in eq.([transmit ] ) is practically realized by appropriately modulating the transmittivity of the input coherent state over a sufficient amount of time .",
    "the upper limit of @xmath59 can be taken as infinity if @xmath60 is chosen to be much larger than the mean @xmath61 .",
    "we experimentally generate light sources with two specific pnds as examples .",
    "the first is the thermal state with an average of @xmath62 photons , namely , @xmath63 @xcite with @xmath64 for which the probabilities @xmath65 define the pnd .",

    "[ histo ] ]      for this part of the experiment aom1 of fig.1 was switched off and bs2 was removed .",
    "thus , only the light emerging from aom2 could reach the detectors , which in this case were apd based spcms , as described previously .",
    "the input laser beam was attenuated using neutral density filters to at most 94000 counts per second ( cps ) , suitable for measurement in the photon counting regime @xcite .",
    "the number distribution of photons was determined using a time bin of @xmath77s .",
    "the size of the time bin , which determines the average photon number , was so chosen for the pnd measurements to clearly bring out the distinction between coherent and incoherent states of various parameters . once chosen this time bin",
    "was fixed for all pnd determinations .",
    "all measurements lasted for a period of at least 30 minutes to obtain good statistics .",
    "initially , no noise was added to the rf signal and the maximum rf power was fed to the aom ; the @xmath78 order diffracted light in this situation constitutes the maximally transmitted coherent state @xmath57 .",
    "the pnd for this light , as obtained from our measurements , is as shown in fig .",
    "[ histo](a ) .",
    "it gave a poissonian distribution with a mean photon number of 42 with an estimated average dark counts @xmath79 @xcite per time bin , which is three orders of magnitude smaller than the average photon number in any of our experimental observations .",
    "the second - order correlation function , @xmath0 for this case is shown in the inset ; it is clearly that of a coherent state with @xmath80 for all @xmath38 .",

    "the rf power was fluctuated at random time intervals in the range @xmath81 to @xmath82 ms with a mean time of @xmath83 ms , with the distribution of time intervals falling exponentially .",

    "the second - order correlation function for this case is shown in the inset .",
    "the zero - delay second - order correlation has a value 2 , as expected for thermal light .",
    "this shows that temporal modulation of intensity of coherent light leads to the bunching of photons . on similar lines ,",
    "the rf power fed to the aom was varied such that the transmitted coherent state @xmath87 was modulated to realise the non - gaussian function @xmath88 of eq.@xmath89 for three different values of @xmath62 ( 2.60 , 4.88 and 7.41 ) .",

    "the good agreement between theory and experiment for all measurements , both gaussian and non - gaussian , underlines the reliability and efficacy of this method in generating tailored classical light sources with desired pnd and temporal coherence characteristics .",
    "generation of classical non - gaussian states with desired pnd in a predetermined manner promises to be useful in various contexts as discussed in the next section .",
    "as our method offers complete flexibility of providing phase and/or intensity fluctuations with different desired probability distributions and on different time scales , the aoms can be used to generate classical incoherent light having properties quite different from existing light sources , opening up new fields for exploration .",
    "for example it is a simple matter to produce light with temporal incoherence but spatial coherence .",
    "this is a crucial requirement in experiments involving photon addition / subtraction to incoherent light@xcite and this aom - based technique is likely to find immediate application here .",
    "another feature , likely to prove useful , is the ability to control the mean photon number with ease , even during the course of a measurement , by electronic means .",

    "the superscript @xmath81 indicates that we have added one photon , and @xmath95 and @xmath96 are appropriate normalisations .",

    "clearly , both the weight functions in eq.([photon - add ] ) correspond to nonclassical states , and this is made manifest in figs.([phot_add ] ) a ) and figs.([phot_add ] ) b ) .",
    "further the nonclassicality ( quantumness ) of the states @xmath99 and @xmath100 are qualitatively different . to make this observation quantitative , we now evaluate the mandel parameter @xmath101 , of these states with respect to the mean number of photons .",

    "<S> we demonstrate a method for the generation of tunable classical light sources with electronic control over its temporal characteristics and photon number distribution by modulating coherent light . </S>",
    "<S> the tunability of the temporal coherence is shown through second order correlation ( @xmath0 ) measurements both in the continuous intensity measurement as well as in the photon counting regimes . </S>",
    "<S> the generation of desired classical photon number distributions is illustrated by creating two light sources - one emitting thermal state and the other a specific classical non - gaussian state . </S>",
    "<S> such tailored light sources with emission characteristics quite different from that of existing natural light sources are likely to be useful in quantum information processing for example in conjunction with photon addition to possibily generate tailored non - clasical states of light . as a particular application in this direction </S>",
    "<S> we outline how a classical non - gaussian state generated in this manner may be mixed with an appropriate non - classical gaussian state at a beamsplitter , to generate non - gaussian entanglement . </S>"
