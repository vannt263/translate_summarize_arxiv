    "the experimental results obtained in the heavy - ion experiments at the relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) , in particular the large values of the elliptic flow , are most often interpreted as the evidence for a very fast equilibration of the produced matter ( presumably within a fraction of 1  fm / c ) and for its almost perfect - fluid behavior @xcite .    the very fast equilibration is naturally explained within a concept that the produced matter is a strongly coupled quark - gluon plasma ( sqgp ) @xcite .",
    "however , there exist other explanations that assume that the plasma is weakly interacting . in this case",
    "the plasma instabilities lead to the fast isotropization of matter , which in turn helps to achieve the full equilibration in a short time @xcite .",
    "recently , several explicit calculations have shown that the large values of the elliptic flow and other soft - hadronic observables may be successfully reproduced in the models that do not assume the very fast equilibration .",
    "for example , in refs .",
    "@xcite the stage described by the perfect - fluid hydrodynamics was preceded by the free streaming of partons ( see also @xcite ) , while in refs .",
    "@xcite the authors assumed that only transverse degrees of freedom are thermalized ( schematic scenarios describing the approach towards the full equilibration were discussed in this context in refs .",
    "such results indicate that the assumption of the fast equilibration / isotropization might be relaxed .",
    "it should be also emphasized that the concept of practically instantaneous equilibration seems to contradict the results of the microscopic models of heavy - ion collisions .",
    "such models typically use the ideas of color strings or color - flux tubes .",
    "the system produced by strings is highly anisotropic ; the pressure in the direction transverse to the collision axis is usually much larger than the longitudinal pressure .",
    "similar situation takes place in the color glass condensate ( cgc ) approach where the distribution functions are far away from the equilibrium ones . in this case",
    "the longitudinal momentum distribution is much narrower than the transverse one and described by the dirac delta function @xmath0 at @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "this approximation is often used in descriptions of the initial stage in nucleus - nucleus collisions ( for example see @xcite ) .    in view of the problems connected with the equilibration and isotropization of the plasma , it is useful to develop and analyze the models which can be used to describe locally anisotropic systems . in this paper",
    "we introduce the framework of highly - anisotropic hydrodynamics that takes into account dissipation effects .",
    "the dissipation is defined by the form of the entropy source .",
    "the latter depends on the pressure anisotropy and vanishes for the isotropic fluid .",
    "the proposed model has a structure that is very much similar to the perfect - fluid hydrodynamics .",
    "the main two differences are connected with : * i ) * the possibility that the longitudinal and transverse pressures are different , and * ii ) * the possibility of entropy production . by relaxing the assumption about the isentropic flow , we generalize our previous formulations of anisotropic ( magneto)hydrodynamics presented in @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that the deviations from equilibrium are naturally described in the framework of viscous ( israel - stewart ) hydrodynamics .",
    "however , the region of the applicability of viscous hydrodynamics extends to the systems that are close to equilibrium .",
    "this is reflected in the dependence of the transport coefficients on the equilibrium variables such as temperature or chemical potentials .",
    "thus , the viscous corrections are applicable for the intermediate , locally almost equilibrated stage ( for a recent review see @xcite ) .    in our opinion",
    ", the use of viscous hydrodynamics in the description of very early stages of the collisions may be inadequate  the strong reduction of the initial longitudinal pressure leads to significant deviations from equilibrium ( see @xcite ) .",
    "on the other hand , the kinetic models that are most suitable for the description of the systems out of equilibrium are very much complicated and difficult to deal with .",
    "therefore , there is a place for effective models which can describe the early non - equilibrium dynamics together with the transition to the perfect - fluid regime .",
    "our formulation of the anisotropic hydrodynamics follows this direction .    within our approach ,",
    "a simple ansatz for the entropy source leads to a non - linear equation describing the time evolution of the anisotropy in the purely - longitudinal boost - invariant systems .",
    "the non - linearity implies that a possible strong initial anisotropy is eliminated .",
    "the resulting evolution of the system agrees with the expectations about the behavior of matter produced at the early stages of relativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "in particular , the equilibration of the system is connected with the processes of entropy production .",
    "although our numerical results are presented for the simple one - dimensional system , the proposed formalism is general and may be applied to more complicated 2 + 1 and 3 + 1 situations ( in a similar way as the perfect - fluid hydrodynamics ) .",
    "in addition , different forms of the entropy source inspired by different microscopic mechanisms may be analyzed . in our further studies",
    "we want to explore such rich possibilities .",
    "below we assume that particles ( partons ) are massless and we use the following definitions for rapidity and spacetime rapidity , @xmath2 which come from the standard parameterization of the four - momentum and spacetime coordinate of a particle , @xmath3 here the quantity @xmath4 is the transverse momentum @xmath5 and @xmath6 is the ( longitudinal ) proper time @xmath7 throughout the paper we use the natural units where @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "our approach is based on the following form of the energy - momentum tensor @xmath10 where @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 are the energy density , transverse pressure , and longitudinal pressure , respectively . in the special case of the isotropic fluid , where , we recover the form of the energy - momentum tensor of the perfect - fluid hydrodynamics .",
    "the four - vector @xmath14 describes the hydrodynamic flow , @xmath15 while @xmath16 defines the direction of the longitudinal axis that plays a special role due to the initial geometry of the collision .",
    "the four - vectors @xmath14 and @xmath16 satisfy the following normalization conditions @xmath17 in the local - rest - frame ( lrf ) of the fluid element we have @xmath18 . in the same reference frame the four - vector @xmath16 that satisfies eqs .",
    "( [ uvnorm ] ) and defines the longitudinal direction has the form @xmath19 .",
    "the forms of @xmath14 and @xmath16 in other reference systems are obtained by the lorentz boosts .    in lrf",
    "the energy - momentum tensor has the diagonal structure , @xmath20 hence , as expected , the formula ( [ tmunudec ] ) allows for different pressures in the longitudinal and transverse directions .",
    "in addition to the energy - momentum tensor ( [ tmunudec ] ) we introduce the entropy flux @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the entropy density .",
    "we assume that @xmath11 and @xmath22 are functions of @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "in particular , since we consider massless partons here , the condition @xmath23 gives @xmath24    we note that the form of the energy - momentum tensor ( [ tmunudec ] ) resembles the form used in relativistic magnetohydrodynamics @xcite . in that case",
    "the anisotropy is induced by the presence of the magnetic field . at the early stages of heavy - ion collisions we have similar situation",
    " there exist strong color magnetic and electric longitudinal fields ( glasma following cgc @xcite ) which polarize the medium .",
    "explicit _ inclusion of the fields should be one of the first tasks connected with the generalization of the presented framework .",
    "the first steps in this direction but for the isentropic case were made in @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of the system is governed by the equations expressing the energy - momentum conservation and the entropy growth ( the second law of thermodynamics ) , @xmath25 here the function @xmath26 describes the entropy source .",
    "the form of @xmath26 must be treated as the assumption defining the dynamics of the anisotropic fluid . besides the condition @xmath27 it is natural to assume that for . in this way , in the case where the two pressures are equal , we recover the structure of the perfect - fluid hydrodynamics .",
    "we note that @xmath26 is the _ internal _ source of the entropy , i.e. , @xmath26 describes the entropy growth due to the equilibration of pressures in the system .    in the following",
    "we shall treat @xmath26 as a function of @xmath12 and @xmath13 . in this way ,",
