    "the giant elliptical galaxy ngc 1052 , which is also classified as a low - ionization nuclear emission - line region ( liner ) galaxy , holds an agn in the center ( @xcite ) .",
    "if we assume @xmath0 km s@xmath1 mpc@xmath1 and @xmath2 , the redshift , @xmath3 ( @xcite ) , corresponds to a distance of 20 mpc , and 1 milliarcsec ( mas ) corresponds to 0.095 pc . at radio wavelengths ,",
    "double - sided jets elongated by several pc in p.a.@xmath4 are seen with an emission gap in between ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , though it is unclear where the nucleus is located .",
    "water masers are found along the jet , which are considered to be excited by shocks into circumnuclear molecular clouds , or amplification of the radio continuum emission of the jet by foreground molecular clouds ( @xcite ) .",
    "this object shows a convex radio spectrum peaked at 10 ghz , to be classified as a ghz - peaked spectrum ( gps ) source ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "a steep spectrum with @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) at frequencies above the peak ( @xcite ) and a high brightness temperature of @xmath7 k ( see subsection 3.1 ) indicate synchrotron radiation .",
    "two possible hypotheses are proposed for the rising spectrum below the peak frequency in gps sources : synchrotron self - absorption ( ssa ) or free  free absorption ( ffa ) .",
    "both can generate convex spectra : @xmath8 $ ] for ssa , and @xmath9 for ffa , where @xmath10 is the frequency in ghz , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the ssa and ffa coefficients , respectively , and @xmath13 is the intrinsic spectral index . in general , the spectral shape will be a product of both .",
    "ffa arises from an external absorber in front of the synchrotron emitter , while ssa is an internal process of the synchrotron emission via an interaction between the relativistic plasma and the magnetic field . because these spectral shapes resemble each other , precise spectral measurements are necessary to detect any small difference .",
    "ffa can generate a steeper cutoff than the maximum attainable spectral index , @xmath14 , of @xmath15 by ssa .",
    "thus , a component with @xmath16 could be evidence of ffa .",
    "another distinction is related to the difference of the peak frequencies in twin jets . in the case of ssa , the peak frequency in the receding jet",
    "should be lower than that in the approaching jet due to the doppler shift , if we assume an intrinsic symmetry .",
    "on the contrary , a longer path length towards the receding jet causes a deeper ffa opacity , and thus a higher peak frequency .",
    "a sufficiently high spatial resolution is crucial to avoid spectral blending , as demonstrated by @xcite .",
    "because the ffa coefficient is related to the electron density , @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) , and the electron temperature , @xmath19 ( k ) , by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the integration via the line of sight in pc , it can be a probe for cold dense plasma ( @xcite ) .",
    "there exists increasing evidence for ffa towards active galaxies .",
    "one remarkable milestone is the discovery of a counter - jet in 3c 84 at the center of the nearby seyfert / cd galaxy ngc 1275 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the counter - jet showed a strongly inverted spectrum , unlike the approaching jet with a steep spectrum , whose feature can be explained by ffa due to ambient cold dense plasma ( see the appendix ) .",
    "this idea was confirmed by following vlba observations by @xcite and vsop observations by @xcite .",
    "ffa towards gps sources was predicted by @xcite .",
    "they suggested that photoionization of the interstellar medium ( ism ) by radiative shocks produces ionized gas , which has a significant emission measure and a correspondingly high ffa opacity .",
    "the discovery of ffa towards gps sources was made by a space - vlbi observation towards a gps galaxy , oq 208 , which showed convex spectra towards two radio lobes separated by 10 pc .",
    "the difference in the path length along the line of sight between two lobes causes an asymmetry in the ffa opacity , with a larger opacity towards the far - side lobe .",
    "the ffa opacity implied that cold ( @xmath22 k ) dense ( @xmath23 @xmath18 ) plasma associates with the central tens of pc ( @xcite ) .",
    "this result showed that multi - frequency vlbi observations are crucial to clarify the ffa , which can be a probe of matter in the vicinity of agn .",
    "the discovery of the ffa absorber was followed by observations towards the radio galaxies ngc 4261 ( @xcite ) and 0108 + 388 ( @xcite ) .",
    "we emphasize two advantages for the ffa as a probe of accreting matter , when the absorber covers the background bright core and jets .",
    "first , since the absorber must be at the near side of the jet , it allows us to figure a 3-dimensional geometry of the system .",
    "second , the opacity provides physical properties of the absorber , such as the electron density , @xmath17 , and the temperature , @xmath19 .",
    "ngc 1052 , the nearest gps source showing the double - sided jets , is one of the best target sources .    in this paper",
    ", we report on simultaneous trichromatic very long baseline array ( vlba ) observations towards ngc 1052 at 2.3 , 8.4 , and 15.4 ghz , which produce an ffa opacity map .",
    "our aim is to investigate the geometry and physical properties of the ffa absorber .",
    "using the vlba of the national radio astronomy observatory ( nrao ) , we observed ngc 1052 at three frequencies ( 2.3 , 8.4 , and 15.4 ghz ) simultaneously on 1998 december 15 .",
    "the subreflector switched between the dual - frequency 2.3/8.4 ghz reflector system and the 15.4 ghz feed horn with a 22-min cycle .",
    "we used 4 channels of 8 mhz bandwidth at 15.4 ghz , and allocated 2 channels at both 2.3 and 8.4 ghz .",
    "the correlation process was accomplished by the vlba correlator .",
    "we applied fringe - fitting , data flagging , and a priori amplitude calibration in the nrao aips ( astronomical image processing system ) .",
    "imaging and self - calibration processes were carried out using difmap ( @xcite ) .",
    "we took uniform weighting with scaling by errors raised to the power @xmath24 .",
    "the synthesized beam sizes ( fwhm ) were @xmath25 mas in p.a.@xmath26 , @xmath27 mas in p.a.@xmath28 , and @xmath29 mas in p.a.@xmath30 , for 2.3 , 8.4 , and 15.4 ghz , respectively .",
    "while relative gain errors among the antennas are corrected though amplitude self - calibration processes , further flux calibration is necessary to obtain certain spectra across the observing frequencies . for the purpose of the absolute flux calibration",
    ", we also imaged four calibrators : the bl lacertae , da 193 , 3c 279 , and ot 081 .",
    "based on a comparison between the total flux measurements by the university of michigan radio astronomy observatory ( umrao ) and the nrao green bank interferometer , and a summation of the cleaned flux densities , we applied flux scaling for the final results . at 15.4 ghz , for instance , the total cleaned flux densities before an absolute correction were 3.276 , 5.012 , 25.769 , and 4.172 jy for bl lac , da 193 , 3c 279 , and ot 081 , respectively .",

    "we then calculated a correction factor ( @xmath35 ) of @xmath36 , so that we scaled our image by the factor and obtained an accuracy of the flux scale of 1.8% .",
    "the accuracy was derived from a standard deviation of the correction factors by the four calibrators . in the same manner , we scaled images at 2.3 and 8.4 ghz by correction factors of 0.84 and 0.79 , respectively .",
