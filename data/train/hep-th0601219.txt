    "in 1990 , carroll - field - jackiw @xcite have proposed a version of the maxwell electrodynamics corrected by a chern - simons - like term @xmath0 in order to incorporate a lorentz - violating background @xmath1 into the usual electrodynamics .",
    "this term implies a modified theory in which photons with different polarizations propagate with distinct velocities ( birefringence ) .",
    "some years later , colladay & kostelecky @xcite-@xcite have constructed an extension of the minimal standard model , the extended standard model ( sme ) , in which lorentz - violating tensor terms , stemming from a spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) of a more fundamental theory ( defined at the planck scale ) are properly incorporated in all interaction sectors . the construction of the sme was in part motivated by works demonstrating the possibility of lorentz and cpt spontaneous violation in the context of string theory @xcite-@xcite .",
    "recently , the sme has motivated innumerous interesting works @xcite-@xcite .",
    "one of the most remarkable controversies involving lorentz violation deals with the radiative generation of the carroll - field - jackiw term from the integration on the fermion fields @xcite-@xcite .",
    "lorentz violating theories investigations have also been concerned with the consistency aspects of the carroll - field - jackiw electrodynamics @xcite-@xcite , study of synchrotron radiation , electrostatics and magnetostatics in lorentz - violating electrodynamics @xcite-@xcite , influence of lorentz violation on the dirac equation @xcite-@xcite , cpt - probing experiments @xcite-@xcite , cerenkov radiation @xcite , and general aspects @xcite-@xcite .    a theoretical model which provides an attractive electron - electron interaction could work , in principle , as a good framework to properly address the electron - electron pairing in planar systems .",
    "in fact , if an attractive electron - electron interaction is obtained in the context of a particular model , it may be seen as a first connection between such theoretical models and the attainment of electron pairing . in practice , this interplay has begun with the application of the maxwell - chern - simons ( mcs ) theory @xcite-@xcite for evaluating the electron - electron interaction in a planar model . however , it was soon established that the mcs model does not imply an attractive interaction for small topological mass @xmath2 regime compatible with low - energy excitations .",
    "currently it is well known that by including the higgs sector @xcite , @xcite , an attractive interaction can be got , assured it is suitably coupled to the fermion field by a quartic order term - @xmath3 ( that gives rise to the yukawa coupling with the higgs field after ssb ) . on the other hand",
    ", it has been recently verified that the mcs theory may also yield an attractive @xmath4 potential ( in the absence of higgs sector ) provided it is considered in the presence of a fixed lorentz - violating background . specifically , it has been evaluated the electron - electron interaction potential in the context of a planar lorentz - violating maxwell - chern - simons model ( arising from the dimensional reduction of the maxwell - carroll - field - jackiw model ) .",
    "such calculation was carried out both for the case of a purely timelike background @xcite and for a purely spacelike background @xcite , leading to interacting potentials with a well ( attractive ) region .",
    "some years ago , it was argued that there is a relation between lorentz violation and noncommutativity @xcite .",
    "the introduction of noncommutativity in the mcs model @xcite has appeared as a new mechanism able to provide @xmath4 attraction .",
    "in fact , the noncommutative extension of the minimal mcs model has shown to be a suitable framework to provide an attractive electron - electron potential .",
    "specifically , this model yields the same interaction potential attained by georgelin & wallet @xcite considering a non - minimal pauli magnetic coupling .",
    "this puts in evidence the relevance of non usual mechanisms for the attainment of electron - electron attractiveness .",
    "it should be also mentioned that noncommutative chern - simons theories have been applied successfully to describe properties of planar hall systems @xcite-@xcite , one of the points of clear connection of noncommutativity with condensed matter physics .",
    "the large number of applications of noncommutativity to condensed matter physics and the general relation between these mechanisms indicate that applications of lorentz violation to condensed matter systems should be a sensible and feasible issue as well .    lorentz violation in the presence of the higgs sector and spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb )",
    "was first investigated in the context of the 4-dimensional abelian - higgs carroll - field - jackiw electrodynamics @xcite .",
    "this model , by means of a dimensional reduction procedure , has originated a planar electrodynamics composed of the mcs sector with a higgs field , coupled to a massless klein - gordon mode - @xmath5 ( stemming from the dimensional reduction , @xmath6 ) and to the lorentz - violating background ( @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the consistency of this model was also set up ( it turned out to be totally causal , unitary and stable ) .",
    "once ssb takes place , the gauge and the klein - gordon fields acquire mass , giving rise to a mcs - proca electrodynamics coupled to the lorentz - violating background .",
    "such a model was already used to perform an investigation concerned with condensed matter physics : the study of vortex - like solutions in a planar lorentz - violating environment @xcite . as a result",
    ", it was shown that it provides charged vortex solutions that recover the usual nielsen - olesen configuration in the asymptotic regime .    in the present work ,",
    "the aim is to investigate the electron - electron interaction in the context of the abelian - higgs lorentz - violating planar model previously defined , another issue with possible connection with condensed matter physics .",
    "the lagrangian of ref .",
    "@xcite does not stand for the most general neither the most simple model to perform such a task .",
    "however , there are two good reasons to adopt it : its consistency has been already established ; it is expected that it will provide shielded versions of the mcs lorentz - violating potentials derived in ref .",
    "@xcite ( which present a logarithmically asymptotic behavior ) .",
    "having stated the gauge model , the dirac sector is properly incorporated in it by exhibiting the minimal and the yukawa couplings with the gauge ( @xmath8 and the scalar ( @xmath9 fields , respectively .",
    "one then proceeds to carry out the electron - electron potential for the case of a purely timelike background and to discuss its possible attractiveness .",
    "the procedure is much similar to the one adopted in refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite : starting from a known planar lagrangian , the mller scattering amplitudes ( for the gauge and scalar intermediations ) are constructed ; next , its fourier transforms are evaluated , leading to the interacting potentials . in the present case ,",
    "the result is a totally screened potential * * ( * * due to the presence of the higgs sector * * ) * * composed of the sum of a scalar and a gauge contribution .",
    "this potential exhibits an attractive behavior even in the presence of the centrifugal barrier and the @xmath10gauge invariant term , thereby confirming its attractive character ( even under a more rigorous analysis ) and its possible relevance to the formation of electron - electron pairs in planar systems .",
    "the results obtained here are compared with the one of ref .",
    "@xcite in order to emphasize the role played by the higgs sector : it transforms logarithmically divergent solutions in entirely shielded ones .",
    "this comparison will be accomplished throughout this work .",
    "another point to be remarked is that the gauge potentials here derived may be attractive while the ones of refs .",

    "in the context of a low - energy interaction , the born approximation holds as a good approximation .",

    "[ ptb ]    veffplot1.eps    the graph in fig.[[veffplot1 ] ] shows that the effective and the gauge potential differ from each other , for the adopted parameter values , by an absolutely negligible amount , because in  this case , the graphics come out perfectly superimposed ( revealing that they correspond numerically to the same value ) .",
    "thus , the effective potential also exhibits an attractive behavior , showing that the gauge interaction is really endowed with attractiveness .    in the framework of this work ,",
    "the total electron - electron interaction encompasses the gauge and the scalar contributions : * * @xmath147 * * this total potential is attractive whenever * * it presents a well - shaped region .",
    "the shape of the total potential near the origin depends on the value of the constants @xmath148 if @xmath149 the total potential will present a similar behavior to that of the scalar potential of fig .",
    "[ 1 ] , while in the case @xmath150 it will be approximately as the gauge potential of figs.[2 , 3 ] .",
    "as both these forms of potential are endowed with well regions , we conclude that the total potential may always be attractive .",
    "this constitutes a relevant result provided it ensures the possibility of obtaining @xmath4 bound states in the framework of this particular model .",
    "in this work , it was considered the mller scattering in the context of the planar lorentz - violating maxwell - chern - simons - proca electrodynamics , obtained from the dimensional reduction of the abelian - higgs maxell - carroll - field - jackiw model @xcite . for the case of a purely timelike background",
    ", the interaction potential was calculated as the fourier transform of the mller amplitude ( born approximation ) , carried out in the non - relativistic regime .",
    "the attained total potential presents two distinct contributions : the attractive scalar potential ( stemming form the yukawa exchange ) and the gauge one ( mediated by the mcs - proca gauge field ) .",
    "the scalar potential , as expected , is always attractive no matter if it is near or far from the origin , and represents a totally shielded interaction .",
    "such an interaction may be identified with phonon exchange processes , which represent physical excitations in several systems of interest . as for the gauge interaction , it is composed of the repulsive mcs - proca potential @xmath151 corrected by background - depending contributions , which impose relevant physical modifications .",
    "indeed , for larger values of v@xmath152 the gauge potential exhibits a pronounced attractive region .",
    "both the scalar and gauge potentials are entirely screened interactions , a consequence of the massive mediators generated by the higgs mechanism .",
    "this feature , in principle , may turn these potentials suitable for describing real planar systems of condensed matter physics .",
    "this is the main difference between the interaction potentials of this work and the potentials derived in ref .",
    "@xcite , which present a logarithmic asymptotic behavior and are unsuitable for representing a physical interaction in a low - energy planar system .",
    "hence , in an attempt of accounting for a real interaction in a lorentz - violating planar system , one should adopt the potentials here derived instead of the ones of ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this work ,",
    "one has argued that the total interaction potential exhibits an attractive region , able to bring about the formation of @xmath153 pairs . as a forthcoming feasible application , one can explicitly evaluate the @xmath4 binding energies by means of the numerical solution of the schrdinger equation written for the potentials here derived .",
    "this may be done by ascribing reasonable values for the free parameters of this model , in a similar procedure to the one of refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite .",
    "it is expected that a fine tune of the parameters would yield binding energies in the scale of @xmath154 , a typical energy for electron - electron pairing in planar systems .",
    "it is also important to emphasize the difference between the total potential obtained in this work and the ones of ref .",
    "@xcite , which consist of an always repulsive mcs - proca contribution added to an attractive scalar potential . in this latter case ,",
    "the attractive scalar potential arises from the intermediation played by the higgs field , and the total potential exhibits attractiveness only if this scalar contribution overcomes the mcs - proca one .",
    "therefore , the possibility of attaining an attractive interaction depends entirely on the presence of the higgs mode .",
    "this is not the case of the present work , in which the gauge potential itself may be attractive ( even for small values of  v@xmath73 compared to the electron rest mass ) - see figs .",

    "furthermore , * * the scalar intermediation field is the one stemming from the dimensional reduction ( @xmath155 instead of the higgs field , which now accounts for the screened character of the interactions . * * these are particularities that distinguish the present model from the ones of refs .",

    "yet , the expressions of these potentials result to be different . indeed , while the lorentz - violating potentials increase logarithmically with distance ,",
    "the noncommutative potentials exhibit a @xmath156 asymptotic behavior .",
    "so , it is clear that these potentials differ from each other substantially , which justifies this investigation in the presence of both noncommutativity and lorentz violation .",
    "it is instructive to clarify the reason to have adopted a purely timelike background .",
    "this was done for a simplicity issue , since in this case the interaction potential may be exactly solved ( without approximations ) .",
    "the physical interpretation of this background , however , is not a straightforward matter , since v@xmath73 may not be easily associated with any parameter of the system .",
    "some felling can be got observing the effect of the background on the behavior of the system .",
    "as example , it was reported in ref .",
    "@xcite that a purely timelike background modifies drastically the asymptotic behavior of the electrical field of the mcs electrodynamics .",
    "in fact , while the pure mcs solution presents an exponentially decaying solution , the lorentz - violating mcs electric field exhibits an increasing logarithmic behavior . in this case , the background may be seen as a constant field that annihilates the screening of the electric sector of the theory , changing its asymptotic behavior .",
