    "for nearly a century lorentz invariance has been a basic assumption in theoretical physics . however , various approaches to the problem of quantum gravity question whether lorentz symmetry is truly fundamental . in this context , it is useful to consider low energy lorentz violating ( lv ) models from the point of view of effective field theory",

    "it can be thought of as the 4-velocity of a preferred frame , which breaks boost symmetry at every point of spacetime .",
    "this property it has in common with the 19th century concept of the aether , and like that aether it is also a dynamical system .",
    "hence a suitable name for it is the  aether \" , although it has nothing to do with electromagnetism .",
    "since the aether is coupled to einstein gr we refer to the theory as  einstein - aether \" theory ; we sometimes use the nickname  ae - theory \" for short . for a review of the motivation , history and recent status of the einstein - aether theory , see  @xcite and the references therein .",

    "let us briefly consider solutions for @xmath11 in the range @xmath141 , corresponding to @xmath156 . in this case",
    "the distance to the internal infinite radius sphere is infinite , and all the algebraic and differential invariants that we checked ( including @xmath1 , @xmath157 , @xmath158 , @xmath159 , and @xmath160 ) are asymptotically zero",
    ". however , the curvature component @xmath161 blows up asymptotically , when @xmath162 is the tangent to an affinely parameterized radial null geodesic approaching the internal infinity .",
    "the invariant @xmath163 blows up as @xmath164 , since @xmath165 is the killing vector @xmath22 and @xmath166 is conserved along the geodesic .",
    "this suggests that the above - mentioned invariants vanish because the tensor structure of the curvature , the aether , and all derivatives is determined by a single null vector pointing in the future radial null direction opposite to @xmath162 , i.e. pointing away from the internal area - infinity .",
    "returning now to the generic solution for @xmath167 , we examine more closely the behavior at the throat and at the internal infinity . since the spherical radius @xmath32 is not a good coordinate at the minimal area sphere , nor at the internal area - infinity ,",
    "we adopt instead the proper length coordinate @xmath168 , in terms of which the line element takes the form ds^2 = n(l ) dt^2 - dl^2 - r(l)^2 d^2 [ proplmetric]to get an idea of how the throat geometry depends on @xmath11 , we fix the mass @xmath116 of the solution and plot in fig .  [ rcurves ] the numerically computed function @xmath169 for several different values of @xmath11 .",
    "there is a discontinuity at @xmath108 where the solution abruptly changes from a singular flare - out in finite proper distance to a perfectly regular einstein - rosen bridge .",
    "the singularity approaches the throat as @xmath170 , but in the same limit the curvature becomes finite and the other half of the bridge suddenly appears .",
    "+    to more fully compare the schwarzschild and aether solutions we plot together in fig .  [ wormhole ] the radius @xmath169 and the norm of the killing vector @xmath171 for the two solutions with the same value of the total mass @xmath116 .",
    "+    at the internal singularity the norm of the killing vector goes to zero , and the killing vector is tangent to the constant @xmath32 surfaces , so the singularity is a  would - be \" killing horizon . the surface gravity of the horizon is given by @xmath172 at the horizon .",
    "the behavior is easily found using the previous formulae : d / dl= ( 1/2)(n / b)^1/2(y / r ) ( y - y_-)^2(1+y_+)/(2+y_+ ) .",
    "the exponent is positive , so the derivative of the norm vanishes as @xmath173 .",
    "the surface gravity is therefore zero , so the would - be killing horizon is extremal .",
    "we argued at the beginning of this section that the @xmath7 and @xmath8 terms in the action do not contribute to the field equations in the case of static , spherical symmetry and static aether , and the @xmath12 term can be absorbed into a simultaneous shift of @xmath11 and @xmath8 .",
    "this enabled us to reduce the general case to the one with only @xmath11 non - zero .",
    "we can nevertheless choose to include a @xmath8 term in the action , and by so doing re - express the content of the field equations in an interesting way .",
    "in particular , if we choose @xmath174 , then the @xmath11 and @xmath8 terms combine to make @xmath175 , where @xmath176 .",
    "this is just the maxwell lagrangian for a vector potential @xmath177 , up to a constant factor .",
    "we have been treating the contravariant vector @xmath0 as the independent field variable , but in this maxwell - like case it is natural to adopt instead the covariant vector @xmath177 as independent .",
    "this change just amounts to an invertible field redefinition , hence yields the same equations of motion when the metric and aether field equations are taken together . with this choice of field variable",
    "the theory with @xmath174 and @xmath178 looks quite similar to maxwell theory , the only difference being the constraint term @xmath179 in the lagrangian .",
    "it was shown in  @xcite that this is equivalent to the einstein - maxwell - charged dust system , with a constant charge to mass ratio fixed by @xmath11 , and restricted to the sector in which there exists a gauge choice for which the vector potential is parallel to the dust 4-velocity .",
    "( this is a real restriction . )",
    "it must be possible to interpret our strange static aether wormhole solution as a charged dust solution , but it is at first hard to see what could stabilize the dust unless it is extremally charged , which corresponds to the case @xmath119 .",
    "in fact it was argued in ref .",
    "@xcite , invoking prior results  @xcite for the charged dust problem , that there is no static solution with static aether and general @xmath11 .",

    "( in ref .",
    "@xcite the charged dust system with negative mass density and constant charge to mass ratio was studied ( among other cases ) in static axisymmetry , and it was shown that every harmonic function determines a solution . presumably among these solutions is the static aether solution found here . )",
    "this is related to the negative energy density that we already inferred above must be present . with a negative mass density ,",
    "the dust is gravitationally repulsive , and though it has the same sign charge it is electrically attractive .",
    "( in newtonian terms , a force @xmath180 produces an acceleration @xmath181 which is opposite to @xmath182 when @xmath183 is negative . )",
    "thus the gravitational and electric forces exchange their usual roles .",
    "the fact that the dust does not then just collapse on itself is perhaps due to the associated cost in ( positive ) electric field energy when the dust is squeezed together . although static , the solution is not regular , since there is an internal singularity .",
    "so far we have discussed the solution for @xmath94 in all ranges except for @xmath184 . in this range",
    "the metric function @xmath38 is negative , so @xmath185 is timelike .",
    "therefore , in order for the metric signature to be lorentzian , @xmath186 must be spacelike .",
    "but in this static solution the aether is parallel to @xmath186 ( cf .",
    "( [ statuform ] ) ) , so can not be timelike .",
    "hence there is no lorentzian solution with timelike aether corresponding to this range of @xmath94 .    as a mathematical curiosity ,",
    "if we allow @xmath187 , so there are two timelike dimensions , there would still be a further restriction for a real solution , since the ratio in ( [ n ] ) is negative and raised to the power @xmath188 . in order for @xmath98 to be real and positive",
    "this power must be an even integer @xmath183 , which implies @xmath189 .",
    "the ratio in ( [ c / r ] ) is also negative , and is raised to the different power @xmath190 , which can not also be an integer since @xmath191 is not an integer .",
    "however , the integration constant @xmath95 can be complex , thus balancing the phase of the right hand side of ( [ c / r ] ) , and yielding a real solution with signature ( @xmath192 ) .",
    "in this section we investigate the static solutions to the theory that , unlike the singular wormhole have a regular origin .",
    "we first show that there are no such regular pure aether solutions , and then turn to the case of fluid stars .",
    "spherically symmetric self - gravitating  solitons \" appear in a number of field systems coupled to gravity .",
    "for example there are boson star solutions in the einstein - klein - gordon system  @xcite and einstein - yang - mills theory possesses the bartnik - mckinnon solutions  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore natural to ask whether suchaether star \" solutions might exist in the vacuum einstein - aether theory .",
    "the static aether solution studied in the previous section is the unique solution with static aether ( remember , this means aether aligned with the timelike killing vector ) , and does not have a regular origin . thus the only way a regular aether star might exist is if the aether has a radial component .",
    "we now examine this possibility and show that it can not occur .",
    "the analysis of section [ analysis ] showed that local solutions around a general @xmath41 are characterized by three free parameters which may be taken to be @xmath47 , @xmath193 and @xmath194 . if we apply this result at the origin @xmath195 the parameter freedom is restricted .",
    "spherical symmetry implies that at the origin the radial component of the aether vanishes , @xmath196 . the normalization constraint ( [ constr1 ] )",
    "therefore fixes @xmath197 , and the @xmath32-derivative of this constraint implies that @xmath198 and @xmath199 are not independent , but rather are related by @xmath200 .",
    "thus there is a one parameter family of solutions regular at the origin .",
    "these solutions can not be asymptotically flat , for the following reason .",
    "the asymptotically flat boundary condition discussed in section [ analysis ] would require fixing the one free parameter , leaving a unique solution .",
    "however , pure ae - theory is scale invariant , so there must be at least a one parameter family of solutions much like the schwarzschild solutions of different mass in gr .",
    "( by contrast , einstein - yang - mills theory is _ not _ scale invariant , and admits a discrete family of soliton and black hole solutions . )",
    "we conclude that no regular aether stars exist .",
    "this conclusion was verified empirically by integrating out from the origin with different initial parameters , and attempting unsuccessfully to tune to an asymptotically flat solution .",
    "although there are no regular vacuum aether stars , globally regular solutions exist in the presence of a static , spherically symmetric perfect fluid with no aether couplings .",
    "the fluid stress tensor appearing in the metric field equation ( [ aee ] ) is t^m_ab = ( ( r)+p(r ) ) v_a v_b - p(r ) g_ab[perffluid]where @xmath201 is the fluid 4-velocity , @xmath202 it s mass density , and @xmath203 it s pressure . the metric field equation and the bianchi identity together imply that the sum of the aether and fluid energy - momentum tensors is divergenceless .",
    "in addition , since the aether does not couple directly to the fluid , its stress tensor is independently divergenceless when its field equation and unit constraint are satisfied",
    ". therefore the fluid stress tensor is also independently divergenceless in any solution .",
    "thus , an appropriate system of equations for the aether plus fluid case is the ( i ) metric field equation , ( ii ) aether field equation , ( iii ) radial component of @xmath204 , which is the hydrostatic equilibrium equation for the fluid p+a(+p ) = 0 , [ hydro ] and ( iv ) an equation of state @xmath205 .",
    "the count of parameters that can be freely specified when integrating out from a regular origin is the same as for the vacuum aether solution , except for the addition of a central value for the pressure @xmath206 . for a fixed central pressure ,",
    "there is just one parameter which can be tuned to obtain an asymptotically flat solution .",
    "now there is no contradiction with scale invariance , since the central pressure sets the scale and determines the total mass of the solution .",
    "that these asymptotically flat star solutions have a static aether can be inferred as follows .",
    "the field equations can be integrated out from the origin with the aether assumed static .",
    "the pressure drops to zero at some value @xmath207 , the surface of the star , where the static interior solution can be matched to the static vacuum aether solution discussed in section [ static ] .",
    "this solution is asymptotically flat , so it must be the unique asymptotically flat solution whose existence is indicated by the parameter count .",
    "a possible worry about the preceding argument is whether the matching to a vacuum solution at the surface of the star could be non - unique .",
    "provided @xmath50 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and their derivatives are continuous at @xmath207 one can simply continue the integration into the vacuum region .",
    "we have not studied this behavior in detail , but it seems that as long as this timelike surface is not a characteristic surface of the ode s corresponding to a spherical wavefront of the spin-0 modes of the theory , the field equations will imply the continuity condition .    to determine a star solution one can fix a central pressure and numerically integrate the @xmath28 and @xmath29 metric field equations and the hydrostatic equilibrium equation ( [ hydro ] ) , using the equation of state , from the origin to the radius @xmath1 where the pressure vanishes . there @xmath208 is continuous so one can use it to match to the vacuum solution .",
    "the total mass @xmath116 can be read off from ( [ m ] ) together with ( [ c / r ] ) , using the definition ( [ a ] ) , @xmath209 .",
    "the area of the 2-spheres in such a star solution is strictly increasing as @xmath32 increases from zero to the surface of the star where @xmath210 vanishes . at that point @xmath211 , so according to ( [ hydro ] ) @xmath212 ( assuming positive fluid energy density @xmath52 ) .",
    "thus ( [ a ] ) implies @xmath213 , which means that we always match to the static aether solution _ outside _ of the minimal area 2-sphere .",
    "throat \" never occurs in such a star solution .      to get a sense of the nature of the static aether star solutions we consider here the simplest example , stars with constant energy density interior .",
    "although this does not closely describe realistic stars , it is adequate for indicating the behavior of maximum mass limits and the stability properties of equilibrium configurations .",
    "the discontinuity in the mass density at the surface entails via the field equations a jump in @xmath34 , but @xmath45 remains continuous so can be used to match to the vacuum solution as described above .",
    "graphs of @xmath116 versus the central pressure @xmath214 for the equilibrium configurations are displayed in figure [ masses ] .",
    "+    in gr the mass asymptotes to a maximum value as the central pressure goes to infinity .",
    "physically , an infinite central pressure would be required to maintain equilibrium for a greater mass . as @xmath11 increases in the einstein - aether case the maximum mass limit decreases , and the mass curve develops a local maximum and a very shallow local minimum that is only apparent for larger values of @xmath11 . for sufficiently large @xmath11 a second local",
    "maximum occurs .",
    "( we have not attempted to determine the behavior at arbitrarily high pressures and for @xmath11 approaching 2 .",
    "perhaps the series of maxima and minima continues . )",
    "the presence of stationary points in the mass versus pressure curves is an indication that the stability character of the equilibrium may be changing  @xcite .",
    "the connection with linearized stability arises as follows . if the squared frequency of a mode is positive then the corresponding perturbation of the star is oscillatory , while if it is negative the perturbation grows exponentially in time . in the borderline case of zero frequency",
    "the mode has zero energy , hence corresponds to a variation between two static solutions with the same mass .",
    "transitions between stability and instability therefore occur at extrema of the mass versus @xmath1 plot shown in figure [ massvr ] , where a small displacement of @xmath1 does not change the mass to first order .",
    "+    in the gr limit there is no critical point .",

    "the central pressure has to be very large compared to the density for the star to reach the instability , implying a violation of the dominant energy condition . for @xmath97",
    "the pressure at the onset of instability is about 1.28 times the density .",
    "in this paper we analyzed the einstein - aether theory assuming stationary spherical symmetry .",
    "we determined the number of free parameters in the corresponding solutions to the field equations , and classified the asymptotically flat ones .",
    "the vacuum solution with static aether , i.e. aether aligned with the timelike killing vector , was found analytically up to inversion of a transcendental equation .",
    "it has a wormhole - like structure , with a minimal 2-sphere and a singular internal area - infinity which lies at finite affine parameter along a radial null geodesic and finite proper distance if @xmath106 .",
    "the static fluid star solutions were classified and studied numerically for the case of constant density , and the maximum mass and stability properties were determined .",
    "several directions for further work are suggested by these results .",
    "foremost from an observational point of view might be to determine the maximum mass limits for a realistic neutron star equation of state . for astrophysical applications it would also be necessary to determine the structure of rotating solutions .",
    "another open issue is the condition on the @xmath4 required by stability of small mass stars .",
    "a related question is whether the pure static aether wormhole solution is stable .",
    "the solutions studied here may be of some help on the unresolved question of energy positivity in ae - theory .",
