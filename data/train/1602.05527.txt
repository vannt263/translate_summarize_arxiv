    "comprised of new and existing telescopes at 1.3  mm and 0.87  mm , the eht is a global array for very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) observations of nearby supermassive black holes , including sgr  a * @xcite . uniquely among the many telescopes that observe sgr  a * , the eht resolves structures on the scale of a few schwarzschild radii in the inner accretion and outflow region .",
    "this resolution is well matched to the scales of the predicted physical and astrophysical features .",
    "previously published eht observations have used either the correlated flux density @xcite or polarization @xcite on long baselines to infer the structure of sgr  a*. in this work , we focus on a third eht data product , closure phases .      in a radio interferometric array ,",
    "each baseline produces a complex observable known as the visibility , which is effectively a fourier component of the source image .",
    "the visibility can be decomposed into two quantities : an amplitude and a phase .",
    "both parts of the visibility contain information about the structure of the observed source .",
    "the amplitude alone can be sufficient to characterize the approximate size of a source ( * ? ? ? * and others ) and",
    "even permit modelling of the source structure ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , but most of the detailed structural information is contained in the phase @xcite .",
    "for instance , @xcite demonstrated that the inclusion of phase data from just a few telescopes would nail down the spin vector of the black hole in an accretion flow model of sgr  a*.    at the high frequencies at which the eht observes , visibility phases are easily corrupted by rapidly varying tropospheric delays , primarily due to water vapor .",
    "a more robust phase observable is the closure phase , or sum of visibility phases along a closed loop of three baselines @xcite .",

    "closure phases that are neither zero nor 180  indicate that the source structure is not point - symmetric at the resolution of the observing array @xcite .",
    "nonzero closure phases have been detected on bright quasar sources with the eht and used to model the structure of these sources @xcite , but the relative weakness of sgr  a * has heretofore only allowed a weak upper limit to be placed on the absolute value of its closure phase on the california - hawaii - arizona triangle @xcite . in this paper",
    "we report on detections of nonzero closure phases in sgr  a * , providing the first direct indication of asymmetric emission near the black hole .",

    "the delay on baseline @xmath9 is positive if the signal arrives at station @xmath10 after station @xmath11 .",
    "a positive delay produces a positive visibility phase modulo @xmath12 ambiguities .",
    "the closure phase on a triangle of three baselines is defined to be the directed sum of the visibility phases in order : @xmath13 .",
    "obtaining a closure phase requires detecting the source on a closed triangle of three baselines . in practice ,",
    "source detection is accomplished by finding a peak in the scan amplitude in a multidimensional space defined by delays and the delay - rate ( residual to the correlator model values ) .",
    "the haystack observatory postprocessing system ( hops ) provides tools to search delay / rate space and determine the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) and probability of false detection associated with the peak .",
    "the rapidly variable troposphere at 1.3  mm introduces large phase fluctuations on each baseline , introducing challenges for fringe finding .",
    "when fringes are strong , coherent vector integration along the entire length of the scan is sufficient to detect the fringe despite the substantial coherence losses due to the rapidly varying phase .",
    "once the delays are well determined , the atmospheric phase variations are mitigated by segmenting the data at a cadence shorter than the timescale over which the tropospheric phase changes appreciably . since the tropospheric contribution to the measured visibility phases close , the visibility phases can be closed on a per - segment basis and then averaged over the length of the scan to produce a measurement of the closure phase of the source . the bispectral s / n of the resulting averaged closure phase can vary depending on the choice of segmentation time @xcite . however , evaluated closure phases at different segmentation times are self - consistent provided that the segmentation time does not greatly exceed the coherence timescale .",
    "when fringes are weak , as is often the case on baselines between hawaii and the mainland , hops supports additional strategies to aid in fringe detection .",
    "delay closure can be used to set tight search windows , aiding in the detection of marginal fringes .",
    "phase self - calibration on two strong baselines to a sensitive station can be used to mitigate atmospheric fluctuations on the third baseline of a triangle .",
    "weak fringes can sometimes be detected using incoherent averaging , in which data are segmented at a cadence comparable to the coherence time of the atmosphere , and then those segments are scalar - averaged @xcite .      since the optimal strategy for fringe detection and closure phase evaluation varies depending on the sensitivity of each station and atmospheric conditions , multiple strategies were employed , tailored to the particular characteristics of each dataset . when multiple measurements of the same closure phase were obtained through different processings , only the data point with the highest bispectral s / n was retained .",
    "the discarded duplicate points are consistent with the retained data points ( top panels of fig .",
    "[ fig - consistency ] ) , indicating that the particular methods chosen for fringe detection and closure phase evaluation do not significantly bias the data .",
    "there are two classes of triangles on which we obtain closure phases .",
    "triangles that include two vlbi stations from the same site ( e.g. , dfs ) should produce closure phases that are trivially zero to within measurement error . on the intrasite baseline of these `` trivial '' triangles , the large - scale emission in the galactic center ( on scales @xmath14 )",
    "is resolved out .",
    "sgr  a * is then pointlike , causing the intrinsic source phase to be zero .",
    "the two long baselines effectively sample the same @xmath15 point , adding a source phase on one baseline and subtracting it on the other .",
    "there is no evidence of nonzero closure phases on sgr  a * or other sources in our data on the trivial triangles .",
    "`` nontrivial '' closure phases on triangles involve one carma station , one station in hawaii , and the smt ; these may be nonzero due to source structure .    as another consistency check",
    ", we examined measurements of closure phases that should be identical to within their errors .",
    "it is possible that variations in sgr  a * may cause fluctuations in the closure phase from scan to scan .",
    "however , during any particular scan , it is possible to obtain more than one estimate of trivial and nontrivial closure phases due to duplications among the stations .",
    "the closure phases obtained in the low and high bands should be identical , since the fractional frequency difference between the observing bands is very small .",
    "closure phases on , e.g. , the fps ( lcp ) and gjt ( rcp ) triangles should be identical , since sgr  a * exhibits almost no circular polarization at these frequencies @xcite .",
    "similarly , simultaneous closure phases on pairs of triangles that share the same sites but with different stations ( e.g. , dps and fps ) should provide measurements of the same value . as expected , the pairwise differences of substantially identical closure phases are consistent with a unit gaussian distribution centered on zero when the differences are normalized by the quadrature sum of the errors of the closure phases ( bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ fig - consistency ] ) .",
    "this also provides evidence that the closure phase errorbars are correctly estimated .",
    "in total we detect 181 unique nontrivial closure phases for sgr  a * on the california - hawaii - arizona triangle .",
    "we additionally detect 233 trivial closure phases . detected",
    "scan - averaged closure phases are listed in table  [ data - table ] .",

    "the sign and approximate value of the closure phase are consistent among multiple observing epochs over four years . in this section",
    "we consider the implications of these results .",

    "therefore , visibility phase or closure phase information is required to break the 180  degeneracy .",
    "the @xmath24128  direction is consistent in sign with our measured closure phases .",
    "adding the new closure phase data is likely to result in better estimates of model parameters and to provide stronger constraints on models , including those that allow for deviations from general relativity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the detection of nonzero but small closure phases in the image of sgr  a * demonstrates the power of imaging observations in placing strong constraints on its accretion flow geometry .",
    "in particular , the data favor emission morphologies that are connected rather than those composed of disjoint regions at horizon scales . at this point , it is instructive to look at the images generated in different general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic ( grmhd ) simulations in order to explore in more detail how our observations can be used to constrain various configurations that are physically plausible and are consistent with all other currently available data .",
    "the parameters of grmhd simulations are typically calibrated in order to reproduce the broadband spectrum of sgr  a * as well as the overall size of its emitting region at 1.3  mm . even with these constraints imposed ,",
    "however , the images they generate can be quite different from each other , depending on the prescription for the plasma thermodynamics that was employed as well as on the initial magnetic field configuration and tilt of the torus that was used to feed the black hole .    in a set of simulations referred to by @xcite as standard and normal evolution ( sane ) , the magnetic flux remains modest ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if the electron temperature is assumed to be at a constant ratio with the ion temperature everywhere in the flow , the generated images typically show continuous crescent - like brightness distributions @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "if the electrons in the jet are allowed to be heated much more strongly than within the disk , the images are characterized by bright regions from the inner walls of the jets , dissected by the cooler accretion disks @xcite .",
    "the relative brightness of the two regions ( and their exact shape ) depends on the inclination of the observer .",
    "images with even more disjoint bright regions arise in magnetically arrested disk simulations ( mad in the terminology of @xcite ; see also @xcite and @xcite for similar magnetically dominated simulations and their applications to eht observations of m87 ) and are dominated by emission from the footpoints of the jets @xcite .",
    "finally , images with separated bright regions arise naturally in grmhd simulations in which the accreting material is fed to the black hole from a plane that has a tilt with respect to the black - hole spin @xcite because of the presence of standing shocks in these flows .",
    "comparing the detailed predictions of these simulations to our data is beyond the scope of the current paper .",
    "however , motivated by the rather general properties of the disjoint geometries in the images exhibited by some of the grmhd simulations , we discuss below how the observations reported here can be used to constrain such configurations .",
    "the gross characteristics of the jet - dominated images with disjoint bright regions described above ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) can be captured by a simple geometric model composed of two separated regions that are symmetric and identical except for a difference in the brightness of each component .",
    "the closure phases of such a configuration will be equivalent to an even more reduced model in which the two regions are replaced with point sources . in this reduced model ,",
    "the visibilities are analytically calculable as @xmath27 , where @xmath28 represents the amplitude ratio of the two components , and @xmath29 and @xmath30 refer to their separation east and north , respectively .",

    "these separations would produce california - hawaii - arizona closure phases that are between @xmath31  and @xmath32 , the range of values implied by the best - fit line in figure  [ cphase - vs - gst ] , at all gst times for which we have measured closure phases .",
    "both @xmath33 ( one point source ) and @xmath34 ( two equal point sources ) are inconsistent with our data , since each would produce closure phases that are identically zero or @xmath35 . for a separation comparable to the shadow diameter ,",
    "the closure phase data imply that a disconnected two - component model would be oriented roughly east - west with the brighter component located to the west ( figure  [ two - point - sources ] ) .",
    "if the emission from sgr  a * is coming from the footpoints of a mad - type jet , this is inconsistent with the orientations of the @xcite jet or @xcite clockwise disk ( see extended discussion in @xcite ) but aligned with the preferred axis of the intrinsic emission at 7  mm @xcite .",
    "closure phase measurements at 86 ghz already rule out asymmetric jet structures on larger angular scales from a few hundred microarcseconds to a few milliarcseconds @xcite .",
    "the closure phase on the california - hawaii - arizona triangle is consistent in sign and magnitude , to within measurement error , from day to day .",
    "these observations span a 4-year timescale that is much longer than the orbital period at the innermost stable circular orbit , which ranges from a few minutes to about half an hour depending on the spin of the black hole .",
    "it is also larger than the lense - thirring precession timescale for a tilted accretion disk unless the effective outer accretion flow radius is very large or the black hole spin is very small @xcite .",
    "misalignment of the spin axes of the accretion disk and black hole could produce two different observational consequences .",
    "first , it is possible that the inner disk could have a stable but slowly precessing structure .",
    "examination of each epoch of the data in the context of disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or geometric crescent models @xcite may be able to place limits on the amount of precession .",
    "second , misalignment could result in multiple bright regions in the accretion flow due to standing shocks .",
    "grmhd simulations of the accretion flow find that the separation between these regions is comparable to the diameter of the photon ring , although the emission pattern can be quite complicated in general @xcite . since the standing shocks can travel faster than the lense - thirring precession speed , the accretion flow would be expected to have substantially different structure in different years and very likely on different days within each year . the predicted closure phases over the course of a day on the california - hawaii - arizona triangle for the 515h model of @xcite mimic the rough range of closure phases observed , including a general trend of increasing value with gst .",
    "further study is required to determine whether such a model predicts excess variability in closure phases and long - baseline amplitudes beyond what is observed .",
    "the increased sensitivity of the eht in upcoming years will be helpful for examining variability on intraday timescales .",
    "the discovery of the g2 gas cloud on an orbit with a close approach to sgr  a * @xcite sparked interest in the possibility that the accretion rate of sgr  a * would increase due to the introduction of additional material into the accretion flow .",
    "most of the material in g2 did not pass through pericenter until after the final epoch of observations reported herein @xcite , and mounting evidence suggests that g2 contains a star and is therefore not a pure gas cloud @xcite .",
    "in any case , the infall timescale is on the order of years @xcite , so it would not be expected for there to be observational signatures of the g2 event in these data .",
    "however , there is evidence that g2 is a knot in a larger gas streamer that also includes the g1 gas cloud , which reached pericenter in the middle of 2001 @xcite .",
    "if so , the accretion flow of sgr  a * could be supplemented with material from g1 or other gas in the streamer , with the caveat that some of the material deposited in the outer accretion flow may be carried away by outflows rather than making it to the inner region traced by the 1.3  mm emission @xcite .",
    "the consistency of closure phases across multiple epochs from 2009 through 2013 provides evidence against large changes in the accretion rate over this period , consistent with the results of radio and millimeter - wavelength monitoring during the g2 encounter @xcite .",
    "the grmhd simulations of @xcite are instructive .",
    "when the accretion rate is decreased , the effective size of the accretion region decreases , with the result that the hawaii - arizona and hawaii - california baselines do not adequately resolve the 1.3  mm emission region , causing the predicted closure phases to drop very close to zero . as the accretion rate",
    "is increased , the effective size of the emission region becomes larger , producing larger closure phases as the fringe spacing of the hawaii - arizona and hawaii - california baselines becomes better matched to the asymmetric emission region .",
    "these larger closure phases persist even at the largest accretion rates modelled by @xcite , where the shadow of the emission region is obscured by the high optical depth of the accretion flow .",
    "this behavior is also seen when the accretion rate of the @xcite radiatively inefficient accretion flow models is varied .",
    "the average california - hawaii - arizona closure phase may therefore provide information complementary to visibility amplitudes in determining the overall accretion rate of the sgr  a * system .",
    "scattering in the tenuous plasma of the interstellar medium affects the image of sgr  a * at radio wavelengths .",
    "the biggest effect of this scattering is to blur the image of sgr  a * , causing its apparent size to vary approximately as the square of the observing wavelength ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and many others ) .",
    "a secondary effect of scattering is to introduce variable substructure within the scattered image @xcite .",
    "both of these effects can modify vlbi observables .",
    "the formalism of @xcite and @xcite distinguishes between three different regimes of scattering . in the snapshot regime ,",
    "diffractive scattering from small - scale inhomogeneities dominates . in the average regime , diffractive scattering",
    "is quenched , but refractive scintillation from large - scale inhomogeneities persists . in the ensemble - average regime , both diffractive and refractive scintillation are suppressed , and the scattering produces a deterministic blurring of the image . due to the intrinsic size of sgr  a * as well as the integration time and bandwidth used in vlbi observations , the average regime is applicable to eht observations of sgr  a * over the course of a single night .",
    "the ensemble of many nights of observations will tend statistically toward the ensemble - average regime , in which the observed visibilities are the intrinsic visibilities downweighted by a real gaussian whose width in baseline space is inversely related to the size of the scattering ellipse . in the ensemble - average regime ,",
    "the effects of scattering  blurring of the image  are invertible and do not affect closure phases @xcite",
    ".    however , in the average regime , image distortions and refractive substructure can introduce nonclosing phases .",
    "the magnitude of these effects may be up to 50  mjy in the visibility domain , with peak effect at baselines near the length at which the ensemble - average visibility of a point source falls to @xmath36 @xcite",
    ". this could be as large as a 10% effect on top of source visibilities of approximately 500  mjy on the baselines between hawaii and the mainland us @xcite , corresponding to a phase noise of @xmath37 .",
    "however , this refractive phase noise will be partially correlated when the antennas are located within a few thousand kilometers of each other , so the net effect on closure phases on the california - hawaii - arizona triangle will be smaller .",
    "because refractive phase noise will fluctuate randomly about zero on timescales of about 1 day @xcite , it can not account for the nonzero closure phases that we measure , which show a strong tendency to be positive . nor can refractive phase noise account for the dependence of closure phase on gst .",
    "thus , our measurements are a secure indication of intrinsic source asymmetry and do not merely reflect scattering - induced asymmetrical substructure .",
    "however , refractive variations may contribute to smaller interday variations in closure phase .",
    "further observations at a range of wavelengths will be required to characterize the properties of the turbulent scattering screen and better understand its contribution to the apparent variability of sgr  a*.",
    "we have obtained 181 measurements of the closure phase at 1.3  mm on the california - hawaii - arizona triangle from 2009 to 2013 .",
    "the median closure phase is nonzero at high statistical significance .",
    "this provides the first direct evidence that the structure of the 1.3  mm emission region is asymmetric on spatial scales comparable to the diameter of the shadow around the black hole that is predicted by general relativity .",
    "if the 1.3  mm emission arises from a mad - like jet whose emission is concentrated in two disjoint bright regions separated by the shadow diameter , our data place a very strong constraint on its orientation .",
    "the data also provide important constraints for parameters of other outflow and accretion models of sgr  a*.    the constancy of the sign of the closure phase argues for the persistence of asymmetric quiescent structure in sgr  a * likely coupled with some structural variability , consistent with simulations of a dynamic , spin - aligned accretion disk . while it is not currently possible to entirely disentangle the effects of variability in the structure of the emitting material around sgr  a * from apparent substructure introduced by variations in the scattering screen , the california - hawaii - arizona closure phases indicate that refractive phase noise is not dominant on baselines between hawaii and the western us .",
    "these results are encouraging for producing an image of the quiescent emission by averaging several nights of data to mitigate intrinsic source variability and refractive substructure @xcite .",
    "closure phase measurements will soon provide much stronger constraints on source structure . in the near term , eht observations in 2015 and beyond will incorporate additional observatories , including the large millimeter telescope in mexico , providing closure phase data on new triangles with higher angular resolution .",
    "increasing data rates , starting with dual - polarization 2  ghz observations in 2015 , will provide increased sensitivity that will result in larger detection rates and smaller random errors on each closure phase measurement , allowing interday and intraday variability to be tracked more accurately .",
    "completion of the 1.3  mm vlbi array  including phased alma @xcite , the south pole telescope , the iram 30-m telescope at pico veleta , and the northern extended millimeter array at plateau de bure  will produce very sensitive data with good baseline coverage , culminating in the ability to reconstruct model - independent images of sgr  a * , m87 , and other sources @xcite .",

    "there are many places where potential errors may be introduced into vlbi data , including real - world imperfections in the signal chain and inaccuracies in the input model for correlation .",

    "we consider potential sources of error from both theoretical and empirical perspectives .",
    "for the latter , we appeal to the data themselves to characterize potential biases .",
    "in addition to the sgr  a * data reported in this manuscript , two other sources from the 2013 observations provide high - s / n data to test whether potential sources of error introduce measurable biases into closure phase measurements . the source with",
    "the largest correlated flux density on long baselines in 2013 was bl  lac , for which a long series of consecutive scans on day 086 provides a large sample with high bispectral s / n on all triangles , often exceeding 100 on the fps and gjt triangles .",
    "another bright source that was observed over five nights in 2013 , 3c  279 , shows evidence of high polarization and complicated polarimetric structure on long baselines .",
    "we use data from these sources to estimate an upper limit of the magnitude of potential biases by considering matched pairs of simultaneously measured closure phases from two different data subsets ( rcp vs.  lcp , high band vs.  low band , etc . ) on both nontrivial and trivial triangles .",
    "each telescope uses a hydrogen maser as its timing and frequency standard .",
    "the maser signal is very stable over timescales of minutes but usually exhibits a slow drift over longer timescales .",
    "the difference between a one pulse - per - second ( pps ) signal from the maser and a pps signal from the global positioning system ( gps ) is logged over time , from which a time offset and drift rate are calculated .",
    "these parameters serve as inputs to the model used for correlation .",
    "the correlator model also takes as inputs the locations of the telescopes and the celestial coordinates of the source .",
    "the location of each telescope , including the phase center of the phased arrays , has been measured with gps .",
    "errors on the order of centimeters to tens of centimeters may be possible due to a combination of gps measurement errors and continental drift .",
    "source coordinates are obtained from longer - wavelength vlbi catalogues and automatically corrected for precession .",
    "however , these coordinates may contain errors on the order of milliarcseconds , and in any case the centroid of emission at 1.3  mm may be different from that measured at a longer wavelength due both to frequency - dependent source structure and to intrinsic source variability .    because of these effects , as well as a rapidly varying atmosphere , the a priori correlator parameters are close , though not perfectly correct , for modelling the delay and rate of a fringe .",
    "fringe finding is required post - correlation in order to find residual delays and rates to compensate for errors in the model . however , the total quantities ( delay and rate ) , the sum of the model and residual quantities , are independent of the input model provided that the a priori model was within the effective correlator search windows ( set by the accumulation period and spectral resolution ) .",
    "thus , small station - based clock and position errors would not be expected to introduce biases into the closure phases calculated later in postprocessing .",
    "the receivers on the eht telescopes were set up to receive left and right circularly polarized emission from the sky . since no feed or polarizer ( such as a quarter - wave plate ) is perfect , a system set up to receive lcp will nevertheless detect a small portion of rcp emission , and vice versa .",

    "the field rotation angle depends on the mount of the telescope and the location of the receiver ; for some eht telescopes it is equal to the parallactic angle , and for others it is the parallactic angle plus or minus the elevation angle .",

    "this is not large enough for our measured median closure phase of @xmath48 to be attributable to polarization leakage .",
    "leakages vary as the _ sum _ of the field rotation angles of the stations on each baseline , with effects on rcp and lcp closure phases that are approximately symmetric but opposite in sign .    assuming the median baseline - dependent polarization fractions and average polarization angles measured for sgr  a * in 2013 as well as the @xmath40-terms derived during instrumental polarization calibration , the typical biases expected to be introduced by polarization leakage are @xmath49 over most of an observing track , with a maximum effect of about @xmath50 .",

    "the closure phase is the argument of the product of three visibilities .",
    "denoting gain - corrected source quantities ( bracketed terms in equation  ( [ pol - equations ] ) ) by @xmath52 $ ] , the measured closure phase is @xmath53[r_2r_3^*][r_3r_1^*]\\right ) \\nonumber \\\\            & = &   \\arg\\left([r_1r_2^*][r_2r_3^*][r_3r_1^*]\\right).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , station - based , frequency - independent complex gain errors do not introduce additional closure phase errors beyond those already present due to polarization leakage .",
    "hops provides partial mitigation of bandpass effects .",
    "the amplitude of each station is automatically normalized to the autocorrelation response on a per - channel level .",
    "this can theoretically still result in small errors when the autocorrelation response does not match the desired crosscorrelation response  for instance , if the if response reduces sensitivity to sky signals near the edge of the band , or if subchannel structure in the bandpass response is significant .",
    "eht telescopes do not have a pulse calibration system to align the phases of each channel .",
    "instead , the eht data reduction uses manual instrumental phase calibration on very bright sources to derive phase offsets to apply to each channel on a per - station basis .",
    "the signal for all frequencies within each 480  mhz band passes through the same chain of electronics before being sampled by a single backend . as a result , the manual phases required to flatten the phase structure of the bandpass vary smoothly across the band .",
