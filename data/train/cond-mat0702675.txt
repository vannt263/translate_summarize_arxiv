    "when subject to vertical vibrations granular materials can produce a variety of distinct phenomena , depending both on the driving parameters and on the container properties .",
    "a great deal of interest has been recently raised by the process of compaction under successive vertical taps   @xcite .",
    "experiments  @xcite show that the density of a column of grains submitted to vertical tapping increases slowly in time with a law well fitted by a stretched exponential  @xcite or logarithmic function  @xcite , and that the characteristic compaction time grows abruptly as the driving intensity decreases .",
    "these observations have suggested an analogy with glass - forming systems , where the relaxation time diverges as the temperature is decreased ; the analogy is corroborated by the fact that concepts like frustration and free volume , which are commonly used to explain the slow dynamics of supercooled liquids and other thermal systems , do also provide an insight in the physics of powder compaction   @xcite .",
    "however , contrary to supercooled liquids , granular materials are non - thermal systems as their typical energy scale , the energy required to rise a grain of its own diameter against gravity , is orders of magnitude larger than the thermal energy @xmath0 : each granular pack is in a mechanically stable state , which last as long as there is no external perturbation .",
    "therefore even though the dynamics induced by a sequence of vertical taps becomes slower and slower as the tapping intensity decreases , important qualitative differences may exist between slow granular dynamics and glassy dynamics .    here",
    "we investigate analogies and differences between granular dynamics and glassy dynamics by performing molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations of a granular system subject to a sequence of vertical taps where , in order to explore a wide range of volume fractions , the system is tapped via flow pulses as in the experiment of schr@xmath1ter _ et .",
    "we investigate the evolution of macroscopic quantities ( volume fraction ) , mesoscopic quantities ( vorono volumes , force distributions ) and microscopic quantities ( grain displacements ) , and we discuss how various static properties of a granular pack change during compaction  @xcite .",
    "we found severals analogies between the compation of granular media , and the slow dynamics of glass forming systems  @xcite , as the divergence of the relaxation times , dynamical heterogeneities and spatially correlated motion ; but we also show evidences of important qualitative differences , as in the role of the cage motion , which are put in evidence by the study of particle trajectories .    the paper is organized as follows . sec .",

    "the former is given by the spring - dashpot model , while the latter is implemented by keeping track of the elastic shear displacement throughout the lifetime of a contact  @xcite .",
    "the model is the one described in @xcite with a restitution coefficient , @xmath8 .",
    "we use the linear model insted of the more realistic hertzian model  @xcite as this latter is characterized by a coefficient of restitution which goes to zero as the relative velocity of the impacting particles decreases  @xcite .",
    "this feature makes computationally expensive the simulation of a granular system reaching a mechanically stable state .",
    "the system is immersed in a fluid and , starting from a random configuration , it is subject to a dynamics made of a sequence of flow pulses where the fluid flows through the grains ( see fig.[f_model ] ) , as in the experiment of ref.@xcite . in a single pulse",
    "the flow velocity , directed against gravity , is @xmath9 for a time @xmath10 ; then the fluid comes to rest .",

    "as this motion is decorrelated on short and long times , the susceptibility show a well defined maximum at a given time .",
    "unfortunately we can not follow this line here as many averages are needed in order to get clear data on the fluctuations , and our simulations are computationally too expensive .",
    "moreover during compaction the system is not in a stationary state . in order to measure the degree of spatally heterogeneous dynamics we have therefore used a different method , based on the comparison between our system and a random one , as discussed below .",
    "we apply @xmath125 flow pulses ( @xmath126 ) to our system ( who reaches volume fraction @xmath127 ) and we determine the @xmath128 particle having experienced the largest displacement during the last tap . here",
    "@xmath129 , were @xmath130 is the total number of particles , @xmath131 and @xmath132 . when these fast particles are drawn , as in fig .",
    "[ f_etero ] , it is apparent that they form clusters , an clear evidence of the spatially heterogeneous dynamics .",
    "we have quantified the degree of heterogeneity of the system as follows .",
    "after every tap we have determined the @xmath128 faster particles of the system , and determined the number @xmath133 of couples of these particles made of neighboring particles ( we consider two particles to be neighbor if the distance between their center is smaller than @xmath134 particle diameters ) .",
    "then we have computed the same quantity @xmath135 in the case of @xmath128 randomly selected particles of the system .",
    "a measure of the degree of spatial heterogeneous dynamics is given by @xmath136    clearly @xmath137 for an homogeneous systems , @xmath138 if faster particles form clusters , while @xmath139 if faster particles tend to be apart .",
    "[ f_etero_2 ] shows the evolution of @xmath140 with the number of taps . in all cases",
    "@xmath138 , signaling the presence of an heterogeneous dynamics .",
    "when the system approaches the steady state , and compaction stops , @xmath140 fluctuates around a plateau which varies with @xmath141 between @xmath142 and @xmath143 .",
    "these are very high values , indicating a high degree of spatial heterogeneity of the system .",
    "( color online ) granular compaction is characterized by a spatially heterogeneous dynamics .",
    "this is quantified by the parameter @xmath140 ( see eq.[eq - hetero ] ) which is plotted here as a function of the number of taps for @xmath144 and @xmath132 ( from top to bottom ) . ]",
    "( color online ) the mean displacement @xmath145 of particle during a single tap increases with its vorono volume @xmath60 .",
    "the displacements are measured during tap @xmath61 and @xmath62 , when the volume fraction of the system is @xmath127 . ]",
    "it is well known than many equilibrium and transport properties of dense fluids depend on the space available for molecular motion .",
    "for instance the well known _",
    "free volume _ theory developed by choen and turnbull  @xcite to explain the divergence ( with a vogel - tamman - fulcher law ) of the relaxation time of many glass formers as the temperature is decreased , is based on the idea that the space available for molecular motion decreases with the temperature .",
    "it is therefore interesting to check for correlations between the displacement of a particle and its free volume in our granular system .",
    "there are many possible way to define the free volume of a particle . here",
    "we approximate , for simplicity sake , we consider the free volume of particle @xmath37 to be @xmath146 , where @xmath65 is the vorono volume of the particle ( see sec .",
    "[ sec - voronoi ] ) before the application of a tap , and @xmath147 its volume .",
    "the displacement @xmath148 of particle @xmath37 ( @xmath149 ) is the distance between the position of the particle before and after the application of the tap .",
    "a possible connection between @xmath150 and @xmath148 is suggested by the similarity between the the probability distribution functions of vorono volumes ( see fig .",
    "[ f_voronoi].a ) , and that of particles displacemets ( fig .",
    "[ f_pd ] ) .",
    "both of them have an exponential tail at high values .",
    "moreover they evolve in a qualitatively similar way ( the variance and the mean value decrease ) as the system compactifies .    in order to test this possible correlation we have computed during the @xmath89th tap ( @xmath90 ) ( @xmath22 s , @xmath54 cm / s ) the mean value of the displacement @xmath145 of all the particles with free volume @xmath151 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath145 on @xmath151 is shown in fig .",
    "[ f_corr_vol_dis ] .",
    "this figure puts in evidence the existence of an almost linear correlation between vorono volumes and particle displacements , with @xmath152 @xmath153 : the larger the vorono volume of a particle , the bigger its displacement .",
    "( color online ) the mean displacement @xmath145 of a grain as a function of its compressional force .",
    "when the packing is loose grains with higher compressional forces move less . as the granular pack compactifies",
    "the displacement of a particle appears not to depend on its compression . ]    in the previous paragraph we have shown that there is a correlation between the displacement @xmath145 of a particle during a single tap , and its free volume .",
    "[ f_corr_for_dis ] investigates the correlation between displacement and compression @xmath75 ( see eq .",
    "[ eq - compression ] ) of a particle .",
    "the figure puts in evidence that for small values of the compressional force there is a decreasing linear relation between displacement and compression of a particle , while for higher value of the compressional force the two becomes uncorrelated .",
    "we have reported results of a numerical simulations of a packing of monosize spheres submitted to vertical taps made of flow pulses as in the experiment of ref .",
    "our results relative to the dynamics of the systems confirms earlier experimental observation : as the intensity of vibration decreases both the value of the volume fraction reached at stationary and the compaction time increases  @xcite .",
    "the increase of the compaction time with the decreasing of the vibration intensity is dramatic as this appears to diverge with a power law when the fluid velocity goes to zero .",
    "the analysis of the evolution of several structural quantities during compaction has revealed that this is not accompanied by any particular geometrical modification . the radial distribution function and the vorono volume distribution , for instance , smoothly change as the density of the granular system increases .",
    "in particular the collapse of the vorono volume distributions ( sec .  [ sec - voronoi ] ) evidences the presence of a single underlying geometrical structure in the system . also , the probability distribution function of normal forces between grains do not change during compaction .",
    "the analysis of the dynamics of compaction has revealed that this is characterized by dynamical heterogeneities .",
    "the probability that , during a tap , a particle makes a given displacement decreases exponentially with its size , resembling observations made in dense colloidal systems  @xcite .",
    "similarly we have observed that , during a tap , faster particle tend to form cluster , as observed both in colloidal  @xcite and in glass - forming  @xcite systems .",
    "there is , however , a marked difference between a typical trajectory of a granular particle during compaction , and a typical trajectory of a particle in supercooled liquids .",
    "precisely , in supercooled liquids a particle spend most of time in cages formed by its neighbors , and occasionally makes large displacement escaping from the cage . in our system , instead",
    ", particles usually diffuse , and sometimes are trapped in a cage .",
    "this different behaviour is due to the particular driving of our system as in our system , when the the flow in on the system expands and the grains are able to escape from their cages .    as the slowdown of the dynamics is related to the space available for particle motion , we have studied the correlation between the displacement of particle during a tap and its vorono volume , which is a rough estimate of its free volume .",
    "this analysis has shown that particles with larger vorono volumes are those who make larger displacements during a tap .",
