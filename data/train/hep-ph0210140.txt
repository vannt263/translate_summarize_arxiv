    "in contrast to the quark sector cp violation in the lepton sector can be potentially large .",
    "this has spurred great interest in the possible measurement of the leptonic dirac - type cp - phase @xmath2 especially in the context of a planed neutrino factory  @xcite .",
    "the principal observable is the cp - odd probability difference @xmath3 . since the neutrinos travel a long distance trough the earth matter one has to include matter effects .",
    "the earth is however cp - asymmetric by itself , thus it introduces a non - vanishing @xmath4 even if @xmath5 .",
    "this makes it difficult to use @xmath4 as measure of @xmath2 .",
    "furthermore there are , due to the form of the oscillation probabilities , strong correlations among several oscillation parameters . besides that a long baseline experiment does not measure the probabilities themselves but event rates .",
    "there are many systematical uncertainties in translating a rate measurement into a measurement of the probability .",
    "in addition to those problems the oscillation probabilities allow for different sets of parameters which give approximately the same probabilities .",
    "this is known as the degeneracy problem . in observing only the transition between electron and muon neutrinos or anti - neutrinos there",
    "remain three possible degeneracies : the @xmath6 ambiguity  @xcite , the @xmath7 degeneracy  @xcite and the @xmath8 degeneracy  @xcite .",
    "those degeneracies can have a substantial impact on the ability of a given experiment to reach its physics goals .",
    "the results shown in the following are a small subset of the results obtained in  @xcite .",
    "the setups considered are listed in table  [ tab : setups ] .",
    "further details can be found in  @xcite .",
    ".[tab : setups ] definition of experimental setups . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     of all the systematical errors considered in  @xcite the most important for the jhf setups is the background normalization uncertainty , whereas the nufact setups are in general little hindered by systematical errors .    in",
    "@xcite a complete analysis of the multi parameter correlations was performed , taking into account external information on @xmath1 provided by kamland and on the matter density provided by geophysics . for @xmath1",
    "an error of @xmath9 and for the matter density an error of @xmath10 is assumed .",
    "the biggest source of correlation errors for all setups is the correlation between @xmath11 and @xmath2 .",
    "this is an intrinsic effect which is very hard to fight . for",
    "the nufact scenarios the matter density plays a crucial rule and one should seek to improve the knowledge on this quantity .",
    "the @xmath8 degeneracy has only little impact on the determination of @xmath2 in all cases .",
    "the influence of the @xmath6 ambiguity is strongest at a nufact and its effects strongly depend on subtle details of the expected detector performance , a detailed discussion is given in appendix b of  @xcite . the @xmath7 degeneracy however has a substantial effect on the ability to determine @xmath2 , especially at a nufact it may be rather cumbersome . in figure  [ fig : cpv ] the cp violation reach in the @xmath0-@xmath1 plane is shown for all four setups including degeneracies , correlations , systematics and backgrounds .",
    "the trench in the left hand panel for the nufact - ii case is due to the @xmath7 degeneracy .",
    "one possibility among many others  @xcite to resolve the correlation between @xmath2 and @xmath11 and to break the @xmath6 ambiguity is to use the so called `` magic baseline '' .",
    "the condition for the magic baseline is given by @xmath12  @xcite , this gives for earth densities a baseline @xmath13 .",
    "at this special distance all terms in the appearance probability proportional to @xmath1 and @xmath14 vanish identically for all energies and values of @xmath15 , _",
    "i.e. _ the appearance probability reduces to the one in a two neutrino case .",
    "thus all correlations and degeneracies connected to @xmath2 disappear .",
    "the sensitivity to @xmath0 at baselines of @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the dark grey shading indicates the impact of systematics , the medium grey shading the impact of the correlations and the light grey shading stands for the effect of degeneracies.,width=188 ]    the drawback of this very long baseline is that the event rates decrease .",
    "but in figure  [ fig : magic ] it is clearly visible that the gain in sensitivity by avoiding the effects of @xmath2 ( rightmost edge ) is much larger than the effects of the diminished statistics ( leftmost edge ) , thus the sensitivity is increased by one order of magnitude .",
    "in vacuum the cp - odd and t - odd probability differences are identical .",
    "this does not hold in matter . in principle",
    "it is therefore possible that matter profile asymmetries introduce a fake cp violation and increase the error in the measurement of @xmath2 .",
    "however in  @xcite it is shown that , for in terrestial experiments conceivable matter asymmetries , this effects turns out to be negligibly small .",
    "cpt violation would manifest itself in a neutrino oscillation experiment by the presence of two different @xmath18 scales or mixing angles for neutrinos and anti - neutrinos . thus in order to estimate the sensitivity of a neutrino factory to cpt violation one just needs to evaluate the level of accuracy which can be obtained in the measurement of @xmath15 and @xmath19 . at a standard nufact",
    "relative asymmetries in the mass splittings of order @xmath20 and in the mixing angles in the order of @xmath21 could be detected , as it is shown in  @xcite ."
