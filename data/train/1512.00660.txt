    "late - time accelerated expansion of the universe has been confirmed by several independent observations @xcite . in order to explain the accelerated expansion , we need to include new energy sources , which are known as the dark energy ( de ) .",
    "the simplest example of the de is the cosmological constant @xmath1 .",
    "furthermore , by including the cold dark matter ( cdm ) besides the standard model ( sm ) particles , we obtain the well - known @xmath1cdm model , which successfully describes the current epoch of the universe .",
    "the @xmath1cdm model is , however , merely one of the phenomenological models , and from the theoretical point of view , it suffers from several theoretical problems .",
    "for example , we need to theoretically explain the very large disagreement between the theoretically estimated values of cosmological constant and the observational value , and the ratio of ordinary matters and cdm with respect to de in the current epoch .",
    "since one may regard that the inclusion of the cosmological constant could be a minimal extension of the general relativity , we can also consider the other extensions of the general relativity and investigate the possibility that these extended theories could describe the real universe .",
    "as non - minimal extensions of the general relativity to explain the current expansion without cosmological constant , the modified gravitational theories have been proposed and investigated well ( for review , see , for instance , @xcite ) . in order to establish such a new gravitational theory ,",
    "it is important to study the cosmological models and compare them with the observational data .",
    "we should note that the modified gravitational theories could be also constrained by the astrophysical observations , for example , those of the compact stars .",
    "recently , massive and compact neutron stars whose mass is @xmath2 ( @xmath3 is the solar mass ) were found @xcite .",
    "it could be hardly understood in the framework of the general relativity and hadron physics so far if one uses the stellar matter equations of state which are comfortable in astrophysics and hadron physics .",
    "thus , there could be two points of view to explain the massive neutron stars : one is from particle physics side which requires not - well justified phenomenological change of equation of state and another is the gravitational physics side while using the convenient equation of state for stellar matter .",
    "the size of the compact objects is determined by the balance between degeneracy force and gravitational force . in order to explain the massive neutron star , three approaches seem to be reasonable : ( i ) the repulsive force is stronger than that is realized with the standard equations of state , ( ii ) the attractive force is weaker than that",
    "is predicted in the general relativity , ( iii ) we accept both cases ( i ) and ( ii ) simultaneously . from the point of view of ( i ) based on the hadron physics",
    ", it was suggested that equations of state could be modified by introducing the new interactions @xcite . from the point of view of ( ii ) based on the gravitational physics",
    ", it has been suggested that some models of @xmath0 gravity can explain the massive and compact neutron stars @xcite . in this work",
    ", we stand on the viewpoint of case ( ii ) , and study if the compact objects , quark stars and neutron stars , are realized and how the internal structure of compact objects is deviated from that in the general relativity if we assume the massive gravity coupled with the matter which is described by the standard equations of state .",
    "the de rham - gabadadze - tolley ( drgt ) massive gravity @xcite ( for review , see @xcite ) is the ghost - free theory with interacting massive spin-2 field .",
    "the basic idea of the massive spin-@xmath4 field theory was proposed by fierz and pauli in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the consistent free massive spin-@xmath4 theory was given by adding a tuned mass term to free massless spin-@xmath4 field theory on flat space - time was considered .",
    "it was , however , shown that the fierz - pauli theory can not recover the general relativity in the massless limit , due to so - called the van dam - veltman - zakharov ( vdvz ) discontinuity @xcite .",
    "after the discovery of the vdvz discontinuity , in order to avoid this problem , the fierz - pauli theory was extended to an interacting theory by replacing the kinetic terms with the ricci scalar . as a result , the vdvz discontinuity can be screened by a non - linear effect which is called the vainshtein mechanism @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the non - linear terms generate a ghost called the boulware - deser ( bd ) ghost @xcite .",
    "the problem of the bd ghost mode had been discussed for a long time , and the problem has been solved finally as the drgt massive gravity by introducing a new form of mass terms .    the drgt massive gravity is considered to be able to avoid the constraint from the solar system and terrestrial experiments thanks to the vainshtein mechanism , where the non - linear effects hide the extra degree of freedom coupled with the matter source . at the same time , the massive graviton leads to the modification of long - range gravitational force because the gravitational potential is modified to be the yukawa - type potential , where the scale of modification is characterized by that of graviton mass .",
    "thus , one may expect that the mass of massive graviton could be comparable to the cosmological constant , which could explain the accelerated expansion of the universe without introducing the cosmological constant @xcite .    as we regard the drgt massive gravity as an alternative theory of gravity , it is interesting to apply this theory to astrophysical phenomena as well as to the accelerated expansion of the universe",
    ". it is very difficult to construct the general framework which quantifies the deviations from the predictions of the general relativity in strong - gravity field because the non - perturbative effects depend on the detail of each theories and parametric treatment is not suitable @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it it significant if we could conclude that astrophysical and cosmological applications are compatible with observations in specific theory of modified gravity . from the above reasons , it is indispensable to study the compact objects in the drgt massive gravity in the same way as it was done in @xmath0 gravity , as astrophysical test of the massive gravity in strong - gravity regime .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we give a brief review of the drgt massive gravity and derive the equations of motion . in section iii , we consider the spherically - symmetric stellar metric and derive the tov equations in minimal model of the drgt massive gravity .",
    "it is shown that one constraint equation coming from the potential terms in the gravitational action appears .",
    "it leads to the explicit difference from the case of the general relativity . in section iv , we present the numerical analysis for the quark star and neutron star for some convenient equations of state . in particular , mass - central density and mass - radius relation are numerically analyzed . in section",

    "the radius of the star @xmath143 is defined by the condition @xmath144 ,    for solving the equation numerically , we treat the problem as initial - value problem at the center @xmath145 .",
    "we set two of the initial conditions as a value of central density and @xmath142 as before .",
    "but we should choose the value of @xmath146 such the last boundary condition is satisfied .",
    "so we optimize the value of @xmath146 ( shooting method ) .",
    "we should note that the only free parameter in our model is the graviton mass , and we assume @xmath147 because we use the drgt massive gravity .",
    "also , the graviton mass is constrained by the observation in solar system and should be small @xcite .    at first",
    ", we study the quark star , using the equation of state called the mit bag model @xcite .",
    "the equation of state is given by @xmath148 here , @xmath149 depends on the mass of strange quark @xmath150 , and @xmath151 if we choose @xmath152}$ ] .",
    "@xmath153 is called a bag constant which we fix as @xmath154 . then",
    ", we search @xmath140 which satisfies @xmath155 .",
    "note that the equation of state is linear , thus , we stop the calculation if @xmath141 gets negative and define @xmath143 as the point between @xmath156 and @xmath157 .",
    "we plot @xmath158-@xmath132 , @xmath158-@xmath159 relations in the general relativity ( blue line ) and the massive gravity ( orange line ) ( see figs .  [ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] ) . the total mass of the quark star is smaller than that in the general relativity .",
    "next , we study the neutron stars , using the equation of state called sly model @xcite .",
    "the equation of state is given by @xmath160 @xmath161 in this case , we utilize a function fitted to numerical points in sly model ( see fig .",
    "[ sly ] ) , which is valid if @xmath162}$ ] .",
    "we should note that the equation of state includes logarithmic function , and the radius is ill - defined if @xmath157 .",
    "therefore , in this case , we define the radius @xmath143 as @xmath163 and remove ill - defined points .",
    "we plot @xmath158-@xmath132 , @xmath158-@xmath159 relations ( see figs .  [ fig9 ] and [ fig10 ] ) , where we interpolate lines between plotted points after we remove the ill - behaved points .",
    "the region of total mass is narrow compared with the case in the general relativity , that is , massive neutron star can not be realized .",
    "we have investigated the relativistic stars in the drgt massive gravity which is non - linear theory of massive graviton .",
    "we assumed the perfect fluid in hydrostatic equilibrium with standard equation of state , and after we specified the parameters and reference metric and assumed that graviton mass is comparable with the cosmological constant , we derived the mass - central density and mass - radius profile for quark stars and neutron stars numerically .",
    "we have concluded that the tov equation is corrected by the term which is proportional to the graviton mass which results from the potential term of massive graviton in the action , and one constraint equation appears if we assume the conservation of energy - momentum tensor .",
    "the correction is very small if we consider the light graviton mass against massive object .",
    "the mass - radius relation is more constrained than that in the general relativity , and we have shown that the maximal mass gets smaller for quark star and neutron star . therefore , the compact massive neutron star can not be explained in this specific version of drgt massive gravity , which is in difference with @xmath0 gravity @xcite .",
    "however , the results of our work do not indicate that the drgt massive gravity should be excluded by the observation .",
    "indeed , we have assumed the standard equations of state to study the maximal mass as well as particular minimal version of massive gravity .",
    "it could be that the massive neutron star could be possible if we choose the different equations of state or consider more complicated version of massive gravity with more parameters .",
    "although the massive neutron star can not be realized , we could distinguish the drgt massive gravity from the general relativity .",
    "the mass - central density or mass - radius relation for the quark star shows that the deviation from the general relativity is very small .",
    "however , for the neutron star , quite important difference appears in the case of small and large radius .",
    "this may be an evidence to quantify the difference from the general relativity in strong - gravity regime .",
    "this deviation is considered to be derived from the constraint equation ( [ eq3 ] ) which relates the energy density and pressure inside the neutron star . on the same time",
    ", the effect of the mass term is very small , and it is given by the ratio between the graviton mass and neutron star mass @xmath164 .",
    "the mass term affects the geometry outside the star , and causes the accelerated expansion of the universe at large scales .",
    "note that the constraint does not depend on the mass of graviton .",
    "on the other hand , the neutron stars in @xmath0 gravity have been studied in order to test it in astrophysical phenomenology . in previous study ,",
    "the gravitational action is assumed to be @xmath165 , where the function @xmath166 is corresponding to the deviation from the general relativity .",
    "the mass - central density and mass - radius relation was studied as well as in our work , and it has been shown that , for specific function of @xmath166 , the massive neutron star whose mass @xmath167 is realized .    in this work , we did not studied all models of the drgt massive gravity because we fixed the free parameters @xmath11 and the reference metric @xmath7 .",
    "thus , we have two simple ways to generalize our work .",
    "first , one can change the parameters @xmath65 and @xmath66 in 2-parameter family of the drgt massive gravity .",
    "it means that the potential of massive graviton is changed and it would lead to the different mass - radius relation .",
    "second , we can change the reference metric from the minkowski to the other ones .",
    "as we mentioned , we have considered the specific class of the reference metric and formulated the modified tov equation .",
    "flat reference metric brings simple but non - trivial modification to the tov equation .",
    "the reference metric may be chosen in more general form , so that it may not be solution of equations of motion in general relativity . regarding the choice of the reference metric , we can also generalize our study to the massive bigravity theory which describes the interaction between the massless spin-@xmath4 field , corresponding to usual massless graviton , and massive spin-@xmath4 field @xcite ( for the @xmath0 gravity extension of the massive gravity , see @xcite ) . in bigravity ,",
    "the reference metric is dynamical and determined by the equation of motion , thus , we need not to fix the reference metric by hands .    finally , we make some remarks about the compact stars in the drgt massive gravity .",
    "the compact stars usually have a maximal mass , and then , the gravitational collapse to the black hole is inevitable .",
    "if the horizon is formed , the interaction terms diverge at the horizon because of @xmath13 .",
    "this singularity is not removable , therefore , the naked singularity appears .",
    "however , we do not know what happens after the gravitational collapse , precisely .    in the massive gravity , the basic equation forms as @xmath168 .",
    "for example , in the case of the schwarzschild metric , the einstein tensor is equal to zero , @xmath169 . if the energy - momentum tensor @xmath170",
    ", the interaction terms @xmath42 should be zero although these terms include non - trivial effect caused by @xmath13 except for the case that @xmath7 is proportional to the schwarzschild metric . for general space - time with horizon , if the interaction terms diverge at horizon , @xmath41 and/or @xmath44 should diverge although the strength of gravitational force , curvature , is finite at horizon , thus , the energy - density and pressure are also finite . from the view point of analogy to the classical mechanics ,",
    "the mass term is a potential of the metric , and the solution can not arrive at horizon if potential goes to positive infinity at horizon . for the above reasons , the metric with horizon may not be a solution .",
    "the drgt massive gravity has the cutoff scale @xmath171 where the ghost - mode caused by the higher derivatives is suppressed .",
    "@xmath171 depends on the graviton mass @xmath12 , and the cutoff scale is low if the graviton mass is small . in this work ,",
    "we have assumed @xmath172 , then , @xmath173}$ ] which is larger than the scale of compact stars .",
    "heavier massive graviton makes the cutoff scale higher , but it spoils the motivation to explain the late - time acceleration as modified gravity . if we accept the cosmological constant and heavy graviton mass , we can explain the relativistic stars and our numerical results do not change drastically because the correction is proportional to the ratio between graviton mass and massive star and it is still small .",
