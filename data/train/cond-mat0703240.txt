    "in 1983 , degroot and coworkers@xcite suggested that the electronic structure of the ferromagnetic half - heusler compound nimnsb possessed a curious characteristic ; at the fermi level , only states from one spin channel were populated ; the other spin channel was gapped .",
    "they called such compounds half - metallic ferromagnets .",
    "the half metallic nature of nimnsb has found experimental support from nulk measurement techniques such as positron annihilation.@xcite however , surface - sensitive techniques such as photoemission spectroscopy detect highly reduced spin polarization.@xcite the phenomena of half - metallicity has been identified as possessing a history that pre - dates nimnsb  for example in certain pyrite compounds@xcite and in certain chromium chalcospinels@xcite , as well as in the famous mixed - valent rare - earth manganites.@xcite    half - metallic ferromagnets are an important materials component in the emerging domain of spin - based electronics,@xcite and magnetic intermetallics deriving from heusler and half - heusler crystal structures have been the focus of much recent attention . both the half - heusler@xcite and heusler@xcite compounds obey certain simple electron counting rules that allow their saturation magnetic moments to be estimated from the number of valence electrons .",
    "one feature that emerges , particularly for the xyz half - heuslers@xcite is that covalency effects in parts of the structural network , specifically the yz zinc blende lattice , play a crucial role in maintaining the half - metallic gap across a wide range of valence electron counts .",
    "it is of interest to explore other equiatomic magnetic compounds with the general formula xyz that are compositionally related to the half - heusler structure but crystallize in other structures .",
    "for example , johnson and jeitschko explored a number of silicides and germanides@xcite in the series mn - pd - si and mn - pd - ge .",
    "baela@xcite has studied the magnetic properties of some related silicides and germanides without establishing the precise composition , assuming that the compounds were single phase .",
    "vernire _ _",
    "et al.__@xcite have reported the structure and magnetic properties of pdmnge by neutron diffraction experiments .",
    "eriksson__et al.__@xcite have described a cubic compound with the formula mn@xmath1pd@xmath2si@xmath3 in a filled mg@xmath4cu@xmath5si@xmath6 structure type with complex magnetic behavior , including non - collinear spin ordering .",
    "we thought it of interest to reexamine compounds in these systems in order to determine whether the hexagonal compounds are proximal to half - metallic ferromagnetism .",
    "here we report on two compounds which occur as single crystals with fe@xmath0p - derived structures in the pd - mn - si and pd - mn - ge phase diagrams .",
    "we have reproduced polycrystalline samples with the compositions established by the single crystal structural studies .",
    "this has allowed magnetic studies on these compounds .",
    "in addition , we have performed density functional calculations on a typical compound from the pd - mn - si system to better understand the nature of the magnetism .",
    "pd - mn - x ( x : si and ge ) compounds were prepared from high purity metals by arc melting in an ar atmosphere . a composition of 3:1:2 ( pd : mn : x ) was chosen for the preparation .",
    "the products obtained from arc melting were sealed in evacuated vitreous silica tubes and subsequently annealed first at 950@xmath7c for two days and then at 800@xmath7c for 5 to 10 days in order to improve the site ordering of the phases .",
    "crystals were picked from crushed products and subject to single crystal diffraction studies .",
    "the phase purity of powder samples were checked using a phillips ( xpert mpd , 45kv 40ma , cu - k@xmath8 radiation ) powder diffractometer , followed by rietveld refinement of the diffraction profiles .",
    "squid magnetization measurements were carried out in the temperature range 5 to 400k using a quantum design mpms 5xl squid magnetometer .",
    "zero field cooled ( zfc ) and field cooled ( fc ) magnetization as a function of temperature was at a constant field strength of 1000oe .",
    "in addition , isothermal @xmath9 traces were recorded at different temperatures .    a small crystal of size 0.12 @xmath10 0.07 @xmath10 0.06mm@xmath11 was picked from the pd - mn - si sample from a sample that also contained mnsi as a minority phase .",
    "x - ray diffraction intensities were collected on bruker ccd diffractometer ( mok@xmath12 radiation , @xmath13 = 0.71073 ) at room temperature .",
    "the measured intensities were corrected for lorentz and polarization effects and were further corrected for absorption using the sadabs program.@xcite the structure solution was obtained using the shelxs-97 program and refined using the shelxl-97 as implemented in shelxtl package using full - matrix least - squares refinement.@xcite the structure was solved in the space group @xmath14 ( no .",
    "the final refinement cycles used anisotropic displacement parameter and gave @xmath15 = 0.0264 for 130 unique reflections .",
    "there was no evidence for strong correlation between refined parameters and thermal displacement parameters behaved normally .",
    "the suggested sample composition was pd@xmath16mn@xmath17si .",
    "the crystals from the pd - mn - ge system were isolated from the sample consisting of pd@xmath18mnge@xmath19 as a second phase ( orthorhombic , @xmath20 , @xmath21 = 6.910(1) , @xmath22 = 3.146(1) , @xmath23 = 16.504(4).@xcite ) the majority of the sample consisted of the orthorhombic phase .",
    "several attempts were made to isolate good quality crystals of the orthorhombic phase to confirm the structure independently but these were unsuccessful .",
    "however , good quality crystals were found to have hexagonal symmetry . a crystal of size 0.10 @xmath10 0.075 @xmath10 0.06mm@xmath11 was selected for single crystal diffraction studies .",

    "figure2 shows rietveld refinement of the x - ray diffraction profile of pd@xmath16mn@xmath17si using the xnd rietveld code.@xcite the starting parameters and site occupancies were taken from single crystal data .",
    "the lattice parameters after refinement were @xmath21 = 6.5003(3) and @xmath23 = 3.4633(2) , in close agreement with the single crystal data .",
    "it is evident from the fit that the sample contains a noticeable amount of mnsi.@xcite in addition , the difference profile indicates the possibility of a very small of amount of a third phase pd@xmath19si , which we have not accounted for in the refinement .",
    "the occurrence of these second phases arises from the starting elemental ratios of pd : mn : si of 3:1:2 not matching with the ratio obtained for the single crystal , which is closer to 5:1:3 .",
    "johnson and jeitschko@xcite have suggested the possibility of obtaining single phase samples above 950@xmath7c.@xcite our effort to obtain single phase at 950@xmath7c by quenching the sample were not fruitful , and once again , the powder diffractogram revealed the presence of a second mnsi phase .",
    "we have studied the magnetic properties of two different samples in the pd - mn - si system , both whose x - ray diffraction patterns ( rietveld refined lattice parameters ) suggest compositions close to that determined by the single - crystal studies , namely pd@xmath16mn@xmath17si .",
    "the samples differ in the annealing conditions after arc - melting ; samples for which data are displayed in the left and right panels were annealed as reported in the figure caption .",
    "both samples are soft ferromagnets with curie temperatures above the 400k limit of our squid magnetometer .",
    "although the detailed behavior of @xmath50 _ vs. _",
    "@xmath51 for the two samples varies slightly , the nature of the @xmath50 _ vs. _ @xmath52 traces shown in panels ( b ) are quite similar , with a 5k saturation magnetization near 2.4@xmath53 per formula unit .",
    "the values reported by baela@xcite for the 3:1:2 composition are @xmath54 = 498 k and the saturation magnetization @xmath55 of 2.12@xmath53 .",
    "this strongly suggests that perhaps the composition in that case as well is closer to what we have observed in the single - crystal analysis .",
    "it is important to note that in these samples , the magnetic ion ( mn ) is relatively diluted and yet the curie temperature is quite high . because of the dilution , it is difficult to associate an integral magnetic moment to the composition , and therefore , it is difficult on the basis of the saturation magnetization alone to determine whether the compound is close to being a half - metal .",
    "the powder samples have a small , identifiable mnsi impurity .",
    "it is possible that the small downturn in the zfc trace figure3 , particularly in panel ( a ) is associated with the magnetic transition of mnsi , which is is an itinerant ferromagnet with a @xmath54 of 29.5k.@xcite    in order to better understand the origin of the magnetism , we have constructed a orthohexagonal supercell of the fe@xmath0p structure in the space group @xmath30 ( no .",
    "lmto densities of state deriving from the pure and mixed pd ; respectively the pd1 and m2 sites , and from mn are displayed separately for the two spin directions in the panels of figure4 .",
    "it is seen that the system is not half metallic since there are both pd and mn states in both spin directions .",
    "pd seem to have nearly filled d states , as in common for intermetallic compounds of pd with early transition elements.@xcite the mn states are strongly spin polarized suggesting local moment behavior in this relatively dilute magnetic compound .",
    "this local moment behavior is better visualized by plotting the spin density in the real space of the crystal structure .",
    "figure5 displays isosurfaces of spin for a value of 0.05@xmath56 .",
    "it is seen that the spins are well - localized on mn .",
    "in addition , figure5 shows the valence - only electron localization function plotted as a map of values on the rear plane of the unit cell in the level where si atoms are found .",
    "their is only somewhat spherical localization around the si and no notable localization on any of the internuclear axes suggesting that this phase can not be described using notions of local covalent bonding , unlike the half - heusler compounds.@xcite the absence of such covalent bonding can perhaps explain the absence of a half - metallic gap in the title compounds .",
    "the calculated magnetic moment per pd@xmath31mn@xmath32si@xmath0 is 1.53@xmath53 , somewhat smaller than the experimentally measured value of 2.2@xmath53 for pd@xmath16mn@xmath17si@xmath0 .",
    "the discrepancy could arise because the dft calculations are obliged to assume artificial ordering of mn and pd .",
    "when polycrystalline samples in the pd - mn - ge systems were prepared with starting pd : mn : ge ratios of 3:1:2 , the orthorhombic pd@xmath29mnge@xmath0@xcite phase was formed , always coexisting with a second hexagonal phase . when the starting composition was dictated by the single crystal structural analysis of the hexagonal phase , pure polycrystalline samples were obtained that could be subject to rietveld analysis of the x - ray powder diffraction patterns .",
    "the lattice parameters obtained from the rietveld analysis were @xmath21 = 6.7701(6) and @xmath23 = 3.3738(4) in good agreement with single crystal data .",
    "note that the reported lattice constants for equiatomic hexagonal pdmnge are @xmath21 = 6.6453(9) and @xmath23 = 3.36002(5),@xcite , suggesting a homogeneity range .",
    "magnetization as a function of temperature and as a function of field for polycrystalline pd@xmath26mn@xmath27ge is shown in figure7 . as a function of temperature under a 1000oe field",
    ", it is seen that magnetic ordering sets in near 360k .",
    "however , @xmath50 _ vs. _ @xmath52 traces do not show clear evidence for magnetic saturation , unlike the related silicide compounds , suggesting that while the polycrystalline samples seem phase - pure by x - ray diffraction , they may not be magnetically homogeneous . at 5k and 20koe ,",
    "the observed @xmath50 for pd@xmath26mn@xmath27ge is 0.85@xmath53 per formula unit .",
    "the values reported for equiatomic pdmnge ( @xmath54 = 541 k and @xmath55 = 3.5@xmath53 6k)@xcite are significantly different .",
    "however , the values we find are not very different from those determined for pd@xmath18mnge@xmath0 ( @xmath54 = 392k and @xmath55 = 1.60@xmath53).@xcite if our samples can be considered to be magnetically homogeneous , then it is possible that the lower @xmath54 and the lower @xmath55 are related simply to the smaller mn content .",
    "our interest in half - metallic ferromagnets deriving from the equiatomic half - heusler crystal structure have led us to explore new compounds in the pd - mn - si and pd - mn - ge systems .",
    "the compositions and structure of these compounds were established by single crystal methods , and magnetic studies were performed on polycrystalline samples prepared according to compositions dictated by the single crystal structure determination .",
    "the sequence of experiments suggests the importance of single crystal structure determinations in exploring new magnetic phases .",
    "the title compounds are not half - metallic , perhaps as a result of their not being derived from a covalent network with a tendency to semiconducting behavior .",
    "nevertheless , the silicide compound is interesting because it has a curie temperature significantly higher than the room temperature despite having a relatively low concentration of magnetic mn atoms ."
