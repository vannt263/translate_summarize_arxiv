    "<S> we investigate the problem of speciation and coexistence in simple ecosystems when the competition among individuals is included in the eigen model for quasi - species . by suggesting an analogy between the competition among strains and the diffusion of a chemical inhibitor in a reaction - diffusion system </S>",
    "<S> , the speciation phenomenon is considered the analogous of chemical pattern formation in genetic space . in the limit of vanishing mutation rate </S>",
    "<S> we obtain analytically the conditions for speciation . using different forms of the competition interaction </S>",
    "<S> we show that the speciation is absent for the genetic equivalent of a normal diffusing inhibitor , and is present for shorter - range interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison with numerical simulations is very good .    in this work </S>",
    "<S> we address the problem of speciation ( species formation ) in simple ecosystems , mirroring some aspects of bacterial and viral evolution . </S>",
    "<S> our model can be considered as an extension of the eigen model  @xcite . with respect to the latter </S>",
    "<S> , we introduce the competition among individuals .    </S>",
    "<S> eigen s phenomenological theory of self - reproducing macromolecules ( or haploid organisms ) illustrates the concept of stable quasi - species , i.e.  a peaked distribution of genomes around a master sequence , its width being determined by mutations . in its simpler formulation , the various genomes have different reproductive rates , the logarithm of which constitutes the fitness landscape  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the master sequence is located in correspondence of the maximum of the fitness . </S>",
    "<S> in general a one to one correspondence between a given phenotype and a genotype is assumed ( no polymorphism nor age structure ) . </S>",
    "<S> the genomes are coupled by mutations and by a global constraint on the total number of individuals ( constant organization ) . </S>",
    "<S> one usually considers only point mutations ( the most common ones ) , which correspond to a diffusion process in genetic space . in this way one can define the concept of distance in genetic space as the number of mutations needed to connect two genomes . </S>",
    "<S> the eigen model has also been studied in the contest of statistical mechanics @xcite .    for a vanishing mutation rate ( which is the case for actual organisms ) </S>",
    "<S> , only one quasi - species can survive in the long time limit , except for the marginal case of degenerate maxima of the fitness or for an extremely rough landscape ( similar to the spin glass energy landscape ) for which the system never attains equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> epstein  @xcite studied the problem without considering mutations ; he showed that the coexistence is possible if the species are self - limiting ( i.e.  there exists a form of self - competition , modeled for instance by a logistic term ) and coexisting species does not compete directly . on the contrary , when two species are in competition ( because they share some resource  an enzyme in epstein s case ) , only the fittest one survives . </S>",
    "<S> however , he did not introduce the genetic distance among species nor presented any evolutionary mechanism for the speciation phenomenon .    </S>",
    "<S> we think that the direct competition for local resources among strains , coupled with a weak mutation rate , is the simplest mechanism for modeling both speciation and stable coexistence in simple smooth landscapes . </S>",
    "<S> the mutations are needed to populate newly formed niches , while the competition actively separates the strains into quasi - species . </S>",
    "<S> one can consider the following analogy with a turing mechanism for chemical pattern formation . </S>",
    "<S> the main ingredients are an autocatalytic reaction process ( reproduction ) with slow diffusion ( mutations ) coupled with the emission of a short - lived , fast - diffusing inhibitor ( competition ) . in this way a local high concentration of autocatalytic reactants inhibits the growth in its neighborhood , acting as a local negative interaction .    in genetic space , </S>",
    "<S> the local coupling is given by the competition among genetically kin individuals . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , assuming a certain distribution of some resource ( such as some essential metabolic component for a bacterial population ) , then the more genetically similar two individuals are , the wider the fraction of shared resources is . </S>",
    "<S> the effects of competition on strain @xmath0 by strain @xmath1 are modeled by a term proportional to the relative abundance of the latter , @xmath2 , modulated by a function that decreases with the genetic distance between @xmath0 and @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> another example of this kind of competition can be found in the immune response in mammals . </S>",
    "<S> since the immune response has a certain degree of specificity , a viral strain @xmath0 can suffer from the response triggered by strain @xmath1 if they are sufficiently near in an appropriate genetic subspace . </S>",
    "<S> again , one can think that this effective competition can be modeled by a term , proportional to the relative abundance of the strain that originated the response , which decreases with the genetic distance .    </S>",
    "<S> although eigen s model is defined in an hypercubic genetic space , and the error threshold transition rigorously exists only in an infinite - dimensional space @xcite , the proposed speciation phenomenon is independent on the dimension of the genetic space . </S>",
    "<S> we shall work therefore in a linear genetic space . </S>",
    "<S> an instance of a similar ( sub-)space in real organisms is given by a repeated gene ( say a trna gene ) : a fraction of its copies can mutate , linearly varying the fitness of the individual with the `` chemical composition '' of the gene  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this degenerate case has been widely studied ( see for instance refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) ; one should introduce the multiplicity of a degenerate state , which can be approximated to a gaussian , but if one works in the neighborhood of its maximum ( the most common chemical composition ) the multiplicity factors are nearly constants . </S>",
    "<S> another example is given by the level of catalytic activity of a protein . </S>",
    "<S> a linear space has also been used for modeling the evolution of rna viruses on hela cultures  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> let us start with a one dimensional `` chemical '' model of cells that reproduce asexually and slowly diffuse ( in real space ) , @xmath3 being their relative abundance at position @xmath0 and at time @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> these cells constitutively emit a short - lived , fast - diffusing mitosys inhibitor @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> this inhibitor may be simply identified with some waste or with the consumption of a local resource ( say oxygen ) . </S>",
    "<S> the diffusion of the inhibitor is modeled as @xmath6 where @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the production , annihilation and diffusion rates of @xmath10 .    </S>",
    "<S> the evolution of the distribution @xmath11 is given by @xmath12 @xmath13 the growth rate @xmath14 can be expressed in terms of the fitness @xmath15 as @xmath16 due to the form of equation  ( [ p ] ) , the distribution @xmath11 is always normalized to one . </S>",
    "<S> the diffusion rate of @xmath10 , @xmath9 , is assumed to be much larger than @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> the growth rate @xmath14 , can be decomposed in two factors , @xmath18 , where @xmath19 gives the reproductive rate in absence of @xmath10 , so @xmath20 . in presence of a large concentration of the inhibitor </S>",
    "<S> @xmath10 the reproduction stops , so @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> a possible choice is @xmath22 for instance , @xmath23 could model the sources of food or , for algae culture , the distribution of light .    since we assumed a strong separation in time scales , we look for a stationary distribution @xmath24 of the inhibitor ( eq .  ( [ q ] ) ) by keeping @xmath11 fixed . </S>",
    "<S> this is given by a convolution of the distribution @xmath11 : @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 depend on the parameters @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 . in the following </S>",
    "<S> we shall use @xmath26 and @xmath27 as control parameters , disregarding their origin .    </S>",
    "<S> we can generalize this scenario to non - linear diffusion processes of the inhibitor by using the reaction - diffusion equation eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ p ] ) , with the fitness @xmath15 and the kernel @xmath28 are given by @xmath29 @xmath30 i.e. a symmetric decreasing function of @xmath31 with @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> the parameters @xmath26 and @xmath33 control the intensity of the competition and the steepness of the interaction , respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> let us consider the correspondence with the genetic space : the quantity @xmath0 now identifies a genome , the diffusion rate @xmath17 is given by mutations , and the inhibitor @xmath10 ( which is no more a real substance ) represents the competition among genetically related strains . </S>",
    "<S> the effects of competition are much faster than the genetic drift ( mutations ) , so that the previous hypotheses are valid . </S>",
    "<S> while the genetic interaction kernel @xmath34 is not given by a diffusion process , its general form should be similar to that of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ k ] ) : a decreasing function of the genetic distance between two strains . </S>",
    "<S> we shall refer to the @xmath11-independent contribution to the fitness , @xmath23 , as the static fitness landscape .    </S>",
    "<S> our model is thus defined by eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ p][k ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we are interested in its asymptotic behavior in the limit @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> actually , the mutation mechanism is needed only to define the genetic distance and to allow population of an eventual niche . </S>",
    "<S> the results should not change qualitatively if one includes more realistic mutation mechanisms .    </S>",
    "<S> let us first examine the behavior of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ p ] ) in absence of competition ( @xmath36 ) for a smooth static landscape and a vanishing mutation rate . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to the eigen model in one dimension : since it does not exhibit any phase transition , the asymptotic distribution is unique . </S>",
    "<S> the asymptotic distribution is given by one delta function peaked around the global maximum of the static landscape , or more delta functions ( coexistence ) if the global maxima are degenerate . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of a small mutation rate is simply that of broadening the distribution from a delta peak to a bell - shaped curve  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> while the degeneracy of maxima of the static fitness landscape is a very particular condition , we shall show in the following that in presence of competition this is a generic case . for illustration </S>",
    "<S> , we report in figure  1 the numerical computation of the asymptotic behavior of the model for a possible evolutive scenario that leads to the coexistence of three species . </S>",
    "<S> we have chosen a smooth static fitness @xmath37 ( see eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ h0 ] ) ) and a gaussian ( @xmath38 ) competition kernel . </S>",
    "<S> the effective fitness @xmath15 is almost degenerate ( here @xmath39 and the competition effect extends on the neighborhood of the maxima ) , and this leads to the coexistence . </S>",
    "<S> one could show that the curvature of the maxima affects the width and the height of the quasi - species distribution in presence of mutations  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we shall now derive the conditions for the coexistence of multiple species . </S>",
    "<S> let us assume that the asymptotic distribution is formed by @xmath40 delta peaks @xmath41 , @xmath42 , for a vanishing mutation rate ( or @xmath40 non - overlapping bell shaped curves for a small mutation rate ) centered at @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> the weight of each quasi species is @xmath44 , i.e. @xmath45 the quasi - species are ordered such as @xmath46 .    </S>",
    "<S> the evolution equations for the @xmath41 are ( @xmath47 ) @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50    the stability condition of the asymptotic distribution is @xmath51 , i.e. either @xmath52 ( degeneracy of maxima ) or @xmath53 ( all other points ) . in other terms </S>",
    "<S> one can say that in a stable environment the fitness of all individuals is the same , independently on the species .    </S>",
    "<S> the position @xmath43 and the weight @xmath44 of the quasi - species are given by @xmath52 and @xmath54 , or , in terms of the fitness @xmath15 , by @xmath55 @xmath56    let us compute the phase boundary for coexistence of three species for two kinds of kernels : the exponential ( diffusion ) one ( @xmath57 ) and a gaussian one ( @xmath38 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the static fitness @xmath23 is a symmetric linear decreasing function except in the vicinity of @xmath58 , where it has a quadratic maximum : @xmath59 so that close to @xmath58 one has @xmath60 and for @xmath61 , @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> we have checked numerically that the results are qualitatively independent on the exact form of the static fitness , providing that it is a smooth decreasing function .    due to the symmetries of the problem </S>",
    "<S> , we have one quasi - species at @xmath58 and two symmetric quasi - species at @xmath63 . neglecting the mutual influence of the two marginal quasi - species , and considering that @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 and that the three - species threshold is given by @xmath67 and @xmath68 , we have @xmath69 @xmath70 where @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 . in the following </S>",
    "<S> we drop the tildes for convenience . </S>",
    "<S> thus @xmath74 @xmath75 where @xmath76 .    for @xmath57 </S>",
    "<S> we have the coexistence condition @xmath77 the only parameters that satisfy these equations are @xmath78 and @xmath79 , i.e.  a flat landscape ( @xmath80 ) with infinite range interaction ( @xmath81 ) . </S>",
    "<S> since the coexistence region reduces to a single point , it is suggested that @xmath57 is a marginal case .    </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath38 the coexistence condition is given by @xmath82 @xmath83 one can solve numerically this system and obtain the boundary @xmath84 for the coexistence . in the limit @xmath85 ( static fitness almost flat ) one has @xmath86 with @xmath87 .    </S>",
    "<S> we have performed several numerical simulations for different values of the parameters , whose results are presented in figure  2 . the boundary of the multi - species phase is well approximated by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ gc ] ) ; in particular , this boundary does not depends on the mutation rate @xmath17 , at least for @xmath88 , which can be considered a very high mutation rate for real organisms . </S>",
    "<S> the most important effect of @xmath17 is the broadening of quasi - species curves , which can eventually merge .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> we have introduced a model for the genetic evolution of haploid organisms under the pressure of a static fitness landscape and competition . </S>",
    "<S> this model exhibits the phenomenon of species formation in a way reminiscent of a chemical pattern formation via a turing - like mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> we have analyzed analytically this system in the limit of vanishing mutation rate and linear genetic space , showing that an increasing level of a short - range competition induces a transition from a single species distribution to a stable environment in which multiple genetically distinct species are present . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison of the analytical approximation with the numerical integration of the original differential equations is very good . </S>",
    "<S> we think that the mechanism that we proposed is the simplest one for modeling speciation and species coexistence in a smooth ( or flat ) fitness landscape .    </S>",
