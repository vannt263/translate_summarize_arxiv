    "in studies of critical phenomena the range of the pairwise interaction that couples the degrees of freedom is an important consideration . for interactions which decay algebraically at large distances , three classes of critical behavior",
    "may be obtained . with the standard notation @xmath1 ,",
    "one finds for system dimensionality @xmath2 that the criticality may be characterized as _ short - range _ for @xmath3 , non - classically _ long - range _ for @xmath4 , and classically _ long - range _ for @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the correlation - function exponent in the corresponding system with short - range interactions  @xcite .",
    "the critical behavior matches at the bordering cases ( e.g. , @xmath7 from above and below ) with additional logarithms .",
    "however , for @xmath8 the interactions are _ nonintegrable _ , i.e.  @xmath9 , and so , under standard definitions , the thermodynamic limit does not exist .",
    "( see refs .",
    "@xcite for rigorous treatments . )    nevertheless , recent studies have focused on this nonintegrable regime , typically using a finite system size to render the total system energy finite .",
    "these results are then interpreted as `` nonextensive thermodynamics ''  @xcite , in which the system energy _ density _ scales with some positive power of the system size , as do intensive variables such as temperature .",
    "examples of such works include molecular - dynamics simulations of two- and three - dimensional systems with variants of the lennard - jones potential  @xcite , monte carlo simulations of one- and two - dimensional ising  @xcite and potts  @xcite systems , and a numerical study of the @xmath10 chain  @xcite .",
    "monte carlo simulations have also suggested classical critical behavior for a stochastic cellular automaton with long - range interactions in the regime @xmath8  @xcite . on the basis of these numerical studies of finite systems",
    ", several authors have _ conjectured _ that `` nonextensive criticality '' should be classical  @xcite .    here",
    "we present an alternate approach to nonintegrable interactions , quite similar to , and in certain cases equivalent to , the use of the kac potential .",
    "we introduce a long - distance cutoff in the interactions at some finite distance  @xmath11 , which enables us to use periodic boundary conditions and thus consider homogeneous systems .",
    "we then find the energy density in the thermodynamic limit to scale as a power of @xmath11 rather than of the system size  @xmath12 , that is , we maintain extensitivity . by",
    "multiplying the pair interaction by the appropriate negative power of @xmath11 we recover a well - defined @xmath13 limit . in this way , by using standard methods ( including the conventional canonical ensemble ) , we find an exact solution for the free energy for all @xmath14 , and so demonstrate the classical nature of the criticality without resort to simulations or conjecture ! these results have been announced previously in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "indeed , this is not surprising  the `` infinitely long - range and infinitely weak interactions '' route to an explicit , analytic ( mean - field - like ) theory is well known  @xcite .",
    "what is new here is the connection between nonintegrable interactions and the much - studied `` nonextensive thermodynamics . ''",
    "this connection rests on an additional result , namely the demonstration that _ any _ ordering of the limits @xmath15 yields the _ same _ free energy . for the limit @xmath16",
    "first , the free energy is obtained directly from a kac - potential treatment ( at least for @xmath17 ; the case @xmath18 is treated separately ) , while when the limit @xmath19 is taken first , we obtain , as an intermediate step , a finite system with constant interactions proportional to @xmath20i.e .",
    ", without approximation we obtain mean - field - like interactions !",
    "finally , in the limit @xmath21 the @xmath11-dependent prefactor multiplying the pair interactions may be regarded instead as a power of @xmath12 .",
    "this reproduces all scaling results of nonextensive thermodynamics of which we are aware , reducing the study of these systems to the application of standard techniques with boltzmann  gibbs statistics .",
    "furthermore , in the context of thermalized gravitational systems  @xcite our results provide what we believe is a new , direct connection to a rigorous kac - potential treatment .    while a finite free - energy density is obtained in the @xmath22 limit , the actual result depends explicitly on the cutoff _",
    "function_. to be specific , consider a fluid of density @xmath23 with the pair interaction @xmath24 where @xmath25 is introduced to avoid confusion with the negative values of @xmath26 , and where the cutoff function @xmath27taken to be isotropic for simplicity  decays at least as fast as @xmath28 for positive @xmath29 , with @xmath30 finite .",
    "the @xmath11-dependent prefactors are chosen to preempt the divergence of the energy in the limit @xmath13 . from this",
    "we obtain , in the limits @xmath31 , the helmholtz free - energy density @xmath32 where @xmath33 represents the maximal convex envelope , @xmath34 is the hard - core free energy ( which is strictly proportional to @xmath35 ) , and @xmath36 here @xmath37 is the surface area of a unit @xmath0-sphere .",
    "up to a factor @xmath38 , @xmath39 is just the second virial coefficient without the hard - core contribution .",
    "the free energy thus obtained indeed depends explicitly on the cutoff function @xmath27 , at least for @xmath40 , but does not depend on the system shape .",
    "we obtain quantitatively the same result for a lattice gas ( hence also for ising spin systems , cf .  ref .",
    "@xcite ,  ii e ) with the substitution of the lattice hard - core free energy being the only modification . in this context",
    ", we recall that the first application of the kac potential to spin systems is due to baker  @xcite .",
    "the dependence on details of the cutoff regulator has important implications when this solution is recast in the interpretation of `` nonextensivity . ''",
    "for the non - periodic case of nonextensive thermodynamics , where the finite system size is used to regulate the energy , the _ bulk _ quantities will depend on both boundary effects and the system shape , a point we have not found mentioned in previous studies .",
    "furthermore , when periodic boundary conditions are employed and the interaction is cut off at some fraction of the system size , the bulk thermodynamics will depend on precisely which fraction is used , notwithstanding statements to the contrary  @xcite ( cf .  our discussion in sec .",
    "[ sec : thermodyn ] below ) .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : math ] we present our mathematical treatment of the various limits which lead to the results above . next we present briefly the critical properties of these systems in section  [ sec : crit ] .",
    "since we can interpret our results in the language of nonextensive thermodynamics , this connection is presented and discussed in section  [ sec : thermodyn ] , and various difficulties with nonextensive thermodynamics are brought to light , including the above - mentioned system - shape dependent `` bulk '' thermodynamics .",
    "finally , we conclude with a summary of our main results , and some remarks on the connection to work done in the area of gravitational systems .",
    "we begin by considering a fluid in @xmath0 spatial dimensions with the pair - interaction potential given by  ( [ eq : pairint ] ) , with finite @xmath11 and in the thermodynamic limit . then for @xmath41 our main results ( [ eq : f ] ) and  ( [ eq : a ] ) for the limit @xmath19 follow immediately from the rigorous treatment of lebowitz and penrose @xcite . to see this ,",
    "define @xmath42 in which case  ( [ eq : pairint ] ) becomes @xmath43 , the canonical kac potential , with @xmath44 satisfying the necessary conditions for the proof given in  @xcite , cf .",
    "( 1.21a)(1.21c ) in this reference .",
    "it is also possible and useful ( for the @xmath45 case ) to understand this result from the mayer cluster or virial expansion about a reference hard - core potential  @xcite .",
    "specifically , the mayer function @xmath46 ( not to be confused with the free - energy density ) may be decomposed as @xmath47 + \\theta(r - a )                  [ e^{-\\beta u(r ) } - 1 ] \\;,\\ ] ] with @xmath48 the heaviside step function .",
    "the first square - bracket term is the mayer function for the hard - core potential and the second term accounts for the attractions .",
    "each irreducible cluster of the virial expansion may be replaced with a sum of clusters in which the individual bonds are replaced , in turn , with each of the hard - core and attraction bonds .",
    "the hard - core bonds are independent of the cutoff @xmath11 , so the sum of diagrams containing only these bonds yields the hard - core free energy ( via legendre transformation ) , which is unaffected by the limit @xmath49 . in what follows ,",
    "we summarize the argument for why the attraction bond 2-cluster is the only other term which survives the @xmath19 limit .",
    "the attraction bonds go to @xmath50 for large @xmath11 ( with @xmath51 , for now ) .",
    "each vertex that is free to integrate over space gives a factor @xmath52 .",
    "consider first diagrams with only attraction bonds : the @xmath53th order ring diagram ( each vertex having exactly two bonds ) with @xmath54 has @xmath53 bonds and @xmath55 free vertices , and so vanishes as @xmath56 for large @xmath11 .",
    "all other @xmath57 clusters have a higher ratio of bonds to vertices , and so these also vanish when all bonds are attractive .",
    "replacing an attraction bond with a hard - core bond removes one factor of @xmath56 but also kills one of the free vertex integrals , i.e.  the integration region is constrained to the scale of the hard core .",
    "the net effect for ring diagrams is that they remain of the same order in @xmath11 , and so vanish for @xmath57 . for more complicated irreducible clusters ,",
    "a situation can arise where two vertices mutually constrained by hard - core bonds are also connected by an attraction bond .",
    "in this case , replacing the attraction bond with a hard - core bond _ does _ increase the order of the diagram by a factor @xmath58 .",
    "however , this situation can only occur for diagrams with higher powers of @xmath59 than the ring diagrams , and can never bring them up to order @xmath60 .",
    "consequently , all diagrams with @xmath57 and at least one attraction bond vanish as @xmath19 .",
    "the @xmath61 case is distinct as it has one bond and one free integral , so it provides an @xmath60 contribution @xmath62 where @xmath39 is given in ( [ eq : a ] ) .",
    "thus the virial expansion reproduces ( [ eq : f ] ) , apart from the convex envelope .",
    "the failure of this otherwise exact method to reproduce the maxwell construction is that the virial expansion relies on a homogeneous density and breaks down when this is not the case .",
    "nevertheless , since it is exact whenever the density _ is _ homogeneous , the virial expansion supplemented with the second law ( convexity ) prescribes a unique free energy , and so can be regarded as providing the rigorous result .",
    "the utility of the virial - expansion method is that it applies to the borderline case @xmath45 , where we can not directly map to the results of @xcite .",
    "the hard - core terms are unmodified , attraction bonds now go as @xmath63 , and free vertex integrals give @xmath64 the sum of diagrams with @xmath57 and at least one attraction bond is @xmath65 ( provided there are no surviving resummations of @xmath66 terms ) .",
    "the @xmath61 attraction bond diagram gives the only remaining contribution @xmath67",
    "which again leads to ( [ eq : f ] ) and ( [ eq : a ] ) .",
    "interestingly , the bulk thermodynamics in this marginal case is not sensitive to the details of the cutoff function .",
    "now consider the same fluid system , but taking @xmath19 with finite @xmath12 .",
    "for clarity , we begin by considering a one - dimensional system with @xmath68 , in which the periodic boundary conditions lead to the effective pair potential ( @xmath69 ) @xmath70 where @xmath71 is understood to be less than @xmath72 . as @xmath11 becomes large , the direct ( @xmath73 ) interaction becomes negligible and an increasingly large number of terms contribute to the sum . by use of the expansions @xmath74 and @xmath75 where we assume @xmath27 to be analytic , we may rewrite @xmath76 for large  @xmath11 as @xmath77 \\right .",

    "the direct interaction term ( all @xmath91 ) becomes negligible compared to the sum and we find the following generalization of eq .",

    "as before , we end up with a constant effective interaction @xmath103 . for @xmath104 ,",
    "the correction terms decay only like @xmath63 and @xmath105 . since the case of general dimensionality",
    "can be treated along the same lines , we only mention the resulting values for the constant pair potential : @xmath106 for @xmath40 and @xmath107 for @xmath108 .",
    "these results are all consistent with ( [ eq : f ] ) with @xmath97 .",
    "thus , we have shown that , in the limit of infinite interaction range , all pair interactions are identical even in a finite system , for any @xmath109 . for @xmath110 on the other hand , the sum in eqs.([eq : eff_pair_potential ] ) ,  ( [ eq : eff_pair_potential - d ] ) is convergent and hence the @xmath11-dependent prefactor in @xmath111 should be omitted .",
    "the first term within the square brackets is then no longer negligible in the limit @xmath112 , which leads to an effective interaction that depends both on @xmath71 and on @xmath113 and consequently to nontrivial critical behavior .",
    "interestingly , the critical _ exponents _ retain their classical values until @xmath114 , except for the correlation - length exponent  @xmath115 and the correlation - function exponent  @xmath116  @xcite .",
    "the critical temperature and other nonuniversal quantities exhibit a nontrivial @xmath113 dependence already for @xmath117 , cf .",
    "@xcite and references therein .",
    "so far we have only discussed continuum fluid criticality .",
    "the generalization to a lattice gas ( and , of course , to the ising ferromagnet ) results in the same free energy ( [ eq : f ] ) with the appropriate lattice hard core @xmath118 .",
    "this may be seen most directly in the @xmath49 first case , where the pair interactions go to a constant .",
    "this derivation applies both for particles in a continuum or on a lattice ( indeed , no specification was made ) , and so the constant interactions are obtained in both cases .",
    "the final step of constructing the free energy from the decoupled energy and entropy reveals that the lattice hard - core free energy is the appropriate one to use in  ( [ eq : f ] ) .    for the @xmath119 first limit , one must use a lattice generalization of the mayer expansion .",
    "such an expansion would give for non - interacting particles the lattice hard - core free energy .",
    "the lattice sums for clusters with attraction bonds can be taken to integrals in the large @xmath11 limit , and so the rest of the continuum derivation applies .",
    "the final case we consider is that of @xmath120 , the case most directly applicable to `` nonextensive thermodynamics . ''",
    "consider a finite system with periodic boundary conditions ( with all dimensions @xmath121 ) and direct pair interactions given by ( [ eq : pairint ] ) for some finite  @xmath11 .",
    "the periodic boundary conditions give rise to the effective pair potential  ( [ eq : eff_pair_potential - d ] ) .",
    "the virial expansion for the pressure may then be obtained from a finite - volume cluster expansion with the mayer function @xmath122 for large @xmath11 . since the effective interaction is a sum of pair interactions , a simple @xmath123 cluster such as the irreducible 3-cluster shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cluster](a ) decomposes into a large number of pair - interaction bond clusters [ cf .",
    "[ fig : cluster](b ) ] .",
    "note that , in order to avoid overcounting , one end of every bond must remain in the original finite volume , but the other end may be taken to lie in any of the periodic repeats ( and these still contribute to the virial expansion as they are parts of an irreducible cluster ) .",
    "=    in spite of these complications , we remark that all hard - core bonds are the same as in the previous ( @xmath119 first ) case , since they only appear in the direct interaction of the original pair .",
    "hence the hard - core bonds sum to the hard - core free energy regardless of whether @xmath12 and @xmath11 are simultaneously taken to infinity , or @xmath12 first .",
    "furthermore , all @xmath53-clusters with @xmath54 and at least one attraction bond can be shown to still vanish as @xmath124 .",
    "first , all bonds still carry a factor of @xmath56 for large @xmath11 , as before .",
    "free vertices integrate to @xmath125 for the direct interaction of the original pair , which goes as @xmath58 times a finite factor for large  @xmath11 . for a pair interaction involving a neighboring replica ,",
    "the vertex integration is the same as above with a shift in the argument of @xmath126 , where @xmath127 [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : tilde - r ] ) ] goes roughly as @xmath128 .",
    "the resulting vertex integration will also scale as @xmath58 , provided @xmath129 . since @xmath127 increases for each increasingly remote replica , the cutoff function @xmath27",
    "will ensure that only a number @xmath130 of such bonds will contribute . hence free vertex integration with effective interaction bonds , while considerably more complicated , still results in a factor @xmath58 at large @xmath11 .",
    "previous arguments from section  [ sec : infl ] then apply , and so these terms all vanish when @xmath124 .    the remaining 2-cluster integral may be written as @xmath131 where the sums cover all replicas ( and we have omitted writing the hard - core condition for clarity ) . in going from ( [ eq : sum1 ] ) to ( [ eq : sum2 ] ) the integrand variable changed from @xmath127 to @xmath71 , consistent with the definition of @xmath127 . the remaining integrals piece together a single volume integral over all space , so @xmath132 following ( [ eq : two_cluster ] ) .",
    "combining this with the hard - core contribution gives the same free energy ( [ eq : f ] ) in the @xmath133 limit as was found previously for @xmath12 or @xmath11 going to infinity first .",
    "the significance of this simultaneous limit towards nonextensive thermodynamics will be discussed in section  [ sec : thermodyn ] .",
    "the critical properties of nonintegrable systems are readily found from the helmholtz free - energy density  ( [ eq : f ] ) via standard procedures .",
    "for example , the critical density can be obtained from @xmath134 , which reduces to the temperature ( and attraction ) independent condition @xmath135 .",
    "the critical temperature is then found from @xmath136 which gives @xmath137    for a hypercubic lattice with lattice constant  @xmath138 , the lattice - gas hard - core free energy is @xmath139 .",
    "this results in the critical values @xmath140 although the free energy for continuum hard spheres ( diameter @xmath138 ) is not known exactly , a very good approximation in three dimensions is nevertheless given by the carnahan  starling ( cs ) expression @xmath141 with @xmath142 the volume of the hard sphere and @xmath143 the ideal gas free energy density . using this for @xmath144 yields a quintic equation for @xmath145 with a unique positive root  @xcite and the critical values @xmath146    the susceptibility @xmath147 , defined as the ratio of the isothermal compressibility to the ideal gas compressibility , @xmath148 exhibits near criticality the classical divergence @xmath149 for @xmath150 and positive reduced temperature @xmath151 . from ( [ eq : f ] ) we find @xmath152 which results in @xmath153 for the lattice gas and @xmath154 for the @xmath155 hard - sphere fluid , approximated by the cs expression .",
    "finally , the order parameter for @xmath156 is given by @xmath157 for @xmath158 sufficiently small , with @xmath159_{\\rho_c } \\over        [ \\partial^4 f_0/\\partial\\rho^4]_{\\rho_c } \\right)^{1/2 } \\;.\\ ] ] this evaluates to @xmath160 and @xmath161 .",
    "as indicated in the introduction , the main motivation for this work stems from the considerable attention systems with nonintegrable interactions have received in the context of `` nonextensive thermodynamics . ''",
    "an essential aspect of these studies of nonextensivity is the use of the system size as the regulator for the energy .",
    "furthermore , the interactions are not scaled by a negative power of the system size but left with strength of order unity .",
    "our cutoff interaction with range @xmath11 can be interpreted directly in terms of this nonextensive thermodynamics for @xmath162 constant , which reproduces the system - size regulator .",
    "the negative power of @xmath12 multiplying our pair interaction is eliminated by scaling the temperature according to @xmath163 in the boltzmann factor ( @xmath164 for @xmath45 ) .",
    "the scaling of this system - size dependent `` temperature '' ( and consequently the free energy ) matches exactly the conjectures of nonextensive thermodynamics , thus we have derived rigorously the primary conclusions of refs .",
    "@xcite using only standard methods .",
    "we note that , despite what has been suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , neither the explicit free energy nor exact results for the nature of the criticality were obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "next we want to discuss some examples from the recent literature and point out a few problems attached to the interpretation of nonextensive thermodynamics .",
    "first , a pervasive notational problem in the nonextensive thermodynamics literature is the use of `` long - range interactions '' to mean `` nonintegrable interactions . ''",
    "the former term already has a standard meaning within the considerably more important class of integrable interactions @xcite .",
    "the converse problem also exists , where all integrable interactions ( including the true long - range interactions ) are termed `` short - range '' ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "many papers addressing nonintegrable interactions have relied on numerical simulations of finite systems . in general , the required regularization of the interactions is carried out either by imposing free boundary conditions ( which leads to an inhomogeneous system ) or by adopting periodic boundary conditions and cutting off the interaction at half the system size , being the maximum separation between the particles .",
    "for example , curilef and tsallis  @xcite have performed molecular - dynamics simulations of fluids in @xmath165 dimensions with lennard - jones - like interactions , with an attractive tail decaying like @xmath166 and @xmath167 .",
    "it is explicitly stated ( ref .",
    "@xcite , p.  271 ) that , in the thermodynamic limit , no physical consequences emerge from the ( `` computationally convenient '' ) adoption of a cutoff at half the size of the simulation box .",
    "our exact solution presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : math ] shows that this is not correct for @xmath51 , but that rather different _ bulk _ thermodynamics emerges for different cutoff distances and cutoff functions .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , rings of magnetic particles in a colloidal suspension have been studied numerically , where the nonmagnetic part of the interactions has the above - mentioned generalized lennard - jones form .",
    "the main results are heuristically interpreted in terms of `` nonextensive thermodynamics '' by observing that the size dependence of the total energy of the rings can be well described by a scaling law obtained from the integrated interaction ( which is essentially a mean - field - like approximation ) .",
    "this scaling law is just what is also found within the `` @xmath168-generalized thermodynamics '' of ref .",
    "@xcite , commonly referred to as tsallis @xmath168-statistics , and consequently a @xmath113 dependence ( @xmath169 ) is proposed for the so - called `` nonextensivity parameter ''  @xmath168 appearing in this formalism : @xmath170 ( corresponding to boltzmann ",
    "gibbs statistics ) for @xmath117 and @xmath171 for @xmath172 . also in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been conjectured that @xmath168 is a @xmath0- and @xmath113-dependent quantity for @xmath172 .",
    "it appears that these conclusions have been since revised  @xcite , and these systems are now classified as `` weakly violating '' boltzmann ",
    "gibbs statistics , meaning that @xmath170 , whereas several thermodynamic quantities lose their extensivity .",
    "nevertheless , recent studies have continued to explore @xmath173 values for @xmath172 , citing an alleged natural connection between tsallis statistics and nonintegrable interactions @xcite .",
    "our results show that the same energy scaling for @xmath172 may be obtained with the conventional value @xmath170 .    inspired by the system - size dependence of the energy found in ref .",
    "@xcite , an ising model with interactions decaying as @xmath166 ( @xmath174 ) and free boundary conditions has been analyzed by mean - field methods in ref .",
    "@xcite . on the basis of the resulting values of the critical temperature for @xmath175 and @xmath45",
    ", it was then _ conjectured _ that the mean - field prediction for the critical temperature might hold for all @xmath176 .",
    "our exact result now demonstrates that this is indeed true , but reveals in addition an awkward consequence of the boundary conditions adopted in ref .",
    "@xcite : since the thermodynamic limit explicitly depends on the choice of the cutoff function , an inhomogeneous system with an inhomogeneous cutoff will lead to bulk thermodynamics that depends on the _ shape _ of the system , which to our judgment constitutes an undesirable feature of the nonextensivity formulation .",
    "we note that already in an early study of the ising model with long - range interactions  @xcite a system - shape dependence of the thermodynamic properties has been observed for the case of _ conditionally convergent _ lattice sums with  @xmath45 ( such as dipolar forces ) .",
    "also the exactness of mean - field theory for _ shape - independent _ forces in the limit @xmath177 has been obtained in the same reference , essentially from an observation similar to ours for general @xmath178 , namely that one divergent term dominates all other terms in the lattice sum . however , for the case @xmath40 , we have been unable to find in the literature any mention of the system - shape dependent thermodynamics that must result for all inhomogeneous systems with nonintegrable interactions and a system - size dependent cutoff .",
    "in summary , we have shown that @xmath0-dimensional , periodic systems with nonintegrable , algebraically decaying interactions , i.e. , interactions of the form @xmath179 , with @xmath176 , are exactly described by mean - field theory , upon introduction of a cutoff  @xmath11 in the interaction range and the proper @xmath11-dependent rescaling of the interaction strength .",
    "this proof holds for either order of limits @xmath13 and @xmath16 ( where @xmath12 is the linear system size ) , including the simultaneous limit , and the resulting free energy depends on the details of the cutoff .",
    "our study employs boltzmann  gibbs statistics and pertains directly to nonextensive thermodynamics , providing explicit , exact results for the thermodynamics and critical behavior . in doing so",
    ", we show that nonintegrable interactions do not require  @xcite the application of generalized @xmath168-statistics .",
    "furthermore , the explicit regulator dependence  cutoff length , cutoff shape , and even system shape for inhomogeneous systems  is demonstrated , a topic which has been mostly neglected in nonextensivity studies .    on an intuitive level , our findings for the case of finite systems with infinite  @xmath11 ( section  [ sec : infr ] ) result from the divergence of the lattice sums over the periodic copies of the system under consideration",
    "; these divergent sums then dominate the direct pair interaction , and are , to leading order , independent of the spatial separation between particles .",
    "a suitable normalization is indispensable for the existence of the thermodynamic limit and  as we have pointed out  a regulator depending on the number of interactions rather than on the system size emerges as the natural choice .",
    "the resulting effective pair interaction is then independent of the spatial separation , for @xmath176 .",
    "we have concentrated on both fluids and lattice gases . however , since our method for the @xmath19 first case demonstrated how the effective interaction becomes independent of spatial separation , our results immediately carry over to large classes of other systems as well ( obviously , the critical properties obtained in sec .  [ sec : crit ] explicitly refer to systems with a one - component order parameter ) .",
    "these include general @xmath180 models ( @xmath10 , heisenberg , @xmath181 ) and potts models . in this context",
    "we note that in earlier work the exactness of mean - field theory in the limit @xmath177 has been found not only for the ising model ( @xmath83 )  @xcite but also for the husimi ",
    "temperley mean spherical model ( @xmath182 )  @xcite .",
    "our explicit result of an analytic free energy , generalized to the systems mentioned above , explains a number of numerical results obtained for systems with nonintegrable interactions .",
    "this includes the molecular - dynamics simulations of systems with a generalized lennard - jones potential discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : thermodyn ] @xcite , monte carlo simulations of one - dimensional ising  @xcite , potts  @xcite , and @xmath10  @xcite models with @xmath183 , and the scaling properties found in refs .  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a subleading term in the spin ",
    "spin correlation function of the nonintegrable ising chain was considered and on the basis of monte carlo simulations of finite systems with @xmath184 and @xmath185 it was concluded that these correlations are correctly described by mean - field theory .    finally , we remark on the connection of these results to gravitational systems , where @xmath155 and @xmath104 .",
    "since the masses of the particles and the gravitational coupling are presumably fixed , we are not at liberty to scale to infinitely weak interactions . however , following the `` nonextensive thermodynamics '' formulations , we can consider @xmath186 for a finite system and regard the prefactor in the pair interactions as belonging to a rescaled temperature @xmath187 . at the same time",
    ", we note that such a divergent temperature appears of limited practical use .",
    "the existence of a phase transition in these systems has been studied for fermionic particles in the context of thomas  fermi theory  @xcite .",
    "most studies have considered gravitationally interacting particles in a non - periodic , finite - sized system , concentrating on the asymptotic , large-@xmath188 limit . here",
    "they obtain non - extensivity in the particle number  @xmath188 , with the energy per particle growing as @xmath189 ( in contrast to @xmath190 for integrable interactions ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite the energy densities were suitably rescaled to enable the infinite - volume limit , which presumably comes closest to what has been presented in the current work .",
    "however , these studies differ from ours due to the fermionic character of the particles , which is used to regulate the short - distance behavior .",
    "classical gravitational systems have previously been studied as well  @xcite , again in a non - periodic , finite - sized box , with various forms of short - distance regulators . in this case the energy per particle scales as @xmath188 , essentially because the pair interaction , while decaying as @xmath191 , has a minimum value for all particles that is proportional to @xmath192 , due to the fixed system size .",
    "in contrast , our thermodynamic limit , @xmath119 with fixed particle density , combined with the long - distance power - law tails of the pair potential , implies an energy per particle growing as @xmath193 ( or @xmath194 for general @xmath51 ) . finally , we mention ref .",
