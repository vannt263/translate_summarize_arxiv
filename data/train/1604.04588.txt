    "the human immunodeficiency virus ( hiv ) disables many components of the body s immune system and , without antiretroviral treatment , leads to the onset of acquired immune deficiency syndrome ( aids ) . despite the vast amount of study devoted to understanding viral pathogenesis and developing new therapeutics , no procedure or medication currently exists to reliably eliminate the virus from a host .",
    "however , new advances in long - term treatment strategies and insight into disease dynamics have stemmed from mathematical and computational modeling approaches , in addition to clinical experimentation .",
    "a variety of mathematical models have been proposed to describe hiv infection and disease dynamics @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , using a model to capture the entire time course of infection within the body can be troublesome as many oversimplify the biological dynamics of the disease in an effort to gain mathematical and rudimentary biological insight , and fail to capture all stages of infection .",
    "the majority of models accurately capture only the first stage(s ) of infection @xcite with the t - cell count and viral load asymptotically approaching a nonzero limit - the latter referred to as the viral set point .",
    "one recent description has been able to provide a holistic understanding of disease dynamics by accurately capturing all three stages of infection .",
    "this model , proposed in @xcite , is comprised of a system of seven nonlinear autonomous differential equations that are fully coupled and augmented by twenty - seven distinct parameters . in this paper we investigate the dynamical properties of the model and establish a result concerning its large - time asymptotic behavior .",
    "further , we analyze this model , utilizing mathematical and statistical methods to elucidate the contribution of the parameter space on an infected individual s t - cell count , and approximate solutions as a function of time",
    ".    the paper proceeds as follows . within the next section ,",
    "all infection - free steady states of the model are determined and the local asymptotic stability properties of the biologically - relevant equilibrium are studied .",
    "the associated theorems have interesting implications for the model s predictive nature , especially upon the introduction of antiretroviral therapy . in section @xmath1",
    ", we utilize active subspace methods to perform a global sensitivity analysis of the model with respect to its parameter space and further investigate the dependence of an infected individual s t - cell count on system parameters . with this information , a global - in - time approximation of the t - cell count",
    "is constructed using dynamic active subspaces .",
    "additionally , various reduced models are constructed to represent different stages of the disease , and these are discussed in detail . in general , active subspace methods are a useful tool to perform global sensitivity analysis of a given parameter space , provide a clear picture of the most important activity in a model arising from parameter variation , construct dimensionally - reduced approximations to complex , dynamical models , and execute inexpensive numerical approximations from models that require computationally - intensive simulation .",
    "this is of particular importance in the current context as parameters for the original long - term hiv model are individual - dependent , and therefore must be determined for each new patient .",
    "hence , the construction of a significantly less expensive computational approximation will allow one to utilize the model for large sets of patient data .",
    "finally , we note that all of the matlab scripts and functions used to generate our results are provided free , open source , and available to the public at http://inside.mines.edu/~pankavic/activehiv .",
    "to begin , we consider the following long term model of hiv disease dynamics within a host , as recently formulated in @xcite : @xmath2 the population of cd4@xmath3 t - cells , denoted here by @xmath4 , is one of the most critical components in determining the body s response to hiv infection , and the first equation represents its time evolution . in ( [ hadji ] ) the t - cell population is increased by a standard source , @xmath5 , which represents the constant supply rate of immunocompetent t - cells from the thymus , and a nonlinear generation term @xmath6 , which accounts for the appearance of new t - cells due to the immune system s response to the infection .",
    "in contrast , because @xmath7-cells have a finite lifespan , a natural death term @xmath8 is also included .",
    "the last two terms in the first equation model the infection of t - cells by either virions , the population of which is denoted by @xmath9 , or infected macrophages , @xmath10 , at rates @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "the latter term is introduced in as studies have shown that infected macrophages likely play a vital role in the progression of infection @xcite by producing large amounts of virus even after the t - cell population has been depleted .",
    "the second equation describes changes within the actively - infected t - cell population ( @xmath13 ) , the first term of which represents the addition to this compartment due to new infections .",
    "however , not all interactions between virions and healthy t - cells produce actively - infected t - cells .",
    "some proportion @xmath14 of these new infections contribute to the @xmath13 population , while the remainder ( @xmath15 ) lack necessary host factors , resulting in the absence of viral protein expression , and become latently - infected t - cells ( @xmath16 ) , contributing to the third equation .",
    "the infected t - cell population adds , in addition to the number created by the virions and macrophages , a supply of newly - activated latent t - cells , at a per - capita rate @xmath17 . in turn , this portion of the @xmath16 population is lost within the third equation .",
    "infected t - cells are lost due to natural death , which is represented by @xmath18 , while a more interesting term , @xmath19 , represents the loss of infected t - cells due to cytotoxic lymphocytes ( @xmath20 ) , one of the many attacker cells the immune system employs .",
    "latently - infected t - cells also possess a natural death rate denoted by @xmath21 .",
    "similar to t - cells , the macrophage population ( @xmath22 ) possess a natural birth rate , @xmath23 , as well as a natural death rate , @xmath24 . as discussed in @xcite ,",
    "macrophages divide and become more aggressive in seeking out pathogens once they are alerted of a viral presence by cd4 + t - cells .",
    "hence , the macrophage population is increased in response to hiv infection at a rate of @xmath25 .",
    "macrophages also attempt to eliminate virions , but may also become infected , adding to the infected macrophage population ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "infected macrophages naturally expire at a certain rate @xmath27 , and are also destroyed by cytotoxic lymphocytes at a rate @xmath28 .",
    "once infected , macrophages produce virions at a rate given by @xmath29 .",
    "infected macrophages may also infect healthy t - cells , and the rate at which this occurs is denoted by @xmath12 .",
    "the main defender of the body against infected cells is the cytotoxic lymphocyte , the population of which is denoted by @xmath20 .",
    "these cells seek to destroy renegade t - cells and macrophages that have been infected and altered by hiv . as for the other components of the immune system",
    ", we assume that cytotoxic lymphocytes are produced at a constant rate @xmath30 by the bone marrow .",
    "additionally , new lymphocytes are produced proportionate to the other aspects of the body s immune response .",
    "hence , the term @xmath31 , occurs within the sixth equation to represent the recruitment of new lymphocytes .",
    "lastly , the growth of the virion population @xmath32 depends on a variety of parameters .",
    "new virions are continually produced by infected t - cells and infected macrophages at rates @xmath33 and @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "in addition , the virion population is decreased through a variety of means . due to infection ,",
    "virions are lost at the rates @xmath34 and @xmath35 , proportional to the interaction of t - cells and macrophages with virions , respectively . also",
    ", macrophages , responding to antibodies produced by a host , ingest and destroy virions at a rate @xmath36 .",
    "finally , virus particles are cleared from the host by other factors , including the innate immune response , at a rate @xmath37 .",
    "note that all parameter values in are positive .",
    "typical values and ranges for the parameters taken from @xcite can be found within table  [ tab : paramvalues ] .",
    "the time course of infection predicted by this model with the established parameter values was shown to agree well with clinical data from @xcite , and representative simulations of with realistic parameter values are displayed in figure [ sims ] .",
    ".parameter values and ranges [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      though the system ( [ hadji ] ) possesses a large number of steady states - the authors have discovered at least ten using standard parameter values and a computational root finder - one is often most interested in understanding the dynamical properties of the disease - free equilibrium . in this section ,",
    "we identify such equilibria and investigate the stability of the biologically - relevant state .",
    "our first result demonstrates that only one such equilibrium state exists when all populations of are positive .",
    "[ t1 ] the model possesses exactly two virus - free ( i.e. @xmath38 ) steady states .",
    "one of these states , namely @xmath39 achieves negative values , where @xmath40 the only nonnegative ( i.e. biologically relevant ) steady state of ( [ hadji ] ) satisfying @xmath38 is @xmath41    hence , the only guarantee of viral clearance as @xmath42 occurs when actively and latently infected populations are also eradicated , resulting in healthy t - cell and macrophage populations tending asymptotically to background values .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ t1 ] is contained in appendix a. utilizing standard parameter values for this model from table  [ tab : paramvalues ] , we find the following equilibrium populations for @xmath43 : @xmath44 since the parameter values in are positive , the steady state @xmath43 given in theorem  [ t1 ] must have a negative cytotoxic t - lymphocyte population , namely @xmath45 .",
    "so , under no parameter regime will @xmath43 be biologically relevant . with the unique infection - free steady state identified",
    ", we turn to its stability properties .",
    "next , we provide necessary and sufficient conditions which guarantee the local asymptotic stability of the disease - free equilibrium @xmath46",
    ". +    [ t3 ] the equilibrium state @xmath47 is locally asymptotically stable if and only if @xmath48 , where @xmath49 and @xmath50 @xmath51    the proof of theorem  [ t3 ] is also contained within appendix a. computing the basic reproduction number of theorem [ t3 ] by using the standard parameter values given in table  [ tab : paramvalues ] , we find that @xmath52 . hence , as expected , the non - infective steady state @xmath46 is not locally asymptotically stable .",
    "introducing antiretroviral therapy , or art , into the system provides additional insight into this result .",
    "two specific classes of art drugs , namely reverse transcriptase inhibitors ( rtis ) and protease inhibitors ( pis ) , serve to reduce the amount of new virus produced by either reducing the ability of virions to replicate through reverse transcription or disabling the capability of newly - produced virions to mature , thereby rendering them uninfective .",
    "the efficacies of these classes of drug , denoted @xmath53 $ ] , can be incorporated using the transformations @xmath54 as these constants appear within the stability result and decrease each of the ratios @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 , it follows that a large enough efficacy will force the system to tend towards @xmath46 as @xmath42 .",
    "therefore , one merely needs to perform this transformation on the result of theorem [ t3 ] in order to determine what efficacy is needed to guarantee viral clearance .",
    "using the previously - determined parameter values and defining @xmath58 $ ] by @xmath59 we find @xmath60 in order to force @xmath61 .",
    "thus , a combined drug efficacy greater than @xmath62 would be needed to asymptotically drive the system to clearance . of course",
    ", lesser drug efficacies could still give rise to viral loads that are effectively negligible rather than tending to zero , and therefore correspond to viral clearance .",
    "notice that the asymptotic stability result in theorem  [ t3 ] depends only upon a relatively few number ( @xmath63 of @xmath64 ) of the parameters .",
    "therefore , the majority of the pertinent dynamics takes place on a lower - dimensional subspace of the entire parameter space .",
    "hence , in the next section we explore a dynamic tool to better understand the contribution of the parameter space to populations within the model .",
    "in particular , this will lead to reducing the dimension of the parameter space with minimal loss of information using an active subspace decomposition .",
    "in this section we will use active subspace methods to approximate the t - cell count at a specific time given the parameter values in .",
    "we closely follow the material as developed by constantine and co - authors @xcite .",
    "an active subspace is a low - dimensional linear subspace of the set of parameters , in which input perturbations along these directions alter the model s predictions more , on average , than perturbations which are orthogonal to the subspace .",
    "these subspaces allow for a global measurement of sensitivity of output variables with respect to parameters , and often the construction of reduced - order models that greatly decrease the dimension of the parameter space .",
    "the general structure of an active subspace decomposition begins by letting @xmath65 be given and defining the space @xmath66^m$ ] .",
    "also given is a differentiable function @xmath67 and an associated probability density @xmath68 satisfying @xmath69 here , the space @xmath70 represents a normalized set of parameter values . with these quantities in place , consider the matrix @xmath71 defined by @xmath72 for any smooth @xmath73 , the matrix @xmath71 represents an average derivative functional which weights input values according to the density @xmath74 . in general terms",
    ", @xmath75 represents the quantity of interest in a given model , while gradients of @xmath73 are taken with respect to normalized model parameters @xmath76 , and @xmath77 is the probability density associated to the values of these parameters .",
    "we note here that a single normalized parameter is a random variable taking values in @xmath78 $ ] , which when appropriately scaled represents a parameter in the original model .",
    "since the dimension of the parameter space in this model is @xmath64 , we take @xmath79 throughout .",
    "the matrix @xmath71 is the average of the outer product of the gradient of @xmath73 with itself and has some useful properties that will allow us to deduce information about how @xmath73 is altered by perturbations in its arguments .",
    "considering each entry of the matrix @xmath80 we note that @xmath71 is symmetric , and thus permits the spectral eigendecompostion @xmath81 here , @xmath82 is an orthogonal matrix whose columns @xmath83 are the orthonormal eigenvectors of @xmath71 . from we",
    "can further solve for the eigenvalues of @xmath71 , which are given by @xmath84 from we see that the eigenvalues of the @xmath71 matrix are the mean squared directional derivatives of @xmath73 , in the direction of the corresponding eigenvector .",
    "thus , the eigenvalues of @xmath71 provide useful information about the quantity of interest .",
    "for instance , if a particular eigenvalue is small then tells us that , on average , @xmath73 does not change significantly in the direction of the corresponding eigenvector .",
    "conversely , if the eigenvalue under consideration is large , then we may deduce that @xmath73 changes considerably in the direction of the corresponding eigenvector .",
    "therefore , it will be of interest to further investigate the behavior of the function in this direction .",
    "once the eigendecomposition has been determined , the eigenvalues and eigenvectors can be separated in the following way : @xmath85 where @xmath86 contains the `` large '' eigenvalues of @xmath71 , @xmath87 contains the `` small '' eigenvalues , and @xmath88 contains the eigenvectors associated with each @xmath89 , for @xmath90 .",
    "an easy way to differentiate between the `` large '' and `` small '' eigenvalues is to list them on a log plot from greatest to least and determine a spectral gap .",
    "this gap will correspond to differences of at least an order of magnitude , and thus allow one to compartmentalize large eigenvalues within @xmath86 and the remaining smaller eigenvalues in @xmath87 .",
    "a more systematic method of choosing how many eigenvalues to store within @xmath86 will be presented in section  [ subsec : t1700 ] .    with the decomposition",
    ", we can represent any element @xmath91 of the parameter space by @xmath92 thus , evaluating the quantity of interest at @xmath91 is equivalent to doing so at the point @xmath93 , i.e. @xmath94 by the definition of @xmath95 and @xmath96 it s clear that small perturbations in @xmath97 will not , on average , alter the values of @xmath73 .",
    "however , small perturbations in @xmath98 will , on average , change @xmath73 significantly .",
    "for this reason we define the range of @xmath95 to be the _ active subspace _ of the model and the range of @xmath96 to be the corresponding _",
    "inactive subspace_. the linear combinations that generate these subspaces will then represent the contributions of differing parameters in the model and describe the sensitivity of the quantity of interest with respect to parameter variations .",
    "in general , the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of @xmath71 defined by can be well - approximated , using a random sampling algorithm .",
    "we will briefly outline the method , but full details can be found in @xcite ( algorithm 3.1 ) and @xcite .",
    "the algorithm can be described concisely as follows :    1 .",
    "draw @xmath99 samples @xmath100 independently according to the density @xmath74 .",
    "2 .   for each parameter sample @xmath101",
    ", approximate the gradient @xmath102 using the finite difference , i.e. @xmath103 where @xmath104 represents a vector perturbation from the sampled parameter values and @xmath105 can be taken arbitrarily small .",
    "3 .   approximate the matrix @xmath71 by + @xmath106 4 .",
    "compute the eigendecompositions @xmath107 .",
    "we note that the last step is equivalent to computing the singular value decomposition of the matrix @xmath108 = \\hat{w } \\sqrt{\\hat{\\lambda } } \\hat{v},\\ ] ] where it can be shown that the singular values are the square roots of the eigenvalues of @xmath109 and the left singular vectors are the eigenvectors of @xmath109 .",
    "the singular value decomposition method of approximating @xmath109 was developed first in @xcite .",
    "next , we will demonstrate the active subspace method at one specific point in time by applying the aforementioned algorithm to the hiv model .",
    "a suitable quantity of interest would likely involve the t - cell or virus population evaluated at a fixed time .",
    "for this example we select @xmath111 , the t - cell count @xmath112 days after initial infection .",
    "this quantity was chosen because the t - cell count is a strong indicator of a patient s overall health and the most important factor in the progression of hiv infection .",
    "the time of @xmath112 days after initial infection was chosen because regardless of parameter values , preliminary simulations have shown that the patient s t - cell count within will not have decreased to zero by this time . however ,",
    "if a later time is chosen , the patient s t - cell count could vanish before the final time is reached .     using @xmath113 random samples .",
    "this is referred to as the first _ active variable vector _ and denoted by @xmath114 . ]    in order to compute @xmath71 , one must be able to construct the gradient of the quantity of interest with respect to the normalized parameter space as required in step 3 of the algorithm . since we do not have an explicit representation for @xmath111 as a function of system parameters , we can not explicitly compute gradients .",
    "instead we approximate them using the aforementioned finite difference scheme with a step size of @xmath115 .",
    "additionally , each sample is chosen so that every normalized parameter is uniformly distributed between @xmath116 and @xmath117 , i.e. @xmath118)^{27}$ ] . in order to map this normalized parameter space onto the biologically - relevant range of parameter values ,",
    "we use the linear mapping @xmath119 for each of the random samples @xmath118)^{27}$ ] , where @xmath120 and @xmath121 are vectors containing the upper and lower bounds on the parameters , respectively .",
    "thus , the resulting vector @xmath122 represents the actual parameter values input within the model .",
    "next , a stiff differential equations solver ( matlab s ` ode23s ` function ) is used to compute the t - cell count after @xmath112 days .",
    "then , each of the @xmath64 parameters is perturbed by @xmath115 , and again the corresponding t - cell count after @xmath112 days is computed . with these two values ,",
    "the aforementioned finite difference approximation is used to calculate the gradient of @xmath123 with respect to the normalized model parameters . regarding the upper and lower limits , @xmath120 and @xmath121",
    "are taken to be @xmath124 above and below the standard values given in table  [ tab : paramvalues ] .",
    "figure [ fig : evalues1700 ] displays the approximate eigenvalues of the corresponding @xmath71 matrix",
    ". clearly a spectral gap exists between the first and second eigenvalues .        in order to automatically determine the optimal decomposition of @xmath125 we can use the relative measure of separation given by @xmath126 then",
    ", the dimension of the active subspace , i.e. the number of eigenvalues stored within @xmath86 , will be given by @xmath127 while the index of the largest value of @xmath128 describes the location of the largest spectral gap , it is often convenient to consider only the first two values @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "doing so limits the dimension of the active subspace to one and two respectively , which allows for easy visualization of the quantity of interest as a function of the active subspace and allows one to fit a curve or surface to the data .",
    "plotting the values of @xmath128 results in figure  [ fig : t1700sep ] .    clearly , with this measure of separation , the optimal choice for the dimension of the active subspace is merely one .",
    "consequently , we store @xmath131 in the matrix @xmath86 and the remaining eigenvalues @xmath132 ,",
    "@xmath133 , along the diagonal of @xmath87 .",
    "the active subspace is then generated by linear combinations of the entries of @xmath114 , the first eigenvector .",
    "figure  [ fig : wv1700 ] displays the eigenvector corresponding to the maximal eigenvalue shown in figure  [ fig : evalues1700 ] , and it can be seen that three parameters possess associated weights greater than @xmath134 .",
    "these are the @xmath135th , @xmath136nd , and @xmath137th parameters as ordered in table  [ tab : paramvalues ] . from the table",
    "these parameters can be identified as @xmath25 , @xmath24 , and @xmath37 , which represent the increase in macrophage population due to the immune system , the death rate of the macrophage population , and the death rate of the virus population , respectively .",
    "hence , small perturbations in these parameters will significantly alter the value of @xmath111 , as they are the most heavily weighted .",
    "contrastingly , changes within the remaining parameters , whose weights are near zero , will not have an appreciable affect on @xmath111 .",
    "plotting @xmath111 along the active subspace results in figure  [ fig : ssp1700 ] . here",
    ", the horizontal axis is represented by values of the first active variable @xmath138 , which represents a linear combination of the normalized parameters @xmath91 with weights given by entries of the first active variable vector @xmath114 . adopting the terminology of @xcite",
    ", we will refer to plots of the quantity of interest along the active subspace as _ sufficient summary plots_. figure  [ fig : ssp1700 ] ( left ) shows a clear trend , namely that @xmath139 is a decreasing function of the active variable .",
    "additionally , the data points within the sufficient summary plot can be fit to a particular function . in this case , a four parameter arctangent function is fit to the data to approximate the quantity of interest .",
    "this was performed using the matlab function ` lsqcurvefit ` which minimizes the residual ( in the least squares sense ) of the difference in the data and the approximation .",
    "hence , we have determined that the data is best fit by @xmath140 and the resulting curve can be found in the plot on the right side of figure  [ fig : ssp1700 ] . in order to test the accuracy of the nonlinear approximation",
    ", @xmath141 simulations were run and the relative error computed .",
    "the results are displayed in figure  [ fig : t1700errors ] and indicate that the approximation is typically within @xmath142 from the value computed by computationally solving to determine @xmath111 .",
    "stated another way , over @xmath143 of the test simulations returned approximations whose error was @xmath142 or less .",
    "of course , not every eigenvalue decomposition will necessarily result in a one - dimensional active subspace of the model parameters .",
    "for instance , should one wish to approximate the t - cell count @xmath144 days after initial infection , the same order reduction method can be employed and the eigenvalues of the @xmath71 matrix can be computed .",
    "the plot of the eigenvalues of @xmath71 can be seen in figure  [ fig : globalsep ] ( left ) . in this case",
    "the largest spectral gap exists between the second and third eigenvalues rather than the first and second , and therefore a more descriptive choice for the dimension of the active subspace is two instead of one .",
    "the two weight vectors corresponding to these dominant eigenvalues are then computed and sufficient summary plots are obtained .",
    "figure  [ fig : ssp2d ] shows the one and two dimensional sufficient summary plots , respectively , for the approximation of @xmath145 . considering the two dimensional sufficient summary plot in figure  [ fig : ssp2d ] ( right ) , it can be seen that very little variation occurs within the t - cell count in the vertical direction , which represents the second active variable .",
    "all of the variation in the t - cell count appears to transpire mostly in the horizontal direction . also , in figure  [ fig : ssp2d ] ( left ) we can see that the one dimensional sufficient summary plot clearly shows a distinct trend . for these reasons , the one - dimensional active subspace representation provides a sufficient description of the dynamics in the parameter space , while the second active variable does nt appear to contribute as greatly .",
    "hence , even though the largest spectral gap appears between the second and third eigenvalues , a single linear combination of the parameters captures the overwhelming majority of the dynamics , and only the one - dimensional representation is utilized .",
    "figure  [ fig : globalsep ] ( right ) displays the dimension of the active subspace at each time using the measure of separation and .",
    "since this algorithm can be used to approximate the t - cell count at any fixed time , we can further compute active subspaces to reduce complexity in the parameter space and obtain a simple time course for @xmath4 .",
    "we refer to such a model as a _ dynamic active subspace approximation_. within the next section we will demonstrate precisely how this reduced description can be constructed .",
    "now that the approximation for @xmath111 has been computed , this method can be repeated for a predetermined discretization of the time domain in order to create a global - in - time approximation for the t - cell count , say @xmath146 .",
    "first , it is necessary to choose the mesh on which @xmath4 will be approximated . in this case",
    "the time interval @xmath147 $ ] is divided into @xmath148 non - uniform subintervals and the active subspace decomposition , along with the associated eigenvalues and eigenvectors , is used to determine a functional approximation at each time step .",
    "next , one must orient the eigenvectors to point in approximately the same direction so that they transition smoothly from one time step to the next . by this",
    "we mean that the magnitude of the components of the consecutive weight vectors differ only slightly , but because the normalized eigenvector decomposition is only unique up to a sign , weight vectors at different time steps must be oriented so that they do not point in opposing directions . upon correctly orienting the weight vectors , nonlinear curve - fitting is employed to compute the functions that best fit the associated sufficient summary plots .    once",
    "the approximations have been computed at each time step , the final task is to dynamically assemble them using linear basis functions , namely @xmath149 where @xmath150 for all @xmath151 $ ] is a linear interpolation of the first active variable vector , @xmath152 , within the @xmath153 time interval , @xmath154 is the corresponding active variable , @xmath155 is the approximation to the t - cell count within the @xmath153 time interval , and @xmath156 is the hat function on the interval @xmath157 $ ] given by @xmath158",
    ".      \\end{aligned }      \\right.\\ ] ] recall that the original parameter values @xmath122 and the normalized parameters @xmath91 can be interchanged using .",
    "here we use the notation @xmath159 instead of @xmath146 because within the global - in - time approximation , the active variable vector , @xmath160 and hence the active variable @xmath161 , changes within differing time intervals .",
    "of course , a higher - order approximation can be obtained by expanding @xmath156 in a polynomial basis of greater degree .",
    "the results of computing the active subspace and sufficient summary plot for @xmath162 of the @xmath148 time steps can be found in appendix b. with this we see that trends in the sufficient summary plot transition smoothly from one time step to the next and at each fixed time @xmath163 the t - cell count can be represented by one of three distinct functional forms . in particular , curves that are fit to the data generated within sufficient summary plots transition from ( 1 ) linear to ( 2 ) arctangent trends at or around @xmath164 days after initial transmission , while for times greater than or equal to @xmath165 days , the trend resembles ( 3 ) an arctangent function multiplied by a heaviside step function .",
    "the last of these aproximations occurs during later periods of the time course when the t - cell count may vanish for certain values of the active variable .",
    "for example , figure  [ fig : ssp2600 ] displays a sufficient summary plot of the t - cell count at @xmath166 days after infection occurs . for large values of the first active variable ,",
    "say @xmath167 , we see that @xmath168 since a proportion of sample runs result in a patient s t - cell count tending to zero prior to @xmath166 days .",
    "contrastingly , for @xmath169 , the t - cell count trend resembles an arctangent function .",
    "these three specific functional approximations and their transitions comprehensibly display the biological aspects of all stages of infection dynamics . before discussing this further ,",
    "a minor discussion of hiv disease pathogenesis is needed .",
    "the time - course of hiv infection is characterized by three distinct stages : acute ( or primary ) infection , chronic infection ( also referred to as the clinical latency stage ) , and the transition to aids .",
    "the first of these phases takes place within @xmath170 weeks of initial introduction of the virus within a host and is characterized by a rapid fluctuation in the t - cell and virion population . with respect to the t - cell population",
    "there is initially a rapid decrease from the introduction of the virus , and then a rapid rebound arising from the body s immune response .",
    "symptoms during this phase of the infection include fever , swollen glands , fatigue , rash , and sore throat .",
    "the next stage , chronic infection , ranges from a number of years to over a decade without treatment . during the chronic period",
    "the t - cell and virion populations remain at relatively constant levels , with the t - cell population decreasing at a particularly slow rate and the number of virions increasing steadily . during the last stage of infection ,",
    "the transition to aids occurs as the t - cell population reaches a density lower than 200 cells per mm@xmath171 .",
    "the progression to aids is typically associated with a sharp decrease in the t - cell population within a year or so .    from the sufficient summary plots in figure [ fig:3stages ] and appendix b , the three distinct stages of the disease become clear .",
    "the three functional forms arising from sufficient summary plots precisely separate the three distinct stages of hiv disease progression within an infected individual - the initial arctangent function representing the acute phase , followed by a slow linear decline that denotes the asymptomatic or chronic phase , and finally the heaviside arctangent function detailing the decline of the t - cell count as a patient develops aids .",
    "this description of the t - cell population provides a detailed visual account of the three stages and the transitions between them .",
    "for clarity , a representative graph of each trend in the data is provided in figure [ fig:3stages ] .",
    "therefore , the abrupt changes in the t - cell count arising within the one - dimensional active subspace of parameters completely categorize the stages of disease pathogenesis .",
    "in addition to separating these stages of the disease , the active subspace method allows for the creation of three different types of approximate models .",
    "first , a visual representation of the quantity of interest - in this case , the t - cell count - as a function of the most pertinent linear combination of parameters within the original model is provided .",
    "additionally , the method allows for the construction of an explicit , analytic model by combining nonlinear function approximations such as over an interval of time . in this direction",
    "a second approximation method is available instead of utilizing basis functions as in .",
    "namely , one may prescribe the functional form during a particular stage of the disease and fit time - dependent coefficients to the transitions within sufficient summary plots .",
    "for instance , one may express the arctangent approximation over the timespan @xmath172 $ ] by @xmath173 for well - behaved functions @xmath174 , and @xmath175 that are fit to the changes in the data .",
    "this type of explicit approximation would be easiest to implement during the asymptomatic phase for which @xmath176 and the slope and @xmath7-intercept functions , @xmath177 and @xmath178 respectively , are given by the piecewise - defined or smoothed functions approximated in figure [ linfits ] .",
    "-intercept ( right ) functions , @xmath177 and @xmath178 , respectively for @xmath179 $ ] . ]",
    "-intercept ( right ) functions , @xmath177 and @xmath178 , respectively for @xmath179 $ ] . ]",
    "lastly , the nonlinear fits arising from the sufficient summary data can be easily stored and supply the basis for a low - cost computational approximation without the need to simulate the original model over long time periods .",
    "in contrast to simulating the full system of odes for each new set of parameter values , this computational model need only be precomputed once and can easily describe which of the parameters are most important and during which stages they significantly alter the biological quantities of interest . as parameters within",
    "the original hiv model vary amongst patients , they must be recomputed for each individual , and the computational savings provided by the reduced model is vital .",
    "utilizing the dynamical algorithm represented by , this computational model can be constructed and compared with a representative simulation of the full dynamical system .",
    "figure  [ fig : globalapprox ] displays both the simulated t - cell count and its global - in - time approximation using dynamic active subspaces .",
    "we note that because the active subspace method is global with respect to the parameter space , the precise values of parameters in table [ tab : paramvalues ] do not necessarily influence the structure of the active subspace model , as long as a feasible range of parameter values is available . in order to test the accuracy of the active subspace approximation to solutions of ,",
    "@xmath141 independent simulations were performed and the relative error was computed . within these error calculations a uniformly - distributed random time was selected along with a uniformly - drawn selection of the parameter values within their respective ranges .",
    "the result is shown in figure  [ fig : globalerror ] , and displays that for @xmath180 of simulations the analytic approximation varied less than @xmath142 from the value given by the stiff differential equation solver .",
    "hence , one may conclude that the global - in - time active subspace model well - approximates solutions to the original system of odes given in .",
    "[ fig : globalapprox ]      as determined in the previous section , not all parameters are required to describe the behavior of solutions within the model and those that are needed may not be important during each stage .",
    "therefore , it makes sense to investigate the construction of reduced models , namely those which eliminate the contributions of certain parameters . though the active subspace method has reduced the dimension of the parameter space upon which the t - cell count depends , all of the parameter values are still needed in order to compute the approximate solution , as the reduced parameter space has been expressed merely as a linear combination of the original parameter values , i.e. @xmath138 .",
    "however , the weights ( or coefficients ) within this linear combination , given by @xmath114 , should provide a clear method to reduce the original parameter space as well .",
    "for instance , assume that a parameter , say @xmath181 , possesses a corresponding weight entry @xmath182 that is very small in comparison to the other weights .",
    "then , variations in @xmath181 will have little to no effect on the reduced parameter space @xmath161 , and hence will not appreciably influence the output variable @xmath146 .",
    "thus , one can merely eliminate @xmath181 within the model or set @xmath183 rather than considering it as a parameter whose value could possibly vary depending upon the patient .    while it would be most beneficial to determine those weight vectors that remain small throughout the entire course of infection and remove the corresponding parameters , this is an unlikely scenario as different parameters will typically influence different stages in some substantial manner . for this reason ,",
    "a true global - in - time parameter reduction is highly unlikely .",
    "indeed , the computed weight vectors for this study show that at most @xmath1 of the @xmath64 parameters - namely , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 - could be eliminated without introducing enormous variations in the behavior of the model during some stage of infection .",
    "such a limited reduction in complexity would be marginally beneficial to the expense of computations . instead , we may separate the dynamics into the three distinct stages of the disease and use parameter reduction to create new models for each stage separately . by eliminating the associated interactions from we",
    "may derive a simpler system that still accurately predicts each of the three phases of infection .    as an illustrative example",
    ", we consider the weight vectors arising within the first @xmath184 days of initial infection and remove parameters whose weights remain below a fixed threshold throughout this interval of time . using a relatively strict threshold , in this case @xmath185 , a number of parameters are removed from , namely @xmath23 , @xmath30 , @xmath12 , @xmath25 , @xmath186 , @xmath28 , @xmath187 , @xmath188 , @xmath29 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath21 , @xmath24 , @xmath27 , @xmath189 , and @xmath17 . with these parameters",
    "eliminated , the @xmath16 , @xmath22 , @xmath26 , and @xmath20 populations decouple from the remaining equations .",
    "this implies that latently - infected t - cells , macrophages ( both healthy and infected ) , and cytotoxic lymphocytes do not play an important role in the early behavior of the disease , i.e. within the first five to six weeks of introduction of the virus within the body .",
    "because these populations decouple , it s necessary to remove @xmath190 ( whose maximum weight during the first @xmath184 days is @xmath191 ) and set @xmath14 = 1 , thereby yielding the reduced system for the acute stage , namely @xmath192 this model is an augmented form of the well - known three - component model ( see @xcite ) with an additional michaelis - menten term within the t - cell population , which accounts for the homeostatic proliferation of such cells upon depletion of this compartment due to interactions with virions .",
    "this model was recently analyzed in detail in @xcite and found to possess many desirable properties , including bistable equilibria which explain the dependence of infection dynamics on the initial t - cell count and viral load , as well as the existence of a hopf bifurcation which describe oscillations within the system . using the fitted parameter values given in @xcite for the model and plotting against the full model with the standard parameter values given in table [ tab : paramvalues ] results in figure [ fig : reducedmodel ] .",
    "hence , for the acute stage we have reduced with @xmath64 independent parameters , to , which features only @xmath193 parameters . following the same procedure for the other two stages would further reduce the dimension of the parameter space in the model at later stages of the infection .",
    "these reduced models could then be used to analyze the disease separately within each distinct stage of infection and with much less computational cost .",
    "if a global model is still preferred in comparison to separating models by stage , one can perform this parameter reduction for all three stages subject to the constraint that values of @xmath4 within time - adjacent models be equal and a new global - in - time dynamical model arises by construction .",
    "such a reduced , long - term model would be comparable to that of figure [ fig : globalapprox ] .",
    "the current study concerns an analysis of the system , which is one of the only mathematical models to accurately represent all three stages of hiv infection within a host .",
    "a unique , biologically - relevant virus - free equilibrium was shown to exist , and conditions were determined that guarantee the local asymptotic stability of this state .",
    "then , using dynamic active subspaces , the system of seven odes with @xmath64 parameters was approximated by algebraic and computational models while retaining the majority of pertinent information and system behavior .",
    "this method enabled the discovery of a dominant subspace of parameters , within which the t - cell count is most sensitive to perturbations , and allowed us to perform thorough parameter studies in this direction , rather than the complete @xmath64-dimensional parameter space .",
    "in general , active subspace methods also provide for a deeper visualization of the dependence of solutions on the parameter space , as well as , an analytic model to describe the quantity of interest and a computational model for which solutions are less expensive to construct .",
    "the efficacy of the model was investigated by calculating the relative error compared to solutions of solved with a stiff ode solver .    as with any study ,",
    "a number of future questions arise from our investigation .",
    "first , as many parameter values within are not specifically known and vary greatly in the literature , one would like to quantify the uncertainty inherent in choosing a particular value for each .",
    "while this can be investigated using the approximations established herein , it was not the focus of the study and more complex mathematical tools are needed to do so .",
    "another direction to consider is the explicit quantification of error within the lower - dimensional approximations provided by active subspaces .",
    "some preliminary results appear in @xcite , but exact bounds and convergence theorems for dynamic , rather than time - independent , active subspaces are currently unavailable within the literature .",
    "finally , we note that these methods can be used for other in - host models of hiv ( or other physical and biological models @xcite ) that possess high - dimensional parameter spaces .",
    "for instance , a recent refinement of was proposed in @xcite , and appears to display less sensitivity to variations in parameter values .",
    "hence , a similar technique would likely be useful to conduct a parameter study or construct a reduced - order model for this system .",

    "hence , we find the steady state @xmath41    we note that assuming all parameter values are strictly positive implies that the only non - infective steady state of biological significance is @xmath46 .",
    "finally , we sketch the proof of the asymptotic stability result , which utilizes standard methods from the theory of dynamical systems ( i.e. the hartman - grobman and routh - hurtwitz theorems ) to determine the qualitative behavior of the @xmath46 steady state from ( [ hadji ] ) .    as the model is not positivity - preserving a simple technique like the next - generation method does not apply .",
    "hence , we will utilize the hartman - grobman theorem to arrive at the stated result and omit some of the more technical details .",
    "we begin by computing the jacobian of ( [ hadji ] ) evaluated at the steady states @xmath46    = 1mu @xmath208    from this , we can see that three eigenvalues are certainly real and negative @xmath209 the remaining four eigenvalues are more difficult to identify as they are determined by the quartic equation @xmath210 where @xmath211 @xmath212 and @xmath213 , @xmath214 , and @xmath215 are given by much longer expressions and not necessarily positive .    instead , we must impose conditions on each term to guarantee positivity , which is needed for the roots of the quartic to possess negative real part by the routh - hurwitz criteria .",
    "in particular , the two negative terms in @xmath215 are dominated by the remaining positive terms if and only if @xmath216 and @xmath217 the same conditions imply the positivity of @xmath214 . for @xmath213 ,",
