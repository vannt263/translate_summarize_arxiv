    "the determination of optimal decay rate is difficult and has not a complete answer in the general case . in the 1-d case ,",
    "it was performed mostly , see @xcite , and to references therein . for higher dimension ,",
    "g. lebeau gives in @xcite the explicit ( and optimal ) value of the best decay rate in terms of the spectral abscissa of the generator of the semigroup and the mean value of a damping cofficient along the rays of geometrical optics .    in this paper , we describe , in abstract setting , the optimal decay rate for some petrowsky - like dissipative systems in terms of spectral quantity of the corresponding infinitesimal generator of the underlying dynamic .",
    "the main idea is to identify the optimal energy decay rate with the supremum of the real part of the associated dissipative operator . to do this",
    ", it is enough to show that the set of the corresponding generalized eigenvectors forms a riesz basis of the energy space .",
    "the approach used here is based on some resolvent estimates which is obtained by a perturbative method .    in case of the damped wave operator , cox and zuazua ( @xcite )",
    "adopt the shooting method based on an ansatz of horn .",
    "this approach consists in constructing an explicit approximation of the characteristic equation of the underlying system . under the assumption that the damping is of bounded variation",
    ", they obtained high frequency asymptotic expansions of the spectrum .",
    "the shooting method can be used only for one - dimensional boundary value problems .    in the both cases ,",
    "we require precise knowledge of the spectrum of the corresponding non self - adjoint operators , more precisely , the behavior of the high frequency set .",
    "the advantage of our approach is that it works in any dimension and in a very general setting ( see @xcite and also @xcite ) .",
    "let us introduce the abstract setting .",
    "let @xmath0 be a hilbert space equipped with the norm @xmath1 .",
    "let @xmath2 be an unbounded operator on @xmath0 , self - adjoint , positive and with compact inverse .",
    "we denote its domain by @xmath3 .",
    "let @xmath4 be a bounded operator from @xmath5 to @xmath0 , where @xmath6 is another hilbert space which will be identified with its dual .",
    "we consider the following system : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the time and @xmath9 the scaled hilbert space with the norm @xmath10 , @xmath11 .    from now on , we set @xmath12 .",

    "the system ( [ eqd1 ] ) is well - posed .",
    "more precisely , the following classical result holds .",
    "[ exist ] suppose that @xmath24 . then the problem ( [ eqd1 ] ) admits a unique solution @xmath25 in the space @xmath26 moreover the solution @xmath25 satisfies the following energy identity : @xmath27 where @xmath28    from ( [ esten ] ) it follows that the mapping @xmath29 is non - increasing . in many applications",
    "it is important to know if this mapping decays exponentially when @xmath30 , i.e. , if the system ( [ eqd1 ] ) is exponentially stable .",
    "one of the methods currently used for proving such exponential stability results is based on an observability inequality for the conservative system associated to the initial value problem @xmath31    it is well - known that ( [ eqd4 ] ) is well - posed in @xmath20 .",
    "the result below , proved in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , shows that the exponential stability of ( [ eqd1 ] ) is equivalent to an observability inequality for ( [ eqd4 ] ) .",
    "[ princx ] the system described by ( [ eqd1 ] ) is exponentially stable in @xmath20 if and only if there exist @xmath32 and @xmath33 such that @xmath34    the spectrum of @xmath2 is given by @xmath35 and the family @xmath36 of corresponding normalized eigenvectors of @xmath2 is an orthonormal basis of @xmath0 .",
    "now , we can describe the spectrum of the skew - adjoint operator @xmath37 by the following :    [ undampedspectra ] the eigenvalues of @xmath37 and the corresponding eigenvectors are given by : @xmath38,\\quad \\hbox{for all}\\quad k\\in \\mathbb n^*.\\ ] ] moreover , the family @xmath39 is an orthonormal basis of the energy space @xmath20 .",
    "as mentionned in the above , we give the value of the fastest decay rate of solution of the equation , in terms of the spectral abscissa of the generator @xmath40 .",
    "let @xmath41 be the _ spectral abscissa _ of @xmath40 given by : @xmath42 here @xmath43 denotes the spectrum of @xmath40 .",
    "in order to state the result on the optimal decay rate , we define the decay rate , depending on @xmath4 , as @xmath44 @xmath45 according to ( [ esten ] ) , @xmath46 ( see @xcite and also @xcite ) .",
    "it follows easily that , @xmath47    the following assumption concern the high frequencies of @xmath19 .",
    "more precisely , it deals with the behavior of the gap between two consecutive high frequencies of @xmath19 . for @xmath48 , we define @xmath49 we assume that    [ a1 ] @xmath50 ,    and    [ a2 ]    @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the space of square integrable sequences .    * remarks *    * the assumption [ a1 ] implies that the high frequencies of @xmath53 are simple .",

    "we need to study the high frequency of @xmath60 , and in particular their algebraic multiplicities . using the fact that the distance between two consecutive eigenvalues tends to infinity at infinity , as well as the fact that the dissipation is bounded , we construct in subsection [ description ] a closed curves @xmath61 ( for some integer @xmath62 sufficiently large ) in the complex plane such that :    * for all @xmath63 , @xmath64 is centered in ( @xmath65 ) .",
