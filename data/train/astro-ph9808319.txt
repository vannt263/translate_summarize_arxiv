    "the gamma - ray burst ( grb ) 980703 of 1998 july 3.18 ut was detected by the all sky - monitor ( asm ) of the rossi x - ray timing explorer , ulysses , batse , and the gamma - ray burst monitor of bepposax ( levine , morgan , & muno 1998 ; hurley & kouveliotou 1998 ; kippen 1998 ; amati et al .",
    "the 4-radius asm position was further refined to a 50-radius error circle with observations using the narrow field instruments on bepposax ( galama et al .",
    "1998a ) .",
    "radio observations were begun on 1998 july 4.41 ut at the very large array ( vla ) in socorro , nm . a single , weak radio source was seen coincident with an optically variable source ( frail et al .",
    "subsequent optical and radio observations ( zapatero osorio et al .  1998 ;",
    "vreeswijk et al .",
    "1998 ; bloom et al .  1998a ; frail et al .",
    "1998b ) confirmed the transient nature of the source . following a now - familiar pattern , we identify the radio and optical transient to be the afterglow of grb 980703 .",
    "we present a log of the optical and infrared ( ir ) imaging photometry in table [ tab : obs ] .",
    "data were obtained using a ccd imager at the palomar 60-inch telescope , and lris ( oke et al .",
    "1995 ) and nirc ( matthews & soifer 1994 ) instruments at the keck 10-m telescopes .",
    "all nights were photometric .",
    "flux calibration of the optical images was performed in the johnson - kron - cousins magnitude system using the standard field pg ( landolt 1992 ) , including a color term and an atmospheric extinction correction .",
    "the ir data were calibrated using the standards sj 9186 and sj 9101 ( persson 1998 ) . in figure 1",
    "we give a finding chart for the transient .",
    "vla monitoring of grb 980703 was carried out at 1.43 , 4.86 and 8.46 ghz .",
    "in addition , an observation was made on 1998 july 10.53 ut using the scuba array on the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) at 220 ghz . at 1.43 ghz",
    "the source has remained weak ( @xmath2 @xmath3jy ) . at 4.86 ghz",
    "the source exhibited a large degree of variability , consistent with interstellar scattering . at 8.46 ghz    [ fig : dis ]",
    "the flux has been relatively steady with a mean of 940 @xmath3jy during the first 11 days after the grb . despite excellent conditions ,",
    "no 220 ghz source was visible above a 2-@xmath4 error limit of 5.2 mjy .",
    "the observed scintillation and the broad - band spectrum of grb 980703 are similar to other well - studied radio afterglows ( e.g.  shepherd et al .",
    "1998 , taylor et al .  1998 ) . further discussion on the radio properties of this grb can be found in frail et al .",
    "( 1998c ) .",
    "in table [ tab : obs ] we summarize the measured fluxes at the position of the transient . in figure 2",
    "we plot the optical and ir light - curves of the transient source .",
    "it is a prediction of spherical fireball models that the late - time light curves of grb afterglow should closely follow a power - law decline and , indeed , this has been observed ( e.g.  galama et al .  1998b ; zharikov , sokolov , & baryshev 1998 ) .",
    "the presence of a host galaxy will cause the light - curve to flatten eventually .",
    "we thus model the light - curve as @xmath5 , with the decay constant ( @xmath6 ) , and the corresponding normalization of the transient flux ( @xmath7 ) , and the host galaxy flux ( @xmath8 ) . in table",
    "[ tab : fit ] we give our light - curve fits to this ot + host flux model . only the @xmath9- and @xmath10-band had a sufficient number of data points to fit for the three parameters independently .",
    "the weighted average of decay constants for the @xmath10-band and @xmath9-band ( table [ tab : fit ] ) give @xmath11 .",
    "for the ir bands , we assume @xmath12 and fit for @xmath8 and @xmath7 . in the case of the @xmath13-band and @xmath14-band we report the last observed magnitude as @xmath8 .",
    "it is of interest to quantify any potential offset of the transient from its host galaxy as the distribution of offsets may help to constrain the various progenitor models . using the methodology outlined in bloom et al .",
    "( 1998b ) , we registered the keck lris images taken on july 6 and july 18 ( see table [ tab : obs ] ) accounting for the relative scale , rotation , translation , and second - order distortion .",
    "the r.m.s .",
    "centroid differences of the transformed star positions ( including both axes ) was @xmath15 milliarcsec .",
    "we find the angular separation of the ot and the host galaxy to be 63 milliarcsec , which includes the error of the transformation and centering errors of the objects themselves .",
    "however , the transient contributed only 30% of the total ot + host flux on the first epoch .",
    "thus , we conclude the transient is offset by 210 @xmath16 120 milliarcsec ; this angular separation is consistent with no offset from the host galaxy at the 1.8-@xmath4 level .",
    "the small offset of the afterglow from the underlying galaxy suggests , like most other well - studied grbs ( e.g.  sahu et al .  1997 ; odewahn et al .",
    "1998 ) , that grb 980703 is closely connected to its host galaxy .",
    "if indeed the galaxy is the host , then at @xmath17 it is the brightest ( apparent ) host galaxy of any cosmological grb thus far ( see hogg & fruchter 1998 for a review ) . in a companion paper djorgovski et al .",
    "( 1998 ) derive a redshift for the ot + host of @xmath18 . assuming @xmath19 km s@xmath20 mpc@xmath20 and @xmath21 , the luminosity distance to the host is @xmath22 cm .",
    "a cubic - spline fit to the host spectrum ( table [ tab : fit ] ) gives a flux density of @xmath23jy at 8745  , the redshifted effective wavelength of the @xmath13-band .",
    "this corresponds to an absolute magnitude of @xmath24 .",
    "the host is thus a typical galaxy at the knee of the @xmath13-band luminosity function at the epoch of @xmath25 ( e.g.  lilly et al .",
    "1995 ) . in the july 18 lris images",
    "the galaxy appears marginally extended with a fwhm of 0.74  in 0.65  seeing .    in discussing the interpretation of the specific features of the optical - ir spectrum",
    "we will assume an adiabatic hydrodynamical evolution of the afterglow and that the cooling frequency ( @xmath26 ) is blue - ward of the peak frequency ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "see sari , piran , & narayan ( 1998 ) for details .    the optical and ir transient flux at day 5.3 ( july 8.5 ut ) are fit by a spectral slope of @xmath28 with some indication of a break near 1 @xmath3 m ( figure 2 ) . in the case of grb 971214 , where the behavior was quite similar , the ir / optical data required an additional extinction correction ( presumably dust extinction local to the grb ) to fit the expectations of the fireball model ( ramaprakash et al .  1998 ; wijers & galama  1998 ) .",
    "indeed , without an extinction correction , an extrapolation of the ir / optical spectrum would under - predict the x - ray point ( galama et al .",
    "1998a ) by several orders of magnitude .",
    "if the ir / optical / x - ray behavior were simultaneously in the cooling regime , the spectral slope expected from our derived @xmath6 would be @xmath29 .",
    "no value of extinction can correct the observed ir / optical spectral slope without _ under - predicting _ the x - ray point by more than a factor of ten .",
    "we therefore exclude the possibility that the ir / optical / x - ray were simultaneously in the cooling regime on july 8.5 .",
    "the other possibility is that @xmath26 had not yet moved into the ir / optical bands ; in this case we expect a spectral index of @xmath30 .",
    "indeed , fitting the ir / optical data with a galactic extinction curve to this expected power - law slope , we find that with an extinction correction of @xmath31 ( castro - tirado et al .",
    "1998 found @xmath32 ) , the ir / optical data can be made consistent with @xmath33 . nevertheless , extrapolating the extinction - corrected spectrum _ over - predicts _ the x - ray flux by a factor of 10 ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "to this end , we suggest that there must be a cooling break ( @xmath34 hz ) between the ir / optical and x - ray bands on july 8.5 ut .",
    "this observation leads immediately to the value for electron energy spectral index @xmath35 , consistent with other afterglows ( e.g.  yoshida et al .",
    "1998 ; sokolov et al .  1998 ) . furthermore ,",
    "the measured decay constants are consistent with this picture . since the x - ray transient was observed while in the cooling regime its time decay ( @xmath36 ; galama et al .",
    "1998a ) is _ expected _ to be steeper than that measured from the ir / optical ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "our model fits to early - time observations do allow us to constrain additional properties of the afterglow . assuming the standard bandpass shapes and zero - magnitude calibration ( fukugita , shimasaku , & ichikawa 1995 ; bessel & brett 1988 ) , our fit ( table [ tab : fit ] ) to the transient light - curve , and an extinction of @xmath38",
    ", we find a total integrated fluence over @xmath9- , @xmath10- , @xmath39- , @xmath40- , and @xmath41-bands from day 1 onwards of @xmath42 erg @xmath43 . for comparison ,",
    "the fluence above 20 kev in the grb itself was @xmath44 erg @xmath43 ( kippen 1998 ) .",
    "we estimate the total x - ray fluence ( 1.3  10 kev ) from day one onwards of @xmath45 erg @xmath43 using the data reported in galama et al .",
    "( 1998a ) .",
    "the fluence ratio is then @xmath46 : @xmath47 : @xmath48 = 1 : 8 : 575 .",
    "the associated total energy release ( @xmath49 ) is @xmath50 erg , @xmath51 erg , and @xmath52 erg .",
    "since @xmath53 is much larger than the sum of the inferred energy release at all other frequencies ( including radio ) , we suggest the shock can not be radiative , but rather is adiabatic .    in conclusion",
    ", the broad - band spectrum and the light curves demonstrates the general consistency of the afterglow spectrum and the expectations of an adiabatic relativistic blastwave .",
    "correction of the intrinsic extinction suggests that the synchrotron cooling break frequency was somewhere between the optical and x - ray bands on july 8.5 ut . since the inferred intrinsic",
    "extinction is @xmath54 mag greater than the extinction inferred toward the host s hii regions ( djorgovski et al .",
    "1998 ) , this suggests that the grb could have occurred in a dusty environment .",
    "we thank f.  chaffee , the director of the w.  m.  keck observatory , for allocation of service time observations .",
    "the staff of wmko and of the palomar observatory are thanked for their continued effort on the grb project .",
    "we thank w.  wack , t.  williams , e.  morris , m.  pierce , and a.  conrad for service observations at keck and p.  groot for assistance during our latest keck run .",
