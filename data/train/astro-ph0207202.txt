    "the key assumption underlying the standard picture of structure formation is that the luminous objects form in a gravitational potential of dark matter halos .",
    "therefore , a detailed description of halo density profiles as well as of their clustering properties is the most basic step toward constructing the formation and evolution of galaxies and clusters .    more specifically , the importance of the detailed studies of density profiles of dark halos is two - fold :    ( i ) theoretical interest ; : :    what is the final ( quasi-)equilibrium state of cosmological    self - gravitating systems ( as long as the energy dissipation is    neglected ) ?",
    "one may easily think of two quite distinct , but equally    plausible , possibilities ;    +    1 .",
    "the systems reach a certain universal distribution which is    independent of the cosmological initial condition .    2 .",
    "the systems somehow keep the memory of the cosmological initial    condition even at the highly nonlinear regime",
    ".    +    the singular isothermal sphere : @xmath0 may    be a reasonable possibility along the line of the idea ( a ) . as a    matter of fact , quite often i meet people who argue that the idea ( b )    is unlikely because of the strong nonlinear nature of the gravitation .",
    "in such an occasion , i present an example of the well - known stable    clustering solution for the nonlinear two - point correlation function    ( davis & peebles 1977 ) : @xmath1 this    provides a good specific case that the cosmological initial condition    is not erased and imprinted even in the strongly nonlinear behavior as    is well confirmed by later numerical simulations ( e.g. , suto 1993 ;    suginohara et al .",
    "of course the answer to the final state of    cosmological self - gravitating systems may not be unique since it    should really depend on the specifics and scales of the systems under    consideration .",
    "for instance , it is clearly hopeless to extract any    meaningful cosmological information from the precise data on the orbit    of the earth around the sun ; all the initial memory should have been    lost due to the strongly nonlinear and chaotic nature of the    gravitation .",
    "nevertheless the final state of dark matter halos    corresponding to galaxy- and cluster - scales is a well - defined problem    which may be reliably answered with the current high - resolution    numerical simulations independently of the physical intuition .",
    "( ii ) practical application ; : :    whether or not the density profiles of dark halos keep the    cosmological initial memory , the quantitative ( empirical ) prediction    of the profile for a given set of cosmological parameters has several    profound astrophysical implications including the rotation curve of    spiral galaxies , reconstruction of the mass distribution from the    weak - lensing , and x - ray and sz observations of galaxy clusters . in    particular , the confrontation of those testable predictions against    the accurate observational data may even challenge the cold dark    matter paradigm itself .    in this article , first i will review the summary of the past studies of the density profiles of dark matter halos , and then present some applications of those results .",
    "the study of the density profiles of cosmological self - gravitating systems or dark halos has a long history .",
    "table 2 is my personal ( and thus incomplete ) summary of some past work that i recognize ( or at least i have really read those papers ) .",
    "hoffman & shaham ( 1985 ) argued , on the basis of the secondary infall model ( gunn & gott 1972 ) , that the density profile around peaks is given by @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the spectral index of the density fluctuation field . the resulting power index @xmath4 is close to , but slightly differ from , that for the stable clustering solution for the nonlinear two - point correlation function @xmath5 .",
    "in any case this result implies that the density profile of dark halos _ does _ keep the initial memory .",
    "many subsequent numerical simulations seem to have confirmed the prediction of hoffman & shaham ( 1985 ) . while some authors have reported the existence of a kind of universal profile , they were not able to specify its functional form . in this respect ,",
    "the proposal of the specific universal density profile by navarro , frenk & white ( 1995 , 1996 , 1997 ) was really a breakthrough .",
    "they suggested that all simulated density profiles can be well fitted to the following simple model ( now referred to as the nfw profile ) : @xmath6 by an appropriate choice of the scaling radius @xmath7 as a function of the halo mass @xmath8 .",
    "considering the previous conclusion from numerical simulations , their claim was quite surprising and , in some sense , contradictory .",
    "it turned out that most simulations prior to their discovery did not have sufficient mass - resolution to reliably represent the deep central gravitational potential , which gives rise to an artificial central core .",
    "this presents a good example that the quantitative difference leads to the qualitatively different interpretation of the physical phenomena ; now the density profile of dark halos seems to lose the initial memory , and thus the answer to the final ( quasi-)equilibrium state of cosmological self - gravitating systems changes even in a qualitative way ; from the possibility ( a ) to ( b ) mentioned in the previous section !",
    ".the stable solution and the density profile around peaks . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     = 11.0 cm    = 10.0 cm",
    "the advantage of the nfw profile is that it is completely specified for a given of cosmological parameters .",
    "therefore this leads to a variety of testable quantitative predictions .",
    "in fact , one can write down all the necessary formulae in the following concise manner : @xmath9 where @xmath10(z ) is the critical density of the universe at @xmath11 @xmath12 the characteristic halo density contrast @xmath13 , and the scaling radius @xmath14 are written in terms of the concentration parameter as @xmath15 finally the virial radius @xmath16 and the concentration parameter are given as @xmath17 the expression for @xmath18 is the fitting formula in lcdm ( lambda cold dark matter ) by bullock et al .",
    "( 2001 ) .",
    "then the corresponding mass profile and the circular velocity are computed in a straightforward manner as @xmath19 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath20 } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the above results explicitly show that one can in principle compare the universal density profile with the observational data without any unknown free parameter .",
    "this is why the reported disagreement with the mass profile reconstructed from weak / strong lensing ( tyson et al . 1998 ) and the rotation curves of dwarf / low surface brightness galaxies ( e.g. , moore et al . 1999 ; de blok et al .",
    "2001 ) , if real , can not be easily accommodated in the context of the standard paradigm of cold dark matter .",
    "another important application of the universal density profile of dark halos may be found in x - ray emission from galaxy clusters .",
    "a simple but realistic approximation is the isothermal gas distribution in hydrostatic equilibrium embedded in the nfw halo gravitational potential .",
    "actually the hydrostatic equilibrium equation : @xmath22 combined with the nfw profile and equation of state @xmath23 can be analytically integrated ( makino , sasaki & suto 1998 ; suto , sasaki & makino 1998 ) as @xmath24 more surprising is the fact that the above model is very close to the conventional @xmath21 model .",
    "indeed we found the following fit as illustrated in figure 3 : @xmath25^{3\\beta_{\\rm eff}/2 } } , \\\\ a & \\approx & - 0.178b + 0.982 = -0.013b + 0.982~(b \\equiv 2b/27 ) , \\cr r_{\\rm c , eff } & \\approx & 0.22r_s , \\qquad \\beta_{\\rm eff } \\approx   0.9b = 0.067b . \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    as far as i understand , this work is the first analytical model for the cluster gas distribution obtained by consistently solving the poisson equation for the underlying halo mass distribution . the fact that the resulting gas profile is quite similar to the isothermal @xmath21 model , widely used as a good empirical model , is encouraging . on the other hand ,",
    "the expected core sizes of clusters seem to be significantly smaller than the observational ones ( fig .",
    "4 ) . in fact ,",
    "rotation curves of dwarf / lsb galaxies ( moore et al .",
    "1999 ; de blok et al . 2001 ) and the mass profile reconstructed for the galaxy cluster cl0024 ( tyson et al .",
    "1998 ) also indicate the presence of the core , rather than cusp , in the halo density profile . while this is still controversial at this point , spergel & steinhard ( 2000 ) among others even proposed to abandon the collisionless nature of dark matter to reconcile the reported discrepancy .",
    "since the cold dark matter model is known to successfully reproduce the large - scale structure of the universe ( @xmath26mpc ) , the possible collision of dark matter should be effective only at scales below 1mpc .",
    "the required collision cross section @xmath27 for a dark matter particle of mass @xmath28 may be obtained by assuming @xmath29 this may be rewritten as @xmath30 or equivalently as @xmath31 the corresponding mean collision time - scale is @xmath32 the above rough estimate is encouraging because in the hubble time collisional dark matter with the cross section of an order @xmath33@xmath34/g will affect the central part of dark halos only while keeping the larger - scale behavior intact .",
    "more detailed study of the effect of collision should be made again with numerical simulations .",
    "yoshida et al . ( 1999 ) and dav et al . ( 2001 ) conducted such simulations and found that dark matter models with @xmath35 lead to the formation of the softened central core , rather than cusp , in cluster - sized halos .",
    "the models , however , simultaneously produce too spherical halos to be compatible with the gravitational lensing observations ( miralda - escude 2002 ) .",
    "in addition , there are other indications to favor the presence of halos on the basis of the gravitational lensing statistics ( molikawa & hattori 2001 ; oguri et al .",
    "2001 ; takahashi & chiba 2001 ; li & ostriker 2001 ) .",
    "furthermore , cl0024 seems to be a very complicated system and thus the interpretation of its density profile is not straightforward ( czoske et al .",
    "actually it is rather surprising that the fairly accurate scaling relation applies after the spherical average despite the fact that the departure from the spherical symmetry is quite visible in almost all simulated halos ( fig .",
    "a more realistic modeling of dark matter halos beyond the spherical approximation is important in understanding various observed properties of galaxy clusters and non - linear clustering ( especially the high - order clustering statistics ) of dark matter in general . in particular ,",
    "the non - sphericity of dark halos is supposed to play a central role in the x - ray morphologies of clusters , in the cosmological parameter determination via the sunyaev - zeldovich effect and in the prediction of the cluster weak lensing and the gravitational arc statistics ( bartelmann et al .",
    "1998 ; meneghetti et al .",
    "2000 , 2001 ; molikawa & hattori 2001 , oguri et al 2001 ) .",
    "recently jing & suto ( 2002 ) presented a detailed non - spherical modeling of dark matter halos on the basis of a combined analysis of the high - resolution halo simulations ( 12 halos with @xmath36 particles within their virial radius ) and the large cosmological simulations ( 5 realizations with @xmath37 particles in a @xmath38mpc boxsize ) .",
    "the density profiles of those simulated halos are well approximated by a sequence of the concentric triaxial distribution with their axis directions being fairly aligned .",
    "they characterize the triaxial model quantitatively by generalizing the universal density profile which has previously been discussed only in the framework of the spherical model , and obtain a series of practically useful fitting formulae in applying the triaxial model ; the mass and redshift dependence of the axis ratio , the mean of the concentration parameter , and the probability distribution functions of the the axis ratio and the concentration parameter",
    ". their triaxial description of the dark halos will be particularly useful in predicting a variety of nonsphericity effects , to a reasonably reliable degree , including the weak and strong lens statistics , the orbital evolution of galactic satellites and triaxiality of galactic halos , and the non - linear clustering of dark matter .",
    "some applications of the triaxial halo model is now in progress ( lee & suto 2002 ) .",
    "all cosmological observations are carried out on a light - cone , the null hypersurface of an observer at @xmath39 , and not on any constant - time hypersurface . thus clustering amplitude and shape of objects",
    "should naturally evolve even _ within _ the survey volume of a given observational catalogue . unless restricting the objects at a narrow bin of @xmath11 at the expense of the statistical significance , the proper understanding of the data requires a theoretical model to take account of the average over the light cone ( matsubara , suto , & szapudi 1997 ; mataresse et al .",
    "1997 ; moscardini et al . 1998 ; nakamura , matsubara , & suto 1998 ; yamamoto & suto 1999 ; suto et al .",
    "we take account of all relevant physical effects and construct an empirical model for the two - point correlation functions of dark halos on the light - cone ( hamana , colombi , & suto 2001a ; hamana , yoshida , suto & evrard 2001b ) .",
    "= 8.0 cm    = 7.5 cm    figure 6 plots the projected distribution of identified halos from `` light - cone output '' of the hubble volume @xmath40cdm simulation ( evrard et al .",
    "2002 ) with @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "figure 7 displays the redshift distribution of the cumulative mass functions of the identified halos with @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 .",
    "the total number of the corresponding halos at @xmath49 is 21,090 , 5,554 and 1,543 , respectively . for comparison",
    ", we also plot the predictions on the basis of the press - schechter mass function ( _ short - dashed lines _ ) , the modified mass function by sheth & tormen ( 1999 ; _ dotted lines _ ) , and the fitting model by jenkins et al .",
    "( 2001 ; _ long - dashed lines _ ) .",
    "the press - schechter model underpredicts the halo abundance at @xmath50 , while the sheth - tormen model overpredicts beyond @xmath51 .",
    "this tendency is consistent with the previous finding of jenkins et al .",
    "( 2001 ) that the sheth - tormen model overestimates the number of halos when ln(@xmath52 ) becomes large .",
    "figure 8 compares our model predictions with the clustering of simulated halos . for the dark matter correlation functions ,",
    "our model reproduces the simulation data almost perfectly at @xmath53mpc ( see also hamana et al .",
    "this scale corresponds to the mean particle separation of this particular simulation , and thus the current simulation systematically underestimates the real clustering below this scale especially at @xmath54 .",
    "our model and simulation data also show quite good agreement for dark halos at scales larger than @xmath55mpc .",
    "below that scale , they start to deviate slightly in a complicated fashion depending on the mass of halo and the redshift range .",
    "this discrepancy may be ascribed to both the numerical limitations of the current simulations and our rather simplified model for the halo biasing .",
    "nevertheless the clustering of _ clusters _ on scales below @xmath55mpc is difficult to determine observationally anyway , and our model predictions differ from the simulation data only by @xmath56 percent at most . therefore we conclude that in practice our empirical model provides a successful description of halo clustering on the light - cone .",
    "as i have briefly shown in the above sections , understanding of the density profiles and clustering of dark halos has been significantly advanced during last several years . with those theoretical / empirical successes in mind ,",
    "the next natural question is how to apply them for the description of _ real _ galaxy clusters . in principle",
    "this may be fairly straightforward , but in reality the main obstacle is the lack of the proper definition of clusters .",
    "this point of view is clearly illustrated in figure 9 which summarizes the conventional definitions of _ clusters / halos _ in various situations .",
    "there are a wide range of practical ( and quite different ! ) definitions of dark halos and clusters of galaxies .",
    "of course they are closely related , but the one - to - one correspondence is unlikely and nothing but a working hypothesis .",
    "we we need more quantitative justification or modification of the working hypothesis in order to move on to _ precision cosmology with clusters_.    this problem has not been considered seriously probably because the agreement between model predictions and available observations seems already _ satisfactory_. in fact , since current viable cosmological models are specified by a set of many _ adjustable _",
    "parameters , the agreement does not necessarily justify the underlying assumption . thus it is dangerous to stop doubting the unjustified assumption because of the ( apparent ) success .",
