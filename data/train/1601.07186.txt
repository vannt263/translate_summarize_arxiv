    "observations of star formation in our galaxy and in extragalactic systems show that stars are formed inefficiently . a common approach for parameterizing the star formation rate",
    "( sfr ) efficiency is to express @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the star formation rate per unit volume , @xmath4 is the volume density of gas , @xmath5 is the local gas free fall time , and @xmath6 is the star formation rate efficiency ( i.e. the fraction of gas that turns into stars per galactic free fall time ) .",
    "since the volumetric gas and star formation rate densities are not easily observable , this inefficiency is observationally probed through the kennicutt - schmidt  ( ks ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) relation .",
    "the ks relation considers the current star formation rate surface density as a function of the available fuel for star formation measured through the total ( or molecular ) gas surface density .",
    "although there is still debate about the detailed slope and normalization of the ks relation , it is generally agreed that ",
    "when measured / averaged over large areas within galaxies  only a few percent of gas is able to be converted into stars per free fall time  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "understanding and explaining this inefficiency forms a central component of star formation and galaxy formation research .",
    "two main classes of models have been presented to explain the low efficiency of star formation and the form of the ks law . in one class",
    "it is argued that the small - scale properties of supersonic ism turbulence are able to disrupt cloud collapse , giving rise to low sfr efficiencies  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these models relate the low efficiency of star formation to the statistical properties of the density fluctuations in supersonic turbulence .",
    "however , since the rate - limiting step for gravitational collapse is the formation of dense gas clouds in the first place , this is an incomplete explanation of the galaxy - scale ks law .",
    "another approach has been to develop analytic global  equilibrium \" models that explain the low efficiency of star formation and form of the ks law  @xcite .",
    "the common component of the equilibrium models is that the interstellar medium ( ism ) remains in a quasi stable state by balancing feedback from young stellar populations with the global pressure of the self gravity of the disk  @xcite .",
    "while thermal pressure or radiation pressure contribute to the disk support , play a role in disrupting the giant molecular cloud ( gmc ) complexes where stars are formed  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and could be a source of turbulence , turbulent pressure is thought to provide the dominant source of support against the vertical collapse in gas - rich galaxies  @xcite , except possibly in the most optically thick inner parts  @xcite .",
    "equilibrium star formation models are able to derive star formation efficiencies by asserting that the turbulent energy injection rate from young stellar populations balances the turbulent energy dissipation rate .",
    "the derived star formation efficiencies scale with measurable properties of galactic disks and are consistent with observed star formation efficiencies  @xcite .",
    "these models implicitly assume that ( 1 ) gas in the local disk responds to feedback , ( 2 ) the strength of feedback scales with the star formation _ rate",
    "_ , and ( 3 ) the star formation rate  and therefore feedback  responds in turn to the gas properties .",
    "if feedback is  too strong , \" gas will be expelled or pushed out to such low densities that it can not form new stars , so the feedback  supply \" will cease .",
    "if feedback is  too weak , \" gas collapses rapidly and forms more stars , injecting more feedback until collapse is halted .",
    "this feedback cycle can only hold if the gas adjusts efficiently to the presence of feedback , _ and the feedback energy / momentum injection rate efficiently adjusts _ to changes in the gas density via the star formation rate . as long",
    "as the feedback is sufficiently strong and efficiently coupled to the gas , the gas will adjust to the presence of feedback .",
    "however , there are physical regimes where feedback evolves on timescales that are ( much ) longer than the local dynamical time . in these regimes",
    ", the feedback energy / momentum injection rate will not respond to changes in the gas density , potentially breaking the feedback loop invoked in these star formation models .    for stellar feedback , the primary sources of direct momentum and energy injection into the local environment are radiation pressure , stellar winds , photoionization , and supernovae  @xcite , and cosmic rays  ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "magnetic fields may also act to suppress star formation regulation mechanisms  @xcite .",
    "the relative importance of these mechanisms depends on the physical conditions of the gas .",
    "radiation pressure  @xcite and photoionization  @xcite are often identified as being responsible for disrupting the dense star forming gas , but supernovae probably dominate the turbulent momentum injection that balances the disk vertical collapse under most conditions  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : sb99 ] shows the direct momentum injection budget associated with a single age stellar population as a function of time since birth taken directly from starburst99  @xcite .",
    "radiation pressure dominates the early stellar feedback budget until the death of the most massive stars ( @xmath03 myr ) and drops to @xmath010% of its initial value by @xmath010 myr .",
    "supernovae dominate the direct momentum injection budget starting at @xmath03 myr and continue to dominate until the time after which the least massive stars that die in supernovae move off the main sequence ( @xmath040 myr ) assumed to be the lower mass limit for supernova progenitors . ] . from figure",
    "[ fig : sb99 ] , the total momentum injection rate remains nearly constant until @xmath03 myr , and remains variable but order - of - magnitude constant until @xmath040 myr .",
    "the constant early momentum injection rates allow us to define an interesting regime : regions of galaxies that possess dynamical times less than the timescale over which stellar feedback levels adjust . in these regimes",
    ", feedback can not efficiently adjust to changes in the gas distribution and/or the current star formation rate .",
    "in this paper we focus on the nuclear regions of galaxies where the small spatial scales and central black hole ensure consistently short dynamical times .    the understanding of star formation in galactic nuclei that we present in this paper",
    "will set the stage for follow up studies focused on the accretion , growth , and feedback associated with supermassive black holes .",
    "previous studies have considered the impact of stellar and black hole feedback in concert on the central @xmath0100 pc nuclear disk  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". however , those studies lacked the large - scale galactic disk that is important for understanding the long term behavior of supermassive black hole accretion and feedback .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows : in section  [ sec : aa ] we review the basic components of equilibrium feedback models .",
    "this allows us to concretely explore the assumptions that break down for the equilibrium model at short dynamical times .",
    "we propose alterations to the equilibrium feedback models that hold within short dynamical time regions and conclude that star formation within short dynamical time regions is likely to be inherently bursty . in section  [ sec : simulations ]",
    "we describe the numerical simulations that we use to explore the properties of nuclear star formation . in section  [ sec : results ] we present the results of our numerical simulations , with a focus on the bursty nature of nuclear star formation and implications for observations of the ks relation . in section  [ sec : discussion ]",
    "we present a discussion of our results with implications for observations of nuclear stellar disks as well as the observed ks relation . in section  [ sec : conclusions ] we summarize and conclude .",
    "analytic models have been developed to explain the efficiency of star formation and form of the ks law . in global equilibrium models",
    "the star formation efficiency is derived by asserting that turbulent energy injection from young stellar populations balances the turbulent energy dissipation rate .",
    "one of the first models to do this was  @xcite , where they examined radiation and mechanical feedback from young stellar populations with a focus on the central 100 pc of a starburst disk .",
    "we adopt a similar setup here , which includes an isothermal spherical potential  which could represent either a halo or bulge component .",
    "the projected surface density follows a power law @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the velocity dispersion of the potential .",
    "the mass profile is given by @xmath9 , with an angular frequency of @xmath10 set to enforce radial centrifugal balance .",
    "the specified gas fraction is @xmath11 .",
    "for such a model the disk mid plane pressure required to balance gravity can be approximated by @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the disk scale height and @xmath14 is the gas density .",
    "we then assume that supersonic turbulent pressure is the primary source of pressure support in the disk with turbulent gas velocity dispersion @xmath15 , in which case the rate of ( volumetric ) turbulent energy dissipation is @xmath16 under the assumption that the system approaches an equilibrium , this energy dissipation rate needs to be balanced by feedback from young stars .",
    "there are several possible ways to write down the feedback injection rate . here",
    ", we express the energy injection rate from young stars as @xmath17 the second equality follows from expressing the turbulent pressure produced by stellar feedback as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the radial momentum injected per unit stellar mass formed  @xcite and @xmath20 parameterizes the efficiency with which the radial momentum drives turbulent energy injection , but is of likely of order unity  @xcite .",
    "adopting the above expression of the young star pressure / turbulent energy injection rate does not require any assumptions about the origin of the momentum input , and can accommodate multiple momentum input sources ( e.g. , radiation pressure , supernovae , stellar winds , etc . ) . for sne , typical values for @xmath19",

    "this expression shows that the galactic star formation efficiency is directly related to the gas turbulent velocity dispersion in the disk .",
    "the equilibrium model as described above breaks down in two regimes .",
    "the equilibrium model breaks down when feedback is unable to modulate its strength on sufficiently short timescales ( i.e. the gas dynamical timescale ) .",

    "here , we are specifically concerned with the timescale over which radiation pressure and energy / momentum injection from supernovae decline as an initially young stellar population ages .",
    "radiation pressure begins to drop when a stellar population is just @xmath28 myr old while supernova inject significant momentum until @xmath29 myr ( figure  [ fig : sb99 ] ) .",
    "both of these feedback mechanisms have fallen to a small fraction ( @xmath30 ) of their initial value by the time a stellar population is @xmath31 myr old . in regimes where the dynamical time is much shorter than the stellar evolution time ( i.e. @xmath32 years ; see figure  [ fig : sb99 ] ) .",
    "] , feedback will not react sufficiently quickly to changes in the current gas density or star formation rate , but rather remain strong for a stellar evolution timescale .    for the one zone model used in this section , the dynamical time is @xmath33 comparing this with a stellar evolution timescale @xmath34 we find that the dynamical time will be much shorter than the stellar evolution time ( @xmath35 ) when @xmath36 when this condition is met , massive stars contributing significantly to sne and radiation pressure live longer than the gas dynamical time and thus feedback from young stars will persist for several dynamical times",
    ". for reasonable @xmath34 values ( e.g. @xmath37 myr ) the dynamical time can be much shorter than @xmath34 out to a significant fraction of the central @xmath38 kpc .",
    "if the feedback from young stars exceeds gravity within this region , then the system becomes unstable / unbound and remains in that state for several dynamical times until the young stars responsible for feedback move off the main sequence .    to explore this regime",
    ", we define the convenient quantity @xmath39 , which has units of acceleration .",
    "this quantity is plotted in figure 1 as a function of time .",

    "the total momentum injection per unit stellar mass ( @xmath19 , used in the previous subsection ) is related to @xmath43 via @xmath44 where the boost factor @xmath42 is folded into the total momentum injection . setting the turbulent pressure from young stars equal to the mid - plane pressure given by equation ( [ eqn : mid_plane_pressure ] )",
    ", we find the critical surface density of stars @xmath45 this result is similar to the argument in  @xcite and  @xcite for when individual star clusters disperse giant molecular clouds , but now we apply it to a galaxy nucleus which is allowed to have many _ independent _ self - gravitating clouds .",
    "we briefly note that the same critical condition can be derived by considering the energy  rather than pressure  balance .",

    "we can write down the critical young stellar fraction or critical young star surface density in terms of the total surface density @xmath48 if we assume a boost factor of @xmath49 and @xmath50 this reduces to @xmath51 if this critical surface density of young stars is exactly maintained , feedback driven turbulence and disk self - gravity will be in equilibrium .",
    "however , it follows that overshooting this critical young stellar surface density will lead to outflows , which will lower the system s gas fraction , and lead to a runaway outflow condition _ that will persist for several local dynamical times_. for this reason , we argue that the critical surface density of young stars is an unstable critical point which will likely lead to a full shut down of star formation with the system going into an outflow state for a stellar evolution feedback timescale .    after the young stellar populations have aged and their feedback levels have been reduced , gas will return to the nuclear region .",

    "this can repopulate the central gas reservoir within a few dynamical times , which will allow for a repetition of the central gas blowout cycle .",
    "this result stands in contrast to the  self - regulating \" feedback balance that applies to most of the disk .",
    "the key difference is whether or not feedback driven turbulent pressure adjusts rapidly or slowly compared to the local dynamical time .",
    "typical galactic dynamical times at @xmath0kpc distances are of order @xmath31myrs ( i.e. longer than the timescale over which stellar feedback evolves ) .",
    "upward perturbations to the sfr do not lead to blow - out under normal ` equilibrium ' conditions because stars die on timescales much shorter than the local dynamical time .",
    "where this is the case , there is not enough time for minor sfr perturbations to affect the galaxy dynamics .      expressing the critical young star surface density as a fraction of the gas mass yields @xmath55 an interesting limit",
    "is found by considering when the fraction of gas that must be turned into stars in order to achieve feedback balance is of order unity ( i.e. @xmath56 ) .",
    "this limit occurs for @xmath57 for @xmath49 and @xmath58 . at this gas surface density",
    ", feedback can efficiently oppose gas collapse only by converting an order unity fraction of the gas mass into stars .",

    "the rapid mixing of the young stellar populations drives the whole central region to react homogeneously to the presence of strong feedback . despite the presence of multiple self - bound star forming clumps , the feedback response of the gas in the whole nuclear region acts like that of a single molecular cloud : stars form until a critical surface density of young stars is present ( such that feedback overwhelms gravity ) at which point they begin to expel gas from the nuclei .",

    "is characterized by an oscillatory gas mass , star formation rate , and young stellar mass within the nuclear region .",
    "the behavior of each of these components is offset in time but closely related .",

    "star formation then proceeds efficiently until stellar feedback is sufficiently strong as defined by equation  [ eqn : newfeedbackequilibrium ] to balance gas collapse .",
    "once feedback is sufficiently strong , the gas supply is rapidly expelled ( characterized by very sharp drops in the central gas content for any of the disks ) .",
    "the young stars that are responsible for the strong feedback continue to inject strong feedback into the nuclear region for @xmath030 - 40 myr causing the gas recovery in this region to be relatively slow .",
    "the episodic sharp drops in the central gas content are correlated with the periods of peak young stellar mass .",
    "the timescale for this behavior is of order @xmath0100 myr  though the detailed duty cycle for this process is not very regular , and is different for our three disk models .",
    "the time evolution shown in figure  [ fig : gas_nuclear_evolution ] can be compared back against the central gas surface density plots shown in figure  [ fig : gas_surface_density_2 ] .",

    "the behavior of the same quantities averaged on larger spatial scales becomes significantly more stable .",
    "examining figure  [ fig : gas_nuclear_evolution2 ] we find that averaged over the central 1 kpc , the mass of gas and young stars in the central regions shows no clear oscillatory behavior .",
    "the instantaneous star formation rate ( not shown ) shows significant variability , which becomes nearly smooth when averaged over 10 myr periods ( the plotted curves ) .",
    "the increased stability on 1 kpc scales is consistent with the analytic arguments outlined in section  [ sec : aa ] .",
    "although feedback operates to disrupt gas clouds locally feedback failed to collectively clear material from the region .",
    "the rate of gas consumption via star formation and gas expulsion via feedback are well balanced with the rate of gas return from aging stellar populations and influx from larger radii producing stable gas mass evolution .",
    "in section  [ sec : aa ] we derived the surface density of young stars that were required to drive the outflows .",
    "the surface density of young stars normalized by the critical surface density that is expressed in equation  [ eqn : newfeedbackequilibrium ] is plotted as a function of time in the bottom panels of figures  [ fig : gas_nuclear_evolution ] and  [ fig : gas_nuclear_evolution2 ] for our three disks as evaluated within the central 100 pc and 1 kpc , respectively .",
    "periods of time with @xmath83 indicate that the system has low levels of feedback compared to what is required for gas blowout and is therefore stable / collapsing while periods of time with @xmath84 indicate that the system is feedback dominated and is likely driving outflows .",
    "the central portion of each galaxy spends the majority of its time in a stable / collapsing state , bookended with brief periods of strong feedback .",
    "we can compare the periods of time with high @xmath85 values with the time evolution of the quantities presented in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : gas_nuclear_evolution ] .",
    "when @xmath85 exceeds unity , there is a strong correspondence to a rapid drop in the central gas content of the system .",
    "contrasting the panels within figure  [ fig : gas_nuclear_evolution ] reveals that the @xmath85 values rise much more sharply than the young stellar mass .",
    "the driving force behind this feature is that while the mass of young stars is initially responsible for pushing @xmath85 above unity , once this is achieved the rapid outflow of gas mass from the central region drives up the derived turbulent velocity and drives down the orbital frequency and gas mass . the combination of these three effects results in the very sharp rise of the @xmath85 values .",
    "very large @xmath85 values are not long lived because ( i ) the gas fraction drops , ( ii ) new star formation ceases , and soon after ( iii ) the mass of young stellar mass decreases ( owing to aging ) .",
    "further insight into the dynamic behavior of the central gas reservoir can be obtained from figure  [ fig : toomre_q ] which shows the q parameter as a function of time for several disk radii .",
    "the q value is evaluated via @xmath86 using the @xmath87 component of the mass weighted gas velocity dispersion as a proxy for the turbulent velocity dispersion .",
    "we adopt the vertical , mass weighted , velocity dispersion because the radial and azimuthal velocity dispersions are more subject to influence by the coherent , non - circular motion of dense clouds in the disk plane .",
    "moreover , the mass ( rather than volume ) weighted velocity dispersion is both more important for the disk dynamics , and less subject to influence from rapidly outflowing material .",
    "the q value hovers around unity consistently with time at large radii , indicating steady - state self - regulation .",
    "the smaller radii bins have episodic and strong increases in the toomre q value , indicative of local outflows .",
    "the inner regions of the simulated disks experience brief periods of large gas velocity dispersions coincident with the presence of locally - driven outflows . between these periods , the gas velocity dispersions are of order 30 - 50 km / sec . more specifically , the d1 , d2 , and d3 disks have median vertical gas velocity dispersions of in the central 1 kpc of @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 km / s , respectively .",
    "this is consistent with the prediction that @xmath91 for @xmath92  ( our @xmath15 is slightly higher owing to the multi - component disk and order unity corrections calculated in * ? ? ?",
    "the gas velocity dispersion measured on smaller scales is similar in magnitude ( i.e. 30 - 50 km / sec ) , but with significantly more variability  particularly around burst episodes .",
    "equilibrium analytic models have been used to explore the low efficiency of star formation that is observed in the ks relation  @xcite .",
    "their breakdown may therefore have implications for the ks relation in those regions . in figure",
    "[ fig : ks_relation1 ] we consider the @xmath93-@xmath94 ks relation for material within the central r=@xmath95 pc ( left ) and r=@xmath38 kpc ( right ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : ks_relation1.5 ] shows the @xmath93-@xmath96 relation ",
    "again for material within the central r=@xmath95 pc ( left ) and r=@xmath38 kpc ( right ) .. we calculate the dynamical time based on the local potential . ]",
    "star formation rate surface densities are calculated based on the mass of stars less than 10 myr old  consistent with the definition of sfr used throughout the rest of this paper .",
    "the ks relation averaged over the central @xmath01 kpc is reasonably tight and consistent with the ks relations derived from observations by  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "the slope of the ks relation predicted by our simulations is roughly n@xmath02 ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "this slope is steeper than slopes n@xmath01 - 1.5 often derived from observations assuming a constant @xmath98 conversion factor  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) but is consistent with analytic equilibrium models  @xcite , and with an interpretation of observations assuming an @xmath98 factor varying continuously with @xmath99 @xcite . this has been shown already for our adopted ism / star - formation / feedback model  @xcite .",
    "the sf efficiency for all three disks hovers around 5% star formation efficiency per dynamical time .",
    "the smaller aperture ks relations have significantly more scatter than their larger aperture counterparts .",
    "the dense cloud of points sitting around @xmath100 falls somewhat above the observed ks relation .",
    "this is owing to the @xmath101 local sf efficiency per free fall time ( at the star formation density threshold ) that is used in our simulations .",
    "once stars are formed in this cloud , they immediately start acting to clear the nuclear region of gas .",
    "since the sfrs plotted in figures  [ fig : ks_relation1 ] and  [ fig : ks_relation1.5 ] are derived from the mass of young stars we find a cloud of points that extends toward significantly lower gas surface densities .",
    "this is a result of measuring the sfr from the mass of young stars that have both formed recently and begun to clear their birth cloud gas , and comparing it against the current gas mass .",
    "reexamination of figure  [ fig : young_star_dist ] confirms how this process takes place in our simulations .",
    "we have examined the stability of self - regulated star formation in galactic nuclei .",
    "star formation in regions of galaxies with short dynamical times ( shorter than the stellar evolution timescale ) can not reach a truly equilibrium state , but instead undergo  burst quench \" cycles .",
    "we presented an analytically motivated model where gas flows into the nuclear region and begins forming stars until enough young stellar mass is present to overwhelm the self gravity of the gas leading to a localized blowout of the gas .",
    "this is similar to the behavior of a single gmc  ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) within which the local dynamical time can also become short .",
    "the key difference between the nuclear region and a typical gmc is that this behavior is driven by the collectively short dynamical time of the disk , rather than the local potential of the star forming gas cloud .",
    "star formation in the nuclear region can occur in several dense star - forming regions ( see , e.g. , figure  [ fig : young_star_dist ] ) .",
    "however , for feedback purposes , massive young stars quickly separate from their birth clouds and the _ entire _ nuclear region therefore acts as a single short dynamical time region .",
    "observed nuclear stellar disks show indications of oscillatory star formation and feedback cycles .",
    "@xcite found that a sample of seyfert galaxies contained nuclear star clusters with spatial extent @xmath73 50 pc .",
    "interestingly , although these nuclear star clusters could be identified to have characteristic ages of @xmath010 - 300 myr , there was little or no evidence of ongoing star formation in these same systems ( as inferred through low values for the equivalent widths of br@xmath102 emission ) .",
    "we caution , however , that the modest gas surface densities ( @xmath103/pc@xmath104 ) explored in this paper are not directly comparable to the population ( @xmath105/pc@xmath104 ) studied in  @xcite .",
    "if there is a link between aging stellar populations and the fueling of agn activity , as has been implied from the time offset between nuclear star formation and seyfert activity , then the bursty nature of star formation found in our model would have implications for agn fueling .",
    "our models included a central supermassive black hole  which is dynamically important for the innermost galactic regions studied in this paper  as well as stellar mass loss .",
    "however , we elected to not include black hole growth and associated black hole feedback in the present study as both processes add significant complicating factors to the interpretation of the results . in the future , we intend to run additional simulations that consider the relationship between nuclear star formation and agn activity  ( for preliminary results on black hole growth and feedback in simulations focusing on the inner @xmath0100 pc regions of gas - rich galaxies , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    a particularly interesting application of full galaxy simulations that will include both explicit feedback from stars and from massive black holes in a resolved ism will be to study the generation and effects of galaxy - scale outflows driven by luminous agn . such outflows",
    "have now been detected in luminous quasars over a wide range of redshift and in both atomic and molecular gas  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these appear energetic enough to potentially strongly affect galaxy scale star formation .",
    "while idealized analytic and numerical calculations  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have begun to address the physics of such outflows , fully dynamical simulations of galaxies including both stellar and black hole feedback will likely be needed to robustly predicted how agn - driven galactic winds are mass loaded and how they affect the host galaxy .",
    "we have studied the impact of feedback from young stars on the star formation rates and gas content of galactic nuclei .",
    "we outlined basic analytic arguments that modify existing feedback equilibrium star formation models  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to apply to short dynamical time regions .",
    "we ran and explored numerical simulations that included realistic , time resolved stellar feedback prescriptions to directly model the evolution of several galaxy models .",
    "our primary conclusions are as follows :    * the nuclear regions ( @xmath106 pc ) of galaxies are characterized by dynamical times of order @xmath01 myr .",
    "feedback from young stars evolves over timescales of tens of myr ( figure  [ fig : sb99 ] ) .",
    "this timescale mismatch means that feedback from young stars is not immediately responsive to changes in the gas state , and thus there is no _ stable equilibrium star formation rate_. * instead , gas will continue to form stars until a critical mass of young stars is formed ( eqn .",
    "[ eqn : newfeedbackequilibrium ] ) , at which point the feedback from young stars leads to an unstable blowout from the nucleus . after the blowout new",
    "gas flows into the nucleus from larger radii ( figure  [ fig : gas_surface_density_2 ] ) . as a consequence , the gas content , star formation rate , and mass of young stars all",
    "oscillate in time when measured over @xmath69 pc scales ; they are significantly more stable when measured over larger @xmath107 kpc scales ( figures  [ fig : gas_nuclear_evolution ] and  [ fig : gas_nuclear_evolution2 ] ) . *",
    "the simulated ks relation shows very different properties on @xmath95 pc and @xmath38 kpc scales ( see figure  [ fig : ks_relation1 ] ) .",
    "the long dynamical time on large scales means the system can reach equilibrium .",
    "this leads to a more stable star formation rate and gas content with time  hence a tighter ks relation . in the galactic nucleus , by contrast , the ks relation is much more variable and has larger scatter .    in the present study",
    "the dynamical effect of the central supermassive black hole was included but agn feedback was not . in this paper",
    "we have shown that stellar feedback _ alone _ is capable of driving episodic star formation and outflows from galactic nuclei .",
    "however , considering both stellar and agn feedback in concert will be important for understanding the relative importance of different feedback channels on galactic nuclei .",
