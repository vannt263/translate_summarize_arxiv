    "the formation of galactic disks is a long - standing problem in galaxy formation . in numerical simulations ,",
    "disks form through gas dissipation @xcite , and the formation of the outer regions of the disk happens on longer time scales than the inner disk @xcite .",
    "the disks that form have exponential density profiles @xcite , possibly due to the detailed conservation of angular momentum of an initially spherical cloud in solid - body rotation @xcite . yet",
    ", direct observational evidence for this picture is scant ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and forming realistic disks within the @xmath7cdm paradigm remains challenging ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "central to the question as to how galactic disks form and evolve is the existence of `` thick '' disk components .",
    "first discovered in external galaxies @xcite , thick - disk components represent excess light or stars beyond the canonical thin disk s exponential vertical profile . the milky way s thick - disk component @xcite provides us with a detailed look at this common galactic component .",
    "generally , thick - disk components are found to be old @xcite , kinematically hot @xcite , and metal - poor ( compared to the thin - disk components ) , as well as enhanced in @xmath4-elements @xcite . density decompositions of the stellar disk into thinner and thicker components of external galaxies and the milky way have found that thicker - disk components have larger scale heights and longer scale lengths than their corresponding thin disk @xcite",
    ". however , these decompositions are purely geometric , and do not take kinematics or abundance information into account when assigning thinner- or thicker - disk membership .",
    "a number of qualitatively very different models have been proposed for the formation of thick - disk components .",
    "external mechanisms , such as the direct accretion of stars from a disrupted satellite galaxy @xcite or the heating of a pre - existing thin disk through a minor merger @xcite , can explain many of the observed properties of thick - disk components .",
    "thick - disk components can also be formed internally through star formation following a gas - rich merger ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) or by quiescent internal dynamical evolution @xcite .",
    "the idea that the thick - disk component could arise in good part through internal evolution is an intriguing possibility , as it explains a range of other observations .",
    "significant redistribution of angular momentum without radially heating the disk ( `` radial migration '' ) happens naturally if spiral structure is transient @xcite , and has also been shown to occur through bar  spiral structure interactions @xcite .",
    "it can also be induced by an orbiting satellite @xcite .",
    "the transient nature of spiral structure is favored both theoretically ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and observationally from surveys of the solar neighborhood ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and of external galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "radial migration naturally explains the flatness and spread in the age - metallicity relation in the solar neighborhood , as the large - scale changes in the guiding radii of stars tend to flatten radial - abundance gradients .",
    "a thicker - disk component arises through radial migration when stars from the inner galaxy migrate outward , where the gravitational attraction toward the mid - plane is smaller , such that they reach larger heights above the plane .",
    "however , to date , radial - migration models have essentially only been confronted with data at the solar radius , and observational tests to discriminate formation scenarios for thicker - disk components have not been conclusive ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "because radial migration is effectively a diffusion process , it complicates , if not erases , the link between the present - day chemo - orbital distribution and the orbital characteristics and abundance distribution at the time of a given stars birth . without detailed modeling of the episodes of transient spiral structure ( or the equivalent in other radial - migration scenarios ) ,",
    "reconstructing the radial and azimuthal actions is problematic as well .",
    "however , the vertical action is an adiabatic invariant during the slow change in the vertical potential that ensues from this migration .",
    "the overall ( mass - weighted ) radial structure of the disk is left relatively unchanged as radial migration proceeds @xcite  essentially because any redistribution of the surface - mass density would provide energy to heat the disk , and to avoid this heating the overall surface - mass density profile needs to be conserved ",
    "but if different ( age- or abundance- ) components of the disk have a different initial structure , radial migration will work to bring the spatial distribution of different populations closer to the mean .    in this paper",
    "we implement for the first time an alternative approach to globally ` dissecting ' the milky way s stellar disk : we study the overall ( vertical and radial ) spatial structure of large samples of stars selected to be sub - populations in the elemental - abundance space spanned by metallicity [ fe / h ] and @xmath4-abundance @xmath0$]/fe ] ratio in this paper is an average of the [ mg / fe ] , [ si / fe ] , [ ca / fe ] , and [ ti / fe ] ratios @xcite . ] , as it is becoming increasingly clear that a characterization of the thicker disk components based only on stellar abundances is superior to kinematic definitions @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 $ ]  ratio in particular is a crucial parameter , as it can be used as a relative age indicator @xcite . at early times",
    ", the low - metallicity interstellar medium is enriched by type ii supernovae ( sneii ) .",
    "after about 2 to 3 gyr , type ia sne occur ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the stellar yields shift toward fe , leading to a decreasing @xmath0 $ ]  with increasing age .",
    "therefore , populations of stars with enhanced @xmath0$]ratios are chemically older than those with @xmath0 $ ]  closer to the solar ratio . by using the _ sdss_/_segue _",
    "g - dwarf sample , we observe stars globally across the milky way , constraining their vertical distributions from 300 pc to 4 kpc from the mid - plane , and their radial densities from galactocentric radii ranging from 5 to 12 kpc . we show that the scale length of the @xmath4-enhanced  and thus probably oldest  population is much shorter than that of the chemically more - evolved stars with solar @xmath0 $ ] .",
    "this is opposite to previous disk decompositions into thicker and thinner components that make use of geometric information alone ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and see above ) . also , we do not detect any discontinuity in the vertical scale height as a function of @xmath0 $ ]  that might be expected if the thick - disk component was formed through a singular external or internal event , but instead observe a continuous increase in scale - height with @xmath0 $ ] .",
    "this casts doubt on how sensible or useful it is to think of distinct thin- and thick - disk components in the milky way .",

    "we go through a number of practical issues pertaining to these estimates , before discussing possible implications for galactic disk formation and evolution .",
    "the absolute values of the distance scales measured in this paper are subject to distance systematics , which we discuss in this subsection .",
    "we have used the data - driven photometric - distance relation from @xcite to infer the spatial structure of the various samples of stars , but an alternative photometric - distance relation can be obtained by using the @xcite stellar isochrones in the _ sdss _  passbands .",
    "these isochrones depend on @xmath1 $ ]  as well as on @xmath0 $ ] , although in practice a linear relation between @xmath0 $ ]  and @xmath1 $ ]  is assumed , and the spectroscopically measured @xmath0 $ ]  is not used directly to estimate the photometric distance . in the top panel of  [ fig : dm_anjuric_ivezic ] we compared the distance moduli derived using the @xcite stellar isochrones with those obtained using the @xcite relation for a few values of @xmath1 $ ] .",
    "we see that , for the values of @xmath1 $ ]  that span most of our sample , the distance modulus difference is -0.12 mag , corresponding to a systematic difference in the inferred distances of about 6percent , nearly independent of color .",
    "thus , if we had used the @xcite photometric distances we would have obtained scale lengths and scale heights that were 6percent shorter .    a second distance systematic that could influence our results is the malmquist bias @xcite  the fact that brighter stars are over - represented in a magnitude - limited survey .",
    "for our relatively bright sample , this is dominated by the finite width of the photometric distance relation .",
    "the malmquist bias in absolute magnitude is apparent - magnitude dependent and approximately equal to @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the differential number count as a function of apparent magnitude and @xmath88 is the dispersion in the absolute magnitudes ( either due to photometric uncertainties or due to intrinsic scatter in the photometric distance relation ) . conservatively assuming that the combination of the finite width of the photometric distance relation and the photometric uncertainties is 0.2 mag , and that the underlying density is constant",
    ", the malmquist bias would be of order 2.5percent .",
    "however , due to the exponential fall - off of the density in both the @xmath76 and @xmath62 directions , the differential number counts are ( a ) flat near the peak induced by the vertical exponential , and ( b ) for most apparent magnitudes @xmath89 is less than 1 . therefore , the malmquist bias is at most about 2percent , and will not strongly affect the measurement of the vertical scale height in particular .",
    "we have assumed throughout our analysis that all of the stars in our sample are single .",
    "the presence of unresolved binaries will lead us to underestimate scales , as these binaries will appear to us as brighter , and thus closer , single stars .",
    "the binary fraction and companion - mass distribution for g - type dwarfs remains controversial , but it appears that the overall binary fraction for g dwarfs is approximately 40percent @xcite , similar to but slightly larger than that of m dwarfs @xcite . the distribution of companion masses is poorly known , and could range from being peaked around 20percent of the primary s mass @xcite , to being relatively flat between 20 and 100percent of the primary s mass @xcite , with numerical simulations indicating that multiple - star systems form preferentially with approximately equal - mass members @xcite , and an overall multiplicity fraction of around 40percent @xcite .",
    "lower - metallicity stars most likely have a higher binary fraction @xcite , and could reach 100percent for @xmath1 $ ]  @xmath90 @xcite .",
    "for a likely scenario where 40percent of our @xmath4-young  sample is made up of binary stars ( ignoring higher - order multiplicities ) with a flat distribution of companion masses between 20 and 100percent of the primary s mass , the magnitude would be overestimated on average by 0.12 mag , such that the scale height and scale length would be underestimated by about 6percent .",
    "if 70percent of the @xmath4-oldsample would consist of binary systems ( taking into account the rising binary fraction with decreasing metallicity ) , the magnitudes would be overestimated by approximately 0.21 mag , and the @xmath4-old  scale heights and scale lengths would be underestimated by 10percent .",
    "these biases are somewhat larger than the statistical uncertainties on our results , but they are similar to the overall distance - scale uncertainty ( see above ) , and they do not change the conclusion that the @xmath4-old  scale length is much shorter than that of the @xmath4-young  sample . even in a worst - case scenario , where all binary systems have equal - mass companions and where 100percent of the @xmath4-old  stars are in binaries , the @xmath4-old  scale - length would still be @xmath91 kpc ( 40percent up from 2 kpc ) , which is shorter than the scale length measured for the @xmath4-young  sample in  [ table : rich_results ] and  [ fig : pixelfit_g_alt ] , and the @xmath4-young  scale lengths themselves would also increase by about 15percent in this scenario . in principle , a careful spectral analysis of the _ segue_spectra itself could provide direct constraints on the ( unresolved ) binary contamination in this sample .      in our density",
    "fits we have mostly fit disk components to the data , except for the single exponential disk model where we added a uniform density ( equation  ( [ eq : densmodel ] ) ) .",
    "we thus assumed that the stellar halo does not influence our disk fits , beyond what can be described by a uniform density across our survey volume .",
    "we can estimate the expected number of halo stars in our sample using the @xcite density fits to the smooth stellar halo .",
    "we run the @xcite stellar - halo density through the g - star _",
    "segue_selection function , and marginalize over @xmath21 color using a flat distribution over @xmath92 , and over @xmath1 $ ]  using the @xcite halo metallicity distribution ( mean @xmath1 $ ]  = -1.52 , width = 0.32 ) .",
    "we then find that for @xmath93 g - type stars between 1 and 40 galactocentric kpc in the stellar halo , there should be about 100 halo stars in our sample , compared to the total sample size of 30,353 g - type dwarfs .",
    "hence , the halo contamination is very small and does not influence the fits .",
    "additionally , halo contamination will be most severe for the @xmath4-old  sub - populations , and this contamination should work to _ increase _ the inferred scales ( length and height ) .",
    "therefore , the result that the radial scale length of @xmath4-old  sub - populations is shorter than that of @xmath4-young  sub - populations is robust against any halo contamination .",
    "the density fits in this paper are the first to constrain the vertical scale height and radial scale length of numerous disk sub - components , defined using elemental abundances alone , from a large sample of stars .",
    "our results show that the vertically thicker disk sub - components  when chemically defined  have a much shorter scale length than the thinner - disk sub - components , which is opposite to traditional purely geometric disk decompositions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which typically find that the thick - disk component has a _ longer _ scale length than the thin disk , and that this scale length is @xmath94 kpc ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "when we fit the spatial structure in our approach , taking stars of all metallicities ( specifically , the combination of our @xmath4-old(``thick '' ) and @xmath4-young  ( `` thin '' ) samples ) , we can recover the result of purely geometric decompositions : the thin - disk component  i.e .",
    ", the component with the lowest scale height , @xmath5 300 pc  gets paired with the shortest scale length ( @xmath5 2 kpc ) , while the thicker - disk component gets assigned both the largest scale height and scale length ( for our particular sample fit with a combination of three double - exponential disks these are @xmath5 600 pc and @xmath5 2.4 kpc , with a small component with an even larger scale height and scale length ) .",
    "thus , it seems that purely geometric decompositions naturally associate the longest scale length with the largest scale height . that _ both _ geometrically determined scale lengths are shorter than the scale length of the @xmath4-young  sample is due to the fact that the metallicity distribution for the entire sample extends down to @xmath1 $ ]  = -1.5 , such that the model ` expects ' many low - metallicity stars in the `` thin '' component at large distances ( as the model does not contain the information that the thin component has higher metallicities ) , which are not observed . therefore , metallicity and @xmath4-element abundances , which are manifestly quantities that can identify sub - samples of stars independent of their spatial structure and kinematics , lead to a qualitatively different decomposition into two ( or more ) sub - components than the purely geometrical approach , with its inherent risk of circular reasoning .",
    "the distinctive changes of the global disk structure with abundance , especially with the age proxy @xmath0 $ ] , should provide valuable clues to the formation of the milky way s disk . while a concrete and quantitative model comparison is beyond the scope of this paper , we discuss some of the qualitative implications here . as mentioned in section 1 , the overall radial - density profile of the stellar disk",
    "is expected to be conserved even in the face of large - scale radial migration , but the radial profile of sub - components will tend to relax to the mass - weighted mean radial profile .",
    "thus , a difference in the radial distribution of various populations of stars today is a less - pronounced version of more different initial radial distributions ( at formation ) . assuming that the @xmath0 $ ]  ratio is an adequate proxy for age ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , our results then imply that the @xmath4-enhanced , hence oldest , populations are more centrally concentrated  have a shorter scale length  than populations with @xmath4-abundances that are closer to solar , and therefore younger .",
    "this is direct observational evidence for inside - out formation of galactic disks across the presumed age range of our sample , 1  10 gyr , where the inner parts of the disk form before the outer part of the disk .",
    "a similar age - dependence of the exponential scale length has been found in several external galaxies @xcite .",
    "second , our analysis shows that our milky way has not only a metallicity gradient among its youngest stars , but that it has always had one @xcite : at a given @xmath0 $ ] , standing in for age , sub - populations with lower @xmath1 $ ]  have a longer scale length than more metal - rich stars .",
    "this picture is confirmed by looking at the orbital properties of the stars when integrating our sample of g - type dwarfs in a simple model for the milky way s potential , made up of a miyamoto - nagai disk with a radial scale of 4 kpc and vertical scale of 300 pc contributing 60percent of the radial force at the solar radius , a hernquist bulge with a scale radius of 600 pc contributing 5percent of the radial force , and a navarro - frenk - white halo with a scale radius of 36 kpc that contributes 35percent of the rotational support at the sun s position .",
    "the median of the mean orbital radii as a function of elemental abundance is shown in  [ fig : gorbits ] ( see also @xcite and liu & van de ven , 2011 , in prep .",
    "for similar figures of the eccentricity and rotational velocity ) .",
    "we see that stars with @xmath0 $ ]  @xmath81 and lower @xmath1 $ ]  are thin - disk stars that live , on average , farther out than more metal - rich stars .",
    "thus , the longer scale length for outer - disk stars , combined with the fact that , for solar @xmath0 $ ] decreasing @xmath1 $ ]  is correlated with decreasing age ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , implies that the outer part of the disk formed later than the inner part .",
    "we have assumed that @xmath0 $ ]  is an adequate proxy for age , such that the mono - abundance populations that are more @xmath0$]-enhanced are older than the populations with solar @xmath0 $ ] .",
    "this is typically the case in standard scenarios for the star formation history of the milky way disk , in which @xmath0 $ ]  steeply drops around 2 to 3 gyr due to the onset of type ia supernovae @xcite , and then stays roughly constant , although the value of @xmath1 $ ]  at which the @xmath0$]downturn happens depends on the star formation history @xcite .",

    "the spatial structure inferred for mono - abundance sub - populations ( s  [ fig : pixelfit_g ] and [ fig : pixelfit_g_alt ] ) show two important results : first , there is a tight anti - correlation between the scale heights and scale lengths of the sub - components .",
    "secondly , there is a continuous distribution in scale height when moving from @xmath4-enhanced , metal - poor populations to stars with solar @xmath0 $ ]  and @xmath1 $ ] .",
    "this suggests that the @xmath4-old``thick''and the @xmath4-younger , `` thin '' , regime of the stellar disk are not two separate entities , but merely opposite ends of the disk evolution spectrum ( suggested before in * ? ? ?",
    "* but never directly measured as we do here ) .",
    "this issue , which requires proper stellar - mass weighting of the sub - components , is worked out in a separate paper @xcite . taken together ,",
    "these findings suggest a continuous evolutionary mechanism created the observed scale - height distribution , rather than a discrete external heating or accretion event . radial migration is an obvious candidate for this internal evolution mechanism .",
    "that the most centrally concentrated component of the disk is not only the ( @xmath4-)oldest part , but also has the largest scale height , is a nearly inevitable condition , and hence a natural prediction , of any scenario where much of the disk scale - height distribution is created through radial migration .",
    "the @xmath4-old sub - population not only had the most time to evolve , but its centrally concentrated parent population implies that stars at @xmath95 kpc have migrated out by the largest factor .",
    "a different internal explanation for the thicker disk components in the milky way is that , rather than being thickened over the history of the galactic disk , thick components were created thick during an early , turbulent phase in the formation of the disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if such a scenario is combined with a inside - out growth of the disk , and the disk remains turbulent over a significant fraction of its history , this formation scenario could plausibly explain the continuous dependence of disk structure on elemental abundance found in this paper .",
    "our result that the transition between the @xmath4-young , `` thin '' , components and the @xmath4-old , `` thick '' , components is smooth , rather than showing a clear separation between thin and thick components , may appear to be in conflict with local , high - resolution spectroscopic samples of stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or other analyses of the _ segue _  data ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "a detailed comparison between these and our results requires careful accounting for the spectroscopic volume sampling , which has not been done in the @xcite analysis or for the high - resolution samples , except for the sample of @xcite , which is volume complete out to 25 pc . without taking the volume selection into account",
    ", the sample used here also displays a bi - modality in the @xmath1$]@xmath0 $ ]  plane ( see  [ fig : afeh_g ] ) .",
    "we discuss this issue in more detail in @xcite , but we note here that the apparent bi - modality in the observed number density of stars disappears when properly correcting for the spectroscopic sampling . furthermore ,",
    "the local , high - resolution analyses can not directly measure the spatial distribution of stars of different elemental abundances ( e.g. , @xcite , which only has 15 high-@xmath0 $ ]  stars out to 25 pc ; @xcite ) and therefore rely on kinematics to argue that the vertical distribution of stars in the solar neighborhood is characterized by a bi - modal `` thin''``thick''-disk dichotomy .",
    "this interpretation is driven by the selection of stars that are disjoint in @xmath0 $ ] , which leads to disjoint kinematics because the kinematics is a strong  and smooth  function of abundance as well @xcite . while the stellar content of different survey volumes can ( and should ) be connected by dynamics , we note that the effective volumes sampled by , e.g. , the @xcite survey and by our analysis differ by a factor of about @xmath96 ; hence the extrapolation from one to the other is enormous .",
    "the analysis of the vertical kinematics of stars in our sample confirms the existence of the intermediate populations with scale heights between 400 and 600 pc and vertical - velocity dispersions of 30 to 35 km s@xmath97 @xcite .",
    "our finding that the scale length does not behave as smoothly as the scale height , as a function of @xmath0 $ ] , is presumably a consequence of the disk s formation history : here the increasing metallicity as a function of time ( i.e. , youth ) and the radial metallicity gradient compete . as the mapping between",
    "@xmath0 $ ]  and age is not linear , but rather , @xmath0 $ ]  steeply drops around 2 to 3 gyr due to the onset of type ia supernovae @xcite , and then stays roughly constant , the scale length should change similarly rapidly with @xmath0 $ ] .",
    "the scale height , however , is determined by subsequent evolution , where radial migration transports stars to larger galactocentric radii , where the lower disk density allows them to travel farther from the plane . since this evolution is continuous , rather than sudden , and includes additional contributions from heating , trends in scale height versus elemental abundance should be expected to be smoother , even if radial migration is not the disk s dominant evolutionary mode .",
    "our results are therefore consistent with a scenario where the thick - disk component is the inner part of the disk that formed at the earliest time , and either by having formed thick or through the effect of radial migration , has a large scale height at the present time .",
    "a gas - rich merger , followed by intense star formation at an early time , could have affected the formation of the early disk @xcite , as seems consistent with the observed distribution of eccentricities of the thick - disk component @xcite .",
    "however , it would lead to a scale length for the thicker component that is larger than that of the thinner component @xcite .",
    "it is clear that internal mechanisms must have played an important role during the evolution of the disk .",
    "however , we caution that the radial and vertical consequences of neither radial migration , nor turbulent disk evolution , nor of satellite thickening , have been worked out in quantitative detail , and , in particular , resonant coupling between satellites and the disk might induce some similar observational signatures to radial migration .",
    "the rapid change in the mean stellar population in an @xmath0$] @xmath1$]abundance bin at the onset of type ia supernovae is also likely the explanation for the presence of the few points of intermediate @xmath0$]and @xmath1 $ ]  in  [ fig : pixelfit_g_alt ] that do not follow the anti - correlation between scale height and scale length ; these bins , which do not contribute significantly to the total stellar mass ( indicated by the size of the symbols in  [ fig : pixelfit_g_alt ] ) , are also the bins that fall short of the one - to - one correlation between single- and two - disk fits in  [ fig : one_vs_two ] .",
    "this provides further evidence of the fact that at the rapid @xmath0 $ ]  ( age ) transition our bins do not adequately resolve single components .",
    "the main conclusions of this paper are as follows    @xmath98 an assessment of the global ( @xmath27 ) structure of the milky way s stellar disk for sub - components selected solely by their elemental abundances is now feasible , e.g. , with spectroscopic surveys such as _ segue _ , but requires a thorough accounting for the effective selection function of the spectroscopic sample .",

    "@xmath98 these observations show quite directly that the bulk of the galactic disk has formed from the inside out .",

    "we then run the same analysis code on this sample as is run to produce the real data results in s  [ fig : pixelfit_g ] to s  [ fig : one_vs_two ] .",
    "we find results that are consistent with the input model within the uncertainties for each bin .",

    "we repeat this for an input `` thick '' disk model with @xmath149 pc and @xmath150 kpc , and again find results that are consistent with the input model within the uncertainties .",
    "we use a similar procedure to investigate whether abundance errors can smooth out an underlying disk model made up of a thin- and thick - disk component without showing up in our analysis . assuming _ segue_abundance uncertainties of 0.2 dex in @xmath1 $ ]  and 0.15 dex in @xmath0 $ ] , we first model the underlying abundance distribution using two gaussian components , and fit this model to the observed distribution with the assumed abundance uncertainties using the extreme - deconvolution technique @xcite .",
    "we use a gaussian mixture model for the underlying distribution solely as a convenient of decomposing the observed distribution for the purpose of this test .",
    "the two - gaussian mixture model adequately represents the observed distribution after convolving again with the uncertainties .",
    "the best - fit mixture has a gaussian centered near solar abundances ( 40percent of the sample ; @xmath1 $ ]  = @xmath151 dex , @xmath0 $ ]  = 0.1 dex ) and one at metal - poor and @xmath4-enhanced abundances ( 60percent of the sample ; @xmath1 $ ]  = @xmath77 dex , @xmath0 $ ]  = 0.35 dex ) . to reproduce the observed distribution ,",
    "these components both need a dispersion of 0.2 dex in @xmath1 $ ]  and 0.07 dex in @xmath0 $ ] , with a correlation of @xmath152 and @xmath153 , respectively .",
    "we then assign stars to these two components with probabilities computed from their posterior probability of being drawn from either component , based on their abundances and assumed abundance uncertainties .",
    "we sample new @xmath33-band magnitudes and coordinates for these stars based on the component they are assigned to : we draw the stars assigned to the solar - abundances component from a thin - disk density with @xmath63 = 300 pc and @xmath148 kpc , and stars assigned to the @xmath4-enhanced component from a thick - disk distribution with @xmath149 pc and @xmath64 = 2.5 kpc .",
    "we then run the same analysis code on this sample as is run on the real data .",
    "the results from this test are shown in  [ fig : fakebimodalresults ] .",
    "although in certain respects they are similar to the results for the real data , they are different in a few crucial ways .",
    "most importantly , when fitting a mixture of two exponential models to each bin we find unambiguous evidence in many bins for two components .",
    "this is shown in the lower right panel of  [ fig : fakebimodalresults ] , where the scale height of the dominant component when fitting the mixture is shown vs. the scale height when fitting a single exponential .",
    "for most bins with single - exponential @xmath154 pc , the dominant component is the @xmath147 pc input thin - disk component .",
    "therefore , even though the abundance pattern of the single - exponential scale height in the lower left panel of  [ fig : fakebimodalresults ] is smooth between thin and thick components , most bins are actually resolved into the two input components .",
    "this is a major difference with the real data , for which the equivalent comparison , shown in  [ fig : one_vs_two ] , shows a striking one - to - one correlation between the single - exponential and the mixture scale height , with no evidence for a second component for the vast majority of the mono - abundance bins .",
    "in addition to the fact that our analysis correctly identifies two components in each mono - abundance bin in the mock data , the abundance dependence of the inferred single - exponential scale height and scale length is also quite different from that of the mock data .",
    "the inferred scale length for the mock data is short for most abundance bins and only reaches @xmath155 kpc for those abundance bins that are farthest from the center of the metal - poor and @xmath4-enhanced abundance component .",
    "thus , the contamination from the thick - disk component with its short scale length drives the inferred scale length for most abundance bins to small values .",
    "this behavior is not observed in the real data (  [ fig : pixelfit_g ] ) .",
    "the abundance dependence of the single - exponential scale height for the mock data is also much steeper than observed in the real data , with values of @xmath156 pc as metal - rich as @xmath1 $ ]  = -0.3 .    from these tests",
    "we conclude that abundance errors can not explain the single - exponential components we observe in each mono - abundance bin in the real data or the abundance behavior of the scale height and scale length . based on an entirely different argument that uses the observed isothermality of the vertical kinematics of the same mono - abundance populations , @xcite infer that the internal _ segue _",
    "abundance uncertainties are likely somewhat smaller than the values reported by _",
    ", with likely uncertainties of 0.15 dex in @xmath1 $ ]  and 0.07 dex in @xmath0 $ ] .",

    "<S> the spatial , kinematic , and elemental - abundance structure of the milky way s stellar disk is complex , and has been difficult to dissect with local spectroscopic or global photometric data . here , </S>",
    "<S> we develop and apply a rigorous density modeling approach for galactic spectroscopic surveys that enables investigation of the global spatial structure of stellar sub - populations in narrow bins of @xmath0 $ ]  and @xmath1 $ ] , using 23,767 g - type dwarfs from _ sdss_/_segue _ , which effectively sample @xmath2 kpc and 0.3 @xmath3 kpc . </S>",
    "<S> we fit models for the number density of each such ( [ @xmath4/fe ] & [ fe / h ] ) mono - abundance component , properly accounting for the complex spectroscopic _ segue _  sampling of the underlying stellar population , as well as for the metallicity and color distributions of the samples . </S>",
    "<S> we find that each mono - abundance sub - population has a simple spatial structure that can be described by a single exponential in both the vertical and radial direction , with continuously increasing scale heights ( @xmath5200 pc to 1 kpc ) and decreasing scale lengths ( @xmath64.5 kpc to 2 kpc ) for increasingly older sub - populations , as indicated by their lower metallicities and @xmath0$]enhancements . </S>",
    "<S> that the abundance - selected sub - components with the largest scale heights have the shortest scale lengths is in sharp contrast with purely geometric ` thick  thin disk ' decompositions . to the extent </S>",
    "<S> that [ @xmath4/fe ] is an adequate proxy for age , our results directly show that older disk sub - populations are more centrally concentrated , which implies inside - out formation of galactic disks . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that the largest scale - height sub - components are most centrally concentrated in the milky way is an almost inevitable consequence of explaining the vertical structure of the disk through internal evolution . </S>",
    "<S> whether the simple spatial structure of the mono - abundance sub - components , and the striking correlations between age , scale length , and scale height can be plausibly explained by satellite accretion or other external heating remains to be seen . </S>"
