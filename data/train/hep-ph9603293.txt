    "as it stands now , the standard model ( sm ) is a very successful framework for describing elementary particles in the low energy region , say , less than 100 gev .",
    "however one of the most mysterious part of the theory , _ the origin of mass _ , has long been left unexplained .",
    "actually , mass of _ all _ particles in the sm is attributed to a _ single _",
    "order parameter , the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the higgs doublet .",
    "thus the problem of the origin of mass is simply reduced to understanding the dynamics of the higgs sector .    here",
    "we note that the situation very much resembles the ginzburg - landau ( gl ) s _ macroscopic _ theory for the superconductivity , the mysterious parts of which were eventually explained by the _",
    "microscopic _ theory of bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) : the gl s phenomenological order parameter was replaced by the cooper pair condensate due to the short range attractive forces .",
    "a similar thing has also happened to the hadron physics where the @xmath3 model description by gell - mann and levy ( gml ) works very well as far as the low energy ( macroscopic ) phenomena are concerned , while the deeper understanding of it was first given by nambu and jona - lasinio ( njl)@xcite based on the analogy with the bcs dynamics .",
    "nowadays people believe that essentially the same phenomena as described by the njl paper takes place in the microscopic theory for hadrons , qcd . in qcd",
    "the vev of @xmath3 , the gml s order parameter @xmath4 , has been replaced by the quark - antiquark pair condensate @xmath5 , an analogue of the cooper pair condensate , formed by the attractive color forces .",
    "the nambu - goldstone ( ng ) boson , the pion , is now a composite state of quark and antiquark .",
    "this is actually the prototype of the _ dynamical symmetry breaking _ ( dsb ) due to _ composite order parameters _ like fermion pair condensates .",
    "in fact higgs sector in the sm is precisely the same as the @xmath3 model except that @xmath4 is now replaced by the higgs vev@xmath6 , roughly a 2600 times scale - up .",
    "one is thus naturally led to speculate that there might exist a microscopic theory for the higgs sector , with the higgs vev being replaced by the fermion - antifermion pair condensate due to yet another strong interaction called technicolor ( tc)@xcite .    unfortunately , the original version of tc was too naive to survive the fcnc ( flavor - changing neutral current ) syndrome@xcite .",
    "it was not the end of the story , however .",
    "qcd - like theories ( simple scale - up s of qcd ) turned out _ not _ to be the _ unique _",
    "candidate for the underlying composite dynamics of the higgs sector .",
    "actually , there have been proposed a variety of composite higgs models which , though equally behaving as the @xmath3 model in the low energy region , still have different high energy behaviors than qcd ; walking technicolor@xcite , strong etc technicolor@xcite and the top quark condensate ( top mode standard model)@xcite , etc .. interactions in these models persist at high energy or short distance and hence produce tightly bound composite higgs .",
    "these tightly bound composite higgs models were actually proposed based on the explicit dynamics , gauged njl model ( gauge theory plus four - fermion interaction ) within the framework of ladder schwinger - dyson ( sd ) equation . the gauged njl model@xcite was shown to have a phase structure divided by a critical coupling ( critical line)@xcite similarly to the njl model , and have a _ large anomalous dimension _",
    "@xcite due to _ strong attractive forces at relatively short distance or high energy_. such a system may actually be regarded as a theory with ultraviolet fixed point(s ) in contrast to the asymptotic freedom .",
    "a remarkable feature of this dynamics is that the four - fermion interation in four dimensions may become _ renormalizable _ thanks to the large anomalous dimension ( @xmath7 ) and the presence of gauge interaction ( @xmath8 ) in sharp contrast to the pure njl model with `` @xmath9''.@xcite    in this lecture we would like to give a general description of dsb with large anomalous dimension and tightly bound composite higgs models based on that dynamics .",
    "main parts of this subject have already been covered by many reviews@xcite and a textbook@xcite . here",
    "we shall put a stress rather on the renormalizability of the gauged njl model and its possible application@xcite to modifications of the top quark condensate in a way consistent with the recent discovery of a heavy top quark with mass about 180 gev @xcite .",
    "we start with basic concepts of dsb with particular emphasis on its characterization in the high energy behavior through anomalous dimension ( section 2 ) .",
    "we then proceed to a general idea of tc and the role of anomalous dimension ( section 3 ) .",
    "detailed explanation will be given to how the large anomalous dimension arises in explicit dynamics , njl model and gauged njl model : in particular , the gauged njl model is shown to be renormalizable in a non - perturbative sense , due to the large anomalous dimension and the very presence of gauge interaction ( section 4 , 5 ) .",
    "we demonstrate that the entire coupling space of the gauged njl model encompasses a variety of tightly bound composite higgs models , i.e. , walking technicolor , strong etc technicolor and top quark condensate ( section 6 ) . in section 7 detailed discussion",
    "will be given to the top quark condensate which actually predicted the top quark mass on the order of weak scale , exceptionally large compared with all other quarks and leptons .",
    "we give a detailed comparison between the original formulation of miransky - tanabashi - yamawaki ( mty)@xcite and another one of bardeen - hill - lindner ( bhl)@xcite .",
    "we then discuss the renormalizability of the gauged njl model which may be applied to a possible modification of the top quark condensate ( `` top mode walking gut'').@xcite",
    "here we first summarize basic concepts of the spontaneous symmetry breaking in a way suitable to discussions on the dsb .",

    "our principal interest lies in the variation of @xmath27 , @xmath28 .    now , there are two types of realizations ( phases ) of the symmetry : + ( i ) wigner realization .",
    "+ if a symmetry of the action is also the symmetry of the vacuum : @xmath29 then we have @xmath30 from ( [ g_n ] ) , i.e. , @xmath31 for _ all _ green functions .",
    "namely , @xmath32 .",
    "hence the symmetry is also the symmetry of physical states in the fock space constructed upon this vacuum : they are classified according to the usual representation theory of the group .",
    "+ ( ii ) nambu - goldstone ( ng ) realization .",
    "+ conversely , if a symmetry of the action is not the symmetry of the physical states in such a way that there exists _ at least one _ ( not necessarily all ) green function such that @xmath33 then the vacuum does not respect the symmetry ; symbolically , @xmath34 namely , @xmath35@xmath36 . we say that the symmetry is _ spontaneously broken_. + the variation @xmath37 is called an _ order parameter _ which in fact discriminates between the two realizations , wigner ( or disordered ) phase with @xmath38 and ng ( or ordered ) phase with @xmath39 . we shall call it a `` _ composite order parameter _ ''",

    "now we come to the basic theorem of the spontaneous symmetry breaking , namely the ng theorem : if the continuous symmetry is spontaneously broken such that @xmath46 , then there exist massless spinless bosons ( ng bosons ) coupled to the currents @xmath47 .",
    "the proof is as follows : + define @xmath48 where @xmath49 are fields appearing in the lagrangian .",

    "the order parameter @xmath39 is nothing but a residue of the ng boson pole .",
    "this establishes existence of a massless spinless boson ( ng boson ) coupled to the current @xmath57 ( broken current ) with strength @xmath37 .",

    "however , the predicted mass @xmath645 is somewhat larger than the mass of the recently discovered top quark , @xmath646 ( cdf ) and @xmath647 ( d0)@xcite . here we shall discuss a possible remedy of this problem within the simplest model based on the mty lagrangian ( [ eq : tb-4fermi]).@xcite      first we recall that the top mass prediction is a _ decreasing _ function of the cutoff @xmath213 .",
    "then the simplest way to reduce the top mass would be to raise the cutoff as much as possible .",
    "let us assume that quantum gravity effects would not change drastically the physics described by the low energy theory without gravity .",
    "then we may raise the cutoff @xmath213 beyond the planck scale up to the landau pole @xmath648 where the @xmath533 gauge coupling @xmath615 diverges and the sm description itself stops to be self - consistent . in such a case the top and higgs mass prediction becomes : @xmath649 which is the absolute minimum value of the prediction within the simplest version of the top quark condensate .    if it is really the case , it would imply composite @xmath533 gauge boson and composite higgs generated _ at once by the same dynamics _ , since the landau pole then may be regarded as a bhl compositeness condition also for the vector bound state as well as the composite higgs .",
    "actually , we can formulate the bhl compositeness condition for vector - type four - fermion interactions ( thirring - type four - fermion theory ) as a _ necessary condition _ for the formation of a vector bound state .",
    "the possibility that both the higgs and @xmath533 gauge boson can be composites by the same dynamics may be illustrated by an explicit model , the thirring model in @xmath397 dimensions . reformulated as a gauge theory through hidden local symmetry@xcite",
    ", the thirring model was shown to have the dynamical mass generation , which implies that a composite higgs and a composite gauge boson are generated at the same time.@xcite    at any rate , the prediction of this scenario @xmath534 still seems to be a little bit higher than the experimental value , although the situation is not very conclusive yet",
    ". then we shall consider another possibility , namely , taking the cutoff to infinity : @xmath650 . in order to do this",
    "we should first recall the previous discussions on the renormalizability of the gauged njl model with `` walking '' gauge coupling ( @xmath515).@xcite      this phenomenon was first pointed out by kondo , shuto and yamawaki@xcite through the convergence of @xmath605 in the ps formula for the solution of the sd equation ( [ eq:(4.5 ) ] ) in the four - fermion theory plus qcd .",
    "contrary to the logarithmic divergence of ( [ eq : f - njl1 ] ) in the pure njl model , it was emphasized that for @xmath515 we have a _ convergent _",
    "integral for @xmath605 and hence a nontrivial ( interacting ) theory with finite effective yukawa coupling @xmath651 in the continuum limit : namely , the presence of `` walking '' ( @xmath515 ) gauge interaction changes the trivial / nonrenormalizable theory ( pure njl model ) into a nontrivial / renormalizable theory ( gauged njl model).@xcite    the analytical expression of the effective yukawa coupling is already given by ( [ eq : marciano ] ) ( mty ) , which is equivalent to ( [ bhlyukawa ] ) obtained as a solution of the rg equation with a compositeness condition at @xmath531 leading ( bhl ) . from this expression it was again",
    "noted@xcite that _",
    "iff @xmath515 _ ( `` walking '' gauge coupling with @xmath652 ) , then the effective yukawa coupling remains finite , @xmath653 , in the continuum limit @xmath378 .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to the triviality of the pure njl model in which @xmath654 in the continuum limit as was mentioned earlier .",
    "it was further pointed out by kondo , tanabashi and yamawaki@xcite that this renormalizability is equivalent to existence of a pr infrared fixed point@xcite for the gauged yukawa model .",
    "the pr fixed point is given by the solution of @xmath655 with ( [ eq : top62 ] ) and ( [ eq : top63 ] ) : @xmath656 where @xmath657 .",
    "similar argument was recently developed more systematically by harada , kikukawa , kugo and nakano.@xcite .    as to the non - running ( standing ) case ( @xmath499 ) , the integral for @xmath658 is more rapidly convergent , since @xmath473 is power damping , ( [ eq:(4.3 ) ] ) , instead of logarithmic damping . in this case",
    "the renormalization procedure was performed explicitly by kondo , tanabashi and yamawaki @xcite through the effective potential in the ladder approximation as was already explained in section 5 .      in view of the renormalizability of the gauged njl model with `` walking '' gauge coupling",
    ", we may take the @xmath378 limit of the top quark condensate .",
    "however , in the realistic case we actually have the @xmath533 gauge coupling which , as it stands , grows at high energy to blow up at landau pole and hence invalidates the above arguments of the renormalizability .",
    "thus , in order to apply the above arguments to the top quark condensate , we must remove the @xmath533 gauge interaction in such a way as to unify it into a gut with `` walking '' coupling ( @xmath515 ) beyond gut scale .",
    "then the renormalizability requires that the gut coupling at gut scale should be determined by the pr infrared fixed point.@xcite    for a simple - minded gut with @xmath424 group , the pr fixed point takes the form similar to ( [ pr ] ) : @xmath659 where we assumed @xmath660 and @xmath535 ( @xmath661 ) for simplicity .",
    "then the top yukawa coupling at gut scale is essentially determined by the gut coupling at gut scale up to some numerical factor depending on the gut group and the representations of particle contents . using `` effective gut coupling '' including such possible numerical factors , we may perform the bhl full rg equation analysis for @xmath662 with the boundary condition of the above pr fixed point at gut scale",
    ".    for typical values of the effective gut coupling @xmath663 and 1/60 , prediction of the top and higgs masses reads : @xmath664 respectively .",
    "note that these pr fixed point values at gut scale are somewhat smaller than the coupling values at gut scale which focus on the quasi - infrared fixed point in the low energy region .",
    "thus the prediction is a little bit away from the quasi - infrared fixed point .",
    "this would be the simplest extension of the top quark condensate consistent with the recent experiment on the top quark mass .",
    "we have discussed a variety of tightly bound composite higgs models , walking technicolor , strong etc technicolor and top quark condensate , based on the gauged njl model as the explicit dynamics with large anomalous dimension and fixed point .",
    "universal feature of this type of dynamics is the amplification of the symmetry violation due to the large anomalous dimension or the fine - tuning of the coupling near the critical point ( uv fixed point ) .",
    "an extreme case @xmath2 yields maximal symmetry violation , which was used to predict an exceptionally large mass of the top quark , even if the top coupling is on the same order as those of other quarks and leptons .",
    "the fine - tuning of the gauged njl model corresponds to the renormalization which leads to the existence of the renormalizable and nontrivial continuum theory in contrast to the pure njl model .",
    "although the situation about top quark mass is still not yet conclusive , we hope that at least essence of the idea of the top quark condensate may eventually survive in the sense that the _ origin of mass _ is deeply related to the top quark mass .",
    "+ we would like to thank iwana inukai and masaharu tanabashi for collaboration and discussions on the recent results presented in this lecture .",
