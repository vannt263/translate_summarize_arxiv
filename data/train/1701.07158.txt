    "image restoration , including image denoising , deblurring , inpainting , computed tomography , etc .",
    ", is one of the most important areas in imaging science .",
    "it aims at recovering an image of high - quality from a given measurement which is degraded during the process of imaging , acquisition , and communication .",
    "an image restoration problem is typically modeled as the following linear inverse problem : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the degraded measurement or the observed image , @xmath3 is a certain additive noise , and @xmath4 is some linear operator which takes different forms for different image restoration problems . note that this paper involves both functions ( operators ) and their discrete counterparts .",
    "we shall use regular characters to denote functions or operators and use bold - faced characters to denote their discrete analogs .",
    "for example , we use @xmath5 to denote a linear operator between two function spaces and @xmath6 as an element in a function space , while we use @xmath4 and @xmath7 to denote their corresponding discretized versions ( the type of discretization will be made clear later ) .",
    "the operator @xmath4 is in general ill - conditioned ( e.g. for deblurring ) or non - invertible ( e.g. for inpainting ) .",
    "naive inversions of in the presence of noise @xmath3 will inevitably lead to significant noise amplification .",
    "hence , in order to obtain a high quality recovery from the ill - posed linear inverse problem , a proper regularization on the images to be recovered is needed .",
    "successful regularization based methods include the rudin - osher - fatemi model @xcite and its nonlocal variants @xcite , the inf - convolution model @xcite , the total generalized variation ( tgv ) model @xcite , the combined first and second order total variation model @xcite , and the applied harmonic analysis approach such as curvelets @xcite , gabor frames @xcite , shearlets @xcite , complex tight framelets @xcite , wavelet frames @xcite , etc .",
    "the common concept of these methods is to find sparse approximation of images using a properly designed linear transformation together with a sparsity promoting regularization term ( such as the widely used @xmath8 norm ) .",
    "a typical @xmath8 norm based regularization model takes the following form @xmath9 where @xmath10 is some sparsifying linear transform ( such as wavelet transform or @xmath11 ) .",
    "this general formulation is widely applied in image restoration for regularizing designed smooth image components while preserving image singularities .",
    "meanwhile , the idea of explicitly taking image singularities into consideration was first explored in the pioneer work @xcite , where the following model , known as the mumford - shah model , was introduced : @xmath12 here , @xmath13 denotes the length of one - dimensional curve @xmath14 representing edges . due to the smoothness promoting property of @xmath15 norm , the above mumford - shah functional encourages @xmath6 to be smooth except along @xmath14 ( see @xcite for detailed surveys on the mumford - shah model and @xcite for the applications to image restoration ) . in a discrete setting , if we know the exact locations of image singularities , then we can recover the image @xmath7 with sharp edges by solving the following minimization problem : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the index set of pixels corresponding to image singularities .",
    "the problem is easy to solve once we know @xmath17 .",
    "however , the restoration result of can be highly sensitive to the estimation of @xmath17 , and the main challenge lies in how to identify @xmath17 as accurately as possible from degraded observed images .",
    "sparse regularization with wavelet frame transforms is successfully applied in various imaging problems , due to its effectiveness of capturing multiscale singularities using compactly supported wavelet frame functions of varied vanishing moments . in connection with mumford - shah model , the authors in @xcite exploited the favorable properties of wavelet frames , and proposed the following piecewise smooth wavelet frame image restoration model : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a wavelet frame transform and @xmath17 is the image singularities set to be estimated . as image singularities can be well approximated by wavelet frame coefficients of large magnitude , uses the @xmath15 norm to promote the smoothness of image away from @xmath17 , and uses the @xmath8 norm to recover sharp features lying in @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "the authors proved that under the assumption of a fixed index set @xmath17 , the discrete model converges to a new variational model as the resolution goes to infinity .",
    "a special case of the variational model is related to ( and yet significantly different from ) the mumford - shah functional . as a byproduct of the analysis in @xcite",
    ", it demonstrated that the model is more computationally tractable than the mumford - shah model .",
    "interested readers should consult @xcite for more details .",
    "another model that exploits the similar idea is the following constrained minimization model proposed in @xcite : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the feasible set for @xmath17 , and the constraint on @xmath22 is imposed to promote the regularity of the singularity set , by implication , the sparsity of the wavelet frame coefficients @xmath23 . unlike which directly updates @xmath17 by comparing the @xmath8 norm and @xmath15 norm of @xmath23 at each step , additional geometric constraints on @xmath17 in are utilized to regularize image singularities .    even though both and showed significant improvements over the typical wavelet frame sparsity based image restoration model , the above two models have their own drawbacks . for , since",
    "@xmath17 is estimated solely depending on the wavelet frame coefficients , the estimated @xmath17 may capture the unwanted isolated singularities when the measurement @xmath2 is severely noisy .",
    "in addition , since @xmath23 is split into the @xmath8 and the @xmath15 part , the reconstructed image may suffer from the staircase effect on the interface of @xmath17 and @xmath24 .",
    "for , as the coefficients @xmath23 on @xmath17 are not directly penalized , may introduce overly sharpened singularities compared to , especially in the case of deblurring with a severely degraded @xmath2 .",
    "in addition , it is difficult to rigorously analyze the model and its solutions with the presence of the singularities set @xmath17 .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a new edge driven wavelet frame based image restoration model .",
    "we use the term `` edge driven '' as the proposed model continues to exploit the idea of alternate recovery of the image and the estimation of its singularities set in a different form . here",
    ", we provide a first glance of the model as follows : @xmath25 where @xmath7 is the image to be reconstructed , @xmath26 denotes a relaxed set indicator of the singularities set , and @xmath19 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 are three wavelet frame transforms applied to different components of the images . for the clarity of presentation , the detailed definition and the analysis of the model in a multi - level decomposition form",
    "are postponed until section [ waveletmodelalg]-[variationasymanal ] .",
    "our model is closely related to the piecewise smooth wavelet frame models and .",
    "in fact , can be viewed as a relaxation of @xmath29 where @xmath17 is the estimated singularities of @xmath7 and @xmath30 is its set indicator .",
    "the first term is used to restore smooth regions of an image , while the second term preserves singularities , and the third term provides the regularization on singularities to enhance sharp image features . in other words",
    ", our model inflicts a different strength of regularization in smooth image regions and near image singularities such as edges , and actively restores / enhances sharp image features at the same time .",
    "as the first two terms are exchangeable , an appropriate choice of the wavelet frame transforms as well as the associated parameters is needed to obtain desired effects .",
    "the details of the properties of the three transforms will be detailed in section [ modelalg ] .",
    "compared to the two existing models and , it should be noted that instead of using @xmath15 norm , @xmath8 norm is used to promote regularity in the smooth region , as the image singularities can be better protected if the singularity set @xmath17 is not accurate .",
    "this leads to a more robust image approximation that is less sensitive to the estimation of the singularities of the unknown true image from the degraded measurement .",
    "in addition , an implicit and relaxed representation of the singularity set allows continuous overlap between the smooth and the sharp image regions in the transform domain . we expect that such overlap helps to suppress the staircase effects near the interface .",
    "finally , representing the singularity set implicitly enables us to provide an asymptotic analysis of the model with respect to both @xmath6 and @xmath31 , in contrast to that of where the singularity set is assumed to be fixed . to facilitate a better understanding of the proposed model and its relation to some existing variational models",
    ", we will present an asymptotic analysis of the proposed model .",
    "we discover that the continuum limit of the proposed model ( after a reformulation ) takes the following form @xmath32 which is an edge driven variational model that includes several existing variational and partial differential equation ( pde ) models as special cases ( see subsection [ correspondingvariational ] for more details ) .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ waveletframereview ]",
    ", we introduce some basics of wavelet frame that will be used in later sections .",
    "we propose the discrete edge driven wavelet frame based model and its associated algorithm in section [ waveletmodelalg ] .",
    "numerical simulations of our proposed model and comparisons with some of the existing models are conducted at the end of this section . in section [ variationasymanal ]",
    ", we present the continuum limit of the the proposed discrete model and provide a rigorous asymptotic analysis .",
    "all technical proofs will be postponed to the appendix .",
    "in this section , we present some basics of wavelet frame theory and some preliminary results .      in this subsection , we briefly introduce the concept of tight frames and wavelet tight frames . for the details ,",
    "one may consult @xcite for theories of frames and wavelet frames , @xcite for a short survey on the theory and applications of frames , and @xcite for more detailed surveys .    a countable set @xmath33 with @xmath34",
    "is called a tight frame of @xmath35 if @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the inner product on @xmath35 , and @xmath38 is called the canonical coefficient of @xmath39 .    for given @xmath40 and @xmath41 , the corresponding quasi - affine system @xmath42 generated by @xmath43",

    "when @xmath48 , we simply write @xmath49 . note that in the literature , the affine system is widely used , which corresponds to the decimate wavelet ( frame ) transform .",
    "the quasi - affine system , which corresponds to the undecimated wavelet ( frame ) transformation , was first introduced and analyzed in @xcite . throughout this paper",
    ", we only discuss the quasi - affine system because it generally performs better in image restoration and the connection to pde is more natural than the widely used affine system @xcite .",

    "throughout this paper , we assume for simplicity that all images are square images ; @xmath83 , and we only consider the mra based tensor product wavelet frame system .",

    "the vanishing moments of framelets are closely related to the orders of differential operators and their corresponding finite difference operators .",
    "it is a crucial observation first made in @xcite and was further explored in , and will be vital to our analysis as well .    throughout this paper , for a given multi - index @xmath98 , we denote @xmath99 . for two multi - indices @xmath89 and @xmath100 , we say @xmath101 if @xmath102 for all @xmath103 . for @xmath104 and a multi - index @xmath105 , we denote @xmath106 .",
