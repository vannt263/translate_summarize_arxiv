    "recently , the fractional versions of the poisson and the negative binomial processes have received a lot of attention of the researchers .",
    "these fractional processes have been found more useful , than the classical ones , for modelling several phenomena that occur in various disciplines .",
    "one of the aims of this paper is to introduce a new fractional version of the well - known negative binomial ( nb ) process .",
    "the latter is widely applied in many different fields , mainly for its property of overdispersion ; see koz , @xcite and @xcite ( where the more general tweedie - poisson model is studied ) .",
    "a first fractional version of the nb process has been introduced by vellaisamy and maheshwari in @xcite and we refer to it as a time - fractional variant , since it is defined by means of the so - called time - fractional poisson process \" .",
    "other and different fractional versions have been defined in @xcite and @xcite , in terms of the fractional gamma process ; see @xcite for the differences among these approaches .",
    "henceforth , @xmath1 denotes the set of nonnegative integers .",
    "let @xmath2 for any @xmath3 @xmath4 and let @xmath5 be a negative binomial r.v . with parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 , with distribution@xmath8which we denote by @xmath9 when @xmath10 , a positive integer , @xmath5 denotes the number of successes before the @xmath11-th failure in a sequence of bernoulli trials with success probability @xmath12 .",
    "let @xmath13 be a homogeneous poisson process with rate @xmath14 , and @xmath15 be an independent gamma subordinator , where @xmath16 , the gamma distribution with scale parameter @xmath17 and shape parameter @xmath18 ( see eq .",
    "( [ gdensity ] ) below ) .",
    "then the process @xmath19 is called a negative binomial process and @xmath20 , for @xmath21 , where @xmath22 ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath23 be the time - fractional poisson process ( see @xcite , mee ) , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 is the inverse - stable subordinator .",
    "recently , the time - fractional nb process @xmath26 was introduced and its properties investigated detail in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath27 , @xmath28 , be a @xmath29-stable subordinator .",
    "then the space - fractional poisson process ( sfpp ) defined as @xmath30 was introduced and discussed in @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is of interest to define the space - fractional negative binomial ( sfnb ) process , analogous to sfpp ( see def.4 below ) .",
    "note that the sfnb process would be a lvy process , unlike the time - fractional nb process studied in @xcite .    in section 2",
    ", we introduce the sfnb process , obtain its one - dimensional distributions and also derive the underlying governing equations .",
    "moreover , we prove that it is equivalent , in the sense of the finite - dimensional distributions , to a compound - sum process , where the leading counting process is represented by a sfpp .",
    "this representation shows that the sfnb process could be to be suitable for some biological applications , in the analysis of groups of individuals distributed randomly in space ( or time ) .",
    "more precisely , let the number of colonies be represented by a space - fractional poisson process and let the number of individuals in the colonies be distributed independently ( according to a generalization of the logarithmic distribution ) .",
    "then the total size of the population follows a sfnb process .",
    "the use of nb distribution in biological data dates back to the nineteen fifties ( see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite )",
    ". the sfnb process could be useful for practical situations where the evolution of the number of groups or colonies is not an orderly process , _ i.e. _ , it can increase more than one unit in a infinitely small interval of time with positive probability . on the contrary , when modeling this kind of population evolutions by the standard nb process , multiple occurrences are not allowed ( see , e.g. @xcite and the references therein ) .    in section 3 ,",
    "we present two different generalizations of the previous results : the first one is obtained by taking the fractional index @xmath31 random instead of constant in @xmath32 . in particular , we will consider the case of a two - valued discrete random variable",
    ". the second extension is obtained by considering the following subordination @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the space - fractional poisson process with @xmath35 replaced by the process @xmath36 and @xmath37 is a positive constant .",
    "we call @xmath38 space - fractional polya - type \" process , in analogy to @xcite .    finally , in section 4 , we consider the multidimensional extension of the sfnb process , by subordinating the space - fractional poisson process studied in @xcite by a common gamma subordinator .",
    "the process is a multidimensional lvy process , for which we evaluate the corresponding lvy measure .",
    "for all the above mentioned processes , we give the one - dimensional distributions and the corresponding governing equations .",
    "first , we introduce some preliminary definitions and results that will be used later .      we start with the space - fractional poisson process ( sfpp ) @xmath39 .",
