    "to face the present and forthcoming global energy crisis , human should search for clean and effective energy source .",
    "recently the investigations on the basic energy science for this purpose has received great attention and experienced impressive progress based on the fundamental physics fleming08,arti . in photosynthetic process ,",
    "the structural elegance and chemical high efficiency of the natural system based on pigment molecules in transferring the energy of sunlight have stimulated a purpose driven investigation @xcite , finding artificial analogs of porphyrin - based chromophores .",
    "these artificial systems replicate the natural process of photosynthesis @xcite so that the much higher efficiencies could be gained than that obtained in the conventional solid systems @xcite .",
    "it is because one of the most attractive features of photosynthesis is that the light energy can be captured and transported to the reaction center ( rc ) within about 100ps and with more than 95% efficiency @xcite .",
    "actually , in most of the plants and bacterium , the primary processes of photosynthesis are almost in common @xcite : light is harvested by antenna proteins containing many chromophores ; then the electronic excitations are transferred to the rc sequentially , where photochemical reactions take place to convert the excitation energy into chemical energy .",
    "most recent experiments have been able to exactly determine the time scales of various transfer processes by the ultra - fast laser technology @xcite .",
    "these great progresses obviously offer us a chance to quantitatively make clear the underlying physical mechanism of the photosynthesis , so that people can construct the artificial photosynthesis devices in the future to reach the photon - energy and photon - electricity conversions with higher efficiency . for example , quantum interference effects in energy transfer dynamics @xcite has been studied for the fenna - matthews - olson ( fmo ) protein complex , and it was found @xcite that , for such molecular arrays , the spatial correlations in the phonon bath and its induced decoherence could affect on the efficiency of the primary photosynthetic event .",
    "the present paper will similarly study the influences of spatial structure on the primary processes of photosynthesis for the light - harvesting complexes ii ( lh2 ) .    in the past , by making use of the x - ray crystallographic techniques , the structure of light - harvesting system has been elucidated huxiche96,venturi08 . in the purple photosynthetic bacteria , there exist roughly two types of light - harvesting complexes , referred to as light - harvesting complex i ( lh1 ) and light - harvesting complex ii ( lh2 ) . in lh1 , the rc is surrounded by a b875 bacteriochlorophyll ( bchl ) ring with maximum absorption peak at 875 nm .",
    "the lh2 complex , however , does not contain the rc , but can transfer energy excitation to the rc indirectly through lh1 . in the purple bacteria , lh2 is a ring - shaped aggregate built up by @xmath0 ( or @xmath1 ) minimal units , where each unit consists of an @xmath2-heterodimer , three bchls , and one carotenoid .",
    "the @xmath2-heterodimers , i.e. , @xmath3-apoproteins and @xmath4-apoproteins constitute the skeleton of lh2 , while the bchls are embedded in the scaffold to form a double - layered ring structure .",
    "the top ring including @xmath5 ( or @xmath6 ) bchl molecules is named as b850 since it has the lowest - energy absorption maximum at 850 nm .",
    "the bottom ring with 8 bchls is called b800 because it mainly absorbs light at 800 nm . in every minimal unit ,",
    "the carotenoid connects b800 bchl with one of the two b850 bchls .",
    "excitation is transferred from one pigment to the neighbor one through the fster mechanism huxiche971 , while the electron is spatially transferred via the marcus mechanism @xcite .",
    "generally , it is independent of the global geometry configuration of the system .    in the present paper",
    ", we will study the energy transfer procedure in lh2 by considering the structure dimerization of the b850 ring .",
    "it has been conjectured that the dimerized inter - pigment couplings can cause the energy gap to protect the collective excitations @xcite . indeed , like the the su - schrieffer - heeger model for the flexible polyacetylene chain ssh , the dimerization of the spatial configuration with the peierls distorted ground state will minimize the total energy for the phonon plus electron . as it is well known , this model exhibits a rich variety of nonlinear phenomena and topological excitations including the topological protection of the quantum state transfer @xcite .",
    "similarly , we will show that , when the b850 ring in lh2 is dimerized the excitation transfer efficiency may be enhanced to some extent .    based on the open quantum system theory , we simply model the excited and un - excited states of a bchl pigment as a quasispin .",
    "the excitation transfer is represented by the total leakage from a lh2 . using the master equation",
    ", we calculate the efficiency of excitation transfer and the average transfer time in low temperature for various initial states with different superposition properties .",
    "the results explicitly indicate that the dimerization of couplings indeed enhances the quantum transport efficiency and shortens the average transfer time .     and @xmath7 .",
