    "neutral and charged metal clusters consisting of a  few 100 to a  few 1000 atoms possibly containing a  limited member ( @xmath5  10 ) of positive or negative surplus charges received considerable scientific interest since 1984 . at that time , when studying the formation of tiny alkali clusters out of metal vapour , an enhanced production of clusters with certain atomic numbers ( @xmath0 = 8 , 20 , 40 , 58 , 92 , etc . ) was observed [ 1 , 2 ] and was correlated with the appearance of shell closures for the motion of the free electrons i.e. the conduction ( valence ) electrons in a  spherically symmetric average potential for the itinerant electrons .",
    "a  free electron feels an average potential which is produced by the background of positive ions , on the one hand , and by the other free electrons , on the other .    the most prominent peaks in the mass yield were shown to be due to shell closures in a  spherically symmetric potential [ 38 ] , whereas tinyer details of the abundance curve were successfully related to secondary shell effects in axially symmetric deformed [ 911 ] and non - axially symmetric deformed",

    "the calculations are usually performed using the strutinsky shell correction method [ 13 ] or the more involved self - consistent field approach [ 14 , 15 ] .    a  large amount of beautiful experimental work [ 16 , 17 ] has been performed since the discovery in 1984 .",

    "we choose it to be the ratio @xmath18 between the volume of the inner hole to the volume of the entire bubble .",
    "the conduction electrons move independently in an average potential @xmath19 which represents the mean interaction of a  given electron with all the other electrons and with the positive back ground charge @xmath20 . in the hartree - fock approximation",

    "we assume that the temperature is zero .",
    "the hartree - fock potential ( 2.8 ) is seen to be state - dependent mainly due to the exchange term .",

    "a considerable simplification is obtained if the selfconsistent average potential ( 2.6 ) is replaced by a phenomenological ansatz .",
    "most of the shell structure calculations for compact metal clusters have been performed on the basis of simple phenomenological potentials , in particular the nilsson potential [ 9 ] , the saxon - woods potential [ 7 , 11 ] , and the , , wine - bottle  potential [ 7 ] .",
    "it can indeed be seen from the results of ref . [ 3 ] that for atom numbers @xmath36 the selfonsistently calculated potential @xmath19 resembles a  saxon - woods potential and roughly even to a  square well .",
    "we , therefore , felt justified to represent the average potential @xmath19 for the case of a  bubble cluster by an infinite square well with the boundaries given by the distribution of the positive ions @xmath37 this simple choice of the shell model potential has the great advantage that the eigenfunctions of the schrdinger equation ( 2.5 ) are linear combinations of spherical bessel- and neumann functions and the eigenenergies @xmath22 are easily obtained from the boundary conditions at @xmath38 [ 23 ] .",
    "the well depth @xmath39 in ( 2.12 ) is of the order of 0.5 ry ( 1 ry = 13,6  ev ) .",

    "charged clusters , we have to add the electrostatic energy @xmath47 of the sytem @xmath48 which turns out to be a much bigger term than in a neutral cluster .",
    "some authors [ 10 ] include a term proportional to the average curvature of the surface which is the 3@xmath49 term in the expansion of the energy - density functional of a  leptodermons sytem in terms of @xmath50 .",
    "in the case of a  bubble shape , the curvature terms arising from the inner and outer surface have opposite signs beside the fact that their absolute value is much smaller than the corresponding surface term .",
    "we omit the curvature term thereby following ref .",
    "consideration of the curvature term would favour spherical bubbles as compared to compact spheres .",

    "consequently , we used the coulomb energy in zeroth order of @xmath64 in our calculations .",
    "the total energy of the spherical metallic bubble has thus the form @xmath65 subtracting from this expression the energy of a  compact spherical cluster of the same charge @xmath55 and the same volume we obtain @xmath66 where @xmath67 and @xmath68 we note that the single particle potential ( 2.12 ) becomes a  simple central square - well in the limit @xmath69 ( i.e. @xmath70 ) .",

    "the surface tension @xmath79 and the radius @xmath80 of the wigner - seitz cell are thus the only parameters which specify a  given metal in our model .",
    "the difference @xmath81 between the ld - energies of the compact cluster and the bubble ( eqn .",

    ".    the difference @xmath82 of the shell correction terms can be positive or negative .",
    "if the number @xmath83 of valence electrons happens to be a  magic number for the bubble geometry , and not for the compound spherical form , @xmath82 will be a  negative number and thus favour the formation of a  bubble a.v.v .",
    "the question whether , for given charge , the bubble has a lower energy than the compact sphere , depends sensitively on the value of the surface constant @xmath79 and the radius parameter @xmath84 .",
    "more precisely , it depends on the `` fissility '' parameter which is defined to be the ratio of the coulomb energy @xmath47 and twice the surface energy @xmath85 .",
    "the factor 2 is inserted in order to retain the definition used in nuclear physics : @xmath86 with @xmath87 , the fissility parameter of a compact sphere , being defined by @xmath88 the difference @xmath89 between the ld - energy of the spherical bubble and of the compact spherical cluster ( see ( 2.21 ) ) measured in units of @xmath90 is given by the function @xmath91 - x_0   \\left[1 - ( 1 - f)^{1/3}\\right]\\ , .",

    "a crucial question is the dependence of the total energy on deformation : it can be easily shown that the ld - energy of a  bubble decreases as a  function of deformation because the decrease of the repulsive electrostatic energy turns out to be greater than the increase of the surface energy .",
    "a  spherical bubble may , however , be stabilized against deformation by shell effects .",
    "if the @xmath83 valence electrons of the charged metal bubble correspond to a  closed shell configuration in the spherically symmetric potential ( 2.12 ) , the shell energy yields an additional binding of a  couple of ev .",
    "as one deforms the bubble the absolute value of this negative shell energy decreases as a  function of deformation . in this way",
    "a  barrier against fission is produced .",
    "the calculation of the total energy of the bubble as a  function of the deformation implies that we determine the eigenvalues in a  deformed bubble potential .",
