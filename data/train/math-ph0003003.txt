    "suppose one interpolates between fredholm operators with different indices .",
    "what can one say about the way the indices change ?",
    "the answer to this question depends on the choice of the embedding space for the fredholm operators in question . in the space of bounded operators , little",
    "can be said .",
    "but , in the space of toeplitz operators , ( and then also for toeplitz modulu compacts ) , as we shall explain , the indices change by abrupt discontinuous jumps that tend to be small .",
    "we relate this behavior to certain conjectures and open problems that arise in the context of the quantum hall effect ( qhe ) @xcite .      in the theory of the integer quantum hall effect ( of non - interacting electrons ) @xcite",
    "one identifies the hall conductance with the fredholm index of a rather special operator , namely @xmath0 , thought of as an operator on the range of @xmath1 . here",
    "@xmath2 is an ( infinite dimensional ) projection in the hilbert space @xmath3 , namely the projection on the spectrum of the one electron hamiltonian below the fermi energy @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath5 is the multiplication operator @xmath6 associated with a singular gauge transformation that introduces an aharonov - bohm flux tube at the origin of the euclidean plane .",
    "@xmath0 is fredholm provided the integral kernel of the projection , @xmath7 has good decay properties as @xmath8 gets large @xcite .",
    "recent progress in the rigorous theory of random schrdinger operators relevant to the qhe @xcite guarantees good decay properties for @xmath7 provided @xmath4 lies in certain energy intervals .",
    "percolation arguments @xcite and scaling theories of localization @xcite give theoretical evidence that these decay properties persist for all but a discrete set of energies .",
    "this implies that the graph of the hall conductace as a function of @xmath4 should be a step function . indeed , experimentally , the hall conductance in the integer hall effect , is close to a monotonic step function with @xmath9 and @xmath10 jumps @xcite .",
    "( jumps by 2 occur when the hall conductance is larger than 6 and is attributed to the smallness of the magnetic moment of the electron in these systems . )    the smallness of the jumps of the fredholm indices in the qhe might , of course , be a special property of a special system . here , instead , we want to explore the opposite point of view , namely the possibility that the existence of steps and the smallness of the jumps reflects a generic property of fredholm indices and has little to do with the specific properties of the system in question .",
    "some support to this point of view comes from the relation of chern numbers and fredholm indices . in non - commutative geometry @xcite chern numbers and fredholm indices are intimately related .",
    "this is also the case in the index theory of elliptic operators @xcite . for chern numbers that arise from studies of spectral bundles ( of hamiltonians with discrete spectra ) ,",
    "a generic deformation of the hamiltonian leads to a step function with @xmath9 jumps in the first chern number @xcite .",
    "this follows from the wigner von neumann codimension 3 rule for eigenvalue crossing @xcite and the fact that a generic crossing is a conic crossing and is not system specific .",
    "as far as the qhe goes one might argue that since the hall conductance can be directly related to a chern number @xcite , the genericity of small jumps follows immediately .",
    "the difficulty with this argument has to do with the thermodynamic limit .",
    "normally , the qhe is associated with large systems .",
    "the genericity result quoted above for chern numbers is for operators with discrete spectrum .",
    "this is the case for finite sytems , but is in general not the case for extended systems , and in particular does not apply to models of the quantum hall effect .",
    "the main attractive feature of the fredholm approach to the hall effect is that it is phrased directly in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "another way of phrasing the main theme of this paper is : what , if any , is the analog for fredholm operators of the genericity of small jumps in chern numbers ?",
    "we wish to interpolate between two ( or more ) fredholm operators . if the indices of these operators are different this can not be done within the space of fredholm operators . at some points in the interpolation",
    "the fredholm property will be lost and the index will be ill defined . for `` generic '' interpolations , what is the nature of this bad set ?",
    "near such a bad point , how big a range of indices can be found ?",
    "working in the space of bounded operators , little can be said .",
    "the space is simply too large , and when the fredholm property is lost we lose all analytic control .",
    "however , in the space of sufficiently smooth toeplitz operators interesting results can be obtained . in systems without symmetry , we find the following behavior : almost every operator is fredholm , and sets of codimension @xmath11 appear as boundaries between regions of fredholm operators whose indices differ by @xmath11 .",
    "we speak simply of the index `` jumping by @xmath11 '' on a set of codimension @xmath11 .    in systems with a @xmath12 symmetry ( e.g. time reversal symmetry or complex conjugation symmetry ) , sets of codimension @xmath11 appear as common boundaries of regions of fredholm operators whose",
    "indices differ by as much as @xmath13 .",
    "that is , the index can jump by as much as @xmath13 on a set of codimension @xmath11 .",
    "we review here the basic definitions and properties of fredholm operators on separable hilbert spaces . for a more complete treatment see @xcite .    a bounded operator @xmath14 on a separable hilbert space if _ fredholm _ if there exists another bounded operator @xmath15 such that @xmath16 and @xmath17 are compact .",
    "in particular , the kernel and cokernel of @xmath14 are finite dimensional , and we define    the _ index _ of a fredholm operator @xmath18 is index(f)= dim ker(f)- dimker(f^ ) .",
    "fredholm operators are stable under compact perturbations and under small bounded perturbations . that is , if @xmath14 is fredholm , there exists an @xmath19 such that , for any bounded operator @xmath15 with operator norm @xmath20 and for any compact operator @xmath21 , the operator @xmath22 is fredholm with the same index as @xmath14 .",
    "the simplest example of a fredholm operator with nonzero index is the shift operator .",
    "let @xmath23 be an orthonormal basis for a hilbert space , and let the operator @xmath24 act by a(e_n ) = .",
    "the adjoint of @xmath24 acts by a^(e_n ) = e_n+1 since @xmath25 is the identity , @xmath24 is fredholm .",
    "the kernel of @xmath24 is 1-dimensional .",
    "the cokernel of @xmath24 , which is the same as the kernel of @xmath26 , is 0 dimensional .",
    "thus the index of @xmath24 is 1 .",
    "similarly , @xmath26 is fredholm with index @xmath27 .",
    "the following theorem is standard :    if @xmath28 are fredholm operators , then the product @xmath29 is also fredholm , and @xmath30 .",
    "finally we consider connectedness in the space of fredholm operators .",
    "if @xmath14 and @xmath31 are fredholm operators on the same hilbert space , then there is a continuous path of fredholm operators from @xmath14 to @xmath31 if and only if @xmath32 .",
    "( by continuous , we mean relative to the operator norm ) . put another way , the path components of @xmath33 , the space of fredholm operators on @xmath34 , is indexed ( pun intended ) by the integers .",
    "the @xmath11-th path component is precisely the set of fredholm operators of index @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the most natural setting for our problem is consider arbitrary bounded operators , with the topology defined by the operator norm .",
    "we ask how many parameters must be varied in order to reach the common boundary of two regions , whose indices differ by @xmath35 . unfortunately , the answer is independent of @xmath35 :    let @xmath36 be the set of fredholm operators of index @xmath11 .",
    "every point on the boundary of @xmath36 is also on the boundary of @xmath37 , for every integer @xmath38 .",
    "proof : let @xmath14 be a ( not fredholm ) operator on the boundary of @xmath36 . given @xmath19",
    ", we must find an operator in @xmath37 within a distance @xmath39 of @xmath14 .",
    "suppose that the kernel and cokernel of @xmath14 are infinite dimensional , and that there is a gap in the spectrum of @xmath40 at zero .",
    "( if this is not the case , we may perturb @xmath14 by an arbitrarily small amount to make it so ) .",
    "now let @xmath15 be a unitary map from the kernel of @xmath14 to the cokernel .",
    "let @xmath41 be the orthogonal projection onto @xmath42 , and let @xmath24 be a shift operator on @xmath43 .",
    "for each @xmath44 , @xmath45 has a bounded right inverse a^ p_+ 1 ( a^)^m b^p. it follows that the cokernel of @xmath46 is empty .",
    "it is easy to see that the kernel of @xmath46 is @xmath38 dimensional hence @xmath47 .",
    "similarly , @xmath48 has index @xmath49 .",
    "@xmath50    this theorem tells us that , in the space of all bounded operators there is no specific notion of being at a transition point from index @xmath11 to index @xmath38 .",
    "as long as an operator stays fredholm , its index can not change , and when it fails to be fredholm it can change into anything .    to achieve useful results , we must work on a smaller space .",
    "in this section and the next we show that  generic \" behavior is indeed achieved in some finite dimensional spaces , and in some infinite - dimensional spaces with sufficiently fine topologies .",
    "we see also how control is lost as the space is enlarged and the topology is coarsened .",
    "we begin by considering linear combinations of the shift operator @xmath24 and the identity operator 1 .",
    "that is , we consider the operator @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are constants .    [ 0 - 1 ] if @xmath54 , then @xmath14 is fredholm .",
    "the index of @xmath14 is 1 if @xmath55 and zero if @xmath56 . if @xmath57 , then @xmath14 is not fredholm .",
    "proof : first suppose @xmath58",
    ". then @xmath14 is invertible : @xmath59 as the sum converges absolutely .",
    "thus @xmath14 has neither kernel nor cokernel , and has index zero .    if @xmath60 , then the kernel of @xmath14 is 1-dimensional , namely all multiples of @xmath61 , where @xmath62 . notice how the norm of @xmath63 goes to infinity as @xmath64 .",
    "however , @xmath65 has no kernel , since for any unit vector @xmath66 , @xmath67 .",
    "thus the index of @xmath14 is 1 .",
    "if @xmath68 , then @xmath14 is at the boundary between index 1 and index 0 , and so can not be fredholm.@xmath50      next we consider linear combinations of @xmath69 up to some fixed @xmath70 . that is , we consider operators of the form a = c_n a^n + c_n-1 a^n-1 + + c_0 .",
    "[ a ] this is closely related to the polynomial p(z ) = c_n z^n + + c_0 .",
    "[ p ]    if none of the roots of @xmath71 lie on the unit circle , then @xmath14 is fredholm , and the index of @xmath14 equals the number of roots of @xmath71 _ inside _ the unit circle , counted with multiplicity . if any of the roots of @xmath71 lie _ on _ the unit circle , then @xmath14 is not fredholm .",
    "proof : the polynomial @xmath72 factorizes as @xmath73 , where @xmath35 is the degree of @xmath71 ( typically @xmath74 , but it may happen that @xmath75 ) .",
    "but then @xmath76 . if none of the roots @xmath77 lie on the unit circle , then each term in the product is fredholm , so the product is fredholm , and the index of the product is the sum of the indices of the factors . by theorem [ 0 - 1 ] , this exactly equals the number of roots @xmath77 inside the unit circle .",
    "if any of the roots lie on the unit circle , then a small perturbation can push those roots in or out , yielding fredholm operators with different indices .",
    "this borderline operator therefore can not be fredholm.@xmath50    the last theorem easily generalizes to linear combination of left - shifts and right - shifts .",
    "the index of an operator a = c_n a^n + + c_1 a + c_0 + c_-1 a^+ + c_-m ( a^)^m equals the number of roots of p(z ) = _ i =- m^n c_i z^i inside the unit circle , minus the degree of the pole at @xmath78 ( that is @xmath38 , unless @xmath79 ) .",
    "this follow from the fact that a = ( _ i =- m^n c_i a^i+m ) ( a^)^m .",
    "since there is no qualitative difference between combinations of left - shifts and combinations of both left- and right - shifts , we restrict our attention to left - shifts only , and consider families of operators of the form ( [ a ] ) .    [ finite - combinations ] in the space of complex linear combinations of 1 , @xmath24 ,  , @xmath70 , almost every operator is fredholm . for every @xmath80 ,",
    "the points where the index can jump by @xmath35 ( by which we mean the common boundaries of regions of fredholm operators whose indices differ by @xmath35 ) is a set of real codimension @xmath35 .    in the space of real linear combinations of 1 , @xmath24 ,  , @xmath70 , almost every operator is fredholm . for every @xmath80 ,",
    "the points where the index jumps by @xmath35 is a stratified space , the largest stratum of which has real codimension @xmath81 , where @xmath82 denotes the integer part of @xmath83 .",
    "proof : our parameter space is the space of coefficients @xmath84 , or equivalently the space of polynomials of degree @xmath85 .",
    "this is either @xmath86 or @xmath87 , depending on whether we allow real or complex coefficients . in either case ,",
    "the set @xmath88 of fredholm operators of index @xmath35 is identical to the set of polynomials with @xmath35 roots inside the unit circle and the remaining @xmath89 roots outside ( if @xmath75 , we say there is a root at infinity ; if @xmath90 , there is a double root at infinity , and so on . counting these roots at infinity , there are always exactly @xmath11 roots in all . ) the boundary of @xmath88 is the set of polynomials with at most @xmath35 roots inside the unit circle , at most @xmath89 outside the unit circle , and at least one root on the unit circle .",
    "( strictly speaking , the zero polynomial is also on this boundary .",
    "this is of such high codimension that it has no effect on the phase portrait we are developing . ) .",
    "we consider the common boundary of @xmath88 and @xmath91 . if @xmath92 , a nonvanishing polynomial is on the boundary of both @xmath88 and @xmath91 if it has at most @xmath35 roots inside the unit circle and at most @xmath93 roots outside .",
    "it must therefore have at least @xmath94 roots on the unit circle .",
    "if we are working with complex coefficients , this is a set of codimension @xmath94 .",
    "the roots themselves , together with an overall scale @xmath95 , can be used to parametrize the space of polynomials . for each root , being on the unit circle is codimension 1 , while being inside or outside are open conditions .",
    "since the roots are independent , placing @xmath94 roots on the unit circle is codimension @xmath94 .",
    "if we are working with real coefficients , the roots are not independent , as non - real roots come in complex conjugate pairs .",
    "thus , the common boundary of @xmath88 and @xmath91 breaks into several strata , depending on how many real roots and how many complex conjugate pairs lie on the unit circle .",
    "if @xmath94 is even , the biggest stratum consists of having @xmath96 pairs , and has codimension @xmath96 .",
    "if @xmath94 is odd , the biggest stratum consists of having @xmath97 pairs and one real root on the unit circle , and has codimension @xmath98 .",
    "-1 in    -1.3in=3.0truein    theorem [ finite - combinations ] is illustrated in figure  1 , where the phase portrait is shown for @xmath99 with real coefficients , with @xmath100 fixed to equal 1 .",
    "the points above the parabola @xmath101 have complex conjugate roots , while points below have real roots .",
    "notice that the transition from index 2 to index 0 occurs at an isolated point when the roots are real , but on an interval when the roots come in complex - conjugate pairs .",
    "it is clear that an almost identical theorem applies to linear combinations of left - shifts up to @xmath70 and right - shifts up to @xmath102 .",
    "the results are essentially independent of @xmath11 and @xmath38 ( their only effect being to limit the size of possible jumps to @xmath103 ) .",
    "we can therefore extend the results to the space of all ( finite ) linear combinations of left- and right - shifts , which is topologized as the union over all @xmath11 and @xmath38 of the spaces considered above .",
    "our result , restated for that space , is    [ limit - space ] in the space of finite complex linear combinations of left- and right - shifts of arbitrary degree , almost every operator is fredholm . for every integer @xmath104 ,",
    "the points where the index can jump by @xmath35 ( by which we mean the common boundaries of regions of fredholm operators whose indices differ by @xmath35 ) is a set of real codimension @xmath35 .",
    "if we restrict the coefficients to be real , then , for every @xmath80 , the points where the index jumps by @xmath35 is a stratified space , the largest stratum of which has real codimension @xmath81 .",
    "although theorem [ limit - space ] refers to an infinite - dimensional space , this space is still extremely small  each point is a _",

    "notice that t_e_m e_n = so @xmath118 is simply a shift by @xmath38 , a right shift if @xmath119 and a left - shift if @xmath120 .",
    "all our results about shifts can therefore be understood in the context of toeplitz operators .",
    "theorem [ finite - combinations ] refers to operators @xmath116 , where @xmath117 is a polynomial in @xmath121 of limited degree .",
    "theorem [ limit - space ] considers polynomials or arbitrary degree in @xmath122 and @xmath121 .",
    "we will see that the results carry over to analytic functions on an annulus around @xmath110 , and to a lesser extent to @xmath123 toeplitz operators , but with results that weaken as @xmath35 is decreased .    here",
    "are some standard results about toeplitz operators . for details , see @xcite .",
    "a @xmath124 toeplitz operator @xmath116 is fredholm if and only if @xmath117 is everywhere nonzero on the unit circle . in that case",
    "the index of @xmath116 is minus the winding number of @xmath117 around the origin , namely index(t_f ) = -winding(f ) = -12 i _",
    "s^1 df f , [ wind ]    given the first half of the theorem , the equality of index and winding number is easy to understand .",
    "we simply deform @xmath117 to a function of the form @xmath125 , while keeping @xmath117 nonzero on all of @xmath110 throughout the deformation ( this is always possible , see e.g. @xcite ) . in the process of deformation , neither the index of @xmath116 nor the winding number of @xmath117 can change , as they are topological invariants . since the winding number of @xmath126 is @xmath11 , and since @xmath127 ( if @xmath128 , @xmath129 otherwise ) , which has index @xmath130 , the result follows .",
    "we now consider functions @xmath117 on @xmath110 that can be analytically continued ( without singularities ) an annulus @xmath131 , where the radii @xmath132 and @xmath133 are fixed .",

    "this norm is stronger than any sobolev norm on the circle itself .",
    "the analysis of the corresponding toeplitz operators is straightforward and similar to the proof of theorem [ finite - combinations ]",
    ". since @xmath117 has no poles in the annulus , we just have to keep track of the zeroes of @xmath117 . for the index of @xmath116 to change",
    ", a zero of @xmath117 must cross the unit circle . for the index to jump from @xmath35 to @xmath135",
    ", @xmath136 zeroes must cross simultaneously . in the absence of symmetry ,",
    "the locations of the zeroes are independent and can be freely varied , so this is a codimension-@xmath136 event .",
    "if we impose a reality condition : @xmath137 , then zeroes appear only on the real axis or in complex conjugate pairs . in that case , changing the index by 2 is merely a codimension-1 event . combining these observations",

    "if we impose a reality condition @xmath138 then , for every @xmath80 , the points where the index jumps by @xmath35 is a stratified space , the largest stratum of which has real codimension @xmath81 .",
    "finally we consider toeplitz operators that are not necessarily analytic , but are merely @xmath139 times differentiable , and we use the @xmath140 norm .",
    "our result is    [ c^ell ] in the space of toeplitz @xmath140 operators , almost every operator is fredholm . for every integer @xmath35 with @xmath141 , the points where the index can jump by @xmath35 is a set of real codimension @xmath35 . for every integer @xmath142 ,",
    "the points where the index can jump by @xmath35 is a set of real codimension @xmath143 .    in other words ,",
    "our familiar results hold up to codimension @xmath143 , at which point we lose all control of the change in index .",
    "proof : as long as @xmath117 is everywhere nonzero , @xmath116 is fredholm . to get a change in index , therefore , we need one or more points where @xmath117 , and possibly some derivatives of @xmath117 with respect to @xmath144 , vanish .",
    "suppose then that for some angle @xmath145 , @xmath146 for some @xmath147 , but that the @xmath11-th derivative @xmath148 .",
    "this is a codimension @xmath149 event , since we are setting the real and imaginary parts of @xmath11 variables to zero , but have a 1-parameter choice of points where this can occur . without loss of generality",
    ", we suppose that this @xmath11-th derivative is real and positive . by making a @xmath140-small perturbation of @xmath117",
    ", we can make the value of @xmath117 highly oscillatory near @xmath145 , thereby wrapping around the origin a number of times .",
    "however , since a @xmath140-small perturbation does not change the @xmath11-th derivative by much , the sign of the real part of @xmath117 can change at most @xmath11 times near @xmath145 , so the argument of @xmath117 can only increase or decrease by @xmath150 or less .",
    "the difference between these two extremes is @xmath151 , or a change in winding number of @xmath11 .    to change the index by an integer @xmath38 , therefore",
    ", we must have the function vanish to various orders at several points , with the sum of the orders of vanishing adding to @xmath38 .",
    "the generic event is for @xmath117 ( but not @xmath152 ) to vanish at @xmath38 different points  this is a codimension @xmath38 event , analagous to having @xmath38 zeroes of a polynomial cross the unit circle simultaneously at @xmath38 different points .",
    "all other scenarios have higher codimension and are analogous to having 2 or more zeroes of the @xmath38 zeroes crossing the unit circle at the same point .",
    "the situation is different , however , when the function @xmath117 and the first @xmath139 derivatives all vanish at a point @xmath145 .",
    "then the higher - order derivatives are not protected from @xmath140-small perturbations and , by making such a perturbation , we can change @xmath117 into a function that is identically zero on a small neighborhood of @xmath153 . by making a further small perturbation , we can make @xmath117 wrap around the origin as many times as we like near @xmath153 . more specifically ,",
    "if @xmath117 is zero on an interval of size @xmath154 , then , for small @xmath39 , @xmath155 will wrap around the origin approximately @xmath156 times near @xmath145 . by picking @xmath157 as large ( positive or negative ) as we wish",
    ", we can obtain arbitrarily positive or negative indices . as long",
    "as we take @xmath158 , this perturbation will remain small in the @xmath140 norm .",
    "we have seen in the previous section that the fredholm index of a generic one dimensional family of toeplitz operators is a step function with small jumps .",
    "this is reminiscent of what one observes for the hall conductance for random schrdinger operators .    in this section",
    "we want to discuss some of the difficulties , and what one would still need to know , for the strategy in this paper to yield useful results for the qhe .",
    "the hall conductance is related to the index of @xmath0 ( on @xmath159 ) with @xmath1 a spectral projection in @xmath160 and @xmath5 a multiplication by @xmath6 .",
    "this operator is closely related to a toeplitz operator in the case of a basic paradigm for the hall effect :    let @xmath1 be a projection on the lowest landau level in @xmath161 , then @xmath0 differs from a toeplitz operator by a compact operator .    proof : a basis for the lowest landau level is |n=1 z^ne^-|z|^2/2,n0 . as a consequence n|u|m=_n , m+1 ( m+1/2)!m!_n , m+1(1 - 18 m ) .",
    "the same result also holds if @xmath1 is a projection on a higher landau level , but the calculation is more involved . if @xmath1 is a projection onto multiple landau levels , then @xmath0 is a compact perturbation of a direct sum of toeplitz operators , one for each landau level .",
    "this suggests that the class of toeplitz operators is indeed related to the qhe .    for ( spinless ) electrons / holes on the euclidean and hyperbolic planes , with homogeneous magnetic field , and without disorder , @xmath162 has been explicitly computed as a function of the `` fermi energy '' @xmath4 . in the euclidean plane",
    "one finds a monotonic step function with jumps @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "( one needs both signs for electrons and holes . )",
    "the same results apply in the hyperbolic plane for all energies below the continuous spectrum @xcite .",
    "this implies that also for ( relatively ) compact perturbations of these hamiltonians the fredholm index in the qhe behaves as does the fredholm index of toeplitz operators .",
    "the situation is , however , quite different for schrdinger operators with periodic potentials where @xmath163 failes to be fredholm on intervals of  energy bands \" and where the fredholm index in adjacent gaps can jump by large integers @xcite .      for applications to the hall effect one considers @xmath0 ( on the range of @xmath1 ) where the projection @xmath1 depends on a parameter such as the fermi energy or the external magnetic field .",
    "the family @xmath0 is therefore defined on different spaces , since the range of @xmath1 is not fixed .",
    "our strategy , so far , has been to study a family of operators on a _ fixed _ hilbert space .",
    "to adapt the qhe to this strategy one must replace @xmath0 by something like c = pup+1-p , [ c ] acting on the full hilbert space , as @xmath164 on the full space coincides with @xmath165 on @xmath166 .",
    "now , a deformation of @xmath1 leads to a deformation of @xmath167 and gives a family of bounded operators on a fixed space , say , @xmath160 .",
    "however , this modification is not without a price since now , even for the simple case of a full landau level , @xmath167 is not strictly a toeplitz operator .",
    "it is a rather silly generalization of a toeplitz operator to a direct sum of a toeplitz operator and the identity .",
    "a more serious problem has to do with what should one pick as a good family @xmath1 .",
    "in particular , when one considers a variation of the fermi energy @xmath4 the corresponding projection @xmath168 is not continuous in the operator norm .",
    "hence , a smooth variation of @xmath4 is not even a smooth variation of @xmath167 in the operator norm ( much less in the sharper norms considered above ) .",
    "using the fact that the fredholm index does not change under small changes in the norm of the operator , there is no harm done if one replaces the spectral projection @xmath168 by the fermi function p_(e)= 1(h - e)+1 , for @xmath169 large . unlike @xmath168",
    ", @xmath170 is a smooth function of @xmath4 , and so the family @xmath171 is smooth .",
    "the price one pays is that @xmath170 is not a projection , which leads to ambiguities as to what one might want to choose for @xmath171 . for example , instead of ( [ c ] ) one might choose c_(e)=p_(e)up_(e)+(1-p_^2(e ) ) .",
    "the trouble is that it is not clear what , if anything , the results about families of toeplitz operators imply for the family @xmath171 .",
    "we therefore pose the following questions :    for random scrdinegr operators on the plane , with @xmath169 sufficiently large , what are the properties of the family of operators @xmath171 ?",
    "is it fredholm away from a discrete set of energies @xmath4 , or does it fail to be fredholm on bigger sets ?",
    "if it fails to be fredholm at isolated points , are the jumps generically small ?",
