    "over the course of its four - year primary mission , nasa s _ kepler _ spacecraft provided photometric measurements of over 150,000 stars , sampled typically every 30 minutes .",
    "a number of the resulting high - precision lightcurves exhibit unusual variability patterns , which can generally be explained as the result of analysis artifacts or by known astrophysical mechanisms .",
    "@xcite recently provided an in - depth study of kic  8462852 ( tyc  3162 - 665 - 1 ) , a star whose lightcurve was flagged as unusual by members of the zooniverse citizen science planet hunters project @xcite .",
    "they identify the star as a main sequence f3 v / iv star , and describe unique , aperiodic dips in the stellar flux of up to 20% , lasting for between 5 and 80 days .",
    "archival photographic plates also show unprecedented century - long dimming , at an average rate of @xmath1 magnitudes per century @xcite .",
    "one possible explanation is that the observations may be explained by the passage of a family of exocomet fragments resulting from a single break - up event @xcite .",
    "@xcite offer an alternative `` extraordinary hypothesis '' that the lightcurve is consistent with the existence of a collection of planet - sized structures , or swarms of many smaller objects , placed in orbit by an extraterrestrial civilization .",
    "they describe kic  8462852 as an outstanding target for seti ( search for extraterrestrial intelligence ) obsdervations .",
    "radio frequency observations between 1 and 10 ghz using the allen telescope array from 15 october to 30 october , 2015 , for approximately 12 hours each day , did not find any evidence of a signal @xcite .",
    "astronomical seti observations are most commonly conducted at radio frequencies , close to the @xmath2 hydrogen line .",
    "however , @xcite noted over half a century ago that optical light sources are also effective beacons , detectable over interstellar distances . one promising method is to search for intense pulses of optical or near - infrared photons from candidate star systems :",
    "@xcite have calculated that , using current technology ( 10 m reflectors as the transmitting and receiving apertures and a @xmath3 pulsed laser source ) , a @xmath4 optical pulse could be produced that would be easily detectable at a distance of @xmath5 , outshining starlight from the host system by a factor of @xmath6 .",
    "a number of dedicated searches for such signals have been conducted or are under development ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite performed a search for periodic optical pulses from kic  8462852 between october 29 and november 9 , 2015 , using the @xmath7 telescope of the boquete optical seti observatory , with null results .",
    "alternative approaches to optical seti include searching for the spectral signatures of laser emission either in the form of extremely narrow emission lines @xcite or as periodic signatures in the spectra @xcite .",
    "the detection of nanosecond optical pulses from the night sky requires large - aperture mirrors instrumented with fast photon detectors .",
    "ground - based gamma - ray telescopes have identical requirements and can be used to search for seti - like signals @xcite .",
    "the requirement for coincident signals between multiple independent telescopes , combined with the ability to form a crude image of the light flash , allows imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes ( iacts ) to perform such searches parasitically during regular observations , with effectively no background .",
    "we report here on the results of observations of kic  8462852 , recorded serendipitously by the veritas gamma - ray observatory .",
    "veritas @xcite is an array of four iacts located at the fred lawrence whipple observatory in southern arizona ( fig .  [ array ] ) .",
    "the telescope optics follow a davies - cotton design @xcite , with a @xmath8 aperture reflector and a @xmath8 focal length .",
    "the reflector comprises @xmath9 hexagonal mirror facets , giving a total mirror area of @xmath10 .",
    "the telescopes are mounted on steerable alt - azimuth positioners , and are arranged in an approximate diamond formation with sides of roughly @xmath11 length . at the focus of each telescope is a close - packed array of 499 photomultiplier tubes ( pmts ; fig .",
    "[ array ] ) .",
    "the pmt angular spacing is @xmath12 , giving a roughly circular field - of - view for each telescope of diameter @xmath13 .",
    "dead space between the pmts is removed by the addition of reflecting hybrid - winston cones to the pmt front faces , with a hexagonal shape at the entrance and a circular exit window @xcite . the photodetectors ( initially photonis xp2970 pmts , upgraded to hamamatsu r10560 super bialkali pmts in 2012 ) are sensitive throughout the visible wavelength range , with a peak detection efficiency around @xmath14 .",
    "ground - based gamma - ray astronomy is an indirect technique , which works by forming an image of cascades of relativistic particles in the earth s atmosphere ( `` air showers '' ) using the few - ns pulse of optical cherenkov light that they generate .",
    "the telescopes therefore do not integrate light continuously ; rather , the pmt signals are split , with one copy passed to a fast multi - level trigger system .",
    "a telescope trigger is generated when the signals in at least three adjacent pmts cross a discriminator threshold within approximately @xmath15 .",
    "an array trigger is generated when at least two of the four telescopes trigger within a coincidence window of @xmath16 .",
    "on receipt of a successful array trigger , all of the pmt signals are read out using flash analog - digital converters ( fadcs ) which sample the signal every @xmath17 .",
    "the trigger rate is typically a few hundred hz , almost all of which is due to cosmic ray initiated particle cascades .",
    "the veritas telescope design is described in more detail in @xcite , and the iact technique is summarized in @xcite .",

    "the standard observing mode consists of an exposure of @xmath18 , with the target offset from the center of the field - of - view by @xmath19 , sequentially towards the north , south , east and west .",
    "the telescope positioning is accurate to a few arcminutes , and offline corrections using ccd star trackers determine individual telescope pointing directions to better than @xmath20 .    given the wide field - of - view of the instrument , it is common for interesting targets to be observed serendipitously .",

    "these criteria alone are sufficient to remove essentially all of the background cosmic ray events from the analysis .",
    "cosmic ray air showers produce the majority of their cherenkov light below an altitude of @xmath57 , and so the images recorded in detectors separated by @xmath11 show significant parallactic displacement ( @xmath58 ) .",

    "cosmic ray showers develop and grow longitudinally in the atmosphere , producing cherenkov light over a typical length of several kilometers and resulting in an image with a large angular extent ( fig .",

    "[ cosrays],title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ]    one concern is whether such images would successfully trigger the telescope readout , which requires at least three adjacent pmts in each telescope camera to have signals exceeding their discriminator thresholds .",
    "the optical point spread function ( psf ) at the center of the field - of - view has a typical full width at half maximum of @xmath59 ( or @xmath60 at the 68% containment radius ) , with almost all of the light in the image of a point source contained within the diameter of a single pmt ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "however , as a natural result of the alt - azimuth design of the telescopes , a celestial source moves across the field - of - view and spends a reasonable fraction of time at the interface between two or three pmt pixels .",
    "furthermore , the optical psf degrades significantly off the optical axis , blurring and distorting the image of a point source more widely near the outer edge of the camera ( by approximately 50% at @xmath61 off - axis ) .",
    "this increases the probability that a point - like image will generate a trigger .",
    "the temporal characteristics of the light pulse also play an important role in determining the trigger efficiency .",
    "the pmt signal path is ac - coupled in the telescope camera prior to pre - amplification , with a lower cut - off frequency of approximately @xmath62 . a steady , or slowly varying ,",
    "signal will not generate a trigger .",
    "there is a caveat to this , in that a steady optical source such as a bright star in the field - of - view will generate high frequency poisson noise fluctuations in the pmt signals , increasing the probability of accidentally crossing the discriminator thresholds .",
    "kic  8462852 itself has a v - band magnitude of 12.01 @xcite , which is too faint to produce any measurable increase in the noise fluctuations of the pmt signal .",
    "an optical pulse with a duration much longer than the ac - coupling time constant , but with a risetime significantly less than @xmath63 , will also trigger the cameras .    based on these criteria , we have processed all of the data to search for optical pulses associated with kic  8462852 . for every recorded event we have applied selection cuts based on the recorded images .",
    "we retained events in which all images had ellipse _",
    "lengths _ and _ widths _ less than @xmath64 , equivalent to the _ length _ of an image with three aligned pmts each containing exactly the same signal intensity .",
    "we also require that at least three telescopes record an image , and that no two image centroid locations within the same event are separated by more than @xmath12 , equivalent to the spacing between adjacent pmts .",
    "inspection of the surviving events reveals that the majority resemble faint cosmic ray events , or noise fluctuations , typically with low intensity images .",
    "a four - telescope image multiplicity requirement , or a minimum image intensity cut , efficiently removes these .",
    "these additional criteria , together with a requirement for uniform intensity across all images , could be be applied in future analyses requiring stricter background rejection , such as searches without a predefined source candidate location .",
    "interestingly , some point - like optical pulse candidates are observed . in particular , during a 15-minute exposure on 2015",
    "september 18 ( mjd 57283 ) , two different classes of point source optical pulses are detected .",
    "one of these consists of around 300 consecutive events , which move in a straight line across the field - of - view , crossing @xmath65 in 0.11 seconds .",
    "the images are not co - located in the field - of - view , displaying a maximum parallactic displacement of @xmath66 , observed between two telescopes separated by @xmath67 .",
    "this implies an altitude of emission of @xmath68 and a velocity of roughly @xmath69 , consistent with the typical properties of the light from a meteoroid passing through the earth s thermosphere .",
    "we note that the precursor to veritas , the original whipple @xmath70 gamma - ray telescope , was used to provide the first optical observations of meteors down to a limiting photographic magnitude of + 12 in the 1970s @xcite .",
    "another class of optical pulses , an example of which is seen in the same exposure , are more difficult to explain . these consist of eight events , recorded with the telescopes pointing towards @xmath71 azimuth and @xmath72 elevation .",
    "the events again move in a straight line across the field - of - view , crossing @xmath73 in 28.9 seconds , from 04:33:01  04:33:30 ut ( fig .  [ track ] ) .",
    "there is no measurable parallactic displacement in this case , implying an altitude of at least @xmath74 .",
    "the pulse duration is longer than the fadc read - out window length of @xmath75 .",
    "we consider that the most likely explanation is that these events are due to light reflected from a satellite ; the measured angular velocity ( @xmath76 ) is consistent with an object in orbit at an altitude of a few thousand kilometers .",
    "events such as these , which form tracks , are easily distinguished from a true celestial source , simply by their motion across the field - of - view . they also serve as a useful proof of principle , demonstrating that the array does trigger on point - like optical sources at large distance , and highlighting the advantages of a widely separated telescope array with imaging capabilities and a large field - of - view in avoiding misclassification .    after applying the selection cuts , and removing any event sequences which form tracks in the cameras , only 28 of the initial 7036970 events remain  1 in every 251320 events .",
    "none of these have images consistent with the location of kic  8462852 .",
    "we conclude that there is no evidence in the veritas observations for optical pulses originating from this system .",
    "@xcite have already outlined the difficulty in forming meaningful constraints from optical seti observations . in particular , aside from the very obvious reasons for the lack of a detection ( i.e. there is very likely no extraterrestrial civilization at kic  8462852 directing laser pulses towards us ) the potentially transient nature of any signal implies that the same observations could be performed at a different time , with a different result .",
    "nevertheless , with nine hours of observations distributed over six years , the veritas archive represents a unique dataset .",
    "an exact estimate of the sensitivity of the search is also difficult , since the minimum detectable optical pulse intensity depends strongly upon the emission wavelength , the duration and temporal profile of the pulse , and the exact source location within the field - of - view when the pulse occurs  all of which are unknown .",
    "taking representative values ( 20% photon detection efficiency , 85% mirror reflectivity , and a conservative minimum image intensity of 100 digital counts , corresponding to 18.8 photo - electrons ) gives a minimum optical pulse intensity of @xmath77 arriving at the telescope within the @xmath78 pulse integration window used for this analysis .",
    "the required energy of the transmitted pulse , estimated using the method of @xcite , is @xmath79 , or roughly equivalent to a @xmath80band 6.4 mag star , but with just a few nanoseconds duration .",
    "this compares favorably with earlier searches with optical telescopes , which have sensitivities of typically @xmath81 , and with observations by the stacee heliostat array telescope , which provided a sensitivity of @xmath82 @xcite .",
    "the recent optical seti observations of kic  8462852 by @xcite report a sensitivity to periodic signals of @xmath83 .",
    "we can also estimate the wavelength dependence of the sensitivity , taking into account the effects of interstellar absorption , transmission through the earth s atmosphere , the reflectivity of the telescope mirrors and the quantum efficiency of the photo - detectors .",
    "@xcite calculate a distance to kic  8462852 of @xmath84 , based upon the interstellar reddening of the spectral energy distribution ( @xmath85 ) , which corresponds to a @xmath86-band extinction of @xmath87 , or a transmission efficiency of 73% .",
    "we normalize wavelength - dependent extinction values @xcite to this measurement , as shown in figure  [ efficiency ] .",
    "the overall wavelength dependence of the sensitivity is given by the `` total '' curve .",
    "perhaps the most important conclusion of this work is that modern iact arrays are effective tools to search for faint optical transients , with durations as brief as a few nanoseconds .",
    "the observations are complementary to , and have no impact on , the scientific program in the gamma - ray domain .",
    "any artificial backgrounds can be easily removed , using the simple analysis procedures outlined here .",
    "the search for short duration optical transients was highlighted as a fruitful area of research almost half a century ago ( e.g. @xcite and @xcite ) and has developed into an important field of astronomy over the past decade , with many different scientific goals ( e.g. @xcite lists gravitational microlensing , asteroid detection , stellar variability , extragalactic transients and cosmology using supernovae ) .",
    "dedicated robotic arrays of astrographs , or reflecting telescopes with schmidt optics , monitor the skies nightly to explore the time domain ( e.g. the catalina real - time transient survey , the hungarian automated telescope network , the palomar transient factory , etc . ) while , in the near future , the large synoptic survey telescope will map the entire visible sky every few nights with pairs of @xmath88 exposures , separated by 15  @xmath89 and reaching a @xmath90 sensitivity limit of @xmath91 @xcite . extending this search to nanosecond timescales opens up a new area of parameter space .",
    "while short - duration gamma - ray bursts have now been studied for decades , the surprising recent discovery of millisecond - timescale fast radio bursts @xcite , and nanosecond radio pulses from the crab pulsar @xcite demonstrates that such rapid phenomena may exist elsewhere in the electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "further motivation is provided by @xcite , who has discovered evidence for rapid periodic modulations in the optical spectra of galaxies , while @xcite has noted the potential of iacts for rapid photometry of bright sources , particularly in the context of observing stellar occultations by small objects in the outer solar system .",
    "veritas has been operating since 2007 and records over @xmath92 of observations per year .",
    "together with the h.e.s.s .",
    "array in namibia and the magic system in la palma , approximately @xmath93 of archived iact data exist and a substantial fraction of the entire sky has been observed .",
    "a search of these archives for optical transients seems worthwhile . beyond the current generation of instruments",
    "lies the planned cherenkov telescope array ( cta ) , which will consist of northern and southern hemisphere telescope arrays on a much larger scale , totalling over 100 telescopes @xcite .",
    "cta will provide an enormous increase in mirror area and telescope multiplicity , with the potential to greatly enhance searches for optical transients .",
    "this additional application of the facility can inform design decisions regarding the telescope optics and trigger systems .",
