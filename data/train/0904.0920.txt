    "a major goal of a future international linear collider ( ilc ) is the precise measurement of the top - quark production cross section close to threshold .",
    "next to a precise extraction of the strong coupling , an unrivalled determination of the top - quark mass and its width is possible .",
    "this would open up a new chapter in the electroweak precision physics which leads to very strong checks of the standard model or possible extensions .",
    "the theoretical calculation of the threshold cross section is based on an effective theory  @xcite ( for a review see  @xcite ) which is constructed from qcd by integrating out the hard scale given by the top - quark mass .",
    "the connection between the two theories is established by so - called matching coefficients which constitute the coupling constants of the effective operators within nrqcd .",
    "a preliminary analysis to next - to - next - to - next - to leading order ( nnnlo ) of the top - quark threshold cross section , which is necessary in order to match the expected experimental precision  @xcite , has been performed in ref .",
    "@xcite . however , the three - loop static potential ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for the fermionic contribution ) and the three - loop matching coefficient beyond the light - fermion approximation  @xcite are still missing . in this paper",
    "we provide a further building block needed for the completion of the nnnlo calculation : the heavy - fermion contribution to the three - loop matching coefficient .",
    "next to important applications in the top - quark sector nrqcd is also an appropriate tool for the description of boundstate phenomena of charm and bottom quarks  @xcite .",
    "the matching coefficient of the vector current in the full and effective theory is defined through ( @xmath0 ) @xmath1 where the vector current in the full and effective theory reads @xmath2 @xmath3 denotes a generic heavy quark with mass @xmath4 and @xmath5 and @xmath6 are two - component pauli spinors for quark and anti - quark , respectively . in this paper we compute the three - loop non - singlet contribution to @xmath7 which contains one or two closed heavy quark loops .",
    "the analog corrections involving closed light ( massless ) quark loops have been considered in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the evaluation of the three - loop diagrams contributing to @xmath7 is quite involved .",
    "one has to consider vertex diagrams with massive quarks on their mass shell and the external momentum @xmath8 .",
    "this kinematical configuration in combination with an involved reduction to master integrals makes the calculation quite challenging . in this paper",
    "we discuss an automated setup which minimizes the manual interaction .",
    "even the results for the master integrals are obtained in an automated way .",
    "our approach for the automated calculation is introduced in the next section .",
    "afterwards we present the results for the matching coefficient in section  [ sec::match ] and conclude in section  [ sec::concl ] .",
    "when evaluating multi - loop feynman integrals one encounters several difficulties which have to be overcome . among them",
    "are the generation of the feynman diagrams , the reduction of the many integrals which appear at the initial stage of the calculation to a relatively small set of so - called master integrals and the evaluation of the latter",
    ". very often the individual steps are automated , however , the interplay between them is not . in the following",
    "we present a setup where various program packages are combined in order to minimize the manual work .",
    "the individual steps of our automated setup are as follows    1 .",
    "all feynman diagrams are generated with qgraf  @xcite which requires two input files : one specifying the process and one containing the propagators and vertices occurring in the theory .",
    "the output of qgraf is transformed to form  @xcite with the help of the program q2e",
    "q2e requires as input the form notation for the propagators and vertices and information about the hierarchy of the particle masses and the external momenta .",
    "the output of q2e is further processed with exp which identifies the various topologies and generates for each diagram a separate file containing complete information like the projectors to be applied , the expansion to be performed and the topology file to be called .",
    "4 .   in a next step the form part",
    "is initiated . after taking the traces and applying the projectors a topology - specific file",
    "is included which expresses the result in terms of a sum of scalar integrals .",
    "5 .   from the sum of all diagrams a list of integrals is extracted .",
    "this list serves as input for crusher  @xcite which produces for each topology a table containing the reduction to master integrals .",
    "each topology produces a certain number of master integrals .",
    "a small mathematica routine combines all master integrals , identifies identical ones and generates relations among them .",
    "the tables from step  5 together with the relations among master integrals ( step  6 ) are applied to the sum of the bare diagrams leading to a representation of the result in terms of a minimal set of master integrals multiplied with @xmath9-dependent coefficients .",
    "8 .   the input for crusher can also be used for fiesta  @xcite which we employ in order to obtain numerical results for the master integrals .",
    "9 .   at four places information about the topologies are needed : as input for exp ( cf .",
    "step  3 ) and crusher ( cf .",
    "step  5 ) , for the topology - specific form file ( cf .",
    "step  4 ) and for identifying identical master integrals ( cf .",
    "step  6 ) .",
    "this input is generated automatically from a file containing the definition of the three - loop topologies for the two - point on - shell integrals entering , e.g. , the @xmath10-on - shell relation of the quark mass  @xcite .",
    "this file is available from our previous calculation  @xcite .",
    "note that this is the only input which contains non - trivial problem - specific information ; the remaining input files ( see steps  1 and  2 ) are either quite generic ( e.g. identical for all qcd processes ) or quite simple to adapt like the specification of the process under consideration for qgraf .",
    "let us stress that the automated setup outlined above requires little interaction from outside and thus minimizes possible errors .",
    "many steps of the above list have been used extensively in previous calculations , however , the automatic calculation of the master integrals is new .",
    "such an approach is essential in those cases where many master integrals occur . in our calculation",
    "we encounter 24 master integrals for the contribution involving a closed heavy fermion loop .",
    "of course , a setup as described above requires several checks to be performed on the final result . on one hand",
    "they certainly include gauge parameter independence and the finiteness , on the other hand several checks on the numerical stability of our result are necessary . in our case",
    "the latter include the following :    * fiesta  @xcite , which is an efficient implementation of the sector decomposition method for the evaluation of master integrals , provides the possibility to introduce a lower cut - off in the numerical integration where numerical instabilities can occur .",
    "actually , for the evaluation of our master integrals we have to choose a non - zero cut - off .",
    "its variation provides an estimate of the uncertainty . *",
    "fiesta furthermore provides an uncertainty from the underlying monte - carlo integration performed with vegas  @xcite which we also take into account . * a further estimate of the uncertainty is provided by changing the basis used for the master integrals .",
    "the corresponding relations among the master integrals can be obtained in a straightforward way from the reduction tables generated by crusher . *",
    "some of the master integrals are known analytically and can thus be used to replace the corresponding numerical expressions .",
