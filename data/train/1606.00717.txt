    "peers are motivated to share the resources in a peer to peer network , if they get at least the amount of data , what they have uploaded to the network .",
    "most ideal situation is that , when upload and download amount for each peer is same .",
    "we call this , a fair situation in a peer to peer network",
    ". of course , there will be no free riders in this situation .",
    "therefore some mechanism is required to assure this . in this letter",
    ", we are proposing a simple mechanism called biased contribution index(bci ) .    to achieve the aforementioned state ,",
    "many incentive mechanisms have been studied @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . among these , global approaches @xcite , @xcite performed better compared to local approaches @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "in global approaches , shared history of peers in entire network is taken into consideration .",
    "it gives the wider view of peer s cooperation in the network .",
    "however , global approaches are not trivial to implement in the network . like in @xcite",
    ", each peer needs to keep the record of every transaction history , regardless of whether he was directly involved in them or not . in @xcite ,",
    "peer s contribution largely depends upon the contribution of peer with whom it is transacting so each peer needs to make some rough estimate of the impact on its contribution before each transaction .",
    "our approach is similar to @xcite , but equal importance is given to the actual contribution of peer and the contribution of peer with whom it is transacting .",
    "it is simpler to implement in the network due to its faster convergence . with the suitable numerical example we compared the convergence result of our approach with @xcite .",
    "we found that our approach performs far better in all the cases .",
    "rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ section1 ] presents the network model and introduction of biased contribution index .",
    "solution of biased contribution index is given in section [ solution ] .",
    "analysis of proposed algorithm is discussed in section [ analysis ] .",
    "section [ result ] shows the numerical results , and in section [ con ] , conclusion is presented .",
    "let there be @xmath0 peers in a peer to peer network .",
    "peers share their resources with each other and their contribution is calculated globally .",
    "a simple metric which can best reflect the contribution of the peers in the network , could be the ratio of its total upload to the network to the total download from the network .",
    "but to motivate the peers to upload more to the peers contributing more and to download more from the peers contributing less , we need to bias this ratio by some incentive factor .",
    "let this incentive factor be , @xmath1 , for peer @xmath2 . for peer @xmath2 , we define , the upload to download ratio(biased ratio)as @xmath3    here , @xmath4 is @xmath5 share matrix .",
    "its @xmath6 element represents the amount of resource shared by peer @xmath2 to peer @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath8 is the row vector with its @xmath9 entry as 1 and all other entries as zero .",
    "the @xmath10 is a vector containing incentive factors .",
    "let us define the incentive factor as a monotonically increasing function of biased ratio , i.e. @xmath11 @xmath12 we call this incentive factor as biased contribution index ( bci ) .    now to start the process of sharing we need to give some initial value of bci to all the peers .",
    "let us define a parameter @xmath13 to decide the initial value of bci .",
    "later we will see that the parameter @xmath14 is also related to the speed of convergence .",
    "the biased contribution index is modified to include this parameter @xmath14 , and is given by .",
    "@xmath15 here , @xmath16 is the initial value of biased contribution index , when neither upload nor download has happened at the node . in the network of @xmath0 nodes , there will be @xmath0 unknowns and @xmath0 nonlinear equations .",
    "we will see in the next section that , these equations can be solved by a suitable iterative function .",
    "peers are allowed to take the resources from network only if their biased contribution index is above a certain threshold value . therefore every peer will try to increase its biased contribution index , so that it can get the required amount of resources whenever needed .",
    "it can be observed easily from equation [ equ1 ] that a peer s biased contribution index will be higher if + 1 ) .",
    "its contribution @xmath17 is higher , + 2 ) .",
    "it shares more of its resources with higher contributing peer , and + 3 ) .",
    "it takes more of the services from lower contributing peer .",
    "+ therefore , intuitively we can say that this metric can assure fairness in the whole network .",
    "later in section [ analysis ] , we will give a mathematical justification for this .",
    "the bci of any peer is expressed in the terms of the bci of other peers . if @xmath18 , for @xmath19 , then for @xmath0 peers network , the equation [ equ1 ] , can be expressed in the form of matrix .",

    "initially every peer is allowed to take some resources from the network ; otherwise process of sharing will not start .",
    "hence , initial bci of @xmath16 for each peer is justified .",
    "but as soon as bci is updated , free rider s bci will reach at minimum level .",

    ". this will disqualify them from taking any resources from the network in future , until they acquire sufficient bci .",
    "the contributing peer will always gain the bci and resource taking peer will always loose the bci .",
    "hence , peers will always avoid reporting the false transaction and thus , collusion can be avoided in the network .",
    "we can observe the following from the above discussion .",
    "+ 1 ) if the biased contribution index of all peers are same , then the amount of resources contributed will be same as what is taken from the network for each peer .",
    "+ 2 ) if resources contributed and resources taken from the network in each peer are same , then the biased contribution index of all peers will be same .",
    "first point is evident from section [ solution ] .",
    "that is , if biased contribution index of all peers are same then it will be @xmath16 ( see lemma [ lemma2 ] ) . and",
    "if biased contribution index will be @xmath16 then @xmath108 for all @xmath2 ( from lemma [ lemma3 ] ) .",
    "hence @xmath109 @xmath110 hence total amount of resources contributed and taken from the network by each peer will be same .",
    "second point can be understood directly from lemma [ lemma4 ] .",
    "if resources contributed and taken from the network in each peer are same then @xmath111 hence @xmath92 and @xmath93 hence biased contribution index of all peers will be same .",
    "calculation of biased contribution index can be implemented in a distributed system following the same approach as in @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "multiple other peers named index managers , can be assigned to maintain the record of biased contribution index of any peer . whenever any peer needs the biased contribution index , of other peers it can send the query to the respective index managers .",
    "if there is any conflict about the biased contribution index of a peer , it can be settled , by majority of voting by index managers . in this way",
    "we can avoid the collusion among peers .",
    "for calculation of biased contribution index of any peer , index manager needs to know the contribution and resource taken by that peer and biased contribution index of peer with whom it is transacting .",
    "calculation is repeated till the convergence of biased contribution index is achieved . if number of iterations required to converge the algorithm are less , then required number of update messages will also be less .",
