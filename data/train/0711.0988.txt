    "astronomers have only started to appreciate the diversity of the properties of neutron stars that are produced when a massive star collapses and explodes @xcite .",
    "the list of different manifestations of neutron stars now includes : radio pulsars that are powered by the rotation of their @xmath16 g magnetic fields ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; accreting x - ray pulsars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and thermonuclear bursters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that are accreting matter from binary companions ; magnetars that are powered by the decay of their @xmath14@xmath17 g fields ( which historically have been categorized as either anomalous x - ray pulsars or soft gamma repeaters ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; intermittently - detectable `` rotating radio transients '' ( rrats ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; isolated , cooling neutron stars that shine primarily in soft x - rays @xcite , and central compact objects that are seen as point sources near the centers of supernova remnants @xcite . understanding the properties of these compact objects and their birth rates",
    "provides important constraints on the late - time evolution of massive stars , and on the processes that occur during stellar collapse .",
    "the relationships among the different classes of compact object could reveal how their magnetic fields decay and their interiors cool .    in this paper",
    ", we present a search for magnetars .",
    "this search is timely for two reasons .",
    "first , recent evidence suggests that magnetars are the products of unusually massive progenitors .",
    "three magnetars have been found to be in clusters of massive , young stars @xcite , and the turn - off masses of two of these clusters imply that the progenitors to the neutron stars were very massive , 3040 @xmath18@xcite .",
    "a fourth magnetar has been associated with a bubble of neutral hydrogen that was probably blown by the wind of a @xmath1930 @xmath18  progenitor @xcite .",
    "this suggests that massive stars may be more likely to produce magnetars , whereas ordinary radio pulsars are generally presumed to be left by lower - mass , 820 @xmath18  progenitors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "given that less massive stars are much more common ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , if massive stars produce magnetars , one would expect that their birth rates should be much lower than those of radio pulsars @xcite .",
    "second , there is significant debate about how the strong magnetic fields that characterize magnetars are produced .",
    "the original hypothesis is that magnetars are born with millisecond periods , and that the strong fields are produced by a dynamo in the rapidly - rotating proto - neutron star @xcite .",
    "however , observations of supernova remnants associated with magnetars rule out the expected input of energy from neutron stars with initial spin periods @xmath203 ms @xcite . at the same time , the discovery of a few ob stars with @xmath21 g surface fields @xcite has motivated the alternative hypothesis that magnetar - strength fields are primordial , having been amplified only by the collapse of the core @xcite .",
    "this second hypothesis is attractive because it makes a straightforward prediction , that the birth rate of magnetars should be equal to that of highly - magnetized ob stars .",
    "however , it can not yet explain why some highly - magnetized neutron stars are radio pulsars instead of magnetars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this discrepancy is one of the main points in favor of the @xmath22@xmath23 dynamo process that would act in a rapidly - rotating proto - neutron star , because it could produce @xmath14@xmath24  g internal fields that would power the magnetars @xcite .    here , we report the results of our search for new galactic magnetars in archival observations taken with the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ and the _ xmm - newton _ observatory .",
    "previous searches for periodic sources with these observatories have been limited to small fields , such as the small magellanic cloud @xcite and the central 20 pc of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "our search incorporates observations through the entire galactic plane .",
    "although we find four new sources with significant periodic signals , none are likely to be magnetars .",
    "therefore , we use the survey to place limits on the number of active magnetars in the galaxy , and discuss the implications for their birth rates .",
    "we attempted to identify new magnetars by searching for sources with periodic x - ray pulsations in archival _ chandra _  and _ xmm - newton _  observations of the galactic plane .",
    "we included observations with a galactic latitude @xmath0@xmath15@xmath2  that were public as of january 2007 .",
    "for both observatories , we required that some of the data were taken in an imaging mode . for _ chandra _ , we further rejected observations taken with the gratings in place . for _ xmm - newton _ , we rejected all observations shorter than 10 ks , because they were often affected by background flares throughout their entire duration . in total",
    ", we searched 506 _ chandra _  observations , and 441 _ xmm - newton _  observations .",
    "the coverage on the sky is illustrated in figure  [ fig : coverage ] . within a galactic longitude of @xmath25@xmath110@xmath2  and a latitude @xmath0@xmath15@xmath2 , which encloses about half of the mass of the galaxy ( e.g. , using the model in launhardt , zylka , & mezger 2002 ) , these observations cover about 6% of the sky .",
    "closer to the galactic plane , within @xmath25@xmath110@xmath2  and @xmath0@xmath10.5@xmath2 , the observations cover 25% of the sky .",
    "the raw event lists and calibration data were downloaded from the high energy astrophysics science archive research center .",
    "we processed the event lists produced by each observatory in the standard manner , in order to extract events for sources that we could search for periodic variability .",
    "the _ chandra _  data were processed using ciao version 3.4 .",
    "as we were only interested in the arrival times of events , we did not apply the latest calibration .",
    "we started with the default level 2 event files , and removed any time intervals during which flares from the particle background caused the total event rate from the detectors to increase by more than 2@xmath26 above the mean event rate .",
    "we then generated exposure maps at a fiducial energy of 1.5 kev ( i.e. , the peak of the detector effective area ) , and binned the event lists to produce images in the 0.58.0 kev band .",
    "these were used to search for point sources using the routine wavdetect @xcite . for computational efficiency , we searched a series of three images using sequences of wavelet scales that increased by a factor of @xmath27 : a central , un - binned image of 8.5  by 8.5  searched over scales of 14 pixels , an image binned by a factor of two to cover 17  by 17searched over scales of 18 pixels , and an image binned by a factor of four to cover the entire field searched over scales of 116 pixels .",
    "the source lists from each image were combined for each observation , favoring the positions derived from the images with the highest spatial resolution for sources detected at multiple scales .",
    "we did not attempt to discriminate real sources from detector artifacts , such as the boundaries of the individual charge - coupled devices ( ccds ) , at this stage of the algorithm .",
    "we then extracted events from each source , using a radius defined to enclose 90% of the point spread function ( psf ) at 4.5 kev . in this case , a relatively higher energy was used so that we would not exclude photons from sources with hard spectra .",
    "the radius was dependent on the offset from the aim point in arcminutes ( @xmath28 ) , and was parameterized based on simulations with the ciao tool mkpsf as @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the radius in pixels ( 0492 ) .",
    "we corrected the arrival times of the events to the solar system barycenter using the tool axbary .",
    "the _ xmm - newton _  event lists from the european photon imaging camera ( epic ) were analyzed using version 7.0 of the science analysis software , ciao 3.4 , and the high energy astrophysics software version 6.3.0 .",
    "we examined the lists from each active imaging detector separately , starting with the files from the archive . for most observations ,",
    "the same field was observed with three independent cameras : one pn ccd array and two metal - oxide - silicon [ mos ] ccd arrays .",
    "we removed time intervals during which particle events caused the event rate from the detector to flare more than two standard deviations above the mean rate .",
    "this selection was generally successful at removing particle flares , but in many cases the entire observation for a given camera was affected by flares , which rendered this automatic algorithm useless .",
    "we discarded data from individual cameras ( usually the pn ) for observations too badly affected by flares .",
    "we then created images of the 0.212 kev events , binned to 4resolution .",
    "the standard data selection was applied to make the images , in order to remove events near the edges of the detector chips and bad pixels , and to reject events that were likely to be cosmic rays ( pattern @xmath314 for the pn and @xmath3112 for the mos ) .",
    "we then generated matching exposure maps .",
    "we searched for point sources using the routine ewavelet , separately for each observation . at this stage of the algorithm",
    ", we did not attempt to discriminate real sources from detector artifacts , nor did we attempt to verify that sources detected in one camera were present in the others .",
    "we extracted event lists from individual sources using the radius produced by ewavelet , which generally was @xmath915  and enclosed @xmath950% of the psf .",
    "the arrival times of the photons were corrected to the solar system barycenter using the tool barycen .      for sources with at least 100 total events from either observatory ( including background )",
    ", we computed fourier periodograms to search for periodic signals .",
    "the range of periods searched for both instruments was designed to encompass those of known magnetars with x - ray pulsations , 512 s @xcite .",
    "however , we note that after our analysis was completed , @xcite announced the discovery at radio wavelengths of 2  s pulsations from 1e  1547.0 - 5408 .",
    "periods this short would generally only be identifiable in _ xmm - newton _  epic - pn data with our search .    for the _ chandra _  data",
    ", we used the rayleigh statistic ( @xmath32 ; * ? ? ?",
    "we searched for signals with frequencies between 1.5 times the nyquist frequency ( i.e. , @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the interval at which the data were read out ) and 10% of the inverse of the total time interval of the observation ( i.e. , @xmath35 ) to avoid red noise .",
    "we used a frequency step corresponding to the inverse of the total time interval ( @xmath36 ) . for most observations ,",
    "the data were read out every @xmath34=3.1 s , so the highest frequencies searched correspond to periods of 4.1 s. observations typically lasted between 1.2 ks and 120 ks , so we could identify signals with periods at the upper range of at least 120 s , and in some cases 12,000 s.    for the _ xmm - newton _  data , the rayleigh statistic was computationally inefficient to compute for pn observations of bright sources , so we computed discrete fast fourier transforms .",
    "the data were padded so that the number of points in the transform was a power of 2 , so the frequency resolution was generally finer than @xmath36 .",
    "the maximum frequency considered was the nyquist frequency for the data .",
    "the pn data was taken with a time resolution of at least 73.4 ms , providing sensitivity to periods as short as 0.15 s. the mos data was taken with a time resolution of at least 2.4 s , and so our search was sensitive to periods as short as 4.8 s. the lowest frequency considered was 0.1/@xmath37 .    the confidence with which we could exclude that any given signal was produced by random noise depended upon the number of trial signals examined , @xmath38 .",
    "the typical _ chandra _  observation lasted 20 ks , and contained 3 sources with @xmath19100 counts , and had a time resolution of 3.1 s , so that there were @xmath38@xmath920,000 trial frequencies in the ensemble of periodograms from each observation . the typical",
    "_ xmm - newton _  observation also lasted 20 ks , and contained @xmath925 sources per camera with @xmath19100 counts . for each mos detector , with a time resolution of 2.4 s , the typical set of periodograms contained @xmath38@xmath9200,000 trial periods per observation .",
    "for the pn detector , with a time resolution of 73.4 ms , the typical set of periodograms contained @xmath39@xmath9@xmath40 trial periods . in total , we searched @xmath41 trial periods , the vast majority of which were from the high - time - resolution data taken with the epic pn .",
    "the powers produced by random noise in a periodogram in which @xmath42 measurements have been averaged are distributed as a chi - squared function with @xmath43 degrees of freedom .",
    "following @xcite , we refer to the measured fourier powers with @xmath42=1 as @xmath44 , and normalize them so that the mean power produced by white noise is 1 .",
    "the chance probability that noise would produce a signal larger than @xmath44 can be determined from an exponential distribution : @xmath45 where the approximation is valid for @xmath44@xmath461 @xcite .",
    "given the large number of trials for our entire search , a signal that had a @xmath10.1% chance of resulting from noise must have a power @xmath44@xmath1932.8 .",
    "such a signal would be detected at a confidence level equivalent to 3@xmath26 over the entire search , or 8@xmath26 in a single trial .",
    "however , a signal could also be considered significant if it was detected with a lower power in multiple observations , as one might hope would occur given that _",
    "xmm - newton _  has three separate cameras that observe the same patch of the sky .",
    "for instance , given two signals @xmath47 and @xmath48 at the same frequency , the chance probability that their sum exceeds some value is a chi - squared distribution with 4 degrees of freedom : @xmath49 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for the general form for summing an arbitrary number of signals ) .",
    "if we take @xmath50 , for example , a signal has a @xmath10.1% of resulting from noise if it appeared with @xmath47@xmath1917 in both observations . in principle",
    ", one could devise an algorithm that searched through all of the periodograms from the same source , and sum the powers at each frequency to search for signals that repeat in the data . in practice , however , the periodograms were not all computed with the same frequency resolution , which makes such an effort difficult . moreover ,",
    "when considering observations separated in time , one also has to be concerned that some candidate signals drifted in frequency , either because of the spin - down of an isolated pulsar , or doppler shifts for a pulsar in a binary ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* for further discussion ) .",
    "therefore , we have adopted a simplified approach in examining candidate signals , by recording all signals with powers with less than a 1% chance of resulting from noise in a search of a _",
    "single source_. for _ chandra _  acis , the threshold power is generally @xmath51@xmath1917 . for the _ xmm - newton _  mos ,",
    "the threshold power is typically @xmath44@xmath1919 , whereas for the pn the power is @xmath51@xmath1926 .",
    "any candidate signal was inspected to determine its significance .    with these search criteria ,",
    "our results up to this point were dominated by signals that are non - periodic noise or detector artifacts . in both _ chandra _  and _ xmm - newton _  data , we detected low - frequency noise from astrophysical flares in the count rates of individual sources such as pre - main - sequence stars , and from background flares that our filtering algorithm failed to remove . from _",
    "chandra _",
    "acis , we detected signals from sources that fell near chip boundaries , at the harmonics and beat periods of the satellite dither ( 700s in the @xmath52-direction , 1000s in the @xmath53 ) .",
    "for the _ xmm - newton _",
    "epic , particularly the pn , we found signals with a range of periods that appeared to be related to hot columns and chip boundaries , particularly in observations with high particle background .",
    "we are not certain of the origin of these signals from the epic .",
    "the spurious signals introduced by the detector generally shared the feature that they could be found in multiple sources at the exact same frequency during an observation .",
    "therefore , we have removed from consideration any signals that appeared in two or more sources on the same detector in the same observation . after removing such signals",
    ", we found 358 sources with candidate signals in the _ chandra _  observations , and 1380 sources ( some of which are duplicates ) with signals from _ xmm - newton_.    these signals still turned out to be dominated by low - frequency noise and detector artifacts , which could be quickly determined by visually inspecting the power spectrum .",
    "therefore , for the final step , we scrutinized @xmath91700 power spectra by eye to remove the remaining examples that were clearly noisy , and to remove sources that appeared to be detector artifacts .",
    "we defined a signal as significant if it had a power @xmath44@xmath1932.8 in a single observation or had a power larger than the single - observation threshold in two or more observations .",
    "we found a few sources with significant periodic signals that we could not attribute to noise or detector artifacts .",

    "having failed to identify any causes intrinsic to the spacecraft , on - board computers , or data processing , we believe that they are astrophysical , and that the factor of two difference between them is simply a coincidence .",
    "the periodic signals that we have detected from previously - unidentified sources all have periods longer than 100 s. although there is a chance that some of these systems are neutron stars , we expect that most of them belong to the much - larger population of magnetically - accreting white dwarfs , either polars or intermediate polars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "they will be distributed over the entire sky , not just within @xmath0@xmath15@xmath2 , our targeted survey of the galactic plane is not particularly efficient at finding cataclysmic variables .",

    ", it is notable that no new source was found to exhibit periodic variability with periods in the range of known magnetars that are pulsed in x - rays , 512 s. to understand the lack of detections of obvious candidate neutron stars , we need to compute the fraction of the galaxy that was covered by our survey .",
    "if the properties of magnetars as a population were bettern known , we would do so by assuming distributions for their luminosities and pulse amplitudes , and carry out a maximum - likelihood or monte - carlo calculation to model the observed population ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "1e 1547.05408 was positively dentified as a magnetar through radio observations of a variable , point - like x - ray source in a supernova remnant that was studied deliberately @xcite .",
    "x - ray pulsations have not yet been confirmed from this source , so we do not consider it here .",
    "based on the above considerations , we now calculate the fraction of young stars that _ rxte _ , _ asca _ , _ chandra _ , and _ xmm - newton _  surveyed per year during their lifetimes , in the same manner as in  3.13.2 .",
    "we assume that the target magnetar would have @xmath3=@xmath8 erg s@xmath5  ( 0.510 kev ) , and a net number of counts determined by the observations in which xte  j1810197 and ax  j1845.00258 were identified . for _ rxte _",
    "xte  j1810197 was detected with @xmath96 counts s@xmath5 in a 2.6 ks observation with the proportional counter array ( pca ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so we assume that a pulsar would require @xmath126 total counts to be identifiable .",
    "we take the pca field - of - view to be 50@xmath10550 , and use a count - to - flux conversion that is 33% of the on - axis value .",
    "we find that the _ rxte _  pca has surveyed @xmath92% of the galaxy down to this sensitivity during the last 11 years , and @xmath90.7% in any given year . for _ asca _ ax  j1845.00258 was detected with @xmath91000 net counts in each gas imaging spectrometer @xcite .",
    "vignetting drastically reduces the count rates from sources off - axis , so we assume a field - of - view of only 20@xmath10520 , and use a flux - to - count conversion that is 33% smaller than the on - axis value .",
    "we find that _ asca_observations were sensitive to bright magnetars over @xmath93% of the galaxy during its 7 year lifetime , and @xmath91% of the galaxy per year .",
    "finally , we find that _ chandra _  surveyed @xmath90.5% of the galaxy per year over the last 7 years , and that _ xmm - newton _  surveyed @xmath91% of the galaxy per year over the last 6 years . taken together , and accounting for overlaps , we find that over the last 11 years ( since the launch of _ rxte _ ) , @xmath92% of the galaxy has been surveyed by a pointed x - ray observatory each year .    in figure",
    "[ fig : numtaxps ] , we plot the constraints on the total number of transient axps , given that two were identified during observations of @xmath109=0.02 of the young galactic population each year for @xmath115=11 yr .",
    "transient axps are probably the largest undiscovered population of magnetars . for instance , if the average transient axp produces outbursts at a rate of one per 10 years , then there could be @xmath127 of them in the galaxy .",
    "the upper bound is comparable to the number of quiescent magnetars that we estimate could be present based on archival _ chandra _  and _ xmm - newton _  observations . for a lifetime of @xmath13 yr @xcite ,",
    "this implies a brigh rate of 0.0080.06 yr@xmath5 .",
    "the lower bound is @xmath950% of the radio pulsar birth rate , whereas the upper bound exeeds the higher estimate of the pulsar birth rate from @xcite .",
    "the higher rate would be large compared to the estimated galactic supernova rate .",
    "however , it is possible that transient magnetars have significantly longer lifetimes than have been estimated based on the energy budgets of the persistent examples ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in which case the birth rates would be correspondingly lower .",
    "we have serached archival _ chandra _  and _ xmm - newton _  observations for x - ray pulsars , in order to constrain the galactic population of magnetars .",
    "although we found four objects with periodic variability on time scales of 2005000  s ( figs .",
    "[ fig : cxcfft][fig : xmmprof ] and table  [ tab : signals ] ) , we found no sources that were obviously magnetars .",
    "the archival observations that we used covered a moderate fraction of the young stellar populations from which magnetars descend .",
    "our search was sensitive to the standard , easily - detectable axp - like magnetar ( @xmath3=@xmath8 erg s@xmath5  [ 0.510 kev ] and a sinusoidal pulse profile with @xmath6=0.12 , or equivalently @xmath3=@xmath4 erg s@xmath5  and @xmath6=0.7 ) with 90% completeness for @xmath95% of the mass in the galactic spiral arms .",
    "searching for transient axps in quiescence ( @xmath3=@xmath4 erg s@xmath5  and @xmath6=0.15 ) , however , we were only sensitive over 0.4% of the galactic spiral arms .",
    "based on the number of known galactic magnetars , we then placed constraints on the total population .",
    "our archival search placed strict constraints on the number of standard , persistent axps , which number @xmath112 with 90% confidence .",
    "we also placed constraints on the number of sgr - like magnetars as a function of the rate at which they produce outbursts ( fig .",
    "[ fig : numsgrs ] ) , and find that for a likely recurrence rate of 0.01 @xmath128 , there would be @xmath122 in the galaxy .",
    "however , these populations may be dwarfed by the number of transient axps similar to xte  j1810197 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "no new examples were detected in archival _ chandra _  and _ xmm - newton _  observations , so up to 540 quiescent axps could be present in the galaxy .",
    "we also considered the fact that two transient axps have been discovered in outburst by _",
    "asca _  and _",
    "rxte_. the fact that _ asca _ , _ rxte _ , _ chandra _ , and _ xmm - newton _  together have surveyed 2% of the galaxy each year for the last 11 years allows us to constrain the number of transients as a function of their recurrence time ( fig .",
    "[ fig : numtaxps ] ) . for a recurrence time",
    "of once every 10 years , this calculation suggests there are between 80 and 580 transient axps , with 90% confidence . assuming a lifetime of @xmath88 yr for persistent magnetars @xcite , their birth rate is at least 10% of that of radio pulsars , and",
    "could equal the radio pulsar birth rate ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the birth rate of transient magnetars could exceed those of radio pulsars , unless their lifetimes are significantly longer than @xmath88 years .",
    "the main uncertainty in the number of galactic magnetars is introduced by the unknown activity level of transient examples .",
    "further monitoring of known transient axps would constrain their duty cycles and reduce this uncertainty , so long as the known examples can be taken as representative of all magnetars .",
    "ultimately , though , a wide - field monitoring campaign is needed to identify more transient axps in outburst .",
    "this can be accomplished in principle in the x - ray band , although the sensitivity of current and planned wide - field monitors ( @xmath9@xmath129 erg @xmath66 s@xmath5 , 0.510 kev ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is only sufficient to barely detect a @xmath8 erg s@xmath5  magnetar to a distance of 4 kpc from earth . on the other hand , the detections of xte j1810197 @xcite and 1e  1547.05408 @xcite in the radio with characteristic intensities of @xmath14100",
    "mjy kpc@xmath130 suggests that future radio surveys with the low - frequency array , the mileura wide - field array , or the square kilometer array ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) could provide the best constraints on the numbers of magnetars in the galaxy .",
