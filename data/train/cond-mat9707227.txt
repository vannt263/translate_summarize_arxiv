    "the frenkel - kontorova model of classical particles connected to their nearest neighbors by springs and placed in a one - dimensional periodic potential @xmath0 @xcite is of interest for several different reasons .",
    "first , it provides a simple example which exhibits some of the complex phenomena ( discommensurations , devil s staircase phase diagrams ) associated with commensurate - incommensurate phase transitions @xcite . for some recent studies , see @xcite ; also @xcite for extensions to quantum systems , and @xcite for classical particles at a finite temperature .",
    "next , various interesting dynamical phenomena result if forces , either static or dynamic , are applied to the particles in a frenkel - kontorova chain ; for some recent work , see @xcite . finally , the equilibrium configurations of this model form the orbits of an area - preserving twist map @xcite , so that their study is part of the subject of nonlinear dynamical systems @xcite .    a special , exactly solvable realization introduced by aubry @xcite and percival @xcite , in which @xmath0 consists of a potential made up of identical parabolas , has played a pioneering role in the study of general frenkel - kontorova models .",
    "it is particularly useful for understanding the properties of incommensurate ground states in the  cantorus \" regime : such configurations define invariant cantor sets of the associated area - preserving map , on which the motion is quasiperiodic with an irrational winding number @xmath1 .",
    "cantori , or aubry - mather sets @xcite , have been the subject of considerable research @xcite , as they constitute the ubiquitous remnants of broken kam tori in non - integrable hamiltonian systems @xcite .",
    "the present paper is dedicated to a generalization of this solvable model to the case in which the parabolas all have the same curvature , but need not be uniformly spaced nor located at the same height .",
    "the only constraint is that after @xmath2 parabolas , where @xmath2 is finite , the whole pattern is repeated , thus giving rise to a periodic @xmath0 .",
    "see the example with @xmath3 sketched in fig .",
    "the case @xmath4 is , of course , the one studied earlier by aubry and percival .",
    "the generalization is important for two reasons : first , as we pointed out for @xmath5 in a previous paper @xcite , qualitatively novel phenomena emerge which are not present in the case @xmath4 .",
    "examples are incommensurate defects , discontinuous cantorus - cantorus phase transitions , and independent orbits of gaps composing the complement of the aubry - mather set .",
    "second , it provides a tool , through the possibility of approximating a smooth potential by a set of parabolas , for identifying true ground states in the presence of infinite sets of competing metastable cantorus configurations , as encountered in frenkel - kontorova models with smooth @xmath0 differing from a simple cosine @xcite .    in the following sections we give the detailed solution for general @xmath2 , which in essence consists in replacing the original infinite - variable minimization problem by that of finding the minimum of a certain convex function defined on a finite simplex . while the second minimization problem is not altogether trivial , it can be carried out to quite adequate precision in particular cases by a combination of analytical and numerical techniques .",
    "efficient numerical methods are the subject of the paper which follows .",
    "previous research on this topic of which we are aware includes an unpublished thesis of f. vallet @xcite .",
    "he considered some particular cases for @xmath6 , including the @xmath5 situation with equally spaced parabolas discussed in our previous publication , for which he wrote down an explicit expression for the ground state energy . and he pointed out that the same methods could be applied to the general @xmath2 situation using a parametrization of the hull function very similar to the one employed here .",
    "more recently kao , lee , and tzeng @xcite have addressed the problem of finding the ground state by using a hull function to find solutions of the equilibrium equations .",
    "their results are consistent with those in the present manuscript .    in addition ,",
    "aubry , axel and vallet considered a somewhat different extension of the @xmath4 solvable model , with even and odd numbered particles subjected to different potentials @xcite .",
    "while there are certain similarities , this model ( and the method used to solve it ) seems to be distinct from the @xmath5 case considered here .",
    "recently kao , lee , and tzeng @xcite have solved a model in which the parabolas have negative curvature ; the results are very different from the case of positive curvature discussed here .",
    "our material is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec2 ] contains basic definitions for the model including the explicit form of the potential @xmath0 . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] the energy for an equilibrium state is rewritten with the help of a green s function in a form which is combined with some of aubry s exact results for ground states in sec .",
    "the result is used in sec .",
    "[ sec5 ] to set up an explicit minimization problem of a convex function over a finite simplex , the solution to which yields both the energy and configuration of the ground state .",
    "the conclusion , sec .",
    "[ concl ] , indicates a number of possible generalizations .",
    "minor technical issues are discussed in two appendices .",

    "the @xmath11-th parabola is given by the formula @xmath12 we assume that the positions of the minima of these parabolas form a monotonic periodic sequence , @xmath13 and the values at the minima are periodic , @xmath14 but otherwise arbitrary .    because all the parabolas have the same curvature , the @xmath15 axis consists of segments separated by a sequence of _ dividing points _",

    "thus this interval is uniquely associated with the @xmath19th parabola , and if @xmath8 falls in this interval , we shall say that particle @xmath9 is  in \" parabola @xmath19 , or @xmath20 .",
    "given the periodicity ( [ 2.6 ] ) , it is clear that two such intervals whose subscripts differ by @xmath2 will be of the same length , and will have corresponding values of @xmath21 .",
    "thus we shall say that such an interval , or the corresponding parabola , is of  type @xmath22 \" , @xmath23 , if @xmath24 .",
    "let @xmath25 be the minimum of the parabola containing the @xmath9-th particle , in the sense just discussed .",

    "one obtains @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32",
    "an equilibrium state is one in which the force is zero on every particle , which means @xmath33 for every @xmath9 , and thus , by ( [ 2.12 ] ) , @xmath34 if we assume that the @xmath35 are known and are bounded as a function of @xmath9 , the solution of ( [ 5.1 ] ) may be written as @xmath36 using the green s function ( decreasing at infinity ) @xmath37 which satisfies the equation @xmath38 here @xmath39 is a positive number defined by : @xmath40    multiplying ( [ 5.1 ] ) by @xmath41 and summing yields , see ( [ 2.12 ] ) and ( [ 5.2 ] ) : @xmath42 with the help of the function @xmath43 one can rewrite ( [ 5.2 ] ) and ( [ 5.6 ] ) as : @xmath44 @xmath45    the fact that @xmath46 means that ( [ 5.7 ] ) expresses the position of particle @xmath9 as a weighted average of the positions of the parabolas occupied by the different particles .",
    "it is useful for later purposes to extend @xmath47 to a function @xmath48 defined on the entire real axis by means of linear interpolation between successive integers , ( see fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) , which is to say : @xmath49g(\\hbox{int}(x ) ) + \\hbox{frac } ( x)g(1+\\hbox{int } ( x ) ) , \\label{5.11}\\ ] ] where @xmath50 is the largest integer not greater than @xmath51 , and @xmath52 stands for @xmath53 .",
    "note that the resulting function is convex for @xmath54 , and also for @xmath55 , and possesses a piecewise constant derivative with discontinuities whenever @xmath51 is an integer .",
    "if the equilibrium configuration is monotonic in the sense that for all j , @xmath56 that is , @xmath57 , then one can write @xmath58 , ( [ 5.8 ] ) in an alternative form with the help of the function , @xmath59 the number of the last particle in parabola @xmath19 , or of the last particle preceding this parabola if it is empty .",
    "( one can think of @xmath60 as a sort of inverse of the function @xmath61 . ) if @xmath62 is the distance between the minima of two successive parabolas , it is easy to show that @xmath63 thus if particle @xmath9 is not the last particle in some parabola , which is to say particle @xmath64 is in the same parabola , @xmath65 never takes the value @xmath9 and @xmath66 , so both sides of this equation vanish .",
    "if @xmath9 is the last particle in parabola @xmath19 and parabola @xmath67 is not empty , then @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 is larger than @xmath9 , so again ( [ 5.14 ] ) holds . if , on the other hand , parabola @xmath19 is followed by one or more empty parabolas , then for each of these @xmath71 takes the same value @xmath9 , and thus @xmath72 is expressed as the correct sum of @xmath73 intervals . with the help of ( [ 5.14 ] ) ,",
    "( [ 5.8 ] ) can be written as @xmath74 with sums over parabolas instead of particles .",
    "similarly ( [ 2.10 ] ) may be written in the form @xmath75 because @xmath76 is equal to the number of particles in parabola @xmath19 .",
    "for an infinite configuration @xmath78 of particles , expressions such as ( [ 2.1 ] ) are formally infinite and do not possess a direct interpretation . following aubry @xcite , we shall understand ( [ 2.1 ] ) as prescribing the change in energy if any finite set of particles are displaced from one set of positions to another .",
    "a _ minimum energy _",
    "configuration is one for which any such change increases @xmath79 ( or leaves it constant ) and a _ ground state _ is a minimum energy configuration which satisfies certain recurrence conditions @xcite .",

    "( note that this is different from the process of choosing , for each @xmath89 and @xmath90 fixed , the @xmath88 which minimizes the finite sum in ( [ 3.2 ] ) ! )    if @xmath1 is irrational , any ground state configuration with @xmath91 has the form @xmath92 where @xmath93 is some constant , and @xmath94 is a monotone strictly increasing  hull \" function @xcite which is step periodic , i.e. , @xmath95 when @xmath96 is discontinuous , as it is for the @xmath21 considered here , the discontinuities form a dense set , and there are two versions of @xmath96 : @xmath97 , which at each discontinuity takes the maximum possible value consistent with monotonicity , and is thus right - continuous , or upper semi - continuous , and @xmath98 , which takes the minimal possible value at each discontinuity , and is thus left continuous , or lower semi - continuous . either @xmath97 or @xmath98 may be employed in ( [ 3.3 ] ) , though not both simultaneously @xcite .",

    "@xmath169 is an additive constant which is set equal to zero in the following discussion .",
    "then @xmath170 is a function of the unknown parameters @xmath171 , and must be minimized by varying these parameters .",
    "in fact , adding the same constant to every @xmath172 leaves @xmath170 unchanged ( note eq .",
    "[ 6.4 ] ) and therefore , since the @xmath173 s , ( [ 6.1 ] ) , can not be negative , it suffices to consider the problem of minimizing @xmath170 on the _ simplex _",
    "@xmath174    one can think of the @xmath175 as the positions of a set of @xmath2  quasi - particles \" located on a circle of unit circumference , interacting with each other through a set of pair potentials given by @xmath176 and , in addition , subjected to constant single - particle forces ( the @xmath177 s ) , whose sum is zero .",
    "the fact that @xmath178 has a minimum at @xmath179 means that the pair forces tend to keep the quasi - particles separated , although the imposition of suitable single - particle forces can push two or more together .",
    "however , the order ( [ 6.8 ] ) must be preserved : these quasi - particles have hard cores and will not move through each other .",
    "note that @xmath170 , regarded as a function of the @xmath180 on the domain ( [ 6.8 ] ) , is a sum of continuous convex functions , and is therefore continuous and convex . as a continuous function on a compact domain",
    ", it necessarily has a minimum someplace on ( [ 6.8 ] ) , possibly on the boundary .",
    "either @xmath170 takes its minimum at a unique point or on some larger convex subset of ( [ 6.8 ] ) . if @xmath1 is a rational number one can find examples where the minimum is not unique .",
    "these correspond to ( first - order ) phase transitions where one can have two or more distinct ground state configurations . on the other hand , if @xmath1 is irrational , @xmath170 is a strictly convex function which achieves its minimum at a unique point in the simplex ( [ 6.8 ] ) .",
    "the strict convexity of @xmath170 in this case arises from the strict convexity of @xmath178 , whose derivative with respect to @xmath51 has a dense set of discontinuities on the interval @xmath181 when @xmath1 is irrational .",
    "once the @xmath175 are known , and thus the @xmath182 , see ( [ 5.23 ] ) , the ground state configuration @xmath183 and the hull function @xmath96 , ( [ 3.3 ] ) can be obtained by means of the following construction .",

    "[ fig7 ] , so that in the ground state @xmath185 inserting this expression in ( [ 5.7 ] ) yields @xmath186 comparison with ( [ 3.3 ] ) shows that @xmath187 where the sum yields @xmath98 because @xmath188 has been defined to be continuous from the left .",
    "if at each discontinuity one sets @xmath189 equal to @xmath190 rather than @xmath191 , ( [ 7.4 ] ) will yield @xmath97 .",
    "we have shown how the problem of finding ground state configurations for a frenkel - kontorova model in a system of parabolas of identical curvature , assuming the system has a finite period , can be reduced to finding the minimum of a certain convex function , ( [ 6.7 ] ) , over the variables @xmath192 belonging to a finite simplex ( [ 6.8 ] ) .",
    "while this second minimization problem is not trivial , the examples in our previous paper @xcite show that the solution can be worked out in particular cases with a certain amount of effort , for instance , by treating the @xmath193 as parameters and computing the corresponding @xmath194 . an efficient numerical procedure for finding the minimum , which works well for @xmath2 up to the order of 200 ,",
    "is discussed in the paper which follows @xcite .",
    "it is natural to ask whether further generalizations of this type of model might prove interesting .",
    "there are several possibilities worth considering : first , one can imagine taking the limit @xmath195 with @xmath156 held finite in such a way that @xmath0 converges to some _ smooth or piecewise smooth _ periodic potential , such as a cosine .",
    "while it is unlikely that such an approach will yield an exact solution for the ground state of an arbitrary smooth periodic potential , it may nonetheless provide some interesting insights , and preliminary studies of this problem are encouraging , see @xcite .",
    "second , one can imagine a limit with both @xmath2 and @xmath156 tending to infinity in a way which leaves their ratio fixed , thus yielding an example of a potential , still composed of parabolas , which is _ quasiperiodic _ or possesses some other deterministic form of non - periodicity .",
    "an exact solution for such a case would be quite interesting .",
    "third , one might hope to study cases in which @xmath0 consists of parabolas of two ( or more ) different curvatures ; for example , parabolas which meet at points where their first derivatives are continuous and their second derivatives discontinuous .",
    "such models have been studied numerically @xcite .",
    "an interesting analytical investigation of a particular case and the corresponding  tent map \" has been performed by bullett @xcite .",
    "the basic difficulty with non - uniform curvature is that the green s function needed to solve the counterpart of ( [ 5.1 ] ) is much more difficult to calculate .",
    "yet the fact that novel phenomena appear already when the basic @xmath4 parabolic model is extended to @xmath5 suggests that any progress in this direction would be worth the effort .",
