    "the need for the efficient use of the scarce spectrum in wireless applications has led to significant interest in the analysis of cognitive radio systems which are proposed as systems that have the potential to operate in the licensed spectrum without disturbing the primary users and hence better utilize the spectrum @xcite . since it is very important for the cognitive users not to interfere with the primary users during their transmission , detection of primary users activity in the channel is the main concern in cognitive radio research . in @xcite and",
    "@xcite the authors developed an optimal strategy for opportunistic spectrum access by maximally utilizing spectrum opportunities in cognitive radio networks with multiple potential channels .",
    "note that spectrum sensing brings along an essential decrease in the throughput of a system .",
    "realizing this fact , the authors in @xcite studied the tradeoff between channel sensing and throughput considering shannon capacity as the throughput metric . providing primary users with a sufficient protection against interference , they formulated an optimization problem and found out the optimal sensing time . motivated by jointly detecting signal energy levels over multiple frequency bands rather than considering one band at a time , quan _",
    "_ in @xcite introduced a novel wideband spectrum sensing technique .",
    "an important characteristics of wireless communications is that channel conditions vary over time randomly due to mobility and changing environment if the channel conditions are not known a priori , training sequences are frequently employed to perform channel estimation .",
    "early studies conducted by cavers @xcite and @xcite provided an analytical approach in pilot - assisted transmissions . in @xcite , hassibi and hochwald optimized the power and duration of training signals by maximizing a capacity lower bound in multiple - antenna rayleigh block fading channels .",
    "ohno and giannakis @xcite focused on a capacity lower bound and optimized the spacing of training symbols and training power by employing a noncausal wiener filter for channel estimation at the receiver in slowly - varying channels . in their studies @xcite , abou - faycal _ et al .",
    "_ employed a causal kalman filter at the receiver in which all the past pilot symbols are used to estimate the channel coefficients .",
    "more recently , we in @xcite jointly optimized the pilot symbol period and power allocation among pilot and data symbols by maximizing the achievable rates in gauss - markov fading channels , and in @xcite we used causal and noncausal wiener filters at the receiver to estimate the channel coefficients .    in this paper",
    ", we study the training - based transmission schemes for cognitive radio systems in time - selective rayleigh fading channels where cognitive radios are able to transmit data as long as they do not disturb the primary ( licensed ) users of the channel .",
    "we employ causal and noncausal wiener filters at the receiver to obtain the estimates of the channel fading coefficients .",
    "we maximize a capacity lower bound by optimizing the training parameters .",
    "note that even though the treatment is in general , we provide our numerical results for gauss - markov channel models .",
    "in this paper , we consider a cognitive radio channel model communicating over a time - selective rayleigh flat fading channel in which a secondary transmitter attempts to send information to a secondary receiver , probably interfering with the primary users .",
    "initially , the secondary users perform channel sensing , and then depending on the primary users activity , the secondary transmitter selects its transmission power , i.e. , when the channel is busy , the average symbol power is @xmath0 , and when the channel is idle , the average symbol power is @xmath1 .",
    "for example , if @xmath2 , the secondary transmitter stops transmission when the primary users are sensed to be active . during the transmission , the discrete - time channel input - output relation in the @xmath3 symbol duration is given by @xmath4 if the primary users are in the channel .",
    "on the other hand , if the primary users are idle in the channel , we have @xmath5 in the above equations , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the complex - valued channel inputs , and @xmath8 is the complex - valued channel output , and @xmath9 is assumed to be a sequence of independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "zero mean gaussian random variables with variance @xmath10 . in ( [ input - out1 ] ) and ( [ input - out2 ] ) , @xmath11 denotes the fading coefficient between the secondary transmitter and the secondary receiver , which is assumed to be a zero - mean gaussian random process with power spectral density @xmath12 .",
    "it is further assumed that @xmath13 is independent of @xmath11 and @xmath14 . while both the secondary transmitter and the secondary receiver know the channel statistics , neither has prior knowledge of instantaneous realizations of the fading coefficients . in ( [ input - out1 ] ) , @xmath15 represents the sum of the active primary users faded signals arriving at the secondary receiver .",
    "we assume that the bandwidth available in the system is @xmath16 , and the channel is sensed every first @xmath17 seconds of the block which is @xmath18 seconds .",
    "note that the discrete - time model is obtained by sampling the received signal every @xmath19 seconds .",
    "if the transmission strategies of the primary users are not known , energy - based detection methods are well - suited for the detection of the activities of primary users . following the same approach as in @xcite",
    ", we consider a hypothesis testing problem between the noise @xmath14 and the signal @xmath15 in noise . noting that there are @xmath20 complex symbols in a duration of @xmath17 seconds , this",
    "can mathematically be expressed as follows : @xmath21 considering the above detection problem , the optimal neyman - pearson detector is given by @xcite as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the detection threshold .",
    "we assume that @xmath15 has a circularly symmetric complex gaussian distribution with zero - mean and variance @xmath24 .",
    "assuming further that @xmath25 are i.i.d . , we can immediately conclude that the test statistic @xmath26 is chi - square distributed with @xmath27 degrees of freedom . in this case , the probabilities of false alarm and detection can be established as follows : @xmath28 where @xmath29 denotes the regularized lower gamma function and is defined as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the lower incomplete gamma function and @xmath32 is the gamma function .    in the above hypothesis testing problem , another approach is to consider @xmath26 as gaussian distributed , which is accurate if @xmath20 is large @xcite . in this case , the detection and false alarm probabilities can be expressed in terms of gaussian @xmath33-functions .",
    "we would like to note the rest of the analysis in the paper does not depend on the specific expressions of the false alarm and detection probabilities .",
    "however , numerical results are obtained using ( [ false alarm ] ) and ( [ eq : probdetect ] ) .",
    "we consider pilot - assisted transmission where periodically inserted pilot symbols , known by both the sender and the receiver , are used to estimate the fading coefficients of the channel .",
    "we assume a simple scenario where a pilot symbol is transmitted every @xmath18 seconds after channel sensing , and @xmath34 data symbols following the pilot symbol are transmitted between the secondary transmitter and the secondary receiver .",
    "we consider the following average power constraints : @xmath35 when the channel is detected as busy . on the other hand , when the channel is detected as idle",
    "the power constraint becomes @xmath36 therefore , the total number of symbols transmitted in one block is @xmath37 , and the total energy is limited by @xmath38 and @xmath39 for the cases when the channel is busy and idle , respectively .",
    "communication takes place in two phases . in the training phase",
    ", the transmitter sends pilot symbols and the receiver estimates the channel coefficients . in this phase ,",
    "the channel output is given by @xmath40 when the channel is busy , and @xmath41 when the channel is idle .",
    "@xmath42 is the power allocated to the pilot symbol . in the data transmission phase ,",
    "data symbols are transmitted . in this phase",
    ", input - output relationship can be written as @xmath43 when the channel is busy , and @xmath44 when the channel is idle where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the estimated channel coefficient and the error in the estimate at sample time @xmath47 , respectively .",
    "note that @xmath45 and @xmath46 for @xmath48 are uncorrelated zero - mean circularly symmetric complex gaussian random variables with variances @xmath49 and @xmath50 , respectively .",
    "let us assume that @xmath51 is the set of integers , @xmath52 , such that outputs at time samples @xmath53 are used to estimate the channel fading coefficient at time @xmath47 .",
    "due to periodicity , we will consider only the cases where @xmath54 .",
    "we consider a causal and a non - causal estimation procedure .",
    "considering the decision of channel sensing and its correctness , we have four possible scenarios :    1 .",
    "channel is busy , detected as busy , 2 .",
    "channel is busy , detected as idle , 3 .",
    "channel is idle , detected as busy , 4 .",
    "channel is idle , detected as idle .",
    "we assume that a wiener filter , known as the optimum linear estimator in the mean - square sense , is used at the secondary receiver to estimate the fading coefficients of the channel between the secondary transmitter and the secondary receiver .",
    "since the pilot symbol is sent every @xmath18 seconds , the channel is sampled every @xmath18 seconds .",
    "therefore , we have to consider the under - sampled version of the channel s doppler spectrum given by @xmath55 also as shown in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , it can be easily obtained that the channel mmse for the noncausal wiener filter at time @xmath56 is given by @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the activity probability of primary users in the channel . as for the causal wiener filter , using a similar approach as in in @xcite and @xcite , mmse at time @xmath56",
    "is given by @xmath59 where @xmath60 is obtained from the canonical factorization of the channel output s sampled power spectral density at @xmath61 , given by @xmath62 the operators @xmath63 and @xmath64 give the causal and anti - causal parts of the function to which they are applied , respectively .",
    "using the orthogonality principle we have @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the variance of the channel estimate at time @xmath56 .",
    "similarly as in @xcite , we regard the errors in ( [ datatransmission1 ] ) and ( [ datatransmission11 ] ) as another source of additive noise and assume that @xmath67 and @xmath68 are zero - mean gaussian noises with variances @xmath69 when the channel is busy , and @xmath70 when the channel is idle , respectively . considering the errors in ( [ datatransmission1 ] ) and ( [ datatransmission11 ] ) and the scenarios given above , we obtain the following lower bound on the channel capacity :    @xmath71    where @xmath72 is a zero - mean , unit variance , circularly symmetric complex gaussian random variable , and @xmath73 $ ] and @xmath74 $ ] denote the power of @xmath75 data symbol after the pilot symbol when the channel is busy and idle , respectively .",
    "note that the error variance @xmath76 depends on @xmath77 or the location of data symbol with respect to the pilot symbol .",
    "however , if the fading is slowly varying and the channel sampled fast enough , we can satisfy @xmath78 or @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the maximum doppler frequency and @xmath81 . in this case",
    ", we can see from nyquist s theorem that there is no aliasing in the under - sampled version of the channel s doppler spectrum , and hence @xmath82 , for @xmath83 $ ] and @xmath84 . henceforth , ( [ noncausal min mean square error ] ) becomes @xmath85 and ( [ causal min mean square error ] ) becomes @xmath86\\mathit{dw}\\nonumber\\\\ & = \\sigma_{h}^{2}-\\frac{p_{t}}{2\\pi}\\int_{-\\frac{\\pi}{tb}}^{\\frac{\\pi}{tb}}\\frac{|s_{h}(e^{jw})|^{2}}{p_{t}s_{h}(e^{jw})+tb(\\sigma_{n}^{2}+\\rho\\sigma_{s_{p}}^{2})}\\mathit{dw}\\nonumber\\\\ & + \\frac{p_{t}}{2\\pi r_{e}(tb)^{2}}\\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi}\\left|\\left\\{\\frac{s_{h}(e^{\\frac{jw}{tb}})}{l^{*}(e^{jw})}\\right\\}_{-}\\right|^{2}\\mathit{dw}=\\sigma_{\\widetilde{h}}^{2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath87 therefore , under this assumption , the error variances become independent of @xmath77 .",
    "since the estimate quality is the same for each data symbol regardless of its position with respect to the pilot symbol , uniform power allocation among the data symbols is optimal , and we have @xmath88 and @xmath89 then , ( [ capacity_gh ] ) becomes @xmath90",
    "in this section , we consider gauss - markov fading process whose dynamics is given as @xmath91 where @xmath92 is a parameter that controls the rate of channel variation , and @xmath93 are i.i.d .",
    "circular complex gaussian variables with zero mean and variance @xmath94 .",
    "the power spectral density of this channel is given as @xmath95 note that @xmath12 in ( [ psd ] ) is not band - limited .",
    "therefore , the condition @xmath79 can be satisfied only when @xmath96 which is not a reliable strategy . on the other hand ,",
    "if the fading is varying slowly and the value of @xmath92 is close to 1 , the doppler spectrum @xmath12 decreases sharply for large frequencies and most of the energy is kept around the lower frequencies .",
    "we can easily find that the frequency ranges @xmath97 $ ] , @xmath98 $ ] and @xmath99 $ ] contain more than @xmath100 of the power when @xmath101 and @xmath102 , respectively .",
    "therefore , in these cases the effect of aliasing is negligible .",
    "we can easily obtain the error variance for the noncausal wiener filter from ( [ noncausal_min mean square error new ] ) . on the other hand , we have to perform canonical factorization in order to obtain the error variance for the causal wiener filter in the absence of aliasing . due to limited space in the paper",
    ", we will skip some of the calculation steps .",
    "we can express the anti - causal part of ( [ causal min mean square error new ] ) as @xmath103 where @xmath104 @xmath105 and @xmath106 note that @xmath107 using ( [ anti - causal part ] ) and ( [ re ] ) , we can obtain the error variance for the causal wiener filter as @xmath108\\mathit{dw}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    since the primary users are not to be disturbed by the secondary users , when the primary users are active there is an average transmission power threshold on the secondary users which is denoted as @xmath109 .",
    "therefore , the power constraint can be expressed as follows @xmath110\\left[p_{d}p_{1}+(1-p_{d})p_{2}\\right]\\leq ti_{avg}\\ ] ] and the average signal - to - noise ( snr ) is @xmath111    in figure [ fig : fig1 ] , employing a causal wiener filter and a noncausal wiener filter at the secondary receiver , we show the data rate as a function of snr ( db ) when @xmath112hz , and @xmath113 seconds and @xmath114 seconds .",
    "we choose @xmath115 and @xmath116 since in reality these are plausible and obtainable values considering the tradeoff between probability of detection and false alarm . note that when @xmath117 , there will be no constraint on @xmath118 and the secondary user can use power as much as its peak value allows .",
    "as expected , we obtain higher data rates when we use a noncausal wiener filter .",
    "note that the difference between the data rates obtained by using a causal and a noncausal wiener filter is decreasing with the increasing snr . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] , we compare the data rate values for different snr values , 0 db and 10 db , as a function of probability of detection , @xmath119 , again employing a causal and a noncausal wiener filter at the secondary receiver .",
    "it is clearly seen that the highest data rates are obtained when @xmath115 and @xmath116 for both wiener filters . again , as expected the data rates obtained using noncausal wiener filters are higher than the ones obtained by causal wiener filters . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] , we display the optimal power distribution as a function of probability of detection , @xmath119 . recall that @xmath42 denotes the power allocated to the pilot symbol , and @xmath120 and @xmath118 represent the power allocated to the data symbols when the channel is busy and idle , respectively . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] , it is easily observed that the power allocated to the data symbols when the channel is busy or idle is decreasing with decreasing @xmath119 , since the interference power constraint is mainly over @xmath118 and there is less transmission with @xmath120 .",
    "furthermore , the power allocated to the pilot symbol is the highest when @xmath115 , where at the same time @xmath116 .",
    "we have studied channel sensing , pilot - symbol assisted channel estimation , and achievable rates when causal and noncausal wiener filters are employed at the secondary receiver .",
    "we have obtained achievable rates by finding error variances in both cases , and shown the effects of channel sensing over the achievable rates .",
    "subsequently , we have optimized power allocated to the pilot and data symbols .",
    "finally , we have obtained numerical results in gauss - markov channels showing the optimal parameter values .",
