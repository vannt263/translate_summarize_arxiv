    "it has been proposed that for even smaller angles new zeros in the velocity should appear.@xcite as in tb calculations smaller twisted angles correspond to larger unit cells , we do not find a second zero in the fermi velocity because of the numerical limitations to the angles we can study . in the twisted trilayer case the situation is different : we find that for angles smaller than 1.16@xmath12 , where the velocity is near zero , the conduction and valence bands couple and a small anticrossing gap of the order of @xmath56 appears . as we will show below , this anticrossing occurs because at small angles the layers are strongly coupled , resulting in wave functions with a mixed weight in the three layers . by restricting the tunneling between the twisted bilayer and the extra layer only to vertical hoppings , we reduce the mixing between layers and this anticrossing disappears .    in order to analyze our results we have computed the band structure of the trilayer twisted bilayer in a continuous model . in the inset of fig .",

    "the shifted parabolic band @xmath59 corresponds to states mainly located in the inner bernal layer , labeled 2 , especially for large rotation angles .",

    "thus , for smaller angles we obtain that the carriers corresponding to bands @xmath59 and @xmath60 have an increasingly mixed spatial distribution , evidencing an enhancement of the coupling .",
    "this angle of 5@xmath12 is where the renormalization of the velocity for the twisted trilayer carriers is noticeable ; as it is well known , this is also a sign of the increased coupling , that we also relate here to the spatial distribution of the electrons corresponding to the low - energy bands .",

    "the gap has an almost constant value equal to @xmath62 for angles in the range 4@xmath12 and 20@xmath12,@xcite and decreases to zero at smaller angles .",
    "the oscillations observed in the continuum results are related to those observed in the renormalized velocity ( inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : vel ] ) .",
    "we attribute the discrepancy between the tight - binding and continuum results to the fact that the continuum model can only cope with the layer - layer interactions locally .",
    "the vertical tunneling neglects the effect of odd - numbered carbon atom rings among layers considered in a tb model with hopping beyond nearest neighbors . as a consequence",
    ", the continuum model does not appropriately describe the electron - hole asymmetry of the system .",
    "[ fig : sh ] also shows that around 5@xmath12 , the two parabolic bands cross , so for large angles the non - bonding band pinned at zero has a higher energy than the shifted parabolic band at the dirac point .",
    "this change in the position of the two parabolic bands coincides with the change in the spatial distribution of the states corresponding to the linear twisted - like band and the shifted parabolic band .",
    "_ continuum effective model_. as the continuum model outlined in the previous section is not valid for the description of the low - energy spectrum of twisted trilayer graphene , we modify it accordingly , deriving an effective hamiltonian for the band structure near the dirac point .",
    "this hamiltonian describes the parabolic bernal - like bands and the linear dirac cone corresponding to the twisted layer :    @xmath63     + is the wavevector measured from the dirac point , and @xmath64 , @xmath65 are small onsite energy terms that break the e - h symmetry , giving rise to the shift of the twisted cone and the opening of the gap respectively .",
    "this model yields a decoupled linear dirac cone stemming from the twisted layer and the parabolic bands from the bernal stacking .",
    "the difference between this hamiltonian and that given by eq .",
    "[ ham_cont ] amounts to the diagonal terms @xmath64 and @xmath65 , which are not equal in value and angle - dependent . as discussed above , this is due to the loss of e - h symmetry , not described appropriately by the continuum approximation .",
    "therefore , we consider them as parameters given by the tb calculation .    finally , the effect of an external applied bias @xmath66 between the outer layers 1 and 3 is described by adding de corresponding diagonal terms to the effective hamiltonian , eq .",
    "[ hameff ] .",
    "this does not open a gap in the dirac cone , but produces a shift in the dirac point and modifies the gap between the parabolic bands . as an example , adding @xmath67 to the first diagonal element and @xmath68 to the diagonal of the @xmath69 box corresponding to the twisted layer , induces a shift @xmath70 in the dirac cone and modifies the parabolic gap to @xmath71 .",
    "thus , the application of a bias may close the gap of the parabolic bands and , for negative @xmath66 , it can shift down the dirac cone .",
    "in summary , we have shown that the low - energy spectrum of the twisted trilayer graphene composed by two bernal - stacked layers and a third rotated graphene sheet is a combination of the bilayer bernal - like parabolic bands and linear dirac cone reminiscent of the twisted bands .",
    "the parabolic bands show a gap that gets larger for smaller angles .",
    "there is also a shift in the dirac cone that has a similar angular dependence .",
    "the velocity of the twisted - like bands is renormalized for small angles , tending to zero when the rotation angle tends to zero .",
    "we find that the gap is correlated with the shift of the dirac cone in an isolated twisted bilayer .",
    "the shift is due to the loss of the electron - hole symmetry produced by the mixing of the two sublattices .",
    "one of the parabolic bands has a non - bonding character , pinned at zero energy at the dirac point , and its carriers are located exclusively in the outer bernal layer .",
    "the other bands have a carrier distribution that depends on the rotation angle . for larger angles ,",
    "the parabolic band is mostly located on the inner bernal layer , whereas the carriers of the linear bands are mainly on the twisted layer .",
    "however , for angles below @xmath72 there is an increasing weight on the twisted layer for the parabolic band , and the linear bands , initially located on the twisted layer , gain weight in the other two ab - stacked layers .",
    "the change in localization indicates an increase in the effective coupling between layers , and coincides with a change in the relative position of the two parabolic bands , i. e. , a zero gap point .",
    "this also concurs with the onset of the velocity renormalization , consistent with the aforementioned enhancement of the effective interlayer interaction .",
    "we have compared our results obtained with a tight - binding model with those derived from a continuum approximation . while the velocity renormalization it is correctly given by the continuum model , the shift of the dirac cone is not well described by this approximation , neither with respect to the sign nor to the angular dependence .",
