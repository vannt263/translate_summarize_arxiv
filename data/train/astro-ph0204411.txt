    "the reported wimp parameter region is @xmath2 and @xmath3 . on the other hand ,",
    "the cdms collaboration@xcite and edelweiss collaboration@xcite reported having excluded most of the parameter space claimed by the dama experiment within the standard supersymmetry(scalar couplings ) and the halo models .",

    ", the dama group published a paper in which they interpreted the annual modulation signal in a spin - independent and spin - dependent mixed framework@xcite . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath4 could be as high as 0.6pb for @xmath5 if we assume certain sets of parameters .",
    "these results suggest that wimps could be detected via spin - dependent interaction and the dark matter search experiments should be performed both via spin - independent and spin - dependent interactions .",
    "we , the tokyo group , had developed a lithium fluoride ( lif ) bolometer to detect wimps via spin - dependent interaction in the surface laboratory@xcite then performed pilot runs at the shallow depth site@xcite .",
    "we have improved our lif bolometer since we installed the detector system in 2000 at kamioka observatory ( 2700m.w.e ) and recently we made a dark matter search measurement from 2001 through 2002 .    in this paper",
    ", we report our first results from the dark matter search experiment performed at kamioka observatory with new limits in the @xmath1 ( wimps - nucleon couplings ) plane .",
    "the laboratory for this dark matter search experiment was newly caved near the super - kamiokande detector at mozumi mine of kamioka mining and smelting co. located at kamioka - cho , gifu , japan .",
    "the laboratory is at the depths of 2700 m.w.e and the muon flux is reduced about five orders of magnitude compared to the surface laboratory . as the radon concentration in the mine air is high and has a seasonal change ( 40 ( winter)@xmath61200 ( summer ) bq/@xmath7 ) ,",
    "the fresh air from the outside of the mine is blown into the laboratory with a rate of 1 @xmath8 .",
    "the radon concentration in the laboratory is less than 50 bq/@xmath7 .",
    "the detector used in this dark matter search experiment is a lif bolometer array consisting of eight lif bolometers with a total mass of 168 g .",
    "each bolometer consists of a 2@xmath92@xmath92 @xmath10 lif crystal and a neutron transmutation doped ( ntd ) ge thermistor ( 1.5@xmath91@xmath91 mm@xmath11 ) @xcite glued to the lif with ge varnish .",
    "we refer to each bolometer as d1 , d2 , ... , and d8 .",
    "four of the lif crystals are purchased from bicron co. ltd .",
    "( expressed as bic in table [ boloids ] ) while the others are from ohyo koken kogyo co. ltd .",
    "( expressed as oken in table [ boloids ] ) .",
    "ntd3 thermistors , which have been used for most of the previous measurements , are used for six out of the eight bolometers , while ntd2 and ntd4 are used for one bolometer each .",
    "characteristics of the ntd thermistors are shown in ref .",
    "radioactive contamination in the crystals were previously checked with a low - background ge spectrometer and was found to be less than 0.2 ppb for u , 2 ppb for th , and 20 ppm for k. surfaces of the lif crystals were etched with perchloric acid in order to eliminate remaining grains of the polishing powder .",
    "features of the eight bolometers are summarized in table [ boloids ] .",

    "the array consists of two stages , each stage holding four bolometers .",
    "the bolometers are fixed with spring pins and delrin balls .",
    "thermal contacts between the lif crystals and the oxygen free high conductivity ( ofhc ) copper holder are achieved by annealed ofhc copper ribbons of 10 mm width and 0.1 mm thickness .",
    "the etching process and the assembly were performed in a clean bench of class 100 .",
    "the bolometer array is encapsulated in a low - radioactivity lead ( older than 200 years ) of 2 cm thickness .",

    "@xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 can be calculated with shell models and are shown in table [ spsn ] .    from the obtained wimp - proton and wimp - neutron elastic scattering cross section limits , we derived the limits in the @xmath1 plane .",
    "we again followed ref .",

    "are shown in fig.[fig result apan ] ( a ) .",
    "the regions between the two parallel lines are the allowed regions from @xmath23li and @xmath24f alone , respectively .",
    "it is seen that a single nuclide is not sufficient to set a finite limit in the @xmath1 plane .",
    "since we have @xmath23li and @xmath24f as the targets , we can take the intersection of the two regions as the combined allowed region from the lif detector .",
    "this is the merit of the detector consisting of more than two nuclides with sufficient spins .",
    "we show the allowed regions in the @xmath1 plane obtained by this experiment for light wimps ( fig.[fig result apan ] ( b ) ) and heavy wimps ( fig.[fig result apan ] ( c ) ) .",
    "the limits set by this experiment for @xmath25=30gev are @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "we compared our results with those of other experiments .",
    "as the dama group had not shown the results from @xmath28na and @xmath29i independently@xcite , we were not able to compare our results with the spin - dependent annual modulation allowed regions which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig result lim sd]@xcite . instead",
    ", we compared our results with those of the ukdmc experiments@xcite .",
    "since ukdmc shows the limits from @xmath28na and @xmath29i independently @xcite , we can calculate the limits in the @xmath1 plane from @xmath28na and @xmath29i and combine them without any assumptions .",
    "it should be noted that limits in the @xmath1 plane from the nai detector are largely affected by the sensitivity ratio of @xmath28na and @xmath29i ; the threshold of the detector and the quenching factor of @xmath29i largely change the limits .",
    "furthermore , accurate calculation of the annual modulation allowed region requires all of the obtained experimental data with time information , which we do not have .",
    "therefore , we did not take the risk of deriving the limits or allowed region in the @xmath1 plane from the experiments of which independent results from @xmath28na and @xmath29i are not shown .    in fig .",
    "[ fig apan with uk ] , the allowed regions for the ( a ) : sufficiently light wimps for which @xmath29i loses the sensitivity and nai effectively becomes a detector with one nuclide , ( b ) : wimps with mass near the center value of dama s annual modulation signal , and ( c ) : wimps heavy enough for which @xmath28na and @xmath29i both have good sensitivities , are shown . in the three plots , the limits from na and",
    "i of ukdmc@xcite are shown in dotted and dash - dotted lines , respectively , nai combined limits of ukdmc@xcite are shown in thin solid lines and lif combined limits from this work are shown in thick solid lines .",
    "ukdmc published the recalculated data@xcite in which only nai combined limits are shown , and we derived the limits in the @xmath1 plane on the assumption that the sensitivity ratios of @xmath28na and @xmath29i are the same as those shown in ref .",
    "these new limits from ref .",
    "@xcite are shown in dashed lines just for reference .",
    "it is seen that our results can set limits complementary to the results obtained with nai detectors .",
    "for the light wimps ( lighter than 20 gev for most of the detectors ) to which @xmath29i loses sensitivity , this is the only experiment that can set a finite allowed region in the @xmath1 plane .    for the wimps with a mass of 50 gev , which is near the center value of dama s annual modulation signal , we exclude more than two thirds of the parameter space allowed by the ukdmc experiments .",
    "as the limits from the ukdmc experiments are close to the dama s spin - dependent allowed region , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig result lim sd ] , we should also be able to compare our limits in the @xmath1 plane .",
    "we , however , have to wait until dama publishes relevant data to calculate the allowed region in the @xmath1 plane .    for the wimps with a mass of 100 gev",
    ", we only exclude a part of the ukdmc allowed region .",
    "however , it must be stressed that though our @xmath30 limits are about two orders of magnitude worse than the limits of ukdmc as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig result lim sd ] , we are able to tighten their limits in the @xmath1 plane .",
    "this is because the spin factors of @xmath24f are large and the @xmath22 sign of @xmath24f is different from those of @xmath23li , @xmath28na , and @xmath29i .",
    "though we are able to tighten the limits from the ukdmc experiment in the @xmath1 plane , the background is still high for the direct detection of wimps .",
    "we studied the background sources and found that potassium contamination on the surface of the lif crystals , tritium produced by the neutron capture of @xmath31 during the development in the surface laboratory , and the uranium and thorium contamination in the ofhc copper holder and in the inner lead shield dominate the background in the energy region between 10 kev and 90 kev .",
    "we are planning to etch the lif crystals more deeply in order to eliminate the contamination on the surface of the lif crystals .",
    "we also plan to use naf crystals as a bolometer in order to eliminate the effects of tritium .",
    "it is also expected that naf crystals give more stringent limits in the @xmath1 plane since @xmath32 and @xmath33 set limits orthogonal to each other in the @xmath1 plane as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig result apan ] and fig .",
    "[ fig apan with uk ] .",
    "we are planning to install active shields between the lif crystals and the ofhc copper holders to reduce the background from the ofhc copper holder and the inner shield . with these improvements",
    ", we expect to improve the sensitivity of our detector by more than one order of magnitude .",
    "we have performed the first underground dark matter experiment at kamioka observatory . with a total exposure of 4.1 kg@xmath0days",
    ", we have obtained @xmath30 limits factor 5 improved from the pilot run at nokogiriyama underground cell .",
    "we calculated the limits in the @xmath1 plane and showed that our results tightened the limits from the ukdmc experiment .",
    "for the wimps with a mass of 50 gev , we have excluded more than two thirds of the parameter space in the @xmath1 plane allowed by the ukdmc experiment . as dama s",

    "[ fig result lim sd ] is close to ukdmc s limits , we should also be able to compare our limits in the @xmath1 plane with dama s spin - dependent annual modulation allowed region when dama publishes relevant data to calculate the allowed region in the @xmath1 plane .",
