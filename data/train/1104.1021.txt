    "a one - dimensional cellular automaton is defined on a spatial lattice of @xmath8 sites where @xmath8 can either be finite or infinite . in this work",
    "we will keep @xmath8 finite and the state of each site is in one of the @xmath9 states at any time @xmath10 .",
    "each site follows the same prescribed rules for updating . for elementary ca ,",
    "the number of neighborhood of each site is @xmath11 .",
    "the state of ca starts out with arbitrary initial configuration which is represented by @xmath12 where @xmath13 can be in any one of the @xmath9 states .",
    "the configuration of system at time @xmath10 is denoted by @xmath14 . in this work the state of each site",
    "is restricted to @xmath15 such that @xmath16 .",
    "let @xmath17 be any one of the ca , the value of @xmath13 at @xmath18 time step is set equal to @xmath19 which is equal to @xmath20 or @xmath2 according to the rule of interest .",
    "apparently for elementary ca there are @xmath21 rules .",
    "following wolfram s notation each rule can be assigned with a number given by : @xmath22 for example , rule @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) is the one with @xmath25 , @xmath26 and all others @xmath27 .",
    "based on large number of numerical studies , wolfram has suggested that ca can be classified into four classes @xcite .",
    "cellular automata within each class have the same qualitative behavior . starting from almost all initial conditions , trajectories of",
    "ca become concentrated onto attractors , the four classes can then be characterized by their attractors . according to wolfram s classification , classes i , ii and iii are roughly corresponding to the limit points , limit cycles and chaotic attractors in continuous dynamical systems respectively .",
    "more precisely their respective long time limits are : ( i ) spatially homogeneous state , ( ii ) fixed ( steady ) or periodic structure and ( iii ) chaotic pattern throughout space .",
    "the fourth class of ca behaves in a much more complicated manner and was conjectured by wolfram as capable for performing universal computation . for finite one - dimensional ca ,",
    "the lattice is arranged on a circle with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "such cellular automata have a finite number of states @xmath28 , and as a result , after sufficient long time evolution the system must enter the state which can either be homogenous , steady or periodic state .",
    "therefore , the class iii and iv attractors do not exist in finite ca .",
    "however , it is also known that classes iii and iv are hard to distinguished in some cases and resulting with disputed classification . in some sense this is due to the lack of a sensible way for defining complexity which is the criterion for class iv . in @xcite",
    "a. shreim _",
    "et al_. studied networks generated by ca , they claimed to have found highly heterogeneous state space networks for classes iii and iv in contrast to the networks generated by classes i and ii .",
    "one of the characteristic of state space is the in - degree distribution @xmath5 which is defined as @xcite @xmath29 where @xmath8 is the size of the lattice , @xmath28 is the total number of state and @xmath30 is the number of state with in - degree @xmath6 .",
    "however in their analysis on the local properties , approximation has been applied in the analytical calculation of i d which shows nontrivial scaling . for completeness",
    "we briefly summarize their method of calculation in this section .",
    "they introduced the transfer matrix @xmath31 which maps each pair @xmath32 onto the pair @xmath33 , and such @xmath34 could be used to characterize all the preimages of hubstates ( a hubstate is the state which has the maximum in - degree @xmath35 . ) the rows and columns are order as `` @xmath36 '' , `` @xmath37 '' , `` @xmath38 '' and `` @xmath39 '' accordingly . for example the @xmath31 matrix of @xmath4 is given by : @xmath40 it is easy to check that the maximum in - degree @xmath35 is related to @xmath31 as @xmath41 the scaling of @xmath35 with the lattice size can be obtained by using the largest eigenvalue @xmath42 of @xmath43 , namely , @xmath44 with @xmath45 .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath4 we assigned @xmath46 as the number of isolated @xmath47 , for example two configurations @xmath48 and @xmath49 have @xmath50 and @xmath11 respectively .",
    "then by assuming a one - one corresponding relation between @xmath6 and @xmath46 , the following expression was proposed for the in - degree distribution : @xmath51 a multiscaling result is then obtained and given by the following expression @xcite : @xmath52}. \\label{eq : five}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "the result of eq .",
    "( [ eq : five ] ) was ploted in @xcite and are apparent curvature appeared on the curve as such a conclusion of nultiscaling method than finite - size effect was proposed .",
    "similar results of multiscaling in other rules were also reported in their article by using the same approximation approach . to compare the results of @xcite with exact calculation we have performed the exact enumeration of @xmath4 with different @xmath8 . for the lack of space , in table [ tab : table1 ]",
    "we only list all the in - degree s for @xmath56 .",
    "the same characteristic also exist for other values of @xmath8 .",
    "one notices that for the same @xmath6 there corresponds more than one value of @xmath46 .",
    "for example , for @xmath57 , @xmath46 can either be @xmath11 or @xmath58 .",
    "therefore the meaning of @xmath59 is ambiguous .",
    "one might argue that the multi - valueness of @xmath46 is an artifact of small @xmath8 .",
    "however we have checked with @xmath60 where different states with the same @xmath6 were found .",
    "in fact , for @xmath61 , states of different @xmath46 can be constructed easily .",
    "for example , for @xmath61 , we have found at least @xmath11 states @xmath62 and @xmath63 which correspond to @xmath64 and @xmath65 respectively .",
    "since the results were obtained for small @xmath6 , there is a possibility that dn / dk might be well - defined for large @xmath6 . to refute this reasoning",
    ", we have performed the large @xmath6 analysis for different @xmath8 . for @xmath56 , @xmath66 with @xmath67 and",
    "the second maximum in - degree @xmath68 with @xmath50 ; even in @xmath69 , we got @xmath70 with @xmath67 and @xmath71 with @xmath50 .",
    "the results indicate that for @xmath72 the @xmath73 is not a small quantity .",
    "in fact @xmath74 rises exponentially as @xmath8 getting larger . as a result",
    ", @xmath75 can never be infinitesimal implying the meaningless of @xmath59 .",
    "thus the simple multiscaling results in @xcite is in doubt .",
    "the result of eq .",
    "( [ eq : four ] ) is presented by the solid line in figure [ fig : one ] . by substituting the corresponding @xmath35 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : five ] ) , one has @xmath76 . for @xmath4 with @xmath69 ,",
    "the results of @xmath77 relation are provided in figure [ fig : one ] .",
    "there is only one hubstate with @xmath67 in such system , consequently the exact @xmath78 equals to @xmath79 @xcite which implies @xmath80 independent of @xmath8 instead of @xmath81 as obtained by the approximation calculation .",
    "obviously the approximation for getting eq .",
    "( [ eq : five ] ) is inadequate .",
    "in fact the above discrepancies prompted us to re - analyze this problem .",
    ".[tab : table1 ] the relation of in - degree @xmath6 and @xmath46 for @xmath4 with @xmath56 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in this section we have found more rules which could not be treated with @xmath82 @xmath31 matrix can now be dealt with by @xmath83 transfer matrix .",
    "consequently , the maximum in - degree and the i d can be evaluated efficiently .",
    "a detail discussion of the local characteristic of network generated by elementary ca is presented in this work .",
    "first we have located the possible source of errors in claiming the multiscaling of such network in @xcite .",
    "this is due to a misused of derivative on large difference .",
    "secondly the in - degree distributions of many rules were calculated by direct counting method and the multiscaling characteristic does not appear . from the studies up to @xmath69 , it suggests that the in - degree distribution of ca is @xmath8 independent regardless of its classes .",
    "furthermore all the possible largest eigenvalues @xmath42 for @xmath82 transfer matrix @xmath31 are obtained and analysis on the correlation between @xmath45 and classification of ca is discussed .",
    "we have found that there might be more rules sharing the same in - degree distribution but corresponding to different classification according to s. wolfram .",
    "it has been found that there are good correlation for class iv which possess @xmath84 , however , apart from that , the i d of other classes do not share any universal pattern and also the value of @xmath85 can not be used as an indicator for classification .",
    "therefore the in - degree distribution is not a proper characteristic to classification which was also pointed out in @xcite . in section [ sec : level3 ]",
    ", the transfer matrix was extended to @xmath83 @xmath86 matrix .",
    "this augmentation in some sense respects the evolution of ca rule and is also more natural to reflect the characters of hubstates pre - images . as a result",
    "the @xmath83 matrix scheme was applied to several rules which do not possess a @xmath82 @xmath31 matrix .",
    "the @xmath87 @xmath31 matrix has also applied to ca beyond neighbor evolution .",
    "the @xmath8 dependence of the hubstates of some particular rules such as @xmath0 and @xmath1 are discussed in detail .",
    "the calculation of their @xmath35 are also treated in this work .",
