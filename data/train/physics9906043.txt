    "the last decades have seen a very successful development of new concepts and methods for the investigation of low - dimensional dynamical systems .",
    "it is obviously worth while to draw inspiration from this low dimensional experience when studying the much more difficult and much less explored field of high and infinite dimensional dynamics , especially in the context of spatially extended systems .",
    "this strategy has motivated the construction of certain models of high dimensional dynamical systems which are particularly well suited for an analysis in the tradition of what has been done for low dimensional systems .",
    "one class of such models has been termed _ coupled map lattices _ @xcite . here ,",
    "time as well as the spatial aspect of the system are discretised .",
    "the most commonly studied coupling form in such systems is a nearest - neighbour coupling .",
    "there exists a large number of numerical and phenomenological investigations about such systems , and they have been very useful for studying typical effects appearing in extended systems as well as for formulating theoretical concepts appropriate for the characterisation of such systems .",
    "however , for certain explicit calculations it is attractive to look at a different form of coupling , which is not local but global , and which gives each subsystem the same influence on every other subsystem @xcite",
    ". obviously , mean - field type approximations of models with local coupling lead to such a global coupling .",
    "these approximations are usually good for long range interactions @xcite or for nearest - neighbour couplings on high - dimensional lattices @xcite , but all spatial characteristics of the system loose their meaning since all subsystems are treated equally independent on where they are",
    ".    on the other hand , global coupling does not only appear as an approximation ; there are many applications where one is interested in a global coupling of the subsystems right from the beginning . typically , this is the case in systems for which a macroscopic ( i.e. global ) conserved quantity exists , which mediates the global coupling .",
    "prominent examples of globally coupled systems ( in the form of globally coupled differential equations ) are arrays of josephson junctions @xcite , laser arrays @xcite , multi - mode lasers @xcite , certain chemical reactions @xcite , interacting biological clocks @xcite , and models of neural activity @xcite .",
    "in this paper we study the discrete - time version of globally coupled systems : globally coupled maps .    before formulating in the next section a more general definition of the type of systems which we want to consider , we give a typical example : a system of @xmath0 globally coupled tent maps for the discrete time ( index @xmath2 ) evolution of the subsystem states @xmath3 with @xmath4 here , the parameter @xmath5 has the meaning of a coupling strength , and @xmath6 characterises the slope of the tent .",
    "a very rich variety of dynamical phenomena in the long term has been observed in this system ( or in a system of globally coupled logistic maps ) , caused by the competition between a possibly chaotic local dynamics @xmath7 and the ordering influence of the coupling term @xcite .",
    "depending on the values of the parameters @xmath5 and @xmath6 , the system can show complete synchronisation of all subsystems , partial synchronisation with the formation of synchronised clusters , or turbulent , seemingly uncorrelated movement of all subsystems .",
    "in addition , multi - stability , often with infinitely many attractors , is a common feature .",
    "these phenomena seem to be typical for all globally coupled systems .",
    "a technical merit of global coupling is that it is relatively easy to analyse the thermodynamic limit @xmath1 of the time evolution of globally averaged quantities like the mean field @xmath8    in the thermodynamic limit , the time evolution of the mean - field can be obtained from the so called _ nonlinear frobenius - perron equation _",
    "@xcite , an equation for probability densities @xmath9 on the subsystem state space : @xmath10 )                         \\rho_{t}(x ) \\d{x } , \\ ] ] where @xmath11 : = \\int f_{a}(x)\\rho(x)\\d{x } .\\ ] ]    this equation has to be solved self - consistently . here",
    ", the tent map ( [ eq:1 - 20 ] ) brings a special advantage : because of the piecewise linearity of the map it is possible to approximate the densities @xmath9 by piecewise constant functions , and this leads to a very accurate numerical procedure to follow the long - term dynamics of equations ( [ eq:1 - 40 ] ) and ( [ eq:1 - 50 ] ) , see e.  g. @xcite . while for a truly turbulent , uncorrelated behaviour of the subsystems one would expect to find a fixed point attractor for the dynamics of the densities , much more complicated attractors",
    "have been observed , hinting at some nontrivial , hidden correlations in the system even in cases without any partial synchronisation .",
    "one example for such a non - trivial attractor is shown in fig .  1 , where @xmath12 is plotted versus @xmath13 for @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "looking at this figure there appears to be a low - dimensional quasiperiodic attractor of the nonlinear frobenius perron dynamics .",
    "( more detailed calculations have shown that there is a fine structure in the time delay mean - field representation which can not be resolved in fig .  1 . )    during the last few years the nonlinear frobenius perron equation has been the subject of numerous numerical and theoretical investigations @xcite .",
    "however , the temporal behaviour of the mean - field can be predicted correctly by the nonlinear frobenius perron dynamics only in the limit @xmath1 . for large but finite @xmath0",
    "there are clear deviations of the mean - field from its limit behaviour .",
    "it is worth while to study in more detail the @xmath1 asymptotics of the long - term behaviour of the mean - field because of the following reasons :    \\a ) numerical simulations of a system of globally coupled maps are bound to use a finite number @xmath0 of maps .",
    "it is important to be able to estimate how large one has to choose @xmath0 in such simulations in order to recognise the details of the frobenius perron dynamics .",
    "\\b ) globally coupled systems which are motivated by realistic examples consist of a finite number of subsystems .",
    "if one wants to use for their description the results obtained in the thermodynamic limit one has to understand in detail how the limit situation is approached as the number of subsystems grows .",
    "\\c ) the nonlinear frobenius perron equation may produce features that are sensitive to the system size in the sense that they can not be observed for finite @xmath0 at all , while other features will still be present . in order to be able to distinguish between sensitive and insensitive features",
    "it is crucial to understand the @xmath1 asymptotics that leads to the frobenius perron dynamics .",
    "it is easy to get a first idea about the way in which finite @xmath0 changes the picture obtained in the thermodynamic limit by comparing fig .  1 with the results of some numerical simulations with finite values of @xmath0 .",
    "2 shows numerical simulations with a decreasing number of subsystems .",
    "one can see clearly , that the details of the attractor of the frobenius perron equation get washed out more and more , the fewer subsystems are involved .",
    "this picture resembles very much the changes in the appearance of attractors caused by small external random perturbations ; a decreasing number of subsystems here corresponds to an increasing noise strength there .",
    "the idea of describing deviations from the thermodynamic limit behaviour as stochastic perturbations is quite obvious , but it is much less easy to specify concretely which properties these stochastic perturbations must have .",
    "pikovsky and kurths @xcite gave heuristic arguments based on the central limit theorem of how to add random perturbations to the frobenius perron dynamics in order to get a proper description of numerical simulations with finite @xmath0 .",
    "while this method works very well for special examples it lacks a solid theoretical justification , so that it is neither clear how widely it is applicable nor how to improve it .",
    "it is the aim of this article to develop an approach to understanding long - term deviations from the thermodynamic limit in globally coupled maps based on _ large deviations _ methods .",
    "this means that we concentrate on the rare but very influential events that in the case of very large but finite @xmath0 render the behaviour of the coupled system perceptibly different from what the thermodynamic limit predicts .",
    "the central object of this approach is a so called quasipotential .    the notion of quasipotentials originated in the physical context from attempts to generalise the idea of a thermodynamic potential to nonequilibrium situations ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "its mathematical foundations were formulated by freidlin and wentzell @xcite .",
    "quasipotentials are asymptotic estimates  on a logarithmic scale  of invariant probability measures of stochastically perturbed dynamical systems with decreasing noise strength .",
    "they have proven to be successful for characterising the stability and sensitivity of attractors with respect to small noise , for estimating noise - induced escape times and transition times between different attractors , and for deriving noise scaling laws which describe the influence of small noise on bifurcation scenarios ; a very short and incomplete list of typical applications may help the reader to trace recent developments in this area : @xcite .    in constructing quasipotentials for the @xmath1-asymptotics in globally coupled maps , a rigorous , abstract identification of finite-@xmath0 effects and random noise",
    "is established , and the above mentioned successes in applying weak - noise quasipotentials can hopefully be repeated for large-@xmath0 quasipotentials .",
    "it should be mentioned that as a starting point for studying large deviations in globally coupled systems we do not use pure globally coupled deterministic maps like ( [ eq:1 - 10 ] ) but globally coupled discrete - time markov processes ( which can be thought of as stochastic perturbations of maps ) .",
    "this extension is interesting for applications and advantageous from a technical point of view .",
    "it is interesting to note that the corresponding ` noisy ' version of the nonlinear frobenius perron equation ( touched upon in @xcite ) is the discrete - time version of the nonlinear fokker - planck equation introduced by desai and zwanzig @xcite .",
    "a quasipotential approach to finite-@xmath0 deviations from the nonlinear fokker - planck equation has been derived by dawson and grtner @xcite and is closely related to the present approach . however , the discrete - time theory described in this paper is clearly conceptually less complicated and easier to use for concrete calculations .",
    "the plan of this article is as follows : in the next section we give a definition of exactly which type of coupled systems we want to investigate .",
    "in addition , that section serves to introduce our notation .",
    "section [ se:3 ] is the theoretical main part of the article .",
    "subsection [ se:3].1 deals with the time - evolution in the thermodynamic limit . in subsection",
    "[ se:3].2 , deviations from the thermodynamic limit in each single time step are studied .",
    "se:3].3 shows how to obtain asymptotic estimates for long - term deviations from the thermodynamic limit by putting together the information about the single time steps and thereby constructing a quasipotential on a space of probability measures . since this",
    "` full ' quasipotential is a rather indigestible object , in subsection [ se:3].4 _ contracted quasipotentials _ are introduced as a way of extracting information about the long - term behaviour of macroscopic variables .",
    "section [ se:4 ] turns to the question , how large-@xmath0 quasipotentials can be computed .",
    "in particular , in subsection [ se:4].1 a discrete - time hamiltonian field theory with constraints is set up , emerging from a variational principle fulfilled by the contracted quasipotentials . while it does not seem to be possible to solve the corresponding hamilton equations in general , one can introduce approximations that lead to an algorithm which is suitable for numerical computations of contracted quasipotentials close to attractors of the dynamics of macroscopic variables .",
    "in subsection [ se:4].2 the ideas and the approximation schemes worked out in this article are illustrated with a simple example of globally coupled linear maps with gaussian noise .    finally , section [ se:5 ] sums up the statements of the paper and indicates in which directions ongoing and planned investigations are heading .",
    "an appendix gives a self - contained proof of theorem [ th:2 ] ( which is one of the main ingredients of the method developed in this article ) .",
    "its first paragraphs can serve as an introduction into the language used for probabilistic arguments throughout this paper ; more details on the relevant basic facts from probability theory can be found in introductory texts like @xcite .",
    "the state of a system which consists of @xmath0 coupled subsystems , each being defined on some state space @xmath16 , can be characterised by an @xmath0-tuple @xmath17 } : = ( x^{[n](1 ) } , \\dots , x^{[n](n ) } ) \\in m^{n},\\ ] ] which we call the configuration of the coupled system .",

    "we assume that @xmath16 is a compact metric space .",
    "( however , the assumption of compactness could be weakened at the cost of a much higher technical effort in most of our considerations . )",
    "the most common case studied in concrete examples is @xmath22 , a closed interval of the real line .",
    "coupling means generally that the subsystems do not follow an individual time evolution , but that the state of any subsystem at a later time depends on the states of other ( and in the case of _ global coupling _ even of all ) subsystems at an earlier time .",
    "we are interested in a form of global coupling which can be incorporated in a measure theoretic way and which is sometimes called _",
    "democratic coupling _ since all elements have equal influence in it .",
    "we first define one of the central objects of our investigation , the _ empirical measure _ connected to a configuration @xmath19}$ ] : @xmath23}_{\\mathbf{x}^{[n ] } }     : = \\frac{1}{n } \\sum_{i=1}^{n } \\delta_{x^{(i ) } }     \\in \\mathcal{p}(m).\\ ] ]    here , @xmath24 denotes the set of borel probability measures @xcite on the subsystem state space @xmath16 , and @xmath25 for @xmath26 is the dirac measure concentrated on @xmath27 which is defined for all borel sets @xmath28 by @xmath29 if @xmath30 and @xmath31 if @xmath32 .",
    "the concept of empirical measures has its origin in statistical estimation , but here it is simply a means of counting how many subsystems are in which state for a given configuration : if @xmath33 and @xmath19}$ ] is the state of the coupled system , then @xmath34}_{\\mathbf{x}^{[n]}}(a)$ ] gives the fraction of subsystems with subsystem state in @xmath35 . the density of the empirical measure ( which for finite @xmath0 is defined only in the distribution sense ) has been called ` snapshot distribution ' by other authors @xcite .",
    "now we define a deterministic temporal evolution of the coupled system with discrete time @xmath36 by @xmath37}_{\\mathbf{x}^{[n]}_{t } } ) .\\ ] ] with a continuous function @xmath38 .",
    "note that the subsystem states @xmath39 carry two indices now , the upper one for numbering the subsystem , and the lower one for denoting the time .",
    "when talking about continuity , we have to specify the topologies which we use . on the state space @xmath16",
    "this is of course the topology derived from the metric on @xmath16 . on the space of probability measures",
    "@xmath24 we use ( unless when mentioned otherwise ) the topology of weak convergence ; a sequence of probability measures @xmath40 is said to converge weakly to @xmath41 if for all bounded continuous functions @xmath42 : @xmath43 we then write @xmath44 .    later we will implicitly make use of the fact , that there is a metric on @xmath24 ( e.  g. , the so called _ lvy - prohorov metric _",
    "@xcite ) which is compatible with the topology of weak convergence , and that compactness of @xmath16 implies compactness of @xmath24 .",
    "it is useful to introduce a real nonnegative parameter @xmath5 as _ coupling strength _ : we study continuous families @xmath45 which have the property that @xmath46 does not depend on its second argument : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a continuous function .",
    "this means that for @xmath49 all subsystems evolve independently of each other according to the map @xmath50 whereas for @xmath51 a global coupling term supervenes the local dynamics . in this sense",
    "the time evolution ( [ eq:2 - 30 ] ) can be regarded as a system of globally coupled maps .",
    "the concept of empirical measures leads to a definition of _ global _ or _ macroscopic _ variables appropriate for globally coupled systems : a macroscopic variable is an observable which depends on the configuration of the coupled system only through its empirical measure .",
    "important examples for @xmath52 are the mean value @xmath53}(\\mathbf{x}^{[n ] } ) : = \\tilde{m}(\\mathcal{e}^{[n]}_{\\mathbf{x}^{[n]}})\\ ] ] with @xmath54 and the mean field @xmath55}(\\mathbf{x}^{[n ] } ) : = \\tilde{h}(\\mathcal{e}^{[n]}_{\\mathbf{x}^{[n]}})\\ ] ] with @xmath56 of a configuration .",
    "the abstract form ( [ eq:2 - 30 ] ) of the time evolution contains the various concrete models of globally coupled maps which have been studied in the literature :    our introductory example ( [ eq:1 - 10 ] ) would correspond to @xmath57 here and in the other models the local map @xmath7 depends on some parameter @xmath6 which usually changes the strength of the nonlinear character of @xmath7 .    however , the choice @xmath58 used by kaneko @xcite has the advantage that there is a built - in guarantee that the right hand side is in @xmath16 as long as @xmath5 is in the interval @xmath59 $ ] .",

    "not surprisingly it is the nonlinearity of ( [ eq:3 - 30 ] ) which opens up the possibility of a much richer dynamical behaviour than what is known from the linear frobenius perron equation and its noisy counterpart ( which is the limiting case of ( [ eq:3 - 30 ] ) in which @xmath98 depends on x only  and not on @xmath99 ( uncoupled case ) ) .",

    "it is very desirable to make this statement more concrete and quantitative , because then we will be in a position to derive predictions about the behaviour of large finite systems from the properties of the map @xmath91 .    in the introduction we gave an example of how the behaviour of a macroscopic variable for a large finite system looks like a stochastically perturbed version of its behaviour in the thermodynamic limit . here ,",

    "as we will see now , for our setting with @xmath132 it plays the same role in the deviation rate as the square of euclidean distance in equation ( [ eq:3 - 60 ] ) ( gaussian noise and @xmath122 ) , which brings us to the central point of this subsection :    [ th:2 ] the process @xmath77}_{\\mathbf{x}^{[n]}_{t}})$ ] is a random perturbation of @xmath124 with large deviation property .",

    "the time delay contracted quasipotential is expected to have a ring - shaped valley along the thermodynamic limit attractor and a hill in the middle of that ring , the height of which is proportional to the critical number of subsystems which is necessary in order to resolve the ring structure in a simulation .",
    "in the preceding section we have built the theoretical fundament for a large deviation type description of the @xmath1 asymptotics for the long term behaviour of globally coupled maps .",

    "this is probably not possible for the general case , but for special choices of @xmath91 there is some hope of being able to simplify equation ( [ eq:4 - 130 ] )  for instance if the maps @xmath320 are piecewise linear in @xmath27 and the noise influence in @xmath91 is weak ( i. e. , if @xmath321 is close to @xmath322 ) .    in view of this problematic situation with",
