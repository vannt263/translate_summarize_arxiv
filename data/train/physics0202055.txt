    "channeling in crystal lattices occurs when an accelerated charged particle is introduced into a crystalline target at sufficiently large energy .",
    "depending on the crystal orientation , the particle s trajectory may be aligned with a major crystal direction and the penetration may reach anomalous depths .",
    "although the possibility of this effect was already pointed out very early by stark @xcite , it was demonstrated experimentally 50 years later by rol _",
    "@xcite , when the result of the ion sputtering was found to depend strongly on the orientation of the target crystal . after the discovery",
    ", the theoretical and experimental work increased rapidly and extended to the case of channeling of electrons and positrons @xcite .",
    "in this paper we will investigate the excitation dynamics of a planar channeled electron under the influence of an external electromagnetic field . as a main result",
    ", we demonstrate that the crystal periodicity introduces a momentum conservation condition which affects the efficiency of the different n - photon channels of excitation , leading to the strong suppression of photon absorption in a broad range of situations .",
    "the multiphoton excitation of channeled particles has been already addressed by avetissian _",
    "_ @xcite by assuming an electromagnetic wave copropagating with the electron , and with a frequency resonant to the ( doppler - shifted ) lower - energy level transitions .",
    "in the present case , however , we are interested in a complementary situation where the channeled electron is excited to a final state lying in the crystal quasi - continuum .",
    "since the transition is produced by the interaction of the electron with an external intense optical field , the strong field approximation ( sfa ) constitutes a more appropriated procedure in comparison to the discrete level approach in @xcite .",
    "sfa theories have been developed in the context of ionization of atoms in strong laser fields . among them ,",
    "the so - called keldish - faisal - reiss ( kfr ) theory @xcite is based on the s - matrix approach , where the final state is approximated by a volkov state , which describes the evolution of a free electron driven by the electromagnetic wave .",
    "sfa theories describe most of the relevant aspects of the atomic ionization , including multiphoton absorption and multiphoton excitation above the ionization threshold ( ati ) .",
    "although employed mainly in the atomic and molecular context , s - matrix sfa approaches can be used in any general situation in which the field interaction energy is comparable with the energies of the matter system .",
    "in fact , for the higher energy boundstates , the intensity of the field required to promote an electron to the continuum does not have to be very high , and yet sfa can be used . on the other hand , sfa requires the matter potential to be approximately constant over the complete interaction time . in our case",
    "it suffices with a moderate intensity field , ( @xmath0 ) , while the crystal stability can be ensured by a sufficiently short pulse ( about @xmath1 ) , which still enclose enough cycles to ensure the adiabatic limit involved in the theoretical approach .",
    "it should be mention that , in the case of atom ionization by strong field , the adiabatic assumption is correct even in the case of a few cycles pulse - length , and there is no reason to think that in this channeling case the thing should be different .",
    "let us consider the interacting geometry depicted in fig .",
    "[ geometry ] . a relativistic electron , with velocity parallel to the @xmath2 ,",
    "is introduced in a crystal while interacting with a copropagating or a counterpropagating electromagnetic wave .",
    "for particular crystal orientations , the electron is confined transversely to trajectories close to the initial injection axis .",
    "our case of planar channeling occurs when the electron is injected parallel to a crystal plane @xcite .",
    "we will assume an electromagnetic planewave field , which propagates in the same direction of the injected electron , and linearly polarized in the @xmath3 , i.e. orthogonal to the crystal plane .",
    "since the channeled particle is injected with a relativistic velocity , the crystal potential may be well approximated by a spatial average over the crystal plane coordinates , as it is done in the so - called continuum model @xcite , @xmath4    where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the crystal plane dimensions , and @xmath7 is the crystal potential . with this effective potential the electron motion in the crystal channel , driven by the external e.m .",
    "field , will be confined to the polarization plane @xmath8 .    in the most general case ,",
    "the quantum description of the electron s dynamics is described by the dirac equation @xmath9    let us first consider the unperturbed channeling situation , @xmath10 . since the averaged potential depends only on the @xmath11 coordinate , a general positive energy solution of the channeled electron can be written as    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is the positive energy solution of a free dirac electron @xcite , @xmath14 ,    @xmath15    introducing ( [ totalsol ] ) into ( [ dirac ] ) , with @xmath10 , one can obtain the following form for the dirac equation in momentum space :    0.1 true in ( 1,0)450 0.1 true in    @xmath16    0.1 true in ( 1,0)450 0.1 true in    2    being @xmath17 the fourier transform of the interplanar potential at the spatial frequency @xmath18 . due to the nature of the averaged potential ,",
    "the channeling along a crystal plane is only possible if the energy of the electron s transversal dynamics is moderate , i.e. non relativistic . in this case , it is justified to approximate equation ( [ d_eq_enp ] ) to second order of @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath20    @xmath21    @xmath22    note that , for the field intensities considered here , this approximation will remain equally valid when considering the interaction with the external electromagnetic wave .    by introducing eq .",

    "several explicit forms of the averaged crystal potential may be found in the literature @xcite . among them , those derived from the thomas - fermi screened two - body potentials have been widely used @xcite , and have been fine adjusted by standard hartree - fock many - body calculations @xcite . from the theoretical point of view , model potentials are more convenient , since they allow for further analytical work while keeping the essential features of the interaction .",
    "for instance , @xmath29 was proposed by avetissian _",
    "@xcite in the context of computation of the multiphoton transitions between bound states of the continuum potential , for a positron interacting with a strong electromagnetic wave .",
    "the form @xmath30 has also been used to study the possible amplification of x - ray channeling radiation @xcite .",
    "this later form has a better resemblance with the averaged thomas - fermi potentials while still allowing for an analytical diagonalization and , therefore , we shall use this potential for our calculations .",

    "note that the number of photons @xmath94 should be an integer quantity , therefore the figure shows clearly that , except for very particular choices of the electron s initial energy , the excitation channels are closed .",
    "the same figure can be done for the case of a copropagating electromagnetic field .",
    "figure [ propagating]a - d show again the possible @xmath94-photon channel excitations as a function of the initial electron s energy , for the lowest orders of transverse momentum transferred assuming the same crystal and laser parameters as in figure [ counterpropagating ] .",
    "an important increase of the number of photons needed to excite the electron , attributable to the doppler redshift , can be observed . under this circumstances , even when the energy and momentum constrains are fulfilled , the process may involve a very small transition probability due to the high number of photons needed .",
    "to give an idea of the order of this probability one can make use of the asymptotic expansion of the bessel functions for large orders , @xmath115 , @xcite , being @xmath116 , to calculate a limit of the number of photons above which the transition probability will be negligible .",
    "the criterion to be used here will be to consider negligible the bessel function when @xmath117 . applying it to our case one obtain the limit of the number of photons for each transverse momentum transferred as a function of the final energy of the electron : @xmath118 where @xmath119 .",
    "assuming that the electron finishes in a state of the crystal quasi - continuum and that the energy along the axial direction do not change significantly during the evolution , one can approximate @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "consequently @xmath122 , and therefore @xmath123 , can be expressed as a function of the initial electron s energy .",
    "figure [ propagating]a - d show with arrows the point when the number of photons required for the excitation process surpass the @xmath123 . for energies above this point , the transition probability reduces drastically and we can consider that no excitation takes place , even though the energy and momentum conservation relations may be fulfilled .",
    "it should be pointed out that eq .",
    "( [ nlimit ] ) is only valid for the case of large orders in the bessel functions .",
    "this means that it should be taken qualitatively in all cases in which @xmath123 is a small quantity , as for instance in figure [ propagating]a for the case @xmath124 .",
    "note also that those cases in which the arrow is not shown correspond to @xmath123 outside the plotting region , i.e. the @xmath94-photon excitation is possible along the complete plotted line .",
    "finally , let us remark the fact that the photon excitation number is greater than in the counterpropagating case increases the sensitivity of the channel process to the selective excitation in terms of the laser parameters .",
    "we have computed the explicit forms of the s - matrix transition probabilities for the n - photon absorption of a relativistic electron channeled along a crystal plane .",
    "in contrast to previous works , we consider the interaction with an intense electromagnetic wave , generated externally , which may excite the electron to high - energy states lying in the crystal quasi - continuum . due to the crystal periodicity",
    ", we show that the energy and momentum conservation equations constraint strongly this excitation process , suppressing the multiphoton absorption except for some particular cases . under these circumstances ,",
    "the selection of a single multiphoton channel of excitation is feasible by an adequate choice of the external laser parameters , opening a broad range of possibilities for the coherent control of the channel electron s dynamics .",
    "the case of an electromagnetic field copropagating with the injected electron is also studied showing an important increase of the number of photons needed to excite the electron due to the doppler redshift . for this case",
    ", we give an estimation of the maximum photon number for which the excitation process is not negligible .",
