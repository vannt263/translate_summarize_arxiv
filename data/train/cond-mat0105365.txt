    "hence , as yet there is no microscopic theory of the quantum dynamics of the domain wall . in order to pave the way for such a theory , this paper presents a field theoretic description of collective degrees of freedom by use of the spin coherent state path integral in the proper discrete - time formalism",

    "the expansion is expected to contain the zero - modes , which originate from the translation and the rotation invariances and should be eventually eliminated in order to avoid overcounting the degrees of freedom . for this reason , we expand the environment with respect to a set of mode functions @xmath53 as [ env ] ( x , n;\\{z}^n_n ) & = & _ 0(n)_0(x;z(n ) ) + ( x , n;\\{z}^n_n),[env1 ] + ^*(x , n;\\{z^*}^n_n ) & = & ^*_0(n)^*_0(x;z^*(n ) ) + ^*(x , n;\\{z^*}^n_n),[env2 ] + ( x , n;\\{z}^n_n ) & = & _ k _ k(n)_k(x;\\{z}^n_n),[env3 ] + ^*(x , n;\\{z^*}^n_n)&= & _ k^*_k(n ) ^*_k(x;\\{z^*}^n_n),[env4 ] where @xmath54 denotes summation over the modes excluding the zero - modes .",
