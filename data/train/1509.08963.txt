    "a complete lipschitz  hankel integral ( lhi ) is an integral transform of a product of one or more bessel or cylindrical functions .",
    "the simplest such integrals are the laplace transforms @xmath0 , where @xmath1 specifies a bessel or modified bessel function , of order  @xmath2 .",
    "it has long been known that each of these laplace transforms can be expressed in  terms of an ( associated ) legendre function  @xcite .    in published tables",
    "@xcite and other reference works @xcite , erroneous evaluations of these integrals have been found ; these are reported in   [ sec : errata ] .",
    "of  the errors in @xcite , most are attributable to inconsistent normalization of the legendre functions ; in particular , of the second legendre function  @xmath3 .",
    "none of @xcite , and at least three other tables in which these integrals appear correctly @xcite , includes a complete set of evaluations . but a complete set of seven can be assembled by merging transforms from different sources , emending as necessary .",
    "such a set is supplied in theorems [ thm:1 ] and  [ thm:2 ] below .",
    "these theorems may prove useful in verifying the entries in databases of definite integrals , and more generally in avoiding errors in symbolic computation .",
    "of  the seven transforms , ( [ eq : j ] )  and  ( [ eq : ip ] ) have recently been used in geometric analysis  @xcite , and ( [ eq : ip ] )  has been used in stochastic analysis  @xcite and path integration  @xcite .",
    "the others also have applications .",
    "each is given here in a compact , trigonometrically parametrized form .",
    "incomplete lhis ( ilhis ) , such as the incomplete integrals @xmath4 that have the laplace transforms @xmath5 as their @xmath6 limits , have recently been applied in electromagnetics  @xcite and communication theory  @xcite .",
    "in particular , @xmath7 and @xmath8 have been applied . for comparison purposes , explicit expressions for @xmath9 and @xmath10 in  terms of legendre functions ,",

    "the transform @xmath11 is also commented  on .",

    "they also include the ferrers functions @xmath15 and @xmath16 , sometimes called legendre functions ` on  the cut , ' which are defined on the complement of @xmath17\\cup[1,\\infty)$ ] and occur most often with @xmath18 ; especially , in physical applications . in the absence of cuts",
    ", all these functions would be multivalued .    in the older english - language literature ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) ,",
    "@xmath19 and @xmath20 were not typographically distinguished , and this remains true in a few recent works ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) . in the german literature ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) ,",
    "they are denoted by @xmath21 and @xmath22 . in the recent nist handbook",

    "the function @xmath3 , defined on the complement of the cut @xmath14 $ ] , has historically been defined in three ways , differing only in normalization .",
    "the most recent ( and perhaps the best ) definition is that of the late fwj olver  @xcite . but for many decades , the standard definition in the literature has been that of ew  hobson  @xcite .",
    "there is also a definition originating with ew  barnes  @xcite , which is no  longer used but was employed in at  least two major works that are still consulted @xcite .",
    "the three definitions are related by @xmath24_h = \\gamma(\\nu+\\mu+1)\\,[q_\\nu^\\mu]_o        = \\frac{\\sin(\\nu\\pi)}{\\sin[(\\nu+\\mu)\\pi]}\\,[q_\\nu^\\mu]_b,\\ ] ] the subscript indicating the originator . in the nist handbook",
    "@xcite , the function of olver is denoted by  @xmath25 , the symbol  @xmath26 being reserved for the standard ( hobson ) function .",
    "but the barnes function , when in use , was never distinguished typographically from that of hobson .",
    "it should be noted that alternative definitions of @xmath27 as  well have been employed ( e.g. , in  @xcite ) .",
    "however , @xmath28  is the chief potential source of confusion .",
    "the following are the complete set of laplace transforms , employing hobson s now - standard definition of  @xmath28 .",
    "they are parametrized to agree with the circular- and hyperbolic - trigonometric versions given in  @xcite .",
    "( except for  @xcite , the other cited works give unnormalized , non - trigonometric forms , but their forms easily reduce to the following . )",
    "each identity has been checked by numerical quadrature .",

    "it is evident from ( [ eq : j])([eq : k ] ) that the interchange symmetry between the pairs @xmath42 and @xmath43 is not reflected in a symmetry between the pairs @xmath44 and  @xmath45 .",
    "the difficulty is the prefactor @xmath46 in  ( [ eq : y ] ) : there is no such prefactor in  ( [ eq : k ] ) .",
