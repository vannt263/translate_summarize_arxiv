    "observations indicate that @xmath17% of all disc galaxies are barred to one degree or another ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "there is considerable debate about the origin and influence of bars , and also about their strengths , something for which there is still no agreed - upon measurement , though many have been suggested ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "curiously , somewhat less attention has been given to the question of bar _ sizes _ , perhaps because this seems , on the face of it , easier to measure  even though there are no agreed - upon methods of measuring bar sizes either ( see the discussions in athanassoula & misiriotis 2002 and aguerri et al .",
    "2003 ) .    is bar size actually important ?",
    "there are , i would argue , several reasons why bar size is interesting , beyond a basic natural historian s curiosity ( `` just how big or small _ are _ they , anyway ? '' ) . to begin with , the size of a bar is first approximation to how much of its host galaxy can be affected by the bars dynamical influence : larger bars can obviously affect more of the galaxy than smaller bars .",
    "in addition to the well - known effects of bars on gas flow , @xcite and @xcite argued that bars can also restructure dark - matter halos , flattening out the steep central cusps which are produced in cosmological simulations but apparently not seen in real galaxies ( but see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "larger bars could then mean larger dark - matter cores .",
    "holley - bockelmann et al .  also argued that tidally - induced bars could be significantly larger than the `` classical '' @xmath18-body bars which form via disc instabilities , so bar size may provide clues to past merger histories .",
    "more generally , bar size is an obvious way of testing the accuracy of different bar - formation and bar - evolution models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "for example , @xcite recently outlined a scenario of galaxy evolution involving multiple rounds of bar formation , self - destruction , and resurrection due to gas accretion ; they predict a trend of bar size with hubble type , where galaxies with larger bulges ( i.e. , earlier hubble types ) have shorter bars . @xmath19-body simulations also suggest that bar size depends on angular momentum exchange between the bar and the bulge , the outer disc , and the halo .",
    "since the relative masses of these components , as well as how kinematically hot they are , can affect how much angular mometum is exchanged ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , bar size could be a useful probe of halo mass and kinematics .",
    "finally , several studies have suggested that longer bars are correlated with higher star formation activity , at least in late - type galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the first systematic investigation of bar sizes was made by @xcite , who found that bar size correlated with galaxy blue luminosity .",
    "subsequently , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter ee85 ) showed that bars in early - type disc galaxies tended to be larger , relative to the optical disc diameter @xmath20 , than bars in later hubble types ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "they also found a dichotomy in bar _ structure _ : early - type galaxies typically have bars with shallow ( `` flat '' ) profiles and truncations ( as noted by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while late - type galaxies tend to have bars with steep exponential profiles .",
    "more recent studies using ccds or near - infrared images include those of @xcite , @xcite , and laurikainen and collaborators @xcite ; these have , in general , supported the findings of kormendy and ee85 .",
    "because a number of these studies have focused on particular subtypes of galaxies , the results are not as general or unbiased as they might otherwise be .",
    "for example , @xcite studied primarily a large sample of starburst galaxies , while the studies of @xcite and @xcite were aimed at seyfert and other `` active '' galaxies .",
    "chapelon et al .",
    "noted that bar sizes for their late - type ( starburst ) galaxies tended to be larger than those of the normal late - type galaxies of @xcite ; similarly , laurikainen et al .",
    "found that seyferts tended to have larger bars than non - seyferts . except for the pioneering studies of kormendy and ee85 , bars in the earliest disc galaxies ",
    "i.e. , s0 galaxies  have been ignored or represented by only a handful of examples .",
    "finally , there has also been a tendency to overlook so - called `` weak '' ( i.e. , sab ) bars : the samples of kormendy and ee85 are almost entirely sb galaxies , and bar sizes were measured by laurikainen et al .  only for galaxies with relatively high",
    "@xmath21 fourier bar amplitudes .",
    "thus , there is still considerable room for improving our understanding of bar sizes in the general population of disc galaxies , especially for s0 galaxies and weak bars .",
    "the relevance of bar size distributions for galaxy evolution was recently highlighted by @xcite , who discussed the visibility of bars as a function of redshift and resolution . put simply , large bars ( size in kpc )",
    "are easier to detect at high redshift than small bars ; if the average bar is small enough , it will be undetectable at high @xmath22 .",
    "failure to account for this possibility can produce spurious changes in bar fraction with redshift .",
    "( we might also like to know if the average bar size has changed significantly between , say , @xmath23 and now , which presupposes a good understanding of local bar sizes . )    in this paper , i take a detailed look at the question of bar sizes along the hubble sequence in the local universe .",
    "the main part of this study uses a diameter - limited sample of nearby , early - type ( s0sb ) disc galaxies with both strong ( sb ) and weak ( sab ) bars .",
    "i measure the bar lengths and compare them with the overall size of the galaxy , using both the 25th - magnitude radius ( @xmath2 ) and the exponential scale lengths of the outer discs .",
    "these are combined with the measurements of @xcite , which also include both sb and sab bars and are primarily of later hubble types ( sbc  sd ) .",
    "i use two samples of galaxies in this paper .",
    "the first is a sample of early - type ( s0sb ) galaxies , using recent @xmath0-band imaging for both bar - size and exponential disc scale length measurements ; both sets of measurements are presented here . to extend this study to later hubble types ,",
    "i have drawn on a second sample , that of @xcite .",
    "this consists primarily of sb  sd galaxies , with bar - size measurements made from blue photographic prints .",
    "the early - type galaxy sample is an expanded version of that presented in @xcite ; i will refer to their original sample as the `` wiyn sample '' ( since most of the observations were made with the 3.5 m wiyn telescope ) .",
    "the wiyn sample consists of all optically barred ( sb + sab ) s0sa galaxies from the ugc catalog @xcite which met the following criteria : declination @xmath24 , heliocentric radial velocity @xmath25 km  s@xmath26 , major axis diameter @xmath27 , and ratio of major to minor axis @xmath28 ( corresponding to @xmath29 ) .",
    "galaxy types and axis measurements ( at the 25 mag arcsec@xmath30 level in @xmath1 ) were taken from ( * ? ? ? * hereafter rc3 ) ; radial velocities are from the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) . the size restriction and",
    "the use of the ugc means that the sample is biased in favor of bright , high surface brightness galaxies .",
    "the sample had a total of 38 galaxies ; i subsequently eliminated four galaxies where bars were either absent , ambiguous , or too difficult to measure ( see the appendix ) , leaving a total of 34 s0sa galaxies .",
    "there is some evidence that hubble types in clusters  in the virgo cluster , at least  do not agree with hubble types of isolated field galaxies @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that virgo sa  sab galaxies had central light concentrations more like those of isolated sb  sc field galaxies .",
    "accordingly , erwin & sparke excluded virgo galaxies from their sample . because the case for s0 galaxies is unclear ( koopman & kenney noted that their sample was strongly incomplete for s0 galaxies , and the few s0 galaxies they studied did not differ significantly between field and virgo  see their figure  1 ) , and because information on bar sizes in s0 galaxies is particularly lacking , i have added bar measurements for eight of the ten barred s0 s in virgo which meet the criteria given above , except for the redshift limit .",
    "( the redshift limit was intended to set a distance limit of @xmath31 mpc for the field galaxies ; if it were applied to the virgo cluster , which lies well within that distance , it would improperly exclude cluster galaxies with high peculiar velocities . )    to make the coverage of hubble types more complete , i have also added galaxies from an ongoing study of barred sab and sb galaxies ( erwin , vega beltrn & beckman , in preparation ) .",
    "the selection criteria are identical , aside from the difference in hubble type , leading to a total of 9 sab and 18 sb galaxies ; two of each type appear to be unbarred , and are not considered further ( see the appendix ) .",
    "the final early - type sample thus has a total of 65 strongly and weakly barred s0sb galaxies .",
    "all of these galaxies , grouped by hubble type , are listed in table  [ tab : galaxies ] , along with the parameters of their bars and outer discs .",
    "the sample which best complements mine is that of @xcite : it is large and drawn from ordinary , optically barred galaxies ( including both sb and sab classes ) , contains both observed and deprojected bar lengths , and is almost entirely sb or later in hubble type . to make the match between samples as close as possible",
    ", i applied the same selection criteria to martin s galaxies : sb or sab bar classification , major axis @xmath32 , axis ratio @xmath33 , and radial velocity @xmath34 km  s@xmath26 .",
    "martin argued that deprojection was unreliable for magellanic galaxies ( sm and i m ) , so i follow him in excluding those types .",
    "i also removed three virgo galaxies ( ngc  4303 , ngc  4321 , and ngc  4394 ) and eliminated ngc  4395 , which is classed as sa in rc3 ; for the three galaxies in common between the samples ( see below ) , i retain my measurements .",
    "this leaves a total of 75 galaxies from his sample , still large enough for a good comparison ; the bulk of these ( 70 ) are sb  sd .",
    "to these i added distances and total blue magnitudes , mostly from leda ( see appendix  [ app : m95 ] for details ) .",
    "although the underlying sample selection was different ( martin s galaxies were taken from the sandage - bedke atlas ) , the relative numbers of different hubble types are consistent with local populations .",
    "for example , my sample has 24 s0/a  sab galaxies compared with 56 sbc  scd galaxies in martin s sample ; the ratio of late to early types ( 2.3 ) is similar to that found in rc3 for galaxies with @xmath35 and @xmath36 ( 480 sbc ",
    "scd galaxies versus 199 s0/a ",
    "sab , for a ratio of 2.4 ) .",
    "this suggests that the combined set provides a reasonable picture of bar sizes for the hubble sequence down to sd ( martin s sample has very few sdm or sm galaxies ) , at least for bright galaxies ( median @xmath37 for my s0sb galaxies and @xmath38 for martin s sb  sd ; see figure  [ fig : absmags ] ) .    for the early - type galaxies , the measurements of bar size and shape , and of disc sizes ,",
    "are discussed in sections  [ sec : measure - bars][sec : measure - discs ] , below . in section  [ sec : m95 ] , i discuss how the published bar sizes of @xcite can best be compared with my measurements , and how i obtained disc scale lengths for martin s galaxies .",
    "observations of the original wiyn sample ( s0sa galaxies ) are presented and discussed in detail by @xcite . all but two of the galaxies were observed in @xmath1 and @xmath0 with the 3.5 m wiyn telescope at kitt peak , arizona , between 1995 december and 1998 march .",
    "images for ngc  936 and ngc  4314 were taken from the bars project observations @xcite ; in a few cases , additional images from other sources were used for outer - disc or bar measurements ( see the appendix for details ) .",
    "images of the barred virgo s0 galaxies and the sab  sb galaxies are from a variety of sources , including the wiyn telescope ( 1995 march through 1998 march ) ; the 2.4 m mdm telescope at kitt peak , courtesy paul schechter ( 1996 march ) ; the 2.5 m nordic optical telescope in la palma ( 2001 april and 2002 april ) ; and the isaac newton group archive ( images from both the 1 m jacobus kapteyn telescope and the 2.5 m isaac newton telescope ) .",
    "the outer - disc scale lengths for several galaxies were measured using images taken with the isaac newton telescope in 2004 march ; these observations will be described in more detail in erwin , pohlen , & beckman ( in preparation ) .",
    "i also used observations from the bars project ( for ngc  4151 and ngc  4596 ) and @xmath39- or @xmath0-band images from the sample of @xcite for a number of galaxies .",
    "specific details for individual galaxies are discussed in the appendix .    except where noted in the appendix ( cases where dust severely distorted bar isophotes in the optical images ) ,",
    "all bar and outer - disc scale length measurements were made with @xmath0-band or equivalent images .",
    "for sab and sb galaxies , these measurements were usually checked against measurements made with near - ir images ; the agreement was generally very good .",
    "parameters for these galaxies are listed in table  [ tab : galaxies ] .",
    "most distances are from leda ( exceptions are discussed in the appendix ) ; the latter are based on redshifts corrected for virgocentric infall , as listed in leda , and assuming @xmath40 km  s@xmath26 kpc@xmath26 .",
    "for virgo galaxies , i assumed a default distance to the virgo cluster of 15.3 mpc @xcite , except for ngc  4754 , for which a surface - brightness fluctuation measurement by @xcite is available .",
    "note that distance measurements , and their uncertainties , only affect the _ absolute _ sizes of bars ; relative bar sizes are distance - independent .",

    "after some experimentation , i settled on two measurements , an approach i also used for the outer and inner bars of double - barred galaxies @xcite .",
    "these can be thought of as lower and upper limits on the bar size .",
    "the lower - limit measurement is @xmath42 , the semimajor axis of maximum ellipticity in the bar region , which is useful primarily because it is common and reproducible . in some cases",
    ", there is no clear ellipticity peak associated with the bar ; but a corresponding extremum in the _ position angles _ can often be found which serves the same purpose ; examples include ngc  2880 and ngc  4143 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "it is important to stress that i identify @xmath42 with the maximum in ellipticity ( or maximum deviation in position angle ) _ closest to the end of the bar , but still inside the bar_. in some cases , particularly when there are strong dust lanes and/or star formation , the inner isophotes can become highly distorted and _ more _ elliptical than the bar proper ; examples include ngc  2787 , ic  676 , and ngc  4691 ( erwin & sparke 2003 )",
    ". for ngc  4691 , from ellipse fits to 2mass images . ] in other cases , the bar merges so smoothly into spiral arms further out that the `` obvious '' maximum in ellipticity occurs well outside the bar and is due to spiral arms or a ring .",
    "examples of this include ngc  3185 and ngc  7743 ( erwin & sparke 2003 ) ; another good example , albeit a galaxy not in this study , is ngc  4303 ( see the discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "despite the relative simplicity and common use of @xmath42 , there is good reason to believe that it underestimates the true length of the bar .",
    "this has been pointed out by several authors @xcite , and @xcite found that it generally provided the smallest estimates of bar length in their @xmath18-body simulations . thus there is a need for a second ( `` upper - limit '' ) measurement , which i refer to as the bar s `` length '' @xmath45 .",
    "this is based on the approach of @xcite , where the bar length was defined as the _ minimum _ of two ellipse - fit measures : the first minimum in ellipticity outside the bar s peak ellipticity ( @xmath43 ) , or the point at which the position angles of the fitted ellipses differ by @xmath112 from the bar s position angle . to their definition",
    ", i have added a qualification : if the bar is surrounded by a ring or spiral arms , and the size of the ring ( or arms , where they intersect the bar ) is smaller than either @xmath113 or @xmath114 , then i adopt the ring / spiral size .",
    "this is because chance combinations of orientation and projection acting on the ring or spirals can lead to ellipse - fit profiles that place @xmath113 and @xmath114 well _ outside _ the bar .",
    "since there is no indication in any of these galaxies that the bar extends beyond the ring or surrounding spirals , it makes sense to use the latter as an upper limit on bar size .",

    "the @xmath45 measurement is perhaps less consistent and accurate than @xmath42 ( it is prone to strongly overestimate bar length in face - on galaxies lacking rings or spiral arms ) , but may give a better measure of the bar s `` true '' length  that is , where the bar distortion finally gives way to the outer disc or spiral structure .",
    "the only galaxy where it clearly fails is ngc  4203 , which is face - on and lacking in any spiral arms or rings , so that @xmath115 even though @xmath116 ; consequently , i exclude that galaxy from statistics using @xmath45 .    in practice ,",
    "the two measurements are extremely well correlated ( figure  [ fig : amax - v - lbar ] ) ; the pearson and spearman correlation coefficients are @xmath117 and @xmath118 , respectively .",
    "the mean ( deprojected ) ratio of @xmath119 is 0.80 .",
    "this is not too far from the mean ratio ( 0.73 ) of sizes for the @xmath120 and @xmath121 measurements of @xcite , which suggests that those two @xmath18-body bar measurements are a good match to @xmath42 and @xmath45 ( see section  [ sec : sims ] ) .    ) and bar length ( @xmath45 ; see text for definition )  for s0sb galaxies .",

    "the position angles of the bars are also needed , since i use them to deproject bar sizes . as shown by @xcite , ellipse fits",
    "are a problematic source for bar position angles .",
    "their table  5 lists 11 large - scale bars whose position angles differ from those given by the ellipse fits by more than 5 ; see their figures  5 and 6 for examples . thus , bar position angles are _ always _ checked against the images , and the position angle determined from the isophotes and unsharp masking is preferred to the ellipse - fit position angle if the two differ by more than a couple of degrees .    finally , the inclination and line - of - nodes of the galaxy discs need to be determined .",
    "the easiest approach is to use the rc3 axis ratios and position angles and assume that the outer disc is circular .",
    "unfortunately , this is by no means the most accurate way , especially for early - type barred galaxies .",
    "this is because the rc3 axis ratios sometimes reflect bar - related features such as inner rings , lenses , and outer rings , which are more common in early - type disc galaxies and which are _ not _ always intrinsically circular @xcite .",
    "so i determined the outer disc orientation , where possible , using kinematic information ( e.g. , hi maps ) and/or isophotes at diameters larger than @xmath20 .",

    "another way to define a bar is by its `` strength . ''",
    "this too lacks an obvious , universally agreed - upon definition .",
    "the simplest way to measure a bar s strength is to measure its _ shape _ , usually reduced to measuring its `` ellipticity . '' for theorists ,",
    "this often means the ellipticity of the bar itself ( e.g. , that of a ferrers ellipsoid ) , but for observers  lacking the ability to unambiguously isolate the bar from other galactic components  it usually means measuring the semi - minor axis of the _ isophote _ defined by the bar length ( usually @xmath42 ) and comparing it with the semimajor axis .",
    "this is approximately the method used by @xcite to define bar strengths , and also by @xcite and @xcite for fitted ellipses defining bars . for comparison ,",
    "if no other reason , it makes sense to do the same .",
    "a more complex approach , which attempts to estimate the non - axisymmetric gravitational influence of the bar , is that of @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , this generally requires near - ir images , and assumes that the entire galaxy is flat with a constant scale height . for bars in late - type galaxies , where the bulge is small or even absent ,",
    "this is probably reasonable ; but for early - type galaxies , large bulges  and possibly multiple disc components with different thicknesses  make this a questionable assumption .",
    "( more recently , laurikainen et al .",
    "2004 have an included a spherical bulge component in the modeling process , which alleviates some of the problems . ) happily , @xcite find that the bar strength measured this way correlates quite well with bar ellipticity .",
    "galaxies come in many sizes , and what might be a large bar in one galaxy would be small in another .",
    "thus , although absolute measurements of bars size ( in kpc ) are useful , we also need some kind of relative measurement . what should we compare bar sizes with ?",
    "the simplest approach is to follow @xcite and @xcite : compare the bar size to the optical disc size @xmath20 , which is available for all the galaxies .",
    "since i measure bar semimajor axes , i use @xmath123 for the disc size . to be consistent with martin s measurements ,",
    "i use the @xmath97 values from rc3 , which are corrected for inclination ( usually a very small effect ) and for galactic extinction .",
    "another useful measurement is the exponential scale length of the disc .",
    "@xcite argued that bars in late - type galaxies should extend to approximately one disc scale length , and @xcite suggested that the correlation they observed between bar size ( @xmath124 ) and @xmath20 implied that bars `` extend to a fixed number of radial scale lengths in the disk . ''",
    "bar sizes in terms of disc scale lengths are also much easier to compare with simulations , since exponential scale lengths for @xmath18-body discs are easily measured .    for those galaxies in which an outer exponential disc can be identified ,",
    "i derive its slope by fitting the region _ outside the bar _ , using an azimuthally averaged surface - brightness profile .. ] this is the classic approach of `` marking the disc '' by eye . in principle , more accurate scale lengths might be derived by performing a bulge - disc decomposition , so that the contribution of bulge light to the outer disc profile is accounted for .",
    "i do _ not _ attempt this , however , since many of these galaxies are strongly barred and/or contain luminous central structures apart from the bulge ( secondary bars , inner discs , or nuclear rings ) . in extreme cases , these non - bulge components can dominate the interior light @xcite , and attempting to fit them with , e.g. , a de vaucouleurs or srsic profile could assign too much light at large radii to the `` bulge '' and distort the disc fit . since i am deliberately fitting only the region outside the bar , the effect of bulge light in most cases is minimized . in any event",
    ", @xcite found that the change in derived scale length between marking the disc and more sophisticated decomposition techniques was typically only a few percent .",
    "a comparison of my disc scale lengths with those of @xcite , which were obtained via bulge - disc decompositions , show a similarly small variation ; see section  [ sec : m95 ] below .",
    "details for unusual cases are provided in the appendix , along with notes for galaxies where severely non - exponential outer discs prevented determining an exponential scale length .",
    "another reason for fitting the outer disc only is shown in figure  [ fig : n4151 ] . although it is sometimes argued that bars vanish from the surface - brightness profile when it is averaged , leaving behind only the underlying exponential disc ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , this is not always true : the bar can sometimes appear as a clear , significant excess above the ( outer ) exponential profile ( see also * ? ? ? * ) . none the less , if we exclude the bar region and any excess just outside it , we can still distinguish an unambiguous outer exponential profile in such galaxies ( see erwin , pohlen , & beckman , in preparation , for details ) .",

    "the vertical , short - dashed lines indicate deprojected bar - size measurements @xmath42 and @xmath45 ; the diagonal , long - dashed line is an exponential fit to the disc region outside the bar ( @xmath125 , excluding the ring excess at @xmath126260 ) .",
    "note the excess light at @xmath127100 , which is primarily due to the bar . ]    however , in other galaxies the outer disc does not have a single exponential profile . for 16 galaxies , the profile outside",
    "the bar is what @xcite termed a `` type  ii '' profile : it is divided into _ two _ ( usually ) exponential zones : a shallow inner zone and a steeper outer zone ( see figure  [ fig : n3945 ] for an example ) . in such cases , it is not at all clear which of the two zones  if either  should be considered the `` true '' outer disc . in at least some cases ( e.g. , ngc  2859 , 3412 , 2962 , 5701 , and 6654 ) , the inner zone is extremely narrow and/or shallow in slope , or even _ increasing _ in brightness with radius .",

    "there are additional galaxies where the surface brightness profile at large radii is shallower than that of disc immediately outside the bar ; these are the `` type iii '' or `` anti - truncation '' profiles discussed in @xcite .",
    "because these galaxies _ do _ have an extended , well - defined exponential zone outside the bar , i include their scale length measurements .",

    "the bba98 fits differ from mine in using major - axis cuts from @xmath131-band photographic images , and in using bulge - disc decompositions with an optional `` hole '' in the disc .",
    "since the `` bulge '' component ( i.e. , the central excess over the exponential disc , which bba98 model with a de vaucouleurs profile ) in late - type galaxies is generally smaller and less luminous than in earlier types , the effect on the disc fit is reduced .",
    "the optional hole in their disc model , which is intended to account for type  ii profiles , introduces a new problem , however : it forces the bulge component to account for all the inner light ( including , e.g. , the inner part of the disc and the bar ) .",
    "since the bulge model is not truncated , it ends up contributing more light at large radii than the true bulge probably does , and can thus distort the disc fit .",

    ", an increasingly popular idea has been that bars can drive long - term ( `` secular '' ) evolution of disc galaxies , perhaps even helping to determine the present - day hubble sequence .",
    "the general argument is that bars , through gas inflow and vertical buckling , create or amplify bulges , thus shifting a galaxy from smaller to larger bulge / disc ratio ( e.g. , from being an sc galaxy to being an sb or sa galaxy ) .",
    "in addition , it is suggested that the increasing central mass concentration produced by bar - driven gas inflow can end up turning the bar _ into _ a bulge .",
    "this is because a sufficiently strong central mass concentration can apparently _ destroy _ a bar , producing an axisymmetric , bulgelike remnant @xcite .    a recent elaboration on the scenario of secular evolution via bar dissolution , with specific predictions for bar _ sizes _ , is that of @xcite .",
    "multiple rounds of a sequence where bars form , weaken or are destroyed via mass inflow , and then reform due to gas accretion by the disc ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in their simulations ,",
    "later ( i.e. , second , third , or even fourth ! ) bars are progressively _ shorter _ than earlier bars .",
    "the implication is that early - type spirals ( and s0 s ) , whose larger bulges are built out of multiple rounds of bar formation and bar - driven inflow , should have smaller bars .",
    "unfortunately , this is clearly incompatible with the hubble sequence as we see it today .",
    "however , secular changes in bar size may still be relevant if we drop the idea of bar destruction .",
    "most of the @xmath18-body bars mentioned in the previous section have sizes measured near the end of the simulation , and can thus be considered `` mature '' bars .",
    "but in almost all @xmath18-body simulations , bars lose angular momentum , slow down , and increase in length as time goes by : older bars are longer than younger bars .",
    "the growth is usually fairly mild , but can sometimes be dramatic  for example , @xcite mention that the bar in their @xmath255 simulation _ triples _ in absolute length ( from 1.5 to 4.55 kpc ) between @xmath256 and 6 gyr . since the disc scale length varies by @xmath257% , the _",
    "relative _ size of the bar also triples , from @xmath258 to @xmath259 .",
    "this neatly spans the range in typical relative sizes between sc ",
    "sd galaxies and sa  sb galaxies ( table  [ tab : sizes - all ] and figure  [ fig : h - size - all ] ) .",
    "could the difference in bar sizes between early- and late - type galaxies , or the scatter in sizes for a given region of the hubble sequence , be at least partly a matter of bar _ age _ ?",
    "this might also explain the lack of a correlation between bar size and other galaxy properties , especially disc scale length , for the late - type galaxies ( section  [ sec : hubble - seq ] ) , if disc scale length primarily affects or determines the _ final _ size of a bar .",
    "bars in sc ",
    "sd galaxies would then be young and/or still growing rapidly , and thus less likely to show correlations with disc size .",
    "this idea  younger , shorter , and fast - growing bars in sc  sd galaxies , older and longer bars in early - type galaxies  is also consistent with the simulations and arguments of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they combined @xmath18-body simulations with gas and star formation , and noted that `` young '' bars ( @xmath260 myr old in their simulations ) had star formation concentrated along the bar major axis , something observed in at least some sbc galaxies , while older bars tended to have star formation confined to the nucleus , the ends of the bars , and an inner ring / spiral surrounding the bar , a pattern more often seen in early - type galaxies .",
    "based on this , they suggested that barred sc galaxies could evolve into barred sb galaxies .",
    "( the fact that subsequent star formation is generally restricted to the ends of the bar and an inner ring might also indicate that star formation helps transform late - type `` exponential '' bars into early - type `` flat '' bars , by preferentially adding stars near the ends of the bar . )",
    "it would be interesting to see if there is a correlation between star - formation patterns and bar sizes in , e.g. , sbc  sd galaxies : are smaller bars in fact more likely to have `` young '' star - formation patterns ?",
    "there is actually a hint of this in the sample of @xcite : they classified eleven bars into three categories ( a , b , c ) based on the distribution of hii regions , and then associated these categories with increasing age , based on their simulations .",
    "the mean relative bar sizes of the three groups are , in order of increasing age , @xmath261 , 0.28 , and 0.32 , which does agree with the scenario ; but the sample is really too small for this to be a valid test .",
    "a problem with this idea is the fact that , in the few simulations where gas has been included and bar length at different times is reported ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the bar does _ not _ grow significantly ; it may even _ shrink _ slightly .",
    "this may be because the bar gains angular momentum from the gas inflow it drives , thus keeping its pattern speed constant or increasing and keeping corotation at a small radius .",
    "this would seem to mean that bars in sc ",
    "sd galaxies , which generally have abundant gas , should not grow significantly ; this might even help explain why their bars are generally small",
    "! it may be that once enough of the gas within corotation has been exhausted ( e.g. , converted to stars ) , the bars _ can _ grow ; but whether this is possible , and whether the bars can grow large enough , awaits further simulation .",
    "( both of the studies mentioned above produced bars larger than those of typical _ early_-type galaxies , so it is nt clear how relevant they are to late - type bars . )    the alternative to these scenarios of secular evolution is that there is something fundamentally different between early- and late - type disc galaxies , which is reflected in their different bar properties .",
    "it would be fruitful to examine more carefully why some simulations produce larger bars than others ( see , for example , the discussions in * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and whether there are any parameters ( e.g. , relative halo mass , halo structure and kinematics , and in particular gas content ) which can reliably produce the small bars of late - type galaxies .    on a separate note ,",
    "it is interesting to compare the field and virgo s0 galaxies in my sample .",
    "a popular scenario for creating _ cluster _",
    "s0 galaxies is ram - pressure stripping of spirals which fall into a cluster and encounter its intracluster medium at high speed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "if removal of a spiral galaxy s gas  and subsequent aging of its stellar population without new star formation  is _ all _ that happens , then we might expect other properties , such as bar size , to remain unchanged .",
    "since the most numerous bright spiral types are sbc and sc ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we should on average see smaller bars in cluster s0 s ",
    "_ if _ conversion of infalling spirals is the primary formation mechanism .",
    "however , as i showed in section  [ sec : early - sizes ] , virgo cluster s0 s tend if anything to have _ larger _ bars than field s0 s , and their bars are certainly consistent with the general field s0sb population .",
    "this suggests that cluster s0 s are probably not just stripped and aged spirals , or else that they are preferentially formed from _ early - type _ spirals .",
    "quilis et al .",
    "note that other mechanisms may be needed to produce larger bulges and thicker discs in stripped spirals in order to make the end products more like s0 galaxies ; such mechanisms must also , it seems , ensure that cluster s0 s end up with large bars .",
    "although the samples analyzed here do not extend to very faint magnitudes , there is no evidence for any trend in _ relative _ bar size with magnitude or @xmath2 ( figure  [ fig : size - v - size ] ) .",
    "this suggests that smaller and fainter galaxies should follow the general bar - size  luminosity and bar - size  disc - size correlations found here , at least for hubble types earlier than sc .",
    "so if high-@xmath22 galaxy samples include significant numbers of faint galaxies , they will probably include bars which are small in absolute ( kpc ) terms , and thus difficult to detect .     versus disc size ( top ) and galaxy luminosity ( bottom ) for s0sb galaxies .",
    "relative bar size shows no correlation with either galaxy size or luminosity ; this suggests that galaxies smaller and/or less luminous than the sample probably have a similar range of relative bar sizes . ]",
    "the important point is that  in the absence of any evolutionary effects  the absolute size of bars , and thus their detectability , depends on the size , luminosity , and hubble types of the galaxies being studied .",
    "thus , a proper measure of bar fractions as a function of redshift requires careful sample selection : the low - redshift and high - redshift samples must contain galaxies with a similar distribution of disc sizes or absolute magnitudes .",
    "the latter is probably easier to achieve , but evolutionary corrections will almost certainly need to be applied .",
    "disc isophotal size will probably also evolve with redshift , in ways perhaps less easy to model .",
    "( recall the subtle bias introduced by an isophotal size limit in my sample , leading to an sb subsample with smaller scale lengths and absolute bar sizes than the s0sab bars ; see section  [ sec : early - sizes ] . )",
    "the best sample - matching might therefore be in terms of disc scale lengths  assuming , of course , that _ they _ do not evolve significantly .",
    "recently , @xcite analyzed the detectability of bars and spiral structure with redshift by artificially redshifting and resampling @xmath1-band images from the ohio state university bright spiral galaxy survey ( bsgs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to match @xmath262 hubble deep field ( hdf ) exposures .",
    "they argued that most of the strong bars in the bsgs galaxies would still be detectable at @xmath263 ; the apparent absence of such bars in real hdf galaxies at @xmath264 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is then , they suggest , a genuine effect . but lurking behind this is the assumption that the bsgs is a reasonable match to high-@xmath22 hdf galaxies . as their figure  2 shows , the bsgs does live up to its name : the magnitude distribution peaks at @xmath265 , and essentially all of the galaxies are brighter than the _ mean _ magnitude ( @xmath266 ) of local spirals found by @xcite .",
    "van den bergh et al .  noted that deep _",
    "images , such as the hdf , will sample significantly fainter galaxies , even in the absence of luminosity evolution .",
    "this means that  assuming no _ bar _ evolution  the average bar in the hdf sample will probably be smaller ( in kpc ) than the average bsgs bar , and therefore harder to detect ( see the discussion of bar - size detectability versus redshift in * ? ? ?",

    ", @xcite found at least four barred galaxies with @xmath16 in the hdf by using nicmos images , which suggests that bandshifting effects are important .",
    "more recent studies based on higher - resolution acs imaging @xcite find comparable fractions of bars at low and high @xmath22 ; this is eloquent confirmation of the parallel importance of resolution , as sheth et al .  also emphasized .",
    "sheth et al .  reported an average bar semimajor axis of 6 kpc for their high-@xmath22 , nicmos - detected bars , and argued that this was unusually large when compared with local galaxies  specifically , when compared with the bima survey of nearby galaxies ( song ) sample . but are the bars they found really so large ?",

    "the sb galaxies in my sample appear to have smaller bars relative to @xmath2 in comparison to the s0sab galaxies because the sb galaxies have , on average , _ larger _ values of @xmath133 .",
    "a diameter - limited selection criterion then leads to smaller average scale lengths for these galaxies and thus bars with smaller average absolute sizes ( @xmath279 kpc ) as well .",
    "as has been noted earlier , bars in early - type ( s0sb ) galaxies are larger than those in late - type ( sc  sd ) galaxies .",
    "this is true regardless of how bar size is measured ; bar size relative to disc scale length appears to be the most robust measurement , and the least vulnerable to selection effects . on average ,",
    "early - type bars are @xmath279 times larger than late - type bars , which have mean sizes of @xmath12 kpc , 0.14 @xmath2 , and 0.6 @xmath3 .",
    "sbc galaxies have bars intermediate in size between the early and late types .",
    "early - type bars show strong correlations of bar size with @xmath2 and @xmath3 ; these correlations are stronger than the known correlation of bar size with @xmath15 . but late - type bars as a whole show only weak correlations of bar size with @xmath2 and @xmath15 , and _ no _ correlation with @xmath3 at all .",
    "strong ( sb ) and weak ( sab ) bars in early - type galaxies differ primarily in ellipticity ; they are very similar in size .",
    "but late - type galaxies exhibit a real dichotomy : sb bars in sc ",

    "comparison with local bars shows that the recently discovered @xmath16 bars of @xcite have sizes typical of those in _ early_-type ( s0sb ) galaxies .",
    "because bar size scales with disc size ( and , less strongly , with @xmath15 ) for all but the latest hubble types , and because smaller bars are harder to detect at high redshift , attempts to compare bar frequencies at different redshifts must be careful to use similar samples of galaxies  ideally samples with similar disc scale lengths .",
