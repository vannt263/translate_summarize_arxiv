    "directed polymer in random media ( dprm)@xcite is one of the simplest statistical mechanical models in which quenched randomness plays non - trivial roles as in spin - glasses .",
    "it is an effective model of an elastic string in random environment , such as a vortex line in oxide cuprate superconductor which penetrates the stacked @xmath3 layers with point defects scattered randomly over the layers . in transverse dimensions @xmath4 less than two",
    ", there is no _ free phase _ but a _ pinned phase _ ,",
    "i.e. the polymer is mostly pinned around the ground state and can not move freely at any finite temperature .",
    "however there are anomalously large thermal fluctuation due to the thermal hoppings between the excited states which are nearly degenerate with the ground state but located far away .",
    "they are analogous to the droplet excitations in spin - glass phase@xcite and bring about non - trivial effects in the pinned phase@xcite .",
    "one naturally expects that they have dramatic effects also on the dynamics .",
    "actually , it has been argued in the theory of the transport problem in the vortex glass phase that they are responsible for the nonlinear current - voltage response@xcite .",
    "our interest in the present study is the slow relaxation to equilibrium due to such anomalous thermal hoppings .",
    "we expect that they bring about aging effects , which are to some extent similar to those found in the spin - glass phase . in order to clarify this possibility , we performed temperature quench experiments by a simple heatbath monte carlo dynamics .",
    "the procedure mimic the so called irm experiments in spin - glasses@xcite but the system is perturbed by a small _ tilt _ field which drives one end of the polymer instead of magnetic field in spin - glasses which drives the whole spins .    we have found clear evidences of the aging effects .",
    "one is the systematic waiting time dependence on the dynamical overlap function .",
    "the crossover behavior from quasi - equilibrium to off - equilibrium behavior and its scaling properties are , interestingly enough , very similar to that found in the spin - autocorrelation function of the 3 dimensional spin - glass model@xcite .",
    "the 2nd is the break down of the fluctuation dissipation theorem ( fdt ) associated with the response to the tilt field . again",
    "the correlation function which is conjugate with the response function shows clear waiting time dependence . on the other hand ,",
    "in contrast with the case of spin - glasses , the response function itself does not show waiting time dependence .",
    "the fdt which relates the two breaks down at @xmath2 , which coincide with the crossover behavior in the dynamical overlap function .    in our analysis",
    "we also utilize the transfer matrix method for the following two purposes .",
    "firstly , we check the consistency between the static limit of the data of the dynamical quantities and the static expectation values .",
    "secondly we study the relation between the complex free energy landscape and the relaxational dynamics .",
    "actually we could visually monitor the thermal jumps between the excited states .",
    "the structure of the web of the excited states is very complex which consists of numerous loop - like structures of various sizes ( see fig .  3 below ) .",
    "since this model is rather simpler than spin - glass models , we believe that understanding the dynamics of this model would give valuable insight into the glassy dynamics of more complicated systems .",
    "this paper is organized as the following . in section 2",
    "we describe our model and introduce the monte carlo dynamics . in section 3 , the elementary process of the dynamics is studied combining with the analysis of the free energy landscape by the transfer matrix method . in section 4 ,",
    "the procedure of the temperature quench experiment is described .",
    "the results are given in section 5 . in section 6",
    "we conclude this paper with some phenomenological arguments .",
    "we study a lattice version of 1 + 1 dimensional directed polymer in random media ( dprm ) .",
    "the hamiltonian is @xmath5 =   \\sum_{z=1}^{n } \\left\\ { g|x(z)-x(z+1)|+\\mu(x(z),z ) \\right\\ } -hx(n)\\ ] ] where @xmath6 @xmath7 represents the configuration of the polymer whose length is @xmath8 . as shown in fig .  1 ,",
    "the polymer is situated on a square lattice and _ directed _ along the @xmath9-axis so that overhangs are excluded .",
    "we impose the so called restricted solid on solid ( rsos ) condition , i.e. the steps @xmath10 are only allowed to take integer values @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "we fix one end @xmath13 at @xmath14 while we allow the other end @xmath15 to move freely .",
    "the 1st term in the hamiltonian represents the elastic energy .",
    "the 2nd term represents the random potential which takes random numbers distributed uniformly over @xmath16 independently on every lattice site on the square lattice .",
    "the last term is the tilt field which drives the free end and _ tilts _ the polymer .",
    "we model the relaxational dynamics of the present model by an ordinary heatbath monte carlo dynamics as in the following way . in one micro monte carlo step ( micro - mcs ) , one segment , say the segment at @xmath17 is tried to move .",
    "the new position is chosen among the possible choices allowed by the rsos condition with the appropriate transition probabilities so as to satisfy the detailed balance condition .",
    "as shown in fig .  2 , this micro - mcs can be classified into three cases depending on the positions of the neighboring segments at @xmath18 and @xmath19 , namely case a ) , b ) and c ) which corresponds to @xmath20 , @xmath12 and @xmath21 respectively .",
    "the entire configuration is refreshed by vectorized sublattice flippings in one monte calro step ( mcs ) ( = n micro - mcs ) .",
    "one sublattice consists of the even numbered segments @xmath22 and the other sublattice consists of the odd numbered segments @xmath23 .",
    "in this section we consider the elementary processes of the relaxational dynamics in the present model . in any quenched random systems , it is generally essential to understand the structure of the free energy landscape in order to study the slow relaxational dynamics , which is unfortunately very hard to do on spin - glass models .",
    "thanks to the simplicity of the model , we can try such an attempt on the present model in the following way .",
    "we consider the spatial variation of @xmath24 : the probability to find the polymer going through a particular lattice point @xmath25 on a certain sample of random potential @xmath26 .",
    "it is defined as @xmath27 ) \\ ] ] where the sum is taken over the all possible configurations ( or paths ) @xmath28 and @xmath29 is the normalization factor defined so that @xmath30 .",
    "it is straightforward to calculate this probability by transfer matrix method @xcite . in fig .  3 ,",
    "an example of the spatial variation of @xmath24 of a system of @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 on a certain sample of random potential @xmath26 is displayed by a density plot ; the intensity increases as the color becomes brighter .",
    "we recognize that most of the probability density is confined in the white _ tubes _ which are understood as the thermally active excited states . in the dynamics",
    ", they presumably serve as _ traps _",
    "@xcite , which tend to trap the polymer for long times .",
    "on the other hand there are black _ voids _ between the tubes which presumably serve as free energy barriers .",
    "it is quite remarkable that the tubes form a very complicated network which consists of various sizes of loop - like structures .",
    "it is qualitatively consistent with the prediction by hwa and fisher@xcite who have predicted a broad distribution of the size of the loops .",
    "as the temperature increases , one can observe that the diameter of the tubes grows and the structure itself changes on large scales as predicted in@xcite .    from the above observation",
    ", we speculate that the dynamics of the polymer roughly consists of the two kinds of elementary processes .",
    "one is the fast fluctuation within each tubes ( traps ) .",
    "the other is the thermally activated jumps between such tubes , which is analogous to the droplet excitations in spin - glasses .",
    "actually these two different processes can be visually monitored rather easily as the following . in fig .",
    "4 we plot the time sequence of the segment @xmath35 on the same system shown in fig .",
    "the data are averaged over every interval of @xmath36 ( mcs ) trying to mask small scale fluctuations .",
    "apart from the remanent small scale fluctuations , which is understood as the fast fluctuations within each traps ( tubes ) , the coarsegrained process is apparently understood as jumps between the four traps which correspond to the four major peaks of @xmath37 ( white tubes in fig .  3 at @xmath38 ) .",
    "the thermal jumps between the traps must go over the free energy barriers which lie between them ( black void in fig .",
    "the scaling property of the relaxation times of the thermal jumps between the tubes has already been studied in the context of the aforementioned transport problem in the vortex glass phase@xcite . for the convenience of the later discussions ,",
    "we summarize it here .",
    "for example , suppose that there is a loop - like structure of tubes as schematically shown in fig .",
    "let its transverse size @xmath39 . then the free energy barrier @xmath40 associated with the thermal excitation over the loop , which we hereafter call _ loop - excitation _",
    "following@xcite , scales as @xmath41 where @xmath42 is some temperature dependent constant .",
    "note that near the free end of the polymer , the tubes does not form complete loop structures but rather _",
    "u_-shaped structures in which one side of the ends of the tubes are left open .",
    "but we expect that such thermal excitations scales in the same way as the _ complete _ loop excitations .",
    "the value of the exponent @xmath43 is expected to be @xmath44 in 1 + 1 dprm@xcite .",
    "then the relaxation time of the loop - excitation scales as @xmath45 the broad distribution of the size of the loops@xcite implies broad distribution of relaxation times .",
    "the numerical experiment is done in the following way ( see also the illustration in fig .  6 ) . at first , a random initial configuration is prepared . then the system is let to evolve for @xmath0 ( mcs ) by the heatbath monte carlo dynamics of a certain temperature @xmath46 .",
    "this means that the polymer is forced to approach the equilibrium state of temperature @xmath46 being attached to a heat bath of temperature @xmath46 . after this @xmath0 ( mcs ) of _ aging _ , the polymer s configuration is stored and copied to a replica system",
    ". then we let the two systems , say replica a and b , continue the relaxational dynamics using the same random numbers ( same thermal noise of the heat bath ) but appling small tilt field @xmath47 to system b.    we measure the following dynamical overlap function as a probe to the relaxational dynamics of the unperturbed system ( replica a ) .",
    "it is defined as @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the kroneker s delta and @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) represents the configurations of the polymer at @xmath52 ( mcs ) . here",
    "the bracket @xmath53 denotes the avarage over different sequences of the random numbers and the over bar @xmath54 the average over different realizations of the random potentials .",
    "it is defined in an analogy with the spin - autocorrelation function of the spin - glass models and conveniently measure the closeness between the configurations at two different times @xmath55 and @xmath0 . in the static limit , it is expected to converge to the expectation value of the overlap @xmath56 between two replica systems which has been introduced by mzard@xcite , @xmath57    we measure the dynamical response to the tilt field at @xmath52 ( mcs ) after @xmath0 ( mcs ) of aging as the distance between the temporal positions of the free end @xmath15 of the two replicas a and b , which we denote as @xmath58 and @xmath59 , @xmath60 note that @xmath53 encloses both @xmath61 and @xmath62 because we use the same random numbers in replica a and b in our procedure .",
    "this definition is slightly different from the conventional one @xmath63 .",
    "however our present choice is more efficient in practice because it provides essentially the same result but with less noise .    in equilibrium ,",
    "the response function ( [ resp ] ) is related with the correlation function @xmath64 as @xmath65,\\ ] ] by the fluctuation disspation theorem ( fdt ) of the 1st kind , @xmath66 provided that @xmath47 is small enough ( linear response regime ) . note that in the static limit @xmath67 and @xmath68 of ( [ balance ] ) , we get the ordinary static fdt , @xmath69 where the susceptibility @xmath70 is given by @xmath71    we performed a series of temperature quench experiments on the system with various sizes @xmath72 , and temperatures at @xmath73 .",
    "the parameter @xmath74 and @xmath75 are fixed at @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the average over @xmath76 samples of random potential were done depending on the system size . in order to ensure that @xmath47 is small enough so that the linear response condition is satisfied , we calculated the disorder averaged static susceptibility @xmath70 ( see ( [ chi ] ) ) and @xmath77 by the transfer matrix method@xcite and checked that ( [ staticresp ] ) is well satisfied .",
    "we first present the results of the dynamical overlap function defined in ( [ q ] ) on the unperturbed system ( replica a ) .",
    "the following analysis is done on the data of @xmath78 at @xmath79 .",
    "the observation was done in the time window ( @xmath80 ( mcs ) ) for @xmath81 ( mcs ) .",
    "the data at @xmath82 and @xmath83 are plotted by double logarithmic plot in fig .",
    "the remarkable feature is that the data curves show strong waiting time @xmath0 dependence and each of them drops off rapidly at around @xmath84 .",
    "it is presumably understood as a manifestation of the crossover from the quasi - equilibrium behavior ( @xmath85 ) to the off - equilibrium behavior ( @xmath86 ) , i.e. aging effect .",
    "actually we see later that it coincides with the fdt breaking which also occurs at around @xmath84 .",
    "the quasi - equilibrium regime ( @xmath1 ) begins with an initial fast decay and crossovers to a much slower decay , which is only visible on the data curves of sufficiently large @xmath0 .",
    "unfortunately we can not determine the asymptotic functional form ( @xmath87 ) of the latter slow decay at this moment .",
    "however the scaling analysis which we discuss later suggests an algebraic law ( see ( [ quasieq ] ) below ) with very small exponent @xmath88 which varies with the temperature as shown in fig .",
    "10 . on the other hand ,",
    "the off - equilibrium part is well fitted by an algebraic law @xmath89 where the exponent @xmath90 also depends on temperature as shown in fig .",
    "it is interesting to note that these characteristics of the crossover behavior are very similar to those originally found by rieger@xcite in the spin - autocorrelation function of the 3 dimensional edwards - anderson spin - glass model in the spin - glass phase .",
    "we now analize the scaling properties of the dynamical overlap function .",
    "we try the scaling form @xmath91 as an example , the scaling plot of the data of @xmath78 , @xmath92 is shown in fig .",
    "the parameter @xmath93 was chosen so as to scale the off - equilibrium part ( @xmath94 ) as good as possible .",
    "it turns out that the initial fast decay part , which we mentioned before , does not fit on the master curve of the @xmath95 scaling . in practice , we could obtain the scaling plot shown in fig .  8 discarding the data of @xmath96 ( mcs ) . at higher temperatures we have to discard more data to obtain good master curves .",
    "as expected , the scaling function behaves as @xmath97 at @xmath98 with @xmath90 which we found in ( [ offeq ] ) . on the other hand",
    "the constant @xmath93 turns out to be well fitted by an algebraic law of @xmath0 , @xmath99 as shown in fig .",
    "the exponent @xmath88 obtained by this fitting varies with temperature as presented in fig .",
    "10 . at @xmath100",
    ", @xmath88 becomes too small to be determined precisely .    using ( [ constc ] ) ,",
    "we can rewrite ( [ scaleq ] ) as @xmath101 where @xmath102 is related with @xmath103 in ( [ scaleq ] ) by @xmath104 .",
    "note that this scaling form is also identical to that originally found in 3 dimensional spin - glass model by rieger@xcite .",
    "the new scaling form ( [ scaleq_r ] ) implies that the quasi - equilibrium part ( @xmath105 ) behaves as @xmath106 however as can be seen in the master curve in fig .  8",
    ", the crossover takes place rather gradually and the left branch of the master curve ( @xmath105 ) seem to decay faster than the expected algebraic law @xmath107 with @xmath88 obtained from ( [ constc ] ) .",
    "this discrepancy implies that we have not yet attained the asymptotic scaling behavior of the @xmath105 part .",
    "unfortunately we could not accomplish it with our available computational power .",
    "lastly we discuss the finite size effects .",
    "as far as the system size @xmath8 is finite , the size of the largest loop - excitation and thus the associated maximum relaxation time @xmath108 available in the system must be finite ( see ( [ looptau ] ) ) .",
    "thus we expect that system is fully equilibrated if we take @xmath0 larger than a certain equilibration time @xmath109 which may be comparable with the @xmath108 .",
    "the finite size effect appears in the dynamical overlap function as the following . in fig .",
    "11 the data on the system of @xmath110 and @xmath111 is shown as a typical example .",
    "it can be seen that the waiting time @xmath0 dependence on the dynamical overlap function saturates at some finite @xmath0 as @xmath0 is increased : the curves do not show any further @xmath0 dependence when @xmath0 exceeds some characteristic time @xmath109 .",
    "in the example shown in fig .  11 , it is larger than @xmath112 but less than @xmath113 ( mcs ) .",
    "we have checked that @xmath109 increases as we increase the system size @xmath8 .",
    "it is also recognized that the dynamical overlap function saturates to the static limit @xmath114 ( see ( [ staticq ] ) ) when @xmath115 .",
    "the value of @xmath114 is nearly equal to @xmath56 obtained by transfer matrix method which uses two replicas@xcite .",
    "though @xmath56 is non - zero in finite systems , further calculations by the transfer matrix method on larger systems show that @xmath56 decrease as the system size @xmath8 increases and it vanish in the thermodynamic limit @xmath116 ( see@xcite ) .",
    "we next present the results of the response to the tilt field defined in ( [ resp ] ) .",
    "the curves in fig .",
    "12 shows the l.h.s and r.h.s . of the fdt relation ( [ balance ] ) at different waiting times @xmath117 , @xmath118 and @xmath119 ( mcs ) on the system of @xmath110 at @xmath120 with the tilt field @xmath121 by semi - logarithmic plot .",
    "the quench experiment was done over @xmath122 different samples of random potential in order to take sufficient average over the disorder .",
    "the curves of the l.h.s . of ( [ balance ] ) ( correlation ) strongly depends on the waiting time @xmath0 .",
    "one the other hand , the curves of the r.h.s of ( [ balance ] ) ( response ) of corresponding @xmath0 do not seem to have significant @xmath0 dependence and almost seem to marge with each other within the numerical accuracy . comparing with the data of larger system sizes",
    ", we checked that the data are not spoiled by finite size effects within this observation time window ( @xmath123 ( mcs ) ) .",
    "however it is difficult to get smooth data on larger systems because they are not self - averaging quantities and sample to sample fluctuations are larger on larger systems .    as is clear from the figure , the fdt relation is satisfied in the regime @xmath1 but broken in the regime @xmath2 .",
    "it is again a clear evidence of the crossover from quasi - equilibrium to off - equilibrium dynamics , i.e. aging effect .",
    "similar fdt breaking was previously found in the spin - glass phase of the 3 dimensional spin - glass models by monte calro simulations@xcite .",
    "however there is an important difference : in the spin - glass models both the response and correlation functions strongly depends on @xmath0 while in the present model the response dose not seem to have @xmath0 dependence .",
    "this is understood as the following . as the tilt field pulls the free end of the polymer , it moves by successive local thermal excitations around it , while the rest of the system is indifferent of the existence of the tilt field .",
    "we expect that the free energy barrier of such thermal excitations scales as ( [ scalefb ] ) .",
    "thus the response will scale the same way as the _ typical _ transverse size of a loop - excitation which becomes active after waiting @xmath52 , @xmath124 in order to clarify this scaling form , we performed longer simulation up to @xmath125 ( mcs ) . in fig .",
    "13 we show the double logarithmic plot of @xmath126 v.s .",
    "@xmath127 on the system of @xmath128 , @xmath129 and @xmath130 at @xmath131 with @xmath132 .",
    "it can be seen that the behavior is consistent with ( [ scaleresp ] ) with @xmath133 and thus supports the above argument .",
    "the data on the system of different system sizes and at different temperatures show similar behavior except that data of smaller systems show saturations within the observation time window .",
    "lastly we consider the extremely high temperature case in finite systems . as we mentioned before the diameter of the tubes grow as the temperature increases@xcite .",
    "then if the system is too small , a single tube swallows up the whole system and the thermal jumps between the tubes disappear . in fig .",
    "14 is shown an example of free energy landscape for such case , the density plot of @xmath24 of a system of @xmath110 at @xmath134 on a certain random potential .",
    "roughly only a single big tube can be recognized .",
    "in such an extreme case , we found no aging effects .",
    "the fdt relation is fulfilled in the whole @xmath52 range up to the static limit as shown in fig .",
    "15 . at around @xmath36 ( mcs )",
    ", they saturate to the static limit , @xmath77 or @xmath135 ( see ( [ staticresp ] ) ) calculated by the transfer matrix method . in addition , the dynamical overlap function does not show any @xmath0 dependence .",
    "these facts suggest that the thermal jumps between the tubes , i.e. loop - excitations are the essential processes to bring about the observed aging effects .",
    "the relaxational dynamics of 1 + 1 dimensional dprm was investigated by the monte carlo simulations which mimiced the irm experiment in spin - glasses .",
    "the aging effect appears as the systematic waiting time dependence on both the dynamical overlap function and the fdt breaking .",
    "the dynamical overlap function shows clear crossover from slow quasi - equilibrium decay ( @xmath1 ) to fast off - equilibrium decay ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the latter is well fitted by ab algebraic law whose exponent depends on temperature .",
    "the @xmath95 scaling scheme works well and it suggests algebraic decay also in the quasi - equilibrium part .",
    "however we could not confirm the latter directly with our computational power . on the other hand ,",
    "the response to the tilt field grows as @xmath136 ( [ scaleresp ] ) independently of the waiting time , which supports the assumed scaling properties of loop - excitations ( see ( [ scalefb ] ) and ( [ looptau ] ) ) .",
    "concerning the fact that it does not show @xmath0 dependence , this model appears rather trivial compared with , for example , spin - glasses in which there are dramatic effects also in the response function so that one can actually observe the aging effects in experiments by measuring the magnetization @xcite .",
    "none the less , other aspects of the aging effect are very similar to that found in the spin - glass phase of 3 dimensional spin - glass models@xcite .",
    "hence we believe that this model provides a good testing ground for various theoretical ideas of the slow dynamics of quenched random systems .    the important elementary processes to bring about the observed aging effect are the loop - excitations , i.e. thermal hoppings between the traps ( tubes ) in the free energy landscape .",
    "they were actually demonstrated by direct monitoring of the time sequences .",
    "thus equilibration process is understood as the slow growth of quasi - equilibrium domain driven by successive loop - excitations .",
    "note that this growth mechanism of the quasi - equilibrium domain is essentially the same as proposed in the spin - glass models in which droplet excitations drive the growth of the domain@xcite . from ( [ looptau ] ) , we expect that its transverse size @xmath137 grows as @xmath138 however the scaling properties of the dynamical overlap function are not trivial . though they turned out to be quite similar to those found in the spin - glass model@xcite , they can not be explained by simply borrowing the assumptions of the above mentioned droplet theory@xcite . in the droplet theory , it is assumed that @xmath139 where @xmath140 is now the spin - autocorrelation function and @xmath141 is some unknown exponent@xcite .",
    "( here @xmath141 is the notation of @xcite and different from @xmath90 defined in ( [ offeq ] ) . )",
    "but we do nt have any reason to believe that such a relation exists in the present model , and actually our result ( [ offeq ] ) can not be consistent with ( [ domain ] ) if we assume ( [ qr ] ) . in the study of spin - glass model@xcite , it is argued that ( [ offeq ] ) can be consistent with ( [ qr ] ) if one assumes that the free energy barrier grows logarithmically with its transverse size @xmath39 rather than algebraically so that @xmath137 grows algebraically with a certain temperature dependent exponent .",
    "if it is the also case in the present model , the response function ( [ resp ] ) should be fitted by such algebraic law .",
    "however our data of the response function show systematic curvature in double logarithmic plots and do not prefer such algebraic law but the logarithmic law ( [ scaleresp ] ) .",
    "thus we conclude that the simple relation ( [ qr ] ) does not exist in the present model .",
    "the scaling properties of the dynamical overlap function require other ways to explain them .    the important feature we recognize in fig .",
    "3 is that the tubes are grouped together to form some very complicated network .",
    "we already know how the relaxation time associated with each single loop - excitation scales with its transverse size ( see ( [ looptau ] ) ) .",
    "however there is an obvious but important rule : a loop - excitation can _ flip _ only when some part of the temporal configuration of the polymer actually stay in either side of the loop , in other words the _ empty _ loops can not _",
    "flip_. it should also be noted that the polymer is _ not _ allowed to be broken into pieces during the dynamical process .",
    "thus not the entire loop - excitations built in the system can become _ active _ simultaneously but only those which are associated with the sequence of the loops which contain the actual temporal configuration of the polymer . from the above considerations ,",
    "it is clear that the information of the connectivity of the loops is an important ingredient to describe the dynamics of the polymer .",
    "let us now consider the dynamical overlap function ( [ q ] ) .",
    "it can be roughly interpreted as the _ probability _ that the segments of the polymer return to the original traps in which they initially stay after jumping around other traps in the network . here",
    "we need the detailed description of the dynamics mentioned above since the probability is the sum of the probabilities associated with all of the possible paths which make such return trips .",
    "each of these paths consist of different sequences of loop - excitations which vary in sizes and thus have different relaxation times .",
    "it is unlikely that there is a single _ typical _ mode whose probability dominate the total probability .",
    "on the other hand , the response to the tilt field does not depend directly on such details .",
    "the response function scales just as the _ expectation value _ of the transverse size of the local loop - excitation around the free end which can become active after waiting @xmath52 .",
    "it is possible that such expectation value is dominated by the contribution from the _ typical _ mode whose relaxation time is comparable with @xmath52 .",
    "we think this is the reason why we could obtain ( [ scaleresp ] ) using only the scaling property of single loop - excitation .",
    "although the network looks apparently quite complicated , a most simple characterization of it will be the following .",
    "the network structure consists of loops of various sizes which are hierarchically nested so that larger ones enclose smaller ones inside .",
    "( a similar picture was proposed before by villain concerning the organization of _ droplets _ in spin - glass phase , see@xcite ) . from this simple picture ,",
    "the dynamics can be regarded as one of the hierarchical diffusion processes which have been intensively studied in rather abstract contexts , for example the _ ultradiffusion _ models@xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that in the latter models the autocorrelation function ( return probability ) shows asymptotically algebraic decay with some temperature dependent exponent , which is also the case in the dynamical overlap function in the present model .",
    "furthermore , it has already been shown by sibani and hoffman that hierarchical diffusion processes can show aging effects@xcite .",
    "thus it will be fruitful to construct a phenomenological theory of the aging effect of the present model from this point of view .",
    "a study in this direction will be reported elsewhere@xcite .",
