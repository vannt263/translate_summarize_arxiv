    "this paper descibes the motivations and requirements which led to the development of the world s largest - format ccd detector .",
    "the history and realization of the entire camera around this device for the u.s .",
    "naval observatory ( usno ) is presented .",
    "some performance results obtained from a thinned , backside - illuminated detector of this kind are given .",
    "the paper concludes with plans for the future and explains applications in ground - based and space - based programs .",
    "in recent years the requirements for ever larger focal plane assemblies at astronomical telescopes have mostly been satisfied by assembling numerous smaller devices into large focal plane mosaics .",
    "the advantage of this mosaic approach is a larger yield in producing high quality detectors , which results in cost savings for the instrument development .",
    "although larger , monolithic detectors are desirable , there has not been a real driver requiring the bold step to go beyond the current typical 2k @xmath0 4k scale devices .      in planning projects beyond the successful usno ccd astrograph catalog ( ucac ) program@xcite it was realized that a large - format detector is needed .",
    "using the technique of photographic astrometry the positions of stars are determined with respect to several reference stars with known positions by direct imaging of the sky using dedicated telescopes .",
    "the large - format photographic plates ( up to about 17 inches on a side ) traditionally used were later replaced by ccd detectors , providing higher quantum efficiency and more accurate centroiding results as compared to the photographic process .",
    "unfortunately , ccd detectors are very small compared to photographic plates . for high accuracy astrometric measurements many reference stars need to be on the same detector or at least many well exposed anonymous stars are required to tile together overlapping fields with as few mapping parameters as possible .",
    "we needed to advance beyond the existing ccd formats in order to make significant progress@xcite in this area and to fully utilize the existing large focal plane of our astrograph as well as those of future dedicated astrometric telescopes .    at that same meeting@xcite where the need for larger - format ccd detectors for astrometric mapping was presented",
    ", we learned that designers of a large binocular telescope spectroscopic instrument were also looking at similar types of ccd detectors to improve calibrations and lower systematic errors .",
    "following discussions , both groups agreed to share risks in development of a large - format detector which could be used for both projects .",
    "a pixel size of 9 @xmath2 was agreed upon , but independent funding avenues had to be pursued .",
    "of particular importance for astrometric applications are a high charge transfer efficiency and relatively fast readout , with a goal of about 10 sec for the full frame .",
    "this required the use of a large number of parallel outputs .",
    "standard high - quality materials and designs used for science grade ccd detectors were sufficient to satisfy all other requirements , providing the yield issue could be addressed successfully .",
    "figure 1 shows the usno twin astrograph , which was used for the ucac program ( 1997 to 2004 ) and before that for astrometry using photographic plates ( 24 cm square and 8 @xmath0 10 inch ) .",
    "the original  blue \" lens was replaced by a 5-lens  red lens \" objective@xcite of extremely high astrometric performance , which has been in operation since 1990 .",
    "the new 10k camera dewar is attached to the red lens now , while the second telescope tube features a visual bandpass corrected lens which is used for guiding .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]",
    "the main application for this detector and camera is to support dod needs and requirements for star positions .",
    "this will also serve the general astronomical community by providing highly accurate positions and proper motions of millions of stars .    for star tracker applications ( bright stars ) the goal is to improve upon the hipparcos catalog@xcite positions , which have steadily degraded due to accumulation of proper motion errors since their mean observing epoch in 1991 .",
    "this improvement can be accomplished by observing bright targets with the usno astrograph and the new 10k camera through the neutral density spot on its filter .",
    "tycho-2 stars in the same 2.5 by 2.5 degree field of view will serve as reference frame .    for space",
    "situational awareness research the 10k camera can be used at either the astrograph or the urat to determine accurate positions of faint stars ( down to r magnitude 18 and 21 , respectively ) . for this application maximal sky coverage per exposure",
    "is needed .",
    "figure 5 shows a focal plane layout with 4 of the 10k ccd detectors in their current packaging .",
    "the circle is 333 mm in diameter , close to the limit of the astrograph focal plane area .",
    "attached to the astrograph this would provide 27 square degrees sky coverage in a single exposure .",
    "this layout would need to be modified to be able to mount the 10k chips closer together for the slightly smaller urat focal plane .",
    "c    we plan to purchase such a ",
    "4-shooter \" camera in 2008 .",
    "this would allow us to construct a urat focal plane and use it at the astrograph .",
    "after only 2 years of observing time from the cerro tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio ) , positions and parallaxes of stars in the 11 to 16 mag range on the 5 to 10 mas level could be produced , significantly improving current star catalog data .",
    "if the usno - lead milli - arcsecond pathfinder survey ( maps ) mission@xcite is approved , the tie of the resulting new celestial reference frame to fixed , extragalactic sources would be performed by urat , and funding is expected for the new , dedicated , ground - based telescope utilizing the 4-shooter camera based on an anti - blooming modified version of the sta1600 chip .",
    "the initial design for the sta1600 called for 16 2-stage outputs that could run at up to 15 mhz , resulting in a maximum frame rate of approximately 2 frames per second ( fps ) with a resultant post - cds read noise of 40 to 50 e@xmath3 rms . because it was designed to be operated at ground - based observatories , the current design has no built - in radiation mitigation capabilities .",
    "a space - based implementation of this ccd could include an increase in the frame rate and improved radiation hardening . in order to increase frame rate , the number of readout amplifiers",
    "would be increased to 32 and 3-stage amps would be used rather than 2 , increasing the speed to 40 mhz per channel .",
    "this approach would allow the frame rate to be increased from 2 to 10 fps , with an increase in read noise to around 60 e@xmath3 rms . in order to improve radiation hardness ,",
    "perhaps the most straightforward approach would be to use p - channel rather than n - channel material .",
    "numerous results@xcite have shown an increase of approximately an order of magnitude in hardness vs.  displacement damage is achieved when using p - channel material .",
    "other solutions , such as active circuitry , could also be considered , although these methods are less attractive due to their added complexity and potential negative impact on yield .",
    "although some manufacturers are identified for the purpose of scientific clarity , the usno does not endorse any commercial product nor does the usno permit any use of this document for marketing or advertising .",
    "we further caution the reader that the equipment quality described here may not be characteristic of similar equipment maintained at other laboratories , nor of equipment currently marketed by any commercial vendor .",
    "we wish to thank the office of naval research ( onr ) for funding this large , monolithic detector research program through a navy sbir program and sean urban , head of the nautical almanac office , for finding that sponsor .",
