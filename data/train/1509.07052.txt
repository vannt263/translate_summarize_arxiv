    "narrow gap semiconductors have been for many years subject of intense experimental and theoretical studies in view of their interesting properties and important applications @xcite . in recent years",
    "they have become once again a source of excitement due to the discovery of topological insulators @xcite .",
    "the topological boundary states have been observed in bulk compounds bi@xmath5se@xmath6 , bi@xmath5te@xmath6 , bulk alloys bi@xmath1sb@xmath2@xcite , two - dimensional quantum wells of hgte / hg@xmath1cd@xmath2te @xcite and , most recently , in bulk pb@xmath1sn@xmath2se alloys @xcite , bulk snte @xcite and bulk pb@xmath1sn@xmath2te alloys @xcite .",
    "the latter were called topological crystalline insulators ( tci ) , because , in contrast to canonical topological insulators , specific crystalline symmetries warrant the topological protection of their metallic surface states @xcite .",
    "since the iv - vi lead chalcogenides are characterized by strong temperature dependence of their band structures , it is possible to reach proper band ordering for a suitably chosen chemical composition @xmath7 by varying the temperature . for the pb@xmath1sn@xmath2se system at high temperatures",
    "the band ordering is called trivial ( @xmath8 band above @xmath9 band ) and no tci state occurs . as the temperature is lowered for the properly chosen @xmath7 , one can reach the vanishing band gap and then arrive at the inverted nontrivial ordering ( @xmath9 band above @xmath8 band ) in which tci state can occur .",
    "such transition was demonstrated with the use of angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy in ref .",
    "generally speaking , the character of topological insulators is manifested in both their surface and bulk properties .    it has been recognized from the sixties that in the alloys pb@xmath1sn@xmath2se one can reach vanishing energy gap by changing the temperature",
    ". an early demonstration of this possibility was provided by strauss @xcite who used for this purpose the optical transmission measuring the gap on both sides of the band ordering .",
    "also laser emission proved useful in this respect @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the electric resistivity and the hall coefficient depend on the band ordering and can be used to obtain information on the transition temperature even if the fermi energy is quite high in either the valence or conduction band @xcite . quite recently ,",

    "we investigate experimentally and theoretically the conduction electron density , mobility and the @xmath0 effect .",
    "since our study concentrates on small gap values , particular features of the band structure are crucial and it turns out that the description of transport effects for the vanishing gap poses nontrivial theoretical problems .",
    "in fact , although we describe bulk properties , as the gap goes to zero we deal with linear energy bands which is a completely new situation for the transport theory .",
    "we demonstrate for four pb@xmath1sn@xmath2se samples that , as the gap goes to zero , the @xmath0 effect reaches a maximum .",

    "we terminate the iteration when the ( n+1)th value of @xmath119 is practically the same as the nth .",
    "this procedure determines the final values of @xmath119 , @xmath42 , @xmath116 and @xmath118 for the given temperature .",
    "these values can then be used to calculate the @xmath0 coefficient given by eq .",
    "the adjustable parameters mentioned above are chosen to obtain an overall best agreement between the experiment and theory for @xmath118 and @xmath120 for our four samples at all available temperatures .    when employing the above scheme we have found that the computed quantity containing the integral @xmath121 , that is @xmath116 and @xmath120 , ( see eqs .",
    "( 9 ) and ( 10 ) ) , have a strong and narrow peak at the temperature @xmath122 for which @xmath123 .",
    "such peak has no physical meaning and , as it can be seen in fig . 1 for @xmath120 ,",
    "it is not observed experimentally .",
    "also , there is no reason to expect a sharp peak of the scattering factor @xmath116 because it would lead to a sharp peak of the free electron density @xmath119 without a physical reason .",
    "however , since our pb@xmath1sn@xmath2se samples are certainly not homogeneous , i.e. they have somewhat different chemical compositions @xmath7 at various parts , one can not expect to have @xmath123 in the whole sample at one temperature @xmath24 .",
    "we simulate this nonhomogeneity by using the well known mathematical measure to avoid singularities in resonances .",
    "thus , we introduce damping by replacing in all formulas the value of @xmath3 by @xmath124 and take real values of the resulting expressions . by adjusting the damping constant @xmath112 we can bring both the scattering factor @xmath116 and the @xmath0 coefficient into a reasonable and experimentally observed behaviour , see below .",
    "figure 1 shows our main experimental results on the @xmath0 effect in pbse and four pb@xmath1sn@xmath2se samples in which the gaps @xmath3 in pb@xmath1sn@xmath2se alloys can go through zero as functions of temperature .",
    "our absolute experimental values of @xmath120 are in general agreement with those measured on other narrow - gap semiconducting materials @xcite .",
    "the vertical thin arrows indicate critical temperatures @xmath122 which , according to the dependence ( 4 ) , correspond to @xmath3 = 0 for the indicated chemical compositions .",
    "it can be seen that the maximum of @xmath120 for each sample corresponds to the critical temperature @xmath122 . in other words",
    ", a maximum of @xmath120 indicates that the gap goes through zero value . on the other hand , in pbse",
    "there is no possibility of reaching vanishing gap and one observes no maximum .",

    "the values of adjusted material parameters are given in table 1 .",
    "as indicated above , there is @xmath128 , so that we have to go here through the calculation of @xmath116 as well .",
    "as the temperature goes from 0 to 300 k the calculated value of @xmath116 goes smoothly from 0.85 to 1.55 .",
    "it can be seen that , with the indicated values of material parameters for various scattering modes , the overall description of mobility is quite satisfactory .",
    "it follows from the figure that the dominant scattering mechanism is due to alloy disorder . at higher temperatures the polar and nonpolar optical , as well as acoustical phonon modes become important . for the assumed low density of linear dislocations",
    "@xmath111 = 10@xmath129 the corresponding partial mobility is too high to be seen in the figure .    in fig .",
    "4 we plot theoretical behaviour of @xmath120 for pb@xmath1sn@xmath2se having four different chemical compositions @xmath7 .",
    "all calculations are carried for small density of dislocations @xmath130 @xmath131 , no damping ( @xmath112 = 0 ) and fixed values of other material parameters .",
    "in addition , the electron density @xmath132 @xmath20 is kept the same for all samples .",
    "this somewhat hypothetical calculation is instructive for several reasons .",
    "it shows that for @xmath7 = 0 and @xmath7 = 0.15 , when no @xmath123 occurs , the behaviour of @xmath120 is very flat . on the other hand , for higher values of @xmath7 , where the gap vanishes as a function of @xmath24 ,",
    "the @xmath0 effect has a maximum at the critical temperature @xmath122 .",
    "it is seen that , when no damping is introduced , theoretical @xmath120 coefficients have high and very sharp peaks not observed experimentally .",
    "this , as we explained previously , is a result of the `` explosive '' behaviour of the @xmath121 integral at e@xmath133 = 0 , which appears in formula ( 10 ) for @xmath120 .",
    "figure 5 shows two calculations of the @xmath0 coefficient for the pb@xmath126sn@xmath127se sample , carried out with the same values of adjustable material parameters .",
    "the dashed line indicates a calculation without damping , i.e. with @xmath112 = 0 .",
    "it gives a sharp peak at the temperature @xmath122 = 141 k at which @xmath3 = 0 .",
    "this peak is related to the integral @xmath134 discussed above and it is not observed experimentally . for this reason we use the damping procedure mentioned in the preceding section with the adjusted value of @xmath112 = 20 mev .",
    "this gives the result indicated by the solid line .",
    "it is seen that now there is no sharp peak and the theory describes quite well the experiment shown in fig .",
    "1 with the exception of low temperatures . finally , we indicate a marked difference of theoretical results for @xmath120 calculated for the sample @xmath7 = 0.25 with the use of @xmath112 = 0 , as seen in figs 4 and 5 .",
    "this difference is due to largely different dislocation densities assumed for both calculations : @xmath135 in fig . 4 and @xmath136 in fig . 5",
    "finally , fig .",
    "6 shows theoretical dependence of @xmath120 versus temperature , calculated for all four pb@xmath1sn@xmath2se samples of our interest . in the description we use for all samples",
    "the same values of material parameters , excepting the density of defects , the density of dislocations , and the damping constant @xmath112 .",
    "the latter are adjusted for each sample and their values are used also in the description of average mobilities , as illustrated for the sample with @xmath7 = 0.25 in fig .",
    "3 . in the same figure",
    "we reproduce for comparison the experimental data shown in fig .",
    "1 with the same vertical arrows indicating the critical temperatures @xmath122 at which @xmath3 = 0 . the vertical arrows drawn at maxima of p@xmath23 denote the critical temperature @xmath122 at which e@xmath133=0 .",
    "the same arrows are transferred to fig.1 for comparison with experimental data .",
    "it is seen that the calculated and experimental maxima occur at the same temperatures within several percent accuracy .",
    "the general experimental and theoretical temperature behaviour near the maxima as well as the absolute values of p@xmath23 agree quite with each other . by comparing figs . 4 and 5",
    "it becomes clear that the maximum of @xmath0 effect is directly related to the gap going through zero .",
    "this is a general feature of the theory which should find applications for other zero - gap semiconductor and semimetal systems . on the other hand ,",
    "the low temperature behaviour of the samples with x=0.325 and x=0.39 remains unexplained according to the presented theory .",
    "it should be observed that the unexplained region corresponds to the nontrivial band ordering in which the topologically protected surface states appear , so we deal with a two - channel transport . according to the formulas for two - channel mixed conductivity , the @xmath0 coefficient depends on weighted contributions of both conducting channels and difference of their thermoelectric powers @xcite .",
    "consequently , it is possible that the low temperature behaviour is modified by the topological surface states which are not accounted for in our theory .",
    "it should be mentioned that higher values of the damping constant @xmath112 result in wider and lower theoretical maxima of @xmath120 .",
    "all in all , we achieve a good description of the @xmath0 effect and electron mobility for four investigated samples in the critical range of small forbidden gaps in which the transition between trivial - nontrivial band ordering takes place .",
    "our analysis has general significance for zero - gap systems and , in particular , it should be useful for a description of electron transport in topological crystalline insulators and in recently discovered three - dimensional topological dirac semimetals - bulk analogues of graphene @xcite .",
    "the main conclusion of our work is that a maximum of the electron nernst - ettingshausen effect , measured as a function of decreasing temperature in pb@xmath1sn@xmath2se alloys , indicates a critical temperature @xmath122 corresponding to the zero energy gap and transition from trivial to nontrivial band ordering in terms of the topological crystalline insulators .",
    "the above property allows one to determine experimentally critical temperatures @xmath122 by means of transport data .",
    "in particular , we checked theoretically that the maximum of @xmath0 effect does not depend on the carrier density in the sample . electron mobility and @xmath0 effect are measured and successfully described for four pb@xmath1sn@xmath2se samples with 0.25@xmath140.39 in the vicinity of @xmath137 , establishing the dominant scattering modes .",
    "it is demonstrated that the description of hall scattering factor and @xmath0 effect presents theoretical problems as the gap goes to zero and the bands become linear in the wave vector . the latter",

    "<S> the transverse nernst ettingshausen ( @xmath0 ) effect and electron mobility in pb@xmath1sn@xmath2se alloys are studied experimentally and theoretically as functions of temperature and chemical composition in the vicinity of vanishing energy gap @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the study is motivated by the recent discovery that , by lowering the temperature , one can change the band ordering from trivial to nontrivial one in which the topological crystalline insulator states appear at the surface . </S>",

    "<S> it is shown experimentally and theoretically that the bulk @xmath0 effect has a maximum when the energy gap @xmath3 of the mixed crystal goes through zero value . </S>",
    "<S> this result contradicts the claim made in the literature that the @xmath0 effect changes sign when the gap vanishes . </S>",
    "<S> we successfully describe @xmath4 transport effects in the situation of extreme band s nonparabolicity which , to the best of our knowledge , has never been tried before . </S>",

    "<S> various scattering modes and their contribution to transport phenomena in pb@xmath1sn@xmath2se are analyzed . </S>",
    "<S> as the energy gap goes through zero , some transport integrals have a singular ( nonphysical ) behaviour and we demonstrate how to deal with this problem by introducing damping . </S>"
