    "<S> we report a systematic study of the transport properties in the series of eu(fe@xmath0co@xmath1)@xmath2as@xmath2 single crystals with @xmath3 = 0 , 0.15 , 0.20 and 0.30 . </S>",
    "<S> spin - density - wave order is observed in the undoped and the least doped samples ( @xmath3 = 0 , 0.15 ) , while for @xmath3 = 0.15 and 0.20 eu(fe@xmath0co@xmath1)@xmath2as@xmath2 becomes a superconductor . </S>",
    "<S> we found the properties of the parent eufe@xmath2as@xmath2 compound well described by the dirac fermions model , whereas cobalt doping caused an evolution of the system toward a regular metallic state . </S>",
    "<S> the antiferromagnetic ordering of the eu@xmath4 ions at @xmath5 20 k has only minor influence on the measured quantities .    </S>",
    "<S> there is a substantial difference between the antiferromagnetic ground states of the parent compounds of copper- and iron - based superconductors . </S>",
    "<S> while the first is the mott insulator @xcite , the spin - density - wave ( sdw ) state in the second is always metallic @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since the cooper pairing interaction is probably magnetic in both families , understanding of the evolution of the system from magnetism to superconductivity ( sc ) can be a crucial step towards revealing the mechanism responsible for superconductivity . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the eu(fe@xmath0co@xmath1)@xmath2as@xmath2 series of iron - pnictide single crystals and report nernst coefficient ( @xmath6 ) data together with complementary studies of the thermoelectric power ( @xmath7 ) , hall coefficient ( @xmath8 ) and resistivity ( @xmath9 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the dominating influence of dirac fermions on the transport properties seen in the parent eufe@xmath2as@xmath2 compound vanishes with cobalt doping and our most highly doped eu(fe@xmath10co@xmath11)@xmath2as@xmath2 shows regular metallic behavior . in the least doped eu(fe@xmath12co@xmath13)@xmath2as@xmath2 we observe both superconductivity and spin - density - wave order . </S>",
    "<S> however , the influence of sdw on @xmath6 changes radically in comparison with the undoped eufe@xmath2as@xmath2 . this may indicate that dirac fermions can not survive in the sample that shows both sdw and sc .    </S>",
    "<S> single crystals of eu(fe@xmath0co@xmath1)@xmath2as@xmath2 were grown out of sn flux . </S>",
    "<S> the constituent elements were loaded into alumina crucibles and placed in quartz ampoules sealed under pressure of 0.3 bar of ar . </S>",
    "<S> the ampoules were heated to 1050@xmath14c and kept at that temperature for 10 h to ensure complete dissolving of all components in molten sn . </S>",
    "<S> next , the ampoules were slowly ( 2 - 3@xmath14c / h ) cooled down to 600@xmath14c , then liquid sn - flux was decanted and remaining sn was etched away from crystals with hydrochloric acid . to cover all possible sdw / sc configurations shown in table 1 </S>",
    "<S> , we selected four compositions for further studies : @xmath3=0 ( denoted as co-0 ) , @xmath3=0.15 ( co-15 ) , @xmath3=0.20 ( co-20 ) , and @xmath3=0.30 ( co-30 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the cobalt content was determined by the energy dispersive x - ray ( edx ) analysis , which gave us values that were larger than the nominal and typical values from other studies @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we ascribe this to uncertainties arising from partial overlap of the main eu , fe and co peaks in energy dispersive x - ray spectra . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the presented here absolute values of @xmath3 should be treated only as estimates . </S>",
    "<S> the phase purity was checked by powder x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) . </S>",
    "<S> all the observed diffraction lines on the xrd pattern could be indexed on the basis of the tetragonal thcr@xmath2si@xmath2-type structure ( space group i4/mmm ) . </S>",
    "<S> both @xmath15 and @xmath16 lattice parameters show the systematic , but weak evolution with @xmath3 ( see table 1 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> [ tab1 ]    .the lattice parameters and the influence of cobalt content on the presence / absence of the sdw and sc order in eu(fe@xmath0co@xmath1)@xmath2as@xmath2 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     intriguingly , the crystal with the lowest fermi energy ( @xmath17 7 mev ) has at low temperatures clearly the highest @xmath18 , and such a significantly enhanced mobility can be a manifestation of limited scattering of the dirac fermions . </S>",
    "<S> their presence in the sdw phase of the iron - pnictides was theoretically predicted @xcite , and suggested to play an important role in transport properties @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , a dirac cone was observed in the electronic structure of bafe@xmath2as@xmath2 by angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) @xcite and was shown to be consistent with the angle dependence of the magnetic quantum oscillations in bafe@xmath2as@xmath2 and srfe@xmath2as@xmath2 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recent theoretical investigations of dirac fermions in the parent antiferromagnetic state by morinari et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite have provided @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , whose overall trends agree well with the experimental data presented here ( the authors of ref </S>",
    "<S> . @xcite used the same `` old '' sign convention as in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the authors considered a phenomenological two - band model consisting of a hole band ( denoted below with index @xmath22 ) with a conventional energy spectrum , and an electron band ( index @xmath23 ) with the dirac fermion energy spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth emphasizing that even if the dirac fermions are the minority carriers some transport coefficients exhibit noticeable contributions from dirac fermions and the nernst coefficient is expected to be significantly affected @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath6 was calculated as : @xmath24 $ ] , the hall coefficient as : @xmath25 and the thermopower as : @xmath26 , where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are elements of the peltier and electrical conductivity tensors , respectively , and @xmath29 is the relaxation time . </S>",
    "<S> results are the sum of contributions from the two bands . </S>",
    "<S> the inset to fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 shows the comparison between the theoretical and the experimental data ( co-1 ) , where the latter were multiplied by a constant to match the heights of maxima or minima . </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical curves are an exact copy of the results presented by morinari et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3(@xmath16 ) ) @xcite obtained for relaxation times ratio @xmath30 , concentrations ratio @xmath31 , and the value of @xmath32= @xmath33 was taken from table 2 above . </S>",
    "<S> what we would like to stress here is that the response of the electronic system to the onset of sdw is different in co-0 and co-15 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , for the nernst coefficient this difference is substantial . </S>",
    "<S> namely , in co-0 there is a sudden rise of @xmath6 below @xmath34 that is very similar to one reported in cafe@xmath2as@xmath2 @xcite , while in co-15 @xmath6 for @xmath35 decreases slightly below the high temperature @xmath21 trend . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 shows an attempt to separate this anomalous and normal contributions to the nernst signal .    </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] = 8.5 cm    to this end we utilized the purely metallic @xmath36 dependence of co-30 , which was fitted to the high temperature part of @xmath21 of co-15 and also co-20 . </S>",
    "<S> fittings were made with two free parameters : @xmath37 , where @xmath15 and @xmath38 were supposed to provide for variation of the of the nernst coefficients due to modification of scattering and concentration of the charge carriers by co - doping . </S>",
    "<S> the total nernst coefficient is assumed to simply be a sum of the normal @xmath39 and anomalous @xmath40 parts : @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath42 obtained in this way for co-15 and co-20 are presented in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 ( @xmath38 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the onset of the anomaly in co-15 correlates with @xmath34 , and is likely associated with the fermi surface reconstruction caused by spin modulations . a description of the normal - state nernst signal in the presence of spin - only </S>",
    "<S> , charge - only , and combined spin and charge stripe order was recently proposed by hackl et al . @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the authors employed a phenomenological quasiparticle model combined with a boltzmann equation approach and showed that fermi pockets caused by translational symmetry breaking can lead to an enhancement of @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the sign of the anomaly depends on the strength as well as the period of the modulation . </S>",
    "<S> since stripe fluctuations were suggested to be sufficient to cause the nernst coefficient to increase @xcite , a small anomaly in @xmath21 that is present in the co-20 crystal below @xmath43 = 50 k might be attributed to sdw fluctuations . however , a very limited size of this maximum does not allow us to draw definitive conclusions .    </S>",
    "<S> while the onset of the sdw order has undoubtedly a significant impact on the electronic transport properties , the local magnetic order in the eu sublattice seems to have no effect on the nernst signal . </S>",
    "<S> figure 5 shows the @xmath21 dependences for co-15 measured at various @xmath44 .    </S>",
    "<S> [ fig5 ] = 8.5 cm    a positive contribution to @xmath6 visible at @xmath44 = 1 t and 5 k @xmath45 13 k correlates with the superconducting transition and most probably is a trace of vortex movement . </S>",
    "<S> there is no other anomaly at low fields ( @xmath46 and 2 t ) , where the influence of the antiferromagnetic eu@xmath47 ordering on the resistivity is still noticeable . </S>",
    "<S> a field dependent @xmath6 seems to be related to the presence of the sdw order and it is also observed in the non - superconducting co-0 crystal . </S>",
    "<S> we were unable to detect the nonlinearity of @xmath48 in co-20 and there is no detectable nernst signal from the sc fluctuations / vortices as in the previously reported case of ca(fe@xmath49co@xmath50)@xmath2as@xmath2 @xcite . in co-30 the nonlinearities in @xmath48 are absent as well . </S>",
    "<S> these results confirm the weak electronic coupling between the eu and feas sublattices @xcite .    in summary , we have presented data indicating that the low temperature transport properties of the eufe@xmath2as@xmath2 parent compound are dominated by dirac fermions thus this compound can be considered as a nodal sdw material . </S>",
    "<S> co doping causes the sudden change of characteristic in the sdw state and the influence of the dirac fermion vanishes in the superconducting eu(fe@xmath12co@xmath13)@xmath2as@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> an open question is whether this is a consequence of changes of tiny electron pockets induced by a shift of the fermi level , or rather increased scattering dirac fermions , or perhaps an interaction between the nodeless s@xmath51 type superconductivity and gapless dirac fermions @xcite . </S>"
