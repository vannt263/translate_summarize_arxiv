    "for example , by @xcite there exist entire functions of order less than @xmath64 ( so holds ) for which @xmath65 is not a spider s web .",
    "thus , by the discussion after theorem  [ erembak ] , we have @xmath66 and yet it can be shown using ( * ? ? ? * theorems  1.1 and 2.3 ) that properties  ( 1 ) and  ( 2 ) hold",
