    "in this paper an alternative approach to the staff selection competition in the case of two departments considered by baston and garnaev @xcite is proposed .",
    "the formulation of the problem in baston and garnaev @xcite is as follows .",
    "two departments in an organisation are each seeking to make an appointment within the same area of expertise . the heads of the two departments together interview the applicants in turn and make their decisions on one applicant before interviewing any others . if a candidate is rejected by both departmental heads , the candidate can not be considered for either post at a later date .",
    "when both heads decide to make an offer , they consider the following possibilities .    1",
    ".   [ casea ] the departments are equally attractive , so that an applicant has no preference between them ; 2 .",
    "[ caseb ] one department can offer better prospects to applicants , who will always choose that department .",
    "the departmental heads know that there are precisely @xmath0 applicants and that each applicant has a level of expertise which is random .",
    "it is assumed that the interview process enables the directors to observe these levels of expertise , which form a sequence of _",
    "i.i.d _ random variables from a continuous distribution .",
    "if no appointment is made to a department from these @xmath0 applicants , then the department will suffer from a shortfall of expertise .",
    "game [ caseb ] has one nash equilibrium , which can be used as the solution to the problem .",
    "game [ casea ] has many nash equilibria .",
    "this raises the question of equilibrium selection .",
    "baston and garnaev @xcite interpreted such a variety of nash equilibria solutions as a way of modelling different dynamics within the organisation , which can result in various outcomes during the conscription process .",
    "if one departmental head is aggressive and one passive , we might expect a different outcome to the one in which both are of a similar temperament . when both have a similar temperament one",
    "expects a symmetric strategy and value , but when they have different temperaments one should expect an asymmetric equilibrium and value .",
    "the different character of heads is modelled by the notion of a stackleberg leader .",
    "also , the difference in the level of complication of equilibria might also be an argument justifying this approach to equilibrium selection .",
    "it is shown that these non - symmetric equilibria have the advantage that the players use pure strategies , whereas at the symmetric equilibrium , the players are called upon to employ specific actions with complicated probabilities .    the staff selection problem presented above",
    "is closely related to the best choice problem ( bcp ) .",
    "there are some potential real applications of decision theory which strengthen the motivation of the bcp ( the one decision maker problem ) .",
    "one group of such problems are models of many important business decisions , such as choosing a venture partner , adopting technological innovation , or hiring an employee using a sequential decision framework ( see stein , seale and rapoport  @xcite , chun  @xcite ) .",
    "others are an experimental investigations of the , , secretary problem  , which compare the optimal policy from the mathematical model with behaviour of human beings ( see seal and rapoport  @xcite ) .",
    "we have not found any such investigation for bcp games .",
    "it could be that the theoretical results are not complete enough to start applied and experimental research .    in spite of the long history of bcp and its generalisations presented in review papers by freeman @xcite , ferguson @xcite , rose @xcite , samuels @xcite , there are also competitive versions , on which researchers attention has been focused ( see sakaguchi @xcite for review papers ) .",
    "let us briefly recall the main game theoretic models of bcp .",
    "enns and ferenstein @xcite , enns , ferenstein and sheahan @xcite solved a non - zero sum game related to bcp .",
    "some important mathematical results related to the problem , posed in this paper , were proven many years later by bruss and louchard @xcite .",
    "the full information version of the game was solved by chen , rosenberg and shepp @xcite .",
    "the relation between players is as follows .",
    "the players have numbers : @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "when an item appears then player @xmath1 always has the first opportunity to decide whether to hire the applicant or not ( unless she has hired one already ) .",
    "one can say that player @xmath1 has priority .",
    "if player @xmath1 does not hire the current applicant , then player @xmath2 can decide whether to hire the applicant or not ( unless she has hired one already ) .",
    "if neither player hires the current applicant , they interview the next applicant .",
    "the interview process continues until both players have hired an applicant .",
    "a hired applicant does not hesitate and accepts an offer without any delay or additional conditions .",
    "the games in this group of papers have the same strategic scheme as in game [ caseb ] .",
    "the concept of equal priority of the players in the selection process in a model of a non - zero - sum game related to bcp was introduced by fushimi @xcite .",
    "szajowski @xcite extended this model to permit random priority .",
    "ramsey and szajowski @xcite considered a mathematical model of competitive selection with random priority and random acceptance of the offer ( uncertain employment ) by candidates .",
    "uncertain employment is a source of additional problems , which are solved as follows . at each moment",
    "@xmath3 the candidate is presented to both players .",
    "if neither player has yet obtained an object then :    ( i ) : :    if only one of them would like to accept the state , then he tries to    take it . in this case the random mechanism assigns the availability of    the state ( which can depend on the player and the moment of decision    @xmath3 ) ; ( ii ) : :    if both of them are interested in this state , then the random device    chooses the player who will first solicit the state .",
    "the availability    of the state is the same as in the situation when only one player    wants to take it .",
    "if the chosen player obtains the state , he stops    searching ; ( iii ) : :    if this state is not available to the player chosen by the random    device , then the observed state at moment @xmath3 is lost to    both players .",
    "both players continue searching by inspecting the next    state .    when one player has obtained a candidate the other player continues searching alone .",
    "if this player wishes to accept a candidate , the probability that it is available to him is the same as in point ( i ) above .",
    "when a non - zero - sum game does not have a unique nash equilibrium , then communication between the players would be useful in deciding which equilibrium should be played .",
    "using the idea of correlated strategies introduced by @xcite , the set of possible strategies is extended to the set of correlated stopping times and the actions undertaken by the players are correlated .",
    "little research has been carried out on the role of communication between players in stopping games . @xcite and",
    "@xcite consider correlated equilibria in general dynamic games .",
    "the form of correlation is not unique .",
    "the approach applied here is based on a generalisation of randomised stopping times .",
    "various additional criteria used by the players to correlate their actions restrict the set of possible solutions .",
    "these criteria are based on those used in @xcite , which resemble ideas of solutions of cooperative games presented in @xcite .",
    "strategies of staff selection based on the construction of correlated strategies according to various selection criteria are presented in the setting adopted by baston and garnaev @xcite .",
    "correlated strategy selection was proposed by the authors in @xcite .",
    "the construction of correlated equilibria in stopping games is based on the concept of correlated equilibria in two - by - two bimatrix games .",
    "the geometry of correlated equilibria in bimatrix games is described by calv - armengol @xcite .",
    "@xcite introduced a correlation scheme in randomised strategies for non - zero - sum games extending the concept of nash equilibrium . using this approach some process of preplay communication",
    "is needed to realise such a strategy .",

    "is assumed to be defined by preplay communication between the players ( either before the start of the game or before each decision ) with the possible aid of an `` external judge '' .",

    "if communication may occur at each decision point , then such a correlation is said to be an extensive ( autonomous ) correlation device ( see @xcite ) . in general",
    ", we consider extensive correlation devices .",
    "the form of the correlated strategy is known to both players .",
    "if one player carries out the actions suggested by the external judge with the aid of the appropriate lottery and the other player departs from the suggested action a formal construction of the possible strategies and the calculation of the expected gains should be done .",
