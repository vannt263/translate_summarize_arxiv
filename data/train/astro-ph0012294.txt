    "to fill the gap between the existing shallow wide - field ir surveys ( e.g. , 2mass , denis ) and deep surveys over small fields of view , we have begun a near - ir imaging survey on the 2.5 m int using the cirsi mosaic imager ( beckett et al .",
    "1996 ; mackay et al .",
    "cirsi has an instantaneous field of view of 15.6  @xmath4 15.6  on the int ( 0.45 arcsec pixel@xmath5 ) , making it ideally suited to large area survey programs of moderate depth ( h = 1920 ) .",
    "in particular , the survey aims to cover 50 deg@xmath0 in the j and h bands with 5 sigma limits of j = 20.6 , h = 19.1 ( @xmath6 magnitudes fainter than 2mass ) during a total of @xmath7 nights in the spring of 2000 and 2001 .",
    "even with this modest investment of telescope time we sample a local volume @xmath8% that of 2mass .",
    "thus far we have obtained j and h observations covering @xmath9 deg@xmath0 in a southern galactic cap equatorial strip and several 30  @xmath4 30  mosaic images in the elais , lockman hole , and xmm fields . the fields were chosen to overlap datasets at other wavelengths , including the deep optical observations of the int wide field survey ( mcmahon et al .",
    "2000 ) , and the xmm x - ray data .",
    "the cirsi near - ir survey has several scientific objectives , including identifying and measuring the space density of cool white dwarfs and t dwarfs , and selecting quasars and damped lyman-@xmath10 absorption systems at ir wavelengths ( see warren et al .",
    "the predicted surface density of qsos with @xmath11 and h @xmath12 is 510 deg@xmath13 , and thus in 50 deg@xmath0 we expect 250500 qsos with @xmath11 .",
    "the number density of damped lyman-@xmath10 ( dla ) systems is dn / dz @xmath14 0.1 ( storrie - lombardi , mcmahon , and irwin 1996 ) , and thus 2550 dla systems should be detected .",
    "these dla systems are important for comparison to the previous samples detected via optically selected quasars , given the expected bias of the optically derived samples against lines of sight that may contain gas rich dusty galaxies ( pei & fall 1995 ) .    here",
    "we present the first results from a reddening independent quasar selection technique based on combined optical and near - ir color diagrams .",
    "as shown in figure  1 using model quasar colors , the reddening vector in the ( g @xmath3 z ) / ( z @xmath3 h ) color diagram does not drive quasars into the stellar locus ( in contrast to purely optical colour - colour plots ) . the corresponding observed color diagram for a 30  @xmath4 30mosaic image in the elais region",
    "is shown in figure  2 .",
    "the cirsi data were reduced using an automated pipeline ( sabbey et al .",
    "2000 ) , and a sextractor object catalog was created and merged with the existing wide field survey optical catalog in this field to produce the color diagram .",
    "object identifications from wiyn hydra follow - up spectroscopy are labelled in the figure .",
    "hydra observations were obtained for a total of four fields during 2 and 3 september 2000 , confirming 80 quasars at redshifts @xmath15 ( including optical - only selected quasars ) , and reductions and interpretation are still in progress .",
    "the preliminary result is that quasar selection using the ( g @xmath3 z ) / ( z @xmath3 h ) diagram is a viable technique and is expected to be insensitive to reddening .",
