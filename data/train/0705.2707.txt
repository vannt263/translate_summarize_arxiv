    "since tubules were fabricated successfully from chiral lipid molecules , chiral lipid structures have attracted much experimental attention @xcite .",

    "et al . _ have investigated the chiral lipid tubules formed from various proportions of left- and right - handed dc@xmath3 molecules and found that they are of similar radii @xcite , which reveals that the radii of chiral tubules do not depend on the strength of the molecular chirality .",
    "fang s group has carefully resolved the molecular tilting order in the tubules and concluded that the projected direction of the molecules on the tubular surfaces departs 45@xmath2 from the equator of the tubules at the uniform tilting state @xcite .",
    "helical ripples in lipid tubules are also observed by the same group with atomic force microscopy @xcite .",
    "their pitch angles are found to be concentrated on about 5@xmath2 and 28@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "cholesterol is another kind of chiral molecules used in the experiments where helical stripes with pitch angles @xmath4 and @xmath5 are usually observed @xcite .",
    "additionally , oda _ et al .",
    "_ have reported twisted ribbons of achiral cationic amphiphiles interacting with chiral tartrate counterions @xcite .",
    "it is found that the twisted ribbons can be tuned by the introduction of opposite - handed chiral counterions in various proportions @xcite . from the experimental data @xcite",
    ", we see that the ratio between the width and pitch of the ribbons is proportional to the relative concentration difference of left- and right - handed enantiomers in the low relative concentration difference region .",
    "can we interpret all or at least most of above experimental results within a unified theory ?",
    "there are several theoretical discussions on chiral lipid membranes ( clms ) in the previous literature , where the chiral molecules are assumed to be in a smectic c@xmath6 phase at which the direction of the molecules is tilted from the normal of the membranes at a constant angle .",
    "the possible free energy of clms is discussed by helfrich and prost from symmetry arguments @xcite .",
    "their theory has been further developed and applied in many studies @xcite .",
    "nelson and powers have investigated the thermal fluctuations of clms @xcite .",
    "et al . _ have discussed tubules with helically modulated tilting state and helical ripples in tubules @xcite .",
    "komura and ou - yang have given an explanation to the high - pitch helical stripes of cholesterol molecules @xcite .",
    "due to the complicated form of the free energy used in these theories @xcite , it is almost impossible to obtain the general euler - lagrange equations corresponding to the free energy .",
    "thus one can not determine whether a configuration , such as a twisted ribbon , a tubule with helically modulated tilting state or a helical stripe , is a true equilibrium structure or not .",
    "this difficulty was always ignored in previous discussion of both tubules with helically modulated tilting state and helical stripes @xcite .",
    "can we confront this difficulty and construct a more concise theory of clms consistent with the experiments , in which we can unambiguously say which configuration is a genuine equilibrium structure ?",
    "we will address these questions in this paper , which is organized as follows : in sec .",

    "we predict a torus with the ratio between its two generated radii larger than @xmath1 , which has not yet been observed in the experiments on self - assembled clms . in sec .",
    "[ openclms ] , we present the euler - lagrange equations and boundary conditions for clms with free edges and use them to discuss experimental data @xcite .",
    "[ summary ] is a brief summary and discussion . in the appendixes ,",
    "we briefly derive the euler - lagrange equations for clms without free edges and the euler - lagrange equations as well as boundary conditions for clms with free edges through the variational method @xcite developed by one of the present authors .",
    "several mathematical details are also put in the appendixes .",
    "following the above theories @xcite , we adopt a concise form of free energy density for a clm which consists of the following contributions .",
    "\\(i ) the bending and surface energy per area is taken as helfrich s form @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are bending rigidities , and @xmath10 the surface tension .",
    "@xmath11 is the spontaneous curvature reflecting the asymmetrical factors between two sides of the membrane . @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the mean curvature and gaussian curvature of the membrane , respectively , which can be expressed as @xmath14 , @xmath15 by the two principal curvature radii @xmath16 and @xmath17 . the curvature energy in eq.([frhelfr ] ) is invariant under the coordinate rotation around the normal of the membrane surface , but will change under the inversion of the normal if @xmath18 .",
    "\\(ii ) the energy per area originating from the chirality of tilting molecules has the form @xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 reflects the strength of the molecular chirality which usually determines the handedness of clms  the clms with the opposite handedness will be observed in experiments if @xmath20 changes its sign @xcite . without losing the generality",
    ", we only discuss the case of @xmath21 in this paper .",
    "@xmath22 is the geodesic torsion along the unit vector @xmath23 at some point . here",
    "@xmath23 represents the projected direction of the lipid molecules in the experiments @xcite and chiral tartrate counterions in the experiment @xcite on the membrane surface , respectively .",
    "if we take a right - handed orthonormal frame @xmath24 with @xmath25 being the normal vector of the membrane as shown in fig .",
    "[ figframe ] , @xmath23 can be expressed as @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the angle between @xmath23 and @xmath28 . at this frame",
    ", the curvature tensor can be expressed as a matrix with element @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 shown in appendix  [ appdmfm ] . with the curvature tensor",
    ", the geodesic torsion along @xmath23 can be expressed as @xcite @xmath32 which is the same as the chiral term in the previous literature , such as the last term of eq.(2 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite , eq.(3 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite , and the third term of eq.(2.1 ) in ref .",
    "in particular , for the principal frame , the above equation is simplified as @xmath33 we will confine @xmath27 to the region ( @xmath34 because of the relation @xmath35 . moreover , it is easy to see that the geodesic torsion along the mirror image of @xmath23 with respect to @xmath28 changes its sign because @xmath36 under the reflection with respect to @xmath28",
    ". thus this term breaks the inversion symmetry in the tangent plane at each point of the membrane , which allows us to distinguish the handedness .",
    "additionally , from eq.([torsioninpr ] ) we can see that the minimum of eq.([chiralen ] ) , @xmath37 is reached when @xmath23 departs from the principal direction at a angle @xmath38 or @xmath39 for a given shape of the membrane . here",
    "the sign in front of @xmath40 depends on the sign of @xmath41 .",
    "the larger difference between @xmath16 and @xmath17 is , the larger absolute value of @xmath42 is reached . in other words , the chiral term favors saddle surfaces ( for example , the twisted ribbons in sec .",
    "[ sectwr ] ) whose two principal curvature radii @xmath16 and @xmath17 have opposite signs .",

    "( b ) surface with boundary curve where @xmath43 is the tangent vector of the boundary curve , and @xmath44 , in the tangent plane of the surface , is perpendicular to @xmath43.,width=264 ]    \\(iii ) the energy per area due to the orientational variation of @xmath23 is taken as @xcite @xmath45,\\ ] ] where @xmath46 is a constant in the dimension of energy .",
    "this is the simplest term of energy cost due to tilting order invariant under the coordinate rotation around the normal of the membrane surface .",
    "@xmath47 is the 2-dimensional ( 2d ) gradient operator on the membrane surface , and the 2d cross product `` @xmath48 '' gives a scalar . by defining a spin connection field",
    "@xmath49 satisfying @xmath50 @xcite , one can derive @xmath51 through simple calculations .",
    "the total free energy density adopted in the present paper , @xmath52 , has the following concise form : @xmath53 where @xmath54 .",
    "this special form might arguably be the most natural and concise construction including the bending , chirality and tilting order , for the given vector field @xmath23 and normal vector field @xmath25 .",
    "of course , using these two fields , one can also construct more general free energy densities which contain much more terms @xcite .",
    "compared with the general form , our special form is simplified in two aspects : ( i ) the contributions of the bending of membranes and the orientational elasticity of @xmath23 are taken as the isotropic forms ; ( ii ) there is no additional coupling between @xmath23 and the curvature of membranes except the chiral term ( [ chiralen ] ) , which makes it a concise theory .",
    "although our free energy density is not new relative to the general form appearing in the previous literature , we derive for the first time the corresponding euler - lagrange equations without any assumption on the shapes of membranes before doing the variation , and then check which configuration solves the euler - lagrange equations .",
    "more importantly , in the following , we will see that most of the experimental results can be explained in terms of such a concise free energy density .",
    "clms without free edges usually correspond to closed vesicles . here",
    "a long enough tubule , where the end effect is neglected , is also regarded as a clm without free edges . in this section ,",
    "we show the euler - lagrange equations of clms without free edges ( derived briefly in appendix  [ appendelclose ] ) , and then discuss clms in spherical , tubular and torus shapes .",
    "as we will see , our theoretical results are in good agreement with the experiments @xcite .",
    "the free energy for a closed clm can be expressed as @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the area element of the membrane and @xmath57 the volume element enclosed by the vesicle .",
    "@xmath58 is either the pressure difference between the outer and inner sides of the vesicle or used to implement a volume constraint . for tubular configuration , we usually take @xmath59 .    using the variational method @xcite , we obtain the euler - lagrange equations corresponding to the free energy ( [ closedfe ] ) as @xmath60 and @xmath61\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\hspace{-0.5cm}+k_{f } [ ( \\kappa_{\\mathbf{v}}-h ) \\mathbf{v}^{2}- \\nabla\\mathbf{v}\\colon\\nabla\\mathbf{e}_3 ] = 0,\\label{el2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath62 and @xmath63 are the normal curvature along the directions of @xmath23 and @xmath64 , respectively .",
    "they can be expressed as eqs.([normalcur ] ) and ( [ norcurinv ] ) with the curvature tensor .",
    "physically , eqs.([el1 ] ) and ( [ el2 ] ) express the moment and force balances along the normal @xmath25 at each point of the membrane . if @xmath20 and @xmath46 vanish , the above two equations degenerate into the shape equation of achiral lipid vesicles , which has been fully discussed in refs .  @xcite .    two remarks are necessary concerning eq.([el1 ] ) : ( i ) we have selected the proper gauge such that @xmath65 , or else @xmath66 should be replaced with @xmath67 .",
    "( ii ) for closed vesicles different from toroidal topology , the tangent vector field @xmath23 will have singular points . in this case",
    ", the right - hand term should be replaced with the sum of @xmath68-function , @xmath69 , where @xmath70 and @xmath71 represent any point and singular point in the clm , while @xmath72 represents the strength of the source or vortex at the singular point @xmath71 .      for spherical vesicles of chiral lipid molecules , @xmath22 is always vanishing because @xmath73 .",
    "thus the free energy ( [ closedfe ] ) is independent of the molecular chirality and permits the same probability of left- and right - handed spherical vesicles existing in solution .",
    "naturally , no evident circular dichroism signal would be observed , which is consistent with the experiment @xcite .",
    "of course , we can not exclude the other possible explanation of this experiment that the lipid molecules are non - tilting in the spherical vesicles @xcite .",
    "a tubule is regarded as an cylinder with radius @xmath74 and infinite length .",
    "then @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 , where @xmath27 is the angle between @xmath23 and the equator of the cylinder .",
    "@xmath27 is a constant for the tubule with the uniform tilting state as shown in fig .",
    "[ tubules](a ) . thus eq.([el1 ] ) requires @xmath78 we should keep @xmath79 because it corresponds to the local minimum of @xmath80 , which is in good agreement with the experiment by fang s group @xcite where the projected direction of the molecules on the tubular surfaces indeed departing 45@xmath2 from the equator of the tubules with the uniform tilting state .    for the cylindrical shape , we set @xmath59 .",
    "it is easy to find @xmath81 and @xmath82 both to be vanishing for @xmath79 .",
    "thus eq.([el2 ] ) is transformed into @xmath83 this equation indicates that the radius @xmath74 of chiral lipid tubules is independent of the strength of molecular chirality @xmath20 , which is consistent with the experiment @xcite where the tubular radius is insensitive to the proportion of left- and right - handed dc@xmath3 in the tubule .",
    "however , we can not exclude the other possible explanation that dc@xmath3 molecules with different handedness are not mixed in the tubule such that each tubule in solution contains merely the one kind of molecules with the same handedness ether left- or right - handed @xcite .",

    "we will directly investigate the orientational variation by using the euler - lagrange equation ( [ el1 ] ) without this assumption .",
    "additionally , as mentioned in the introduction , whether the tubules with helically modulated titling state are equilibrium configurations or not is not addressed in ref .",

    "their implications for extant and future experiments can be summarized as follows .",
    "\\(i ) our theory predicts the same probability for left- and right - handed spherical vesicles existing in solution .",
    "thus no evident circular dichroism signal should be observed , which is consistent with the experiment @xcite .",
    "\\(ii ) the radius of a tubule at uniform tilting state satisfies eq.([tubradius ] ) .",
    "it reveals that the radius is independent of molecular chirality , which is consistent with the experiment @xcite where the tubular radius is insensitive to the proportion of left- and right - handed dc@xmath3 in the tubule .",
    "we find that the projected direction of the molecules on the tubular surface departs 45@xmath2 from the equator of the tubule with the uniform tilting state , which is in good agreement with the experiment @xcite .",
    "\\(iii ) tubules with helically modulated tilting state are not admitted by the euler - lagrange equation ( [ el2 ] ) for non - vanishing @xmath20 .",
    "the orientational variation of the tilting lipid molecules breaks the force balance along the normal direction of the tubule .",
    "thus a tubule with helically modulated tilting state is not an equilibrium structure within our theoretical framework .",
    "\\(iv ) helical ripples in tubules are equilibrium structures .",
    "the pitch angle of helical ripples is estimated as about 0@xmath2 and 35@xmath2 for @xmath111 , which are close to the experimental values 5@xmath2 and 28@xmath2 observed by fang s group @xcite .",
    "\\(v ) tori with a ratio of generated radii larger than @xmath1 are predicted by our theory , eq.([torusrad ] ) , which have not yet been observed in the experiments .",
    "\\(vi ) helical stripes with free edges at either uniform tilting state or helical modulated tilting state are not possible equilibrium configurations .",
    "\\(vii ) twisted ribbons satisfy euler - lagrange equations ( [ el3 ] ) , ( [ el4 ] ) and boundary conditions ( [ bc1])([bc4 ] ) .",
    "the ratio between the width and pitch of the ribbons is proportional to the relative concentration difference of left- and right - handed enantiomers in the low relative concentration difference region , which is in good agreement with the experiment @xcite .",
    "finally , we have to list a few open problems which should be addressed in the future work .",
    "\\(i ) within the present theory , we can not give a simple explanation for the experiments on clms of pure cholesterol @xcite where helical stripes with pitch angles @xmath4 and @xmath5 are usually observed .",
    "it has recently been found that the cholesterol helical stripes have good crystal structure @xcite , which is out of the range of our theory .",
    "there might be two possible ramifications based on the present theory : one would be to include anisotropic bending effects @xcite in the free energy density ( [ energy2 ] ) ; another one would be to consider a line tension @xmath166 depending on the angle between the directions of the tilting and the free edges @xcite in the free energy ( [ openfe ] ) .",
    "\\(ii ) we can not yet interpret the twisted ribbon - to - tubule transition with increasing the relative concentration difference of the left- and right - handed enantiomers reported in the recent experiment by oda s group @xcite .",
    "a possible reason is that the parameters except @xmath20 in our theory are independent of the relative concentration difference @xcite .",
    "additionally , the ribbons and tubules observed in this experiment are usually multi - bilayer structures @xcite .",
    "then a decoupling effect @xcite between neighbor bilayers might occur . an extended theory including these two factors",
    "might be required to investigate the mechanism responsible for the transition .",
    "\\(iii ) we have ignored the effect of singular points in clms . although the features of singular points in 2d planar films or achiral nematic spherical , torus vesicles and other manifolds have been fully investigated in previous literature @xcite , it remains a challenge to study the properties of singular points in clms @xcite .",

    "<S> the pitch angles of helical ripples are theoretically estimated to be about 0@xmath2 and 35@xmath2 , which are close to the most frequent values 5@xmath2 and 28@xmath2 observed in the experiment [ n. mahajan _ </S>",
