    "observations have suggested that , in some molecular clouds , most of the gas - phase oxygen might be in atomic form , in contradiction with predictions of steady state chemical models ( e.g. , lee , bettens & herbst 1996 ) which yield co , o , and o@xmath11 as the major oxygen bearing species in molecular clouds .",

    "further evidence has been obtained from observations of the [ ]  63.2  @xmath0 m fine structure line which has been detected in absorption against the far - infrared continuum of bright galactic sources , namely : dr  21 ( poglitsch et al . 1996 ) , sgr  b2 ( baluteau et al . 1997 ) and ngc  6334v ( kraemer et al .",

    "n. combining these observations with molecular ( co and its isotopes ) and  observations , they showed that both molecular and atomic clouds absorb the strong continuum at 63  @xmath0 m , and disentangled the absorption due to the molecular clouds from the absorption due to the atomic (  ) clouds .",
    "they concluded that the major part of the 63.2  @xmath0 m [ ]  absorption is due to the cold molecular clouds along the line of sight and , through the computation of o@xmath5/co ratio , that in these clouds the gaseous oxygen is almost totally in atomic form .",
    "similar results were obtained toward sgr  b2 by lis et al .",
    "they found three [ ]  63.2  @xmath0 m absorption components corresponding to foreground clouds , for which the oxygen content of the atomic halo gas could be estimated based on  observations .",
    "lis et al . ( 2001 ) found that the remaining o@xmath5 column density is correlated with the observed @xmath12co column density , corresponding to an average o@xmath5/co ratio of about 9 and to an atomic oxygen abundance of 2.7 @xmath9 10@xmath13 in the dense gas phase .",
    "the full fabry - prot iso - lws spectrum which was obtained on sgr  b2 as part of the iso central program ( see baluteau et al . _ in preparation _ , for a detailed description ) enables us to study , at high spectral resolution , the atomic fine - structure of oxygen and carbon in this source and to analyze in a consistent way the profiles of the [ ]  lines at 63.2 and 145.5  @xmath0 m and of the [ ]  157.7  @xmath0 m line .",
    "sgr  b2 is the most massive star - forming region of an ensemble of dense cloud cores in the central ( @xmath14  pc ) region of the galaxy .",
    "its estimated mass is larger than @xmath15 ( lis , carlstrom & keene 1991 ) , and the high opacities found toward srg  b2 makes it one of the best candidate for absorption studies .",

    "each observation was carried out using a sampling interval of a quarter of a spectral resolution element with each data point repeated at least three times .",
    "the lws beam of approximately 80@xmath17 was centered at @xmath18 , @xmath19 ( j2000 ) . at this position the beam encompasses the sgr  b2 ( m ) source but not the sgr  b2 north and south sources ( following the nomenclature of goldsmith et al .",

    "no significant difference in the far - infrared continuum emission is found when our observations are compared with other aot l04 observations centered on sgr  b2 ( m ) .",

    "any rotating clouds that cross the line of sight could contribute to the @xmath6 0 km  s@xmath2 absorption and would be mixed with the absorption due to material within a few kpc from the sun .    the clouds along the line of sight of sgr  b2 are expected to be illuminated by uv photons from the mean interstellar radiation field incident on their external layers ( @xmath29 = 1 - 10 in units of the standard interstellar flux of 1.6 @xmath9 10@xmath30 erg  s@xmath2   @xmath8 , habing 1968 ) .",
    "following the traditional schematic geometry of the photo - dissociation regions ( hollenbach & tielens 1999 ) , three different major layers can be distinguished in the study of these clouds from their surface to their core .",

    "[ f2 ] ) . before performing any modelling of the absorption feature ,",
    "an estimate of the c@xmath4 emission component is required .",
    "the physical conditions prevailing in the external cloud layers , where c@xmath4 is the dominant part of the carbon , are assumed to be also valid for atomic oxygen where the [ ]  145.5  @xmath0 m line is emitted , due to the higher gas temperature found in these layers ( tielens & hollenbach 1985 ) .",

    "note that the fit at velocities above @xmath45 is not perfect , which is due to the lack of information at these velocities ( see , e.g. , garwood and dickey 1989 ) .",
    "another origin of this discrepancy could be due to the transient effects of the lws detectors ( caux et al .",
    "2002 ) , not corrected in this data set . however , this has no implication for the following results since we are concerned with clouds at velocities lower than 10 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "the [ ]  157.7 @xmath0 m optical depth can be linked to the line width and to the c@xmath4 column density , for a given density and temperature ( see , e.g. , crawford et al .",
    "for densities lower that 3.3 @xmath9 10@xmath46 cm@xmath30 , a reasonable estimate of the c@xmath4 column density for all temperatures is :    @xmath48    where the line width @xmath33v is in km  s@xmath2 .",

    "are o@xmath5 and c@xmath4 .",
    "the variation of their abundances is poorly known at galactocentric distances lower than 5 kpc .",
    "the standard cosmic ratio o / c of 2.3 is used to compute the column density of atomic oxygen in the external layers of the clouds ( table  2 , column 6 ) .",
    "this standard ratio is obtained using the cosmic abundance compared to hydrogen in the gas phase of 1.4 @xmath9 10@xmath13 for carbon ( cardelli et al .",
    "1996 ) and 3.2 @xmath9 10@xmath13 for oxygen ( meyer , jura & cardelli 1998 ) .",
    "the total column density of atomic oxygen in the external layers of clouds at @xmath32 lower than 10  km  s@xmath2 is estimated to be 8.5 @xmath9 10@xmath7 @xmath8 .    since the density in the external layers",
    "is believed to be low ( generally less than 10@xmath46  cm@xmath30 ) , we can safely assume that , in the absorbing region , the majority of oxygen atoms are in the ground state",
    ". therefore the column density of atomic oxygen is directly proportional to the optical depth ( spitzer 1978 ) as follows :    @xmath49    @xmath50    where @xmath51 is the statistical weight of level @xmath52 , @xmath53 = 8.46 @xmath9 10@xmath54 s@xmath2 ( baluja & zeippen 1988 ) is the einstein coefficient , @xmath55 = 63.184 @xmath0 m , @xmath42 is the optical depth at line center and @xmath33v(o@xmath5 ) is the full width at half maximum in km  s@xmath2 of the absorption line .    in the external part of the clouds , the absorption by atomic oxygen , parametrized by @xmath34(o ) ,",
    "is computed using the measured  line width and the derived column density of atomic oxygen ( see table  [ tab2 ] ) . above 15 km",
    "s@xmath2 , due to the expected presence of an [ ]  63.2  @xmath0 m emission line around 60  km  s@xmath2 from the compact regions in the core of the sgr  b2 complex , the absorption by atomic oxygen in foreground clouds can not be defined .",
    "again , this has no implication on our results since we restrict our study to clouds with velocities lower than 10 km  s@xmath2 . the resulting spectrum is then convolved with the instrumental profile of the lws - fp at 63  @xmath0 m and compared to the observations ( fig .",
    "[ f7 ] ) .    a clear result deduced from fig .",
    "[ f7 ] is that an important fraction of the observed absorption can not be accounted for solely by the external layers of the clouds at velocities lower than 10  km  s@xmath2 .",

    "for each cloud the derived ratio of the neutral oxygen column densities of the molecular cores to the whole cloud ( external layers + molecular cores ) is given in column 5 .",
    "this ratio is indicative of the importance in mass of the molecular core(s ) within each cloud .",
    "two clouds ( labelled b and e ) are found not to be associated with any significant molecular core .",
    "as indicated in section 3.3 , the molecular cores along the line of sight to sgr b2 provide an atomic oxygen column density about three times that due to the diffuse external layers of the clouds .",
    "the  column densities of the diffuse atomic components seen along the line of sight to sgr  b2  ( m ) can be computed with the standard relation :    @xmath63    where ( t@xmath64 ) is the  spin temperature . through observations of hydrogen absorption features in the direction of sgr b2 ,",
    "cohen ( 1977 ) derived the spin temperature of each absorbing cloud .",
    "however , the radio beam ( 13@xmath65 by 13@xmath65 angular resolution ) , is much too large compared to the iso / lws one , and their determination of the spin temperature can not be used in our study . to derive an  column density for each cloud along the line of sight to sgr b2 ,",
    "in the range of velocities between @xmath22110 and + 10 km  s@xmath2 , we used a standard value of 150 k for the spin temperature ( value well within the range derived by cohen , 1977 ) .",
    "the resulting  column density is given in columns 6 of table [ tab4 ] .",
    "the total column density of atomic hydrogen in the clouds listed in table [ tab4 ] is about 1.6 @xmath9 10@xmath66 @xmath8 .",
    "assuming that the standard ratio a@xmath67/n(h )  =  5.3  @xmath9  10@xmath68 @xmath8 applies , we calculated that the clouds along the line of sight have a diffuse atomic hydrogen surface layer with a@xmath67 between 0.1 and 4.4 ( see column 7 of table [ tab4 ] ) .",
    "it appears that the lower the galactocentric distance is , the lower the visual extinction of this layer is .",
    "this could be explained by the higher fuv interstellar radiation field encountered at smaller galactocentric distances , leading to a sharpening of the atomic  layer as indicated by pdr models ( hollenbach & tielens 1999 ) .",
    "however , the identified  clouds may be separated into several smaller clouds if they were viewed at higher resolution .",
    "the computed values of the visual exctinction in each of the identified clouds should be taken as an average value and can not be significantly indicative of their characteristics .    the computed values for the c@xmath4 abundance compared to atomic hydrogen ( column 8 of table [ tab4 ] ) in the cloud external layers",
    "are always found larger than the cosmic value in the gas phase of 1.4 @xmath9 10@xmath13 ( cardelli et al .",
    "1996 ) , except in one case ( cloud e at @xmath2252 km  s@xmath2 ) .",
    "this is compatible with the picture of 2 external layers : the first one where c@xmath4 is coexistent with atomic hydrogen and the second one , deeper in the cloud , where c@xmath4 is coexistent with molecular hydrogen .",
    "the derived value of c@xmath4/h then provides a method to estimate the mass of the regions filled by c@xmath4 and  ( as the second layer was not included separately in the calculation ) .",
    "assuming a c / h cosmic ratio valid for all the clouds , we found that the mass in the c@xmath4/  and c@xmath4/h@xmath11 layers should be approximately the same , which is consistent with what is found for standard pdrs models ( hollenbach & tielens 1999 ) .",
    "the o@xmath5 column densities of the six clouds exhibiting molecular core are plotted versus their co column densities in figure [ f9 ] , with the assumption about the galactocentric variation of the @xmath12c/@xmath60c ratio as given above .",
    "there is a clear linear correlation between n(o@xmath5 ) and n(co ) , except for cloud h ( at 1.7 km  s@xmath2 ) which is believed to result from a blending of clouds with uncertain galactocentric distances .",
    "we performed a linear least - square fit ( n(o@xmath5 )  =  a  +  bn(co ) ) taking into account that both n(co ) and n(o@xmath5 ) data have errors .",
    "this method based on the minimization of the @xmath69 function leads to the estimation of the a and b parameters .",
    "the @xmath69 function is defined by :    @xmath70    where @xmath71 is the difference between the observed and fitted value of n(o@xmath5 ) , and @xmath72 is the weighted sum of the variance in the direction of the smallest @xmath69 between each data point and the line with slope b. @xmath73 and @xmath74 are , respectively , the n(co ) and n(o@xmath5 ) standard deviation for the i@xmath75 point .",
    "the resulting slope is 2.5 @xmath76 1.8 and the intersection point with the n(o@xmath5)-axis gives an excess amount of atomic oxygen with an average column density of ( 5.6  @xmath76  2.0 )  @xmath9  10@xmath77  @xmath8 .",
    "this atomic oxygen in excess is interpreted as due to an intermediate layer between the c@xmath4 external layer and the co core where the atomic oxygen coexist with the atomic carbon , as predicted by pdr models .    from theoretical pdr models ,",
    "a layer of neutral atomic carbon should exist near the surfaces of molecular clouds or clumps within clouds where the uv interstellar radiation field strikes these surfaces ( e. g. tielens & hollenbach 1985 ) as part of the c@xmath4/c / co transition region .",
    "observations by plume , jaffe & keene ( 1994 ) confirmed that the c@xmath5 emission may arise from pdrs on the surfaces of the molecular clumps distributed throughout the molecular cloud .",
    "as discussed in tielens & hollenbach ( 1985 ) and hollenbach , takahashi & tielens ( 1991 ) , the column density of neutral carbon is insensitive to the strength of the external fuv field . only the depth at which the c@xmath4/c / co transition occurs depends on the fuv field .",
    "this strengthens the case for having a constant atomic carbon column density in all our clouds .",
    "+ using the cosmic o / c ratio introduced previously with our observations , we deduce an average column density for atomic carbon in each cloud along the line of sight to sgr b2 of ( 2.4 @xmath76 0.9 ) @xmath9 10@xmath77 @xmath8 .",

    "a summary of previous measurements of the c@xmath5/co ratio in galactic interstellar clouds is illustrated in figure 9 of usuda et al .",
    "( _ in preparation _ ) where this ratio is plotted against the cloud visual extinction .",
    "the highest values of this ratio ( between 2 and 20 ) are obtained in diffuse interstellar clouds ( federman et al . 1980 ) while the lowest values ( ranging from 0.03 to 0.3 ) are found in dense photo - dissociation regions ( keene et al .",
    "the general slope of the c@xmath5/co vs a@xmath80 relation indicates that the column density of c@xmath5 is relatively constant in clouds with visual extinction greater than unity .",
    "our derived values of the c@xmath5/co ratio are consistent with this general relation ; clouds c and d could be classified as diffuse clouds ( e.g. federman et al .",
    "1980 ) where c@xmath5/co = [ 16.2 , 8.1 ] , clouds a and g as translucent clouds ( e.g. stark & van dishoeck 1994 ) where c@xmath5/co = [ 1.2 , 4.0 ] and cloud f as a dense cloud ( e.g. schilke et al .",

    "values for the c@xmath4/c@xmath5 ratio in the six clouds associated with a molecular core can be derived from this study .",
    "while clouds close to the galactic center ( labelled a , c and d ) yield a c@xmath4/c@xmath5 ratio less than 0.7 , those at galactocentric distance of 3 - 4 kpc ( f and g ) have ratios close to 2.5 . for g@xmath79/n @xmath81 3 @xmath9",
    "10@xmath30 cm@xmath46 , the c@xmath4/c / co transition is drawn to the cloud surface ( kaufman et al .",

    "give estimates of the column density of the associated neutral oxygen .",
    "therefore , the actual column density of neutral oxygen in the region where co is the major carbon reservoir can be derived , leading to a better estimate of the true n(o@xmath5)/n(co ) ratio in the molecular clouds along the line of sight to sgr b2 . however , because of the large uncertainties still present a mean value , derived from the slope of the linear correlation between n(o@xmath5 ) and n(co ) appears more relevant than individual values . taking into account the errors presented in the previous section",
    ", it appears that the o@xmath5/co ratio is lower than 4.3 and larger than 0.7 with a best fit value of 2.5 .",
    "it is in good agreement with the 1.8 value found by goldsmith ( 2001 : see his table 3 ) taking into account a molecular depletion in dark cloud cores .",
    "furthermore , this value is within the same range of magnitude than the values computed with standard models for dense interstellar clouds in steady states ( lee , bettens & herbst 1996 ) .",
    "+ our derived o@xmath5/co ratio implies that @xmath6 70% of gaseous oxygen is in the atomic form and not locked into co in the molecular clouds along the sgr  b2 line of sight .",
    "the upper ( respectively lower ) limits of this ratio corresponds to @xmath6 80% ( respectively 40% ) of the gaseous oxygen in the atomic form .    the value derived here should be compared to the lower limit of 15 for the o / co ratio obtained for molecular clouds along the w49n hii region line of sight ( vastel et al .",
    "note that the [ ]  157.7 @xmath0 m profile of this source does not present any trace of either emission or absorption components at the velocities of the distant clouds .",
    "the physical and chemical characteristics of the clouds in these two lines of sight seem very different and can not then be directly connected .",
    "furthermore , the lack of information on the intermediate neutral carbon layer in the clouds along the w49n line of sight leads to slightly overvalue the o / co ratio . + considering the calculated uncertainties , we can not directly determine the exact oxygen budget in these molecular clouds .",
    "however , only the lower limit on the o@xmath5/co ratio is consistent with the predictions of steady states models and though we can not exclude values as low as this ( o@xmath5/co @xmath6 1 ) , the probability of larger ratios is much higher .",
    "the oxygen chemistry in dense clouds is still not well known as it is very difficult to reproduce the o@xmath11 and h@xmath11o abundances limits measured by swas .",
    "further observations of the o@xmath5 , o@xmath11 and h@xmath11o species will provide important clues to constrain the chemistry in these cold molecular clouds .",
    "the [ ]  fine structure transition at 157.741 @xmath0 m is the major coolant of the warm interstellar medium .",
    "carbon is the fourth most abundant element and has a lower ionization potential ( 11.26 ev ) than hydrogen .",
    "therefore , carbon is in the form of c@xmath4 on the surface of far uv illuminated neutral gas clouds .",
    "in addition , the c@xmath4 line is relatively easy to excite , so that the line can efficiently cool the warm neutral gas .",
    "depending on the density in this layer , the line may be self - absorbed .",
    "the first observational evidence of an absorption feature in the c@xmath4 spectrum has been carried out by the kuiper astronomical observatory toward the w51 hii region ( zmuidzinas , 1987 ) .",
    "the absorption feature in its profile was attributed to a separate `` cooler '' low density foreground cloud .",
    "recently , studies of many bright galaxies showed that the [ ]  157.7 @xmath0 m line is deficient compared to the total fir luminosity .",
    "non detection or weak detection have been highlighted toward fir bright galaxies ( stacey et al .",
    "1991 ; malhotra et al .",

    "these observations were carried out at a much lower resolution than that used in our study of sgr b2 .",
    "our results indicate that if these galaxies were viewed at high spectral resolution , the spectra could reveal both emission and absorption components present in the c@xmath4 profile .",
    "this strengthens the idea that under certain conditions the c@xmath4 line could be optically thick in the direction of large star - forming complexes or in the nuclei of galaxies .",
    "using [ ]  157.7 @xmath83 , [ ]  63.2 and 145.5 @xmath83 line observations , we were able to distinguish between the contributions of the different layers within the galactic clouds along the line of sight to sgr  b2 .",

    "less than 30 % of this total o@xmath5 column density is found to be due to the external layers of the clouds ( where c@xmath4 is the major form of carbon ) .",
    "the method used in this study leads to an estimate of the oxygen content in the intermediate layer where c@xmath5 is the dominant form of carbon .",
    "the atomic carbon column densities derived here for the galactic clouds , with a mean value about 2.4 @xmath9 10@xmath77 @xmath8 , are in good agreement with recent observations of the [ ]  492 ghz line .",

    "<S> we derive lower limits for the column densities of atomic carbon and oxygen of the order of @xmath6 10@xmath7  @xmath8 and 3 @xmath9 10@xmath10  @xmath8 , respectively . an o@xmath5/co ratio of around 2.5 is computed in the internal cores of the clouds lying along the line of sight , which means that @xmath6 70% of gaseous oxygen is in the atomic form and not locked into co. the fact that the [ ]  157.7 @xmath0 m line is detected in absorption implies that the main cooling line of the interstellar medium can be optically thick especially in the direction of large star - forming complexes or in the nuclei of galaxies . </S>",
