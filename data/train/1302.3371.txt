    "the observed features of type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) have been well - understood by a thermonuclear explosion of a carbon - oxygen ( c+o ) white dwarf ( wd ) . both the chandrasekhar mass [ _ chandra ( ch ) _ model ] and the sub - chandrasekhar mass [ _ sub - chandra ( subch ) _ model ] have been presented ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , there has been no clear observational indication as to how the wd mass grows until carbon ignition ; i.e. , whether the wd accretes h / he - rich matter from its binary companion [ _ single degenerate ( sd ) _ scenario ] , or two c+o wds merge [ _ double degenerate ( dd ) _ scenario ] ( e.g. , @xcite , 2000 , 2009 , @xcite ) .",
    "even before these issues are resolved , several candidates of _ super - chandrasekhar _ mass explosions have been observed ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "recent modeling shows that dd merging could result in both the chandra and the ( effectively ) sub - chandra explosions .",
    "the sd scenario could also result in both the chandra and sub - chandra explosions . here",
    "we review such cross connections between ( dd , sd ) scenarios and ( chandra , sub - chandra ) models , and some observational constraints .",
    "\\(1 ) _ dd - subch _ : in the dd scenario , if the carbon detonation is induced near the wd surface in the early dynamical phase , it could result in the ( effectively ) sub - chandra explosion .",
    "( 2 ) _ dd - ch _ :",
    "if no detonation is induced , the wd could grow until the chandrasekhar mass is reached .",
    "the outcome depends on whether the quiescent carbon shell - burning is ignited and burns interior c+o into o+ne+mg .",
    "( 3 ) _ sd - subch _ : in the sd scenario , if the he shell - flashes grow strong to induce a he detonation , it leads to the sub - chandra explosion .",
    "( 4 ) _ sd - ch _ :",
    "if the he - shell flashes are not strong enough to induce a he detonation , such flashes produce interesting amount of intermediate mass elements , including si and s , as unburned material near the surface of c+o wd .",
    "in the dd scenario ( @xcite ) , two c+o wds form a close binary system after the common envelope phase and get closer by losing orbital angular momentum due to gravitational radiation .",
    "eventually , the less massive wd with a mass @xmath1 fills its roche lobe and dynamically evolves into the formation of a massive disk / envelope around the more massive wd with a mass @xmath2 .",
    "such a dynamical evolution of wd binary has been studied by number of authors ( @xcite ) using the smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) method .",
    "* surface carbon detonation : * the important question is whether the merging process ignites a surface carbon detonation in the wd . during the early merging process",
    ", the shock heating increases the temperature in the surface c+o layer of the primary ( i.e. , more massive ) wd . if the temperature becomes high enough to induce c - detonation ( @xcite adopted the critical temperature of 2.5 @xmath3 k ) , the detonation wave propagates through the central region of the primary wd .",
    "eventually , the whole primary wd is detonated and disrupted .",
    "this model is essentially the sub - chandra mass explosion , because the detonated wd has a sub - chandra mass of @xmath41.1@xmath5  and the central density is as low as @xmath6 g @xmath7 ( @xcite , 2011 ) .",
    "the explosion produce a larger amount of @xmath8ni for larger @xmath2 .",
    "suppose the surface c - detonation is not triggered in the early dynamical phase of merging .",
    "then the next important question is whether the merging process ignites not the c - detonation but `` quiescent '' off - center carbon burning in the wd .",
    "once carbon is ignited , carbon flame moves inward by heat conduction to reach the center ( @xcite , 1998 ) .",
    "the released nuclear energy is lost in neutrinos , and the c+o wd is converted into the o+ne+mg wd non - explosively .",
    "the onemg wds eventually collapse due to electron capture rather than exploding as sne ia ( @xcite , 1987 ) .",
    "attained 2.5 min after the start of merging of double c+o white dwarfs with masses ( @xmath2 , @xmath1 ) ( @xcite ) .",
    "for @xmath9 , off - center carbon burning is ignited . ]    here the carbon ignition temperature @xmath10 is defined by @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 denote the nuclear energy generation rate and the neutrino energy loss rate , respectively . at @xmath14@xmath15 g @xmath7 ,",
    "@xmath16 k ( @xcite ) .    for @xmath17 , @xmath18 and the carbon flash",
    "is ignited , and the conductive carbon flame propagates inward . if @xmath19 , on the contrary , @xmath20 and the neutrino cooling dominates to induce the gradual contraction of the c - rich envelope . then carbon flame is not formed .",
    "there are two possible cases for the off - center carbon ignition to occur .",
    "* case 1 * : when the falling materials from the less massive star compress the outer layer of the more massive star , the material could be heated up to high enough temperature to ignite carbon burning .",
    "* case 2 * : later , if the accretion rate exceeds a critical rate of @xmath21 yr@xmath22 , compressional heating exceeds radiative cooling and leads to carbon ignition ( @xcite ) .    for case 1 , (",
    "* yoon  ( 2007 ) ) calculated the merging process until 5 min after its start and showed that a quasi - static equilibrium configuration is reached consisting of a cold core , hot envelope , and a disk .",
    "the peak temperature @xmath23 reaches a stationary value . for @xmath4@xmath5  and @xmath24@xmath5 ,",
    "@xmath23 is marginally lower than @xmath10 . whether the later off - center carbon ignition of case 2 takes place depends on the effective accretion rate , which needs further study ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    for case 1 , (",
    "* nakasato & nomoto ( 2011 ) ) have recently conducted the sph simulation ( @xcite ) with the number of particles @xmath25 and @xmath26 for various combinations of ( @xmath2 , @xmath1 ) .",
    "the artificial viscosity is treated to minimize numerical effects according to the hybrid scheme proposed by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* rosswog  ( 2010 ) ) .",
    "the helmholtz equation of state is used ( @xcite ) , and the wd is assumed to be composed of 50 % of carbon and 50 % of oxygen .    the local peak temperatures shown in figure [ tmax ] are obtained from particles at @xmath14@xmath15 g @xmath7 at 2.5 min after the start of merging .",
    "@xmath23 has already reached its stationary value , which is confirmed with some test runs calculated until 10 min after the merging .",
    "it is seen that @xmath23 is determined mainly by @xmath2 with small dependence on @xmath1 .",
    "this implies that the gravitational potential of the more massive wd is the main factor to determine @xmath23 .",
    "figure [ tmax ] shows that @xmath9 for most cases of ( @xmath2 , @xmath1 ) .",
    "thus carbon flash will take place to form a carbon flame that propagates inward to convert c+o into o+ne+mg .",
    "how the above results depend on the set - up of the merging calculations ( @xcite ) ?",
    "the initial separation is set to be @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the radius of the less massive wd and @xmath29 is the effective roche lobe radius .",
    "some test runs adopting a larger separation confirm that @xmath23 is not sensitive to the initial separation .",
    "comparisons between the runs with @xmath30 and with @xmath31 show that @xmath23 of the higher resolution run is always slightly higher than the low resolution run .",
    "thus carbon ignition of case 1 is quite likely for most cases of ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "the wd formed from merging must be rapidly rotating .",
    "the `` sn ia mass '' of the wd with which sn ia is triggered is @xmath33@xmath5  for a uniformly rotating wd at the critical rotation ( @xcite ) .",
    "this is larger than 1.38@xmath5  for the non - rotating wd . for non - uniform , differentially rotating wds , @xmath34 is as large as @xmath35@xmath5  ( @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , even if no carbon flame is formed , the wd may not reach @xmath34 because of some mass loss after merging .",
    "in the sd scenario , h - burning produces a thin he layer , and he - flashes are ignited when the he mass reaches a certain critical value .",
    "the strength depends on the he envelope mass @xmath36 , thus depending on the accretion rate .",
    "the he envelope mass @xmath36 is larger for the slower mass - accumulation rate of the he layer @xmath37 . for @xmath38 @xmath5  yr@xmath22",
    ", @xmath36 exceeds a critical value where the density at its bottom becomes high enough to induce a he detonation .",
    "this would result in the sub - chandra explosion ( e.g. , s. sim in this conference ) .",
    "for higher @xmath39 , the he - shell flashes are not strong enough to induce a he detonation . then",
    ", such flashes repeat many times with the increasing wd mass @xmath40 toward the chandrasekhar mass .",
    "@xcite calculated nucleosynthesis in such he shell flashes for various set of ( @xmath40 , @xmath36 ) ( see also @xcite ) .    for @xmath41 @xmath5  yr@xmath22 , the wd",
    "is expected to undergo he shell - flashes at @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 as @xmath40 grows ( @xcite ) .    in the early stages of the he shell - flash ,",
    "the envelope is electron - degenerate and geometrically almost flat .",
    "thus the temperature at the bottom of the he - burning shell increases because of the almost constant pressure there .",
    "heated by nuclear burning , the helium envelope gradually expands , which decreases the pressure .",
    "then , the temperature attains its maximum and starts decreasing . the maximum temperature is higher for more massive wd and more massive envelope because of higher pressure .    for higher maximum temperatures , heavier elements , such as @xmath46si and @xmath47s ,",
    "are synthesized .",
    "however , the maximum temperature is not high enough to produce @xmath48ca . after the peak ,",
    "some amount of he remains unburned in the flash and burns into c+o during the stable he shell burning .    in this way , it is possible that interesting amount of intermediate mass elements , including si and s , already exist in the unburned c+o layer at @xmath49@xmath5 .",
    "such a distribution is shown in figure  [ he_flash ] for @xmath50 @xmath5  yr@xmath22 .",
    "a part of them might be ejected out .",
    "therefore the above quantity of the synthesized elements are overestimated .",
    "@xmath517378 line profiles in 12 sne  ia ( @xcite ) .",
    "the velocity is set assuming that the rest wavelength is at 7378   .",
    "( a ) observed line profiles . the rest wavelengths of [ fe  ii ]  @xmath517155 and [ ni  ii ]  @xmath517378 are shown by dotted lines .",
    "( b ) [ ni  ii ]  @xmath517378 in observations , after removing the underlying continuum ( or possible other lines ) .",
    "( c ) synthetic line profiles of the [ ni  ii ] , depending on the viewing orientation . ]",
    "both chandra and sub - chandra explosion models can synthesize relevant amount of @xmath8ni for sne ia .",
    "however , the amount of other fe - peak elements differs , because the ignition density is different , being as high as @xmath52 g @xmath7 in the chandra model , while as low as @xmath6 g @xmath7 in the sub - chandra model .    in the chandra model ,",
    "the thermonuclear runaway starts with the ignition of deflagration ( e.g. , @xcite , 1984 ) . in the high temperature and density bubble",
    ", materials are incinerated into nse ( nuclear statistical equilibrium ) and undergo electron capture .",
    "electron capture on free protons and fe - peak elements leads to the synthesis of @xmath0ni , @xmath53fe , and @xmath8fe ( not via @xmath8ni decay ) .",
    "these neutron - rich fe - peak elements form an almost @xmath8ni - empty hole ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    in the sub - chandra model ,",
    "the ignition density is too low for electron capture to take place .",
    "the neutron excess is produced only by the initial cno elements which are converted to @xmath54n and to @xmath55ne , thus depending on the initial metallicity . as a result ,",
    "the mass fraction of @xmath0ni is as small as @xmath56 0.01 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "such a difference in the amount of @xmath0ni can be observationally investigated by late - phase ( @xmath57yr since the explosion ) spectroscopy at near - infrared ( nir ) wavelength .",
    "because the ejecta become optically thin in late phases , spectroscopy provides an unbiased , direct view of the innermost regions .",
    "figure  [ ni58 ] shows the spectral feature around @xmath58   , i.e. , [ fe  ii ]  @xmath59 ( with some contribution from [ fe  ii ]  @xmath60 ) and [ ni  ii ]  @xmath517378 , for 12 sne  ia ( @xcite ) .",
    "the [ ni  ii ]  @xmath517378 line is emitted from the electron capture region of the ejecta , which is supported by the relatively narrow width ( @xmath61  km  s@xmath22 ) of the [ ni  ii ] line .",
    "thus the existence of [ ni  ii ] line implies the ignition at high density , thus favoring the chandra model .",
    "it is also interesting to note that these emission lines show the velocity shift , which indicates the off - center ignition and aspherical nature of sn ia explosions ( @xcite , 2010b ) .",
    "the aspherical features could be seen in the light echo from tycho s supernova remnant ( @xcite ) .",
    "days ( _ solid line _ ) , and a matching synow calculation ( _ dashed line _ ) . ( _ insets _ ) the spectrum near the location of c  ii lines ( _ solid line _ ) , the synow spectra containing only c  ii ( _ dashed line _ ) , and only h  i ( _ dotted line _ ) .",
    "the expected locations of c  ii lines are marked ( folatelli et al . 2012 ) ]    @xcite and @xcite investigated the presence of unburned material in early - time spectra of sne ia .",
    "they find that at least 30% of the objects in the sample show absorption at about 6300   which can be associated with c  ii @xmath516580 ( figure  [ carbon ] ) .",
    "this would imply a larger incidence of carbon in sn ia ejecta than previously noted .",
    "if confirmed as carbon , the material producing the observed features would be present at very low expansion velocities , merely @xmath561,000 km s@xmath22 above the si  ii velocities .",
    "carbon must be present in very deep regions , corresponding to velocities as low as @xmath62 @xmath63 11,000 km s@xmath22 .",
    "this is well below the expected limit imposed by one - dimensional models , and points directly to large mixing effects and/or possible departures from spherical symmetry or clumpiness .    in",
    "spherically symmetric models , irrespective of the details of the flame propagation ( deflagration or detonation ) , the production of a large amount of @xmath8ni ( @xmath64 ) requires that the strength of the flame , which must lead to the total consumption of carbon below 15,000 - 20,000 km s@xmath22 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the situation is different for non - spherical models .",
    "for example , the off - center ignition model ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) synthesizes @xmath65 of @xmath8ni and carbon with a mass fraction of @xmath66 at velocities as low as @xmath5613,000 km s@xmath22 .",
    "this is still larger than the observed velocity , but suggests that the non - spherical effects may be important to understand the detection of carbon deep in the ejecta .",
    "the existence of carbon at relatively low velocity suggests the presence of fair amount of unburned c+o materials . the amount fe peak elements in such an unburned layer depends on the metallicity .",
    "further observations of early uv spectra could show significant metallicity effects .",
    "as summarized above , recent modeling shows that dd merging could result in both the chandra and the sub - chandra explosions depending on whether a carbon detonation is induced near the surface of more massive wd .",
    "the sd scenario could also result in both the chandra and sub - chandra explosions depending on whether the he shell - flashes near the surface of the wd induce a he detonation .    * for dd - subch",
    ", it is critically important to confirm the formation of surface carbon detonation by means of 3d hydrodynamical simulations rather than sph method . * for dd - ch , whether carbon ignition can occur for both case 1 and case 2 needs further study for various set of ( @xmath32 ) . * for sd - subch , a mechanism to avoid the production of too much @xmath8ni in the surface",
    "should be studied . in case of the he - wd and c - wd merger , formation of an extended he envelope",
    "needs to be avoided . * for sd - ch , the outcome of quiescent he - shell flashes , e.g. , nucleosynthesis",
    ", the rate of the he wind mass loss , needs to be studied . *",
    "finally , detailed hydrodynamical modeling of the wd spin - down is necessary . in this spin - down scenario ( e.g. , @xcite ) , an almost uniformly rotating c+o wd with a mass range of 1.38 - 1.48 @xmath5  forms and eventually contract to ignite carbon after a long spin - down time .",
    "the outcome depends on the ignition density .",
