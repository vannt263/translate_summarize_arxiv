    "the standard model for cosmology contains dark energy in the form of a cosmological constant and cold dark matter ( @xmath0cdm ) . while this model explains most observations to date , the dark matter and the dark energy",
    "are only observed gravitationally .",
    "it thus remains possible that they are a single phenomenon , sometimes called in the literature unified dark matter ( udm ) .",
    "a candidate for udm that has been extensively discussed in the literature is the generalized chaplygin gas . here",
    "the udm is taken to be a perfect fluid with an equation of state @xmath2 , with @xmath3 and @xmath4 ; models with @xmath5 @xcite are particularly attractive since they represent a born - infeld scalar field @xcite that admits a string theory interpretation ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "this class of equations of state leads to a _ background _ evolution that transitions from a matter dominated phase at early times to a de sitter phase in the asymptotic future in agreement with distance measures @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , in linear perturbation theory chaplygin udm produces oscillations or exponential growth in the matter power spectrum unless @xmath6 @xcite , even after the effect of baryons @xcite has been included .",
    "the exact phenomenology of these models once nonlinear structures have formed is complicated due to the fact that the pressure decreases with increasing energy density ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it is clear , however , that these models differ substantially from the successful @xmath0cdm model and are unlikely to be viable in their simplest form .    these problems with chaplygin gas udm stem from very general considerations and",
    "serve as a guide to building more successful udm models .",
    "fundamentally , a udm model that mimics the joint stress energy tensor of @xmath0cdm will reproduce all of its observational successes @xcite .",
    "since the udm stress - energy tensor is covariantly conserved , mimicry in the spatial stresses is all that need be explicitly enforced @xcite .",
    "deviations from perfect mimicry must be small in a very specific sense .",
    "the basic requirement for mimicry is that spatial fluctuations in the udm stresses be negligible in comparison to those in its energy density @xmath7 , even though the homogeneous or background stress must be of order @xmath8 to accelerate the expansion @xcite .",
    "more specifically , the ratio between the fluctuating stress and the energy density must be of order the _ square _ of that between the momentum and energy densities , or a non - relativistic velocity squared .",
    "this disparity implies that the total pressure is effectively decoupled from the total density , i.e.  that the pressure is effectively non - adiabatic @xcite . for a generalized chaplygin gas",
    "this requirement is only satisfied as @xmath9 .    in the linear regime , where the momentum density itself is a perturbation , fluctuations in the spatial stresses must then be a second order effect quantified by a vanishingly small sound speed and anisotropic stress .",
    "the internal dynamics of dark matter halos place even more stringent requirements on mimicry . here",
    "the udm stress energy tensor must embed the information from multiple momentum streams in the dark matter , i.e. the full phase space structure of cold dark matter",
    ". a successful udm model will be at least as complex as @xmath0cdm in order to reproduce its rich phenomenology detracting somewhat from its appeal .",
    "the prototype for a successful udm model is a scalar field coherently oscillating in an offset quadratic potential @xcite ; it satisfies mimicry requirements all the way down to the de - broglie wavelength of the field @xcite .",
    "it does not , however , explain the relationship between the @xmath10 ev flatness of the offset scale and the @xmath11 ev mass scale .",
    "recently , scherrer @xcite introduced a @xmath12-essence @xcite variant of scalar field udm that also succeeds in linear theory . here",
    "the quadratic potential is replaced by a quadratic kinetic term ( see @xcite for a possible physical motivation ) .",
    "an important feature of this model is that its stress - energy tensor is purely kinetic ( see @xcite for a generalization ) .",
    "we shall show that its equation of state is consequently both barotropic and expressible in closed form .",
    "we are consequently able to reduce this kinetic form of udm to collisional dark matter with a negligible mean free path .",
    "non - linear structure formation for this case has been well - studied in the literature @xcite .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "we begin in  [ sec : scalar ] with a brief review of the basic properties of scalar field udm .",
    "we derive an exact , fully non - linear , equation of state for the purely kinetic udm model @xcite in  [ sec : eos ] .",
    "we then calculate the evolution of linear density fluctuations in  [ sec : linear ] .",
    "we place constraints on the model from the suppression of the low mass dark matter halo abundance in  [ sec : nonlinear1 ] and discuss opportunities and challenges for the model from halo substructure in  [ sec : nonlinear2 ] .",
    "we conclude in  [ sec : discussion ] .    throughout",
    "we will compare the udm model to a @xmath0cdm model with a total non - relativistic matter density @xmath13 , baryon density @xmath14 , in a flat cosmology with @xmath15 and scale invariant adiabatic initial conditions .",
    "in this section , we briefly review the relationship between scalar fields and perfect fluids and show why scalar fields whose potential and kinetic terms possess a non - vanishing minimum value satisfy the basic requirements of a successful udm model .",
    "the minimum acts as a decoupled source of negative pressure with an equation of state @xmath16 for the background that does not contribute to stress fluctuations .",
    "the stress energy tensor of a classical scalar field @xmath17 with a lagrangian @xmath18 and kinetic term @xmath19 is given by @xmath20 it takes the form of a perfect fluid @xmath21 with the association of a 4-velocity @xcite @xmath22 which is timelike for the nearly homogeneous cosmological initial conditions .",
    "we shall show in  [ sec : nonlinear2 ] that it remains so throughout structure formation . here",
    ", the proper energy density and pressure , or energy density and isotropic stress as measured by an observer comoving with the  fluid \" , is @xmath23 although the mapping from a scalar field to a perfect fluid is exact , the fluid equations are not closed without a specification of @xmath18 to provide the equation of state .",
    "scalar fields provide fertile ground for unified dark matter models . when combined , the kinetic and potential terms possess sufficient degrees of freedom to alter the equation of state of the fluctuations separately from the background . both the potential and the kinetic versions of udm posit a separable lagrangian of the form @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 behave respectively as dark energy and dark matter .",
    "mimicry of a cosmological constant is possible if @xmath25 is constant or , more generally , slowly varying with the field degrees of freedom in comparison to the matter piece @xmath26 . in what follows",
    ", we shall assume that the former case holds and set @xmath27 the stress energy tensors @xmath25 and @xmath26 are then separately conserved .",
    "other splittings are of course possible ( e.g.  @xmath28 @xcite ) but all choices yield the same observable predictions .",
    "our choice simplifies the calculation in that the dark matter and dark energy pieces interact only through gravity .",
    "the prototype for this sort of unification is an axion - like matter component @xmath29 in a potential whose minimum gives the dark energy density @xmath30 .",
    "we will refer to this option as potential udm ( pudm ) .",
    "scherrer @xcite introduced a similar but alternate ansatz based on a modified kinetic term @xmath31 we call this kinetic udm ( kudm ) .",
    "the constant @xmath32 can be eliminated in favor of the average matter density and kinetic term @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 denotes evaluation at the present epoch .",
    "the fine tuning between the mass and offset scale in pudm discussed in ",
    "[ sec : introduction ] still exists in kudm as the coincidence problem @xmath36 .",
    "we shall see that kudm also requires @xmath37 ( see  [ sec : nonlinear1 ] ) , which is similar to the pudm requirement of a purely quadratic potential near the minimum or the neglect of self interaction terms in the potential .",
    "nonetheless , both the pudm and kudm model satisfy the basic requirement for a successful udm model in that their lagrangian reaches a non - vanishing minimum value @xmath25 that can serve as a dark energy component that can not be spatially perturbed .",
    "given the mapping between scalar fields and perfect fluids described in the previous section , the dynamics of the kudm model are determined by its equation of state , the relationship between its pressure and energy density in its rest frame .",
    "an important property of this purely kinetic model is that there is only one degree of freedom , the kinetic term @xmath38 , and therefore the equation of state is barotropic to all orders in the density fluctuation , i.e. @xmath39 is a function of @xmath40 only .",
    "we begin with the background equation of state @xmath41 to obtain @xmath42 note that energy conservation provides an explicit relation for @xmath43^{-1/6}\\,.\\ ] ]    a convenient fitting formula for the required inverse relation @xmath44^{-\\gamma } \\right\\}^{-1/\\gamma}\\,,\\ ] ] achieves @xmath45 accuracy with @xmath46 .",
    "thus , the  matter \" component behaves as radiation in the background for @xmath47 and non - relativistic dark matter thereafter .",
    "since the matter component depends only on @xmath38 , the pressure is adiabatic and the fully non - linear equation of state @xmath48\\ , , \\nonumber\\\\ f & = { 3 \\rho_m\\over 4\\bar\\rho_m } \\epsilon ( 4 + 3\\epsilon)\\ , , \\label{eqn : eos}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is barotropic .",
    "the adiabatic sound speed @xmath49 then quantifies the pressure response to a density fluctuation in both the linear and non - linear regimes .",
    "note that the pressure is a monotonically increasing function of the energy density .",
    "hence , unlike the chaplygin gas model @xcite , the matter can not be destabilized by the appearance of high density fluctuations .",
    "we will exploit this fact in  [ sec : nonlinear2 ] in calculating the abundance of collapsed objects .",
    "note that the simplification of a purely kinetic udm field is an important feature in the model that is critical in the sections that follow . in the more general case ( including pudm ) , where @xmath18 is a function of both @xmath17 and @xmath38 , the pressure fluctuations @xmath50 can not be expressed as a function of @xmath51 , except in the background . in particular",
    ", they may be highly time variable .",
    "regardless , the scalar field convention is to define the effective sound speed as that of the kinetic degree of freedom @xcite , i.e. @xmath52 since it quantifies the stresses in the frame comoving with the field .",
    "however , this mapping of field variables onto fluid variables is merely formal in the general case .",
    "for example , the matter component of pudm acts as collisionless non - relativistic dark matter even though @xmath53 ( see  [ sec : discussion ] ) . in the kudm model ,",
    "no such subtlety exists and the matter component behaves purely hydrodynamically .",
    "for the linear fluctuations it is sufficient to note that though there is a single kudm lagrangian , the matter field component is decoupled from the dark energy component and behaves as a fluid .",
    "it possesses an adiabatic sound speed given by eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : sound ] ) with @xmath54 and negligible anisotropic stress , as the latter scales quadratically with spatial field derivatives [ see eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : tmunu ] ) ] .    given that the only gravitational degrees of freedom involve the parametrization of the stresses , mimicry of @xmath0cdm for all linear theory observables above the sound horizon , including the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and large - scale structure ,",
    "is guaranteed by construction @xcite .",
    "perfect mimicry follows from @xmath25 being strictly constant , since the spatial fluctuations @xmath55 and @xmath56 vanish independently of the scalar field sound speed .",
    "more generally , allowing @xmath25 to depend weakly on @xmath17 or @xmath38 can modify the predictions on the largest scales by introducing a relativistic dark energy sound speed @xcite .",
    "below the sound horizon , perturbations in the matter component undergo jeans or acoustic oscillations instead of growth , effectively cutting off the linear power spectrum .",
    "this behavior places an upper limit on @xmath57 such that the matter component acts as non - relativistic matter during the usual matter dominated epoch @xmath58 .",
    "scherrer placed a conservative upper limit by demanding that @xmath59 or , equivalently , @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "this constraint would ensure that the kudm behaves as @xmath0cdm above the horizon at matter radiation equality and thus only deep in the linear regime today . to ensure mimicry for non - linear structure",
    "requires a much more stringent constraint on @xmath61 .",
    "these considerations can be usefully quantified by noting that the equation of state @xmath62 and sound speed drop rapidly and monotonically from their relativistic values @xmath63 once @xmath64 . after a scale exits the sound horizon ,",
    "matter fluctuations grow as cdm independently of scale .",
    "thus , on all larger scales , linear fluctuations can be described by a modification to the usual transfer function ( e.g. @xcite ) @xmath65 to characterize @xmath66 , we solve the coupled einstein - boltzmann equations that include photons , baryons and neutrinos in the usual way , following @xcite .",
    "the resulting transfer function , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : trans ] , is well fit by @xmath67^{1/(\\beta+1 ) } \\ , , \\label{eqn : fit}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath68^{0.12 } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath69 is the conformal time evaluated at @xmath70 .",
    "note that the power drops by at least an order of magnitude at @xmath71 , the first extremum of the oscillation .",
    "for @xmath72 , this drop reflects the lack of the usual logarithmic growth of the matter fluctuations in the radiation dominated era . for larger @xmath61 ,",
    "the fluctuations are further suppressed as a function of @xmath12 due to the change in the growth rate in the matter dominated epoch .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : cl ] we show that the cmb power spectrum predictions remain unchanged from @xmath0cdm to the cosmic variance limit for @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "the main effect of higher @xmath61 is an enhancement of the radiation driving and a reduction of the baryonic modulation of the peaks .",
    "given that the background pressure of the matter component of kudm drops as the universe expands , the largest qualitative difference between this model and @xmath0cdm in the non - linear regime comes simply from the suppression of small scale linear power that is frozen in early on .",
    "= 3.4 in    this suppression in the initial fluctuations reduces the number of low mass dark matter halos in a manner that has been well quantified by simulations . for gaussian intial conditions ,",
    "the number density of halos of mass @xmath75 is controlled by the variance of linear density field @xcite @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the fourier transform of the top hat window that encloses the mass @xmath75 at the mean density .",
    "specifically , their comoving number density is described by the mass function @xcite @xmath78 where @xmath79 and @xmath80 \\exp[-a\\nu^2/2]\\ , .",
    "\\label{eqn : stform}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] a choice of @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 such that @xmath85 fits the results of simulations well .    at high redshift , where @xmath86 is small and @xmath87 large , collapsed objects of a given mass are rare . in this regime ,",
    "the number density is exponentially sensitive to @xmath88 and hence the amplitude of initial fluctuations .",
    "thus , the requirement that there are sufficient low mass halos at high redshift to reionize the universe places a constraint on kudm models .",
    "let us define the suppression in kudm for a given @xmath57 relative to @xmath0cdm in the mass function as @xmath89 in fig .",
    "[ fig : massfn ] we show this suppression as a function of mass for two redshifts representative of reionization and several choices of @xmath57 .",
    "note that the suppression increases with decreasing mass due to the small - scale cut off in the transfer function @xmath90 and with increasing redshift due to the exponential sensitivity .",
    "= 3.4 in    for the specific question of reionization , the relevant quantity for comparison is the fraction of the universe that has collapsed into objects of sufficient mass that they can cool and form stars . for atomic line cooling , the virial temperature of the halo @xmath91 must be greater than @xmath92k ; for molecular hydrogen cooling , @xmath93 but the reionization efficiency is lower @xcite .",
    "the collapse fraction is given by the integral over the mass function @xmath94 we will again define the collapse fraction relative to @xmath0cdm as @xmath95 we show this suppression factor in fig .  [",
    "fig : collapse ] .",
    "since even @xmath0cdm has difficulty reionizing the universe sufficiently early , this ratio can not be smaller than @xmath96 around @xmath97 . comparing requirements in the very similar context of broken scale invariance and warm dark matter @xcite we place a conservative bound of @xmath98 for atomic cooling .",
    "if reionization occurs through molecular hydrogen cooling , then the limit is even more stringent .",
    "furthermore if indications from the cmb polarization measured by wmap of a high reionization redshift @xmath99 @xcite are confirmed then even this regime will be ruled out , given reasonable assumptions on star formation and the escape fraction of ionizing photons @xcite .",
    "the only loophole is if scale invariance in the initial power spectrum is strongly broken at coincidentally similar scales to compensate .",
    "the kudm model differs from @xmath0cdm in the structure of dark matter halos both because of the reduction in initial small scale power and the fact that it behaves as a nearly pressureless fluid instead of a set of collisionless particles .",
    "these issues will require full cosmological simulations to resolve quantitatively , which is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "however , we shall see that both aspects of the modifications can be reduced to cases that have been previously solved in the literature .",
    "the latter is in qualitative disagreement with some recent observations .",
    "a suppression of small scale power may in fact be desirable to reduce the claimed excess present - day substructure in galactic sized halos of the @xmath0cdm model .",
    "of course , there is tension between these beneficial effects and the inability to form enough high redshift halos to reionize the universe . saturating the conservative bound by setting",
    "@xmath100 one recovers a suppression of small scale power at a similar scale and form to the well - studied broken scale invariance model @xcite .",
    "this model was explicitly constructed to alleviate the substructure problem and so there may remain a small window in kudm parameter space that satisfies these conflicting requirements .",
    "cosmological simulations will be required to address this question quantitatively .",
    "note , however , that the substructure problem may have an astrophysical origin .    for the evolution of small scale structure , it is useful to bear in mind that eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : eos ] ) implies that the pressure remains small compared with the energy density until @xmath101 .",
    "given the low upper bound for @xmath57 , this corresponds to extremely large overdensities today @xmath102 . for the relevant @xmath103 case ,",
    "the non - linear equation of state simplifies to @xmath104 and the sound speed to @xmath105 note that in this limit the fluctuation to the kinetic term is still small , since @xmath106 hence , the fluid 4-velocity [ see eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : fourvelocity ] ) ] remains timelike ( see  @xcite for a discussion of spacelike kinetic scalar fields ) and the 3-velocity non - relativistic .",
    "thus , the nonlinear evolution for kudm may be calculated with non - relativistic hydrodynamic techniques , such as smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "qualitatively , density fluctuations will stabilize below the jeans scale , which is the distance sound can travel in a dynamical time .",
    "the comoving jeans wavenumber becomes @xmath107 or a physical jeans scale that is fixed in the matter dominated epoch for both linear and non - linear density fluctuations . for a model that has sufficient linear theory power to explain high redshift structure and reionization , this scale is well below cosmologically interesting scales .",
    "given these constraints , the matter component of kudm acts as a pressureless fluid on cosmologically relevant scales .",
    "this type of dark matter has been studied extensively in the literature in the context of collisional or self - interacting dark matter with a vanishingly small mean free path @xcite .",
    "qualitatively , cold dark matter behaves differently from fluid dark matter as soon as there exist multiple streams in the dark matter . since cold dark matter is collisionless , it occupies a phase space distribution @xmath108 , defined in a locally orthonormal basis .",
    "its gravitational influence comes through the stress energy tensor @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the 4-momentum of the cdm particles and @xmath111 is the degeneracy factor . for cdm in the non - linear regime , there can be multiple streams or momentum states occupied for a given position state .",
    "on the other hand , kudm trajectories can not cross and instead kudm will behave as a fluid and shock .    specifically , kudm or fluid dark matter is challenged by observations of a galaxy cluster system observed to be undergoing a high velocity merger @xcite . here , the collisional baryonic gas lags behind the collisionless stars and lensing - observed dark matter due to ram pressure stripping .",
    "likewise , kudm is in potential conflict with the shape of gravitational wakes of galactic halos moving in a cluster halo @xcite and the fundamental plane of ellipticals in clusters versus the field @xcite .",
    "finally , kudm would not predict as large a triaxiality of halos as measured by strong lensing @xcite , although some ambiguities remain due to projection effects @xcite .",
    "note that the kudm is fluid - like even down to scales where the pressure becomes relevant so that there is no equivalent to an adjustable mean free path or cross section to alleviate these difficulties @xcite .",
    "building a successful unified dark matter model is a useful exercise , even if its end role is only as a foil to @xmath0cdm that highlights the successes of the standard model . observations already sharply delineate the basic properties of a successful unified model .    compared with chaplygin gas models of unified dark matter , kinetic unified dark ( kudm ) @xcite is more successful as it can explain the well - established observations both of the background expansion rate and phenomena in the linear regime , such as the cosmic microwave background and large - scale structure of the universe .",
    "it is not without its problems however in the non - linear regime .",
    "if recent observations in clusters of galaxies are confirmed then even this type of model will be ruled out .",
    "we have shown that the kudm behaves as a fluid with a closed - form barotropic equation of state plus a constant term that acts as a cosmological constant to all orders in structure formation . in linear theory ,",
    "the high density of the matter component in the early universe introduces a relativistic pressure and hence a cut off to the linear power spectrum from jeans oscillations .",
    "we have provided a convenient fitting function to the numerical results that should assist in future investigations of the model .    in order to produce halos that reionize the universe",
    ", kudm must behave like cdm in linear theory on scales above @xmath112 few mpc@xmath113 .",
    "this requirement reduces the viable kudm parameter space to the limiting case of highly collisional , or self - interacting , non - relativistic dark matter with a negligible mean free path @xcite .",
    "kudm is then also phenomenologically equivalent to a chaplygin gas udm , where the pressure is independent of the density @xcite ( @xmath6 , see  [ sec : introduction ] ) .",
    "such models are in moderate observational conflict with the observed shape of cluster halos and effects like ram pressure stripping in cluster substructure .",
    "hydrodynamic simulations of the dark matter with the initial conditions provided by the linear theory given here may be used to quantitatively address these issues in the specific kudm context .",
    "note that these qualitative features are likely to remain valid even if the quadratic assumption for the kinetic lagrangian fails far away from the minimum , so long as the implied pressure is still of order the energy density once @xmath114 .",
    "if these recent observations of clusters of galaxies are confirmed only the potential variant of scalar field udm remains viable . here",
    "although the field can still be mapped onto a perfect fluid , it possesses a phase space structure and mimics cdm down to the de - broglie wavelength of the field , i.e.  the kiloparsec regime for @xmath115 ev @xcite . in this case , the rapidly oscillating equation of state makes a direct solution of the fluid equations intractable @xcite .",
    "it can be shown through a wkb approximation that the momentum information is carried by a spatially varying phase to the field , similar to a quantum phase space for the wavefunction @xcite .",
    "the collisionless nature of cdm is then reflected by the linearity of the wave equation or the quadratic nature of the potential .",
    "self - interactions for the pudm model are included by adding anharmonic terms to the potential @xcite .    from these examples ,",
    "it is clear that a successful udm model will likely be as complex phenomenologically as the well - tested @xmath0cdm model .",
    "complexity reduces the appeal of the udm hypothesis , unless a fundamental theory can explain the disparate scales introduced by the components that masquerade as the dark matter and dark energy . neither the kudm or pudm models in the form presented here do so .    _",
