    "local hidden variable theories have been extensively compared to quantum mechanics over the last seventy or so years @xcite .",
    "most comparisons between the two have investigated whether or not quantum mechanics is equivalent to a local hidden variable theory .",
    "much evidence indicates that it is not .",
    "many results in quantum mechanics have been found that are incompatible with all local hidden variable theories @xcite .",
    "most of these results have involved idealized undamped systems .",
    "however , all experimental systems encounter damping .",
    "thus , it is interesting ( and more realistic ) to compare quantum mechanics and local hidden variable theories in damped systems @xcite .",
    "this paper compares quantum mechanics and one local hidden variable theory ( sed ) in such a system .",
    "one of the earliest works comparing local hidden variable theories to quantum mechanics was bell s theorem @xcite .",
    "it demonstrates that quantum mechanics is incompatible with all local hidden variable theories at a statistical level .",
    "it does so by deriving an upper bound on a function of two particle correlations for all local hidden variable theories , which quantum mechanics exceeds .",
    "extensions of it have been formulated for large angular momentum and particle number systems @xcite .",
    "these extensions demonstrate nonclassical behavior in a regime usually regarded as being purely classical .",
    "greenberger , horne and zeilinger ( ghz ) @xcite have also extended bell s work , differentiating quantum mechanics from all local hidden variable theories for single , as opposed to ensemble , measurements .",
    "the three particle ghz theorem has an  all or nothing \" quality and distinguishes between local hidden variable theories and quantum mechanics in a single experimental run , once three basic correlations are established .",
    "comparisons between quantum mechanics and local hidden variable theories have also been made using continuous variables ( which are discretized in formulating the comparison ) , such as quadrature phase amplitudes @xcite and there is currently much interest in this area .",
    "for quadrature phase amplitude measurements , these comparisons can have detector efficiencies of in excess of 99% @xcite .",
    "they also tend to relate more strongly to einstein , podolsky and rosen s original epr paradox @xcite than earlier discrete variable ones .",
    "indeed , the epr paradox has been experimentally demonstrated using quadrature phase amplitudes @xcite .",
    "additionally , quantum teleportation has been achieved using quadrature phase amplitudes @xcite further demonstrating the utility of continuous variables .",
    "one commonly used local hidden variable theory is stochastic electrodynamics ( sed ) @xcite .",
    "some authors have proposed it as an alternative to quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a semiclassical approach equivalent to it @xcite is also commonly used in parametric oscillator calculations @xcite .",
    "sed consists of adding gaussian white noise to classical electrodynamics .",
    "it is equivalent to truncating third order derivative terms in the quantum mechanical moyal equation , a commonly used approximation @xcite .",
    "such terms are often negligible and thus sed reproduces many results of quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "however , it can not violate bell inequalities for quadrature phase amplitude measurements , and is thus distinct from quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "various authors have explicitly shown differences between sed and quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "in particular , it has been shown that the two theories predict different transient third order correlations for the undamped nondegenerate parametric oscillator @xcite .",
    "it has also been shown that they predict different macroscopic quadrature phase amplitude correlations in the damped nondegenerate parametric oscillator in the steady state @xcite .    in general ,",
    "differences between quantum mechanics and local hidden variable theories are reduced or eliminated by damping @xcite .",
    "furthermore , damping is a significant element of many realistic systems .",
    "it is thus important to consider its effects on differences between quantum mechanics and local hidden variable theories such as sed .",
    "however , all but a few of the comparisons between the quantum mechanics and local hidden variable theories referenced above have involved undamped systems",
    ". they are thus idealized in this respect .",
    "in contrast , damping is included in the calculatons in this paper .",
    "it is included to consider a theoretical model which is as realistic as possible and also to determine the sensitivity of differences between quantum mechanics and sed to its presence .",
    "this paper extends a previous comparison between quantum mechanics and sed in the nondegenerate parametric oscillator @xcite .",
    "in particular , it contrasts both intracavity and external moments of the two theories in the same system with damping included .",
    "expressions from both theories are compared for the intracavity moment @xmath0 , where @xmath1 , for @xmath2 , @xmath3 is quadrature phase amplitude , the subscripts represent different radiation modes and @xmath4 is a scaled time variable .",
    "a comparison is also made for an analogous external moment .",
    "both analytic iterative and numerical techniques are used to calculate moments .",
    "the results produced by these techniques show that the intracavity and external moments differ greatly between the two theories . in particular",
    ", the analytic method shows that the moments of quantum mechanics are cubic in the system s nonlinear coupling constant to leading order whilst those of sed are linear .",
    "the two theories are compared over a range of nonlinear coupling constant , damping and average initial pump photon number values .",
    "the results of these comparisons show a number of qualitative trends .",
    "most importantly , quantum mechanics and sed differ in the situations considered with the largest particle number and damping to nonlinear coupling ratios , although the differences are reduced in relative size .",
    "stochastic techniques are used to obtain results both for quantum mechanics and sed .",
    "the positive - p coherent state representation @xcite is used to calculate quantum mechanical predictions .",
    "it is particularly well suited to the calculation of quantum dynamics in damped quantum optical systems when nonclassical behavior is present .",
    "it is able to handle arbitrarily large photon numbers .",
    "it converges quickly ( in the sense of sampling error ) when systems dimensionless nonlinearities are relatively small , as is the case with nonlinear optical experiments .",
    "by contrast , the method used for sed calculations corresponds to commonly used approaches in quantum optics , where the field is treated as a semiclassical object surrounded by ( classical ) vacuum fluctuations .",
    "both methods are used to generate analytic predictions and are also numerically simulated .",
    "this paper considers an idealized nondegenerate parametric oscillator , resonant at three frequencies @xmath5 ( signal and idler frequencies ) and @xmath6 ( pump frequency ) .",
    "it contains a nonlinear medium that couples the modes and converts higher energy pump photons into lower energy signal and idler ones .",
    "the system s interaction hamiltonian , including linear losses , is given by    @xmath7    where @xmath8 are creation and annihilation operators for oscillator modes , @xmath9 are environment mode operators and g is a nonlinear interaction strength constant . initially , the system has a coherent state in the pump mode , and vacuum states in the signal and idler modes .",
    "a number of quasiprobability representations exist to describe quantum states , the most famous being the glauber - sudarshan representation@xcite .",

    ". the glauber - sudarshan representation can be negative and is hence not a strict probability density function .",
    "a more recent representation is the positive - p representation @xcite which is an actual probability density function over an off - diagonal coherent state basis .",
    "it further differs from the glauber - sudarshan representation by using a phase space of doubled dimension .",
