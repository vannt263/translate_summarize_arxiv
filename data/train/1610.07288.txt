    "the models described by the schrdinger operators with singular zero - range potentials have widely been discussed in both the physical and mathematical literature ( see books  @xcite for details and references ) .",
    "these models admit exact closed analytical solutions which describe realistic situations using different approximations via hamiltonians describing point interactions @xcite . currently , because of the rapid progress in fabricating nanoscale quantum devices , of particular importance is the point modelling of different structures like quantum waveguides @xcite , spectral filters @xcite or infinitesimally thin sheets @xcite .",
    "a whole body of literature ( see , e.g. , @xcite , a few to mention ) , including the very recent studies @xcite with references therein , has been published where the one - dimensional schrdinger operators with potentials given in the form of distributions are shown to exhibit a number of peculiar features with possible applications to quantum physics .",
    "a detailed list of references on this subject can also be found in the recent review @xcite . on the other hand , using some particular regular approximations of the potential expressed in the form of the derivative of dirac s delta function , a number of interesting resonance properties of quantum particles tunnelling through this point potential has been observed @xcite .",
    "particularly , it was found that at some values of the potential strength of the @xmath11-potential the transmission across this barrier is non - zero , whereas outside these values the barrier is fully opaque . in general terms , the existence of such resonance sets in the space of potential intensities has rigorously been established for a whole class of approximations of the derivative delta potential by golovaty with coworkers @xcite .",
    "this type of point interactions may be referred to as ` resonant - tunnelling @xmath11-potentials ' .",
    "these results differ from those obtained within kurasov s theory @xcite which was developed for the distributions defined on the space of functions discontinuous at the point of singularity . here",
    "the limit point interaction is also called a @xmath11-potential .",
    "the common feature of kurasov s point potential and a resonant - tunnelling @xmath11-potential is that the transmission matrices of both these interactions are of the diagonal form , but the elements of these matrices are different .",
    "it is of interest therefore to to find a way where it would be possible to describe both these types in a aunique regularization scheme starting from the same initial regularized potential profile .    in the present work",
    "we address the problem on the relation between the point interactions realized within kurasov s theory and the resonant - tunnelling @xmath11-potentials studied in @xcite .",
    "similarly to these papers , we explore the one - dimensional stationary schrdinger equation @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the wavefunction and @xmath14 the energy of a particle .",
    "the potential @xmath15 with a squeezing parameter @xmath16 shrinks to one point , say @xmath17 , as @xmath18 .",
    "one of the ways to realize limit point interactions is to choose the potential @xmath15 in the form of a sum of several dirac s delta functions as follows @xcite @xmath19 where all @xmath20 and @xmath21 as @xmath18 .",
    "the particular case of the three - delta spatially symmetric potential ( [ 2 ] ) , in the limit as the distances between the @xmath22-functions tend to zero , has been studied by cheon and shigehara @xcite , and albeverio and nizhnik @xcite . in this limit",
    "a whole four - parameter family of point interactions has been constructed , independently on whether or not potential ( [ 2 ] ) has a distributional limit . here",
    "we follow the approach developed by exner , neidhardt and zagrebnov @xcite , who have approximated the @xmath22-potentials by regular functions and constructed a one - point limit interaction . in particular , they have proved that the limit takes place if the distances between the ` centers ' of regularized potentials tend to zero sufficiently slow relatively to shrinking the @xmath22-like potentials .",
    "a similar research @xcite concerns about the convergence of regularized @xmath22-like structures to point potentials in higher dimensions .",
    "in this paper we focus on the two cases when potential ( [ 2 ] ) consists of two ( @xmath23 ) and three ( @xmath24 ) @xmath22-potentials separated equidistantly by a function @xmath25 that tends to zero as @xmath18 .",
    "all the coefficients at the @xmath22-functions are specified as @xmath26 where @xmath27 s ( ` intensities ' , ` charges ' or ` amplitudes ' ) are non - zero constants .",
    "the sign ` - ' has been chosen for convenience in the following notations , so that negative values of @xmath27 correspond to a @xmath22-barrier and positive ones to a @xmath22-well .",
    "thus , in the case with @xmath24 we have @xmath28 , ~~(a_1,a_2,a_3 ) \\in { { \\mathbb{r}}}^3 \\setminus \\{0\\}.   \\label{3}\\ ] ] for the case of two @xmath22-potentials , we just set in ( [ 3 ] ) @xmath29 , so that @xmath30 .",
    "the transmission matrices for the two- and three - delta potentials are the products @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively , where @xmath33 we restrict ourselves to the most simple approximation of the @xmath22-potentials by piecewise constant functions resulting in a three ( for @xmath23 ) and a five ( for @xmath24 ) layered potential profile . in the limit as both the width of @xmath22-like functions and the distance between them tends to zero simultaneously we obtain a family of one - point interactions .",
    "we observe that , starting from the same profile of the three- and five - layered structure that approximates potential ( [ 2 ] ) , the limit point interactions crucially depend on the relative rate of tending the width of layers and the distance between them to zero . within this approach",
    "one can realize both the point interactions obtained within kurasov s theory and the resonant - tunnelling potentials .",
    "let us approximate the @xmath22-potentials in ( [ 3 ] ) by piecewise constant functions .",
    "then potential ( [ 3 ] ) is replaced by the rectangular function @xmath34 and , as a result , all the matrices @xmath35 , @xmath36 , in the product for @xmath37 are replaced by @xmath38 where @xmath39 in other words , the regularized transmission matrix @xmath40 defined by the relations @xmath41 connects the boundary conditions for the wavefunction @xmath13 and its derivative @xmath42 at @xmath43 and @xmath44 ( @xmath24 ) . for the case of the two - delta potential ( @xmath23 ) we set in potential ( [ 5 ] ) @xmath45 , so that the boundary conditions are @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",

    "starting from the _ same _ three - layer ( for @xmath23 ) and five - layer ( for @xmath24 ) potential profile described by ( [ 5 ] ) , a whole family of limit one - point interactions with resonant - tunnelling behaviour has been realized .",
    "the resonance sets for these interactions are curves on the @xmath7-plane ( @xmath23 ) and surfaces in the @xmath8-space ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "the number of resonances ( one or infinite ) depends on a path , along which the corresponding sequence of transmission matrices has a limit .    for both the cases with @xmath23 and 3 we single out the four resonance sets named @xmath193 , @xmath232 , @xmath264 , @xmath289 and defined by equations ( [ 23 ] ) , ( [ 29 ] ) , ( [ 37 ] ) and ( [ 39 ] ) , ( [ 42 ] ) , respectively .",

    "the corresponding conditions for the existence of this type of interactions given on the @xmath7-plane and in the @xmath8-space depend on the paths and they are summarized in table  [ tab : table2 ] .    it should be noticed that in this paper we have restricted ourselves to power parameterization ( [ 9 ] ) . the admissible set of the powers @xmath164 and @xmath112 for realizing point interactions appears to be the set @xmath305 . using this parameterization as well as the piecewise constant approximation of the @xmath22-functions in potential ( [ 3 ] ) , it is possible to get the explicit solutions for the corresponding @xmath59-matrices and to treat thus the reflection - transmission properties of the one - point interactions directly .",
    "it is of interest to note that inside the set @xmath306 the resonance sets are single - valued and when approaching the boundary @xmath307 , the _ furcation _ of the resonance sets occurs .",
