    "bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) is a field of research with vast interest mainly because it touches several subjects in physics . as a phase transition from a classical gas to a coherent matter - wave sample",
    ", it provides a large variety of interest in thermodynamic . as a heavy occupation of phase space",
    ", bec is a nice object for quantum statistic . as a spontaneous symmetry breaking",
    ", it shows interest in quantum field theory .",
    "many phenomena related to bec in the past , like superfluidity and superconductivity can now be investigated in a controlled way .",
    "the field of atomic quantum optics has also presented many interesting possibilities related to bec . finally , bec has opened up new windows into the quantum world in general .",
    "one of the interesting possibilities to be investigated using a bec is the creation of condensate samples in a non ground state configuration .",
    "such a non - equilibrium system can be formed if one first obtains the ground state condensate followed by a resonant pumping transfer to an excited state .",
    "such schemes have been theoretically investigated by our group @xcite and shall be one of the goals of our experiments in the future .",
    "another interesting possibility is the investigation of bec from the thermodynamic point of view considering thermodynamic variables @xcite .",
    "a sample of such investigation is presented in this paper .    in this paper",
    "we report the first realization of bec in na atoms in our laboratory .",
    "we have followed , using absorption images , the temperature and density of atoms within the trap up to our optical resolution . using these parameters",
    "we have followed the phase - space path that takes the sample to quantum degeneracy .",
    "we start presenting our experimental setup followed by the results and discussion .",
    "an application of our _ in situ _ observation is the determination of the thermodynamic parameters and evolution as the atoms are cooled to degeneracy , which is presented in the last section .",
    "in order to generate the conditions to attain bec in na , it is necessary to start with a thermal beam . we have loaded a magnetic optical trap ( mot ) from a slow atomic beam , followed by the necessary steps to bec @xcite .",
    "our experimental system is presented in figure 1 .",
    "an effusive sodium beam is decelerated in a tapered solenoid employing the dark - spot zeeman tuning technique @xcite .",
    "the process ends with a continuous flux of slow atoms emerging from the solenoid in the lower hyperfine state .",
    "although the atoms are decelerated in the cycling transition @xmath1 , as they approach the end of the slowing solenoid , the lower amplitude of the field as well as the configuration of the field lines create adequate conditions to optically pump the atoms to the @xmath2 hyperfine ground state . at this point",
    "the deceleration process stops abruptly and the slowed atoms migrate out of the solenoid without interacting with the slowing laser , travelling about 40 cm before being captured by the beams of a mot .",
    "three ring dye lasers ( coherent-699 ) provide the laser beams for the slowing , trapping and repumping transitions .",
    "all lasers are frequency stabilized and externally locked to the appropriated atomic transition , using vapor cell and saturated absorption signal . the slower laser is tuned to about 50 mhz to the red of the @xmath3 .",
    "the two other lasers are used to produce the trapping and repumping frequencies of the mot .",
    "the trapping frequency is tuned -5 mhz from @xmath4 transition while the repumping light is tuned to @xmath5 transition .",
    "the mot operates as a _ dark - spot _",
    "@xcite , where the trapped atoms are confined in a hyperfine ground state which does not interact with the trapping laser frequencies . to create the _ dark - spot",
    "_ we placed a physical obstacle to block the central region of the repumper laser beam .",
    "in such scheme , the atoms located in the dark region are rapidly pumped to the lower energy ground state where they do not interact with the lasers , allowing to produce a dense sample of ground state atoms .",
    "this is a very important point to make an efficient transfer of atoms from the motphase to the magnetic trap .",
    "the magnetic trap is the quadrupole and ioffe configuration ( quic)@xcite , whose coils arrangement is presented in figure 2 .",
    "the system is composed of the two main coils ( quadrupole coils ) and an ioffe coil .",
    "each of the coils were winded using copper tube ( with a diameter of 1/8 inch ) and the number of turns in each coils is 50 for quadrupole and 30 , for the ioffe coil . for a quadrupole current of 230 a and the ioffe of 220 a , the produced trap field in the ioffe axis as well as",
    "the field contour lines in the plane x - z are shown in figure 3a and b , respectively .",
    "the quic trap confining potential is close to an harmonic oscillator , in our case , with the following frequencies : @xmath6 x 36.7 @xmath7 ; @xmath8 x 120.8 @xmath7 and @xmath9 x 159.6 @xmath10    once the atoms are in magnetic trap the evaporation process starts evaporation . through a one photon rf transition @xmath11 , the hottest atoms are transferred to the untrapped state carrying away energy .",
    "the rf determines the magnetic field at which position atoms undergo a spin - flip transition , been ejected from the trap .",
    "thus the remaining atoms rethermalize through elastic collisions to lower temperatures . therefore ,",
    "sweeping the rf from a top value down , we force the evaporation until reaching the critical temperature to observe bec . during the evaporation stage",
    ", the atoms must be shielded from any resonant light , that may cause optical transition destroying the sample .",
    "the rf antenna is a coil placed close to the cell having 5 turns of wire in a rectangular frame of @xmath12 x @xmath13 cm . in our experiment",
    "we use two stages of evaporation : first on the quadrupole trap after compression and the final evaporation on harmonic profile of the quic when ioffe coil has full current .",
    "our transference procedure consists of loading the mot with about 10@xmath14 atoms and initially transfer then to the quadrupole trap followed by compression during 2 seconds .",
    "after final compression in quadrupole trap , at a field gradient of 230 gauss / cm , rf is applied to promote evaporation during 5 seconds from 100 to 30 mhz . then after this first stage of evaporation , the ioffe coil is turned on gradually during 2 seconds , producing the final field configuration where the evaporation procedure is completed with rf from 30 mhz to final frequency ( 1.65 mhz to reach bec ) .    at different stages of the cooling process , either a time of flight ( tof ) measurement can be performed to obtain the temperature or the _ in situ _ absorption imaging can be performed similarly to experiments already done @xcite .",
    "our imaging system , composed of lenses and a spatial filtered laser beam , allows us to obtain the absorption image with a resolution of 5 @xmath15 m .",
    "we have obtained absorption image with the magnetic field on .",
    "the image is normally obtained together with interferences and remaining defects of the optics .",
    "those imperfections can be cleaned out using a fourier transform procedure to remove high frequency structures on the image .",
    "the full time sequence of the magnetic trap loading and evaporation as well as imaging timing is presented in figure 4 .",
    "before starting the presentation of our results we would like to present the overall sequence of absorption images given to the reader the general idea of the experiment . on figure 5 on the right hand side we show the typical size of the atomic cloud and the number of atoms . on the left hand side we have the typical temperature for each stage . in brief , the sample starts with 10@xmath14 atoms at 500 @xmath16 and ends at 70 nk with a few thousand atoms in the condensate .",
    "when we start , the atoms are very much spreaded around the quadrupole trap . starting the evaporation the na atoms concentrate towards the center of the trap and the asymmetric geometry of the magnetic field shows up on the atomic cloud . just after reaching bec ,",
    "the limit of resolution of our optical system appears to start to become important .",
    "these results were obtained using the relation between the images and the magnetic trap geometry .",
    "the quic potential can be expresses as    @xmath17    and the atomic density is found to be in good approximation with    @xmath18    through absorption imaging one can obtain the values of @xmath19 and @xmath20 as well as the peak density at the trap center @xmath21 , using a simple integration . considering @xmath19 and",
    "@xmath22 one obtain the temperature of the cloud , since a hotter gas spread more in space according to kt = m@xmath23 .",
    "once we obtain @xmath24 and t , the peak phase space density @xmath25 is evaluated . considering @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the thermal de broglie wavelength , as the peak phase space density , one obtain for na that    @xmath28    for @xmath24 in @xmath29 and t in kelvin .",
    "according to previous work @xcite , once @xmath0 reaches the value 2.612 , the condensation starts to take place .",
    "for each final evaporation frequency we obtain @xmath0 and the result is presented in figure 6 where the peak phase space density evolution can be followed and for the final rf frequency of 1.65 mhz , the bose - einstein condensation is achieved . at this point",
    "we obtain @xmath30 , but still most part of the atoms are in the thermal cloud .",
    "since at this point we have reached our resolution limit , thus we just overestimate the temperatures and underestimate the peak density , thus @xmath31 must be larger than the reported value",
    ". we should observe that only a few thousand atoms are predicted to be in the condensate .",
    "according to characteristic values of our trap , the ground state size should have @xmath32 @xmath33 @xmath34 @xmath15 m , @xmath35 @xmath33 @xmath36 @xmath15 m and @xmath37 @xmath33",
    "@xmath38 @xmath15 m , if interactions are not considered . using those values and the measured number of atoms in crossing the bec line , we obtain the critical temperature tc @xmath33 61 nk which is very close to the measured 70 nk@xmath39    this kind of analysis is only valid if the system is close to an ideal gas . to verify if that is true we must compare the atomic energy of the ground state with the interaction energy at the critical point . the ground state is @xmath40 @xmath33 @xmath41 ( @xmath42{\\omega _ { \\text{x}}\\omega _ { \\text{y}}\\omega _ { \\text{z}}}$ ] ) , which correspond to 6.7 nk . on the other hand in the thomas - fermi approximation @xcite ,",
    "the interaction energy / particle is given by @xmath43 @xmath44 , where @xmath45 with @xmath46 = 52(5 ) @xmath47 @xcite , which is the scattering length .",
    "in the present case , @xmath48 @xmath332 nk and therefore we can neglect the interactions and consider the system as an ideal gas .    the small number of atoms attained in our bec can be justified through of an investigation of the variation of the number of atoms as a function of temperature .",
    "the obtained result is presented in the figure 7 .",
    "as the evaporation on quic trap progress , two distinct regimes are observed . in a first regime n@xmath49t@xmath50 , while for the second n@xmath49t@xmath51 .",
    "such dependences can explain the low achieved number .",
    "efficient evaporation requires an elastic collision rate to be larger than the loss rate . for continued cooling , the so called runaway evaporation , the elastic collision rate must be maintained despite the atom number reduction .",
    "the dependence of the atom number with temperature can be written as n@xmath49t@xmath52 . if s1 , we have not reached the runaway evaporation condition and we lose more atoms than necessary . if s1 the condition for runaway evaporation is fulfilled , and better evaporative efficiency is obtained .",
    "in our case we observe that runaway evaporation is only obtained at the final stage of the evaporation process .",
    "because of this , most part of the atoms are expelled from the trap remaining only the coldest part and this costs a large number of atoms , which explains the bec with such small number .",
    "we have tried to optimize the first part of evaporation to improve the final result , however we have not yet been able to accomplish such improvement .",
    "most probable reason is that for obtaining such improvement we have to slow down the rf sweeping speed , but in this case the lifetime of the trapped atoms due to background collision become a limiting fact on the process .",
    "some modifications on our system must to be done to solve this problem .",
    "little attention has been paid to the thermodynamic of the cold trapped gas system . for this system ,",
    "usual pressure and volume are no longer thermodynamic variables , since the confining potential is not homogeneous .",
    "different from the rigid walls container , atoms trapped in a magnetic field interacts ( with different amplitudes ) everywhere in the potential .",
    "this results in a non homogeneous spatial distribution of gas . in this sense",
    "we can not carry on a thermodynamic analysis using conventional pressure and volume to investigate the confined gas thermodynamics .",
    "it is necessary to redefine the intensive and extensive variables . in a recent paper , v. romero - rochin @xcite has investigated a confined gas in a three dimensional harmonic potential and shown that pressure and volume are well replaced by new variables .",
    "the extensive variable `` volume '' @xmath53  is now replaced by the inverse cube of the harmonic frequency @xmath54 .",
    "there is also a conjugated intensive variable , which plays the same role of usual pressure and is responsible for the mechanical equilibrium of the gas .",
    "both variables work as  `` volume '' and  `` pressure '' in the thermodynamical sense . considering a system composed of n particle in equilibrium at temperature t",
    ", the thermodynamic treatment reveals that the state equation for such system , i. e. , the combination of redefined @xmath53 and @xmath55 gives@xcite :    @xmath56    where @xmath57 represents an average integration over the external potential .",
    "this pressure is referred as harmonic pressure to distinguish the conventional pressure for gas in a box . in an explicit form , if the gas is subjected to the potential as eq .",
    "( 1 ) has a density profile @xmath58 as in eq .",
    "( 2 ) , one gets    @xmath59    in our experiment we have followed _ in situ _ @xmath60 and knowing well the potential parameters we have followed @xmath61 as a function of t. since @xmath62x@xmath63y@xmath63z@xmath64n one find that for the gaussian density distribution , one obtain    @xmath65    where @xmath19 , @xmath66 and @xmath20 depend on the gas temperature and @xmath67 is equal to a dimensional numerical constant which depends on the single particle mass .    in this work we have done the first set of measurements to prove eq . ( 6 ) in a situation where @xmath68 is kept constant .",
    "this is equivalent to an isocoric transformation of the trapped gas .",
    "as the evaporation takes place we record @xmath19 and @xmath20 and estimate @xmath69 , by the relation between the oscillation frequencies .",
    "thus with the total number of particle and gas temperature we create a plot of @xmath70 as a function of t , as shown in figure 8 , previously to reach bec .",
    "the observed linearity of @xmath71 with t shows that @xmath72 @xmath73 t , as expected since the limits presented by v. romero - rochinvitor in his work is the classical limit where the defined pressure and volume would obey the ideal gas state equation .",
    "we would like to explore the deviation of the state equation from the ideal gas case . that will allow us to finally evaluate the heat capacity and other important thermodynamic functions as the gas passes from the classical to the quantum regime .",
    "this work is now under preparation . for this purpose",
    "is extremely important the detection of the atomic distribution as the gas is still trapped ( _ in situ _ detection ) .",
    "a full investigation of harmonic pressure under isothermal or isochoric transformation will be implemented in our laboratory .",
    "in this work we demonstrate that we have achieved bose - einstein condensation in a sample of na atoms by _ in situ _ observation of the atomic density profile and temperature , resulting in the evaluation of the phase - space density .",
    "the overall analysis allows us to understand that the final low number of atoms was consequence on the fact that runaway evaporation only took place at the final stage of the process .",
    "the route to bec was also analyzed on a thermodynamic view showing the evolution of the gas pressure as the temperature was lowered .",
    "the _  in situ _ observation of the gas will allow us further thermodynamical analysis of the system as it approaches bec .",
    "we would like to thank to daniel v. magalhes , phillipe w. courteille , robin kaiser and kristian helmerson by helpful discussions and technical support .",
