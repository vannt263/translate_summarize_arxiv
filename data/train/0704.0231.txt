    "let @xmath0 be an open finite riemann surface endowed with the poincar ( hyperbolic ) metric .",
    "we will study some properties of holomorphic functions in the riemann surface with uniform growth control . namely we will deal with the banach space @xmath1 of holomorphic functions in @xmath0 such that @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a given subharmonic function that controls the growth of the functions in the space .",
    "the fact that @xmath3 is subharmonic is a natural assumption on the weight that limits the growth since any other growth control given by a weight @xmath4 , @xmath5 can be replaced by an equivalent subharmonic function because @xmath6 is a subharmonic function and @xmath7 with equality of norms , latexmath:[$\\sup_s |f|e^{-\\psi}= \\sup_s     we have fixed a metric .",
    "it is then natural to restrict the possible weights @xmath3 , in a way that the functions in @xmath9 oscillate in a controlled way when the points are nearby in the poincar metric .",
    "this is achieved for instance by assuming that @xmath3 has bounded laplacian ( the laplace - beltrami operator with respect to the hyperbolic measure ) .",
    "that is , if in a local coordinate chart the poincar metric is of the form @xmath10 , then we assume that @xmath11 satisfies @xmath12 .",
    "if we want to deal with other weights then it is possible to introduce a natural metric associated to the weight as it is done in the plane in @xcite . in this work",
    "we will only consider the poincar metric and bounded laplacian since it already covers many interesting cases and it is technically simpler .",
    "the problems that we will consider are the following :    1 .   the description of the interpolating sequences for @xmath1 : i.e. the sequences @xmath13 such that it is always possible to find an @xmath14 such that @xmath15 for all @xmath16 whenever the data @xmath17 , satisfies the compatibility condition @xmath18 2 .   the description of sampling sets for @xmath1 : i.e. the sets @xmath19 such that there is a constant @xmath20 that satisfies @xmath21    in the solution of these problems the poincar distance and the potential theory in the surface play a key role .",
    "this has already been observed by a.  schuster and d.  varolin in @xcite , where they provide sufficient conditions for a sequence to be interpolating / sampling for functions in a slightly different context where the weighted uniform control of the growth of the functions is replaced by a weighted @xmath22 control .",
    "their condition basically coincides with the description that we reach so our work can be considered as the counterpart of their theorems , although we will give a different proof of their results as well .",
    "we will rely on the well - known case of the disk and some simplifying properties of finite riemann surfaces .",
    "their method of proof looks more promising if one wants to extend the result to riemann surfaces with more complicated topology .",
    "when the surface is a disk , which will be our model situation , the corresponding problems have been solved in @xcite , @xcite and in a different way in @xcite .",
    "of course , the more basic problem of describing the interpolating sequences for bounded holomorphic functions in finite riemann surfaces ( in our notation @xmath23 ) , has been known for a long time , see @xcite ) .",
    "we introduce now some definitions that will be needed to state our results . for any point @xmath24 and any @xmath25",
    "we denote by @xmath26 the domain in the surface @xmath0 that consits of points at hyperbolic distance from @xmath27 less than @xmath28 .",
    "they are topological disks if the center @xmath27 is outside a big compact of @xmath0 , or if @xmath28 is small enough , as we will see in section  [ rs ] .",
    "a sequence @xmath29 of points in @xmath0 is hyperbolically separated if there is an @xmath30 such that the domains @xmath31 are pairwise disjoint .",
    "let @xmath32 be the green function associated to the surface @xmath26 with pole at the `` center '' @xmath27 and @xmath33 be the green function associated to the surface @xmath0 .",
    "we define the densities @xmath34    the main result is    [ main ] let @xmath0 be a finite riemann surface and let @xmath3 be a subharmonic function with bounded laplacian .    1 .   a sequence @xmath13 is an interpolating sequence for @xmath1 if and only if it is hyperbolically separated and @xmath35 .",
    "2 .   a set @xmath19 is a sampling set for @xmath1 if and only if it contains an hyperbolically separated sequence @xmath36 such that @xmath37 .    in section  [ rs ]",
    "we will prove some key properties of finite riemann surfaces .",
    "in particular we need to study the behavior of the hyperbolic metric as we approach the boundary of the surface .",
    "we will also prove some weighted uniform estimates for the inhomogeneous cauchy - riemann equation in the surface , theorem  [ dbar ] , that has an interest by itself .    in the next section",
    ", we use the tools and lemmas proved in section  [ rs ] to reduce the interpolating and sampling problem in @xmath0 to a problem near the boundary that can be reduced to the known case of the disk .    finally in section  [ lebesgue ]",
    "we show how our results can be extended to other banach spaces of holomorphic functions where the uniform growth is replaced by weighted @xmath38 spaces .    a final word on notation .",
    "by @xmath39 we mean that there is a constant @xmath40 independent of the relevant variables such that @xmath41 and by @xmath42 we mean that @xmath39 and @xmath43 .",
    "we start by the definition and then we collect some properties of @xmath0 that follow from the restrictions that we are assuming on the topology of @xmath0 .    a finite riemann surface is the interior of a smooth bordered compact riemann surface .",
    "our surface is an open riemann surface and it is in fact an open subset of a compact surface ( the double , see @xcite ) . see figure  [ fsurface ] for a typical representation .",
    "observe that the genus is finite and the border of the surface consists of a finite number of smooth closed jordan curves . in most of what follows",
    "the particular case of a smooth finitely connected open set in @xmath44 has all the difficulties of the general case .",

    "the analogous functions that provide us with the same property in the case of finite riemann surfaces are given by the next proposition :    [ blashcke ] there is a constant @xmath53 such that for any point @xmath24 there is a function @xmath54 with @xmath55 in particular @xmath56 is a bounded holomorphic function that vanishes only on the point @xmath27 and for any @xmath30 @xmath57 if @xmath58 .",
    "the obstruction for an harmonic function @xmath47 to have an harmonic conjugate is that for a set of generators @xmath59 of the homology we have @xmath60 , @xmath61 .",

    "being a finite riemann surface there are @xmath65 functions in the algebra of @xmath0 without zeros such that @xmath66 , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma  1 ) .",
    "thus the function @xmath67 is the logarithm of an holomorphic function @xmath68 .",
    "therefore there is a constant @xmath40 such that any harmonic function @xmath47 in @xmath0 admits an holomorphic function @xmath69 with @xmath70 . take a point @xmath24 and any holomorphic function @xmath71 that vanishes only on @xmath27 .",
    "then @xmath72 is harmonic in @xmath0 and therefore there is a holomorphic function @xmath73 such that @xmath74 .",

    "there is a closed geodesic @xmath80 that is homotopic to @xmath78 .",
    "the subdomain of @xmath0 bounded by @xmath80 and @xmath81 is denoted a `` funnel '' following the terminology of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we need to be more precise about the hyperbolic metric in the funnel .",
    "there are nice coordinates in the funnel that provide good estimates .",
    "these are given by the collar theorem .",

    "we can add an harmonic function @xmath150 to @xmath265 in such a way that @xmath266 uniformly on compact sets . thus @xmath267 has a partial convergent to @xmath268 , @xmath269 and @xmath270 which was not possible by assumption .    in the other direction , we assume that @xmath29 is a sampling sequence for @xmath1 , and @xmath242 .",
    "we want to prove that any @xmath271 that vanishes in @xmath243 is identically @xmath144 .",
    "take a sequence of points @xmath238 that escapes to infinity and @xmath217 the associated triple that converges weakly to @xmath241 . as @xmath272 and @xmath273 uniformly on compact sets",
    "we can take a sequence of radii @xmath274 such that @xmath275 , @xmath276 and @xmath277 .",
    "if @xmath69 vanishes in @xmath243 that means that @xmath69 is very small in @xmath278 .",
    "assume that @xmath279 .",
    "take a cutoff function @xmath280 such that @xmath281 outside @xmath282 , @xmath283 , and @xmath284 .",
    "define @xmath285 , where @xmath286 is the solution estimates by theorem  [ dbar ] .",
    "clearly @xmath287 is small in all points of @xmath100 and it has at least norm @xmath214 .",
    "thus we are contradicting the fact that @xmath29 is sampling .",
    "observe that one particular instance of finite riemann surface , where we can apply the result are the disks @xmath195 associated to the funnels with the metric @xmath104 .",
    "the final piece for the proof of theorem  [ sampling ] is then    [ disc ] if @xmath0 is a finite riemann surface , @xmath3 a subharmonic function with bounded laplacian and @xmath29 is a uniformly separated sequence , then all possible weak limits coincide with the weak limits of the disks associated to the surface , i.e , @xmath288    the proof amounts to the observation that the metric in @xmath195 converges uniformly to the metric in @xmath0 as @xmath289 , and in the definition of weak limits we only consider uniform convergence over compacts .",
    "theorem  [ sampling ] follows now immediately from theorem  [ beurling ] and lemmas [ uniqueness ] and [ disc ] .",
    "now theorem  [ sampling ] and theorem  [ interpolation ] show that the property of being a sampling / interpolating sequence are determined by the behavior near the boundary , more precisely in the associated disks . in these disks",
    "there is a precise description of the interpolating and sampling sequences ( see @xcite and @xcite ) that can be transported to the surface .",
    "if we rewrite it we get the density conditions of theorem  [ main ] , but the disks are not hyperbolic disks on the surface , they correspond to hyperbolic disks in disks @xmath195 , but since the condition is only relevant near the boundary , then the disks in both metrics look more an more similar",
    ". moreover the difference between the corresponding green functions converge to @xmath144 uniformly as we go to the boundary .",
    "finally , as the sequence is uniformly discrete and the laplacian of the weight is bounded above and bellow , the small difference is absorbed by the fact that the inequalities are strict and this proves theorem  [ main ] .",
    "in fact it is possible to replace in the definition of the density , the green function @xmath290 of @xmath26 by the green function @xmath182 of @xmath0 , because as before @xmath291 as @xmath27 approaches the boundary .",
    "we have considered up to now pointwise growth restrictions .",
    "it is possible to obtain from our theorem other results in different banach spaces of holomorphic functions . consider for instance the weighted bergman spaces @xmath292 where @xmath293 is s the hyperbolic area measure in @xmath0 and @xmath294 .",
    "the natural problem in this context is the following :        the spaces @xmath299 can be empty if we only ask @xmath3 to be with positive bounded laplacian .",
    "it is then natural to require that the laplacian is strictly bigger than one so that the laplacian plus the curvature of the metric in the manifold is strictly positive and there are functions in the space ( consider the case of the disk @xmath300 for instance ) .",
    "the proof of the theorem is the same mutatis - mutandi as in the @xmath306 setting .",
    "the basic tool that allows us to glue the pieces together is the next theorem which is the generalization of theorem  [ dbar ] and it is proved in the same way :    [ dbarlp ] let @xmath0 be a finite riemann surface , let @xmath3 be a subharmonic function with a bounded laplacian strictly bigger than one and let @xmath294 .",
    "there is a constant @xmath307 such that for any @xmath45-form @xmath46 on @xmath0 there is a solution @xmath47 to the inhomogeneous cauchy - riemann equation @xmath131 in @xmath0 with the estimate @xmath308 whenever the right hand is finite .",
    "the proof of this result is again the same as in theorem  [ dbar ]",
    ". we can separately solve the c - r equation in each funnel using theorem  2 from @xcite .",
    "we glue them together with a c - r equation with data that has compact support that can be solved with the operator .",
