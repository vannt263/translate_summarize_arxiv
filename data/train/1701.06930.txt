    "investigating emergent non - equilbrium behavior in such an artificial model system composed of active and passive components can potentially help distinguish what biological interactions can be attributed to purely physical phenomena and which interactions require presumably physical and biological / biochemical stimuli .    here , we study a model active matter system that is composed of both passive and active components to study the aggregation of active particles .",

    "the spinners are made active by externally applying a magnetic field which rotates around the axis perpendicular to the plane of the monolayer .",

    "in particular our coarse grained model consists of pseudo - hard sphere particles  @xcite , n=324 , suspended on a fluid of density @xmath6 = 1 and kinetic viscosity @xmath7 = 1/6 modeled using the lattice - boltzman method .",

    "however , we believe that the origin of this scaling behavior is similar to that observed in traditional 2d coarsening  @xcite .    we hypothesize that the difference between the exponents of the dynamic scaling observed in experiments and simulations is due to the magnetic interaction between clusters of spinners , which increases the strength of the spinner - spinner attraction at short distances .",

    "we have previously reported that for a system composed of purely active particles the spinners will repel due to the secondary flows generated by the spinners  @xcite .",
    "the spinners within the cluster should then repel , but the passive monolayer exerts a force on the spinners that serves to stabilize the active cluster .",
    "this is evident from the stochastic fluctuations shown in the cluster size time evolution , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2]b and [ fig4 ] , which corresponds to clusters breaking and reforming during the aggregation process .",
    "the size of the fluctuations increases with the spinners concentration , due to the bigger size of the clusters .    aside from the mechanical properties of the monolayer ,",
    "the other requisite for spinner attraction is the ability to stress the passive monolayer .",
    "therefore , we also explore the effect of the spinners activity on the aggregation dynamics by applying different rotational frequencies , re = 0.1 , 0.72 and 3.58 , to spinners embedded in passive matrixes of @xmath16 = 0.8 . in agreement with our previous observations for the spinner - spinner interaction in passive environments  @xcite ,",

    "is not large enough to promote the occurrence of yielding events , which ultimately results in spinner aggregation  @xcite . on the contrary ,",
    "spinners rotating at re @xmath23 0.72 do aggregate , and the higher the rotational frequency , the faster the evolution of the system , as shown in fig .",
    "interestingly , the dynamic scaling exponent of the spinner aggregation seems to be independent on the rotational frequency .",
    "however , the range of the initial dynamical regime , which probably corresponds to the fastest growing unstable composition mode , shifts towards shorter times .",
    "the spinner - spinner attraction in passive matrixes follows activated dynamics  @xcite .",
    "the monolayer region in between the two spinners ( i.e. the bridge ) needs to be loaded before it yields , which has an associated time scale .",
    "this time scale depends on the mechanical properties and configuration of the monolayer . if the stress applied by the spinners overcomes this time scale , the passive particle mobility increases , resulting in yielding events  @xcite , which leads to the erosion or degradation of the bridge .",
    "therefore , the higher the rotational frequency of the spinners ( i.e. re ) , the shorter time required to stress the bridge and thus , as the frequency of the spinners increases the faster the growth of the clusters at short time scales .",
    "the differences observed between the experiment and simulations on the re comes from the approximations made in our simulation model .",
    "for example , in our simulations the momentum transfer between the spinner and neighboring particles comes exclusively from the fluid , while in the experiment friction and collision between particles may play an important role in transferring momentum .",
    "we further investigate the microscopic details of the spinner aggregation process by tracking the active clusters over time , noting when clusters collide , initial separation distances between clusters which merge , and the velocity at which clusters approach , as shown in fig .",
