    "the dust cycle is currently considered as the key process controlling the variability of the martian climate at interseasonal and interannual time scales , as well as the weather variability at much shorter time scales .",
    "the atmospheric thermal and dynamical structures , as well as the transport of aerosols and chemical species , are all strongly dependent on the dust spatio - temporal distribution , particle sizes , and optical properties .    since the first scientific observations of a planet - encircling dust storm by ground - based telescopes in the late 50 s",
    ", dust has been one of the main objectives of many of the spacecraft missions to mars over more than 40 years .",
    "recent and ongoing missions , such as mars global surveyor ( mgs ) , mars odyssey ( ody ) , mars express , mars exploration rover ( mer ) , mars reconnaissance orbiter ( mro ) , and mars science laboratory , have included spectrometers , radiometers or imagers to measure radiances at wavelengths sensitive to dust .",
    "atmospheric dust can be qualitatively observed by spacecraft cameras , such as the mars orbiter camera ( moc ) aboard mgs , and the mars color imager ( marci ) aboard mro ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* for dust climatologies based on camera observations , as well as the mars daily weather websites ) .",
    "one of the key physical parameters used to quantify the presence of mineral dust in the atmosphere is the column ( or total ) optical depth ( or optical thickness ) .",
    "it is a measure of the fraction of radiation at a specific wavelength that would be removed from the vertical component of a beam during its path through the atmosphere by absorption and scattering due to airborne dust .",
    "it can also be defined as the integral over an atmospheric column of the profile of the extinction opacity ( or extinction coefficient ) , where extinction accounts for absorption and scattering .",
    "the column optical depth is the product of dust retrievals when the radiances are obtained by nadir - viewing instruments .",
    "profiles of extinction opacity can be derived from radiances measured by limb - viewing instruments , providing important information on the vertical extension of the dust .",
    "other important properties related to dust , such as the size distribution and the optical parameters , are more difficult to retrieve from direct measurements of radiances @xcite .",
    "the knowledge of the spatio - temporal distribution of dust is of primary importance to produce quantitative estimates of dust mass mixing ratios , and calculate the atmospheric heating rates due to absorption and scattering of solar and infrared ( ir ) radiation by airborne particles .",
    "these calculations are the basis for describing the thermal forcing in mars atmospheric models , and producing accurate predictions of the atmospheric state .",
    "the choice of scenarios ( i.e. spatio - temporal distributions ) of dust optical depth has a significant impact on martian global climate model ( gcm ) simulations .",
    "model studies have often been carried out with analytical specifications of dust distributions , both in the horizontal and in the vertical @xcite .",
    "more recently , modeling groups have been carrying out simulations with more realistic horizontal dust distributions , tied to tes observations @xcite .",
    "we propose in this paper to create a well - documented set of dust scenarios to be used in model experiments .",
    "although we focus our attention on the column - integrated dust distribution , it should be noted that the spatial variation of the vertical distribution of dust also plays a significant role in thermal response ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "there are a number of approaches to represent this vertical structure , which is beyond the scope of this paper .    to date",
    ", there exist several datasets of retrieved column dust optical depth ( cdod ) for mars , spanning more than 20 martian years ( my ) since the mariner era .",
    "these datasets are highly heterogeneous , as they have been created using data from different instruments having different geometric views , spatial and temporal coverage , as well as different observing wavelengths .",
    "nonetheless , we show in this paper that at least some of these datasets can be appropriately used to quantitatively reconstruct the recent dust climatology on mars , and characterize the variability over many seasonal cycles .",
    "this paper seeks to produce a continuous , multiannual climatology of cdod from early march 1999 ( solar longitude @xmath0 in my 24 ) to the end of july 2013 ( @xmath1 in my 31 ) . during this period of time , the thermal emission spectrometer ( tes , *",
    "* ) aboard mgs , the thermal emission imaging system ( themis , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on ody , and the mars climate sounder ( mcs , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on mro provided global coverage of radiance observations at ir wavelengths , from which @xcite obtained direct retrievals of cdod or estimates of this quantity from the integrated extinction profiles .    while images from orbiting spacecraft can provide information over large areas on the planet at any given time , observations of ir radiances from orbiting instruments have a very discrete coverage in longitude and local time due to the choice of orbit geometry .",
    "mgs and mro , for instance , have sun - synchronous , nearly 2-hour polar orbits , which provide good latitude coverage but only sample about a dozen longitudes , usually at close to two fixed local times of day except when crossing the poles ( dust can often only be retrieved in the daytime , restricting further to one local time ) . because dust storms on mars have a wide range of spatial and temporal scales @xcite , these discrete observations can affect the space - time representation of dust storm activity .",
    "extrapolating the data collected along orbit tracks to a broader range of local time and longitude introduces even more biases .",
    "synoptic maps produced using simple average binning may alter the representation of rapidly evolving dust distribution .",
    "we have developed a gridding methodology that is specifically adapted to heterogeneous observations , and to the discrete longitudinal / temporal coverage typical of spacecraft data acquisition .",
    "the objective is to produce daily , regularly gridded maps of absorption cdod at 9.3  @xmath2 for several consecutive martian years ( dust opacity in absorption is less dependent on the particle size than in extinction ) . to achieve the goal ,",
    "we have adopted a two - step procedure .",
    "the first step consists in calculating iteratively averages and standard deviations of observations on a regularly spaced but likely incomplete spatio - temporal grid , after having binned the data using time windows of different size , and applied appropriate weighting functions in space , time , and retrieval uncertainty at each iteration .",
    "we have established acceptance criteria for the gridded values , based on the number of reliable observations in each bin .",
    "we have used this first product to statistically study the dust variability over almost eight complete martian years .",
    "the second step consists in producing regular , daily maps of cdod by spatially interpolating and/or extrapolating the irregularly gridded maps , using a kriging method ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* for a general introduction on the technique ) .",
    "this multiannual series of synoptic maps of cdod is used for the dust scenarios in the gcm simulations that produce the current version of the mars climate database ( mcd version 5.1 , * ? ? ?",

    "the most up - to - date version of these products ( currently v1.5 ) can be downloaded in the form of netcdf files from the mcd project website , hosted by the laboratoire de mtorologie dynamique ( lmd ) .",

    "the main purpose is to compare the evolution of selected dust storms in the reconstructed cdod maps to the daily evolution that can be appreciated in camera images of the martian surface .      before using the cdod datasets retrieved from the different instruments , we have firstly checked the values against quality control criteria to eliminate unreliable data .    for all datasets ,",
    "negative values are only allowed if the sum of the value and the associated uncertainty ( see section  [ uncertainty ] ) is non - negative .",
    "although a single negative measurement ( in this specific case a ` measurement ' corresponds to a ` retrieval ' ) can be considered unphysical , the weight of negative measurements must be taken into account in statistical calculations to prevent biases towards statistically non - zero values .",
    "it is anticipated that both the gridded values described in section  [ gridding ] and the interpolated ones described in section  [ kriging ] are only accepted if they are positive , otherwise they are replaced by a minimum positive value of 0.02 . for specific datasets ,",
    "we have adopted the following quality control criteria .",
    "we show in figures  [ fig_retrievalnumberday ] and [ fig_retrievalnumbernight ] the number of cdod retrievals used in the present work .      for tes",
    ", we have retained cdod observations flagged as `` good quality '' by the tes team , which passed additional quality control criteria .",
    "specifically , we require that the surface temperature is greater than 220  k @xcite , the difference between surface temperature and maximum atmospheric temperature is greater than 5 k , the radiance fit residual is lower than 20 , the opacity of the carbon dioxide hot bands is between -0.01 and 0.05 , and the water ice opacity is greater than -0.05 ( the negative value threshold is constrained by the uncertainty ) .",
    "the surface temperature threshold insures a good signal - to - noise ratio , whereas the threshold on the temperature difference between surface and atmosphere prevents unreliable retrievals when the temperature contrast is too small .",
    "the latter case is particularly valid during high dust loading conditions , as showed by results from the geophysical fluid dynamics laboratory gcm ( gfdl - gcm ) and comparison with moc images during the 2001 planet - encircling dust storm @xcite . with the choice of these quality control criteria , retrievals",
    "are practically limited to daytime conditions over ice - free surfaces , and may be reduced during intense dust storms ( see figs  [ fig_retrievalnumberday ] and [ fig_retrievalnumbernight ] ) .",
    "themis cdod retrievals include several `` framelets '' in the same `` image '' , i.e. several values within the same stripe of observations .",
    "only the last framelet of each image is properly calibrated , but in this study we have considered all available framelets to increase the number of themis observations , especially in my  27 when we use no other observations .",
    "we associate a slightly larger uncertainty to non - calibrated framelets , as explained in section  [ uncertainty ] . for quality control purposes ,",
    "we have retained cdod values when the rms residual from the aerosol opacity fit is lower than 0.4 , and the surface temperature is greater than 210  k.      mcs observes the atmosphere in limb and off - nadir modes , which has the advantage of allowing the retrieval of vertical profiles of dust opacity , but has the disadvantage of not being able to observe the first few kilometres above the ground ( depending on the angle of observation ) . in order to estimate the column optical depth for aerosol dust",
    ", the mcs team has integrated the full profile of dust extinction opacity produced by the retrieval algorithm ( v4.0 is the version used in this work ) after a successful retrieval . the profile is extended upward and downward under the assumption of well mixed dust , based on the last valid value .",
    "the standard retrieved dust profile is often truncated when regions have measured radiances that are not fit by the forward radiative model within defined thresholds in dust , water ice or temperature . in the upper levels ,",
    "the minimum extinction coefficient threshold for dust is @xmath20 km@xmath21 . in the lower levels ,",
    "the profiles can get saturated by high opacity values , exceeding the threshold of @xmath22 km@xmath21 @xcite .",
    "column optical depth estimates , on the other hand , use non - truncated profiles to make sure all available and reasonable information is taken into account .",
    "the mcs dust profiles can not be retrieved down to the surface , and the dust in the un - retrieved part of the profile can account for a significant fraction of the total dust column .",
    "estimates of cdod from mcs observations , therefore , are likely to introduce errors attributable to either the extrapolation to the surface under the well mixed assumption or the use of dust opacity values at altitudes where the fit to observed radiances is not within the standard threshold",
    ". this problem may be particularly acute in light of evidence of elevated dust layers @xcite .",
    "mcs cdod estimates can be fairly inaccurate if the lowest retrieved level of dust opacity is above @xmath23  km altitude , depending on the time of the year and the dust / water ice conditions .",
    "we have therefore retained cdods that correspond to dust extinction profiles with valid values at least at or below 25 km altitude .",
    "dayside retrievals are particularly affected by low altitude aereosols . to prevent large extrapolation of dust extinction coefficient to the surface during daytime observations ,",
    "we only accept estimated daytime cdods when the corresponding extinction profile has valid values below 8 km altitude .",
    "furthermore , we have rejected cdod estimates when the temperature profile dropped below the condensation temperature of carbon dioxide at some pressure levels , because co@xmath24 ice opacity can affect retrievals of dust opacity at those levels ( carbon dioxide ice opacity is not currently taken into account in mcs retrievals ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning that this selection might introduce a systematic bias , especially during the northern spring and summer seasons in the tropics .",
    "tes provides daytime cdods while mcs estimates of cdod in this season are largely based on nighttime viewing , because daytime clouds in the aphelion tropical belt limit the success of retrievals .",
    " figure  [ fig_retrievalnumberday ]      figure  [ fig_retrievalnumbernight ]       the cdods from tes / themis and mcs are retrieved at different ir wavelengths , in absorption for tes / themis and in extinction for mcs , which prevents the direct comparison .",
    "we account for this problem by converting the estimated mcs extinction cdods at 21.6  @xmath2 into equivalent absorption cdods at 9.3  @xmath2 .",
    "we carry out the conversion by multiplying the mcs values by a factor 2.7 , which takes into account the effective dust particle radius ( 1.06  @xmath2 ) and variance ( 0.3 ) used in the retrievals ( version 4.0 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is worth mentioning that the dust size distribution is maintained fixed throughtout all seasons and locations .",
    "we use cdod from pancam cameras aboard mer - a and mer - b rovers at the near - ir wavelength of 880 nm .",
    "crism cdod retrievals are obtained at the near - ir wavelength of 900 nm .",
    "when using pancam and crism for validating the gridded maps in section  [ validation ] , we have to account for the differences between the absorption - only gridded values at 9.3  @xmath2 and the full extinction near - ir retrievals .",
    "this is done by converting the gridded values into equivalent visible values .",
    "the process firstly converts values from absorption - only at 9.3  @xmath2 to full - extinction values by multiplying by a factor 1.3 @xcite , then converts the latter to mean visible values by multiplying by a factor 2.0 , consistent with 1.5- to 2.0-@xmath2 dust particles @xcite .",
    "overall , the factor we use to convert from absorption - only at 9.3  @xmath2 to equivalent full - extinction visible is 2.6 .",
    "this factor , though , is affected by large errors , deriving from both the conversion to extinction @xcite , and the infrared - to - visible conversion @xcite , see also section  [ uncertainty ] .",
    "this is the reason why we have decided to provide our gridded products at the original ir wavelengths , despite the advantage of producing equivalent visible cdod maps for global and mesoscale atmospheric models , whose radiation schemes usually compute dust heating rates based on mean visible opacities using assumed ir / visible ratios .    in order to calculate spatial averages",
    ", we require that cdods are normalized to a reference pressure level , hence eliminating the effect of topographic inhomogeneities .",
    "the retrieved values are divided by the surface pressure at the appropriate location and time of year , extracted from the pres0 tool included in the mcd v4.3 @xcite , and multiplied by 610 pa , which is our choice for the reference pressure level .",
    "the cdods used in the present study , therefore , are equivalent to integrate or extrapolate the optical depth down to 610 pa at all locations on the planet , under the assumption of well - mixed dust .",
    "see section  [ uncertainty ] for a discussion of uncertainties associated to surface pressure .      we have estimated the uncertainty of each single cdod value that we have used in this work .",
    "the total uncertainty of an observation is provided as the propagation of single uncertainties detailed in this section , for each instrument .",
    "the error propagation is carried out using relative errors , which highly simplify the formulas .",
    "the squared relative propagated error reduces to the sum of squared relative errors on each independent variable when operations among variables include only multiplications and divisions , as in our case .",
    "an uncertainty that is common to all observations is associated to the value of the surface pressure extracted from the mcd v4.3 , which is used to extrapolate cdods to a specific pressure level .",
    "after the corrections for topography and total mass of the atmosphere , which are carried out within the pres0 routine of the mcd , the largest sources of surface pressure variability on mars are the weather systems , mainly in the form of dust storms and high latitude winter baroclinic waves . in order to account for this variability",
    ", we have extracted the day - to - day rms of surface pressure from the mcd ( see the mcd detailed design document associated to the version of the database described in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to build a @xmath25 solar longitude @xmath26 latitude array .",
    "we provide an estimate of the surface pressure uncertainty associated to the specific location and season of an observation by interpolating this array .",
    "retrievals of cdod from tes and themis observations come with an associated nominal uncertainty , estimated by taking into account random errors in the instrument and calibration , as well as possible systematic errors in the retrieval algorithms .",
    "@xcite gives an estimate for the total uncertainty in tes absorption - only ir dust optical depth for a single retrieval of 0.05 or 10% of the column optical depth , whichever is larger .",
    "@xcite provides this value for themis absorption - only ir dust optical depth for the calibrated framelet : 0.04 or 10% of the column optical depth , whichever is larger .    for themis observations",
    ", @xcite also states that `` uncertainties are likely somewhat higher ( perhaps 20% or even higher ) during the most intense dust storms because large corrections to the temperature profile must be made for those observations '' .",
    "it is likely that tes retrievals during high dust loading are also affected by larger uncertainties , due to the reduced surface - atmosphere temperature contrast and uncertainty in dust size distribution . in order to account for this ,",
    "for tes we use the nominal uncertainty up to ir optical depth 1.0 , then we increase the uncertainty to 20% up to ir optical depth 2.0 , and to 30% for ir optical depths greater than 2.0 . for themis",
    ", we use the nominal uncertainty up to ir optical depth 0.5 , we increase the uncertainty to 20% up to ir optical depth 2.0 , and to 30% for ir optical depths greater than 2.0 .    as for the non - calibrated themis framelets , we currently increase their uncertainties by 20% ( e.g. 0.06 instead of 0.05 when the cdod value is 0.5 )      as explained in section  [ quality ] ,",
    "the procedure adopted to estimate cdod from mcs observations is likely to introduce errors , particularly when the truncated dust profiles do not have valid values close to the surface . estimating these errors is particularly difficult , as crucial information may be missing in the atmospheric layers where the dust loading is significant .",
    "our estimate of the uncertainty on mcs cdods , therefore , can only be empirical . in section  [ summary ] , we mention future developments in relation to mcs cdod retrievals .    in this work ,",
    "we assign an uncertainty on the basis of the altitude of the lowest valid level in the dust profile used for the vertical integration .",
    "the uncertainty is linearly increasing from 5% ( nominal value ) to 60% as a function of this altitude , from the surface to the highest accepted level of 25 km .",
    "although this uncertainty estimate is arbitrary , it provides a way to distinguish mcs values that are likely to be biased , and to relatively evaluate this bias .",
    "this feature is used during the gridding procedure , as detailed in section  [ gridding ] .",
    "very small values of cdod estimated from dust extinction profiles that do not have valid values below 4 km are considered spurious and substituted with the minimum value of 0.01 , with 10% uncertainty ( i.e. 0.001 ) .",
    "finally , we consider that the 2.7 factor used to convert mcs extinction cdods at 21.6  @xmath2 to equivalent absorption cdods at 9.3  @xmath2 is affected by 10% uncertainty ( i.e. 0.3 ) , due to the uncertainty on the particle sizes .",
    "we take it into account in the propagation of uncertainties for mcs .",
    "we have averaged cdod retrievals from pancam and mini - tes observations in each available sol for both mer - spirit and mer - opportunity .",
    "we have also interpolated in time to fill the gaps in the sol - averaged time series for both mers . for sol - averaged pancam and mini - tes cdods , we use the largest value between the standard deviation and the average of single measurement errors as a measure of uncertainty on the daily mean .",
    "this choice takes into account cdod variations with local time as well as single measurement errors .",
    "as explained in section  [ dproc ] , we have decided to work at the original tes and themis absorption ir wavelength of 9.3  @xmath2 , except when comparing with pancam and crism retrievals .",
    "the conversion factors from absorption to extinction and from ir to visible depend on the aerosol refractive indexes , which ultimately depend on the aerosol size , shape and composition , and are likely to vary with seasons and locations .",
    "both factors are therefore affected by large uncertainties .",
    "@xcite shows in fig .",
    "4a a graph of the relationship between effective absorption and full extinction optical depth for dust at the equator at northern autumn equinox in my  24 ( it is stated that the curve is typical of other times and locations ) . for ir dust",
    "optical depths lower than 0.5 , the relationship is fairly linear ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "the departure from the linear relationship at higher dust optical depth can be estimated as @xmath28 .",
    "this estimate could be used to introduce an uncertainty on the absorption - to - extinction factor , which increases with the optical depth . as for the infrared - to - visible factor",
    ", uncertainties have been estimated in a few measurement campaigns , although limited in time and location .",
    "@xcite reports a value of @xmath29 from mer - pancam observations , @xcite reports in table  2 dust optical depth values from mer - pancam and mini - tes , which can be averaged to provide a value of @xmath30 .    in section  [ validation ] , we have simply used a single factor 2.6 ( @xmath31 ) throughout the time series to convert the gridded values to equivalent visible values , without explicitly taking the uncertainty on this factor into account .",
    "the process of creating uniformly - spaced data ( i.e. a regular grid ) from irregularly - spaced ( scattered ) data is generally known as ` gridding ' .",
    "there exist several techniques to solve this problem , depending on the applications .",
    "a basic technique commonly adopted when dealing with orbital spacecraft observations is ` binning ' using space - time box averages .",
    "the original data values which fall in a given multi - dimensional interval ( a ` bin ' ) are replaced by a value representative of that interval , often the average , but the median can also be used to filter outliers .",
    "if the bins are uniformly distributed , the problem of gridding the data is solved . for our purposes ,",
    "the simple box - average binning is not suitable because 1 ) we desire to achieve the highest possible spatio - temporal resolution for the cdod maps , compatibly with having a reasonable number of observations to grid , and 2 ) simple box averages introduce temporal and spatial biases if long time intervals and/or large spatial boxes are used ( several orbits at different times are inevitably averaged together ) .",
    "reconstructing the dust climatology while preserving the desired variability of dust storms at short time scale and small spatial scale , therefore , requires a more sophisticated data gridding . in order to achieve this objective ,",

    "the application of our gridding procedure is equivalent to a moving weighted average characterized by the use of successive spatio - temporal windows .",
    "the basic principle of the methodology is that , for a given grid point at a given time , all observations within a defined time window and spatial range are averaged using weights that depend on 1 ) the lag between the time of each observation and the required time at the grid point , 2 ) the spatial distance between each observation location and the location of the grid point , and 3 ) the uncertainty ( standard deviation ) of each observation . in this work ,",
    "we use the mars universal time ( mut ) of the prime meridian as absolute time variable to which we refer both the time of observations and the time of grid points on a synoptic map .",
    "the weighted average value @xmath32 at a given time @xmath33 and location @xmath34 for a generic observed variable @xmath35 , which is a function of time and spatial coordinates , is given by : @xmath36 where @xmath37 represents the index of the @xmath38 observations @xmath39 that are included in defined time window and space range ( a multi - dimensional bin built around the time @xmath33 and the location @xmath40 ) .",

    "the distance weight is also a function of the time lag @xmath46 so that observations at different times in the past or in the future with respect to @xmath33 have different distance weights .",
    "@xmath47 is the uncertainty weight , which determines the contribution of the @xmath42 observation according to its relative uncertainty ( @xmath48 is the observation standard deviation ) .",
    "the particular choice for the form of the weighting functions @xmath44 , @xmath41 , and @xmath47 depends on the specific application . for our purpose of creating synoptic maps of cdod using orbiting satellite observations , it is convenient to use weighting functions similar to those implemented in the analysis correction data assimilation scheme of the uk meteorological office @xcite and in the derived mars analysis correction data assimilation scheme @xcite .",
    "in fact , eq .  [ eq1 ] applied to @xmath49 grid points of a regular grid can be considered as the weighted average equivalent of the model grid point increment eq .  3.18 in the analysis correction scheme of @xcite , although this analogy has no formal basis .",

    "additionally , one can define the weighted root mean squared deviation ( or weighted standard deviation ) associated to the weighted average value @xmath54 as : @xmath55    we choose @xmath44 to be a second - order autoregressive correlation function of the distance @xmath56 from observation @xmath37 to grid point @xmath49 and of the correlation scale @xmath57 ( see also eq .  3.19 in * ?",

[ fig_weights ] ) . in other words ,",
    "smaller weights are assigned to distant observations when their time is closer to the current time .",
    "a further parameter , @xmath66 , sets the distance range on the spherical surface within which the contributions of the observations to the average are considered .",

    "we have used both tes and themis observations until @xmath78 in my  27 , then only themis observations . for my  28 ,",
    "we have used only themis until @xmath79 , then both mcs and themis , as well as in most of my  29 , 30 , and 31 , apart from @xmath80 , my  29 , to @xmath81 , my  30 , when only themis observations are available .",
    "3 .   for each set of observations ( tes , tes+themis , themis , mcs+themis )",
    "we have defined the parameters required by eq .",
    "[ eq2 ] , which are summarized in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "the iwb procedure then requires that , for each sol and for each spatial grid point , we define a time window and distance range within which we use observations to calculate the weighted average and its associated weighted standard deviation .",
    "we repeat the previous step iteratively , using different time windows , from the smallest to the largest ( the values we use are reported in table  [ tab1 ] ) , and calculating the weights accordingly . at each iteration",
    ", more valid grid points are added to the synoptic map , because more observations are considered , but we do not overwrite grid points flagged as valid in previous iterations .",
    "the criterion to accept a value of weighted average at a particular grid point is that there must be at least a minimum number of observations @xmath82 within a distance @xmath83 from the grid point , having relative uncertainties lower than a threshold value @xmath84 ( see values in table  [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "if this is not the case , a missing value is assigned to the grid point at that iteration .",
    "the final result of the successive application of the weighted binning equation consists in daily synoptic maps of cdod on the pre - defined regular grid , with missing values in places where the gridding criterion was not satisfied at any iteration .",
    "7 .   for the specific years my  27 to 31",
    ", we apply an additional step in the procedure by substituting some of the missing values with valid gridded values obtained with only themis observations using the parameters listed in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "this step is quite effective in reducing the gaps induced by the poor mcs coverage of major dust events and of the tropical regions affected by the aphelion cloud belt .",
    "it provides full weight to themis observations with less restrictive gridding parameters , allowing for valid grid points which would otherwise not satisfy the acceptance criterion of the normal procedure .",
    " table  [ tab1 ]       in order to illustrate the procedure of gridding when the observation coverage is good both in space and time ( at least for most latitudes ) , we use an example from tes observations in the northern winter of my  24 .",
    "[ fig_tes_time ] highlights one of the main reasons why the application of weighted binning in space and time is essential when gridding at high spatio - temporal resolution . in this figure , tes retrievals of cdod",
    "are shown within a time window of 7 sols ( about @xmath85 solar longitude at this season ) centered around noon at @xmath77 longitude in sol 449 , @xmath86 , my  24 . the area shown in the figure",
    "is limited to @xmath87 longitude and @xmath88 latitude south of the equator .",
    "the colours indicate the time lag between the time of an observation and the center time .",
    "it is clear that adjacent orbits have quite different time lags .",
    "a simple box average would certainly introduce biases in the creation of a synoptic map of cdod for this sol .     figure  [ fig_tes_time ]     the result of the iwb with increasing time windows is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_tes_tw ] .",
    "we separate each iteration ( tw=1 , 3 , 5 , and 7 sols ) in the panel series ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively showing the retrieved non - uniform values of tes cdod , and the uniformly gridded values .",
    "clearly , gridded values of cdod with larger tws are smoothed with respect to smaller tws , even if time weighting is applied in both cases .",
    "the result of the successive application of weighted binning is then shown in panel ( c ) , where the valid grid points in each iteration add to the valid values of the previous one , without overwriting .",
    "eventually , we obtain a fairly complete , regular map of cdod where the observations closer to the mut time of the synoptic map provide most of the unbiased information .",
    "this shows that an iterative weighted binning produces more valid and less biased values than the application of a single weighting with a fixed tw .",
    " figure  [ fig_tes_tw ]     the optimal spatial resolution for the gridded maps can be considered as the highest one which includes a reasonable number of observations in each spatio - temporal bin and , at the same time , produces results not dissimilar to those obtained at a lower resolution .",
    "ideally , the gridding method should not show much sensitivity with respect to the choice of reasonable spatial and temporal resolutions , particularly in the standard deviation field . in order to verify the quality of the choice we have made for the datasets reported in table  [ tab1 ] ,",
    "we have carried out a sensitivity test using four different cases , as illustrated in fig.[fig_my24_restests ] for a typical map with high dust optical depth contrasts ( same sol as in fig .",
    "[ fig_tes_tw ] ) . both averaged values and standard deviations ( which in this case represent the variability within the group of averaged observations ) show little variation throughout the four cases .",
    "this result illustrates ( at least for tes ) that our gridding procedure is not particularly sensitive to the choice of the spatial resolution within a limited range .",
    "this allows us to choose for tes in my  24 , 25 and 26 fairly high longitude and latitude resolutions , namely @xmath89 .",
    "the same latitude resolution can not be used for mcs , given the fact that the path of the limb observations usually spans several degrees in latitude , and there are fewer observations per degree than tes .",
    "finally , the sparse distribution of themis observations must be taken into account in the choice of the spatial resolution , when only themis data are available . in order to maintain a consistent resolution throughout my  28 , 29 , 30 and 31 we use @xmath90 in longitude and latitude .",

    "ideally , we want the highest time resolution to follow the development of regional dust storms , using as many independent observations as possible .",
    "given the number of tes and mcs orbits per sol ( respectively 12 and 13 ) , there are not enough independent observations to provide a sufficient spatial resolution below the 1-sol time resolution .",

[ fig_my29flush_evol ] shows the daily evolution of another regional storm occurring in my  29 at @xmath91 , which clearly highlights the large number of missing grid points .",
    "as previously mentioned in section  [ qualitymcs ] , mcs cdod estimates are few in numbers during episodes of high dust loading , and have large associated uncertainties because the retrieved dust extinction profile is missing in the dusty part of the atmosphere .",
    "the criterion we use for the acceptance of grid points , based on a minimum number of observations within a threshold distance having relative uncertainty below a defined threshold , is particularly strict for mcs and themis observations .",

    "other important factors to be considered are the shape of the histograms ( i.e. skeweness and kurtosis ) , which can highlight possible biases .",

    "tes histograms , on the other hand , are clearly right - skewed , which suggests that , in the gridded maps of my  24 , 25 and 26 , there are more largely overestimated cdods than largely underestimated ones .",
    "the asymmetry of the smd distributions for the tes years is consistent with lower values of the correlation coefficient for my  24 and 26 .",
    "the origin of such bias is mainly related to overestimated gridded cdods in correspondence to small observed ones .",

    "when looking at the sun through the atmospheric column , pancam in meridiani is likely to add water ice optical depth to the dust optical depth , thus explaining the bias .",
    "@xcite confirms that ice clouds and hazes were not a significant part of the opacity at the spirit site , which does not show biases with respect to observations from satellites .",
    "satellite measurements and gridded maps , therefore , should be considered more reliable in meridiani at this time of the year . at other times , in fact , the differences between pancam cdod and gridded cdod are well within the uncertainties , even during the my  28 planet - encircling dust storm when only themis observations are available for the gridding .",
    "when comparing the time series in gusev and meridiani , we can clearly observe and confirm from previous studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "they applied this technique to estimate cdods during the my  25 planet - encircling dust storm using tes observations , and in principle the same technique can be applied to mcs observations of brightness temperature .",

    "even when the number of valid grid points in the daily maps is low , the cdod variability can still be analysed statistically , provided data are averaged or filtered to prevent contamination from spurious values occurring at high frequencies ( e.g. `` on / off '' , isolated , large optical depths ) .",
    "we provide an atlas of daily , irregularly gridded maps for each available martian year as supplementary material of this paper .",
    "the reader can therefore explore the entire time series that forms the current version 1.5 of the cdod climatology obtained with iwb , before downloading the corresponding netcdf dataset from the lmd website ( at the address reported in the footnote of section  [ intro ] ) .",

    "the structure of the atlas helps the analysis of interannual variability .",
    "it is interesting , for instance , to look simultaneously at the cdod around sol 370 ( @xmath109 ) in my  24 , 25 , and 26 , a few sols before the beginning of the my  25 planet - encircling dust storm .",
    "it appears clearly that the cdod distribution was very similar in the three years observed by tes at this season , until sol 372 ( @xmath110 ) , when slightly higher cdod values appeared in the hellas basin in my  25 , prior to expansion out of this crater towards the northern rim and in hesperia planum .",
    "another feature that clearly stands out when looking at cdod at high southern latitudes at this season is that tes observed fairly high values near the polar cap edge , where dust is likely to be lifted by southern baroclinic waves , active at this time of the year , whereas no sign of such high values is present in the other years .",
    "very few themis observations are available in my  27 and 28 , so it is difficult to judge these two years , but it is evident that mcs observations are biased towards very low cdod values at high southern latitudes .    this bias of mcs observations can be observed even more clearly in the zonal means of gridded cdods , plotted as a function of solar longitude and latitude in each martian year ( fig .",
    "[ fig_zonalmean_grid ] ) .",
    "there is an evident dichotomy between the tes years , where the high northern and southern latitudes in northern spring and summer present increased optical depth values , and the mcs years , where values decrease towards high latitudes .",
    "panel ( a ) of fig .",
    "[ fig_stat_latallyears ] offers a striking summary of this dichotomy around @xmath111 .",
    "the reason for this important bias is most likely the fact that dust is aloft only in the lower portion of the atmosphere ( within the first kilometers ) at this season and at these latitudes .",
    "mcs limb observations are not able to scan through these low levels , therefore dust is missed by the radiometer , which detects only very small values of opacity above the low dust layer .",
    "future retrievals of cdod from mcs in - planet observations , or estimates from top - of - atmosphere brightness temperature fit , might eventually correct this bias .",
    "biases apart , the latitudinal , seasonal , and interannual variability of cdod can be fully appreciated in fig .",
    "[ fig_zonalmean_grid ] , which summarizes eight years of dust climatology on mars .",
    "this figure clearly highlights four distinctive phases in the distribution of dust during the second half of each year without a global - scale storm , and confirms what other studies have found , by using the longest available record of observations .",
    "dust starts to increase in the atmosphere around northern autumn equinox in the southern hemisphere , but the largest increase usually occurs between @xmath112 and @xmath113 , when baroclinic activity at high northern latitudes favours cross - equatorial flushing storms ( although not all regional storms occurring at this time originated in the northern plains ) .",
    "a third phase in the dust distribution is characterized by large lifting of dust occurring in the southern polar region between @xmath114 and @xmath115 , after the @xmath116 ice has mostly sublimated away . at other latitudes , instead",
    ", there is a clear decrease of atmospheric dust in every martian year after @xmath117 ( with the exception of my  28 , characterized by the late planet - encircling storm ) .",
    "this pause in large dust storms coincides with the decrease in the amplitude of low - altitude northern baroclinic waves ( the so - called  solsticial pause  , see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "when the solsticial pause is over , and the baroclinic wave activity at low altitude reinforces again , the probability of late flushing storms increases . every year , therefore , a fourth phase in the dust distribution starts around or after @xmath118 , producing a late peak of cdod .",
    " figure  [ fig_zonalmean_grid ]     the fairly repeatable pattern of cdod from year to year contrasts with the highly unpredictable occurrence of global - scale dust storms , both in terms of frequency and season .",
    "if global - scale storms did not occur on mars , and we did not take into account single regional storms , the `` typical '' annual distribution of cdod would look like the one in fig .",
    "[ fig_dodtypyear ] , where we have averaged all years together , excluding the largest cdod value for each grid point . in this figure ,",
    "the four distinct phases described above appear perfectly well defined .",
    "obviously , also the mcs bias around the edges of the polar caps stands out in this figure .",
    " figure  [ fig_dodtypyear ]     figs .",
    "[ fig_stat_eq_allyears ] and [ fig_stat_latallyears ] are useful to summarize similarities and differences among the years . at equatorial latitudes ,",
    "there is little interannual variability in northern spring / summer , and low cdod .",
    "the gradient of cdod increases moving towards southern tropical latitudes and northern high latitudes in tes years , whereas in mcs years the bias mentioned above appears . in the second half of the year ,",
    "the background dust level shows again little variability in the equatorial / tropical regions during the solsticial pause , except for the years with a global - scale storm .",
    "large cdod gradients are again observed moving towards high latitudes in tes years , but not in mcs years . outside the solsticial pause ,",
    "cross - equatorial flushing storms are likely to produce peaks of cdod in the equatorial region , which affect all longitudes ( as we have also seen in the comparison between meridiani and gusev ) .     figure  [ fig_stat_eq_allyears ]      figure  [ fig_stat_latallyears ]     as an example of how our gridded products can be used to explore the multiannual statistics of dust loading in particular regions , we consider the case of esa s exomars 2016 entry , descending and landing demostrator module ( edm `` schiaparelli '' ) .",
    "the landing is planned to take place in meridiani planum during the time window @xmath119 in my  33 , which is well inside the dust storm season .",
    "although this will provide a unique opportunity to characterize a dust - loaded atmosphere during the entry , descending , and landing procedure , it will also pose strict contraints on the engineering parameters of the landing , and increase the associated risks .",
    "it is therefore very important to produce an accurate statistical prediction of the expected range of dust loading at the time and location of the landing , based on historical records . if one plots the time series of cdod in all years in meridiani , as in fig .",
    "[ fig_stat_eq_allyears ] , but limited to the period @xmath120 , the tail of the planetary - encircling dust storm stands out with respect to all other years , which show moderate dust loading ( not shown here ) .",
    "it is worth noting that this season is characterized by the solsticial pause of the baroclinic wave activity , with associated lack of flushing storms , which in general have trajectories with potential to affect meridiani . by calculating the cumulative histogram for the landing window @xmath121 ( not shown here )",
    ", we can make the statistical prediction , based on past observations , that exomars 2016 `` schiaparelli '' lander is likely to encounter a moderate dust loading with cdod of @xmath122 ( ir absorption referred to 610 pa ) .",
    "this prediction , though , does not exclude the possibility of high dust loading induced by an equinoctial planet - encircling dust storm , which , as seen above , can be quite unpredictable even just a few sols beforehand .",
    "with the application of the iwb procedure , the maps of cdod that we obtain are incomplete and present higher spatial resolutions in my  24 , 25 , 26 than in the other years . for many practical applications",
    "it is desirable to have complete , regularly gridded maps spanning several years with the same resolution .",
    "one of such application is to prescribe realistic aerosol dust distributions for global - scale or meso - scale climate model simulations .",
    "the production of the mcd statistics using the lmd gcm , for instance , is an obvious example @xcite .",
    "other possible applications include retrieving surface or atmospheric variables ( e.g. surface albedo or atmospheric water vapor ) using observations from which the aerosol dust component needs to be subtracted . for these reasons , in this section",
    "we discuss our method to derive multiannual , regularly gridded ` dust scenarios ' from the irregularly gridded maps we have described so far .",
    "the process of producing complete gridded maps at a given resolution from maps that have missing data and different resolutions is , generally speaking , a problem of interpolation and/or extrapolation .",
    "there exist several techniques , more or less ` optimal ' , to solve this problem , as it is the case for the gridding problem .",
    "kriging ( which is synonymous with ` optimal prediction ' ) is a technique that belongs to the family of linear least squares estimation algorithms .",
    "it is a method of interpolation that predicts unknown values from data provided at known locations . unlike other common interpolation methods , such as polynomial , spline , and nearest - neighbor",
    ", kriging does not require an exact fit at each tabulated data point .",
    "another important difference of kriging and other linear estimation methods is that kriging aims to minimize the error variance of the predicted values .",
    "kriging applies a weighting to each of the tabulated data points based on spatial variance and trends among the points .",
    "weights are computed by combining calculations of the spatial structure and dependence of the data , and building a statistical model of their spatial correlation ( called ` semivariogram ' model ) .",
    "alternatively , empirical semivariograms are often approximated by theoretical model functions , the most common of which are the spherical and the exponential semivariograms ( we use the latter in this work ) .",
    "the reader can refer to @xcite for a general overview of the method . for",
    "the application of kriging to data gridding , @xcite provide an example for the case of temperature ground stations on the earth , and @xcite evaluate kriging among other methods of spatial interpolation .    given the spatial characteristics of the incomplete maps of cdod that we have obtained after gridding the observations with the iwb procedure , kriging is the interpolation method that is likely to provide the best results , producing smooth spatial variations even in cases when many missing values are present .      before applying the kriging to the maps",
    ", we have replaced some of the missing values using the following methods ( in order of application ) .    1 .   in tes , themis and mcs datasets there are gaps in data coverage that sometime extend for few sols , e.g. during mars solar conjunctions . in those cases",
    ", gridded maps are missing as well , if the gaps in data coverage are longer than 7 sols ( the maximum tw we use ) .",
    "in addition , one or two daily maps before the first missing map and after the last missing map might have very few valid grid points in longitude . when long data gaps occur , we have increased the tw up to 25 sols , in order to accumulate enough observations to bypass the data coverage gap , and we have applied the gridding procedure again with more successive iterations .",
    "this method produces a smooth time interpolation by combining the moving average and the time weighting . in the absence of alternative information , or of a dynamical model of dust transport , this is a reasonable way to interpolate maps during periods of missing data .",
    "issues of data coverage are both temporal and spatial .",
    "tes and themis datasets have few valid retrievals of cdod at high latitudes during the winter seasons , and the mcs dataset does not include estimates when the dust loading is too high ( e.g. during dust storms ) , the water ice opacity is large ( e.g. during the aphelion cloud tropical belt season ) , or the temperature at some height is below the @xmath116 condensation temperature ( e.g. during the polar nights , when @xmath116 clouds might form ) . in order to fill most of the spatial gaps in our gridded maps with climatological values , for each sol of the martian year we have used the average of all eight years , excluding from the average the largest value of cdod to eliminate single dust storms . for this climatological year ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_dodtypyear ] for a plot of its zonal mean ) , spatial inhomogeneities are smoothed out , and the optical depths that result are generally underestimated , particularly in the second half of the year . before using these 669 climatological maps to fill out gaps in the original gridded maps , therefore , we have to re - normalize the values of cdod using anchoring values from independent observations .",
    "for each sol from my  27 to 31 we can use the observations of optical depth from pancam ` spirit ' and pancam ` opportunity ' as anchoring value .",
    "we actually use the minimum between the sol - averaged observations from spirit and opportunity , after having interpolated the time series to fill any gap .",
    "the use of the minimum value avoids re - normalizing the climatological maps with values characteristic of specific dust storms located at either spirit s or opportunity s site .",
    "furthermore , it is consistent with satellite observations in northern summer ( see section  [ validation ] ) , so that we avoid biases in the re - normalization . for a given sol",
    ", we calculate the average of the climatological cdod map @xmath123 in a latitude band [ @xmath124,@xmath77 ] ( we recall that the locations of spirit and opportunity are , respectively , close to @xmath126 and @xmath127 latitude ) , and we re - normalize the values of the map using the following factor @xmath128 , weighted in latitude @xmath129 : + [ eq6 ] = r_+ ( 1- ) & if @xmath130 + r_+ ( 1 + ) & if @xmath131 + where @xmath132 is the ratio between the minimum mer dust optical depth @xmath133 ( converted to equivalent ir absorption by dividing by 2.6 ) and the calculated average @xmath123 .",
    "we replace a missing grid point in a gridded map from my  27 to 31 with a value obtained as described above , if the distance between the missing grid point and the closest valid grid point is greater than a certain threshold distance , set equal to 1000 km .",
    "the threshold avoids the introduction of possible artificial discontinuities between valid gridded values and filled values in the maps .",
    "no valid grid points exist at very high latitudes during the polar winters in tes and themis years ( my  24 to 27 ) . in order to constrain the kriging interpolation at high latitudes and at the poles , we set to 0.1 the value of the missing grid points located @xmath134 poleward of the northermost or southermost valid latitude , including the value at the poles ( when missing ) .",
    "this value , although arbitrary , is suggested as being reasonable by numerical simulations of the dust cycle in gcms , and may be revised in future updates of the dust scenarios , as new observations become available .      after replacing some missing values in the incomplete gridded maps ,",
    "the data fields are ready to be interpolated by krigging .",
    "we have used the idl built - in routine griddata for kriging interpolation on the sphere with an exponential semivariogram model .",
    "we have chosen two different grids : a low resolution grid ( @xmath135 in longitude - latitude ) , and a high resolution grid ( @xmath136 in longitude - latitude ) . at the end of the interpolation procedure , carried out for each available sol from my 24 to my 31 , we obtain complete , regularly gridded maps of ir absorption cdod at the reference pressure of 610 pa . fig .  [ fig_krigmap ] shows an example based on the same sol as in fig.[fig_tes_tw ] , kriged at high resolution .",
    " figure  [ fig_krigmap ]     the series of daily maps is divided into annual dust scenarios , with 669 sols each , instead of using the martian calendar described in [ calendar ] .",
    "the reason for this choice is that atmospheric models that use dust scenarios are often based on an integer number of sols in the year . for years with 668 sols in our sol - based martian calendar ,",
    "we add the first sol of the following year .",
    "the 669th sol of my  24 , 27 , 29 , therefore is the same as the first sol of , respectively , my  25 , 28 , and 30 .",
    "since there are no maps available for the first part of my  24 ( before sol 225 ) , we use the first 224 sols of my  25 to fill the gap , therefore creating a `` hybrid '' my  24 year .",
    "the junction at sol 225 is smoothed using a running average for the three sols before and the three sols after .",
    "it is worth mentioning that if one wants to use a scenario for a specific year in a cyclic model simulation , the first few sols and the last few sols should be averaged ( e.g. with a running average ) to avoid the discontinuity .",
    "similarly to what we do for the irregularly gridded maps , we provide an atlas of the daily dust scenario maps as supplementary material of this paper .",

    "two atlases of the current version 1.5 of the maps are also available as supplementary material of this paper .    key achievements of this work are the production and analysis of a continuous , multiannual climatology of dust based on several heterogeneous datasets , as well as the assessement of uncertainties ( both in the cdod retrievals and in the resulting gridded maps ) , and biases .",
    "eight martian years of temporal and spatial ( 2d ) dust distribution have been presented in term of interannual and intraseasonal variability , down to the daily evolution of single dust storms .",
    "we have confirmed that , from the statistical point of view , the years without global - scale storms are characterized by four phases in the solar longitude - latitude dust distribution , clearly highlighted in fig .",

    "the mcs team expects to carry out retrievals of cdod ( as additional standard product ) using nadir and off - nadir observations , which would greatly improve the quality of the dataset and reduce the biases identified in this work",
    ". the use of estimated cdods from fitting top - of - atmosphere brightness temperatures with a gcm can be another important source of information to be used in the gridding procedure , in order to increase the number of valid grid points and reduce the need for the kriging interpolation in some areas .",
    "reliable retrievals of cdod from the planetary fourier spectrometer ( pfs ) observations aboard mars express would be invaluable to improve the quality of the maps in my  27 and my  28 , when only sparse themis observations are available .",
    "the iwb procedure would be particularly adapted to grid pfs observations , which are fairly heterogeneous in local time .",
    "the use of data assimilation in a dynamical model of the dust cycle is the obvious improvement of the simple spatial kriging technique described in this work to produce complete dust scenarios , with ensemble methods providing the capability to estimate uncertainties . despite possible use of data assimilation techniques as ` optimal interpolators ' of dust observations ( or other types of aerosols and variables ,",
    "e.g. @xcite ) , gridding retrievals from satellite orbits with iwb procedure can retain its key advantages of 1 ) being easy to implement , 2 ) not requiring a model , 3 ) providing statistical estimates of uncertainties based on those of the retrievals , and 4 ) giving immediate access to statistical analysis of the spatio - temporal evolution of events .",
    "furthermore , this gridding technique could be applied to fields beyond the study of martian dust climatology , where data assimilation techniques might not be accessible or might be more difficult to implement .",

    "a particular mention is due to aymeric spiga , who always believed this paper would be finished one day , and provided time and competence during long discussion sessions .",

    "the solar longitude resets to zero by definition at the beginning of each new year ( spring equinox ) .",
    "the scientific community primarily have been using a martian calendar based on the combination of martian year and solar longitude , since data are usually averaged over a few solar longitude degrees .",
    "this combination is not satisfactory in our work , because our series of maps uses the sol as time variable .",
    "if we want to devise a martian calendar based on sols , we need to keep track of the fraction of a sol left at the end of each martian year , similarly to what is done for the earth calendar .",
    "many sol - based calendars have been proposed for mars , with different solutions for the structure of months and weeks , and for the way they deal with the leap years .",
    "we mention here only the example of the darian calendar ( first described in a paper published by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which has been proposed to serve the needs of possible future human settlers on mars .    for scientific purposes , and in the interest of simple time - keeping , we have devised for the present work our own sol - based martian calendar",
    "since there are approximately 668.6 sols in a martian year , every 5 years the number of elapsed sols is very close to the integer 3343 .",
    "it is convenient , therefore , to define cycles of 5 martian years , with a number of sols respectively of 669 , 668 , 669 , 668 , and 669 ( a total of 3343 sols ) . by doing this ,",
    "the end of each cycle is ( without approximation ) only 0.04 sol shorter than an integer number of sols , which accumulates to 1/4 of a sol after 30 martian years ( a reasonable amount for scientific purposes ) .",
    "furthermore , assuming the first sol of a year starts when it is midnight at the prime meridian ( 00:00 mut ) , if there is a time bias @xmath138 between the first sol and @xmath11 at the beginning of a 5-year cycle , there is again the same bias at the beginning of the following cycle , if we approximate the martian year with 668.6 sols .",
    "thanks to this property , the time biases between our sol - based calendar and a solar longitude - based calendar follow a repeatable pattern , and they are never too large for a reasonable number of martian years , if @xmath138 is properly set at the beginning of my  1 .",
    "@xcite proposed an arbitrary convention to numerate the martian years starting from 11th april 1955 ( my  1 ) .",
    "this date corresponds to the martian northern spring equinox preceding the planet - encircling dust storm of 1956 .",
    "this storm marks the beginning of the new period of scientific observation and exploration of the planet mars . using this convention ,",

    "we maintain the numeration of the martian year introduced by @xcite , but we have to start our my  1 at a slightly different time , because at @xmath11 in my  1 the mut time ( local mean solar time ) was 13:26 rather than 00:00 .",
    "the first sol of my  1 in our calendar starts on 11th april 1955 at 19:22 utc , when it was @xmath139 and 00:00 mut on mars , i.e. @xmath140 sol . by the beginning of my  26 ,",
    "this bias has reduced to @xmath141 , therefore the sol - based calendar we use is less than 6 hours late with respect to the calendar based on solar longitude at the spring equinox of my  26 , and less than 5 hours late at the beginning of my  31 ( i.e the beginning of the following 5-year cycle ) .",
    "this bias is satisfactory for the climatology from my  24 to my  31 , and we make the approximation that @xmath141  sol ( @xmath142 solar longitude ) for the three cycles we deal with in this paper . by doing so",
