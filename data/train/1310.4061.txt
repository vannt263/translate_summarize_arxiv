    "the quantum circuit model is a standard model of quantum computation describing the relationship between input and output by a sequence of elementary gates .",
    "this model is widely used since it is shown to be universal , and it has a good correspondence to the logic circuit of classical computation .",
    "however at the same time , there is a restriction that elementary gates have to be performed from left to right without creating any loops in the quantum circuit in the quantum circuit .",
    "thus only operations with definite causal order can be performed , whereas such a restriction may not be necessary in quantum mechanics as pointed out in @xcite .",
    "the role of causal order in quantum mechanics has been widely studied , since the existence of time - loops is allowed by the theory of general relativity .",
    "historically , this question was motivated by deutsch in @xcite , where he considered quantum computation with closed timelike curves ( ctcs ) .",
    "bennet , schumacher , and svetlichny considered a different model of ctcs @xcite , referred to as bss ctcs @xcite .",
    "others also refer the same model as p - ctcs ( closed timelike curves via quantum postselection ) @xcite , where a classical time - paradox can be resolved by considering quantum computation with ctcs .",
    "the computational power of ctcs was studied in @xcite , where a quantum circuit with deutsch - type ctcs is shown to be able to solve a computational problem belonging to the pspace class in polynomial time .",
    "quantum computation augmented with postselection is shown to have a power to to solve problems in the pp class in polynomial time @xcite .    even besides ctcs",
    ", we can consider a situation with strange causality .",
    "for example , quantum communication without causal structure is formulated in @xcite . in @xcite , an operation beyond causally ordered quantum computation",
    "called quantum switch has been investigated .",
    "quantum switch is a super - map of which input is two different single - qubit unitary gates @xmath2 and @xmath3 and output is a two - qubit controlled - unitary that coherently performs",
    "two differently ordered unitary operations @xmath1 and @xmath0 depending on the state of a control - qubit .",
    "it was proven that quantum switch can not be implemented within the quantum circuit model with a fixed causal order , if each of @xmath2 and @xmath3 is allowed to be used only once .",
    "are there any operations that can not be implemented within the causally restricted quantum circuit model but still possible in quantum mechanics ? in this paper , we show a positive result that by implementing the quantum computation adiabatically one can map the causal order of operations to a construction of hamiltonian , and that the causal order can be manipulated to implement quantum switch introduced in @xcite .",
    "to achieve this task , we analyze adiabatic gate teleportation ( agt ) , a model of quantum computation proposed by bacon and flammia @xcite . in agt ,",
    "a single - qubit gate is applied to an unknown quantum state of an input qubit and transferred to an output qubit via an intermediate qubit by adiabatically changing interactions between qubits from a fixed initial hamiltonian to a final hamiltonian determined by the gate . based on agt ,",
    "we develop parallelized adiabatic gate teleportation ( pagt ) , a scheme where consecutive gate teleportations are implemented in one adiabatic shift from the initial hamiltonian to the final hamiltonian by introducing a parallelizable _ gate hamiltonian _ implementing a single - qubit gate . in pagt ,",
    "causal order of gate operations are mapped to spatial order of interactions in the final hamiltonian .",
    "all gate hamiltonians are simultaneously applied , although the speed of adiabatic evolution should be slowed down due to decreasing energy gaps .",
    "thus pagt does not contribute to speed up performing a sequence of gate operations by parallelizing , but to eliminate the control of causal order of gate operations in the time domain . using this property",
    ", we also present the controlled - pagt scheme that performs the controlled - unitary operations implemented by quantum switch . as a special case of controlled - pagt",
