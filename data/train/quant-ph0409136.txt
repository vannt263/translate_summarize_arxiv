    "a quantum optical system utilizing trapped neutral atoms or ions for qubits is one of promising candidates for implementing a quantum computer @xcite .",
    "actually , there have been numerous theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite achievements showing the positive prospects for it .",
    "the number of qubits in such a system is , however , obviously limited by the size of the trapping structure , while one of the essential factors for a useful quantum computer is the scalability .",
    "this difficulty could be overcome by connecting partially implemented quantum computation nodes to form a quantum network .    for any unitary operation for the whole quantum network to be possible , controlled unitary operations between two nodes",
    "should be performed as well as local unitary operations at each node @xcite .",
    "there have been various ways for doing it by means of one or more ancilla qubits @xcite .",
    "the underlying idea is to use ancilla qubits to transfer the quantum information between two nodes and perform local two - qubit operations at the nodes so that the overall process in effect results in the desired global two - qubit operation .",
    "one method to accomplish the task is to shuttle ancilla qubits or a quantum node itself physically to a particular position where local interaction between an ancilla qubit and a quantum node is possible @xcite .",
    "this method , however , can not be directly applicable to neutral atom quantum computers .",
    "another method feasible for neutral atom quantum computers as well is to exploit a photon - mediated interaction between two nodes , such as in entanglement generation @xcite , quantum state transfer @xcite , and quantum teleportation @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "there have also been a scheme in which no ancilla qubit is involved @xcite .",
    "the scheme , however , uses a quantum interferometer and the complex atomic structure of several hyperfine levels instead .    in this work",
    ", we introduce a simple scheme to do a controlled unitary operation between two distant atoms .",
    "a common quantum communication setup @xcite , in which two atoms each trapped in an optical cavity directly communicate through a quantum transmission line such as an optical fiber connecting the two cavities , is considered .",
    "in contrast to earlier methods , no ancilla atomic qubit is involved in our scheme and the gate operation is done by a simple coherent process .",

    "[ fig : scheme ] . atom a and b are trapped in cavity a and b , respectively , and two cavities are connected through an optical fiber of length @xmath1 . the decay rate of the cavity is @xmath2 and the spontaneous emission rate of the atom is @xmath3 . the outside mirror , i.e.",
    ", the mirror on the side not connected to the fiber , of each cavity is assumed to be of 100% reflectivity .",
    "each solid arrow represents a transition by a classical field of rabi frequency @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) , and each dotted arrow represents a transition by a cavity mode of atom - cavity coupling rate @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "we assume the lamb - dicke limit @xcite , thus @xmath6 is assumed to be a constant .",

    "@xmath10 does not participate in the transition .",
    "the desired two qubit operation is the controlled phase shift operation , which is accomplished in three steps as the following :    @xmath11    in the first step , only the state @xmath12 is transferred to @xmath13 while other states remain unchanged .",
    "it is done with high precision by the well - known technique of adiabatic passage @xcite . for this step ,",
    "two classical fields of rabi frequency @xmath14 and @xmath15 are applied adiabatically to atom b in order . here",
    ", detuning parameter @xmath16 has to be much larger than atom - cavity coupling rate @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) for no cavity photon to be generated during the adiabatic passage process .",
    "the third step is simply the inverse of the first step , and is also achieved by adiabatic passage .",
    "the most important and nontrivial part of our scheme is the second step , in which only the state @xmath19 acquires a phase @xmath20 while other states remain unchanged . in the remainder of this paper , we concentrate on explaining the second step of operation  ( [ eq : step ] ) .    in the second step , a classical field of rabi frequency @xmath21",
