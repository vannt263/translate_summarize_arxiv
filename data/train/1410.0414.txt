    "in sharp contrast to ordinary viscous fluids , supefluids absorb energy and angular momentum from a thread moving inside the superfluid only beyond some critical velocity ( see refs.@xcite and references therein ) . for instance , a rotating potential in an atomic bose - einstein condensate is known to lead to a series of critical frequencies beyond which nucleation of quantized vortices is favourable@xcite .",
    "interestingly , when vortices are nucleated the system is driven from a state of zero to some state of finite angular momentum .",
    "thus , the time evolved wavefunction is of different geometry and topology@xcite . furthermore , much recent work has been devoted in exploring the role of fragmentation in attractive@xcite and repulsive@xcite parabolic traps in different number of dimensions .",
    "however , the connection between vortex nucleation and fragmentation and , thus , loss of coherence throughout the dynamics has just begun being explored@xcite . in this paper , by computing the fragmentation as a function of time , we numerically study the time evolution of the repulsive bose gas that is initially in a coherent , fully condensed state and stirred with a rotating potential . here and hereafter",
    ", we use the term ` condensed ' to refer to the states where all particles occupy the same single - particle state and ` fragmented ' for those that occupy macroscopically a finite number of single - particle states or orbitals . in order to explore phenomena as fragmentation",
    "one needs to go beyond the standard single - orbital mean - field approach like the gross - pitaevskii theory .",
    "a theory that allows for a good self - consistent description of fragmented states is the multiconfigurational time - dependent hartree method for bosons ( mctdhb)@xcite that is briefly discussed below . by applying the mctdhb method to a two - dimensional gas of @xmath0 repulsive ultracold bosons we demonstrate how this transition to states of different symmetry and topology , such as the quantum vortex states , are accompanied and assisted by fragmentation of the gas .",
    "we represent the solution with the many - body ansatz @xmath15 where the time - dependent functions @xmath16 form an orthonormal set of wavefunctions , each one of which represents a condensed _ or _ fragmented bose gas of @xmath17 particles .",
    "each @xmath18 is a permanent i.e. , fully symmetrized product of orbitals .",
    "the sum runs over all possible @xmath19 configurations @xmath20 of @xmath17 particles in @xmath21 orbitals .",
    "the method used to solve the time - dependent schrdinger equation is the mctdhb and has been presented in refs.@xcite .",
    "this method takes into consideration @xmath21 different single - particle states ( orbitals ) for the construction of the many - body state @xmath22 and is in principle and in practice numerically exact@xcite .",
    "the numerical package and latest recursive implementation ( r - mctdhb ) , used here to solve the corresponding equations together with a detailed description , can be found in ref.@xcite .    in the present work we attack the rotating problem with the r - mctdhb numerical package using @xmath23 orbitals and @xmath0 particles .",
    "the numerical simulations are done on a @xmath24 grid .",
    "the frequency of the trapping potential is @xmath25 .",
    "the value of the interaction strength is fixed to @xmath26 .",
    "we choose the amplitude for the gaussian rotating laser beam equal to @xmath27 and width @xmath28 .",
    "the width of the gaussian function that models the two - body interaction interaction is @xmath29 .",
    "this is well in the parameter range where the physics of the true contact interaction are emulated by a short - range gaussian , see ref.@xcite .",
    "in this section we present the main results obtained by solving the time - dependent schrdinger equation @xmath30 with the above described hamiltonian , for various stirring frequencies @xmath13 . within mctdhb",
    "we propagate the quantum state @xmath31 in real time for the potential of eq .   and @xmath32 , expressed here and hereafter in units of the confining frequency @xmath33 and calculate the total energy of the system @xmath34 .",

    "the here applied mctdhb method is a powerful tool that gives information on the fragments ( orbitals ) of the state and their dynamics .",
