    "the reduced trispectrum of density perturbations @xmath168 can be written in terms of the connected piece as @xmath169 with two terms involving @xmath170 where @xmath171 and @xmath144 is derived in the appendix of ref .",
    "@xcite .      the angular trispectrum associated with the @xmath173 term can be calculated numerically in a reasonable time , but the exact numerical calculation of the angular trispectrum of 21-cm anisotropies associated with @xmath174 term is slow . here , we outline the analytical derivation of the trispectrum associated with the @xmath173 term , but for the @xmath174 term , following an approach similar to prior calculations of the non - gaussianity associated with the trispectrum of gravitational evolution @xcite , we employ an approximation with the angular averaged value @xmath175 @xcite and ignore the exact mode coupling resulting from the @xmath176 term .",
    "this assumption allows us to write @xmath177 $ ] .",
    "compared to the derivation in section  ii where the trispectrum from primordial perturbations involve a coupling term which is momentum - independent , the derivation of the trispectrum associated with non - linear evolution with a momentum - dependent term is tedious .",
    "we take multipole moments of the @xmath178 term @xmath179 and since @xmath178 involves terms @xmath180 from @xmath181 , @xmath182 takes the values of 0,1,2 .",
    "we outline the contribution for a a specific combination of @xmath183 involving the expansion of the two @xmath178 terms , the trispectrum calculation generally involves a term of the form @xmath184 which can be simplified with rayleigh expansion of the plane waves followed by angular integrals to arrive after some tedious but straightforward algebra to @xmath185    including the exact form of the mode - coupling , we obtain the reduced angular trispectrum of 21-cm anisotropies due to second - order gravitational perturbation evolution as @xmath186\\ , , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath187    as mentioned above , the angular trispectrum with @xmath188 term involves a calculation that is numerically slow given the mode coupling resulting from a term involving @xmath189 . ] since we are considering the 3 - 1 angular power spectrum , we can ignore the exact momentum dependence of the @xmath174 non - linear gravity and take the angular averaged value of @xmath176 .",
    "the resulting trispectrum in this case takes a simple form similar to that of the primordial trispectrum with a momentum - independent coupling term , and we overestimate the covariance between primordial and non - linear gravity trispectra to the 3 - 1 angular power spectrum estimator .",
