    "as a star is evolved off the main sequence after exhaustion of hydrogen fuels in the core , it increases its radius while the surface temperature drops down , and the deep convection zone is developed , by which part of the nuclear - processed products in the core may be salvaged and mixed into the outer envelope and abundance peculiarities may be observed for some specific elements . by making use of this fact , we can study the physical process in the invisible interior of stars by comparing spectroscopically determined surface abundances with theoretical expectations from stellar evolution calculations .",
    "while considerable progress has been made so far in this field and important observational characteristics are known to be successfully explained by theoretical calculations , discrepancies between the empirically established surface abundances and the prediction from the standard theory are occasionally seen .",
    "one of such problems concerns the oxygen abundances in f ",
    "g supergiants , which is namely the disagreement between the theoretical prediction ( almost normal o ) and an apparent deficit often suggested from observations .    in the envelope of such intermediate - mass supergiants , the h - burning ( cno cycle ) products",
    "are mixed to alter the surface abundances .",
    "according to the canonical stellar evolution calculations ( e.g. , lejeune & schaerer 2001 ) , it is essentially the cn - cycled ( c@xmath10n reaction ) material that is dredged up , while the product of on - cycle ( o@xmath10n reaction ; occurring in deeper region of higher @xmath11 ) is unlikely to cause any significant abundance change because mixing is not expected to substantially penetrate into such a deep layer ; thus the predicted surface abundances are characterized by a deficit in c as well as an enhancement in n , while o is practically unaffected ( if only slightly decreased ) .    on the observational side , however , luck & lambert ( 1981 , 1985 ) reported based on the cno abundance results of fgk supergiants ( including cepheid variables ) that oxygen is mildly deficient relative to the sun by @xmath5  0.20.4  dex , while c is underabundant by @xmath5  0.21.0  dex and nitrogen is overabundant by @xmath5  0.20.8  dex ( both with a large star - to - star dispersion ) . in such a deficiency of o is real , a non - canonical deep mixing may exist that dredges the on - cycle product up into the envelope . yet",
    ", luck & lambert ( 1985 ) did not stick to this solution and discussed several possibilities ( e.g. , errors in abundance determinations , peculiarities in solar abundances , etc . ) .",
    "their tentative conclusion was that their absolute abundance determinations may not necessarily be trustworthy , pointing out that the trends of more reliable c / o ratios ( from forbidden lines ) as well as c / n ratios ( from permitted lines ) could be explained by canonical dredge - up of cn - cycled material ( though its amount may be more severe than expected ) .",
    "thus , the problem remained as an open question .",
    "meanwhile , takeda and takada - hidai published a series of papers in 1990s ( takeda & takada - hidai 1994 , 1995 , 1998 , 2000 ) , where the abundance peculiarities of supergiants in terms of na , n , o , and c were investigated by taking into account the non - lte effect , though they did not pay much attention to determination of atmospheric parameters ( appropriate values corresponding to the spectral type and the luminosity class were simply assumed ) .",
    "one of the important results they first learned was the confirmation of na enrichment ( takeda & takada - hidai 1994 ) , which is regarded as an evidence for the dredge - up of nena - cycle product ( cf .",
    "sasselov 1986 , lambert 1992 ) .",
    "since such a peculiarity in na was not expected from canonical stellar evolution calculations , it implied an instructive fact that the standard theory was not necessarily sufficient .",
    "regarding cno , takeda & takada - hidai ( 1998 ) confirmed the mild underabundance of o by @xmath12  dex , interestingly just like luck & lambert ( 1985 ) reported , along with the enrichment of n ( takeda & takada - hidai 1995 ) as well as the deficit of c ( takeda & takadai - hidai 2000 ; though only for late - b through late - a supergiants ) .",
    "but takeda & takada - hidai ( 1998 ) did not associate this result of subsolar o with non - canonical mixing of on - cycled material but attributed it to the general tendency of apparently subsolar cno observed in young stars such as b - type stars ( e.g. , nissen 1993 ) , which was generally accepted ( though puzzled ) at that time . however , an extensive non - lte study on the oxygen abundances of b - type stars in comparison with the sun recently carried out by takeda et al .",
    "( 2010 ) lead to the conclusion that b stars have almost the solar composition in terms of o without any significant difference .",
    "if so , these previous studies may point to the conclusion that o is apparently underabundant in supergiants while primordial o must have been almost normal when they were born .",
    "does this imply that oxygen abundance in the envelope of intermediate - mass stars really got decreased during the course of evolution by a non - standard deep mixing of on - cycled product ?    in the meantime ,",
    "kovtyukh & andrievsky ( 1999 ) suggested a possible key to the solution of this oxygen problem . according to them ,",
    "the atmospheric parameters adopted by previous investigations may not have been appropriate , since spectroscopically determined parameters based on fe  i and fe  ii lines tend to suffer to appreciable errors because of the non - lte overionization affect ( particularly important for stronger fe  i lines ) . as a method to alleviate this problem",
    ", they proposed to principally invoke fe  ii lines ( considered to be hardly affected by any non - lte effect ) of various strengths for determination of spectroscopic parameters while using only `` fairly weak '' fe  i lines to define the reference abundance derived from neutral fe lines ( which is to be made consistent with that from once - ionized fe lines for the requirement of ionization equilibrium ) as the weak - line limit under the assumption that very weak deep - forming fe  i lines are formed nearly in lte .",
    "they tested this method by applying it to analyzing the spectra of @xmath9 cep at seven different phases , and obtained quite consistent results between the such derived spectroscopic gravity and the physical gravity ( determined from mass and radius ) , which eventually solved the long - standing gravity - discrepancy problem in cepheids ( e.g. , luck & lambert 1985 ) .",
    "then , as an important consequence , the resulting oxygen abundance with the new parameters ( higher @xmath13 ) turned out to be nearly normal , in contrast to the case of old parameters ( lower @xmath13 ; derived by the conventional approach ) where an appreciable underabundance of oxygen was obtained .",
    "so , if their claim is correct , the oxygen problem in f ",
    "g supergiants may be nothing but an apparent effect due to an inadequate choice of atmospheric parameters ; and the `` actual '' surface cno abundances would be characterized by low c , high n , and nearly normal o , which may be reasonably explained by the theory of canonical mixing ( i.e. , essentially the dredge - up of cn - cycle product ) .",
    "motivated by the argument of kovtyukh & andrievsky ( 1999 ) , we decided to carry out an extensive spectroscopic analysis on the abundance peculiarities of c ,",
    "n , o , and na ( the key elements for studying the mixing of h - burning products ) for cepheid variables of various pulsation periods based on high - dispersion spectra taken at different phases , in order to see whether their conclusion can be generally confirmed for evolved intermediate - mass stars of diversified properties , which is the purpose of this study .",
    "the reason why we have chosen cepheids ( instead of non - variable supergiants ) is because ( 1 ) we can directly estimate the uncertainties in abundance determinations by comparing the results from spectra of different phases , and ( 2 ) the stellar parameters ( such as absolute magnitude , mass , radius , etc . )",
    "are well known in advance by making use of the period ",
    "luminosity relation .",
    "what we want to check in this investigation are the following points : +  are we able to derive reliable atmospheric parameters spectroscopically based on fe  i and fe  ii lines by the way proposed by kovtyukh & andrievsky ( 1999 ) ?",
    "can we observe an agreement between the spectroscopic gravity and the dynamical gravity ? +",
    " are the abundances derived from spectra corresponding to various phases reasonably consistent with each other ? +  what about the tendency of c ,",
    "n , o , and na abundances in view of the specific trends resulting from mixing of h - burning products ? in particular , how is the abundance of oxygen ?",
    "can we confirm that the sum of c+n+o is conserved ? +  is there any meaningful dependence in the extent of abundance peculiarities upon the stellar mass ( or luminosity directly related to the pulsation period ) , such as suggested previously ( e.g. , takeda & takada - hidai 1994 ) for the case of na ?",
    "it may be worth noting here that extensive spectroscopic studies of cepheid variables at various phases similar to ours were already conducted by andrievsky , luck & kovtyukh ( 2005 ) , luck & andrievsky ( 2004 ) , kovtyukh et al .",
    "( 2005a ) , and luck et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , for four different cepheid groups of ( i ) @xmath14 , ( ii ) @xmath15 , ( iii ) @xmath16 ( where @xmath17 is the pulsation period in day ) , and ( iv ) s - cepheids with small amplitudes , respectively , in order to study the phase - dependent variations of stellar fundamental parameters .",
    "they showed that almost consistent abundances were obtained for various elements by using the spectroscopic parameters determined based on kovtyukh & andrievsky s ( 2005 ) procedure .",
    "in contrast , we treat and discuss our targets ( including classical cepheids in a wide range of @xmath17 as well as s - cepheids ) as a whole without classifying them into subgroups ; but we particularly focus on determining the abundances of four elements ( c , n , o , and na ) as precisely as possible by carefully applying the spectrum - synthesis technique along with non - lte corrections , which is the distinction compared to their studies .    the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we describe in section 2 the observational data of the program stars ( 12 cepheid variables ) .",
    "the spectroscopic determination of atmospheric parameters corresponding to each spectrum , which uses fe  i and fe  ii lines , is explained in section 3 . in section 4 are spelled out the procedures of our abundance analysis , which are made up of lte spectrum - synthesis fitting , inverse evaluation of equivalent widths , and non - lte abundance determinations from them .",
    "the results of atmospheric parameters as well as c , n , o , and na abundances are discussed in section 5 with respect to each of the specific check points enumerated above .",
    "the conclusion is summarized in section 6 .",
    "twelve representative cepheid variables ( including five s - cepheids showing particularly small light - variation amplitude of @xmath18  mag ) were selected as our program stars , which are apparently bright ( mostly @xmath19  46  mag ) and have a wide variety of pulsation periods ( @xmath5216  days ) .",
    "the basic data of these targets are summarized in table 1 .",
    "the observations were carried out during the four nights on 2009 october 25 by using boes ( bohyunsan observatory echelle spectrograph ) attached to the 1.8 m reflector at bohyunsan optical astronomy observatory . using 2k@xmath204k ccd ( pixel size of 15  @xmath21 m  @xmath20  15  @xmath21 m ) , this echelle spectrograph enabled us to obtain spectra of wide wavelength coverage ( from @xmath5  3800  @xmath22 to @xmath5  9200  @xmath22 ) .",
    "we used 200@xmath21 m fiber corresponding to the resolving power of @xmath23 .",
    "the integration time for each exposure was from a few minutes up to @xmath5  1520  minutes depending on the brightness of a target .",
    "if adu counts attained by one exposure were not sufficient , the second ( or even third ) exposure was tried for the same star and the successive frames were co - added , though only one exposure was enough in normal cases . in any case , the integrated exposure time for each spectrum ( whichever single or co - added ) never exceeded 40 minutes , which guarantees that any serious blurring effect caused by line - profile variations is unlikely .",
    "in such a way , each of the program stars were observed several times in a night with an interval of a few hours , though the actual frequency differed from star to star .",
    "thus , as a result of 4-night observations , we could obtain a total of 122 spectra , which consist of 717 spectra per each star corresponding to different observational times .",
    "the reduction of the echelle spectra ( bias subtraction , flat fielding , spectrum extraction , wavelength calibration , and continuum normalization ) was carried out mainly with the software developed by kang et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and partly with iraf .",
    "we could accomplish sufficiently high s / n ratio of several hundred at the relevant regions for most of the spectra ( except for the last one of @xmath9  cep , for which the quality is considerably poor ) .",
    "then , the apparent stellar radial velocity was determined by comparing each spectrum in the orange region ( @xmath24  6100  @xmath22 ) with the template solar spectrum , which was further converted to the heliocentric radial velocity by applying the relevant correction evaluated with the help of iraf task `` rvcorrect . ''",
    "the fundamental information for each of the 122 spectra ( observational time in julian day , the corresponding pulsation phase @xmath25 , and the heliocentric radial velocity @xmath26 ) is presented in table 2 .",
    "the atmospheric parameters necessary for constructing model atmospheres as well as for abundance determinations [ @xmath27 ( effective temperature ) , @xmath13 ( surface gravity ) , @xmath28 ( microturbulent velocity dispersion ) , and [ fe / h ] ( metallicity , represented by the fe abundance relative to the sun ) ] were spectroscopically determined from the equivalent widths ( @xmath29 ) of fe  i and fe  ii lines , based on the conventional requirements of ( a ) excitation equilibrium ( fe abundances show no systematic dependence on the excitation potential ) , ( b ) ionization equilibrium ( mean fe abundance from fe  i lines and that from fe  ii lines agree with each other ) , and ( c ) curve - of - growth matching ( fe abundances do not systematically depend on @xmath29 ) .    practically , we used the program tgvit ( an updated version of the original program named tgv ) developed for this purpose ( takeda et al .",
    "2005 ; cf .",
    "section 3.1 therein ) , which can establish these four parameters simultaneously by numerically finding the best solution such that minimizing the dispersion function @xmath30 defined as the combination of @xmath31 ( mean fe abundance derived from fe  i lines ) , @xmath32 ( mean fe abundance derived from fe  ii lines ) , @xmath33 ( standard deviation of the fe abundances from fe  i lines ) , and @xmath34 ( standard deviation of the fe abundances from fe  ii lines ) as @xmath35 the details regarding the principle and algorithm of this method are described in takeda , ohkubo & sadakane ( 2002 ) .    regarding the observational @xmath29 data of fe lines , we could measure @xmath29 s of @xmath5  100250 fe  i lines and @xmath5  1525 fe  ii lines on each of the 122 spectra ( the number of measurable lines significantly depends on the spectral line width determined by macroscopic line broadening as well as on the s / n ratio ) , while consulting the line list ( comprising 302 fe  i lines and 28 fe  ii lines ) given in electronic table e1 of takeda et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , where gaussian fitting was adopted in most cases . in practice , avoiding the use of very strong lines showing appreciable damping wings , which are unsuitable for abundance determinations , we decided to use only those lines satisfying the condition of @xmath36  m@xmath22 , where @xmath37 is the reduced equivalent width to @xmath38  @xmath22 .",
    "we first carried out some test calculations by using the spectrum of @xmath9  cep ( 213306 - 091002a ) , in order to confirm the argument of kovtyukh & andrievsky ( 1999 ) , who suggested that fe  ii lines of various strengths can be safely used , while the mean abundance from fe  i lines should be determined based on only weak lines ( as the weak - line limit ) .",
    "namely , the following two different cases were examined concerning the input data set of @xmath29 .",
    "+  case ( a ) : + the tgvit program was applied without any specific constraint on the line strengths ( i.e. , all available fe  i and fe  ii lines satisfying @xmath36  m@xmath22 ) .",
    "then , the solutions of [ @xmath27 ( k ) , @xmath13 ( cm  s@xmath39 ) , @xmath28 ( km  s@xmath39 ) , and [ fe / h ] ( dex ) ] minimizing @xmath30 were obtained as [ 5694 , 1.88 , 3.56 , and 0.00 ] .",
    "however , the abundances from fe  i and fe  ii lines corresponding to these parameters turned out appreciably @xmath29-dependent in an opposite manner ( i.e. , fe  i  @xmath40  fe  ii abundances tend to progressively decrease  @xmath40  increase with an increase in @xmath29 ) as shown in fig .",
    "1a , which is hardly acceptable .",
    "+  case ( b ) : + next , we restricted fe  i lines to only those fairly weak ones satisfying the criterion of @xmath41  m@xmath22 , while fe  ii lines are usually used as before , in analogy with treatment suggested by kovtyukh & andrievsky ( 1999 ) .",
    "the resulting parameter solutions for this case were [ 5706 , 2.19 , 3.88 , and + 0.07 ] ; the especially notable change compared to case ( a ) is an increase of @xmath13 by @xmath5  0.3  dex .",
    "the @xmath42 vs. @xmath29 relation for this case is displayed in fig .",
    "1c , where we can satisfactorily confirm that the fe abundances do not show any systematic dependence upon @xmath29 .",
    "naturally , as recognized in the @xmath42 vs. @xmath43 plots , the abundance scatter around the mean is appreciably smaller for case ( b ) ( fig .",
    "1d ) in comparison with case ( a ) ( fig .",
    "1b ) .    given these results , which reconfirmed the consequence of kovtyukh & andrievsky ( 1999 ) , we decided to follow case ( b ) and use only the weak fe  i lines with @xmath41  m@xmath22 but all fe  ii lines with @xmath36  m@xmath22 , as the input @xmath29 data to which tgvit was applied .",
    "the number of actually used fe  i lines after this screening was @xmath5  40130 ( i.e. , almost as half as the originally measured ones ) .",
    "the finally resulting parameters ( @xmath27 , @xmath13 , @xmath28 , and [ fe / h ] ) for each of the 122 spectra are presented in table 2 .",
    "the typical statistical uncertainties involved in these solutions estimated in the manner described in section 3.2 of takeda et al .",
    "( 2002 ) are ( @xmath44  k , @xmath45  dex , @xmath46  km  s@xmath39 , and @xmath47  dex ) , respectively .",
    "the corresponding @xmath42 vs. @xmath29 and @xmath42 vs. @xmath43 plots are depicted in fig . 2 and fig.3 , respectively , where we can see that the requirements ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) are reasonably fulfilled .",
    "the detailed line - by - line data ( @xmath29 , @xmath42 ) for each stellar spectrum are also given as the electronic data tables contained in the supplementary materials ( the results for hd  ? ? ? ? ?",
    "? are presented in the file named `` ? ? ? ? ? ? _",
    "feabw.dat '' ) .",
    "regarding the choice of lines to be used for deriving the abundances of c , n , o , and na , several requirements were taken into consideration : +  from the viewpoint of mutual consistency , lines of the same type had better be used for all these elements ; so we would rely on permitted lines of neutral species .",
    "+  the strength of the line must not be too weak , so that firm detectability in the relevant parameter ranges ( @xmath48  50007000  k , @xmath49  13 ) can be guaranteed .",
    "+  on the other hand , we would like to avoid considerably strong lines , such as those very sensitive to a non - lte effect or microturbulence .",
    "+  since our analysis is based on the spectrum synthesis method , it is preferable to select a wavelength region of moderate width comprising a few lines belonging the same multiplet , so that they may be analyzed at a time .",
    "we then decided to invoke the following lines which reasonably meet these conditions : c  i  7111/7113/7115/7116/7119 lines for c , n  i  8680/8683/8686 lines for n , o  i  61558 lines for o , and na  i 6154/6161 lines for na .      abundance determinations in the first step were carried out by using our synthetic spectrum fitting code mpfit , in which the spectrum synthesis part is originally based on kurucz s ( 1993 ) width9 program .",
    "it accomplishes the best - match between the theoretical and observational spectra based on the algorithm described in takeda ( 1995 ) , by simultaneously varying the abundances of several key elements ( @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 ) , macrobroadening parameter ( @xmath53 ) , and the radial - velocity ( wavelength ) shift ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "the macrobroadening parameter ( @xmath53 ) is the @xmath55-folding width of the gaussian macrobroadening function , @xmath56 $ ] , which represents the combined effects of instrumental broadening , macroturbulence , and rotational velocity ( though it is essentially dominated by mactroturbulence in the present case ) .",
    "practically , our spectrum fitting analysis was conducted for the following three wavelength regions , where the elements whose abundances were treated as variables are enumerated in each bracket : ( i ) 61436163  @xmath22 [ o , na , si , ca , fe ] including o  i  61558 and na  i 6154/6161 lines , ( ii ) 71107121  @xmath22 [ c , fe , ni ] including c  i  7111/7113/7115/7116/7119 lines and ( iii ) 86778697  @xmath22 [ n , si , s , fe ] including n  i  8680/8683/8686 lines .    regarding the atomic data of spectral lines ( wavelengths , excitation potentials , oscillator strengths , and damping constants ) , we basically invoked the compilation of kurucz & bell ( 1995 ) .",
    "however , pre - adjustments of several @xmath57 values were necessary ( i.e. , use of empirically determined solar @xmath58 values ) for several lines in 71107121  @xmath22 region in order to accomplish a satisfactory match between the observed and theoretical spectrum .",
    "the finally adopted atomic data of important spectral lines are presented in table 2 .",
    "the atmospheric model to be used for each spectrum was generated by interpolating kurucz s ( 1993 ) grid of atlas9 model atmospheres in terms of @xmath27 , @xmath13 , and [ fe / h ] .",
    "this fitting analysis turned out quite successful and we could obtain the abundances ( especially for c , n , o , and na ) for all the 122 spectra . in case where some part of the spectrum was found to be damaged due to cosmic rays or telluric lines ( e.g. , occasionally encountered at @xmath59  @xmath22 in the 71107121  @xmath22 fitting ) , such a region was masked and excluded from the evaluation of @xmath60 evaluation .",
    "how the theoretical spectrum corresponding to the converged solutions fits well with the observed spectrum is displayed in figure 4 ( 61436163  @xmath22 fitting ) , figure 5 ( 71107121  @xmath22 fitting ) , and figure 6 ( 86778697  @xmath22 fitting ) .",
    "note that we assumed lte for all lines at this stage of synthetic spectrum - fitting .",
    "the solutions of the macrobroadening width ( @xmath53 ) derived from the 61436163  @xmath22 fitting are given in table 2 , while further work is yet to be done to establish the final abundances as described in the next section 4.3 .      despite that the synthetic spectrum fitting directly yielded the abundance solutions of c , n , o , and na ( the main purpose of this study ) , this approach is not necessarily suitable when one wants to examine how the results would be changed in different conditions ( e.g. , lte vs. non - lte , application of non - lte calculations done at different assumptions , abundance sensitivity to parameter changes , etc . ) , since it is tedious to repeat the fitting process to obtain the new solution .",
    "therefore , with the help of the modified version of kurucz s ( 1993 ) width9 program , we computed the equivalent widths for c  i lines ( @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 ) , n  i lines ( @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 ) , o  i lines ( @xmath69 ) , ) is not so much a realistic value measurable from actual spectra as rather an idealized quantity . ] and na  i lines ( @xmath70 , @xmath71 ) `` inversely '' from the abundance solutions ( resulting from spectrum synthesis ) along with the adopted atmospheric model / parameters , which are much easier to handle .",
    "based on such evaluated @xmath29 values , the lte ( @xmath72 ) as well as non - lte abundances ( @xmath73 ) were freshly computed , from which the non - lte correction ( @xmath74 ) was further derived .",
    "regarding the calculations for evaluating the non - lte departure coefficients , we followed the procedures described in takeda & takada - hidai ( 2000 ) ( for c ) , takeda & takada - hidai ( 1995 ) ( for n),takeda & takada - hidai ( 1998 ) as well as takeda et al .",

    "+  our spectroscopic gravities are almost consistent with kovtyukh & andrievsky s ( 1999 ) `` non - standard '' results , reflecting that both were derived in the same manner ( mainly based on fe  ii lines along with the limited use of only very weak fe  i lines ) , while older results using stronger fe  i lines ( e.g. , fry & carney 1997 ) tend to be appreciably lower by @xmath93  dex ( fig .",
    "this confirms the argument of kovtyukh & andrievsky ( 1999 ) that the spectroscopic @xmath13 based on the new `` non - stadard '' approach are preferable , since those old spectroscopic @xmath13 values of cepheids ( conventionally determined ) were often found to be significantly lower than the dynamical values determined from the empirically estimated mass and radius ( see , e.g. , luck & lambert 1985 ) .",
    "+  regarding the microturbulence , our @xmath28 values tend to be systematically higher by @xmath94  km  s@xmath39 in comparison with other literature results ( fig .",
    "the reason for this discrepancy is not clear , since it is observed not only in comparison with older work ( where fe  i lines were used to determine @xmath28 ) but also with the non - standard results of kovtyukh & andrievsky ( 1999 ) ( where @xmath28 was determined by fe  ii lines as in this study ) .      given that our program stars were so chosen as to cover a wide range of pulsation periods ( @xmath95  216  days ) , it is worth examining how our spectroscopically determined atmospheric parameters depend on @xmath17 , which is closely correlated with the absolute magnitude ( also with the stellar mass ) through the period  luminosity relation .",
    "20 shows all the results of @xmath27 , @xmath13 , @xmath28 , @xmath53 , and [ fe / h ] derived for each of the 12 stars , plotted against @xmath96 .",
    "we can see a clear trend of @xmath27 decreasing with an increase in @xmath96 ( fig .",
    "20a ) , which can be roughly represented by the linear relation @xmath97 ( @xmath27 is in k and @xmath17 is in days ) with an uncertainty of a few hundred k. this reflects the fact the cepheid instability strip is tilted in the theoretical @xmath98 vs. @xmath99 diagram , in the sense that higher-@xmath100 cepheids with longer @xmath17 tend to have lower @xmath27",

    "we then discuss the @xmath17-dependence of @xmath13 ( fig .",
    "the surface gravity is expressed in terms of @xmath101 , @xmath100 , and @xmath27 as @xmath102 if we use benedict et al.s ( 2007 ) period  luminosity relation for galactic cepheids ( cf .",

    "( 2 ) ) @xmath106 combining eq . ( 5 ) and",
    "( 6 ) , we get a mass  period relation as @xmath107 consequently , inserting eq . ( 2 ) , ( 5 ) , and ( 7 ) into eq .",
    "( 3 ) , we finally obtain @xmath108 as the @xmath17-dependence of dynamical @xmath13 , where we assumed @xmath109 ( actual values range from @xmath110 to @xmath3 depending on @xmath27 , but insignificant ; e.g. , flower 1996 ) .",
    "this relation is also depicted in fig .",
    "as seen from this figure , the spectroscopic @xmath13 values derived in this study tend to be systematically larger by this relation of dynamical @xmath13 , which indicates that some of the relations we assumed above may not be appropriate or some systematic error may be involved in our @xmath13 .",
    "nevertheless , considering the large dispersion of observed @xmath13 along with the incomplete phase coverage of our data , we may regard that both are in tolerable consistency , despite the discrepancy especially in short - period cepheids of @xmath111  23  days .",
    "20c and 20d suggest that @xmath28 as well as @xmath53 attain an apparent maximum at @xmath112 and turn to decrease with increasing @xmath17 , which may contradict the intuitive expectation that the atmospheric turbulence would progressively grow with a decrease of @xmath13 because of increased instability in lower - density condition .",
    "we consider , however , that this should not be taken too seriously , since the phase coverage of x  cyg ( having the longest @xmath17 of 16  days ) is insufficient and our 9 spectra for this star correspond to the expanding and decelerating phase ( @xmath25  0.20.4 ) of non - enhanced turbulence ( fig .",
    "the dispersion of [ fe / h ] for each star in fig .",
    "20e suggests that the precision of its determination for a spectrum at a given phase ( as a by - product of atmospheric parameter determination based on fe  i and fe  ii lines ) is on the order of @xmath45  dex , though with rather large star - to - star differences ( e.g. , the reason for the appreciably larger [ fe / h ] dispersion in s  sge is because our data correspond to @xmath113  0.71.1 , where the spectral variation is rapid and the analysis is comparatively more difficult ) .",
    "overall , these [ fe / h ] values scatter around @xmath114 without any systematic dependence of [ fe / h ] upon @xmath17 , which means that all the program stars have almost the solar metallicity irrespective of the absolute magnitude and the mass .",
    "somewhat unexpectedly , such @xmath17-independent chemical homogeneity ( i.e. , small star - to - star abundance dispersion ) was found also for the other elements . by averaging the [ x / h]@xmath115 results for each individual spectrum @xmath81",
    ", we computed the mean abundance @xmath116[x / h]@xmath117 and the standard deviation @xmath118 for each of the 12 stars ( x = c , n , o , na , and fe ) , which are given in table 2 ( expressed in _ italic _ at the first line of each star s section ) .",
    "these @xmath116[c / h]@xmath117 , @xmath116[n / h]@xmath117 , @xmath116[o / h]@xmath117 , @xmath116[na / h]@xmath117 , and @xmath116[fe / h]@xmath117 for each star are plotted against @xmath96 in fig .",
    "21a  e , where the extents of relevant @xmath119 are shown as error bars .",
    "these figures demonstrate that none of these @xmath116[x / h]@xmath117s show any significant @xmath17-dependence , which are practically homogeneous within a dispersion of @xmath2  0.10.2  dex .",
    "we may thus conclude @xmath116[c / h]@xmath117  @xmath4 , @xmath116[n / h]@xmath117  @xmath5  + 0.30.4 , @xmath116[o / h]@xmath117  @xmath114 , @xmath116[na / h]@xmath117  @xmath6 , and @xmath116[fe / h]@xmath117  @xmath114 as the abundance characteristics for these elements , which hold for all the program stars regardless of @xmath96 .",
    "we note that these values are almost consistent with the recent extensive studies for various cepheid variables ( andrievsky et al .",
    "2005 ; luck & andrievsky 2004 ; kovtyukh et al .",
    "2005a ; luck et al .",
    "2008 ) , where we can see that their c , n , o , and na abundances are almost the @xmath17-independent with the means ( and the standard deviations ) of @xmath116[c / h]@xmath120 ( @xmath121 ; 38 stars excluding sv  mon showing an exceptionally large deficiency of @xmath122 ) , @xmath116[n / h]@xmath123 ( @xmath124 ; 6 stars ) , @xmath116[o / h]@xmath125 ( @xmath126 ; 38 stars ) , and @xmath116[na / h]@xmath127 ( @xmath128 ; 39 stars ) .",
    "now , since the abundances of key elements have been established , we can discuss the main problem which motivated this investigation ( cf .",
    "section 1 ) : the nature of envelope mixing inferred from the characteristics of c , n , o , and na abundances .    according to the results derived in section 5.2 , c is mildly deficient by @xmath12  dex , n is appreciably enhanced by @xmath5  0.30.4  dex , na is moderately overabundant by @xmath129  dex , while o ( as well as fe ) is practically solar without any significant peculiarity ( within an uncertainty of @xmath5  0.1  dex ) .",
    "this tendency can be visually confirmed in fig .",
    "22a and fig . 22b , where @xmath116[n / h]@xmath117 vs. @xmath116[c / h]@xmath117 and @xmath116[na / h]@xmath117 vs. @xmath116[o / h]@xmath117 correlations are plotted , respectively .    regarding the oxygen problem to be clarified in the first place",
    ", we can confidently state that any significant mixing of on - cycle product has not taken place in the envelope of cepheid variables .",
    "this means that the result of apparently subsolar [ o / h ] derived by luck & lambert ( 1985 ) is most likely due to the use of inappropriate atmospheric parameters ( especially too low @xmath13 ) , as suggested by kovtyukh & andrievsky ( 1999 ) .",
    "then , the abundance peculiarities of c and n must have been caused mainly by the dredge - up of cn - cycle product .",
    "the weak anti - correlation between the c and n abundances implied from fig .",
    "22a is qualitatively consistent with this scenario .    in order to check this quantitatively , the cno abundances ( @xmath82 ) of our program stars",
    "are plotted in the @xmath130(n)@xmath117 vs. @xmath130(c+o)@xmath117 diagram and the @xmath130(n)@xmath117 vs. @xmath130(c)@xmath117 diagram in fig .",
    "22c and fig .",
    "22d , respectively , where the expected relations under the condition that @xmath131(c+n+o ) is conserved are also drawn .",
    "further , the resulting sums of @xmath82(c+n+o ) evaluated for the program stars are plotted against @xmath96 in fig .",
    "we can confirm that the observed abundances are almost on the expected curve in fig .",
    "22c ( compare this figure with fig .",
    "1 of luck & lambert 1985 ) , and that @xmath82(c+n+o ) is almost conserved at the solar value ( fig .",
    ".    it should be remarked , however , that we can not rule out the possibility of only a slight underabundance in o caused by the dredge - up of some ( not significant ) on - cycle product .",
    "actually , fig .",
    "22d implies that @xmath82(n ) vs. @xmath82(c ) correlation can not necessarily be well described only by the conservation conditions of @xmath82(c+n )  =  @xmath86(c+n ) and @xmath82(o )  =  @xmath86(o ) for stars of @xmath82(n)@xmath132 .",
    "rather , it is more reasonable to consider that a mixing of some on - cycled material could have caused a slight o - deficiency by several hundredths dex ( within @xmath92  dex ) in order to explain the @xmath82(n ) values of these stars ( fig .",
    "finally , our results of moderate enhancement of na by @xmath129  dex indicate that the nena - cycle product is dredged - up in the envelope of cepheid variables .",
    "takeda & takada - hidai ( 1994 ) derived [ na / h ] = + 0.15 ( @xmath8  aql ) and [ na / h ] = @xmath133 ( @xmath7  gem ) based on their non - lte analysis of the na  i 8194.12 line . comparing these with the present results of + 0.16 ( @xmath8  aql ) and + 0.23 ( @xmath7  gem )",
    ", we can see an appreciable discrepancy for the latter .",
    "however , their old analysis should be regarded as less reliable , where the atmospheric parameters corresponding to the observed phase were not properly determined but roughly assumed while consulting the literature values .      before",
    "starting this investigation , we anticipated that a significantly large abundance scatter may be found at least for c and n ( or possibly also for o ) , as reported in the pioneering work by luck & lambert ( 1985 ; cf .",
    "fig . 1 or fig . 9 therein ) ,",
    "and that such a diversity ( if exists ) might be correlated with @xmath17 ( or equivalently , the stellar mass @xmath101 ) . however , the considerably small star - to - star dispersion in the abundances of all elements ( c , n , o , na , fe ) was rather an unexpected result .",
    "though , admittedly , a weak anti - correlation between n and c abundances ( fig .",
    "22a , fig .",
    "22d ) suggests that the extent of dredged - up material mixed in envelope may differ slightly from star to star , it does not appear to have anything to do with @xmath101 , since [ n / c ] does not show any systematic dependence upon @xmath17 ( fig .",
    "so , another important outcome of this study is the confirmation that the extent of mixing in the envelope of cepheid variables does not depend upon the stellar mass .",
    "interestingly , essentially the same conclusion was reached by kovtyukh , wallerstein & andrievsky ( 2005b ) , who carried out an extensive spectroscopic abundance study for 16 distant cepheids with a wide range of @xmath17 ( @xmath5  327  days ) and found that neither [ c / n ] ( @xmath134 ) nor [ na / fe ] ( @xmath6 ) show any systematic dependence upon @xmath96 , which is quite consistent with our results .",
    "we should note , however , that this consequence is guaranteed only for the pulsation variables within the cepheid instability strip , which should not be simply extended to non - variable supergiants or giants in different parameter ranges ( e.g. , in terms of @xmath27 or @xmath101 ) .",
    "for example , we can not say much about the argument of takeda & takada - hidai ( 1994 ) ( na tends to be more enriched with an increase of mass for supergiants of @xmath5  1025  @xmath135 ; cf . fig . 7 therein ) , since the mass range of the program stars in this study is between @xmath136 and @xmath137 according to eq .",
    "( 7 ) , and their sample was mostly non - variable supergiants .",
    "similarly , the systematic @xmath13-dependence of [ na / h ] concluded by andrievsky et al .",
    "( 2002 ) was mainly due to supergiants ( not cepheids ) of @xmath138 ( cf .",
    "their fig .",
    "1 ) , which is again less relevant to this study . besides , smiljanic et al . ( 2006 ) concluded based on their cno abundance study for 19 non - variable supergiants covering a rather large range of stellar parameters ( 4100  k @xmath139 7500  k , 0.8 @xmath140 2.5 , 2 @xmath141 13 ) that the [ n / c ] ratios tend to increase with @xmath101 and have considerably larger values ( up to @xmath142 ) than the theoretical expectation .",
    "further , takeda , sato & murata ( 2008 ) reported in their analysis of 322 late - g and early - k giants ( 4500  k @xmath139 5500  k , 1.5 @xmath140 3.5 , 1 @xmath141 5 ) that [ c / fe ] , [ o / fe ] , and [ na / fe ] show subsolar , subsolar , and supersolar tendency , respectively , with the degree of peculiarity increasing with @xmath101 ( cf .",
    "12 therein ) , which may imply that a mass - dependent dredge - up of cn - cycle , on - cycle , and nena - cycle products may take place in the envelope of red giants .    consequently",
    ", we would still consider it quite possible that the mixing - induced abundance peculiarities of non - variable intermediate - mass evolved stars in general are significantly diversified and may depend on @xmath101 .",
    "if so , we would have to find a reasonable answer to the question `` why the absence of large star - to - star dispersion or of @xmath101-dependence in the evolution - induced mixing is limited only to cepheid variables ? '' , to which contributions by theoreticians are desirably awaited .",
    "the mixing in the envelope of intermediate - mass f ",
    "g supergiants causing surface abundance peculiarities by the dredge - up of h - burning products is not yet well understood . especially , regarding oxygen , whether or not its anomaly exists due to non - canonical dredge - up of on - cycled material is still controversial .    in order to clarify this situation",
    ", we conducted an extensive spectroscopic study for selected 12 cepheid variables of various pulsation periods ( @xmath0  216  days ) , and determined the photospheric abundances of c , n , o , and na , which are the key elements for investigating the dredge - up of h - burning products from the interior , based on 122 high - dispersion spectra ( @xmath1 spectra of different phases per target ) of wide wavelength coverage collected at bohyunsan astronomical observatory .    the atmospheric parameters ( @xmath27 , @xmath13 , @xmath28 , and [ fe / h ] ) corresponding to each phase were determined spectroscopically from the equivalent widths of fe  i and fe  ii lines by the requirements of excitation equilibrium , ionization equilibrium , and curve - of - growth matching . practically , we applied takeda et al.s ( 2005 ) tgvit program , while using only fairly weak fe  ilines ( @xmath143  m@xmath22 ) as suggested by kovtyukh & andrievsky ( 1999 ) to avoid non - lte - sensitive stronger fe  i lines .",
    "the resulting parameters as well as the radial velocities were confirmed to show the well - known phase - dependent characteristics of cepheids .",
    "the abundances of c , n , o , and na were derived by applying the spectrum - synthesis fitting technique to three wavelength regions ( 61436163  @xmath22 , 71107121  @xmath22 , and 86778697  @xmath22 ) comprising c  i 7111/7113/7115/7116/7119 , o  i 61558 , n  i 8680/8683/8686 , and na  i 6154/6161 lines . then , from the equivalent widths inversely computed from the fitting - based abundances , the final abundances were obtained by taking into account the non - lte effect .",
    "the resulting abundances of these elements for 12 program stars turned out to show remarkably small star - to - star dispersions ( @xmath2  0.10.2  dex ) without any significant dependence upon the pulsation period : near - solar fe ( [ fe / h ]  @xmath3 ) , moderately underabundant c ( [ c / h ]  @xmath4 ) , appreciably overabundant n ( [ n / h ]  @xmath5  + 0.40.5 ) , and mildly supersolar na ( [ na / h ]  @xmath6 ) . based on these results ,",
    "we conclude as follows .",
    "+  ( 1 ) these cno abundance trends can be interpreted mainly as due to the canonical dredge - up of cn - cycled material , while the significant non - canonical deep mixing of on - cycled gas is ruled out ( though only a slight mixing may still be possible ) .",
    "+  ( 2 ) the mild but definite overabundance of na suggests that the nena - cycle product is also dredged up .",
    "+  ( 3 ) the extent of mixing - induced peculiarities in the envelope of cepheid variables is almost independent on @xmath144 as well as on @xmath101 .",
    "however , given the observational suggestion that a significant diversity or a tendency of @xmath101-dependence exists in the c , n , o , and na abundances of non - variable supergiants / giants of other types , the problem of `` why such a homogeneity in the surface abundances is limited only to cepheids '' is yet to be investigated further .",
