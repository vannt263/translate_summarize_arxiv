    "population - wide information cascades are rare events , initially triggered by a single seed or a small number of initiators , in which rumors , fads or political positions are adopted by a large fraction of an informed community . in recent years",
    ", some theoretical approaches have explored the topological conditions under which system - wide avalanches are possible @xcite ; whereas others have proposed threshold @xcite , rumor- @xcite or epidemic - like @xcite dynamics to model such phenomena . beyond these efforts , digitally - mediated communication in the era of the web 2.0 has enabled researchers to peek into actual information cascades arising in a variety of platforms blogs and online social networks ( osns ) mainly , but not exclusively @xcite .",
    "notably , these latter empirical works deal with a wide variety of situations .",
    "first , the online platforms under analyses are not the same .",
    "indeed , we find research focused on distinct social networks such as facebook @xcite , twitter @xcite , flickr @xcite , digg @xcite or the blogospehere @xcite which build in several types of user - user interactions to satisfy the need for different levels of engagement between users . as a consequence , although scholars make use of a mostly common terminology ( `` seed '' , `` diffusion tree '' , `` adopter '' , etc . ) and most analyses are based on similar descriptors ( size distributions , identification of influential nodes , etc ) , their operationalization of a cascade i.e .",
    ", how a cascade is defined largely varies .",
    "this fact is perfectly coherent , because how information flows differs from one context to another .",
    "furthermore , even _ within _ the same osn different definitions may be found ( compare for instance @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "such myriad of possibilities is not necessarily controversial : it merely reflects a rich , complex phenomenology . and",
    "yet it places weighty constraints when it comes to generalize some results .",
    "the study of information cascades easily evokes that of influence diffusion patterns , which in turn has obvious practical relevance in terms of enhancing the reach of a message ( i.e. marketing ) or for prevention and preparedness . in these applications",
    "a unique definition would be highly desirable , as proposed in classical communication theory @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the profusion of descriptions and the plurality of collective attention patterns @xcite hinder some further work aimed to confirm , extend and seek commonalities among previous findings .    in this work we capitalize on a type of cascade definition which pivots on time constraints rather than `` content chains '' .",
    "despite the aforementioned heterogeneity , all but one @xcite empirical works on cascades revolve exclusively around information forwarding : the basic criterion to include a node @xmath0 in a diffusion tree is to guarantee that ( a ) the node @xmath0 sends out a piece of information at time @xmath1 ; ( b ) such piece of information was received from a friend @xmath2 who had previously sent it out , at time @xmath3 ; and finally ( c ) @xmath0 and @xmath2 became friends at @xmath4 , before @xmath0 received the piece of information ( the notion of `` friend '' changes from osn to osn , and must be understood broadly here ) .",
    "note that no strict time restriction exists besides the fact that @xmath5 , the emphasis is placed on whether the _ same _ content is flowing .",
    "this work instead turns to topic - specific data in which it is safely assumed that content is similar , and the inclusion in a cascade depends not on the repetition of a message but rather on the engagement in a `` conversation '' about a matter .    beyond our conceptualization of a cascade , this work seeks first to test the robustness of previous findings in different social contexts @xcite , and then moves on towards a better understanding of how deep and fast do cascades grow .",
    "the former implies reproducing some general outcomes regarding cascade size distributions , and how such cascades scale as a function of the initial node s position in the network .",
    "the latter aims at digging into cascades , to obtain information about their temporal and topological hidden patterns .",
    "this effort includes questions such as the duration and depth of cascades , or the relation between community structure and cascade s outreach .",
    "our methodology allows to prove the existence of a subtle class of reputed nodes , which we identify as `` hidden influentials '' after @xcite , who have a major role when it comes to spawn system - wide phenomena .",
    "our data comprises a set of messages publicly exchanged through _ www.twitter.com _ from the @xmath6 of march , 2011 , to the @xmath7 of march , 2012 .",
    "the whole sample of messages was filtered by the spanish start - up company _ cierzo development _ , restricting them to those that contained at least one of 20 preselected hashtags ( see table 1 ) .",
    "these hashtags correspond to distinct topics , thus we obtained different subsets to which we assign a generic tag .",
    "we present the results for two of these subsets .",
    "one sample consists of 1,188,946 tweets and is related to the spanish grassroots movement popularly known as `` 15 m '' , after the events on the 15th of may , 2011 .",
    "this movement has however endured over time , and in this work we will refer to it as _",
    "grassroots_. messages were generated by 115,459 unique users .",
    "on the other hand , 606,645 filtered tweets referred to the topic `` spanish elections '' , which were celebrated on the third week of november , 2011 .",
    "this sample was generated by 84,386 unique users .    using the twitter api we queried for the list of followers for each of the users , discarding those who did not show outgoing activity during the period under consideration . in this way , for each data set , we obtain an unweighted directed network in which each node represents an active user ( regarding a particular topic ) . a link from user @xmath0 to user @xmath2",
    "is established if @xmath2 follows @xmath0 . therefore , out - degree ( @xmath8 ) represents the number of followers a node has , whereas in - degree ( @xmath9 ) stands for its number of friends , i.e. , the number of users it follows .",
    "the link direction reflects the fact that a tweet posted by @xmath0 is ( instantaneously ) received by @xmath2 , indicating the direction in which information flows .",
    "although the set of links may vary in the scale of months we take the network structure as completely static , considering the topology at the moment of the scrap .",
    "twitter is most often _ exclusively _ defined as a microblogging service , emphasizing its broadcasting nature .",
    "such definition overlooks however other facets , such as the use of twitter to interact with others , in terms of _ conversations _ @xcite or _",
    "collaboration _ , for instance connecting groups of people in critical situations @xcite .",
    "_ addressivity _ accentuates these alternative features @xcite .",
    "moreover , observed patterns of link ( follower relation ) reciprocity @xcite ( see table 2 ) hint further the use of twitter as an instant messaging system , in which different pieces of information around a topic may be circulating ( typically over short time spans ) in many - to - many interactions , along direct or indirect information pathways @xcite .",
    "it is precisely in this type of interactions where the definition of a time - constrained cascade is a useful tool to uncover how and how often users get involved in sequential message interchange , in which the strict repetition of contents is not necessary ( possibly not even frequent ) .",
    "a time - constrained cascade , starting at a _ seed _ at time @xmath10 , occurs whenever some of those who `` hear '' the piece of information react to it including replying or forwarding it within a prescribed time frame @xmath11 $ ] , thereby becoming _",
    "spreaders_. the cascade can live further if , in turn , reactions show up in @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and so on . since messages in twitter are instantly broadcasted to the set of users following the source , we define listener cascades as those including both active ( spreader ) and passive participants . in considering",
    "so we account for the upper bound of awareness over a certain conversation in the whole population ( see figure  [ fig1 ] for illustration ) .",
    "admittedly , our conceptualization does not control for exogenous factors which may be occurring at the onset and during cascades .",
    "this being so , ours is a comprehensive account of information cascades .     to @xmath2",
    "indicates that @xmath2 follows @xmath0 , as any tweet posted by @xmath0 is automatically received by @xmath2 .",
    "red nodes are those who posted a new message at the corresponding time , whereas gray nodes only _ listened _ to their friends .",
    "in this particular example , user @xmath14 acts as the initial seed , emitting a message at time @xmath15 which is instantaneously sent to its nearest neighbors , laying on the first dashed circle , who are counted as part of the cascade . some of them ( nodes @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) decide to participate at the following time step , @xmath20 , posting a new message and becoming intermediate spreaders of the cascade . if any of their followers show activity at @xmath21 the process continues and the cascade grows in size as new users listen to the message .",
    "the process finally ends when no additional users showed activity ( as it happens in the cases of users @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) , or when an intermediate spreader does not have any followers ( users @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) . ]",
    "we apply the latter definition @xcite to explore the occurrence of listener cascades in the `` grassroots '' and `` elections '' data . in practice , we take a seed message posted by @xmath25 at time @xmath10 and include all of @xmath25 followers in the diffusion tree hanging from @xmath25 .",
    "we then check whether any of these listeners showed some activity at time @xmath26 , increasing the depth of the tree .",
    "this is done recursively , the tree s growth ends when no other follower shows activity .",
    "passive listeners constitute the set of leaves in the tree . in our scheme",
    ", a node can only belong to one cascade ( but could participate in it multiple times ) ; the mentioned restriction may introduce measurement biases .",
    "namely , two nodes sharing a follower may show simultaneous activity , but their follower can only be counted in one or the other cascade ( with possible consequences regarding cascade size distributions or depth in the diffusion tree ) . to minimize this degeneration",
    ", we perform calculations for many possible cascade configurations , randomizing the way we process data .    in the next sections we report some results for the aforementioned data subsets ( `` grassroots '' , `` elections '' ) considering all their time span ( over one year ) .",
    "our results have been obtained for @xmath27 hours .",
    "previous works @xcite acknowledge the robustness of cascade statistics for @xmath28 ; also , a 24-hour window may be regarded as an inclusive bound of the popularity of a piece of information over time on different osns , including twitter @xcite .      the identification of modules in complex networks has attracted much attention of the scientific community in the last years , and social networks posit a prominent example .",
    "a modular view of a network offers a coarse - grained perspective in which nodes are classified in subsets on the basis of their topological position and , in particular , the density of connections between and within groups . in osns",
    ", this classification usually overlaps with node attribute data , like gender , geographical proximity or ideology @xcite .    to detect statistically significant clusters we rely on the concept of modularity @xmath29 @xcite : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the number of links in the network ; @xmath32 is 1 if there is a link from node @xmath0 to @xmath2 and 0 otherwise ; @xmath33 is the connectivity ( degree ) of node @xmath0 ; and finally the kronecker delta function @xmath34 takes the value 1 if nodes @xmath0 and @xmath2 are classified in the same community and 0 otherwise . summarizing",
    ", @xmath29 quantifies how far a certain partition is from a random counterpart ( null model )",
    ".    from the definition of @xmath29 , algorithms and heuristics to optimize modularity have appeared ever faster and with an increased degree of accuracy @xcite .",
    "all these efforts have led to a considerable success regarding the quality of detected community structure in networks , and thus a more complete topological knowledge at this level has been attained . in this work we present results for communities detected from the walktrap method @xcite in which a fair balance between accuracy and efficiency is sought .",
    "the algorithm exploits random walk dynamics . the basic idea behind them is that a random walker tends to get trapped in densely connected parts of the graph , which correspond to communities .",
    "pons and latapy s proposal is particularly efficient because , as @xmath29 is increasingly optimized , vertices are merged into a coarse - grained structure , reducing the computational cost of the dynamics .",
    "the resulting clusters at each stage of the algorithm are aggregated , and the process is repeated iteratively .",
    "one of the most useful applications of community analyses is a better understanding of the position of a node @xcite . in terms of information diffusion and much like in @xcite we explore whether community structure ( and in particular , the relation of a seed node with the module it belongs to ) has an impact on a cascade s success .",
    "to do so we adopt the node descriptors proposed by guimer _",
    "_ in @xcite : the @xmath35 of the internal degree of each node in its module , and the participation coefficient of a node @xmath0 ( @xmath36 ) defined as how the node is positioned in its own module and with respect to other modules .",
    "the _ within - module degree _ and the _ participation coefficient _ are easily computed once the modules of a network are known . if @xmath37 is the number of links of node @xmath0 to other nodes in its module @xmath38 , @xmath39 is the average of @xmath40 over all the nodes in @xmath41 , and @xmath42 is the standard deviation of @xmath40 in @xmath38 , then @xmath43 is the so - called _ z - score_.    the participation coefficient @xmath44 of node @xmath0 is defined as : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the number of links of node @xmath0 to nodes in module @xmath25 , and @xmath47 is the total degree of node @xmath0 .",
    "note that the participation coefficient @xmath44 has a maximum at @xmath48 , when the @xmath0 s links are uniformly distributed among all the modules ( @xmath49 ) , while it is 0 if all its links are within its own module .",
    "those nodes that deviate largely from average internal connectivity are local hubs , whereas large values of @xmath44 stands for connector nodes bridging together different modules .",
    "as a starting point , we test the robustness of the results partially presented in @xcite , and further explored in @xcite .",
    "results shown in figure  [ fig2 ] confirm these findings .",
    "the upper panels show that the size of time - constrained cascades are distributed in a highly heterogeneous manner , with only a small fraction of all cascades reaching system - wide proportions .",
    "this is also in good agreement with most preceding works , that have also found that large cascades occur only rarely . on the other hand , when cascades are grouped together such that the reported size corresponds to an average over topological classes , we find that both the degree @xmath50 ( middle panels ) and coreness ( @xmath50-core , lower panels ) of nodes correlate positively with cascades sizes .",
    "some theoretical approaches predict similar behavior @xcite .    .",
    "lower panels : spreading capability grouped by the @xmath50-core of the initial spreader . for the sake of comparison , @xmath50 and @xmath50-core",
    "have been rescaled by their corresponding maxima . ]",
    "the next step to gain insights into the general overview above is to characterize how deep both temporally and structurally a cascade unfolds .",
    "we defined the _",
    "topological penetration _",
    ", @xmath51 of a cascade as the shortest path between the seed of the cascade and the farthest node involved in the cascade .",
    "the results shown in figure  [ fig3 ] ( upper and middle panels ) give quantitative support to a well - known fact : most cascades actually die with one single spreader ( instantaneous cascades ) , which corresponds to a shallow tree though it may be quite wide @xcite . in this most frequent case ,",
    "the cascade of listeners simply accounts for the out - degree @xmath8 of the seed node .",
    "additionally , the bulk of cascades penetrates up to @xmath52 or @xmath53 , both for `` grassroots '' and `` elections '' , which is in the range of the average path length , but fairly below the upper bound , which is set by the network s diameter ( 10 and 9 respectively ; see table 2 ) .",
    "interestingly , as shown in the figure , when a cascade moves beyond the average path length between the initial node and any node on the network , namely , to nodes distant @xmath54 , a large fraction of the population will likely be engaged in a cascade that will reach system - wide sizes with high probability .",
    "is the largest shortest path length between the initial seed and any node involved in the same cascade , where as @xmath55 refers to the cascades lifetimes .",
    "middle panels : box - plots for topological penetration .",
    "lower panels : box - plots for temporal penetration .",
    "cascades spreading success grows with time , and some exceptional conversations can last for months ( note the broken axis ) . ]",
    "temporal patterns , as given by the lifetime @xmath55 of a cascade , follow similar trends : most cascades die out after 24 hours , which closely resembles previously reported results @xcite . however , in figure  [ fig3 ] ( upper panels ) we observe a richer distribution ( compared to topological penetration ) such that cascades may last over 100 days , suggesting that the survival of a conversation does not exhibit an obvious pattern .",
    "again , this result confirms from a different point of view empirical results published elsewhere @xcite .",
    "finally , temporal penetration illustrates the fact that a node may participate multiple times in a single cascade although it is counted just once .",
    "this is implicit in the definition of a time - constrained cascade , placing it closer to neuronal dynamics and spike - trains which comprehend self - sustained activity and deviating it from classical modeling approaches such as rumor spreading dynamics , where multiple exposures to the rumor end up in ceasing its dissemination . in any case ,",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] ( lower panels ) illustrates that survival can not guarantee system - wide cascades , although an increasing pattern is observed as survival time grows .      up to now we have related a cascade s size to certain features of the seed node .",
    "although we observe a clear positively correlated pattern ( the larger the seed s descriptor , the larger the resulting cascade ) , one might fairly argue that a wide range of values below the maximum produces a similar outcome .",
    "so , for instance , seeds in the range @xmath56 ( figure  [ fig2 ] ) can sometimes trigger large cascades ; the same can be said for @xmath57 .",
    "this finding prompts us to hypothesize that the success of an activity cascade might greatly depend on intermediate spreaders characteristics , and not only on the properties of the seed nodes .",
    "that being so , a large seed @xmath8 ( i.e. its follower set ) may be a sufficient but not a necessary condition for the generation of large - scale cascades . in this section",
    "we explore how the average connectivity of the train of spreaders involved in a cascade affects its final size .    .",
    "non - instantaneous cascades are displayed , where the initial seed and its inactive listeners have been removed in order to dismiss the effect of the initial seed on the cascade size .",
    "there is a clear correlation between both magnitudes , although some unexpected behavior shows up : the existence of cascades containing `` hidden spreaders '' , users who are capable of generating large cascades despite not having hub - like connectivity . in both panels",
    "the function @xmath58 is drawn as a reference . ]    to study the role of intermediate spreaders we split our results , distinguishing instantaneous cascades ( those with a unique spreader ) from those with multiple spreaders .",
    "the former merely underlines the fact that the seed s @xmath8 suffices to observe large cascades .",
    "the latter , more interestingly , unveils a new character in the play : _ hidden influentials _",
    ", relatively smaller ( in terms of connectivity ) nodes who , on the aggregate , can make chain reactions turn into global cascades .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] reveals these special users : note that the largest effects are obtained for those spreaders who , on average , have @xmath59 to @xmath60 neighbors ( both for `` grassroots '' and `` elections '' ) .",
    "these nodes do not occupy key topological positions that would _ a priori _ identify them as influential , and yet they play a major role promoting system - wide events @xcite . therefore , getting these nodes involved has a multiplicative impact on the size of the cascades .    to quantify such effect",
    ", we introduce the _ multiplicative number _ of a given node @xmath0 , @xmath61 ( in analogy with the basic reproductive number in disease spreading ) , which is the quotient of the number of listeners reached one time step after @xmath0 showed activity , @xmath62 , and the number of @xmath0 s nearest listeners , i.e. , those who instantaneously received its message , @xmath63 ( which is given by the number of followers of @xmath0 that are involved in the cascade ) .",
    "thus , the ratio @xmath61 measures the multiplicative capacity of a node : @xmath64 indicates that a user has been able to increase the number of listeners who received the message beyond its immediate followers .",
    "figure  [ fig5 ] shows how @xmath61 is distributed as a function of @xmath8 .",
    "top panels represent the proportion of nodes with @xmath64 and @xmath65 per degree class . in this case",
    ", normalization takes into account all possible @xmath8 and all @xmath61 ( above and below 1 ) counts , so as to evidence that in most cases cascades become progressively shrunk as they advance .",
    "the fact that the area corresponding to the region @xmath64 is much smaller than that for @xmath65 tells us that most cascades are small , which is consistent with the reported cascades size distribution .",
    "on the other hand , bottom panels in figure  [ fig5 ] focus on the same quantity , but in this case we represent the probability @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) that a node of out - degree @xmath8 has ( does not have ) a multiplicative effect .",
    "as before , the results indicate that , in both datasets , the most - efficient spreaders ( those with a multiplicative number larger than one ) can be found most often in the degree classes ranging from @xmath68 to @xmath69 , i.e. , significantly below @xmath70 ( see table 2 ) .",
    "these nodes are the actual responsible that cascades go global and must be engaged if one would like to increase the likelihood of generating system - wide cascades .     for both datasets as indicated . as one can see , most of the time @xmath65 , which reflects the rare occurrence of large cascades .",
    "the bottom panels instead represent the probabilities , @xmath71 ( above 0 baseline ) and @xmath72 ( below it ) that a node of out - degree @xmath8 has or does not have a multiplicative effect , respectively .",
    "see the text for further details . ]",
    "the previous features of hidden influentials poses some doubts about what is the actual role of hubs in cascades that are not initiated by them .",
    "interestingly , we next provide quantitative evidences that , in contrast to what is commonly assumed , hubs often act as cascade firewalls rather than spawners . to this end",
    "we have measured @xmath73 ( average nearest neighbors degree ) with respect to seed nodes . each point in figure  [ fig6 ] represents the relationship between cascade size and @xmath73 .",
    "the initial trend is clear and expected : the larger is the average degree of the seed s neighbors , the deeper the tree grows .",
    "however , at some point this pattern changes and indicate that cascades may die out when they encounter a hub , more often than not .",
    "if this were not the case , one would observe a monotonically increasing dependence with @xmath73 .",
    "this counterintuitive hub - effect is mirrored in classical rumor dynamics @xcite and can be explained scrutinizing the typically low activity patterns of these ( topologically ) special nodes @xcite .",
    "( average nearest neighbors degree ) : remarkably , nodes with the highest connectivity do not enhance , but rather diminish , cascades growth . as in the previous figure ,",
    "largest cascades are obtained when second spreaders ( the seed s neighbors ) have , on average , @xmath74 . ]",
    "it is generally accepted that cohesive sub - structures play an important role for the functioning of complex systems , because topologically dense clusters impose restrictions to dynamical processes running on top of the structure @xcite . for example , in the context of osns , detected communities in _ @mention _ twitter networks were found to encode both geographical and political information @xcite , suggesting that a large fraction of interactions take place locally , but lots of them also correspond to global modules for instance , users rely on mass media accounts to amplify their opinion . focusing on information diffusion , inter- and intra - modular connections in osns have already been explored @xcite regarding the nature of user - user ties .",
    "we instead investigate other questions , such as : ( i ) are modules actual bottlenecks for information diffusion ? ; ( ii ) is the spreading of information more successful for `` kinless '' nodes ( those who have links in many communities besides their own one ) ? or",
    "( iii ) do local hubs those with larger - than - expected intra - modular connectivity have higher chances to trigger system - wide cascades ?    ) in a cascade that unfolds in the same community of the initial seed and the size of the cascade itself ( @xmath75 ) .",
    "proportions have been normalized column - wise , i.e. by the total number of cascades with same size .",
    "note that cascades affecting up to @xmath60 nodes mostly lie close to the diagonal , i.e. a vast majority of the cascade occurs within the community where it began . at a certain point ( beyond @xmath76 )",
    "cascades spill over the module where they began . ]",
    "we apply the community analyses described in section 3.2 and obtain a network partition in @xmath77 and @xmath78 modules , for the `` grassroots '' and `` elections '' data sets respectively , with optimized @xmath29 values and maximum module size @xmath79 given in table 2 .",
    "next , for each cascade we compute how many nodes in the resulting diffusion tree belong to the same cluster of the seed ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "this allows to get , as shown in figure  [ fig7 ] , how often a cascade spills over the module where it began .",
    "interestingly , small to medium - sized cascades ( @xmath81 ) mainly diffuse within the same community where they were prompted , which hints at the fact that influence occurs within specialized topics @xcite .",
    "note however that our approach to community analysis is blind to contents and relies solely on the underlying topology , thus we can only make an educated guess regarding whether modules cluster users around a certain topic ( i.e. assuming _ homophily _",
    "remarkably , our results match qualitatively at least the predicted behavior in @xcite regarding cascades in correlated and modular networks .    turning to the individual level , the results depicted in the @xmath82 plane of figure  [ fig8 ] confirm the importance of connectivity in this case , within - module leadership to succeed when a cascade is triggered . indeed ,",
    "most nodes for which @xmath83 elicit large cascades in both samples .",
    "however , and most interestingly , it suggests that connector or kinless ( @xmath84 ) nodes @xcite can perform better than expected at precipitating system - wide cascades just by paying attention to internal connectivity . as shown in the figure , nodes with a z - score between 0 and 1 acting as connectors are still able to generate system - wide cascades because they compensate their relative lack of connectivity by bridging different modules .",
    "this feature is specially noticeable in the case of the `` election '' dataset ( right panel ) .",
    "all in all , our results establish that topological modules represent indeed dynamical bottlenecks , which need to be bypassed through high but also low connectivity users to let a cascade go global .",
    "planes to assess whether the modular structure of the following / friend network places dynamical constraints in the growth of cascades .",
    "a first clear result is that when local leaders ( @xmath85 ) precipitate information cascades , these tend to be more successful .",
    "more interestingly , connector nodes ( @xmath84 ) also succeed quite often , suggesting that a node s position in the mesoscale can sometimes play a more important role than a rich connectivity . ]",
    "in just one decade social networking sites have revolutionized human communication routines , placing solid foundations to the advent of the web 2.0 .",
    "the academia has not ignored such eruption , some researchers foreseeing a myriad of applications ranging from e - commerce to cooperative platforms ; while others soon intuited that osns could represent a unique opportunity to bring empirical evidence at large into open sociological problems .",
    "information cascades fall somewhere in between , both attracting the interest of viral marketing experts who worry about optimal outreach and costs and collective social action and political scientists concerned about grassroots movements , opinion contagion , etc .",
    "however , the diversity of osns which constrains the format and the way information flows between users and the complexity of human communication patterns heterogeneous activity , different classes of collective attention have resulted in a multiplicity of empirical approaches to cascading phenomena let alone theoretical works .",
    "while all of them highlight different interesting aspects of information dissemination , little has been done to confirm results testing its robustness across different social platforms and social contexts .    in this regard",
    ", the present work capitalizes on previous research to collect , in new large datasets , the statistics of time - constrained information cascades .",
    "this scheme exploits the concept of spike train from neuroscience , i.e. , a series of discrete action potentials from a neuron . in the brain ,",
    "two regions are classified as functionally related if they show activity within the same time window .",
    "consequently , message chains are reconstructed assuming that conversation - like activity is contagious if it takes place in relatively short time windows .",
    "the main preceding observed trends are here reproduced successfully .",
    "furthermore , we extend the study to uncover other internal facets of these cascades .",
    "first , we have discussed how long in time and how deep in the topology cascades go , to realize that , as in neuronal activity , time - constrained cascades can exhibit self - sustained activity .",
    "we have then paid attention to those nodes who , beyond the seeds initial onset , actively participate in the cascade .",
    "our main results point to two counterintuitive facts , by which hubs can short - circuit information pathways and average users hidden influentials spawn system - wide events .",
    "we have found that for a cascade to be successful in terms of the number of users involved in it , key nodes should be engaged .",
    "these nodes are not the hubs , which more than often behave as firewalls , but a middle class that either have a high multiplicative capacity or act as bridges between the modules that make up the system .",
    "presumably , modular topologies abundant in the real world entail the presence of information bottlenecks ( poor inter - modular connectivity ) which place constraints to efficient diffusion dynamics . indeed , we find that medium - sized and small cascades ( the most frequent ones ) happen mainly within the community where a cascade sprung .",
    "furthermore , those seed nodes which happen to be poorly classified ( they participate in many modules besides their own ) are more successful at triggering large cascades .",
    "a better understanding of time - constrained cascading behavior in complex systems leads to new questions .",
    "first , it seems clear that the bulk of theoretical work devoted to information spreading is not meant to model this conversation - type dynamics it is rather focused on rumor and epidemic models .",
    "other approaches need to be sought to fill such gap .",
    "also , time - constrained cascades have always been studied in the context of political discussion and mobilization . as such ,",
    "this is a fairly limited view of what happens in a service with ( as of late 2012 ) over 200 million active users .",

    "<S> in a diversified context with multiple social networking sites , heterogeneous activity patterns and different user - user relations , the concept of `` information cascade '' is all but univocal . despite the fact that such information cascades can be defined in different ways , </S>",

    "<S> , we explore one type of information cascades , namely , those that are time - constrained , related to two kinds of socially - rooted topics on twitter . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , we show that in both cases cascades sizes distribute following a fat tailed distribution and that whether or not a cascade reaches system - wide proportions is mainly given by the presence of so - called hidden influentials . </S>",
    "<S> these latter nodes are not the hubs , which on the contrary , often act as firewalls for information spreading . </S>",
    "<S> our results are important for a better understanding of the dynamics of complex contagion and , from a practical side , for the identification of efficient spreaders in viral phenomena .    </S>",
