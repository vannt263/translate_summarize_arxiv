    "clusters of galaxies are complex gravitationally bound systems holding together three components : galaxies , ranging from the faintest irregulars to the brightest elliptical galaxy that usually sits at the center of the potential well , hot gas [ hg ] ( detected by its x - ray emission ) and dark matter [ dm ] .",
    "many recent studies of the mass distribution of galaxy clusters exist , probing the distribution with various tools : galaxy dynamics ( e.g. the cnoc survey , carlberg et al 1997 ) , x - ray analysis ( e.g. allen , fabian & kneib 1996 , pislar et al 1997 ) and gravitational lensing ( e.g. fort & mellier 1994 , narayan & bartelmann 1995 ) .",
    "although , they are all generally consistent with a density profile that goes like @xmath4 at intermediate scales ( 200 - 1000 kpc ) , the exact profile at small and large scales is poorly known . at small radii",
    "there is usually a large number of galaxies in the central part of the clusters , being difficult to disentagle the galaxy halo masses from the larger - scale cluster component . at large radii",
    "the data are too noisy to make any safe statements .",
    "numerical simulations by navarro , frenk & white ( 1995 , 1996 ) indicate that simple gravitational systems follow a ` universal ' mass profile with a @xmath5 cusp at the center .",
    "however this results is subject to debate and other groups have claimed a steeper or shallower central profile ( kravstov et al 1997 , moore et al 1997 ) . generally , due to the presence of the brightest central galaxy the total mass distribution will be cuspy ( on a scale of a few kpc ) since elliptical galaxies are well fitted by a de vaucouleurs profile .",
    "does the cusp exist only on the stellar component , or is it also a property of the hg and dm components ? solving these questions will help understand what the dynamical interactions between the various components are , and whether any simple scaling laws can be found .",
    "the investigation of gravitational lensing of faint background galaxies by low - redshift clusters of galaxies has been largely unexplored so far .",
    "in fact , background galaxies offer the possibility of probing the mass distribution of these clusters with higher - spatial resolution than that allowed by high-@xmath6 cluster lenses , and should yield more accurate results on scales appropriate to the study of the mass profile of the cluster core or even of individual galaxy members .",
    "the study of low-@xmath6 cluster lenses has specially good prospect now that efficient wide - field cameras will soon become available ( e.g. the cfht12k and the acs aboard hst ) .    theoretically , the cluster lensing efficiency assuming a non - evolving mass profile with redshift , and a reasonable redshift distribution for the faint galaxy population ( see for example natarajan & kneib 1996 )",
    " has its maximum around @xmath7 .",
    "thus , a cluster at @xmath8 is as efficient , in terms of the mean shear produced at a certain angular distance from its center , as a @xmath9 cluster . for low redshift clusters the lensing efficiency depends on the total mass profile at the center , whereas for high redshift clusters it depends on the redhift distribution of the background faint galaxies .",
    "there is already evidence of lensing in low redshift clusters of galaxies , but a discussion of the use of these cluster lenses for the investigation of the mass profile of clusters has not yet been addressed .",
    "allen , fabian & kneib ( 1996 ) discovered a @xmath10 arc in the pks0745 @xmath11 cluster , which has been successfully modelled as a gravitational lens image .",
    "a second case has been suggested by shaya , baum and hammergren ( 1996 ) , who found an arc - like feature so far without redshift information  close to ngc4881 ( @xmath12 ) in the coma cluster . and",
    "thirdly , there is the tentative case found by campusano & hardy ( 1996 ) of a bright @xmath0 arc - like feature in a @xmath1 cluster ( abell 3408 ) . in this paper",
    ", we further investigate the lensing by low-@xmath6 clusters by discussing the possibility that the arc in abell 3408 is a gravitational image , and by computing the elliptical distorsions expected in the images of the faint background galaxies ( weak shear ) under different mass models .",
    "we adopt @xmath13=1 , @xmath14=0 and h@xmath15= 50 @xmath16 ; 1 \" corresponds to 1.136 @xmath17 kpc at the distance of the cluster .",
    "little is known about a3408 ( @xmath1 ) , whose j2000.0 coordinates are ra = 07@xmath1808@xmath1929@xmath20 , dec = -49@xmath2112@xmath2250.3@xmath23 .",
    "it lies in a largely unexplored low galactic latitude section of the southern sky and it may even form a single unit with a3407 ( galli _ et al .",
    "abell 3408 has been detected by the rosat - all - sky - survey which measured a flux @xmath24 erg  @xmath25 ( ebeling et al 1996 ) .",
    "recently , campusano and hardy(1996 ) discovered an arc - like feature ( @xmath0 ) near its center .",
    "we present here  in full  the photometric and spectroscopic observations of the arc and the central elliptical galaxy of a3408 .",
    "imaging observations trough the b , r and i filters were obtained with the cf / ccd camera system at the cerro tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio ) 0.9-m telescope .",

    "the width of arc - like object is unresolved , with a fwhm of @xmath271.2 '' compatible with the observed seeing .",
    "its magnitude and color are ( after removal of the contiguous stellar object from the images via daophot ) as follows : @xmath28 = 18.60 , @xmath29 = 0.42 , and @xmath30 = 0.79 .",

    "flux calibration was determined by observations of the southern spectroscopic standards of hamuy et al .",

    "we obtained absorption spectra for the central elliptical galaxy ( yielding @xmath46 , in good agreement with the results of galli _ et al .",
    "_ 1993 ) , and for the stellar object inmediately next to the arc , which was found to be a a k - type foreground star .    for the arc , its relatively high surface brightness yielded a high s / n _ integrated _ spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ fig : onedspec_arc ] ) .",
    "its derived mean redshift , based on the eight well - measured nebular emission lines ( listed below ) , is @xmath47 corresponding to 21,840 @xmath48 km   s@xmath45 .",
    "we also detected the absorption a - type spectrum of the underlying stellar population of the source which confirmed the emission - line velocity from six absorption lines .",
    "also , using the most prominent nebular lines ( [ oii]3727  , [ oiii]5007  and h@xmath49 ) we measured velocities along the arc , which revealed a velocity gradient over a linear distance of about 10 kpc @xmath2 with @xmath50 peak - to - peak amplitude .",
    "equivalent widths ( in  , indicated within parenthesis ) for the main nebular lines are as follows : [ oii ] @xmath14 3727 ( 24.5 ) ; h@xmath51 ( 6.7 ) ; [ oiii ] @xmath14 4959 ( 8.7 ) ; [ oiii ] @xmath14 5007 ( 20.0 ) ; h@xmath49 ( 58.7 ) ; [ nii ] @xmath14 6583 ( 5.0 ) ; [ sii ] @xmath14 6717 ( 12.1 ) .",
    "we are clearly not seeing a young starburst as the balmer lines are not particularly broad  h@xmath49 and h@xmath51 both are well fitted by gaussians with a fwhm of 8   ( i.e. , 310 @xmath52 ) , equivalent to the instrumental resolution , and the ew value of 6.7   for h@xmath51 indicates an old age for the star - forming region from the models of leitherer & heckman ( 1995 ) .",
    "the overall emission spectrum is characteristic of intermediate - excitation hii regions with a ratio [ oiii ] @xmath14 5007/h@xmath51 = 3.0 , and low ratio [ nii]/h@xmath49 = 0.09 .",
    "the underlying stellar spectrum with well - defined balmer lines is compatible with an intermediate - a average spectral type .",
    "thus , the spectral information is suggestive of a late - type spiral , an irregular , or a blue compact dwarf [ bcd ] galaxy .",
    "the linear size of the arc is 20.6 @xmath2 kpc , a value more compatible with a medium - size spiral than with a typical irr or bcd , but its rotational velocity is about half of that expected for an edge - on spiral of this luminosity ( mathewson & ford .",
    "notice also , that the implied absolute magnitude of the arc - like object is @xmath3 = -18.8 , which is too faint for a medium - size spiral but not incompatible with that of a small spiral such as m33 , or an irregular such as the lmc , both of which however have small linear sizes of only a few(6 - 7 ) kpc .",
    "also , the mean surface brightness of the arc is too low for a medium - size spiral , but again compatible with a small spiral , an irregular , or a bcd .",
    "therefore , the straightforward interpretation of the arc implies a physical object of somewhat contradictory properties .",
    "it appears to be an elongated extragalactic object with emission characteristic of a typical hii region along most of its body , 20.6 @xmath2 kpc in size , a velocity profile with amplitude @xmath27 40 km   s@xmath45 , and a surface brightness and luminosity typical of the much smaller ( factor  4 ) magellanic irregular galaxies .",
    "a low luminosity can hardly be attributed to dust as the colors are normal .",
    "but , could this arc - like object be the product of gravitational lensing by the angularly close foreground giant elliptical ?",
    "there is no evidence for a counter image of the arc although there are objects of similar color to the arc , they are not at the position expected for a `` two - image '' configuration .",
    "the `` gravitational radius '' of the arc is @xmath53 50  ( i.e. @xmath54 56.8 @xmath2 kpc at the cluster distance ) .    for a study of the gravitational lens scenario , we used both a simple spherical and a more sophisticated elliptical lensing models in order to compute the projected mass of the cluster within the radius defined by the bright arc .",
    "all these potentials are able to produce a single arc , as observed , but each one with different implications for the source galaxy and the physical parameters of the cluster .",
    "we consider below two lensing mass model to compute the source properties ( see table  [ tab : arcprop ] ) of the `` single '' arc :    \\i ) _ the constant m / l model _ : given that the arc is at a distance of @xmath273 r@xmath35 , we adopted a mass distribution that follows the light distribution  assuming a constant m / l@xmath42 @xmath27 10 which is consistent with the results from the fundamental plane  , and which can be regarded as the `` minimum '' mass case .",
    "the mass enclosed within @xmath55 is m(@xmath55)@xmath27 1.5 x 10@xmath56 m@xmath57 , and the velocity dispersion of the stars at r@xmath35/2 is 225 km  @xmath25 .",
    "the model predicts an amplification of 0.01 mag and a tangential stretching of @xmath271.02  there is obviously no much difference with respect to the no - lensing case .",
    "the predicted weak - shear @xmath58 at the distance of the arc , for galaxies with @xmath590.7 , is @xmath600.07 ( @xmath61 is the expected averaged mean ellipticity of the imaged faint galaxies - see _",
    "e.g. _ kneib et al 1996 ) .",
    "this value is at the detection limit . + ii ) _ the dark halo model _ :",
    "both , strong and weak lensing studies ( e.g. kneib et al 1996 ) clearly indicate the presence of dark halos in clusters , centered on the brightest elliptical galaxy , and with a typical m / l@xmath62 ratio of @xmath27200 .",
    "such dark haloes are also supported by the high velocity dispersion of cluster galaxies , as well as by the increase of the velocity dispersion of stars in giant elliptical galaxies ( e.g. a2029 , dressler 1980 ) . adopting a massive mass profile comparable to the one found in a2218 ( kneib et al 1996 )  the `` maximum '' mass model  we predict a single observed arc with an enclosed mass of m(@xmath55)@xmath27 4.4 x 10@xmath63 m@xmath57 corresponding to @xmath64 ) @xmath27 230 , and an asymptotic velocity dispersion for the member galaxies of 900 km  @xmath25 .",
    "the model predicts an amplification of 0.6 mag and a tangential stretching of @xmath271.4 for the source galaxy .",
    "in contrast to the prediction of the ` minimum ' mass model , the expected weak - shear at the distance of the arc , for galaxies with @xmath590.7 , is @xmath650.5 .",
    "this value is quite large and readily measurable , thus it is a strong prediction of this model .",
    "the velocity dispersion of the stars in the central elliptical galaxy is predicted to vary from 275 km  @xmath25 at the center , for both the low - mass and dark - halo models , to 225 km  @xmath25 and 435 km  @xmath25 at r@xmath35/2 , and to 190 and 550 km  @xmath25 at r@xmath35=1 , for model i ) and ii ) respectively .    note",
    "that this model should be considered as a fiducial one , describing the mass distribution of a3408 only in an approximate manner . in this exploratory work ,",
    "the idea was simply to extrapolate the mass distribution from a higher-@xmath6 cluster and scale it to a lower redshift .",
    "the possibility of adopting a more massive halo model , in order to get a better agreement between the source galaxy a bcd , was considered and discarded .",
    "a much larger total mass was required , which would have placed this cluster amongst the most massive ones in the universe in spite of its relatively low x - ray luminosity .",
    "but how common are the derived ` source ' galaxy characteristics ?",
    "we are facing two possibilities : a ) an  essentially  unlensed elongated galaxy of 20.6 @xmath2 kpc and @xmath3 = -18.8 , or b ) a lensed elongated source of 14.6 @xmath2 kpc and @xmath3 = -18.2 .",
    "we can derive a ",
    "priori probabilities from an examination of the binggeli , sandage & tamman ( 1988 ; fig .",
    "1 ) luminosity functions which also assume h@xmath15= 50  km  @xmath66 .    for case",
    "a ) 35% of the field galaxies will be sc s with the required absolute magnitude , but for the observed edge - on configuration only @xmath27 5 - 10% are possible , and the probability drops significantly when the low mass implied by the low rotation observed is considered .",
    "even the smallest sc s have twice the observed rotational velocity . for later spiral types ( sd + sm)the corresponding probabilities are about 50% lower . irregulars or bcd s with this absolute magnitude are essentially non - existent . for case",
    "b ) the situation does not change significantly due to the shallow slope of the observed lf : somewhat less than 30% of the field galaxies will be sc s with the required magnitude , but for the observed edge - on configuration only @xmath27 5% are possible ; in this case , the low mass implied by the low rotation observed is perhaps a bit more realistic . at this absolute magnitude irr and bcds still remain virtually non - existent .",
    "both the mean surface @xmath31 = 24.23 mag / arcsec@xmath32  although typical of the magellanic irregular galaxies  and color b - r = 0.79 of the arc are not incompatible with those of small sc galaxies .",
    "then , a small lensed spiral seen nearly face on , and thus of low projected rotational velocity , but elongated by gravitational shear would fit the observations .    the above probabilities , however , are strictly _ a - priori _ and thus must be taken with a grain of salt as we can not at present exclude that the observed arc is not simply a conspiring and unusual unlensed member of the astronomical zoo .",
    "we can not at this point decide on the identity of the source , but on statistical grounds a spiral seems likely , although we can not decide either on whether such a spiral would or not be lensed , and if it is , what its intrinsic orientation would be .    on a more positive note , however",
    ", we have shown that there is a strong test that can be applied to the dark halo model : deep wide - field imaging of low-@xmath6 clusters ( similar to a3408 ) should display a weak shear easily measurable with standard techniques .",
    "the analysis of such weak shear , coupled with x - ray observations of these clusters , should unveil the profile of the different mass components in the very central region of the cluster of galaxies .",
    "a better understanding of the dynamics of these relaxed systems would then be possible .",
