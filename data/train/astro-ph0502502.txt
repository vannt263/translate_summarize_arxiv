    "it is now widely accepted that millisecond oscillations during thermonuclear x - ray bursts ( hereafter , burst oscillations ) on accreting , weakly magnetized neutron stars in low mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) systems are produced by spin modulation of a slowly moving , non - uniform brightness pattern on the stellar surface ( see strohmayer et al . 1996 ; strohmayer & bildsten 2004 , van der klis 2004 ) .",
    "in addition to revealing the spin frequency these oscillations encode information about the global properties of the neutron star .",
    "a number of attempts have been made to model burst oscillations and thus to infer these properties ( e.g. , nath , strohmayer & swank 2001 ; muno , zel & chakrabarty 2002 ; poutanen & gierliski 2003 , bhattacharyya et al . 2005 ) , however , uncertainties associated with the exact nature of the brightness pattern makes a unique interpretation of the data problematic .    as of february , 2005 ,",
    "the number of lmxbs that exhibit burst oscillations amounts to 13 , and two of these contain millisecond x - ray pulsars ( see , e.g. , chakrabarty et al .",
    "2003 ; strohmayer et al . 2003 ) . for most burst oscillations",
    "a single oscillation frequency is found that displays a positive frequency drift @xmath17 of a few hz from the start to the tail of a burst . in the decaying tail",
    "the frequency often approaches an asymptotic value ( e.g. , strohmayer & markwardt 1999 ) .",
    "the asymptotic frequencies are stable to a few parts in 1000 in bursts observed over several years from any given source ( strohmayer et al .",
    "1998b ; muno et al .",
    "background subtracted light curves for the burst oscillations are in most cases well fitted by a single sinusoid , the frequency of which we will call the fundamental frequency .",
    "harmonic content in the light curves is generally small ( strohmayer & markwardt 1999 ; muno et al .",
    "indeed , to date there exists only one strong detection of a first harmonic , in the millisecond x - ray pulsar xte j1814 - 338 ( strohmayer et al . 2003 , bhattacharyya et al . 2005 ) . on average",
    "the rms amplitudes of the burst oscillations are 2%-10% , and generally increase with photon energy ( muno et al .",
    "muno et al.(2003 ) also explored the energy dependence of the oscillation phases of burst oscillations .",
    "they found either constant phase lags with energy or in some cases evidence for modest hard lags , behavior that is opposite to what one would expect from relativistic motion of a simple hot spot on the stellar surface ( e.g. , ford 1999 ) .",
    "interestingly , where phase lags have been measured in the accreting millisecond pulsars they all show soft lags , consistent with a rotating hot spot model ( cui , morgan & titarchuk 1998 ; poutanen & gierliski 2003 ) .    as noted above",
    ", a non - uniform brightness distribution on the surface of rotating neutron stars is almost certainly responsible for the burst oscillations , and several models have so far been proposed to explain the inhomogeneous pattern . as a typical model , strohmayer et al .",
    "( 1997 ) suggested the oscillation originates from hot regions ( hot spots ) in a thermonuclear burning layer that expands and decouples from the neutron star at the start of the burst .",
    "although a simple hot spot appears to be consistent with oscillations observed during the onset of some bursts ( see strohmayer et al .",
    "1998a ) , further calculations suggested that a rigidly rotating , hydrostatically expanding burning layer produces too small a frequency drift ( cumming & bildsten 2000 , cumming et al . 2002 ) .",
    "there have been numerous efforts to calculate light curves produced by hot spots on the surface of rotating neutron stars ( e.g. , pechenick et al .",
    "1983 , chen & shaham 1989 , strohmayer 1992 , page 1995 , braje et al . 2000 , weinberg et al .",
    "2001 , muno et al . 2002 , nath et al .",
    "2002 , poutanen & gierliski 2003 , bhattacharyya et al .",
    "2005 ) . in the modeling of the light curves",
    "many parameters are employed , for example , the number of hot spots , their location with respect to the rotation axis , their angular sizes , the inclination angle between the line of sight and the rotation axis , the angular dependence of the specific intensity , the temperature of the spots , the temperature contrast between the spots and their surroundings , the mass , radius , and spin frequency of the star .",
    "as noted above , burst oscillation light curves are remarkably sinusoidal .",
    "although the light curve amplitudes are dependent on the relativistic parameter @xmath14 , which is a parameter of particular importance , it is obvious that there remain parameters other than @xmath14 that affect the amplitudes , such as the angular sizes and locations of the hot spots and the inclination angle ( e.g. , pechenick et al .",
    "1983 , weinberg et al .",
    "2001 , muno et al .",
    "in this sense it is quite important to find other observational quantities that can be used to obtain independent constraints on these parameters .",
    "the energy dependencies of phase lags are an example of potentially important observational quantities that carry useful information about the neutron star . taking account of the special relativistic doppler boosting of x - ray photons due to rapid rotation of the star ( ford 1999 , weinberg et al .",
    "2001 ) , the hot spot model can produce hard leads more or less consistent with those observed in the millisecond x - ray pulsar sax j1808.4 - 3658 and igr",
    "j00291 + 5934 ( poutanen & gierliski 2003 ; galloway et al .",
    "2005 ) , but the model appears to be at odds with the suggestion of hard lags in some burst oscillations ( muno et al .",
    "although it may be possible to produce hard lags via a hot comptonizing corona , it is worth exploring in more detail whether more complex brightness patterns ( such as oscillation mode patterns ) on the stellar surface might be consistent with the production of hard lags .    by inferring the hot spot size using the observationally obtained blackbody flux",
    "@xmath18 , poutanen & gierliski ( 2003 ) have succeeded in estimating the radius of the millisecond x - ray pulsar sax j1808.4 - 3658 assuming an appropriate range of mass for the star .",
    "recently , strohmayer et al . ( 2003 ) have found the first harmonic component in the light curves of burst oscillations from the accreting millisecond x - ray pulsar xte j1814 - 338 , and bhattacharyya et al .",
    "( 2005 ) obtained a useful constraint on the ratio @xmath14 assuming a single hot spot model .",
    "as alluded to above , the hot spot model is not always successful in producing the observed light curves of the burst oscillations . as discussed by muno et al .",
    "( 2002b ) , a small hot spot in a completely dark background is likely to produce light curves with too large an amplitude as well as having strong harmonic components not seen observationally . to suppress the large amplitudes and the harmonics one has to assume , for example , a hot spot of angular size @xmath19 or almost completely antipodal hot spots , the assumptions of which are not necessarily physically well motivated .",
    "it is therefore important to pursue alternatives to the hot spot model .    in this paper , we calculate light curves of rotating neutron stars assuming the surface temperature perturbation pattern caused by surface @xmath0-modes propagating in the fluid ocean of a mass accreting neutron star ( lee 2004 ) .",
    "it was heyl ( 2004 ) who first argued that the @xmath0-modes with low @xmath1 may play a possible role for burst oscillations .",
    "the surface @xmath0-modes are rotationally induced oscillations with very low frequencies in the corotating frame of the star .",
    "the @xmath0-modes have dominant vorticity @xmath20 and are basically just large scale vortexes ( see spitkovsky , levin , & ushomirsky 2002 ) .",
    "if we assume axisymmetry of the equilibrium configuration of the rotating star , the time dependence of the temperature perturbation may be given by @xmath21 , where @xmath3 denotes the oscillation frequency in the inertial frame .",
    "if we let @xmath22 and @xmath2 denote the oscillation frequency in the corotating frame and the spin frequency of the star , respectively , we have @xmath23 , which leads to @xmath24 for the surface @xmath0-modes , since @xmath25 , where @xmath1 is an integer representing the azimuthal wave number around the rotation axis .",
    "the time dependence of the perturbation is thus to good approximation given by @xmath26 .",
    "since only the oscillation modes having low @xmath1 will produce light variations of appreciable amplitude , in this paper , we only consider the surface @xmath0-modes with @xmath11 or @xmath9 .",
    "we briefly describe the method of calculation in  2 . in ",
    "3 we discuss some of our numerical results with relevance to burst oscillations .",
    " 4 is for a discussion , and we give a summary of our principal conclusions in  5 .",
    "the method of calculating light curves of rotating neutron stars is similar to those discussed by pechenick et al .",

    "( 2001 ) . instead of presuming the presence of a hot spot on the surface of a rotating neutron star , we assume that the temperature varies accross the surface with the angular distribution appropriate for a surface @xmath0-mode propagating in the fluid ocean of the star",
    ". the surface @xmath0-modes , which have very low oscillation frequencies in the corotating frame of the star , can plausibly be excited during thermonuclear bursts ( lee 2004 ) .    to describe oscillations of rotating neutron stars , we employ an @xmath27 coordinate system whose origin is at the center of the star with the rotation axis along the @xmath28 direction . for convenience , we also assume that the observer is in the @xmath29-@xmath28 plane . in this coordinate system ,",
    "the oscillations of rotating neutron stars are described by employing spherical polar coordinates @xmath30 with the axis @xmath31 being the @xmath28-axis .",

    "since the difference @xmath264 for the even @xmath0-mode with @xmath11 is almost insensitive to @xmath60 and its magnitude increases almost monotonically with the radius @xmath15 for a given @xmath60 , the difference may be useful as an observational indicator for the ratio @xmath14 .",

    "the oscillation energy @xmath299 of a mode observed in the corotating frame may be given by ( e.g. , unno et al .",

    "although the estimation given above contains many parameters , all of which are not necessarily well determined , we may expect that the amount of energy required to excite the modes to appreciable amplitudes is a modest fraction of that released in a burst .",
    "it is interesting to note that , although the odd @xmath0-modes need to have larger amplitudes to produce appreciable light variations than the even @xmath0-modes , the former are easier to excite than the latter for a given amount of energy released in a burst .",
    "we have calculated light curves produced by the surface @xmath0-modes of a rotating neutron star , taking account of the effects of gravitational light bending , gravitational red shift , and the difference in the arrival times of photons traveling in the static schwarzschild spacetime , as well as the doppler shift of photon energy due to rapid spin of the star .",
    "we find that the fundamental even @xmath0-mode with @xmath11 produces the largest light variations .",
    "the light curves produced by a single even @xmath0-mode of a given @xmath1 are dominated by the fundamental component with frequency @xmath217 , although those produced by a single odd @xmath0-mode also contain a first harmonic component of appreciable amplitude as well as the fundamental component , the relative strengths depending on the inclination angle @xmath60 .",
    "the phase shift @xmath264 produced by the even @xmath11 @xmath0-mode is only weakly dependent on the inclination angle @xmath60 and is almost a monotonic function of @xmath15 for a given @xmath60 .",

    "it is useful to translate the phase shift difference into a hard - lag measure , @xmath321 , which is given for @xmath273hz by @xmath322 where negative @xmath321 means hard leads .",

    "compared with the hot spot model , the wave model generally produces smaller amplitude light variations .",
