    "many dynamical systems with some hyperbolicity enjoy strong statistical properties .",
    "let us mention a few of them : existence of physical measure , exponential decay of correlations , central limit theorem , large deviation principles , etc .",
    "that is , the probabilistic behavior of these systems mimics an i.i.d . process . beyond uniform hyperbolicity",
    "the situation may be different .",
    "this has a visible consequence for example in the validity of the clt , which is often related to a summable decay of correlation .",
    "we will consider here a class of nonuniformly hyperbolic systems for which the polynomial decay of correlation can be arbitrarily slow .",
    "the setting , introduced by alves and pinheiro  @xcite and generalized by alves and azevedo  @xcite is a system modeled by a young tower on which we have a uniform polynomial control on the contraction along stable manifolds and backward contraction along unstable manifolds .",
    "the full description of the setting is in section  [ sec : tower ] .",

    "suppose that @xmath5 is an invariant measure for @xmath2 .",
    "given @xmath6 in @xmath3 , we are interested in the statistical behavior , with respect to @xmath5 , of the number of occurences of entrance times in the ball @xmath0 .",
    "namely , setting @xmath7 we are interested in the limit distribution of @xmath8 , as @xmath9 goes to @xmath10 .",
    "the main result of the paper is that this limit is the poisson distribution , for @xmath5-a.e .",
    "this question has been adressed for many different dynamical systems .",
    "our result is a generalization of the recent work by collet and chazottes  @xcite who studied towers with exponential tail of return time to a setting where the tail is only polynomial ( we refer to @xcite and references therein for details on previous works ) .",
    "our work applies for example to stadium like billiards . during the preparation of this work freitas , haydn and nicol  @xcite obtained a similar result on poisson distribution for these billiards by a different method ( inducing the billiard map on a suitable reference set where the induced map has a tower with exponential tail ) .",
    "we also mention haydn and wasilewska @xcite whose approach needs a polynomial tail of sufficiently large order , in a nonuniformly expanding setting .",
    "our limit theorem relies on precise mixing estimates for sets defined with balls . for some systems the indicator functions of balls",
    "have a bounded norm in a good banach space of functions for which one can use the decay of correlations directly .",
    "this leads to a poisson distribution and even gives stronger results  @xcite . here in our situation",
    "one can not expect to implement this strategy and we need to approximate our balls to get mixing estimates .",
    "that is why we need a control on the measure of neighborhood of balls as in  .",
    "outside absolutely continuous measure this leads to delicate questions . in  @xcite a general result",
    "is obtained for srb measure with one - dimensional unstable manifold .",
    "the generalization to higher dimensional systems or polynomial tower being open , we left the condition   as an assumption .",
    "we emphasize that this condition is the weakest that one can ask in our setting .",
    "a major step in our proof of the poisson distribution is to bypass the lengthy and delicate study of short returns by a simple argument based on recurrence rates .",
