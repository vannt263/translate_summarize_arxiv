    "the sinc function is defined as @xcite @xmath1 due to its unique properties the sinc function is widely used in many applications in applied mathematics and computational physics . in particular , it can be applied in the fourier analysis , numerical integration and differentiation @xcite .",
    "vieta discovered a remarkable identity showing that the sinc function can be expressed as an infinite product @xcite @xmath2 the infinite product can be represented in form @xmath3 and because of the limit @xmath4 we can infer that @xmath5 consequently , the infinite product can be truncated as @xmath6 although such a finite product of the cosine functions looks attractive for numerical integration , this form of the sinc approximation is not always convenient in practical applications since in many circumstances it is quite difficult to handle an integrand with product of the cosines .",
    "however , due to a product - to - sum identity that we have introduced in our previous publication @xcite @xmath7 such a problem in truncation may be very effectively resolved . specifically , substituting the product - to - sum identity into the vietas infinite product yields the following limit @xmath8    the truncation of this equation to an integer @xmath9 leads to the approximation based on the incomplete cosine expansion of the sinc function @xcite @xmath10 since the right side of this approximation is a sum of the cosine functions , it is periodic and , therefore , valid in the interval @xmath11 near the origin",
    ".    as we have shown already , the upper limit in the incomplete cosine expansion of the sinc function may not be restricted by value @xmath9 only @xcite .",
    "it can also be extended to an arbitrary integer @xmath12 .",
    "such a transition from @xmath9 to an arbitrary value @xmath12 can be shown by using the relation @xmath13 and then by making change of the variable @xmath14 in the equation that results in @xmath15 the presence of the limit signifies that if the integer @xmath12 is large enough , then it can be taken as an arbitrary integer leading to the following approximation @xcite ( see also equation ( a.1 ) in the preprint version of ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath16 similar to equation this form of the incomplete cosine expansion of the sinc function is valid within the range @xmath17 as the right side of the equation is a periodic function .",
    "thus , we can consider the approximation as a more generalized form of the incomplete cosine expansion of the sinc function .",
    "particularly , comparing equations and with each other one can see that the approximation is a just specific case that occurs at @xmath14 .",
    "the application of the incomplete cosine expansion of the sinc function is flexible and , therefore , efficient in numerical integration . in our previous publications",
    "we have shown that the incomplete cosine expansion of the sinc function can be effective in sampling @xcite . however , the sampling is not the only possibility where it can be very useful . in this work",
    "we show that application of the incomplete cosine expansion of the sinc function can also be used as a flexible tool for mathematical analysis . specifically , using the incomplete cosine expansion of the sinc function we can derive a new asymptotic expansion series for the constant @xmath0 .",
    "the most common form of definition of the error function is given by @xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the complex argument .",
    "the error function belongs to a family of special functions that sometimes regarded as the faddeeva functions .",
    "this family of special functions includes the complex error function also known as the faddeeva function @xcite @xmath20,\\ ] ] the dawsons integral @xcite @xmath21 the fresnel integral @xcite @xmath22 and the normal distribution function @xcite @xmath23    in general , the argument @xmath19 of the error function is complex .",
    "however , in this paper we imply that its imaginary part @xmath24 of the argument @xmath25 is zero .",
    "therefore , we only use the notation @xmath26 signifying that @xmath27 is always real .",
    "there is a remarkable integral of the error function ( see integral 12 on page 4 in @xcite ) @xmath28 that can be readily expressed through the sinc function . in order to rearrange it accordingly",
    ", we make a change of the variable @xmath29 leading to @xmath30 or @xmath31 the factor @xmath32 that is present in the argument of the sinc function can be easily excluded by making another change of the variable @xmath33 providing @xmath34 or @xmath35 further we will use this integral to approximate the error function in form of the gaussian expansion series .",
    "there are many elegant expansions for the constant @xmath0 have been published in the modern literature @xcite .",
    "significant part of the recent developments in this field is related to the ramanujan - type expansion series @xcite",
    ". nowadays , more than @xmath36 trillion digits of pi have been computed . here",
    "we derive a new asymptotic expansion series for the constant @xmath0 by using the incomplete cosine expansion of the sinc function .    we may attempt to substitute the approximation for the sinc function into the integral in order to approximate the error function @xmath37 however ,",
    "since right side of the approximation is periodic , we have to justify that such a substitution is possible .",
    "as it has been mentioned above , the sinc function can be approximated by the incomplete cosine expansion only within the range @xmath17 near the origin .",
    "this can be seen from the fig .",
    "1 showing the incomplete cosine expansion ( black curve ) and the original sinc function ( shadowed blue curve ) . for the specific example",
    "@xmath38 shown in the fig .",
    "1 the corresponding range where the incomplete cosine expansion coincides with the original sinc function is @xmath39 since @xmath40 . as we can see from this figure , due to periodicity",
    "the incomplete cosine expansion can not approximate the original sinc function beyond this specified range .    according to milone _",
    "@xcite , an integral of kind @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a bounded function , can be approximated as @xmath43 retaining high accuracy since @xmath44 very rapidly decreases when @xmath45 effectively damping such a way the entire integrand to zero . from the relation",
    "it immediately follows that for a bounded function @xmath46 @xmath47 or @xmath48        we can see now that despite periodicity , the approximation can be valid when the incomplete cosine expansion coincides with the original sinc function in the interval @xmath49 since all other range is effectively damped to zero due to presence of the multiplier @xmath50 and , therefore , do not contribute for integration .",
    "consequently , if the condition @xmath51 is satisfied , then periodicity of the incomplete cosine expansion of the sinc function can be ignored in substitution into the approximation .    each integral term on the right side of equation is integrable .",
    "consequently , once the condition is satisfied , integration of the equation leads to the error function approximation in form of the gaussian expansion series @xmath52    figure 2 shows some approximation curves for the error function obtained at @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 by brown , green , red and blue curves , respectively .",
    "the black curve corresponding to the original error function is also shown for comparison .",
    "as we can see from this figure the curves tend to zero earlier and faster with decreasing @xmath12 .",
    "this can be readily explained since the criterion is violated stronger at smaller values of the integer @xmath12 and larger values of the argument @xmath57 .",
    "it should be noted that because of the criterion the error function approximation can cover accurately only a central part near the origin .",
    "this problem , however , can be resolved since the computational test shows that @xmath58 and @xmath59 are practically equal to @xmath60 and @xmath61 , respectively .",
    "consequently , we can cover the entire range @xmath62 by using the following approximation @xmath63    consider the following integral ( see integral 1 on page 7 in @xcite ) @xmath64 from the definition for the error function it is not difficult to see that @xmath65 .",
    "consequently , by stretching @xmath66 to infinity we can rewrite this integral as an identity for the square root of pi @xmath67 since the error function is a bounded function @xmath68 , then , according to milone _",
    "@xcite , we can write @xmath69 and since the argument @xmath70 in the integrand varies from @xmath71 to @xmath72 , the criterion for this case can be written as @xmath73 thus , we have reached an important result ; we estimate a smallest value of the integer @xmath12 to be equal to @xmath74 at which we can ignore periodicity of the incomplete cosine expansion of the sinc function .",
    "assuming now that the integer @xmath75 , the substitution of the error function approximation into identity provides @xmath76 in this equation each integral term is integrable . as a result",
    ", we have @xmath77 or @xmath78 since @xmath79 , we can simply ignore @xmath80 in the denominator due to vanishing contribution .",
    "consequently , we obtain the asymptotic expansion series for the constant @xmath0 @xmath81    the expansion series and are asymptotic because they both converge to the constant @xmath82 as the integer @xmath12 approaches to infinity . to the best of our knowledge the asymptotic formulas and for computing the constant @xmath82 have never been reported in scientific literature .",
    "perhaps these asymptotic formulas may be grouped as a special kind of expansions due to their specific feature - the presence of an arbitrarily large integer @xmath83 that is involved in each summation term in computing pi .",
    "there is an easier way to derive the asymptotic series and . since the equation is exact , its substitution into identity yields @xmath84 or @xmath85 once again , since the equation is exact its substitution into identity provides @xmath86 or @xmath87 or @xmath88 while @xmath12 tends to infinity @xmath79 and @xmath89 .",
    "consequently , we can simplify the limit as given by @xmath90    truncating now the equations and we obtain the asymptotic expansion series and , respectively , for the constant pi .",
    "although this way of derivation is straightforward , it does not explain why the limits and can be truncated for computation of @xmath82 if the finite value of the integer @xmath12 signifies an appearance of the periodicity on right side of the equation .",
    "furthermore , this derivation also does not provide an estimated value for a smallest @xmath12 at which the periodicity can be ignored .",
    "therefore , the initial derivation discussed earlier in this section is more informative and preferable .      in this section",
    "we represent some examples of approximated constant pi and compare them with the reference @xmath91 we performed all computational tests by using wolfram mathematica 9 in enhanced precision mode in order to demonstrate how many digits can coincide with the reference at some given @xmath12 .",
    "as we have found the estimated value for the smallest integer , it would be reasonable to start computation of the constant pi at @xmath92 .",
    "substitution shows that even with this small integer the equation provides a number where four digits coincide with the reference @xmath93 however , with same integer the equation can not compute properly . in particular , the result of computation is @xmath94 where only first digit coincides with the reference .",
    "such a low accuracy occurs due to simplification we made by excluding @xmath80 terms in denominator of the equation under assumption that @xmath12 is large . as a result ,",
    "when @xmath12 is relatively small , say below @xmath95 , we should not expect a close approximation for pi .",
    "increase of the integer up to @xmath96 shows the values @xmath97 and @xmath98 for the equations and , respectively .",
    "the equation shows unusual behavior ; the digits coinciding with the reference consist of two groups of three digits separated by a single non - coinciding digit @xmath71 .",
    "furthermore , the non - coinciding digit @xmath71 is smaller than the actual digit @xmath60 by one .",
    "increase of the integer up to @xmath99 shows a significant improvement in accuracy of the equation @xmath100 as we can see , the thirteen digits coincide with the reference .",
    "however , with same integer , the equation again shows unusual behavior ; the digits coinciding with the reference consist of two groups of six digits separated by a single non - coinciding digit .",
    "@xmath101 we also note that this non - coinciding digit @xmath60 between two groups is smaller than the corresponding actual digit @xmath32 by one .    further increase of the integer up to @xmath102 in the equation yields further improvement in accuracy revealing @xmath103 coinciding digits with the reference @xmath104 however , the equation again retain the unusual behavior in computation @xmath105 specifically , it yields a value consisting of two groups of nine coinciding digits where a single non - coinciding digit @xmath32 separating these two groups is smaller than the actual digit by one .",
    "lastly , the computational test we performed at @xmath106 reveals a rapid convergence in the equation @xmath107 since there are @xmath108 digits that coincide with the reference .",
    "once again , the equation persistently retain unusual tendency in computation @xmath109 showing two groups of coinciding digits with @xmath36 digits in each group .",
    "these two groups of coinciding digits are separated by non - coinciding digit @xmath110 that is smaller than the actual digit @xmath111 by one .",
    "although the equation is not as simple as the equation , the computational test we performed shows that it is essentially more rapid in convergence .",
    "consequently , the asymptotic expansion series is the main result of this work .",
    "this application demonstrates that the incomplete cosine expansion of the sinc function that we have introduced earlier for sampling @xcite , can also be used as a flexible and efficient tool in mathematical analysis .",
    "we show that the incomplete cosine expansion of the sinc function can be used as a flexible and efficient tool in mathematical analysis .",
    "specifically , its application for the error function leads to the expansion series consisting of a sum of the gaussian functions .",
    "such an approach in integration provides a new asymptotic formula for the constant @xmath0 .",
    "the computational test we performed shows a rapid convergence of the proposed asymptotic formula . in particular , at integer @xmath12 equal to @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 and @xmath115",
    "it provides respectively @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath103 and @xmath108 coinciding digits with the reference value of @xmath0 .",
