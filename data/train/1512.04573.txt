    "_ baroreflex _ ( br ) is the main short - term blood pressure ( bp ) regulation mechanism of the cardiovascular system ( cvs ) .",
    "it aims to provide adequate perfusion of all tissues by maintaining blood flow and pressure at homeostasis by regulating heart rate ( hr ) , vascular resistance , compliance and other variables of the cvs . _",
    "cerebral autoregulation _ ( ca ) is a physiological mechanism which aims to maintain blood flow in the brain at an appropriate level during changes in bp .",
    "it is achieved by regulating cerebral arteriolar vessels to match the cerebral blood flow ( cbf ) with the metabolic demands of the brain .    although it has been known that both br and ca are central in maintaining appropriate cbf the functional relationship between the two mechanisms in humans is unknown . discerning the fundamental links between br function and cbf regulation is of clinical significance , because br impairment is a negative prognostic factor for cardiac and cerebrovascular disease @xcite .",
    "motivated by this we develop a mathematical framework aiming to simulate the effects of br on the cerebral blood flow dynamics .",
    "the novelty of the approach lies in inferring the neural activities ( sympathetic and parasympathetic ) from the hr model and integrating them with the haemodynamic model and the cbf regulation .",
    "the framework is based on the current understanding of the physiology underlying the regulation mechanisms ( both br and ca ) and allows to hypothesize the relative influence of sympathetic and parasympathetic firing rate on the cbf dynamics .",
    "the control of hr is an important aspect of br for maintaining homeostasis .",
    "typically , br is divided into an afferent part , a control center , and an efferent part @xcite .",
    "the firing rate of the afferent baroreceptor neurons is modulated by changes in the viscoelastic stretch of the nerve endings which are embedded in the arterial wall of the aorta and carotid sinuses .",
    "the sympathetic firing rate increases the concentration of noradrenaline ( nad ) via a slow pathway which , in turn , raises the hr .",
    "parasympathetic firing rate , on the other hand , increases the concentration of acetylcholine ( ach ) which is released through a slow and fast pathways that form the total concentration leading to a reduction of hr .",
    "figure  [ mod : hrm](a ) shows the block structure of the br regulation of hr model ( denoted hrm ) used here to infer the sympathetic @xmath2 and parasympathetic @xmath3 activities by fitting the hr prediction of hrm to human hr data . for more details and the basal values of the parameters",
    "see @xcite .     causes the changes in arterial wall strain and triggers a baroreceptor firing rate .",
    "the sympathetic @xmath2 and parasympathetic @xmath3 activities are generated within nts and are involved in the heart rate control by modulating the release of acetylcholine , from the vagal nerves , and noradrenaline from the postganglionic sympathetic nerves . _",
    "( b ) : _ _ haemodynamic model ( hdm ) . _",
    "electrical analogue of the cerebral haemodynamic and intracranial dynamics .",
    "( c ) _ cbf regulation mechanisms . _",
    "the schematic representation of the assumed interaction between hrm and hdm.,width=585 ]      figure  [ mod : hrm](b ) depicts electrical circuits representation of the haemodynamic model ( denoted hdm ) used in this work .",
    "it includes the arterial , capillary and venous compartments .",
    "this division reflect some fundamental functions played by each compartment such as regulation of cbf ( arteries ) , gas transport ( capillaries ) , regulation of cbv ( veins ) .",
    "the model assumes constant intracranial pressure , which is a reasonable assumption due to a relatively short time - series data used in our simulation .",
    "the autoregulation mechanism is achieved by changing the compliance @xmath4 ( discussed later in more detail ) which , in turn , changes the resistance of the small arteries @xmath5 .",
    "since that the objective of the present work is to show qualitatively the influence of br on ca , the computation of cbf via hdm can be thought of as performed in arbitrary units .",
    "this relative cbf ( denoted rcbf ) is computed as @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 is the cerebral blood pressure at the nodes @xmath9 and @xmath10 , see figure  [ mod : hrm](b ) .",
    "the venous @xmath11 and intracranial @xmath12 compliances as well as large arterial @xmath13 and large venous @xmath14 resistances are assumed constant .",
    "for the basal values of the parameters and other details see similar approaches employed previously in , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the flow of blood to the brain is modulated both by local and global mechanisms including neurovascular coupling , changes in arterial partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide , and the cbf feedback mechanisms .",
    "these regulatory responses act collectively to maintain cbf and oxygen supply to the brain amidst changes in arterial bp .",
    "figure  [ mod : hrm](c ) shows the conceptual model of the interaction between hrm and hdm , indicating the cbf regulation mechanisms implemented in our simulations . as a first step ,",
    "we assume here that the changes in partial pressure of oxygen and carbon dioxide are constant .",
    "the cbf feedback regulation is assumed to act with a delay via first order filter , with a time - constant @xmath15 , of the form @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the baseline value of the cbf and @xmath18 is the adjustable cbf feedback gain .",
    "the reduction of this gain can be interpreted as the impairment of the cbf regulation .",
    "following @xcite the neural - based cbf regulation mechanism is modeled as the second - order differential equation @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the two time - constants , and @xmath22 is the gain of the neural - based stimulation .",
    "the function @xmath23 combines the influence of sympathetic @xmath2 and parasympathetic @xmath3 activities and is modeled as the following weighted sum @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the normalized proportionality constants such that @xmath27 .",
    "this produces a quantity @xmath28 , which represents the neural - based contribution to the cbf regulation mechanism .",
    "the changes in arterial compliance will be influenced by a combination of the above regulatory responses , i.e. the cbf feedback @xmath29 and the neural - based @xmath28 .",
    "we consider here the simplest case by assuming that all the mechanisms act in a linearly additive way @xmath30 following @xcite the influence of all the contributions of the regulatory responses @xmath31 on the arterial compliance @xmath4 is modeled using an asymmetrical sigmoidal function with upper and lower saturation levels : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the baseline arterial compliance ; and @xmath34 ( resp .",
