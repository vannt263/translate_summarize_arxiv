    "strong - coupled relativistic quantum field theories ( rqft s ) play an essential role in any modern understanding of subatomic phenomena from the higgs mechanism to fundamental theories of nucleon and nuclear phenomena .",
    "there are important theoretical issues , such as spontaneous symmetry breaking , which can be studied with relatively simple scalar field theories .",
    "unfortunately , even the simplest interacting relativistic quantum field theories are notoriously difficult to solve .",
    "a classic example is the issue of triviality in 4-dimensional @xmath0 scalar field theory which has been tackled over the years using nearly the full complement of weapons in the theorists arsenal ( loop expansion , strong coupling- and @xmath5-expansions , truncated systems of schwinger - dyson ( sd ) equations , renormalization group ( rg ) techniques and monte carlo studies ) , _ without _ yielding a definitive answer .",
    "e.g. _ , ref.@xcite . )",
    "it is self - evident that accurate and relatively simple approximate methods for solving rqft s would be of enormous value .    in the present paper",
    "we discuss approximations to @xmath0 theories emphasizing throughout comparison with lattice monte carlo calculations which , in a sense to be made explicit below , we consider exact . in particular",
    "we will focus on the uniform properties which can be expressed in terms of `` effective potentials '' ( or more precisely , `` constraint effective potentials '' as defined , _",
    "e.g. _ , in ref.@xcite ) from which , for example , zero - momentum @xmath6-point couplings may be extracted .",
    "the present results may be summarized most succinctly by stating that the renormalization group ( rg ) effective potential ",
    "evaluated so as to account for lattice artifacts  provides a spectacularly accurate description of its lattice counterpart with little calculational complexity for a wide variety of scalar field theories including symmetric and broken phases in 2 , 3 , and 4-d with o(1 ) and o(2 ) symmetries .",
    "in contrast , other methods such as the use of truncated sd equations@xcite yield only qualitative agreement at best . moreover ,",
    "as will be emphasized below , the simple rg effective potential used here is known to be the first term in a momentum expansion meaning that systematic improvements in the approximation are possible .",
    "perhaps even more important is the evidence that  in contrast to , _",
    "e.g. _ , the hierarchy of sd equations  this expansion appears to be strongly convergent for cases with strong coupling .",
    "indeed , estimates of next - to - leading order correction to be made below are quite small but consistently improve the already extraordinary agreement with lattice results . finally , as will also be addressed below , the rg approach is ideally suited to the construction of _ effective _ low energy theories which can economically account for the long - wavelength behavior of the full theories .",
    "we will also discuss some anticipated exploitations of this possibility .",
    "in section ii we review briefly the history of the version of the rg effective potential used in the present work providing highlights and references to several other recent studies . in section iii",
    "we provide a heuristic derivation of the rg equation for the effective potential and compare with truncated schwinger - dyson . in section",
    "iv we describe the methods we use in extracting the effective potential from monte carlo simulations and in solving the rg equations numerically . in section v we present the results of our calculations comparing monte carlo and rg descriptions for broken and symmetric phases of o(1 ) and o(2 ) @xmath0 field theories in 3- and 4-dimensions .",
    "we now trace the development of the form of the rg equations used in the present study .",
    "the original work by wilson on the renormalization group@xcite was in essence a discussion of how to obtain the effective action at long wavelengths from a bare action at short wavelengths .",
    "he and his coworkers discussed a variety of approximations to the full ( and intractable ) rg equations . shortly thereafter , wegner and houghton@xcite derived an exact rg equation for the effective potential by integrating over thin shells in momentum space , a technique referred to as the `` sharp cutoff method . ''",
    "( see ref.@xcite for an early discussion of this and alternative `` smooth cutoff '' methods . also see ref.@xcite for early discussions of many rg concepts .",
    "ref.@xcite provides a later discussion of some of these ideas in the course of constructing a novel and intuitively appealing rg - based proof of the renormalizability of @xmath0 field theories . ) a seminal early application of the wegner and houghton method to @xmath0 theories was presented by hasenfratz and hasenfratz@xcite .",
    "( see also ref.@xcite  for an illuminating comparison of analyses of the cutoff dependence of the higgs mass using the wilson - based and wegner / houghton - based rg methods . )",
    "these authors obtained a tractable approximation to the exact wegner and houghton equation by projecting the full effective action onto an effective potential for which all @xmath6-point couplings are momentum independent .",
    "they used the resulting rg equation to extract information about rg flows in the vicinity of wilson and gaussian fixed points in @xmath1 and to establish the absence of a wilson fixed point in @xmath2 .",
    "they also extracted various critical exponents for the @xmath1 case and found them to be in good agreement with values determined by a variety of other techniques .",
    "there has been a recent resurgence of interest in rg effective potentials .",
    "wetterich and coworkers@xcite , for example , have extended the approach of hasenfratz and hasenfratz using the so - called `` smooth cutoff '' method in deriving their rg equations .",
    "their technique permits evaluation of , _",
    "e.g. _ , the anomalous dimension , @xmath7 , which is implicitly zero in the hasenfratz and hasenfratz approximation and yields values of critical exponents which are in impressive agreement with those determined by other methods .",
    "( see ref.@xcite for an early calculation of @xmath7 using an extension of one of wilson s original approximate rg equations . )",
    "this increase in calculational power comes , however , at the cost of a substantial increase in numerical complexity . in other work",
    ", morris@xcite  gives an in - depth discussion of the rg effective potential as derived using both sharp and smooth cutoffs .",
    "he also@xcite developes a version of the systematic momentum expansion alluded to above and presents an analysis of @xmath0 in @xmath1 using the first correction to what is in effect the hasenfratz and hasenfratz method ( which appears as the zero - momentum limit in both the sharp- and smooth - cutoff derivations ) . without attempting to be comprehensive , we mention other related papers which appear here as refs.@xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "derivations of rg equations for the effective action or their reduction to expressions governing the effective potential appear in refs.@xcite and will not be reproduced here .",

    "we have presented a discussion of the renormalization group ( rg ) effective potential for @xmath0 scalar field theories which stresses its relationship to the loop expansion and the schwinger - dyson ( sd ) method .",
    "we show in a simple way that the unique feature of the rg method  which is presumably the origin of its ability to describe the full theory as well as it does  is its self - consistency at all momentum scales . we have formulated a version of the rg equation for the effective potential which explicitly treats finite lattice effects so that rg calculations may be compared directly with lattice monte carlo ( mc ) calculations without extrapolations of the latter to infinite lattice size and zero lattice spacing ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references contained therein for some examples of such extrapolations ) .",
    "we compare such `` latticized '' or l - rg potentials along with standard continuum or c - rg potentials@xcite to constraint effective potentials obtained via mc methods .",
    "the l - rg effective potentials are in excellent quantitative agreement with the mc results for @xmath1 and @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 cases in both symmetric and broken phases .",
    "more specifically , we find that , upon adjusting the l - rg bare masses so as to yield renormalized masses equal to those found in the mc calculations , the l - rg bare masses never differ by more than 1.5% from the mc values and are typically much closer .",
    "the renormalized 4-point couplings found by solving the l - rg equations are also typically in close agreement with the mc values . in at least one case for which the mc effective potential was determined over a wide range of @xmath11 using windowing techniques , there is strong evidence that @xmath155 and higher contributions are also well accounted for in the l - rg approach . in another case , we showed that the l - rg approach works very well even when the correlation length is appreciably larger than the overall lattice size ( @xmath163 ) .",
    "comparison of c - rg calculations with the mc results was found to be ambiguous ; however , even when ambiguous parameters were tuned to give optimal agreement with the mc quantities , this accord was found to be inferior to that achieved using the l - rg without tuning .",
    "finally , latticized sd equations were seen to yield only a rough qualitative description of of mc masses and 4-point couplings .",
    "we conclude that the l - rg method provides an very accurate , relatively simple description of lattice mc calculations .",
    "it may prove to be a useful guide in extrapolating finite lattice results to the continuum limit since the relation between the l - rg and the c - rg is simple and well - defined .",
    "we may also be able to apply it to some specific problems of current interest such as accounting for the `` universal effective potential '' for @xmath0 field theories in @xmath1 recently obtained via mc techniques by tsypin@xcite .",
    "the success of the method encourages us to make various extensions of it .",
    "for example , we plan to go beyond the `` zero - momentum '' approximation so as to be able to compute wavefunction renormalizations@xcite .",
    "we have also begun to examine including yukawa - coupled fermions in the approach which would be a crucial step toward our long term goal of constructing effective theories of low - energy nuclear phenomena whose field theoretic structure is fully understood and for which we have an accurate and relatively simple approximation scheme of proven reliability .",
