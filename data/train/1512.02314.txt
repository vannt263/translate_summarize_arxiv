    "penzias and r.w .",
    "wilson accidentally discovered the cosmic microwave background ( cmb )  @xcite , confirming the big bang model , which had been proposed by g.  lematre in 1931  @xcite but was at first met with skepticism . the next year",

    "zatsepin and v.a .",
    "kuzmin  @xcite predicted that the cmb set a limit  @xmath1 to the energy with which protons from distant sources can reach us , due to photohadronic processes such as @xmath2  or  @xmath3 in which such protons would lose large fractions of their energy until back below  @xmath4 . in 1998 ,",
    "the agasa collaboration announced that their detector array had measured the energy spectrum of cosmic rays to be a power law with no cutoff up to  @xmath5  @xcite , spurring speculation about mechanisms that could allow protons to elude the gzk limit , but all later experiments , hires  @xcite , the pierre auger observatory  @xcite , and the telescope array  @xcite , do see a cutoff in the vicinity of  @xmath4 .",
    "pierre auger observatory data about shower maximum depth ( @xmath6 ) distributions , if interpreted according to models of hadronic interactions in the atmosphere tuned to lhc data , suggest that most cosmic rays with  @xmath7 are nuclei with mass numbers  @xmath8 with few if any protons  @xcite .",
    "if this is the case , interactions with background radiation become even more important , because , while the pion production threshold is shifted to @xmath9  times that for protons , photodisintegration interactions ( e.g.  @xmath10 ) are possible with both cmb and extragalactic background light ( ebl ) photons , with very short interaction lengths even at moderate energies ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : lambda_nuclei ] ) .",
    "( the telescope array collaboration continues to interpret their @xmath6  distributions as being compatible with a largely protonic composition at all energies  @xcite , but in the following we only discuss auger data because proton - only scenarios have already been extensively studied and are outside the scope of this work . a direct comparison of @xmath6  measurements by the two observatories taking into account the different fiducial cuts applied found no incompatibility between them  @xcite . )",
    "several monte carlo codes have been developed to simulate the propagation of uhecrs .",
    "the phenomena they take into account include the adiabatic energy loss due to the expansion of the universe , the electron ",
    "positron pair production  @xmath11 , the photodisintegration of nuclei , and pion production .",
    "two publicly available such codes are _",
    "simprop_. ]  @xcite and crpropa  @xcite , which are compared in ref .",
    "@xcite      some of the quantities relevant to the propagation of uhecrs are known with good accuracy ; these include the expansion of the universe ( described by the flrw metric ) , the spectrum and evolution of the cmb ( described by planck s law for a black body with temperature  @xmath12 ) , cross sections for pair production ( described by the bethe  heitler formula ) and pion production ( measured in collider experiments over a wide range of energies ) , and total photodisintegration cross sections for certain nuclides .    other quantities are poorly known and need to be approximated via phenomenological models , which do not always agree with the available data .",
    "they include the spectrum and evolution of the ebl and the branching ratios for the various photodisintegration channels .",
    "the effects of the uncertainty in these quantities on results of uhecr propagation simulations are discussed extensively in ref .",
    "two examples are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ebleffect ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : sigmaeffect ] , which show that all other things being equal a stronger far - ir peak in the ebl spectrum or larger cross sections for photodisintegration channels in which alpha particles are ejected would result in a softer spectrum and a lighter composition at earth .",
    "the pierre auger collaboration has presented  @xcite a combined fit to their spectrum  @xcite and @xmath6  @xcite data above  @xmath13 in a simple astrophysical scenario : uniform distribution of identical sources ; injection consisting of hydrogen-1 , helium-4 , nitrogen-14 and iron-56 only ; power - law injection spectrum with broken exponential rigidity cutoff , @xmath14 no hypothesis is made about the origin of the ankle and the uhecr flux below it .",

    ", the same fit was repeated with different monte carlo codes , ebl models , photodisintegration models , air interaction models , and with data shifted by their systematical uncertainties . as shown in table  [",
    "tab : params ] , the best - fit parameter values are strongly dependent on the model used , whereas the position of the local minimum at  @xmath39 is much more stable .",
    "also , in most cases models of propagation with lower interaction rates tend to result in better fits to auger data , as does shifting the energy and  @xmath6 scales downwards , and models of hadronic interactions other than epos - lhc are strongly disfavoured .    [",

    "if interpreted according to a simple astrophysical model of uhecr sources , pierre auger observatory data seem to point to very hard , metal - rich injection spectra .",
    "this result is qualitatively similar to recent phenomenological models by other authors @xcite , but is at odds with traditional theoretical models of uhecr acceleration , which predict  @xmath40 .",
    "another important result is that when injection spectra are hard , propagated spectra and compositions are strongly sensitive on poorly known details of interactions with background photons taking place during the propagation .",
    "most studies of uhecr propagation until recently disregarded our ignorance of these quantities .",
    "this was acceptable when such studies only considered soft injection spectra ( @xmath41 ) where the differences between various models have no major impact , but now that hard injection spectra ( @xmath42 ) are also commonly considered , this is no longer legitimate .",
    "possible refinements of this astrophysical model that could be made in the near future include considering more than four possible elements at injection , extending the fit to energies below the ankle , and considering non - uniform distributions of sources .",
