    "<S> [ multiblock footnote omitted ]        the continuous hull @xmath0 for a combinatorial pentagonal tiling defined in @xcite is written as an inverse limit of finite cw - complexes in @xcite . since cohomology reverses the arrows , and cech cohomology behaves well under inverse limits , the cech cohomology of the continuous hull is the direct limit of the cech cohomology of the finite cw - complexes . </S>",
    "<S> this direct limit is computed by using the fact that the cech cohomology of a finite cw - complex is the same as the cellular cohomology of the finite cw - complex , as the latter is easier to compute . </S>",

    "<S> we give an overview of direct limits of sequences of @xmath5-modules and integer matrices , plus some techniques to compute some of them . in the last section we compute the cech cohomology of the continuous hull @xmath0 using the formulas and definitions from the previous 3 sections . </S>"
