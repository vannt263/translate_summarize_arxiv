    "we distinguish spectroscopically between the cooler sdb stars ( @xmath3 ) showing hei lines and the hot sdo stars ( @xmath4 ) , with heii lines .",
    "recent work of @xcite suggests a strong correlation of the helium abundance with carbon / nitrogen line strengths . a physically more meaningful classification into ` helium - enriched sdo ' for stars with supersolar helium abundance and ` helium - deficient sdo ' for subsolar abundances is suggested .    while the sdbs form a homogenous group , the sdos show a wide spread in temperature , gravity and helium abundance .",
    "only a few stars are helium - deficient but the helium - enriched sdo stars are represented in great number .",
    "canonical theories see an evolutionary link between sdo and sdb stars , though the mechanism driving the hydrogen - rich sdb atmosphere into a helium - rich sdo in the course of stellar evolution is hard to explain .",
    "we are interested in the sdo stars , particulary their evolutionary status , their origins and possible evolutionary links between them and the cooler sdb stars .",
    "recent work in this field has been carried out by @xcite using the high resolution spectra of 46 sdo stars from the eso spy survey @xcite .",
    "we will take advantage of the huge database of the ongoing sloan digital sky survey which provides spectra of many different objects , among them a number of sdos . by comparing and combining our results with the results from @xcite",
    ", the sample size will be large enough to test rivalling theories for their origin and evolution",
    "from the database of the 5th data release ( dr5 ) of sdss , we selected all point sources within the colour box @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "we classified more than 8000 spectra by visual inspection , mostly white dwarfs , about 500 sdb stars and 112 sdos . after sorting out spectra with spectral features indicative of a cool companion star or of too low signal - to - noise",
    ", we carried out a spectral analysis of the remaining 86 of our programme stars .",
    "a model atmosphere fit was conducted in order to obtain the effective temperature , surface gravity and helium abundance .           to determine @xmath7 , @xmath2 and @xmath8 of the stars , we fitted synthetic model spectra to the observed ones , using a @xmath9-minimization procedure @xcite to derive all three parameters as well as the radial velocity simultaneously .",
    "the synthetic non - lte models were constructed using the pro2 code @xcite with a new temperature correction technique @xcite and include partially line blanketing .",
    "it includes h and he atoms only .",
    "the model grid ranges in temperature from 30000k to 100000k and from 4.8dex to 6.4dex for @xmath2 with @xmath10 .",
    "no extrapolation beyond the model grid was allowed . due to the inconsistencies reported for the h@xmath11-line of some sdb stars , which might be caused by a stellar wind @xcite",
    ", this line was never fitted to the models , but it was always plotted to search for peculiarities .",
    "h@xmath12 to h@xmath13 and heii4859 and 4339 were always fitted , but we found heii4100 often too weak to provide a reasonable fit .",
    "the ionization equilibrium of heii and hei is very sensible to temperature , therefore we always included hei4472 , even in its absence .",
    "the fit program provided us with mere statistical errors , they range from @xmath14 , depending on the signal  to  noise ratio .",
    "fortunately , six stars were observed twice ( see table .",
    "[ tab : error ] ) , which we can use to estimate the quality of our fits .",
    "the differences in parameters obtained from spectrum a and spectrum b lie within the given statistical errors , which we therefore conclude to be robust .",

    "we find that the ratio of helium - enriched stars to helium - deficient ones is higher in sdss than in spy ( 68:18 vs.  33:13 ) .",
    "in addition , the sdss sample contains more very hot stars ( @xmath15 ) than the spy sample .",
    "both findings are probably due to selection effects , e.g. the limiting magnitude of the surveys , which is considerably fainter for sdss than for spy . besides that",
    ", the distributions of the sdss and the spy sample in the @xmath7@xmath2 plane are very similar , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ img : hrd ] .",
    "we will therefore merge the samples for further discussion .",
    "none of the programme stars is located on the ehb , meaning that either they are post - ehb stars , most likely evolved from the sdb stars , or they do not have any link to the ehb at all and are just evolving through this region in the hr diagram .",
    "the helium - enriched sdos are spread over @xmath16 and @xmath17 , but a concentration of them within the small temperature interval @xmath0 becomes apparent , only a few stars are found to lie at hotter temperatures .",
    "the hydrogen - rich sdos on the other hand shun this region .",
    "note that both the sdss and the spy sample contains stars lying below the helium main sequence , all but one are helium - enriched .",
    "these stars can not sustain stable helium burning in their cores and therefore it is difficult to explain their origin .",
    "two different aproaches to hot subdwarf star evolution are presented in the literature : _ ( i ) _ binary star evolution and _ ( ii ) _ single star evolution .",
    "both are trying to explain the high mass loss the stars have to suffer from before reaching the ehb . in the context of binary star scenarios ,",
    "this is achieved by mass exchange in sufficiently close systems , whereas single star scenarios have to invoke physical mechanisms within the star itself , like unusually strong stellar wind , mixing , etc .",
    "@xcite did an extensive binary population synthesis and found three formation channels relevant for the sdb / sdo population : stable roche lobe overflow , common envelope ejection and a merging of two helium - core white dwarfs .",
    "while the first two scenarios result in relatively cool stars preferentially lying between 30000k and 40000k , our sdo stars are very unlikely to have followed the latter formation channel as they are mostly hotter .    for sdo stars , especially the helium - enriched ones , we regard the formation via a merging of two helium wds as most promising .",
    "short period binary wds will lose orbital energy through gravitational waves . with shrinking separation",
    ", the less massive object will eventually be disrupted and accreted onto its companion , leading to helium ignition .",
    "@xcite argue , that this merger product will result in a helium buring subdwarf showing an atmosphere enriched in cno - processed matter .",
    "this scenario therefore can explain these extremely helium - enriched sdos showing strong nitrogen lines in their atmospheres .",
    "however , @xcite find that , under the assumption of total angular momentum conservation , he+he wd merger do rotate faster than breakup velocity . a mechanism that enables the star to get rid of its angular momentum still has to be found .",
    "however , there is another possible origin for hot subdwarf stars .",
    "the sdb hd  188112 is reported to have a mass of @xmath18 , based on a hipparcos parallax measurement , too low to sustain core helium burning @xcite . such a star may have formed if mass transfer occured on the first red giant branch ( rgb ) and before the onset of core helium burning .",
    "apropriate tracks have been calculated by @xcite , who evolved a @xmath19 main sequence star as one component of a binary system through the rgb stage without ignition of helium to a helium star and eventually to a helium core white dwarf , under the assumption of mass transfer to the companion .",
    "the evolution of such stars with masses between @xmath20 and @xmath21 would lead straight through the observed sdo population , down to below the hezams .",
    "however , how compelling these findings may be , they suffer from a fundamental discrepancy : @xcite find that the fraction of radial velocity variable stars among the helium - enriched sdos is 4% at most .",
    "also , the predicted helium abundance is much lower than for the helium - enriched sdos suitable for this scenario and within the relevant mass range , no enrichment of the atmosphere with processed matter from the interior is predicted .      , @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( top to bottom ) . in the upper",
    "left two post agb tracks @xcite for @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( left to right ) are shown as well .",
    "they may explain a few of the very hot sdo stars .",

    "symbols as in fig .",
    "[ img : hrd].,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=49.0% ]    the canonical evolution theory considers sdo stars to be the progeny of the sdb stars irrespective of their helium content .",
    "thus a star reaching the ehb will evolve from the ehb towards the sdo regime with higher temperatures and eventually to the white dwarf cooling curve .",
    "such tracks have been calculated by @xcite .",
    "they started with a star at the tip of the rgb and calculated the minimum core mass needed to ignite helium burning , then added a small envelope .",
    "the needed core mass varies slightly and ranges from @xmath26 for supersolar to @xmath27 for subsolar metallicity , while the envelope mass is very small ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "still , the question for the cause of the mass loss remains unanswered . in fig .",
    "[ img : evo ] we compare three post - ehb evolution tracks to the observed distribution .",
    "they follow the evolution from the zero age horizontal branch , where core helium burning starts , to the terminal age horizontal branch , and beyond , for stars with 0.471 , 0.473 and 0.475 solar mass cores . because of the small envelopes , the post ehb evolution hydrogen shell burning is insignificant and therefore the star does not climb the agb ( abg manqu stars ) , but evolves through higher temperatures until eventually it settles on the white dwarf cooling curve .",
    "these post - ehb tracks cover the sdb regime as well as the lower gravity helium - deficient sdo stars at @xmath29 .",
    "this is consistent with the helium - deficient sdo stars being the descendents of the sdb stars .",
    "however , some of the hottest stars and in particular the helium - enriched stars which cluster at @xmath30 do not fit into this scheme .",
    "the very hot sdo stars may be explained as post - agb stars on their way to the white dwarf cooling curve .",
    "two such tracks calculated by @xcite are shown in fig .",
    "[ img : evo ] .",
    "but due to the very short evolutionary timescales ( @xmath31 from ejection of the planetary nebula to pre - white dwarf settling ) for the post - agb stars , we expect only a few such stars in our sample .    for the helium - enriched sdos on the other hand",
    ", we have to find another mechanism that explains both their distribution as well as the peculiar carbon / nitrogen line strengths in connection with the high helium abundances . @xcite and @xcite analyzed a scenario for stars called late hot flasher .",
    "they argue , that fast rotation of rgb stars could lead to mixing of helium into the envelope , resulting in a higher rgb peak luminosity and therefore to higher mass loss rates on the rgb .",
    "this will delay the helium flash until the star has left the rgb and is already descending on the white dwarf cooling curve .",
    "the delayed flash will induce mixing which will transport hydrogen into the helium burning core where it is burnt , resulting in a helium - enriched star with @xmath32 on or near the helium main sequence and enriched in carbon .",
    "we have plotted an evolutionary track resulting from a late hot flasher in fig .",
    "[ img : evo ] . also this track fails to reproduce the observed distribution , though the very late hot flasher scenario can explain stars below the helium main sequence .",
    "it is clear now , that the helium abundance and the @xmath7@xmath2 diagram alone can not answer the question as to the sdos origin .",
    "as different scenarios predict different abundance patterns in particular for carbon and nitrogen , we started with a carbon abundance analysis of high resolution spectra of the sdo stars from spy .",
    "the new models include ciii and civ in addition to hydrogen and helium .",
    "they were calculated and fitted to the observed spectrum using the same methods as descibed above .",
    "so far we have investigated seven helium - enriched sdos .",
    "all stars are slightly enriched in carbon , with @xmath33 , compared to the solar value of @xmath34 .",
    "however , when fitting the carbon lines , two stars showed a significant line broadening indicating projected rotational velocities of @xmath35 ( see fig .  [ img : c ] ) and @xmath36 , which is surprising as most sdb stars do not show @xmath37 ( see geier et al . , these proceedings ) . though low number statistics , this might be considered another hint pointing towards the assumption that sdb stars and helium - enriched sdo stars are two different populations that formed by different evolutionary paths .",
    "we have fitted synthetic nlte model spectra to 87 sdo spectra from the sdss database , using a @xmath9 technique .",
    "while the helium - enriched stars cluster in a relative small regime around @xmath30 , the helium - deficient sdo stars are widely spread .",
    "worth noting is a significant number of helium - deficient sdos _ below _ the helium main sequence , a fact that can not be explained by canonical evolution .",
    "preliminary results of a carbon abundance analysis shows slightly supersolar values for seven helium - enriched sdos .",
    "the higher @xmath38 we found in two of them compared to the very slowly rotating sdbs might be an additional support for the merger scenario .    by comparing the stars distribution in the @xmath7@xmath39 diagram to several evolutionary paths ,",
    "we conclude that most likely the helium - deficient sdo stars are the progenies of the sdb stars .",
    "the helium - enriched sdo stars still pose a problem : the late hot flasher scenario as well as the white dwarf mergers qualify as formation channels as they predict an enrichment of helium and carbon / nitrogen .",
    "the merger scenario is attractive because it can also naturally explain the absence of radial velocity variables ( close binaries ) amongst the helium - enriched sdos .",
