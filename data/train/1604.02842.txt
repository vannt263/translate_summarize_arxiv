    "the starting point of the results presented in this paper is the following question : +    _ can one design a system of interacting particles that converges in some suitable limit to the following system of nonlinearly coupled system of transport equations : _    _",

    "? here @xmath2 and @xmath3 refer to mass concentrations of some chemical species which are participating in a non - competitive manner in a joint transport process .",
    "the background of the question ( and interest of m. mimura ) is connected to the role pheromones play in influencing the aggregation phenomenon , one of the main survival mechanisms in insects , birds and animal colonies ; we refer the reader to @xcite for more on this context .",
    "it is worth noting the coupled structure of the transport fluxes resembles situations arising in cross - diffusion and thermo - diffusion .",
    "compare @xcite for the thermodynamical foundations of cross- and thermo- diffusion and @xcite for a nice paper illustrating the role of cross - diffusion mechanisms towards pattern formation in chemical systems .",
    "our own interest in this framework targets at the fundamental understanding of well - observed optimal self - organization behaviours ( e.g lane formation in counter - flows ) exhibited by the motion of pedestrian flows ( cf .",
    "e.g. @xcite and references cited therein ) .",
    "interestingly , due to the symmetry in the structure of the equations , the system ( [ eq : u ] )  ( [ eq : v ] ) admits a direct interpretation from the porous media theory point of view , which later turns out to be very useful in understanding mathematically the particle system origin of this transport problem .",
    "we assume that @xmath2 and @xmath3 denote two populations ( of pedestrians , ants , chemical species , etc . ) that like to travel together .",
    "think , for instance , of a pair of large families of individuals that wish to reach perhaps a common destination or target , under the basic assumption that besides some kind of social pairwise repulsion and adherence to the same drift there are no other interactions in the crowd made of the two populations .",
    "this basic situation can be modelled as a system of continuity equations @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the common drift to which the two populations adhere .",
    "the velocity vector @xmath5 is assumed now to comply with darcy s law @xmath6 in ( [ darcy ] ) , @xmath7 denotes the permeability coefficient ( usually a tensor for a heterogeneous region ) and @xmath8 is the total ( social ) pressure in the system .",
    "now , making the ansatz on the structure of the pressure @xmath9 and then summing up the above continuity equations , we obtain the system - , where for simplicity we take @xmath10 .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section [ sec : analytical ] , we provide some basic analytic understanding of - by transforming the system to an equivalent one , showing the local well - posedness , constructing a special class of solutions and proving the preservation of relative entropy and the consequences this has on the large - time behaviour of the system . in section [ sec : particle ] , we introduce a stochastically interacting many - particle system to approximate - . finally , section [ sec : numerical ] presents numerical illustrations of the particle system , indicating numerical evidence on the expected convergence .",
    "in this section , we provide a couple of analytical results on the continuum model .",
    "we first transform the system - to an equivalent one . using this transformation",
    ", we ensure in a straightforward way the local existence of classical solutions .",
    "in addition , we construct a special class of solutions and show remarkable properties of these solutions , especially concerning the preservation of the relative entropy .      defining @xmath11",
    ", we see that @xmath5 solves the following porous media - like equation : @xmath12 we transform the system - posed for @xmath13 into the following system for @xmath14 :    _ t w=_xx(w^2),w(0,x)=w_0(x),[eq : eqn for w ] + _ t u=_x(u w_x),u(0,x)=u_0(x).[eq : eqn for u ]    conversely , suppose that @xmath14 satisfies the system -",
    ". then @xmath15 , where @xmath16 , satisfies the original system - . therefore , the two systems are equivalent .",
    "the transformation has two advantages .",
    "first , the new system - is only one - sided coupled in the sense that one can solve independently to obtain @xmath5 , and then substitute to find @xmath2 from with @xmath5 given .",
    "second , is the famous boussinesq s equation of groundwater flow , while is the standard continuity equation .",
    "both equations have been studied extensively and have a rich literature .",
    "therefore , we can apply existing methods and techniques to handle them from the mathematical analysis point of view .",
    "let @xmath17 be a given velocity field and @xmath18 be a given function .",
    "we first seek solutions for the following general continuity equation @xmath19=0 \\mbox { with } f(x,0)=f_0(x).\\ ] ] we consider the following ordinary differential equation ( ode ) : @xmath20 the solution of this ode is @xmath21 .",
    "conversely , we also can regard @xmath22 as a function of @xmath23 , i.e. , @xmath24 , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the function [ lem : sol of continuity ] @xmath27 solves the continuity equation .",

    "* theorem 3.1 ) for the ( global ) existence of the boussinesq s solution and of the peano s theorem for the local existence of the characteristic trajectory .      due to the particular structure of the system - , namely being the boussinesq s equation and being the continuity equation , we are able to construct a special class of solutions .",
    "we consider a solution profile of quadratic functions for @xmath5 and then find @xmath2 accordingly .",
    "the idea of the former has been used before , see for instance  @xcite .",

    "if one considers non - negative solutions , then one should take the positive parts of these expressions .",
    "we observe that our original system is symmetric in the sense that if we swap @xmath2 and @xmath3 in - then the system remains unchanged .",
    "therefore , if the initial data @xmath33 and @xmath51 are equal , then it is expected that @xmath2 and @xmath3 will be equal at any later time , which is a necessary condition for uniqueness .",
    "two mathematical questions naturally arise at this point :    a.   how to prove equality of @xmath2 and @xmath3 rigorously ? b.   if @xmath33 and @xmath51 are not equal , can we still quantify the distance between @xmath52 and @xmath53 in terms of the initial data ?    in this section , we provide affirmative answers to these questions using the concept of relative entropy and the total variation metric .",
    "we generalise the results of this section ( and of the previous one ) to a more general system in section [ sec : generalisation ] .",
    "it will become clear that structure of the system matches nicely with the concept of the relative entropy .",
    "we now recall the definition of the relative entropy , the total variation metric , as well as a relationship between the twos .",
    "we refer the reader to the survey paper @xcite for more information .",
    "let @xmath54 and @xmath55 be two probability densities on @xmath56 .",
    "the relative entropy of @xmath57 with respect to @xmath58 is defined by @xmath59 the total variation distance between @xmath54 and @xmath55 is defined as @xmath60 note that the relative entropy is always non - negative and it is equal to @xmath61 if and only if @xmath62 .",
    "although it is not a distance ( it satisfies neither the triangle inequality nor the symmetry condition ) , it is a useful quantity to measure the difference between two probability measures and has been used extensively in the literature .",
    "in addition , it also provides an upper - bound for the total variation distance @xmath63 by pinsker s inequality , see for instance ( * ? ? ? * theorem 1.1 ) , as @xmath64    [ theo : rel entropy ] suppose that @xmath65 are classical solutions to the system - that decay sufficiently fast at infinity .",
    "then the function @xmath66 is constant , i.e. , for any @xmath67 it holds @xmath68    we calculate the time - derivative of @xmath66 as follows ( the time variable @xmath69 is dropped in the right - hand side for simplicity of notation ) @xmath70\\,dx\\notag",

    "in we have used integration by parts where the boundary terms vanish due to the assumption on the decay of the solution .",

    "heuristically , note that if @xmath73 and @xmath13 satisfies the system - , then so does @xmath75 . to guarantee the uniqueness , it follows that @xmath76 .",
    "theorem [ theo : rel entropy ] offers a much stronger result .",
    "this is a direct consequence of theorem [ theo : rel entropy ] ( or corollary [ cor : tv estimate ] ) .",
    "since @xmath73 , we have @xmath77 .",
    "then it follows from theorem [ theo : rel entropy ] that @xmath78 for all @xmath79 , which in turn implies that @xmath80 for all @xmath79 .",
    "it is worth noting that theorem [ theo : local existence w ] and theorem [ theo : rel entropy ] can be extended to a more general system of the form    _ t u=_x , u(0)=u_0(x),[eq : general 1 ] + _ t v=_x , v(0)=v_0(x)[eq : general 2 ] .    the transformed system for @xmath14 , where @xmath81 , now becomes    _ t w=_x(w_x",

    "if @xmath82 for some @xmath83 , then the equation for @xmath5 becomes @xmath84 this is the standard porous medium equation .",
    "hence , we can apply ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3.1 ) again ; thus theorem [ theo : local existence w ] still holds true .",
    "we now show that theorem [ theo : rel entropy ] can also be extended to general shapes of @xmath57 .",
    "[ theo : general rel entropy ] suppose that @xmath65 are classical solutions to the general system - that decay sufficiently fast at infinity .",
    "then the function @xmath66 is constant .",
    "similar computations as in the proof of theorem [ theo : rel entropy ] give @xmath85    we note that the common relation that makes the relative entropies in both theorem [ theo : rel entropy ] and theorem [ theo : general rel entropy ] vanish is @xmath86 tracing back this relation in the calculations , this property appears because of the combination of three ingredients : the formula of the relative entropy , the symmetry of the system , and the formulas of the continuity equations .",
    "the last two properties together form the structure of the system .",
    "a.   the continuity equations provide that @xmath87\\quad\\text{and}\\quad \\partial_t v=\\partial_x[v y],\\ ] ] b.   the symmetry of and means that @xmath88 ( so that if we swap @xmath2 and @xmath3 , the system is unchanged ) .",
    "in other words , we find that the relative entropy is constant essentially due to the structure of the system .",
    "in this section , we introduce a many - particle system that includes coupled weakly interacting stochastic differential equations .",
    "we formally show that the empirical measures associated to this system converge to solutions of the original system - .",
    "the rigorous proof will be given in a separate paper .",
    "we consider the following particle system : @xmath89 for @xmath90 , where @xmath91 are independent standard wiener processes , @xmath92 are a sequence of smooth functions which are chosen later on . note that the system in can be seen as a generalisation of the many - particle system arising in @xcite to our model of coupled interactions of two species .",
    "remark also that in @xcite , the authors studied similar systems but in the absence of the stochastic noise .",
    "we define the following empirical measures @xmath93    we now formally derive the system - in two steps :    1 .   _ hydrodynamic limit _ , as @xmath94 tends to infinity : @xmath95 where @xmath96 solves a system which depends on @xmath97 and with some viscous terms .",
