    "the nanoscale electronic disorder is a long standing problem in physics of cuprates .",
    "this problem has many aspects , among which the most important one is the influence of disorder on critical temperature @xmath6 . since the energy scale associated with pairing mechanism in cuo@xmath7 plane",
    "is believed to be universal , different out - of - plane defects are expected to influence @xmath6 differently.@xcite another important aspect is the nanoscale inhomogeneity of the local density of states ( dos ) measured by scanning tunneling microscope ( stm ) .",
    "this effect was mostly studied  @xcite in bi@xmath3sr@xmath3cacu@xmath3o@xmath5 . in this paper , we address theoretically the problem of the nanoscale charge inhomogeneity in cuprates , and a related issue of the hole mean free path .",
    "we focus on two single layer families of high-@xmath8 superconductors , la@xmath0sr@xmath9cuo@xmath10 and hgba@xmath3cuo@xmath4 , in which the density inhomogeneity has been quantified by nuclear quadrupole resonance ( nqr ) experiments .",
    "@xcite we also calculate the charge inhomogeneity in the surface layer of bi@xmath3sr@xmath3cacu@xmath3o@xmath5 .",
    "the nqr measures the energy splitting of nuclear levels induced by an electric field gradient at the nucleus .",
    "a hole in the 3d - shell of the cu ion gives a dominant contribution to the field gradient at the cu nucleus .",
    "the cu nqr frequency in cuprates is therefore very sensitive to the doping level and is directly proportional to the local hole concentration .",
    "the contribution of the 3d - hole to the field gradient is significantly compensated by contributions of holes located at nearby oxygens ,  @xcite therefore the slope of the nqr frequency versus doping varies among different cuprate families .",
    "it is widely accepted that the hole density distribution within the cuo@xmath3 layer in la@xmath0sr@xmath1cuo@xmath2 is very nonuniform , as it has been clearly demonstrated by measurements of @xmath11cu nqr spectra  @xcite .",
    "the observed broad nqr spectrum  @xcite unambiguously indicates a very inhomogeneous hole density profile in the bulk of the sample .",
    "the inhomogeneity is due to the doping mechanism , where sr substitutions of la ions create an effective coulomb defect very close to the conducting cuo@xmath3 plane . in a recent paper ,",
    "@xcite we have performed the hartree - fock simulation of the charge density distribution in la@xmath0sr@xmath1cuo@xmath2 , which shows a very inhomogeneous charge density profile at the nanometer scale , and reproduces the observed nqr lineshapes .    on the other hand",
    ", it is generally believed that hole density distribution in compounds doped by interstitial oxygens , such as hgba@xmath3cuo@xmath4 and bi@xmath3sr@xmath3cacu@xmath3o@xmath5 , is much more uniform than in la@xmath0sr@xmath1cuo@xmath2 .",
    "this is because the distance from the interstitial oxygen to the cuo@xmath3 layer is typically larger than the sr - layer distance in la@xmath0sr@xmath1cuo@xmath2 .",
    "however , cu nqr measurements in the single layer hgba@xmath3cuo@xmath4  @xcite as well as in the bilayer",
    "hgba@xmath3cacu@xmath3o@xmath12  @xcite show fairly large linewidths comparable to that in la@xmath0sr@xmath1cuo@xmath2 . as it will be demonstrated below",
    ", the nqr data imply the same degree of the hole density inhomogeneity in la@xmath0sr@xmath1cuo@xmath2 and hgba@xmath3cuo@xmath4 .",
    "we will also show that despite having similar amplitudes of the charge inhomogeneity , the spatial profiles of the density distribution are very different in these two cases : it is much smoother in the oxygen doped hgba@xmath3cuo@xmath4 .",
    "consequently , the forward scattering is predominant and the mean free path in hgba@xmath3cuo@xmath4 is substantially longer than that in la@xmath0sr@xmath1cuo@xmath2 .",
    "our simulation also indicates that the screening of the coulomb repulsion between the charge carriers in hgba@xmath3cuo@xmath4 is stronger .",
    "we argue that these two reasons might explain the difference in superconducting critical temperatures between these two compounds .",
    "the nanoscale charge density inhomogeneity in underdoped cuprates is an indirect way to distinguish the large fermi surface of a normal fermi liquid and the small fermi surface of a doped mott insulator .",
    "calculations in ref .   for la@xmath0sr@xmath1cuo@xmath2 were based on the small hole pocket fermi surface , which implies a small number of mobile charge carries .",
    "the small number of charge carries results in poor screening  @xcite and hence in the strong charge density inhomogeneity consistent with nqr data . on the other hand ,",
    "the large fermi surface implies the large number of mobile charge carriers and a very effective coulomb screening . in this",
    "case calculations give a very moderate charge inhomogeneity  @xcite , which is too weak to explain the observed nqr linewidths .",
    "another important point is that the charge inhomogeneity in the surface layer is always stronger than that in the bulk layer .",
    "this is because the surface ionic dielectric constant is about two times smaller than that in the bulk  @xcite .",
    "hence the screening at the surface is weaker and this results in the stronger charge inhomogeneity .    in this paper",
    ", we present hartree - fock calculations in underdoped cuprates with realistic parameters to simulate the bulk charge distributions in hgba@xmath3cuo@xmath4 and la@xmath0sr@xmath1cuo@xmath2 , and the surface charge distribution in bi@xmath3sr@xmath3cacu@xmath3o@xmath5 .",
    "our calculation covers from underdoped to optimally doped regime .",

    "this enables us to perform a very accurate comparison of hgba@xmath3cuo@xmath4 and la@xmath0sr@xmath1cuo@xmath2 .",
    "we find the charge inhomogeneity of a similar scale in both cases .",
    "however , the landscapes of spatial modulations and the hole mean free paths are substantially different .",
    "this is due to different positions of the dopant oxygen and the sr - ion relative to the cuo@xmath3 plane .",
    "in addition , the dielectric constants in these two compounds are different .    motivated by stm data  @xcite in bi@xmath3sr@xmath3cacu@xmath3o@xmath5 ,",
    "we calculate also the hole density distribution in the surface cuo@xmath3 layer of this compound .",
    "the results obtained show a large charge density inhomogeneity comparable to that in the bulk of hgba@xmath3cuo@xmath4 .",
    "naturally , the local charge density is highly correlated with the interstitial oxygen positions as has been noticed previously  @xcite .",
    "structure of the paper is the following : in sec .",
    "ii we formulate the effective model for an isolated cuo@xmath3 layer . because of the long - range nature of the coulomb interaction , however , the isolated layer approximation is not sufficient and one has to take into account other layers .",
    "the impact of the other layers depends on the way of doping and on structural details : whether this is a single layer or a double layer compound .",
    "the single layer la@xmath0sr@xmath1cuo@xmath2 and hgba@xmath3cuo@xmath4 are considered in section iii . in sec .",
    "iv we simulate the charge distribution on the surface of the double layer bi@xmath3sr@xmath3cacu@xmath3o@xmath5 .",
    "we also calculate the correlation function between the local charge density and oxygen dopant positions , and compare the result with the local dos correlation function measured by stm .",
    "our conclusions are presented in sec v.",
    "we adopt the effective model formulated in ref .   based on the picture of a lightly doped mott insulator . throughout the paper",
    "we denote the average hole concentration by @xmath14 and assume @xmath15 .",
    "the central point is that the number of charge carriers is @xmath14 instead of @xmath16 as one would expect for a normal fermi liquid .",
    "we consider first an `` isolated '' cuo@xmath3 layer .",
    "the `` isolated '' means that we disregard screening effects of the other layers .    to construct a model relevant to cuprates",
    ", we first notice that there are the following distinct length scales : ( _ i _ ) the scale of the order of 1 - 2 lattice spacing where the doped holes are dressed by multiple virtual magnons .",
    "( _ ii _ ) the scale about average separation between coulomb defects or average separation between holes @xmath17 .",
    "this is the scale of the coulomb screening .",
    "( _ iii _ ) the scale @xmath18 .",
    "the coulomb gap may develop at this scale due to anderson localization effects .",
    "regarding the first point , we do not treat the strong correlations explicitly , but instead adopt the effective hole dispersion after quantum fluctuations at short distances are included . to stress this point",
    ", we frequently use the term `` holon '' instead of `` hole '' .",
    "it is known that the holon dispersion has minima at momenta @xmath19 , and is approximately isotropic around these points  @xcite .",
    "the bandwidth of the holon is about @xmath20 , where @xmath21 mev is the superexchange in the @xmath22-@xmath23 model , although we do not directly employ the @xmath22-@xmath23 formalism .",
    "hereafter we set the following energy and distance units @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the lattice spacing of the cuo@xmath3 plane . to imitate the holon dispersion we consider spinless fermions on a 2d square lattice .",
    "the hamiltonian reads as follows : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the holon creation operator at site @xmath28 , and @xmath29 denotes the next - next - nearest - neighbor hopping on the square lattice .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ ht ] ) yields the following dispersion @xmath30 the dispersion is isotropic around minima at @xmath19 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : disp ] .    ) . ]",
    "we choose @xmath31 to reproduce the realistic holon band width , about @xmath20 , as obtained from numerical simulations of the @xmath32 model .",
    "@xcite an additional argument supporting this value is as follows .",
    "near its minimum the dispersion ( [ ht ] ) can be expanded as @xmath33 , so the holon effective mass is equal to @xmath34 .",
    "the value @xmath31 results in the effective mass @xmath35 which is close to the effective mass measured in magnetic quantum oscillation experiments  @xcite . the realistic holon band width and the realistic effective",
    "mass justify our choice of @xmath31 .",
    "we note also that in the original @xmath22-@xmath23 model formalism , there are four holon half - pockets inside magnetic brillouin zone , and each pocket has two pseudospins  @xcite ; in the present model , we consider four full pockets inside the full brillouin zone with spinless fermions , hence the number of _ charge _ degrees of freedom is exactly the same .",
    "@xcite    even though the holes are heavily dressed by magnetic fluctuations , their charge is conserved and hence they interact with coulomb defects via the ordinary coulomb potential : @xmath36 here @xmath37 is position of the holon and @xmath38 is the in - plane projection of the coulomb defect ( sr - ion or dopant oxygen ) position .",
    "the distance from the plane to the defect is @xmath39 , and @xmath40 is the size of the zhang - rice singlet .",

    "@xmath41 depends on the compound , and we discuss its precise values later .",
    "holon - holon coulomb interaction is of a similar form @xmath42 where @xmath43 stands for the combined size of two zhang - rice singlets .",
    "the total hamiltonian @xmath44 describes the in - plane coulomb problem .",
    "since the coulomb interaction is not very strong , we solve the many - body problem with the hamiltonian ( [ h_total ] ) using the standard hartree - fock method .",
    "in other words we use the hartree - fock decomposition of the coulomb interaction between holons : @xmath45 this can be done for zero as well as for finite temperatures , as it is described in ref .  .",
    "the above formulation would solve the coulomb problem for the `` isolated '' cuo@xmath3 layer .",
    "however , the layer is always embedded in a multilayer structure , and because of the long - range nature of the coulomb interaction , we have to take into account other layers .",
    "their influence depends on the lattice structure . in the next section",
    ", we consider two different families of single layer cuprates .",
    "we treat a particular cuo@xmath7 plane using the hartree - fock ( hf ) method .",
    "the role of other cuo@xmath7 planes is to provide screening of the coulomb interaction in the hartree - fock analysis . since cuo@xmath7 planes have a very high longitudinal polarizability we consider the `` other planes '' as purely metallic .",
    "it has been shown in ref .   that this `` metallic approximation '' is valid at @xmath48 when the polarizability is sufficiently high . within this approximation",

    "coulomb defects in la@xmath0sr@xmath1cuo@xmath2 are created by sr substitution for la ions .",

    "the planar positions of defects are assumed to be random , and defects are assumed to sit above the center of the cu plaquette .",
    "in addition , in each defect layer we impose a condition that defects never sit next to each other , i.e. , the distance between defects is always larger than @xmath54 .",
