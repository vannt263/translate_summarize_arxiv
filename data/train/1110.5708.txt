    "recent x - ray observations have revealed many ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) , i.e. , non - nuclear point sources in nearby galaxies with x - ray luminosities in the range of @xmath4 - @xmath5 erg s@xmath6 ( fabbiano 1989 ; colbert & mushotzky 1999 ) . some ulxs may well be foreground stars or background agn / qsos projected into the host galaxies ( e.g , gutirrez 2006 ) , or recent supernovae ( e.g. , sn1993j in m81 ) .",
    "most ulxs , however , should be intermediate mass black holes ( imbhs ) of 1001@xmath7 radiating at sub - eddington levels , or stellar mass black holes with special radiation mechanisms , such as relativistic beaming ( georganopoulos et al .",
    "2002 ) , beaming effects ( king et al . 2001 ) or truly super - eddington emission from magnetized accretion disks with photon bubbles ( begelman et al .",
    "x - ray spectroscopy and x - ray quasi - periodic oscillation behaviors may support the interpretation for imbhs for some ulxs ( e.g. , strohmayer & mushotzky 2003 ; liu & di stefano 2008 ) .",
    "however , the x - ray spectra might be explained otherwise such as the very high state of stellar mass black holes under super - critical accretion ( gladstone et al .",
    "2009 ) , and the qpo argument is also inconclusive given our poor understanding of the qpo behaviors .",
    "whether ulxs are imbhs can only be securely addressed by measuring their dynamical masses .",
    "the dynamical mass measurement is a well - defined process and requires that we ( 1 ) identify the secondary unambiguously in the optical and derive the secondary properties , ( 2 ) obtain the orbital period @xmath8 and the inclination angle @xmath9 from the light curve , and ( 3 ) measure the radial velocity half - amplitude @xmath10 of the secondary with optical spectroscopy .",
    "the resulting mass function @xmath11 will set the lower limit for the black hole mass @xmath12 .",
    "the black hole mass can be further determined if we know the inclination angle @xmath9 and the secondary mass @xmath13 .",
    "so far , about 20 ulxs were identified in the optical with unique or multiple counterparts mostly through registering chandra x - ray positions onto hst images ( e.g. , liu et al .",
    "2002 , 2004 ; roberts et al .",
    "2008 ) . for ulx counterparts ,",
    "it is impractical to measure the radial velocity with the shallow narrow photospheric absorption lines from the secondary given their optical faintness ( v@xmath1422 mag ) due to their location in distant galaxies . instead",
    ", we must resort to strong emission lines to determine the radial motion .",
    "strong emission lines can come from the ulx secondary if the secondary is a wolf - rayet ( wr ) star .",
    "most recently , the secondary of m101-ulx1 is identified and spectroscopically confirmed as a wr star with strong he ii @xmath0 and he i @xmath15 emission lines ( liu 2009 ) , and keck / gemini spectroscopic monitoring programs ( pi : liu ) are under way to determine the radial velocity half - amplitude @xmath10 of the secondary and ultimately the black hole mass .",
    "however , m101-ulx1 is the only ulx with a wr secondary , and may not be representative of the class .",
    "strong emission lines are expected from the x - ray photoionization of the accretion disk for ulxs with high x - ray luminosities above a few @xmath16 erg / s .",
    "indeed , emission lines are observed for low - mass x - ray binaries during outbursts with x - ray luminosities above only a few @xmath17 erg / s .",
    "the black hole mass can be derived from @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the radial velocity semi - amplitude of the black hole as measured from the disk emission lines .",
    "the explanation of the ulx optical observations is complicated by the x - ray irradiation of the accretion disk and the side of the secondary facing the primary , which becomes very significant for ulxs .",
    "indeed , the x - ray irradiated accretion disk can overwhelm the secondary itself by a factor of @xmath20 in x - ray outbursts of galactic low mass x - ray binaries ( van paradijs & mcclintock 1994 ) .",
    "kaaret & corbel ( 2009 ) claimed , based on the spectral slopes and other features of their vlt / fors spectra , that the optical light from an ulx in ngc 5408 mainly comes from an x - ray irradiated accretion disk .",
    "if x - ray irradiation is unimportant , and periodic modulations come from the orbital motion of the binary with its tidally distorted secondary , one expects a smooth ellipsoidal light curve with two maxima and two unequal minima .",
    "the deeper minimum comes from the heavily gravitationally darkened side of the secondary close to the l1 point ( hereafter the l1 side ) , the shallower minimum comes from its antipodal side , while the two maxima come from the other two sides .",
    "if x - ray heating of the l1 side of the secondary is so significant as to boost it from the darkest to brightest side , then one expects a sinusoidal light curve with one maximum from the x - ray heated side , and one minimum from its antipodal side .    in this work",
    ", we describe our efforts to constrain the black hole mass and the secondary simultaneously for ngc 1313 x-2 through the detected light curves and the radial velocity changes of the disk emission line . the light curve for ngc 1313 x-2 is largely sinusoidal with an amplitude of @xmath21 = 0.2 mag ( liu et al .",
    "2009 ) , and the x - ray irradiation must be significant .",
    "the x - ray irradiated binary model used to fit the light curves is described briefly in  2 , with details given in the appendix .",
    "the constraints on the black hole mass and other parameters are derived based on @xmath22 minimization as described in  3 .",
    "the results are discussed in  4 .",
    "a model with x - ray irradiation properly included should be developed to get dynamical parameters of ulxs from the optical spectra and light curves . in such a black hole binary model ,",
    "the secondary star should fill a significant part of its tidally distorted pear - like roche lobe to provide the high accretion rates required by the high x - ray luminosity ( king et al .",
    "many models of close binaries have been developed to model the ellipsoidal light curves without x - ray irradiation ( see the review by wilson 1994 ) .",
    "one example is the eclipsing binary light curve code ( elc ; orosz & hauschildt 2000 ) , which fits the wide - band photometric light curve and the radial velocity curve to get the dynamical parameters .",
    "copperwheat et al .",
    "( 2005 ) developed an x - ray irradiated black hole binary model with the secondary surface approximated as black body emitters , which predicts the wide - band photometry but not the spectrum for ulx optical counterparts . to fully utilize the optical spectroscopic and photometric monitoring observations of ulxs ,",
    "we have developed a computer code to model both the spectrum and the photometry from the x - ray irradiated black hole binary with the ( x - ray heated ) secondary described by kurucz stellar atmospheres .    in constructing",
    "the x - ray irradiated close binary model , we described the tidally distorted secondary following kopal ( 1954 ) and lucy ( 1967 ) , treated the accretion disk as a standard disk ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) that can be fattened due to x - ray irradiation , modeled the x - ray heating of the disk and the secondary surface following frank , king & raine ( 2002 ) , and described the x - ray heated secondary following kurucz stellar atmosphere models .",
    "we tried not to just patch up existing code segments , but wrote the computer code in c from scratch .",
    "the model construction is detailed in the appendix , so that one can rewrite the code if one so wishes .",
    "this model has 10 parameters , including five parameters to set up the binary model without x - ray irradiation : ( 1 ) the black hole mass @xmath23 , ( 2 - 3 ) the secondary s iitial mass and age which determine its mass ( @xmath24 ) , radius ( @xmath25 ) and temperature ( @xmath26 ) , ( 4 ) the fraction ( @xmath27 ) the secondary fills its roche lobe by volume , and ( 5 ) the inclination angle @xmath28 .",
    "five extra parameters are required to incorporate the x - ray irradiation : ( 6 ) the x - ray luminosity @xmath29 , ( 7 ) the disk thickness , as described by a fattening factor @xmath30 relative to a standard disk , ( 8) the disk size , as described by a factor @xmath31 relative to its maximal tidal - disruption radius , ( 9 ) the disk albedo @xmath32 , and ( 10 ) the x - ray to thermal conversion factor @xmath33 on the x - ray heated secondary surface .    given the parameters , the model first sets up the binary geometry , computes the secondary and disk temperature profiles with and without x - ray irradiation , then computes the emergent spectrum and the magnitudes for a binary phase @xmath34 . for illustration purposes",

    "ngc 1313 x-2 has been studied extensively both in the x - ray and the optical to understand its companion and environments .",

    "unfortunately , there is no evidence for a sinusoidal radial velocity curve , and the data does not provide a new , solid constraint on the mass function for ngc 1313 x-2 . based on the detailed analysis by gladstone et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , the @xmath53 rms scatter of the velocity shift is @xmath54 km / s .",

    "the secondary has a surface temperature of @xmath162 and is significantly affected by the x - ray heating , leading to sinusoidal light curves with amplitudes of 0.157/0.157 mag in the b / v bands for the inclination angle of @xmath163 ( fig  9 ) .",
    "models in the third group occupy roughly similar phase space as compared to the case of @xmath59 km / s , while the secondaries are older and less massive .",
    "the best model ( model  f3 , @xmath164 ) contains a @xmath165 black hole and a 220 myrs old secondary ( initially 3.58@xmath2 , currently 3.57@xmath2 , 9.8@xmath147 ) in its helium core and hydrogen shell burning phase filling its roche lobe .",
    "the x - ray luminosity is @xmath119 erg / s ( @xmath140 ) .",
    "the secondary has a surface temperature of @xmath166 and is significantly affected by the x - ray heating , leading to sinusoidal light curves with amplitudes of 0.156/0.156 mag in the b / v bands for the inclination angle of @xmath167 ( fig  9 ) .",
    "the accretion disk is 28% of the tidal - disruption radius and 6 times thicker than the standard thin disk , and the x - ray heated disk contributes about 2 times that of the secondary in the b / v bands .",
    "the best models for the three cases are listed in table  1 .",
    "to summarize , there are three groups of acceptable models based on the secondary properties depending on whether the secondary is in the carbon core and helium shell burning phase or in the helium core and hydrogen shell burning phase , and whether the secondary is filling the roche lobe or just part of the roche lobe .",
    "the first group of models with secondaries in the carbon core and helium shell burning phase , while acceptable for the highest @xmath59 km / s , become unacceptable when @xmath58 drops .",
    "models of the other two groups , with secondaries in the helium core and hydrogen shell burning phase , are acceptable for all cases of assumed @xmath58 , but the black hole mass can become as massive as 1000@xmath2 as the assumed @xmath58 becomes lower as shown in figure  10 .",
    "we note that , while the extinction value is started to range from 0.11 mag to 0.44 mag , it is always close to e(b - v)=0.11 mag for all three groups of `` acceptable '' models regardless the assumed @xmath58 as shown in figure  4f/6f/8f .",
    "in this work , we constrain the binary masses and other parameters for ulx ngc 1313 x-2 by fitting observations to an x - ray irradiated binary model .",
    "the model is based on the eclipsing binary light curve code by jerome orosz ( orosz & hauschildt 2000 ; orosz et al .",
    "2007 ) with accommodations for the x - ray irradiation of the accretion disk and the secondary in the ulx systems .",
    "this model treats the accretion disk as a standard disk that can be fattened due to x - ray irradiation .",
    "the disk fattening factor should be linked to the x - ray luminosity ; however , the exact relation is not well studied , and for now these two parameters are allowed to vary independently in our model .",
    "the x - ray heating of the disk and the secondary surface is treated the same way as in the cases of galactic x - ray binaries ( vrtilek et al .",
    "1990 ; fkr2002 ; copperwheat et al . 2005 ) with two parameters , disk albedo @xmath32 and the x - ray - to - thermal conversion factor @xmath33 , respectively . while @xmath32 and @xmath33 can be calculated given the disk / secondary surface structure and incident flux , such calculations are beyond the scope of this work , and we simply allow them to vary between 0 and 1 exclusive . the model describes the ( x - ray heated ) secondary surface with kurucz stellar atmosphere model , allowing to calculate the emergent spectrum with absorption lines from the secondary .",
    "ngc 1313 x-2 is chosen for this study because it is so far the only ulx with the orbital period , b / v light curves and the black hole s radial velocity amplitude .",
    "our hst go program has obtained the b / v light curves and an orbital period of @xmath168 days for ngc 1313 x-2 ( liu et al . 2009 ) , while the black hole s radial velocity amplitude is measured from the disk emission line heii @xmath0  ( pakull et al .",
    "2006 ; roberts et al .",
    "2010 ; gladstone et al .",
    "the observed heii @xmath0  shift may deviate from the true amplitude for the black hole ( e.g. , due to the emission line genesis location change under different x - ray luminosities ) , as implied by the phase shift between the radial velocity curve and the light curve often seen in galactic accreting binaries .",
    "indeed , a comprehensive study shows that the semi - amplitude measured with disk emission lines can differ from the true value by a factor of 0.9@xmath462.5 ( cantrell & bailyn 2007 ) .",
    "the black hole mass measurements based on the disk emission lines are thus considered less reliable as compared to those based on absorption / emission lines from the secondary , and not commonly used for galactic black hole binaries given the detectability of absorption or bowen fluorescent lines from their secondaries . for most ulxs with their faint optical counterparts , however , the disk emission line method is the only way to estimate the black hole masses , with an accuracy that is not superb but enough to determine whether they are stellar mass black holes or imbhs .",
    "dynamical models for ngc 1313 x-2 are sought with the monte carlo sampling of the parameter space followed by two rounds of amoeba searches of @xmath22 minima . given that the observed he ii @xmath0  emission line shift ( @xmath169 km / s ) can be 0.9 - 2.5 times that of the true radial velocity amplitude of the black hole ,",
    "the true amplitude can be @xmath46200 - 70 km / s .",
    "we thus have tested cases of @xmath59 km / s and @xmath143 km / s , and additional case of @xmath156 km / s . while the model parameters are allowed to vary in ranges as large as possible to not miss any acceptable models , the available observations are able to exclude most of the parameter space .",
    "for example , the extinction value is found to be e(b - v ) = 0.11 mag for all acceptable models with @xmath170 regardless the assumed @xmath58 values , although it is allowed to vary between 0.11 and 0.44 mag .",
    "interestingly , independent measurements with nebular lines showed that e(b - v ) = 0.11 mag ( pakull et al .",
    "2006 ) , justifying our model fits .",
    "when x - ray irradiation parameters @xmath32 , @xmath33 and the dependency of the disk thickness on the x - ray luminosity are further constrained by physical considerations , some acceptable models may become unacceptable .",
    "however , no unacceptable models can become acceptable given such additional constraints .    while @xmath171 for the true model is expected when there are only poisson errors for the photometric measurements , all models obtained from the fitting have @xmath172 .",
    "this is because the hst light curves of ngc 1313 x-2 are afflicted with photometric fluctuations caused by , e.g. , x - ray variations between observations . such photometric fluctuations are clearly present as shown in figure  5d , even after we exclude five f555w observations with abnormally red colors that exhibit extremely large deviations from the fitted sinusoidal light curve .",
    "we thus do not claim one `` true '' model , but instead consider models with @xmath170 as `` acceptable '' models , which fall into three groups based on the secondary properties .",
    "the first group of models have 4 - 5 myrs old secondaries in the carbon core and helium shell burning phase filling only 20% of its roche lobe , the second group of models have 40 - 50 myrs old secondaries in the helium core and hydrogen shell burning phase filling 40%-80% of its roche lobe , while the third group have 150 - 220 myrs old secondaries in the helium core and hydrogen shell burning phase filling its roche lobe .",
    "the acceptable models can be further assessed with additional constraints .",
    "the first group of models have x - ray luminosities of 1 - 2 @xmath113 erg / s , or 2 - 6 times the eddinton luminosity , yet the accretion disks are as thin as the standard thin disk .",
    "this contradicts the understanding that a standard disk forms under a few tenths of the eddington luminosity based on observations of galactic black hole x - ray binaries ( remillard & mcclintock 2006 ) .",
    "eso / vlt and subaru studies show that the stellar environment around ngc 1313 x-2 is about 40 - 70 myrs old ( pakull et al .",
    "this is quite consistent with the secondary age of 40 - 50 myrs for the second group , but significantly different from the secondary age of 150 - 220 myrs for the third group and the secondary age of 4 - 5 myrs for the first group .",
    "thus , the second group of models are the only possible models given the dynamical constraints , the reasonableness of the accretion disk , and the observed stellar environment age .",
    "concerns arise whether the secondaries in the second group can provide the required accretion rate to power the observed x - ray luminosity . unlike the third group where secondaries are filling the roche lobe ,",
    "the black holes in the second group must accrete via capturing the focused stellar winds from the secondaries that are only filling 40%-80% of the roche lobe .",
    "the stellar wind mass loss rate for the these secondaries is usually around @xmath173 based on the de jager et al .",
    "( 1988 ) prescription , but the observed average x - ray luminosity of @xmath174 erg / s requires an accretion rate of @xmath175 regardless the black hole mass .",
    "however , the de jager et al .",
    "prescription describes stars in isolation , while the secondaries in the second group are in a close binary configuration , where the equivalent surface gravity is reduced by the gravitational pull exerted by the companion black hole .",
    "numerical calculations have shown that the mass loss rate due to this reduced surface gravity can be boosted by more than an order of magnitude if the secondary is almost filling its roche lobe ( frankowski & tylenda 2001 ) .",
    "in addition , the strong x - ray radiation from the accretion disk will heat up the secondary surface and increase the kinetic energy of the surface materials , and possibly enhence the mass loss further .",
    "the black hole mass for ngc 1313 x-2 ranges from a few to above 1000 @xmath2 depending on the true radial velocity amplitude of the black hole .",
    "figure  10 shows the black hole mass versus the black hole radial velocity semi - amplitude for all acceptable models from this work , with larger symbols for more likely models of lower @xmath22 values .",
    "the black hole mass can be 3 - 10 @xmath2 ( e.g. , model b1 ) if @xmath19 = 120 - 140 km / s , or 20 - 30 @xmath2 if @xmath19 = 65 - 75 km / s , or 30 - 50 @xmath2 ( e.g. , model b2 ) if @xmath19 = 40 - 60 km / s .",
    "if the true radial velocity semi - amplitude is lower than 40 km / s , the black hole mass can be a few @xmath2 ( e.g. , model b3b as listed in table  1 ) , a few @xmath176 , a few @xmath177 ( e.g. , model b3 ) , or above 1000 @xmath2 .",
    "while the death of stars with solar metalicity can not produce black holes more massive than 10@xmath2 ( fryer & kalogera , 2001 ) , ngc 1313 x-2 is located in an environment of 0.1 - 0.2@xmath178 ( ryder 1993 ) , and a black hole up to @xmath179 may be produced .",
    "indeed , massive black holes have been discovered in environments of similarly low metalicities , e.g. , the black hole of @xmath180 for m33 x-7 ( orosz et al .",
    "2007 ) , and the black hole of 23 - 35 @xmath2 for ic 10 x-1 ( silverman & filippenko 2009 ) . therefore , ngc 1313 x-2 can be a black hole of up to a few @xmath176 that may be explained by the stellar evolution of low metalicity stars , or an imbh of a few @xmath181 or above @xmath182 if the true black hole radial velocity semi - amplitude is more than 5 times lower than the observed velocity shift .",
    "such imbhs can not be produced through the death of stars , but may form in the centers of dense stellar clusters via the merging of stellar mass black holes ( e.g. , miller & hamilton 2002 ) , or from the direct collapse of merged supermassive stars in very dense star clusters ( e.g. , portegies zwart & mcmillan 2002 ) .",
    "further observations are required to determine whether ngc 1313 x-2 is a massive stellar black hole or an imbh .",
    "current observations use the heii @xmath0  disk emission line to constrain the radial motion of the black hole , which is difficult due to the weakness of the line , the line genesis location change and the contamination from the surrounding nebula .",
    "such complications can be circumvented if uv emission lines are used to measure the radial velocity shift , because the uv emission lines are usually two orders of magnitudes more luminous than the heii @xmath0  line .",
    "for example , x - ray illuminated disk and corona model predicts that the line luminosities for n v @xmath183 , si iv @xmath184 , and c iv @xmath185  are 390 , 186 , 373 times that of heii @xmath0 , quite consistent with observations of several x - ray binaries ( raymond 1993 ) .",
    "the model also shows that the heii @xmath0  line is produced mostly in the inner disk region , a small region that is easily affected by small changes in the accretion rate or x - ray luminosity , resulting in line genesis location changes and apparent line centroid changes .",
    "in contrast , the above uv emission lines are produced across the whole disk , and are less affected by small changes in the accretion rate or x - ray luminosities .",
    "this reduces the line centroid changes due to x - ray luminosity changes as compared to the heii @xmath0  line .",
    "in addition , these uv emission lines can not form in the surrounding nebula , thus are free of nebular contamination .",
    "observations of these uv emission lines can be carried out with cosmic origin spectrograph ( cos ) aboard hubble space telescope .",
    "better light curves are also required to determine whether ngc 1313 x-2 is a massive stellar black hole or an imbh .",
    "given the better determined radial motion of the black hole , the black hole mass can still range from a few to a few @xmath186 to a few @xmath187 to above @xmath182 . although all models have similar light curves in the hst f450w",
    "/ f555w bands as resulted from the @xmath22 minimization process , the predicted light curves can be quite different in other bands given the difference in the secondaries , the inclination angles and the x - ray heating effects .",
    "as shown in figure  11 as examples , the predicted light curves of model b3 and b3b for @xmath188 km / s , while similar in wfpc2 f450w / f555w bands , are offset by 0.04 in the wfc3/uvis f275w band and by 0.02 mag in the wfc3/uvis f814w band .",
    "such difference can be easily detectable with hst with reasonable exposure time , and can be used to distinguish between a stellar black hole ( model b3b ) and an imbh ( model b3 ) . because the x - ray heating of the accretion disk and the secondary surface are important in these models , the photometric monitoring observations should be accompanied by quasi - simultaneous x - ray observations with , e.g. , swift / xrt , in order to assess the x - ray heating effects of the light curves .",

    "in such a model , the star contributes 70%-60% of the light in the u - i bands , the un - x - ray - irradiated disk contributes 15%-20% , and the x - ray irradiation of the disk contributes the rest 15%-20% .",
