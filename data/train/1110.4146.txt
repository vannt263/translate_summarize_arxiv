    "the primitive chain network ( pcn ) model @xcite is a slip - link type mesoscopic coarse - grained model for entangled polymeric systems@xcite . to simulate rheological properties efficiently ,",
    "the pcn model represents entangled polymers as a network like structure of which topology dynamically changes .",
    "simulations based on the pcn model can reproduce rheological properties of entangled polymers well with relatively small computational costs , and it has been applied various systems including branched polymers@xcite or bidisperse polymers@xcite . although the pcn model achieved success to predict various rheological behaviours of entangled polymers , its statistical properties are still not fully understood .    in recent years , various primitive path analysis methods@xcite have been developed to extract statistical properties of network structures in entangled polymers quantitatively from atomistic or coarse - grained molecular models ( such as the molecular dynamics simulations ) .",
    "it is an interesting question whether the extracted statistical data agree with ones obtained by the pcn model , to discuss consistency or relation between the models .",
    "quite recently , the network statistics of the pcn model were systematically examined@xcite .",
    "the statistical properties of the pcn model are shown to be qualitatively in agreement with primitive path analysis data .",
    "however , the analysis is conducted only for simulation results , and from the theoretical view point , how the network statistics is determined in the pcn model is still not clear .",
    "the pcn model is a dynamical model which is constructed in a rather phenomenological way .",
    "this makes theoretical analysis for the equilibrium statistics of the pcn model difficult .",
    "moreover , the thermodynamic validity of the pcn model is not guaranteed from the view point of the statistical mechanics .    to achieve the thermal equilibrium state ,",
    "the detailed balance condition is required to be satisfied .",
    "if the detailed balance condition is satisfied for a model , we can utilize the standard statistical mechanics to analyze the model .",
    "namely , the equilibrium probability distribution is given by the boltzmann type equilibrium distribution with the thermodynamic potential .",
    "in the vicinity of the equilibrium state , dynamical behaviours such as the relaxation or linear response properties can be related to the correlation functions of fluctuations in equilibrium@xcite .",
    "the detailed balance condition is a strong condition and thus it is not always satisfied in a phenomenologically constructed dynamical model .",
    "therefore , it is desired to examine whether the pcn model satisfies the detailed balance condition or not .",
    "so far , most of the previous works for the pcn model focused on dynamical properties such as rheological properties .",
    "as far as the authors know , the analysis of the pcn model from the view point of statistical mechanics has never been shown explicitly in the literatures .",
    "( it would be fair to mention that several researchers have noticed that the pcn model or some other slip - link models do not satisfy the detailed balance condition , although it has not been stressed in published literatures .",
    "for some slip - link models , the statistical mechanical analysis or the modeling consistent with the detailed balance condition have been done@xcite . )    in this work , first we attempt to interpret the dynamic equations of the pcn model as the langevin equations .",
    "we show that the pcn dynamic equations do not satisfy the detailed balance condition and therefore the pcn model does not have the thermal equilibrium state .",
    "then we propose possible modifications to recover the detailed balance condition , in a heuristic way .",
    "even if we modify the pcn model , the resulting thermodynamic potential ( effective free energy ) of the pcn model is not identical to the free energy of the slip - link model without any direct interactions . in the pcn model",
    ", there is the effective repulsive interaction between neighboring slip - links on a polymer chain .",
    "based on the obtained effective free energy and the single chain approximation , finally we calculate several equilibrium probability distribution functions analytically .",
    "we compare analytical results with other theories as well as pcn simulation data .",
    "in the pcn model@xcite , entangled polymers are represented as a network structure which consists of nodes ( slip - linked points and chain ends ) and bonds which connect nodes . for simplicity",
    "we limit ourselves to monodisperse linear polymer systems with the polymerization index ( number of segments ) being @xmath0 .",
    "the state of the system is described by the set of coarse - grained variables ; positions of slip - linked nodes and end nodes , numbers of segments between two neighboring nodes , and the connectivity information . for convenience ,",
    "we express the index of the @xmath1-th node in the @xmath2-th chain as @xmath3 .",
    "we express the position of the @xmath3 node as @xmath4 , and the number of segments between the @xmath5 and @xmath3 nodes as @xmath6 .",
    "we also express the number of subchains in the @xmath2-th chain as @xmath7 .",
    "the @xmath8th and @xmath7-th nodes in the @xmath2-th chain represent chain ends whereas other nodes represent slip - linked nodes .",
    "a slip - linked node is assumed to be spatially coupled to the partner node .",
    "we express this by introducing a connectivity map for the node index , @xmath9 ( the @xmath3 node is coupled to the @xmath10 node ) .",
    "two nodes connected by slip - links , @xmath3 and @xmath10 , share the same node position . @xmath11 the state of the system can be completely described by @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath9 .",
    "( the information of @xmath9 is not important in the following arguments and thus we do not describe it explicitly . )    in absence of external flow ( deformation ) field , the pcn dynamic equations @xcite are described as follows .",

    "( actually , it is empirically known that as long as the repulsion is sufficiently strong to avoid aggregation , the pcn model shows almost the same statistics . )    to specify the pcn dynamics completely , we also need the network reconstruction rules . whether the network is reconstructed or not is determined by the number of segments in chain end bonds .",
    "if the number of segments in a chain end bond becomes larger than a certain criterion , a new pair of slip - linked nodes are constructed . on the other hand , if the number of the segments in an chain end bond becomes smaller than another criterion , the slip - link attached to that bond is destructed .",
    "the criteria are given as @xmath35 and @xmath36 , with @xmath37 being the average number of segments in a bond .",

    "moreover , the existence of the thermodynamic potential ( the free energy ) is generally not guaranteed for such a phenomenological dynamical model .",

    "nevertheless , pcn simulations by the original dynamic equations can reproduce some equilibrium properties of entangled polymers reasonably@xcite .",

    "it should be emphasized here that the noise term in eq is the _ multiplicative noise _ because @xmath63 depends on @xmath13 ( through @xmath58 and @xmath28 ) .",
    "although the spurious drift term may not be intuitive , it naturally arises as a property of the multiplicative noise @xcite , and is required to satisfy the detailed balance condition .    before we proceed to detailed analysis",
    ", here we shortly comment on the relation of our model to the generic framework in the nonequilibrium thermodynamics @xcite . in our modified pcn dynamic equations , the thermodynamic forces are coupled to the symmetric mobility matrices .",

    "we note that @xmath78 depends only on the number of segments between slip - links .",
    "this means that the effective interaction between slip - links is determined by the chemical distance , not by the spatial distance .",

    "the second term in the right hand side of eq can be interpreted as the total repulsive interaction energy of slip - links . in this sense",
    ", we can say that the pcn model is based on the gaussian chain and repulsive slip - links .",
    "it is worth mentioning that such an effective repulsion between slip - links is already suggested by the creta primitive path extraction for monte carlo simulation data @xcite .",
    "in the previous section , the effective free energy for the modified pcn model is shown to be different from the free energy for gaussian chains , due to the repulsive interaction between slip - links .",
    "this means that several equilibrium statistical properties of the pcn model are qualitatively different from ones of the gaussian chains with slip - links without any direction interactions .",

    "( we notice that , it is not clear whether the single chain approximation employed in this work is really reasonable for the pcn model or not .",

    "such a local structural change may affect the distribution functions to some extent .",

    "it is rather surprising that simple modifications can reproduce rather complicated , detailed - balanced langevin equations .",
    "the modified ( detailed - balanced ) version of the pcn model can reproduce several probability distribution functions which are qualitatively similar to the ones predicted by the single chain repulsive slip - link model .    here",
    "we consider the original pcn dynamic equation for @xmath13 ( eqs and ) again .",
    "the fact that we only need relatively minor modifications for the original pcn dynamics equations implies that the original pcn dynamics itself is already a reasonable approximation for a statistical mechanically sound model .",

    "nevertheless , the probability that @xmath13 is close to @xmath153 is expected not to be small .",
    "thus we consider that the analysis performed here qualitatively explains why the original pcn model works as a good approximation .",

    "although this form is not intuitive , from the view point of the discretization scheme , it is not unreasonable .",
    "the pcn dynamic equation for @xmath13 ( eqs and ) is interpreted as the stochastic diffusion equation on one dimensional discrete lattice . at the continuum limit",
    ", the pcn dynamic equation will reduce to the stochastic partial differential equation@xcite which contains the multiplicative noise . to discretize the multiplicative noises appear in the stochastic partial differential equations ,",

    "thus we expect that the harmonic average form is more natural than the arithmetic average form .",
    "we should note that the statistical properties of the pcn network reconstruction rules @xcite are not considered in this work .",
    "the network reconstruction rules proposed so far do not satisfy the detailed balance condition and therefore the pcn model is not fully detailed - balanced , even if we employ the modified dynamic equations .",
    "( especially for small @xmath109 , the network reconstruction rule affects the statistical properties significantly . ) to understand the statistical properties of the full pcn dynamics , the statistical mechanical analysis of the network reconstruction rules is also required .",
    "it seems to be difficult to satisfy the detailed balance condition in the network reconstruction process of multi chain slip - link models due to its intrinsic complicatedness , and thus it is left for a future work .",
    "( the exact equilibrium statistics of a slip - linked multi chain system is not simple nor intuitive @xcite , unlike a single chain system . )",
    "although we do not consider further modifications here , the current work will be useful to find strategies for other modifications which improve the pcn model .",
    "as we showed and discussed in previous sections , the effective repulsive interaction between slip - links ( eq ) affects statistical properties of the network qualitatively .",
    "we expect that the statistics can be further changed by changing the interaction potential ( or interaction strength ) between slip - links .",

    ", the variance of the subchain number distribution function can be used to estimate the strength the effective repulsive interaction between slip - links .",
    "it is interesting to compare our model ( or our picture ) with other models or primitive path extraction results , and discuss whether our model is similar to others or not . among the examined distribution functions",
    ", the segment number distribution function seems to be the most sensitive to the interaction between slip - links .",
    "the segment number distribution of the single chain repulsive slip - link model is qualitatively much different from one of the single chain non - interacting slip - link model .",
    "the segment number distribution functions which have similar forms to eq are already proposed by tzoumanekas and theodorou@xcite , and greco@xcite .    here",
    "we compare our model with these distribution functions .",
    "tzoumanekas and theodorou proposed the following empirical form for the segment number distribution , to fit their creta primitive path extraction data .",
    "@xmath164 here @xmath165 is a fitting parameter and @xmath166 .",
    "they reported that the segment number distribution functions obtained by the creta can be fitted well to eq with @xmath167 .",
    "eq can be also utilized to fit the distribution functions by the original pcn model with the fitting parameter @xmath168 @xcite .",
    "this value is close to @xmath169 , and for such a case eq can be approximated well by the following simple form .",
    "@xmath170 eq is quite similar to eq .",
    "tzoumanekas and theodorou proposed that the physical origin of such a non - monotonic form of eq is the effective repulsion ( or the blocking effect ) between topological constraints , which depends the chemical distance .",
    "this is qualitatively the same as our repulsive slip - link model . of course , the creta primitive path extraction results and their molecular model are different from the pcn model and our slip - link model . for example , the creta primitive path data are taken for an atomistic polymer model while the pcn model employs a rather coarse - grained gaussian chain model . besides , it is not clear whether the slip - links in the pcn model and the topological constraints extracted by the creta have the same physical properties .",
    "thus the distribution function by the pcn model does not necessarily to be coincide to one by the creta .",
    "actually , at least the values of the fitting parameter @xmath171 for two distributions are different .",

    "judging from the distribution functions , the repulsive interaction in their model seems to be weaker than our model .",

    "further progress of theories would be required to understand the origin of non - monotonic segment number distribution functions .",

    "we can employ the effective interaction potential for slip - links determined from the network statistics by the primitive path extraction methods to make the slip - link models compatible with the primitive path extraction data .",
