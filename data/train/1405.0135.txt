    "we consider discrete - time sequential decision problems for a control loop that has a communication bottleneck between the sensor and the controller  ( figure  [ simpleloop ] ) .",
    "the design problem is to choose in concert an encoder and a controller .",
    "the encoder maps the sensor s raw data into a causal sequence of channel inputs . depending on the channel model adopted in this paper , the encoder performs either sequential quantization , sampling , or analog companding .",
    "the controller maps channel outputs into a causal sequence of control inputs to the plant . such two - agent problems are generally hard because the information pattern is non - classical , as the controller has less information than the sensor  @xcite .",
    "this gives scope for the controller to exploit any dual  effect present in the loop , even when the plant is linear  @xcite .",
    "these two - agent problems are at the simpler end of a range of design problems arising in networked control systems  @xcite .",
    "naturally , one seeks formulations of these design problems as stochastic optimization problems whose solutions are tractable in some suitable sense .",
    "the classical partially observed linear quadratic gaussian ( lqg ) optimal control problem is a one - agent decision problem  @xcite .",
    "given a linear , gauss - markov plant , one is asked for a causal controller , as a function of noisy linear measurements of the state , to minimize a quadratic cost function of states and controls .",
    "this problem has a simple and explicit solution , where the optimal controller ` separates ' into two policies ; one to generate a minimum mean - squared error estimate of the state from the noisy measurements , and the other to control the fully observed gauss - markov process corresponding to the estimate .",
    "a networked version of this problem is the following two - agent lqg optimal control problem  @xcite .",
    "given a linear gauss - markov plant and a channel model , one is asked for an encoder and controller to minimize a performance cost which is a sum of a communication cost and a quadratic cost on states and controls .",
    "the communication cost is charged on decisions at the encoder , which are chosen to satisfy constraints imposed by the channel model .",
    "no causal encoding or control policies are , in general , excluded from consideration . as in the one - agent version ,",
    "a certain ` separated ' design is optimal , as has been suggested in various settings since the sixties  @xcite .",
    "precisely , the following combination is optimal : certainty equivalence controls with a minimum mean - squared estimator of the state , and an encoder that minimizes a distortion for state estimation at the controller .",
    "the distortion is the average of a sum of squared estimation errors with time - varying coefficients depending on the coefficients of the performance cost .",
    "this separation is different from that obtained in the classical lqg problem , but it is still due to a linear evolution of the state , and the statistical independence of noises from all other current and past variables . as in the classical one - agent version  @xcite , the random variables need not be gaussian .          in the long history of the two - agent networked lqg problem ,",
    "different channel models have been treated , leading to different types of encoders .",
    "we find in these works that the encoder is either a quantizer , an analog time - dependent compander , or an event - based sampler .",
    "when a discrete alphabet channel is treated , the encoder is a time - dependent quantizer .",
    "quantized control has been explored since the sixties , and structural results for this problem have seen spirited discussions over the years  @xcite .",
    "this problem was revisited by borkar  et  al .",
    "@xcite in recent years , setting off a new wave of interest .",
    "surveys can be found in  @xcite .",
    "for an additive noise channel , the encoder is a time - dependent , possibly non - linear , compander .",
    "the corresponding networked lqg problem has been studied in  @xcite , and more recently in  @xcite .",
    "analog channels with channel use restrictions lead to an encoder being an event - triggered sampler  @xcite .",
    "the networked lqg problem for event - triggered sampling is studied in  @xcite .",
    "the above papers suggested separated designs for the two - agent lqg problem with dynamic encoder and controller , and certainty equivalence controls .",
    "this is despite other results  @xcite , confirming the dual effect in the two - agent networked control problem .",
    "thus , there can be an incentive to the controller to influence the estimation error , and yet the optimal controller chooses to ignore this incentive .",
    "furthermore , for the two - agent lqg problem with event - triggered sampling , and with zero order hold control between samples , rabi  et  al .",
    "@xcite showed through numerical computations that it is suboptimal to apply controls affine in the minimum mean square error  ( mmse ) estimate .",
    "the optimal controls are nonlinear functions of the received samples .",
    "thus , the literature does not tell us when separation holds , and when it does not , for the general class of two - agent problems .",
    "we make three main contributions .",
    "firstly , we show that for the combination of a linear plant and nonlinear encoder , the dual effect is present .",
    "this confirms the results of curry and others  @xcite , by establishing through a counter example that there is a dual effect in the closed - loop system .",
    "in fact , each of the three models we allow for the channel endow the loop with the dual effect .",
    "the dual role of the controller lies in reducing the estimation error in the future , using the predicted statistics of the future state and knowledge of the encoding policy . due to this dual role ,",
    "we show that , in general , separated designs need not be optimal for linear plants with non - linear measurements , even with independent and identically distributed  ( iid ) gaussian noise and quadratic costs .",
    "examples  [ ex : constrainedencoder_nosep ] and  [ ex : constrainedcontrol_nosep ] show instances where the dual effect matters .",
    "example  [ example : predictionerrordependence ] shows how the dual effect in the two - agent networked lq problem renders useless the techniques that work for the classical , single - agent , partially observed lq problem .",
    "these examples illustrate the insufficiency of arguments offered in  @xcite for the optimality of separation and certainty equivalent controls .",
    "our second contribution is a proof for separation in one specific design problem .",
    "we prove that for the dynamic encoder - controller design problem , it is optimal to apply separation and certainty equivalence .",
    "a key instrument in our proof is the class of ` controls - forgetting encoders ' ( introduced in section  [ controlsforgettingsection ] ) which we show to be optimal despite it being a strict subset of the general class of state - based encoders .",
    "we also notice that the result holds under a variety of schemes for charging communication costs .",
    "for example , it holds even when the encoder is an analog compander with hard amplitude limits .",
    "our proof does not require the dual effect to be absent .",
    "hence there is no contradiction with the fact separation and certainty equivalence are not optimal for other design problems concerning the same plant - sensor combination .",
    "our work also provides a direct insight to explain separation or the lack of it , in the form of a property of the optimal cost - to - go function   ( example  [ ex : certaintyequivalence_encdes ] in section  [ examples ] ) .",
    "furthermore , we show that when this property does not hold separation is no longer optimal .",
    "our third contribution points out some subtleties that arise when dynamic policies are involved .",
    "we explicitly demonstrate that with dynamic encoders for lq optimal control , one can not extend and apply a result of bar - shalom and tse  @xcite which mandates absence of dual effect for certainty equivalence to be optimal . the classical notion of a dual effect",
    "was introduced for static measurement policies , and the dual role of the controls has been motivated through the notion of a probing incentive  @xcite .",
    "we ask if the concept of probing applies unchanged for dynamic measurement policies and point out some subtleties in answering this question .    in recent years",
    ", there has been a resurgence of interest in problems related to dynamic and decentralized decision making in stochastic control .",
    "old problems and results have been reexamined and reinterpreted to find new insights and develop new methods , such as the common information approach  @xcite .",
    "others , such as  @xcite , have sought to reinterpret the proof techniques used in  @xcite .",
    "following in the path of  @xcite , many new counterexamples have been identified that show optimality of nonlinear strategies for control problems under non - classical information patterns  @xcite .",
    "similarly , drawing from the many works on two - agent networked lqg problems  @xcite , we have sought to understand why a structural simplification can be found in some dynamic decision problems , despite the non - classical information pattern and the consequent presence of a dual effect .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ twoagentproblemstatement ]",
    ", we present a basic problem formulation , pertaining to encoder and controller design for data - rate limited channels . in section  [ definitionofdeandce ] , we discuss the notion of a dual effect and certainty equivalence , and present a counterexample to establish that there is a dual effect in the considered networked control system . in section  [ proofsection ] , we present a proof for separation in the two - agent networked lqg problem . in section  [ extensions ] , we extend our results to other channel models , including event - triggered samples and additive noise channels . in section  [ examples ] , we present a number of examples to illustrate that in general , separation does not hold for constrained design problems , followed by the conclusions in section  [ discussionsection ] .",
    "in this section , we describe a version of the two - agent networked lqg problem , corresponding to a rate - limited channel model .",
    "we consider an instantaneous , error - free , discrete - alphabet channel and the logarithm of the size of the alphabet is the bit rate .",
    "a control system that uses such a channel to communicate between its sensor and controller is depicted in figure  [ simpleloop ] , and comprises of four blocks .",
    "each of these blocks , along with the performance cost , are described below , followed by a description of the design problems under consideration .",
    "the plant state process @xmath0 is scalar , and its evolution law is linear : @xmath1 for @xmath2 here @xmath3 is the controls process , and @xmath4 is the plant noise process , which is a sequence of independent random variables with constant variance  @xmath5 , and zero means .",
    "the initial state  @xmath6 has a distribution with mean  @xmath7 and variance  @xmath8 . at any time @xmath9 ,",
    "the noise  @xmath10 is independent of all state , control , channel input , and channel output data up to and including time @xmath9 .",
    "we assume that the state process is perfectly observed by the sensor .",
    "the performance cost is a sum of the quadratic cost charged on states and controls , and a communication cost charged on encoder decisions : @xmath11     +      j^{\\textrm{comm } } \\label{objectivefunction}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are suitably chosen scalar weights for the squares of the states and controls , respectively .",
    "the communication cost @xmath14 is an average quantity that depends on the encoding and control policies , and the channel model adopted .",
    "the channel model refers to an input - output description of the communication link from the sensor to the controller .",
    "we denote the channel input at time @xmath9 by @xmath15 , the corresponding output by  @xmath16 , and the encoding map generating  @xmath15 by @xmath17 . in figure",
    "[ simpleloop ] , we consider an ideal , discrete alphabet channel that faithfully reproduces inputs , and thus , @xmath18 . the encoder s job is to pick at every time  @xmath9 , the encoding map  @xmath17 producing a channel output letter from the pre - assigned finite alphabet @xmath19 where the non - negative integer @xmath20 is the pre - assigned size of the channel alphabet .",
    "since the alphabet is fixed , we have a hard data - rate constraint at every time .",
    "hence there is no explicit cost attached to communication , so  @xmath21 in this case . in section  [ extensions ] , we consider other channel models that permit the data - rate or energy needed for each transmission to be chosen causally by the encoder .",
    "the control signal @xmath22 is real valued and is to be computed by a causal policy based on the sequence of channel outputs .",
    "the controller has perfect memory , and thus remembers all of its past actions , and the causal sequence of channel outputs .",
    "thus , in general , at every time  @xmath9 the controller s map takes the form : @xmath23      at all times , the encoder knows the entire set of control policies employed by the controller and the statistical parameters of the plant . with this prestored knowledge ,",
    "the encoder works as a causal quantizer mapping the sequence of plant outputs .",
    "thus , the encoder s map takes the form : @xmath24 notice that we do not allow the encoder to directly view the sequence of inputs to the plant .",
    "this subtle point plays an important role in the examples we present in section  [ discussionsection ] .      for a given information pattern",
    ", different design spaces may arise due to engineering heuristics , hardware or software limitations , etc .",
    "any such design space is a subset of the set of all admissible encoder and controller pairs .",
    "we identify four design problems , each associated with its own design space . for these design problems ,",
    "an adopted channel model can be either the one described in section  [ discretechannelfixed ] , or any of the models from section  [ extensions ] .",

    "next we pose a design problem where the design space is the largest possible non - randomized set of admissible encoder - controller pairs .",

    "next we pose a design problem where the controller must respect not only the information pattern in the dynamic encoder - controller design problem  ( design problem  [ fullydynamiccontrols ] ) , but must also respect a restriction on updating controls .",

    "since the optimal envelope computed numerically is clearly non - symmetric about the means @xmath511 $ ] , there must be a dual effect in the loop , which is exploited by this optimal pair of sampler and zero order hold controller .",
    "in this paper , we have seen through examples that the dual effect is present in the plant - encoder - channel combination .",
    "hence in general , it is suboptimal to apply a controls - free encoder , or to apply an affine controller .",
    "it has long been known that for the design problem with a static encoder , separation is not optimal , and that the optimal control laws are nonlinear  @xcite .",
    "recent interest in the dynamic design problem was due to borkar and mitter  @xcite who describe advantages obtained by applying controls - forgetting encoders .",
    "many papers state that the separated design is optimal for the dynamic design problem for the various channel models we have treated .",
    "we have shown by dynamic programming that these statements are indeed correct .",
    "this is an instance of the optimal decision policies ` ignoring ' the presence of the dual effect .",
    "but a separated design need not be optimal for other design problems .",
    "in particular , for event - triggered sampling the dynamic design problem has a separated design , but the zero order hold control design problem does not have a separated solution .",
    "this is at least partly surprising because , separated design is optimal for the classical lqg partially observed control with or without the zero order hold control restriction .",
    "an interesting aspect of our results is that we have shown that separation and certainty equivalence are optimal for design problem @xmath476 , despite the dual effect being present in the networked control system of section  [ twoagentproblemstatement ] . to understand this result ,",
    "we now examine two implementations of the optimal encoder - controller pair for this design problem , and using these , we draw out some subtle points concerning dual effect and optimality of separation and certainty equivalence .",
    "bar - shalom and tse  @xcite consider the loop shown in figure  [ blockdiagrambarshalomtse ] . at the sensor , instead of our dynamic encoder , they place a nonlinear map .",
    "this sensor map is time - varying but memoryless and its exact functional form is given . for this setup",
    ", they have a result stating the mutual exclusivity of the dual effect and optimality of certainty equivalence controls . in their setting , if the linear ` plant ' is such that the effect of controls is never felt at the observation signal  @xmath512 , then clearly there is no dual effect .",
    "this happens in the case where the so - called ` plant ' has a sub - system that produces the ` plant ' output after explicitly removing the effect of controls .",
    "however , for our setup  ( figure  [ simpleloop ] ) , the sensor has a dynamic encoder even after one performs the equivalence transformation by subtracting out the effect of controls .",
    "the use of ` innovation coding ' leads to the closed loop shown in figure  [ blockdiagramequivalentencoder ] .",
    "the crucial difference from the setup of bar - shalom and tse is that rather than being a memoryless nonlinear map , the encoder @xmath513 is a dynamical system .",
    "hence the theorem of bar - shalom and tse does not apply .",
    "but it springs the following question : does the plant - sensor combination in the closed loop of figure  [ blockdiagramequivalentencoder ] have a dual effect if an encoder is used that is optimal for the dynamic design problem  ? to answer this question , one needs to interpret carefully what it means to implement an optimal encoder . for different interpretations ,",
    "one gets different answers .",
    "assume that we are implementing the feedback loop of figure  [ simpleloop ] with the optimal encoder and any admissible controller .",
    "the first interpretation of what it means to implement an optimal encoder , is the following : the encoder stores the actual set of control policies used by the controller , and uses this to carry out the innovation encoding , and on the result applies the sequential quantizer @xmath514 .",
    "this is equivalent to the block diagram of figure  [ blockdiagram : nodualeffect ] .",
    "no matter what the actual control policies are , the controls have no influence on the input to the sequential quantizer @xmath514 . clearly , because of exact cancellation of controls , the encoder implemented is controls - forgetting , and there is no dual effect in the loop of figure  [ blockdiagram : nodualeffect ] .",
    "the second interpretation is the following : the encoder does not pay attention to the actual control policy being used .",
    "instead , it assumes that the controller is applying the certainty equivalence laws  ( [ optimalcontrollaw ] ) .",
    "it subtracts out the effect of the these certainty equivalence control laws . to the residue  @xmath515",
    ", it applies the sequential quantizer @xmath514 .",
    "clearly this encoder is not controls - forgetting .",
    "but yet when used in combination with the certainty equivalence laws of ( [ optimalcontrollaw ] ) , it leads to minimum performance cost .    on the other hand , when this encoder is used in combination with a general admissible control law ,",
    "there is potential mismatch between the encoder s assumption and the actual controller behaviour .",
    "the effect of the controls is not absent in the input to the sequential quantizer @xmath514 .",
    "this situation is shown in figure  [ blockdiagram : withdualeffect ] .",
    "clearly , there is a dual effect in this loop .",
    "this leads to an interesting consequence .",
    "if a pair of encoding and control strategies is optimal , then the individual strategies that are components of the pair must be person - by - person optimal . since the combination of certainty equivalence controls and the corresponding optimal encoder is optimal , it follows that the certainty equivalence controls must be optimal for the single - agent control problem obtained by fixing the encoder to be the optimal one . since the second interpretation of implementing the optimal encoder is perfectly valid , it turns out that certainty equivalence controls can be optimal even though the dual effect is present in the loop .",
    "thus we can conclude that the theorem of bar - shalom and tse can not generalize to the scenario where sensors implement dynamic encoders .",
    "adam molin first suggested to us that for event - triggered systems , the separated solution may not be optimal for the zero order hold control design problem , and yet be optimal for the dynamic encoder - controller design problem . to lei bao , mikael skoglund , henrik sandberg , ashutosh nayyar , john  s.  baras , and armand makowski we are grateful for many discussions over the last few years .",
