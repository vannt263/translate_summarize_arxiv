    "rademacher @xcite was the first to consider this problem and he conjectured that , for a certain specific type of @xmath7 , there should be a `` predominance of terms which fulfill @xmath9 '' . since the fractional parts are uniformly distributed modulo @xmath10 , as proved by hlawka @xcite in 1975 , any discrepancy must be very subtle .",

    ", we can see that the right hand side is close to a constant , and thus the discrepancy of the set @xmath20 is of order @xmath21 . in @xcite , the first author , soundararajan , and the third author established connections between the discrepancy of this set , montgomery s pair correlation function and the distribution of primes in short intervals .    in the present paper ,",
    "our goal is to generalize the results from @xcite to the case of simultaneous distribution of fractional parts @xmath22 , where @xmath23 are distinct , positive real numbers .",
    "as we will see below , a new phenomenon involving diophantine approximation appears in the higher dimensional case @xmath1 .    for @xmath1 ,",
