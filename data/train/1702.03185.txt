    "the acceleration of the expansion of the universe has come to a huge surprise to most of the scientific community more than 15 years ago @xcite . in modern cosmology , many hypothesis have been proposed to drive the accelerated period of expansion . among these models is the ubiquitous dark fluid christen dark energy having an equation of state ( eos ) corresponding to vacuum energy .",
    "this proposal is part of the standard model of cosmology called @xmath3cdm which requires the universe to be made of an hypothetical dark energy fluid , in addition to the baryonic matter and dark matter . since 1999 , many independent cosmological observations , such as cosmic microwave background observations @xcite , have pointed towards the existence of dark energy . however , if its existence relies on a well established observational basis , its nature is still an opaque mystery .",
    "different proposals include , among others , dynamical dark energy ( quintessence ) @xcite , dynamical backreaction @xcite , inhomogeneous cosmologies @xcite and modified gravity @xcite .",
    "more recently , mainly on phenomenological ground , it has been discovered that allowing an interaction between dark energy and dark matter offers an interesting and attractive alternative to the standard model of cosmology .",
    "such a phenomenological interaction is possible as the nature of the dark matter fluid is also poorly constrained and that general relativity only requires the total energy momentum to be conserved , but not the partial ones .",
    "interacting dark energy models @xcite rely on the idea that dark energy and dark matter do not evolve separately but interact with each other non - gravitationally ( see also the recent review @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "most of the studies on interacting dark fluids focus on the relation to the cosmological data introducing an _ ad hoc _ coupling between dark matter and dark energy @xcite .",
    "a classification of those models was given in @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we adopt a theoretical model arising directly from the quantum field theory of einstein - cartan gravity @xcite and perform the link to a set of observational data : the supernovae ia ( hereafter sne ia ) .",
    "interacting dark energy models are known to solve the coincidence problem : in the present universe the contributions of dark matter and dark energy to the cosmic budget are of the same order , while their respective evolutions are drastically different throughout the cosmic history .",
    "let @xmath4 be the critical energy density and @xmath5 be the energy densities of the dark matter and dark energy fluids . here",
    "@xmath6 is the hubble constant and @xmath7 is the gravitational constant . in the following ,",
    "quantities with a subscript or superscript @xmath8 are measured in the present universe .",
    "we define @xmath9 and @xmath10 as the ratio between energy densities of dark matter and dark energy and the critical energy density : @xmath11 knowing that the parameters @xmath9 and @xmath10 vary differently with redshift @xmath12 , with @xmath13 and @xmath14 , the fact that @xmath15 is fairly unnatural : we are observing our universe in a very peculiar epoch .",
    "observe that with these definitions , the friedmann equation is nothing but a constraint equation between the two fluids , namely @xmath16 .",
    "the model considered in this paper relies on the einstein - cartan gravitational theory and the universe would be in the scale invariant ultra - violet fixed point of the theory , which we refer as _ quantum field cosmology _ ( qfc ) model .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that it is possible from this very general theory to propose an expression for the luminosity distance , and hence compare it to observational data .",
    "this paper aims at realizing this possibility and investigating whether this model , as other interacting dark energy models , offers a viable alternative to the @xmath3cdm model .",
    "our article shares the same spirit than @xcite : not only it provides a phenomenological interacting dark energy framework , but it also presents theoretical motivations arising from quantum field theory . this article is divided as follow : in section [ sec : sfc ] and [ sec : latea ] , we present the basic equations of the qfc model and calculate an expression for the luminosity distance . in section [ sec : fit ] , we perform a @xmath2 fit to the supernovae data .",
    "motivated by the encouraging results , we investigate in section [ sec : paramstudy ] more systematically the parameter space of our model by asking the following question : which range of the parameter space of the qfc model offers a better alternative than the @xmath3cdm model . finally , we give conclusions and perspectives in section [ sec : ccl ] .",
    "as one of the fundamental theories for interactions in nature , the classical einstein theory of gravity , which plays an essential role in the standard model of modern cosmology ( @xmath3cdm ) , should be realized in the scaling - invariant domain of a fixed point of its quantum field theory .",
    "it was proposed @xcite that the present ( low - redshift @xmath17 ) cosmology is realized in the scaling - invariant domain of an ultraviolet - stable fixed point ( @xmath18 ) of the quantum field theory of einstein gravity . ] , and is described by @xmath19 , \\label{re3}\\\\ a\\frac{dh^2}{da}\\ ! + \\ !",

    "@xmath27 are the pressures of the dark fluids . in deriving equations ( [ re3 ] ) and ( [ e2 ] ) , motivated by observations , it was assumed that the curvature is null @xmath28 , implying @xmath29 .",
    "in addition , in the framework of qfc model , both the gravitation constant and @xmath30 can vary , following the scaling evolutions @xmath31 and @xmath32 , where @xmath33 .",
    "in other words , the evolution of the two dark sectors is described by the two critical indexes @xmath34 and @xmath35 . the dark energy and matter interact and can be converted from one to another .",

    "in the @xmath3cdm model , the friedmann equations read : @xmath42 equations ( [ re3 ] ) and ( [ e2 ] ) in the qfc model can be obtained by phenomenologically introducing a slight deformation of the evolution of the dark sector of our universe , obtained from the friedmann equations : @xmath43 using definitions ( [ eq:8 ] ) and ( [ eq:9 ] ) in equations ( [ eq : fried1 ] ) and ( [ eq : fried2 ] ) , one recovers equations ( [ re3 ] ) and ( [ e2 ] ) of the qfc model , given the eos @xmath44 and @xmath45 . therefore , the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 of equations ( [ eq:8 ] ) and ( [ eq:9 ] ) correspond to the parameters of the qfc model discussed in section [ sec : sfc ] .",
    "the total conservation of dark energy and matter leads to the constraint ( [ eq : rela ] ) on @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "although the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 are motivated by the qfc model , these parameters can also be explored on phenomenological grounds .",
    "it leads to another interpretation of parameters @xmath0 and @xmath35 .    using the individual conservation of the energy momentum tensors for the dark matter and dark energy sectors respectively @xmath46 and the friedmann equation ( [ eq : fried1 ] )",
    ", we find that the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath35 in eq .",
    "( [ re3 ] ) can be interpreted as effective modifications of the eos with @xmath47    besides , assuming the standard eos ( @xmath48 ) , it is also possible to relate the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 to an interaction between dark matter and dark energy by introducing an interaction term @xmath49 @xmath50 in this case , the interaction term @xmath49 can be effectively expressed : @xmath51 which leads also to the relation ( [ eq : rela ] ) .",
    "such interaction terms have been shown to alleviate the coincidence problem @xcite .",
    "we stress that this last interpretation in term of @xmath49 of the deformation the dark sector ( [ eq:8 ] ) ( [ eq:9 ] ) is valid only for small redshifts ( @xmath52 ) , as otherwise the different evolutions in redshift for @xmath53 and @xmath54 invalidate ( [ eq : q ] ) . to obtain the general interaction term",
    ", one needs to consider the general evolution of the effective gravitational constant in equation ( 36 ) of @xcite but this investigation is out of the scope of this paper .    [ [ section ] ]    in this article",
    ", we will treat the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath35 in eq .",
    "( [ re3 ] ) as free parameters determined by the observational cosmology .",
    "observe that in order to have a coherent model of dark energy , the constraint @xmath55 must be fulfilled . in this case",
    ", the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 can be interpreted as the rate of conversion of dark matter into dark energy and of dark energy into dark matter .",
    "a phenomenological investigation shows that increasing @xmath0 or decreasing @xmath1 induces an acceleration of the expansion of the universe : dark matter is converted into dark energy .",
    "conversely , decreasing @xmath0 or increasing @xmath1 induces a deceleration of the expansion of the universe : dark energy is converted into dark matter .",

    "this equation is derived under the assumption of a flat universe , that is to say @xmath63 .",
    "in this section , the relation given by equation ( [ eq : rela ] ) is enforced .",
    "it gives a constraint between the two new parameters of the qfc model . in section [ sec : paramstudy ] , this constraint is relaxed in order to study a broader range of the parameter space .",
    "we are now in position to perform a @xmath2 fit with the union 2.1 compilation released by the supernova cosmology project @xcite .",

    "we note that the flrw and the qfc models are nested ( the flrw model is recovered with @xmath70 ) . performing a f - test",
    ", we find that the addition of the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 , with and without imposing the relation ( [ eq : rela ] ) , is not statistically required , as they do not significantly improve the fit . indeed , with @xmath0 free and relation ( [ eq : rela ] ) imposed , it comes @xmath71 , while for both @xmath0 and @xmath35 free , @xmath72 .",
    "this is to be compared to the critical values , which respectively are @xmath73 and @xmath74 at the @xmath75 confidence level .",
    "we presented a new model for interacting dark energy arising from the effective field theory of einstein - cartan gravity in section [ sec : sfc ] and explored its observational consequences on supernovae ia .",
    "we compared and contrasted it with the standard @xmath3cdm model assuming equation ( [ eq : rela ] ) .",
    "we then explored the parameter space for this model to know for which value of the parameters , the model has a better @xmath76 than its flrw counterpart .",
    "we found that if one decreases slightly the matter content of the universe , a substantial zone of the parameter space offers a smaller @xmath2 than the flrw model .",
    "it could be a possible hint pointing to the need to consider a correction due to interacting dark energy to the halo bias for structure formation , we hope to come back to those questions .",
    "it is not the first time that decent alternatives to the @xmath3cdm model based on a time variation of the cosmological constant and interaction between dark matter and dark energy are explored .",
    "the qfc model provides one more example of such an alternative .",
    "the qfc model of @xcite is also constrained by other independent experiments which constrains the effective variation of the gravitational constant . by lunar laser ranging experiment @xcite , we find a bound for @xmath0 : @xmath77 furthermore the big - bang nucleosynthesis gives an even stringent constraint on the variation of the gravitational constant which translates for our parameters into : @xmath78 depending on the model used for nucleosynthesis @xcite .",
    "this study is a first step towards better exploring the parameter space and setting constraints on the parameters .",
    "as already done for other interacting dark energy models , it needs to be challenged with different independent data set such as baryon acoustic oscillation .",
    "an important extension of this work would be to follow the research plan carried for instance in @xcite where similar models were confronted to 5 different data sets .",
    "we stress that to do so for this model , one needs not only to consider the dynamics explored in equations ( [ re3 ] ) and ( [ e2 ] ) which is only valid for small redshift but a more general one given by equation ( 36 ) of @xcite .",
