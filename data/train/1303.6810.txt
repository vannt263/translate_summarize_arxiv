    "in the photonics and information science of recent years , much attention is paid to the spin - based , rather than charge - based , electronic systems .",
    "this area of research , nowadays referred to as spintronics , treats spin as a carrier of quantum information and is considered as a highly promising pathway to new information technologies @xcite .",
    "this tendency has arisen a great interest to dynamic properties of spin - systems both in equilibrium and under different kind of perturbations capable of controlling spin state of the system .",
    "the new technique - spin noise spectroscopy , developed in the last decade , refers to the experimental methods intended for studying spin - systems under conditions of thermal equilibrium .",
    "the term spin noise spectroscopy ( sns ) signifies experimental technique that implies spectral investigations of spontaneous fluctuations of spin - system magnetization ( spin polarization ) . until recently ,",
    "this spectroscopy was not considered as a practical instrument of experimental physics .",
    "a few experiments @xcite , in which magnetic resonance was observed experimentally in the spin noise spectrum , were primarily aimed at demonstration of practical feasibility of such an approach .",
    "of course , the fact that spin - system in a magnetic field should display an excess noise at the frequency of magnetic resonance justified by the fluctuation - dissipation theorem ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) was beyond question .",
    "still , fluctuations of this kind , fundamentally small for macroscopic systems , could be either hardly detectable , or of no practical sense .",
    "a certain interest to this technique was first revealed by researchers dealing with fundamental problems of quantum nondemolition measurements ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "for the last several years , however , the situation has drastically changed , mainly , due to remarkable advances in the digital systems of data acquisition @xcite . at present , the faraday - rotation - based sns , which is considered to be the most efficient approach to spin noise detection , has found its niche among other methods of the magnetic resonance spectroscopy and gradually turns into a standard experimental technique with a wide and , in many respects , unique range of applications .    in this paper",
    ", we briefly outline the main stages in development of this new branch of spectroscopy starting with the first experimental observation of magnetic resonance in the faraday - rotation ( fr ) noise spectrum to the most recent achievements that revealed unique potentialities of this technique both in the rf and optical spectroscopy of paramagnets .",
    "we will consider basic ideas underlying this experimental technique , will discuss technical problems associated with its implementation , and will describe specific properties of the fr - based sns that determine its rich informative potential .",
    "we will also consider recent technical progress in this method of research that has radically changed its place in the contemporary experimental physics .",
    "this paper is intended not to review the experimental measurements on sns , but rather to review properties of the noise and spin - noise spectroscopy that make these measurements possible .",
    "the fr - based sns combines in itself two essentially different methods of research . on the one hand , it can be considered as a branch of the light intensity noise ( lin ) spectroscopy and , on the other , as a specific modification of the optical method of magnetization detection . to make clear the essence of the fr - based sns",
    ", it makes sense to consider these two basic methods in more detail .",
    "the pioneering experimental work on the lin spectroscopy that has arisen a great interest was performed by a. forrester _ et al . _ in 1955 @xcite ( fig .",
    "1 ) . in that work",
    ", the cell with hg vapor placed into a magnetic field was excited by an electrodless microwave discharge , and two zeeman components of the emission line 546.1 nm were detected photoelectrically by means of a specially designed photodetector coupled to a microwave cavity .",
    "the detected spectrum of the light intensity noise was found to contain a peak at the frequency of magnetic splitting of these two components .",
    "the excess noise of the light intensity related to this splitting was less than @xmath0 of its shot - noise level .",
    "the complexity of the experiment was additionally aggravated by high frequency of the detected signal ( @xmath1 hz ) , needed to provide sufficiently high q - value of the noise peak .",
    "still , the signal has been detected , in this experiment , with the signal - to - noise ratio of around 2 , for the accumulation time of 250 s.        it should be emphasized that , in spite of the fact that the frequency of the observed peak in the intensity noise spectrum exactly corresponded here to magnetic splitting of the emission line , this experiment did not have anything to do with optical detection of magnetic resonance ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "suffice it to say that the width of this peak was determined by the doppler broadening of these zeeman components which should not be revealed in any way in the magnetic resonance spectrum .",
    "the result of fundamental importance obtained in this paper was that , in the process of photoelectric conversion of the light field , the emission probability for electrons is proportional to the square of the total electric field amplitude arising due to interference between its fourier components . in other words ,",
    "this paper has shown experimentally the possibility of interference between the light fields originating from different incoherent sources .",
    "this conclusion , at that time , was far from trivial , and , as the authors of @xcite wrote , `` many physicists found it contradictory to their ideas about the nature of interference '' .",
    "the discussion raised by publication @xcite was further heated by another important experiment in the field of noise spectroscopy .",
    "the experiment in point was performed and interpreted by hunbury - brown and twiss in 1956 @xcite .",
    "now , the measurements were focused on detecting spatial correlations in the intensity noise of a remote thermal source and were aimed at application of this effect to evaluating angular dimensions of stars .",
    "the authors took advantage of the fact that emission of a remote thermal source of finite sixe is characterized by a certain spatial scale of the light coherence controlled by angular size of the source . indeed , if we consider intensity relief created by such a source with the diameter @xmath2 located at a distance @xmath3 from the plane of observation ( fig .",
    "2 ) , we will see that it comprises a multitude of bright and dark spots .",
    "the brightness created at each particular point depends on whether the resultant interference of the waves from all emitters of the source is constructive or destructive .",
    "these spots are very pronounced in monochromatic laser fields and are called _",
    "speckles_. the size of a speckle is determined by the distance at which the total phase difference between the rays providing constructive or destructive interference changes by @xmath4 radians . in our case , the average size of the spot is given by @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the light wavelength .",
    "thus , we see that the angular size of the light source in this geometry can be directly estimated from the average size of speckles .",
    "hunbury - brown and twiss performed their experiment with a star as a light source and evidently could not examine instantaneous relief of brightness over a large area of the illuminated surface .",
    "so , the authors made use of the intrinsic intensity noise of the light emitted by the incoherent source .",
    "these temporal fluctuations had to be correlated or not , in two spatial points of the observation plane , depending on whether these points are closer to each other than the size of the spot or not .",
    "thus , by measuring correlation between photocurrents of two detectors placed at a distance of @xmath7 from each other as a function of @xmath7 one can estimate the average size of the speckles ( of the _ coherence area _ ) and to find angular size of the source .",
    "the stellar interferometer created on the basis of this effect ( the _ intensity interferometer _ ) was successfully used in astrophysical measurements .",
    "the experiments @xcite and @xcite were the earliest and the most famous that have shown that noise in optics may be useful and informative .",
    "note that these measurements were aimed at studying properties of the light , rather than properties of a medium . at the same time , in 60s-70s , there have been performed a considerable number of experiments in which the intensity - noise - based technique ( yet without lasers ) was used for studying dynamic properties of atomic systems .",
    "highly important results of these studies were related to possibility of manifestation of the excited state dynamics and fine energy structure in the noise spectrum of spontaneous emission of the system .",
    "the noise of the light transmitted by an absorbing atomic medium was employed for measuring diffusion parameters of atoms in gaseous medium .",
    "it should be noted that all these experiments , in the pre - laser era , were highly labor - consuming . in more detail , this story is considered in the review @xcite .",
    "the situation has changed dramatically , however , with the advent of lasers . due to extremely high luminosity of laser emission",
    ", the spectral power density of the light intensity modulation in these sources at the beat frequencies could exceed the background shot - noise level by many orders of magnitude , and the lin spectroscopy has gained a much deeper sense .",
    "it became clear that the lin spectroscopy could be used not only for studying spectral and correlation characteristics of the light source proper ( like , e.g. , the laser output mode structure ) , but also for investigating dynamic properties of the media interacting with the light .",
    "specifically , the lin spectroscopy , referred to as dynamic light scattering ( dls ) or photon correlation spectroscopy ( pcs ) , has found application for studying morphological and dynamic properties of suspensions , solutions of macromolecules and polymers , liquid crystals , biological solutions and microorganisms .",
    "this technique may be efficiently applied to ensembles of particles with a wide range of dimensions ( from 0.001 @xmath8 m to several @xmath8 m ) , inaccessible for other methods ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it is interesting to compare the spectroscopy of lin with the conventional optical spectroscopy ( which also inevitably deals with fluctuating optical fields ) .",
    "both methods are aimed at getting information about spectral characteristics of the optical field @xmath9 oscillating at about @xmath10  hz by measuring its _ intensity _",
    "@xmath11 ( in reality , by measuring photocurrent or photocharge ) , since we can not directly measure the field amplitude @xmath9 .        in the standard optical spectroscopy , which implies measuring the spectrum of the field at optical frequencies and , therefore ,",
    "may be considered as the spectroscopy of optical field , the procedure of spectral decomposition of the light field precedes measurement of the light intensity . as a result , the intensity of each detected spectral component retains information about correlation properties of the optical field which is connected with its spectrum , according to the wiener - khinchin theorem , through the relationship    @xmath12    in other words , optical spectroscopy allows one , in this way , to get information about correlation properties of the field in the range of @xmath13 s without photodetectors with so high temporal resolution .    in the lin spectroscopy , the experimental arrangement is inverted : the light field is first converted into a photocurrent ( thus losing its carrier frequency ) and then spectrally analyzed in the electronic channel of the detection system . in this case , the power spectrum of the signal under study is determined by correlation characteristics of the _ light intensity _ @xmath14 ( rather than light field @xmath9 )    @xmath15    and does not contain , in an explicit form , information about correlation properties of the field at optical frequencies . in the lin spectroscopy , the scale of the frequencies of interest is limited by the bandwidth of the detection system , and the lin spectrum , therefore , can contain information only about relatively fine features of the optical spectrum .",
    "this fundamental distinction between the two spectroscopic techniques is schematically illustrated by fig .",
    "3 . the sns , as a sort of lin spectroscopy",
    ", evidently implies the second type of the measurements , with the photodetection preceding spectral decomposition of the signal .",
    "at the same time , combination of the two types of spectroscopy , with preliminary spectral decomposition of the light field , as we will see below , may provide valuable additional information about the system .    in some cases ,",
    "the _ light intensity spectrum _ may provide information about the light field inaccessible for conventional optical spectroscopy .",
    "the matter is that the light intensity variations , as was already mentioned , are caused , in fact , by the beats between different spectral components of the optical field and , therefore , are able to reveal the phase correlation between the components not seen or not resolved in the optical spectrum .",
    "the simplest example may be given by a broadband ( or `` white '' ) light with harmonically modulated intensity .",
    "this light reveals , in its intensity spectrum , a sharp peak at the modulation frequency , while its optical spectrum remains practically unperturbed by the modulation .",
    "this informative capability of the light - intensity spectroscopy constitutes the basis for spectroscopy of superhigh - resolution .",
    "this spectroscopy , developed in the 70s , made it possible , in particular , to realize sub - doppler resolution in optical spectroscopy of atomic systems and to study fundamental phenomena of interference of quantum states hidden in the inhomogeneously broadened optical transitions ( @xcite ) .",
    "the fr - based spin noise spectroscopy ( sns ) , we will talk about , can be regarded as a polarization version of the lin spectroscopy , with the light field fluctuations provided by spontaneous noise of the spin - system magnetization .",
    "possibility of conversion of the magnetization fluctuations to those of the light polarization is determined by direct relationship between the faraday rotation and magnetization of the spin - system , constituting the basis of the optical method of magnetic measurements ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "optical methods of detecting spin - system magnetization ( spin polarization ) employ the fact that magnetization of a paramagnet affects its optical properties .",
    "the so - called `` paramagnetic '' fr that directly reflects magnetization of the spin - system is formed in the following way ( fig.4 ) .",
    "the difference between populations of the ground - state magnetic sublevels of the paramagnet ( of the spin - system energy levels ) creates , for the light propagating along the field , corresponding difference in the optical absorption for the two circular polarized transitions from these unequally populated states ( _ magnetic circular dichroism _ , mcd ) .",
    "this dichroism is , evidently , observed only in the region of optical absorption and manifests itself in the form of ellipticity acquired by the linearly polarized light transmitted through the medium .",
    "the same kind of optical anisotropy , in conformity with the kramers - kronig relations , is observed in difference of the refractive indices for the two circular polarizations ( _ magnetic circular birefringence _ ) and is revealed as rotation of the polarization plane of the linearly polarized light traveling through the medium ( _ the faraday effect _ ) .     and",
    "@xmath16 ) and refractive indices ( @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) for two circular polarizations become different .",
    "these differences ( @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) give rise to the magnetic circular dichroism and faraday rotation , respectively .",
    "magnetic splitting of the transition energies is supposed negligible compared to the line width . , width=377 ]    in this description , we ignored magnetic splitting of the transitions into circularly polarized components of different handedness .",
    "this contribution to the magneto - optical activity of the medium ( usually referred to as `` diamagnetic '' ) is not related to spin - system magnetization and is irrelevant to our consideration .",
    "thus , magnetization of a paramagnet can be measured by detecting either circular dichroism or faraday rotation .",
    "an essential difference between these two methods is that the method of dichroism implies inevitable optical excitation of the sample and , therefore , can not be nonperturbative , whereas detection of the faraday effect may be performed in the region of transparency without producing any real optical transitions .",
    "in addition , the mcd - based measurements of spin - system magnetization may be performed in a pure photometric way be measuring intensity of the transmitted circularly polarized light , while the faraday rotation in the transparency region does not imply ant changes in the light intensity and requires the use of polarimetric technique .",
    "it is also worth to note that the faraday rotation , in the context of our treatment , is not necessarily to be observed in the longitudinal magnetic field , as implies its classical definition .",
    "it is supposed that the fr detects spin polarization along the light propagation direction regardless of the direction ( and even of the presence ) of the external magnetic field . in particular , the fr can be used to detect oscillation of transverse magnetization of the spin - system under conditions of its coherent precession and , thus , to optically detect its magnetic resonance .",
    "this method was first proposed and realized in @xcite .",
    "application of magnetooptics to studying spin dynamics is known since 50s of the last century .",
    "the fr and mcd effects were used , in particular , for detecting magnetic resonance in atomic systems polarized by optical pumping . in those experiments ,",
    "the magnetic resonance was revealed either as a suppression of longitudinal magnetization ( mcd or fr ) for the light propagating along the field ) or as oscillations of the transverse magnetization ( mcd or fr for the light propagating across the field ) @xcite .",
    "this magneto - optical technique was also used for studying dynamic properties and energy structure of transparent paramagnets by measuring their magnetic susceptibility at subresonant frequencies @xcite .",
    "it is important that , in all these experiments , the detected optical signal was a result from _ coherent response _ of the spin - system to a modulated ( or , at least , time dependent ) perturbation ( microwave pumping or external magnetic field ) .",
    "the idea of the spin noise spectroscopy was to detect intrinsic fluctuations of the spin - system magnetization under conditions of thermal equilibrium without any regular external perturbation .",
    "since any real spin - system consists of a finite number of spins which perform incessant random motion ( maintaining thermal equilibrium of the system ) , its magnetization should inevitably exhibit spontaneous fluctuations due to deviations of instantaneous values of the magnetization from its mean value ( fig.5 ) .     of a spin - system in a static external magnetic field @xmath21 , due to permanent motion of individual apins ,",
    "exhibits random fluctuations both in its magnitude ( along the magnetizatio @xmath22 ) and in its direction ( across the mean magnetization).,width=302 ]    spectrum of these random fluctuations and their correlation times should be directly connected with dynamic parameters of this motion ( characteristic frequencies and correlation times ) .",
    "these dynamic characteristics , in principle , can be extracted from results of the noise measurements .",
    "of course , the notion of thermodynamic fluctuations had been known long before the late 70 s , when the experiment @xcite was planned , and the problem was more of practical , rather than fundamental nature : it was clear that these fluctuations , in a macroscopic spin - system , should be extremely small , and the question was whether it was possible to detect them experimentally for a reasonable accumulation time with a sufficiently high signal - to - noise ratio and , after all , whether it had any practical sense .",
    "conventional magneto - optical measurements imply two main geometries of the measurements , with the light beam propagating , respectively , along and across the magnetic field .",
    "these geometries are commonly referred to as the faraday ( longitudinal ) and voigt ( transverse ) configurations .",
    "standard magneto - optical effects in a static magnetic field , observed in these configurations , in conformity with the symmetry of the problem , correspond to the cases of magnetic - field - induced circular and linear anisotropy .",
    "this is not the case , however , for fluctuations of the magneto - optical anisotropy , which may break the symmetry of the problem .          the simplest experimental geometry for measuring the fr noise , which may seem the most natural , implies detection of _ longitudinal _ fluctuations of the magnetization , with the probe laser beam aligned along the external magnetic field and along the equilibrium magnetization of the spin - system ( faraday configuration , fig . 6 , left panel ) .",
    "in this case , the detected fluctuations of the magnetization do not break axial symmetry of the system .",
    "dynamics of these fluctuations is controlled by the only relevant characteristic time - longitudinal spin relaxation time @xmath23 , which determines the correlation and spectral characteristics of this random process . in the time domain , the longitudinal fr noise ( fig .",
    "6,b , left panel ) looks as a `` white '' noise with the removed higher frequencies ( exceeding the relaxation rate @xmath24 ) .",
    "the autocorrelation function , correspondingly , acquires exponential shape ( rather than @xmath25-wise , as for the `` white '' noise ) with the characteristic time @xmath23 ( fig .",
    "6,c , left panel ) , while the power spectrum of the process , given by fourier transform of the autocorrelation function , is a lorentzian centered at zero frequency with the width determined by the relaxation rate @xmath24 ( fig . 6,d , left panel ) .",
    "thus , by measuring the fr noise spectrum in the faraday geometry , we can obtain information about time @xmath23 , its dependence on magnetic field , temperature , and other external parameters , i.e. , about properties of the system usually obtained from the data of epr spectroscopy or from nonresonant magnetic measurements in oscillating magnetic fields .",
    "it is worth to note that this experimental approach has much in common with the paramagnetic relaxation technique which has been developed by the dutch physicist c. gorter @xcite for measuring magnetic susceptibility of paramagnets in parallel fields and was later transferred to optical basis with the aid of laser polarimetry @xcite . in gorter",
    "s technique , dynamics of the spin - system is studied by measuring its linear response to a rf magnetic field applied along the dc field .",
    "the essential difference between these two approaches is that in the case of noise spectroscopy , the system is not supposed to be perturbed by the external oscillating field . in terms of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem ,",
    "the longitudinal magnetization noise ( or the fr moise ) is the counterpart of the linear magnetic ( or magneto - optic)response observed in parallel fields .    in this longitudinal geometry",
    ", however , the noise spectrum is located in the vicinity of zero frequencies where the measurements are often hampered by the universal @xmath26 ( flicker ) noise .",
    "in addition , spectrum of the longitudinal fluctuations of magnetization , bringing much data about relaxation characteristics of the system , does not contain any information about its magnetic splitting , which is highly important for characterization of the spin - system .",
    "the above drawbacks of the faraday configuration can be easily overcome by passing to the voigt geometry ( fig .",
    "6 , right panel ) . in this cobfifuration",
    ", the light beam traveling through the paramagnet across the applied magnetic field will detect transverse magnetization of the spin - system , which , by symmetry considerations , should vanish in this geometry and may arise only due to spontaneous violation of the symmetry by fluctuations .",
    "in this configuration , any random transverse fluctuation of magnetization will precess around the magnetic field direction during the transverse relaxation time @xmath27 ( or what is usually called @xmath28 , when the spin - system is inhomogeneous ) and then will be replaced by another realization of the transverse fluctuating magnetization with another magnitude and another phase of precession . as a result , the probe light beam will exhibit randomly oscillating fr at larmor frequency ( fig.6,b , right panel ) .",
    "correlation function of this random process will now have the shape of oscillatory decay with the characteristic time @xmath29 ( fig .",
    "6,c , right panel ) .",
    "the peak of the fr noise spectrum will now be shifted away from zero frequency , and the width of the peak will be determined by the dephasing time @xmath27 ( or @xmath28 ) of the spin - system ( fig .",
    "6,d , right panel ) . in other words ,",
    "the fr noise spectrum will present , in this geometry , the _ magnetic resonance spectrum _ of the spin - system .",
    "the idea of detecting magnetic resonance in the noise of the spin - system magnetization was first mentioned by f. bloch @xcite in 1946 .",
    "an essential contribution to understanding of optical manifestations of spin - system magnetization , spin precession , and spin dynamics and , implicitly , to optical detection of magnetization noise , was made by a. kastler in his works on optical pumping @xcite .",
    "the fr noise spectroscopy is closely related to the time resolved faraday rotation @xcite and may be considered as its incoherent version .",
    "a specific feature of the sns is that it is , in fact , not a _ spectroscopy of response _ , and , therefore , the magnitude of the detected signal ( _ noise signal _ ) can not be controlled by varying the strength of the perturbation .",
    "in addition , magnitude of the magnetization ( and fr ) noise , for a macroscopic sample , as was already mentioned , should be extremely small as compared with the values of `` coherent '' magnetization ( or magnetization of saturation ) induced , by the external perturbation acting in the same way upon all the spins of the ensemble .",
    "thus , it is clear that the problem of polarimetric sensitivity may have a critical importance for the spin noise spectroscopy .",
    "the sensitivity of polarimetric measurements in optics is known to be fundamentally limited by the so - called photon noise or shot noise of the detector photocurrent in accordance with the relationship ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath30 ( @xmath31 is the angle of the polarization plane rotation detected with the signal - to - noise ratio equal to unity , @xmath32 is the bandwidth of the detection channel , @xmath33 is the light intensity measured in the number of photons per second , is supposed to be given in photons per second . ] and @xmath34 is the quantum yield of the photodetector ) .",
    "for instance , for the light power 20 mw , wavelength 550 nm , and bandwidth 1 hz , this quantity lies in the range of @xmath35 rad .",
    "such a sensitivity , as may be shown by appropriate estimates , is high enough to solve , in many cases , the problem of spin noise detection .",
    "the most frequent reason why the shot - noise - limited sensitivity can not be achieved with the lasers ( which are considered , in this context , the only suitable light sources ) is related to their excess noise , which may exceed the shot - noise level by a few orders of magnitude .",
    "the excess noise can be suppressed using different expedients @xcite , the simplest and most efficient of them being _ balanced detector _ ( fig.7,a ) .",
    "( right side ) .",
    "( a )  standard @xmath36-geometry . at @xmath37 ,",
    "the photocurrents become equal , and the current flowing through the resistor @xmath38 vanishes for any light intensity .",
    "( b )  the scheme with variable polarization extinction .",
    "the beam is split by a non - polarizing beamsplitter ( npbs ) , retaining polarization of the light beam , and the level of polarization extinction is set in each arm independently ( using polarizers @xmath39 and @xmath40 ) to equalize photocurrents . at high extinction",
    "( at small angles of detuning @xmath25 from the crossed position ) , the steepness of the dependence @xmath41 may become much higher .",
    "pd1 and pd2 - photodetectors , p1 and p2 - polarizers .",
    ", width=453 ]    the linearly polarized light beam whose polarization behavior is examined passes through a polarization beamsplitter with its two outputs coupled to two photodetectors . the photodetectors are included into a differential circuit so that their photocurrents are subtracted at the load resistor @xmath38 .",
    "when the polarization plane of the incident light makes an angle of @xmath36 with polarizing directions of the beamsplitter , photocurrents of the two detectors cancel at the resistor ( regardless of the light intensity and its variations ) . at the same time , the changes of the photocurrent related to variations of the light beam polarization plane are always anticorrelated ( have opposite signs ) and , as a result , are summed up . in this way",
    ", it is possible , in practice , to suppress the excess intensity noise by approximately three orders of magnitude and to achieve the shot - noise limit of polarimetric sensitivity with noisy laser sources .",
    "for the first time , as far as we know , the shot - noise - limited polarimetric sensitivity has been realized ( with the use of the balanced detector ) , in @xcite .",
    "nowadays , the balanced detectors are produced commercially and , in combination with polarization beamsplitters , are commonly used in the high - sensitive polarimeters .",
    "there are some other interesting methods of the excess noise suppression based on the fact that the shot - noise - limited polarimetric sensitivity does not substantially change when the angle between the analyzer and polarization plane varies from @xmath42 to total extinction .",
    "indeed , when moving towards the total extinction ( let it be @xmath43 ) , the polarimetric response ( @xmath44 ) varies approximately linearly with @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "at the same time , the transmitted light intensity at small @xmath45 varies as @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) providing the shot noise ( varying as @xmath49 ) also proportional to @xmath45 .",
    "thus , the signal - to - noise ratio remains in this range of angles @xmath45 practically the same ( to within the factor @xmath50 ) . in reality , however , this conclusion is violated at small @xmath45 either because of nonideality of the polarization system ( the extinction ratio of the polarizers usually can not be smaller than 10@xmath51  10@xmath52 , or when the detected light intensity noise sinks in the noise of electronics .    in the absence of excess fluctuations ,",
    "capable of reducing polarimetric sensitivity , the high - extinction polarization geometries can still be used for other purpose , namely , to raise the probe beam intensity ( and thus to increase the shot - noise - limited polarimetric sensitivity ) leaving the input light power on the detectors at low level .",
    "this is especially important for the sns , which employs broadband photodetectors with small photosensitive area unable to endure high input power .",
    "one of the methods that allows one to realize the high - extinction polarization geometry and , at the same time , to retain opportunity to further suppress the excess intensity noise is based on the use of polarization pile , which serves , in this case , as a dichroic medium with no birefringence .",
    "as has been shown in @xcite , the polarization pile makes it possible to considerably magnify the polarization plane rotation angle at the expense of reduction of the beam intensity .",
    "this gadget can also be used for choosing favorable ratio between intensity of the light passing through the sample and the input light power of the photodetector with no loss in sensitivity .    among other high - extinction polarization geometries",
    "can be mentioned the scheme with polarization - insensitive beamsplitter and independent adjustments of polarization extinction in two channels ( fig.7,b ) .",
    "this method has all the merits of the polarization pile , but can be easier realized experimentally .    as applied to measurements of the spin - system magnetization noise ,",
    "there are certain additional requirements that should be met .",
    "in particular , the wavelength of the probe laser beam should provide the most efficient conversion of the magnetization noise to that of the fr ( this wavelength does not necessarily coincide with the region of the greatest verdet constant of the system , see below ) .",
    "the other requirement is related to maximizing fr per a single spin , which can be achieved by reducing cross section of the probed volume and increasing its length .",
    "indeed , let we probe a paramagnet with the length @xmath53 and spin density @xmath54 by the light beam with the cross section @xmath55 ( all quantum systems of the ensemble are supposed to be identical ) .",
    "then , the number of spins confined in the beam will be @xmath56 .",
    "fluctuations of the faraday rotation at the exit of the paramagnet will be proportional to fluctuations of this quantity ( @xmath57 ) and to the total , independent of @xmath55 , faraday rotation ( @xmath58 ) . as a result , for the fr noise , we have @xmath59 so , for a given paramagnetic sample , the fr noise varies in inverse proportion with the radius of the light spot @xcite .",
    "this is a highly important feature of the sns , which implies that the spin noise ( with all other factors being the same ) _ increases _ with decreasing number of spins .",
    "this is why , in the sns , the probe laser beam passing through the sample should be preferably tightly focused .",
    "note that , using the light beam for detecting spin fluctuations , we probe a fluctuating medium ( spin - system ) by a fluctuating agent ( photon flux ) and measure intensity fluctuations of the light on the background of its own shot noise @xcite .",
    "it may seem , at first sight , that the spin noise can be detected only when the noise introduced by the spin - system exceeds ( or is comparable with ) the shot noise of the probe beam . in reality , however , this is not the case .",
    "as can be shown , the mean - square level of poissonian noise transmitted through a lorentzian filter with the bandwidth @xmath60 for the accumulation time @xmath61 can be measured with a relative accuracy of @xmath62^{1/2}$ ] ( @xmath63 is the photocurrent and @xmath64 is the electron charge ) , which turns into the known factor @xmath65 at sufficiently large photocurrents ( @xmath66 ) @xcite .",
    "so , one can easily estimate that , under real experimental conditions and for sufficiently large accumulation times , the factor @xmath67 may reach many orders of magnitude . as a result , the shot - noise power appears to be defined with a fairly high accuracy and , in the form of a stable spectral background , does not preclude measuring intensity fluctuations whose power lies essentially below the shot noise level .",
    "the first experiment on detection of magnetic resonance in the fr noise spectrum @xcite was performed on sodium atoms in the atmosphere of buffer gas ( neon , @xmath68 10 torr ) .",
    "schematic of the experimental setup is shown in fig.8 .        as a light source",
    ", we used a cw dye laser tuned to close vicinity of the d1 or d2 absorption line of na .",
    "the cell with sodium vapor was placed into a transverse magnetic field created by a pair of helmholtz coils .",
    "the field was slightly modulated at a frequency of @xmath69 hz .",
    "the differential signal of the balanced photodetector was first filtered by a resonant circuit at a frequency of 1.3 mhz , then selectively amplified , quadratically detected ( rectified ) , lock - in amplified at the field modulation frequency , and recorded as a function of the applied magnetic field . in other words , the magnetic resonance frequency was swept with respect to resonance frequency of the photodetection system ( much like the resonance frequency is swept with respect to frequency of the rf or microwave oscillator in conventional epr spectroscopy ) .",
    "figure 9 shows two typical plots of the detected spin - noise resonance .",
    "the probe beam was tuned to the edge of d1 line or to the midpoint between the two lines .",
    "polarimetric signal of the fr noise , in this experiment , substantially exceeded the shot noise level , and the signal - to - noise ratio ( or , better to say , the ratio of useful noise to harmful noise ) for the accumulation time 2 s , was close to 100:1 .",
    "this was the first experimental demonstration of feasibility of the spin noise spectroscopy .      in 1985",
    ", there has been performed the experiment @xcite on nuclear spin noise , which did not have anything to do with the fr technique , but ideologically was identical to the experiment @xcite . as a spin - system , in that experiment , was used an ensemble of nuclei @xmath70cl in the naclo@xmath71 crystal .",
    "the experiment was performed at 4 k , and the magnetization noise was detected in a straightforward way using a squid sensor .",
    "this work has considerably contributed to the sns as a first observation of the resonant spin noise in a nuclear spin - system predicted by f. bloch @xcite . here , the number of spins contributed to the signal was much greater than in the experiment with electron spins @xcite , and the noise signal was expected to be extremely small .",
    "indeed , the peak of spin noise at the frequency of nuclear quadrupole resonance of @xmath70cl was detected with the signal - to - noise ratio of a few units for the accumulation time of 7 hrs .",
    "still , further technical advances in this area made it possible to observe the nuclear spin noise at room temperature @xcite and even to develop , on its basis , an efficient method of nuclear spin - noise imaging @xcite .",
    "this technique , though less sensitive than the conventional method of nmr imaging , may be indispensable , in certain cases , as an entirely noninvasive tomography that does not use any external rf or x - ray fields .",
    "the effect of magnetic resonance in the fr noise spectrum remained practically unnoticed , as a possible experimental tool of magnetic - resonance spectroscopy , until the verge of our century , when , with some modifications , it was reproduced on other alkaline atoms and then applied to semiconductor systems .",
    "below , we will briefly outline the main steps in the development of the experimental sns . .",
    "in 2000 , an interesting experiment was performed by t. mitsui @xcite , who independently observed optically detected spontaneous spin noise of rubidium atoms at the larmor frequency .",
    "the idea of the experiment was the same , but realized differently : the magnetization noise was detected in the optical absorption , rather than in the faraday rotation , of the atomic vapor .",
    "a circularly polarized beam of a diode laser , tuned in resonance with the d1 absorption linea of @xmath72rb ( 5 @xmath73s@xmath74 - @xmath73p@xmath74 ) was transmitted through the cell with atomic vapor at 80@xmath75c placed into a transverse magnetic field . to simplify qualitative analysis of the results ,",
    "the transition was strongly broadened ( up to 6 ghz ) by a buffer gas ( nitrogen ) at 200 torr .",
    "fluctuations of the spin - system magnetization , in this experiment , were observed in the intensity ( rather than fr ) noise spectrum of the transmitted light .",
    "a specific feature of this approach was that the excess intensity noise of the light source , in this case , should have been eliminated before the sample , rather than suppressed after it , because , otherwise , it could induce nonlinear effects undesirable in this experiment ( they were studied independently ) .",
    "the laser source used for these measurements was characterized by extremely low excess intensity fluctuations , and , therefore , there was no need to employ balanced detector for their suppression .    in that experiment ,",
    "fluctuations of the spin - system magnetization were , in fact , detected by the noise of the mcd ( rather than fr ) of the paramagnet . from the viewpoint of linear optics , these two quantities ( mcd and fr ) ,",
    "being connected through the kramers - kronig relations , are identical and should give the same results unless the optical excitation affects spin dynamics of the system .",
    "at the same time , in the mcd - based measurements , each act of absorption interrupts spin precession of the atom , and it may seem that the later absorption events can not be correlated , in any way , with the previous .",
    "the author has shown , however , that this is not the case for a thermodynamically fluctuating spin - system , and the mcd - based method of the spin noise detection , which looks more perturbative than the one based on the fr , is also applicable to macroscopic systems .",
    "it is worth to note here that the question about possibility of detecting superposition states of a quantum system ( as , e.g. , a precessing spin ) in the noise spectrum of electromagnetic field is not trivial .",
    "in particular , it has been shown in @xcite that the spontaneous emission noise spectrum of an atomic medium excited randomly , in a poissonian way , does not reveal any features related to its decay kinetics .",
    "it means that the intensity fluctuations of spontaneous emission excited stationary in this way can not be used for detecting spin noise in the excited state of the atoms .",
    "a rigorous quantum - mechanical description of the intensity - fluctuation spectrum of spontaneous emission is given in @xcite .    in 2004 ,",
    "s. crooker et al .",
    "@xcite examined in more detail the spin - noise spectra of rb and @xmath76k atoms using the fr - based method and provided a deeper insight into capabilities of this technique .",
    "it was shown , in particular , that magnetic resonance in the fr noise spectrum can be also observed in the faraday configuration ( in longitudinal magnetic field ) .",
    "this is possible , in conformity with the fluctuation - dissipation theorem , for the esr transitions allowed in the ac magnetic field oscillating along the external dc field .",
    "an illustration of such a situation was presented in @xcite , where the resonances of this type were originated from transitions with @xmath77 ( @xmath78 is the projection of the total angular momentum of the state ) in @xmath76k atoms .",
    "one of the questions that arose after successful detection of spin noise in atomic gases , with strongly off - resonant probing of the system , was whether this technique could be considered as nonperturbative or not . at first glance",
    ", it looked fairly passive or nonperturbative because it utilized faraday rotation in the transparency region , the probe beam did not induce any real electronic transitions and , therefore , did not disturb the spin - system under study . on the other hand , however , it could not be nonperturbative for evident reasons : the initially monochromatic probe light , after passing through the medium , became modulated and thus acquired sidebands with shifted frequencies .",
    "it means that some photons of the beam experienced inelastic interaction with the medium inevitably accompanied by some energy exchange between the light and the spin - system .",
    "it is also known that the effect of transparent medium on polarization of the light beam is accompanied by the back action of the light upon the medium even in static magnetic field @xcite .",
    "this contradiction was resolved by gorbovitskii and perel @xcite who have shown that the noise of the fr at the frequency of larmor precession can be considered as a result of _ coherent forward raman scattering _ of the probe laser light by the ensemble of spins randomly precessing in the transverse magnetic field .",
    "the oscillating polarization in the probe beam arises dues to interference of the forward - scattered light with the light directly transmitted by the medium .",
    "this effect , according to @xcite , is analogous to the effect of optical mixing used in @xcite for studying brilloin scattering .",
    "so , this process can be regarded as nonperturbative , because the probe light interacts with macroscopic fluctuations of the system , and does not select any particular spin to flip .",
    "such a conclusion is supported by the possibility to observe magnetic resonance in the mcd noise , when each absorption event explicitly destroys coherent superposition of the ground - state sublevels .",
    "the technique evidently becomes more and more perturbative as we pass from macroscopic ensembles to microscopic ones .",
    "note that in semiconductors , which are more complicated than pure atoms and can not be treated in the framework of so simple models , a small residual absorption may dramatically affect properties of the spin - system under study even in the regions of nominal optical transparency @xcite .",
    "the atomic systems , mainly alkali atoms , as the most convenient model objects of sns , have been widely used in fundamental research related to non - demolition measurements and interaction between squeezed states of light and matter .",
    "it was shown , in particular , that the spin - noise measurements performed in the region of optical transparency make it possible to surpass the standard quantum limit of phase measurements and thus to produce the squeezed atomic spin states ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this interesting topic and associated experimental results , however , lie outside the scope of this review .",
    "it is worth to mention here another experimental approach to the optical detection of incoherent spin precession , usually also regarded as a sort of noise spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "this approach is based on transformation of modulation spectrum of the light transmitted through a paramagnet in the voigt geometry . in this case",
    ", the light beam serves simultaneously as a probe and as a pump , and its modulation ( either in intensity or in polarization ) is supposed to be equivalent to modulation of the effective magnetic field applied along the light propagation .",
    "this can be achieved either by intensity modulation of a circularly polarized beam or by modulating the degree of its circular polarization .",
    "experimental setup for these measurements may look as shown in fig .",
    "10 .",
    "it is well known that the coherent larmor precession of a spin - system can be induced optically by the resonant pump light modulated at the appropriate frequency .",
    "the first experimental observations of the optically driven spin precession were announced in @xcite .",
    "the effect was detected in the vapors of alkali metals ( cs and rb ) and in metastable helium .",
    "the cell was resonantly pumped by circularly polarized light propagating across the applied magnetic field and modulated in intensity at the frequency close to that of larmor precession of the spin - system .",
    "the resonance was observed as a peak in the transmitted light intensity at the point where the modulation frequency coincided with that of the ground - state zeeman splitting .",
    "this effect of optically driven spin precession , often referred to as ` optical orientation in the rotating coordinate frame ' or as a ` resonance of coherence ' , is very close , in its physical content , to the effects of coherent population trapping @xcite and electromagnetically induced transparency @xcite .",
    "all these effects imply excitation of coherent superposition of two states ( in our case - of two low - lying states ) by superposition of two optical fields ( or by a single modulated field , which is practically the same ) .",
    "the `` active '' spin noise spectroscopy exploits the same ideal , but uses , for this purpose , the pump modulated by more or less `` white '' noise ( rather than harmonically ) . under these conditions ,",
    "the system is offered , so to say , to choose by its own the frequency component capable of inducing its larmor precession .",
    "this approach utilizes the effects of nonlinear optics and is evidently essentially perturbative .",
    "regularities of the `` active '' sns strongly differ from those of the fr - based spectroscopy of spontaneous spin noise . at the same time , in certain respects , it can be more convenient in practice and may provide additional information about the system not related directly to its magnetic properties .    from the viewpoint of experimentalist , this type of noise spectroscopy is , in many respects , the exact opposite of the fr - based sns : it does not imply high polarimetric sensitivity and the laser intensity noise should be well pronounced or even purposely increased , rather than suppressed . the laser beam is not supposed to be tightly focused on the sample to reduce the number of spins participating in formation of the signal . at the same time , the light power density on the sample , in these measurements , should be high enough to provide the required optical nonlinearity . as has been shown in @xcite ,",
    "under sufficiently high power densities , when the rabi frequency becomes comparable with relaxation rates of the excited state , the intensity noise spectrum of the transmitted light becomes much more complicated , with its peaks and singularities not connected in a straightforward way with the zeeman and rabi frequencies of the system .",
    "this technique of noise spectroscopy , as far as we know , was applied so far only to atomic systems . as the noisy light sources , in those experiments ,",
    "were used diode lasers with the frequency - modulated output emission which was converted into the intensity - modulated light in the process of its interaction with narrow spectral features of the sample under study . meanwhile",
    ", the `` active '' noise spectroscopy , in our opinion , is a promising method of research that may find application in experimental studies of solid - state ( including semiconductor ) systems highly important for the up - to - date photonics and information science .",
    "the experimental setups , with the laser sources intentionally modulated in intensity or in polarization in a broad frequency range may be useful in the cases when the nonperturbative nature of the sns is not of primary importance .",
    "it should be noted that this method of nonlinear optics may provide information inaccessible to the conventional sns and lying far beyond the bounds of the field of magnetic resonance and spin dynamics .",
    "atomic gases seemed to be highly favorable objects of the sns due to their intense and narrow optical resonances providing strong peaks of fr in the vicinity of the lines ( the so - called macaluso - corbino effect ) .",
    "semiconductors and other solid - state systems with their broader optical spectra did not look so promising .",
    "still , in 2005 , oestreich et al .",
    "@xcite have managed to successfully apply this technique to a solid semiconductor system .",
    "the measurements were performed on a thick @xmath79-doped gaas wafer at 10 k with the wavelength of the probe laser @xmath80 nm below the gaas bandgap .",
    "the level of si - doping ( @xmath81 @xmath82 ) was chosen corresponding to the longest spin dephasing time measured using the femtosecond time - resolved faraday rotation technique @xcite .",
    "the fr noise of the sample placed into a transverse magnetic field was detected with a broadband balanced photoreceiver and conventional sweeping spectrum analyzer in the frequency range of 200 - 400 mhz .",
    "behavior of the discovered peaks well correlated with the known magnetic - resonance and relaxation properties of the donor - bound electrons in @xmath79-gaas .",
    "this work was , at that moment , more of fundamental than practical significance since the accumulation time needed to reliably detect the noise signal lied in the range of several hours .",
    "still , in these experiments , the authors have successfully used , for the first time , the sns technique for measuring the electron lande @xmath83-factor and electron spin relaxation time in a semiconductor ( @xmath79-gaas ) and have demonstrated applicability of sns to semiconductor systems , thus laying the foundation for the semiconductor sns ( see the review @xcite ) .",
    "the `` academic '' period of the sns was completed when it became possible to perform these measurements for much shorter times in a wider frequency range on system of greater practical importance .",
    "a real breakthrough in this field of research was made when the sweeping spectrum analyzer , in the system of data acquisition , has been replaced by the one with the real - time fast fourier transform ( fft ) processing system with a wide frequency range @xcite . the conventional sweeping spectrum analyzer , as is known , measures the signal only in a narrow frequency interval at a time and , therefore , constantly disregards most information containing in the time - dependent signal .",
    "the fft spectrum analyzer , on the contrary , is capable of using the whole bulk of incoming information .",
    "it digitizes the signal in the whole bandwidth of the system ( with a sampling rate of around @xmath84 s@xmath85 ) , performs fft of the signal _ in real time _ , and accumulates the spectrum thus obtained . in other words",
    ", it accumulates signals in all frequency channels simultaneously , rather than only in a single channel . as a result",
    ", the accumulation time needed to achieve the same signal - to - noise ratio has decreased by a few orders of magnitude . the process of accumulation of the signal is schematically illustrated by fig . 11 .",
    "this technical advancement has turned the sns into a real practical tool of magnetic spectroscopy and made it suitable , in particular , for studying spin dynamics of low - dimensional semiconductor systems ( quantum wells , quantum dots , quantum wires ) highly important for the present - day applications in photonics and optoelectronics .",
    "another interesting idea was proposed by mller et al .",
    "@xcite to overcome bandwidth limitations of the optical detectors . for that purpose",
    ", it was proposed to use a pulsed laser with a high repetition rate ( e.g. , a mode - locked laser ) instead of a cw laser , as a source of the probe light . in this case , the intensity spectrum of the light comprises a comb of discrete lines spaced by the pulse repetition rate @xmath86 , and it becomes possible to observe , in the spectrum of the detected fr noise signal , not only the peak at the frequency of magnetic resonance @xmath87 , but also the peaks at the frequencies shifted from @xmath87 towards lower frequency by multiples of the repetition rate @xmath86 ( provided that @xmath88 ) . as a result , by mixing the resonance signal with the nearest peak of the probe beam intensity spectrum , the frequency of the spin noise resonance can be transferred to the frequency range @xmath89 $ ] .",
    "this experimental approach allowed the authors to detect spin noise at larmor frequencies up to 16 ghz . under these conditions , the total bandwidth of the detection system ( including spectrum analyzer )",
    "may not exceed the repetition rate @xmath86 . at the same time , the measured spin dephasing rates are limited , in this technique , by approximately half the repetition rate . as noted in @xcite , the sensitivity of this technique is not reduced as compared to the conventional sns .    .",
    "( b)- dependence of the noise signal on the time delay .",
    "vectorial diagrams show summation of contributions of the two pulses to the fr signal for different ratios of the time delay @xmath90 and the larmor precession period @xmath91 .",
    "( c )  the resulted dependence of the noise signal on the time delay @xmath90 , corresponding to resonant transient of the system or its autocorrelation function , and the spin resonance spectrum obtained by fourier transform of the autocorrelation function . , width=377 ]    one more remarkable approach to the problem of bandwidth of the fr - based sns was proposed in @xcite .",
    "the idea of the approach was to take advantage of an extremely broad spectrum of the femtosecond ( or picosecond ) light pulses emitted by the mode - locked ti - sapphire laser and to measure correlation characteristics of the fr noise with a very high temporal resolution inaccessible to conventional photodetectors .",
    "for that purpose , the sample under study was suggested to be probed by a train of pairs of ultrashort pulses with the time interval between them variable within the range comparable with the period of larmor precession of the system ( fig.12,a ) . in spite of the fact that the two closely spaced pulses are not resolved by the detection system , the detected fr noise will depend on the time interval between them ( provided that there is some distinguished oscillation frequency ( and , therefore , a distinguished characteristic time ) in the fr noise , as shown in fig .",
    "in particular , when the time interval between the pulses is equal to integer number of the oscillation periods , then contributions of this oscillating process to both pulses will have the same sign , and total fr of this pair of pulses will fluctuate . if , however , the time interval between the pulses equals odd number of half - periods of the oscillation , then contributions of these oscillations to the two pulses will compensate for each other , so that total contribution of this process to fr of the pair of pulses will vanish .",
    "thus , by scanning the time delay between the two pulses of the probe beam and detecting the fr noise power in the transmitted light , we will observe an oscillatory transient of the process directly corresponding to its correlation function , whose fourier transform provides the autocorresponding spin - noise spectrum ( fig .",
    "it is important that the two pulses are not supposed to be resolved by the detection system .",
    "the efficiency of this ultrafast sns has been recently successfully demonstrated experimentally on a heavily @xmath79-doped bulk gaas @xcite .",
    "the train of picosecond pulses was produced , in that experiment , by two synchronized lasers with a repetition rate of 80 mhz .",
    "this technique , that implies measuring autocorrelation function instead of its fourier image , should allow one to directly detect decay of the transverse magnetization in time domain and to extend the accessible frequency range up to several thz .",
    "the above proposals demonstrating possibility of considerable extension of the sns bandwidth give promise that this technique will find application in the epr spectroscopy of standard microwave ranges for nonperturbative investigations of transparent paramagnets .",
    "in spite of remarkable advances in the data acquisition technique , the problem of polarimetric sensitivity retains its significance in the fr - based sns , and all suggestions that can help to improve this characteristic remain to be of great interest .",
    "it is well known that faraday rotation can be strongly enhanced with the aid of a fabry - perot cavities @xcite , due to multiple passes of the light through the magneto - optical medium .",
    "such an approach is especially popular nowadays for studying dynamics of spin states of low - dimensional semiconductor structures in high - finesse microcavities , where the observed fr can be increased by a few orders of magnitude . in these studies ,",
    "it is usually tacitly assumed that the measured times are much longer than intrinsic times of the cavity ( the cavity photon lifetime and intermode beat period ) .",
    "this is really the case for microcavities , when the photon round - trip time over the cavity is equal or just a few times longer than the oscillation period of the light wave .",
    "when , however , this is not the case , and the fr oscillation frequency becomes comparable with or higher than that of the intermode beats , the response of the cavity becomes more complicated .    in @xcite , it was shown that polarization of a monochromatic light resonant to a longitudinal mode of a fabry - perot cavity , may be highly sensitive to modulation of the intracavity anisotropy at frequencies multiple of spacing between its longitudinal modes .",
    "this effect can be qualitatively understood in terms of the light traveling over the cavity back and forth and has much in common with the known effect of mode - locking in lasers @xcite .",
    "indeed , intuitively it seems evident that enhancement of the cavity s response to a weak oscillating optical anisotropy of the intracavity element will be observed when the light moving back and forth inside the cavity finds this element with the same phase of the oscillation , so that the new contribution to the light polarization state is added to those already accumulated .",
    "this reasoning , though formally incorrect ( being inapplicable to a monochromatic wave ) , proves to be useful for qualitative understanding of the resonant fr enhancement effect .",
    "this effect can be also interpreted in terms of spectral transformation of the light passing through a polarization modulator : the resonant enhancement of the fr occurs when the modulation frequency coincides with intermode spacing of the fabry - perot cavity , and the sidebands of the modulated laser light hit adjacent modes of the resonator .",
    "figure 13 shows frequency dependence of the polarization modulation gain factor ( @xmath92 ) for two different positions of the anisotropic element inside the cavity ( for more detail , see @xcite ) . for the sample placed in the middle of the cavity ( a )",
    ", the light hits the sample twice per a round - trip , and , correspondingly , the effect of enhancement can be observed at frequencies that are by a factor of two lower than those for the sample placed at the edge of the cavity ( b ) .    ) in a fabry - perot cavity for the sample placed at the edge of the cavity ( a ) and in the middle of it ( b ) .",
    "the frequency @xmath93 is given in the units of intermode spacing @xmath94 .",
    "figure ( c ) illustrates synchronism of the light traveling over the cavity with oscillations of anisotropy of the intracavity sample ( for @xmath95 ) .",
    "the layers in the center of the cavity and near its edge ( colored green ) depict the medium with oscillating anisotropy , black sinusoid is the time variation of the anisotropy , and red lines show propagation of the light beam.,width=302 ]    amplification , in this scheme , is realized in the optical ( rather than electronic ) channel , and the corresponding gain factor proves to be approximately equal to the cavity q - factor ( @xmath96 ) . in other words ,",
    "the fabry - perot cavity can be used as a _ selective optical amplifier _ of a polarization signal produced by intracavity element at the frequency of intermode spacing ( @xmath94 , @xmath3 is the cavity length and @xmath97 is the speed of light ) or its multiples ( @xmath98 , @xmath79 is the integer ) .",
    "this effect can evidently be helpful in sns for amplification of the polarization modulation arising in the probe light beam due to the random spin precession of the spin - system .",
    "it is noteworthy that the increase in the fr signal in this method is achieved , exactly as in the case of high - extinction polarimetric measurements , at the expense of strongly increasing power density on the sample , which should be taken into account in the experiments . .",
    "one more curious possibility of application of this effect is related to prospects of creating an all - optical spin - noise spectrometer @xcite .",
    "the idea of this proposal combines the effect of amplification of the polarization signal with its optical quadratic detection .",
    "let the studied transparent paramagnetic sample be placed inside an optical cavity ( fig.14 ) .",
    "a monochromatic linearly polarized laser beam incident upon the cavity coincides in frequency with one of its longitudinal modes and thus passes through the cavity with no loss . at the exit of the cavity , we        place a linear polarizer in a crossed position , so that no light passes through the system .",
    "now , we start sweeping the transverse magnetic field applied to the sample . at the moment when the larmor precession frequency of the spins becomes equal to ( or multiple of ) the double intermode frequency of the cavity ( @xmath99 ) , oscillations of the fr appear to be strongly enhanced by the cavity , and the light intensity at the exit ( after the output polarizer ) becomes nonzero .",
    "a unique property of this system is that it allows one to detect magnetic resonance in the fr noise spectrum at any frequency without any broadband electronics and broadband photodetectors - all the needed information is contained in the dc optical signal .",
    "what is observed here is just a result of resonant coupling of the spin - system with the fabry - perot cavity .",
    "it is clear that such a design of the all - optical spin spectrometer imposes heavy demands both on q - value of the cavity and on extinction ratio of the polarization system .",
    "still , it seems feasible and may be useful , in particular , for applied purposes , as a basic system for magnetometers of new generation .",
    "a considerable interest has been currently attracted to particularities of spin - noise spectroscopy under conditions of resonant or near - resonant optical probing of the spin - system ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is clear that , generally speaking , the sns , in this case , looses its important property of being perturbation - free , when the probe laser beam induces real optical transitions . at the same time , the degree of perturbation of the spin - system by the probe beam depends on how large is the optical excitation rate compared with the dephasing rate of the spin - system , and , in most cases , the light power density can be decreased to the level when optical perturbation of the system may be neglected ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . under these conditions ,",
    "the sns acquires additional remarkable properties @xcite .",
    "interesting possibilities of sns stems from the question about mutual correlations of the fr noise at different wavelengths of the probe beam . in @xcite , it was pointed out that these correlations depend on whether the appropriate fluctuations are contributed by the same spin ensemble ( ensemble of identical quantum systems ) or not .",
    "it is important that this fact can be revealed not only in a straightforward way in the cross - correlation spectral characteristics of the fr noise ( which may be thought of ) , but also , much easier , in optical spectra of the fr noise power , which , generally , appear to be related to the conventional fr spectra in a nontrivial way .",
    "the use of the probe beam wavelength as a tunable parameter of the standard spin noise spectroscopy allows one to look at this technique as at a sort of _ optical spectroscopy_. such an approach makes it possible , in certain cases , to detect the structure of optical transitions hidden in the linear optical or magneto - optical spectra and , thus , opens new possibilities of the sns technique .",
    "let us consider dependence of the _ integrated fr - noise _ ( spin noise ) power on the probe beam frequency . as was already mentioned , the fr - based sns exploits `` paramagnetic '' part of the faraday rotation to monitor magnetization of the spin - system .",
    "it seems evident that , to make conversion of the spin - system magnetization to the fr most efficient , one has to select the wavelength of the probe light in the region of the greatest fr ( greatest verdet constant ) , and , vice versa , the fr noise can not be detected at the wavelengths where the fr proper turns into zero .",
    "it was shown , however , that this is not the case .",
    "magnetization of a macroscopic spin - system is created by an ensemble of individual spins whose optical spectra may be either identical or different . as a result",
    ", the magnetization noise of the spin - system may be transformed into that of the fr in different ways .",
    "if optical spectrum of a paramagnet comprises several spectral features , then the fr angle @xmath45 at each frequency @xmath100 will be given by the sum of partial contributions of all these features : @xmath101 when all the spins of the system are identical , and optical spectrum of the whole ensemble just reproduces the one corresponding to an individual spin - system , then fluctuations of the fr will be evidently _ coherent _ or _ correlated _ over the whole spectrum , and spectral dependence of the mean - square fluctuation of the fr @xmath102 will be proportional to the square of the total fr ( square of sum of partial contributions ) : @xmath103 when , however , the paramagnet under study contains several spin subsystems with different optical spectra , their contributions of these subsystems to the fr noise will fluctuate _ independently _ , in uncorrelated way , and optical spectrum of the fr noise will be described by the _ sum of squares _ of the individual contributions rather than by their sum squared : @xmath104 as a result , optical spectra of spin noise in these two cases , due to different interference of partial contributions in the region of their overlap , may be essentially different .",
    "figure 15 illustrates this difference for two closely spaced absorption lines associated either with the same spin - system or with different ( independent ) ones characterized by different optical spectra .",
    "spectral dependence of the fr is taken here in the form of a dispersion - like curve characteristic of the `` paramagnetic '' part of the fr for the band with the width substantially exceeding magnetic splitting of the optical transition .",
    "one can see that the distinction between these two spectra ( fig .",
    "15 , c , d ) is most        pronounced in the region between the lines , where contributions of two optical transitions either compensate for each other ( for a single spin - system , fig .",
    "15 , c ) or sum up ( in statistical sense , for two different spin - systems , fig . 15 , d ) .    one more manifestation of correlation characteristics of spin noise in the optical spectrum , as noted in @xcite , is that the optical spectroscopy of spin noise may show , in some cases , spectral resolution higher than the conventional optical or magneto - optical spectroscopy and , thus , may be helpful in resolving hidden structure of optical spectra .",
    "this effect is revealed in a highly spectacular form in optical spectra with inhomogeneous broadening @xcite . the absorption and fr spectra in the vicinity of an isolated absorption band ( fig .",
    "16 , a , b ) are known to be the same regardless of whether the band is broadened homogeneously or inhomogeneously .",
    "linear magneto - optics ( as well as linear optics in general ) can not distinguish between these two cases .",
    "the results of calculations presented in @xcite show that the optical spectra of spin noise in these two cases are drastically different .",
    "16 , c , d )    for the homogeneously broadened band , the fr noise , which is proportional to the verdet constant squared , vanishes at the center of the band ( where the faraday rotation proper turns into zero ) , whereas for the band with a strong inhomogeneous broadening , this central dip disappears , and the fr noise proves to be the    ) .,width=340 ]    greatest at the band center .",
    "qualitatively , it can be easily understood .",
    "the faraday rotation at the center of the inhomogeneously broadened band vanishes because positive and negative contributions of the higher- and lower - lying spectral components compensate for each other , whereas their fluctuations , being uncorrelated , are summed up statistically and attain the greatest value at the point where the density of spectral components is the greatest , i.e. , at the center of the band .",
    "when the inhomogeneous broadening is comparable with homogeneous , the dip in the optical spectrum of the fr noise power acquires some intermediate depth , which can be used to estimate the ratio of these two contributions to the line broadening .",
    "it was also established in @xcite that magnitude of the spin noise considerably increasers with increasing ratio of the inhomogeneous bandwidth to homogeneous ( approximately in direct proportion with it ) .",
    "it results from the fact that , in the case of strongly inhomogeneously broadened band , the main contribution to the fr noise of the probe beam is made by the spectral components lying nearby the laser wavelength ( within the range of homogeneous width ) .",
    "this relatively small number of narrow spectral components with relatively large partial contribution of each of them may provide strong enhancement of the spin noise power for inhomogeneously broadened bands .",
    "this fact , on the one hand , makes easier sns experiments with inhomogeneously broadened systems ( like quantum dots ) and , on the other , can be used for measuring homogeneous linewidth of optical transitions .",
    "the above properties of the optical spin - noise ( osn ) spectroscopy have been confirmed experimentally in @xcite .",
    "the osn spectra of the homogeneously broadened d1 line of potassium atoms and inhomogeneously broadened band of the ingaas / gaas quantum dots were strongly different in accordance with the above results .",
    "the effect of enhancement of the spin noise power in inhomogeneously broadened systems was also confirmed experimentally .",
    "thus , the optical spectroscopy of the fr noise may be considered as the other side of the fr - based sns that may provide interesting additional information about spin - system under study .",
    "the sns , as a method of the esr spectroscopy , was primarily intended for providing standard information about g - factors and relaxation rates of the spin - system . as an optical technique",
    ", the fr - based sns has much in common with the conventional optical methods of the esr detection @xcite , with an essential difference that the detected spin precession , in the sns , is spontaneous ( stochastic ) rather than coherently excited by an external field , and the spin - system is supposed to remain in the state of thermal equilibrium .",
    "what is highly significant , in our opinion , is that the use of magnetization _ noise _ in the capacity of signal , in combination with the optical ( laser - assisted ) technique , allows one to get additional information fundamentally inaccessible for conventional methods of spectroscopy and makes the sns unique in many respects .",
    "one of the most important features of the fr - based sns , as was already mentioned , is related to its nonperturbative character : the light interacting with the paramagnet in the region of its transparency produces virtually no real excitation of the system .",
    "this property may be highly important , e.g. , in studies of ultracold atoms @xcite or semiconductor systems , when appearance even of small amount of photo - induced charge carriers may substantially distort dynamics of the spin - system .",
    "another property of the sns that essentially distinguishes it from other ( fundamentally perturbative ) methods of the magnetic - resonance spectroscopy is that it does not require population difference between magnetic sublevels of the spin - system to detect the resonance .",
    "this technique remains equally efficient at high temperatures and low magnetic fields ( including zero field ) , when the population difference becomes negligibly small ( see , e. g. , @xcite .    by detecting spin noise as described above , we , in fact , monitor random microscopic motion of a macroscopic object confined spatially by the probe laser beam .",
    "this allows us to get information hardly accessible for the conventional radio- or linear optical spectroscopy .",
    "in particular , sns was used to identify fermi - dirac statistics of a degenerate electron gas in heavily doped n - gaas , to distinguish between localized and delocalized conduction - band electrons , and to detect the effect of brownian motion of the electrons in the conduction band on the spin noise line width .",
    "essential information can be also extracted from absolute value of the spin noise power which is known to be directly related to total number of spins probed by the beam @xcite .",
    "a widely - known method of nonlinear optics is the so - called `` @xmath105-scan technique '' , which allows one to identify optical nonlinearity and to measure , in a simple way , coefficients of nonlinear absorption or refraction of the medium @xcite . in all modifications of this    -scan arrangement ( a ) and characteristic dependence of the transmitted light intensity on position of the sample @xmath105 for the sample with optical nonlinearity.,width=340 ]",
    "technique , the sample is drawn through the waist of a tightly focused laser beam ( along the @xmath105-axis , fig .",
    "17 ) , and intensity of the transmitted light is measured as a function of @xmath105-coordinate .",
    "when the sample is optically linear and its optical properties do not depend on the light power density , the transmitted light intensity does not show any dependence on @xmath105 .",
    "the presence of such a dependence with a peculiarity at @xmath106 usually serves as an indicator of nonlinearity of the medium .",
    "if we apply this @xmath105-scan technique to the measurements of spin noise , we will evidently obtain a @xmath105-dependent noise signal ( as if the medium were nonlinear ) , because , when moving the sample through the waist of the beam , the number of probed spins , controlling magnitude of the spin noise power , changes . in other words , the tightly focused laser beam traveling through a bulk paramagnet probes the spin - system mainly by a small spatial region in the vicinity of its waist .",
    "this situation has evidently much in common with the case of nonlinear medium when the main response is provided by the region of the beam with the greatest light power density .",
    "another curious illustration of this effect may be provided by a simple two - beam experiment , which can be considered as a sort of pump - probe spectroscopy of the light intensity noise ( fig.18 ) .",
    "let a light beam pass through a layer of transparent medium and let us ask the question ; can we find the spot illuminated by this beam on the layer with the aid of another light beam ?",
    "the usual reply is : yes , we can do this provided that the first beam ( usually called ",
    "pump ) changes in some way optical properties of the layer in the illuminated spot . in other words , this is possible ( and is a usual story ) in _ nonlinear _ optics . in the light intensity noise ,",
    "however , this is also possible , in spite of the fact that the  probe beam is not supposed to modify , in any way , properties of the layer .        indeed , if we detect total intensity noise of the two beams (  pump and  probe ) transmitted by the layer ( fig .",
    "18 ) , then the measured signal will depend on whether they pass through the same spot of the layer or not . in the first case , their fluctuations will be correlated , and total noise power will be given by their sum squared , while , in the second case , they will be uncorrelated , and the measured noise power will be given by the sum of their squares . as a result ,",
    "the spot illuminated by the  pump can be easily detected by the ",
    "probe. we can say , that the illuminate spot is coded in a unique way , and the hey to its code is provided by the noise of the  pump ` ' .    it is appropriate to mention here the idea of two - beam spin noise spectroscopy , which was put foeward in @xcite and may be promising for studying spatial characteristics of spin systems .",
    "these features of the sns have been used in @xcite to realize a three - dimensional sns - based tomography .",
    "efficiency of this technique was demonstrated with a pair of @xmath79-doped gaas wafers , around 350 @xmath8 m thick each , probed , as in the conventional z - scan technique , by a focused laser beam .",
    "the wavelength of the probe beam was chosen well below the bandgap of gaas ( 849 nm ) .",
    "the measurements were performed with no external magnetic field , so that the spin noise spectrum was centered at zero frequency . due to different doping concentrations of the two plates , the corresponding spin relaxation times ( and spin - noise spectra ) were different , which made it possible to distinguish them in the sns experiment . in this proof - of - principle experiment ,",
    "the spatial in - depth resolution of 50 @xmath8 m was demonstrated .",
    "the method may allow , in authors opinion , to realize 3d doping measurements with submicrometer spatial resolution even at low doping concentrations .",
    "this is one of the features of sns that , along with its ability to penetrate inside hidden structure of optical transitions , mentioned above , bring is close to the methods of nonlinear optics .",
    "we have briefly outlined development of the sns for the last several years and described its main achievements and potentialities as applied to scientific research . it is curious that the idea of detecting magnetic resonance in the faraday - rotation noise spectrum , that looked initially more like an academic trick useful primarily for tutorial purposes , gave birth to a highly efficient and , in many respects , unique experimental tool .",
    "this technique keeps certain properties of conventional experimental methods like magnetic resonance spectroscopy , optical and raman spectroscopy , spectroscopy of double rf - optical resonance , and gorter s paramagnetic relaxation method , but essentially differs from any of them and acquires thereby qualitatively new features , some of which were considered in this paper .",
    "nowadays , as we believe , the fr - based spin noise spectroscopy , as a new experimental tool , is only at the beginning of its life in experimental research , and its potentialities are far from being exhausted . especially promising looks its application to studies of micro - samples and nanostructures , bearing in mind that smallness of the optically probed volume of the sample ( smallness of the number of spins ) may be considered , under certain conditions , as a favorable factor from the viewpoint of relative magnitude of the signal .",
    "an important degree of freedom of the sns , which may considerably widen its informative capacity , is provided by the wavelength of the probe light .",
    "nontrivial shape of optical spectra of the spin noise power may contain information about hidden structure of optical transitions and thus may reveal apparent features of nonlinear optics .",
    "interesting possibilities may be provided by different modifications of the intentionally perturbative ( resonant ) methods of the sns .",
    "these methods , generally , do not have much to do with polarization measurements and do not need high polarimetric sensitivity . their main advantage is similar to advantage of the fft spectrum analyzer compared to the sweeping one : the broadband ( rather than monochromatic ) intensity modulation of the acting light substantially improves sensitivity of the technique .",
    "these methods of the `` active '' noise spectroscopy , however , pertaining more to nonlinear optics , may provide the information related , to a greater extent , to the optical ( rather than spin ) dynamics of the system .    at present , we have every reason to believe that the novel technique of sns will soon find a wide use in studies of spin - systems and will turn into a standard method of experimental research .",
    "this is a unique case when a pure noise , usually considered as a nuisance factor , turns into a basic source of information in a field of science .",
