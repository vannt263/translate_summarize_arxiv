    "the calculation of structure functions for deep - inelastic lepton - hadron scattering , which is equivalent to finding the quark and gluon distributions in hadrons , is one of the most important problems of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "perturbative treatments of deep - inelastic scattering give important information about structure functions as a function on @xmath4 @xcite ( @xmath4 is the momentum squared of the virtual photon ) and , under some assumptions , can produce reggion behavior at small @xmath5 @xcite . at the present time there is significant activity in the application of the perturbative expansion for structure functions @xcite .",
    "these perturbative investigations are very important . however , since quark and gluon distributions can not be determined from perturbative calculations , these distributions have been taken from experiment .",
    "theoretical calculations in qcd have achieved some progress in determining the second moments of the quark distribution functions for the nucleon @xcite and pion @xcite from qcd sum rules .",
    "the first moment of the chiral - odd structure function @xmath6 was evaluated in @xcite .",
    "recently , higher moments of quark distribution functions have also been considered in the qcd sum rule approach @xcite .    in ref.@xcite , ioffe proposed a four - point correlator for theoretical calculations of quark distribution functions in the qcd sum rule approach suggested by shifman , vainshtein and zakharov @xcite .",
    "this method was applied for calculations of nucleon structure functions , such as @xmath7 @xcite , @xmath8 and @xmath9 @xcite , @xmath10 @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we use a light - cone qcd sum rule @xcite .",
    "recently , it was suggested to apply this version of qcd sum rules to the problem of calculating the deep - inelastic structure function @xcite .",
    "this light - cone qcd sum rule is based on the fact ( which was noted by ioffe in @xcite ) that if @xmath11 is not close to the boundary @xmath12 and @xmath13 , then the imaginary part of the deep - inelastic scattering amplitude is determined by small distances in the @xmath14-channel . in the case of the pion structure function ,",
    "the nearest singularity in the @xmath14-channel for the correlator of two vector currents and one axial current with a pion in the initial state is at @xmath15 for highly virtual photons , where @xmath16 is a momentum of the axial current .",
    "this means that in the case of intermediate @xmath11 we can apply operator product expansion ( ope ) for the calculation of the correlator in the euclidean region .",
    "then , we can use a dispersion relation to construct qcd sum rules .",
    "these light - cone qcd sum rules are formulated in terms of so - called light - cone wave functions of hadrons introduced in perturbative qcd to describe hadron form factors at large @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "this new version of qcd sum rules can be a useful tool for investigations of quark and gluon distributions and light - cone wave functions in hadron physics .",
    "furthermore , in principle , it is possible to incorporate perturbative corrections to improve the calculations .    in the present paper",
    "we do not take into consideration perturbative corrections .",
    "so , our results can be considered as an initial condition for the evolution equation @xcite .",
    "for this reason , at the end of this paper we compare our results with the quark distribution function for low @xmath4 @xcite obtained from the the analysis of the drell - yan process .",

    "in this section we consider the contribution of the leading twist-2 pion light - cone wave function in the qcd sum rule ( [ 11 ] ) .",
    "it is clear that in the formal limit when @xmath40 , we can use a free @xmath34-quark propagator .",
    "all interactions with soft nonperturbative gluon fields are suppressed by a factor @xmath41 or @xmath42 .",
    "perturbative contributions should be taken into account . however , as pointed out in the introduction , we do not take these corrections into consideration , assuming that our results can be compared directly to the quark distribution function at low @xmath4 , where these contributions are small .",
