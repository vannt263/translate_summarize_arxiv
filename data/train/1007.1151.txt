    "the dama @xcite and cogent @xcite dark matter detection experiments have reported events in excess of the expected background , which would be compatible with a wimp mass of a few gev . also the cdms - ii experiment @xcite has reported two events , which could be explained by a wimp mass of @xmath6  gev ( or background ) . on the other hand , exclusion limits from the xenon10 @xcite , xenon100 @xcite and cdms - si @xcite experiments set upper bounds on the spin independent detection cross sections for this mass range of a wimp , which seem incompatible with the reported hints for a signal .    in any case",
    ", it is important to know whether specific models for dark matter with a wimp mass of a few gev can produce direct detection cross sections compatible with the reported excesses , and/or whether regions in the parameter space of such models can be tested by present and future exclusion limits .",
    "supersymmetric ( susy ) extensions of the standard model are popular , amongst others , since they predict naturally ( for unbroken r - parity , and for a neutral lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) ) a candidate for dark matter , with a relic density compatible with wmap constraints @xcite . within the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm )",
    "four neutral fermions ( neutralinos @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) exist , which are composed of the bino ( superpartner of the @xmath9 gauge boson ) , the wino ( superpartner of the @xmath10 gauge boson ) and two higgsinos ( superpartners of neutral higgs bosons ) .",
    "these states mix , and the lightest neutralino @xmath11 , which is the lightest eigenvalue of the @xmath12 mass matrix , will be the lsp ( leaving aside the possibility of a sneutrino lsp ) .    often the lsp is dominantly bino - like , whose mass @xmath13 is approximately given by the soft susy breaking gaugino mass @xmath14 . assuming unification of the three gaugino masses for the bino ( @xmath15 ) , the winos ( @xmath16 ) and the gluino ( @xmath17 ) at the scale of grand unification , @xmath15 is naturally the smallest among these mass terms at the electroweak scale .",
    "however , due to the lower bound of @xmath18  gev on @xmath16 from the lower bound on chargino masses , the assumption of unification of the three gaugino masses implies @xmath19  gev and a similar lower bound on the mass of the lsp .",
    "the assumption of unification of the three gaugino masses can be dropped , however , in that case @xmath15 and hence the lsp mass @xmath13 can be arbitrarily small .",
    "then , on the other hand it can become difficult to satisfy the wmap constraint on the dark matter relic density i.e. , to reduce the dark matter relic density after the big bang to an acceptable value compatible with this constraint . to this end , dark matter annihilation processes have to be sufficiently effective . for a lsp mass @xmath20  gev",
    "the following pair annihilation processes can be relevant : exchange of susy partners of fermions ( sfermions , in particular sleptons ) in the t - channel , and z - exchange or higgs - exchange in the s - channel ( if the lsp has a sufficiently large higgsino component ) .",
    "in addition , neutralinos can co - annihilate with other sparticles if they have similar masses , but co - annihilation processes will not be relevant for a light lsp as considered here . in the mssm ,",
    "sufficiently effective dark matter annihilation processes impose constraints on a light lsp :    considering lsp annihilation via slepton exchange in the t - channel , a lower bound @xmath21  gev was derived in @xcite from the lower bound of @xmath22  gev on the slepton masses .",
    "( relaxing this bound to @xmath23  gev for stau masses , one obtains @xmath24  gev @xcite , unless the lsp mass is very small corresponding to hot dark matter @xcite . ) allowing for lsp annihilation via cp - odd higgs ( @xmath25 ) exchange in the s - channel , a lower limit @xmath26  gev was given in @xcite from @xmath27  gev for large values of @xmath28 .",
    "however , as noted in @xcite , this region of the parameter space of the mssm is now strongly constrained by the bounds on @xmath29 .",
    "a lsp with a mass in the @xmath30  gev range in the mssm has been considered in @xcite without , however , asking for a correct relic density .    in the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ,",
    "see @xcite for recent reviews ) , which can solve the @xmath31-problem of the mssm , the higgs and neutralino sectors are extended by gauge singlet states .",
    "as noticed in @xcite , the mass of the lsp can be considerably smaller in the nmssm than in the mssm and can still be compatible with the wmap constraint on the relic density .",
    "this is a consequence of a light cp - odd higgs boson in the spectrum ( on top of the cp - odd higgs boson of the mssm ) , which can be mostly singlet - like and which is not ruled out by lep - constraints .",
    "then , sufficiently large lsp annihilation cross sections via the exchange of this additional cp - odd higgs boson in the s - channel may be possible even for a light lsp with mass of a few gev .",
    "a light lsp in the nmssm could be a ( dominantly ) singlet - like state ; in this case , however , its direct detection cross sections would be tiny .",
    "on the other hand , as in the mssm , a light lsp in the nmssm can originate from a small value of @xmath15 in which case it will be dominantly bino - like and can have larger direct detection cross sections .",
    "these have been estimated in @xcite , where also constraints on the corresponding parameter space from b - physics , lep and @xmath32-physics were discussed .",
    "however , the corresponding points in the parameter space given as examples in @xcite suffer from a negative effective @xmath31-parameter ( which is in conflict with the measured anomalous magnetic moment of the muon ) , and not all experimental constraints considered below are taken into account .    in view of the interest in a light lsp with a mass in the @xmath0  gev range",
    ", we find it appropriate to study upper bounds on its direct detection cross sections in the nmssm .",
    "direct detection cross sections in the nmssm including wmap constraints have been studied before in @xcite , but not for the lsp mass range considered here .",
    "apart from wmap constraints , we take care of a lengthy list of experimental constraints from b - physics ( important for large @xmath33 and/or relatively light charged and cp - odd higgs bosons as relevant here ) , @xmath32-physics and lep - constraints on neutralino production . among the latter",
    ", opal limits on @xmath34 ( @xmath2 ) turn out to be very important . since these are also relevant for the mssm , but",
    "have hardly been discussed before ( a notable exception is @xcite ) , we study their consequences in some detail . for the numerical analysis we use the code nmssmtools @xcite",
    "coupled to micromegas @xcite . as a result",
    "we obtain upper bounds on the spin - independent and spin - dependent lsp - nucleon cross sections of @xmath35  @xmath4 and @xmath36  @xmath4 , varying somewhat with the lsp mass in the @xmath0  gev range .",
    "the maximal value for @xmath37 is indeed near the estimate given in @xcite .    in the next section ( 2 ) we present the relevant parameters of the nmssm and their impact on the lsp cross sections . in section ( 3 )",
    ", we discuss the relevant experimental constraints .",
    "the consequences of the opal constraints on @xmath38 ( @xmath2 ) on the parameter space ( implying a lower bound on @xmath39 ) are estimated in an analytic approximation , which reproduces well the full numerical results .",
    "section ( 4 ) is devoted to our results and conclusions .",
    "in the nmssm the @xmath31 parameter of the mssm is replaced by a yukawa coupling @xmath40 to a gauge singlet ( super- ) field @xmath41 .",
    "then , the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) @xmath42 of the real scalar component of @xmath41 generates an effective @xmath31-term [ eq:1 ] _ eff = s .",
    "most of the time one studies the nmssm with a scale invariant superpotential @xmath43 which contains , apart from the yukawa coupling of @xmath41 to the mssm - like higgs doublet fields @xmath44 and @xmath45 , a trilinear term @xmath46 .",
    "hence the higgs mass term @xmath47 in @xmath48 is replaced by [ eq:2 ] w_nmssm = s h_u h_d + s^3 +  .",

    "for any ( possibly large ) value of @xmath67 , @xmath59 can have another small eigenvalue corresponding to an additional light cp - odd higgs boson @xmath53 which is mostly singlet - like .",
    "this state will be relevant for the lsp annihilation cross section below .",
    "the mass of the charged higgs scalar is given by [ eq:4 ] m_h^^2 = m_a^2 + v^2 ( - ^2 ) ; note that it decreases with increasing @xmath40 .",
    "as is well known , too small values of @xmath69 can cause disagreements between measurements and corresponding contributions to b - physics - observables as @xmath70 ; this will be of importance below .",

    ", the corresponding cp - even state is denoted by @xmath72 , and we will maintain this denomination .",
    "the spin - independent lsp - nucleon cross section will be dominated by the exchange of this cp - even scalar @xmath72 , since its couplings to down - type quarks ( particularly the strange quark ) are enhanced for large values of @xmath33 .",
    "also , the mass of the charged higgs scalar is close to @xmath71 for large @xmath71 ; then the states @xmath72 , @xmath66 and @xmath55 form a nearly degenerate su(2 ) doublet .",
    "in fact this approximate degeneracy holds down to fairly low values of @xmath73  gev .    in the neutralino sector , the bino @xmath74 and the neutral wino @xmath75 mix with the neutral higgsinos @xmath76 and the singlino @xmath77 , and generate a symmetric @xmath78 mass matrix @xmath79 .",
