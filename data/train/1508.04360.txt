    "it has long been recognized that the study of admissible rules is inextricably related to the theory of equational unification ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , from an algebraic perspective , admissibility of clauses in an equational class of algebras may be understood as a generalization of unifiability of finite sets of identities in the class , and conversely , checking admissibility may be reduced to comparing certain sets of unifiers .",
    "this paper provides a new classification of equational unification problems that simplifies these reductions for certain classes , including distributive lattices , idempotent semigroups , and mv - algebras .",
    "let us fix an equational class of algebras @xmath0 for a finite algebraic language @xmath1 .",
    "we denote the _ formula algebra _ of @xmath1 over a set of variables @xmath2 by @xmath3 and write @xmath4 to denote the set of variables occurring in a set of @xmath1-identities @xmath5 .",
    "a substitution ( homomorphism ) @xmath6 is called a",
    "_ @xmath0-unifier ( over @xmath2 ) _ of a set of @xmath1-identities @xmath5 with @xmath7 if for all @xmath8 in @xmath5 , @xmath9 in this case , @xmath5 is also said to be _",
    "@xmath0-unifiable_.    a _ clause _ @xmath10 , defined as an ordered pair @xmath11 of finite sets of @xmath1-identities , is called _ @xmath0-admissible _ if for each substitution @xmath12 , @xmath13 in particular , @xmath5 is @xmath0-unifiable if and only if ( henceforth iff ) @xmath14 is not @xmath0-admissible .",
    "suppose now that the unification type of @xmath0 is at most finitary : that is , every @xmath0-unifier of a set of @xmath1-identities @xmath5 over a finite set @xmath15 is equivalent in @xmath0 to one of a finite set @xmath16 of @xmath0-unifiers of @xmath5 over @xmath2 composed with a further substitution",
    ". then any clause @xmath10 satisfying @xmath17 is @xmath0-admissible iff each member of @xmath16 is a @xmath0-unifier of a member of @xmath18 .",
    "if there is an algorithm for determining such a finite basis set @xmath16 for @xmath5 and the equational theory of @xmath0 is decidable , then checking @xmath0-admissibility is also decidable .",
    "this observation , together with the pioneering work of ghilardi on equational unification for classes of heyting and modal algebras  @xcite , has led to a wealth of decidability , complexity , and axiomatization results for admissibility in these classes and corresponding intermediate and modal logics  @xcite .",
    "the success of this approach to admissibility appears to rely on considering varieties with at most finitary unification type . that this is not a necessary condition , however , is illustrated by the case of mv - algebras , the algebraic semantics of ukasiewicz infinite - valued logic ( see  @xcite for details ) .",
    "decidability , complexity , and axiomatization results for admissibility in mv - algebras have been established by jebek  @xcite via a similar reduction of finite sets of identities to finite approximating sets of identities . on the other hand ,",
    "it has been shown by marra and spada that the class of mv - algebras has nullary unification type  @xcite .",
    "this means that there are finite sets of identities for which no finite basis of unifiers exists .",
    "further examples of this discrepancy may be found in  @xcite , including the simple example of the class of distributive lattices where admissibility and validity of clauses coincide but unification is nullary .    as mentioned above , it is possible to check the @xmath0-admissibility of a clause @xmath10 by checking that every @xmath0-unifier of @xmath5 in a certain basis set @xmath0-unifies some member of @xmath18 .",
    "such a basis set @xmath16 typically has the property that every other @xmath0-unifier of @xmath5 is obtained , modulo equivalence in @xmath0 , by applying a further substitution to a member of @xmath16 .",
    "the starting point for this paper is the observation that a weaker condition on @xmath16 suffices , leading potentially to smaller basis sets of @xmath0-unifiers . for checking @xmath0-admissibility",
    ", it is enough that any @xmath0-unifier of @xmath5 over a finite set @xmath15 is a @xmath0-unifier of all identities with variables in @xmath2 that are @xmath0-unified by some particular member of @xmath16 .",
    "then @xmath10 with @xmath17 is @xmath0-admissible iff each member of @xmath16 is a @xmath0-unifier of a member of @xmath18 .",
    "this observation leads to a new preordering of @xmath0-unifiers and hierarchy of `` exact '' unification types .",
    "we also provide here an algebraic characterization of exact unification , where finite sets of identities are represented by finitely presented algebras . in ghilardi s algebraic account of ( standard ) unification , unifiers are homomorphisms from finitely presented algebras into projective algebras of the class , preordered by composition of homomorphisms  @xcite .",
    "coexact unifiers are defined here as homomorphisms from finitely presented algebras onto algebras that embed into the @xmath19-generated free algebra of the class ; the preordering remains the same .",
    "this contrasts with the syntactic account of exact unification where the unifiers are unchanged but a new preorder is introduced .",
    "nevertheless , the syntactic and algebraic exact unification types coincide as in the standard unification setting .",
    "although certain equational classes have the same exact type as unification type ( e.g. , any equational class of unitary unification type will have unitary exact type ) , we also obtain examples where the exact type is strictly smaller .",
    "in particular , the classes of distributive lattices and stone algebras have nullary unification type but unitary exact type , while the classes of idempotent semigroups , pseudo - complemented distributive lattices , kleene algebras , de morgan algebras , and mv - algebras all have nullary unification type but finitary exact type .",
    "we also provide an example ( due to r.  willard ) of an equational class that has infinitary unification type but finitary exact type .",
    "we proceed as follows . in section  [ s : equational_unification_and_admissibility ] , we recall some standard notions of equational unification and admissibility , and describe ghilardi s algebraic account of unification types . in section  [",
    "s : exact ] , we introduce the new exact unification preordering and exact types , providing also an algebraic interpretation and applications .",
    "several cases studies are considered in section  [ s : case_studies ] and some ideas for further research are presented in section  [ s : concluding_remarks ] .",
    "in this section , we describe briefly some key notions from the theory of equational unification ( referring to  @xcite for further details ) and their relevance to the study of admissible rules .",
    "in particular , we recall the unification type of a finite set of identities in an equational class and the algebraic account of unification provided by ghilardi in  @xcite .",
    "these notions and also those to appear in subsequent sections are most elegantly presented in the general setting of preordered sets .",
    "let @xmath20 be a preordered set ( i.e. , @xmath21 is a reflexive and transitive binary relation on @xmath22 ) .",
    "complete _ set for @xmath23 is a subset @xmath24 such that for every @xmath25 , there exists @xmath26 satisfying @xmath27 . a complete set @xmath28 for @xmath23 is called a _",
    "@xmath29-set _ for @xmath23 if @xmath30 and @xmath31 for all distinct @xmath32 .",
    "it is easily seen that if @xmath23 has a @xmath29-set , then every @xmath29-set of @xmath23 has the same cardinality .",
    "hence @xmath23 may be said to be _ nullary _ if it has no @xmath29-sets ( @xmath33 ) , _ infinitary _ if it has a @xmath29-set of infinite cardinality ( @xmath34 ) , _ finitary _ if it has a finite @xmath29-set of cardinality greater than @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) , and _ unitary _ if it has a @xmath29-set of cardinality  1 ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "these types are ordered as follows : @xmath38 .",
    "the following trivial but helpful observation confirms that the type of a preordered set depends only on its corresponding quotient poset .",
