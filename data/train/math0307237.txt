    "hence , with appropriate orientations on these knots and with @xmath508 denoting the homology classes represented by the normal circles to these knots ( again we suppress the index  @xmath498 ) , we have the relations @xmath509 that is , @xmath510 and @xmath511 , @xmath493 .",
    "observe that the surgery curve @xmath512 on its own gives a description of @xmath4 , with first homology group generated by @xmath513 .",
    "topologically , these additional surgery curves do not change anything , so that we still have a description of  @xmath6 : the @xmath38-framed unknot @xmath514 gives a trivial surgery ; a slam - dunk of @xmath512 changes the framing of @xmath515 to @xmath398 , which again gives a trivial surgery .",
    "the presence of @xmath514 ensures that the diagram describes an _ overtwisted _ contact structure @xmath464 on  @xmath6 , which will be our reference contact structure , inducing the spin@xmath126 structure @xmath516 .    by viewing the knots in this diagram as attaching circles of @xmath5-handles rather than surgery curves",
    ", we can read the diagram as a description of a @xmath13-manifold @xmath15 with boundary  @xmath6 .",
    "we have seen that , away from finitely many points , @xmath15 admits an almost complex structure @xmath16 such that @xmath517 .",
    "the corresponding spin@xmath126 structure @xmath518 on @xmath15 restricts to @xmath519 along @xmath343 .",
    "given @xmath146 there is , thanks to the free and transitive action of @xmath520 on @xmath131 , a class @xmath521 such that @xmath522 .",
    "since the restriction homomorphism @xmath523 is surjective ( under poincar duality this corresponds to the surjectivity of @xmath524 in section  [ second ] ) , we may assume that @xmath525 lives in @xmath526 .",
    "then @xmath527 is a spin@xmath126 structure on @xmath15 that on @xmath6 restricts to  @xmath150 .",
    "the advantage of working over @xmath15 is that due to @xmath528 the first chern class captures the spin@xmath126 structure , whereas on @xmath6 the identification of spin@xmath126 structures is complicated by the possible presence of @xmath5-torsion .    in conclusion , we need to find a contact surgery diagram that topologically yields @xmath6 and such that the induced spin@xmath126 structure @xmath202 on @xmath15 satisfies @xmath529 .",
    "observe that because of @xmath510 , we can  with @xmath530 denoting the normal disc bounded by @xmath513  write @xmath525 as @xmath531\\in h^2(x;{{\\mathbb { z}}}).\\ ] ] if @xmath532 , we retain the diagram of figure  [ change2 ] near  @xmath104 .",
    "if @xmath533 , we use instead the diagram depicted in figure  [ change3 ] , which is modelled on the one we used for @xmath4 .    observe that the presence of the ( contact ) @xmath40-framed unknot with thurston - bennequin invariant @xmath52 ( and the fact that the other link components may be assumed not to intersect the overtwisted disc we exhibited in figure  [ ot ] ) again ensures that the resulting contact structure is overtwisted",
    "moreover , the diagram is topologically equivalent to the one of figure  [ change2 ] , with @xmath534 taking the role of  @xmath512 .",
    "thus , a calculation completely analogous to the one above for the contact structure @xmath442 on @xmath4 shows that passing from the diagram in figure  [ change2 ] to the one in figure  [ change3 ] adds a summand @xmath535 = 2\\alpha_ipd^{-1}[n_{i,0}']$ ] to the first chern class of the corresponding spin@xmath126 structure .    for @xmath536 one argues similarly , using the diagrams for the @xmath467 instead .",
    "this concludes the construction of surgery diagrams for all overtwisted contact structures on the given  @xmath6 .",
    "notice that when we claim to have found surgery diagrams for _ all _ overtwisted contact structures on a given ( closed ) @xmath1-manifold @xmath6 , we do of course rely on eliashberg s result  @xcite that overtwisted contact structures which are homotopic as @xmath5-plane fields are in fact isotopic as contact structures .",
    "however , our argument clearly provides an independent proof of the lutz - martinet theorem :    on any given closed , orientable @xmath1-manifold , each homotopy class of @xmath5-plane fields contains an ( overtwisted ) contact structure .",
    "@xmath537    for an exposition of the original proof of that theorem , based on surgery along curves _ transverse _ to a given contact structure , see  @xcite .",
    "in this final section we briefly return to the issues raised in remarks [ rem : pm ] and [ rem : tb ] concerning the extension of the almost complex structure over the handle and the value of @xmath538 in the case of contact @xmath40-surgery .",
    "in fact , most of our discussion in the present section relates to the translation from weinstein s description of contact surgery via symplectic handlebodies with contact type boundary to eliashberg s description via stein manifolds ( or complex handlebodies with strictly pseudoconvex boundary ) , and thus it applies equally well to the case of contact @xmath38-surgery .",
    "specifically , we address the question how to deform a handle in weinstein s picture so that the contact structure on the boundary of the handle is given by almost complex tangencies ; we are not concerned with the more subtle point of the integrability of that almost complex structure ( extending a given complex structure on the initial handlebody ) .",
    "the second issue then is to give a geometric description for the obstruction to extending that almost complex structure over the full handle in the case of contact @xmath40-surgery  in the case of @xmath38-surgery there is no such obstruction , as already discussed .",
    "we hope that the following considerations will prove useful in other instances where it may be opportune to switch between eliashberg s and weinstein s description of contact surgery .",
    "[ lem : ac ] let @xmath539 be an oriented @xmath540-bundle ( over some manifold  @xmath15 ) with bundle metric @xmath541 and @xmath542 an oriented @xmath140-subbundle . then there is a unique complex bundle structure @xmath16 on @xmath543 such that        let @xmath545 be an ordered quadruple of local @xmath541-orthonormal sections of @xmath543 with @xmath546 sections of @xmath10 , inducing the given orientations .",
    "then @xmath16 with the described properties can be defined by @xmath547 and @xmath548 , and it is a straightforward check that this is the only way to define  @xmath16 .    given @xmath549 as described , let @xmath550 , @xmath551 , be a @xmath190-invariant bundle metric on  @xmath543 .",
    "the first part of the proof tells us that @xmath190 can be recovered from  @xmath550 .",
    "the complex bundle structure @xmath552 corresponding in this way to the bundle metric @xmath553 , @xmath554 $ ] , defines a homotopy between @xmath555 and  @xmath191 .",
    "recall from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  3 ) the description of contact @xmath40-surgery as a symplectic handlebody surgery on the concave end of a symplectic cobordism : consider @xmath540 with cartesian coordinates @xmath556 and standard symplectic form @xmath557 then @xmath558 is a liouville vector field for @xmath559 , that is , @xmath560 .",
    "this implies that @xmath561 is a contact form on any hypersurface transverse to  @xmath562 .",
    "let @xmath563 be the function defined by @xmath564 and set @xmath565 and @xmath566 , which is legendrian in @xmath567 .",
    "a neighbourhood of @xmath568 in @xmath81 can be identified with a neighbourhood of a given legendrian knot @xmath22 in @xmath51 ( which we take to be the boundary of @xmath187 with its standard complex structure  @xmath16 ) , and figure  [ figure:+1surgery ] shows how to attach a symplectic handle @xmath251 along @xmath569 .",
    "( more generally , one can assume that @xmath22 is a legendrian knot in a contact manifold @xmath12 given as the boundary of an almost complex manifold @xmath14 . ) in @xcite the framing of this surgery is computed to be indeed @xmath496 with respect to the contact framing of  @xmath22 .",

    "hence , in order for @xmath81 to carry the boundary orientation of @xmath571 , we need to equip @xmath540 with the orientation given by @xmath572 ( or @xmath573 ) .",
    "a complex bundle structure @xmath555 on @xmath574 is defined , in the sense of the preceding lemma , by the @xmath5-plane bundle @xmath575 ( oriented by @xmath576 ) and the standard metric @xmath577 on @xmath540",
    ". then on each level surface @xmath578 ( except at the singular point @xmath579 ) , the contact structure @xmath464 coincides with the @xmath555-complex tangencies of  @xmath578 .",
    "we should like to argue that @xmath555 does in fact define the extension @xmath16 of the almost complex structure on @xmath187 over @xmath581 .",
    "unfortunately , this is not quite true , since the boundary of @xmath251 is not a level surface of @xmath582 , so the contact structure @xmath583 on @xmath584 does not coincide with @xmath464 , i.e.  that contact structure is not given by the @xmath555-complex tangencies of @xmath584 . up to homotopy , however , this is essentially true .",
    "thus , before addressing this mild subtlety , we prove that @xmath580 from the @xmath585 as described .",
    "let @xmath586 be the seifert surface of @xmath22 in @xmath3 and @xmath587 the core disc of @xmath251 , @xmath588 perturbed slightly around @xmath35 so that it stays inside @xmath251 but misses the origin of @xmath540 .",
    "then @xmath61 , by definition , is the surface obtained by gluing @xmath586 and @xmath587 along @xmath569 , with orientation of @xmath22 equal to the boundary orientation of  @xmath586 .",
    "along @xmath3 the tangent bundle of @xmath187 splits ( as a complex bundle ) into the complex line bundle @xmath17 and a trivial complex line bundle defined by the complex lines containing the outward normal .",
    "that latter trivialisation extends to a trivialisation of a complex line bundle in @xmath589 complementary to @xmath590 , viz . , the @xmath555-complex lines containg @xmath562 .",
    "therefore the first chern class @xmath591 of @xmath16 , when restricted to @xmath61 , equals the first chern class of @xmath592 ( with @xmath593 on @xmath586 and @xmath594 on  @xmath587 ) .",
    "moreover , the vector field @xmath595 is a nowhere zero vector field in @xmath596  in particular , it defines a trivialisation of the complex line bundle @xmath590  and its restriction to @xmath568 is tangent to that circle . by our orientation assumption on @xmath597 and @xmath586 ,",
    "the value @xmath598\\rangle$ ] is equal to the rotation number of @xmath599 relative to a trivialisation of @xmath600 , which by definition is precisely @xmath295 .",

    "since @xmath17 coincides with @xmath609 on a neighbourhood of @xmath22 in  @xmath3 , there is a homotopy of  @xmath10 , fixed on @xmath3 and supported in a neighbourhood of @xmath22 in  @xmath187 , to a plane field ( still denoted  @xmath10 ) that coincides with @xmath609 in a ( smaller ) neighbourhood @xmath610 of @xmath22 in  @xmath187 .",

    "notice that since the flow @xmath620 of @xmath621 is simply a reparametrisation of the flow of  @xmath562 , hypersurfaces transverse to @xmath562 stay transverse to @xmath562 and continue to inherit a contact structure from the @xmath8-form @xmath625 .",
    "observe that @xmath626 , so the flow @xmath620 of @xmath621 preserves @xmath627 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath628 .",
    "this implies that @xmath629 and @xmath630 in particular , the map @xmath631 is an embedding preserving the contact structure @xmath464 on the respective hypersurfaces .",

    ", lemma  [ lem : ac ] defines a corresponding homotopy of  @xmath16 ( since one can always interpolate between different metrics ) .",
    "thus , after such a homotopy of @xmath16 and a homotopy of @xmath17 defined by @xmath638 , fixed outside @xmath639 , we may assume that @xmath640 sends @xmath641 contactomorphically into @xmath642 and that @xmath640 is a @xmath16-@xmath555-holomorphic map on a collar neighbourhood of @xmath643 in  @xmath187 .",
    "notice , however , that @xmath644 need no longer coincide on @xmath645 with the ( homotoped ) @xmath16-complex tangencies , and @xmath646 may not coincide with the @xmath555-complex tangencies of @xmath647 .",
    "now define @xmath648 to be the region bounded by @xmath649 and @xmath642 ; this really amounts to a deformation of @xmath650 keeping its boundary transverse to  @xmath562 , hence to a contact isotopy of the surgered contact manifold .",
    "this @xmath648 defines contact @xmath40-surgery in such a way that the extension of the almost complex structure over @xmath651 is defined by  @xmath555 .",
    "finally , we want to give a more geometric argument for the extendability of the almost complex structure @xmath555 on @xmath581 to @xmath652 ; this gives a new proof of the statement @xmath274 in proposition  [ prop:+1 ] , independently of the value of @xmath324 .    to that end , consider the map @xmath653 given by @xmath654 , where we set @xmath655 and @xmath656 .",
