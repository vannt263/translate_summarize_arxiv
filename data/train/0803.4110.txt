    "the idea of elementary fields with non ",
    "integer scaling dimension as proposed in @xcite and ` deconstructed ' in @xcite has received considerable attention .",
    "such fields can , perhaps , be best motivated in a nontrivial scale invariant theory with an infrared fixed point ( examples being afforded by a vector - like non - abelian gauge theory with a large number of massless fermions as studied by banks and zaks ( bz )  @xcite , or certain nonlinear sigma models  @xcite ) . manifesting itself in the existence of asymptotic states that are not particle - like ( in the sense of not having a well - defined mass , but rather a continuous mass spectrum ) , such a field has been termed an `` unparticle ''  @xcite . in an interacting theory , the aforementioned non - integer scaling dimension ( though it has been shown in @xcite that the unparticle can be looked upon as an infinite ladder of ordinary particles in the limit of a vanishing energy gap ) leads to curious effects in its propagation as well as its kinematics .",
    "such effects are illustrated if the unparticle is allowed to couple to standard model ( sm ) currents through an effective interaction and this has given rise to a whole body of work that have looked at various phenomenological implications of the existence of such particles .",
    "direct phenomenological issues aside , unparticles are unusual , to say the least  @xcite .",
    "as we shall demonstrate below , the unparticle field can be redefined to yield a canonical massless field ( thus preserving the signature scale invariance of this sector ) .",
    "the price to be paid is the transmutation of any ( local ) interactions with normal particles into non - local ones . in other words , unparticles provide us with a concrete realisation of the structure of non - local field theories .",
    "thus , even as a pure field theoretical problem , it is interesting to study the behavior of unparticles in their interactions with other matter and gauge particle .",
    "even though phenomenological consequences have been discussed at length , some of the more basic theoretical issues have not found too much space in the literature . in particular , changes in the dynamics of a theory ( e.g. the standard model ) due to the presence of unparticles has not quite been carefully delineated . since this can have significant effects on the running of the coupling constants , and hence to the overall behavior of the theory at different length scales , it is important to understand the nature of the @xmath0 function in a theory with unparticles",
    ".    there has been some discussion in the literature on the effect of scalar unparticles on a gauge theory @xcite .",
    "there has also been some discussion regarding fermionic unparticles  @xcite . however , the propagator proposed in the latter set of papers do not go over to the usual fermionic propagator when the dimension of the field is taken to @xmath3 .",
    "as a result , the conclusions of the papers are somewhat suspect .    in order to clarify all these issues we start from a lagrangian of fermionic unparticles , gauge it with the usual prescription of introducing a wilson line and proceed to calculate the @xmath0 function contribution coming from these unparticles . for this",
    "we use the result of @xcite which treats the general case of local and non local lagrangians .    in a recent paper , grinstein et al .",
    "@xcite have pointed out certain important issues regarding the compatibility of the propagators for unparticles used in the literature with conformal field theory ( cft ) .",
    "we use in this paper , a propagator invariant under scale transformations , lorentz transformations , and translations but not under special conformal transformations .",
    "we thereafter comment on the effect that special conformal transformations have on the result . in order to clarify these somewhat subtle matters which have been insufficiently dealt with in the literature",
    ", we explicitly show in appendix b the transformation of the fermionic 2-pt function under the conformal group .",
    "the form of the 2 point function for fermions is different depending on whether we demand invariance under the full conformal group or not .",
    "it turns out that the @xmath0 function obtained gets contribution from a spinor and a scalar part which would lead to a different evolution of the coupling from that in a fully conformally invariant theory where the @xmath0 function gets contribution only from the spinor part as for a normal fermion .",
    "this is essentially because in a fully conformally invariant theory we are forced to choose a fermion propagator to be the same as a ` normal ' fermion .",
    "in section ii we demonstrate the derivation of the fermionic unparticle propagator . in section iii",
    "we show that a redefinition of the fermion fields allows us to rewrite the lagrangian in terms of a local and non local part and thereby calculate the one loop fermionic corrections to the scalar propagator . thereafter in section",
    "iv we repeat this case for the corrections to the gauge field propagator due to un - fermionic loops . in this case",
    "we discuss the issue of gauge invariance and provide a prescription for gauging the theory . in section",
    "v , we calculate the full one loop two point function for the non abelian gauge field due to un - fermion and thence the correction to the @xmath0 function of the theory due to un - fermionic modes . the consequences to phenomenology are discussed in a subsequent section vi .    finally in the appendices we tie up various loose ends left in the paper . in particular we show that rescaling of the fields as done for fermions could equally well have been done for scalars and we use conformal field theory considerations to derive the form of the fermionic propagator .",
    "consider an unparticle fermion field @xmath4 of dimension @xmath5 .",
    "the two - point correlator d^4 x e^i p x 0| t[_(0 ) |_(x ) ] | 0 should then be describable as a coherent superposition of a continuum of single particle propagators with an appropriate density of states .",
    "in other words , & = & _ 0^ ( m^2 ) + ( m^2 ) & = & a_2 d / 3 ( m^2)^d - 5/2 + a_d & & [ derivation ] where the exponent @xmath6 is determined purely from dimensional arguments and @xmath7 , as before , is the phase space for the emission of @xmath5 massless particles .",
    "note that @xmath8 should have @xmath9 ( and not @xmath10 as in ref.@xcite ) since the emission of a ( composite ) fermion of mass - dimension @xmath5 is equivalent to emission of @xmath11 canonical fermions ( which have mass dimension @xmath3 ) .",
    "this has crucial implications as indicated below .",
    "on performing the integral explicitly , one obtains = a_2 d / 3 ( -p^2 - i ) ^d - 5/2  .",
    "[ propag_psi ] this , then , defines the propagator for a fermionic unparticle .",
    "clearly , in the limit @xmath12 , the propagator reduces to that for a canonical massless fermion , as it rightly should .",
    "this is in marked contrast to the propagator as obtained in ref.@xcite .",
    "furthermore , it should be easy to see that eq.([propag_psi ] ) satisfies the constraints imposed by scale invariance , namely , that the two point correlator of a field of dimension @xmath5 should go as @xmath13 where @xmath14 denote the space - time coordinates .",
    "it is , then , a straightforward exercise to construct an appropriate lagrangian density for a free fermionic unparticle , namely _ = |_(x ) ( _ ^)^3/2- d _ ( x )  . [ lagr_psi ]",
    "we believe that the above should be used for doing phenomenology with fermionic unparticles rather than that of ref .",
    "@xcite as has been done in the literature .",
    "certain important features should be noted at this stage :    * the un - fermion , as described above , must have a scaling dimension @xmath15 . * the propagator @xmath16 , while reducing to the canonical form for @xmath12 , is ill - defined for any @xmath17 . * on the other hand , @xmath16 is quite well - defined for @xmath18 , belying the naive expectation that multi - particle cuts should not be expressible in terms of a single propagator . * the lagrangian density of eq.([lagr_psi ] )",
    "has the curious form of being the sum of two lagrangians : a fermionic one and a scalar one , both unparticle - like .",
    "as a corollary , so does @xmath16 .",
    "as would be obvious from the discussions in the subsequent sections , the last point above is a very crucial one in the understanding of the fermionic unparticle described by eq.([lagr_psi ] ) and the penultimate point is but a consequence of this .",
    "it is instructive to reformulate the fermionic unparticle in terms of a different field . effecting a field redefinition , viz . _",

    "the presence of the extra term may seem baffling at first , but a closer inspection shows that the operator @xmath19 is equivalent to a non - local mass term  @xcite for @xmath20 .",
    "indeed , the propagator can be expressed as s(p ) & = & = i ^2 ( d ) + _ 0(p ) & & ( d ) ( -p^2)^1/2  .",
    "since @xmath21 and @xmath22 represent quite different entities , the two theories would result in very different predictions for asymptotic unfermion states . on the other hand ,",
    "if the unfermions are to appear only as virtual states , the two theories clearly would be equivalent , as long as all its interactions are non - derivative in nature .",

    "in other words , we would be faced with pair production characterized by a continuum in the mass of the particle , which , in the presence of magnetic fields , would translate to a continuum in track curvature .",
    "( it should be remembered that the unparticle can not decay . )",
    "the absence of such signals would indicate a very small coupling constant / charge , the nature of which continues to be an unresolved problem in unparticles .    gauging the lagrangian for the @xmath22-field changes the situation considerably .",
    "as sec.[sec : gauging ] shows , we now have a single massless field ( albeit with a non - local propagator ) and with non - local interactions with the electromagnetic field .",
    "the definition of asymptotic states is straightforward and does not need deconstruction . a non - zero charge for @xmath22 would result in copious production of @xmath22-pairs . with the effective ( non - local ) mass of the each @xmath22 essentially given by @xmath88 ,",
    "the electromagnetic radiation is an interesting issue in itself .",
    "however , the absence of any such nonstandard signal in an electromagnetic calorimeter would indicate the nonexistence of a light charged unparticle .",
    "one resolution of this problem would be to dispense with the masslessness of the @xmath22 field . with the unparticle coupling to the sm ,",
    "the lack of scale invariance in the latter would also manifest itself in the unparticle sector as a result of quantum corrections .",
    "in other words , once such effects are taken into account in constructing the effective theory for unparticles , the integral in eq.([derivation ] ) would be characterized by an infrared cutoff @xmath89 , the magnitude of which would be determined by the nature of the interaction with the sm .",
    "apart from a resultant complicated propagator , the @xmath22 field would still be characterized by a minimal mass @xmath90 as well as a non - local term in its propagator .",
    "phenomenologically , still , the aforementioned problems would persist unless @xmath89 is sufficiently large .",
    "what if the unparticle is an @xmath91 singlet , but is coloured ? in an @xmath87 collider , @xmath22 production would now occur only as a higher order process , say as @xmath92 .",
    "the latter being a loop process , the ensuing contribution to the 3-jet rate is relatively small and well below the detection level .",
    "the 4-jet cross section , on the other hand , could be significant and worth comparing with the lep observations of the slight excess that was seen at aleph . at a hadronic collider ,",
    "though , the @xmath93 rate is quite large .",
    "note , though , that the @xmath22 s would give rise to un - hadrons / un - jet which could contain various stable exotic bound states .",
    "non - observation of such states would once again require that @xmath89 is significantly large .",
    "a large @xmath89 essentially means that the sm @xmath0-functions would stay unaffected until @xmath94 and the unparticle contribution(s ) would manifest themselves only thereafter .    finally , a simple way of avoiding the above mentioned phenomenological constraints , is to make the unparticle gauge group different from the sm ones .",
    "any interaction with the sm particles would then proceed strictly through a messenger sector as originally proposed by georgi .",
    "the un - gauge is then a part of a shadow ( mirror ) world with its own dynamics and phenomenology ( including candidates for dark matter etc . ) and the exercise undertaken in this paper being applicable only towards an understanding of the same .",
    "in this paper , we start by expressing the two point correlator of a fermionic unparticle as a coherent superposition of a continuum of single particle propagators convoluted with the appropriate density of states .",
    "the corresponding propagator has the correct limiting properties ( quite unlike the correlator considered so far in the literature ) .",
    "this , then , allows us to write the correct free - field lagrangian for such states .",
    "unparticles have , so far , been described by a non - canonical kinetic energy term with an effective local lagrangian describing interactions with standard model fields .",
    "we show here , though , that a field redefinition allows us to rewrite the theory in terms of a canonically quantized field but with a nonlocal interaction lagrangian .",
    "this holds for all unparticles , whether bosnic or fermionic . that the two related theories would give identical results for cases where the unparticle appears only as virtual states is easy to appreciate",
    "we demonstrate this through explicit calculations as well .",
    "of course , for asymptotic unparticle states , the two theories do give different results , as they indeed should .",
    "we next consider a field theory consisting of fermionic unparticles coupled to a gauge ( gluon ) field .",
    "using standard methods of field theory , we have calculated the contribution to the @xmath0 function of the theory coming from this fermionic unparticle  gauge particle coupling . to carry out this procedure",
    ", it becomes necessary to decide whether to impose full conformal invariance on the theory , or only demand scale invariance .",
    "as we show in this paper , the consequences are quite different . demanding full conformal invariance produces for us a contribution which is exactly the same as that for an ordinary fermion , modulo an overall constant . on the other hand ,",
    "demanding only scale invariance , allows us a different form of the fermion propagator and consequently a contribution to the @xmath0 function which is a combination of a scalar and a fermionic part .    since the dynamics of the theory depends on the @xmath0 function , it is important to understand the issue of conformal invariance _ vis a vis _ a theory of unparticles .",
    "the differences arising from these issues would have consequences for phenomenology in any theory that contains couplings of unparticles to other particles .",
    "some of these issues have been touched upon in the paper .",

    "[ sec : appendix - scalar_unp ] in this appendix we show that the rescaling done for fermionic unparticles could equally well have been done for scalar unparticles . starting from the lagrangian dimensional field @xmath23 for @xmath95 the interaction term is not conformally invariant , though it can be made so by changing the power of the @xmath96 term .",
    "however , this is not our primary concern in this appendix .",
    "similarly , the kinetic energy term would , in principle , need an @xmath7 term . ] @xmath97 we redefine , by introducing the field @xmath98 @xmath99 the lagrangian , in terms of @xmath98 , becomes @xmath100 ^ 2.\\ ] ] clearly , this rescaling results in a non - local interaction term which can be dealt along the lines of ref",
    "[ sec : cft ] in this appendix , we discuss the connection between conformal invariance ( ci ) and the form of the fermion propagator .",
    "although most of the analysis in this section is well known , we place it here for the record and in the context of fermionic unparticles .",
    "the conformal algebra in 4 dimensions has 15 generators , @xmath101 ( 4 translations ) , @xmath102 ( 6 lorentz transformations ) , @xmath103 ( 1 scale transformation ) and @xmath104 ( 4 special conformal transformations ) with the following algebra : @xmath105=0 , i[m_{\\alpha\\beta},p^\\mu]=\\delta^\\mu_{[\\alpha}p_{\\beta ] } , i[m_{\\alpha\\beta},m^{\\mu\\nu}]= \\delta^{[\\mu}_{[\\alpha}m_{\\beta]}^{\\ \\",

    "the cases of the scalar and vector propagators can be similarly calculated .",

    "if we dispense with the requirement of full conformal invariance and demand only scale invariance ( along with invariance under lorentz transformation and translations ) we are allowed to keep both the terms .",
