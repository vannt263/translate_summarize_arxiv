    "a fundamental challenge to quantum information processing is protection against detrimental effects of the environment @xcite .",
    "a milestone in addressing this problem was the development of quantum error correction ( qec ) @xcite .",
    "in fact , it is believed that any practical quantum information processing device will unavoidably contain some sort of qec @xcite .",
    "the main idea behind active qec is to encode the information in a region of the system s hilbert space known as the logical subspace .",
    "this region is chosen to be less vulnerable to the action of the environment . however , during quantum evolution information can leak out of this subspace .",
    "this leakage can be diagnosed by measuring some observables in a process known as syndrome extraction .",
    "if an error is detected by the syndromes , then a recovery operation is performed .",
    "this sequence of actions , extracting the syndrome and a recovery operation , can be called active qec .",
    "it is clear that the qec protocol demands additional physical and computational resources , thus there is a cost - benefit analysis that must be done .",
    "it is believed that there is a particular noise strength below which the benefits of qec overcome its cost @xcite .",
    "although a large body of work has been devoted to including realistic noise models in the analysis of the qec efficacy @xcite , there is little discussion on the interplay between the environmental temperature and the dynamics of the system affect the value of threshold for _ active _ qec . an important exception to this",
    "is given by brell and co - workers @xcite in the context of topological quantum memories that are constantly monitored .",
    "in contrast , for passive qec it is well understood that a finite environmental temperature radically affects the threshold @xcite . in this paper , we contribute to this theme by considering an environment whose temperature changes due to the interaction with qubits when active qec is employed .",
    "we choose to evaluate the surface code performance against the well - known pure dephasing model when a single logical qubit is in an idle state against super - ohmic and ohmic bosonic baths . in order to isolate the effects of finite temperature",
    ", we consider a perfect syndrome extraction in a nonerror syndrome evolution and assume all quantum gates and state preparations as flawless .",
    "hence , our thresholds should be regarded as an upper bound to the real qec threshold .",
    "both analytical results and numerical calculations are presented and we focus on temperatures and time scales relevant to current experimental setups .",
    "our main result is that , in experimentally relevant regimes , an error threshold always exists , but its dependence on temperature is not universal . while for super - ohmic environments the critical coupling constant separating high fidelity and low fidelity behavior decreases with increasing temperature , for ohmic and sub - ohmic environments the dependence on temperature is weak . for the ohmic cases , the critical coupling depends primarily on microscopic parameters related to the environment .",
    "for the sub - ohmic case , it depends in addition on the duration of the qec cycle .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : qec ] we provide a brief description of the effect of quantum error correction in the fidelity of a logical qubit coupled to an environment and the evolution is not restricted to uncorrelated errors only . to account for correlations ,",
    "we consider environments composed of free boson . in sec .",
    "[ sec : finitet ] we develop a finite - temperature formulation for the fidelity of the surface code in the presence of a bosonic environment .",
    "the calculation of the fidelity after one qec cycle is mapped onto the calculation of certain expectation values of a statistical spin model .",
    "the analysis that follows in sec .",
    "[ sec : puredephasing ] is restricted to a realistic regime where time - correlations ( namely , thus developed inside the bosonic light cone ) predominate .",
    "three significant cases are studied , namely , super - ohmic , ohmic , and sub - ohmic environments .",
    "both analytical and numerical results are presented .",
    "concluding remarks and a summary are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "appendixes with detailed results of calculations and a description of methods employed are provided .",
    "in order to focus on the effects of correlated errors and the ability of qec to tame the environmental degrees of freedom , we make two simplifying assumptions . first , we assume that a quantum state can be perfectly prepared .",
    "hence , we consider that the environment and the quantum system are disentangled at the beginning of the evolution . while this assumption could in principle be relaxed , it would result in a much more cumbersome calculation , that would obscure the main effects that we want to discuss .",
    "second , we assume that the environment itself can be initially set to its lowest possible energy state",
    ". this choice can easily be relaxed , but would lead to lower threshold values . even though we allow for the initial state of the environment to be its ground state",
    ", we do not assume that it is returned to the ground state at the end of the qec cycle .",
    "physically , we are considering that the preparation of the initial state and the environment could take a very long time ( and we choose the best possible preparation ) .",
    "when the system starts to evolve , the qec dynamics introduce a finite time scale that limits one s ability to refrigerate the environment .    in order to clarify the notation and provide a self - contained discussion , we start by giving a brief description of qec . following the standard formulation of qec ,",
    "@xcite , the unitary evolution of a qubit and its environment in the interaction picture can be described as @xmath0 where @xmath1 are environment states ( in general non orthogonal and non normalized ) and @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 are pauli operators acting on the qubit . for a system comprised of @xmath6 qubits",
    ", we can straightforwardly define an expansion similar to eq .",
    "( [ eq : evolution2qec-1qubit - general ] ) , namely , @xmath7 where @xmath8 .    at the core of any qec code is the choice of a particular subset @xmath9 , known as the _ error set _ , which the code can correct .",
    "the complementary set @xmath10 are the uncorrectable errors .",
    "it is therefore natural to write the quantum evolution as @xmath11 the next step in a qec protocol is the syndrome extraction , where a set of observables corresponding to the projector @xmath12 are measured in order to diagnose the errors and then an appropriate recovery operation @xmath13 is chosen : @xmath14 qec is in essence a method to steer the quantum evolution of a qubit system through a series of syndrome extractions .",
    "even though qec in itself is not a perturbative method or description , its cost - benefit analysis is usually done by performing a perturbative expansion in the coupling between the environment and the system . to understand this point ,",
    "let us consider the fidelity of an initial state after a single qec step is performed and a syndrome @xmath15 is detected .",
    "the fidelity of the logical state in this case is given by @xmath16 where , for simplicity , we assumed that the environment states are orthogonal to each other .",
    "after the syndrome is extracted only a subset of terms in the dyson series of the operator @xmath17 is kept .",
    "this expansion in the coupling with the environment is used in many calculations of qec .",
    "for instance , in the surface code it is an essential ingredient in the understanding of minimal - weight matching decodings .",
    "hence , if @xmath18 a high fidelity can be achieved .",
    "thus the choice of @xmath19 and its complement is a choice of the perturbative expansion imposed by the error syndrome @xmath20 extracted for a particular evolution .",
    "clearly , the fidelity can differ from unity due to uncorrectable errors .",
    "choosing a recovery operation can be difficult in the surface code @xcite .",
    "there are strategies for choosing the most likely @xmath13 for a certain syndrome . however , there is no guarantee that the correct one is chosen .",
    "hence the nonerror syndrome turns out to be of special interest , @xmath21 it requires no recovery operation ; thus @xmath22 corresponds to an intrinsic property of the error model . in this sense",
    ", it is expected to provide an upper bound to the fidelity after a qec cycle with an arbitrary syndrome@xcite .",
    "we restrict our analysis to the nonerror syndrome case hereafter .      to discuss the concept of a threshold , we need to define a measure of the noise strength .",
    "one way to do that is through the fidelity of a _ single _ physical qubit , @xmath23 where @xmath24 is named the _ single qubit error probability_. thus , we can rewrite eq .",
    "( [ eq : single - qubit - error - p ] ) as @xmath25 with this quantity , it is possible to define the concept of _ uncorrelated errors_. for instance , for a two - qubit system , the evolution with a nonerror syndrome is said to be uncorrelated if it is possible to write the fidelity resulting from the qec cycle as @xmath26 conversely , when such decomposition of the noise evolution is not possible , the problem is said to contain _ correlated errors_.    most quantum error threshold discussions in the literature rely on the existence of a _ single qubit error probability , _",
    "@xmath24 , and , explicitly or implicitly , rely on uncorrelated error models .",
    "furthermore , we note that the decompositions of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : evolution2qec-1qubit - general ] ) and ( [ eq : evolution-2qec - nqubits - general ] ) are , in general , only valid for a single qec step .",
    "the iteration of the process to the next qec step demands that the environment and the qubits be again disentangled .",
    "thus , any memory effects between qec steps are formally excluded in many discussions of the error threshold .",
    "a paradigm model in the study of decoherence is the spin - boson model for pure dephasing @xcite .",
    "the model consists of free bosons coupled linearly to qubits and whose total @xmath27 contains the free - boson term @xmath28 and the qubit - boson interaction ( * ? ? ?",
    "4 ) @xmath29 where @xmath30 is an @xmath31 spin operator for the qubit located at site @xmath32 , with @xmath33 = \\delta_{{\\bf k},{\\bf      q}}$ ] , @xmath34 defines the dispersion relation , and @xmath35 here , @xmath36 is the number of spatial dimensions of the bath , @xmath37 is its linear dimension , @xmath38 is a characteristic microscopic frequency scale ( @xmath39 ) , and @xmath40 is the bosonic velocity . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hamiltonian-1 ] ) , @xmath41 is the qubit - bath coupling constant , which we separate from the form factor @xmath42 . for convenience ,",
    "the exponent @xmath43 is chosen such that @xmath44 is dimensionless and @xmath41 has units of energy or frequency .",
    "it is straightforward to write the resulting evolution operator in the interaction picture and in normal order , @xmath45 where    @xmath46    and @xmath47    even though this model does not contain a full set of errors , it is amenable to an exact and explicitly analytical description .",
    "hence it is well suited for exploring the effects of correlations , as well as nonperturbative effects in qec @xcite .",
    "there are several possible regimes of correlations that can be discussed using this model @xcite .",
    "they can be classified according to the asymptotic behavior found after tracing out the environment as follows .    1 .   super - ohmic : when some correlation functions of the system have an ultraviolet divergence in the cutoff frequency of the environment .",
    "of course , there are no real divergences on a physical system , with the ultraviolet divergence just signaling that a more accurate description of the small - scale local physics of the qubit is missing from the model .",
    "ohmic : there are log divergences in the ultraviolet and in the infrared correlation functions .",
    "this is a more universal behavior , since results depend only on the logarithmic of the ultraviolet and infrared scales of the system .",
    "sub - ohmic : all correlation functions of the system have a well - defined ultraviolet behavior , but some have infrared divergences .",
    "both infrared and ultraviolet divergences can be troublesome to qec , but are amenable by suitable engineering of physical qubits .",
    "an ultraviolet divergence signals that the qubit is strongly coupled to the environment at high frequencies .",
    "this divergence is controlled by form factors in the qubit design and therefore can be dealt with by appropriate qubit engineering .",
    "conversely , infrared divergences are connected to long - distance correlations . this problem can be addressed by better encoding designs .",
    "if we demand only local operations and local communications between physical qubits , an infrared divergence sets a limit on the number of qubits that one can have on the same physical setup .",
    "we assume that the qubits can be prepared in the logical state @xmath48 . in order to simplify the calculation and in accordance with eq .",
    "( [ eq : evolution2qec-1qubit - general ] ) , we consider the initial state of the bosonic environment to be the vacuum , @xmath49 . a mixed initial state for the environment",
    "could also be considered , but would make the notation and the calculation more complex , obscuring the analysis .",
    "thus , the qubits and the environment are initially in the product state @xmath50 . in appendix [ initial_state ]",
    "we discuss a possible initialization prescription .    after evolving for a time @xmath51 ,",
    "the density matrix of the combined system becomes @xmath52 the next step is the syndrome extraction .",
    "we assume that the result of this extraction is a nonerror .",
    "the occurrence of other types of syndromes would introduce another layer of choices on the decoding procedure , and therefore would potentially further reduce the threshold ( see discussion in ref .",
    "hence we postselect the result of the syndrome in order to write the quantum operation @xcite @xmath53 where @xmath54 is a density matrix in the hilbert space of the qubits and the kraus operator is the projector @xmath55 a measurement can be understood as the selection of a pointer basis due to the interaction of the measuring apparatus with another , fast acting , environment @xcite . hence , during the time that the syndrome is extracted , it is unphysical to regard the total system ( bosonic environment and the qubits ) as isolated .",
    "the extraction of the syndrome bound us to also discuss how the environment would behave during this part of the evolution .",
    "we can not control the bosonic environment degrees of freedom , but it is possible to place it into contact with an even larger reservoir .",
    "this interaction can lead to a dissipative dynamics for the environment that can help in reducing correlations and memory effects .",
    "the qubits dynamics can not affect the environment in any substantial form during the interaction time .",
    "hence , the quantum operation that describes this evolution is @xmath56 where @xmath57 is a reduced density matrix in the environment hilbert space , the kraus operators are @xmath58 @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of @xmath61 , and , finally , the partition function @xmath62 .",

    ", the operation @xmath74 enhances the probabilities of low - energy states in an statistical ensemble instead of equilibrating it at a certain temperature .",
    "therefore , it is possible to call it a refrigeration or cooling mechanism . in appendix",
    "[ sec : cooling ] we discuss a microscopic model that implements this quantum operation .    combining both quantum operations , @xmath75 , produces an action on the hilbert space of the qubits and the environment .",

    "the best possible scenario for qec is when , at the end of the cycle , the environment remains at zero temperature .",
    "this situation was considered in refs .",
    "it corresponds to forcefully setting the environment back to its ground state , hence suppressing some correlations and memory effects . even in this extreme optimistic case ,",
    "strong correlations among the qubits can still persist , leading to a nontrivial threshold .",
    "we can further simplify eq .",

    "it is implemented on a two - dimensional array of qubits , greatly simplifying the design of control and measurement circuits @xcite .",
    "in addition , all the required interactions between the qubits are spatially local .",
    "finally , it has been estimated that it has a large noise threshold in the absence of correlated errors @xcite .",
    "the surface code has the qubits located on the links of a two - dimensional square lattice , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lattice ] .",
    "the quantum code is defined by two sets of operators .",
    "the first set corresponds to local operators that define the syndromes that have to be extracted at each qec step .",
    "these are four - body observables , @xmath89 and @xmath90 where @xmath91 is a label for the positions of four qubits linked to a vertex of the lattice ( `` star '' ) and @xmath92 labels the positions of four qubits in a plaquette .",
    "to diagnose the evolution of a single logical qubit , all plaquette and star operators have to be measured in order for the syndrome to be extracted .     and",
    "plaquette @xmath93 operators are indicated , as well , as some realizations of the logical operators @xmath94 and @xmath95.,width=302 ]    the second set corresponds to two extended operators that act on the logical hilbert space , @xmath96 and @xmath97 where @xmath98 is any path running from top to bottom of the lattice ( dual path ) and @xmath99 is any path running from left to right of the lattice ( primal path ) , see fig .",

    "we note that the thermal regime is likely to be applicable to physical implementations other than the superconducting qubits as well .",
    "the only parameter that is difficult to estimate is the velocity of the bosonic environment .",
