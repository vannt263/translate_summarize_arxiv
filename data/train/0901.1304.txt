    "these are based on bloch equations describing the qubit and classical equations describing the circuit .",
    "they reproduce well the observed vibronic spectrum , both the matrix elements and the heating / cooling asymmetry . here",
    "we present a simplified analysis by comparing three of the fringes with the transition probability @xmath178 , neglecting the heating / cooling effect .",
    "[ fig : bessel ] displays the measured reflection magnitude along fringes with @xmath167 , -1 , and -2 as a function of the flux bias of the qubit .",
    "squared bessel functions @xmath171 , @xmath172 , and @xmath173 have been fitted to the data .",
    "for the @xmath120-scale argument we have taken @xmath179 although this approximation will be rather crude when @xmath180 .",
    "nevertheless , the comparison can be employed to look for the presence of basic interference phenomena .",
    "the agreement between the data and the fits is quite good , though the modulation of the pure electronic fringe is a bit weaker in the measurement than given by @xmath171 .",
    "the reason for smearing of the bessel modulation is the variation of the number of quanta in the resonator . assuming the resonator is in a coherent state , it is a superposition of the number states and this should be taken into account in the analysis of the interference fringes",
    "this diminishes the sharpest features of the interference , but does not remove it .",
    "consequently , we may conclude that the dip at @xmath181 in the fringe magnitude corresponding to the pure electronic transition , is due to destructive interference in phase space in formula eq .",
    "( [ e.wheelerf ] ) .    in summary ,",
    "we have discussed interband transitions in superconducting cooper - pair boxes and charge - phase qubits and argued , how interference effects in various forms can be found to underlie the observed phenomena .",
    "fruitful discussions with m.  feigelman , t.  heikkil , f.  hekking , and m.  paalanen are gratefully acknowledged ."
