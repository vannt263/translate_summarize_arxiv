    "the nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation in the @xmath0 space - time dimension is one of the completely integrable systems , i.e. , the soliton equations  @xcite .",

    "the initial value problem can be solved exactly via the inverse scattering method ( ism )  @xcite . in particular",
    ", the reflection - free condition reduces the inverse problem to a set of algebraic equations making it possible to obtain the @xmath1-soliton solution in an explicit way .",
    "one of major developments in the study of the nls equation is multicomponent extensions preserving the integrability .",
    "manakov  @xcite studied a system of the coupled nls ( cnls ) equations on the basis of the ism and obtained the soliton solutions .",
    "while the interaction of vector solitons for the multicomponent focusing nls equation is elastic in the vector sense it was shown that during the two - soliton collision exchanges among components of each soliton may occur for particular choices of the parameter values @xcite . in @xcite , the ism for a matrix generalization of the nls equation ( in general , in a rectangular matrix form )",
    "was developed for solving the initial value problem . by assuming the reflection - free condition and _ vanishing boundary conditions _",
    "( see below ) the @xmath1-soliton solution was obtained explicitly .",
    "it should be noted that , by appropriate identifications of the matrix - field elements , the matrix nls equation reduces to the cnls equations of the manakov - type @xcite and remarkably to the spinor - type that is discovered recently  @xcite in connection with bose ",
    "einstein condensates with the spin degrees of freedom .",
    "results given in @xcite for a general matrix - field , such as the @xmath1-soliton solution , conservation laws and hamiltonian structure , are directly applicable to the reduced systems .",
    "thus , a further analysis of the matrix nls equation is desired to deal with multicomponent nonlinear dynamics under different circumstances .    in this paper , we study a square matrix nls equation under the _ nonvanishing boundary conditions _ by means of the ism .",
    "the multicomponent system with such boundary conditions is regarded as an extension of a basic single - component nls equation with the self - defocusing nonlinearity studied by zakharov and shabat  @xcite and also that with the self - focusing nonlinearity investigated by kawata and inoue  @xcite . as compared to the case with the vanishing boundary conditions  @xcite ,",
    "the conservation laws and hamiltonian structure are the same , while the lax pair , the direct and inverse problems , and the @xmath1-soliton solution should be reformulated reflecting the boundary values of the matrix - field .",

    "the initial value problem was solved and the @xmath1-soliton solution was obtained under the constraint @xmath10 and the vanishing boundary condition : @xmath12 under these conditions each soliton forms the so - called bright soliton with @xmath13 components . setting the form @xmath14 with @xmath15 , one can achieve a rectangular matrix reduction that is compatible with the vanishing boundary condition .",
    "in particular , the @xmath16 case corresponds to the @xmath17-component manakov model  @xcite .",
    "other types of reduction can be obtained in a nontrivial way by putting some components equal without breaking consistency of equations  @xcite .",
