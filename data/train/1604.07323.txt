    "there is not a consensus on the definition of the centaur population . according to the minor planet center - mpc / iau ,",
    "centaurs are celestial bodies with perihelion beyond the orbit of jupiter and with semi - major axes smaller than the semi - major axis of neptune @xcite .",
    "similarly , the jpl / nasa defines the centaurs population as the objects with semi - major axes between @xmath19 au and @xmath20 au @xcite . @xcite classify centaurs as celestial bodies with orbits mostly in the region between jupiter and neptune and that typically cross the orbits of the giant planets .",
    "a similar definition is also found in @xcite .",
    "2060 chiron was the first observed body of this population @xcite .",
    "since then , the number of known centaurs has grown .",
    "currently , more than 400 objects are cataloged @xcite , and from the flux of short period comets @xcite estimated the total number of objects with diameter @xmath21  km to be approximately @xmath22 .",
    "the centaur 10199 chariklo was discovered in 1997 by the spacewatch program @xcite . in 2013 , a stellar occultation revealed the existence of symmetric features encircling chariklo , the second largest known centaur .",
    "@xcite , showed that these structures are a system of two narrow and well - defined rings .",
    "these discovery made the debut of minor bodies within the select group of ringed objects .",
    "in that work , the authors estimated that the rings have orbital radii of approximately @xmath23 and @xmath24 , and width of @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "they are assumed to be in the equatorial plane of chariklo , with circular orbits .",
    "besides an equivalent radius of 124  km derived from the same stellar occultation , few information about the physical properties of chariklo is available . from the orbital position of the rings",
    ", they also estimated the density of the central body to be @xmath27  g/@xmath28 .",
    "table  1 summarizes some of the physical and orbital parameters of chariklo and its rings .",
    "a detailed study of the orbital evolution of the centaurs was presented by @xcite , where they analyzed the orbital evolution of 32 cataloged objects through numerical simulations of an ensemble of particles under the influence of the jovian planets .",
    "they followed the particles both forward and backward in time and registered the dynamical evolution and fate of the particles .",
    "the orbital radius shows that chariklo orbits between saturn and uranus , corresponding to a typical @xmath29 class object , i.e. , those whose evolution is controlled by uranus @xcite . for chariklo , they found the half - life to be 10.3  ( 9.68 )  myr .",
    "the centaur objects are transient .",
    "therefore , a source is required to keep a steady state population .",
    "the idea of bodies coming from regions of the solar system beyond neptune and populating the region between the planets is well - accepted .",
    "@xcite estimated , through numerical integrations , a number of @xmath30 of comets transiting between the inner and outer solar system originating from the kuiper belt .",
    "in fact , @xcite , estimated a flux of one body coming from the kuiper belt and getting into the centaurs population every 125 yr .",
    "@xcite , present the scattered disk objects - sdo ( bodies with distance to the perihelion @xmath31 and semi - major axis @xmath32 ) as the most probable source of the centaurs .",
    "@xcite , analyzed the role of the oort cloud in determining the flux of cometary bodies through the planetary system .",
    "they concluded that a substantial fraction of all known cometary bodies may have a source in the oort cloud , including the centaur population , which they defined as the population small bodies with perihelion @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "following the same definition for centaurs , @xcite present that in fact more than @xmath35 of all centaurs with @xmath36 , and @xmath37 with @xmath38 , come from the oort cloud . in @xcite , the oort cloud",
    "is also pointed out as the source of centaurs , especially those with high - inclination . in that work",
    "the centaur population is defined as small bodies with perihelion between @xmath39 and @xmath40 and semi - major axis shorter than @xmath41 .",
    "they showed that these objects probably were originated from the oort cloud rather than the kuiper belt or the scattered disc .",
    "along its orbital evolution a centaur is strongly perturbed by the giant planets .",
    "@xcite , illustrate in detail the effects of those perturbations on the orbit of five selected centaurs .",
    "the close encounters with the giant planets are quite frequent . as consequence ,",
    "the centaurs present a characteristic chaotic orbital evolution .",
    "the existence of a small body owning a well - defined system of circular rings within such perturbed population poses an interesting new problem .",
    "this scenario has motivated the development of the present work .",
    "we investigated the stability of the rings of chariklo when perturbed by close encounters with the giant planets .",
    "we analyzed how effective are the close encounters in disturb or disrupt the rings of chariklo .",
    "furthermore , the development of this study may allow us to quantitatively evaluate how propitious the region of the centaurs is for such small bodies owning their own systems of rings . a brief qualitative discussion on this subject is presented by @xcite , where it is proposed that the centaur chiron may also have rings .",
    "the possible existence of two small bodies belonging to the same population and owning a system of rings is quite interesting , and indicate that such systems can be more frequent than expected .    since our goal is to analyze the stability of the rings of chariklo while perturbed by close encounter with the giant planets , here we classify it as a centaur while its orbit is mainly in the region between jupiter and neptune ( as in @xcite ) , with maximum semi - major axis value of @xmath42 .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in section [ sec_close_enc ]",
    ", we present the initial conditions and the numerical method adopted in order to identify the close encounters of chariklo with the giant planets . in section [ sec_extreme ] , we present the selection of the extreme close encounters , i.e. , those encounters that could be capable of disrupting the rings of chariklo . in section [ simula_ring ] , we describe how the rings were simulated along a close encounter . in secs .",
    "[ sec_catastrophic ] , [ sec_disturbing ] and [ sec_ejec ] we present the results , and in section [ sec_final ] , are our final comments and the major conclusions of the work .",
    "the first step of the work consisted on selecting a representative sample of close encounters performed by chariklo with the giant planets .",
    "we considered a system composed by the sun , the giant planets of the solar system ( jupiter , saturn , uranus and neptune ) , and a sample of clones , i.e. , objects with the same mass and radius of chariklo , but with small deviations on their orbits .",
    "the clones were created following the procedure presented in @xcite , where 729 clones were created from the original orbit assuming a variation of semi - major axis of @xmath43 , a variation of eccentricity of @xmath44 and a variation of inclination of @xmath45 .",
    "the orbital elements of chariklo and of the planets was obtained through jpl s horizons system for the epoch mjd 56541 . for the orbit of chariklo at this epoch we have @xmath46 ,",
    "@xmath47 and @xmath48 .    considering these orbital elements , and taking the amplitude of variation as in @xcite in such way that we have 729 clones",
    ", we created the clones of chariklo orbiting the sun as follows : @xmath49 , taken every @xmath43 ; @xmath50 , taken every @xmath44 and , @xmath51 , taken every @xmath45 .",
    "the choice of these values resulted in nine values of semi - major axes , nine values of eccentricities and nine values of inclination .",
    "the combination of these values resulted in 729 clones , each one with different values of @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 .    considering that chariklo has an equivalent radius of @xmath55 km and a density of 1 @xmath56 @xcite , we estimated its mass as @xmath57 kg .",
    "we performed backward and forward numerical integrations of the system composed by the sun , by the giant planets and by the clones , for a time span of 100 myrs , using the adaptive time - step hybrid sympletic / bulirsch - stoer algorithm from mercury @xcite .    throughout the numerical integrations the clones",
    "did not interact with each other , but they could collide with the planets or escape from the system .",
    "the collisions were defined by the relative distance between the clones and the planets .",
    "if the clone - planet distance is smaller than the radius of the planet in question , then we have a collision .",
    "the physical radius of the planet is determined by mercury assuming a spherical planet with uniform density .",
    "we consider ejections as being the ejections from the centaur population defined by the relative distance to the sun of @xmath41 .",
    "this value was adopted taking into account that if a clone reach the distance of @xmath41 and it is still in a elliptical orbit then necessarily the semi - major axis of the clone has to be greater than @xmath58 , i.e , the clone is no longer classified as a centaur , according to our definition .    as a result of the integrations , we see in the histograms in figure [ fig_histogram ] that more than @xmath59 of our sample was lost ( ejections or collisions ) in 10 myrs , for both , backward and forward integrations .",
    "these results show that the evolution of our sample is in agreement with the predicted evolution of the centaurs , which has an estimated mean lifetime of about 10 myrs @xcite .",
    "we also note that there is a kind of symmetry on those results , which indicates that chariklo is currently in the middle of its median dynamical lifetime as a centaur .    at the end of the forward integrations",
    ", we found that @xmath60 of the 729 clones were lost in the time span of 100 myrs , being 683 clones lost by ejections and 4 clones lost by collisions ( three with saturn and one with jupiter ) .",
    "for the backward integration , we found that @xmath61 of the clones were lost in 100 myrs , being 719 ejections and 4 collisions ( three with jupiter and one with saturn ) .",
    "once we have characterized the evolution of the sample of clones as a whole , we then selected all close encounters of the clones within @xmath27 hill radius with each giant planet performed within 10 myrs ( mean lifetime of the centaurs ) .",
    "for this time span , there were registered 60159 close encounters for the forward integration , and 65293 encounters for the backward integration . from table  2",
    "we see that in this case uranus dominates , followed by saturn , jupiter and neptune , for both , backward and forward integrations .",
    "this result is in agreement with works on the dynamics of centaurs stating that the dynamics of bodies with similar orbits to the orbit of chariklo should be guided by uranus , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "however , we are interested in analyzing how the close encounters of chariklo with the giant planets might affect its rings . therefore , we selected among all these registered close encounters those that are expected to perturb or disrupt the rings . following are the details of this analysis and the results obtained .",

    "the distance of the close encounter at which the tidal disruption of a binary may occur , is given by : @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the semi - major axis of the binary , @xmath91 is the mass of the planet and @xmath92 and @xmath93 are the masses of the components of the binary .",
    "for a particle orbiting chariklo with @xmath94 km ( approximated outer limit of the ring ) , we calculated the @xmath62 for encounters performed with each one of the giant planets .",
    "these values are presented in table  2 .",
    "it is important to point out that this is an approximated value since it does not take into account the relative velocity of the bodies at the moment of the encounter .",
    "@xcite , has shown that not just the distance of the encounter , but also the relative encounter velocity determine how significantly a body will be disturbed by a close encounter . such effect were also discussed by @xcite , when they compared their numerical analysis on the disruption of neas binaries due to close encounters with the earth , with the analytical prediction given by eq .",

    "a close encounter is registered when a clone of chariklo crosses the limit of @xmath27 hill radius of any of the giant planets . at this crossing moment , we recorded the position and the velocity of these bodies , relative to the sun .",
    "these values are the initial conditions for the simulations of the extreme close encounters , i.e. , encounters with minimum distance within @xmath97 .",
    "thus , at this step , the numerical simulations always involve the sun , the bodies performing the close encounter ( planet and chariklo ) , and a sample of particles orbiting chariklo .",

    "there were considered 100 particles in a random angular distribution . such combination of values resulted in a total of 4100 particles orbiting chariklo .    the pole orientation of chariklo was considered perpendicular to the orbital plane .",
    "this is a reasonable approach since the rings are assumed to be in the equatorial plane of chariklo , and we are interested in the maximized radial perturbations of the rings .",
    "the encounters were simulated for a time span of 1 year using the adaptive time - step gauss - radau numerical integrator , keeping the accuracy @xmath98 @xcite . throughout the integration",

    "[ simula_ring ] .",
    "the results presented in table  3 show that in about @xmath102 of the simulations the rings were removed from chariklo due to close gravitational encounters with the giant planets , for both , backward and forward integrations .    for the forward integration",
    ", we found that only extreme encounters with jupiter and saturn were able to fully remove the rings .",

    "as expected , the values increase with the radial distance . in the region of the rings ( indicated by the vertical lines ) the semi - major axis changes by more than 30 km and the eccentricity grows up to more than 0.5 .",
    "the results of the encounters that produced at least some noticeable variations @xmath108 on the orbits of the rings are presented in table  4 , for backward and forward integrations , excluding the encounters followed by ejection .    for the forward integration",
    ", we observed only five encounters with jupiter and two with saturn that resulted in eccentricities larger than 0.1 for the ring particles .",
    "none of the encounters with uranus and neptune showed significant orbital variation on the particles of the rings . similarly ,",
    "if we look backward , we see fewer close encounters that could have increased the eccentricity of the particles of the rings for values larger than 0.1 ( 5 with jupiter , 1 with saturn and 1 with uranus ) .    since chariklo ,",
    "as observed now , has well - defined narrow circular rings @xcite , it might mean that it did not suffer any of those disturbing encounters or if it happened it was so long ago so that the rings had time to evolve damping the eccentricity and reshaping them .",
    "both possibilities are compatible with our results , and as shown in table  3 , the probability of catastrophic or disturbing encounters is very low , and probably occurred several million years ago .",
    "the close encounters of chariklo with any of the giant planets followed by ejections are especially interesting .",
    "if we look forward , those would be the encounters responsible for removing chariklo from the population of centaurs .",
    "on the other hand , looking backward , those events would be the ones that brought chariklo into the region that we defined as the centaurs population , according to our definition ( see sec .",
    "[ sec_introduction ] ) .",
    "we then looked for the last close encounter ( within @xmath27 hill radius ) that every clone suffered before being ejected .    for the forward integration , we found that approximately @xmath109 of the clones suffered an encounter with jupiter before the ejection , @xmath110 with saturn , @xmath102 with neptune , and @xmath111 with uranus .",
    "for the backward integration , we found that approximately @xmath112 of the encounters were with jupiter , @xmath113 with saturn , @xmath114 with neptune , and @xmath115 with uranus .",
    "as expected , the same pattern is obtained when we restrict our analysis to the total of extreme close encounters , i.e. , encounters performed within @xmath116 ( table  2 and table  3 ) .",
    "we found for the forward integrations that 4 clones of chariklo were ejected after an extreme close encounter with jupiter , 3 with saturn , and none with uranus or neptune .",
    "for the backward integrations , we registered 11 clones ejected after a close encounter with jupiter , 5 with saturn , 2 with uranus , and 1 with neptune .    among these encounters",
    ", we found that only in 6 cases chariklo was ejected just by the close encounter that disrupted the rings .",
    "for the forward integrations , such kind of event occurred 2 times after an encounter with jupiter and one time after an encounter with saturn .",
    "for the backward integrations , we registered 2 cases with jupiter and one with uranus .",
    "thus , our results indicate that for both backward and forward integrations , jupiter and saturn are the mainly responsible for inserting and removing chariklo from the centaurs region .",
    "however , it is important to point out that since our ejection criteria requires that the object goes beyond @xmath41 , it is more likely to have ejections caused by stronger close encounters as those produced by jupiter and saturn .",
    "another consequence of our ejection criteria is that there are bodies that became tnos without being considered ejected .",
    "for example , a plutino - like object with @xmath117 and @xmath118 would remain as a centaur in our simulations .",
    "anyhow , regardless the way that chariklo followed to get in or to go out from the centaur region , our results allow us to conclude that it may have brought the rings when it was introduced into this region and that it can keep them while leaving it .",
    "in the present work we explored the dynamics of the centaur 10199 chariklo and the stability of its rings when disturbed by frequent close encounters with the giant planets .    through numerical integrations we analyzed the orbital evolution of chariklo while a centaur ( orbits mainly in the region between jupiter and neptune and with @xmath119 au ) .",
    "to do so we considered a sample of 729 clones of chariklo with small deviations on semi - major - axis , eccentricity and inclination .    throughout the lifetime of chariklo in the population of the centaurs , we found that the close encounters within @xmath27 hill radius with uranus are more frequent than the encounters with the other planets .",
    "nevertheless , if we look to the most significative close encounters , i.e , those able to disturb or disrupt the rings of chariklo , we found that jupiter and saturn dominate .",
    "for the forward integrations the most significative encounters happened in the last stage of chariklo among the giant planets , and they were performed exclusively with jupiter and saturn .",
    "this indicates that uranus and neptune may not play an important role in the future dynamics of the rings of chariklo , but these planets may have had more influence on the rings in the past . for the backward integrations we found few cases of catastrophic encounters of chariklo with these planets , being three catastrophic encounters with uranus and one with neptune",
    "nevertheless , the difference between forward and backward integrations is subtle and probably arised from a statistical analysis based on a small number of extreme close encounters .    in total , for both backward and forward integrations , we found that the number of close encounters really able to completely disrupt the rings of chariklo is small ( @xmath120 of the clones ) , and they most probably happen in the beginning or in the final stages of chariklo s time as a centaur .",
    "thus , although a typical centaur such as chariklo present a chaotic orbital evolution @xcite , we found that if the body had those rings before becoming a centaur or acquired them in the region among the giant planets , then these rings will probably survive throughout its centaur life .",
    "hence , the formation of the rings of chariklo while a centaur is not mandatory .",
    "therefore , our major conclusion is that centaurs experience a propitious environment to the existence of rings .",
    "furthermore , if there is an efficient mechanism that creates the rings , then these structures may be common among the bodies of this population .",
    "one possible mechanism to create rings around centaurs could be the outcome of extreme close encounters with the giant planets obtained here .",

    "<S> the centaur population is composed by minor bodies wandering between the giant planets and that frequently perform close gravitational encounters with these planets , which leads to a chaotic orbital evolution . </S>",
    "<S> recently , the discovery of two well - defined narrow rings was announced around the centaur 10199 chariklo . </S>",
    "<S> the rings are assumed to be in the equatorial plane of chariklo and to have circular orbits . </S>",
    "<S> the existence a well - defined system of rings around a body in such perturbed orbital region poses an interesting new problem . </S>",
    "<S> are the rings of chariklo stable when perturbed by close gravitational encounters with the giant planets ? </S>",
    "<S> our approach to address this question consisted of forward and backward numerical simulations of 729 clones of chariklo , with similar initial orbits , for a period of @xmath0 myrs . </S>",
    "<S> we found , on average , that each clone suffers along its lifetime more than 150 close encounters with the giant planets within one hill radius of the planet in question . </S>",
    "<S> we identified some extreme close encounters able to significantly disrupt or to disturb the rings of chariklo . </S>",
    "<S> about @xmath1 of the clones lose the rings and about @xmath2 of the clones have the ring significantly disturbed . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , our results show that in most of the cases ( more than @xmath3 ) the close encounters with the giant planets do not affect the stability of the rings in chariklo - like systems . </S>",
    "<S> thus , if there is an efficient mechanism that creates the rings , then these structures may be common among these kinds of centaurs . </S>"
