    "einstein proposed the idea of teleparallelism , or _ fernparallelismus _ ( aka _ absolute parallelism _ , _ distant parallelism _ ) , in order to unify gravity and electromagnetism  @xcite .",
    "unlike general relativity , spacetime in teleparallelism is equipped with a connection with zero curvature , but non - vanishing torsion . since the spacetime is _ flat",
    "_ , the parallel transport of a vector is independent of path , and hence the name _ _",
    "tele__parallel , meaning `` parallel at a distance '' .",
    "einstein s quest for unification via teleparallel theory can be found in the interesting account of  @xcite . despite einstein s failure to formulate a unified theory ,",
    "teleparallelism was later revived and studied as a pure theory of gravity .",
    "the main motivations were ( 1 ) that the teleparallel formulation was considered to have advantages with regard to the identification of the energy - momentum of gravitating systems , and ( 2 ) teleparallel theory can be regarded as a gauge theory of local translations ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) . in fact einstein s general theory of relativity ( gr ) can be rewritten in teleparallel language ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "the result is a theory equivalent to gr known variously as the _ teleparallel equivalent of general relativity _ ( tegr ) or gr@xmath0 .",
    "recently tegr has been generalized to @xmath1 theory , a theory of modified gravity formed in the same spirit as generalizing general relativity to @xmath2 gravity  @xcite .",
    "it seems however that observational data puts rather tight constraints on @xmath1 gravity , effectively reducing the theory ( at least for some choices of @xmath1 ) back to tegr ( however , see also @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "this includes constraints from considering a varying fine structure constant  @xcite , the formation of large - scale structures  @xcite and a varying gravitational constant  @xcite , as well as solar system constraints  @xcite .",
    "this could hint at problems with @xmath1 gravity at the theoretical level .",
    "in this paper we will briefly review tegr and more general theories of teleparallel gravity , including @xmath1 gravity , in section  [ review ] . in section  [ degree ] , we discuss the degrees of freedom for @xmath1 theory .",
    "we know that there are extra degrees of freedom in the theory beyond those of gr ; that the number of extra degrees of freedom is generically 3 was clearly revealed by the dirac constraint analysis carried out by li et al .",
    "despite this , in a careful linear perturbative analysis up to second order on flat friendmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) background , no extra mode appears  @xcite . in the case of minkowski background , this had already been pointed out in  @xcite .",
    "disappearance of extra degrees of freedom is known to happen in some gravity theories ( e.g. , in massive gravity , see  @xcite ) ; this can be caused by the accidental disappearance of kinetic terms at the linear level .",
    "if so , as we shall argue , it is likely to be a signal of superluminal propagation .",
    "we will also discuss the related danger of the _ nonlinear constraint effect _ , which plagued some other theories of gravity in the past .",
    "our conclusion is that @xmath1 theory is very _",
    "likely _ to give rise to unwanted problems due to the effects of nonlinear constraints , in addition to propagation outside of the null cone . as a consequence ,",
    "the number and type of degrees of freedom could vary as a physical system evolves .",
    "this is further explored via the method of characteristics in section  [ method ] .",
    "the method of characteristics is properly introduced in section  [ method ] , where we also provide an illuminating example in an application to the nonlinear proca field .",
    "the same example is given a hamiltonian analysis that clearly shows the close connection of superluminal propagating modes and nonlinear constraints .",
    "although the characteristic equations allow one to obtain superluminal propagating degrees of freedom , one must be careful to distinguish between _ physical _ degrees of freedom and _ gauge _ degrees of freedom , as the example of the maxwell field illustrates .    in section",
    "[ f(t ) ] , we investigate the dynamical equations in @xmath1 theory and derive a system of partial differential equations that describe the characteristics of the theory .",
    "this calculation reveals nonlinear features that are very prone to allow superluminal propagation outside of the metric null cone .. ] furthermore , we also show that the constant - time hypersurface in flrw spacetime , and as a special case minkowski spacetime , can be a cauchy _ horizon _ , which means that even the infinitesimal future time evolution from it is not unique .",
    "we conclude with some discussion in section  [ discuss ] .",
    "let @xmath3 be a semi - riemannian manifold of signature @xmath4 with metric @xmath5 .",
    "the teleparallel theories we wish to discuss use the vierbein field or tetrad @xmath6 as the fundamental dynamical variables .",
    "we use greek letters for spacetime coordinate indices and latin letters to label the tetrad vectors .",
    "suppose that the manifold is _ parallelizable _ , i.e. , there exist @xmath7 vector fields @xmath8 such that at _ any _ point @xmath9 the tangent vectors @xmath10 s provide a basis of the tangent space at @xmath11 . note that this _ particular _ set of vector fields must be able to span the tangent spaces at all points of the manifold , i.e. , it is a set of everywhere linearly independent _ globally non - vanishing vector fields_. then we can view the mapping between the bases of the tangent space in a coordinate frame @xmath12 to that of a non - coordinate frame @xmath13 as an isomorphism @xmath14 .",
    "orthonormality of the tetrad is thus imposed by the minkowski metric on the tangent space @xmath15 , related to the metric on the manifold @xmath3 by @xmath16 .",
    "one then equips the manifold @xmath3 with the metric - compatible weitzenbck connection  @xcite @xmath17 defined by @xmath18 where @xmath19 .",
    "equivalently , the connection coefficients are @xmath20    in local coordinates , the components of the torsion tensor are @xmath21 the weitzenbck connection can be shown to be curvature - free . works . ]",
    "the weitzenbck connection differs from the levi - civita connection by the _ _ contortion tensor _ _",
    "@xmath22    the einstein - hilbert action of general relativity is ( in units where @xmath23 ) @xmath24 up to a total divergence ( which does not affect the field equations ) this action is equivalent to @xmath25 where @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 is a certain quadratic - in - torsion scalar : @xmath29 the latter is the so - called _ torsion scalar_.    in this teleparallel language , ( [ tegraction ] )",
    "is called the _",
    "tegr action_. @xmath1 gravity simply promotes the `` torsion scalar '' in the tegr lagrangian to a function , i.e. the action of @xmath1 gravity is is absorbed into @xmath30 , i.e. , tegr corresponds to @xmath31 . ]",
    "@xmath32    one can then obtain the field equation for @xmath1 theory of modified gravity by varying with respect to the frame @xmath33 , this leads to @xmath34    we remark that the ( quadratic - in-)torsion scalar defined above is a very special one .",
    "we note that mathematically we can define a more general torsion `` scalar '' @xmath35 by relaxing the coefficients : @xmath36 in particular one can construct the one - parameter combination @xmath37 =   \\frac{1 + 2\\lambda}{4}\\overset{w}t{}^\\rho{}_{\\eta\\mu}\\overset{w}t_\\rho{}^{\\eta\\mu } + \\frac{1 - 2\\lambda}{2}\\overset{w}t{}^\\rho{}_{\\mu\\eta}\\overset{w}t{}^{\\eta\\mu}{}_\\rho - \\overset{w}t_{\\rho\\mu}{}^\\rho \\overset{w}t{}^{\\nu\\mu}{}_\\nu,\\ ] ] where @xmath38 .",
    "years ago a teleparallel theory using this as the lagrangian was proposed as an alternative to gr .",
    "this theory passed all observational ( as of , perhaps up to , 1990 )  @xcite and some theoretical tests  @xcite .",
    "but then certain theoretical problems were found , which we will discuss in the next section .",
    "we summarize how teleparallel theories work : we start with choosing a good local orthonormal frame @xmath13 which is _ declared _ to be covariantly constant under parallel transport by imposing the weitzenbck connection .",
    "this defines a global frame field that sometimes goes by the name _ orthoteleparallel frame _ or ot frame .",
    "recall that there are infinitely many possible choices of frames that span the same tangent space at @xmath9 , related to each other by elements of the proper orthochronous lorentz group .",
    "the torsion tensor and consequently the torsion scalar , can thus be expressed in terms of any one of these infinitely many bases .",
    "once we get a parallelization , it is defined up to _ global _ lorentz transformation .",
    "this defines a weitzenbck geometry .",
    "the set of all possible parallelizations of @xmath3 is then partitioned into equivalence classes consisting of parallelizations that relate to each other in the same class by a global lorentz transformation ( thus , one _ can not _ pass from one parallelizations to another by a local lorentz transformation ) .",
    "note that at this stage , nonzero torsion _ does not _",
    "mean that we have some `` distinguished frames '' or preferred frames ; any equivalence class of frames are on the same footing , in the sense that they parallelized the spacetime equally well .",
    "however , once we introduce the physics via the action , we get field equations . _ now _ we can only admit certain classes of parallelizations , just as in general relativity where we can only admit metrics that satisfy the einstein field equations .",
    "we remark that due to the lack of local lorentz invariance ( see also the discussions in  @xcite and  @xcite ) , unlike in general relativity where we can change coordinate systems and use any frame fields , this is not so in generic teleparallel theories . as a consequence ,",
    "this implies that we can not directly extract the tetrad from the metric in the straightforward way .",
    "tegr is special since its action does not determine the admissible ot frame but only the metric . from now onwards , we will suppress all the explicit overscript @xmath39 s on the torsion scalar and connection coefficients etc .",
    "we are reminded of the problem faced by the one - parameter teleparallel theory in which the teleparallel lagrangian has the form  ( [ optp ] ) .",
    "this theory has 4 extra degrees of freedom  @xcite .",
    "kopczyski  @xcite first pointed out that this theory has predictability problems ; he argued that one is unable to determine uniquely the evolution of the teleparallel geometry .",
    "however , further analysis  @xcite showed that the problem is not generic , instead it only occurs for a special class of solutions .",
    "cheng et al .",
    "verified this behavior using the hamiltonian approach and identified the troubles as a certain effect of nonlinear constraints , there referred to as _ constraint bifurcation _",
    "@xcite , in which the chain of constraints could `` bifurcate '' depending on the values of the fields . that is to say ,",
    "the number or type of constraints would depend on the values of the phase space variables .",
    "one could imagine that the evolution of some system as depicted by a curve in phase space could pass through regions with a different number or type of constraints",
    ". this would be rather strange ( since this means that the number of gauges and _ physical _ degrees of freedom also change ) , and one will find it hard , if at all possible , to predict the evolution of the system . to put it in another way , the matrix with the poisson brackets of the constraints as entries may not have constant rank , due to the nonlinearity of the constraints . the number or type of constraints may change as one approaches a point in the phase space where the rank changes .",
    "the more general poincar gauge theory also has similar problems  @xcite .",
    "we suspect that this might also be the case for @xmath1 theory ( and probably for many teleparallel theories ) .",
    "it is of course conceivable that with a specific choice of @xmath1 , we could prevent the solutions from ever approaching such problematic regions in phase space , e.g. , if they would act as a dynamical _",
    "repeller_.    the number of degrees of freedom of a generic @xmath1 theory of gravity ( in @xmath40-dimensions ) has been found to be five by miao li et al .",
    "@xcite using a hamiltonian approach .",
    "that is , there are three extra degrees of freedom , which the authors suggest could correspond to one massive vector field or one massless vector field with one scalar field . to understand the properties of the degrees of freedom in a theory",
    ", one should first try to analyze them by a perturbative approach .",
    "however , it could happen that not all degrees of freedom show up in the perturbation level .    for the case of @xmath1 gravity ,",
    "as remarked by li et al . at the end of their paper  @xcite , for some special backgrounds ( including minkowski space with @xmath41 ) , some of the extra degrees of freedom do not appear in the _ linear _ perturbation .",
    "it is also found that  @xcite , on the flat flrw background with a scalar field , linear perturbation up to second order does not reveal _ any _ extra degree of freedom . in other words ,",
    "@xmath1 theory is _ highly nonlinear _ : the number and type of constraints in the linear theory is _ different _ from that of the full , nonlinear theory .",
    "this is also one of the problematic features discussed in the context of poincar gauge theory  @xcite .",
    "the worry of such behavior is that linearized modes which are `` good '' may cease to be so in the full nonlinear theory , perhaps accompanied by anomalous characteristics , as we will further comment on in the later sections .    the revealing hamiltonian discussion of li et al .  for @xmath1 gravity in ( 3 + 1 ) dimensional",
    "spacetime is rather complicated and some of the results are only inferred implicitly .",
    "however they also worked out _ explicitly _ the analogous but somewhat simpler hamiltonian formulation for @xmath1 gravity in @xmath42-dimensions ; for this case the problem we wish to address is clearly evident . in this case",
    "there are six first class constraints @xmath43 , where @xmath44 and @xmath45 , as well as four second class constraints @xmath46 , which leads to two degrees of freedom .",
    "they define the quantities    & y_i = \\{h_0 , ^i } ,  y_3 = \\{h_0 , ^12 } , + & x_0 = \\{h_0 , } ,  x_i = \\{^i , } ,  x_3 = \\{^i , } ,    and @xmath47\\partial_m\\phi.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the self - consistency equation in matrix form is shown to be @xmath48 , where @xmath49 and @xmath50 satisfies @xmath51 .",
    "this matrix generically is of rank 4 .",
    "however , as previously mentioned , some of the poisson brackets could vanish in some cases , which would result in rank changes of the matrix as the system evolves .",
    "miao li et al .  found the explicit formulas for the lagrange multipliers : @xmath52 @xmath53 @xmath54 @xmath55 while they were interested in the most general case and thus only considered the case with @xmath56 , this type of special case is _ precisely _ what we are interested in in this work .",
    "indeed one sees that in principle @xmath57 can vanish , yet the numerators of these expressions are not generally constrained to vanish at the same time , which allows one or more of the lagrange multipliers to become unbounded . as we will explain below , this is signaling a superluminal propagation mode .",
    "a viable theory of gravity should satisfy certain theoretical criteria , including the lack of tachyonic modes , or modes that carry negative kinetic energy ( i.e. , ghosts ) .. ] the theory should also support a well - posed initial value problem , that is , satisfy the cauchy - kowalevski theorem  @xcite .",
    "moreover any propagation mode in the theory should also be described by hyperbolic quasi - linear partial differential equations with well - behaved characteristics , i.e. , the characteristic surfaces should be non - spacelike .",
    "one should also consider a theory with a `` good '' minkowski limit as preferable to a theory that does not have such behavior .",
    "the method for studying characteristics is well - known ; see for example the detailed classical work of courant and hilbert  @xcite , or chapter 8 of the more recent text of  @xcite .",
    "a discussion of the method of characteristics in the case of general relativity can be found in lecture 14 of  @xcite . for more rigorous treatment",
    "see  @xcite , as well as in @xcite .",
    "see also  @xcite for some useful discussions in the context of external fields in gauge theories .",
    "here we only give a brief summary .",
    "recall that if @xmath58 is a linear differential operator of order @xmath59 , then we can consider @xmath58 as a polynomial in the derivative @xmath60 . in multi - index notation",
    "we can write this as @xmath61 we may ask in what directions it is really of order @xmath59 . for an ode @xmath62 for example , it is obvious that @xmath63 is the condition required for the equation to be of order @xmath59 everywhere . for pdes with multiple variables ,",
    "we need to be careful .",
    "consider for example the laplacian @xmath64 in @xmath65 .",
    "this is clearly of order 2 in both the @xmath66- and @xmath67-direction , however for an operator which is mixed , e.g. , @xmath68 , it is _ not _ of order 2 in either the @xmath66- or @xmath67-direction .",
    "nevertheless , it _ is _ a second - order operator , which can be revealed by introducing new variables , @xmath69 , which renders @xmath70 .",
    "that is , this operator is of order 2 in the @xmath71 and @xmath72 directions . in general then , given any operator @xmath58 at @xmath66 , and a direction @xmath73 , we can make an orthogonal change of variable so that @xmath73 points along one of the new coordinate axes , say the @xmath74-axis .",
    "now , if the coefficient of the partial derivative @xmath75 ( in the new coordinate system ) is nonzero at @xmath66 , then we can say that @xmath58 is of order @xmath59 at @xmath66 in the direction @xmath73 .",
    "we refer to such situation as _",
    "noncharacteristic_. that is , _ characteristic _ refers to the case in which the coefficient of @xmath75 vanishes at @xmath66 .",
    "the _ total symbol _ or _ top - order symbol _ of @xmath58 is simply a polynomial obtained by replacing the derivative @xmath60 with a variable , say @xmath76 . the _ principal symbol _",
    ", denoted @xmath77 , is the highest degree component of the total symbol .",
    "that is , @xmath78 the principal symbol almost completely determines the qualitative behavior of the solutions of the system .",
    "furthermore , it is well known that for hyperbolic ( as well as parabolic ) partial differential equations , the zeros of the principal symbol describe the characteristics of the system .",
    "that is to say , _",
    "the characteristic directions are exactly those for which the principal symbol vanishes_. indeed the `` standard procedure '' is to begin with the equation of motion or the field equation , keep only the highest derivative terms , and then replace the said derivatives @xmath79 with components of the normal vector to the characteristics @xmath80 and set the equation to zero .",
    "this is called the _",
    "characteristic equation_. we can study how the characteristics propagate by looking for what sorts of vectors are allowed as solutions to the characteristic equation .",
    "note that for a characteristic equation that is a _ matrix _ equation , called the _",
    "characteristic matrix _",
    ", it suffices to consider the vanishing of the determinant of the characteristic equation ( known as the _ characteristic determinant _ ) instead of the vanishing of the equation itself ( the latter is of course a stronger statement ) .    in this paper , we are interested in one ( or a few ) special characteristic direction that gives the signal of a superluminal mode . by analyzing the characteristic determinant",
    ", we can examine all directions at once .",
    "the _ characteristic surface _ which is orthogonal to the characteristic direction coincides with the edge of cauchy development , i.e. , the cauchy horizon .",
    "this is because the higher order derivative term with respect to the characteristic direction disappears .",
    "the disappearance of the higher order derivative term causes the evolution to be singular .",
    "thus , the cauchy development of the characteristic surface is only the characteristic surface itself and the evolution from it is meaningless even if it is spacelike .    note that for application in theories of gravity , we would like our characteristic directions to be null or spacelike , as a timelike characteristic direction is the signal of superluminal propagation ( and could violate causality , although this is not necessarily so even in theories with local lorentz invariance  @xcite ) .",
    "correspondingly , there should _ not _ be any non - trivial solution that corresponds to any _ timelike _ vector .",
    "the characteristic method is best illustrated via an example or two .",
    "consider the lagrangian of the proca field with a nonlinear term  @xcite : @xmath81 where @xmath82 and @xmath83 the signature is @xmath4 .",
    "the field equations are @xmath84 upon taking the divergence of this equation , because the first term vanishes by the antisymmetry of @xmath85 , we obtain an implicit constraint satisfied by the system : @xmath86 for @xmath87 , this gives @xmath88 , which upon substituting back into the field equation ( [ nlprocaeq ] ) gives @xmath89 which is the klein - gordon equation .",
    "the characteristic equation for this case is just @xmath90 , i.e. , the characteristic is null .    to find the characteristics in the general @xmath91 case ,",
    "replace the highest derivative terms @xmath92 by @xmath93 . here",
    "@xmath94 means it is not the value of the vector @xmath95 , but represents the change of the vector in a certain direction .",
    "we then get the relations @xmath96 a linear combination of these gives @xmath97k\\cdot \\tilde a=0.\\label{anomolous}\\ ] ] now from eq .",
    "( [ procafechar ] ) one can see that modes with @xmath98 propagate with null characteristics , but from eq .",
    "( [ anomolous ] ) one can see that modes with @xmath99 generally have non - null characteristics .",
    "the normal to the characteristic surface could be timelike , indicating a superluminal characteristic . in that case",
    "there is a lorentz frame in which @xmath100 .",
    "in such a frame the condition is @xmath101    we want to emphasize that this tachyonic mode of the nonlinear proca field can be detected using the hamiltonian formulation , as we now explain . from the lagrangian ,",

    ".    however , there is an important exception when the rhs vanishes , _ this is exactly the same as the anomalous characteristic condition _ ( [ procachar ] ) .",

    "consequently , the field `` velocity '' @xmath113 , given by the lagrange multiplier , @xmath106 , becomes unbounded at any point(s ) where @xmath114 approaches 0 .",
    "that is , @xmath115 this is an indication that , with respect to this constant time spacelike hypersurface , there is instantaneous propagation of the @xmath116 mode .",
    "the nonlinear constraint has led to a field - dependent constraint poisson bracket value , a signal for the occurrence of superluminal propagation , in complete agreement with the previous analysis obtained from the characteristic equation .",
    "one issue that we have to be careful with is the possible presence of gauge degrees of freedom in a theory ( which was _ not _ present in the previous nonlinear proca field example ) .    in order to appreciate the issue",
    ", first we shall look at the simple example of scalar fields .",
    "we consider the lagrangian for the single scalar field defined by @xmath117 we know that the scalar field @xmath118 propagates in the null direction . in terms of characteristics",
    ", we can understand it as follows .",
    "the equation of motion is @xmath119 so the characteristic equation for @xmath118 is @xmath120 , which means the characteristic is null .",
    "let us introduce another scalar field @xmath121 which does not appear in the lagrangian .",
    "trivially , the lagrangian does not change under the transformation @xmath122 .",
    "this property is a certain kind of gauge transformation .",
    "the equation of motion which comes from the variation of the lagrangian ( [ lags ] ) with respect to @xmath121 is trivial , i.e. , @xmath123 .",
    "thus the characteristic equation for @xmath118 and @xmath121 becomes @xmath124 , which is trivially satisfied for any @xmath125 .",
    "the triviality comes from the gauge mode @xmath121 .",
    "since @xmath121 does not appear in the lagrangian , we should not include it in the discussion of characteristics .",
    "the situation for any gauge field theory is similar . for simplicity",
    ", we consider the maxwell theory of the electromagnetic field ; the lagrangian is @xmath126 where @xmath127 . the equation of motion is obtained to be @xmath128 the principal symbol yields the characteristic equation @xmath129 where we want to seek some nontrivial @xmath130 .",
    "if @xmath131 is null then @xmath132 gives a propagating mode on the null cone .",

    "@xmath133 for arbitrary constant @xmath134 .",

    "this superluminal mode however , as we shall see , actually corresponds to gauge mode and so it is not physical .",
    "alternatively we can consider the determinant method . if we write down the characteristic equation without removing the gauge degree of freedom",
    ", we will obtain characteristic matrix that satisfies @xmath135 = 0 . \\label{eommax}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the left - hand side of this equation is @xmath136 for any @xmath137 , and so this equation becomes trivial .",
    "the origin of the triviality is the gauge degree of freedom . if we operate @xmath138 to the left - hand of eq .",
    "( [ eommax2 ] ) , it becomes algebraically @xmath136 .",
    "therefore , eq .  ( [ eommax2 ] ) has the information of only three independent equations .",
    "we know the maxwell field has @xmath139-gauge , i.e. , the lagrangian is invariant under the @xmath139-gauge transformation @xmath140 .",

    ".  showed that there are only 3 extra modes instead of 6 .",
    "regardless , we see that the antisymmetric modes _ are _ excited in a highly nonlinear fashion that is very prone to causing troubles .",
    "in fact , these extra modes are certain to have a very singular weak field limit , since the linearized theory has only the metric degrees of freedom .",
    "the number of degrees of freedom and the number of constraints thus seem to be likely to depend on the amplitude of the field .",
    "as the tetrad fields approach some specific values , some of the poisson brackets are approaching zero , which in turn means that their corresponding `` velocity '' lagrange multipliers tend to become unbounded , which signals the occurrence of _ instantaneous _ ,",
    "i.e. , faster - than - light propagation , much like the situation we have exhibited for the nonlinear proca field ( see also the similar discussion in  @xcite . ) .",
    "moreover these extra dynamic parts are likely to propagate outside the metric null cone and are also likely to allow for negative energy propagating waves . by further analyzing the characteristic matrix of @xmath1 gravity",
    ", we have shown that there is indeed a _",
    "physical _ superluminal mode that could arise from one of the three extra degrees of freedom . closely related to this issue",
    ", we have also demonstrated that the cauchy problem is ill - posed in flat flrw spacetime and even in minkowski spacetime .",
    "we feel that this is a very bad property for any theory of gravity .",
    "this echoes the remark ( lesson 4 ) in  @xcite that extra degrees of freedom in modified gravities are prone to give rise to complications that are very hard to control .",
    "although that remark was made under the context of @xmath2 gravity , it apparently also holds true for @xmath1 gravity .",
    "we recall that @xmath1 gravity was often thought of as being more well - behaved and easier to deal with compared to @xmath2 gravity , since its equation of motion is of second order instead of fourth order .",
    "however it now seems that this advantage comes with many trade - offs .",
    "for example , unlike its @xmath2 counterpart , @xmath1 gravity is not locally lorentz invariant , and thus it is much more difficult to impose an ansatz for a solution _ a priori _ except in the simplest situations , such as for a flat spacetime .",
    "furthermore , as we pointed out in this work , many problems that do not arise in @xmath2 theory could arise in @xmath1 gravity due to extra degrees of freedom and nonlinearity of the constraints .",
    "we recall that in  @xcite , it is pointed out that the extra degrees of freedom do not appear at the linear perturbation level on a flrw background , and that this behavior is similar to that of nonlinear massive gravity  @xcite in which , while nonlinear analysis shows that there are generically five gravitational degrees of freedom  @xcite , in the second order action on open flrw background there are only two tensor degrees of freedom  @xcite .",
    "since the hidden degrees of freedom in fact cause nonlinear instability in the case of nonlinear massive gravity  @xcite , it is a concern that @xmath1 theory could exhibit a similar pathology .",
    "here we would like to point out another similarity between nonlinear massive gravity and @xmath1 gravity : they both probably exhibit superluminal propagation modes . the case for nonlinear massive gravity",
    "was studied in  @xcite , in which the authors investigated the effect of the helicity-0 mode of the theory and found that energy can probably be emitted superluminously on the self - accelerating background . in the case of the ghost - free wess - zumino",
    "massive gravity  @xcite , deser and waldron recently showed that it also exhibits superluminal propagation modes  @xcite .    here",
    "we should also make some comments on the possibility of _ negative energy solutions _ in @xmath1 gravity . in  @xcite it was shown , directly in terms of the teleparallel variables , that tegr only permits positive energy . in general relativity , this is a well - known theorem proved initially by schoen and yau  @xcite and subsequently by witten  @xcite . in the tegr formulation",
    "the argument was that one can arrange for the hamiltonian to be dominated by positive terms . a key step in the argument",
    "was using the local frame gauge freedom to remove or at least control the non - positive terms in the tegr hamiltonian .",
    "but in @xmath1 gravity ( and teleparallel theory in general ) one does _ not _ have local frame gauge freedom .",
    "therefore there is no way to kill or control some of the non - positive terms .    in the positive energy test developed in  @xcite ,",
    "it is argued that while it is hard to prove that the energy for some theory is positive for every solution to the initial value constraints , it is not so hard to show that a negative energy solution exists .",
    "indeed it is sufficient to show that the initial value constraints admit a non - trivial zero energy solution . if so the theory should be discarded . in principle",
    "this is a very strong test of a theory ( i.e. , it could exclude many theories which pass other tests ) .",
    "unfortunately in practice it was not so easy to find _ even one _ bad solution explicitly , so it is generally hard work getting results beyond those of the linearized theory . in any case , to us",
    "it seems likely that @xmath1 gravity would be very vulnerable to having a nontrivial non - positive energy solution for most choices of @xmath30 , although it is not expected to be very easy to show this .",
    "although our work is purely classical , we would also like to make a brief comment regarding strong coupling problem once we consider _ quantizing _ the theory : naively , the lack of extra degrees of freedom at the linear level is caused by accidental disappearance of certain kinetic terms at the linear level .",
    "vanishing of kinetic terms at the linear level corresponds to the small limit of their coefficients , which in turn means the nonlinear coupling terms of the canonically normalized modes are becoming very strong .",
    "consequently the perturbative approach can not be applied and the theory is out of control at the quantum level .",
    "then there is no reason to trust the classical effective action any more  @xcite .",
    "this is expected to be a problem if one attempts to naively quantize @xmath1 gravity .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that existence of ghosts in a classical theory of gravity may be acceptable if the ghost can be pushed to the planck scale , to be dealt with by quantum theory of gravity @xcite .",
    "finally , it is worth emphasizing that due to the fact that @xmath1 theory is highly nonlinear , a full rigorous analysis is at best a very difficult task .",
    "one could have a viable theory if one manages to find a particular choice of @xmath30 that could avoid the problems raised in this work .",
    "in other words , these seemingly serious `` problems '' could in fact be a blessing in disguise , since they may provide a guide for narrowing down the viable forms of @xmath30 .",
    "we conclude by the following remark : we agree that non - linear theories merit investigation , but , as far as we can see , @xmath1 gravity does not seem to have the right kind of non - linearity ; its non - linearity may be too simple . as commented in @xcite ,",
    "it is possible that this could be an indication that an _ even more nonlinear theory _ is required .",
    "recall that the linearized spin-2 theory of gravity has problems that are only cured by nonlinearities of the full theory of general relativity ( see , e.g. , route 5 in box 17.2 in mtw @xcite , or feynman s lectures on gravitation @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , in fierz - pauli massive gravity @xcite , the vaishtein mechanism @xcite ( introduced to avoid the vdvz @xcite discontinuity ) excites the boulware - deser ghost @xcite due to non - linearity .",
    "however , by introducing additional non - linearity , this ghost mode can be killed ( this is the so - called \" nonlinear massive gravity ) @xcite . not surprisingly , this newly introduced non - linearity seems to give rise to other problems @xcite . while inherently non - linear theories certainly merit serious consideration ; finding one that is free of problems , in particular of the kind we have discussed , seems not so easy .",
