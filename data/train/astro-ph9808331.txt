    "in order to better understand the nature of star formation occurring in nearby starburst galaxies and to provide a foundation for studies of higher redshift systems , we have been analyzing the properties of the 20 starburst galaxies with the highest 5 ghz luminosities from condon , frayer , & broderick ( 1991 ) .",

    "infrared imaging data indicate the presence of strong central peaks of star formation , a program has been undertaken to obtain high  resolution near  infrared images of the cores of these galaxies , with the goal of improving our understanding of the origin and evolution of the activity in these systems .    in this paper , we report the discovery of a luminous near  infrared counterpart to the ring of 6 cm radio emission in the galaxy ngc  7771 ( ugc  12815 ) ( neff & hutchings 1992 ) . of the 20 very luminous starburst galaxies studied in paper 3 , only two contain circumnuclear starburst rings : ngc  7771 and ngc  7469 ( ugc  12332 ) .",
    "the properties of ngc  7469 are discussed in detail by genzel et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , and references therein .",
    "in contrast to ngc  7771 , ngc  7469 also contains a seyfert 1 nucleus .",
    "examples of less luminous galaxies containing circumnuclear rings which are and are not accompanied by a central agn are plentiful in the literature ( e.g. buta & crocker 1993 , schinnerer et al .",

    "the galaxies ngc  7771 and ngc  7469 thus serve as links between highly luminous objects and well  studied , lower luminosity galaxies characterized by circumnuclear rings and provide testbeds for theories concerning the evolution of luminous starbursts , ringed systems , and agn .",
    "the barred sa galaxy ngc  7771 ( @xmath8 mpc , @xmath9 km s@xmath6 mpc@xmath6 ) belongs to lyon galaxy group # 483 ( garcia 1993 ) .",
    "this group , whose central velocity is 4506 km s@xmath6 , is also called the ngc  7771 group and is comprised of ngc  7769 , ngc  7771 , ngc  7786 , ngc  7770 , and ugc  12828 .",
    "nordgren et al .  (",
    "1997 ) have recently confirmed that a small object located to the west of ngc  7771 ( ngc  7771a ) is also a dynamical member of the group .",
    "ngc  7770 and ngc  7771 are identified as a pair ( kpg  592 ) by karachentsev ( 1987 ) .",
    "ngc  7771 itself is clearly disturbed , as evidenced by the rotation curve described by keel ( 1993 ) , the  profile obtained by hutchings ( 1989 ) , the  tail found by nordgren et al .",

    "the  velocity field confirms that ngc  7771 is interacting with ngc  7769 and ngc  7771a ( nordgren et al .",

    "heavy extinction is also present , as evidenced by the patchy emission and the dust lane observed in the @xmath11 band image shown in figure [ fig : ipic ] .",
    "this image was obtained by r.  giovanelli and m.  haynes ( private communication ) with the 0.9 m telescope at kitt peak national observatory@xmath12 under non  photometric conditions and @xmath13 seeing .",
    "a large scale bar visible in optical and near  infrared images at @xmath14 may be channeling gas into the nuclear regions of ngc  7771 ( osman 1986 ; paper 2 ; figure [ fig : ipic ] ) .",
    "previous studies indicate that ngc  7771 is experiencing an intense burst of star formation and that it does not contain an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) . the ratio of the radio and the optical fluxes is higher than average for a spiral galaxy , suggesting the presence of an emission source other than `` normal '' disk emission .",
    "the similarity of the radio / optical flux ratio and the radio / far  infrared flux ratio to those of starburst galaxies and the lack of a strong , compact radio source suggest that the emission from ngc  7771 is powered by intense star formation , as opposed to an agn ( condon , frayer , & broderick 1991 ; batuski , hanisch , & burns 1992 ) .",
    "finally , optical line ratios indicate the presence of star formation activity and show no evidence of an agn ( veilleux et al .",

    "( 1990 ) indicate the presence of extended 2 @xmath20 m emission in the vicinity of the circumnuclear ring of radio emission .",
    "since near  infrared spectroscopy suggests that young red supergiants are present in the central regions of ngc  7771 ( paper 3 ) , a comparison between the radio and the near  infrared emission provides a valuable opportunity to trace the evolution of the starburst .",
    "below , we discuss the results of @xmath21 fwhm resolution near  infrared imaging and their implications concerning the origin and evolution of the starburst in ngc  7771 .",
    "ngc  7771 was observed in the standard @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 bands with the caltech cassegrain infrared camera at the 5 m hale telescope on 25 october 1994 .",
    "the camera utilizes a @xmath25 insb array with a scale of @xmath26 pixel@xmath6 , and follows the cit photometric system .",
    "the nuclear starburst region is easily imaged within the resulting @xmath27 field of view .",
    "observations consisted of a series of alternating source and sky exposures .",
    "the galaxy was observed at multiple positions on the array in order to minimize any possible instrumental effects .",
    "sky frames were taken to the north , south , east , and west of ngc  7771 using a @xmath28 nod , which is sufficient to move beyond the optical extent of the galaxy .",
    "exposure times ranged from 10 s at @xmath24 , 40 s at @xmath23 , to 150 s at @xmath22 .",
    "the efficiency of the @xmath23 and @xmath24 band data acquisition was increased by coadding multiple frames at each position .",
    "we observed ngc  7771 for a total of 460 s at @xmath24 , 360 s at @xmath23 , and 600 s at @xmath22 .",
    "stable seeing conditions ( @xmath21 fwhm in all three bands ) were present throughout the observations .",
    "standard data reduction procedures were applied to the data . a full discussion of general data reduction techniques may be found in paper 1 and in paper 2 and will not be repeated here . in summary ,",
    "the data were linearized , sky  subtracted , and then flat  fielded .",
    "images were aligned according to the position of the centroid of the galaxy nucleus in each frame , and then mosaicked . since thin",
    "cirrus was present during the data acquisition , the fluxes quoted in paper 2 were used to calibrate the data .",
    "these fluxes are the most accurate of those found in the literature to date .",
    "the colors of a @xmath29 aperture , @xmath30 mag and @xmath31 mag , are in excellent agreement with those of carico et al .",
    "( 1988 ) , who derive @xmath32 mag and @xmath33 mag .",
    "the comparison between the two datasets suggests that the formal uncertainty in the @xmath34 color may be an overestimate .",
    "fluxes and colors were derived for the current dataset with a synthetic circular aperture @xmath35 in diameter .",
    "this aperture size was selected as a compromise between a @xmath36 diameter aperture , which collects all of the flux from an isolated @xmath21 fwhm point source , and one which best isolates the observed features .",
    "observations of isolated point sources indicate that a @xmath35 aperture integrates 50% of the total flux emitted by a @xmath21 fwhm point source .",
    "uncertainties were derived and quantities were corrected for redshift as in paper 2 .",
    "the redshift corrections are small ( @xmath37 mjy ) .",
    "the uncertainties are dominated by that of the flux calibration .",
    "color transformations were not necessary since both the calibration fluxes and the cassegrain infrared camera utilize the cit photometric system .",
    "color maps were formed from the flux ",
    "calibrated images by aligning a prominent feature observed in all three bands ( feature kg in figure [ fig : kband ] , see below ) . the nucleus can not be used to align the images since its @xmath22 band morphology differs significantly from its @xmath23 and @xmath24 band morphologies . in the @xmath22 band ,",
    "the distinctness of the nucleus is compromised by the presence of extended emission to the northeast .",
    "the centroid of the nucleus itself is therefore not well determined in the @xmath22 band .",
    "we confirmed the image alignment by blinking the registered images and by comparing the resulting color maps to lower resolution data obtained with the prime focus infrared camera ( pfircam ) ( paper 2 ) . low ",
    "resolution color maps were re  derived from the pfircam data presented in paper 2 by aligning the point source located in the eastern arm of ngc  7771 .",
    "the high  resolution data were smoothed and rebinned to match the pfircam spatial resolution and sampling .",
    "we find good agreement between the two sets of color maps .",
    "the @xmath24 band image of the nuclear starburst region is displayed in greyscale in figure [ fig : kband ] along with the nomenclature of the various knots .",
    "contours representing the ring of radio emission observed by neff & hutchings ( 1992 ) are shown in overlay in figure [ fig : k_radio ] .",
    "images obtained in the @xmath23 and @xmath22 bands are shown in figures [ fig : hband ] and [ fig : jband ] .",
    "a near  infrared circumnuclear structure approximately @xmath18 ( 1.6 kpc ) in diameter is clearly visible ; however , figures [ fig : kband][fig : jband ] indicate that the spatial distribution of the emission varies strongly as a function of the observed wavelength . at 2.2 @xmath20 m , a clumpy ring  like structure surrounds the nucleus of ngc  7771 .",
    "although still visible , the 2.2 @xmath20 m emitting clusters are less pronounced at 1.65 @xmath20 m .",
    "the circumnuclear morphology at 1.25 @xmath20 m is clearly dominated by the southeastern ridge of knots . with the exception of this ridge ,",
    "the remaining clumps have faded into the diffuse background light of the galaxy . on the basis of the differential morphology observed in the @xmath22 through @xmath24 bands",
    ", we suspect that many of the knots comprising the ring are obscured at shorter wavelengths . the @xmath11 band image shown in figure [ fig : ipic ] and",
    "the other optical images referred to in section [ sec : intro ] do not possess sufficient spatial resolution to test this hypothesis .",
    "this issue will be discussed further in section [ sec : tau ] .",
    "the @xmath38 behavior of this starburst ring may be contrasted with that of the ring in the luminous starburst @xmath7 seyfert 1 galaxy ngc  7469 , in which the emission becomes progressively smoother from the @xmath22 to @xmath24 bands ( genzel et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "the data indicate that the relative intensities of the knots at near  infrared and radio wavelengths are variable .",
    "for example , the brightest region in the @xmath24 band is the linear ridge of emission ( knots kf  kh ) ; the brightest knot at 6 cm is the westernmost knot ( ra ) .",
    "furthermore , the clumps that are prominent at 2.2 @xmath20 m are _ not _ spatially coincident with those observed at 6 cm and appear to be nearly perfectly anti  correlated with the radio emitting features .",
    "the distribution of the @xmath24 band knots appears to follow an ellipse with semi  major and semi  minor axes of @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively , at pa @xmath41",
    ". the apparent axis ratio of the k band ring is @xmath42 .",
    "the distribution of the radio clumps can be described in terms of a similar ellipse ( @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 ) whose semi  major axis lies at pa @xmath46 .",
    "the data have been carefully examined for instrumental effects and alignment effects , and we conclude that this anti  correlation is in fact real .    to assess the intrinsic structure of the rings , we have deprojected the ellipses defined by the near  infrared and the radio emitting knots ( e.g. buta 1986a ; buta 1986b ; buta 1990 ; buta & purcell 1998 ) .",
    "the results of the deprojections should be regarded with caution since the inherent assumption of coplanar orbits may not be valid in an interacting system .",
    "the situation is further complicated by the high inclination angle and the uncertainty in the inclination angle .",
    "osman ( 1986 ) derives an inclination angle of @xmath47 from the outer ( @xmath48 ) isophotes of a blue photograph of ngc  7771 . using a gunn r image , nordgren et al .",
    "( 1997 ) find a value of @xmath49 .",
    "ellipse fitting to the @xmath11 band image shown in figure [ fig : ipic ] reveals that the distorted morphology of ngc  7771 is at least partly responsible for this large range of values .",
    "the @xmath11 band data show the presence of a bright elongated structure between radii of @xmath50 with @xmath51 and a more circular outer disk with @xmath52 .",
    "ellipse fitting at radii @xmath53 becomes unreliable , as the observed material is contaminated by tidal features .",
    "we adopt an inclination angle of @xmath54 , based upon the ellipticity of the @xmath11 band isophotes in the relatively undisturbed region located between @xmath55 , and an assumed intrinsic axial ratio of 0.2 .",
    "this value of the inclination angle is intermediate between those of osman ( 1986 ) and nordgren et al .",
    "the implied intrinsic axis ratios are @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "we note that the intrinsic axis ratios could be as round as @xmath58 and @xmath59 if @xmath60 , and as oblate as @xmath61 and @xmath62 if @xmath63 . the large uncertainty in the intrinsic shapes of the rings reflects the difficulties of assessing the intrinsic structure of a highly inclined , interacting system .",
    "the intrinsic major axis of the nuclear k band ring is aligned with that of the radio ring to within @xmath64 for all three inclination angles , i.e.  the displacement between the major axes of the near  infrared and the radio rings is largely a projection effect .",
    "the locations of the individual near  infrared and radio emitting knots remain anti  correlated after deprojection , however . finally , we note that the deprojections suggest that the rings lead the bar by an intrinsic angle @xmath65 , depending upon the adopted inclination angle and bar position angle .    the weakness or absence of radio emission at the locations of near  infrared or visual emission peaks has also been noted in m  82 and in ngc  253 ( sams et al .",
    "1994 ; golla , allen , & kronberg 1996 ; ulvestad & antonucci 1997 ) .",
    "we note that the distribution of the @xmath34 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 colors in ngc  7771 follows that of the @xmath24 band emission , i.e.  the reddest regions are spatially coincident with the @xmath24 band peaks , and not the radio peaks .",
    "in contrast , the reddest @xmath67 colors in ngc  253 and in the starburst ring in ngc  7469 are found at the locations of the 6 cm emission peaks ( sams et al .",
    "1994 ; genzel et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "the redshift  corrected @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 band fluxes of the near  infrared luminous knots identified in figure [ fig : kband ] and the nucleus ( denoted n ) are given in table [ tab : redflux ] .",
    "the 1 @xmath68 uncertainty in the fluxes is typically 8% at @xmath24 , 5% at @xmath23 , and 6% at @xmath22 .",
    "these data indicate that the starburst complexes are extremely active , with fluxes equaling @xmath69% that of the nucleus .",
    "the 6 cm fluxes of the radio  bright knots are quoted in table [ tab : radiofluxes ] .",
    "these fluxes represent lower limits and are not corrected for redshift due to the lack of information concerning the spectral energy distribution of the knots in the radio .",
    "the near  infrared @xmath66 and @xmath34 colors of knots ka  kj and the nucleus are compiled in table [ tab : redflux ] and plotted in figure [ fig : ircolor ] .",
    "these colors are not dependent upon the alignment of the @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 band images since they represent quantities integrated over an aperture size significantly larger than any uncertainties in the image alignment .",
    "the colors range from @xmath70 mag and @xmath71 mag at knot kg to @xmath72 and @xmath73 mag at the nucleus .",
    "as discussed in section [ sec : obs ] , the uncertainty in the @xmath34 color is likely to be overestimated .",
    "the _ relative _ colors of the knots are much better determined than the absolute colors since the quoted uncertainties are determined by the flux calibration , and not by statistical uncertainties .",
    "thus , figure [ fig : ircolor ] indicates that knots kf , kg , and kh are the bluest sources , and knots ka , kb , kc , and ki , along with the nucleus ( n ) , are the reddest sources .    standard `` mixing '' curves for the cit photometric system are also shown in figure [ fig : ircolor ] to illustrate the effects of emission from blue stars , thermal gas , synchrotron emission , and hot dust upon the near  infrared colors of `` normal '' stellar populations ( paper 2 ; paper 3 ; joseph et al .",
    "1984 ; telesco et al .  1991a ; turner et al .",
    "the colors of `` normal '' stellar populations are taken to be @xmath74 and @xmath75 mag , which correspond to the colors of red giants ( turner et al .",
    "1991 ; frogel et al .  1978 ) .",
    "red supergiants , which are important energy sources in starbursts that are @xmath76 myr old , are very similar in color .",
    "the dotted line delineates the region of the color  color diagram that can be reached by existing reddening models ( gordon , calzetti , & witt 1997 ; see also paper 3 ) .",
    "these models employ both galactic and small magellanic cloud ( smc ) extinction laws and consider both homogeneous and clumpy dust distributions .",
    "the reddening vectors for an overlying dust screen , a sphere of uniformly mixed dust and stars , and a dust  free sphere of stars surrounded by a clumpy shell of dust are shown as examples .",
    "figure [ fig : ircolor ] indicates that the colors of many of the knots are redder than those of an unobscured `` normal '' stellar population , and are marginally redder than those of a heavily obscured `` normal '' stellar population .",
    "in the sections below , we discuss the current dataset with the goal of providing _",
    "plausible _ constraints upon the history of star formation in ngc  7771 and encouraging further observations of this system .",
    "we note that the existing dataset for ngc  7771 is not yet comprehensive enough to permit detailed modeling of the star formation history , as performed for ngc  7469 by genzel et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and references therein .",
    "compact radio sources have been detected in several nearby star forming galaxies including m  82 , ngc  253 , ngc  4736 , and ngc  7469 ( kronberg , biermann , & schwab 1985 ; ulvestad & antonucci 1997 , and references therein ; duric & dittmar 1988 ; wilson et al .",
    "the radio emission from m  82 has been interpreted in terms of supernovae remnants surrounded by dense shells ( kronberg et al .",
    "1985 ; golla et al .",
    "approximately half of the sources in ngc  253 and in ngc  4736 are thermal sources associated with  regions ; the remaining sources are non  thermal supernovae remnants ( duric & dittmar 1988 ; ulvestad & antonucci 1997 ) .",

    "the fact that the starburst ring is not detected at 2 cm ( batuski & hanisch , private communication ) does not resolve this issue since the 2 cm fluxes predicted for individual knots assuming either thermal or non  thermal spectral indices ( @xmath77 ) are below the detection limits of batuski et al .",
    "( 1992 ) .    to provide some insight into the relative importance of thermal and non  thermal emission processes in ngc  7771 , we consider the simple case in which the radio emission is optically thin and the spatial variations in the spectral index are not severe .",

    "emission from ngc  7770 accounts for 10% of the total flux ( condon et al .",
    "these data imply that 24.8 mjy ( 46% ) of the global total 6 cm emission from ngc  7771 is thermal emission , assuming that the thermal and non  thermal components of the radio emission are characterized by spectral indices of @xmath79 and @xmath80 , respectively ( e.g.  mas  hesse & kunth 1991 ) .",
    "for comparison , the data obtained by neff & hutchings ( 1992 ) ( figure [ fig : radio ] ) show that the total 6 cm flux associated with the starburst ring , as measured by an outer ellipse characterized by @xmath81 and @xmath82 at @xmath83 and an inner ellipse with @xmath44 and @xmath84 at @xmath85 , is 29.4 mjy .",
    "the flux from the region interior to the inner ellipse , which is dominated by the nucleus , amounts to 4.2 mjy .",
    "the remaining 20.4 mjy of the total 54 mjy associated with ngc  7771 lies outside of the central 2 kpc .",
    "these data are summarized in table [ tab : radcomponents ] .    given that ngc  7771 emits a global thermal flux of 24.8 mjy and that the total thermal @xmath7 non  thermal flux associated with the ring is 29.4 mjy , it is conceivable that all of the thermal emission is produced by the ring .",
    "the h@xmath86 profile in keel ( 1996 ) suggests that some of the thermal emission must reside in the disk of ngc  7771 , however . to provide a plausible constraint upon the emission properties of the central 2 kpc of ngc  7771 , we assume that the emission properties of the disk are similar to those observed in `` normal '' star forming galaxies , in which @xmath87% of the global 6 cm emission is thermal and",
    "the spectral index is @xmath88 ( e.g.  condon 1992 , and references therein ) .",
    "consequently , 4.1 mjy of the 20.4 mjy of 6 cm emission lying outside of the central 2 kpc will be thermal .",
    "this leaves @xmath89 mjy of thermal flux lying within the starburst ring and the nucleus .",
    "that is , 62% of the 6 cm emission associated with the ring and the nucleus is thermal emission .",
    "the implied average spectral index for the ring and the nucleus is @xmath90 . for comparison ,",
    "the disk can produce at most 20.4 mjy of the total thermal flux . the average spectral index for the central 2 kpc would be @xmath91 in the case where the ring and the nucleus produce the remaining 4.4 mjy of thermal flux , as summarized in table [ tab : radcomponents ] .",
    "the average spectral indices can be compared to those illustrated by mas ",
    "hesse & kunth ( 1991 ) , hereafter mhk91 , ( their figure 17 ) and tabulated by cervio & mas  hesse ( 1994 ) , hereafter cmh94 .",
    "these authors model several starburst parameters for the cases of an instantaneous burst of star formation ( isb ) and a burst with a constant star formation rate ( csfr ) .",
    "we adopt the cmh94 models since they track the time evolution of a larger number of radio parameters than other models in the literature ( e.g.  bruzual & charlot 1993 ; leitherer & heckman 1995 , and references therein ) .",
    "the cmh94 models referred to in the remainder of this paper employ a salpeter initial mass function ( imf ) with lower and upper mass cutoffs of 2 @xmath92 and 120 @xmath92 , respectively , and are for solar metallicity .",
    "the reader is referred to cmh94 for additional data from models utilizing different imf slopes and metallicities .",
    "illustrations for earlier versions of the model may be found in mhk91 .",
    "we emphasize that the case of a salpeter imf with solar metallicity is chosen solely to illustrate the _ general _ behavior of a starburst .",
    "the exact details of the time evolution of the starburst occurring in ngc  7771 may differ from that discussed here , depending upon the exact form of the imf and the metallicity .",
    "the cmh94 models indicate that a spectral index of @xmath93 is matched by a 4 to 5 myr old instantaneous burst . a value of @xmath91 , which is similar to that of the starburst ring in ngc  7469 ( wilson et al .",
    "1991 ) , corresponds to an 8 myr old instantaneous burst .",
    "a constant star formation rate appears to be inconsistent with the data since the cmh94 models indicate that the maximum value reached in the csfr model considered here is @xmath94 .",
    "the radio data thus indicate that the activity occurring in the central 2 kpc of ngc  7771 can be explained in terms of an instantaneous burst of star formation which occurred 4 to 8 myr ago , assuming that the observed radio emission is optically thin .",

    "the angular velocity of the bar pattern , @xmath187 , is identified by assuming that corotation occurs at the eastern end of the large scale bar observed in the optical and near  infrared ( @xmath197 ) ( benedict , smith , & kenney 1996 ) . placing corotation at a radius equal to 1.2 times the bar radius ( devereux et al .",
    "1992 , and references therein ) would not affect our analysis since @xmath189 is fairly constant in the region @xmath198 . with a corotation radius of @xmath199 , the large scale bar has an angular velocity of @xmath200 km s@xmath6 arcsec@xmath6 , or 23 km s@xmath6 kpc@xmath6 .",
    "figure [ fig : omega ] shows that the value of @xmath201 is approximately zero over a large range of radii , as expected for solid body rotation .",

    "thus , the only apparent ilr lies _ exterior _ to the nuclear starburst ring .    as discussed previously ,",
    "the variations in the @xmath38 morphology of ngc  7771 indicate that the central 2 kpc of ngc  7771 is heavily obscured and that the western portion of the ring may be more heavily obscured than the southeastern portion .",
    "consequently , the asymmetric behavior of the eastern and western portions of the h@xmath86 rotation curve and the absence of a western ilr could result from differential extinction .",
    "strong extinction will result in a slowly rising rotation curve , as seen in the western arm of ngc  7771 .",
    "the models of bosma et al .",
    "( 1992 ) suggest that the amount of obscuration thought to be present in ngc  7771 ( @xmath203 mag ) should not have a strong effect upon the observed rotation curve , however .",
    "furthermore , the fact that the ilr observed in the eastern arm of ngc  7771 lies exterior to the nuclear ring is not easily explained by extinction effects , unless the eastern portion of the ring is completely obscured in the visible .",
    "these difficulties may indicate that our measurement of the extinction is too low or that differential extinction is not responsible for the odd behavior of the h@xmath86 rotation curve .",
    "high resolution imaging of the h@xmath86 emission and/or a rotation curve obtained at longer wavelengths would help resolve this issue .",
    "the rotation curve may also be influenced by the interaction between ngc  7771 and other members of the ngc  7771 group and/or small  scale non  circular motions .",
    "distortions in the optical morphology of ngc  7771 are visible in figure [ fig : ipic ] and have been noted by several authors ( sections [ sec : intro ] and [ sec : morph ] ) .",
    "ellipse fitting shows a clear difference in the position angles of the inner and outer disks ( section [ sec : morph ] ) .",
    "therefore , the skewed rotation curve may also indicate that the observations were obtained at a location slightly offset from the kinematic major axis .",
    "this hypothesis can not be confirmed since the available optical and  data do not precisely determine the position angle of the kinematic major axis .",
    "the apparent discrepancy between the location of the observed ilr and the location of the ring may also reflect the presence of a strong bulge .",
    "a bulge / disk decomposition of the @xmath11 band data does not provide a meaningful test of this hypothesis due to the heavy extinction and the distorted morphology .",
    "finally , buta & crocker ( 1993 ) and friedly & martinet ( 1997 ) have pointed out that nuclear rings are also present in galaxies containing both a primary bar and a small  scale nuclear bar . in this case , the corotation radius of the nuclear bar is located near the ilr of the primary bar , and the ring forms near the corotation radius of the nuclear bar .",
    "the morphology of the circumnuclear feature may resemble hot  spots , a mini ",

    "the @xmath24 band data shown in figure [ fig : kband ] are suggestive , but not conclusive .",
    "a weak , small  scale nuclear bar could run from either knots kc to ki of from ke to kj .",
    "the presence of a nuclear bar will be difficult to confirm or rule out due to ngc  7771 s high inclination .",
    "higher resolution @xmath24 band imagery may be able to provide stronger evidence supporting or refuting the existence of a stellar nuclear bar .",
    "high resolution maps of the @xmath204 and/or co emission may be able to identify a gaseous nuclear bar .",
    "the absence of a nuclear bar would not be surprising , however .",

    "the current data provides only weak evidence linking the origin of the nuclear ring to a resonance .",
    "additional high resolution imaging and spectroscopy at both optical and longer wavelengths would clarify several of the issues discussed above .",
    "finally , we note that co maps have recently led to the identification of gaseous rings ranging from 0.6 kpc to 1.6 kpc in diameter in three ultraluminous merging galaxies downes & solomon ( 1998 ) . if nuclear rings also form during mergers and interactions , the nuclear ring in ngc  7771 may be associated with interaction activity instead of an ilr .",
    "as discussed in section [ sec : morph ] , the peaks of the near  infrared and the 6 cm emission in the starburst ring are not spatially coincident .",
    "this fact , when coupled with the modeled behavior of a starburst and our estimated ages of the radio and near  infrared bright knots , suggests that the radio and the near  infrared observations are tracing multiple generations of star formation .",
    "the model behavior of the 2 @xmath20 m and the total ( thermal @xmath7 non  thermal ) 6 cm luminosities as a function of time , normalized by the total mass of stars formed since the beginning of the burst , is illustrated by mhk91 ( their figures 8a and 16 ) and tabulated by cmh94 .",
    "evolution of the @xmath24 band luminosity is discussed in section [ sec : continuum ] .",
    "the total 6 cm emission from an instantaneous burst rapidly decreases over the first 10 myr and then levels off as the emission becomes predominantly non  thermal . in the case of constant star formation",

    "the ratio @xmath208 increases rapidly as red supergiants appear .",
    "the value of @xmath208 begins to slowly decrease when the burst is @xmath1 myr old , as the red supergiants begin to die .",
    "evolution of the near  infrared and radio luminosities suggests that the reason that the near  infrared bright knots are radio  dim ( and have a higher value of @xmath208 ) , and vice  versa , is that the radio  luminous knots are not the same age as the near  infrared luminous knots .",
    "this hypothesis is consistent with the ages of the knots , as estimated from the spectral index of the radio emission and the co index ( 4 to 8 myr old for the radio knots , and @xmath76 myr old for the near  infrared knots ) . while we can not conclusively rule out the possibility that radio  bright knots are older than the near  infrared  bright knots",
    ", the current data and models do suggest that the radio  luminous knots are likely to be younger than the near  infrared  luminous knots .",
    "multiple generations of star formation are also observed in the southern ringed galaxy eso @xmath205 ( buta , purcell , & crocker 1995 , hereafter bpc95 ) .",
    "different conclusions have been reached in the cases of ngc  253 , ngc  7469 , and m  82 , however . in ngc  253 ,",
    "the reddest @xmath67 colors are correlated with the radio peaks .",
    "the radio peaks are interpreted as obscured  regions ; the near  infrared `` peaks '' are simply holes in the extinction ( sams et al .",
    "the emission from one of the near  infrared sources has also been discussed in terms of a dust  enshrouded supernovae remnant which has not yet broken out of its optically thick molecular cloud ( kalas & wynn  williams 1994 ) .",
    "ulvestad & antonucci ( 1997 ) point out that the lack of thermal radio emission from the brightest optical cluster in ngc  253 could indicate that the free  free emission is absorbed by molecular clouds , or that supernovae winds have cleared the region of thermal gas . in ngc  7469 , the anticorrelation of the @xmath22 band emission peaks and the 6 cm peaks , as well as the clumpiness of the @xmath22 band emission",
    ", are again attributed to the distribution of gas and dust ( genzel et al .",
    "their interpretation is supported by the correlation of the reddest @xmath67 colors and the non  thermal radio emission . in m  82 ,",
    "several non  thermal radio sources lie behind the central dust lane , and optically bright super star clusters ( sscs ) lack radio emission ( golla et al .",
    "these authors suggest that the relative radio and optical morphologies indicate that a large number of massive stars and sscs are obscured by the central dust lane .",
    "the lack of radio emission associated with the optical sscs may also reflect a lower density in the interstellar medium ( ism ) surrounding the sscs .",
    "these discussions indicate that a dimness or a lack of radio emission at the locations of near  infrared emission peaks can be explained by scenarios other than age variations : 1 ) the near  infrared peaks may represent holes in the extinction and are not real peaks , 2 ) the near  infrared sources may be young , dust  enshrouded supernovae , and 3 ) the near  infrared knots may represent areas where the density of the ism is low .",
    "the first of these explanations is generally invoked when the reddest @xmath67 colors correspond to the peaks of the 6 cm emission .",
    "this is not the case in ngc  7771 ; the reddest colors are spatially coincident with the 2 @xmath20 m peaks . furthermore , the emission becomes clumpier as the observed wavelength changes from 1.25 to 2.2 @xmath20 m .",
    "this behavior suggests that we are seeing further into the galaxy at 2.2 @xmath20 m and uncovering the true morphology of the near  infrared emitting sources .",
    "the second explanation , based upon the work of kalas & wynn  williams ( 1994 ) , requires that the energy associated with the supernova be absorbed and re  radiated in the infrared .",
    "the near  infrared properties of dust  enshrouded supernovae should therefore be consistent with thermal dust emission .",
    "in contrast , the near  infrared colors of the knots in ngc  7771 are consistent with stellar emission , with only small contributions from thermal dust emission .",
    "finally , the third explanation appears to be ruled out in the case of ngc  7771 since the fact that the reddest near ",
    "infrared colors are associated with the 2 @xmath20 m sources suggests that these regions are heavily obscured , i.e.  that large amounts of gas and dust ( and high ism densities ) are likely to be present .",
    "we conclude that the differences between the spatial distribution of the radio and the near  infrared emission most likely reflect the presence of two different epochs of star formation and not the effects of extinction or variations in the ism density .",
    "the physical reason for the spatial displacement between the current and the previous generations of star formation may be due to the rotation of the ring , propagating star formation , or another physical process . for example , the phase shift between the major axes of the young and the old rings in eso @xmath205 has been interpreted in terms of the effects of gravitational torques upon a highly oblate ( @xmath210 ) ring ( bpc95 , and references therein ) . finally , effects from a secondary nuclear bar ( if one exists ) or the interaction between ngc  7771 and other members within the group may also be important .",
    "the uncertainties in the intrinsic structure of ngc  7771 , the origin of the ring , and the lack of kinematic data do not allow us to further constrain the cause of the spatial displacement between the current and previous generations of star formation .",
    "for example , the possible effects of gravitational torques are difficult to assess since the intrinsic ring shapes are not easily deduced in such a highly inclined and disturbed system . the fact that the _ intrinsic _ major axes of the @xmath24 band and the 6 cm rings appear to be in alignment to within @xmath64 suggests that the orientations of the rings are not strongly affected by gravitational torques at this time .",
    "this scenario is consistent with the rounder intrinsic axis ratios derived for inclinations of @xmath211 since gravitational torques will have little effect on nearly circular rings .",
    "if the rings are instead very oblate , the alignment may imply that gravitational torques have not had enough time to significantly displace the @xmath24 band ring , whose age is @xmath212 10 myr ( section [ sec : taucont ] ) .    in summary ,",
    "the data indicate that radio and near  infrared wavelengths are tracing multiple generations of star formation in ngc  7771 .",
    "the spatial displacements between the current and the previous sites of star formation are probably due to the rotation of the ring , regardless of its origin , and/or propagating star formation .",
    "other factors such as gravitational torques may also be important .",
    "we conclude that the spatial distribution of the radio and near  infrared emission most likely traces _ sequential star formation _ associated with a rotating ring or propagating star formation .",
    "the presence of circumnuclear starburst rings in galaxies with and without a seyfert nucleus raises the question : what is the relationship , if any , between circumnuclear rings and agn ?",
    "the means by which an agn is fueled and triggered remains one of the fundamental questions in astronomy . in order to channel large amounts of gas from the outer portions of a galaxy into the small nuclear region hosting the agn ,",
    "large amounts of angular momentum must be removed from the gas .",

    "we speculate that the near  infrared morphologies of the rings in ngc  7771 and ngc  7469 may provide a clue regarding the relationship between bars , circumnuclear rings , and agn .",
    "the circumnuclear rings in these galaxies are likely to be associated with ilrs , and may be linked to small  scale nuclear bars ( genzel et al .  1995 ;",

    "the rings in ngc  7771 and ngc  7469 are also similar in that they both contain compact regions of intense star formation , with tens of thousands of stars contained within areas @xmath213 parsecs in diameter ( genzel et al .",

    ".    the perceived difference in the clumpiness of the @xmath24 band emission could be the result of the ages and the sizes of the clusters formed in the rings . while star formation generally occurs in a hierarchical system of associations and clusters ( e.g.  elmegreen 1997 ) , the period of time over which a system will retain a non  diffuse morphology depends upon the mass and size distribution of the clusters .",
    "an unbound cluster of mass @xmath214 , radius @xmath215 , and velocity dispersion @xmath216 km s@xmath6 will disperse in a time of @xmath217 years .",
    "for example , an unbound cluster of mass @xmath4 and radius 100 pc will dissolve by an age of @xmath139 myr . the ten near  infrared  bright knots in ngc  7771 appear to be gravitationally bound since they remain distinct sources at an age of @xmath1 myr .",
    "the @xmath24 band morphology of ngc  7469 may have a smoother appearance because some of the clusters in its ring may be diffusing , due to either the age of the system , differences in the mass or spatial extent of some of the clusters , or differences in the gravitational potential .",
    "the dispersion ( or disruption ) of the clusters may be related to the existence of the agn in one of the following manners .",
    "first , the presence of a diffuse component may indicate that the potential associated with a secondary stellar bar is disrupting some of the clusters and funneling material into the central regions of the galaxy .",
    "this may happen only at certain times in the history of a galaxy ; friedli & martinet ( 1997 ) indicate that the morphology of a ring in a system with nested bars may be related to the relative phase of the bars and that the secondary bar is a transient feature",
    ". the link may also be more indirect , with the dispersion of clusters simply indicating that the system is old enough to have established a mechanism to fuel a central agn .",
    "friedli & martinet ( 1997 ) also note that gas will not reach the nuclei of ringed systems characterized by very high star formation efficiencies .",
    "we postulate that some galaxies may only form very massive , compact , gravitationally bound clusters .",
    "these systems may not be able to host an agn because the material which would fuel an agn is locked up in the circumnuclear star forming regions .",
    "consequently , the facts that ngc  7771 possesses a clumpier ring than ngc  7469 and does not contain an agn may indicate that ngc  7771 is not old enough to have formed an agn or that ngc  7771 may not be able to fuel an agn .",

    "<S> only two of the twenty highly luminous starburst galaxies analyzed by smith et al .  </S>",

    "<S> these galaxies provide a link between @xmath0 luminosity class systems and classical , less  luminous ringed systems . in this paper , we report the discovery of a near  infrared counterpart to the 1.6 kpc diameter nuclear ring of radio emission in ngc  7771 ( ugc  12815 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the ring contains @xmath1 radio bright clumps and @xmath1 near  infrared bright clumps . a displacement between the peaks of the radio and the near  infrared emission indicates the presence of multiple generations of star formation . </S>",
    "<S> the estimated thermal emission from each radio source is equivalent to that of @xmath2 o6 stars . </S>",
    "<S> each near  infrared bright knot contains @xmath3 red supergiants , on average . in the case </S>",
    "<S> that the radio  bright knots are 4 myr old and the near  infrared bright knots are @xmath1 myr old , each knot is characterized by a stellar mass of @xmath4 , and the implied time  averaged star formation rate is @xmath5 yr@xmath6 . several similarities are found between the properties of this system and other ringed and non  ringed starbursts . </S>",
    "<S> morphological differences between ngc  7771 and the starburst @xmath7 seyfert 1 galaxy ngc  7469 ( ugc  12332 ) suggest that ngc  7771 may not be old enough to fuel an agn , or may not be capable of fueling an agn . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , the differences may be unrelated to the presence or absence of an agn and may simply reflect the possibility that star formation in rings is episodic . </S>"
