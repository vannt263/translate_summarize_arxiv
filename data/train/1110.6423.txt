    "the hexagonal , non - centrosymmetric , zr@xmath0fe@xmath1p@xmath2-type crystal structure ( space group p@xmath6 )  @xcite is exhibited by a large number of compounds with the chemical formula @xmath7 ( @xmath8 = li , na , ca , mg , ti - hf , nb , sc , y , la - lu ; @xmath9 = mn , fe , co , ni , ru ; and @xmath10 = p , as )  @xcite . signatures of strong electronic correlations have been found in certain members of this family of compounds for which the @xmath8 ion is a rare earth element with an unstable valence .",
    "electrical resistivity , magnetic susceptibility , and specific heat measurements on yb@xmath0ni@xmath1(p , as)@xmath2 show evidence of an yb valence between 2.2 and 2.8 and a moderately enhanced electronic contribution to the specific heat , @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "x - ray absorption measurements on ce@xmath0ni@xmath1p@xmath2 indicate a cerium valence of 3.2  @xcite .",
    "yb@xmath0fe@xmath1p@xmath2 exhibits an enhanced @xmath11 and , under the application of magnetic field @xmath12 , exhibits a crossover from a magnetically ordered non - fermi - liquid ( nfl ) phase at low @xmath12 to another nfl phase at higher @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "sm@xmath0fe@xmath1p@xmath2 appears to be a rare example of a sm - based , heavy - fermion ferromagnet  @xcite .",
    "one of the notable characteristics of this class of compounds is that the transition metal sub - lattice can be tuned from non - magnetic ( @xmath9 = fe or ni ) to magnetic ( @xmath9 = co )  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath9 = co compounds exhibit ferromagnetic ordering of the cobalt ions where the curie temperature @xmath13 is usually @xmath14 k  @xcite .",
    "additional magnetic transitions are found at lower temperatures for the cobalt - phosphide compounds that incorporate a trivalent , magnetic , rare - earth element as the @xmath8 ion .",
    "a detailed magnetization and neutron diffraction study of the @xmath15co@xmath1p@xmath2 compounds with @xmath8 = pr , nd , and ho showed that the lower temperature transitions are due to ferromagnetic ordering of the rare earth ions  @xcite .",
    "the co moments align parallel to the crystal hexagonal axis near 150 k , while the rare earth moments for the pr , nd , and ho compounds align nearly perpendicular , anti - parallel , and parallel to the co moments , respectively .",
    "given the interesting behavior observed in the other yb - based members of this family of compounds , yb@xmath0ni@xmath1(p , as)@xmath2  @xcite and yb@xmath0fe@xmath1p@xmath2  @xcite , we undertook a study of the low temperature properties of yb@xmath0co@xmath1p@xmath2 .",
    "polycrystalline samples of yb@xmath0co@xmath1p@xmath2  were prepared from elemental yb ( small dendritic pieces ) , co ( powder ) , and p ( small lumps ) .",
    "the starting materials were sealed under vacuum in quartz tubes , slowly heated to 1000 @xmath16c , and held at this temperature for 3 days .",
    "after the initial reaction the sample was ground to a powder , pressed into a pellet , and fired at 1135 @xmath16c for 3 days . finally , the sample was again re - ground and fired at 1135 @xmath16c for 3 days .",
    "powder x - ray diffraction measurements were performed using a bruker d8 discover system utilizing cuk@xmath17 radiation .",
    "magnetization and specific heat measurements were performed from room temperature down to @xmath18 k in quantum design mpms and ppms systems , respectively . for electrical resistivity measurements ,",
    "the samples were cut into bars and four gold leads were attached using epotek silver epoxy .",
    "the resistivity was measured down to @xmath19 k in a home - built @xmath20he system , while temperatures down to @xmath21 mk were achieved in an oxford instruments kelvinox @xmath22he-@xmath20he dilution refrigerator . at the lowest temperatures",
    ", the electrical resistivity measurements were repeated using several different excitation currents in order to ensure that there was no spurious heating of the sample .",
    "analysis of the x - ray diffraction measurements confirms the zr@xmath0fe@xmath1p@xmath2-type crystal structure with lattice constants @xmath23  and @xmath24  , nearly identical to those reported earlier  @xcite .",
    "initial x - ray results pointed to contamination by a single impurity phase of a few percent yb@xmath0o@xmath25 .",
    "however , we found that the yb@xmath0o@xmath25 phase developed when , in preparation for the powder diffraction measurements , the sample was ground in air . by performing the grinding and x - ray measurements under inert atmosphere",
    ", the yb@xmath0o@xmath25 phase could be greatly reduced , indicating that the as - grown samples are nearly phase pure .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig1 ] presents the results of field - cooled magnetization versus temperature measurements .",
    "the onset of ferromagnetic order is clearly visible near @xmath26 k. an additional magnetic transition appears near @xmath4 k. in an applied field of 10 oe , this transition is manifested as a drop in the susceptibility ( see inset of figure  [ fig : fig1 ] ) , suggesting antiferromagnetic ordering .",
    "however , when the measurement is performed in 1000 oe , the susceptibility instead increases below @xmath5 , more consistent with field - induced ferromagnetic ordering .",
    "the differences between the 10 oe and 1000 oe susceptibility curves raise the possibility of a metamagnetic transition under applied field .",
    "an analysis of the inverse susceptibility in terms of a curie - weiss law is complicated by the fact that yb@xmath0co@xmath1p@xmath2  has two species of magnetic ions with different moments and different ordering temperatures .",
    "the susceptibility can then be modeled as @xmath27 where the curie - weiss temperatures are @xmath28 and @xmath29 and the effective moments are given by @xmath30 and @xmath31 . allowing all four parameters to vary while fitting the data above 140 k results in unrealistic values of the effective moments .",
    "instead , we fit the curie - weiss temperatures while fixing @xmath32 @xmath33 at the hund s rule value for yb@xmath34 and @xmath35 @xmath33 at the value estimated from earlier studies of lu@xmath0co@xmath1p@xmath2  @xcite .",
    "this yields @xmath36 k and @xmath37 k and the resulting curve is plotted in the upper inset to figure  [ fig : fig1 ] . while the exact value of @xmath28 depends somewhat on the value selected for the corresponding effective moment , any reasonable estimate of @xmath38 yields a negative curie - weiss temperature that is sizable compared to the observed ordering temperature @xmath4 k , suggesting the possibility of frustrated magnetism .",
    "alternatively , crystal field effects , valence fluctuations , or kondo physics could be responsible for this behavior .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig2 ] shows the results of isothermal magnetization @xmath8 versus magnetic field @xmath12 scans .",
    "the curves below @xmath13 can be broken into two components , one of which saturates in relatively small fields of 1000 oe and another part which remains unsaturated by 5 tesla .",
    "this may be attributed to the fact that the applied field is not parallel to the easy axis for every crystallite in the polycrystalline sample  @xcite , precluding a straightforward determination of the exact magnitude of the ordered moments from the present magnetization data . however , by noting that the 2 k and 15 k magnetization curves differ only by a constant at higher fields , it is clear that the magnetic component due to the transition at @xmath4 k saturates by a few thousand oe . moreover ,",
    "the field dependence of this component is reversible since the residual magnetization upon reducing the field to zero above or below @xmath5 are nearly identical ( see figure  [ fig : fig2]b ) .    .",
    "]    specific heat @xmath39 divided by temperature @xmath9 data in magnetic fields from 0 - 9 tesla are plotted in figure  [ fig : fig3 ] .",
    "an anomaly due to ferromagnetic ordering of the cobalt ions is visible at @xmath40 ( figure  [ fig : fig3]c ) .",
    "application of a magnetic field smears out this transition , as may be expected for a ferromagnetic transition . at lower temperatures , a second anomaly appears as a broad maximum ( figure  [ fig : fig3]b ) . in zero magnetic field ,",
    "the ordering temperature as determined by the inflection point in the @xmath41 curve is @xmath42 k , in good agreement with that determined from magnetic susceptibility .",
    "the low temperature anomaly broadens and shifts to higher temperatures with the application of magnetic field , again suggestive of ferromagnetism .",
    "these measurements also rule out any significant contamination by yb@xmath0o@xmath25 which is known to exhibit a large , sharp specific heat anomaly near 2.5 k  @xcite .",
    "no sign of such a transition is apparent in the present data .",
    "the specific heat well below the debye temperature @xmath43 can be described by @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the magnetic contribution , @xmath11 is electronic specific heat coefficient and @xmath46 gives the lattice contribution from the lowest order term of the debye function .",
    "the values of @xmath46 and @xmath11 can be obtained from the slope and intercept , respectively of a linear fit to a plot @xmath41 versus @xmath47 at low temperatures ( but above the magnetic anomaly ) .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ fig : fig3]d and results in @xmath48 mj / mol - yb - k@xmath20 and a moderately enhanced electronic contribution @xmath49 mj / mol - yb - k@xmath50 .",
    "specific heat measurements on hf@xmath0co@xmath1p@xmath2 indicate an electronic contribution that may be as large as @xmath51 mj / mol - hf - k@xmath50  @xcite .",
    "this suggests that a substantial portion of @xmath11 in yb@xmath0co@xmath1p@xmath2  may derive from a large density of states at the fermi level associated with the co @xmath52-electrons rather than from hybridized yb @xmath53-electron states .",
    "divided by temperature @xmath9 versus @xmath9 measured in magnetic fields from 0 - 9 tesla .",

    "an increase in @xmath45 begins already below @xmath62 k , nearly three times higher that the ordering temperature as determined from magnetization and electrical resistivity .",
    "this may indicate that short range magnetic correlations develop well above @xmath5 .",
    "the line connecting to the origin indicates a rough extrapolation of @xmath45 to lower temperatures for the purpose of estimating the entropy . integrating @xmath63 yields the magnetic entropy ( figure  [ fig : fig3]e ) , which saturates at 90% of r@xmath64 per yb ion by @xmath65 k. this is consistent with the magnetic transition at @xmath5 involving ordering of yb@xmath34 ions in a kramers doublet ground state .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig4 ] shows the electrical resistivity versus temperature . at the highest temperatures the electrical resistivity is roughly linear , as is typical for a normal metal .",
    "a kink appears in the electrical resistivity at 135.6 k , nearly the same temperature identified as the curie temperature from the the magnetization and specific heat measurements . below the curie temperature",
    "the slope increases significantly and displays negative curvature down to @xmath66 k. this negative curvature may be due to either @xmath67-@xmath52 scattering as described by mott and jones  @xcite or crystalline electric field ( cef ) effects .",
    "the latter possibility is particularly likely given the entropy , which is consistent with cef effects splitting the hund s rule multiplet to yield a doublet ground state .",
    "another possibility is that the negative curvature results from the onset of coherent scattering processes from hybridized yb ions .",
    "based on this assumption , the shoulder in the resistivity at @xmath60 k would provide a rough estimate of the kondo coherence temperature .",
    "a similar shoulder was also found at @xmath68 k in yb@xmath0fe@xmath1p@xmath2  @xcite .",

    "( upper inset ) resistivity at low temperature .",

    "the best fit is obtained with @xmath70 ( black line ) although the data can also be reasonably well fit with @xmath71 ( dashed red line ) . ]",
    "the upper left inset of figure  [ fig : fig4 ] highlights the drop in the resistivity that occurs below @xmath4 k. below the transition , the electrical resistivity is consistent with power law behavior , @xmath72 .",
    "the value of @xmath73 can be determined from the slope of a plot of @xmath74 versus @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is selected to maximize the range of linear behavior extending from low temperature .",
    "the best fit to the data is obtained for @xmath77 , with the power law behavior extending up to roughly 3 k , as illustrated in the lower inset to figure  [ fig : fig4 ] .",
    "the data can also be fit over a somewhat smaller temperature range with an @xmath78 power law .",
    "a @xmath47 temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity could be explained either by ferromagnetic magnon scattering or by fermi liquid behavior , as is found for many heavy fermion materials . to help distinguish between these possibilities",
    ", we consider the kadowaki - woods ratio @xmath79 , which gives a measure of the relationship between the coefficient of electronic specific heat @xmath11 and the coefficient @xmath80 of the @xmath47 contribution to the electrical resistivity  @xcite . for many yb - based heavy fermion compounds",

    ", we find @xmath83 @xmath82cm / k@xmath50 and @xmath49 mj / mol - yb - k@xmath50 , resulting in a value @xmath84 @xmath82cm(mol - yb - k / mj)@xmath50 . because this value is much larger than that typically found for yb - based heavy fermion compounds , we conclude that the low temperature electrical resistivity is likely dominated by magnetic scattering rather than heavy fermi liquid behavior .",
