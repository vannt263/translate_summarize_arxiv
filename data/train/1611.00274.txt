    "the term `` mental imagery '' describes the process of activating sensory and/or motor representations within the cognitive system of an agent without actual sensory inflow and without actually executing motor actions .",
    "introspective experience suggests that humans are able to generate mental images , and neuroimaging studies have shown that these mental images have neural correlates in the corresponding cortical areas which are usually involved in visual and motor processing @xcite .",
    "one commonly accepted function of mental imagery is the mental practice of movement tasks , e.g. in sports @xcite or rehabilitation @xcite .",
    "we suggest that mental imagery  at the subconscious level  could be the basis for the detection of affordances @xcite in visual perception .",
    "affordances are the behavior  related properties of entities in an agent s environment ; for example , surfaces can be `` stand - on - able '' , `` climb - on - able '' , or `` sit - on - able '' .",
    "accordings to gibson @xcite , visual perception means to directly perceive these behavioral meanings by picking up certain `` invariants '' from the visual information , and through active exploration of the environment without preceding object recognition .",
    "quite the contrary , the object is `` recognized '' by its affordances .",
    "our approach closely follows these lines of thought , however , the active exploration of the environment is replaced by an internal simulation of movement sequences in which mental images of sensory states and motor commands are generated : the sensory outcome in these simulated sequences is evaluated to guide the simulation process , and a final set of movement sequences serves to determine the behavioral meaning . in the end",
    ", object recognition is based _ on the internally generated motor commands _ ( and optionally on the evaluation of the predicted sensory states ) and not on sensory features ( even though low  level features may be used in the simulation ) .",
    "this approach has been termed `` perception through anticipation '' ( pta ) in previous publications ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it replaces the rather vague statements of gibson s theory on how affordances are detected by a clearly described computional mechanism .    during the last decade",
    "several `` simulation theories '' were proposed in cognitive science ( and related areas ) which basically state that simulation is an important foundation for perception and higher  level cognition @xcite .",
    "for example , @xcite argued that thinking consists of a simulated interaction with the environment , and @xcite suggested the `` emulation theory of representation '' which links imagery and perception to motor simulation ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "@xcite analyzed the necessary and sufficient requirements for cognitive architectures which are based on internal simulation : such systems have to be capable of holding covert motor states and internally generated sensory states ( i.e. , mental imagery ) , they have to be able to predict future sensory states , and they require goals and mechanisms for the evaluation of sensory states and for action selection ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in consequence",
    ", the whole simulation approach rests on the assumption that the human cognitive system fulfills these preconditions , and any computational model from this area has to meet these requirements .",
    "this is the case for the pta approach .",
    "furthermore , current neurophysiological and psychological studies and computational models provide converging evidence that the brain is actually an ubiquitous predictor of future states @xcite .    in the present study , a robotic agent , a mobile robot with omnidirectional camera ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_pio ] ) , learns to distinguish between two types of obstacle arrangements : dead ends and corridors .",
    "one example for a dead end and one for a corridor are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_compare ] .",
    "it is important to note that the obstacle arrangement as a whole is interpreted here as one single entity whose behavioral meaning has to be uncovered , while each obstacle on its own serves only as a low  level feature .",
    "the behavioral meanings would be `` pass  through  able '' for a corridor and `` non  pass  through  able '' for a dead end",
    ". another important feature of the presented cognitive architecture ( beyond internal simulation and mental imagery ) is the decomposition into sub ",
    "models which are aquired through sensorimotor learning in a hierarchical way : visual and tactile `` forward models '' for the prediction of sensory states and an `` inverse model '' for the generation of motor commands .    linking perception to sensorimotor simulation has two additional interesting implications @xcite : first , the observer s body size and behavior determine what is perceived in which way .",
    "for example , distance is not understood as a metrical measurement but as movement effort @xcite . in the context of dead end recognition",
    ", a dead end is defined as an arrangement of obstacles that can not be passed through @xcite .",
    "this definition implies that it depends on the size of the observer s body what is perceived as dead end and what as corridor .",
    "and second , sensorimotor simulation allows for viewpoint invariance : a dead end is recognized by its behavioral meaning and independent from the observer s perspective @xcite .",
    "related studies on the detection of affordances have been carried out by various research groups on mobile robots and with robot arm setups ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "iterative sensory anticipation on ( simulated ) robots has been studied among others by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the studies by @xcite and @xcite are especially close to our own work : @xcite trained a robotic agent to predict the optical flow caused by self  motion , and by this predictive ability the system could generate collision - free movement sequences .",
    "the mobile robot system developed by @xcite could even predict how the whole image of an obstacle arrangement would look like after a movement ( although these images were of rather small size ) .",
    "based on this ability , dead ends and corridors were distinguished by internal simulation .",
    "our own work goes beyond these approaches by using more complex scenarios , a hierarchical learning approach , and by putting a strong emphasis on the question of how to generate movement sequences during internal simulation in an effective way .",
    "our cognitive architecture has already been tested in a pure simulation study @xcite .",
    "the achievement of the present work is to demonstrate that dead end recognition in the real world with a real robot setup can be successfully implemented based on the same principles , enhancing the validity of the overall approach .",
    "furthermore , we extend our previous work by a more thorough experimental analysis in which we consider , for example , different types of inverse models .    the remainder of this article is organized as follows : in sect .",

    "[ fig_invcompare ] illustrates the output of the different types of ims from a bird s eye perspective for one dead end and three corridors .",
    "admittedly , these examples were purposefully picked by the authors , but they show nevertheless the different characteristics of the generated movement sequences .",
    "im  random produces many different sequences within a simulation run which cover a wide area .",
    "nevertheless , rather obvious exits as in the second row of images are missed .",
    "in contrast , im  det produces gently curved movement sequences , and sometimes even a single one suffices to find the passage through a corridor .",
    "the characteristics of im  prob are in between . in the third row",
    "it does not identify the passage despite many attempts , most likely because the probability of a right turn is far too low at the crucial position within the arrangement . here",
    ", the random injection of three subsequent right rotations by the partial strategy helps im  det to find the exit very quickly ( of course , this is a lucky incident in this case ) .",
    "within its practical and technical limits , the proposed architecture enables the robotic agent to successfully recognize the behavioral meaning of obstacle arrangements as either dead ends or corridors .",
    "this is a non ",
    "trivial task , as fig .",
    "[ fig_compare ] illustrates : for an outside observer , the difference between dead end and corridor is obvious ( images in first row ) ; however , from the robot s perspective ( images in second and third row ) this distinction is not obvious at all .",
    "the crucial step for the solution of this recognition problem is the transformation of the _ sensory _ task into a _",
    "task by internal simulation based on mental imagery .",
    "it is remarkable that during this transition a proximal sense ( touch ) starts to serve as basis for the interpretation of the data from a distal sense ( vision ) .",
    "the internal simulation is a `` projection '' from the distal visual sense onto the proximal tactile sense and onto motor commands and from there onto the assessment signals ( `` collisions are bad '' ) , and this projection is what ultimately provides behavioral meaning to the visual image .    the hierarchical approach  learning prediction by the forward models first , learning motor control by the inverse model afterwards  is a very important aspect of the architecture .",
    "the way in which the inverse model is acquired can partly be characterized as mental training in which the mental images are produced by the already trained forward model .",
    "the general principle `` prediction before control '' is consistent with results from psychological experiments ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the final internal simulation for affordance detection",
    ", the inverse model plays an important role to guide the generation of movement sequences .",
    "thus , the motor competence of the agent is an important prerequisite for its perceptual competence ( see * ? ? ? * for corresponding results from psychology ) .",
    "the study in this paper builds upon our previous work @xcite in which we developed the cognitive architecture and tested it in a pure simulation study . in @xcite",
    ", we already discussed the basic design decisions and insights for cognitive science in  depth .",
    "we wo nt repeat this here with the same comprehensiveness , instead we will focus on the differences and on the insights from the new experiments .",
    "first of all , the transfer to a real  world setup is a considerable step forward on our way from a `` computerized thought experiment '' to real applications of the `` perception through anticipation '' ( pta ) approach . working with real  world data",
    "poses some additional challenges , in our case especially noise and uncertainties in the feature detection process .",
    "as stated earlier , each single obstacle is interpreted as a feature of the whole obstacle arrangement . in the sensory domain",
    ", these features appear as segments with specific properties like width and position .",
    "however , because of noisy image data and partial occlusions these parameters are sometimes wrongly registered .",
    "errors like this can even change the behavioral meaning of the whole obstacle arrangement ( i.e. , a dead end becomes a corridor and vice versa ) .",
    "for this reason , we had to introduce an additional correction step in the feature acquisition process which is based on the overall distribution statistics of the parameters .",
    "this correction is not perfect but yields much better results in affordance detection than without ( result from pre",
    " tests ) .",
    "the general lesson from this is that the quality of the internal simulations depends on the precise registration of the initial real  world state , and that this precision can be enhanced by exploiting redundancy and by reconstructing incomplete features through implicit knowledge about typical feature characteristics  without abandoning the basic principle of the pta approach that pure sensory processing has to be kept at a rather simple level .",
    "furthermore , we extended our previous work @xcite by comparing different types of inverse models and other aspects of the simulation process in a systematic experimental study .",
    "the most important results can be summarized as follows : although random walks can be rather successful in generating useful movement sequences , this comes at the price of a considerably larger simulation effort ( required number of simulation trials , invocations of the forward model ) compared to purposefully trained inverse models .",
    "this shows that the inverse model is not a dispensable part of the cognitive architecture , but instead a very important one ( even more so if one considers the possibility of a hierarchy over several forward and inverse models at more and more abstract processing levels ) . for the injection of randomness into the simulation process , we compared two different methods : ( 1 ) using a deterministic inverse model",
    "whose output is from time to time complemented by some random motor commands , or ( 2 ) by interpreting the output of the inverse model in a probabilistic way . in our view , the latter method is more elegant , however , the results show that the first method is superior ( performance  wise only slightly , but regarding simulation effort rather significantly ) .",
    "although this finding is most likely task  dependent , the general lesson from this is that the question on how to create some random variety in the simulation process deserves high attention because it can have a strong impact on the efficiency .",
    "a third difference concerns the implementation of the forward model . in our previous work @xcite",
    ", we used a set of multi  layer perceptrons to approximate the training data . in the real  world setting with more noisy training data ,",
    "an approach with a very strong regularization was more successful : fitting analytical functions with only a very small number of free parameters to the data . on the downside ,",
    "this caused undesired extrapolation behavior which was counteracted by projecting the predicted parameters of the obstacle segments back onto the distribution of these parameters in the training data .",
    "this is conceptually similar to the approach by @xcite who projected patches of predicted images back onto the distribution of these patches by a gaussian mixture model ( also for the purpose of avoiding `` catastrophic extrapolation '' in the internal multi  step simulation ) .",
    "we assume that such a predictor  corrector scheme is generally very useful to stabilize long  term simulations because it can partly compensate inprecise predictions .    in this way",
    "the present study identifies several important principles which can be used to successfully create robot implementations of computational models which are based on the concept of internal simulation ( e.g. , simulation theories of perception and cognition ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "with regard to its conceptual underpinnings and basic methodology , our work belongs to the fields of `` embodied cognition '' and `` developmental robotics '' @xcite in that it aims on a sensorimotor foundation of cognition and puts a strong emphasis on learning .",
    "the final goal of the pta approach is to explain the direct perception of more complex affordances in real  world settings ( e.g. , `` sit  on  able '' for a humanoid robot , or `` bimanually",
    " graspable '' for a setup with two robot arms ) .",
    "one day affordance detection could complement or maybe even replace classical object recognition algorithms which work solely on sensory data .",
