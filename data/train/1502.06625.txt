    "the basic structure of two - particle green functions of interacting quantum many - body systems can exhibit singularities for different combinations of external momenta and frequencies . in simple cases",
    "only one particular combination dominates the perturbation series , so that it is sufficient to resum the diagrams corresponding to this combination . for example , slightly above a superconducting instability the two - particle green function becomes singular if the total momentum and the total energy of the two incoming particles are small ( particle - particle channel ) .",
    "it is then sufficient to approximate the effective interaction , appearing in the skeleton diagram of the two - particle green function , by summing only the ladder diagrams with small total momentum@xcite .",
    "another example is the electron gas at high densities , where the effective interaction can be calculated by summing the geometric series of particle - hole bubbles which dominate for small momentum transfers @xcite . in some cases ,",
    "however , a single dominant scattering channel does not exist and singularities in more than one scattering channel appear in perturbation theory . in such cases ,",
    "the usual strategy of summing only particle - particle ladders or particle - hole bubbles is inapplicable and one has to solve coupled bethe - salpeter equations in more than one channel .",
    "diagrammatically , this means summing the so - called parquet diagrams where particle - hole bubbles and particle - particle ladders are self - consistently inserted into each other .",
    "historically , such a resummation was first used by sudakov and co - authors @xcite in the context of high - energy meson - meson scattering . since then",
    ", parquet methods have played an important role in studying quantum impurity models@xcite , low - dimensional metals @xcite , liquid helium @xcite , and vortex liquids@xcite .",
    "moreover parquet methods have also been used to construct approximations to reduced density matrices of large physical systems@xcite , nuclear structure calculations@xcite , and different lattice models for strongly correlated electrons@xcite . in particular , in two seminal papers by roulet _",

    "_ @xcite the threshold exponents of the so - called x - ray problem@xcite were obtained using the parquet method .",
    "the agreement of the parquet result for the threshold exponents with the known exact result @xcite at weak coupling supports the validity of this technique .",
    "while parquet methods are a well established many - body tool@xcite , they are not straightforward to apply to physical problems of interest .",
    "one reason could be related to the fact that the derivation of coupled bethe - salpeter equations in several channels often relies on subtle diagrammatic and combinatoric considerations .",
    "moreover , the explicit solution of coupled bethe - salpeter equations often requires rather substantial algebraic manipulations or extensive numerical calculations .",
    "it is well known , however , that the summation of parquet diagrams can also be formulated in terms of the renormalization group .",
    "in fact , the modern formulation of the wilsonian renormalization group for fermionic many - body systems in terms of a formally exact hierarchy of flow equations for the one - particle irreducible vertices @xcite ( we shall refer to this approach as the functional renormalization group , abbreviated by frg ) opens new possibilities for dealing with parquet type of problems . on the one hand ,",
    "the frg offers a general and systematic framework of deriving parquet equations in a purely algebraic way without relying on diagrammatic arguments ; on the other hand , the formulation of coupled bethe - salpeter equations as frg flow equations offers new strategies of obtaining approximate solutions .    in this work",
    "we shall revisit the x - ray problem and present a systematic approach to obtain the well - known parquet results @xcite within the framework of the frg . in the x - ray problem both the particle - particle and the particle - hole channel exhibit logarithmic singularities , so that the calculation of the x - ray response function can be used as a benchmark for testing truncations of the frg flow equations .",

    "[ ] rely on the logarithmic nature of the singularities . however , the necessary algebra is quite demanding .",
    "here we show that the threshold exponents of the x - ray problem and the frequency dependence of the corresponding response function can be obtained in a relatively straightforward manner within the frg .",
    "our particular implementation of the frg relies on the partial bosonization of the theory , in both singular scattering channels , using multi - channel hubbard stratonovich transformations .",
    "we believe that this technique will also be useful in other problems which are dominated by competing singularities in several channels .",
