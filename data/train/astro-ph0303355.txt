    "the sunyaev - zeldovich effect ( sze ) is a spectral distortion of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) due to the inverse compton scattering of cmb photons by high energy electrons in the hot intracluster medium ( icm ) ( sunyaev @xmath11 zeldovich 1970,1972 ) . at low frequencies ( @xmath12 218 ghz ) the distortion appears to be a decrement and thereby the peak of cmb spectrum",
    "( @xmath4 160 ghz ) intensity is reduced .",
    "this effect has been suggested as an important tool for studying cosmology and astrophyics ( sunyaev @xmath11 zeldovich 1980 ; birkinshaw 1999 for more references ) .",

    "the value of @xmath1 from these findings are systematically lower than by other methods ( table .",
    "[ tbl : h_0.tbl ] ) .",
    "this systematic discrepancy is due to the lack of information about the intracluster gasdynamics , which forces observers to assume that clusters are spherically symmetric , isothermal and in hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "one well - known model based on these assumptions and frequently used by observers is the isothermal @xmath0 model ( cavaliere & fusca - femiano 1976 , 1978 ) .",
    "however , drastic improvements of the x - ray observations in the past decade have revealed the deficiencies of this model .",
    "one particular important fact that contradicts the isothermal @xmath0 model is the presence of clumping and substructures in clusters which characterize a cluster merger .",

    "it is convenient to introduce a parametrized model to account the scattered photons in the intracluster gas .",
    "one popular model is the isothermal @xmath0 model , which assumes that the electron temperature @xmath24 is constant and the electron number density has a spherically symmetric distribution : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the core radius of the cluster , @xmath27 is the central electron number density , and @xmath0 is a parameter close to @xmath28 .",

    "the high resolution adaptively refined simulations are performed after an initial low - resolution simulation is used to identify clusters .",
    "the simulation starts in an @xmath50 base grid ( level 0 grid ; l0 ) , 256/h mpc box at redshift 30 .",

    "up to five more levels ( l3 @xmath51 l7 ) of refinements are automatically introduced during the simulation . from l1 , each grid is twice the resoultion of the previous one and therefore the best spatial resolution is 15.6/h kpc .",

    "we observe these clusters along three lines of sight parallel to the edges of the box .",
    "then we create synthetic maps of bolometric x - ray surface brightness and sz y - parameter by projecting the two dimensional maps along the observational lines of sight .",
    "the projected surface brightness and the y parameter can be written as : @xmath52 @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the angular size of the cluster in the sky , and @xmath45 is the corresponding core size ; @xmath41 and @xmath42 are peaks in the projected maps .",
    "we derive both profiles by calculating the annular average of the projected surface brightness and y - parameter maps . applying a three - parameter @xmath55 fitting on the profiles to eqn.([eqn : sx_profile.eqn ] ) and eqn.([eqn : y_profile.eqn ] )",
    ", we can determine the central values ( @xmath41 or @xmath42 ) as well as @xmath45 and @xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath0 value and @xmath45 used in eqn.([eqn : da.eqn ] ) are from fitting the x - ray surface brightness since the x - ray signal is much stronger than the sz signal and dominate the final result .",
    "the x - ray cooling function @xmath40 is calculated by a raymond - smith code with metalicity 0.3 solar .",
    "we analyze 27 numerically simulated clusters using the isothermal @xmath0 model and thereby derive the value of @xmath1 . applying the analysis procedure mentioned in @xmath56 , we compute the values of @xmath1 along three orthogonal lines of sight : x , y , and z. the resulting values of @xmath1 are normalized by 70 , which is the value adopted in the cosmological simulation .",
    "we denote the normalized hubble constant by f and find a broad , skewed distribution in f with a mean and median of 0.897 and 0.829 , respectively .",

    ", we first test the assumption of `` isothermality '' .",
    "this is done by setting the temperature of the entire cluster equal to the emission weighted temperature and creating the corresponding bolometric x - ray and the sze y - parameter maps .",
    "the results of analyzing these 27 isothermal clusters are displayed in table .",

    "we conclude that the applying an `` isothermal '' assumption on a non - isothermal cluster lowers the value of @xmath1 by around 20 @xmath9 compared to a real isothermal cluster .",
    "it is also noticeable that the standard deviation of the f distribution is close in both cases , which implies that the broad scattering in f is not mainly caused by the non - isothermality of clusters .",
    "based on fitting the x - ray surface brightness maps , some previous simulations have shown that the mean value of @xmath0 is around 0.8 ( metzler @xmath11 evrard , 1994 ) while the observational values are approximately 0.6 ( eg .",
    "mauskope et .",
    "al . , 2000 )",
    ". the mean value of @xmath57 in our simulation are 0.6210 , 0.6054 , and 0.6130 along 3 distinct lines of sight and is 0.61 if we combine the 3 line - of - sight results ( fig .",
    "[ fig : beta_all.fig ] ; table .",
    "[ tbl : beta.tbl ] ) .",
    "this indicates that our cosmological hydrodynamic code produces more realistic results than other codes ( p3msph code , metzler @xmath11 evrard , 1994 ) .",
    "another interesting result here is that we actually find a correlation between f and @xmath0 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : f_vs_beta.fig ] ) , which deserves more investigation .",
    "we also fit the @xmath0 parameter from the sz contour map as well as from the x - ray surface brightness map .",
    "the @xmath0 value derived from the sz data is typically higher than the one derived from x - ray data .",
    "[ fig : beta_xray_sz.fig ] shows the relation of @xmath0 values derived from the two different methods .",
    "a rich cluster possesses a high potential well at the central region where most dark matter concentrates . at hydrostatic equalibrium",
    ", the temperature follows the gravitational potential . since the potential decreases from the central core to the outer region , a decreasing temperature profile is expected ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "we define @xmath59 as @xmath60 to describe the `` non - isothermality '' of a cluster , where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the central and emission - weighted temperatures , respectively .",
    "thus @xmath59 equals 1 when a cluster is exactly isothermal .",
    "we denote the bias of the normalized hubble constant f as @xmath63 , which is defined as @xmath64 , where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the normalized hubble constant averaged over three lines of sight for the isothermal and the original clusters , respectively ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "the strong correlation ( correlation coefficient equals 0.73 ) between these two variables confirms that the huge bias is due to the `` isothermal '' assumption ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : df_vs_tiso.fig ] ) .      to study the elongation effect on @xmath1",
    ", we define a characteristic length for a cluster at certain direction as : @xmath67 where @xmath68 integrates through the peak of a projected x - ray surface brightness map along the observational line of sight .",
    "the results of three different lines of sight are denoted by @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 .",
    "since the size of a cluster varies , we normalize @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 by the value @xmath72 = @xmath73 .",
    "on the other hand , for each single cluster , the normalized hubble constant along three observational lines of sight @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 are renormalized by their mean value @xmath77 = @xmath78 ( @xmath74+@xmath75+@xmath76 ) . because @xmath77 varies in different clusters due to different temperature structures ( @xmath18 ) , we reduce corresponding effects by renormalizing f by @xmath77 .",
    "[ fig : lc_f.fig ] shows the strong negtive correlation ( correlation coefficient equals -0.74 ) between @xmath79 and @xmath80 , which indicates that for a given aspherical cluster , the observed value of @xmath1 is smaller along the longer axis . this result is consistent with the study by roettiger et al .",
    "our study of the 27 numerically simulated clusters reveals an universal temperature profile .",
    "the best fitting formula for the temperature profile is : @xmath81 where @xmath61 is the central temperature of a cluster and @xmath82 is the core radius . at high redshift , such as 0.5 in our case ,",
    "a lot of clusters are still dynamically young and non - relaxed , which results in the presence of some temperature clumps inside a cluster and thereby an irregular temperature profile . here",
    "we disregard this type of clusters and concentrate on clusters without temperature clumps .",
    "our refined sample includes 16 clusters with well - fitted temperature profiles .",
    "the average value of @xmath83 drawn from these 16 clusters is 0.56 .",
    "[ fig : cl0022_sample_p.fig ] shows a sample cluster fitted by this formula .",
    "based on the dramatic improvement of x - ray data from chandra and xmm , we anticipate getting temperature profiles of clusters in the near future . however , if the temperature profile is not available , one can still use non - isothermal @xmath0 model by taking the temperature profile derived from our simulation . if the temperature profile of a cluster follows eqn.([eqn : tem_profile.eqn ] ) , the central temperature @xmath61 and emission - weighted temperature @xmath62 are linked by : @xmath84 where r is the radial size of cluster and normally chosen to be the virial radius , which is around 1 mpc for rich clusters ; e(r ) @xmath85 @xmath86(r ) @xmath87(r ) @xmath2(r ) , where the bolometric emissivity @xmath2(r ) @xmath85 @xmath88 , @xmath86(r ) and @xmath87(r ) are the number density profiles of electrons and the protons . applying this temperature fitting formula to the final 16 clusters , we improve the mean value of @xmath1 by 9 @xmath9 ( table .  [ tbl : bmodel_compare.tbl ] ) .",
    "the lack of clumpings in the temperature profiles indicates the relaxation of the clusters , which results in the refined sample having less scattering in the f distribution than the original ones .",
    "one might argue that this decrease in the temperature profile is a result of the insufficient physics put in the simulation of the adiabatic clusters which do not have any cooling .",
    "however , some recent simulations including radiative cooling and supernovae feedback also show declining temperature profiles .",
    "these temperature profiles actually drop even more steeply than the adiabatic case ( loken et al .",
    "2002 ) and therefore the improvement benefits from the non - isothermal @xmath0 model would be even more for the cooling clusters .",
    "in practice , clusters are aspherical while the @xmath0 model assumes that they are spherically symmetric . to describe the morphology of clusters in a more accurate way , we choose an elliptical model .",
    "an ellipsoid has three principal axes whose lengths we denote a , b and c from the longest one to the shortest one .",
    "the lengths of the three principal axes are propotional to the square root of the eigenvalues of the inertial tensor matrix .",
    "we examine the oblateness or prolateness of clusters by calculating their e - p values ( thomas et al .",
    "1998 ) : @xmath89 @xmath90 on the ellipticity - prolateness ( e , p ) plane , the strictly prolate clusters fall on the p = -e line while the strictly oblate clusters fall on the p = e line .",
    "[ fig : ep_27.fig ] shows the distribution of the original 27 clusters on the ( e , p ) plane with the slope of a linear fit equaling to -0.733 . this indicates a strong prolateness among clusters .",
    "the prolateness of clusters is believed to be due to the cluster forming processes when they form from filaments .",
    "similarly , fig .",
    "[ fig : ep_16.fig ] displays the result of the 16 clusters with well - fitted temperature profiles ( see @xmath91 ) and the slope from a linear fit of these profiles gives -0.585 . comparing the results from these two groups of clusters , the larger slope of the 16 clusters implies that they are less prolate than the original 27 cluters . since relaxed clusters appear to be more spherical ( less prolate ) , this result is consistent with the selection done by their temperature profiles .",
    "accretion shocks and merging effects during the history of cluster formation result in the small - scale density fluctuations of the intracluster medium ( icm ) .",
    "therefore , all cluster atmospheres are expected to be clumpy . the clumpiness can be described by the clumping factor @xmath92 , which is defined as @xmath93 , where @xmath86 is the electron number density .",
    "then the true angular diameter distance is ( birkinshaw 1999 ) : @xmath94    this means that without accounting for the small - scale clumping , the value of @xmath1 based on eqn.([eqn : da.eqn ] ) is larger than the actual value . in our result , the values of @xmath92 range from 1.0 to 1.5 with a mean of 1.25 and a median of 1.17 ( table .",
    "[ tbl : clumping.tbl ] ) , which agrees with the result of mathiesen @xmath11 evrard ( 1999 ) . applying the clumping correction",
    "lowers the mean and median values of f while the scattering of the f distribution decreases notably .",
    "[ fig : f_clump.fig ] shows the f distribution of the original 27 clusters after the clumping correction ; table .",
    "[ tbl : clump_com.tbl ] displays the results of the isothermal clusters before and after the clumping correction .",
    "utilizing the combined analysis of sze and x - ray data with a standard isothermal @xmath0 model to determine the value of @xmath1 results in the mean value of the normalized hubble constant f being underestimated by 10 @xmath9 and the median by 17 @xmath9 compared to the actual value .",
    "there is a broad scattering in the f distribution and the standard deviation is around 32 @xmath9 of the actual value if we parametrize the f distribution by a gaussian . by setting the temperature of a whole cluster to be the emission - weighted temperature , the mean and median of f become 1.111 and 1.093 , which is 10@xmath9 higher than the actual value .",
    "however , this overestimate is offset by the clumping correction ( table .",
    "[ tbl : clump_com.tbl ] ) .",
    "the discovery of an universal temperature profile motivates us to propose a non - isothermal @xmath0 model to improve the analysis procedure .",
    "we refine our sample to 16 clusters which have well - fitted temperature profiles and apply the non - isothermal @xmath0 model to analyze them . based on these 16 relaxed clusters ,",
    "the mean value of f is underestimated by around 21 @xmath9 if the isothermal @xmath0 model is applied and by around 12 @xmath9 if the non - isothermal @xmath0 model is applied , which improves the mean value of f by 9 @xmath9 . by eliminating clusters with abnormal temperature profiles ,",
    "we also eliminate non - relaxed clusters .",
    "the scattering in f distribution of these relaxed clusters is reduced to around 15 @xmath9 of the actual value .",
    "we conclude that the broad scattering in the f distribution is due to the cluster morphology and the clumping effect .",
    "all our simulated clusters are at redshift 0.5 and a lot of them are dynamically young .",
    "we have shown the strong prolateness in the cluster morphology distribution of the original 27 clusters as well as the 16 refined clusters .",
    "the asphericity of clusters and random observational angles between the clusters axes and observational line of sight result in the broad scattering in the f distribution .",
    "another reason for the broad scattering is the clumpiness within the icm .",
    "we have shown that with the correction of the clumping factor , the scattering in the f distribution decreases while the mean and median drop as well .",
    "therefore , in the real observation , we suggest to pick up relaxed clusters by their temperature profiles once the temperature structures can be measured . by applying a non - isothermal @xmath0 model to these clusters",
    ", we can derive the value of @xmath1 . under this method ,",
    "we anticipate @xmath10 15@xmath9 scattering around the mean value of @xmath1 while the mean value is believed to be around 12@xmath9 lower than the actual value .",
