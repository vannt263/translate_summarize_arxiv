    "classical chaos is characterized by sensitive dependence on initial conditions , and by the fact that long trajectories uniformly fill the available space .",
    "these classical features have profound consequences in quantum mechanics : many quantum properties of chaotic systems become universal in the semiclassical limit , i.e. , they no longer depend on the system in question but only on symmetries .",
    "for instance , as conjectured in @xcite the statistics of energy eigenvalues is universal : neighboring levels tend to repel each other , and the correlation function of the level density @xmath0 , @xmath1 ( where the brackets and overbars denote averages over the center energy @xmath2 ) has the same form for all dynamics belonging to the same symmetry class .",
    "the most important classes are those of systems without any symmetries ( unitary class ; complex hermitian hamiltonians ) and systems whose sole symmetry is time - reversal invariance ( orthogonal class ; real symmetric hamiltonians ) .    if one accepts universal spectral correlations as a fact , a phenomenological prediction for @xmath3 can be obtained by averaging over ensembles of systems sharing the same symmetries . modelling the corresponding hamiltonians through matrices ,",
    "one arrives at random - matrix theory ( rmt ) , as initially proposed by wigner and dyson in the fifties @xcite in the context of atomic nuclei .",
    "rmt has since found broad applications in many fields of physics .",
    "for the correlation function @xmath3 , random - matrix averages yield the prediction @xcite @xmath4 with @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "it is convenient to access @xmath3 through a complex correlation function @xmath7 which is analytic in the energy upper half plane and connected with the real correlator as @xmath8 .",
    "the correlator @xmath7 has the nice property of being retrievable by borel summation @xcite from its asymptotic expansion @xmath9 the foregoing power series contains both non - oscillatory terms and oscillatory terms proportional to @xmath10 ; the latter are responsible for the singularity ( discontinuity at @xmath11 of the first or third derivative in the unitary and orthogonal case , respectively ) in the fourier transform of the spectral correlator @xmath12 ( the spectral form factor ) . for the unitary class we have @xmath13 , @xmath14 and all other coefficients",
    "vanish , whereas the orthogonal class involves @xmath15 , @xmath16 for @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 for @xmath20 .",
    "this phenomenological rmt result leaves open the question _ why _ chaotic systems behave universally , and that question we want to address in the present paper . taking a semiclassical approach one can follow gutzwiller @xcite and express the level density as a sum over contributions of classical periodic orbits . the correlation function then turns into a sum over pairs of orbits .",
    "systematic contributions to that double sum are due to pairs of orbits whose actions are sufficiently close for the associated quantum amplitudes to interfere constructively .",
    "the task of finding correlations in quantum spectra is translated into a classical one , namely to understand the correlations between actions of periodic orbits @xcite .        the first step in this direction",
    "was taken by berry @xcite who showed that pairs of _ identical _ or _ mutually time - reversed _",
    "orbits explain the leading coefficient @xmath21 .",
    "higher - order contributions @xmath22 with @xmath17 are due to a still not widely known feature of chaos , a certain `` bunching '' of periodic orbits @xcite .",
    "a long orbit has many close `` self - encounters '' ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : bunch_of_72 ] ) where it comes close to itself in phase space ( possibly up to time reversal , for dynamics with time reversal invariance ) .",
    "such an orbit is just one of a closely packed `` bunch '' .",
    "all orbits in a bunch are nearly identical , except that the orbit pieces inside the encounters are `` switched '' .",
    "based on insight from disordered systems @xcite , the study of bunches of orbits differing in encounters was pioneered by sieber and richter @xcite who derived the next - to - leading coefficient @xmath23 for time - reversal invariant systems from orbit pairs differing in just one encounter where two stretches of an orbit are close ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : rs ] ) .",
    "full agreement with all coefficients @xmath22 from rmt was established by the present authors in @xcite .        in none of these works",
    "oscillatory contributions could be obtained ( note however courageous forays by keating @xcite and bogomolny and keating @xcite ) , due to the fact that gutzwiller s formula for the level density is divergent . to enforce convergence",
    ", one needs to allow for complex energies with imaginary parts large compared to the mean level spacing , @xmath24 .",
    "oscillatory terms proportional to @xmath25 then become exponentially small and can not be resolved within the conventional semiclassical approach .",
    "in @xcite we proposed a way around this difficulty that we here want to elaborate in detail .",
    "the key idea is to represent the correlation function through derivatives of a generating function involving spectral determinants .",
    "two such representations are available and entail different semiclassical periodic - orbit expansions .",
    "one of them recovers the non - oscillatory part of the asymptotic expansion ( [ rmtseries ] ) , essentially in equivalence to @xcite ; the other representation breaks new ground by giving the oscillatory part of ( [ rmtseries ] ) .",
    "the full random - matrix result also , and in fact most naturally , arises within an alternative semiclassical approximation scheme proposed by berry and keating in @xcite .",
    "that scheme constrains the semiclassical periodic - orbit expansion of the spectral determinants @xmath26 to be real and to converge for real energy argument .",
    "inserted into the generating function the resulting `` riemann - siegel lookalike formula '' for @xmath26 was shown in @xcite to simultaneously produce both the non - oscillatory and oscillatory parts of the expansion ( [ rmtseries ] ) .",
    "interestingly , the riemann - siegel lookalike formula parallels an exact composition of the random - matrix averaged generating function originating from a weyl group symmetry @xcite .",
    "we want to stress that obtaining both the non - oscillatory and the oscillatory contributions to @xmath3 also implies a derivation of level repulsion : by summing up the asymptotic series ( [ rmtseries ] ) we access the full @xmath3 including its behavior for small @xmath27 , @xmath28 ( with @xmath29 for the unitary and @xmath30 for the orthogonal class ) , indicating a suppression of small energy differences .",
    "to get access to small @xmath27 the oscillatory contributions ( varying on the scale of the mean level spacing ) are of crucial importance .    for our semiclassical approach to spectral statistics",
    "we have drawn inspiration from a field - theoretical implementation of rmt , the nonlinear sigma model . there , the ensemble averaged generating function is ultimately transformed into an integral over matrices . in a stationary - phase approximation to that integral , two different saddles are found to respectively contribute non - oscillatory and oscillatory terms .",
    "the relation between these two contributions bears close resemblance to semiclassics .",
    "moreover the topologically different structures of orbit bunches in semiclassics turn out to be analogous to feynman diagrams in a perturbative treatment of the sigma model , with encounters corresponding to vertices .",
    "that analogy helps to do the sums required in semiclassics and to compact the semiclassical series to a matrix integral like the one in the sigma model .",
    "this derivation has to be contrasted with a previous field - theoretical approach to spectral universality , the ballistic sigma model @xcite .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows .",
    "we start by explaining the generating - function approach ( section [ sec : semi_howto ] ) , and give the pertinent generalization of berry s diagonal approximation ( section [ sec : diagonal ] ) .",
    "we then evaluate the contributions of bunches of periodic orbits to the generating function and the correlation function ( section [ sec : off ] ) and sum them up ( section [ sec : cancel ] ) .",
    "our reasoning culminates in the semiclassical construction of a sigma model lookalike ( section [ sec : build_sigma ] ) . for pedagogical reasons , sections [ sec : diagonal]-[sec : build_sigma ]",
    "are devoted to the unitary symmetry class , the simplest case .",
    "the generalizations necessary for time - reversal invariant dynamics are listed in section [ sec : orthogonal ] .",
    "the appendix [ sec : contraction_rules ] contains a derivation of contraction rules needed for the semiclassical construction of the matrix integral .",
    "further appendices contain ( [ sec : supersymmetric_sigma ] ) a brief introduction to the supersymmetric sigma model , ( [ sec : bosonic_sigma ] , [ sec : fermionic_sigma ] ) two replica versions of the sigma model and their relation to the semiclassical theory , ( [ app_permutations ] ) a characterization of orbit topologies in terms of permutations , and ( [ sec : complex_corr ] ) the energy average employed in the definition of the correlator and the connection between the real and complex correlation functions .",

    "this interchange and sign flip may as well be performed on the level of the generating function , i.e. , we can write @xmath103    instead of adding the crosswise representation in ( [ addderivatives ] ) we can use @xmath104 as a generating function , and get @xmath3 in full through the columnwise ( or crosswise ) representation alone . therefore no extra work is needed for the oscillatory part of the two - point correlation function , once the `` standard '' part @xmath86 of the asymptotics of @xmath45 is found .",
    "the resulting asymptotics of the generating function @xmath105 respects the weyl symmetry and remains valid when the arguments are real ( @xmath106 ) .",

    "as pointed out by keating and mller in @xcite , the additive structure ( [ z1z2 ] ) of the generating function most naturally arises with the help of the riemann - siegel lookalike formula @xcite .",
    "the essential idea is to eliminate a drawback of the semiclassical approximation ( [ gutzwiller],[gutzwiller_minus ] ) of the spectral determinant , namely its failure to manifestly preserve the reality of the energy eigenvalues , i.  e. , the unitarity of the quantum dynamics . in the limit @xmath62 , @xmath108 and @xmath109",
    "must become real and identical to each other .",
    "that property is not manifest in but may be imposed on eqs .",
    "( [ gutzwiller],[gutzwiller_minus ] ) . by imposing this property ,",
    "it was shown in @xcite that a duality arises between `` long '' pseudo - orbits ( sum of periods of contributing orbits larger than half the heisenberg time @xmath110 ) and `` short '' ones ( cumulative period smaller than @xmath111 ) ; the overall contribution of long orbits is the complex conjugate of the contribution arising from short orbits .",
    "the ensuing riemann - siegel lookalike expresses the real spectral determinant @xmath112 as a sum over pseudo - orbits with durations shorter than @xmath111 , @xmath113 to evaluate the generating function @xmath45 one now uses the riemann - siegel formula for the two spectral determinants in the numerator . for the determinants in the denominator",

    "the two latter contributions oscillate rapidly as functions of @xmath2 and thus vanish after averaging .",
    "the two surviving additive terms yield the high - energy asymptotics of the generating function @xmath117 found in the previous subsection , according to ( [ z1 ] , [ z2 ] ) , except that the sums over @xmath118 and @xmath119 are now restricted to pseudo - orbits with durations shorter than @xmath111 . to make that difference irrelevant it is convenient to evaluate the pseudo - orbit sum for large imaginary parts @xmath55 of the dimensionless energy offsets in the arguments of the action , @xmath120 , see ( [ large_eta_prec ] ) .",
    "that artifice makes sure that in the relevant integrals over orbit periods to be encountered below the integrand falls to exponentially small magnitude as the integration variable rises to near half the heisenberg time . if all four energy offsets @xmath121 are thus provided with large positive imaginary parts , the two additive pieces obtained through the riemann - siegel lookalike become respectively @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",

    "as already stated , our semiclassical construction of the @xmath455$]-integral corresponds to choosing the rational parametrization according to the @xmath413-integral in ( [ qint ] ) , since that choice for the rmt sigma model integral does yield @xmath86 in a gaussian approximation around @xmath449 .",
    "had we done our semiclassical analysis for @xmath456 , we would have ended up with a @xmath455$]-integral corresponding , in the rmt context , to the alternative rational parametrization in the @xmath444-integral in ( [ qint ] ) : the gaussian approximation about @xmath449 in ( [ qint ] ) does yield @xmath456 , as is easily checked . in other words , the asymptotic contribution which stems from the infinitely remote integration point in the parametrization using the standard saddle , becomes the contribution of the stationary point @xmath402 in the andreev - altshuler parametrization and vice versa .",
    "we now propose to generalize the above to time - reversal invariant systems . for them ,",
    "the possibility to revert orbits ( and their pieces ) in time makes room for more constructive interference .",
    "we shall see that the contributions of orbits differing in encounters no longer cancel but rather generate terms of arbitrarily high orders in @xmath153 .",
    "the summation of all relevant pseudo - orbit quadruplets can again be done with the help of a sigma - model type matrix integral .      for time - reversal invariant systems",
    "the orbits of @xmath457 can not only be repeated in @xmath458 but may also be reversed in time and only then included in @xmath458 .",
    "thus if we again formulate the _ diagonal approximation _ in terms of an exponentiated double sum over orbits ( [ zdiag ] ) , the relevant contributions to the exponent involve pairs of orbits which are either identical or mutually time - reversed .",
    "this doubling of orbit pairs leads to an additional factor 2 in the exponent , and the resulting term @xmath459 in eq .",
    "( [ z1diag ] ) needs to be squared .",
    "moreover , we now have to consider _ encounters _ where some of the stretches are almost mutually time - reversed rather than close in phase space .",
    "for instance , sieber - richter pairs as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : rs ] contain one encounter with two almost time - reversed stretches .",
    "if we change connections inside this encounter , the two links outside the encounter still look almost the same in configuration space , but one of them must be traversed with opposite sense of motion , and this is possible only if the dynamics is time reversal invariant .",
    "since time reversal changes the sides where a stretch enters or leaves an encounter , it becomes cumbersome to work with the notion of entrance and exit ports .",
    "instead we arbitrarily refer to the ports on one side of each encounter as `` left '' ports and those on the opposite side as `` right '' ports .",
    "encounter stretches may lead either from left to right or from right to left .",
    "the links may connect left and left , right and right , or left and right ports .    our formal definition of structures",
    "is then changed as follows : s1 : when numbering ports we now make sure that in @xmath97 the @xmath169-th left port is connected to the @xmath169-th right port , whereas in @xmath96 it is connected to the @xmath170-st right port .",
    "s2 : when connecting ports through links we have to allow for arbitrary connections between ports on either side of the encounters .",
    "s3 : apart from dividing the orbits before reconnection between the pseudo - orbits @xmath75 and @xmath118 and the orbits after reconnection among @xmath171 and @xmath119 we have to choose the sense of traversal of every orbit .    again",
    ", several structures can describe the same quadruplet .",
    "in particular , we decide arbitrarily which side of each encounter is chosen as left or right . for @xmath164 encounters there are @xmath460 equivalent possibilities of labelling the sides .",
    "to avoid overcounting , this factor needs to be divided out .",
    "the rest of our argument proceeds in analogy to section [ sec : off ] .",
    "our semiclassical _ generating function _ turns into @xmath461 where the subscripts in the encounter factor depend on the first left port .",
    "we note that some of these structures already appear for systems without time - reversal invariance , or coincide with such structures up to the directions of motion in some of the orbits .",
    "one can show that the proof of section [ sec : cancel ] generalizes accordingly , i.e. , all structures trivially related to those in the unitary case mutually cancel .",
    "let us use the semiclassical expansion ( [ masterorth ] ) to calculate the _ leading - order oscillatory contribution _ to the correlation function .",
    "the oscillatory term is obtained by application of @xmath462 to @xmath463 ^{2}\\left(1+z_{\\mathrm{off}}^{(1)}\\left ( \\epsilon _ { a},\\epsilon _ { b},-\\epsilon _ { d},-\\epsilon _ { c}\\right)\\right)\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\]]and then taking the limit @xmath464 .",
    "the factor @xmath465 ^{2}$ ] tends to zero in this limit even after taking the derivatives .",
    "therefore the oscillatory contribution to the correlator is purely off - diagonal",

    "the respective contributions in @xmath469 behave like @xmath470 ^{-1}$ ] . since inverse powers of the energy offsets",
    "can only originate from the link factors , such terms can only be due to quadruplets that contain a link belonging to the pseudo - orbit @xmath75 before and to @xmath119 after reconnection , and another link belonging to @xmath118 before and to @xmath171 after the reconnection .",
    "in particular this means that the corresponding quadruplets must contain at least two orbits , both before and after reconnection .    in the lowest order",

    "there are @xmath471 ways to choose directions of motion in each of the four orbits involved , and two choices for considering either of the two encounters as the first , leaving altogether 32 equivalent structures .",

    "the derivation of this matrix integral is very similar to the unitary case .",
    "first we encode every structure by a sequence of symbols , each symbol standing for a port , and links depicted by contraction lines .",
    "second , we replace every symbol by a bosonic or fermionic variable and integrate the product with a suitably chosen gaussian weight .",
    "the contribution of every structure will then coincide with the corresponding contractions in the resulting gaussian integral ; the sum over all possible link connections will be provided by the integral itself . finally , summing over all encounter sets we get an integral representation of the generating function known from the zero dimensional sigma model of rmt .",
    "we again write down the sequence of ports starting with the first left port of the first encounter , continuing with the first right port , etc . the left ports will be denoted by @xmath475 and the right ports by @xmath476 . the first and the second pair of indices of @xmath171 respectively refer to the properties of the port before and after reconnection , and vice versa for @xmath288 .",
    "as in the unitary case the latin index @xmath477 indicates whether the port belongs to the original pseudo - orbit @xmath75 ( @xmath289 ) , or @xmath118 ( @xmath290 ) .",
    "the index @xmath291 reveals whether after reconnection the port belongs to the partner pseudo - orbit @xmath171 ( @xmath292 ) or @xmath119 ( @xmath293 ) .",
    "the greek indices @xmath478 account for the directions of motion through the port and the attached encounter stretches , both in the pertinent original and partner orbits : if @xmath479 the direction is from left to right in the original orbit ; if @xmath480 it is from right to left .",
    "the index @xmath481 indicates the same for the partner orbits .",
    "the symbols @xmath482 can be considered as elements of @xmath415 matrices @xmath287 ; to simplify the notation we shall often substitute a capital latin letter for the composite index like @xmath483 .    as for systems without time - reversal invariance the ports are ordered such that an element of @xmath171 and the immediately following @xmath296 represent ports that are connected by an encounter stretch of an original orbit .",
    "this means that they have to belong to the same original pseudo - orbit , and that the direction of motion ( left to right or right to left ) must be the same as well .",

    "the connection of exit to entrance ports by links can also be represented by a similar permutation @xmath859 where the upper row refers to exit ports and the lower one to entrance ports .",
    "unlike @xmath860 the link permutation is totally arbitrary .",
    "the permutation products @xmath861 and @xmath862 define connections between the consecutive entrance ports before and after reconnection , respectively .",
    "each cycle of @xmath863 represents the sequence of the entrance ports of a pre - reconnection orbit in @xmath852 ; similarly , each cycle of @xmath864 defines such a sequence for a post - reconnection orbit in @xmath171 or @xmath119 .",
    "the numbers @xmath865 of cycles in these permutations give the numbers of pre- and post - reconnection orbits .",
    "our definition of a structure can thus be formalized as a particular choice of ( s1 ) the numbers @xmath164 and @xmath167 determining the permutation @xmath860 , ( s2 ) a link permutation @xmath863 , and ( s3 ) a division of the @xmath161 cycles of @xmath863 between the pseudo - orbits @xmath75 and @xmath866 and of the @xmath867 cycles of @xmath864 between the pseudo - orbits @xmath171 and @xmath119 .",
    "the order in which the encounters are numbered and the choice of the first stretch in an encounter is irrelevant .",
    "their change amounts to port renumbering , i.e. , also to a permutation ( an arbitrary permutation of the encounter numbers , and a cyclic permutation of the labels for each encounter ) .",
    "the possible renumberings corresponding to a given @xmath164 , @xmath167 form a group @xmath868 with @xmath869 elements .",
    "the renumbering @xmath870 transforms the encounter and link permutations as @xmath871 . for a structure devoid of any symmetry ,",
    "none of the non - trivial @xmath870 commute simultaneously with the link and encounter permutation , hence renumberings will produce @xmath872 structures described by @xmath873 , all of them corresponding to the same diagram and making the same contribution to the generating function .",
    "this overcounting is cancelled by the denominator @xmath874 in ( [ master3 ] ) such that we are left with the contribution of the respective diagram in the form of the ratio of the encounter and link factors .    in a symmetric topology @xmath118",
    "may simultaneously commute with @xmath859 and @xmath875 , and hence the number of equivalent structures is smaller than @xmath876 .",
    "however renumbering the encounters and stretches will still change the variables @xmath877 parametrizing the separations inside the encounters ; the indexing of the link durations is also changed .",
    "since we integrate over all values of @xmath877 as well as the link durations , relabelling thus leads to a separate contribution even in the symmetric case . to count each quadruplet only once we thus always have to divide by the number of possible relabellings @xmath878 .",
    "alternatively , we could formulate our approach in terms of a to sum over diagrams rather than structures .",
    "however , then the diagrams with symmetries would require special treatment .",
    "this was done in @xcite for the diagrams with @xmath159 , but it becomes too cumbersome for a generalization to arbitrary orders .",
    "for an example we consider a quadruplet containing , before and after the reconnection , one periodic orbit with two 2-encounters connected as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : symm ] .    the encounter and link permutations with the port numbering shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : symm ] read @xmath879where we put primes over the indices of the exit ports , to distinguish them from the entrance ports .",
    "we have the following possibilities to relabel encounters and stretches ( i ) interchange all first indices 1 and 2 , ( ii ) interchange 1.1 and 1.2 , and/or ( iii ) interchange 2.1 and 2.2 . as ( i ) and",
    "simultaneous application of ( ii ) and ( iii ) both leave @xmath875 and @xmath859 invariant there are only two equivalent structures associated with the diagram",
    ". however application of ( i ) and simultaneous application of ( ii ) and ( iii ) still changes the parameters @xmath880 and @xmath881 .",
    "hence when calculating the contribution of each structure by integrating over all parameters each quadruplet will be counted four times per structure . to avoid avoid",
    "overcounting we thus have to divide out @xmath882 , as we would without any symmetries .",
    "let us prove the relation @xmath883 with the complex correlator defined by ( [ defc ] ) , in particular the presence of the constant @xmath884 in ( [ defc ] ) .",
    "averaging in the definition of the spectral correlator , be it real or complex , is carried out over an interval of its both arguments , namely the central energy @xmath2 and the energy offset @xmath885 ; to obtain a smooth function the product of the two averaging intervals must be large compared with the squared mean level spacing , @xmath886 if we want oscillations of the correlator on the scale of the mean level spacing to be resolved the averaging interval of @xmath27 has to be taken small , @xmath887 . in view of ( [ avercond ] ) this means that the averaging interval @xmath888 $ ] of the central energy with @xmath889 must be large compared with the mean level spacing multiplied by @xmath890 . on the other hand the averaging interval must be small compared with the range populated by the consecutive levels @xmath891 .",
    "( the generalization to unbounded spectra or bounded spectra with @xmath892 is straightforward . )",
    "we define the average over the central energy as @xmath893 . in the energy range @xmath894 the mean level spacing @xmath895",
    "can be taken as constant . without loss of generality",
    "we choose to discuss spectral correlations in the middle of the range considered , i.  e.  at @xmath896 and can therefore take that energy as the center of the averaging interval @xmath897 $ ] . by explicitly doing the average over @xmath2 in the definition of the correlator ( [ defc ] ) we obtain @xmath898 _ { x = a}^{x = b}\\;\\right\\rangle_{\\epsilon}\\;. \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the remaining average is over @xmath27 only . using @xmath899 for @xmath900 and @xmath901 ,",
    "we can write the real part of @xmath118 as @xmath902where @xmath903 ( @xmath904 ) stem from products of the imaginary ( real ) parts of the fraction and the square bracket .",
    "we begin with @xmath903 assuming @xmath905 in the summand @xmath906  the phase of the expression in the square brackets can be ( i ) @xmath907 ( both @xmath908 and @xmath909 lie within the averaging interval of the central energy @xmath910 $ ] ) ; ( ii ) @xmath911 ( only one eigenvalue lies within  @xmath910 $ ] ) ; ( iii ) zero ( both eigenvalues are outside @xmath910 $ ] ) .",
    "let us assume that the energy offset @xmath912 is small compared with @xmath913 ; then considering the factor @xmath914 , we may neglect the possibility ( ii ) . up to an additive constant , @xmath903 must then coincide with the real correlation function , @xmath915    in the sum of products of real parts @xmath916the poles of @xmath917 are cancelled by the zero of the respective logarithms ; the mild logarithmic singularities of @xmath904 at @xmath918 are unconnected with the level correlation and thus of no physical relevance .",
    "( they are caused by the rectangular cut - off of the integrand at the borders of the averaging interval in @xmath919 and disappear if this cut - off is smoothed out ) . hence the summand has are no relevant singularities or other fluctuations on the scale of @xmath27 .",
    "we are thus free to replace the double sum over a discrete eigenvalue spectrum by a double integral over a uniformly distributed density , as in @xmath920 note that the smoothing w.r.t .",
    "the offset variable is thus rendered superfluous .",
    "consider now the semiclassical limit @xmath921 which means that @xmath922 ; we also assume the spectral span constant ( in classical units ) which means that the number @xmath592 of levels taken into account goes to infinity .",
    "let the averaging interval @xmath923 $ ] simultaneously shrink compared with the spectral span in such a way that the hierarchy @xmath924 is observed . neglecting @xmath925 and letting the parameter @xmath926 go to infinity we get @xmath927 collecting ( [ compco3 ] ) , ( [ rii ] ) , and ( [ rrr ] ) we come to the desired relation , @xmath928 .",
