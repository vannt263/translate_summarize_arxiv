    "alkali metals in their liquid state are outstanding examples of _ simple liquids _ , as they encompass most of the physical properties of complex fluids without system specific complications .",
    "for this reason , in the last fifty years they have been the subject of intensive investigations , both experimentally and by means of computer simulations , aiming at an understanding of the mechanisms underlying their collective dynamics at a microscopic length scale @xcite .",
    "interest in the collective excitations and interdiffusion processes in liquid binary mixtures , was stimulated by the pioneering molecular dynamics ( md ) study on the dynamics of the liquid na - k alloy by jacucci and mc donald @xcite .",
    "disparate masses metallic alloys soon became the subject of intensive studies : the existence of a new , high frequency mode with phase velocity exceeding the hydrodynamic value was reported by md simulations @xcite , and experimentally proved by inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) in @xmath1 , @xcite , in @xmath2 @xcite and @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the very nature of this additional mode , traditionally named _ fast sound _ , has been in focus of a lively debate in the last three decades .",
    "it was either interpreted as an atom - type acoustic mode , supported by the light ( li ) ions only , which would merge at low @xmath4 with the corresponding low frequency mode ( pb ) into a single hydrodynamic velocity , or like an optic - like excitation arising above a certain treshold @xmath4 value .",
    "the existence of a crossover from hydrodynamic into atom - type excitations can be theoretically rationalized within a concept of kinetic ( non - hydrodynamic ) modes in the framework of generalized collective modes ( gcm ) approach @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that , at low @xmath4 , two modes exists and can be associated to hydrodynamics density and concentration fluctuations ( collective region ) while , above a certain characteristic wavenumber ( dependent on mass ratio ) , each of the two excitation reflects the dynamics of a single atomic specie ( atom - type excitations ) .",
    "the experimental identification of the crossover , however , has been heavily debated .",
    "this was mostly due to the inherent difficulty of disentangling the coherent contribution from the total ins scattering signal , paired by the kinematic limitation restricting the accessible energy - momentum region . in he - ne mixtures , for instance ,",
    "the upper limit of the hydrodynamic region has been questioned , also in view of the possible definitions of the excitation frequency in terms of the maxima of the dynamic structure factor ( dsf ) , @xmath5 , rather that those of the longitudinal current autocorrelation function @xcite . @xmath6",
    "similar controversies appeared in the case of water @xcite , where for long time the existence of fast sound was debated , until the viscoelastic origin of such phenomenon was clarified @xcite .",
    "in fact , the advent of the new radiation sources opened the possibility to perform inelastic scattering with x - rays ( ixs ) , overcoming the previously mentioned limitations of ins . the purely coherent x - ray atomic cross section on one hand , and the relative high energy of the probing x - rays on the other , allowed to study the purely coherent dynamics of disordered systems over a wide energy - momentum range covering the region across the first pseudo brillouin region ( i.e. momentum transfers up to the first maximum of the static structure factor , @xmath7 ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the last decade saw a renewed interest in the investigation of high frequency dynamics in liquids and glasses .",
    "it is worth to emphasize in this context the lack of a unique and reliable methodology to analyze scattering experiments performed on binary liquids . in majority of experimental studies",
    "one makes use of either single dho model @xcite or even a memory - function ansatz -designed for one - component liquids- to estimate the dispersion law of collective excitations in binary melts @xcite . within this kind of approaches one necessarily ignores the existence of non - acoustic high - frequency excitations in binary liquids , which beyond hydrodynamic region contribute to the shape of partial dynamical structure factors . in this study",
    "we show how one can apply more sophisticated theoretical schemes to the analysis of experimental data in a molten metallic alloy , namely a theoretical gcm approach , which consistently treats contributions from hydrodynamic and kinetic modes to dynamical processes in liquids .",
    "we report here on an ixs study of the microscopic dynamics in the molten alkali alloy @xmath8 which allowed us to : _",
    "i ) _ identify the presence of two phonon - like modes , an high frequency and a low frequency one . _",
    "ii ) _ point out , by applying gcm theory to a binary mixture , the origin of these two modes and how they contribute to the measured ixs spectra , i.e. essentially to the mass density fluctuations spectra .",
    "specifically , we show the existence of a crossover from a hydrodynamic regime , where only one of the two modes is active , to an atom - type regime , where two excitations appear in the @xmath5 .",
    "_ iii ) _ assign the sound velocity excess over the hydrodynamic value to a relaxation process similar to that observed in simple @xcite , molecular @xcite and hydrogen bonding liquids @xcite , as opposed to the idea of acoustic excitation propagating over the network supported by the light specie or to the effect of optic - like excitations .",
    "the experiment reported in this work was carried out at the high resolution beam line id16 of the european synchrotron radiation facility ( grenoble , fr ) .",
    "the backscattering monochromator and analyzer crystals , operating at the @xmath9 silicon reflections gave a total energy resolution of 1.5 mev , while energy scans were performed by varying the temperature of the monochromator with respect to that of the analyzer crystals .",
    "a five analyzers bench allowed us to collect simultaneously spectra at five different values of constant momentum transfer , covering a @xmath4 region below the position of the main diffraction peak ( @xmath1018@xmath11 ) .",
    "the sample consisted of an nak alloy at @xmath12 k with sodium concentration @xmath13 atomic % , and was hold in a silica capillary of 2 mm inner diameter and 10 @xmath14 wall thickness , sealed and kept in an inert atmosphere .",
    "energy scans in the range @xmath15 @xmath16 where repeated up to a total integration time of 300 s / point .",

    "alternative representations of @xmath21 can be given in terms of dynamical variables derived from the @xmath26 as independent linear combinations .",
    "the most used options , in this respect , are the bathia thornton @xcite number - concentration , or the march mass - concentration variable @xcite .",
    "the usual approach to describe the dsf in a liquid is based on the solution of the langevin equation for an appropriate set of dynamical variables .",
    "this can be done , for instance , by modelling a suitable memory kernel .",
    "at least two relaxation times must be accounted for in the second order memory function to describe the density fluctuations in a monoatomic liquid @xcite , and a nontrivial generalization for the case of binary liquids is required , along the line of the scheme proposed in ref .",
    "for this reason we have chosen the gcm approach , which additionally treats coupling with thermal fluctuations and permits to solve the generalized langevin equation ( gle ) in terms of dynamical eigenmodes @xcite .",
    "in such an approach the gle is solved in a markovian approximation , while correlations faster than the hydrodynamic ones are accounted for by an appropriate choice for the set of dynamical variables . on this ground",
    "the solution of the gle is straightforwardly given in terms of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the hydrodynamic matrix @xmath27^{-1}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is the matrix of time correlation functions of all the variables belonging to the set , and @xmath29 is its laplace transform @xcite .",
    "the partial dsfs @xmath30 are then obtained by means of a time fourier transform of the corresponding components @xmath31 related , for example , to the partial number densities @xmath26 and @xmath32 .",
    "as we will show , the gcm approach captures all the essential features of the reported ixs experiment .    a suitable extended set of hydrodynamic variables for a binary mixture is provided by the set @xcite @xmath33 where the hydrodynamic variables reflecting the slowest fluctuations in the binary liquid are : total number density @xmath34 , mass concentration density @xmath35 , total longitudinal mass current @xmath36 and energy density @xmath37 .",
    "the variables with overdots correspond to the first time derivatives of the relevant fluctuations and are introduced to give a better representation of those process that are faster than the hydrodynamic ones .",
    "it is worth to emphasize here that , since total density and mass - concentration density can be easily represented as linear combinations of partial densities , one can represent the set ( [ eq:8var ] ) via partial dynamical variables .",
    "hence , the generalized hydrodynamic matrix @xmath38 constructed on t - x dynamical variables ( [ eq:8var ] ) or on partial dynamical variables will have identical eigenvalues , because both sets of dynamical variables are connected by linear transformation .    within this scheme , the ixs weighted dsf can be expressed as : @xmath39_{z = i\\omega } \\label{eq : gcm}\\ ] ] both the eigenvalues ( @xmath40 , which are complex or real in the case of propagating or diffusive modes , respectively ) and the corresponding eigenvectors ( @xmath41 which are the x - ray weighted eigenvectors , i.e. are determined as the appropriate linear combination of partial na and k densities , accounting for form factors and atomic concentration ) , can be evaluated within gcm theory once the @xmath4-dependent elements of the hydrodynamic matrix are known .",
    "this requires the knowledge of initial values of time correlation functions of the variables set , as well as the correlation times of the kind @xmath42 with @xmath43 @xcite . to evaluate these latter we performed molecular dynamics simulations on a system of 8000 particles interacting via effective two - body potentials @xcite in a microcanonical ensemble at @xmath44k",
    "the production run was performed over @xmath45 timesteps , and all the static and time correlation functions needed for gcm analysis were directly calculated in md .",
    "the minimal wavenumber reached was @xmath46 @xmath47 .",
    "the resulting spectrum consists of eight dynamical eigenmodes : complex - conjugated pairs of eigenvalues correspond to phonon - like collective excitations @xmath48 with @xmath49 and @xmath50 being frequency and damping of @xmath51-th excitation , respectively , while real eigenvalues represent purely diffusive relaxation processes .    the prediction of parameter - free gcm theory ( red lines ) are reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : panel ] along with the lineshape of eq.[eq : gcm ] in which the eigenmodes are obtained through a best fit to the experimental data ( blue lines ) . in this latter case",
    "we used as initial values those from gcm , and kept fixed all the frequencies of the propagating eigenvalues ( imaginary part of the complex eigenvalues ) , and the ( real ) eigenvalues of the diffusive modes ( diffusion coefficient ) . the weight coefficients @xmath52 as well as the damping coefficients ( real parts ) of propagating complex eigenvalues were instead let as free parameters .",
    "sum rules where used as constraints to further reduce the number of free parameters . ; @xmath53 ; @xmath54 the stage of fitting procedure is necessary since the gcm analysis is based on md simulations , which use effective two - body potentials .",
    "namely the use of effective potentials can introduce some extra error , because it is well known , that effective two - body potentials very rarely can yield the correct melting point , therefore under- or overestimating the contributions from relaxation processes to the shape of dynamical structure factors . in the anti - stokes side of fig .",
    "[ fig : panel ] one can see , that the parameter - free gcm approach correctly predicts the frequency of collective excitations observed in the scattering experiments , only relative weight of relaxation processes ( central peak ) and propagating modes is not well reproduced .",

    "this is a clear indication of the existence of two dynamical regimes , a low @xmath4 , collective region , and an high @xmath4 , atom - type region , in agreement with recent observation of optic - like modes above @xmath60 nm@xmath18 in md simulations on li alloys @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the experimental sound velocity @xmath61 determined by the maximum @xmath62 of the raw current autocorrelation function @xmath63 ( black crosses ) turns out to be mainly determined by the low energy mode at low @xmath4 and by the high energy mode at high @xmath4 .",

    "as previously mentioned , the amplitude values from gcm and from fitting procedure are quite different , but the oscillating behavior with the presence of sharp crossovers is captured by both the methods . the fact that positive dispersion observed from the ixs data occurs well below the first crossover , when the spectral frequency is solely reproduced by the low frequency mode , allows us to rule out a  fast sound \" mechanism i.e. the transition from the hydrodynamic regime to a dynamical regime in which the sound propagates over a network formed by the light component of the mixture , as it happens in disparate masses alloys . on the contrary , the origin of such an effect has to be traced back to a relaxation process of viscoelastic origin , similar to that invoked in simple @xcite and molecular @xcite liquids , glasses @xcite and in the controversial case of water and hydrogen bonding system @xcite .    ) and low ( @xmath58 ) frequency gcm modes are also reported . at q s below the crossover the same scenario depicted in fig .",

    "[ fig : mddispersion ] , this scenario holds at any @xmath4 s below the crossover , while at high q s the partial spectra are dominated by distinct optic - like modes which can be identified with the high and the low frequency gcm modes .",

    "the relative weight of the phonon - like modes shows an oscillatory behavior with @xmath4 , ruled by sharp crossovers defining collective and atom - type dynamic regions , in which the global density / concentration fluctuation and the partial na / k density fluctuations dominate , respectively . the observed positive dispersion of the acoustic branch , i.e. a sound velocity value exceeding the long wavelength limit , occurs well within the collective region .",
    "this indicates for this process an origin due to the existence of a microscopic relaxation , ubiquitous in monoatmic liquids , as opposed to the fast sound phenomena observed in disparate masses mixtures , where enhanced sound velocity has been suggested to be either due to the propagation of sound over the light component network or to the presence of an optic branch .",
