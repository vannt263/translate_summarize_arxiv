    "dynamical triangulations ( dt ) have been widely studied in the past decade as a non - perturbative model of quantum gravity .",
    "naturally , most of the work done has been in dimensions @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the action used to describe pure gravity in euclidean @xmath5-space is the einstein - hilbert action    @xmath6 = \\frac{1}{16 \\pi g } \\int d^{d}x \\sqrt{g}(2\\lambda - r),\\ ] ]    where @xmath7 is the cosmological constant , @xmath8 is the scalar curvature , @xmath9 is newton s constant and @xmath10 is the spacetime metric .",
    "the discretized version of the continuum action is well known and can be written as    @xmath11 = \\kappa_d n_d - \\kappa_{d-2 } n_{d-2},\\ ] ]    where @xmath12 is the total number of @xmath13-(sub)simplices in the simplicial manifold @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 represent the cosmological constant and newton s constant respectively . the partition function ( [ eq : part ] )",
    "can then be defined as the sum over all possible triangulations @xmath14 of a manifold of given topology , each weighted by its boltzmann factor .",
    "the topology is normally fixed to a @xmath5-sphere for simplicity .",
    "it can be convenient to express @xmath18 in a different but equivalent form @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "@xmath20    where @xmath21 and @xmath22 is the number of nodes in the triangulation .",
    "this is sometimes done since this action can be easier to use in a monte carlo algorithm .",
    "the actions @xmath18 and @xmath19 can be shown to be equivalent in dimensions 2 , 3 and 4 using the dehn - sommerville ( [ eq : dehn ] ) and euler ( [ eq : euler ] ) relations .",
    "these are simple linear relations between the total number of ( sub)simplices ( @xmath12 ) in a given simplicial manifold . in @xmath5-dimensions these relations are written as    @xmath23    and    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the euler characteristic ( @xmath26 for @xmath27 topology ) .",
    "the equivalence of @xmath18 and @xmath19 boils down to the question of whether one can express @xmath22 as a function of @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "this is indeed possible in @xmath5 = 2 , 3 and @xmath4 . in 5@xmath5 equations ( [ eq : dehn ] ) and ( [ eq : euler ] ) reduce to the following set of three independent relations .",
    "@xmath30    @xmath31    @xmath32    clearly @xmath22 can not be expressed in terms of @xmath33 and @xmath34 alone .",
    "therefore @xmath19 is _ not _ equivalent to @xmath18 in @xmath35 .",
    "similar results are found in @xmath36 .",
    "this result forces us to use the action    @xmath37    in five dimensions rather than    @xmath38    if we intend studying what we believe to be dynamically triangulated gravity , using the einstein - hilbert action on the lattice .    from equations",
    "( [ eq : indep ] ) we can see that the most general action linear in @xmath39 will contain three terms since we have six variables related by three independent equations .",
    "the coupling constant space is therefore three dimensional ( see fig .  [ k0k3 ] ) .",
    "the special case of action ( [ eq : k3action ] ) would represent a surface in this three dimensional space .",
    "the most general action @xmath40 in 5@xmath5 could have the form    @xmath41    such a situation does not arise in @xmath0 because the most general actions are two dimensional .",
    "so five is the lowest dimension in which this property exists .",
    "the aim of this work is to map out the three dimensional coupling constant space of 5@xmath5 dt using @xmath40 in the hope that it will reveal some extra phase structure .",
    "monte carlo simulations are first run using @xmath40 with @xmath43 ( tetrahedral action ) and @xmath44 ( nodal action ) .",
    "the observables measured include the average curvature @xmath45 , its susceptibility @xmath46 and the average geodesic length @xmath47 .",
    "a phase transition would result in a sharp rise in @xmath46 since it is a second derivative of the free energy .    if both limits produce identical phase transitions and are in the same universality class , then this forces the question : what is so special about the action that we derived from the continuum einstein - hilbert action ?",
    "it would also be interesting if both limits have distinct phase transitions since this would tell us that there could well be something special about our derived action .",
    "so far , we have identified phase transitions in both models .",
    "these are evident from the sharp rise in the geodesic lengths ( see figs . [ k0-d ] and [ k3-d ] ) , possibly indicating a branched polymer phase as found in 4@xmath5 , ( but this would require further study to be confirmed ) ; and small peaks in the curvature susceptibility @xmath46 .",
    "the size of the peak itself is relatively small , due to finite size effects of simulating lattice volumes of 10k and 20k , which correspond to a lattices of @xmath48 and @xmath49 respectively .",
    "the _ approximate _ location of the phase transitions were identified by running monte carlo simulations of @xmath50 sweeps .",
    "longer runs of @xmath51 sweeps were then done near the phase transitions in order to reduce errors .",
    "the phase transition for the nodal coupling was near @xmath52 ( see fig .  [ k0-rsus ] ) and at @xmath53 for the tetrahedral coupling ( see fig .  [ k3-rsus ] ) .",
    "once the order of the phase transitions and critical exponents are known , the next stage would be to investigate the region ` between ' these two limits ( see fig .",
    "[ k0k3 ] ) , ie . where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are non - zero in @xmath40 .",
    "this would give us a complete picture of the phase space .",
    "it will also be interesting to measure the distribution of singular vertices across the 3@xmath5 coupling constant space in order to compare results with @xcite ."
