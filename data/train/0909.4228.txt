    "among the most striking data taken with the grating instruments on the @xmath0 and @xmath1 x - ray satellites are the rich line absorption and emission spectra from seyfert galaxies and other active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "these spectra , referred to as ` warm absorbers ' , contain features from partially ionized ions of most astrophysically abundant elements , and they display systematic broadening and blueshifts corresponding to doppler velocities @xmath2 ",
    "@xmath3 km s@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the blueshifts indicate an outflow , suggest mass fluxes high enough to be important to the agn mass budget , and they may contain clues about the nature of the gas accreting onto the central black hole and its influence on the surrounding galaxy @xcite .",
    "the x - ray and uv spectra are rich with spectral features and of high statistical quality , and appear to be directly associated with the orientation effects inferred from seyfert galaxy unification @xcite .",
    "that is , seyfert 1 spectra show line absorption and scattering , while seyfert 2s show line and bound - free continuum emission . the properties of the gas , i.e. the ionization , speed , and column density , are similar in the two cases ; the primary difference is in the orientation relative to our line of sight . in seyfert 1",
    "objects we view the partially ionized gas primarily in transmission , and in seyfert 2 objects we see it in reflection",
    ".    observed warm absorber outflow velocities , and virial arguments , suggest that they are launched at @xmath5 gravitational radii , or @xmath6 cm from a 10@xmath7 @xmath8 black hole .",
    "this coincides with estimates for the location of the material , the ` obscuring molecular torus ' , which is responsible for blocking direct views of the central black hole in seyfert 2 galaxies @xcite .",
    "the structure of this obscuring torus , its origin and fate , are key questions in the study of agn .",
    "although the torus may represent part of a flow originating at smaller @xcite or larger @xcite radii , a convenient definition is that of cool ( @xmath9k ) optically and geometrically thick gas in approximate rotational and virial equilibrium at @xmath101 pc @xcite .",
    "any gas within the central region of an agn is likely to be heated and ionized by the strong uv - x - ray continuum from the black hole and inner accretion disk .",
    "the temperature of x - ray heated gas asymptotically approaches the compton temperature , @xmath11k , when the radiation flux is strong enough to exceed radiative cooling driven by atomic processes ( in case of the compton heated accretion disk winds see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , adiabatic losses due to the wind motion may help to keep the temperature of the gas at lower levels @xcite .",
    "gas at the compton temperature will not be bound in the local potential and will flow out in a wind ( krolik and begelman 1986 ) .",
    "the torus interior gas must be much cooler , and an x - ray illuminated torus will develop a heated intermediate region , corresponding to the transition between the two temperature extremes .",
    "the details of this transition are key to the understanding of warm absorbers , since neither the cool interior , nor the hot compton flow can produce the spectra we observe .",
    "the structure of the transition depends on the density structure and , therefore , on the dynamics .",
    "simple estimates , based on the assumption that the gas remains in ionization and thermal equilibrium with the radiation field , and that the flow geometry is spherical , predict that the transition should be sudden , so there should be little gas in the intermediate ` warm absorber ' state .",
    "this is clearly in conflict with the observations , suggesting that time - dependent or geometrical effects are important : warm absorbers may represent a snapshot of this gas as it is transiently heated and flows out from the torus .",
    "we have constructed 2.5 dimensional ( 2d , axisymmetric with rotation ) time dependent models for outflows driven by x - ray heating , which incorporate the torus geometry .",
    "simple transfer solutions suggest these can make spectra similar to those observed .",
    "they produce column densities , mean ionization states , and velocities of the outflows which are comparable to what is inferred from observed x - ray spectra .",
    "these conclusions are backed up by detailed multi - dimensional numerical hydrodynamic calculations , incorporating the physics of radiative heating , cooling , photoionization , and radiation pressure @xcite .",
    "a challenge for these models is that , since the warm absorber gas we observe is in a transient state , it occupies only a fraction of the volume in the torus opening .",
    "this predicts detectable warm absorbers from a smaller fraction of agn than is observed , since for many inclination angles the line of sight to the x - ray continuum source misses the partially ionized gas .",
    "the observed fraction is @xmath12 , and perhaps greater ( reynolds , 1997 ) , while models predict approximately half this number .",
    "furthermore , the models calculated so far do not reproduce some of the features observed from x - ray spectra , including an apparent bimodal distribution of ionization in many objects , and the presence of x - ray absorption by dust or neutral material in some spectra .",
    "some of the conclusions of our past work are limited by the simple 1-dimensional transfer we employed to calculate the emergent spectra . although these were useful as a preliminary step of predicting line spectrum , the 1d radiation transfer calculations are not capable of producing emission lines and of treating effects like filling of absorption lines with emission lines .",
    "in addition , all effects associated with non - radial motion of the fluid were neglected .    in this paper",
    "we produce full 3d radiation transfer calculations of x - ray line spectra from such flows using the information provided by our hydrodynamical models @xcite .",
    "these simulations produce spatial distributions of the projected velocities , and densities . using this information as an input to the 3d radiation transfer in x - ray lines ,",
    "we perform 3d radiation transfer in the sobolev approximation .",
    "we calculate spectra in approximately @xmath13 lines and also high resolution profiles of some of the strongest lines .",
    "to calculate an x - ray line spectrum from the moving gas which was stripped off the agn torus via x - ray induced evaporation , we combine together the following ingredients :    \\i ) taking into account heating and cooling processes we calculate a set of time - dependent 2.5d hydrodynamical models of winds evaporated from the agn torus .",
    "ii ) based on the 3d generalization of the escape probability method , we construct a numerical code which is able to calculate line spectra from a 3d flow .",
    "iii ) making use of the xstar code we calculate tables of x - ray opacities for different energies and ionization parameters .",
    "iv ) using opacity tables and distributions of density , and velocity from hydrodynamical models , we calculate the emergent spectrum .",
    "step i ) has been described in @xcite . in the following",
    "we briefly review methods and describe results of steps ii ) through iv ) .",
    "our hydrodynamic and radiation framework is described in detail @xcite . here",
    "we briefly review the methods and results .",
    "the primary physical assumption of our model is that that the inner face of the rotationally supported torus is exposed to radiation heating by x - rays generated by accretion near the supermassive black hole .",
    "the equations of hydrodynamics are calculated using the zeus-2d code @xcite , modified to take into account various processes of radiation - matter interaction ; this modeling includes time - dependent 2.5d hydrodynamical simulations ( that is time - dependent 2d simulations with rotation ) of the flow .",
    "interaction of the radiation with matter is incorporated into the hydrodynamical code taking into account radiation heating and cooling in the energy equation and pressure of the radiation in uv spectral lines and in continuum in the momentum equation .",
    "the rates of compton and photo - ionization heating and compton , radiative recombination , bremsstrahlung and line cooling are calculated using approximate formulae , which are modified from those of @xcite @xcite .",
    "these modified formulae adopt newly available atomic data and heating and cooling rates obtained from the xstar code @xcite .",
    "we assume that a certain fraction of a total black hole ( bh ) accretion luminosity , is emitted as x - rays which interact with the inner face of the rotationally supported torus and heat it .",
    "thus the cold gas of the torus is heated to almost the compton temperature ( @xmath14 ) , fills up a throat of the torus constituting an outflow .",
    "this hypothesis was tested both qualitatively and quantitatively by evolving such models in time , and exploring the parameter space , including the accretion efficiency , and geometrical and physical properties of the torus .      in the papers by @xcite pure absorption spectra",
    "were calculated from different models assuming different inclinations .",
    "transfer was calculated using simple 1d attenuation of the radiation due to line and bound - free absorption , assuming pure radial streaming of the radiation and also approximating the emitting core as a point source .",
    "the obvious limitations of this approach motivates a much more realistic radiation transfer treatment which would take into account spatial gradients of the velocity in a 3d flow . in this work",
    "we implement such an approach , in a 3d radiation transfer calculations in sobolev approximation for the line radiation transfer .",
    "the supersonic motion of gas of the agn wind provides justification for use of the sobolev approximation while calculating radiation transfer in spectral lines .",
    "the problem of radiation transfer in spectral lines in the sobolev approximation in a spherically - symmetrical flow is addressed in numerous papers ( for references see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the primary assumption of the sobolev approximation is that due to velocity gradients in the flow the doppler shifting of frequency moves a photon quickly out of the resonance soon after it interacts with the flow .",
    "thus the radiation transfer in the sobolev approximation is treated as an entirely local problem , assuming the characteristics of the absorbing plasma are constant across the narrow region of interaction .",
    "our hydrodynamical model is axially symmetric , but this symmetry is lost if viewed from an inclination angle , so to calculate the spectrum we must adopt a 3d sobolev approximation .",
    "even if the poloidal velocity along the streamline is monotonically increasing , the _ projected velocity _ may not behave in such a way , rather having a maximum or several maxima ( depending on the real structure of the 2d flow ) .",
    "this poses the problem of multiple resonances which we discuss in detail below .",
    "the geometry of the problem is shown in fig.[fig_geom ] .",
    "the cartesian coordinate system @xmath15 ( @xmath16 axis is not shown ) is located at @xmath17 .",
    "the observer is situated at infinity looking at the torus from an inclination , @xmath18 . since the hydrodynamical model is axially - symmetric , we put the observer in the @xmath19 plane .",
    "the plane of the sky , @xmath20 , is transported to @xmath17 , providing another cartesian coordinate system @xmath21 , ( @xmath22 axis is not shown ) which is the @xmath15 system , rotated by the angle @xmath18 around the @xmath16 axis .",
    "notice also that @xmath23 .",
    "our assumptions imply ( see further in the text ) that a photon after being scattered in a spectral line , for example , in the point @xmath24 , propagates along the straight line @xmath25 in the direction of the unit vector @xmath26 .",
    "this ray , @xmath25 intersects the plane @xmath20 at the point @xmath27 , being at the angle @xmath28 from the @xmath29 axis and at a distance @xmath30 ( impact parameter ) from @xmath17 . summing all such possible rays , i.e. integrating over the plane , @xmath20 , the radiation flux which is observed at infinity is obtained .",
    "-axis ( not shown ) points into the plane of the picture to form a right - handed @xmath15 coordinate system , and @xmath23",
    ". not to scale . ]    the total radiation flux which is registered by the observer at infinity at the frequency , @xmath31 , equals to    @xmath32    where @xmath33 is the flux in the continuum near the line frequency .    in our treatment of emission",
    "only resonant lines are considered .",
    "although we do consider non - resonant absorption in the approximate treatment of the attenuation ( section 2.3 ) .",
    "after being emitted by the core , or , alternatively , being conservatively scattered in a line , a photon remains at constant frequency , @xmath31 and direction of propagation , unless its frequency , @xmath34 in the frame co - moving with the gas appears in a resonance with a line transition :    @xmath35    where @xmath36 is the frequency of the line , and @xmath37 is the doppler width of the line .",
    "for such a @xmath31 , all such possible resonant points constitute resonant surfaces , which could have an extremely complicated shape in the case of a real flow . after encountering the resonance surface",
    "the intensity @xmath38 changes discontinuously :    @xmath39    where @xmath40 is the source function and @xmath41 is the optical depth in a spectral line .",
    "the intensity changes discontinuously , being a ) attenuated by a @xmath42 factor , and b ) reinforced by the contribution of the locally scattered radiation field , @xmath43 ( the last equality holds true for a point source and pure line scattering ) .",
    "the latter contribution results from scattering of external photons at a resonant point .",
    "let @xmath44 be the distance measured along the photon s trajectory , then @xmath45 in a direction @xmath46 in a moving gas depends on the gradient of the velocity in this direction , i.e. on @xmath47 and can be cast in the form :    @xmath48    where @xmath49 , @xmath50 is the line opacity , @xmath51 is the thomson scattering opacity , @xmath52 is the density , and @xmath53 is the thermal velocity .    in the presence of multiple resonances , distant points within the flow",
    "are causally connected , i.e. they can exchange photons ranging within the line frequency width . in terms of surfaces of equal frequencies ,",
    "such surfaces become multi branched , allowing for a photon of a frequency @xmath54 to interact with the moving matter at different points along a single line of sight . in the presence of multiple resonance surfaces , we assume that the interaction between @xmath55 and @xmath56 takes place only in the forward direction ( in the direction towards the observer ) .",
    "all other possible interactions are neglected .",
    "then the expression ( [ intens_jump_onefs ] ) should be just summed over the available resonance surfaces .",
    "altogether , these assumptions are known as the _ disconnected approximation _ @xcite :    @xmath57    where @xmath58 is the total number of resonances and @xmath59 is the initial intensity of the radiation at the point @xmath60 , which is the farthest point along the ray from the observer in the computational domain , @xmath61 is the intensity emitted by the source ( core ) , and for simplicity , we omit the dependence of @xmath38 on @xmath30 , @xmath28 , and @xmath18 ; @xmath62 is an electron scattering optical depth :    @xmath63    the source function is calculated with the method of escape probabilities ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the probability of a photon to escape in a direction @xmath46 in a moving gas , depends on the gradient of the velocity in this direction , @xmath46 , i.e. on @xmath47 :    @xmath64    where @xmath65 is the rate of strain tensor :    @xmath66    components of ( [ eij ] ) in spherical polar coordinates , are given , for example , by @xcite .",
    "a probability , @xmath67 of a photon to escape in a direction @xmath26 is given by    @xmath68    integrating this relation over solid angles @xmath69 ( i.e. either all over the sky , or over solid angles subtended by the source , @xmath70 ) results , respectively , in escape and penetration probabilities @xcite :    @xmath71    @xmath72    in the case of pure line scattering , the source function is cast in the form :    @xmath73    where @xmath74 is the mean intensity at the point @xmath75 :    @xmath76    and @xmath77 is the intensity of the continuum near @xmath36 , possibly attenuated by the electron scattering prior to resonant point , @xmath78 : @xmath79 .",
    "it is assumed that the attenuation is dominated by thomson scattering @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the mass fraction of hydrogen , and the factor @xmath82 , accounts approximately for the attenuation of the radiation flux on the way from the source to the resonant point .",
    "pre - calculated hydrodynamical models provide the distributions of density , @xmath83 and velocity , @xmath84 , needed to calculate @xmath85 and @xmath86 . with this knowledge in hand , substituting @xmath87 from ( [ intensityinfinity ] ) to ( [ flux_as_int_atinf ] ) , we calculate the spectrum .",
    "notice that in case of spherically symmetrical distributions of the velocity , density , etc .",
    ", the above formalism gives the well known p - cygni profiles .",
    "we have rigorously tested our calculations against the atlas of p - cygni profiles of @xcite .",
    "results of such testing are shown in @xcite , figure 9 .",
    "first we point out that in this work we consider transitions in _ all _ lines as resonant .",
    "that is , we do nt differentiate between true resonant event and lines whose upper levels are depopulated by photoionization , auto - ionization , and thermalization processes .",
    "this is an approximation which has only a small effect on our final results , since the strongest features in our spectra are true resonance lines . using the xstar code",
    "we calculate two opacity tables : table 1 contains only line opacities , and table 2 , only continua opacity .",
    "both tables contain cross sections as functions of ionization parameter ( see further in the text ) and energy . as mentioned in section 2.2 , to integrate flux , @xmath88 , from ( [ flux_as_int_atinf ] ) we sum all rays with all impact parameters , @xmath30 at all @xmath89 ( see figure [ fig_geom ] ) .",
    "starting from the boundary of the computational domain ( which is at @xmath90pc ) , we calculate intensity along the ray rb . at each point",
    "we calculate the local thomson optical depth between this point and the nucleus ( located at r=0.05pc ) , then calculate the attenuated ionization parameter , and then refer to table 1 to check the resonant condition , ( [ nucomoving ] ) , and if succeeded calculate the new value of intensity , @xmath38 , using ( [ intens_jump_onefs ] ) . between resonant points",
    "we attenuate the radiation field , making use of pure continuum opacities , from table 2 .",
    "we do not include any turbulent broadening in any of our calculations , rather just thermal broadening plus the effects of the bulk flow via the sobolev optical depth .",
    "our hydrodynamical modeling is based on the solution of the 2d , time - dependent hydrodynamical equations for rotating flow exposed to external x - ray heating .",
    "radiation pressure is taken into account both in continuum and due to uv pressure in spectral lines in which case it is calculated from the generalization of the @xcite formalism @xcite .    the assumed photo - ionization equilibrium of the wind implies the outflowing gas can be parameterized in terms of the ratio of radiation energy density to baryon density @xcite .",
    "one popular form of this parameter is    @xmath91    where @xmath92 is the local x - ray flux , @xmath93 is the x - ray luminosity of the nucleus , and and @xmath94 is the number density .",
    "we assume that the nucleus or the  core  at radius 0.05 pc , emits a continuum power law spectrum with energy index @xmath95 .",
    "the ionization parameter @xmath96 can be estimated in the following approximate way : @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is the column density in @xmath99 @xmath100 , @xmath101 is a fraction of the total accretion luminosity @xmath102 available in x - rays , @xmath103 is a fraction of the total eddington luminosity @xmath104 , where @xmath105 is the mass of a bh in @xmath106 .",
    "the radiation pressure in lines is calculated assuming the relative fraction of uv radiation , @xmath107 = 0.5 .",
    "heating and cooling rates account for compton and photo - ionization heating and compton , radiative recombination , bremsstrahlung and line cooling , and are incorporated into the equations of hydrodynamics .",
    "after non - dimensionalisation , our problem includes several characteristic scales : the radius is measured in terms of @xmath108 , which is the distance of the initial torus density maximum from the bh ; time in terms of @xmath109 , where @xmath110 is the distance in parsecs ; the characteristic velocity reads @xmath111 . from now on we measure time , @xmath112 in units of @xmath113 .",
    "initial conditions at @xmath114 are provided by the equilibrium toroidal configuration in which a polytropic , rotating gas is in equilibrium with the force of gravity and radiation force .",
    "thus , the initial state is a rotationally supported torus of @xcite , which is corrected for the radiation pressure .",
    "the parameter that determines the relative distortion of such a torus is @xmath115 , where @xmath116 is the cylindrical radius , and the inner and outer edges of the torus are located at @xmath117 and @xmath118 , respectively .",
    "the major goal of this paper is to calculate emission and absorption spectra predicted by hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "the maximum density of the initial torus , @xmath119 , or , alternatively , its initial compton optical depth @xmath120 is used as a parameter to distinguish between different models ; @xmath119 roughly scales with the column density of the absorbing gas during the evolution of the torus .",
    "our modeling of the spectra use a set of pre - calculated hydrodynamical models , including combinations for : @xmath121 , and @xmath122 ( models @xmath123 ) ; equivalently , these correspond to initial tori , having @xmath124 or @xmath125",

    "spectra calculated from hydrodynamics contain too many features for easy interpretation , and to make a comparison with observations feasible we convolve them with a gaussian which has fwhm(e)@xmath132 ; such convolved spectra are most closely related to what would be observed by an instrument such the _ chandra _ grating .",
    "however , contrary to such a real observer , we are also aware of un - convolved spectra , and we frequently use these to compare and interpret the results of our analysis and to establish possible pitfalls .",
    "further , we show that the interpretation of individual lines from the convolved spectra may contain significant caveats leading to a misinterpretation of the positions of some lines and of their relative blue- , and redshifts .",
    "our spectra contain absorption as well as emission features and for convenience we denote the wavelength ( or , equivalently the energy ) of an absorption line as @xmath133 and of an emission line as @xmath134 ; the line centroid as @xmath135 ; the blue - ward edge as @xmath136 , and the red - ward as @xmath137 . in this paper when speaking about individual lines we adopt the following convention : velocities corresponding to blueshifts are positive and to redshifts are respectively negative .    from hydrodynamical modeling @xcite",

    "these differences are partially due to the higher energy resolution of the opacity tables adopted in the current simulations and partially because of the qualitative difference of the 3d approach ( presence of significant emission component , finite size of the core ) .",

    "note that if there is only resonant scattering in lines present then significant emission can be obtained by accumulating photons form a large volume , which has a small thomson depth .",
    "our result shows that it is difficult to see extended regions behind the torus , and thus no significant emission lines with negative velocities are seen in the simulations .",
    "this model represents a wind which is launched closer to the bh , at @xmath235 pc .",
    "the overall spectra are similar to that of @xmath141 model although the larger escape velocity , @xmath236 implies larger velocities inferred from individual lines .",

    "some emission comes from the gas which is at lower @xmath174 which is generally moving faster than the wind at high inclinations . from @xmath254",
    "we have : @xmath255 from @xmath256 emission , and @xmath257 from @xmath230 absorption .",
    "we conclude that results for @xmath142 model are consistent with the general situation in which the gas is located two times closer to the bh , and the familiar funnel mechanism also helps it to escape with larger velocities : @xmath258 .    the structure of the hydrodynamical flow of this model is similar to that previously discussed : the _ radial _ column density at @xmath230 rises from @xmath259 at @xmath176 to @xmath260 at @xmath178 up @xmath261 at @xmath180 ; remarkably , the gain in column density occurs at the same radii as in the @xmath141 model .",
    "the line centroid , @xmath183 as in the @xmath141 model , is determined by two regions of the most favorable absorption : one starting from @xmath262 , where @xmath263 and density is @xmath264 and the other at @xmath265 where the density has a maximum value on this line - of - sight : @xmath266 , and the velocity @xmath267 . between these regions at @xmath187 the density decreases but the velocity increases : @xmath268 , as expected from mass flux conservation . as in the @xmath141 case , the ionization parameter , @xmath96 has a plateau , where @xmath269 .",

    "we look almost in the torus throat , just touching its inner evaporative skin , and these emission lines are formed by the gas within such a cone , i.e. at @xmath307 .",
    "we note the likely role of the accretion disk which in real agn is opaque to the external radiation and can screen the receding gas .",
    "obviously , no accretion disk in our simulations is explicitly taken into account so we are not able to take this effect into account .",
    "the lower density of models @xmath308 in comparison with models @xmath309 , allow us to see more interesting profiles of individual lines .",
    "at the critical inclination , @xmath310 the spectrum resembles that obtained from @xmath142 or @xmath141 models .",
    "however , in this case the profiles of many lines have a shape of p - cygni and many other have emission - absorption - emission features , with absorption being considerably stronger than emission .",
    "one example of such an m - shaped profile is shown in the next section ( figure [ figa3_t4_lines1 ] ) .",
    "the red- or blueshifted wings seen in the emission are due to a combination of rotation and the p - cygni mechanism ( in the red - ward part of the profile ) and due to rotation ( in the blue - ward part of the line profile ) .",

    "analysis of different models shows that , roughly speaking , in the middle of the torus evolution the spectrum which is most rich with spectral features is observed at inclinations near @xmath230 .",
    "this holds approximately true for both types of hydrodynamical models , @xmath308 and @xmath309 . at lower inclinations gas",
    "is mostly observed in emission lines while at higher inclinations , the spectrum becomes significantly absorbed by the cold gas in the torus .",
    "however some of the strong emission lines are seen atop of such absorbed continuum .",
    "the positions of the line centroid energies are generally consistent with what is expected from the torus x - ray exited wind paradigm , i.e. the inferred velocities are several times @xmath318 at 1 pc .",
    "there is also found an influence of the gas that was evaporated off the torus and then accreted deep into the potential well ; larger covering factor and high velocity allows it to block enough continuum and produce high velocity broadening of some lines .",
    "these high velocity signatures come from distances as small as @xmath319 pc .",
    "another interesting effect is a blending of multiple absorption and emission lines which are seen in the un - convolved , high resolution spectrum but form a single absorption line in the convolved spectrum . comparing high resolution and convolved spectra",
    ", we show that interpretation of such lines may in some cases lead to significant overestimation of the inferred gas velocity .",
    "many strong lines are observed blueshifted in absorption and at almost zero blueshift or very small in emission : @xmath320 ; for example , @xmath321 line @xmath204 ( 1472 ev ) in absorption indicates @xmath322 and having in emission almost zero shift , @xmath323 for the model @xmath142 .",
    "however from the high resolution spectrum we see the wings of this line indicate @xmath324 ( for the @xmath142 model )    blending of lines is important , for example there is a spectral feature which is observed in emission at @xmath325 , and in absorption at @xmath326 in @xmath142 and @xmath141 models . comparing with the un - convolved spectrum shows that this is the result of blending of many lines , specifically the h- and he - like ne , and lines from low ionization fe occurring in the @xmath327 ( 920.2 - 925.7 ev ) range .",
    "after convolution it produces a spectral line at @xmath328 ( 921.9 ev ) .",
    "individual line profiles obtained from some of our hydrodynamical models display multi - component features .",
    "that is , such a profile has two emission components separated by an absorption trough .",
    "most clearly such profiles are seen in models @xmath308 i.e. in those models which tend to have lower density and a wider throat of the torus .",
    "u shape profiles are well known in the case of fluorescent line emission from accretion disk ( see e.g. the nonrelativistic limit of @xcite or @xcite ) . using methods of escape probabilities ,",
    "@xcite calculated a profile of a line formed within a thin rotating disk .",
    "contrary to the familiar reflection fluorescent line , in their case the line is formed due to resonant scattering within the disk with the resultant formation of an m - shaped line profile .",
    "roughly speaking , motion of the gas distorts the m - shape profile towards a p - cygni shape , i.e. contributing to the red - ward emission hump .",
    "altogether there appears to be an m - shape profile with stronger red - ward emission ( figure [ figa3_t4_lines1 ] ) .    , observed at different evolution times at inclination @xmath329 . ]",

    "starting from @xmath333 to @xmath334 from the high resolution spectra , we have : @xmath335 , @xmath336 , and @xmath337 .",
    "such characteristics remain almost unchanged until @xmath140 , at which the weak m - shape profile appears : @xmath338 remains approximately the same , while @xmath339 , @xmath340 , and @xmath341 , @xmath342 ( @xmath343 is the energy of the most red- , or blue - ward wing of the line , @xmath344 is related to the different emission parts of the single m - shaped line ) .",
    "quite different behavior is found for other lines , such as @xmath302 : the line is in absorption at times @xmath345 showing weak p - cygni profiles at @xmath346 : @xmath347 , @xmath348 , and @xmath349 .    during the time evolution",
    "the torus is heated and loses mass via the wind .",
    "lowest density parts of it suffer most , and the torus is additionally influenced by the combined pressure of its own wind and radiation pressure .",
    "altogether they work to squeeze the torus towards the equatorial plane , @xcite .",
    "this is clearly seen in the @xmath331 line which is observed in absorption at almost all inclinations at which warm absorber is seen , and all times . also , virial arguments suggest that the absorber in this case is located closer to the torus . at later times , when the torus has the shape of a thick disk , at higher inclinations we are still able to see gas close to the source , where @xmath350 , and the m - shaped profile is observed .",
    "unfortunately , the fine structure of most lines is seen only in high resolution spectra and completely washed out by the convolution procedure . at most times , three dimensional modeling of our 2.5 hydrodynamical models predicts warm absorber spectrum in a relatively narrow range of inclinations : @xmath351 .",

    "we have carried out 3d radiation transfer simulations of the absorption - emission spectra produced by the x - ray excited wind from the obscuring torus in agn . as a previous stage of our research we performed time - dependent 2.5d numerical simulations of wind which originates from cold , rotationally supported torus",
    "whose inner throat is exposed to a strong ionizing radiation of the bh accretion disk @xcite .",
    "previous results include purely absorption spectra from such a flow , and suggest that this model is promising in establishing cold tori as a major source of the warm absorber flows observed in many agn .",
    "motivated by the fact that in case of an extended wind a 1d transmission approximation for the radiation transfer in lines is inadequate , we relax this approximation by performing 3d simulations of the radiation transfer in x - ray lines in a moving gas of the torus wind .",
    "the distribution of the gas is obtained from the hydrodynamical modeling which is used as an input to the radiation transfer calculations carried out making use of a 3d generalization of the castor escape probability formalism @xcite .",

    "many lines found in our synthetic spectra are blended , in particular with those from @xmath272 .",
    "velocities of this medium ionization component which are inferred directly from spectral lines shift are consistent with those derived directly from hydrodynamical models .",
    "some of the individual line profiles demonstrate p - cygni profiles and others have weak m - shaped profiles , with the red - ward wing being usually stronger than the blue - ward wing .",
    "such a profile is the result of complicated flow geometry at smaller radii : i.e. a combination of p - cygni profile and the importance of the azimuthal , @xmath220 and poloidal , @xmath312 velocities at smaller radii .",
    "if a warm absorber flow is thermally driven or ablated off of a cold or nearly - neutral surface , then the observed low ionization component provides evidence for this origin .",
    "this is confirmed by our numerical simulations : at the angles at which the line of site goes through the x - ray evaporated  skin  of the torus we see such a stripped gas .",
    "observations also suggest the simultaneous presence of gas at a low ionization state , log @xmath396 and a higher ionization component with log @xmath397 .",

    "gas at ionization parameters outside the range 0@xmath398log(@xmath3993 is harder to detect unambiguously from observations .",
    "torus winds naturally possesses features which are necessary for the formation of the flow with characteristics typical for warm absorbers .",
    "our calculations show that the angular distribution of @xmath96 is strongly angle - dependent , reflecting the 2d nature of the flow .",
    "our solutions also show that @xmath96 can vary dramatically along the line - of - sight . in absorption , at such inclinations at which the warm absorber is observed , the line - of - sight first touches the stripped cooler gas and then penetrates the torus funnel , where hotter gas is located .",
    "emission line photons are collected from a larger volume , coming from separated places in the outflowing gas , those which are not significantly obscured by the cold gas of the torus . in such flow different photons in a single line",
    "may come from regions quite separated in space ( multiple resonances ) making a single zone approximation for @xmath96 inadequate .",
    "our numerical methods are not capable of capturing some physics which is probably of importance here , most notably the co - existance of multiple phases in the outflowing plasma on level smaller than a typical size of our numerical cell . bearing in mind all these limitations",
    ", we note that in our hydrodynamic calculations we do nt see specific strong bi - modality in the distribution of @xmath96 .",
    "our models divide in two broad categories : more dense , having initial compton optical depth of the torus , @xmath400 , and less dense , with @xmath401 . additionally , we consider cases in which we put the initial torus , at either 1pc , or closer , 0.5pc from the bh .",
    "the x - ray heated gas is accelerated by the thermal mechanism within the throat of the torus .",
    "as already established @xcite such a funnel mechanism helps the gas to accelerate to velocities , @xmath402 of the order of several escape velocities , @xmath318(1pc ) .",
    "this velocity , @xmath402 is not necessarily equal to the terminal velocity , @xmath403 , due to the properties of the funnel flow .",

    ", the velocity corresponding to the centroid energy of an absorption line , is smaller than @xmath405 .",
    "most of such absorption is produced in a hot x - ray evaporated skin of a torus . at such distances ,",
    "the finite size of an x - ray source is not important .",
    "however , the blue - ward part of the absorption line in many cases moves as fast as @xmath406 , meaning the absorber is at least partially located at smaller radius . at such small radii the core",
    "can no longer be treated as a point source .",
    "rather it subtends a finite solid angle which finally translates to a broader angular pattern at which the absorption spectrum is seen from infinity .",
    "such an effect is revealed from individual line profiles .",
    "the most rapidly moving gas ( @xmath407 km@xmath408 ) sees such core from close proximity , and that influences the maximum blue- and redshift of photons within the line profile .",
    "this suggests that the torus wind may extend inward to the region where considered for accretion disk winds .",
    "as it could be impossible to tell between the torus wind and an accretion disk wind at such small distances from a bh , this result implies an accretion disk wind should be considered as a possibly important ingredient of modeling of warm absorber flows .",
