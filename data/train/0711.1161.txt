    "advances in mobile computing and hardware technology enable transmission of rich multimedia contents over wireless networks .",
    "examples include digital tv , voice and video transmission over cellular and wireless lan networks , and sensor networks . with the high demand for such services , it becomes crucial to identify the system limitations ,",
    "define the appropriate performance metrics , and to design wireless systems that are capable of achieving the best performance by overcoming the challenges posed by the system requirements and the wireless environment .",
    "in general , multimedia wireless communication requires transmitting analog sources over fading channels while satisfying the end - to - end average distortion and delay requirements of the application within the power limitations of the mobile terminal .",
    "multiple antennas at the transceivers have been proposed as a viable tool that can remarkably improve the performance of multimedia transmission over wireless channels .",
    "the additional degrees of freedom provided by multiple input multiple output ( mimo ) system can be utilized in the form of spatial multiplexing gain and/or spatial diversity gain , that is , either to transmit more information or to increase the reliability of the transmission .",
    "the tradeoff between these two gains is explicitly characterized as the diversity - multiplexing gain tradeoff ( dmt ) in @xcite . how to translate this tradeoff into an improved overall system performance depends on the application requirements and limitations .",
    "in this paper , we consider transmission of a continuous amplitude source over a mimo block rayleigh fading channel .",
    "we are interested in minimizing the end - to - end average distortion of the source .",
    "we assume that the instantaneous channel state information is only available at the receiver ( csir ) .",
    "we consider the case where @xmath4 source samples are to be transmitted over @xmath0 fading blocks spanning @xmath5 channel uses .",
    "we define the _ bandwidth ratio _ of the system as @xmath6 and analyze the system performance with respect to @xmath7 .",
    "we assume that @xmath4 is large enough to achieve the rate - distortion performance of the underlying source , and @xmath5 is large enough to design codes that can achieve all rates below the instantaneous capacity of the block fading channel .",
    "we are particularly interested in the high @xmath8 behavior of the expected distortion ( ed ) which is characterized by the _ distortion exponent _ @xcite : @xmath9    shannon s fundamental source - channel separation theorem does not apply to our scenario as the channel is no more ergodic .",
    "thus , the optimal strategy requires a joint source - channel coding approach .",
    "the minimum expected end - to - end distortion depends on the source characteristics , the distortion metric , the power constraint of the transmitter , the joint compression , channel coding and transmission techniques used .",
    "since we are interested in the average distortion of the system , this requires a strategy that performs ` well ' over a range of channel conditions .",
    "our approach is to first compress the source into multiple layers , where each layer successively refines the previous layers , and then transmit these layers at varying rates , hence providing unequal error protection so that the reconstructed signal quality can be adjusted to the instantaneous fading state without the availability of the channel state information at the transmitter ( csit ) .",
    "we consider transmitting the source layers either progressively in time , _ layered source coding with progressive transmission _ ( ls ) , or simultaneously by superposition , _ broadcast strategy with layered source _ ( bs ) .",
    "we also discuss a hybrid digital - analog extension of ls called _ hybrid - ls _",
    "( hls ) .",
    "the characterization of distortion exponent for fading channels has recently been investigated in several papers .",
    "distortion exponent is first defined in @xcite , and simple transmission schemes over two parallel fading channels are compared in terms of distortion exponent .",
    "our prior work includes maximizing distortion exponent using layered source transmission for cooperative relay @xcite , for siso @xcite , for mimo @xcite , and for parallel channels @xcite .",
    "holliday and goldsmith @xcite analyze high snr behavior of the expected distortion for single layer transmission over mimo without explicitly giving the achieved distortion exponent .",
    "hybrid digital - analog transmission , first proposed in @xcite for the gaussian broadcast channel , is considered in terms of distortion exponent for mimo channel in @xcite .",
    "others have focused on minimizing the end - to - end source distortion for general snr values @xcite .",
    "recently , the ls and bs strategies introduced here have been analyzed for finite snr and finite number of source layers in @xcite-@xcite .",
    "this paper derives explicit expressions for the achievable distortion exponent of ls , hls and bs strategies , and compares the achievable exponents with an upper bound derived by assuming perfect channel state information at the transmitter .",
    "our results reveal the following :    * ls strategy , which can easily be implemented by concatenating a layered source coder with a mimo channel encoder that time - shares among different code rates , improves the distortion exponent compared to the single - layer approach of @xcite even with limited number of source layers .",
    "however , the distortion exponent of ls still falls short of the upper bound .",
    "* while the hybrid digital - analog scheme meets the distortion exponent upper bound for small bandwidth ratios as shown in @xcite , the improvement of hybrid extension of ls ( hls ) over pure progressive layered digital transmission ( ls ) becomes insignificant as the bandwidth ratio or the number of digital layers increases .",
    "* transmitting layers simultaneously as suggested by bs provides the optimal distortion exponent for all bandwidth ratios when the system has one degree of freedom , i.e. , for single block miso / simo systems , and for high bandwidth ratios for the general mimo system .",
    "hence , for the mentioned cases the problem of characterizing the distortion exponent is solved .",
    "* there is a close relationship between the dmt of the underlying mimo channel and the achievable distortion exponent of the proposed schemes . for ls and hls ,",
    "we are able to give an explicit characterization of the achievable distortion exponent once the dmt of the system is provided . for bs",
    ", we enforce successive decoding at the receiver and the achievable distortion exponent closely relates to the ` _ _ successive decoding diversity - multiplexing tradeoff _ _ ' which will be rigorously defined in section [ s : bs ] . *",
    "the correspondence between source transmission to a single user with unknown noise variance and multicasting to users with different noise levels @xcite suggests that , our analysis would also apply to the multicasting case where each receiver has the same number of antennas and observes an independent block fading rayleigh channel possibly with a different mean . here",
    "the goal is to minimize the expected distortion of each user . alternatively",
    ", each user may have a static channel , but the channel gains over the users may be randomly distributed with independent rayleigh distribution , where the objective is to minimize the source distortion averaged over the users . * while minimizing the end - to - end distortion for finite snr is still an open problem , in the high snr regime we are able to provide a complete solution in certain scenarios . using this high snr analysis ,",
    "it is also possible to generalize the results to non - gaussian source distributions .",
    "furthermore , ls and bs strategies motivate source and channel coding strategies that are shown to perform very well for finite snrs as well @xcite-@xcite .",

    "since we are interested in the high snr regime , we use the outage probability , which has the same exponential behavior as the channel error probability @xcite . for a family of codes with rate @xmath58 , @xmath59 is defined as the multiplexing gain of the family , and @xmath60 as the diversity advantage , where @xmath61 is the outage probability of the code . the diversity gain @xmath62",

    "the source is first compressed at a specific rate @xmath73 , the compressed bits are channel coded at rate @xmath29 , and then transmitted over the channel .",
    "this is the approach taken in @xcite for two - parallel channels , in @xcite for cooperative relay channels , and in @xcite for the mimo channel to transmit an analog source over a fading channel . even though compression and channel coding are done separately , the rate is a common parameter that can be chosen to minimize the end - to - end distortion . note that the transmitter choses this rate @xmath29 without any channel state information .",

    "this gap gets larger with increasing degrees of freedom and increasing bandwidth ratio .     and",
    "@xmath86 mimo systems.,width=336 ]    the major drawback of the single layer digital scheme is that it suffers from the threshold effect , i.e. , error probability is bounded away from zero or an outage occurs when the channel quality is worse than a certain threshold , which is determined by the attempted rate .",
