    "the standard big - bang cosmology describes various astronomical and cosmological observations very well . to explain observational data , it requires two exotic unknown species beyond the standard model  ( sm ) of particle physics , namely the dark matter and the dark energy , which in the energy budget of the universe make up roughly 20% and 75% of the total energy density , respectively .",
    "although the evidence for dark matter has been established for many decades , the identity of its basic constituents has so far remained elusive .",
    "one of the popular candidates for dark matter ( dm ) is the weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) .",
    "needless to say , the detection of a wimp candidate is crucial not only for understanding the nature of dm , but also for distinguishing models of new physics beyond the sm .",
    "a  variety of experiments have been and are being carried out to detect dm directly by looking for the recoil energy of nuclei caused by the elastic scattering of a wimp off a nucleon .",
    "although there is some evidence for wimps from indirect dm searches  @xcite , there is as yet no confirmed signal for them from direct searches .",
    "stringent bounds on the wimp - nucleon elastic cross - section have been obtained from the null results of direct dm searches .",
    "the strictest limits to date on the cross section as a  function of wimp mass have been set by the recent xenon10  @xcite and cdmsii  @xcite experiments .",
    "they are shown in fig .",
    "[ dm_search ] , along with the expected sensitivities of a few future experiments .",
    "these upper bounds provide important restrictions on wimp models .    ,",
    "title=\"fig:\",width=288,height=259 ] , title=\"fig:\",width=288 ]    among the many possible wimps , the lightest supersymmetric particle is the most studied candidate .",
    "although this possibility has many attractive features , no direct experimental evidence for it has yet been discovered .",
    "it is therefore important to study and search for other possible wimps which can explain the dm relic density .",
    "the simplest model which has a wimp candidate is the sm+d , which extends the sm by the addition of a real gauge - singlet scalar field @xmath5 .",
    "this singlet field , which we will call darkon , can play the role of dark matter .",
    "the darkon as dm was first considered by silveira and zee  @xcite and further explored later by other groups  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study the constraints on the sm+d and its two - higgs - doublet extension ( thdm+d ) from the recent xenon10 and cdmsii experiments which set upper limits for the wimp - nucleon spin - independent elastic scattering cross - section  @xcite . in the sm+d",
    ", we find that a darkon having a mass in the ranges of 10 gev to @xmath6gev for higgs masses of @xmath7gev , respectively , is ruled out by the experimental bounds .",
    "this confirms some of the results obtained in refs .",
    "now , a wimp candidate with a mass in the range from 50 to 70gev can well explain the gamma - ray excess observed in the egret data  @xcite .",
    "the darkon mass range ruled out by xenon10 and cdmsii would imply that the darkon model is not likely to offer an explanation for the egret excess .",
    "it is then interesting to see if there are possible avenues to evade the experimental restrictions on the wimp - nucleon interactions and keep this darkon mass range viable . to this end",
    ", we consider two - higgs - doublet models with a darkon and find that in the type - ii thdm plus a darkon ( thdmii+d ) it is indeed possible for a  darkon with a mass within the range of interest to satisfy the experimental requirements .",
    "this can happen because of the suppression of the darkon - nucleon interaction at certain values of the parameters of the model .",
    "we also find that a darkon having mass within this range can lead to considerable enhancement of higgs decay widths through substantial invisible decays into darkon pairs .",
    "this could cause the higgs branching fractions to sm particles to diminish and consequently affect higgs signatures at colliders significantly .",
    "before starting our analysis of the models , we would like to summarize the relic - density constraints that any wimp candidate has to satisfy .",
    "for a given interaction of the wimp with sm particles , its annihilation rate into the latter and its relic density @xmath8 can be calculated and are related to each other by the thermal dynamics of the universe within the standard big - bang cosmology  @xcite . to a good approximation , @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the hubble constant in units of 100km/(s@xmath11mpc )",
