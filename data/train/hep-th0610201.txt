    "the study of symmetry breaking / restoration in quantum field theories is an important issue of relevance in many areas of physics .",
    "for example , today , problems regarding phase transitions in bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) or in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) concentrate a lot of theoretical as well as experimental efforts .",
    "of topical importance regarding studies of phase transitions in quantum field theory is the reliability of perturbation theory and its eventual breakdown .",
    "for instance perturbation theory at high temperatures breaks down due to the appearance of large infrared divergences , happening for example in massless field theories , like in qcd @xcite , close to critical temperatures ( in field theories displaying a second order phase transition or a weakly first order transition @xcite ) , or just because that at high temperatures there are parameter regimes where conventional perturbation schemes become unreliable when powers of the coupling constants become surmounted by powers of the temperature . in these cases ,",
    "a nontrivial problem arises since non - perturbative methods must be used .",
    "various non - perturbative techniques have been used to deal with these problems . among them",
    "we will be particularly interested in the @xmath1 approximation @xcite which , here , will be considered mainly for comparison .",
    "though a powerful resummation method , the @xmath1 approximation can quickly become cumbersome after the resummation of the first leading contributions , like for example in @xmath2 ( e.g , bec and polyacetylene ) or @xmath3 ( e.g. , qcd ) finite @xmath0 problems .",
    "this is due to technical difficulties such as the formal resummation of infinite subsets of feynman graphs and their subsequent renormalization .",
    "an alternative non - perturbative analytical method that we will make use in this work is the optimized perturbation theory , or linear @xmath4 expansion ( lde ) @xcite . in calculational terms ( including renormalization )",
    "its appeal regards the fact that one remains within the framework of perturbation theory .",
    "then , non - perturbative results are obtained by optimizing the perturbatively evaluated quantities .",
    "this procedure amounts to eliminate , variationally , mass parameters used to deform ( interpolate ) the original action .",
    "recently , the lde has been successful in treating scalar field theories at finite temperature and/or density .",
    "relativistic scalar @xmath5 theories have been treated at finite temperature @xcite as well as at finite temperature and density @xcite . at the same time , their nonrelativistic counter part , which is relevant for bec , has been studied in connection with the problem of the dependence with interactions of the critical temperature shift @xmath6 , given by the difference between the interacting and ideal gas critical temperatures ( for a recent review see for instance @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it suffices to say that the latest lde results @xcite are in excellent agreement with the monte carlo results , considered the most accurate prediction for @xmath6 , and it performs much better than the @xmath1 expansion used at leading and at next to the leading order ( for a review on the different results and methods used to study the @xmath6 in the bec problem , see @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , the convergence properties for this critical theory have been proved by the present and other authors @xcite .",
    "the present work will focus on the lde applications to problems involving phase transitions in asymptotically free models at finite temperatures and densities . here",
    ", we shall consider the 1 + 1 dimensional gross - neveu model ( gn ) , which is extensively used as a prototype model in studies related to phase transitions in particle physics as well as condensed matter physics .",
    "one recent application concerning particle physics is the next - to - leading order in @xmath1 evaluation of the effective potential at finite temperature performed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the condensed matter domain ,",
    "a very interesting recent application of the gn model was to the study of polymers @xcite , where a _ massive _ version of the model was used to show the appearance of a kink - antikink crystal phase that was missed in a previous work @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors work only within the leading order of the 1/@xmath0 expansion , so their results still show a phase transition at finite temperature @xmath7 and density @xmath8 . on the other hand",
    "they consider the case of inhomogeneous background fields , which should be physically more relevant in the 1 + 1 dimensional gn model .",
    "this is so because , in one space dimension , due to the landau - mermin - wagner - coleman theorem @xcite , no phase transition related to a discrete symmetry breaking ( in this case a discrete chiral symmetry in the massless gn model considered in this work ) is expected at any finite temperature . in the gn model",
    "this can be explained by the role played by kink - like inhomogeneous configurations @xcite that come to dominate the action functional , instead of just homogeneous , constant field configurations . by accounting for kink - like configurations in the large-@xmath0 approximation , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also ref . @xcite for a review ) find evidence for a crystal phase that shows up in the extreme @xmath9 and large @xmath8 part of the phase diagram .",
    "the other extreme of the phase diagram , large @xmath7 and @xmath10 , remains identical to the usual large-@xmath0 results for the critical temperature and tricritical points , which are well known results @xcite . in the study performed here ,",
    "we only consider homogeneous backgrounds , but go beyond large-@xmath0 , so the phase diagram changes as a whole .",
    "however , we can not see any crystal phase at small @xmath8 , that should be a consequence of kink like configurations dominating the action functional at that extreme of the phase diagram . despite of that",
    ", we are still improving the calculations for the gn model even though we are not considering inhomogeneous fields . and ,",
    "as explained above , since inhomogeneous backgrounds do not seem to change appreciably the large @xmath7 and small @xmath8 region , up to the tricritical point of the phase diagram , we are certainly improving the knowledge in that part of the phase diagram . at the same time",
    ", we believe that our results are not faithful in the small @xmath7 and large @xmath8 part of the phase diagram , which gets affected at large by inhomogeneous backgrounds as shown by the results obtained for the gn model in the large-@xmath0 approximation @xcite , though no results beyond large-@xmath0 are currently available .",
    "eventually , in the future it would be opportune to contrast the results found by the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite who considered a inhomogeneous background field to evaluate the effective action with the ones provided by the lde in the same context so that it could generate the effects of kink configurations beyond the large @xmath0 limit considered in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "another purpose of the work done here is to show the advantages and reliability of an alternative non - perturbative method like the lde in the understanding of the phase diagram of the massless gn model when considered beyond the large-@xmath0 limit . in this case",
    ", the massless gn model provides an excellent testing framework for the following reasons .",
    "as mentioned in the previous paragraph , large-@xmath0 results for the critical temperature ( @xmath11 ) @xcite , critical chemical potential ( @xmath12 ) @xcite , and tricritical points @xcite are well known @xcite . at the same time ,",
    "landau s theorem @xcite for phase transitions states that they can not occur in one space dimension , so that rigorously @xmath13 , meaning that the large-@xmath0 approximation behaves poorly in this case .",
    "these two extreme results allow us to gauge the lde performance in connection with the problem since we know that for @xmath14 our results should converge to the  exact \" , although wrong , large-@xmath0 result .",
    "for finite @xmath0 , on the other hand , our results should predict smaller values for the critical temperatures , in accordance with landau s theorem . at zero temperature and density ,",
    "the lde has been applied to this model with some success @xcite , since in this simpler case the lde could even be summed to all perturbative orders ( at least in the @xmath1 approximation ) , so that the large order behavior of the lde could be investigated .",
    "in fact , its convergence properties have been proved for a particular perturbation series in this context @xcite . at finite temperature ,",
    "an early application to the gn model @xcite showed the potentiality of this method .",
    "however , the renormalization program has not been addressed in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    ", our aim is to use all the latest lde improvements to evaluate the gn effective potential at finite temperature and density for any value of @xmath0 .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in the next section we present the model . in sec .",
    "iii we review the well established @xmath1 results to leading order considering the following four situations : ( a ) @xmath15 , ( b ) @xmath16 , ( c ) @xmath17 and ( d ) @xmath18 . in sec .",

    "this nice result is valid for any parameter values . in the same section",
    ", we explicitly evaluate the @xmath1 correction that also appears at the first lde nontrivial order . in sec .",
    "v the lde order-@xmath4 results are presented and compared to the large-@xmath0 results for the four situations described above .",
    "our major result is the production of analytical relations for the fermionic mass , critical temperature , critical chemical potential as well as tricritical points containing a finite @xmath0 correction .",
    "we show that all these quantities depend on an optimized mass scale set by the lde .",
    "all the analytical expressions have been cross checked numerically . in sec .",
    "vi we contrast the lde and the @xmath1 approximation results to leading order and to the next to the leading order .",

    "two appendices are included to show some technical details and the renormalization for the interpolated model .",
    "the gross - neveu model is described by the lagrangian density for a fermion field @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) given by @xcite    @xmath21    where the summation over flavors is implicit in the above equation , with e.g. @xmath22 .",
