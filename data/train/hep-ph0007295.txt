    "the production of vector bosons @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 @xcite is one of the most interesting processes in the phenomenology of hadron collisions and provides an environment to test both quantum chromodynamics and the standard model of electroweak interactions ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the lowest - order processes @xmath4 are not sufficient to make reliable predictions , but the initial - state radiation should be taken into account .",
    "monte carlo event generators and resummed analytical calculations are available tools to describe the multiple radiation accompanying the incoming hadrons .",
    "standard monte carlo algorithms @xcite describe the initial - state parton showers in the soft / collinear approximation , but can have ` dead zones ' , where no radiation is permitted",
    ". the radiation in these regions can be generated by the use of the exact first - order matrix element . referring to the herwig event generator , matrix - element corrections to drell  yan processes",
    "have been implemented in @xcite , following the general method of @xcite , and included in the new version herwig 6.1 @xcite .",
    "another possible approach consists of performing an analytical resummation of the large logarithmic coefficients which multiply the strong coupling constant .",
    "considering the transverse momentum @xmath5 distribution , logarithms of the ratio @xmath6 , @xmath7 being the vector boson mass , arise in calculating higher - order corrections to the born process .",
    "the resummation of these logarithms , which are large at small @xmath5 , was initially proposed by dokshitzer , dyakonov and troyan ( ddt ) @xcite , then accomplished by collins , sterman and soper ( css ) @xcite .",
    "css performed the resummation in the space of the impact parameter @xmath8 , which is the fourier conjugate of @xmath5 .",
    "their results have been implemented numerically in @xcite , while more recent analyses can be found in @xcite , where the resummation is performed in both @xmath5- and @xmath8-space .    in this paper",
    ", we review some results for the @xmath0 transverse momentum distribution according to the herwig event generator and resummed calculations .",
    "herwig simulates the initial - state radiation in hadron collisions according to a ` backward evolution ' @xcite , in which the scale is reduced away from the hard vertex and traces the hard - scattering partons back into the incoming hadrons .",
    "the branching algorithm relies on the universal structure of the elementary probability in the leading infrared approximation .",
    "the probability of the emission of an additional soft / collinear parton from a parton @xmath9 is given by the general result : @xmath10 the ordering variable is @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the energy of the parton that splits and @xmath13 , with @xmath14 and @xmath15 being the four - momenta of the splitting and of the emitted parton respectively ; @xmath16 is the energy fraction of the outgoing space - like parton with respect to the incoming one ; @xmath17 is the altarelli ",
    "parisi splitting function for a parton @xmath18 evolving in @xmath8 . in the approximation of massless partons",
    ", we have @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the emission angle to the incoming hadron direction . for soft emission ( @xmath21 ) , ordering according to @xmath22 corresponds to angular ordering .",
    "when the emission is hard , the energy of the radiated parton is similar to that of the splitting parton , so @xmath22-ordering corresponds to transverse momentum ordering . in ( [ elementary ] ) @xmath23 is the parton distribution function for the partons of type @xmath18 in the initial - state hadron , @xmath24 being the parton energy fraction .",
    "the function @xmath25\\ ] ] is the sudakov form factor , expressing the probability of no - resolvable branching in the range @xmath26 .",
    "the ratio of form factors in ( [ elementary ] ) is therefore the probability of no branching at higher values of @xmath22 .",
    "unitarity dictates that the sudakov form factor sums up all - order virtual and unresolved contributions . in ( [ elementary ] ) , @xmath27 is the maximum value of @xmath28 , fixed by the hard process , and @xmath29 is the value at which the backward evolution is terminated , corresponding , in the case of herwig , to a cutoff on the transverse momentum of the showering partons .",
    "however , since @xmath29 is smaller than the minimum scale at which the parton distribution functions are evaluated , an additional cutoff on the evolution variable @xmath22 has to be set .",
    "if the backward evolution has not resulted in a valence quark , an additional non - perturbative parton emission is generated to evolve back to a valence quark .",
    "such a valence quark has a gaussian distribution with respect to the non - perturbative intrinsic transverse momentum in the hadron , with a width @xmath30 that is an adjustable parameter and whose default value is zero .",
    "we need finally to specify the showering frame , the variables @xmath22 and @xmath16 being frame - dependent .",
    "one can show that , as a result of the @xmath31-ordering , the maximum @xmath28-values of two colour connected partons @xmath9 and @xmath32 are related via @xmath33 , which is lorentz - invariant . for vector boson production ,",
    "symmetric limits are set in herwig : @xmath34 .",
    "furthermore , the energy of the parton which initiates the cascade is given by @xmath35 .",
    "it follows that ordering according to @xmath31 implies @xmath36 .",
    "the region @xmath37 is therefore a ` dead zone ' for the shower evolution .",
    "in such a zone the physical radiation is not logarithmically enhanced , but not completely absent as happens in the standard algorithm .",
    "we therefore need to improve the herwig parton showers by the use of matrix - element corrections .",
    "according to @xcite , we populate the ` dead zone ' of the phase space using the exact @xmath38 matrix element ( hard correction ) .",
    "we also correct the emission in the already - populated region using the first - order result any time an emission is capable of being the ` hardest so far ' ( soft correction ) , where the hardness of an emission is measured in terms of the transverse momentum of the emitted parton relative to the splitting one .",
    "we consider the process @xmath39 , define the mandelstam variables @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 and obtain the total phase - space limits @xmath43 @xmath44 being the total centre - of - mass energy .",
    "we observe that the soft singularity corresponds to @xmath45 and the lines @xmath46 and @xmath47 to collinear gluon emission .    after relating the parton shower variables @xmath48 and @xmath49 to @xmath50 and @xmath51 , as done in @xcite , and setting @xmath36",
    ", one can get the herwig phase - space limits in terms of @xmath50 and @xmath51 . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we plot the total and the herwig phase space for @xmath52  gev and @xmath53  gev ; the soft and collinear singularity are inside the herwig region .",
    "we calculate the differential cross section with respect to @xmath50 and @xmath51 following the prescription of @xcite , where it is shown that , assuming that the rapidity and the virtuality of the vector boson are fixed by the born process , the following factorization formula holds : @xmath54,\\ ] ] where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the parton distribution functions of the scattering partons inside the incoming hadrons 1 and 2 for energy fractions @xmath57 and @xmath58 in the process @xmath59 , while @xmath60 and @xmath61 refer to the born process .",
    "a similar treatment holds for the compton process @xmath62 , as discussed in @xcite .    the distribution ( [ dsigma ] ) or the equivalent one for the compton process is implemented to generate events in the missing phase space and in the populated region every time an emission is the hardest so far .",
    "an interesting observable to study is the vector boson transverse momentum , which is constrained to be @xmath63 in the soft / collinear approximation .",
    "after matrix - element corrections , a fraction of events at higher @xmath5 is to be expected . in figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] we plot the @xmath1 @xmath5 distribution at the tevatron and at the lhc , according to herwig 5.9 and herwig 6.1 , the new version including matrix - element corrections , for @xmath64 .",
    "we see a big effect at large @xmath5 : after some @xmath5 the 5.9 version does not generate events anymore , while we still have a non - zero cross section after matrix - element corrections .",
    "moreover , a slight suppression can be seen at small @xmath5 .",
    "it is related to the fact that , although we are providing the shower with the tree - level @xmath38 corrections , virtual contributions are missing and we still get the leading - order cross section .",
    "the enhancement at large @xmath5 is therefore compensated by a suppression in the low-@xmath5 range .",
    "it is now interesting to compare the herwig results with some tevatron data . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we compare the herwig 6.1 distribution with some d  data @xcite and find reasonable agreement over the whole @xmath5 range . as shown in @xcite ,",
    "smearing the herwig curve to account for detector effects must be included to achieve this agreement .",
    "also , we do not see any relevant impact of setting @xmath65  gev after detector corrections .    in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] we compare the herwig 5.9 and 6.1 results , for different values of @xmath30 , with some cdf data @xcite , already corrected for detector effects .",
    "we find good agreement after matrix - element corrections , while the 5.9 version is not able to fit in with the data for @xmath66  gev . at low @xmath5 , the best agreement to the data",
    "is obtained for @xmath67  gev , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] . while the @xmath2 distribution strongly depends on @xmath30 at small @xmath5 , in @xcite and fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] it is shown that the ratio @xmath68 of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 spectra is approximately independent of it .",
    "mass difference .",
    "such a ratio is one of the main inputs for the @xmath1 mass measurement in hadron collisions and it is good news that it does not depend on unknown non - perturbative parameters .",
    "another possible approach to study the vector boson transverse momentum distribution consists of resumming the logarithmic terms @xmath69 in the low-@xmath5 range .",
    "it is interesting to compare the herwig phenomenological results with those of some resummed calculations , in particular @xcite and @xcite . according to @xcite ,",
    "the resummed differential cross section for @xmath1 production can be written as : @xmath70 + ( q\\leftrightarrow\\bar q')\\right]\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath71 is the relevant cabibbo  kobayashi ",
    "maskawa matrix element and @xmath72 . in ( [ ddtcs ] ) , @xmath73 $ ] is a sudakov - like form factor which resums the large logarithms associated to the initial - state radiation .",
    "it reads : @xmath74}\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath75 and @xmath76 can be expanded as : @xmath77 as far as the logarithms which contribute to the resummation are concerned , two conflicting nomenclatures exist .",
    "one consists of looking at sudakov exponent , where the leading logarithms ( ll ) are @xmath78 and the next - to - leading ones ( nll ) @xmath79 .",
    "it is straightforward to show that the ll contributions are obtained by keeping only the @xmath80 term in the expansions ( [ abexp ] ) while nll accuracy is achieved by considering @xmath81 and @xmath82 as well . in this sense , the approach @xcite is nll .",
    "another classification relies on the expansion of the exponent @xmath83 where the leading term is @xmath84 , so that the leading contributions to @xmath85 $ ] are @xmath86 , terms @xmath87 being next - to - leading .",
    "this is equivalent to saying that in the differential cross section the ll and nll contributions are @xmath88 and @xmath89 respectively .",
    "according to this nomenclature , the calculations @xcite and @xcite are nnll and nnnll respectively .    in the @xmath8-space formalism , following @xcite , the differential cross section reads : @xmath90 + ( q\\leftrightarrow\\bar q')\\right]\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath91 and @xmath92 are integration constants of order 1 and @xmath93 is the sudakov exponent in @xmath8-space .    for high @xmath8 values , i.e. small @xmath5 , non - perturbative effects",
    "are taken into account via a gaussian function @xmath94 , as suggested in @xcite . in both @xcite and @xcite",
    "the value @xmath95 @xmath96 is chosen .",
    "also , in order to allow resummed calculations to be reliable even at large @xmath5 , we wish to match the calculations of @xcite and @xcite to the exact @xmath38 result .",
    "we add the first - order cross section to the resummed result and , in order to avoid double counting , we subtract off the term which they have in common , which is the @xmath97 limit of the exact @xmath38 result . according to our prescription ,",
    "the matching works fine if at the point @xmath98 we have a continuous distribution .",
    "a detailed and general discussion on the comparison of angular - ordered parton shower algorithms with resummed calculations for drell  yan processes was already performed in @xcite , where the authors showed that , for @xmath99 , herwig always accounts for the term @xmath80 , corresponding to the leading logarithms in the exponent , and @xmath82 as well . furthermore , one is able to account for the nll term @xmath81 by simply modifying the altarelli ",
    "parisi splitting function introducing a second - order contribution @xmath100 where the @xmath101 factor is given by : @xmath102 @xmath103 being the number of flavours , @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "this is equivalent to redefining the qcd parameter @xmath106 to the ` monte carlo ' @xmath107 : @xmath108 with @xmath109 . even after these replacements",
    ", the herwig algorithm can not be considered completely accurate at the next - to - leading level , since it is still missing higher - order contributions in the strong coupling constant or the parton distribution functions ( see , for instance , the discussion in @xcite ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] we show the @xmath1 transverse momentum distribution at the tevatron in the low-@xmath5 range according to herwig 6.1 and the calculations of @xcite in @xmath5-space and of @xcite in @xmath5- and @xmath8-space .",
    "the herwig curve lies within the range of the resummed calculations , which is a reasonable result , considering that we are actually comparing different approaches . in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] we consider the whole @xmath5 range , with the resummations matched to the exact first - order amplitude .",
    "we find that the matching works fine only for the approach @xcite in @xmath5-space , the others showing a step at @xmath110 , due to uncompensated contributions of order @xmath111 or higher .",
    "the well - matched distribution agrees with the herwig 6.1 prediction at large @xmath5 .",
    "we studied the initial - state radiation in vector boson production according to the herwig event generator and some resummed calculations .",
    "in particular , we investigated the effect of the recently - implemented matrix - element corrections to the herwig algorithm .",
    "we found a big effect of such corrections on @xmath0 transverse momentum distributions at the tevatron and at the lhc , and good agreement with the d  and cdf data , with a crucial role played by such corrections in order to be able to fit in with the data at large @xmath5 .",
    "we also found that , even though the spectra at small @xmath5 do depend on the intrinsic non - perturbative transverse momentum , the ratio of the @xmath1 to the @xmath2 spectrum is roughly independent of it .",
    "we then considered some resummed calculations , which we matched to the exact @xmath38 matrix element , which makes them reliable at large @xmath5 as well .",
    "we found reasonable agreement of such approaches with herwig and fine matching only for the calculation which keeps all the next - to - leading logarithms in the sudakov exponent in @xmath5-space .",
    "finally , we have to say that the discussed method of improving the initial - state radiation in parton - shower monte carlo simulations can be extended to a wide range of interesting processes for the phenomenology of hadron colliders .",
    "the implementation of hard and soft corrections to top and higgs production is in progress .",
    "the presented results have been obtained in collaboration with mike seymour .",
    "we also acknowledge lynne orr for a careful reading of this manuscript . this work was supported by grant number de - fg02 - 91er40685 from the u.s . dept . of energy .",
