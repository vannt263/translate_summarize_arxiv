    "_ multiple hard parton interactions _ ( mpi ) started to play an important role in the description of the inelastic @xmath16 collisions at the collider energies . hence , although the studies of mpi began in eighties @xcite , they attracted a lot of theoretical and experimental attention only recently .",
    "extensive theoretical studies were carried out in the last decade , both for pp collisions @xcite , and for @xmath3 collisions @xcite .",
    "attempts have been made to incorporate multi - parton collisions in the monte carlo event generators @xcite .",
    "mpis can serve as a probe for _ non - perturbative correlations _ between partons in the nucleon wave function and are crucial for determining the structure of the underlying event at the lhc energies .",
    "they constitute an important background for the new physics searches at the lhc .",
    "a number of experimental studies were performed at the tevatron @xcite .",
    "new experimental studies are underway at the lhc @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the experimental data indicates @xcite that the rate of such collisions exceeds significantly a naive expectation based on the picture of the binary collisions of the uncorrelated partons of the nucleons ( provided one uses information from hera on the transverse distribution of gluons in nucleons ) .    in the parton model",
    "inspired picture mpi occur via collisions of the pairs of partons : the 2 mechanism ( collision of two pairs of partons ) . in pqcd",
    "the picture is more complicated since the qcd evolution generates short - range correlations between the partons ( splitting of one parton into two , ... ) the 2 mechanism@xcite .",
    "it was demonstrated that account of these pqcd correlations enhances the rate of mpi as compared to the parton model by a factor of up to two and may explain discrepancy of the data @xcite with the parton model .",
    "( a much larger enhancement recently reported in the double @xmath17 production @xcite can hardly be explained by this mechanism ) .",
    "presence of two mechanisms and limited knowledge of the nucleon multiparton structure makes a unique interpretation of the data rather difficult .",
    "hence here we propose to study the mpi process of @xmath18 interaction with production of four jets in the kinematics where two jets carry most of the light cone fraction of the photon four momentum - direct photon mechanism . in this process",
    "the 2 mechanism is absent and the only process which contributes is an analog of the 2 process.since in the proposed kinematics the contribution of the resolved photon is strongly suppressed the cross section in the leading log approximation ( lla ) i.e. summing leading collinear singularities is expressed through the integral over two particle gpds , @xmath19 , introduced in @xcite .",
    "this is in difference from the case of @xmath20 scattering where 2 contribution is proportional to a more complicated integral with the integrant proportional to the product of two double parton gpds .",
    "the main goal of the present paper is to show that processes with direct photon in photon proton collisions provide a golden opportunity for the model independent determination of the double parton distributions @xmath21 , free of the ambiguities inherent in @xmath22 scattering @xcite",
    ". we will consider the process of the interaction of the real / quasireal photon with proton with production of two pairs of hard jets in the back to back kinematics with each dijet consisting of a heavy ( charm ) quark and gluon jets ( see figs . 1 and 2 ) .",
    "we focus on the production of charm to suppress the contribution of the resolved photons .            in the discussed process",
    "a @xmath23 pair is produced in the photon fragmentation region , while two gluon jets are created predominantly in the target region , so that there is a large rapidity gap between the gluon and quark jets .",
    "the gluon and c - quark jets are approximately balanced pair vice .",
    "the cross section of the analogous process in @xmath16 collisions is influenced by parton correlations in both nucleons participating in the process , while in the case of the photon the cross section depends only on the integral over one wave function .",
    "the reason is that the process involves only one gpd from the nucleon , while the upper part of the diagram 1 is determined by the hard physics of the photon splitting to @xmath24 pair in an unambiguous way .",
    "it does not involve the scale @xmath25 that separates perturbative and nonperturbative correlations in a nucleon .",
    "thus the cross section of such a process is directly expressed through the nucleon double gpd .",
    "hence the measurement of the discussed cross section would allow to perform a nearly model independent analysis of dpi in @xmath16 scattering .",
    "we will demonstrate below that it would be possible also to study these processes at the future electron - proton / nucleus colliders .",
    "it maybe possible also to investigate these processes in @xmath2 and @xmath3 ultraperipheral collisions at the lhc .    here",
    "we will consider the mpi rates for all three types of processes mentioned above , @xmath26 .",
    "we will restrict ourselves to the kinematics @xmath0 , thus guaranteeing the dominance of the direct photon contribution ( for this cutoff the direct photons contribute 60% of the dijet cross section ) .",
    "for a lower @xmath27 cutoffs the relative contribution of the direct photon mechanism rapidly decreases for transverse momenta under consideration .",
    "we will demonstrate that for the lhec collider energies @xmath28 gev the rate of the discussed reaction will be very high : @xmath5 events per @xmath8 s for the luminosity @xmath6 @xmath29s@xmath30 and @xmath9 gev .",
    "the relative rate of mpi to to dijets is found to be @xmath31 . in principle",
    "a large number of events in the discussed kinematics was produced at hera : @xmath32 for the total luminosity @xmath33 fb@xmath30 . however",
    "the efficiency of the detection of @xmath34 was pretty low @xcite so it appears that it would be very difficult to study the discussed process using the hera data .",
    "another way to observe the discussed process in the near future maybe possible - study of mpi in the ultraperipheral @xmath35 processes at the full lhc energy . for example , for @xmath9 gev , we have @xmath12 events for @xmath2 , and @xmath36 events for @xmath3 scattering where we used luminosities @xmath37 ( @xmath2 ) , @xmath38 @xmath29s@xmath30 ( @xmath3 ) and running time of @xmath8 s. in the discussed kinematics mpi events constitute @xmath39 ( @xmath40 , @xmath41 ) of the dijet events for @xmath42 collisions respectively for the same jet cutoff .",
    "these fractions decrease rather rapidly with @xmath43 increase .",
    "of course , the mpi processes are contaminated by the leading twist 4 jet production the so called 2 to 4 processes",
    ". however it is possible to argue that in the back to back kinematics the contribution of these processes(see fig.3 ) are parametrically small in a wide region of the phase space @xcite .",
    "( moreover for the @xmath2 collisions there is an additional combinatorial @xmath44 enhancement over parasitical 2 to 4 contributions @xcite . )",
    "indeed , a detailed mc simulation analysis was done using pythia and madgraph for @xmath16 collisions @xcite .",
    "these authors have demonstrated that it is possible to introduce observables that are dominated by mpi in the back to back kinematics , thus allowing to measure mpi cross sections , as distinct from 2 to 4 processes .",
    "of course , further work is required in this direction , especially including nlo effects .",
    "note that mpi in the photon proton collisions were also studied in @xcite .",
    "these authors considered resolved photon kinematics , which is very different , from the one that is considered here .",
    "so there is no overlap with the present study .",
    "the paper is organized as following . in section 2",
    "we calculate the mpi contribution to @xmath45 process in the back to back kinematics . in section 3",
    "we calculate the rates of the discussed process for @xmath46 collisions at lhec and hera , and for ultraperipheral @xmath3 and @xmath2 collisions at the lhc . in section 4",
    "we carry the numerical simulations for realistic parameters corresponding to lhc and hera runs .",
    "the results are summarized in section 5 .",
    "first we consider the process of production of two dijets with single charm in each pair ( fig .",
    "4a ) in the parton model . in this case",
    "the process is essentially the same as the one already considered in ref .",
    "the only difference is that the parton created in the split vertex is a charmed quark ",
    "antiquark pair .",
    "the corresponding kinematics is depicted in fig .",
    "4a , and is analogous to the 2 transition in @xmath16 interactions .",
    "let us parameterize the momenta of quarks and gluons using sudakov variables ( @xmath47 are momenta of virtual charm quarks and antiquark of the @xmath48 pair and @xmath49 are the gluon momenta ) .",
    "let us analyze the lowest order amplitude shown in fig .",
    "4a for the double hard collision which involves parton splitting .",
    "we decompose parton momenta @xmath50 in terms of the so called sudakov variables using the light - like vectors @xmath51 and @xmath52 along the incident photon and proton momenta : @xmath53 here @xmath54 is the momentum of the quasireal photon .",
    "we can neglect the charm quark masses except while dealing with infrared singularities .",
    "the light - cone fractions @xmath27 , ( i=1, .. 4 ) , are determined by the jet kinematics ( invariant masses and rapidities of the jet pairs ) .",
    "the fraction @xmath55 that measures the _ difference _ of the longitudinal momenta of the two partons coming from the hadron , is arbitrary .",
    "the fixed values of the parton momentum fractions @xmath56 and @xmath57 correspond to the plane wave description of the scattering process in which the longitudinal distance between the two scatterings is arbitrary .",
    "this description does not correspond to the physical picture of the process we are discussing , where two partons originate from the same bound state . in order to ensure that partons @xmath58 and @xmath59 originate from the _ same hadron _ of a finite size , we have to introduce integration over @xmath55 in the _ amplitude _ , in the region @xmath60 , as was explained in detail in @xcite .",
    "the feynman amplitude contains the product of two virtual propagators .",
    "the virtualities @xmath61 and @xmath62 in the denominators of the propagators can be written in terms of the sudakov variables as k_1 ^ 2 = x_1s -k_^2 , k_2 ^ 2 = -x_2s -k_^2 , where @xmath63 and @xmath64 the square of the two - dimensional transverse momentum vector .",
    "the singular contribution we are looking for originates from the region @xmath65 .",
    "hence the precise form of the longitudinal smearing does not play role and the integral over @xmath55 yields the amplitude @xmath66 a~ = .",
    "the numerator of the full amplitude is proportional to the _ first power of the transverse momentum _ @xmath67 . as a result , the squared amplitude ( and thus the differential cross section ) acquires the necessary factor @xmath68 that enhances the back - to - back jet production .",
    "the integration over @xmath69 gives a single log contribution to the cross section @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the characteristic transverse scale of the hard processes .",
    "note , that strictly speaking the answer is proportional to @xmath72 .",
    "the parton model answer is only single collinearly enhanced , while we are looking for the double collinear enhanced contributions @xcite .",
    "it is well known that these contributions originate from the gluon dressing of the parton model vertex , with the @xmath73 function becoming a new pole .      a typical lowest order qcd diagram which accounts for the gluon emission",
    "is presented in fig .",
    "the compensating gluon relaxes the transverse momentum @xmath74 function .",
    "note however that the gluon can not be emitted from a photon , while in the @xmath16 case such emissions contribute , since the splitting parton carries color .",
    "this eliminates the so called short split contribution , which is present in the case of hadron - hadron scattering .",
    "the rest of the calculation is completely analogous to the `` long split '' calculation in the @xmath75 case .    thus using eqs .",
    "25,26 in @xcite we can write right away the differential cross section as    [ eq : dd31 t ] ^2 & = & \\ { _ [ 1]d_a^1,2(x_1,x_2;_13 ^ 2 , _",

    "the function @xmath84 now corresponds to the photon split into the charm anticharm pair .",
    "moreover , since we are looking for the production of the @xmath23 pair in the photon fragmentation region , we can neglect all processes except a possible emission of the compensating gluon by the @xmath85- quark .",
    "hence we obtain [ eq : termpt ] _ [ 1 ] d(x_1,x_2 ; q_1 ^ 2,q_2 ^ 2 ; ) = _ ^2^ r(z ) g^q_q(;q_1 ^ 2,k^2 ) g^q_q(;q_2 ^ 2,k^2 ) .",

    "the analysis was done for jet photoproduction in the realistic kinematics , of production of two pairs charm - gluon dijets with @xmath178 gev , and cut of @xmath0 , ensuring they are created mainly due to the direct photon mechanism .",
    "we considered these mpi processes for @xmath46 collisions at the lhec and hera and for @xmath2 and @xmath3 collisions at lhc and @xmath46 collisions at hera .",
    "we conclude that the studies would definitely be feasible at the lhec . in the case of the lhc",
    "the rates appear reasonable , and the key question is the efficiency of the lhc detectors .",
    "further studies of the feasibility of the measuring discussed processes at the lhc is highly desirable .",
    "here we just notice that since a larger fraction of charm in the discussed processes is produced at the central rapidities we expect the efficiency of the detection of the discussed process would be pretty high for atlas and cms .",
    "we thank the cern theory division for hospitality during the time the initial part of this work was done .",
