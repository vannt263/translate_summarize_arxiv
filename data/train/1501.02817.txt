    "a wide range of numerical methods have been developed to study the behaviour of quantum spin chains , including their critical behaviour , despite the difficulties in working with a hilbert space that grows exponentially in the chain length .",
    "numerical methods based on tensor networks@xcite have been highly successful in recent years as an efficient method for studying a wide range of spin lattice models . in particular , for one dimensional gapped systems , methods based on matrix product states are known to efficiently describe ground state properties@xcite . however , this behaviour does not generalise to gapless systems @xcite ( although c.f .  ) . for a tensor network description",
    "to naturally describe a critical spin chain , is should capture the area law violation , and one such description is the multiscale entanglement renormalisation ansatz @xcite ( mera ) .",
    "the mera has previously been shown to accurately and efficiently reproduce conformal data of critical spin chains@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we use the mera to numerically study three related spin models along a line of criticality : a staggered xxz model , a transverse field cluster model@xcite , and the quantum ashkin - teller model@xcite .",
    "these models are of interest because they have critical exponents that vary continuously as a function of model parameters .",
    "all three models possess an on - site @xmath0 symmetry that will play an important role in our analysis .",
    "for the first two models of interest , the critical line corresponds to a phase transition between a phase possessing nontrivial symmetry protected topological order ( spto ) for this symmetry group@xcite and a trivial phase .",
    "such systems are also of particular interest due to their connection to measurement - based quantum computation @xcite .",
    "there has been extensive investigation into symmetry protected topological phases , but only a few studies have investigated transitions out of them@xcite .",
    "such phase transitions are not part of the usual landau - ginsburg - wilson paradigm of phase transitions because there is no broken symmetry on either side of the transition . despite the fact that the models we consider here involve a transition between a fixed spto phase and the trivial phase , the boundary is described by a range of critical theories .",
    "in contrast , the ashkin - teller model possesses a conventional symmetry broken phase and for that model the phase transition of interest is between the symmetry broken and trivial phases .",

    "the thermodynamic limit of these three models at their critical points are described by a special class of cft , namely those with central charge @xmath1 .",
    "these cfts do not correspond to any member of the series of so - called _ minimal models _ that have been the main focus of numerical research that has used mera to study cfts@xcite .",
    "this class of cft is characterised by a renormalisation group with an exactly marginal field , leading to a single parameter family of theories that reproduces the continuously varying critical exponents of the underlying spin models . by varying the coupling in the spin models",

    "deformations by an exactly marginal operator lead to a new conformal fixed point . as the size of the deformation",
    "is varied , the conformal dimensions vary continuously . ]",
    "conformal field theories ( cfts ) are field theories that are invariant under all conformal ( angle preserving ) space - time transformations .",

    "it is interesting to note that close to the point @xmath125 the mera and the ed results agree with each other rather better than either one agrees with the cft values .",
    "this is the limit in which the finite size corrections to the eigenvalues for the spin chain , which are well understood for ed@xcite , increase in size due to an irrelevant primary field whose scaling dimension is approaching 2 .",
    "it would be an interesting avenue for further study to understand whether the errors in scaling dimensions obtained from mera simulations can be understood in a similar way to those of ed .",
    "we note that finite - size scaling has previously been performed for the ashkin - teller chain , in order to identify the primary fields for periodic and anti - periodic boundary conditions @xcite . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "our ed calculations use a system size equal to the largest used in all previous studies@xcite .",
    "here we have extended those calculations over a larger range of @xmath126 as well as extracted scaling dimensions for all rg relevant fields .",
    "another class of scaling operators present in the symmetric mera are the nonlocal operators involving a half infinite string of symmetry operators terminating in a local operator .",
    "the scaling dimensions of these operators in the cft arise in ed studies of the corresponding spin model with boundary conditions twisted by a group element . recall that the scaling dimension of these nonlocal operators can be obtained from mera simulations at negligible additional computational cost .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : atboundaries ] , we show these nonlocal scaling operators in the @xmath110 symmetry sector for two kind of twist ( corresponding to the two of the group elements of @xmath0 ) obtained from the mera simulation of the @xmath0 symmetric at model . note that fig .",
    "[ fig : atboundaries ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : localscalingdata ] show different data .",
    "the orbifold cft is such that the local ( untwisted ) spectrum in the four symmetry sectors is equivalent to the twisted spectrum in the @xmath110 sector .",
    "this equivalence is apparent by comparing fig .",
    "[ fig : localscalingdata]c ( d ) with fig .",
    "[ fig : atboundaries]b ( a ) .",
    "the deviation of the scaling dimensions of these nonlocal fields from the cft expectation appears to be comparable to that of the local fields .    ) . ]",
    "subgroup of the @xmath127 symmetry of the ashkin - teller model is enforced in the mera .",
    "this can lead to coupling between scaling operators which one would expect to be forbidden , in turn leading to avoided crossings in the conformal dimensions .",
    "this data has @xmath128 and 4 transitional layers . ]",
    "all the models considered here have a larger on - site symmetry than the enforced @xmath0 .",
    "in particular , the at model is invariant under swapping @xmath72 , leading to a nonabelian @xmath127 invariance .",
    "the symmetry group of the staggered xxz model contains an @xmath19 symmetry , for @xmath19 rotations of all spins about the @xmath35-axis , and a @xmath3 symmetry corresponding to @xmath40-flips around the @xmath15-axis , just as the free boson cft as described in sec .",
    "[ sec : cfts ] .",
    "this maps to an on - site symmetry in tfcm , but becomes a nonlocal symmetry in the ashkin - teller model unless the @xmath19 angle is @xmath40 ( in which case this symmetry reduces to the @xmath0 symmetry we have enforced ) .",
    "enforcing only a proper subgroup of the full symmetry means that the results of the mera simulations do not respect the full symmetry of the model .",
    "we note that this leads to avoided crossings in the conformal dimensions extracted from the simulations , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : avoidedcrossing ] .",
    "the two operators in this plot transform like different representations of @xmath127 , and so are forbidden to mix . under the @xmath0 subgroup used in our simulations , such a mixing is allowed , and is indeed observed .",
    "we expect this gap to close as the approximation is improved , leading to an approximately enforced @xmath127 .",
    "we also note that under the full conformal symmetry , all primary fields transform like different irreps , meaning they are all uncoupled .",
    "as the mera does not incorporate the full ( continuous ) conformal symmetry in its structure , any mera - based numerical method can not keep all such fields from mixing , and as such we expect avoided crossings to be observed even if the full on - site group is enforced .",
    "we also note that the choice of starting point for our adiabatic crawling method appears to have an effect on the accuracy of the resulting converged mera . specifically ,",
    "at values of @xmath13 or @xmath23 where previously irrelevant operators cross over to become relevant , increased errors arise that slowly die away as the simulation proceeds .",
    "a similar situation occurs when the scaling dimensions of two relevant operators cross as @xmath13 and @xmath23 are varied .",
    "crawling from multiple points , and stopping at crossings and when new operators become relevant may reduce this behaviour .      in this work ,",
    "we have made a choice of the bond dimensions @xmath129 and @xmath130 but we have investigated a range of @xmath82 values both higher and lower than this .",
    "these values were set by our available computational resources but we do not expect the essential conclusions to be altered by larger values of @xmath82 .",
    "the scaling of the error in the mera energy was investigated in and elsewhere and is one of the few quantitative methods of studying convergence of mera simulations reported in the literature . as discussed above",
    ", we can compare the energy of our mera simulation with the exact result available from the bethe ansatz solution and we also observe that for increased @xmath82 the error in the energy is reduced , as one would expect . indeed the error in fig .",
    "[ fig : gse ] is essentially the same size as reported in for the staggered heisenberg and xx models and the same value of @xmath82 so we believe that our simulations have comparable accuracy to other implementations of mera with comparable values of @xmath82 .",
    "we have also qualitatively studied the convergence of the smaller scaling dimensions and central charge to the values predicted by cft .",
    "the error in both decreases slowly with increasing @xmath82 , with the smallest scaling dimensions being recovered more accurately than those higher .",
    "the qualitative features we see in the spectra of scaling dimensions are also robust and observed over a range of choices of @xmath82 .",
    "for example the avoided crossings remain present even when increasing to @xmath131 .",
    "finally , we note that the deviation between the results obtained from the mera and the cft result as we approach the endpoint of the critical line corresponding to @xmath112 continues to persist even as @xmath82 is increased .",
    "in this work , we have used independently - developed scale invariant @xmath0 symmetric mera code to investigate critical quantum spin lattice models with this symmetry .",
    "specifically , we have used this to simulate the staggered xxz and transverse field cluster models , extracting conformal data consistent with the @xmath2 boson conformal field theory being the thermodynamic description of both spin chains .",
    "this @xmath1 theory has a parameter @xmath13 which can be varied , leading to continuously varying critical exponents , a behaviour which has been replicated in the mera .",
    "in addition , we have extracted conformal data for the ashkin - teller spin chain , identifying the @xmath3-orbifold boson as the appropriate cft .",
    "once again , the behaviour of the scaling fields with the parameter @xmath23 has been recovered , including the fixed sectors which are signatures of this theory .",
    "we have introduced a crawling method that allows for efficient optimisation of mera along the critical lines . by examining the symmetries of the three models ,",
    "we have identified some of the limitations of this technique , and how enforcing only a subgroup of the full symmetry is revealed in the conformal dimensions .",
    "we have also identified similarities between the numerical results of mera and exact diagonalisation , in the behaviour of errors at different regions along the critical line .",
    "we note that the staggered xxz and transverse field cluster models possess phases with nontrivial @xmath0 symmetry protected topological order .",
    "such phases support gapless edge modes that are protected by the symmetry , a property not shared by spt trivial phases@xcite . understanding the critical theory occurring at the transition between the trivial and spto phases",
    "may provide insight into the fate of these edge states at the phase transition and their properties within the phase@xcite .",
    "we have seen how tuning parameters in the spin models leads to continuous variation in the critical theory , despite the fact that we are investigating the transition from a single spt phase to a single trivial phase .",
    "recent developments of mera allow for the incorporation of conformal defects , including interfaces and boundaries@xcite .",
    "these numerical tools offer the possibility to study the gapless edge modes via the ` domain wall boundary conditions ' described in as well as interfaces between different spt phases@xcite .",
