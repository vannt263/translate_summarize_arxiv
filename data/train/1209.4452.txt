    "a _ triangulation _ of a two - dimensional space means a collection of ( full ) triangles covering the space , such that the intersection of any two triangles is either empty or consists of a vertex or of an edge .",
    "a triangle is called _ geodesic _ if all its edges are _ segments _ , i.e. , shortest paths between the corresponding vertices .",
    "we are interested only in _ geodesic triangulations _ , all the members of which are , by definition , geodesic triangles .",
    "the number of triangles in a triangulation is called its _ size_.    in rather general two - dimensional spaces , like alexandrov surfaces , two geodesics starting at the same point determine a well defined angle .",
    "our interest will be focused on triangulations which are _ acute _ ( resp .",
    "_ non - obtuse _ ) , which means that the angles of all geodesic triangles are smaller ( resp",
    ". not greater ) than @xmath0 .",
    "the discussion of acute triangulations has one of its origins in a problem of stover reported in 1960 by gardner in his mathematical games section of the _ scientific american _ ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "there the question was raised whether a triangle with one obtuse angle can be cut into smaller triangles , all of them acute . in the same year , independently , burago and zalgaller @xcite investigated in considerable depth acute triangulations of polygonal complexes , being led to them by the problem of their isometric embedding into @xmath1",
    ". however , their method could not give an estimate on the number of triangles used in the existed acute triangulations . in 1980 ,",
    "cassidy and lord  @xcite considered acute triangulations of the square .",

    "compact convex surfaces have also been triangulated .",
    "acute and non - obtuse triangulations of all platonic surfaces , which are surfaces of the five well - known platonic solids , have been investigated in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "recently , saraf @xcite considered the acute triangulations of the polyhedral surfaces again , but there is still no estimate on the size of the existed acute triangulations .",
    "maehara @xcite considered the proper acute triangulation of a polyhedral surface and obtained an upper bound of the size of the triangulation , which is determined by the length of the longest edge , the minimum value of the geodesic distance from a vertex to an edge that is not incident to the vertex , and the measure of the smallest face angle in the given polyhedral surface .",
    "furthermore , some other well - known surfaces have also been acutely triangulated , such as flat mbius strips @xcite and flat tori @xcite .    combining all the known results for the polyhedral surfaces mentioned above",
