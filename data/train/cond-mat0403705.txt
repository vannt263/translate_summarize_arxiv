    "the small - world effect occurs in complex networks @xcite that resemble regular lattices with a small density @xmath0 of `` shortcuts '' per site @xcite .",
    "the key observable is the shortest path length between two randomly chosen points , @xmath2 . defining a `` thermodynamic limit '' by @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the number of sites",
    ", one finds that for @xmath5 the network has the local structure of a regular lattice but some global properties of a random graph @xcite .",
    "in fact there is a _ critical point _",
    "@xcite at @xmath1 it separates regular lattices ( @xmath1 ) , for which the relative size of the shortest path length , @xmath6 , tends to some finite value , from lattices with finite density of shortcuts ( @xmath7 ) , for which @xmath8 .",
    "this quantity shows finite - size scaling @xcite : for @xmath9 it depends only on the scaling variable @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is a critical system size diverging algebraically at @xmath1 .",
    "a simple renormalisation group argument yields the critical exponent @xmath12 @xcite .    on the other hand",
    "it has been accepted for some time that conducting polymers must be thought of as complex networks @xcite .",
    "models have been studied in which a one - dimensional anderson insulator is perturbed by adding some additional connectivity in the form of a given density of chain `` crossings '' .",
    "it is well established that , when the density of crossings reaches a finite critical value , which depends on the amount of site - energy disorder , there is an anderson metal - insulator transition @xcite .",
    "this critical point results from the increase of the effective dimensionality of the network . it has also been demonstrated @xcite in a model having the geometry of the watts - strogatz ( ws ) small - world network @xcite .",
    "interestingly , even models of conducting polymers that lack site - energy disorder , so that the state of a single wire with no crossings is metallic , display non - trivial behaviour suggestive of proximity to a second - order phase transition @xcite .",
    "but there has been no detailed discussion of the nature of this critical point or its location on the phase diagram .",
    "here we shall provide evidence that it occurs when the density of crossings reaches zero and that its origin is the small - world effect .",
    "the rest of paper is organised as follows .",
    "first we introduce a simple _ model _ that generalises the `` winding chain '' of ref .",
    "@xcite and has the geometry of the newman - watts ( nw ) network @xcite , with the crossings acting as shortcuts",
    ". then we present results of full - spectrum numerical diagonalisation that demonstrate the _ small - world effect _ : a qualitative change of the spectrum and wave functions on the addition of a small density of shortcuts .",
    "we then use lanczos diagonalisation to study in detail , for much larger systems , the _ lower band edge_. we find finite - size scaling consistent with the critical behaviour of the network described in @xcite .",
    "simple analytical arguments are used to characterise the wave functions at the critical point .",
    "our conclusions are then laid out .",
    "we consider a single particle moving in a tight - binding lattice with one orbital per site .",
    "the site energy is equal on all @xmath4 sites",
    ". hopping can take place between nearest neighbours or between sites connected by one of @xmath13 shortcuts . for simplicity",
    "we assume the same value of the hopping integral , @xmath14 .",
    "the hamiltonian is@xmath15 where @xmath16 is a site label and @xmath17 denotes the shortcut connecting sites @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "we assume periodic boundary conditions : @xmath20 .",
    "note that @xmath14 is the only energy scale in the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) : the system s behaviour is thus completely specified by the way in which the @xmath13 shortcuts are chosen .",
    "one can imagine creating these shortcuts by winding an initially straight chain , embedded in a higher - dimensional space , in a random fashion .",
    "sites that were initially far apart may come close so tunnelling of the electron between these sites becomes possible .",
    "the model of conducting polymers in ref .",
    "@xcite is obtained by requiring that such winding is in the form of a series of consecutive , non - intersecting loops : @xmath21 ( except for the boundary conditions , which do not affect our argument ) . here we relax that restriction : our chain is `` tangled '' at random so that each of @xmath22 possible shortcuts ( excluding only shortcuts joining a site to itself or to a nearest neighbour ) is present with the same probability , @xmath23 the resulting topology is an instance of the nw network with critical exponent @xmath24 .    a similar hamiltonian , namely the adjacency matrix of the ws network , has been considered in @xcite .",
    "the authors of @xcite solved the time - dependent schrdinger equation , demonstrating the faster spread of initially localised wave functions on a small - world network compared to a regular lattice . in @xcite the eigenvalues and eigenvectors were obtained , as a means of characterising the networks geometry .",
    "our argument is based on a similar calculation .",
    "note , however , that our model has a distinct topology , compatible with the simple picture of a tangled chain  indeed the hamiltonian of @xcite is not of the form ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "moreover our specific aim is to identify critical behaviour near @xmath1 .    in our model",
    "the number of shortcuts , @xmath13 , is a random variable following the binomial distribution ( poisson for @xmath25 ) .",
    "evidently @xmath26 , where @xmath27 denotes a configurational average .",
    "for a finite size @xmath4 and a given set of shortcuts ( a `` realisation '' ) it is straightforward to diagonalise the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) numerically .",
    "one can then , by averaging over a finite number of realisations , @xmath28 , obtain a coarse - grained estimate of the configurationally averaged density of states ( dos ) , @xmath29 for a particular value of @xmath0 . here",
    "@xmath30 is the energy of the @xmath31 state .",
    "the main panel of fig .",
    "[ cap : dos ] shows the dos , estimated in this way , for several small values of @xmath0 .",
    "the curve for @xmath1 , given by the well - known formula @xmath32 is also shown .",
    "panels ( b ) and ( c ) illustrate the dependences of the numerical results on @xmath4 and on @xmath28 .",
    "they suggest that the dos is well defined in the thermodynamic limit ( [ eq : thermodynamic - limit ] ) , and that the plot on the main panel is representative of it , at this level of coarse - graining ( higher values of @xmath4 and @xmath28 would be required to describe the finer detail ) . at @xmath1 , the dos has the usual square - root singularities at the band edges . for @xmath33 ,",
    "the singularities survive in the form of pronounced maxima in the dos .",
    "this is similar to what was described for the model based on the ws network @xcite .",
    "also in common with that model , for @xmath34 ( not shown ) , the spectral density resembles that obtained by numerical diagonalisation of the adjacency matrices of uncorrelated random graphs .",
    "however the salient features of fig .",
    "[ cap : dos ] are two additional peaks outside the conduction band of the chain , located at @xmath35 .",
    "although this region of the spectrum becomes less populated as @xmath36 the position of the peaks does not change and they are present for any non - zero value of @xmath0 .",
    "they are a qualitative feature distinguishing the dos for @xmath1 from that for @xmath33 .    to explore further the nature of the states around these new peaks we can use numerical diagonalisation to obtain the inverse participation ratio ( ipr ; @xmath37 ) and higher - order moments of the local density distribution ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "these are given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the wave function of the @xmath41 state , evaluated on the @xmath42 site .",
    "for large enough values of @xmath4 , we expect the configurationally - averaged ipr to be given by a power law : @xmath43 the coefficient @xmath44 can be used to distinguish extended states ( @xmath45 ) from localised states ( @xmath46 ) and states with fractal dimension ( @xmath47 ) @xcite .",
    "[ cap : ipr - vs - energy ] shows our results .",
    "they suggest that , for @xmath48 , all states are fractal , but the wave functions with @xmath49 are much closer to localisation than those with @xmath50 , which are almost extended .",
    "note the strong fluctuations of the ipr at particular energies .",
    "the above results reflect that there are two quite different types of states .",
    "it is easy to show that the real eigenfunctions of ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) have the form@xmath51 for @xmath52 , where @xmath53 denotes the @xmath54 shortcut terminal ( i.e. @xmath55 or @xmath19 for some @xmath17 ) , ordered by ascending site index , and @xmath56 .",
    "the parameter @xmath57 and the corresponding energy @xmath58 can only take one of the following forms : @xmath59 ; @xmath60 ; @xmath61 .",
    "thus in the space between shortcut terminals states with @xmath50 are plane waves , with wave number @xmath62 , while those with @xmath63 decrease or grow exponentially at the rate @xmath64 .",
    "a particular case is the ground state of a large chain with a large , single loop , which has energy @xmath65 and is exponentially localised at the two shortcut terminals , with localisation length @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "the case with more than one shortcut terminal is more complex .",
    "a few wave functions for a particular realisation of our model , with @xmath67 shortcuts per site , are shown in fig .",
    "[ cap : wave - functions - polar ] .",
    "states with @xmath68 are exponentially localised on some of the shortcuts .",
    "their energy is very close to @xmath69 , but the degeneracy is broken by localising on different sets of shortcuts and by forming bonding and antibonding combinations between them .",
    "this leads to the broadening of the peaks in fig .",
    "[ cap : dos ] .",
    "states with @xmath70 resemble plane waves , except that their amplitude `` jumps '' at some of the shortcut terminals .",
    "the results presented above indicate a qualitative change of behaviour when @xmath0 becomes non - zero . in particular the gradual population of the energy peaks at @xmath35 is suggestive of a critical point at @xmath1 in the thermodynamic limit ( [ eq : thermodynamic - limit ] ) .",
    "this further implies the universal dependence of all observables on @xmath10 in the finite - size scaling regime ( [ eq : finite - size - scaling ] ) .",
    "the latter has been verified extensively for geometrical features of the nw and ws networks , such as the shortest path length and the clustering coefficient @xcite .",
    "here we are concerned with spectral properties and wave functions . to obtain data above and below the critical system size",
    "@xmath71 we need to consider very large systems . in this case",
    "it is best to use a sparse - matrix numerical algorithm @xcite .",
    "we employ @xcite which , for real symmetric matrices , is an implementation of the lanczos method . for computational economy ,",
    "given that we are now going to examine much larger system sizes , we concentrate on the single state at the lower band edge .    fig .  [ cap : lower - band - edge - e - and - ipr ] shows , for fixed @xmath0 , the dependence on @xmath4 of the configurational averages of the ground - state energy @xmath72 and of the moments of the density distribution for the ground state wave function , @xmath73 for finite conducting chains at fixed chemical potential , the average of @xmath74 gives a gross idea of how much the energy levels leak out , due to the presence of the shortcuts , below the bottom of the original conduction band .",
    "our main interest in this quantity , however , is that it displays critical behaviour quantitatively consistent with the small - world effect ( see below ) .",
    "there are four distinct regimes : for @xmath75 ( i ) most realisations do not contain any crossings , so @xmath76 and @xmath77 . for @xmath78 ( ii )",
    "the system is in a crossover region in which @xmath79 decreases and the @xmath80 increase with system size . for @xmath81 ( iii )",
    "the energy reaches a plateau and stays close to @xmath82 . in this regime",
    "most realisations have one or more shortcuts , but their terminals are quite far apart .",
    "the ground - state wave functions look like the one in fig .",
    "[ cap : wave - functions - polar ]  ( a ) .",
    "interestingly in this range of values of @xmath4 the @xmath80 decrease again . this is because although _ locally _ the wave function is exponentially localised on shortcut terminals , _ globally _ the crossings on which it chooses to localise can be quite spread over the network , and such spread becomes greater as the network grows in size and more and more crossings become available . finally for @xmath83 ( iv ) @xmath79 decreases and the @xmath80 turn to rise again .",
    "this indicates that in the thermodynamic limit ( [ eq : thermodynamic - limit ] ) the lower band edge is at @xmath84 and contains localised states , consistent with the lifshitz tails suggested by fig .",
    "[ cap : dos ] .    figs .",
    "[ cap : finite - size - scaling - of - ground - state - energy ] and [ cap : finite - size - scaling - of - the - inverse - participation - ratio ] show @xmath79 and the @xmath80 ( @xmath85 ) for very low values of @xmath0 , plotted as functions of the scaling variable @xmath86 . for @xmath87 crossings per site the data collapse to a single curve in the ranges of values of @xmath10 shown .",
    "the inset to fig .",
    "[ cap : finite - size - scaling - of - ground - state - energy ] and fig .",
    "[ cap : finite - size - scaling - of - the - inverse - participation - ratio ]  ( b ) show the same data for two higher values of @xmath0 .",
    "evidently the collapse is not so good .",
    "however there is a range of values of @xmath10 over which the data depend only on that variable which becomes wider as @xmath0 is lowered .",
    "clearly this widening finite - size scaling regime corresponds to the regions ii and iii identified above .",
    "+    the defining feature of the finite - size scaling regime is that , although the number of shortcuts on the network is arbitrary ( indeed @xmath88 ) , all shortcut terminals are well separated .",
    "the probability of this is @xmath89 \\label{eqpsep}\\ ] ] ( taking @xmath90 and using that the relevant length scale is @xmath91 ; see the appendix ) . evidently in the thermodynamic limit ( [ eq : thermodynamic - limit ] ) @xmath92 . on the other hand the finite - size scaling regime",
    "is reached when , for a given value of the scaling variable @xmath93 , the density of crossings @xmath0 is sufficiently low that @xmath94 . in this case shortcuts",
    "are not close enough to lift the degeneracy of the ground state and so the only possible energies are @xmath95 ( when there are no shortcuts ) and @xmath96 ( when there are one or more ) . since the probability of the former is @xmath97 ( for @xmath98 ) , with @xmath99 and @xmath100 defined in eqs .",
    "( [ eqn ] ) and ( [ eqp ] ) respectively , using @xmath101 we obtain the following exact analytical expression for the finite - size scaling law giving the configurational average of the ground - state energy:@xmath102 this is the curve plotted in fig .",
    "[ cap : finite - size - scaling - of - ground - state - energy ] alongside the numerical data .",
    "let us now deploy a similar argument for the moments @xmath80 .",
    "suppose that , for a given realisation , having @xmath13 shortcuts , the wave function were exponentially localised around a single site @xmath103 : @xmath104 .",
    "then the moments at the lower band edge would be given by @xmath105 in actual fact the wave function is localised around @xmath106 sites , corresponding to the terminals of @xmath107 shortcuts .",
    "since the sites @xmath108 of the terminals are all well separated we can derive ( see the appendix ) @xmath109}.",
    "\\label{eqpn0}\\ ] ] let us assume that @xmath110 depends only on @xmath13 and postulate a power law : @xmath111 . then using the poisson distribution we obtain@xmath112 which gives the finite - size scaling of the moments @xmath80 .",
    "it is important to note however that this expression , unlike ( [ eq : ground - state - energy - analytical ] ) , contains an adjustable parameter @xmath113 .",
    "depending on its value it can describe very different behaviours .",
    "indeed for @xmath114 ( i.e. requiring that the wave function is exponentially localised always on the same fraction of the shortcuts ) we have@xmath115 where @xmath116 is euler s constant and @xmath117 is the exponential integral . for large @xmath10 ,",
    "we have @xmath118 ( more generally @xmath119 ) corresponding to a state which , although exponentially localised at the _ local _ level , is extended _ globally _ over the whole network .",
    "conversly for @xmath120 ( i.e. the wave function is exponentially localised always on a single shortcut ) we obtain @xmath121 for large @xmath10 , i.e. the wave function is localised in the true sense of the word .",
    "the dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ cap : finite - size - scaling - of - the - inverse - participation - ratio ]  ( a ) represent these two extreme cases . on the other hand the data are fitted quite accurately by using three different intermediate values of @xmath113 for @xmath85 , respectively .",
    "this is represented by the solid curves in fig .",
    "[ cap : finite - size - scaling - of - the - inverse - participation - ratio ] .",
    "it suggests that the _ global _ structure of the wave function at the lower band edge is _ multifractal _ in the finite - size scaling regime .",
    "in summary we have studied a simple model of conducting polymers in which chain crossings act as shortcuts for the electrons , so they move in a small - world topology .",
    "our results are based on numerical diagonalisation ( full spectrum for systems of size @xmath122 and lanczos for @xmath123 ) and some simple analytical arguments .",
    "we have seen that a small density of shortcuts @xmath0 leads to qualitative , but continuous changes in the dos and wave functions .",
    "the former take the form of new peaks appearing at well defined positions @xmath35 outside the initial conduction band , @xmath50 . at these peaks ,",
    "the wave functions have a non - trivial structure .",
    "we have investigated in detail the lower band edge , confirming through finite - size scaling that there is a critical point at @xmath1 .",
    "the critical exponent of the correlation length is consistent with criticality due to the small - world effect .",
    "we have derived analytical expressions for the scaling laws of the energy and the ipr and higher moments of the density distribution .",
    "the latter expressions contain an adjustable parameter @xmath113 describing the global structure of the wave function , which we find to be multifractal .",
    "we end by making two additional remarks .",
    "firstly , the critical point described here is quite distinct from the dimensionality - driven anderson transition considered before @xcite .",
    "the latter occurs at a finite critical density of crossings @xmath124 , which depends on the amount of site - energy disorder @xmath125 .",
    "since real highly conducting polymers are intrinsically disordered @xcite the small - world critical point at @xmath1 is not directly accessible to experiments .",
    "nevertheless it may make a significant contribution to conductance fluctuations in the metallic state .",
    "secondly , the multifractality of the wave functions suggests that the adjacency matrices of small - world networks might be describable by the power law banded matrix ensemble @xcite of random matrix theory .",
