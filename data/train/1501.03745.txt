    "fluctuation spectra and spectra of response to periodic driving are major tools of characterizing physical systems .",
    "the spectra are conventionally used to find system frequencies and relaxation rates and to characterize fluctuations in the system .",
    "for example , optical absorption spectra give the transition frequencies of atomic systems and the lifetimes of the excited states , and the spectrum of spontaneous radiation is a well - known example of the fluctuation ( power ) spectrum @xcite .",
    "in macroscopic systems the spectra are often complicated by the effects of inhomogeneous broadening .",
    "recent progress in nanoscience has made it possible to study the spectra of individual dynamical systems .",

    "a familiar effect of weak periodic driving is forced vibrations of the system . when ensemble - averaged , they are also periodic and occur at the driving frequency @xmath0 .",
    "they lead to a @xmath1-shape peak at frequency @xmath0 in the system power spectrum .",
    "however , the driving also modifies the power spectrum away from @xmath0 .",
    "a textbook example is inelastic light scattering and resonance fluorescence . in the both cases ,",
    "the system driven by a periodic electromagnetic field emits radiation at frequencies that differ from the driving frequency @xcite .",
    "this radiation is one of the major sources of information about the system in optical experiments .    in this paper",
    "we study the spectra of periodically driven nonlinear systems .",
    "we show that , in the presence of noise , along with the @xmath1-shape peak at the driving frequency @xmath0 , these spectra display a characteristic structure .",
    "we are interested in the regime of relatively weak driving , where the driving - induced change of the power spectrum is quadratic in the amplitude of the driving , as in inelastic light scattering .    in view of the significant interest in the power spectra of systems optically trapped in fluids , we consider systems where inertial effects play no role . in the absence of driving the power spectra of such systems",
    "usually have a peak at zero frequency .",
    "in particular it is this peak that is used to characterize the dynamics of optically trapped particles .    for a linear system , like a brownian particle in a harmonic trap ,",
    "the @xmath1-shape peak at @xmath0 is the only effect of the driving on the power spectrum .",
    "this is because motion of such a system is a linear superposition of forced vibrations at @xmath0 and fluctuations in the absence of driving .",
    "the amplitude and phase of the forced vibrations depend on the parameters of the system and determine the standard linear susceptibility @xcite",
    ". in nonlinear systems forced vibrations become random , because the parameters of the system are fluctuating .",
    "the power spectrum of such random vibrations is no longer just a @xmath1-shape peak ( although the @xmath1-shape peak is necessarily present ) .",
    "the driving - induced spectral features away from @xmath0 result from mixing of fluctuations and forced vibrations in a nonlinear system .",
    "we note the close relation of these features to inelastic light scattering , see [ app_susceptibility ] .",
    "the idea of the driving - induced change of the power spectrum can be gained by looking at a brownian particle fluctuating in a confining potential , a typical situation for optical trapping .",
    "the motion of the particle , after proper rescaling of time and particle coordinate @xmath2 , is described by the langevin equation @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the scaled potential and @xmath5 is thermal noise .",
    "if potential @xmath4 is parabolic and the system is additionally driven by a force @xmath6 , forced vibrations are described by the textbook expression @xmath7^{-1},\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the equilibrium position [ the minimum of @xmath4 ] and @xmath10 is the susceptibility .    for a nonlinear system",
    "the potential @xmath4 is nonparabolic . because of thermal fluctuations , the local curvature of the potential @xmath11 is fluctuating . intuitively , one can think of the effect of thermal fluctuations on forced vibrations as if @xmath12 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : trivial_susceptibility ] ) for the susceptibility were replaced by a fluctuating curvature , see fig .",
    "[ fig : fluct_potential ] .",
    "if the driving frequency @xmath0 largely exceeds the reciprocal correlation time of the fluctuations @xmath13 , the fluctuations would lead to the onset of a structure in the power spectrum near frequency @xmath0 with typical width @xmath13 .",
    "the quantity @xmath13 also gives the typical width of the peak in the power spectrum at zero frequency in the absence of driving [ for a linear system , @xmath14 .",
    "another effect of the interplay of driving , nonlinearity , and fluctuations can be understood by noticing that the periodic force causes a periodic change in the system coordinate . for a nonlinear system , roughly speaking , this leads to a periodic modulation of the local curvature , and thus of @xmath13 .",
    "since @xmath13 determines the shape of the zero - frequency peak in the power spectrum , such modulation causes a change of this peak proportional to @xmath15 , to the lowest order in @xmath16 .    even from the above simplistic description it is clear that the driving - induced change of the spectrum is sensitive to the parameters of the system and the noise and to the nonlinearity mechanisms .",
    "explicit examples given below demonstrate this sensitivity and suggest that the effects we discuss can be used for characterizing a system beyond the conventional linear analysis .",
    "after formulating how the power spectrum can be evaluated in section  [ sec : general ] , we demonstrate the effects of the interplay of driving and fluctuations for three very different types of nonlinear systems : an overdamped brownian particle ( section  [ sec : brownian_particle ] ) , a system that switches at random between coexisting stable states ( section  [ sec : two_state ] ) , and a threshold detector ( section  [ sec : threshold ] ) .",
    "all these systems are of broad interest , and all of them display a significant driving - induced change of the power spectrum .",
    "we consider fluctuating systems driven by a periodic force @xmath17 and assume that fluctuations are induced by a stationary noise , like in the case of an optically trapped brownian particle , for example . after a transient time",
    "such system reaches a stationary state .",
    "the stationary probability distribution of the system with respect to its dynamical variable @xmath2 , @xmath18 , is periodic in time @xmath19 with the driving period @xmath20 .",
