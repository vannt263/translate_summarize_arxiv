    "the greatest achievement of physical cosmology is , up to now , the big bang standard model .",
    "this model is based on two principles which are consistent with large ",
    "scale observations : the _ cosmological principle _ and the _ universal time principle_. the first postulates that the universe space - section @xmath0 is homogeneous and isotropic ; the latter states that the topology of the space - time four - dimensional manifold @xmath1 is the direct product  @xmath2 , and results from the adoption of a cosmological time as parameter of the manifold foliation @xcite .",
    "these principles lead   @xcite to the friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) interval . ]",
    "@xmath3 \\text{\\ \\ \\ } \\left ( k=0,\\pm 1\\right ) ~.   \\label{zero1}\\]]on the other hand , the source terms are described by the perfect fluid energy - momentum tensor .",
    "this tensor @xmath4 and the above interval , when substituted into the einstein s equations of general relativity @xmath5(with a cosmological  constant @xmath6term ) lead to the friedmann equations for the scale factor @xmath7 : @xmath8the solution for @xmath7  is obtained after inserting in these equations the constitutive relation between the pressure @xmath9  and the energy - density @xmath10  of the cosmic source fluid .    the relation between @xmath9 and @xmath10 is given directly by an _ equation of state _ ( eos ) of type @xmath11 , or indirectly via the _ distribution functions_. either way , here are implicitly in use the methods of statistical mechanics ( sm ) , which can , for pedagogical purposes , be divided into two branches @xcite : equilibrium sm , with its ensemble technique and its partition functions ; and non - equilibrium sm , whose distribution function entail , for example , kinetic equations as the boltzmann and the vlassov - landau equations .",
    "the distribution function are not only useful to describe systems out of equilibrium , but also systems in thermodynamical equilibrium , to which a temperature can be attributed .",
    "the ensemble approach , however , can only be applied to systems in equilibrium .",
    "cosmology uses both sections of statistical mechanics , e.g. : the eos obtained from a partition function leads to the description of the radiation  dominated era in the thermal history of the universe and leads also to the @xmath6cdm model for the present - day cosmic dynamics @xcite ; the distribution functiondetermined from boltzmann equations are used in the perturbative cosmological models describing the cosmic microwave background anisotropies , as well as the formation of structures  @xcite .",
    "but the fact is that , perturbative or not , * the present formulation of cosmology does not take into account the interactions between the constituents as direct sources of gravitation*. only kinematical terms are computed in the ordinary ( non - perturbed ) cosmological models , interactions being just used to explain pair - production and thermalization ; the dynamical terms which could be introduced via particle - to - particle potentials or through the s - matrix  are simply forgotten .",
    "even the perturbative approach  @xcite considers the interaction so insufficiently that the pressure function appearing in the expression of the energy - momentum tensor  presents kinematical terms solely @xcite .    in section [ sec - falta ]",
    ", we shall make explicit the absence of dynamical terms ( interaction terms ) both in the conventional cosmological models developed under the hypothesis of thermodynamical equilibrium  with their typical eos  and in the perturbative models ( out of equilibrium )  built on the distribution functions .",
    "based on the statistical mechanics of systems with interactions balescu , pat we discuss , in section [ sec - inclusao ] , how to include those terms in cosmology .",
    "section [ sec - exemplo ] presents a toy - model which shows the decisive influence that interaction terms can have on cosmic evolution .",
    "the conclusions are summed up in section [ sec - dis .",
    "this section deals , in the context of the standard model , with an ideal source cosmic fluid , interactions between components being supposed absent .",
    "we leave to the next section the discussion about the real need for the inclusion of interaction terms in some phases of the universe evolution .",
    "first , it is important to establish the period during which equilibrium statistical mechanics is applicable .",
    "this is restricted by the fact that the universe , described by the frw metric ( [ zero1 ] ) , is growing up    the volume containing the cosmic fluid is expanding . in the primeval universe ( @xmath12 mev , where @xmath13 is the boltzmann constant ) , the typical reaction rates @xmath14  involving the different constituents are much larger than the expansion rate @xmath15 @xcite , i.e.@xmath16for the energy values then prevalent the thermodynamic notion of _ quasi - static expansion _ holds : for each infinitesimal variation of volume , all constituents of the fluid are at the same temperature    they keep themselves in thermal equilibrium .",
    "notice in advance that , as the curvature is negligible @xmath17 all along the text . ] in the early universe , the ordinary statistical mechanics defined on euclidean 3-space @xmath18 can be used .",
    "we emphasize that eq.(zero2 ) is valid even during an accelerated expansion .",
    "the components of the cosmic fluid will decouple progressively as the temperature decreases @xcite .",
    "a natural question turns up : once decoupled from the other fluid components , will a given particular component remain in thermal equilibrium  ?",
    "this question is better formulated in terms of the component distribution function : is there an equilibrium distribution function for the decoupled component valid in general in an expanding plane space  ?",
    "the answer is no @xcite .",
    "the proof of this statement is not trivial , but it is related to the fact that we do not have spatially constant time - like killing vectors in plane frw space - times @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it is possible to construct distribution functions for the expanding space in particular cases , as in the presence of non - relativistic and ultrarelativistic components .",
    "this is comforting enough since , from the early to the present - day universe , the decoupling stable particles are either ultrarelativistic  photons and neutrinos  or non - relativistic ( baryonic and dark matter ) .",
    "we are therefore allowed to use equilibrium sm when working with this content .",
    "the non - equilibrium treatment will be required only for perturbative approximations .",
    "next sub - section deals specifically with the description given by the cosmological models in thermodynamical equilibrium , and [ sec - outequil]discuss the models with components out of equilibrium .",
    "the classical cosmology text - books , e.g. @xcite , teach us how to determine the pressure @xmath19 , the energy density @xmath20 and the numerical density @xmath21 of the @xmath22-th component of the fluid in thermal equilibrium :    @xmath23    where @xmath24 is the degeneracy degree ; @xmath25 , the dispersion relation    @xmath26    and @xmath27 the distribution functions given by@xmath28the lower ( upper ) sign refers to the fermi - dirac ( bose - einstein ) statistics .",
    "the sum over all the @xmath22 components is taken into the friedmann equations ( [ quinze a dot ] , [ quinze a ddot ] ) .",

    "conversely , if we take the non - relativistic limit @xmath40 in the same eqs.([dois ] , [ tres ] ) and neglect quantum effects , it results    @xmath41    the quantum effects will be negligible if the condition @xmath42 is satisfied , @xmath43 being the thermal wavelength    @xmath44    this will hold when no particle invades any other s effective volume , of which a rough estimate is @xmath45 : this is the meaning of the condition above .",
    "pressure @xmath9 only appears in the friedmann equations added to @xmath10 .",
    "if we consider @xmath40 , eqs.([onze ] , [ doze ] ) will say that@xmath46is a very good approximation for the equation of state for non - relativistic matter @xmath47 ( the dust approximation ) .    the friedmann equations , together with ( [ dez ] ) and ( [ treze ] ) , enable us to calculate simplified , but analytic , solutions for the universe evolution determined by @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "present - day universe , for example , is well described by the solution obtained  after inserting eos ( [ treze ] ) in ( [ quinze a dot ] , [ quinze a ddot ] ) , keeping @xmath6 non - null , and neglecting the contribution of radiation    the so - called @xmath6cdm model .",
    "for the early universe , period during which radiation dominates , the suitable eos is ( [ dez ] ) .",
    "anyway , neither the eos simpler forms ( [ dez ] , [ treze ] ) nor the complete expressions , eqs.([sete ] , [ oito ] , [ nove ] ) , take interactions between the constituents into account . partition function ( seis ) includes all the possible states of the @xmath22-th component in an _ ideal _ gas , of _ non - interacting _ fermionic ( or bosonic ) relativistic particles . the first term of series ( [ seis ] ) refers to the classical description ( boltzmann statistics ) , while the others are order - by - order quantum corrections .",
    "we shall see in section [ sec - inclusao ] that the expression of the partition function in terms of a series suggests a mechanism of inclusion of the interactions order by order .",
    "we remind the reader that our interest here is to analyze eos based on first principles ; eqs.([dez ] ) and ( [ doze ] ) are examples of this class .",
    "we shall exclude any eos used in the context of cosmology constructed on phenomenological basis , as eos for scalar fields  caldavestein , stein , zlatev , fraros , pera , eos for the chaplygin gas  fabris et al , alca jain , avelino et al , amendola et al , bento et al and van der walls eos  @xcite , to mention but a few .",
    "as said before , the use of non - equilibrium statistical mechanics is essentially required only in perturbative cosmology . according to dod , ber ,",
    "perturbations on the frw metric come from interactions between the components of the cosmic fluid as described by the boltzmann equation , @xmath48~ ,   \\label{dezesseis}\\]]where @xmath49  is the distribution function of the @xmath22-th component and @xmath50 $ ] is the collision term for the @xmath51 pair of components .",

    "the energy - momentum tensor is obtained as @xmath58where @xmath59 is the comoving momentum encapsulating , of course , the energy and the tri - momentum @xmath60 , @xmath61as sources in einstein s equations , @xmath62 is the energy density ( dois ) and @xmath63  is the pressure ( [ tres ] ) . at first sight",
    "one could think that the boltzmann equation ( [ dezesseis ] ) introduces interaction terms as direct sources of gravitation , but in fact the usual pressure expression only partially considers dynamical ( interaction ) effects .",
    "interactions are taken into account only indirectly , through deformations in the distribution functions @xmath49 and @xmath64 . nevertheless , the distributions used are those of free particles .",
    "an example of dynamical pressure appears in the van der walls equation @xmath65 in which @xmath66 and @xmath67 ber are constants phenomenologically fitted for each gas .",
    "it can not be obtained from ( [ dezoito ] ) .",
    "let us see in more detail what happens .",
    "the deduction of the boltzmann equation uses the fact that the number of pairs of particles with velocities @xmath68 and @xmath69 at time @xmath70 is@xmath71on the other hand , statistical mechanics tells us that this is true only when the correlations between particles are negligible .",
    "in fact , the number of pairs of particles with velocities @xmath68 and @xmath69 is determined by the two - particle distribution function @xmath72and , in general , @xmath73    the @xmath74-particle distribution function @xmath75  may be expressed as @xcite@xmath76@xmath77 determines the complete correlation degree of the system . for practical reasons ,",
    "it is convenient to split the set of @xmath74 particles in all the possible disjoint subsets containing at least one particle , i.e.@xmath78etc . in these equations @xmath49 is the one - particle distribution function ;  @xmath79 is the two - particle distribution function , and so on .",
    "this is the _ cluster _",
    "expansion formalism , function @xmath80  being the irreductible correlation function of @xmath81 particles .",
    "these are the functions describing interactions . for example",
    ", the van der walls equation can be obtained from the two - particle correlation @xmath82  and a couple of suitable approximations .",
    "notice that , in spite of @xmath49 being always positive , the function @xmath83 is not necessarily so .",
    "this fact is exemplified by eq.([dezenove ] ) , where the relative values of @xmath66 and @xmath67 determines if the pressure is positive or negative .    a remark : the attentive reader will have noticed that in the passage from ( [ vinte dois ] ) to ( [ vinte tres ] ) the dependence on @xmath68  has been supressed .",
    "that is because the correlation functions usually depends only on the position .",
    "the @xmath84 depend both on position and velocity , but the sector correspondent to the velocities may be separated , resulting in non - correlated distribution functions @xmath85 .",
    "figure 1  shows schematically the correspondence between the distribution functions and the clusters for a three - particle system .",
    "the distribution functions for a @xmath74-particle system are determined , order by order , by a hierarchical set of equations known as bbgky ",
    "after bogoliubov , born , green , kirkwood and yvon @xcite .",
    "the boltzmann equation is itself an approximation of the bbgky  system reducing this set of linear coupled equations to just one non - linear equation . considering interaction in this equation",
    "will solely modify the one - particle distribution functions @xmath49 .",
    "the statistical systems modeled by boltzmann equation do not exhibit correlation terms in the distribution functions .",
    "therefore , the thermodynamical quantities , like pressure , do not present dynamical terms .",
    "this leads to the conclusion that the usual approach of perturbative cosmology does not compute interaction processes as direct sources of gravitation",
    ".    we shall below discuss in which periods of cosmic history interaction should effectively contribute to gravitation , and how to include it .",
    "qualitatively , the cosmic fluid can be separated into three different sectors : a kinetic part @xmath86 , associated to velocities ; a dynamical component @xmath87 , related to interactions ; and a massive contribution @xmath47 coming from the rest mass of the constituents .",
    "the condition for the interaction being a relevant source is@xmath88where @xmath89  indicates a given cosmological period .",
    "as far as interactions are concerned , each period presents its own characteristics .",
    "we will deal with two of then : the pre - nucleosynthesis cosmological universe ( pnu ) ",
    "@xmath90 mev or red - shift @xmath91  and the recent universe  red - shift @xmath92 .    in the pnu , the high temperature of the fluid warrants the existence of a large variety of particles , such as @xmath93 , most of then interacting mutually .",
    "the answer to the question about the relevance of interactions for the primeval cosmology comes from an involved analysis of the interacting fluid as a whole : the interaction terms may be positive or negative , depending on the nature of the interaction , and global cancellation may possibly turn up .",
    "recent data from rhic ( _ relativistic heavy ion collider _ )",
    "@xcite indicates that a fluid at very high temperatures ( few hundreds of mev ) presents a strong interaction between its constituents , even possibly generating a liquid  state for the hadronic matter , the cgc ( _ color glass condensate _ ) @xcite .",
    "quantum chromodynamics suggests that this system is constituted basically by three quarks ( @xmath94 ) and gluons . in this energy range  which corresponds to the pnu  the strong interaction between quarks ( generically , @xmath95 )",
    "overcome their kinetic and rest energies .",
    "we have , so , @xmath96 . even then , the primordial cosmic fluid has others species that should be considered when applying criterion ( [ vinte sete ] ) . in section [ sec - exemplo ]",
    "we exhibit a very simplified model , introducing interaction terms , to describe the pre - nucleosynthesis cosmological universe .    among the various components of the recent universe ,",
    "one of the most important for its evolution is non - relativistic matter .",
    "indeed , at the present - day time @xmath97 ( red - shift @xmath98 ) , the rest mass of this component @xmath99 corresponds to about @xmath100 of the universes total content wmap , and , as we go back in time , it becomes more and more relevant suno .",
    "non - relativistic matter responds to the newtonian gravitational interaction @xmath101  responsible for structure formation and evolution , and the experimental data indicates the influence of the potential is more effective as @xmath102 diminishes ( i.e. , the structures grow ) @xcite . as the kinetic term @xmath103 is negligible  compared to @xmath104 , the importance of the gravitational interaction @xmath101 is measured by its direct comparison with @xmath104 .",
    "the newtonian potential is a long range interaction and one could ask whether it can decisively contribute with dynamical terms that could influence the present day cosmic behavior .",
    "we will not study this subject in the present work , but only mention three effects controlling its importance :    1 .   as the scale factor @xmath105  grows ,",
    "so does the interaction distance @xmath106 ( where @xmath107  is the comoving distance ) , reducing the cosmological contribution of @xmath101 .",
    "2 .   during a decelerated ( accelerated ) expansion , the comoving horizon increases ( decreases ) consequently increasing ( decreasing ) the global effects of @xmath101 .",
    "3 .   the basic constituents of the universe are different at each phase of the universe evolution , starting with fundamental particles ( nucleons , etc . ) , passing to hydrogen clouds and then to galaxies and clusters .",
    "let us return to the analysis of the pre - nucleosynthesis cosmological period .",
    "next section presents a prescription to include interaction in that period .",
    "the inclusion of interactions via eos can be done by the ensemble formalism through the perturbative treatment of real gases .",
    "mayer and collaborators developed in 1937 the systematic approach of cluster expansion for a non - relativistic classical ( non - quantum ) system  @xcite . just after that , in 1938 , kahn and uhlenbeck began the generalization of this method to non - relativistic quantum statistics @xcite , and , in 1960 , lee and yang improved the treatment to describe , in principle , all the perturbation orders @xcite .",
    "finally , in 1969 , dashen , ma and bernstein extended this method to a relativistic quantum system where the interactions are computed through the @xmath108 matrix  dashen .",
    "each one of these treatments apply to a different statistical system , but all of them were constructed so as to be valid on a plane static space - time .",
    "this prevents their straight application to cosmology , where one needs to consider the possibility of a curved manifold .",
    "this means that the perturbation methods for modeling real gases are valid only if the space - section of the universe is plane , and the expansion is of the quasi - static type . and these requirements , as said in section [ sec - falta ] , are fulfilled in the pre - nucleosynthesis universe ( @xmath90 @xmath109 ) .",
    "according to the cluster expansion technique , the grand canonical potential for a one - component fluid is@xmath110the @xmath111 are the _ cluster integrals _ and encapsulate all the information about the interaction processes .",
    "the appendix is a _",
    "resum _ on cluster expansions , with the differences between classical and quantum systems particularly emphasized .",
    "the first cluster integrals for the non - relativistic classical system are    @xmath112 d^{3}r_{1}d^{3}r_{2}d^{3}r_{3 } , \\label{vinte nove_c}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath43 is the thermal wavelength , @xmath113 is the degeneracy degree and    @xmath114    are the mayer functions .",
    "notice that in the classical case the interaction is introduced through the interparticle potential @xmath115 .",
    "though the system is nonrelativistic , the rest mass is already included in the @xmath111 through the factors @xmath116 .",
    "these are not considered by the traditional texts on non - relativistic statistical mechanics , but they are necessary in the derivation of coherent cosmological energy density .",
    "the pressure and the numerical density are not affected by these factors .",
    "dashen , ma and berstein @xcite have shown that the general form of the coefficients @xmath111  for a rqs is given in terms of the s - matrix as@xmath117where @xmath118  is the cluster integral of the non - interacting quantum theory , @xmath119 is the symmetrization operator , @xmath120  is the on - shell s - matrix operator @xcite , and @xmath121  stands for all the @xmath74-particle connected diagrams . we are using the definition@xmath122see the appendix for further details .    once the grand canonical potential ( [ vinte oito ] ) is obtained , it is straightforward to calculate the pressure ( [ sete ] ) , the numerical density ( [ oito ] ) and the energy density ( [ nove ] )  as functions of the temperature and the fugacity :    @xmath123    these equations are the one - component fluid eos in parametric form .    an alternative description is obtained if everything is rewritten in terms of the numerical density after inversion of the @xmath124 series .",
    "the result is the _ virial expansion _ ,    @xmath125    where @xmath126 and @xmath127 are , respectively , the virial coefficients for the pressure and the energy density .",
    "they are completely determined by the @xmath128 .",
    "for instance , the first three terms are :    @xmath129    the question asking for an answer now is : what is the most suitable set of eos for cosmology , eqs.([trinta dois_a ] , [ trinta dois_b ] , trinta dois_c ) or ( [ trinta tres_a ] , [ trinta tres_b ] ) ? the following comments will help to determine the preferred set .",
    "the great advantage of writing the eos in form of series is the possibility of approximating them by their first terms .",
    "whenever series are involved , something must be said about their _",
    "convergence_. the sets of eos ( [ trinta dois_a ] , [ trinta dois_b ] , [ trinta dois_c ] ) and ( trinta tres_a , [ trinta tres_b ] ) are equivalent when all the terms of their series are considered ; but that equivalence ceases to exist when the series are truncated at a given order . the convergence of the sets @xmath130 and @xmath131 depends critically on the interaction processes at play and , in consequence , on the cosmological period under consideration .",
    "all the relevant particles for the dynamics of the pnu are born through pair - production at high temperatures ( from one tenth to hundreds of mev ) .",
    "each of the species will have  @xcite a nearly vanishing ( total ) chemical potential @xmath132 and , therefore , a fugacity close to one , @xmath133 .",
    "consequently , @xmath102 is not a good expansion parameter for a series .    on the other hand ,",
    "the expansions of @xmath134 and @xmath135 describe with great accuracy rarefied non - relativistic gases .",
    "indeed , using the lennard - jones potential , the correction @xmath136 leads to an eos that fits the experimental curves @xmath137  for several gases with very good precision @xcite .",
    "this is a strong physical argument in favor of the set @xmath131 and indicates that the associated series are well - defined .",
    "there is another reasoning suggesting the convergence of the series in @xmath138 : the virial coefficients @xmath126 and @xmath127 are evaluated from a subclass of connected diagrams , the _ _ irreducible diagrams  _ _ @xcite . in the classical case , the irreducible diagrams are easily detectable",
    ", since they are _ multipy connected _ , i.e. , each particle connects to at least other two .",
    "for example , coefficient @xmath139 , given by ( [ vinte nove_c ] ) , is constructed from all the four diagrams shown in the right of figure 2 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath140 and @xmath141 , however , depend solely on the last diagram of figure 2 .",
    "the first can be written as@xmath142[both in ( [ trinta cinco ] ) and ( [ trinta seis ] ) we are supposing that the potential depends only on the interparticle distance , @xmath143 . ]",
    "this restriction on the diagrams for the non - relativistic classical system favors the virial expansion against the series in the fugacity .",
    "it is to be expected that convergence is better achieved by the virial expansion .    in view of these arguments",
    ", we choose the set composed by @xmath134 and @xmath135 as the most convenient for computing interactions in the pre - nucleosynthesis cosmological universe .",
    "nevertheless , even this set presents a validity limit .",
    "the perturbative methods do not apply to dense systems ( with high values of @xmath138 ) or to systems submitted to long - range interactions . in such cases",
    "the eos must be found by other methods .    in next section",
    ", we will construct a toy - model in order to exhibit some possible effects in the evolution of the universe when interaction between the source components is taken into account .",
    "we shall also argue in favor of the convergence of the series @xmath134 in this particular example , comparing with the behavior of the expansion @xmath144 .",
    "in our toy - model the primeval interacting fluid is constituted only by photons and nucleons coming from pair production .",
    "the photons @xmath145 will be treated in the usual manner as utra - relativistic ideal bosons , and the nucleons @xmath74  will be considered non - relativistic interacting classical particles .",
    "the interaction processes taken into account are :    1 .   creation and annihilation of the nucleons @xmath74  in the thermal bath , @xmath146 .",
    "this reaction generates the mean numerical density of nucleons @xmath147 and anti - nucleons @xmath148 . in a purely classical context",
    ", this process does not take place . here",
    ", it serves only as a source of the interacting particles , which are treated classically as soon as they come into existence .",
    "nucleons affecting nucleons through a ( very simplified ) nuclear potential .",
    "the electromagnetic interaction cancels out globally since the numerical density of nucleons are identical to that of anti - nucleons @xmath149  ( debye scenery ) .",
    "weak interaction is several order of magnitude less effective than the strong interaction and it is consequently neglected .    for simplicity",
    ", we admit that the interactions @xmath150 , @xmath151 and @xmath152 are described by the same nuclear potential ( charge independence of the strong interaction ) , and that the internal degrees of freedom come from spin and isospin .",
