    "are realized in the peripheral collisions of relativistic heavy ions and possibly in the interior of neutron stars .",
    "thus , it is also phenomenologically important to improve our understanding of qcd under strong magnetic fields .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss hadron masses under strong magnetic fields .",
    "recent lattice studies @xcite calculated @xmath5 meson masses and observed that ( i ) not only charged meson masses @xmath6 but also neutral meson masses @xmath7 depend on the strength of magnetic fields @xmath4 ; ( ii ) @xmath8 increase as @xmath9 while @xmath10 show weak @xmath4-dependence ; ( iii ) there is a mass hierarchy @xmath11 for @xmath12 .",
    "so far two phenomenological studies employing a relativistic hamiltonian technique @xcite and the nambu - jona - lasinio model @xcite have been done to explain these non - trivial behaviors . however , there is no consensus on the physical reason why there is such non - trivial behaviors .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to present a simple analytical model which clearly explains the physics of hadron masses under strong magnetic fields .",
    "we also apply the model to predict other hadron masses including baryons and hadrons with strangeness .",
    "before presenting the model , let us first clarify what are the essential properties for describing hadron masses under strong magnetic fields .",
    "\\(a ) _ quark degrees of freedom _ :",
    "since the typical energy scale of the system is now characterized by magnetic fields stronger than the qcd energy scale @xmath3 , the internal structure of hadrons , i.e. , the quark degrees of freedom should be explicitly treated to describe hadron masses .",
    "\\(b ) _ explicit breaking of @xmath1 symmetry of hadrons _ :",
    "@xmath1 symmetry of hadrons is the key concept in describing hadron masses with zero magnetic field @xcite .",
    "however , this @xmath1 symmetry is completely broken under strong magnetic fields because quarks form the landau levels and their lowest energies depend on the spin and the electric charge . as a result ,",
    "the quark components of low - lying hadrons under strong magnetic fields differ from those with zero or weak magnetic fields @xmath2 .",
    "\\(c ) _ strong deformation of hadrons _ : without strong magnetic fields , the typical volume of a hadron is solely determined by the confinement of qcd and is roughly given by @xmath13 . under strong magnetic fields , however ,",
    "hadrons are strongly squeezed in the transverse direction @xmath14 not by qcd but by strong magnetic fields and therefore the typical volume would be given by @xmath15 . as a result ,",
    "the typical distance between quarks inside a hadron @xmath16 decreases as the magnetic field gets stronger . due to this reduction of @xmath16 , the mass contribution from the long - range interaction between quarks ,",
    "i.e. , the confinement potential of qcd @xmath17 decreases .",
    "when describing hadron masses under strong magnetic fields , one should take into account all of the essential properties ( a)-(c ) .",
    "we are going to develop a simple analytical model which incorporates all of the properties : a quark model under strong magnetic fields ( a ) whose quark components of hadrons are reorganized to respect the explicit breaking of the @xmath1 symmetry ( b ) and which includes the confinement potential of qcd ( c ) .",
    "let us consider a hamiltonian @xmath18 , for a single quark with an electric charge @xmath19 and a current quark mass @xmath20 , of the form @xmath21 here , we take cylindrical coordinates @xmath22 and denote the dirac matrices with @xmath23 and @xmath24 . the vector potential @xmath25 is chosen to realize a constant magnetic field along the @xmath26-axis @xmath27 .",
    "the potential @xmath28 contains not only the mass term @xmath29 but also the term @xmath30 , which phenomenologically represents the linear confinement of qcd .",
    "the parameters @xmath31 characterize the confinement force of qcd resemble to the phenomenological string tension of qcd @xmath32 , they are not the same in a strict sense : the phenomenological string tension @xmath32 represents the force acting between a pair of dynamical quarks . our parameters @xmath33 characterize the force acting on a single quark moving in an effective single - particle potential of the confinement . ] in the transverse and the longitudinal direction with respect to the magnetic field , respectively . notice that the chiral symmetry is explicitly broken by the potential @xmath28 .",
    "we also stress that the detailed choice of the confinement potential in @xmath28 does not affect our qualitative results . the advantage of this particular choice of @xmath28 ( eq .  ( [ eq3 ] ) )",
    "is that the dirac equation @xmath34 is analytically solvable .    by solving the dirac equation",
    ", one finds that the lowest energy level @xmath35 , which we shall call _ constituent quark mass _ , and the probability density @xmath36 of a single quark in the s - wave state are given by @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",

    "( [ eq4 ] ) behaves as @xmath43 the constituent quark mass @xmath35 increases as @xmath44 for @xmath45 while @xmath35 stays almost constant for @xmath46 .",
    "notice that eq .",
    "( [ eq51 ] ) is independent of the transverse confinement of qcd @xmath47 because hadrons are now strongly squeezed in the transverse direction @xmath48 by the strong magnetic field ( see the exponential factor in eq .",
    "( [ eq41 ] ) ) and the mass contribution from the transverse confinement of qcd @xmath49 becomes negligible .",
    "we also note that eq .",
    "( [ eq51 ] ) is a slight modification of the naive lowest landau energy for a charged point - like fermion , @xmath50 , due to the longitudinal confinement of qcd @xmath51 . on the other hand ,",
    "weak magnetic fields @xmath52 perturbatively deform hadrons to shift their masses as @xmath53 here , @xmath54 is the constituent quark mass at @xmath55 .",

    "( color online ) the constituent quark mass @xmath35 ( eq .  ( [ eq4 ] ) ) of @xmath58 as a function of the strength of the magnetic field @xmath4 .",

    "we have set @xmath61 and @xmath60 so as to reproduce the empirical value of the constituent quark masses at @xmath55 , i.e. , @xmath62 and @xmath63 . here",
    ", we have assumed that the parameters @xmath31 do not depend on magnetic fields and thus they are always spherically symmetric @xmath64 and constant .",
    "we remark that this simplification does not change our qualitative results , while some studies have suggested that the gluon dynamics could be modified , i.e. , the confinement force , which is represented by the parameters @xmath31 in our model , might vary under strong magnetic fields through quark loop corrections @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] clearly illustrates the explicit breaking of the @xmath1 symmetry of hadrons under strong magnetic fields .",
    "indeed , we have @xmath65 for strong magnetic fields",
    "the constituent quark mass of @xmath67 increases as @xmath44 because @xmath45 , while it stays almost constant for @xmath68 because @xmath46 , as is explained in eq .",
    "( [ eq51 ] ) .",
    "thus , the mass hierarchy @xmath69 appears . for the lighter @xmath46 quarks",
    "@xmath70 , the splitting @xmath71 arises from the current quark mass difference @xmath72 . for the heavier @xmath45 quarks @xmath73 , the splitting @xmath74 appears due to the electric charge difference @xmath75 . here",
    ", the current quark mass difference becomes unimportant because the constituent quark mass of @xmath45 quarks is largely determined by the electric charge only @xmath76 . on the other hand , for weak magnetic fields @xmath77 , the constituent quark mass of @xmath78 decreases as @xmath4 increases and its magnitude is slightly larger for @xmath79 than for @xmath80 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq52 ] ) ) .",
    "this is the consequence of the deformation of hadrons by magnetic fields : hadrons are squeezed by magnetic fields and therefore the mass contribution from the qcd confinement potential @xmath81 decreases . since @xmath16 becomes smaller for larger electric charge @xmath19 , we have a stronger reduction of @xmath82 than @xmath83 .",
    ".quark components of hadrons under strong magnetic fields .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     equation  ( [ eq5 ] ) is an essential relation to construct the proper quark components of hadrons under strong magnetic fields .",
    "this is summarized in table  [ table:1 ] .",
    "for example , the quark components of @xmath84 meson , which is a composite of @xmath85 quarks and has the total electric charge @xmath86 and the total angular momentum @xmath87 , is given by @xmath88 .",
    "indeed , the other @xmath89 states such as @xmath90 are heavier than @xmath88 because of the mass hierarchy eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) .",
    "simply speaking , the proper quark components of hadrons under strong magnetic fields are determined by maximizing the number of @xmath46 quarks , whose constituent quark mass stays almost constant , and by minimizing the sum of the electric charge @xmath91 of @xmath45 quarks , whose constituent quark mass increases as @xmath44 .",
    "we note that all the hadrons under strong magnetic fields are spin - aligned due to this reconstruction of quark components of hadrons .",
    "now , we are ready to compute hadron mass @xmath92 under strong magnetic fields . by using",
    "the constituent quark mass @xmath93 ( eq .  ( [ eq4 ] ) ) and the proper quark components of hadrons displayed in table  [ table:1 ] , we have @xmath94 here , we have neglected the quark interactions at short distances , one - gluon exchange potential for example , because its mass contribution is always suppressed by the strong coupling constant @xmath95 . the important point in eq .  ( [ eq6 ] ) is that the @xmath4-dependence of hadron mass @xmath92 is largely determined by the number of @xmath45 quarks and that @xmath92 increases as @xmath96 for strong magnetic fields @xmath66 .",
    "it should be stressed that the mass formula eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) is appropriate for _ strong _ magnetic fields @xmath66 because it incorporates all the essential properties ( a)-(c ) . for _ weak _ magnetic fields @xmath97 ,",
    "the mass formula eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) is not adequate to describe hadron masses precisely because the properties ( a)-(c ) are not the essence for weak magnetic fields .",
    "however , eq .  ( [ eq6 ] )",
    "does roughly reproduce the physical hadron masses even for weak magnetic fields because they are largely determined only by the constituent quark masses at @xmath55 , which is why we have set the value of the parameters @xmath98 so as to reproduce the empirical value of the constituent quark mass at @xmath55 . in order to obtain a better description for weak magnetic fields , one needs to take into account some other properties which eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) have neglected : the restoration of the @xmath1 symmetry of hadrons , the quark interactions at short distances and chiral corrections .",
    "the chiral corrections are especially important for describing @xmath99 meson masses under weak magnetic fields .",
    "we leave these improvements for a future work .",
    "we analytically calculate various hadrons masses by using eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) and the results are plotted in figs .  [",
    "fig : meson ]  and  [ fig : baryon ] .",
    "the masses of light mesons composed of @xmath100 quarks only are plotted in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : meson ] .",
    "the thick lines are our model calculation and the symbols are the existing lattice results @xcite",

    "@xcite shows there is no such increase in @xmath110 ( @xmath111 is not studied in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , i.e. , @xmath110 stays almost constant . ] . for weak magnetic fields @xmath77 , @xmath109 decrease as @xmath4 increases",
    "this is the consequence of the deformation of hadrons by magnetic fields . for comparison",
    ", we also plotted the naive lowest landau energies , @xmath112 and @xmath113 , respectively , for @xmath114 and @xmath115 as point - like particles in the thin black dashed lines .",
    "the deviation of our model from these lines at large @xmath4 , which is consistent with the lattice results , reflects the importance of the internal quark structure of hadrons .",

    "[ fig : meson ] .",
    "our model predicts @xmath117 for strong magnetic fields @xmath66 .",
    "for the major hierarchy @xmath118 , the interpretation is the same as that for the light meson masses .",
    "the former hadrons contain @xmath119 quark but the latter do not .",
    "the minor splittings @xmath120 and @xmath121 appear because of the current quark mass difference @xmath72 .",
    "we also show the naive lowest landau energies for @xmath122 as point - like particles in the thin black dashed lines .",
    "we again observe the deviation between our model and the naive lowest landau energies due to the internal quark structure of hadrons .",
    "the masses of light baryons ( left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : baryon ] ) and strange baryons ( right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : baryon ] ) are also investigated .",
    "the physics is the same as that for the meson masses : the number of @xmath45 quarks , the sum of the electric charge @xmath123 of @xmath124 quarks and the number of strange quarks determine the mass hierarchy for strong magnetic fields @xmath66 .",
    "our model predicts mass hierarchies @xmath125 for light baryons and @xmath126 for strange baryons .",
    "we have studied hadron masses under strong magnetic fields . we have developed a quark model which incorporates the explicit breaking of the @xmath1 symmetry and the strong deformation of hadrons , which are identified to be the essential properties to describe hadron masses under strong magnetic fields .",
    "various hadron masses , including baryons and hadrons with strangeness , are analytically calculated by the model .",
    "in particular , the @xmath4-dependence of @xmath127 are qualitatively consistent with the recent lattice results @xcite .",
    "the model also gives us a clear explanation why there is a non - trivial @xmath4-dependence in hadron masses under strong magnetic fields : under strong magnetic fields exceeding the qcd energy scale @xmath12 , only the quarks in the lowest landau level become important . in the lowest landau level ,",
    "the constituent quark mass increases as @xmath44 for @xmath45 quarks while it stays almost constant for @xmath46 quarks .",
    "thus , the @xmath4-dependence of hadron masses is largely determined by the sum of constituent quark mass of @xmath45 quarks inside a hadron .    since hadron masses are one of the most basic properties of hadrons , the results of this study have a wide range of applications when discussing hadron physics under strong magnetic fields .",
    "let us illustrate some examples .",
    "one example is decay modes of hadrons : some decay modes are kinematically suppressed or enhanced because of the mass hierarchy under strong magnetic fields ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : meson ]  and  [ fig : baryon ] ) .",
    "the modification to decay modes was suggested by ref .",
    "@xcite which discussed a suppression of @xmath128 meson decays .",
    "our study suggests that other decay modes are also modified , for example , @xmath129 is suppressed so that the lifetime of @xmath130 may become longer .",
    "another example is the equation of state ( eos ) of nuclear matter under strong magnetic fields .",
    "this is important for the physics of neutron stars .",
    "not only the hadron masses but also interactions between hadrons would affect the eos .",
    "this is because hadrons are spin - aligned under strong magnetic fields as displayed in table  [ table:1 ] and hence the spin - dependent part of the hadronic interactions would change .",
    "for the further improvement of our model , it may be important to consider the gluon dynamics : the gluon dynamics could be modified under strong magnetic fields through quark loop corrections . as a result ,",
    "the confinement force , which is represented by the parameters @xmath33 in our model , could depend on magnetic fields @xcite as already mentioned .",
    "also , it is discussed that the constituent quark mass @xmath35 could vary ( magnetic catalysis ; see chapter 2 of ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) . if this is the case , the constituent quark mass @xmath35 acquires additional mass contribution @xmath131 under strong magnetic fields @xmath12 .",
    "this results in the slow increase of @xmath132 and the small splitting @xmath133 observed in the lattice study @xcite .",
    "this splitting @xmath133 is explained by the constituent mass splitting @xmath134 due to the electric charge difference @xmath135 .",
    "in this situation , the ground state of @xmath136 would be given by @xmath137 , not by @xmath138 .",
    "thus , we have @xmath139 .",
