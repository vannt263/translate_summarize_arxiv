    "spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) plays an important role in modern particle physics theory .",
    "higgs mechanism in the standard model , for example , can be used to generate masses of elementary particles , leptons and quarks .",
    "the generation of quark masses by spontaneous symmetry breaking inevitably breaks the chiral symmetry of the qcd .",
    "chiral symmetry breaking  ( @xmath0sb ) could also be generated _ dynamically _ by the vacuum expectation value  ( vev ) of chiral condensate @xmath1 .",
    "dynamical @xmath0sb can explain masses of mesons and hadrons which are responsible for most of the visible mass in the universe .",
    "it can also explain hadronic particle generation in strong interaction at low energies .",
    "the key idea of ssb is the following . in a theory where the lagrangian is invariant under some symmetry",
    "while the vacuum state is not , the vacuum of the theory can generically carry non - trivial quantum number associated with the symmetry . the theory with such vacuum",
    "is said to be in a spontaneous broken phase .",
    "the theory could also be in a symmetric phase if its vacuum is invariant under the associated symmetry . in the spontaneous broken phase",
    ", there is an existence of nambu - goldstone ( ng)-boson @xcite .",
    "one can classify ng - boson into 2 cases i.e. on one hand , ng - boson is massless elementary particle and on the other hand , such boson could be a composite particle .",
    "dynamical symmetry breaking ( dsb ) usually occurs as a result of the interaction between constituent particles in the theory and yields a composite ng boson .    for chiral symmetry breaking of the qcd",
    ", the ng boson is usually identified with e.g. the three pions from the breaking of @xmath2 to @xmath3 or the eight light mesons from the breaking of @xmath4 to @xmath5 flavour diagonal .",
    "this symmetry breaking pattern @xcite was successfully used to explore properties of the light hadrons and gives precise predictions of light hadronic spectra @xcite .",
    "early stage of @xmath0sb in the strong interaction was demonstrated by the linear - sigma model @xcite and the current - algebra approach  @xcite . at the present",
    ", there is an incorporation between @xmath0sb and principle of effective field theory which gives a systematic framework to study qcd at low - energies , the so - called chiral perturbation theory  @xcite .",
    "the theory starts with an effective theory of hadrons with chiral symmetry in the action and use the ssb to generate a chiral symmetry breaking vacuum .",
    "the observed meson spectra shows good agreement with the prediction of the chiral perturbation theory  @xcite .    to address the chiral symmetry breaking / restoration phase transition",
    ", ones need to work with the action of quarks instead of hadrons .",
    "nambu - jona - lasinio  ( njl ) model @xcite is a model of quarks with four - fermion interaction employed to demonstrate the dynamical chiral symmetry breaking in the strong interaction independent of the confinement .",
    "originally , njl was formulated to explain mass of the nucleon as a consequence of the @xmath0sb .",
    "variations of the njl model have been widely used as effective description of low - energy models of hadrons in qcd at zero and finite - temperature @xcite .",
    "it is also applied to break electroweak symmetry via top - quark condensation or other fermions within and beyond the standard model @xcite .",
    "generically , the njl model is a very successful effective model to describe many hadronic properties in low - energy qcd , e.g. the mesons and baryons mass spectra , the pion decay constant , and the pion form factor  ( see @xcite for review ) .    despite the success of the njl as a low - energy phenomenological model approach to low - energy qcd ,",
    "the original njl model does not address confinement  ( e.g. the non - confining @xmath6 discontinuities in the 2-point green function have to be removed by introducing additional local operators  @xcite ) .",
    "there are extensions of the njl where inclusions of non - local interactions have been proposed in the literature ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "one can simply reproduce the non - local njl interaction from the qcd lagrangian by integrating out the gluon field from the one - gluon exchanging diagram @xcite .    in the non - local njl approach , interaction depends on the momenta carried by the quarks leading to a momentum - dependent quark mass , generated by the spontaneous @xmath0sb .",
    "it has been shown that a non - local njl model could lead to quark confinement with acceptable values of the parameters @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon originates from the fact the quark propagator has no real poles and consequently quarks have no asymptotic states .",
    "there are several other advantages of the non - local njl approach over the original ( local ) njl model i.e. the nonlocality regularizes the model in a manner that anomalies @xcite and gauge invariance @xcite are preserved and the momentum - dependent regulator makes the theory finite to all orders in the @xmath7 expansion . finally the dynamical quark mass is momentum dependent in contrast to the original njl model and consistent with lattice simulations of qcd @xcite .",
    "one can see that the non - local njl model may have more predictive power and be more realistic .",
    "there are two major applications of the non - local njl model in the strong interaction .",
    "firstly , it is incorporated in the quark model to give mass spectra of excited mesons in good agreement with the experimental data  @xcite .",
    "secondly , the thermodynamics of nuclear matter and qcd phase diagram could be explained quantitatively well by using non - local njl model  ( with polyakov - loop ) @xcite .",
    "a non - local njl model can also be constructed from certain intersecting - branes configurations in string theory .",
    "the sakai - sugimoto model  ( ss )  @xcite is a d8-@xmath8-d4 intersecting - branes model in type iia string theory .",
    "the background spacetime is generated from a stack of @xmath9 d4-branes .",
    "an @xmath10 coordinate is compactified into a circle with radius @xmath11 and the d4-branes wrap around the @xmath10 .",
    "on the boundary of the 10-dimensional space , a stack of @xmath12 d8 and @xmath8 are located at @xmath13 and @xmath14 respectively .",
    "the left  ( right)-handed quarks live on the d8  ( @xmath8)-d4 intersection in the form of open - string excitations .",
    "they are thus separated by distance @xmath15 on the boundary and there is a @xmath16 chiral symmetry .",
    "geometrically , when the d8 and @xmath8 merge at certain radial coordinate , the chiral symmetry breaking @xmath17 occurs .",
    "we will not be considering the ss model in the full details here but would rather focus on the low - energy effective 5-dimensional field theory limit of the model  ( following the work by antonyan et .",
    "al . in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , which we call the ahjk model .",
    "in contrast to the strong coupling regime where the supergravity picture of intersecting branes provide simple geometrical interpretation of the theory , the weak coupling limit has its own unique picture of chiral symmetry breaking in terms of non - local njl model in 5 dimensions .    in such intersecting branes setting",
    "there are two crucial parameters i.e. the 5-dimensional t hooft coupling , @xmath18 and the length scale of separation between d8-@xmath8 flavor branes , @xmath15 .",
    "one can consider the hierarchy of those parameter as @xmath19 which is the weak coupling regime .",
    "in such limit , we can treat left- and right - handed quarks as weakly interacting by single ( five dimensional ) gluon exchange process .",
    "the non - local njl interaction is reproduced by integrating out gluon fields in the bulk spacetime from such d - branes configuration . in terms of",
    "effective potential in holographic non - local njl , the nonzero solution of chiral quark condensate exists at arbitrary weak coupling @xcite .",
    "in contrast , if one considers the ss model in the compactified case i.e. @xmath11 is finite , and includes the kk tower of states .",
    "the @xmath0sb will happen only above a certain value of t hooft coupling @xcite . in any cases",
    ", the analysis has been done on the effective potential of the non - local njl at the one - loop level .",
    "it is interesting to investigate whether the two - loop contribution would change the profile of the effective potential in any significant way .",
    "we will start by reviewing the method of effective action in 5 dimensions when gauge fields propagate in 5 dimensions and fermions are localized in 4 dimensional subspace . by integrating out gauge fields ,",
    "we will obtain the effective fermionic action of the ss njl model .",
    "subsequently , by using auxiliary field approach , we integrate out the residual fermionic fields to obtain the effective scalar action of the ss njl model . the gap equation is derived at one and two loop level . at one loop",
    ", we numerically solve the gap equation for weak couplings and demonstrate the existence of the chiral broken solutions .",
    "one - loop and two - loop contributions of the action are then calculated and discussed .",
    "chiral symmetry breaking is demonstrated at both one and two - loop levels .",
    "we start with the effective action of the single - intersection model where left - handed quarks are located at a single intersection of @xmath9 d4 and @xmath12 d8 branes  @xcite , @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "integrating by part and fix the gauge , the action can be rewritten in the following form , @xmath23 where we have defined @xmath24  and set @xmath25 .",

    "( [ action ] ) since we take the field theory limit of the model in the weak coupling regime . moreover , in going from eqn .",

    "the t hooft coupling @xmath28 is smaller than @xmath26 and thus @xmath29 . at the distances",
    "much larger than @xmath26 , we can therefore ignore the nonlinear interactions of the gauge fields which only become significant around the distance scale @xmath18 .",

    "<S> are explicitly demonstrated for weak couplings . </S>",
    "<S> we then calculate the one and two - loop contribution to the effective potential of the non - local njl model and found that the two - loop contribution is negative . </S>",
    "<S> the two - loop potential for the chiral symmetric vacuum is also negative but larger than the combined effective potential of the chiral broken vacuum at the two - loop level . the chiral symmetry breaking thus persists for arbitrary weak coupling at the two - loop level . </S>"
