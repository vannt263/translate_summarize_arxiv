    "at energies below the pion - production threshold , the amplitude for compton scattering off the nucleon may be expanded in a taylor series in the momentum of the photon . the famous low - energy theorem ( let ) of low @xcite and gell - mann and",
    "goldberger @xcite makes a model - independent prediction for the expansion up to and including linear terms .",
    "the taylor series coefficients are given in terms of the charge , mass , and magnetic moment of the target , i.e.  properties of the nucleon which can entirely be determined from different experiments .",
    "the derivation of this theorem is based on gauge invariance , lorentz covariance , crossing symmetry , and the discrete symmetries .",
    "the description of second - order terms requires two new structure constants specific to the real compton scattering amplitude , the electric and magnetic polarizabilities @xmath2 and @xmath3 ( for an overview see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    the investigation of virtual compton scattering ( vcs ) as tested in , e.g. , the reaction @xmath4 , has recently attracted a lot of interest .",
    "even though the experiments @xcite will be considerably more complicated than for real compton scattering , there is the prospect of obtaining completely new information about the structure of the nucleon which can not be obtained from any other experiment . like in real compton scattering ,",
    "the model - independent properties of the low - energy vcs amplitude have been identified in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the model - dependent part beyond the let was analyzed in terms of a multipole expansion . keeping only terms linear in the energy of the final photon ,",
    "the corresponding amplitude was parametrized in terms of ten so - called generalized polarizabilities ( gps ) which are functions of the three - momentum transfer of the initial virtual photon .",
    "the number of independent gps reduces to six , if charge - conjugation invariance is imposed @xcite .",
    "omitting the bethe - heitler contribution , the invariant amplitude for vcs reads @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the polarization vector of the virtual photon ( @xmath7 ) , and where use of current conservation has been made . in the center - of - mass system , using the coulomb gauge for the final real photon , the transverse ( longitudinal ) part of @xmath8 can be expressed in terms of eight ( four ) independent structures @xcite , @xmath9 where the functions @xmath10 depend on three kinematical variables , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 .    extending the method of gell - mann and goldberger @xcite to vcs , model - independent predictions for the functions @xmath10 were obtained in @xcite .",
    "for example , the result for @xmath14 up to second order in @xmath15 and @xmath16 is @xmath17 to this order , all @xmath10 can be expressed in terms of @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 .",
    "for the purpose of analyzing the model - dependent terms specific to vcs , the invariant amplitude is split into a pole piece @xmath23 and a residual part @xmath24 .",
    "the s- and u - channel pole diagrams are calculated using electromagnetic vertices of the form @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the dirac and pauli form factors , respectively . the corresponding amplitude @xmath28 contains all irregular terms as @xmath29 or @xmath30 and is separately gauge invariant .",
    "the generalized polarizabilities in vcs @xcite result from an analysis of @xmath31 in terms of electromagnetic multipoles @xmath32 , where @xmath33 denotes the type of the initial ( final ) photon ( @xmath34 : charge , c ; @xmath35 : magnetic , m ; @xmath36 : electric , e ) . the initial ( final ) orbital angular momentum is denoted by @xmath37 , and @xmath38 distinguishes between non - spin - flip @xmath39 and spin - flip @xmath40 transitions . according to the let for vcs",
    ", @xmath41 is at least linear in the energy of the real photon .",
    "a restriction to the lowest - order , i.e.  linear terms in @xmath16 leads to only electric and magnetic dipole radiation in the final state .",
