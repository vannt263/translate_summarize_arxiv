    "understanding the electronic nature of chemical bonds of @xmath7-elements is an issue which has been attracting wide attention of investigators working in diverse areas of research .",
    "the main question is the involvement of 4@xmath7 states in the formation of chemical bonds in molecules and in solids . in general",
    ", one can speak of two extreme scenarios .",
    "that is , either @xmath8electrons participate in chemical bonding which is the case for 5@xmath7-states in the u@xmath0 molecule @xcite , or they stay essentially localized at each site forming core - like states like in lanthanides .",
    "this phenomenon known as the localization - delocalization paradigm in solid - state physics @xcite is the subject of intense theoretical considerations and discussion .    in various compounds cerium",
    "is believed to display both types of 4@xmath7 behavior which makes it the key element in these studies . indeed , in solids ce and its compounds exhibit a broad range of unusual electronic , magnetic and structural properties called correlation effects @xcite . while much effort has been invested in understanding of the complex electronic behavior in sophisticated cerium compounds ,",
    "very little attention has been given to the simplest cerium chemical bond @xcite , which is realized in ce@xmath0 .",
    "meanwhile , owing to the progress of the spectroscopy of small metal clusters @xcite precise experimental data on the cerium dimer @xcite have been reported recently , followed by first reliable many - electron calculations @xcite .",
    "cao and dolg @xcite have performed a series of calculations of ce@xmath0 using the complete active space self - consistent field ( casscf ) method , multireference configuration interaction ( mrci ) method and coupled cluster approach [ ccsd(t ) ] and concluded that its ground state  superconfiguration \" is @xmath9@xmath10 .",
    "six low - lying molecular terms ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) are  virtually degenerate \" so that the exact refinement of the ground state is very difficult .",
    "the authors then restricted themselves to the @xmath11 and @xmath17 ground states for which in the scalar relativistic approximation they obtained the following spectroscopic constants : @xmath18  , @xmath19 ev and @xmath20 @xmath21 .",
    "the low - lying excitations were attributed to the core - like properties of @xmath1 states . in the spin - orbit calculation",
    "the authors obtained the @xmath22_g^+$ ] ground state followed by two low - lying levels @xmath23",
    "( @xmath24 1 @xmath21 ) and @xmath25 ( @xmath24 2 @xmath21 ) .",
    "the nature of the ce@xmath0 bonding and the role of the 4@xmath7-states were also considered in casscf studies by roos _",
    "et al . _ in @xcite . as in @xcite",
    "it was found that the triple bond molecular configuration @xmath26 couples in the @xmath11 molecular term .",
    "two remaining nonbonding and localized 4@xmath7 electrons are in @xmath27-state ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "these two 4@xmath7 electrons then can form the configurations @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 , which result in molecular terms with angular momenta @xmath32 and 6 .",
    "the six calculated low - lying levels again are almost degenerate having approximately the same spectroscopic parameters ( without the spin - orbit interaction ) : @xmath33  , @xmath34 @xmath21 , @xmath35 ev ( the caspt2 level of theory and a basis set of vqzp quality ) .",
    "the spin - orbit coupling has only small effect on the computed properties , in particular it reduces @xmath36 to 2.51 ev in good agreement with the experimental estimate @xmath37 ev [ from the third law ] .",
    "calculations of roos _ et al . _",
    "give a longer @xmath38 and a softer @xmath39 in comparison with the values of cao and dolg @xcite .",
    "both theoretical estimates of @xmath39 @xcite are smaller than the experimental result @xcite : @xmath40 @xmath21 [ the force constant @xmath41 mdyne /  ] .",
    "thus , the standard well - known many - electron procedures @xcite correctly describe the ce@xmath0 chemical bonding but find six nearly degenerate low - lying molecular terms ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) instead of a well defined ground state .",
    "the difficulty lies in the smallness of the splitting energies of these excitations requiring a special treatment . in the following",
    "we formulate a simplified valence bond ( vb ) model accounting for the 4@xmath7 electrons in the cerium dimer , find the important interactions and obtain the  fine \" energy spectrum of the electron excitations .",
    "our approach is based on the picture of 4@xmath7 - 4@xmath7 interactions as rightly found in @xcite , but requires a more deep insight in the couplings which experience the 4@xmath7 electrons in the molecule .",
    "we start with the description of the triple bond of ce@xmath0 .",
    "the ground state electronic configuration of the cerium atom is @xmath42 with the @xmath43 ground term .",
    "this implies that the ce atom is a rare case of the first hund rule violation @xcite .",
    "the nature of such behavior lies in  quartic fermi hole \" which effectively separates the valence electrons and decreases their coulomb repulsion @xcite . already at this stage of the investigation",
    "it is clear that the 4@xmath7 electron is not independent , through the coulomb repulsion it is strongly coupled with the valence 5@xmath44 and 6@xmath45 electrons on the same cerium site .",
    "however , the @xmath42 configuration with the closed @xmath46shell is not favorable for chemical bonding .",
    "therefore the electronic atomic state of ce is first transformed to the @xmath47 configuration with the @xmath48 term situated at 0.299 ev above the @xmath43 ground term @xcite . in the @xmath47 configuration",
    "both 5@xmath44 and 6@xmath45 shells become open and form the triple bond with six valence electrons : @xmath10 .",
    "the @xmath11 bonding state of 5@xmath44 and 6@xmath45 electrons ( without the 4@xmath7 states ) is well understood @xcite , in particular it occurs in la@xmath0 where the molecular characteristics ( @xmath49 ev , @xmath41 mdyne /  @xcite , the @xmath50 initial and @xmath51 final [ at 0.33 ev ] configuration ) are very close to those in ce@xmath0 .",
    "although the triple bond is strong , the total energy gain is weakened by 0.6 ev because of the necessity to promote one 6@xmath45-electron to the 5@xmath44-shell for both cerium atoms .",
    "we consider the first cerium atom at ( 0,0,0 ) and the second at ( 0,0,@xmath38 ) ( so that the @xmath52-axis is the molecular axis ) and find the valence density distribution of the four 5@xmath44 and two 6@xmath45 valence electrons .",
    "the @xmath11 @xmath53 ground state implies an axially symmetric electron density .",
    "the conclusion can also be proved by considering the density distributions of two @xmath45 and four @xmath44-electrons in the @xmath10 configuration .",
    "now to the @xmath54 and @xmath55 valence states we add two @xmath1-electrons .",
    "the main assumption supported by @xcite is that to a first approximation the 4@xmath7 electrons do not contribute to the chemical bonding and remain localized .",
    "then it follows that each 4@xmath7 electron should be either in the @xmath56 or in the @xmath57 angular orbital state where @xmath58 .",
    "( here we deal with the real spherical harmonics @xmath59 ( @xmath60 for cosine- and @xmath61 for sine - like azimuthal ( @xmath62- ) dependence ) defined in ref .",
    "@xcite . ) that is because in both these states the coulomb intrasite repulsion between the @xmath1 electron and the bonding @xmath54 and @xmath55 states at the cerium site is minimal ( see appendix a ) . indeed , in these @xmath28 @xmath8states the angular density dependence is @xmath63 with the maximum at @xmath64 , while in the binding @xmath54 states maximum lies at @xmath65 and in @xmath55 states at @xmath66 ( considering their overlap ) .",
    "thus , the occupation of the @xmath28 @xmath8states ensures a certain space separation of the populated @xmath1 states from the binding @xmath54 and @xmath55 electrons , which effectively minimizes the intrasite @xmath67 and @xmath67 coulomb repulsions .",
    "the situation is discussed in detail in appendix a , notice that the conclusion about the occupancy of the @xmath68 states is also explicitly supported by the calculations of roos et al .",
    "@xcite and implicitly by cao and dolg @xcite .",
    "thus , at each cerium site the @xmath1 electron space is limited to two @xmath28 orbitals , see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] :    @xmath69    here @xmath70 is the radial part of the @xmath1 states",
    ".    since there is very little overlap between @xmath1 functions belonging to different sites , the valence bond ( vb or heitler - london ) @xcite approach should give the best description to the @xmath1 electronic problem . its basis set consists of the two electron @xmath1 states : @xmath71 where the indices @xmath72 and @xmath73 refer to two orbital sites at sites @xmath74 and @xmath75 , i.e. @xmath76 or @xmath45 ( orbital functions defined in eq .",

    "<S> the electronic structure of ce@xmath0 is studied in a valence bond model with two @xmath1 electrons localized at two cerium sites . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the low - lying energy spectrum of the simplest cerium chemical bond is determined by peculiarities of the occupied @xmath1 states . </S>",
    "<S> the model allows for an analytical solution which is discussed along with the numerical analysis . </S>",
    "<S> the energy spectrum is a result of the interplay between the @xmath1 valence bond exchange , the @xmath1 coulomb repulsion and the spin - orbit coupling . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated ground state is the even @xmath2 level , the lowest excitations situated at @xmath3 k are the odd @xmath2 state and the @xmath4 doublet @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated magnetic susceptibility displays different behavior at high and low temperatures . in the absence of the spin - orbit coupling the ground state </S>",
