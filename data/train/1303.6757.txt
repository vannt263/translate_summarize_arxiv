    "since various systems may be governed by the same fundamental law , universality exists in nature .",
    "the early indications of universality in quantum mechanic three - body systems was discovered before 1970.@xcite the first strong evidence was given by efimov in 1970 on three weakly bound identical bosons.@xcite  he found that , when the scattering length is sufficiently long , a sequence of loosely bound states , the `` efimov states '' , will appear .",
    "the properties of these states are governed by a universal law , not depend on the dynamic details of the 3-boson systems . in this paper ,",
    "another kind of universality that exists in tightly bound quantum mechanic few - body systems is revealed and confirmed numerically .",
    "the hamiltonian of identical particles is invariant under the operations of a set of symmetry groups @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 ( including the permutation group).@xcite consequently , the eigenstates @xmath3 are classified according to the representations of these groups , where @xmath4 denotes a set of coordinates and @xmath5 is a serial number .",
    "let @xmath6 be an element of @xmath0 , @xmath7 be that of @xmath8 , and @xmath9 denotes a special zone in the high - dimensional coordinate space .",
    "when @xmath10 , the effects of @xmath11 and @xmath7 might be equivalent so that @xmath12 . for an example , when @xmath9 is the zone of the squares ( sq ) , @xmath6 is a rotation about the normal of the sq by @xmath13 , and @xmath7 is a cyclic permutation of particles , then @xmath6 and @xmath7 are equivalent in @xmath9 . making use of the representations of groups",
    ", the equivalence leads to a set of homogeneous linear equations @xmath14   \\psi _ { i'}(x )    =   0 , \\ \\ \\ ( x\\in \\xi ) ,   \\label{e01_sum}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 are the matrix elements of the representation .",
    "when the matrix of this set of equations is non - degenerate , the set @xmath16 must be zero in @xmath9 . in this case , @xmath9 becomes a prohibited zone ( pz ) and the wave function appears as an inherent nodal surface ( ins).@xcite eq .",
    "( [ e01_sum ] ) demonstrates that , for each pair of equivalent operations , a constraint will be imposed on the eigenstates . since the matrixes of representations are absolutely irrelevant to dynamics , the constraint is universal  disregarding the kind of systems ( nuclear , atomic , or molecular ) and the details of dynamic parameters .",
    "it implies that the states of different systems but belonging to the same set of representations will have exactly the same pz , and their wave functions will have exactly the same ins . on the other hand",
    ", some zones are important to binding ( say , for 4-body systems , the zones of equilateral tetrahedron ( et ) and sq ) .",
    "whether these zones are prohibited is crucial to the binding energy and the geometric character of a state .",
    "furthermore , the number and the locations of the nodal surfaces in a wave function in general determine the strength and mode of oscillation .",
    "in particular , the existence of the ins implies an inherent mode .",
    "thus , the eigenstates would be seriously affected by the universal symmetry constraint .",
    "the decisive effect of the symmetry constraint on the triply and quadruple excited intrashell states of atoms has been revealed previously.@xcite accordingly , these states can be naturally classified according to their inherent nodal structures.@xcite for 4-boson systems , a number of predictions on the structures and internal modes of oscillation have been made previously.@xcite however , these predictions have not yet been confirmed numerically . the present paper generalizes the work of [ 18,19 ] in the following aspects : ( i ) instead of free 4-boson systems , trapped 4-boson systems are considered . thereby a number of tightly bound states can be obtained which are necessary for a systematic analysis .",
    "( ii ) in addition to theoretical analysis , numerical calculations have been performed so that the effect of symmetry constraint can be appraised quantitatively .",
    "( iii ) three types of interactions have been adopted .",
    "the aim is to demonstrate the similarity among different kinds of systems .    in the next section ,",
    "the symmetry constraints imposing on 4-boson systems are studied theoretically .",
    "we have chosen appropriate sets of coordinates so that eq .",
    "( [ e01_sum ] ) appears in very simple forms and the analysis becomes transparent .",
    "then , an isotropic trap together with three types of interaction are introduced , and numerical calculations are performed to diagonalize the hamiltonian . under the trap the total orbital angular momentum @xmath17 , its @xmath18-component @xmath19 , and the parity @xmath20 are good quantum numbers .",
    "accordingly , an eigenstate with the c.m .",
    "motion removed can be denoted as @xmath21 , where @xmath5  denotes the @xmath5-th state of a @xmath22-series .",
    "mostly the @xmath23 states ( the lowest one ) are concerned . therefore , the label @xmath5  is dropped hereafter ( except specified ) . after obtaining the eigenenergies and the eigenstates ,",
    "a number of quantities ( the root - mean - square radius , the one - body densities for the particle distribution , and the shape - densities ) are further calculated .",
    "thereby , inherent physics can be extracted , and a clear comparison among different kinds of system can be made .",
    "the emphasis is placed to demonstrate the universality of the pz and the similarity among different systems . a short discussion on 4-fermion systems is also given at the end .",
    "the equilateral tetrahedron ( et ) and the square ( sq ) are the two most important geometries",

    "thus , the angular distribution of particle is not seriously affected by the details of interaction . in the following",

    "thus the normality can be rewritten as @xmath145 , where @xmath146 is the probability density that the system has a given size and a given shape ( while the orientation of the shape has already been integrated ) .",

    "when a wave function is remarkably distributed along the curve then the specific mode is involved .",

    "accordingly , @xmath33 decreases along @xmath153 ( refer to fig .",
    "[ fig1]a ) and the prolonged et suffers a compression and is transformed to a sq .",
    "once @xmath33 becomes zero , this process will continue but in reverse direction ( namely , @xmath33 increases further along @xmath154 .",

    "thus an excited oscillation of a diamond around a sq is contained .    for the @xmath64 state of the third group",
    "any coplanar structures are prohibited .",
    "this is due to the equivalence @xmath157 , where @xmath35  is chosen to be vertical to the plane ( @xmath158 causes no effect on @xmath159  states , while @xmath47  causes a change of sign on odd parity states , this leads to a contradiction ) thus , from table  [ tab1 ] , the wave function of @xmath64 would be essentially distributed in @xmath26 .",
    "however , many subspaces in @xmath26 are pz of @xmath64 .",
    "this is shown in figs .",
    "[ fig9]a-[fig9]c . where @xmath160 and @xmath161 , and @xmath151 are  three nodal lines because they are associated with coplanar shapes ( refer to fig .",
    "[ fig1]b ) .",
    "@xmath162 is also a nodal line because the associated shape belongs also to @xmath24  which is prohibited .",
    "furthermore , let the coordinates of the particle 2 relative to @xmath34  be denoted as @xmath163 . accordingly , those of the particles 1 , 3 , and 4 are @xmath164 , @xmath165 , and @xmath166 , respectively .",
    "one can see that , if @xmath167 the equivalence @xmath168 holds ( where @xmath46 is an interchange of a pair of particles ) , if @xmath169 the equivalence @xmath170 holds , and if x = y the equivalence @xmath171 holds . for @xmath64 , the left side of each of the equivalence will cause a change of sign while the right side does not",
    ". therefore @xmath64 must be zero in each of the subspace with @xmath167 , @xmath169 , or @xmath172 .",
    "the equality @xmath167 can be rewritten as @xmath173 .",
    "note that @xmath33 and @xmath32 are constrained as @xmath174  in figs .",
    "[ fig9]a-[fig9]c .",
    "thus @xmath175 is a nodal line .",
    "similarly , the case z = x leads to the nodal line @xmath176 , while the case x = y leads to the nodal line @xmath162 mentioned above .",
    "totally , six nodal lines are contained in figs .",
    "[ fig9]a-[fig9]c .",
    "these lines expel the wave function from favorable zones and cause strong inherent oscillation .",
    "this explains why the energy of @xmath64 is so high .",
    "for @xmath67 , due to the prohibition of @xmath26 and @xmath25 , the structure of tetrahedron is unfavorable .",
    "furthermore , due to the prohibition of @xmath98 , the coplanar structures are also unfavorable .",
    "it was found that this state is a mixture of a parallelogram and a deformed tetrahedron . the shape - density surrounding the parallelogram",
    "is shown in fig.s  [ fig9]d-[fig9]f , where the vertical line is associated with the diamonds and is a nodal line for @xmath67 . the two peaks ( each peaked at a parallelogram ) separated by the nodal line implies an excited oscillation of the parallelogram .    from the shape - densities plotted in figs .",
    "[ fig6 ] to [ fig9 ] , the decisive effect of the pz is clearly shown .",
    "since the pz is universal , the wave functions are expelled in a universal way , and the room left for dynamic adjustment is limited .",
    "this leads to similarity which is clearly shown by comparing the three patterns of any row in the figures for @xmath136 , @xmath137 , and @xmath124 , respectively .",
    "the existence of pz is not only for 4-boson systems but for all kinds of few - body systems containing identical particles . for an example of a 4-fermion system",
    ", it is assumed that the spin - dependent interaction tends to align the spins ( alternatively , a magnetic field is applied so that the spins are aligned ) . for this case ,",
    "the spatial wave functions will be fully anti - symmetric .",
    "accordingly , the equivalent operation eq .",
    "( [ e03_psi ] ) that hold in @xmath24 leads to the fact that @xmath177 is nonzero only if @xmath56 ( when @xmath178 ) , or @xmath58 ( when @xmath179 ) .",
    "in particular , the @xmath62 component exists only if  @xmath178 and @xmath17 being even .",
    "accordingly , the et-*ac * states are now @xmath64 , @xmath68 , and @xmath102 . the sq-*ac * states are now @xmath85 , @xmath68 , and @xmath78 , while the states rejected from @xmath24 are now @xmath84 , @xmath67 , @xmath65 , and @xmath77 . among them @xmath67 and @xmath77 can both access @xmath25 , while @xmath67 can access also coplanar structures",
    ". therefore , for the ten states under consideration , we can predict that @xmath64 , @xmath85 , @xmath68 , and @xmath102 would be the lowest , while @xmath65 and @xmath84 would be the highest .",
    "we repeat our previous calculation for the case @xmath136but using fully anti - symmetric basis functions .",
    "the resultant spectra is shown in table  [ tab2 ] .",
    ".the energies of the ten states ( in ascending order ) of the fermion system calculated with @xmath116 ( the unit is @xmath104 ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the result in table  [ tab2 ] confirms the prediction .",
    "from the point of classical dynamics , it is incredible that there are zones in the coordinate space favorable in energy but absolutely prohibited .",
    "however , this paper demonstrates analytically and numerically that this is a fact in microscopic few - body systems .",
    "since the prohibition arises from the symmetry constraint which depends only on the inherent symmetry but is irrelevant to dynamics , the existence of the pz is universal disregarding the kinds of systems and the details of interaction .",
    "the quantum states of different systems will have exactly the same pz located at the same subspace when these states are governed by the same inherent symmetry ( namely , they belong to the same set of representations of the symmetry groups ) .",
    "since some of the pz have a higher geometric symmetry , they are the zones more favorable in energy .",
    "therefore , the prohibition causes serious effect and destroys thoroughly the picture painted simply by dynamics .",
    "consequently , the structures of the low - lying states are decisively determined by their inherent symmetry , and the room left for the adjustment from dynamics is narrow , in particular for the @xmath23 states    although only 4-body systems with [ 1,1,1,1 ] and [ @xmath180 symmetries are concerned in this paper , obviously the existence of the pz is a universal phenomenon for all kinds of few - body systems with identical particles .",

    "finally , the set @xmath205 is used to diagonalize @xmath181 . due to the talmi - moshinsky coefficients , only the set of coordinates @xmath208 , @xmath209 , and @xmath210 is involved .",
    "thus the calculation of the matrix elements is straight forward .",
    "when @xmath197 and @xmath17 are given , a series of states will be obtained after the diagonalization .",
    "the lowest one of the series is called the first state .",
    "@xmath187 has to be adjusted so that the energy of the first state is as low as possible .    due to having a trap",
    ", the bound states will tend to zero quite fast when @xmath130 tends to infinity .",
    "for this case , the above basis functions are suitable and will lead to a better convergency .",
    "let @xmath211 , and let the number of basis functions be constrained by @xmath212 .",
    "then , as an example of the bosonic case , the resultant energy of the lowest @xmath84 state with the interaction @xmath136 is 2.2965 , 2.2961 , and 2.2960 @xmath213 , respectively , when @xmath214 , 18 , and 20 .",
