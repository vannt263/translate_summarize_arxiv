    "the experimental study of the electroweak symmetry breaking sector ( or higgs sector ) is one of the main goals of the experimental high energy physics program .",
    "the minimal standard model with a single scalar higgs boson is compatible with all existing data if the higgs boson mass is in the range 115140  gev , and in fact intriguing hints of a higgs boson with mass near 125  gev have recently been found at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) @xcite .",
    "if a light higgs - like state is definitively discovered , the next step in the experimental program will be to determine whether this state is in fact the higgs boson of the minimal standard model , part of an extended higgs sector ( such as that of the minimal supersymmetric standard model , or mssm @xcite ) , a composite higgs @xcite , or a completely different particle with higgs - like couplings ( such as a radion in warped extra dimensions @xcite or dilaton @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    ", we consider models with a light neutral higgs boson that is part of an extended higgs sector . rather than assume a particular theoretical framework ( such as the mssm ) , we take a phenomenological approach , using a general 2-higgs doublet model as a convenient simplified model @xcite to parameterize the signals .",
    "this approach motivates a variety of signals with final states involving the heaviest standard model particles ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 ) , which have the strongest couplings to the higgs sector @xcite .",
    "the @xmath9 final state is enhanced by @xmath9 scattering in models where the higgs sector is strongly coupled @xcite , and this signal has been the subject of much detailed investigation @xcite .",
    "the phenomenology of resonant production of the final states @xmath10 @xcite and @xmath11 @xcite have also been investigated .    in this paper , we focus on the final state @xmath12 , which can have a large production rate from the process @xmath13 followed by @xmath3 with @xmath4 or @xmath5 . the main challenge with these signals",
    "is the large @xmath6 background , which shares the same final state .",
    "the tevatron has performed in - depth studies of the properties of the top quark in the @xmath6 mode , including searches for charged higgs bosons in top - quark decay @xcite , a measurement of the polarization of the top - quark decay products @xcite , and independent measurements of the top - quark mass in different top - quark decay modes  @xcite . the model considered in this paper",
    "can be viewed as a continuation of these investigations , understanding to what degree the @xmath6 sample at the tevatron and the lhc can contain final states with a @xmath14 resonance .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii of the paper , we discuss a simplified model and monte carlo generation of the signal . in section iii , we address selection criteria and the dominant backgrounds .",
    "section iv and v discuss search strategies and expected sensitivity in @xmath14 and @xmath15 resonances respectively .",
    "to carry out this study , we use a simplified model that contains only the minimal particle content necessary to describe the signal of interest .",
    "it contains two neutral higgs bosons , heavy ( @xmath2 ) and light ( @xmath16 ) , and two charged higgs particles ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "the parameters of the model are simply the masses of the higgses and the production cross section times branching ratios for the assumed decays .",
    "this allows for the simple interpretation of the parameters and the later mapping to the specific parameters of more complete theories .",
    "the production mode studied here is gluon - gluon fusion @xmath13 .",
    "we consider only the decay @xmath3 and @xmath18 .",
    "we consider two possible decays of the charge higgs state , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , performing two separate analyses for the limiting cases where one of these dominates .",
    "although we are not committing to a specific model , it is worth noting that in 2-higgs doublet models , these decays are controlled by the couplings @xmath21 which depend on different combinations of the angles @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( defined for example in ref .",
    "these searches therefore probe different regions of parameter space of this model . on the other hand ,",
    "the production cross section depends on the coupling @xmath24 for parameters where this is unsuppressed , the @xmath20 decay is also unsuppressed , so in a 2-higgs doublet model the modes @xmath19 and @xmath20 are always both allowed .",
    "nevertheless , we will study these modes independently in this preliminary study .    to avoid unnecessary model - dependent assumptions in our results ,",
    "we give expected limits on the @xmath2 production cross section times the product of the appropriate branching ratios . to interpret the results , we need to know the expected rates in some reasonable models , so we give the cross section for @xmath2 production in fig .",
    "[ fig : xsec ] , which is equivalent to the sm higgs production cross section if @xmath25 .",
    "both signal and background events are generated with madgraph  @xcite , while top - quark and @xmath0 boson decay , showering and hadronization is performed by pythia  @xcite .",
    "we use pgs  @xcite tuned for tevatron or atlas to provide detector simulation .     as a function of mass in a 2-higgs doublet model with @xmath25 , equivalent to the sm higgs production cross section , for tevatron @xmath26 collisions at @xmath27  tev  @xcite , and for lhc @xmath28 collisions at @xmath29  tev  @xcite . ]",
    "the event selection is similar to the standard single lepton selection used for tevatron and lhc measurements @xcite of the @xmath30 final states , with one @xmath0 boson decaying leptonically .",
    "we require :    * exactly one electron or muon , with @xmath31 gev and @xmath32 * at least four jets , each with @xmath31 gev and @xmath32 * at least 20  gev of missing transverse momentum * at least one @xmath8-tagged jet    the @xmath8-tagging algorithm parametrized in pgs is 36% ( 44% ) efficient per @xmath8-quark jet for the tevatron ( lhc ) .",

    "<S> in extended higgs sectors , heavy higgs bosons can decay via cascades to a light higgs boson plus @xmath0 and @xmath1 bosons . </S>",
    "<S> we study signals of such sectors at the tevatron and lhc that result from resonant production of a heavy @xmath2 followed by the decay @xmath3 with @xmath4 or @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the final states have the same particle content as that of @xmath6 production , but with a resonant structure that can be used to distinguish signal events from background events . </S>",
    "<S> we propose analysis techniques and estimate the experimental sensitivity of the tevatron and lhc experiments to these signals . </S>"
