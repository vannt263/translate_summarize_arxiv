    "the realization of excitonic insulators ( ei ) on the proximity of the semimetal - semiconductor transition was suggested about half a century ago .",

    "quasi - one - dimensional 1@xmath1-tise@xmath2 has been studied both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "@xcite tani@xmath2se@xmath3 has also been studied by angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) measurements .",
    "it was reported that the valence - band top is extremely flat , and the material can be a new candidate for an ei of bound pairs between ni 3@xmath4-se 4@xmath5 holes and ta @xmath6 electrons .",
    "@xcite    from the theoretical point of view , the falicov - kimball model  @xcite extended by including a finite valence bandwidth , i.e. , extended falicov - kimball model ( efkm ) , has been extensively studied in context of the ei or electric ferroelectricity .",
    "@xcite the efkm contains the large bandwidth @xmath7-electrons ( with a hopping integral @xmath8 and on - site energy @xmath9 ) , small bandwidth @xmath10-electrons ( with a hopping integral @xmath11 and on - site energy @xmath12 ) , and a coulomb interaction ( @xmath0 ) between @xmath7- and @xmath10-electrons .",
    "the ground state phase diagram of the efkm in the weak - to - intermediate - coupling regime was obtained by the constrained path monte carlo ( cpmc ) .",
    "@xcite in the strong - coupling regime , the efkm can be mapped onto the spin-@xmath13 ising - like xxz model with a uniform magnetic field . in that case",
    ", the spontaneous ei ordering corresponds to the spontaneous magnetization in the xy - plane and its phase diagram was also determined .",
    "@xcite the phase diagram of the efkm is composed of three phases : the charge - density - wave ( cdw ) with staggered orbital order ( soo ) phase , excitonic insulator ( ei ) phase , and band insulator ( bi ) phase .",
    "the cdw phase is characterized by the periodic modulation of the total density of @xmath7- and @xmath10-electrons , while the soo phase is characterized by the periodic modulation in the difference between the @xmath7- and @xmath10-electron densities .",
    "the instability toward the cdw and soo phases was studied in detail by zenker _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite the ei phase is characterized by the spontaneous @xmath7-@xmath10 hybridization .",
    "the bi phase is characterized by the completely filled @xmath7- or @xmath10-band .",
    "interestingly , the ground state phase diagram in the weak - to - intermediate - coupling regime obtained by a hartree - fock approximation ( hfa )  @xcite agrees quite well with that obtained by cpmc . on the other hand ,",
    "excitation properties of efkm are still of great interest .",
    "finite - temperature phase diagram and electron - hole bound state formation in efkm were studied by hfa .",
    "@xcite projector - based remormalization method ( prm ) calculation on the one - dimensional efkm  @xcite reported that incoherent parts of the single - particle excitation spectra , which are related to the dissociation of the excitons , appears especially in the bec regime .",
    "detailed studies on the dynamical excitonic susceptibility at finite - temperature calculated by use of the prm  @xcite and slave boson ( sb ) technique  @xcite confirmed that tightly bound excitons exist even above the critical temperature for exciton condensation .",
    "the results strongly support the so - called excitonic halo suggested by bronold and fehske ,  @xcite where tightly bound excitons exist without condensation , and the scenario of the bose - einstein condensation of preformed excitons in the semiconductor side .",
    "thus the effects of electron correlations on the static and dynamic properties of this model are worth studying . in this paper , we study the ei state of the efkm defined on the two - dimensional square lattice as a function of the coulomb interaction strength @xmath0 .",
    "we employ the variational cluster approximation ( vca )  @xcite based on the self - energy functional theory ( sft )  @xcite at zero temperature . the cluster perturbation theory ( cpt )  @xcite",
    "is used to calculate the single - particle green s functions .",
    "we also employ hfa to clarify the effects of electron correlation that can be taken into account in vca . as far as we know ,",
    "vca has not been applied to the study of the ei state of efkm .",
    "the advantage of vca compared to hfa is that vca can fully take into account static and dynamic effects of electron correlations within the range of a finite size cluster .",
    "so far , vca and cpt applied to a variety of strongly correlated electron systems , such as the half - filled hubbard model with competing magnetic orders in two - dimensional  @xcite and three - dimensional systems ,  @xcite periodic anderson model with the competition between magnetic ordering induced by the ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yoshida interaction and nonmagnetic kondo screening ,  @xcite multi - orbital system with spin - orbit coupling , xy - plane magnetic ordering ,  @xcite etc , and it turns out that the method is useful to discuss correlation effects on the symmetry breaking or single - particle excitation spectra , especially in the insulating state .",
    "thus it is worth studying the ei state of the efkm by applying vca and cpt to investigate the effects of short range correlations on the symmetry breaking or single - particle excitations .",
    "we will first discuss the @xmath0 dependence of the calculated ei order parameter and single - particle gap .",
    "in the weak - coupling regime , as expected from the bcs theory , the single - particle gap is scaled well by the order parameter , whereas in the strong - coupling regime , the order parameter rapidly decreases with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "then we will show the calculated momentum distribution functions as functions of @xmath0 . in the weak - coupling regime ,",
    "the momentum distribution functions behave like those in the bcs theory , whereas in the strong - coupling regime the momentum dependence of the momentum distribution functions becomes weak , and the behavior is quite different from bcs theory .",
    "the coherence length of the exciton shows a shallow minimum at the crossover regime as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "we further calculate the single - particle spectra , anomalous green s functions , and density of states in order to investigate the electron correlation effects on the quasi - particles .",
