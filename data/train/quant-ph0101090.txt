    "quantum bits ( _ qubits _ ) are the elementary units of information that are used to represent quantum data  @xcite .",
    "thus , the idea of a qubit underlies all investigations in the rapidly growing science of quantum information  including quantum information theory , quantum communication , quantum computation , quantum complexity , and quantum game theory  @xcite .",
    "in particular , qubits are the basic building blocks for defining the standard model of quantum computation as introduced by deutsch  @xcite , which has so far provided the appropriate representation for identifying and understanding _ efficient _ ways of processing information using quantum mechanics .",
    "its investigation resulted in feasible algorithms for factoring large integers  @xcite and for simulating many - particle quantum systems  @xcite , two problems not known to be efficiently solvable with classical computers .",
    "a qubit can be thought of as the extension of a classical bit obtained by applying the superposition principle .",
    "when quantum superposition states of many qubits are constructed in the tensor product state space that quantum mechanics prescribes for a composite system , quantum entanglement arises as an additional information resource with no classical counterpart .",
    "however , qubits share with classical bits the fundamental property of being a _ fungible _ information resource  @xcite : while both classical and quantum information is intended , in fact required , to be physically realized , it is _ abstractly _ defined and therefore independent of the details of the underlying physical realization .",
    "the fungibility property is essential to quantum information in two respects .",
    "first , by defining quantum information independent of the details of specific physical devices and their complex physics , it has been possible to study qubit properties at the abstract level and thus to obtain a deeper understanding of the distinctive features that qubits inherit from their intrinsic quantum - mechanical nature . examples of fundamental results following from the basic properties of superpositions and of the randomness associated with quantum measurements include the fact that qubits in an unknown quantum state can not be perfectly copied ( no - cloning theorem @xcite ) and they can not be broadcast ( no - broadcasting theorem @xcite ) .",
    "on the other hand they can be reliably communicated by means of the quantum teleportation protocol  @xcite , an extremely useful protocol with many applications  @xcite .",
    "second , from a practical standpoint , the arbitrariness of the physical realization implied by fungibility allows for greater flexibility in the identification and design of quantum information processors .",
    "this is reflected in the amazing variety of representations of qubits that have appeared in recent proposals for physical realizations of quantum computers  @xcite . while such variety greatly increases the number of physical systems with the potential for quantum information processing , it can be intimidating when considering a new prospective system for implementing qubits .",
    "as recently observed by divincenzo  @xcite , `` recognizing a qubit can be trickier than one might think '' .",
    "thus to determine the suitability of a physical system for quantum information processing we need to answer the following basic questions : what is a qubit , and how do we look for them ?    in this paper",
    ", we identify essential criteria to be met by a system to contain physical embodiments of qubits .",
    "our primary goal is to develop the intuition needed for `` distilling '' qubits from physical systems , in the hope that such intuition will serve as a guide for exploring the full range of possibilities available for physical implementation .",
    "we do so by revisiting a few prototypical examples to obtain a general operational characterization of qubits .",
    "the examples are examined in detail in section  [ sect : fungibility ] .",
    "the first example shows how the state space of a collection of bosonic modes can be exploited for representing qubits based on the requirement of obtaining realizable control over the qubit observables .",
    "the second and third example are essentially motivated by reconsidering the notion of what a qubit is in the light of our knowledge from quantum error - correcting methods .",
    "in particular , we analyze two situations where a qubit can be embedded into the larger state space of three physical two - state systems in a way which makes it robust against noise to first - order in time and to arbitrary orders in time , respectively . as the level of abstraction required for constructing our example qubits grows , the qubit states are less easily related to states of the underlying physical degrees of freedom , and more powerful mathematical tools are required to describe the qubits .",
    "the emerging qubit criteria are summarized in section  [ sect : criteria ] .",
    "our analysis points to the crucial role played by _",
    "control resources _ in determining a preferred qubit realization , and to an operator picture in terms of _ quantum observables _ , rather than states , as the appropriate framework for capturing the idea of a qubit in full generality .",
    "the first proposals for quantum computers implemented qubits literally by exploiting explicit two level systems",
    ". examples of qubits in these proposals include the two levels corresponding to absence and presence of a photon in a mode  @xcite , spin @xmath0 nuclear spins @xcite , and the ground and one of the excited states of ions @xcite .",
    "the proposals have in common the goal of implementing qubits at the fundamental level of a physical system .",
    "the recognition of how fragile these qubits states are led to the development of quantum error correction , which necessarily involves maintaining the information by distributing it in a controlled way over a potentially large number of physical systems . as a result",
    "we reconsidered the notion of a qubit .    to illustrate the different facets of the notion of a qubit we determine how an entity equivalent to an abstractly defined qubit can be constructed in three prototypical situations .",
    "an abstractly defined qubit can be identified with an ideal two - state quantum system q whose associated state space is a two - dimensional complex hilbert space @xmath1 .",
    "an orthonormal basis @xmath2 and we make the identification @xmath3 , @xmath4 with vectors in @xmath5 . operations on states are conveniently expressed in terms of the pauli operators @xmath6 , which obey commutation and anti - commutation relationships of the form @xmath7 & = & 2i \\,\\sum_\\gamma      \\varepsilon_{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma }     \\sigma_\\gamma \\ : , \\label{comm } \\\\   \\",
    "{ \\sigma_\\alpha , \\sigma_\\beta \\ } & = & 2 \\,\\delta_{\\alpha\\beta } { \\leavevmode\\hbox{\\small1\\normalsize\\kern-.33em1}}\\ : ,   \\label{anticomm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath8 , and @xmath9 and @xmath10 being the completely antisymmetric symbol and the identity on @xmath11 , respectively . to simplify notations ,",
    "we define @xmath12 .",
    "as we will see , the abstract state space of a qubit is not necessarily directly related to the state space of the physical systems .",
    "however , the operators are naturally embedded in the operator algebras associated with the physical observables .",
    "bosonic qubits are the basic building blocks in a recent proposal for linear optics quantum computation ( loqc ) @xcite . the relevant physical system is a collection of @xmath13 distinguishable modes which describe the elementary excitations of the quantized electro - magnetic field @xcite .",
    "each mode is characterized by annihilation and creation operators @xmath14 , @xmath15 , which satisfy bosonic commutation rules @xmath16= [ { \\bf a}_k^\\dagger , { \\bf a}_{k'}^\\dagger]=0 $ ] , @xmath17=\\delta_{k k'}$ ] .",
    "in particular , number states of mode @xmath18 are defined as eigenstates of the number operator @xmath19 for mode @xmath18 , @xmath20 is the overall state space in which we have to look for qubits .",
    "we use the abbreviation @xmath21 for product number states in @xmath22",
    ".    clearly , a variety of ( inequivalent ) prescriptions are conceivable for representing qubits in @xmath22 . in loqc ,",
    "an encoding based on two modes and one boson is adopted via the mapping @xmath23 for a qubit supported by modes @xmath24 .",
    "this choice is motivated by the potential for easy implementations of single qubit transformations via passive linear optical elements .",
    "it is worth pointing out that encodings similar to the above , where the degree of freedom carrying quantum information is identified with the presence of a quasi - particle in one of two modes or sites , or the presence / absence of a quasi - particle in a single mode or site , can make sense for quantum statistics other than the bosonic one .",
    "thus , the present discussion is relevant to situations where information is stored in anyonic @xcite or fermionic @xcite qubits . a different scheme for embedding a generic finite - dimensional quantum system ( or _ qudit _ ) in the state space of bosonic degrees of freedom",
    "was recently proposed in  @xcite .    according to ( [ bq ] ) , the state space of the bosonic qubit , @xmath25 . by letting @xmath26",
    "denote the eigenvalue of the joint number operator @xmath27 , one has formally @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the subspace of states in @xmath30 with @xmath31 bosons , and @xmath32 .",
    "the state space of @xmath33 bosonic qubits , which is obtained via an effective tensor - product construction of one - qubit spaces , likewise relates to the overall state space @xmath22 in a non - trivial way . assuming a pairing between modes of the form @xmath34 for the @xmath35th encoded qubit , @xmath36",
    ", we obtain @xmath37   \\simeq \\big [ { { \\cal h}}_{{\\sf q}_1 } \\otimes { { \\cal h}}_{{\\sf q}_2 } \\ldots \\otimes   { { \\cal h}}_{{\\sf q}_n } \\big ] \\oplus \\tilde{{{\\cal h}}}\\ : , \\label{mqss}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where for each two - mode state space @xmath38 a decomposition similar to ( [ sqss ] ) has been used , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 collects all the contributions with excitation different from one in at least one of the pairs of modes .",
    "several remarks on the above state space structure are in order . in the one - qubit case",
    ", the presence of the summand @xmath41 in ( [ sqss ] ) causes the bosonic qubit to be effectively embedded into a larger state space where infinitely many `` non - qubit '' levels are present .",
    "one can formally rewrite this separation so that the additional levels form part of an effective environment  @xcite .",
    "the formal state space of the two resulting interacting subsystems is written as @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are adjoined `` vacuum '' states , and we make the identification @xmath45 .",
    "the idea generalizes to @xmath33 qubits , in which case the role of the effective `` non - qubit '' environment is assumed by @xmath40 in ( [ mqss ] ) . whenever a non - zero amplitude is found in the space @xmath40 , one or more qubits have `` leaked - out '' from the intended logical space @xmath46 so that the state no longer maps to a state of qubits . to guarantee that the state belongs to the qubits for _ all _ times @xmath47",
    "means restricting the overall evolution operator @xmath48 to the sub - manifold of unitary operators @xmath49 .",
    "it is essential to realize that such a requirement is in general unnecessary as well as overly restrictive .",
    "while care should be taken to ensure that no leakage allows the qubits to stray away from the logical space at the beginning and at the end of every quantum gate , one should not insist on retaining a mapping into qubits at every intermediate time .",
    "in other words , qubits need only exist _ stroboscopically _ in time .    in the loqc proposal , relaxing",
    "the constraint of well - defined qubit states at intermediate steps is indispensable for achieving the required two - bit conditional dynamics .",
    "for example , in  @xcite , the most basic conditional sign - flip gate c-@xmath50 on two bosonic qubits , say @xmath51 and @xmath52 , is decomposed into a sequence of operations @xmath53 where both the beam - splitter gate @xmath54 and the non - deterministic gate @xmath55 on mode @xmath56 cause a temporary departure from the one - excitation space of each qubit .",
    "this implementation is also non - deterministic , meaning that it requires post - selection , with a known success probability . in  @xcite ,",
    "the non - determinism can be removed by exploiting the quantum teleportation protocol @xcite .    in spite of the complicated underlying state space structure , a bosonic qubit @xmath57 can be straightforwardly characterized in terms of its generating observables . on the @xmath13-mode state space @xmath22 ,",
    "define the operator @xmath58 on @xmath30 , and @xmath10 elsewhere .",
    "@xmath59 satisfies @xmath60 , and @xmath61 hence , the restriction @xmath62 of @xmath59 to @xmath30 , @xmath63 , and the product @xmath64 : = @xmath65 , @xmath66 , are the projectors onto the one - qubit and the @xmath33-qubit space , respectively . clearly , the action of @xmath62 is the identity operation when further restricted to the qubit space , _ i.e. _ @xmath67 , where @xmath68 means equality over @xmath69 . for fixed @xmath70 ,",
    "one finds that @xmath71 from this one can readily check that the following operators act as encoded generating observables for the bosonic qubit @xmath57 , with @xmath72 : @xmath73 and @xmath74/2i =- i z_{{\\sf q}(k , k')}x_{{\\sf q}(k , k')}$ ] .",
    "these observables obey commutation / anti - commutation rules identical to ( [ comm])-([anticomm ] ) .",
    "evolutions generated by the hamiltonians given in ( [ bqobs ] ) can be readily constructed from the action of optical phase shifters and beam splitters respectively , which allows for an easy implementation of arbitrary one qubit ( @xmath75 ) gates via passive linear optics .",
    "the final ingredients that are required to make the bosonic qubit useful include the ability to initialize the qubit in the intended logical space @xmath69 , and the ability to read - out the qubit observables . in loqc",
    ", the state preparation of qubit @xmath57 can be accomplished by using a single - photon source to prepare mode @xmath18 in @xmath76 and mode @xmath77 in @xmath78 . to measure the bosonic qubit it suffices to use a photo - detector on the mode @xmath18 , which destructively determines whether one or more photons were present in the mode .",
    "further details are in @xcite .",
    "our second example comes from quantum error correction using stabilizer codes .",
    "consider the simplest possible situation , where we wish to protect one quantum bit against single bit - flip errors by encoding it into three physical qubits .",
    "a quantum code can be specified by a two - dimensional subspace of the overall state space @xmath22 , @xmath79 .",
    "to protect against single bit - flip errors , a repetition code @xmath80 can be defined by the encoding @xmath81 it is easily checked that @xmath80 satisfies the necessary and sufficient conditions for error - recovery with respect to the error set @xmath82  @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath83 for errors in @xmath84 .",
    "let @xmath85 denote the subspace spanned by @xmath86 , for @xmath87 , and let us choose as orthonormal bases in the @xmath85 s the result of applying the errors to the logical states ( [ code2 ] ) , _ i.e. _ @xmath88 with @xmath89 , @xmath87 , @xmath90",
    ". then @xmath91 and a recovery super - operator can be explicitly constructed by defining , for each error @xmath92 , @xmath93 the fact that the quantum operation @xmath94 defined by @xmath95 for density operators @xmath96 actually restores the state of the encoded qubit after an error in @xmath84 happens is due to the property that every combination @xmath97 is a multiple of the identity operation on @xmath80 .",
    "thus , the basic idea for using this code is to apply @xmath98 after the errors happened .",
    "while this procedure successfully protects our bit of quantum information , it is conceptually dissatisfying , because it would appear that _",
    "after _ the errors happened , but _ before",
    "_ application of @xmath98 , the information is corrupted by noise .",
    "is there a representation that clearly separates errors and information in such a way that it is clear that the quantum information is never affected ?",
    "in other words , where does the protected qubit reside both before and after errors occurred ?    the basic insight is to regard the error - correcting code as an appropriate _ subsystem _  @xcite .",
    "this is possible by establishing the mapping @xmath99 for the basis vectors of the @xmath85 s ( hence @xmath22 ) introduced before . in the right hand - side of ( [ qmap ] ) ,",
    "the @xmath100 vectors , @xmath87 , are taken as basis states of a two - dimensional complex space that will serve as the protected qubit state space , while the @xmath101 store the bit string that uniquely identifies the error syndrome .",
    "essentially , the state @xmath101 is meant to fully encode the effect of the noise on the code .",
    "the correspondence ( [ qmap ] ) is a prescription for decomposing the physical coding space @xmath22 into the tensor product of a qubit space @xmath102 and a syndrome space @xmath103 : @xmath104 if we choose to represent the syndrome corresponding to @xmath105 ( no error ) by @xmath106 , then clearly @xmath107 , we find @xmath108    \\otimes   |v_a^0 \\rangle_{{{\\cal e } } } =   |\\psi \\rangle_{{{\\cal q } } } \\otimes       the last equality the mapping ( [ code3 ] ) is made explicit . by construction ,",
    "the vector @xmath101 depends on @xmath109 alone .",
    "thus , information in @xmath102 is completely unaffected by errors in @xmath84 : the factor @xmath102 in ( [ code3 ] ) is the qubit subsystem where the protected quantum information resides .",
    "it is worth comparing this picture with the familiar description of the error - correcting code based on the stabilizer formalism @xcite . in the stabilizer language ,",
    "the code @xmath80 is characterized by its stabilizer group , @xmath110 s is generated by @xmath111 and @xmath112 , and the code @xmath80 is a joint eigenspace of the two stabilizer generators . the commutation pattern between each error @xmath109 and the stabilizer generators @xmath113 diagnoses the error syndrome completely . in our case",
    ", it simply reads @xmath114 , @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 , where @xmath118 encodes whether the error commutes or anti - commutes with the corresponding generator , respectively .",
    "a basis of the state space of the three qubits can be built from joint eigenvectors of a sufficiently large ( maximal ) set of commuting operators .",
    "such a set can be obtained by adding to @xmath119 and @xmath120 the operator @xmath121 ( for example ) .",
    "the corresponding joint eigenvectors may be labeled @xmath122 , where , for convenience , we denote by @xmath123 not the @xmath124 eigenvalues of the corresponding operators @xmath125 , but the eigenvalues of the projectors onto the @xmath126 subspace _",
    "e.g. _ , the label @xmath127 ( @xmath128 ) corresponds to a @xmath129 ( @xmath126 ) eigenvalue of the operator @xmath130 .",
    "the code @xmath80 is then spanned by the vectors @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "the quantum number @xmath133 can be thought of as labeling a two - state degree of freedom .",
    "this also translates into a prescription for decomposing the overall coding space , @xmath134 via a correspondence of the form @xmath135 note that this prescription is not unique , as it depends on the choice of phase of the different eigenvectors .",
    "( it can be made unique by considering @xmath130 and the global flip @xmath136 as generators for the algebra of observables for the degree of freedom carried by @xmath137 . )",
    "the difference between the representations ( [ qmap2 ] ) and ( [ qmap ] ) accounts for the different views of error - correcting codes that comes from the subsystem idea .",
    "the difference can be explicitly appreciated by looking at the correspondences between the states in the two factorizations .",
    "we have , for instance , @xmath138 but @xmath139 meaning that the degree of freedom @xmath137 has its values flipped by some error combination and is therefore not explicitly protected . specifically , @xmath140 \\simeq   [ |c_0 |1 \\rangle_{\\sf q ' } + c_1 |0 \\rangle_{\\sf q'}]\\otimes     @xmath137 conditional on the state of @xmath141 .",
    "thus , while in this picture error detection and error recovery necessarily appear as two separate steps , the earlier factorization ( [ qmap ] ) makes sure that the need for an explicit error correction step is removed once information is properly stored : to first order in time , the effect of the noise is only to `` heat '' the ancillary degrees of freedom carried by the syndrome subsystem @xmath103 , and all that is required to recover from errors is to `` reset '' the latter subsystem to the state @xmath106 .",
    "this is exactly what the recovery quantum operation @xmath98 accomplishes , as is clear by representing every operator @xmath142 in ( [ recovery ] ) using the mapping ( [ qmap ] ) , _ i.e. _ @xmath143    the best method for characterizing the protected qubit living in @xmath102 is in terms of its observables .",
    "this is easily done by starting with the obvious observables restricted to the code subspace : @xmath144 can then be obtained by applying the errors in the following way : @xmath145 note that the required behavior of @xmath146 , @xmath147 on the subsystem @xmath102 follows from the property that each operator @xmath148 in ( [ obscode ] ) , @xmath149 or @xmath150 , has the intended action on states of the form @xmath151 , @xmath87 . the relevant commutation and anti - commutation rules ( [ comm])-([anticomm ] ) are readily verified .",
    "in addition to belonging to the set of operators commuting with the stabilizer group ( the so - called normalizer @xmath152 @xcite ) , the above qubit observables have the property that they also commute with every operator that is a repeated combination of a reset operator followed by an error , _ e.g. _ @xmath153 .",
    "this sheds light on the algebraic nature of our three - bit subsystem , which is characterized as a _",
    "noiseless subsystem _ of the multiplicative algebra @xmath154 constructed from recovery operators followed by errors generated by a linear set of operators @xmath155 contains all the linear complex combinations of products of operators in @xmath156 . ] .",
    "the fact that _ every _ quantum error - correcting code can be pictured as a noiseless subsystem of a suitable operator algebra is established in  @xcite .",
    "consider a system @xmath157 composed by three physical , distinguishable spin @xmath0 particles .",
    "suppose that the interaction with the environment @xmath158 results in a particularly simple form of noise , _ collective _ noise , where @xmath158 couples in a symmetric way to each spin  @xcite .",
    "a relevant example of this situation occurs when the spins couple identically to a fluctuating magnetic field .",
    "our task is to devise a scheme for embedding in @xmath157 a qubit that is protected to noise .    for collective noise ,",
    "the interaction hamiltonian @xmath159 can we written as @xmath160 where @xmath161 , @xmath162 , are the components of the total spin angular momentum and the @xmath163 s are linearly independent environment operators .",
    "note that the operators @xmath164 are the generators of a lie group @xmath165 which corresponds to global spatial rotations of the spins , and can be identified with the familiar @xmath165 of angular momentum theory @xcite .",
    "suppose that the self - hamiltonian of the spins can also be expressed in terms of the @xmath166 .",
    "one possibility for constructing a protected qubit is to look for a pair of simultaneous degenerate eigenstates of the @xmath164 s @xcite _ i.e. _ , @xmath167 since the eigenvalues @xmath168 do not depend on @xmath169 , the two eigenstates can not be distinguished by the environment .",
    "thus , if they can be found , they define a basis of a protected qubit s state space . in our case",
    ", one finds that ( [ deg ] ) can be only satisfied with @xmath170 span a semi - simple lie algebra @xmath171 @xcite . ] , meaning that the states @xmath172 belong to the so - called @xmath173 singlet representation of @xmath171 _ i.e. _ they are invariant under @xmath165 rotations .",
    "unfortunately , no state of three spin @xmath0 particles obeys this invariance condition , and a minimum number of four physical spin @xmath0 particles is required for the singlet representation to occur with degeneracy at least two  @xcite . in spite of this impossibility to find a _",
    "subspace _ of the three - spin state space @xmath22 which is immune against noise , it turns out that we are still able to construct a _",
    "noiseless subsystem _ of @xmath22  @xcite by considering observables commuting with the @xmath164 s .",
    "the idea , which we describe next , is to identify in @xmath22 a protected degree of freedom .",
    "since the hamiltonians @xmath164 generate the spatial rotation group acting symmetrically on the three spins , it is natural to decompose the state space @xmath22 of the spins according to the total angular momentum @xmath174 : @xmath175 where the subspaces @xmath176 are the eigenspaces of @xmath177 corresponding to angular momentum @xmath178 , with @xmath179 .",
    "they have dimension dim@xmath180 , dim@xmath181 , respectively .",
    "let us focus on the @xmath182 component .",
    "the fact that @xmath183 has dimension four implies that the two - dimensional spin-@xmath0 representation of the rotation group occurs twice , meaning that physically there are two distinct , equivalent routes for generating angular momentum @xmath182 which , for our three - spin system , reads @xmath184 @xcite . ] .",
    "a basis of states for @xmath183 is constructed by considering joint @xmath177 , @xmath185-eigenvectors , @xmath186 , where @xmath187 is the @xmath185-eigenvalue and the quantum number @xmath188 identifies which of the distinct routes the corresponding eigenvector belongs to . because angular momentum operators @xmath164 are confined to act non - trivially and equivalently within each route , the @xmath164 have an identical , diagonal action on the degree of freedom supported by the quantum number @xmath188 .",
    "this degenerate behavior of noise operators with respect to @xmath188 is exactly the two - fold degeneracy we are looking for .",
    "a better grasp of the protected structure which is emerging in @xmath183 is obtained by establishing the mapping @xmath189 where now @xmath190 is an orthonormal basis in @xmath191 and @xmath192 is the @xmath185-eigenvector with eigenvalue @xmath187 .",
    "under such an identification , the subspace @xmath183 can be represented as @xmath193 the actions of the noise operators @xmath164 on @xmath183 take a correspondingly simple form , @xmath194 where @xmath195 is a unit linear combination of pauli operators which depends on the choice of basis states in @xmath11 .",
    "these algebraic identities provide the starting point for identifying @xmath183 as the state space of an effective bi - partite system , and for associating an abstract subsystem to each factor in the tensor product ( [ factors ] ) . in particular , by virtue of the identity action of noise operators in ( [ actions ] ) , the left factor @xmath11 provides a _ noiseless _ subsystem where a qubit can safely reside , protected from noise for ( ideally ) arbitrarily long times .    because the @xmath191-basis vectors @xmath196 are left arbitrary in ( [ factors ] ) ,",
    "various realizations are possible as basis states of our three - spin noiseless qubit .",
    "two convenient choices are listed below : @xmath197 which can be easily built up from singlet / triplet states of spins 1 and 2 @xcite , or @xmath198 with @xmath199 , which connects directly with standard basis states for the two - dimensional irreducible representation * d*@xmath200 of the permutation group @xmath201 acting on the spins  @xcite . in ( [ basis1])-[basis2 ] ) , the notations @xmath202 and @xmath203 have been used to account for the different choices of the basis states @xmath204 in @xmath11 .",
    "it is important to realize that a possibly mixed state of @xmath22 of the form @xmath205 , where @xmath206 and @xmath207 is an arbitrary density operator on @xmath208 , is a pure state of the qubit living in @xmath11 .",

    "the method can be systematized and the introduction of a different state space can be avoided by directly considering the set of physical observables available for the three spins .",
    "observables that are not affected by the interaction operators @xmath164 are the scalars under spatial rotations , which are given by @xmath209 since these scalars commute with the interactions , their expectations are protected from noise .",
    "if we can combine them so that their expectations define states of a qubit , a noiseless qubit has been found .",
    "it is sufficient to form combinations that algebraically behave like the pauli operators .",

    "then the following choice of observables works and corresponds to the @xmath214-basis introduced above : @xmath215 where @xmath216 is the unitary operator swapping the first two spins .",

    "similar expressions hold for the singlet - triplet basis ( [ basis1 ] ) , _ e.g. _",
    "@xmath221 , and @xmath222 .",
    "since the commutation and anti - commutation rules obeyed by the observables are identical to ( [ comm])-([anticomm ] ) , the operator algebra they generate by multiplication and hermitian conjugation is the algebra of a two - state quantum system .    an important simplification to the above discussion is worth mentioning .",
    "this occurs when not only @xmath177 but also @xmath185 are good ( _ i.e. _ conserved ) quantum numbers for the dynamics of the three physical spins . in this case , using appropriate encoded states rather than the physical three - spin states is motivated by the possibility of achieving universal control by means of purely angular momentum preserving quantum gates .",
    "note that three is the minimal number of physical qubits allowing for simultaneous eigenvectors of @xmath223 with degeneracy at least equal to two .",
    "the resulting qubits are the basic ingredients in a recent proposal for universal quantum computation via exchange interactions @xcite .",
    "the mathematical description of these qubits is simpler than the one of the noiseless three - spin case , as the full subsystem structure ( [ factors ] ) is not required .",
    "the relevant observation is that if no mixing between the sets of states in @xmath183 corresponding to @xmath224 occurs , a further decomposition applies within the @xmath183 subspace : @xmath225 this means that the two subspaces spanned by @xmath226 and @xmath227 , @xmath228 ( the first and second pair of states in either ( [ basis1 ] ) or ( [ basis2 ] ) ) are _ individually _ capable of encoding a qubit . of course",
    ", none of these qubits will retain the robust behavior against all collective noise . over each @xmath191-summand of ( [ summands ] ) ,",
    "the relevant qubit observables are still given by the combinations of scalars determined above .",
    "note that , once a fixed angular momentum component is chosen , say @xmath229 , states belonging to @xmath230 as well as to @xmath231 behave as `` non - qubit '' levels similarly to what we encountered in the case of the bosonic qubit . in particular , this results in a many - qubit state space structure analogous to ( [ mqss ] ) , with a non - trivial summand @xmath40 accounting for all the possible `` non - qubit '' configurations .",
    "explicit prescriptions are mentioned in @xcite for both initializing the logical qubit to the @xmath232 state , and for implementing the final qubit measurement .",
    "initialization may be achieved by relying on the natural equilibration processes of the physical spins in the presence of a polarizing magnetic field , while measurement of the qubit in the @xmath233 criteria for a qubit --------------------    so what is a qubit ? from the mathematical point of view , the main lesson that emerges from the above examples , and from the many others that can be analyzed along similar lines , is that the algebraic notion of a _ subsystem _ provides the most general framework for capturing the variety of ways in which qubits may be constructed .",
    "subsystems , intended as factors ( in the tensor product sense ) of subspaces of a possibly larger state space , are the structures where we have identified qubits throughout our analysis . because the information - carrying qubits can be far removed from the `` natural '' physical systems that a device is based on , states of qubit subsystems often look complicated when expressed in a basis associated with the physical degrees of freedom , making it difficult to recognize their properties and dynamical behavior .",
    "the situation is much simpler , and the description more compact , if the qubit is realized in an _ operator _ sense through its _",
    "observables_.    the idea of describing quantum systems in terms of operators forming a complex associative algebra , whose hermitian elements provide the system s observables , underlies the operator approach to quantum and quantum - statistical mechanics @xcite .",
    "similarly , the general definition of a subsystem is motivated @xcite by a fundamental representation theorem for finite dimensional associative operator algebras closed under hermitian conjugation , stating that for any such algebra @xmath154 a direct sum representation of the overall state space @xmath22 exists , @xmath234 in such a way that @xmath154 has identity action over each of the factors @xmath235 s , @xmath236 .",
    "thus , if @xmath154 is the algebra constructed from noise operators ( _ interaction algebra _",
    "@xcite ) , a noiseless factor ( subsystem ) @xmath235 is naturally characterized by an irreducible representation of the so - called _ commutant _ @xmath237 , which is formed from the operators commuting with everything in @xmath154 .    motivated by this general perspective",
    ", a necessary condition for having a qubit is that it is a subsystem whose associative operator algebra is identical with ( isomorphic to ) the `` right '' operator algebra of a two - state quantum system , _",
    "i.e. _ one whose generators satisfy the set of composition rules specified in ( [ comm])-([anticomm ] ) . notice that this requirement is stronger than the one based on the @xmath171 commutation rules ( [ comm ] ) alone . while the latter are crucial in determining the appropriate _ lie_-algebraic structure ( thereby obtaining the correct symmetry properties ) of our qubit , ( [ comm ] ) and ( [ anticomm ] ) together are necessary ( and sufficient ) for ensuring the correct _ associative _ structure of the relevant algebra .",
    "in particular , the condition @xmath238 should hold for the generating observables @xmath239 to ensure that the appropriate representation in terms of an abstract spin-1/2 particle is realized .    how sensible is this definition from a physical standpoint ?",
    "looking back at our examples once more , one observes that identifying the correct algebraic structure does not guarantee by itself the ability of using the associated subsystem as a qubit . in a sense , this is only the first step toward constructing a qubit .",
    "suppose , however , that we did actually succeed at determining a set of observables which generate the correct operator algebra , and suppose , in addition , that we have the capabilities for implementing the following manipulations :    * _ unitary control_@xmath240 apply the observables as hamiltonians to effect universal control operations on the subsystem . *",
    "_ initialization_@xmath240 apply suitable non - unitary control , _",
    "i.e. _ a quantum operation , so as to leave the subsystem in a state whose expectation on the observables matches that of @xmath241 for some choice of the observable @xmath242 . *",
    "_ read - out_@xmath240 strong version : perform von neumann projective measurements of the subsystem observables , which together with unitary control implies the ability to initialize .",
    "weak version : perform weak ensemble measurements of the subsystem observables .",
    "then what we have constructed is , for all practical purposes , a qubit .",
    "we have provided an operational guideline for constructing qubits in physical systems .",
    "our analysis emphasizes the role of operator algebras and observables as the most powerful and comprehensive language to be used for defining qubits in full generality .",
    "one obvious implication is that a qubit ends up being a much more versatile and general object than one might at first conceive of . in a broader context , it was recently argued by steane  @xcite that a picture in terms of operators rather than state vectors could provide a more insightful perspective for understanding various aspects of quantum information processing , including the origin of the apparent improvements in efficiency over classical information processing . in a sense , a definition of the qubit in general operator terms",
    "can then be regarded as the first necessary step of this program .",
