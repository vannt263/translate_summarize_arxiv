    "in addition , hairpins are commonly used in dna - based nanotechnology , for instance as fuels in motors@xcite , as bio - sensors@xcite , or for controlling self - assembly pathways@xcite .",
    "together with duplex hybridization , hairpin formation is one of the most basic dynamical process involving nucleic acids and therefore a fundamental understanding of this process is of wide - ranging importance .",
    "there have been many experimental and theoretical studies on the effects of different parameters such as the loop length , the sequence and the ionic strength of the solvent on the dynamics and thermodynamics of nucleic acid hairpins@xcite .",
    "dna hairpin formation is considered to be predominantly a two - state process with a rate - limiting step which involves loop closure and a subsequent rapid zippering of the stem@xcite .",
    "this hypothesis has been challenged by several recent studies that suggest a more complex pathway , involving intermediate states containing misfolded or partially folded configurations@xcite .",
    "additionally , there have been diverse , and sometimes contradictory , experimental observations and interpretations of hairpin formation kinetics .",
    "fluorescence energy transfer and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy measurements@xcite have reported an arrhenius temperature dependency with a positive activation enthalpy for the hairpin closing rates .",
    "other studies@xcite have reported a non - monotonic variation of the closing time with temperature and an effective activation enthalpy that switches sign from positive to negative close to the hairpin melting temperature .",
    "the reason for the positive activation enthalpy at low tempera@xmath0ure has been posited to be the slow configurational diffusion of the single - stranded dna ( ssdna ) due to the intrachain interactions@xcite .",
    "for example , in ref . , it was argued that the intrachain interactions , including non - native wc bonds and also misstacked bases in the loop , increase the ruggedness of the free - energy surface at the early stages of hairpin formation , which in turn decreases the configurational diffusion coefficient and makes it significantly temperature dependent .",
    "an alternative explanation is that the positive activation enthalpy is a result of an increase in the ssdna stiffness due to increasingly strong stacking in the loop as the temperature is decreased@xcite .",
    "evidence for this position comes also from experiments on the possible effects of the loop sequence on hairpin thermodynamics and dynamics@xcite .",
    "these experiments found that the melting temperature of a hairpin with a more strongly stacking poly(da ) loop is lower than for the equivalent hairpin with a poly(dt ) loop , and that the hairpin closing times are longer for the hairpin with the poly(da ) loop .    to investigate in detail the effects of base stacking and non - native watson - crick ( wc ) base pairing ( _ i.e. _  misbonding ) on the stability and dynamics of hairpins",

    "importantly , oxdna incorporates single - stranded stacking interactions and allows for the formation of non - native base pairs ( base pairs that are not intended to be present in the stem ) .",
    "we first investigate whether oxdna reproduces the non - monotonic dependence of hairpin closing times on temperature@xcite , and explore the role of stacking and non - native base pairs in the observed behaviour .",
    "we then consider perturbed stacking strengths to establish the sensitivity of hairpin closing times to this physical parameter .",
    "in oxdna , each nucleotide is modelled as a rigid body with three interaction sites ( see figure [ fig : model ] ) .",
    "the interaction potential consists of terms representing the backbone connectivity , excluded volume , hydrogen bonding between wc complementary base pairs , stacking between adjacent bases along the chain , coaxial stacking between non - adjacent bases , and cross stacking . aside from backbone connectivity and",
    "excluded volume , all interactions are anisotropic , depending on the relative orientation of the nucleotides .",
    "the interactions are designed to favor the formation of a right - handed double helix at low temperature .",

    "oxdna is particularly suited to the present study as it has been designed to reproduce the thermodynamic and mechanical properties of both single- and double - stranded dna@xcite . as oxdna incorporates single - stranded stacking interactions , and allows for the formation of non - native base pairs ,",
    "simulating the model allows us to explore the consequences of these physical aspects of dna for hairpin formation kinetics .",
    "in addition , oxdna has been shown to accurately reproduce the most important aspects of the kinetics of dna duplex hybridization@xcite and toehold - mediated dna strand displacement@xcite .",

    "we have found that vmmc greatly improves the equilibration speed in oxdna@xcite .",
    "in addition , in order to efficiently sample the free - energy landscapes of these hairpin systems , we use the umbrella sampling technique@xcite .",
    "umbrella sampling allows the system to overcome free - energy barriers by artificially biasing the system to sample states with higher free energy more frequently .",
    "base stacking and hydrogen bonding between complementary base pairs are the two crucial interactions that cause dna to behave differently from a normal polymer chain . here , to investigate the role of stacking interactions on the dynamics of hairpin formation , we perform additional simulations in which all stacking interactions in the loop are scaled by a factor @xmath13 relative to their ( sequence - dependent ) values from ref . ; @xmath14 therefore corresponds to the canonical values quoted in ref . .",

    "the existence of this minimum clearly shows that the formation of this hairpin is a non - arrhenius process with an apparent activation enthalpy @xmath37 that changes sign at @xmath36   and becomes larger in magnitude as the temperature deviates more from @xmath36  .",

    "nevertheless , the changes we measure in our relative rates are of a similar order to those measured in the experiments @xcite . in addition , the overall shift of the oxdna curve to higher temperatures compared to the experimental curve may in part reflect the further stabilization of the @xmath17 hairpin at higher salt concentrations . for example , the relative melting temperatures are at in oxdna and at in the experiment .",
    "we note that duplex hybridization in the oxdna model also exhibits non - arrhenius behaviour , where the apparent activation enthalpy , although always negative , increases in magnitude with increasing temperature@xcite .    to better understand the non - arrhenius behaviour associated with the hairpin formation",

    "the values of @xmath30 and @xmath31 are obtained using the ffs technique@xcite .",
    "we note that the basic assumption in the application of ffs to measure rates of hairpin formation is that the zippering of the stem is much faster than the loop closure .",
    "this assumption is valid for the hairpin studied here , since @xmath26 computed with brute - force simulations that do include the zippering time agrees with the @xmath26 obtained with the ffs method .",
    "figure  [ fig : closingtime](c ) shows that the success probability @xmath31 is significantly reduced when the temperature is raised . at high temperatures ,",
    "a single base pair is not sufficiently stable to ensure formation of the complete hairpin and most of the times the loop opens up before zippering of the rest of the stem occurs .",
    "the rate limiting step for the formation of the hairpin at those temperatures therefore involves the search for a state which has on average more than one base pair .",
    "although hairpin formation is predominantly a two state process , it is characterized by a complex set of transition states that have on average a larger number of base pairs at higher temperatures .",
    "as these transition states are enthalpically more stable ( due to the base pairing ) than the open state , a negative activation enthalpy is observed at high temperatures ( where @xmath30 is relatively temperature independent ) whose magnitude increases with increasing temperature .",
    "negative activation enthalpies were previously observed for hybridization of oxdna duplexes for similar reasons @xcite .",
    "on lowering the temperature , @xmath31 increases until it reaches a plateau at very low temperatures . in this regime",
    "the temperature dependence is dominated by the change in the average time it takes to form the first stem - stem base pair ( _ i_.e .",
    "@xmath30 ) .",
    "the rapid increase of @xmath30 with decreasing temperature causes the closing time to pass through a minimum and then increase again . thus the apparent activation enthalpy becomes positive at low temperatures .",
    "the positive activation enthalpy can be caused by variation in the enthalpy of the open state as well as the enthalpy of transition state ensemble .",
    "we will explore the microscopic origins of the low - temperature rise of @xmath26 later .",
    "to gain further insight into the mechanism of hairpin formation we compute the free energies of the hairpin using the umbrella sampling technique . in figure",

    "in particular , we calculate the average opening time @xmath41 from the relation @xmath42 , where the equilibrium constant @xmath43 is the ratio of the partition functions of the closed ( with at least one stem - stem base pair ) and open states .",
    "the ratio can readily be obtained from free - energy profiles , such as those illustrated in figure  [ fig : f](a ) . the arrhenius - plot in figure  [ fig : f](b ) illustrates that , in contrast to hairpin formation , the opening of the @xmath17 hairpin exhibits arrhenius behaviour in the temperature range of our study .",
    "we showed that the apparent activation enthalpy of the formation of the @xmath17 hairpin inferred from the kinetic data is positive at low temperatures , implying that the enthalpy of the open state is lower than the enthalpy of the transition state .",
    "this is in contrast to the apparent negative activation enthalpy at high temperatures . in figure",

    "while the sign of @xmath45 is in agreement with our kinetic data , the apparent activation enthalpy @xmath46 is somewhat larger than @xmath45 .",
    "this apparent discrepancy probably arises because the number of stem - stem base pairs is not a perfect reaction coordinate , _",

    "consistent with this argument , the success probability after forming one base pair is very small at @xmath47 ( figure [ fig : closingtime](c ) ) .",
    "hairpin loop closure of course involves a large loss of conformational entropy , but there is also an enthalpic cost to bringing the two ends of the chain together , because states with small @xmath49 are on average less stacked than those typical of the open state . from figure",
    "[ fig : fhs](d ) we can see that this enthalpy cost is greater at low temperatures , when the bases are more strongly stacked and the loop is less flexible .",
    "consistent with our results , a positive activation enthalpy , which increases with decreasing temperature , has been reported experimentally for the end - to - end collisions of poly(da ) strands @xcite .",
    "breaking of stacking interactions to bring the two ends of the strand together is therefore the origin of the positive apparent activation enthalpy at low temperatures .",
    "note that in this way the ssdna in the loop region behaves differently from a freely - jointed chain , a commonly used model for ssdna , for which the cost of bringing the chain ends together would be purely entropic .",
    "non - native base pairs have the potential both to enhance and to hinder the formation of a target hairpin .",
    "they can provide alternative pathways where misbonded base pairs form first , followed by an internal rearrangement to form the correct structure . whether such pathways enhance the rate of hairpin formation depends on the ease with which misbonded structures can be resolved . for short duplexes",
    ", it has been previously shown that misbonding enhances the rate of hybridization because the time scale for internal displacement reactions that allow the correct duplex to be achieved after misbonding are much faster than the diffusion time associated with base - pair forming encounters at typical ( low ) strand concentrations@xcite . however , whether a similar time scale separation holds for hairpin formation is less obvious because of the unimolecular nature of the process , and is likely to depend on the structure of the the hairpin ( _ e.g. _ loop length ) , sequence , and parameters such as temperature that affect the ease with which free - energy barriers can be overcome .     hairpin at @xmath27   as a function of the number of misbonds and the number of correct hairpin bonds .",

    "the profile shows two minima corresponding to the fully open and closed states .",
    "in addition , we observe that various misbonded configurations are possible .",
    "in particular , there is a local minimum involving two non - native wc base pairs ( and no native base pairs ) .",
    "moreover , the apparent free - energy barrier separating such a configuration from the fully - formed hairpin is actually smaller than the barrier of the direct path from the fully open state to the fully - formed hairpin .",
    "it is thus plausible that folding of the hairpin can occur through an alternative pathway initially involving non - native base pairs .    in kinetic measurements of the hairpin @xmath17 , which has a short stem and a relatively long loop , we have considered the effects of completely switching off wc misbonding and only switching off wc misbonding between bases in the stem and in the loop .",
    "figure  [ fig : misbond](b ) shows that the closing time becomes longer , particularly at low temperatures , when misbonding is not allowed for the @xmath17 hairpin .",
    "however , stem - loop misbonds turn out to be less relevant in determining the closing time for this hairpin .",
    "it is interesting to note that for the hairpin @xmath17 , misbonding in the stem significantly reduces @xmath30 ( from @xmath54 to @xmath55 at @xmath27 ) , but it only reduces @xmath31 slightly ( from @xmath56 to @xmath57 at @xmath27 ) as the transient entrapment of the hairpin in misbonded states only makes the zippering stage of the hairpin formation slightly less likely . note that the effect of misbonding that we observe here works against the the non - monotonic behaviour of @xmath26 , rather than causing it . for",

    "@xcite who found that replacement of an adenine base with a cytosine base in the middle of the loop of a similar hairpin was most effective at reducing the low - temperature closing time . for sequence iii , where the weaker points are closer to the middle of the loop",
    ", the closing process is enhanced the most . for this hairpin , the three modified bases effectively reduce @xmath26 to a value comparable to the closing time of the hairpin with no base - stacking in the loop , except for the lowest temperature that we consider .",
    "these results are consistent with the intuitive expectation that the stem - forming ends of the strands are more likely to come close together if the strand can bend back on itself more easily at the middle of the hairpin loop .",
    "we have measured thermodynamic and kinetic properties of dna hairpin formation with oxdna , a coarse - grained model of dna at the nucleotide level .",
    "the hairpins we consider , some of which have been studied experimentally , have a relatively long ( @xmath66 bases ) loop and a rather short ( @xmath78 bases ) stem .",
    "our results indicate that the formation of such hairpins at high salt concentrations is well - approximated by a two - state reaction with a rate - determining step that involves the formation of a loop with a nucleus of one or two stem - stem base pairs .",
    "the formation of the hairpin is then achieved by a rapid zippering of the stem .",
    "in addition , the closing time shows a non - arrhenius temperature dependence with a minimum close to the melting temperature , consistent with some previous experiments@xcite .    at high temperatures ,",
    "the temperature dependence of the closing time shows a negative apparent activation enthalpy ( _ i.e. _ increases with temperature ) , implying that the set of transition states have on average a lower enthalpy ( due to base pairing ) with respect to the open state . in this regime ,",
    "the free - energy barrier to hairpin formation is mainly due to a significant loss of conformational entropy associated with the formation of the initial stem - stem contact .",
    "moreover , similar to what has been recently observed for duplex hybridization@xcite with oxdna , we found that at high temperatures a loop that is stabilized by just one base pair is unlikely to succeed in forming a complete hairpin .",
    "instead , a larger number of stem - stem base pairs is required to make zippering most likely at high temperatures .",
    "hence , the apparent activation enthalpy for the hairpin formation becomes more negative as the temperature increases , in agreement with several experiments@xcite but in contrast with ref .  .",
    "the behavior changes at temperatures below the melting point . at these temperatures",
    "the closing time shows a positive apparent activation enthalpy ( _ i.e. _ increases with decreasing temperature ) , consistent with several studies@xcite . as the temperature",
    "is decreased , the bases in the loop stack more strongly together . to form an initial stem - stem contact at low temperatures",
    "requires the bending rigidity of the ssdna loop to be overcome and involves a loss of stacking interactions , thus increasing the enthalpy of the transition states . at some point",
    "the enthalpic cost of forming a loop becomes larger than the negative enthalpy gain due to base pairing at the transition state , and as a result the apparent activation enthalpy becomes positive .",
    "the positive activation enthalpy has previously been attributed to the roughness of the free - energy surface , due to the misbonded ( wc and non - wc misbonds including misstacked bases ) configurations in the early stages of the formation of the loop@xcite .",
    "for oxdna at least , we have shown here that this phenomenon is mainly due to strong base stacking in the loop and that the wc misbonding when present acts to suppresses the non - monotonic behaviour observed for the hairpin closing time .",
    "in addition , we have shown that by decreasing the stacking strength of the bases in the loop , or by introducing a few more weakly stacking bases in the loop , the hairpin closing time decreases significantly at low temperatures , in agreement with experimental observations@xcite .",
    "the significance of introducing sites of enhanced flexibility for the hairpin dynamics provides further evidence for the key role of loop rigidity in determining the hairpin closing time at low temperatures .",
    "for example , although such a hairpin loop is more flexible than our standard case , the overall roughness of the free - energy landscape is likely to be almost the same for the two hairpins .",
    "it should be noted that in our study we used an implicit solvent model .",
    "therefore , the temperature dependency of the rate constants due to the change of the solvent viscosity is not captured . as the viscosity of the solvent decreases with increasing temperature",
    ", its effect would be to move the minimum in the closing time to slightly higher temperature .",
    "furthermore , hydrodynamic effects are neglected in our simulations . however , as all the strands that are considered here are the same length ( 40-bases ) , they are likely to experience similar hydrodynamic effects .",
    "such effects are likely to be more relevant when studying the kinetics of hairpins with different sizes .",
    "overall , our results suggest that strong stacking within the loop of a hairpin can produce hairpin folding kinetics consistent with experimental studies that have reported non - monotonic dependencies on temperature .",
    "we note that if neighbouring bases stack in a largely uncooperative fashion , the overall stacking strength must be very large ( corresponding to high stacking probabilities @xmath73 ) to produce a strong signal .",
    "such strong stacking is found in oxdna for polya at low temperatures . whilst we do not find similar effects arising from non - native wc base pairs",
    "( since those misbonded configurations are not more stable than the open state , and they can easily transition to the folded state ) , there could possibly be other contributions to the observed behaviour .",
    "in particular , there may be non - wc interactions that are neglected in oxdna but are sufficiently stable at low temperature to inhibit folding .",
    "alternatively , single - stranded stem sections might form structures at low temperatures that are incompatible with nucleating the correct stem and that must be disrupted prior to hairpin formation @xcite . finally , changing interactions with the solvent or increased viscosity of water at lower temperatures may play a role .",
    "we note , however , that these alternative explanations are unlikely to be strongly sensitive to substitutions of a few bases within the loop , as is observed in oxdna when strong stacking is responsible .",
    "the fact that such changes are known to influence folding dynamics at low temperature , therefore supports the stacking - based explanation rather than the suggestion of ansari and coworkers @xcite that an increased roughness of the free - energy surface arising from interachain misbonding controls the hairpin formation dynamics .",
