    "binary and multiple systems are ubiquitous products of star formation @xcite .",
    "the gas condensing into stars contains excessive angular momentum that is transported outwards during collapse and accretion and stored partially in the orbital momentum of binaries .",
    "while the basic physics is known , no current theory is able to predict the multiplicity fraction and the distributions of separations , mass ratios , or eccentricities , although large - scale numerical simulations show promising agreement with observations @xcite .",
    "formation of binary stars is related to the stellar mass function and sets the scene for subsequent evolution ( mass transfer , blue stragglers , x - ray binaries , and type i supernovae ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the gas left around newly born stars as a material for planet formation is inherited from the epoch of mass accretion and is related to multiplicity .",
    "the common origin of stars , planets , and binaries should therefore be studied jointly .",
    "solid observational data on binary statistics are difficult to get because of various selection effects , and this is exacerbated for stellar hierarchies containing three or more stars . yet , hierarchical multiple systems give additional insights into star formation from their period ratios , relative orbit orientation , and structure .",
    "this work complements the study of hierarchical multiplicity of solar - type stars in the 67-pc volume ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter fg67a and fg67b ) .",
    "the large size of the fg-67 sample defined in fg67a ( 4867 stars ) and modest and well - controlled observational selection allowed reliable estimates of the fraction of hierarchical systems , 13% , and of their statistics .",
    "one unexpected result was the large fraction of subsystems in the secondary components of wide binaries and the emerging correlation between subsystems , so that 4% of targets turned out to be 2 + 2 quadruples ( two close binaries on a wide orbit around each other ) .",
    "however , this result relied on extrapolation from the small number of well - studied secondary components .",
    "while the main targets of the fg-67 sample were the subject of spectroscopic and imaging observational campaigns , the secondaries were generally neglected .",
    "recent imaging studies of secondary components @xcite have largely remedied the situation , but _",
    "close _ secondary subsystems accessible only to spectroscopy still remain to be discovered . exploring these close subsystems is the main motivation of the present work .",
    "i report here rv monitoring of solar - type stars in the fg-67 sample that are either known to be spectroscopic binaries but lack the orbit or belong to wide visual binaries .",
    "most targets have southern declinations .",
    "the main goal is characterization of subsystems in the secondary components and determination of their periods , complementing previous efforts in this respect .",
    "extensive previous rv data were furnished by the geneva - copenhagen survey , gcs @xcite , which covered mostly the main targets . as a continuation of this campaign , @xcite monitored the rvs of wide pairs , discovering several subsystems .",
    "@xcite reported rv monitoring of both wide and close ( unresolved on the slit ) visual binaries , mostly on the northern sky .",
    "a similar , but much smaller survey of southern multiples is published by @xcite .",
    "@xcite measured precise rvs of wide binaries in search of stellar or planetary subsystems .",
    "these survey - type works are complemented by studies of individual objects published by various authors ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "although this paper is devoted to wide binaries , rvs of all observed stars are given .",
    "presentation of newly determined orbits is deferred to a future paper , as their lengthy discussion would distract from the main topic , while binaries needing more data are still being observed .",
    "the instruments , data reduction , and raw results are covered in section  [ sec : obs ] . then in section  [ sec : simul ] i evaluate through simulation the proposed method of detecting subsystems from a single observation .",
    "section  [ sec : widebin ] reports on subsystems in a volume - limited sample of wide binaries . in section",
    "[ sec : ecc ] the rv difference in wide binaries without subsystems is analyzed to constrain their eccentricities .",
    "the work is summarized in section  [ sec : sum ] .",
    "the observations reported in this paper were obtained with the 1.5-m telescope located at the cerro tololo interamerican observatory in chile and operated by the smarts consortium . the observing time was allocated through noao ( programs 10b-0022 , 14b-0009 , and 15a-0055 ) .",
    "the observations were made by the telescope operators in service mode .",
    "the goal of the 2010 campaign was to determine unknown spectroscopic orbits of close solar - type binaries and to observe components of wide binaries that lacked rv coverage .",
    "at least three observations of each target were planned in the 20 allocated nights . however ,",
    "less time was actually scheduled , so most targets were observed just once , and only a few were pointed several times .",
    "this data set is therefore too small for addressing the goals of the original proposal .",
    "nevertheless , one orbit was determined and several subsystems were discovered .    in 2010 ,",
    "the spectra were taken with the fiber echelle ( fech ) instrument .",
    "it was the de - commissioned echelle spectrometer from the blanco 4-m telescope moved to the coud room of the 1.5-m telescope and fed by the fiber . in this program",
    "the image of the fiber projected into the spectrograph was not masked by the slit and its width defined the spectral resolution of @xmath1 .",
    "the detector was a sit ccd of 2014@xmath22048 pixels format with the arcon controller .",
    "the calibration spectrum of the thorium - argon lamp fed through the same fiber was taken before or after each target .    in 2014 and 2015 ,",
    "observations were made with the chiron spectrograph @xcite that replaced fech in 2011 .",
    "stars brighter than @xmath3 mag were observed in the slicer mode with a spectral resolution of @xmath4 , while for fainter targets the fiber mode with @xmath5 was used . when both components of a wide binary were observed , the same mode was chosen .",
    "the thorium - argon calibrations were recorded for each target .",
    "the observing campaigns of 2014 and 2015 targeted secondary components of wide binaries in a `` snapshot survey '' designed to detect subsystems from just one observation by rv difference between the components .",
    "i selected binaries from the fg-67 sample south of @xmath6 declination with separations no less than 8  to ensure that the components are well resolved on the entrance fiber aperture .",
    "only the secondaries with @xmath7 magnitudes between 8 and 11 were chosen to shorten the exposure time , maximizing the sample coverage .",
    "secondaries with prior rv coverage were removed from the program ; however , they are included in the statistical analysis in section  [ sec : widebin ] .",
    "primary components were observed as well if they lacked prior rv data comparable in quality to the gcs ( two or three observations with a time base of at least a year ) .",
    "also , monitoring of several known solar - type spectroscopic binaries was continued for computing their orbits .",
    "the reduced and wavelength - calibrated spectra delivered by the chiron pipeline were retrieved from the smarts center at the yale university .",
    "the availability of this service has greatly enhanced this program by allowing rapid analysis of the rvs and flexible scheduling of new observations when needed .",
    "the fech data were reduced by the author using a simplified and adapted version of the chiron pipeline software @xcite .",
    "i extracted echelle orders 84 to 123 covering the wavelength range from 4500  to 6850 . at shorter wavelengths , there is little signal in the spectra of red stars and quartz lamp , while longer wavelengths are affected by telluric absorptions and are not used in the cross - correlation .",
    "a set of 10 quartz spectra was co - added and used to extract the stellar and arc spectra in a boxcar window of @xmath88 pixels .",
    "the position of the spectra on the ccd , defined by the fiber , was stable to within 0.5 pixels .",
    "cosmic rays were removed during the order extraction , but the current algorithm did not detect all these events and some spectra do contain a few residual spikes .    while the extracted chiron spectra are corrected for small - scale variations of the detector sensitivity using the quartz lamp calibration ,",
    "this correction was not applied to the fech data because the quartz `` flats '' for fech deviate from unity by only a few percent , less than the typical noise .",
    "the fech wavelength calibration typically used 1400 thorium - argon lines with a scatter of 0.1 pixels or 0.36 km  s@xmath9 between the measured line positions and their 6-th order polynomial approximation .",
    "each science spectrum was paired with the wavelength calibration closest in time ( typically within 3 minutes ) .",
    "the spectra were cross - correlated with the digital binary mask based on the solar spectrum stored in the noao archive ( see * ? ? ? * for more details ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : example ] shows data on a faint target .",
    "the extracted fech spectrum has @xmath10250 counts ( the gain is 1.4 el / adu ) .",
    "however , the cross - correlation function ( ccf ) is very smooth .",
    "its gaussian fit leads to @xmath11 km  s@xmath9 .",
    "the amplitude of the gaussian is @xmath12 and its dispersion is @xmath13 km  s@xmath9 .",
    "the rms residual to the fit is 0.7% .",
    "the rvs are derived without applying any zero - point correction from rv standards , they are tied directly to the solar spectrum .",
    "the ccf @xmath14 is computed over the rv range of @xmath15 km  s@xmath9 .",
    "a gaussian is fitted to the portion of the ccf within @xmath16 of the minimum .",
    "when two or three gaussians are fitted , the data around all the minima are used jointly .",
    "after the first iteration , the centers and dispersions are determined , and in the second iteration the fitting area is adjusted accordingly .",
    "the ccf model with @xmath17 gaussians is @xmath18   \\label{eq : fit}\\ ] ] and contains @xmath19 free parameters @xmath20 .",
    "it is possible to fix some parameters , but this option , handy for de - blending overlapping ccfs , was not used in the data reported below .",
    "formal errors of the fitted parameters do not reflect their real precision , being dominated by systematic , rather than random , deviations of the ccf from its model .",
    "i do not provide these errors in the data table .",
    "the real rv precision estimated from residuals to orbital fits is about 0.1 km  s@xmath9 for both chiron and fech .",
    "for example , 4 observations of hip  105585c taken with chiron over a time span of 333days have rms scatter of 40 m  s@xmath9 .",
    "the bright star hip  5896 with a very wide ccf ( @xmath21 km  s@xmath9 ) observed 11 times with fech shows the rms rv scatter of 0.28 km  s@xmath9 .    for 21 apparently single stars",
    "the rvs were measured both here and in the gcs .",
    "the average difference chiron@xmath22gcs is 0.47 or 0.36 km  s@xmath9 ( with or without rejecting one outlier , respectively ) .",
    "the rms scatter of the difference is 0.58  km  s@xmath9 .",
    "this minor systematics is ignored in the following , being most likely attributable to the coravel instruments used by the gcs .",
    "more accurate rvs @xcite match the chiron data better .",

    "this is the case of hip 105947 , 109951 , and 117666 .    the alternative idea of detecting subsystems in wide binaries from the rv difference between the components ( as in hip 12780 ,",
    "14519 , 76435 ) is explored here by means of simulation .",
    "we need to decide whether the wide binary contains a subsystem ( hypothesis h1 ) or is just a binary ( hypothesis h0 ) , based on a single measurement of the rv difference between its components @xmath41 .",

    "the eccentricity of case 2 is multiplied by 0.7 to get the average @xmath60 typical of spectroscopic binaries .",
    "figure  [ fig : simul ] shows the results . in the case ( 1 ) , the strict inequality @xmath61 holds .",

    "their probability is small , increasing with the increasing fraction of eccentric orbits . on the other hand ,",
    "the median of the rv distribution depends on the eccentricity much less .",

    "the amplitude is 0.1 of the earth speed or 3 km  s@xmath9 . considering that the errors of rvs measured with chiron are on the order of 0.1 km  s@xmath9 , it is clear that the rv difference is dominated by the motion in wide binaries , while the measurement errors are negligible in comparison .    in the case of wide binaries",

    "the hypothesis h0 is rejected if @xmath80 , or @xmath81 .",
    "adopting @xmath82 , the detection limit for subsystems translates to @xmath83 , where @xmath84 for circular outer orbits , @xmath85 for the sine eccentricity distribution , and @xmath86 for the uniform distribution of eccentricity in the outer orbits .",
    "now the tools are in place to estimate the probability of detecting a subsystem in a wide binary from a single measurement of @xmath87 . for each combination of the mass ratio @xmath88 and period @xmath89 in the subsystem , the amplitude @xmath47 is computed by ( [ eq : k1 ] ) .",

    "note the `` fuzzy '' character of this detection technique : the chance to miss a subsystem is substantial for all parameters .",
    "this is the penalty for using just a single rv measurement .",
    "the detection curves are described by @xmath94 where @xmath95 is determined by inverting ( [ eq : fx ] ) , namely 0.15 , 0.39 , 0.63 , 0.95 , and 1.60 for probabilities of 0.1 , 0.3 , 0.5 , 0.7 , and 0.9 respectively .",
    "subsystems with @xmath96 can be detected by double lines independently of the outer period .",
    "several detections in this work belong to this category .",
    "however , doubling of the ccf is observable when the rv difference in the inner subsystem exceeds a few km  s@xmath9 , in which case the single - measurement strategy also works . for simplicity ,",
    "i do not account for this additional detection channel in the statistical analysis of the next section .",
    "the list of wide binaries in the fg-67 sample was created using the following criteria : separation larger than @xmath97 , @xmath7 magnitudes of the secondary from 8 to 11 , declination south of @xmath6 .",

    "i do not include the potential subsystem in hip  14519 discovered by the @xmath39 method .",
    "the apparently non - hierarchical system hip  22611 is removed from the following analysis , leaving 96 wide pairs .",
    "subsystems are found in 43 pairs , 25 of which have subsystems in the primary component , 28 in the secondary , and 10 in both ( @xmath99 ) .",
    "obviously , the frequency of subsystems in the primary and secondary components is statistically the same .",
    "this sample gives a weak evidence of the correlated occurrence of subsystems in both components , noted previously in @xcite and fg67b .",

    "figure  [ fig : sec ] compares periods and mass ratios of subsystems in the secondary components with their detection probability .",
    "the probability is calculated by the prescription of fg67a . the additional factor resulting from @xmath101 measurements",
    "is incorporated for the 53 binaries without subsystems .",
    "the four subsystens with unknown periods and mass ratios are depicted by crosses located arbitrarily .",
    "the addition of spectroscopic coverage has dramatically improved the detection at @xmath102 days in comparison with imaging - only surveys such as @xcite .",
    "such plot for the primary subsystems is similar , with slightly deeper detection contours .",
    "it is instructive to compare the frequency and periods of subsystems with the statistical model developed in fg67b .",
    "the basic assumption is that subsystems are chosen randomly from the log - normal distribution of periods , keeping only dynamically stable multiples .",
    "i adopted the following parameters of the underlying period distribution : @xmath103 , @xmath104 , the mass - ratio exponent @xmath105 , and the total binary frequency @xmath106 ( see fg67b for description of those parameters ) .",
    "two - dimensional distribution in the @xmath107 space was multiplied by the detection probability and the dynamical truncation , providing the expected period distribution in the subsystems and their total number .",
    "it is compared to the actual cumulative distribution of secondary periods in figure  [ fig : cum ] .",
    "the four yet unknown periods were given arbitrary values close to 100days .",
    "the model predicts 26.6 sevcondary subsystems for @xmath105 and 23.1 for @xmath108 , while the actual number is 28 .",
    "this calculation was repeated for the primary subsystems , giving their predicted numbers of 32.4 and 29.1 for @xmath105 and @xmath108 , respectively ; the actual number is 25 .",
    "the numbers match within statistical errors , as do the period distributions ( with the caveat related to unknown periods ) .",
    "therefore , the data collected here support the statistical description of multiplicity proposed in fg67b .",
    "in this section , i study the distribution of the observed rv difference in 53 wide binaries without known subsystems .",
    "the cumulative distribution of the normalized quantity @xmath109 is plotted in figure  [ fig : dv ] and compared to the simulated distributions presented in figure  [ fig : sim5 ] . a good agreement with the case-3 simulation ( uniformly distributed eccentricity ) and a poor match with the `` thermal '' eccentricity distribution are obvious .",
    "the observed distribution is widened by the rv errors ( both random and systematic ) and by yet undetected subsystems .",
    "so , the real distribution should be even narrower than the observed one .",
    "this means that the eccentricities of wide binaries are likely even smaller than in the case 3 .",
    "@xcite suggested that very wide binaries can form through ejection of one star from compact triple systems .",
    "outer orbits of such ejected stars mostly have large eccentricities with typical values of @xmath100.7 ( see their figure  2 ) .",
    "the wide binaries studied here have separations on the order of @xmath71au , as in the above paper .",
    "however , eccentricities of those binaries without subsystems appear to be moderate , as follows from the rv differences between their components . moreover , the frequency of subsystems in the primary and secondary components is similar , which speaks against the ejection scenario .",
    "interestingly , @xcite found that eccentricities of binaries in the 25-pc volume are distributed approximately uniformly independently of their period .",
    "however , they based this conclusion on known spectroscopic and visual orbits which do not include binaries as wide as studied here .",
    "results of the rv survey of nearby stars are reported .",
    "i focused on wide visual binaries and aimed at detecting subsystems in their components by a presence of double lines or by a substantial rv difference between the components .",
    "this latter `` snapshot '' technique is studied by simulation , showing that the major factor limiting the subsystem detection is the orbital motion in the wide binary itself .",
    "the survey readily detects subsystems with short periods .",
    "non - detections are interpreted statistically , constraining the parameters of subsystems and their overall frequency .    as",
    "most of the primary components of wide binaries in this sample already have rv coverage in the literature , i observed fainter and less - well studied secondaries .",
    "five new subsystems in wide binaries were discovered in this project .",
    "the frequency of subsystems in the primary and secondary components turns out to be statistically the same .",
    "the data match the crude model proposed in fg67b , where subsystems are chosen randomly from the general period distribution and are constrained only by dynamical stability .",
    "an interesting additional result concerns wide binaries without subsystems .",
    "the distribution of the observed rv difference between their components places some constraints on the distribution of the orbital eccentricities , which are not measured directly owing to very long periods .",
    "the results of this work rule out the `` thermal '' distribution @xmath110 and match instead the uniform distribution .",
    "this suggests that dynamical interactions in @xmath111-body stellar systems were not dominant in shaping the orbits of wide binaries .",
    "i thank the operators of the 1.5-m telescope for executing observations of this program and the smarts team at yale for scheduling and pipeline processing .",
    "this work used the simbad service operated by centre des donnes stellaires ( strasbourg , france ) , bibliographic references from the astrophysics data system maintained by sao / nasa , and the washington double star catalog maintained at usno .",

    "<S> subsystems are efficiently detected even in a single observation by double lines and/or by the rv difference between the components of visual binaries . </S>",
    "<S> the potential of this detection technique is quantified by simulation and used for statistical assessment of 96 wide binaries within 67pc . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that 43 binaries contain at least one subsystem and the occurrence of subsystems is equally probable in either primary or secondary components . </S>",
    "<S> the frequency of subsystems and their periods match the simple prescription proposed by the author ( 2014 , aj , 147 , 87 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the remaining 53 simple wide binaries with a median projected separation of 1300au have the distribution of the rv difference between their components that is not compatible with the thermal eccentricity distribution @xmath0 but rather matches the uniform eccentricity distribution . </S>"
