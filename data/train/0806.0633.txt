    "diffusion is a fundamental transport mechanism which plays a dominant role in many physical , chemical and biological systems .",
    "it is not only of academic but also practical interest to study diffusion in two - dimensional systems since many real - world systems can be described as being two - dimensional or quasi - two - dimensional , including surfaces or layers of small width , e.g. quantum wells .",
    "two - dimensional diffusion has long been known to exhibit anomalous behaviour for a number of interactions and systems .",
    "one of the possible anomalies is the so - called superdiffusion which describes diffusion proceeding faster than normal diffusion in the sense that a particle achieves a greater distance from its starting point than expected from fick s law . for three - dimensional simple systems in thermodynamical equilibrium , to the best of our knowledge , no superdiffusion has been observed to date . on the other hand , under nonequilibrium conditions",
    ", anomalous transport is well - known , e.g. for chaotic systems @xcite , turbulent flows @xcite , or plasmas in turbulent magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "these will not be considered here . for systems which are neither three - dimensional nor strictly two - dimensional",
    ", we expect a gradual transition from superdiffusive behaviour to fickian diffusion .    in two - dimensional systems of hard disks , a slow @xmath0 decay of the long - time tail of the velocity autocorrelation function ( vacf )",
    "was first observed by alder and wainwright @xcite .",
    "such a decay results in a divergent green - kubo integral .",
    "superdiffusion was found to take place in quasi - two - dimensional complex plasmas @xcite , including driven - dissipative systems @xcite and systems under laser - induced shear @xcite .",
    "no experimental evidence for superdiffusion was found by nunomura et al . who examined an underdamped liquid complex plasma @xcite .",
    "the intent of this study is to examine the superdiffusion in systems which are quasi - two - dimensional , i.e. the extension in one spatial dimension of the system is much smaller than in the other two .",
    "this is often the situation in experimental setups , for example in dusty plasma experiments where the dust grains are levitated by an electrostatic force which is counteracted by gravity .",
    "it is clear that under such circumstances the particles are not rigorously restricted to a two - dimensional plane but form a quasi - two - dimensional system .",
    "for example , ref .",
    "@xcite reports on experiments in which the dusty plasma under consideration consisted of two to three layers .    here",
    "we consider a macroscopic system of charged particles interacting via a screened coulomb ( yukawa ) potential .",
    "it is of relevance to dusty plasmas @xcite , colloidal suspensions , electrolytes and other systems .",
    "it is also an important theoretical tool since it allows to tune the inter - particle interaction ( by varying the screening length of the yukawa potential ) from being very long - ranged to almost contact interaction .",
    "we report on molecular dynamics studies performed for quasi - two - dimensional systems .",
    "our focus lies on the influence of the degree of quasi - two - dimensionality on the vanishing and emergence of superdiffusion .",
    "we study the system using equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the interaction of the particles is given by the yukawa pair potential @xmath1 here , @xmath2 is the particles charge and @xmath3 is the screening length . +",
    "a two - dimensional yukawa system is characterized by two parameters , the coulomb coupling parameter @xmath4 and the screening parameter @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath6 is the temperature and @xmath7 is the wigner - seitz radius for two - dimensional systems .",
    "while our simulation box is periodic in the @xmath8 and @xmath9 directions , it is unbound in the @xmath10 direction .",
    "the particles perpendicular movement in @xmath10 direction is restricted by one of two confinement potentials @xmath11    the confinement ( [ eq : harmonic ] ) is a simple harmonic trap where @xmath12 denotes the trap amplitude @xcite .",
    "the second model , eq . ( [ eq : soft - box ] ) , uses a box - shaped confinement with `` soft '' walls .",
    "it can be thought of as consisting of two rigid walls of immovable particles with the same interaction as the actual particles , i.e. a yukawa interaction , see fig .",
    "[ fig : trap_illust ] for an illustration . here",
    ", @xmath13 is defined as @xmath14 with @xmath15 being the `` width '' of the box , i.e. twice the maximum displacement in @xmath16 or @xmath17 direction .",
    "we use the width @xmath15 as a third parameter for the soft - box confinement . + the choice between two confinements allows us to ( a ) reproduce typical experimental situations or ( b ) study the effect of the dimensionality on superdiffusion while retaining comparable plasma conditions at all times .",
    "we achieve this by the following procedure : in the harmonic confinement , as the amplitude of the trap is decreased , the particle number is left unchanged and the particles can explore a wider vertical space .",
    "this results in an increased mean inter - particle distance , i.e. the ( three - dimensional ) density is decreased .",
    "contrarily , in the soft - box confinement , we chose @xmath18 as a point to fix for the 3d density and scale the particle number as necessary to maintain that density for all values of @xmath15 .",
    "+ we performed simulations for a fixed coupling parameter @xmath19 .",
    "prior to measurement , the particles velocities are rescaled at each timestep to the desired temperature until a maxwell distribution is well - established . during the measurement",
    ", the velocities are not rescaled .",
    "our simulations are carried out for @xmath20 and @xmath21 . at these parameters ,",
    "a 2d yukawa system is well in the liquid phase , with the melting points being @xmath22 and @xmath23 for @xmath20 and @xmath24 respectively @xcite .",
    "+ the particle number in our simulations is @xmath25 for the harmonic confinement and @xmath26 for the soft - box confinement with @xmath27 for @xmath28 . + in the following ,",
    "time is given in units of the inverse plasma frequency @xmath29 with @xmath30 being the mass of the particles and lenghts are measured in units of @xmath31 .",
    "we solve the equation of motion for each particle using the velocity verlet algorithm @xcite .",
    "the structure of the systems is characterized by measuring the density distribution @xmath32 perpendicular to the confined direction and by the _ projected pair distribution function _ @xmath33 .",
    "+ to analyze diffusion properties we calculate the time - dependence of the mean - squared displacement ( msd ) @xmath34 where @xmath35 denotes an ensemble - average and @xmath36 is the position vector in the plane ; the @xmath10-component is bound from above due to the confining force and does not need to be taken into account .",
    "+ the motion can be classified according to the time - dependence @xmath37 .",
    "normal fickian diffusion is characterized by a linear time dependence , @xmath38 . if @xmath39 or @xmath40 , motion is super- or subdiffusive , respectively .",
    "ballistic , i.e. undisturbed , motion is trivially marked by @xmath41 .",
    "+ we have carried out calculations of the msd for different trap amplitudes and box widths and determined the slope of the curve on a double logarithmic plot between @xmath42 and @xmath43 which yields the diffusion exponent @xmath44",
    ".    a more direct insight into a particle s movement can be obtained from the decay of the velocity autocorrelation function ( vacf ) @xmath45 where @xmath46 .",
    "@xmath47 is a measure of the memory of the system . for uncorrelated binary collisions",
    ", @xmath47 is expected to decay exponentially .",
    "if @xmath47 decays algebraically , @xmath48 , @xmath49 needs to be larger than 1 for diffusion to be fickian , because otherwise no valid diffusion coefficient can be calculated from the green - kubo formula . for 3d",
    ", the decay has been found to be algebraic with @xmath50 for a number of pair potentials in experiments @xcite , simulations @xcite and by theoretical models @xcite .    for 2d yukawa systems exhibiting superdiffusion , liu and goree",
    "have found an algebraic decay with @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "this is an indication of superdiffusive behaviour .    in our simulations , we calculated the velocity autocorrelation for different trap amplitudes . to obtain accurate statistics , we performed between 10 and 50 runs of 700.000 timesteps for each trap amplitude and again determined the slope of the curve in a double logarithmic plot , this time between @xmath42 and @xmath52 .",
    "special attention must be paid to the error estimation .",
    "we used the jackknife method to evaluate our data , because standard error estimates may not be sufficient in this case @xcite .",
    "we begin by noting that particles interacting via a yukawa potential and confined by a harmonic trap support the formation of layers @xcite .",
    "the number of layers formed depends on the temperature , the trap frequency and the screening length . for our choice of parameters",
    ", we found that for @xmath53 a second layer builds up at @xmath54 while for @xmath55 the system consists of a single layer for the whole range of @xmath12 examined ( cf . the insets above figs .",
    "[ fig : k2msd ] and [ fig : k3msd ] ) .",
    "typical results for the time - dependence of @xmath56 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : msd ] . in this double - logarithmic plot",
    ", the slope of the curves corresponds to the exponent of the algebraic behaviour . for @xmath57",
    ", @xmath56 grows quadratically with time , which corresponds to a ballistic motion of each individual particle . after a narrow transition region of about @xmath58 ,",
    "the particles movement is dominated by diffusive processes .",
    "the slope in this region allows us to classify motion as superdiffusive , diffusive or subdiffusive , i.e. it is the diffusion exponent @xmath44 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : msd ] , @xmath56 is depicted for different trap amplitudes @xmath12 . for strong confinements",
    ", @xmath56 deviates strongly from a purely diffusive behaviour of @xmath38 . for increasingly more relaxed confinements , the slope of @xmath56 tends more and more towards unity , that is the migration becomes less superdiffusive .",
    "the dependence of the diffusion exponent @xmath44 on the trap amplitude @xmath12 is shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : k2msd ] and [ fig : k3msd ] .",
    "it is clear that the degree of superdiffusivity , as measured by the diffusion exponent @xmath44 , decreases with an increasing width of the system . for @xmath20 , fig .",
    "[ fig : k2msd ] , the diffusion exponent is in the vicinity of @xmath59 for strong confinements which coincides with the value we obtained for strictly 2d systems . when the width of the particle distribution along the z - axis exceeds @xmath60 ( which is near the mean interparticle separation in the strictly 2d case ) , the diffusion exponent begins to deviate from that value and continues to fall for lower trap amplitudes @xmath12 .",
    "the same behaviour can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : k3msd ] for @xmath21 . here",
    ", @xmath44 saturates at @xmath61 for strongly confined systems and again falls when the system width exceeds @xmath60 . as noted before , the 3d density of the system differs for different trap amplitudes . to exclude the possibility that the vanishing of superdiffusion is only an effect of the density",
    ", we also simulated strictly 2d systems in which we changed the particle density until the first peak in the pair distribution function coincided with that of our quasi-2d systems .",
    "our data ( not shown ) clearly indicates that a decreased density does not lower the diffusion exponent in our parameter range .",
    "in fact , for @xmath53 the superdiffusion is stronger for systems of lower density .    to support the idea that the vanishing of superdiffusion is connected with the fact that particles can pass each other in z - direction , we analyze the projected pair distribution function @xmath33 .",
    "its value at @xmath62 is also shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : k2msd ] and [ fig : k3msd ] . for nearly 2d systems ( high @xmath12 ) , @xmath63 is practically zero .",
    "the reason for this is that for strongly correlated liquids , the particles kinetic energy is not sufficient for two particles to come together as close as one wigner - seitz radius .",
    "instead , they are trapped in local potential minima from which they can escape only after some time",
    "[ fig : k2msd ] and [ fig : k3msd ] show that @xmath63 is non - zero for lower trap amplitudes @xmath64 .",
    "this is a result of the projection of all particles onto a two - dimensional plane .",
    "individual particles are still separated by more than @xmath31 except now the finite width of the system allows the particles to go `` over and under '' each other in @xmath10-direction and the particles projections can be close .    by inspection of figs .",
    "[ fig : k2msd ] and [ fig : k3msd ] , we see that the behaviour of the dynamic quantity @xmath65 is closely mirrored by the static quantity @xmath66 .",
    "this underlines that superdiffusion is connected with the dimensionality of the system .",
    "[ fig : vacf_illust ] depicts the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath47 for different trap amplitudes @xmath12 in a double logarithmic plot .",
    "the results for the decay of the vacf are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : q2dvacf ] and [ fig : k3vacf ] for @xmath53 and @xmath55 .",
    "the data shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : vacf_illust ] validate our approach of modelling the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath47 as an algebraic decay since @xmath47 closely follows a straight line in the log - log plot .",
    "the peak seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : vacf_illust ] at long times for high @xmath12 is due to our finite simulation box and is caused by sound waves travelling through and re - entering the system due to the periodic boundary conditions .",
    "measurement is limited to times smaller than the time of the sound wave traversal .",
    "the dependence of @xmath49 on the trap amplitude @xmath12 , fig .",
    "[ fig : q2dvacf ] and [ fig : k3vacf ] , indicates vanishing of superdiffusion for broader systems .",
    "starting close to the value @xmath67 for narrow systems , we see an increase in @xmath49 for broader systems .",
    "this corresponds to a faster decay which is indicative of a loss of the particles memory , i.e. at subsequent times , a particle is less likely to travel in its original direction .",
    "we now turn our attention to the case of the soft - box confinement . again , let us note that here too , the system forms layers when given enough space in the confined direction . we find that the number of layers formed is higher than in the harmonic confinement which we attribute to the constancy of the particle density . recall that in this case we change the number of particles to maintain a constant 3d density .",
    "the dependence of the diffusion on the width of the system , figs . [",
    "fig : k3boxmsd ] and [ fig : k2boxmsd ] , is more involved than for the harmonic confinement .",
    "again , the general trend is for superdiffusion to vanish for increasingly broader systems . but",
    "here , the vanishing happens in stages : after a first drop , the diffusion exponent reaches a plateau from which it drops to a second plateau .",
    "this behaviour is connected to the formation of layers in the system as indicated by the different background colors in figs .",
    "[ fig : k3boxmsd ] and [ fig : k2boxmsd ] ( cf .",
    "top graphs in these figs ) . as another layer is formed in the system , the diffusion exponent experiences a drop .",
    "the non - monotonicity of the curve in figs .",
    "[ fig : k3boxmsd ] and [ fig : k2boxmsd ] is due to statistical error .",
    "we see that two to three layers are already sufficient to reduce the superdiffusive behaviour substantially .",
    "in addition , we again notice that the value of the projected pair distribution function @xmath63 is directly correlated with the diffusion exponent .",
    "a study of superdiffusion in quasi - two - dimensional yukawa liquids was performed by equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations .",
    "the two indicators for superdiffusion employed , the msd and the vacf , both show sensivity to the dimensionality of the system . for increasingly broader systems superdiffusion gradually vanishes . the transition from superdiffusion to normal diffusion",
    "was tested for two representative values of @xmath68 and found to be qualitatively comparable .",
    "this leads us to the conclusion that the transition is universal for yukawa systems in the fluid phase .    to ensure that the choice of confinement does not interfere with the change in dimensionality ,",
    "we have used two different schemes to confine the system .",
    "the general trend of the vanishing of superdiffusion appears to be independent of the type of confinement .",
    "the finer details of how the vanishing happens depend on the choice of confinement and here especially on the formation of layers .",
    "the strength of superdiffusion at zero width and the number of layers in the systems depend on the inter - particle potential and the system parameters . at a fixed coulomb coupling parameter @xmath19 , superdiffusion is stronger for @xmath21 and weaker for @xmath69 .",
    "we display in fig .",
    "[ fig : diff_vs_gofr ] the dependence of the diffusion exponent @xmath44 on the value of the projected pair distribution @xmath63 for @xmath53 and @xmath55 in the harmonic confinement , which is close to linear . for the soft - box confinement",
    "the general behaviour is similiar , although details are more complex due to the occurence of plateaus in the curves , cf .",
    "[ fig : k3boxmsd ] .",
    "it remains an interesting question what types of other pair potentials also support superdiffusion and how its strength depends on the interaction range .",
    "finally , it will also be of high interest for future analysis to see how quantum effects influence superdiffusion .",
    "this could be done , e.g. , by use of effective quantum pair potentials @xcite .",
