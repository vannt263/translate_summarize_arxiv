    "w and pt are chosen because of their high melting points that allow the growth of carbon nanotubes .",
    "an island of catalyst is patterned on the drain ( or source ) electrode using electron - beam lithography .",
    "nanotubes are grown by chemical vapour deposition from these islands . in about @xmath9 out of @xmath88 cases",
    ", a nanotube grows across the trench and establishes electrical contact between s and d. this growth is the last step of the fabrication process so that nanotubes are not contaminated with residues from resists and chemicals  @xcite .",
    "the device we present in the main text has a length of @xmath89@xmath90 m .",
    "the separation between the nanotube and the gate electrode is @xmath52 nm . the rather large roughness of the s and d electrodes in this device does not allow us to measure the nanotube radius with atomic force microscopy .",
    "our measurements are carried out at pressures typically below @xmath91 mbar and temperatures between @xmath4 and @xmath5k . in order to clean the nanotube surface",
    ", we perform a current annealing step every day ( @xmath92@xmath90a for @xmath93s ) .",
    "we observe only very minor variations of the electrical conductance and mechanical resonance frequencies of the nanotube from day to day .",

    "we discuss first the frequency mixing ( fm ) technique  @xcite . a driving voltage @xmath50 is applied to the source electrode .",
    "modulating the frequency ( with a modulation rate of @xmath94hz and a frequency deviation of @xmath95khz ) results in a mixing current ( @xmath54 ) at @xmath94hz .",

    "the modulus of @xmath54 measured with the two - source technique has the form    @xmath98    where @xmath99 is the conductance of the nanotube , @xmath100 is the phase difference between the voltages applied to source and gate , @xmath23 is time , @xmath101 is the mechanical amplitude , @xmath102 is the capacitance between the nanotube and the gate , @xmath103 is its derivation with respect to the nanotube displacement , and @xmath104 is the phase difference between the nanotube displacement and the driving force .",
    "the measurements in the paper of @xmath54 as a function of the drive frequency @xmath55 give a resonance lineshape that is to a rather good approximation proportional to the response of the motional amplitude as a function of @xmath55 , since the purely electrical component of @xmath54 ( first term in eq .",

    "we verify that the harmonics of the rf sources ( signals at @xmath0 , @xmath1 , or @xmath18 times the drive frequency ) can be neglected .",

    "the details of the simulation are discussed in section vii . @xmath116 and",
    "@xmath117 correspond to modes moving essentially in the plane orthogonal to the gate electrode .",
    "since the two - source method measures the oscillation of the nanotube - gate capacitance , the signal of modes @xmath116 and @xmath117 are expected to be large , in agreement with the experiments . @xmath48 and @xmath49 are modes moving essentially parallel to the gate electrode . as such",
    ", the corresponding signals are expected to be small , which also agrees with the measurement .",
    "ansys simulations indicate that modes @xmath48 , @xmath116 , @xmath49 , and @xmath117 have either @xmath72 or @xmath0 nodes .",
    "the mode with @xmath9 node moving perpendicular to the gate electrode is predicted to appear between @xmath116 and @xmath49 [ dashed line in fig .",
    "[ sm13](c ) ] .",
    "this mode is not detected because the oscillation of the capacitance is ( nearly ) zero due to the symmetry of the mode shape .",
    "ansys predicts that the mode with @xmath9 node parallel to the gate has a frequency larger than that of modes @xmath49 and @xmath117 .",
    "in the maps of resonances as a function of @xmath3 the number of detected resonances depends on the driving force @xmath6 .",

    "many more resonances appear fig .",
    "[ sm14](b ) ] .",
    "a comparison of the resonance frequencies reveals that the additional resonances are almost all harmonics of the four modes @xmath48 , @xmath116 , @xmath49 , and @xmath117 ( see following section ) .",
    "the same scenario develops for measurements with the fm technique at high driving force : additional resonances are detected [ fig .",
    "[ sm1](a ) and ( b ) ] and identified as harmonics of the four modes ( see following section ) . here",
    ", the number of discernible harmonics is even larger than that measured with the two - source technique .",
    "in fig .  [ sm2 ] , we plot the four modes and their harmonics on top of each other by dividing each of them by their respective harmonic order [ i.e. the index number in fig .  [",
    "sm1](c ) ] . in the case of the modes",
    "@xmath116 , @xmath49 , and @xmath117 , the curves are perfectly on top of each other . for mode @xmath48 ,",
    "the scaling is slightly less good .",
    "harmonics can be generated by several mechanisms . in the following",
    ", we will briefly discuss the parametric effect , electrical nonlinearities , and mechanical nonlinearities as possible origin of the harmonics .    a common way to explain harmonics",
    "is based on the parametric effect  @xcite .",
    "a mode at a resonance frequency @xmath118 can be actuated by varying the resonator spring constant @xmath32 at a frequency @xmath119 , where @xmath31 is an integer @xmath120 .",
    "it is easy to parametrically drive a nanotube resonator with a gate voltage , because @xmath118 ( and therefore @xmath32 ) is widely tunable with @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "there exists a threshold @xmath121 above which the motion sets in : this threshold takes the form @xmath122 , where @xmath123 is the change of the resonance frequency with gate voltage . for mode @xmath116",
    ", we get @xmath124mhz / v close to @xmath59v .",
    "together with the quality factor @xmath125 and @xmath126mhz , this yields a threshold of @xmath127mv .",
    "this is consistent with the harmonics for mode @xmath116 in fig .",
    "[ sm1](a ) ( @xmath128mv ) .",
    "however , parametric excitation can not account for the harmonics of order @xmath42 and @xmath129 of mode @xmath48 .",
    "a second scenario for harmonics is related to electrical nonlinearities in the circuit .",
    "nonlinearities in current - voltage characteristics can generate forces at @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath42 , ... times the frequency of the applied @xmath50 and thus lead to harmonics with an index number @xmath130 .",
    "however , harmonics with an index number @xmath131 are unlikely to have an electrical origin .",
    "mechanical nonlinearities are predicted to give rise to harmonics .",
    "for instance , the quadratic nonlinear force can cause harmonics at @xmath132 and @xmath133 , and the cubic nonlinear force can induce harmonics at @xmath134 and @xmath135  @xcite .",
    "the combination of the quadratic and the cubic nonlinear forces can lead to harmonics with index @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath136 , @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath137 , @xmath138 , ...",
    "@xcite , which is in agreement with our measurements .    in conclusion ,",
    "the origin of the harmonics is not clear at the moment and this calls for future work .",
    "we perform finite element simulations with ansys ( r ) release 13.0 to reproduce the @xmath12 dependence of the resonance frequencies . the mechanical properties of carbon nanotubes are well described by continuum elasticity and are independent of the chirality  @xcite .",
    "for these simulations , we use a tube with length @xmath139@xmath90 m , radius @xmath111 nm , wall thickness @xmath140 nm , mass density @xmath141kg / m@xmath142 , and young modulus @xmath143tpa .",
    "we use the shape of the nanotube extracted from the scanning electron micrograph of the device ( fig .",
    "[ sm10 ] ) .",
    "we assume that the static deformation is only in the horizontal plane when the device is not voltage biased .",
    "we use the 1-d beam188 element suitable for analyzing slender beam structures .",
    "1-d beam188 is a two - node element in 3-d and has six degrees of freedom at each node : translations in the @xmath144 , @xmath145 , and @xmath146 directions and rotations about the @xmath144 , @xmath145 , and @xmath146 directions .",
    "a circular tube section is associated to the element by providing the inner and the outer radii .",
    "the constraints at the clamping points are fixed by setting all degrees of freedom to zero .",
    "because of the high aspect ratio of nanotubes , we use point - like clamping conditions . the effect of the angle of the nanotube with respect to the electrodes is thus not accounted for . the electrostatic force induced by the dc voltage applied on the gate electrode , @xmath6 ,",
    "is analytically calculated . for each gate voltage , the static deformation of the nanotube is calculated by performing a nonlinear structural analysis .",
    "this static solution is used as a base for the modal analysis .",
    "in the following , we demonstrate that a good qualitative understanding of the motion of a suspended nanotube is possible from the euler - bernoulli equation .",
    "this approach provides analytical solutions that capture the behaviour of the system and that are similar to the solutions of the finite - element simulations performed with ansys .",

    "<S> these experimental findings are consistent with the theory of strong coupling between mechanical modes in a resonator  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the observation that strong coupling occurs for a frequency ratio of @xmath0 or @xmath1 implies that quadratic and cubic nonlinear forces are important and that the equation of motion for mode @xmath20 is of the form    @xmath21    with @xmath22 the motional amplitude , @xmath23 the time , @xmath24 the angular resonance frequency , and @xmath25 the effective force normalized by the mass  @xcite ; @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 are various constants . </S>",

    "<S> quadratic and cubic nonlinear forces ( @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 ) naturally emerge from the tension in the beam that is induced by motion - the beam is stretched and compressed periodically in time because it is clamped at both ends . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath36 and @xmath37 forces are responsible for the hystereses and the asymmetric resonance lineshapes in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(d ) and ( f ) . </S>",
    "<S> the upward asymmetry in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(d ) is associated with the cubic @xmath37 force , since motion - induced tension leads to a positive coefficient @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> when the static deformation of the beam @xmath38 becomes sizeable , the quadratic @xmath36 force can lead to a reversal of the asymmetry  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate from the asymmetries in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(d ) and ( f ) that @xmath38 is @xmath39 and @xmath40 nm at @xmath41 and @xmath42v , respectively ( supplementary section xi ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is in fair agreement with the calculation in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2(e ) , which supports that the nonlinear @xmath36 and @xmath37 forces originate from motion - induced tension . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate that these forces are @xmath1 orders of magnitude larger than electrostatic nonlinear forces  @xcite and thus neglect the latter ( supplementary section xii ) . </S>",
    "<S> the coupling forces @xmath34 and @xmath35 are intimately related to the @xmath36 and @xmath37 forces , since they all arise in the same way from the euler - bernoulli equation ( supplementary section ix ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is thus likely that the modal coupling in our experiment is also due to motion - induced tension . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , the coupling is mediated by the tension generated by the oscillation of one mode , which affects the dynamics of the other mode , and _ vice - versa_. the solutions of the equations of motion that describe motion - induced tension [ eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) ] are characterized by exotic lineshapes for the case of commensurable resonance frequencies  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the lineshapes are sensitive to the coefficients of the coupling forces in a critical fashion . </S>",
    "<S> a detailed comparison between experiment and theory is not possible at the moment , since the coefficients depend on the static shape of the nanotube , which is not known precisely enough .    </S>",
    "<S> the exotic lineshapes in nanotube resonators are analogous to fermi resonances observed in the infrared and raman spectra of molecules  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> when the frequency of a vibrational mode of a molecule is twice as large as that of another mode , energy can be transferred from one mode to the other . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to a mixing of the eigenfunctions and to unusual spectra . </S>",
    "<S> however , the coupling between the vibrational modes can not be externally tuned as in nanotube resonators .    </S>",
    "<S> the mode coupling force can be made larger in nanotube resonators than in resonators made from other materials , since the coupling force scales inversely with the fourth power of the resonator length ( supplementary section ix ) and that nanotube resonators can be as short as @xmath43 nm  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> mode coupling is further enhanced by the excellent material characteristics of nanotubes , since the coupling force is linearly proportional to @xmath44 ( supplementary section ix ) and that nanotubes have a high young modulus @xmath45 and a low mass density @xmath46 .    </S>",
    "<S> the achievement of strong coupling combined with the possibility to tune its strength open up many possibilities . </S>",
    "<S> such coupling may lead to sizeable signatures in the quantum - to - classical transition of a mechanical resonator  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in the quantum regime , it may allow for the manipulation of energy quanta between different mechanical modes using gate voltage pulses . </S>",
    "<S> classically , the transfer of energy between mechanical modes could be made faster than the energy relaxation time , which is interesting for high - speed signal operation  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the nonlinear nature of strong coupling is expected to give rise to non - intuitive behaviours that have not been tested thus far  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a striking example is that driving one of two coupled modes can cause the second mode to reach a higher amplitude than that of the driven one .    </S>",
    "<S> when finalizing the manuscript , we became aware of the paper by antonio et al .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite that reports on strong coupling in a @xmath47 mm long micromechanical resonator . </S>",
    "<S> the frequency of the modes is tuned by increasing the driving force ( through the duffing force ) . </S>",
