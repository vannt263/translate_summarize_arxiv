    "thermodynamics of black hole has been research frontier for several decades . in the presence of a negative cosmological constant , there can be very rich phase structures in the black hole thermodynamic phase space . since the early work @xcite on the phase transition in the schwarzschild ads black hole",
    "which is presently known as hawking - page transition , our understanding about black hole phase transitions has been greatly extended .",
    "an important example is the first order phase transition in reissner - nordstrm - ads ( rn - ads ) spacetime@xcite , which has being compared with van der waals liquid - gas phase transition frequently .",
    "recently , the idea of including the cosmological constant in the first law of black hole has become popular @xcite .",
    "following this idea , the cosmological constant is no longer a fixed parameter , but rather a thermodynamic variable .",
    "the ads background can be varying .",
    "one may doubt the necessity of this consideration . however , there are indeed some physical reasons of doing it @xcite . under this consideration ,",
    "the black hole mass should be identified as the enthalpy @xmath7 rather than the internal energy @xcite , and the cosmological constant becomes an effective thermodynamic pressure @xmath8 the thermodynamic volume @xmath9 that conjugates to @xmath10 is naturally defined as @xmath11 .",
    "a detailed study of the volume can be found in @xcite .",
    "the temperature of the black hole is a function of the black hole radius ( which is closely related to @xmath9 ) and the cosmological constant .",
    "such a relationship can be inverted and taken as the equation of states ( eos ) for the black hole system , and hence one can adopt the usual methods used in classical thermodynamics to analyze the critical behavior of the black hole .    there has been a huge amount of literature pursuing the above idea for diverse choices of ads black holes , and most works indicate that there is a close analogy between the @xmath12 criticalities of ads black holes and the phase transition in van der waals liquid - gas system . ref .",
    "@xcite is an investigation of 4-dimensional rn ads black hole in the extended phase space , which proved the analogy with van der waals system is very precise .",
    "then the analogy has been extended to other cases , including higher dimensional charged black holes @xcite , rotating black holes and black rings @xcite , gauss - bonnet black holes @xcite , @xmath13 black hole @xcite , black holes with scalar hair @xcite , black holes with nonlinear source @xcite , born - infeld black holes @xcite , rn de - sitter black holes @xcite , and the third lovelock - born - infeld black holes in @xmath14 @xcite . in a recent work @xcite",
    ", we studied the criticality of static gauss - bonnet black holes in ads spacetime , taking the gauss - bonnet coupling constant as a free thermodynamic variable .",
    "see @xcite for some other related works .    in this work we shall study the @xmath12 criticality of the static black holes in the third order lovelock gravity in diverse dimensions . in the presence of a cosmological constant",
    ", the black holes can be classified using the normalized sectional curvature of the black hole horizons .",
    "there are three different classes of black hole solutions in this classification scheme , i.e. black holes with horizon curvatures @xmath0 . for @xmath4 ,",
    "the solution remains a black hole solution even if the cosmological constant is analytically continued to the positive regime , and the hawking temperature is still given by the same expression as in the case of ads background .    for @xmath1 ,",
    "the eos is identical to that of an ideal gas , thus no phase transition could happen . for @xmath4 and @xmath14 ,",
    "there is one critical point and the first order phase transition can easily be obtained .",
    "all these result are the same with the work of @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we give a detailed analysis of @xmath15 and @xmath3 . for @xmath2 ,",
    "there is one critical point in any dimension @xmath3 . when @xmath16 the system is physical if and only if @xmath17 .",
    "we can find the first order phase transition in specific regions of @xmath10 .",
    "when @xmath4 , the situation is a little more complicated .",
    "there are one critical point in @xmath5 dimensions , two critical points in @xmath6 dimensions and no critical points in @xmath18 dimensions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we will give a brief review of the thermodynamics of the third order lovelock black holes .",
    "in section 3 we give the eos and find the critical points in diverse dimensions . in section 4 we investigate the critical behavior of the system . finally in section 5",
    "we present some concluding remarks .",
    "to start with we give a brief review of the thermodynamics of the third order lovelock black holes @xcite . setting the newton constant @xmath19 ,",
    "the action is given by @xmath20 where the gauss - bonnet and the third order lovelock densities are given as @xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath23 and @xmath24 respectively are the second ( i.e. gauss - bonnet ) and the third lovelock coefficients .",
    "for the particular choice of gauss - bonnet and lovelock coefficients @xmath25 it is known that there exist analytic static black hole solution of the form",
    "@xcite @xmath26 @xmath27,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath0 if @xmath28 and @xmath4 if @xmath29 , @xmath30 is the line element on a @xmath31-dimensional maximally symmetric einstein manifold with curvature @xmath32 .",
    "we will be working mostly with @xmath28 , however , we shall see that @xmath33 can become negative ( i.e. @xmath34 can become positive ) in an isothermal process .",
    "the same phenomenon has also been observed while studying the @xmath12 criticalities of other ads black holes , e.g. in @xcite for the case of rn - ads black hole .",
    "the gravitational mass @xmath35 can be expressed as @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the volume of the @xmath31-dimensional submanifold just mentioned .",
    "the radius @xmath38 of the black hole is one of the roots of @xmath39 ( in ads spacetime , it is the largest root of @xmath39 ) . identifying @xmath40",
    "we can rearrange the equations @xmath41 and @xmath42 in the form @xmath43.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] among various choices for the spacetime dimension @xmath44 , the particular case @xmath14 is qualitatively different from other choices , because the last term in ( [ eq.t ] ) vanishes when @xmath14 .",
    "consequently , the temperature @xmath45 vanishes as @xmath46 when @xmath14 , whilst it becomes divergent as @xmath46 in higher dimensions . that the case @xmath14 is distinguished from the cases of higher dimensions is perhaps a consequence of the fact that @xmath14 is the lowest dimension in which the third order lovelock density can affect the local geometry .",
    "we shall see later that the critical behavior in @xmath14 is also distinguished from the cases of higher dimensions .",
    "the other thermodynamic quantities which we need in the following discussions are given as follows .",
    "these are the black hole entropy@xcite @xmath47\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the thermodynamic volume @xmath48 we see that the thermodynamic volume is a monotonic function of the horizon radius .",
    "the first law of black hole thermodynamics in the extended phase space can be expressed as @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the thermodynamic conjugate of @xmath51 which is given by @xmath52    it should be remarked that in general cases the first law should contain contributions from the gauss - bonnet and lovelock coefficients as independent thermodynamic variables . however , in our case , these two objects are proportional to each other and we are left with only a single parameter @xmath51 as given in .",
    "a detailed discussion of extended first law and smarr formula for lovelock gravity can be found in @xcite .",
    "the gibbs free energy can be obtained by @xmath53 \\bigg)\\bigg\\}.\\label{eq.g}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] notice that although on the left hand side we have included @xmath45 and @xmath10 as independent variables for the gibbs free energy , the right hand side does not explicitly contain @xmath45 . to understand eq .",
    "( [ eq.g ] ) , we must think of @xmath38 as an implicit function of @xmath45 and @xmath10 .",
    "the implicit relationship is given by the expression ( [ eq.t ] ) for the temperature .",
    "eq . can be rearranged into the following form , @xmath54 this equation can be regarded as the thermodynamic eos for the black hole system . instead of the thermodynamic volume @xmath9",
    ", we introduce the parameter @xmath55 as an effective specific volume .",
    "then the eos takes the form @xmath56 which resembles the eos of van der waals system to some extent .",
    "the critical points , if exist , correspond to inflection points on the isotherms , i.e. they must obey the conditions @xmath57 and @xmath58 should change signs around each of the solutions . merely finding the solution of ( [ eq.cri ] ) is insufficient to justify the existence of a critical point , because the second derivative @xmath58 may have the same signs around the solution , making the solution corresponds to an extremum , rather than an inflection point .",
    "later we shall see that when @xmath59 and @xmath60 , the solution to ( [ eq.cri ] ) is indeed not an inflection point and thus no critical point exists in twelve dimensions .",
    "now let us proceed to find all possible critical points for each values of @xmath0 in diverse dimensions .",
    "when @xmath1 , eq . reduces into @xmath61 this equation is independent of the spacetime dimension @xmath44 , and is identical to the eos of an ideal gas .",
    "the conditions ( [ eq.cri ] ) regarded as a system of algebraic equations for @xmath45 and @xmath62 have no finite nonzero solution , so there is no critical point when @xmath1 in any dimension .      in this case , eq .",
    "becomes @xmath63 correspondingly , eq . possesses a single solution @xmath64 which can be checked to be a real critical point .",
    "the corresponding critical pressure is @xmath65 the critical parameters @xmath66 and @xmath67 must all be real positive , so the existence of critical point requires @xmath68 .",
    "it is easy to check that @xmath69 which depends only on @xmath44 but not on any other parameters .",
    "remember that the above critical point exists in all dimensions @xmath3 .",
    "in this case the eos reads @xmath70 we have two solutions to eq.([eq.cri ] ) , which read @xmath71 and @xmath72 where @xmath73 the corresponding pressures are given respectively as follows , @xmath74}{48\\pi \\alpha(d+3 - 2\\mathcal{a})^3 ( \\mathcal{a}-3d+6 ) } , \\label{pc1}\\\\ p_{c2}&=-\\frac{(d-2)(d-3)^2\\bigg[(15d^2 - 222d+177)d+\\mathcal{a } ( d^2 - 160d+255)+414\\bigg]}{48\\pi\\alpha(d+3 + 2\\mathcal{a})^3(\\mathcal{a}+3d-6)}. \\label{pc2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for these solutions to be real - valued , the constant @xmath75 must also be real - valued .",
    "this requires @xmath76 . on the other hand ,",
    "the third order lovelock density is geometrically nontrivial only when @xmath3 , therefore , for @xmath4 , critical points can only possibly exist in dimensions @xmath77 . in particular , when @xmath60 , the above two solutions degenerate , and one can check that @xmath58 does not change sign around this degenerate solution . when @xmath14 , both @xmath78 and @xmath79 vanish , with the corresponding @xmath80 going to negative infinity .",
    "clearly @xmath81 does not correspond to a black hole configuration , so the first solution is excluded from the possible candidates of critical points when @xmath14 .",
    "one can check that for @xmath82 , @xmath58 indeed changes sign around each of the above solutions , and for @xmath14 , the above object also changes sign around the second solution .",
    "so we conclude that , when @xmath4 , there will be a single critical point in dimensions @xmath14 and two critical points in dimensions @xmath83 .",
    ".the numerical critical parameters at the first critical point [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     it is a trivial practice to show that the combinations @xmath84 are both only dependent on the dimension @xmath44 .",
    "the numerical values for the critical parameters are given in table [ tab1 ] and table [ tab2 ] .",
    "the values for @xmath85 are given in units of @xmath86 , those for @xmath66 are given in units of @xmath87 and for @xmath67 are given in units of @xmath88 .",
    "in all subsequent discussions we will stick to this unit system . the critical pressure @xmath80 is negative in dimensions @xmath89 .",
    "this is not a problem given that the black hole solution remains valid for a positive cosmological constant .",
    "previous studies indicate that critical points may exist for ads black holes with @xmath2 in various models of gravity . however ,",
    "the behavior of such black holes near the criticalities is in some sense exotic and has been paid less attention as compared to the cases of @xmath4 black holes . in this work",
    ", we will pay particular attention to the @xmath2 cases and show how exotic it is for such black holes .    as mentioned earlier ,",
    "the hawking temperature ( and hence the eos ) is qualitatively different for @xmath14 and @xmath90 , so we shall subdivide our discussions into @xmath14 and @xmath90 cases .    *",
    "1 ) the case of @xmath14 *    in the rest of the paper , we will treat the thermodynamics of the lovelock ads black holes as a @xmath91 system , taking the lovelock coefficient @xmath51 as a constant parameter .",
    "this is of course an incomplete description of the lovelock black holes , because the coupling coefficient @xmath51 should also play a role in the thermodynamics of the black holes , just like in the case of gb ads black holes @xcite .",
    "fig.[fig1 ] gives the isobaric and isothermal plots for our @xmath91 system at @xmath14 and @xmath2 , in which the parameter @xmath51 is taken to be equal to @xmath92 .",
    "the critical value of the parameters are @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 .    .",
    "on the left plots , all the isobars are discontinuous at @xmath16 , except the one corresponding to @xmath17 ( dashed line ) , and the pressure decreases from top to bottom .",

    "the temperatures decrease from top to bottom on the right plots .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=40.0% ]    from the isobaric plots given in fig.[fig1 ] , one can see that for each @xmath97 , there is a region for @xmath62 containing @xmath66 such that the temperature @xmath45 goes negative , which means that black holes with such parameters are thermodynamically unstable and should not exist actually .",
    "meanwhile , on the isothermal plots , one sees that for sufficiently low temperatures @xmath98 , there is a segment on the isotherms such that the pressure becomes negative .",
    "such black hole states are physically impossible , because negative @xmath10 corresponds to positive cosmological constant @xmath34 , and it is well known that black holes with positive cosmological constant can not have @xmath2 .",
