    "the issues surrounding galaxy formation and evolution provide significant motivation for ongoing astrophysical research .",
    "although several of the basic physical processes that drive the formation and evolution of galaxies were identified some time ago , such as the gravitational collapse of dark matter , the cooling and dissipative collapse of baryons , the variation in star formation rates with time , and galaxy mergers , constructing detailed models that reproduce observed properties for a wide range of galaxy types and redshifts has proven exceedingly difficult",
    ". a precise determination of the cosmological parameters has removed some of the uncertainties , but it is largely accepted that comprehensive observations of galaxies at low and high redshifts are necessary to refine our understanding of galaxy evolution .",
    "recent years have seen dramatic progress in the observational study of high redshift galaxies .",
    "much of this progress has been driven by deep imaging of `` blank '' fields with multiple bandpasses .",
    "these surveys often rely on carefully - designed color selection techniques , making use of only a few bands , to isolate samples of high redshift galaxies .",
    "the most well known color selection criteria identify the lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) at @xmath9 @xcite , using the @xmath10 bands .",
    "this technique has been extended to select lbgs at higher redshifts , and to select similar star - forming galaxies at @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( bx and bm galaxies , respectively ; * ? ? ?",
    "selecting galaxies in optical bands may miss many red high redshift galaxies , so nir selection techniques have also become important .",
    "extremely red objects ( eros ) are at @xmath13 , and have been selected using a variety of criteria , such as @xmath14 and @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "@xcite used @xmath16 to select distant red galaxies ( drgs ) at @xmath17 .",
    "@xcite proposed a technique involving the @xmath18 bands to identify galaxies at @xmath19 .",
    "@xcite used @xmath20 to isolate irac extremely red objects ( ieros ) .",
    "the primary advantage of such selection techniques is that they rely on only a few observed bands to isolate large samples of galaxies in a ( hopefully ) well - defined redshift range .",
    "however , diagnostic information about individual galaxies or about the range of properties spanned by a sample of galaxies requires more bands to trace the detailed spectral energy distributions over a wide wavelength range .",
    "specific color selection techniques may also identify only a subset of galaxies in the targeted redshift range ( by design ) , offering a limited view of the diversity of galaxy properties at that redshift .",
    "surveys with a large number of observed bands may be able to use photometric redshifts to obtain a more complete sample of galaxies in any given redshift range , and are better able to specify the intrinsic properties of high redshift galaxies .    with these issues in mind",
    ", we have executed a deep optical / nir survey of four southern and equatorial fields as part of the multiwavelength survey by yale - chile ( musyc ) .",
    "subsets of these data have been used to study several characteristics of @xmath8-selected galaxies at @xmath21 , including the number density and colors of massive galaxies @xcite , the clustering properties @xcite , and the luminosity function @xcite .",
    "additionally , @xcite obtained nir spectroscopy of the brightest musyc galaxies , and @xcite used _ spitzer _",
    "mips imaging to infer the star formation rate of musyc drgs .",
    "the purpose of this paper is two - fold .",
    "first , we present the musyc deep nir imaging .",
    "we describe the observations , data reduction , and the @xmath8-selected catalogs with full @xmath22 photometry .",
    "second , we use these catalogs and high quality photometric redshifts to investigate the properties of galaxies that are selected with common color selection criteria .",
    "we use vega magnitudes unless noted otherwise . throughout",
    "we use @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 .",
    "the musyc survey consists of several components : optical imaging of four @xmath26 fields , nir imaging over the same area , deeper nir imaging over four @xmath27 subfields , and spectroscopic followup .",
    "some of the musyc fields also benefit from imaging by _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm _ in the x - ray , _ hst _ in the optical , and _",
    "spitzer _ in the infrared .",
    "the survey design is described by @xcite .",
    "the four @xmath26 fields were selected to have low galactic reddening , hi column density @xcite , and @xmath28 dust emission @xcite .",
    "they were also chosen to have high galactic latitude to reduce the number of stars , to cover a wide range in right ascension to enable flexible scheduling , and to be accessible from chilean observatories .",
    "these fields were observed with @xmath7 filters for complete optical coverage .",
    "a narrowband @xmath29  filter was also used to identify lyman @xmath30 emitters at @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "@xcite presents images and optically - selected catalogs of one of the musyc fields , ehdf - s .",
    "the full optical data for the remaining fields will be described elsewhere ( e. gawiser et al .",
    "2007 , in preparation ) .",
    "the four @xmath26 fields were also observed in at least one of the @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath8 bands .",
    "we refer to this as the `` wide '' portion of the musyc nir imaging .",
    "these data were collected and processed in a similar way to the data described in this paper ( e. taylor et al .",
    "2007 , in preparation ; g. blanc 2007 et al . 2007 , in preparation ) .",
    "the typical depths are @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "four @xmath27 subfields were observed to greater depth in all of @xmath0 .",
    "these data , which are referred to as the `` deep '' nir musyc imaging , are presented in this paper .",
    "two of these subfields , hdfs1 and hdfs2 , are adjacent and lie within the larger @xmath26 musyc extended hubble deep field - south ( ehdf - s ) .",
    "the other two subfields lie within the larger musyc 1030 and 1255 fields .",
    "we did not perform deep nir imaging in the fourth large musyc field , ecdf - s , because very deep imaging in the central region of this field has been made available by the great observatories origins deep survey ( goods ) team @xcite .",
    "the exact locations of the deep musyc fields within the larger @xmath36 fields were chosen to avoid bright stars .",
    "information about these fields is given in table  [ tbl : field_chars ] .",
    "the musyc deep nir observations were performed with the infrared sideport imager ( ispi ) @xcite on the ctio blanco 4 m telescope .",
    "the detector is a @xmath37 hgcdte hawaii-2 array , with a @xmath38 pixel scale and a @xmath39 field of view .",
    "observation were performed over the course of 9 observing runs from january 2003 to april 2006 .",
    "the mean airmass of observation varied between 1.21 and 1.43 for different field / filter combinations , and exposures were rarely taken at airmass @xmath40 .",
    "standard stars from @xcite were observed 2 - 4 times per night except when the conditions were poor .",
    "the range of airmass values for standard star observations was similar to that of science observations .",
    "the background emission in the nir is bright , non - uniform across the field , and can vary on short timescales .",
    "accurate background subtraction requires that the telescope be dithered between exposures ( see  [ sec : data_reduction ] ) . because the brightest objects in an exposure can leave residual images in subsequent exposures , using a non - regular dither pattern ",
    "in which the telescope does not repeatedly trace the same sequence of dither positions  facilitates removal of artifacts during the reduction process .",
    "we used an algorithm to generate semi - random dither patterns in which the distance between subsequent dither positions is maximized .",
    "the size of the dither box is @xmath41 , which is sufficiently large to obtain good background subtraction in the regions around all but the brightest / most extended sources in our fields without significantly reducing the area with the highest exposure times .",
    "the typical exposure times at each dither position were @xmath42 ( coadds @xmath43 individual exposure time ) in @xmath32 , @xmath44 in @xmath33 , and @xmath45 in @xmath8 .",
    "the total exposure times for each field / filter combination , after discarding images with poor quality (  [ sec : data_reduction ] ) , are given in table  [ tbl : field_chars ] .",
    "the set of filters used with ispi changed in april 2004 .",
    "the fields hdfs1 and 1030 were completed using the original @xmath46 filters , whereas hdfs2 and 1255 were observed using the newer @xmath47 filters .",
    "both sets of filter transmission curves are shown in figure  [ fig : filt_curves ] .",
    "conversions between the vega and ab magnitude systems were calculated using the sed of vega , and are given , along with the effective wavelengths , in table  [ tbl : ab_conversions ] .",
    "note that the shift in effective wavelength between the @xmath48 and @xmath49 filters is small , and much less than the filter widths . in the discussion that follows",
    "we do not distinguish between the two filter sets .",
    "the data were reduced using a combination of standard iraf tasks , modified iraf tasks , and custom tasks .",
    "the core of our reduction procedure was the external iraf package xdimsum .",
    "the basic methods are similar to those described in detail by @xcite , and are outlined below .",
    "near - infrared cameras have a non - negligible dark current , so dark images with the appropriate exposure time and number of coadds are subtracted from the science images .",
    "we use domeflats to perform the flat field correction . to remove the background emission from the domeflat image , and thus to isolate the uniform illumination of the dome screen by the lamp ,",
    "we follow the standard procedure of subtracting a `` lamp off '' image from a `` lamp on '' image . during the observations",
    ", special care was taken to keep the count level of the `` lamp on '' images at a reasonable level , well below where non - linearity becomes significant on the ispi camera .",
    "domeflats were taken nightly or semi - nightly ; they were generally stable from night to night , but showed significant variations between observing runs .",
    "the background emission in each science frame is subtracted , and the resulting images combined , in two passes . during the first pass , an image of the background emission is created for each science image using a running median of the dithered sequence of science images ; e.g.  the background for image 10 is the median combination of images 6 - 9 and 11 - 14 .",
    "the positions of several stars are used to determine the relative shifts between background - subtracted images .",
    "the images are shifted to a common reference using sub - pixel interpolation and are combined .",
    "objects in the combined image are detected using a simple thresholding algorithm .",
    "these masks are shifted back into the frame of individual science exposures , and the background - subtraction process is repeated during the second pass ; this time objects are masked out during the calculation of the running median in order to improve the background subtraction .",
    "we take several steps to improve the quality of the final images .",
    "we create a mask of bad pixels in each image .",
    "an initial list of bad pixels is created using the flat - field images .",
    "we then inspect each background - subtracted image individually ; images with severe artifacts ( e.g.  disturbed point spread functions ) are discarded , while others with localized artifacts ( e.g.  satellite trails ) are masked using a custom procedure .",
    "additional bad pixels in each image are identified using a cosmic ray detection procedure or are removed with a sigma - clipping algorithm during image combining .",
    "the ispi array can retain memory of previous exposures in the form of persistence images of bright objects .",
    "we create a second object mask at the end of the first pass reduction , in which only the cores of the brightest objects are masked ; these are used to mask the pixels that contained bright objects during the previous exposure .",
    "finally , we optimize the signal - to - noise in the seeing disk by using a weighted average during the final image combining step . the weights are calculated using @xmath50 where @xmath51 is a constant used to scale the signal in image @xmath52 to the common level , and @xmath53 is the pixel - to - pixel rms measured in a blank region of the unscaled image .",
    "the values @xmath51 and @xmath54 are determined for each image using a set of bright non - saturated stars , which are chosen in locations away from dense regions of bad pixels .    the final products of our reduction procedures are a combined image , an exposure time map , and an rms map which gives an estimate of the noise level at each pixel .",
    "the observations , reduction , and characteristics of the first optical musyc data are described in @xcite .",
    "subsequent data were reduced and analyzed using similar methods , and will be described by e. gawiser et al .",
    "( 2007 , in preparation ) .",
    "most of the optical imaging was obtained using the 8 ccd mosaic ii camera on the blanco 4 m telescope at ctio .",
    "each image was re - sampled to provide a uniform pixel scale and tangent plane projection using stars with known positions from the usno - b catalog .",
    "the final rms astrometric errors are estimated to be less than @xmath55 across the entire field .",
    "we use the iraf tasks geomap and geotran to re - sample the nir images so that they follow the same logical and world coordinate system ( i.e. @xmath56 , @xmath57 pixel coordinates and @xmath58 , @xmath59 ) as a set of trimmed optical musyc images .",
    "this process flips the nir images around the x - axis so that north is up and east is left , in accordance with standard practice .",
    "the pixel scale is changed slightly , from @xmath60 to @xmath61 .",
    "we used a @xmath62 order fit in x and y , allowing for cross - terms , to adequately remove the distortions present in the ispi instrument ; a similar high - order fit was also found to be necessary by ispi instrument scientists .",
    "we verified that the pixel resampling does not introduce systematic errors in flux for a set of objects distributed across the images .",
    "the rms error in stellar positions between the nir and optical images is @xmath63 , much smaller than the typical aperture size used for photometry .",
    "we also compared the positions of stars in our @xmath8-band images to those in the usno - b catalog directly .",
    "many of the objects are in fact extended , and some others are saturated in our images ; after removing these objects the rms is @xmath64 , consistent with the uncertainties of individual usno - b stars .",
    "the final @xmath8-band images are shown in figure  [ fig : images ] .",
    "the stretch has been adjusted to emphasize faint sources and the uniformity of the background .",
    "figure  [ fig : color_image ] shows a color composite image of hdfs1 , constructed using the @xmath65 bands .",
    "the effective seeing in the final images is taken as the median of the fwhm for a set of @xmath66 stars , and is given in table  [ tbl : field_chars ] .    .",
    "[ fig : color_image ]      observations of standard stars from @xcite were performed nightly except when the conditions were very poor .",
    "each standard star observation used a large 5-point dither pattern , and the telescope was de - focused to keep the peak count level in the linear regime of ispi . following @xcite , the instrumental magnitude of the star was measured in a @xmath67 diameter aperture ; we verified that increasing the aperture size would change the instrumental zeropoints by @xmath68 .",
    "the zeropoint rms from a single dither sequence of a standard star is typically @xmath69 , setting an approximate scale for the flatness of the images .",
    "we then calibrated a set of secondary standard stars in the science field with the same size aperture , after applying a small correction for the different airmass of standard star and science observations .",
    "it was not possible to determine accurate airmass coefficients from our observations , so we used the coefficients given by @xcite , which were nonetheless found to be consistent with our observations . following usual practice in the nir , we did not account for color terms in the photometric calibration .",
    "there was at least one night for each field / filter combination where the observing conditions were sufficient to determine an accurate calibration of the secondary standards . for field",
    "/ filter combinations where there was more than one night of satisfactory calibrations , the agreement between nights is typically @xmath70 .",
    "while it is difficult to place constraints on possible systematic uncertainties , the internal precision of our final zeropoints is @xmath71 in every case .",
    "the zeropoints are given in table [ tbl : image_chars ] .",
    "the quality of our photometric calibrations was verified in several ways .",
    "there is a @xmath72 overlap region between two of our fields , hdfs1 and hdfs2 , where the exposure time is at least half of the total . as these fields were observed on different runs , using different nir filters , and the photometric zeropoints",
    "were determined independently , comparing the total magnitudes (   [ sec : photometry ] ) of objects in this region from the two fields allows a check of the internal consistency of our photometric calibrations .",
    "we find that the median offset is less than 0.02 for bright objects in each of @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath8 .",
    "it should be noted that these objects lie near ( opposite ) edges of the ispi detector in the two fields , where the flat - fielding errors may be larger ; the good agreement between the two fields is encouraging .",
    "we do not attempt to adjust the zeropoints to obtain better agreement .",
    "the musyc hdfs1 field contains the @xmath73 fires hdf - s field @xcite , allowing for an additional check of our photometry .",
    "the fwhm of the fires image is @xmath74 . rather than using the total magnitudes from the fires catalog",
    ", we convolved the public fires image to match the musyc point spread function ( psf ) , and directly compared the aperture photometry for a set of compact objects .",
    "we found the agreement to be better than @xmath75 magnitudes in each of @xmath0 .",
    "a final check comes from comparing our total magnitudes to the aperture - corrected magnitudes from the public 2mass point - source catalog @xcite .",
    "we selected a set of matching objects from the three musyc deep nir fields , rejecting objects with low s / n in the 2mass photometry , that were affected by non - linearity / saturation in the musyc photometry , or were blended with other objects .",
    "the mean offset ranges between @xmath76 for hdfs1 and hdfs2 , generally consistent with the errors .",
    "however , adopting zeropoints based on the 2mass photometry would decrease the level of agreement for objects in the overlapping region of hdfs1 and hdfs2 for two out of three nir filters , and would decrease the agreement between hdfs1 and the fires hdf - s photometry for all three filters . for these two fields , we conclude that our flux calibration and the quoted zeropoint uncertainties are reliable , and are better than could be obtained by calibrating directly from the 2mass catalogs .    however , the agreement between 2mass photometry and musyc photometry is worse for the 1030 and 1255 fields .",
    "the mean difference between 2mass and musyc 1030 photometry is a remarkably consistent @xmath77 in each of @xmath0 , where the uncertainties are given as the standard deviation of the mean .",
    "the sense of the disagreement is that the stars are brighter in the 2mass catalog than in the musyc catalog .",
    "the disagreement is of similar size , but in the opposite direction , for 1255 .",
    "this is worrisome , as the level of disagreement for these fields in all three filters is worse than in any of the filters for hdfs1 and hdfs2 , and moreover the differences are systematic across the filters .",
    "we have verified that this disagreement is not caused by obvious mistakes in our photometric calibrations .",
    "the systematic nature of the offsets _ may _ indicate that they are caused by aperture corrections in 2mass , rather than zeropoint errors .",
    "because our calibrations appear to work very well for hdfs1 and hdfs2 , we do not adjust our zeropoints using 2mass photometry ; but without other data to compare with , we can not be certain that our @xmath71 magnitude zeropoint uncertainties for these fields are reliable .",
    "the flux uncertainty within an aperture has a contribution from the photon statistics from astronomical objects , as well as a contribution from background noise , which is due to sky emission , read noise , etc .",
    "the standard method of determining the contribution of background noise , by e.g.  sextractor @xcite or the apphot package of iraf , is to scale the rms flux value of background pixels by the square root of the number of pixels within the aperture , @xmath78 .",
    "this scaling is appropriate if adjacent background pixels are uncorrelated , however correlations will be introduced by imperfect subtraction of background emission , extended wings from bright objects , undetected sources , re - pixelization during the reduction procedure , and artifacts in the images . in the limiting case of perfect correlations between the pixels within an aperture , the background noise @xmath79 will scale as @xmath80 .",
    "thus it might be expected that the true scaling will be @xmath81 , where @xmath82 .",
    "we follow @xcite in characterizing the noise properties of our images by summing the counts in apertures distributed randomly over empty regions of each image .",
    "the rationale and method are discussed more fully in @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : noise_hist ] shows the distribution of fluxes in @xmath83 and @xmath84 diameter apertures .",
    "these distributions are well - approximated by gaussians .",
    "figure  [ fig : noise_apsize ] shows how the width of the best - fitting gaussian changes with aperture size , along with predictions from the @xmath78 and @xmath80 scalings that are described above .",
    "it is apparent that neglecting correlations between pixels would cause a significant underestimation of background fluctuations .",
    "a single power law provides a good fit to the relationship between @xmath80 and @xmath79 for the aperture sizes of interest ; the typical power law index is @xmath85 .",
    "we estimate the flux uncertainties for each object in each band as @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the flux in adu , @xmath88 is the total effective gain , and @xmath79 is estimated for an aperture with the appropriate size . in the case of the elliptical kron apertures ( see   [ sec : photometry ] ) we estimate @xmath79 for a circular aperture with the same area .    the characteristics of the final images can be found in table [ tbl : image_chars ] .",
    "this table includes an estimate of the @xmath89 point source limiting depths .",
    "these values are calculated using the background fluctuations in the color aperture ( see  [ sec : phot_colors ] ) , and with a @xmath90 magnitude aperture correction applied to account for the @xmath91 point - source flux that falls outside this aperture .",
    "an alternate analysis of the limiting depths can be found in   [ sec : completeness ] .",
    "we used the sextractor v2.4.3 software @xcite to detect objects in the @xmath8-band images .",
    "the two parameters that affect the sensitivity of source detection are detect_thresh , which was used to specify the detection threshold in units of the rms of background pixels , and detect_minarea , which specifies the number of adjacent pixels that must meet this threshold . additionally , sextractor optionally filters the detection image with a convolution kernel prior to detection in order to enhance the detection of faint objects . rather than use detailed simulations to find the optimum set of parameters for sextractor , we made use of the ultradeep k - band image of hdfs from the public fires survey @xcite .",
    "the difference in depth between the musyc hdfs1 @xmath8-band image and the fires hdf - s image ( @xmath92 and @xmath93 , respectively ) allows for a clear determination of which objects detected by sextractor in hdfs1 are real and which are noise peaks .",
    "we increased the detect_thresh parameter slightly from the default value in order to eliminate all spurious sources in the fires region , but without significantly affecting the completeness of our catalogs .",
    "the final detection parameters were detect_minarea=5 pixels and @xmath94 , and we used a gaussian filter corresponding to the psf of the detection image .",
    "we detected objects in rms - normalized @xmath8-band images , which were created by dividing the @xmath8-band science images by the rms maps ( see  [ sec : data_reduction ] ) .",
    "detection in normalized images is important because the dithering procedure used during observations means that the outskirts of the science images are noisier , which would otherwise result in a large number of spurious sources .      in order to measure accurate colors , all optical and nir images",
    "were psf matched using gaussian convolution kernels .",
    "this is necessary to ensure that the aperture used for color measurements (  [ sec : phot_colors ] ) contains a constant fraction of the total light for every object in every band .",
    "the systematic effects on colors that are introduced by imperfect psf matching can be estimated by dividing the stellar growth curves , which were created for each image using a set of bright non - saturated stars evenly distributed over the images .",
    "we optimized the width of the convolution kernels by minimizing the difference in growth curves ; we found that simple gaussians are capable of reducing the systematic errors to the @xmath95 level for apertures as large or larger than the color apertures .",
    "the exception is the @xmath96-band , which has a psf shape that is sufficiently different from the other bands that a gaussian kernel yields errors that are @xmath97 .",
    "most of the images have fwhm from @xmath98",
    ". however the @xmath99 and @xmath100 bands are slightly worse , with values as high as @xmath101 .",
    "degrading all the images of a given field to the broadest psf would reduce the s / n significantly in every band .",
    "for the images with narrow psfs , we smooth to @xmath102 in order to measure uniform colors . images with broader psfs are treated differently .",
    "we measure e.g.  the @xmath103 color using a version of the @xmath8 image that is degraded to the same psf as @xmath99 , and add this color to the @xmath8-band flux in the color aperture of the @xmath102 @xmath8 image .",
    "it is important to note that this procedure may not be appropriate for extended objects with strong color gradients .",
    "this is because the @xmath103 color is measured for a larger region of the galaxy than is e.g.  the @xmath104 color , with the effect that the inferred @xmath105 color will be different than what could be measured in any aperture .",
    "this effect should not be a significant concern here , because distant galaxies are at best marginally resolved in our @xmath102 seeing and observed color gradients are minimal .",
    "indeed , we have verified that any errors introduced by this procedure are at no more than the percent level by directly measuring the @xmath105 color ( using a smoothed version of the @xmath32 image ) and comparing it to what is inferred from the @xmath103 and @xmath104 colors .",
    "we use sextractor in dual - image mode to detect objects in @xmath8 and to perform photometry in all bands . in this subsection",
    "we describe our methods to determine `` total '' flux in @xmath8 , and to measure high signal - to - noise ( s / n ) colors .",
    "the total flux in any other band can be calculated directly from these quantities .",
    "we estimate the total @xmath8-band flux of an object from the sextractor auto photometry , which uses a flexible elliptical kron - like aperture .",
    "although this aperture contains most of the flux for bright objects , in practice the aperture can become quite small for faint sources  even for the same light profile ",
    "so a larger fraction of light may be missed .",
    "therefore we convert the auto flux to total flux by applying an aperture correction .",
    "the aperture correction is calculated using the median stellar growth curve of a set of bright stars , for a circular aperture with the same area as the auto aperture .",
    "we note that this procedure may introduce a mild bias in the total flux of faint , extended sources , because their light profiles may not follow that of a point source outside the auto aperture ; however these sources will have highly uncertain flux measurements no matter what procedure is used .",
    "the aperture correction for the auto aperture can reach @xmath106 magnitudes for some of the faintest sources .",
    "because accurate color measurements are necessary for photometric redshift calculations and modeling of stellar populations , we wish to optimize the s / n . since the noise is a strong function of aperture size ( fig .",
    "[ fig : noise_apsize ] ) , we measure the colors in smaller apertures than the auto aperture that is used to estimate the total flux . for a point source with a gaussian psf , and for uncorrelated background noise , the aperture with optimal s / n has diameter @xmath107 @xcite . in realistic situations",
    "there are competing effects which change the size of the optimal aperture .",
    "relative to the idealized case , the broader wings of our psfs would suggest a larger aperture to obtain the same signal , while the noise correlations suggest a smaller aperture to keep the same level of noise .",
    "the optimal s / n aperture for a point source can be found by dividing the stellar growth curve by the @xmath79 curve shown in figure  [ fig : noise_apsize ] .",
    "we find that the optimal aperture typically has diameter @xmath108 times the fwhm , depending on the filter ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . using a very small aperture for color determinations",
    "presents several problems .",
    "accurate colors require that a similar fraction of the flux from an object is contained within the color aperture in each filter , which is easier to achieve with larger apertures .",
    "this is because a larger aperture contains a larger fraction of the flux , leading to a smaller relative difference in the fraction of flux . secondly , one of the primary scientific goals of the deep nir musyc survey is the study of high redshift galaxies , which may not appear as pure point - sources in our @xmath102 images .",
    "larger apertures also reduce the effects of the small variations in psf across the images , and the residual geometric distortions at the edges of the images .",
    "we choose , as a compromise , apertures with diameter @xmath109 times the stellar fwhm .",
    "these apertures contain @xmath91 of the light from a point source .",
    "we verified that the s / n in these apertures is @xmath110 of the s / n in the optimal aperture for every image .",
    "the photometry in the @xmath8-selected catalogs is presented in units of flux , normalized so that the zeropoint is 25 on the ab system .",

    "figure  [ fig : bzk ] shows that only 3 of these 9 galaxies are classified as pbzks  with another galaxy very close to the pbzk selection window  and the remaining galaxies are sbzks .",
    "it is possible that this reflects a redshift - dependence in the effectiveness of the pbzk criterion , even within the range of redshifts for which this criterion was designed : of the 9 nearly passive galaxies that lie within or very near to the pbzk region , 4 are at @xmath158 , whereas the others are at @xmath159 .",

    "the sbzk and pbzk criteria select galaxies over a very wide range in redshift .",
    "while the sbzk criterion tends to select only galaxies with bluer rest - frame optical colors at @xmath202 , it also selects many of the reddest galaxies at higher redshifts .",
    "because the sbzk criterion selects many different types of galaxies over a large range in redshift , it may be thought of as a coarse but effective photometric redshift technique .",
    "together , the sbzk and pbzk criteria detect @xmath187 of the galaxies at @xmath218 to our limit of @xmath120",
    ". a larger fraction of the pbzks than sbzks are bright in @xmath8 , which may be indicative of a difference in luminosity functions .",
    "finally , the usefulness of the bzk criteria may be limited for the reddest galaxies , which may be undetected in even the deepest optical images .",
    "a thorough understanding of the range of properties spanned by galaxies selected according to specific color criteria requires multiwavelength observations and a large sample of spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "the use of photometric redshifts is a significant limitation of the analysis presented in this paper .",
    "unfortunately , a large number of spectroscopic redshifts for an _ unbiased _ sample of the galaxies detected by current deep surveys , including those with very red colors , is exceedingly difficult to obtain .",
    "progress in the study of galaxy properties as a function of redshift will continue to rely heavily on color selection techniques , both to define galaxy samples and to identify targets for spectroscopic follow - up .",
    "an awareness of the limitations of such techniques is advisable .",
    "we are grateful to members of the musyc collaboration for enabling this research .",

    "<S> the passive bzks are fewer in number , have a different distribution of @xmath8 magnitudes , and have a somewhat different redshift distribution . by combining these color selection criteria , it appears possible to define a reasonably complete sample of galaxies to our flux limit over specific redshift ranges . </S>",
