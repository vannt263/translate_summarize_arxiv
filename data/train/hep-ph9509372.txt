    "rare kaon decays continue to be an area of active research @xcite . within the standard model ,",
    "rare decays are governed by loop level processes and thus directly probe the quantum structure of the theory .",
    "experimental searches serve several complementary purposes .",
    "improved limits help to constrain standard - model parameters , while discovery of clear discrepancies with standard - model predictions would signal new physics . proposed extensions to the standard model",
    "are similarly constrained .    of particular interest",
    "are rare decays which are dominated by short - distance contributions and hence are free of theoretical uncertainties from long - distance effects .",
    "a well - known example is @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "this decay is expected to give a clean determination of the kobayashi - maskawa matrix element @xmath4 , provided the top quark mass is well - known .",
    "another example is @xmath5 @xcite , which is of special interest because its dominant contribution is expected to arise from direct @xmath6 violation .",
    "a rare kaon decay which has not been well - studied is @xmath7 .",
    "although the reasons for its study are perhaps not as compelling as those for the previous two processes , it is just as important to test this decay for consistency with standard - model predictions ; as noted above , rare processes with very low rates are fertile ground in which to look for non - standard effects .",
    "furthermore , information about this process will be useful in background analysis of other rare - decay experiments .",
    "an early calculation by ma and okada @xcite predicted a negligible branching ratio of @xmath8 .",
    "their calculation , however , predates the confirmation of the 3rd quark family and clearly needs to be updated . in sec .",
    "[ sec : long ] we examine some long - distance processes and find contributions up to @xmath9 .",
    "short - distance effects are considered in sec .",
    "[ sec : short ] , and we find a branching ratio of @xmath10 .",
    "thus within the standard model @xmath0 also appears to be short - distance dominated .",
    "one of the defining characteristics of the standard model is the absence of tree - level flavor - changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) .",
    "however , many proposed extensions ( technicolor theories for example ) predict such currents .",
    "rare neutral current kaon decays provide an ideal window to look for such effects . in sec .",
    "[ sec : tech ] we consider possible fcnc contributions that could arise from neutral generation - changing gauge bosons .",
    "our concluding remarks appear in sec .",

    "the two long - distance contributions we consider are shown in fig.[fig : ld ] . momentum and polarization assignments",
    "are indicated on the graphs .",
    "each contribution is treated separately below .",
    "note that within the standard model the form of the @xmath11 decay amplitude is tightly constrained by lorentz and electromagnetic gauge invariance .",
    "assuming @xmath6 conservation , the only allowed form is @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are neutrino spinors , and @xmath15 .",
    "we first consider the long - distance diagrams shown in fig.([fig : ld])(a ) .",
    "they involve a weak transition of the kaon to a virtual pseudoscalar meson @xmath17 .",
    "the corresponding amplitude @xmath18 can be written in the form @xmath19 assuming @xmath20 .",
    "the quantities @xmath21 and @xmath22 represent the contributions of the @xmath23 and @xmath24 diagrams relative to the pion graph amplitude .",

    "we carefully treat symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "we use the mixing convention    [ eq : theta ] @xmath27 where    @xmath28 and @xmath29 denote the usual su(3 ) octet and singlet states .",

    "we obtain @xmath40 where the pseudoscalar and quark loop dependencies have been collected into the coefficients @xmath41 .",

    "the effective meson - quark couplings @xmath50 are shown in table [ tab : su3 ] . the parameters @xmath51 and @xmath52 , where @xmath53 mev , account for su(3 ) breaking in the @xmath28 and @xmath29 amplitudes @xcite .",

    "specifically , @xmath93 summing over the three neutrino families gives @xmath94 gev , or a branching ratio of @xmath9 .",
    "for @xmath0 , the relevant short - distance interaction is @xmath95 . to classify the lowest order diagrams , it is convenient to start with the graphs for @xmath96 .",
    "these were shown earlier in fig.[fig : loop ] . adding a photon to any charged line creates a graph for @xmath95 .",
    "provided the standard - model @xmath97 vertex is included , this method generates the full set of lowest order diagrams .",
    "the short - distance contributions thus naturally split into box ( fig .",
    "[ fig : box ] ) and effective @xmath80 type ( fig.[fig : dsz ] ) diagrams .",
    "each class further divides into one - particle irreducible and one - quark reducible processes .",
    "ma and okada @xcite only considered the leading contribution to the effective @xmath80 type diagrams : the one - particle irreducible graphs containing a single @xmath98 boson @xcite .",

    "their result was dominated by the graphs containing an intermediate @xmath102 quark .",
    "the heavier charm quark contributions were shown to be small .",
    "the analysis , however , did not take into account the possibility of an intermediate quark mass larger than the @xmath98 mass .    we have extended the ma and okada calculation to the case of three fermion families , and a large top quark mass . in the large mass approximation , the above amplitude would be modified by the factor @xmath103,\\ ] ] where @xmath104 . for @xmath105 gev @xcite",

    "thus ma and okada s conclusion that the effective @xmath80 diagrams are dominated by the lightest quark is still valid .",
    "ma and okada , however , did not consider the box diagram contributions .",
    "our expectation is that the major short - distance contributions in fact come from the one - quark reducible box diagrams in fig.[fig : box](b ) .    in order to later treat",
    "non - standard model effects , we approach the calculation in a relatively general manner . as indicated in fig.[fig : sd ] , we consider all one - quark reducible processes that can be viewed as a photon attached to some effective @xmath106 interaction .",

    "the resulting branching ratio is @xmath131 .",
    "since @xmath0 is highly suppressed in the standard model , observation of this decay at a higher rate would signal new physics .",
    "therefore , it is of interest to look at the predictions of extended models .",
    "one possibility is the contribution of flavor - changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) . here",
    "we consider the effects of neutral generation - changing gauge bosons and , in particular , we follow the general formalism adopted by cahn and harari @xcite .",
    "we have extended this formalism to three generations , as follows .",
    "the general group structure is taken to be @xmath132 , where @xmath133 acts within a generation and @xmath134 is a `` horizontal '' gauge group containing neutral generation - changing bosons .",
    "the group @xmath133 contains the standard electroweak algebra @xmath135 .",
    "the group @xmath134 is taken to be @xmath136 .",
    "we will further assume that the three horizontal gauge bosons are degenerate in mass .",
    "the basis of particle states is constructed as follows .",
    "let @xmath137 , @xmath138 and @xmath139 denote the `` primitive '' electron , muon , and tau . for the present , it is convenient to ignore the distinction between left and right components .",

    "thus presumably give rise to the following low - energy effective interaction @xmath150 where @xmath151 is the gauge coupling constant and @xmath152 is the mass of the gauge bosons .    for the decay @xmath0 , the relevant interactions in @xmath112 are those that connect the @xmath153 and @xmath154 triplets .",
    "these can be written as @xmath155 by making the replacement @xmath156 .",
    "furthermore , keeping just the terms involving the @xmath157 to @xmath158 quark transitions gives @xmath159 comparison of this expression with the general hamiltonian given in eq .",

    "( [ eq : sdrate ] ) can be used directly .",
    "note that the unitary mixing matrices do not contribute to the trace .",
    "the resulting @xmath99 rate is @xmath161 the neutral generation - changing bosons that we are considering also mediate the lepton - number violating processes @xmath162 and @xmath163 .",
    "the stringent experimental limits on these processes help to constrain the horizontal gauge boson couplings and mass . the process @xmath162 , however , is only sensitive to the axial - vector component of the quark currents .",
    "thus the semi - leptonic decay @xmath164 , which is sensitive to the vector component , is more convenient as a comparison process .",
    "the relevant quark - level process for @xmath165 is @xmath166 . repeating the steps for the @xmath167 interactions that were used for the @xmath168 interactions ,",
    "one finds that the appropriate term in the hamiltonian is @xmath169 where @xmath170 governs the mixing between lepton and down - type quark states .",
