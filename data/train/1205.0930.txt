    "after the paper by the opera collaboration ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) claiming an advance of the cngs neutrino beam from cern to gran - sasso of @xmath1 , strong excitement occurred around all possible general relativistic corrections that could account for such a strong effect , leaving a big anomaly on neutrino speed faster than the speed of light of @xmath2 .",
    "two main corrections are to be applied about this measurement : firstly the sagnac effect(@xcite ) ( not detailed here ) , which expresses the impact of the earth s rotation around its axis on time synchronization with atomic clocks using gps in common view mode , and secondly the general relativistic effect on the neutrino travel due to the presence of the mass of the planet earth .",
    "it is this second effect , that is deeply detailed here , with the implication of a non homogeneous distribution mass density inside the earth . while a simple non - rotating model with spherical symmetry with geophysics density data input , a first calculation is achieved , providing a @xmath3 delay effect .",
    "some second order effects are further taken into account such as the ellipticity of the earth , the effect of mountains and of geoid fluctuations , meanwhile the same delay effect of @xmath4 is computed . of course such an effect is far from being measured due to the timing resolution of the most uptodate technics of nowadays neutrino detection and also neutrino beam production with accelerators timing technics .",
    "previously kiritsis and nitti ( cf @xcite ) have calculated the general relativistic effect of neutrino travel between cern and gran - sasso , but they assumed a metric of a black hole or far from a mass supposed to be ponctual which is not the case here where neutrinos are going inside the earth .",
    "of course if this approximation is slighly wrong at the surface of the earth and on the crust , it is deeply wrong if the neutrino beam is crossing the earth from one side to the other ; with how modelization of density distribution inside earth , a delay effect of @xmath5 is to be expected for a full crossing along the earth diameter .",
    "the earth is assumed not to be rotating , so that a schwartschild metric is sufficient , while in theory a detailed calculation in the frame of a kerr metric would be needed , nevertheless , this effect is still extremly tiny .",
    "this effect can not account for any advance of the neutrino .",
    "recently the icarus experiment also carrying measurement on the cngs neutrino beam did not notice any discrepancy between the speed of neutrino and the speed of light ( cf @xcite ) .",
    "as we do not take into account the rotation of the earth and a spherically symmetric density model of the earth interior , we can use the schwartzchild metric to take into account general relativity as follows : + @xmath6 the schwartzchild metric can be easily rewriting using @xmath7 potential : @xmath8    @xmath7 is defined by : @xmath9 v is easily identified as the classical newtonian gravitational potential : + @xmath10 at this point , a remark must be made .",
    "if tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff equation ( tov ) is perfectly suited to describe the interior of a spherically symmetric isotropic interior of a neutron star in isostatic equilibrium between gravity and pressure with strong general relativistic effects with the input of equation of state ( eos ) of the nuclear matter , in the case of the earth the situation is slighlty different .",
    "the detailed atomic composition of the inner earth is a big unknown field and the knowledge of its interior ( density and pressure ) is mainly coming from the long standing experience of geophysicist modelling the seismic waves propagation through the interior of the earth .",
    "then the tov equation applied to the earth is directly short cut in this work and the density distribution from geophysics is directly plugged into the schwartzchild metric as an input .",
    "because of spherical symmetry hypothesis , the density inside the earth , varies only with r. while differential formulation of gauss s law for gravity is given by : @xmath11 the spherical symmetry implies for the expansion of the laplacian : @xmath12 the integral form is given by the gauss theorem : @xmath13 @xmath14 is defined as the earth s mass integrated between the center of the earth and radius @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath16 gravity acceleration is directly obtained through : @xmath17 the classical newtonian gravity potential is obtained without difficulty as follows .",
    "@xmath18    @xmath19    the second constant term @xmath20 and @xmath21 in the integral accounts for the prescription of a flat schwartzchild metric at an infinite distance r from the earth center , as the newtonian gravitational potential is plugged into schwartzchild metric through @xmath22 , in such a way that @xmath23 .",
    "since many years , geophysicists have been monitoring earthquakes and seismic waves propagation through the earth interior .",
    "two main kinds of seismic waves crossing the earth are observed , primary waves ( faster ) and secondary waves ( slower ) . beside the difference of speed of these two categories of waves ,",
    "p - waves are compressional waves , while s - waves are shear waves which do not propagate in liquids .",
    "the propagation of these waves inside the earth and their sophisticated diffraction processes at the interfaces between solid and liquid zone of the inner earth , inform seismologists about the nature of the phase of the matter and its density versus depth inside the earth .",
    "these two speeds can be calculated as follows : @xmath24 @xmath25 bulk modulus = @xmath26 + shear modulus @xmath27 + density = @xmath28 + a seismic parameter @xmath29 is obtained cancelling the shear modulus out of the primary and the secondary waves .",
    "@xmath30 moreover , assuming hydrostatic equilibrium and adiabatic exchanges , adams and williamson ( 1923 ) showed a relationship between this geophysic parameter @xmath31 , the density and the gravity acceleration at a distance r from the center of the earth : @xmath32 the numerical integration of the adams and willimason equation with @xmath29 gives the density ( see figure  [ fig : densityw ] ) .",
    "then we computed the gravity acceleration versus r ( see figure  [ fig : gravityw ] ) and afterward the newton gravitational potential inside earth and so the @xmath22 potential term of the schwartzchild metric inside the earth ( see figure  [ fig : potpremw ] ) .",
    "the @xmath29 input data are obtained with a modelization of the propagation of primary and secondary seismic waves for any depthes inside the earth in order to reproduce the observed seismic waves patterns measured by seismographs scattered all over the earth surface .",
    "each seismograph is recording a seismic wave train characteristic of the angle between its position and the epicenter of each earthquake under study , and also of the depth of the epicenter below the surface .",
    "nowadays , sophisticated models exist ( prem , pem , iasp91 ) after the first attempts by bullen ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) and others ( 1937 ) . while the most important part of the surface of the earth is covered by ocean ,",
    "a continental model premc does exist and we have used this model with a density of @xmath33 for the upper continental crust instead of @xmath34 for the ocean .",
    "we focused our attention on the preliminary earth reference model ( prem ) by dziewonski & anderson ( 1981 ) ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) which is highly sufficient for our purpose of integrating the density along the radius of the earth in order to obtain firstly the acceleration of the gravity , secondly the newtonian gravitational potential inside the earth and thirdly a spherically symmetric schwartzchild - like metric inside the earth ( cf .",

    "in the sixties , i. shapiro proposed a test of general relativity using the delay of radar bouncing over mercury and venus checking the relativistic effect due to the mass of the sun as the radar beam towar these planets was coming closed to the sun , this is known as time delay of radar echoes ( cf @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
