    "the scientific disciplines ( e.g.  biology , chemistry , physics ) once stood well separated from each other , with practitioners from each approaching different questions in different ways .",
    "these divisions are beginning to blur , however , as answers to questions from one field increasingly require techniques and knowledge built up in another .",
    "there is evidence of this effect in the increasing need for interdisciplinary collaborations to solve problems arising in distinct fields .",
    "a particularly poignant example of this blurring of lines is the field of molecular biology , where researchers try to build an understanding of biological systems starting at the molecular level .",
    "concepts from chemistry and physics arise naturally in such endeavors and this has bred a symbiotic relationship between biologists , chemists , and physicists , who now seek to answer similar questions.@xcite    some of the most important questions arising in this arena relate to the structure and function of biological macromolecules.@xcite for example , for rational drug design to be viable , a detailed knowledge of the interactions between a target protein and a potential drug molecule is necessary to understand whether the drug will bind to the protein at the right location and in the right way.@xcite from there , an atomic - level understanding of the protein itself is necessary to understand how allosteric effects turn a drug binding event into a change in the behavior of the protein.@xcite these details can not come from a _ top down _ investigation of the molecules , nor can they come from simply observing the changing behavior as a function of drug binding .",
    "part of the physics lies in the statistical mechanics of protein conformations , and part resides in the communication networks within the protein , the elucidation of which hinges on the detailed physics of the binding event and the transmission of information from the binding site to a possibly distant effector site .",
    "the same can be said of the `` holy grail '' of molecular biology  understanding protein folding and how the structure of a protein relates to its function .",
    "coarse - grained models provide some insight into the process of protein folding@xcite , but a true understanding of the process and the ability to reliably predict how a protein will fold requires an atomic - level understanding of the interactions within a particular protein .",
    "there are many other examples of the need for atomistic detail in molecular biology .",
    "ultimately , all properties of biological macromolecules  such as dna , rna , proteins  are governed by minute details involving the atomic and electronic structure of their constituent parts as well as the interactions between neighboring pieces of the molecule .",
    "even dynamic conformational changes that may be essential to a particular process are ultimately governed by these interactions and similar interactions with the surrounding environment .",
    "developing an atomic - level understanding of large molecular systems is not an easy task and , until recently , the application of accurate quantum mechanical methods to such systems was infeasible .",
    "this review highlights recent advances made in the fields of computational physics and physical chemistry that can aid in building such an understanding . after discussing classical simulations and common quantum - chemistry approaches",
    ", we focus specifically on advances within density functional theory ( dft)a framework used successfully for decades in the field of condensed matter physics  which affords unprecedented accuracy and utility in treating large , weakly bound molecular systems .",
    "these new methods will be discussed and paired with a survey of their use on biologically - relevant molecular systems .",
    "possible future applications of these methods will also be addressed .",
    "for many purposes , the best present - day methods to study biologically - relevant systems are classical force field models .",
    "such methods allow one to study the large - scale dynamics of systems with perhaps millions of atoms over biologically - relevant timescales.@xcite this is by far the most common computational method of study for macromolecules , and has provided indispensable insight into numerous biological systems .",
    "the main goal of a force field is simple ; to represent the energy and forces of a collection of atoms using a physically - motivated , yet relatively straight - forward , algebraic expression .",
    "this simplicity is what allows the simulation of large systems over significant timescales.@xcite generally , the physical motivation for terms in the energy hamiltonian come from macroscopic physics .",
    "for example , many force fields treat bond stretches and angle flexes as classical harmonic oscillators obeying hooke s law .",
    "this is , in fact , what is meant by the phrase _ classical _ force field .    in its most basic form",
    ", a typical force field can be written as a sum of separate contributions to the total energy,@xcite i.e.@xmath0     & = & \\sum_{b}{\\frac{1}{2}k_{b}(d_{b}-d_{0})^{2}}\\nonumber\\\\     & + & \\sum_{a}{\\frac{1}{2}k_{a}(\\theta_{a}-\\theta_{0})^{2}}\\nonumber\\\\     & + & \\sum_{d}{\\frac{1}{2}k_{d}\\big[1+\\cos(n\\phi-\\delta)\\big]}\\nonumber\\\\     & + & \\sum_{nb}{\\bigg[\\frac{q_{i}q_{j}}{r_{ij}}+     \\bigg(\\frac{c_{12}}{r_{ij}^{12}}-     \\frac{c_{6}}{r_{ij}^{6}}\\bigg)\\bigg]}\\;.\\label{e_ff}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first term on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ e_ff ] ) represents an harmonic oscillator ( with spring constant @xmath1 ) in bond length between each pair of covalently - bonded atoms within the system .",
    "the second does the same for the three - atom angle term .",
    "dihedral angles are treated with a fairly shallow periodic potential , represented by the third term .",
    "the last line of eq .",
    "( [ e_ff ] ) represents non - bonded interactions and includes a coulomb term for charge - charge interactions and a lennard - jones ( 612 ) potential to account for van der waals type interactions .",
    "some force fields add additional terms for out - of - plane motions ( improper dihedrals ) or higher - order terms.@xcite variations on the functional form are also sometimes applied .",
    "for example , a morse potential can be used in place of the harmonic bond term to allow for bond breaking during a simulation.@xcite    for all their usefulness , so called `` class i '' force field approaches suffer from some drawbacks .",
    "first , treating microscopic phenomena using macroscopic theory is , in essence , a mean - field approach .",
    "the quantum - mechanical interactions between electron clouds are averaged over .",
    "this , along with the assumed form for all physical interactions , does not allow new physics to be uncovered .",
    "the only physics present in the simulation is what was explicitly included , meaning one can not gain any true atomic - level insight into the underpinnings of interesting phenomena .",
    "second , the simplicity of the mean - field approach used in force field simulations means that they are generally incapable of transferably achieving chemical accuracy.@xcite while bulk motions and general trends can often be gleaned from such simulations , the precise movements and behavior of atoms are probably not accurate .",
    "this poses a significant problem for applications such as drug design , where one seeks to find a small molecule ( an enzyme inhibitor perhaps ) that binds with a certain affinity to a site in the protein .",
    "biophysicists and biochemists have already made substantial headway against this problem.@xcite originally , force fields included the partial charge on an atom as a fitting parameter .",
    "the charge was assumed fixed during the simulation so effects of polarization could not be treated .",
    "the next generation of force fields incorporates the ability of charge to rearrange during a simulation .",
    "polarizable _ force fields incorporate some of the quantum effects necessary to accurately model molecular systems .",
    "one example of this new type of force field is the amoeba force field , which includes both static and dynamic polarizabilities and represents a significant step towards accurate energetics from a force field.@xcite in addition , newer force fields often include cross - terms that account for how changes in one internal coordinate affect other energy terms .",
    "these help improve accuracy and transferability but can not correct for the lack of an explicit quantum mechanical treatment .",
    "the obvious solution to the shortcomings of the classical force field methods is to directly include quantum mechanics in calculations .",
    "therefore , the solution to the problem is straight - forward ; one simply has to solve the time - independent schrdinger equation @xmath2 where the hamiltonian @xmath3 in atomic units is given by @xmath4 here , lower - case letters represent electronic degrees - of - freedom , upper - case letters represent nuclear degrees - of - freedom ( including charge z ) , @xmath5 is the energy of the system , and the explicit representation of the hamiltonian @xmath3 follows from specialization to an isolated system of atoms under the born - oppenheimer approximation .",
    "the unknown function @xmath6 is the wave function for the electrons and from it ( along with knowledge of the nuclear positions @xmath7 ) one can calculate all accessible properties of the system . unfortunately",
    ", @xmath6 depends on the coordinates of all electrons within the system and , as a result , direct solution of eq .",
    "( [ schrodinger ] ) for the full many - body wave function is difficult or impossible for all but the most trivial systems .",
    "for example , a single neutral water molecule has 10 electrons , so its wave function is a function of @xmath8 variables ( i.e.  10 electron positions in three dimensions ) . while an analytical solution in this simple case is already not possible , it is conceivable that the schrdinger equation could be solved numerically .",
    "however , to store the wave function on a numerical grid consisting of 10 points in each dimension ( a laughably coarse grid ) using single precision numerics would take @xmath9 bytes ( approximately @xmath10 tb ) of storage .",
    "this is `` the curse of dimensionality '' on a grand scale and renders full solution of the schrdinger equation for most systems utterly intractable .",
    "surmounting this fundamental problem in a physical way is not easy and has consumed the efforts of chemists and physicists alike for decades . from those efforts , however ,",
    "have sprung a number of useful approaches .",
    "these can be split into two categories , wave function theories and density functional theory , both of which we will discuss in detail below .",
    "all the methods described in what follows have exhibited great success in describing various quantum - mechanical properties of molecules and materials in general . however , when dealing with biologically - relevant systems two special considerations arise : ( i ) such systems are typically quite _ large _ and ( ii ) their structure and binding is often dominated by weak _",
    "van der waals _ interactions .",
    "since this review is focused on biological applications of quantum - mechanical methods , special attention will be paid to the ability of each method to scale well with system size and to adequately describe van der waals interactions . as such",
    ", the ability of a method to treat large systems involving van der waals interactions will determine its applicability to the biologically - relevant systems considered here .",
    "a simple solution to the dimensionality problem introduced by eq .  ( [ schrodinger ] ) is to seek solutions of the form @xmath11 that is , to assume that the total electron wave function can be separated and written as a product of single - electron states ( orbitals ) @xmath12 .",
    "the pauli - exclusion principle and the anti - symmetry of the wave function can be enforced by forming a slater determinant of the single - particle solutions .",
    "since the fock operator used to find the orbitals depends explicitly on those orbitals , the resulting equations are generally solved self - consistently .",
    "this approach is a form of mean - field theory where each electron responds to the average field created by all other electrons residing in their single - particle orbitals .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that each orbital is now a function of the three spatial coordinates , making numerical calculations computationally feasible .",
    "wave function methods are described in detail in ref .  .",
    "the hartree - fock ( hf ) method , which takes this approach , is relatively fast and based on sound quantum mechanics , but the approximations invoked by its use miss some crucial physics .",
    "in particular , electrons are dynamic entities .",
    "the total energy of the system can be lowered if , averaged over some degree - of - freedom , the electrons correlate their behavior .",
    "correlation is ( almost ) completely missed in the hartree - fock method , which explicitly assumes single - particle states  the static correlation due to the pauli exclusion principle is fully accounted for .",
    "nevertheless , hf theory is a good first - order starting point for corrections that incorporate electron correlation into the total wave function and its associated energy .",
    "such methods are termed post - hf methods , since they use the results of a hf calculation as a starting point to incorporate electron correlation explicitly .",
    "there are many post - hf methods that exhibit various accuracies coming at related computational costs .",
    "one of the best features of the wave function methods is their segregation into a hierarchy of so called `` levels of theory '' .",
    "thus , one knows in some sense , to what degree a result can be trusted , depending on the precise method used .",
    "if better results are desired , one merely has to progress to a higher level of theory .",
    "basis sets ( the set of functions used to expand the wave functions ) are also of critical importance .",
    "they too , however , exhibit a hierarchy of complexity and applicability .",
    "figure  [ fig_hf ] gives a cartoon depiction of how one can approach the numerically exact solution @xmath13 by combining a large basis set with a high level of theory .",
    "the most rigorous method to include electron correlation is full configuration interaction ( ci ) . in the ci method ,",
    "one starts as usual with the orbitals found by a hartree - fock calculation .",
    "instead of using a single slater determinant of these functions , however , a linear combination of slater determinants is formed , each one corresponding to one possible ordering of electrons in the orbitals . in other words ,",
    "all possible combinations of electron excitations are given a slater determinant , and the optimized linear combination of these yields the numerically exact wave function .",
    "this renders full ci a combinatorial problem  taking a given number of electrons and producing all possible excitations to a given set of orbitals .",
    "thus , full ci scales factorially with the number of basis functions used and therefore is not practical in all but the smallest of systems .",
    "perhaps the next best thing to a full ci calculation is to use coupled cluster theory .",
    "the coupled cluster approach mimics ci but using only small numbers of electron excitations , usually considering only excitations of one to three electrons .",
    "the most common variant of coupled - cluster theory is notated ccsd(t ) , which includes single and double excitations iteratively , and triple excitations perturbatively .",
    "this has proven incredibly reliable and represents the `` gold standard '' for accurate quantum - chemistry calculations .",
    "although it has polynomial ( rather than factorial ) scaling in the number of basis functions used , the asymptotic scaling of @xmath14 for the generally used form renders this approach mainly useful on relatively small systems of perhaps 3050 atoms .    among the most used post - hf methods",
    "is mller - plesset perturbation theory at second order ( mp2 ) or higher order ( mp3 , mp4 ,  ) . in perturbation theory ,",
    "one seeks to find the solution of @xmath15 { \\left|\\psi\\right>}=e{\\left|\\psi\\right>}\\,,\\label{perturbation}\\ ] ] where the perturbation strength factor @xmath16 is assumed small , and the solution to the unpertured problem ( @xmath17 ) is already known . in this case",
    ", @xmath3 is the non - interacting hartree - fock hamiltonian and @xmath18 , which is assumed to be small in effect relative to @xmath19 , is the hamiltonian for inclusion of electron correlation .",
    "mp2 expands this expression in terms of powers of @xmath16 up to second order .",
    "this can be used to correct both energies and wave functions .",
    "mp2 has shown great success , but it is not perfect",
    ". comparison with coupled cluster and full ci methods have shown that mp2 often significantly overestimates the correlation , especially in delocalized @xmath20 systems.@xcite usage of the higher - order expansions ( e.g. mp4 ) may yield increased accuracy , but the results are not as straightforward as one might hope , as convergence of the mller - plesset series has been shown to be unreliable.@xcite in many cases , estimates of correlation may get worse with increasing order ; sometimes oscillating or even diverging in the worst cases.@xcite convergence depends on both the system under study and the basis set being employed , with poor results often accompanying use of the diffuse functions required to correctly model dispersion interactions .",
    "nevertheless , mp methods are highly prized in quantum - chemistry wave function calculations because they contain a good balance of accuracy and computational efficiency .",
    "the asymptotic scaling of mp2 ( as @xmath21 ) makes it substantially cheaper than high - level coupled cluster methods .",
    "mp2 can be used on systems of respectable size .",
    "a system with a hundred atoms or more is not out of the reach of an mp2 calculation on a high - end computer .",
    "wave function theories have a number of nice properties , but they scale poorly with systems size .",
    "a completely different approach , density functional theory ( dft ) , scales as @xmath22 , and is therefore much more amenable to calculation of large systems .",
    "calculations can be performed on systems consisting of perhaps several thousand atoms , making it applicable to biochemical systems .    in 1964",
    "hohenberg and kohn@xcite published a seminal paper showing that the quantum - mechanical energy of a set of atoms can be written uniquely as a functional of the electron charge density ( within the born - oppenheimer approximation ) .",
    "furthermore , the charge density @xmath23 that minimizes this functional is the ground - state charge density for the system , and all measurable properties of the system can be written in terms of this optimal charge density .",
    "this avoids the dimensionality problem of eq .",
    "( [ schrodinger ] ) by shifting the quantity of interest to the charge density in real space , a function of only three variables regardless of the number of electrons .",
    "density functional theory as a modern approach was initiated when kohn and sham@xcite wrote the energy as a density functional of the form @xmath24 } & = & e_{{\\text{k}}}{[n(\\vec{r}\\,)]}+e_{{\\text{n - e}}}{[n(\\vec{r}\\,)]}+e_{{\\text{e - e}}}{[n(\\vec{r}\\,)]}\\nonumber\\\\ & + & e_{{\\text{xc}}}{[n(\\vec{r}\\,)]}+e_{{\\text{n - n}}}\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the total kinetic energy of the system , in principle written as a density functional , but in practice written as a functional of the kohn - sham orbitals .",
    "an analytical density functional for @xmath25 is not known , but approximations to it lead to so called orbital - free methods . the final term in eq .",
    "( [ dft ] ) is the nucleus - nucleus repulsion term , which can be treated as a simple additive constant since it is uniquely determined by the positions of the nuclei and these are decoupled from the quantum - mechanical problem by use of the born - oppenheimer approximation .",
    "analytical expressions are known for both @xmath26 ( the nucleus - electron , effective 1-body term ) and @xmath27 ( the hartree term giving the average electron - electron interaction ) , leaving the _ exchange - correlation _ functional @xmath28}$ ] as the sole unknown object in eq .",
    "( [ dft ] ) .",
    "if the exchange - correlation functional and its _ functional _ derivative with respect to the density were known , they could be used to optimize the total energy functional ( @xmath29}$ ] ) with respect to the density , thereby finding the ground - state density . since ,",
    "@xmath30 is not known however , it must be approximated in some way .",
    "this is the main approximation in dft and determines the method s applicability to a particular system .",
    "not surprisingly then , much effort is put into improving the approximations made in generating @xmath28}$ ] .",
    "one approach is to assume that the exchange - correlation energy is a _ local _ functional of the density  one that depends on @xmath31 in a point - wise fashion.@xcite this local density approximation ( lda ) is good when the density is slowly varying , becoming exact in the limit of a uniform electron density .    despite its simplicity , the lda is amazingly good in many systems , especially in those with relatively concentrated charge density such as crystalline environments where metallic or covalent bonding dominates . for molecules , where directional covalent bonds are the primary interaction , it tends to perform less adequately .",
    "one can imagine the lda as the zeroth - order term in the taylor expansion of the density about each point , and envision adding additional , derivative - dependent terms .",
    "a functional depending on the density and its gradient ( first derivative ) in a point - wise fashion is called a semi - local functional , and the approximation of the true energy functional in this way is called the generalized gradient approximation ( gga).@xcite this approximation is a substantial improvement over lda in many systems , particularly molecules .    the @xmath30 term in eq .",
    "( [ dft ] ) must approximate the effects of both exchange , which removes the unphysical electron self interaction while enforcing the pauli exclusion principle , and correlation , which roughly speaking , accounts for the fact that each electron experiences a highly dynamic environment rather than a _",
    "mean field _ of the other electrons .",
    "in hartree - fock theory , the form of the exchange operator is known , so exchange could be treated exactly and combined with an approximate correlation functional .",
    "unfortunately , most functionals exhibit serendipitous error cancellations between their exchange and correlation pieces , making just using the correlation contribution prone to large errors . in 1993",
    "becke proposed using a 50%50% mix of exact exchange and lda,@xcite eventually leading to the 3-parameter b3lyp functional@xcite and similar hybrid functionals , which are among the most accurate functionals for covalently - bound molecules .",
    "early successes of hybrid functionals led some to erroneously believe that they could describe weak van der waals interactions . unfortunately ,",
    "hybrid functionals , being a linear combination of exact exchange and ( semi)-local exchange - correlation approximations , can not account for van der waals interactions .",
    "this is because van der waals interactions are a non - local correlation effect , and any functional that is local or semi - local in correlation is  by construction  not able to reliably describe them.@xcite there is ample discussion in the literature of the poor performance of standard hybrid functionals in weakly bound complexes.@xcite      as evident from the discussion in section  [ sec : dft ] and fig .",
    "[ scaling ] , dft is capable of treating large systems of perhaps thousands of atoms , which is one of the requirements if it is to be applicable to systems of interest in molecular biology .",
    "however , at the same time , it also has to be able to accurately describe weak van der waals interactions , which play an important role in biomolecules .",
    "historically , dft has not performed well when applied to systems with van der waals interactions  this is probably the single most important problem that has prevented dft from gaining a strong foothold in molecular biology .",
    "below we discuss the shortcomings of standard dft and several recent developments that overcome this barrier , leading to a full applicability of dft to large biomolecules .    in standard dft , the exchange - correlation functional",
    "is often assumed to be _ local _ ,",
    "i.e.  a single spacial integral of the exchange - correlation energy density , which depends explicitly on the charge - density .",
    "this approach leads to the so called local density approximation ( lda ) . adding a dependence on the gradient of the charge density results in the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) , while inclusion of higher - order derivative terms yield meta - gga functionals . however , this approach fails to correctly account for van der waals ( vdw ) interactions , which are non - local correlation effects ; they occur between physically separated regions of charge , generally with little overlap of their density functions . capturing these effects",
    "correctly requires a functional that expresses the exchange - correlation energy as ( at minimum ) a double spacial integral .",
    "van der waals interactions , ubiquitous in polyatomic systems , occur when electron motions in one atom ( or within one molecule ) correlate with electron motions in a nearby atom ( or molecule ) setting up transient but interacting multipoles within each.@xcite correlation between electrons lowers their energy relative to uncorrelated electrons , so the van der waals force is always attractive",
    ". in some systems , crystalline nacl for example , the contribution of these interactions to the overall binding are negligible . in other systems",
    "these interactions can be an appreciable part of the overall interaction .",
    "nobel gas dimers such as ar@xmath32 and kr@xmath32 are held together entirely by van der waals interactions .",
    "large diffuse molecular systems ( prime examples being biological macromolecules ) rely quite heavily on van der waals interactions for their stability , so such interactions play an integral role in their behavior .    with this in mind , numerous attempts were made to include the ability to capture van der waals interactions within conventional dft .",
    "a thorough account of all these efforts is beyond the scope of the present review , but several promising approaches will be discussed .      as stated earlier ,",
    "van der waals interactions arise when electronic motions within separated atoms correlate , setting up transient multipole moments within the individual atoms .",
    "one can expand the dispersion energy of two arbitrary , polarizable charge densities in terms of the interactions of induced multipoles .",
    "if a point of interest is located at a distance @xmath33 that is large compared to some characteristic length scale of the charge distribution , the _ pairwise _ dispersion energy can be expanded in powers of @xmath34 as@xcite @xmath35 where the constants @xmath36 correspond to a particular system and determine the relative strengths of the various terms .    for sufficiently large distances",
    "@xmath33 , the dipole - dipole term dominates and dispersion interactions go as 1/@xmath37 .",
    "this observation is the basis of the density functional theory with added dispersion ( dft - d ) method.@xcite typically , this method works by adding to the total energy a pairwise atomic correction of the form @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the dispersion energy , @xmath40 is an empirically - derived coefficient that is atom - pair - dependent , @xmath41 is a damping function , and the sum runs over all pairs of atoms .",
    "the damping function ranges from 0 at small @xmath42 to 1 for larger separations , and is required because the asymptotic 1/@xmath43 form becomes unphysical as distances become small .",
    "the specific form of the damping function plays a role in the accuracy of the technique.@xcite too weak a damping with decreasing distance results in over - counting of the interaction energy . too strong",
    "a damping will weaken the vdw interactions at relevant ranges .",
    "the most critical aspect of the damping function is how it behaves at intermediate distances near the bonding length of a vdw bond .",
    "much attention has been paid to the form of the damping function , and opinions differ on its optimal form .",
    "commonly , the damping function is given the form@xcite @xmath44 where @xmath45 is a chosen constant and @xmath46 sets the relevant distance scale for the interaction of atoms @xmath47 and @xmath48 and is generally chosen to be the sum of their van der waals radii . this was the form chosen by grimme in 2004@xcite , when he published a set of @xmath49 coefficients based on a database of dipole oscillator strength distributions , for a number of important atoms and demonstrated the method s effectiveness on a large set of molecular systems .",
    "the values of the @xmath49 coefficients ( and corresponding vdw - radii ) depend somewhat on the choice of exchange - correlation functional , so grimme added an empirical parameter he called @xmath50 that scales the interaction , adjusting its strength to the functional being used .",
    "approaches like the dft - d method are not new , dating back at least as far as london himself@xcite , but they have proved extremely useful at many levels of atomic theory , and continue to be so within dft .",
    "the pairwise dispersion correction given by eq .",
    "( [ dftd ] ) is not a density - functional , but instead relies on fitting to a chosen set of external data .",
    "the data used in the fit and the interaction between the dispersion correction and the functional coupled with it both affect the results obtained .",
    "such a fitting procedure can limit transferability between systems .",
    "the original dft - d approach of grimme has been re - parameterized many times both for improved accuracy and for application to other systems.@xcite    to improve on the transferability and overall accuracy of dft - d , tkatchenko and scheffler proposed an alteration , which uses a relative @xmath49 coefficient calculated on - the - fly from the charge density.@xcite in this approach ( hereafter referred to as dft+vdw ) they define the effective volume for an atom @xmath51 within a system , relative to the free - atom volume as : @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the fraction of the density at @xmath54 arising from atom @xmath51 in a linear combination of free - atom charge densities .",
    "starting from the free - atom coefficients @xmath55 , they define the effective coefficient for an atom within a molecule or solid as @xmath56 with the hetero - nuclear combination rule for atoms @xmath51 and @xmath57 defined as : @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the static polarizability of atom @xmath60 .",
    "thus , in the dft+vdw approach one may write @xmath61=-\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i\\ne j } \\frac{c_{6}^{ij}[n(\\vec{r}\\,)]}{r_{ij}^{6}}\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath47 and @xmath48 ranging over all atoms .",
    "that is , the dispersion energy can be written as a functional ( albeit a non - universal one that depends on the arrangement of nuclei ) of the charge density .",
    "writing the @xmath49 coefficients as density functionals allows for the polarizability of atoms to be a dynamic , environment - dependent quantity . if it could be calculated , the functional derivative of this expression with respect to the charge density would yield the kohn - sham potential for the dispersion energy , allowing the latter to be calculated self - consistently .",
    "it is not clear at present whether this would significantly affect the interaction energies of vdw compounds when using the dft+vdw method .",
    "tkatchenko and scheffler do note , however , that the use of eq .",
    "( [ veff ] ) largely cancels the charge density differences arising from the use of different functionals , making their method less sensitive to the particular exchange - correlation functional used compared with static @xmath62 approaches.@xcite    in 2008 , tkatchenko and von lilienfeld noted that many body effects can play a significant role in the energetics of vdw - rich systems.@xcite this is especially true in bulk , where close - packed atoms can be geometrically arranged in many complex ways .",
    "in particular , three - body , triple - dipole interactions can contribute substantially to binding energies , typically raising them relative to pure pairwise interactions .",
    "given the recent surge of inquiry into metal organic frameworks and other molecular crystals,@xcite the ability to account for this fact may become of increasing interest . in 2010 , an expanded version of dft+vdw was described , wherein an additional three - body term was added.@xcite the three - body term was given the form @xmath63 where @xmath42 is the distance between atoms @xmath47 and @xmath48 and @xmath64 is the angle between @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "the formulation of this expression into a density functional then follows in a fashion similar to that of the @xmath49 term , the fundamental difference being the inclusion of an angular dependence in the damping function .",
    "an alternative approach to the addition of pairwise atomic dispersion terms is to express the total energy of a system directly as a _ non - local _ functional of the density .",
    "that is , to write the exchange - correlation functional in such a way that it depends simultaneously on the charge density at multiple points . in principle",
    ", this is the optimal approach because the true exchange - correlation functional is _ fundamentally _ a non - local functional .",
    "treating it on such a footing allows for its integration into dft in a seamless and self - consistent manner .    in the van der waals density",

    "the kernel function @xmath70 describes how charge densities at @xmath71 and @xmath72 correlate .",
    "a meaningful form for @xmath70 was described by dion et al . in 2004 , leading to the van der waals density functional ( vdw - df).@xcite this functional evolved from a less general one restricted to planar geometries.@xcite the analytical form of @xmath70 and its numerical computation are onerous , but since @xmath70 itself does not depend on the density , it can be calculated and tabulated once - and - for - all .",

    "( [ nl ] ) with respect to the charge density was given in 2007,@xcite allowing for completely self - consistent calculation of energies and forces using this method .",
    "the functional as originally proposed required the evaluation of a double integral over three - dimensional space , as one might expect from a non - local functional .",
    "this made the use of the functional costly relative to other local or semi - local options .",
    "however , in 2009 romn - prez and soler effected a great simplification , by transforming the double integral into a single integral over fourier transforms using the convolution theorem.@xcite since fourier transforms are efficiently obtained and/or readily available in plane - wave dft codes , this dropped dramatically the time required to evaluate the vdw - df functional and made the cost of its use on par with that of a similar gga calculation .",
    "it was quickly noted that , when used on vdw - rich systems , the functional produced binding distances that were slightly larger compared with experiment or high - level calculations.@xcite this led to the assertion that the revised perdew - burke - ernzerhoff exchange functional,@xcite originally chosen to accompany the vdw - df because it exhibited minimal spurious binding of its own , was too repulsive.@xcite lee et al . revised the approach in 2010 , recommending the use of a less repulsive revised version of the perdew - wang@xcite exchange functional and changing the value of a gradient coefficient.@xcite these small changes improved the method s accuracy for both energy and geometry in many systems . for an in - depth review of this approach see ref .  .",
    "there are a number of other approaches that are capable of describing van der waals interactions within a dft framework .",
    "a full listing is beyond the scope of this review , but several of the more common approaches are briefly discussed here .    in symmetry",
    "adapted perturbation theory ( sapt ) , the interaction energy of a system is written as a perturbative expansion in terms of physically - meaningful interactions .",
    "the hamiltonian for a superposition of non - interacting monomers is taken as @xmath3@xmath73 , with the interaction between monomers forming the perturbing potential.@xcite terms in the perturbation generally include electrostatic , exchange , induction , and dispersion interactions.@xcite the principle advantage of this approach is that the relative contributions from different physical interactions can be determined explicitly .",
    "this leads to an intuitive interpretation of the interaction energy .",
    "the downside to the approach is its computational cost since the method scales as @xmath74 ( when taken to second order ) with increasing system size.@xcite it is therefore limited to relatively small systems .",
    "see ref .   for an excellent overview of sapt and its applications .",
    "zhao and truhlar have developed a series of functionals designed to obtain accurate energies for weakly - bound systems.@xcite these functionals have been shown to work well for the @xmath20-stacking and hydrogen bonding interactions that are omnipresent in biological macromolecules.@xcite the advantage of these functionals is their efficiency , being essentially the same computational cost as a typical dft calculation .",
    "there are several families of these functionals , designed and parameterized to apply to different chemical situations .",
    "the functionals are known to poorly describe dispersion interactions in the asymptotic limit , where they decay exponentially rather than as @xmath75.@xcite nevertheless , they have seen heavy use recently for their ability to accurately and efficiently capture the short - ranged contributions to dispersion interactions .    in the dispersion - corrected atom - centered potential ( dcacp )",
    "approach of von lilienfeld et al.@xcite , van der waals interactions are handled by means of an effective electron - core interaction .",
    "typical plane - wave density functional theory approaches utilize pseudopotentials , which treat nuclei and core electrons together as an effective , angular momentum - dependent potential .",
    "the potential is designed such that the all - electron wave - function is reproduced faithfully . in the dcacp approach ,",
    "the non - local piece of this effective core potential is optimized to reproduce high - level calculations of molecular properties , specifically , the dispersion energies and forces within molecules .",
    "since the dcacp method uses the same type of effective core potential that is traditionally used in plane - wave calculations , its use does not impose additional computational complexity .",
    "the effective potential is designed as a van der waals correction to standard gradient - corrected exchange - correlation functionals , so potentials must be optimized for each type of atom and for every exchange - correlation functional that the method is to be paired with .",
    "optimized effective potentials have been generated for all the standard biological atoms ( carbon@xcite , nitrogen@xcite , oxygen@xcite , hydrogen@xcite , sulfur@xcite , and phosphorus@xcite ) , each with several gradient - corrected functionals .",
    "the method shows good transferability and has been used in molecular@xcite as well as solid - state applications@xcite .",
    "although van der waals interactions are generally thought of as a _ correlation _ effect , the approach of becke and johnson takes a wholly different viewpoint , treating them instead as arising from interactions between an electron - exchange hole pair in one system and an induced dipole in another@xcite .",
    "this viewpoint is motivated by the fact that the exchange hole is , in general , not spherically symmetric , so the electron - exchange hole system has a non - zero dipole moment .",
    "this dipole moment does not affect the energy of the system containing the electron - exchange hole pair since only the spherical average of the exchange hole enters the energy expression for a system .",
    "this electron - hole dipole can correlate with a separate system , however , yielding a dispersion - like interaction . when averaged over the entirety of a system , the approach yields molecular @xmath76 coefficients in good agreement with those from high - level methods@xcite .",
    "these can be decomposed into atomic @xmath76 coefficients and used in a scheme similar to that in the dft - d approach@xcite .",
    "a required component of the approach is the dipole moment of the exchange hole , which becke and johnson conveniently cast as a meta - gga functional by utilizing the approximate becke - roussel form for the exchange hole@xcite .",
    "further development led to the ability to calculate @xmath77 and @xmath78 coefficients@xcite .",
    "this approach is simple , elegant , and performs well over a variety of systems .",
    "as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ scaling ] , of all the quantum mechanical methods discussed above , only dft is currently capable of treating systems consisting of several hundred to several thousand atomsi.e.the lower end of the range of biologically relevant molecules . as such ,",
    "in this application section we will almost exclusively focus on studies that have used dft to investigate such systems .",
    "the methods outlined above represent current state - of - the - art dft as it applies to vdw - rich systems . in",
    "what follows , these methods ability to do useful biochemistry will be highlighted through a brief survey of recent studies conducted both to test them and to learn from them .",
    "_ this survey is intended to act as a showcase of the capabilities of modern dft , rather than a comparison of particular methods of its implementation .",
    "_      small molecules make a natural proving ground for new methods in dft because calculations can be compared with quantum chemistry methods .",
    "there exists an extensive body of work , much of it carried out by poner and hobza@xcite and , independently , by stefan grimme@xcite , benchmarking the dft methods discussed above against accurate wave function approaches with special focus being placed on biologically - relevant molecular systems .",
    "this work has yielded encouraging results and forms the foundation upon which studies of the physics in these systems rests .",
    "but studying small molecules is useful in its own right , since these play a pivotal role in biochemistry .",
    "most notable among the biologically - relevant small molecules are water and the building blocks of macromolecules themselves , namely , dna bases and amino acids .",
    "water has received special attention in the literature , both because of its great importance to ( bio)chemistry and because an accurate first - principles understanding of it has proven surprisingly elusive .",
    "most molecular interactions within living systems occur in an aqueous environment , so an understanding of water is a necessary precursor to developing an understanding of _ in vivo _ biochemistry .    these days , the bulk behavior of water ( e.g.  phase diagram , radial distribution functions ) is well modeled by parameterized force fields.@xcite although these force fields get many of the properties of water correct compared with experiment , the fact that they were parameterized to do just that limits their usefulness as a tool for understanding the atomistic interactions in water . at the fundamental level",
    "there are quantum effects , most notably the quantum - mechanical nature of the hydrogen nuclei,@xcite that can not be easily reproduced with classical models .",
    "this clouds the connection between microscopic effects and bulk behavior .",
    "a full understanding of the behavior of water can only come from a quantum mechanical description that applies at the microscopic level , but can be extended up to the macroscopic limit .",
    "the behavior of small water clusters ( h@xmath32o)@xmath79 with @xmath80 less than about 6 has been extensively studied at the quantum level and is largely understood.@xcite minimum energy geometries can be calculated with high level wave function methods and these have been compared with various dft treatments . at this level ,",
    "standard dft does a reasonable job at describing the geometric and energetic properties of water , but some improvement can be made by including dispersion interactions.@xcite although the hydrogen bonds that govern water s structure are not typically thought of as a van der waals effect , recent studies have shown that geometries , energies , dipole moments , and vibrational frequencies of small water clusters are all improved by inclusion of van der waals interactions,@xcite as can be seen in figs .",
    "[ flo : water_properties_1 ] and [ flo : water_properties_2 ] .",
    "the improved description of water when van der waals effects are included is not limited to small water clusters , but continues into the bulk@xcite . through a series of _ ab initio _ molecular dynamics simulations lin et al.@xcite showed that the radial distribution functions produced by standard gradient - corrected functionals tend to produce water that is over - structured compared with experiment",
    "this was also evident in the average number of hydrogen bonds and the self - diffusion coefficient , both of which show an over - structuring of the water molecules .",
    "these results mirror obtained by numerous other groups working with a variety of different codes , exchange - correlation functionals , and basis sets@xcite this over - structuring is mitigated to a large degree by a proper treatment of van der waals interactions .",
    "the self diffusion coefficient increases three - fold and the over - structuring evident in the radial distribution functions softens when van der waals interactions are included .",
    "this is also true for bulk ice in its standard hexagonal form ( i@xmath81 ) where inclusion of van der waals interactions again improves the description of structural and electronic properties .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the results of dft calculations can vary quite widely depending on the choice of basis set and exchange - correlation functional used , and great care must be taken with their selection .",
    "for example , when coupled to the non - local piece of the vdw - df , the overly repulsive revised pbe exchange functional actually produces water that is _ under - structured _ compared with experiment , in contrast to most other exchange functionals .",
    "this is related to the aforementioned tendency of the original vdw - df to predict intermolecular interaction distances that are large compared with experiment and high - level wave - function methods .",
    "additionally , it has been pointed out that the properties of liquid water calculated within dft can depend quite strongly on the choice of basis set.@xcite calculations similar to those shown in fig .",
    "[ flo : water_properties_2 ] were carried out by zhang et al . and showed considerably less improvement in the oxygen - oxygen radial distribution function compared to experiment@xcite .",
    "the basis sets used in the two sets of calculations were fundamentally different , making a direct comparison of their appropriateness difficult . despite these issues , it is generally agreed that , when properly chosen basis sets and exchange - correlation functionals are used , the inclusion of van der waals interactions fundamentally improves the dft description of water , both at the microscopic level and in bulk .",
    "it is interesting to note that , although inclusion of van der waals interactions greatly improves the description of water , this alone does not complete the picture of important effects within water .",
    "the standard born - oppenheimer approximation used in quantum - mechanical studies treats all nuclei as classical point particles .",
    "recent work by a number of groups , however , has shown that nuclear quantum effects may play a significant role in determining the properties of water@xcite .",
    "in fact , it has been shown that such nuclear quantum effects may be more far - reaching , playing a substantial role in hydrogen bonds in general , not just between water molecules@xcite .",
    "this would , of course , have enormous consequences for a proper description of interactions within biological molecules such as proteins and dna , where hydrogen bonds often dominate the binding .",
    "for example , it has been proposed@xcite that the keto form of dna nucleobases ( the standard form required for watson - crick hydrogen bonding ) can spontaneously tautomerize via hydrogen tunneling to the enol form , a process which could be responsible for some types of dna damage . a recent study by prez et al .",
    "found that , although such tunneling does occur , the metastable enol form has a lifetime too short to play a significant role in dna mismatch damage@xcite .",
    "in fact , the effects of quantum nuclei appear to dynamically stabilize the keto form .",
    "for a recent review of these considerations see ref . .",
    "the four nucleobases , arranged in different sequences along strands of a sugar - phosphate polymer , have enabled the information of life to be stored and propagated since life began .",
    "each of these relatively simple molecules contains an aromatic ring capable of engaging in multiple hydrogen bonds .",
    "when these bases come together in a watson - crick , _ edge - on _ manner , they can form hydrogen bonds strong enough to hold two dna strands together . when brought together in a parallel _ face - on",
    "_ fashion , they form @xmath20@xmath20 stacking interactions strong enough to give it an average persistence length of roughly 50 nm with some sequences having even larger persistence lengths@xcite .",
    "+     cooper , thonhauser , and langreth calculated the base interaction energy as a function of distance for a watson - crick , _ edge - on _ approach of two base pairs ( see fig .  [ fig_h - bond]).@xcite this was done for the a : t , a : u , and g : c combinations .",
    "the g : c base pair exhibits a maximum interaction energy of about twice that of the other pairs , not surprising since it has an extra hydrogen bond , and all three show similar equilibrium binding distances .    the base stacking energy as a function of geometry has been studied by several groups.@xcite the binding energies as a function of twist angle for all possible stacked base pairs are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_stacking ] .",
    "it is noted that the methyl substitution that differentiates thymine from uracil stabilizes the systems with respect to twist .    in 2006 , jurecka et al . published a set of accurate ,",
    "quantum - chemical binding energies of 22 molecular dimers , selected for the importance of van der waals interactions within them.@xcite the set ( dubbed the s22 dataset ) was broken into three distinct groups : ( i ) dimers for which hydrogen bonding is the key component of binding , ( ii ) dimers for which pure dispersion is the key component of binding , and ( iii ) dimers which exhibit a mixture of both of these effects .",
    "comparison with this dataset became the _ de facto _",
    "metric for assessing the ability of fledgling methods within dft to correctly account for van der waals interactions . within this",
    "set ( which was later revised , expanded , and placed in a convenient online database)@xcite were a homodimer of uracil and an a : t heterodimer .        in 2010 ,",
    "a landmark paper by von lilienfeld and tkatchenko showed that the uracil - uracil u : u and adenine - thymine a : t stacked bases exhibit large 3-body dispersion terms@xcite .",
    "going a step further , the authors addressed the magnitude of two and three - body dispersion interactions across the entire s22 dataset .",
    "some of their results are shown in fig .",
    "[ 3-body_s22 ] . using the dft+vdw approach enhanced with the triple - dipole term ( as discussed in section [ sec_methods ] ) , they found that the three distinct groups of the s22 set show markedly different dependencies on three - body dispersion interactions .",
    "the systems showing large 3-body dispersion terms ( which include the stacked u : u and a : t dimers ) were the systems deemed dispersion - dominant and those with essentially no 3-body dispersion interactions were systems dominated by hydrogen bonding . the authors argue that 3-body effects may be more important than previously thought .",
    "interestingly , for stacked nucleobases the 3-body dispersion term seems to be relatively constant , especially compared with the pairwise dispersion term .",
    "figure  [ 3-body_all ] shows the 2 and 3 body dispersion terms calculated by von lilienfeld and tkatchenko for 42 stacked nucleobases and base pairs . the 3-body contribution to",
    "the energy is relatively constant across the entire dataset while the 2-body term varies considerably , especially for the weaker - binding systems .",
    "the @xmath20@xmath20 stacking interactions of dna bases discussed in the previous section are important for another reason .",
    "many cancer - causing agents act by intercalating between base - pairs within a strand of dna , preventing it from carrying out its normal functions .",
    "ironically , some anti - cancer drugs can also act in this way . in the latter case the dna",
    "is intentionally disturbed either to prevent its replication or to trigger cell death .",
    "one well known intercalating anticancer drug is the poly - aromatic ellipticine molecule .",
    "this molecule can intercalate between base pairs of dna where it is believed to interfere with the process of replication , effectively killing the cell.@xcite li et al .",
    "calculated the binding energy between the neutral ellipticine molecule and a single c : g base pair to be 18.4 kcal / mol.@xcite not surprisingly , the strength of the binding was shown to have a substantial dependence on the relative angle between the ellipticine and dna bases , showing a relatively strong ( several kcal / mol ) preference for near parallel and anti - parallel conformations .",
    "chun lin et al . investigated the intercalation of ellipticine between a cytosine - guanine base step ( i.e. a pair of c : g base pairs).@xcite as shown in fig .",
    "[ ellipticine_intercalation ] , they found that ellipticine is significantly attracted to the dna complex even when it is several angstroms away and ultimately intercalates with a binding energy of about 37 kcal / mol , in perfect accord with the earlier results found by li et al .",
    "further , they found that the interaction was repulsive when van der waals interactions were excluded from the calculations .",
    "von lilienfeld and tkatchenko found that the pairwise dispersion energy for this system to be a substantial  kcal / mol and the 3-body correction term was 8.9 kcal / mol.@xcite this is certainly a significant binding event and shows the strength with which aromatic molecules can interact with the loose @xmath20 electrons within dna .",
    "such interactions are common for @xmath20-stacked molecules such as benzene and the large number of relatively close neighbors within the @xmath20-conjugated dna bases is believed to be responsible for the large interaction energy .",
    "the intercalation of both positively charged and neutral proflavine has also been studied.@xcite neutral proflavine was found to bind to a c : g base pair with an energy of about  kcal / mol and charged proflavine with an energy near 12.1 kcal / mol .",
    "the difference between the charged and uncharged binding was attributed to electrostatic effects rather than those of correlation .",
    "this conclusion was reached largely because the results of standard pbe calculations , although they get the interaction energy of each system wrong , exhibit a similar _ difference _ between the two binding energies .",
    "it is interesting to note that the binding energy is larger for the positively charged proflavine even though the negatively charged backbone was omitted from these calculations .",
    "again , a substantial preference for near parallel and anti - parallel relative angles was found .",
    "the energetics of the interaction between proflavine and a t : a base pair was also studied , with results qualitatively similar to those of the proflavine  c : g system.@xcite proflavine was found to bind to t : a with a binding energy of 18  kcal / mol , again showing preference for near parallel and anti - parallel configurations .",
    "steric clashes with the methyl group on the thymine base produced some interesting features in the rotation curve but did not change the overall preferred structures .",
    "perhaps the most interesting finding of li et al .",
    "was that both intercalators studied were found to have stronger interactions with a c : g base pair than a c : g base pair has with _ another _ c : g base pair , and that the angular dependence of these interactions qualitatively differ.@xcite a c : g base pair dimer has a double - well minimum centered around 0@xmath82 , with the minimum - energy configurations at a twist of about 35@xmath82 and 35@xmath82 .",
    "the intercalators , by contrast , exhibit only one of these minima .",
    "this may partially explain the disruption of secondary structure observed upon intercalation of these molecules , which may play an important role in their anti - cancer function.@xcite      owing to their large size and complexity , simulation of proteins often proves to be a formidable challenge even for simple parameterized models .",
    "the application of quantum mechanics to a full protein is , unfortunately , still beyond the reach of modern dft .",
    "recently , however , significant steps toward a quantum understanding of proteins have been made .",
    "helical chains of alanine molecules are often studied because they are relatively simple yet they exhibit the canonical helix structure present in so many proteins .",
    "in addition , when capped with a charged species they can be formed experimentally so computed properties may be compared with experiment.@xcite in one study , tkatchenko et al.looked at three helical forms ( @xmath45 , @xmath20 , and 3@xmath83 ) of poly - alanine chains.@xcite by comparing with pbe , a standard gradient - corrected functional , they found significant van der waals stabilization of all three helix types relative to the fully extended structure .",
    "in fact , pbe predicts nearly equal stabilization energies for all three whereas the van der waals calculations showed a splitting of about 2 kcal / mol between the @xmath45-helix and 3@xmath83 structures .",
    "the authors note that the van der waals effects are of much shorter range than the standard hydrogen bond stabilizations in the helical forms , since the helices are long - ranged structures exhibiting periodic hydrogen bonds . despite this",
    ", the study found that van der waals interactions were critical to explain the observed stability of poly - alanine helices up to about 700 k. through _ ab initio _ molecular dynamics calculations tkatchenko et al . found that , when van der waals effects were excluded , the helical structure gave way to the fully extended form at a temperature well below that observed experimentally , even though hydrogen bonds were still correctly accounted for .",
    "agreement with experiment was recovered when van der waals interactions were included in the calculations , which showed a breaking up of the helical structure between 700 and 800 k.    drug discovery is a multi - billion dollar business and much effort is being put into so called _ rational drug design _ where potential drug molecules are scored based on their predicted binding affinity to a particular protein target.@xcite this transfers the _ trial - and - error _ phase away from the lab , where experiments to test drug binding affinities can be relatively expensive and time - consuming , to the computer , where thousands of potential drugs can be tested for binding at relatively low cost.@xcite working toward this end , antony et al . studied the interactions of a number of protein active sites with their respective biological ligands.@xcite they found that exclusion of van der waals interactions can substantially change the ordering of ligand binding affinities .",
    "further , they found that neglect of these interactions can actually lead to the computed binding energies for a ligand with its target receptor being of the wrong sign .",
    "another study , carried out by rutledge and wetmore focused on ligands that interact with their host protein via @xmath20@xmath20 stacking interactions and t - shaped @xmath20 interactions.@xcite as before , they found that inclusion of van der waals effects is imperative to obtain accurate energetics in such systems .",
    "with the utility of these methods established , attention can be turned toward the future and what can be accomplished with them .",
    "computation of a full macromolecule in atomistic detail is still beyond the reach of dft , even for the most advanced computers , but the method can still be used as a tool to aid in our understanding of such systems .",
    "one useful approach that has been adopted by some groups is to use dft to parameterize new force fields .",
    "typically , these are parameterized either to reproduce experimental results or the results of high - level quantum chemistry calculations .",
    "as discussed in section [ sec_methods ] , quantum chemistry methods are limited to fairly small systems .",
    "parameterizing force fields using the much larger systems that dft is capable of simulating might help average out size effects and better represent the environment that exists within macromolecules .",
    "additionally , solid - state parameter sets could be developed to deal with molecular crystals .",
    "another useful application of dft is in the refinement of experimental structures .",
    "typical x - ray and nmr techniques provide data that is consistent with more than one structure .",
    "also problematic is the placement of the x - ray invisible hydrogen atoms . given this",
    ", experimentalists often use semi - empirical calculations to refine the observed structure .",
    "use of high - level dft calculations including van der waals interactions could yield a better result , since large systems can be calculated very accurately .",
    "drug discovery is another area where useful progress is being made by incorporating dft calculations and it is expected that dft will play an important role in this area soon.@xcite although an entire protein may not be able to be treated quantum mechanically , hybrid methods that apply varying levels of theory to regions within a protein are being used with much success .",
    "one can treat the drug molecule and its binding site with full quantum - mechanical rigor while treating distant regions using well - tested classical or semi - empirical approaches .",
    "this allows the most important physics to be treated accurately and coupled to a sufficient treatment of the less important parts of the problem .",
    "this is not only a useful approach for drug design but also applies to understanding the normal operation of ligand - binding proteins .",
    "such methods are general referred to as qm / mm , i.e.  quantum mechanics / molecular mechanics .",
    "finally , although the applicability of dft to calculations on full macromolecules is currently limited , linear scaling dft methods are becoming popular and provide a tantalizing way forward .",
    "these approaches , which make use of special algorithms and highly - localized basis functions , can easily treat thousands of atoms  see fig .",
    "[ scaling ] .",
    "such capabilities make computation of full macromolecular systems feasible . for example",
    ", the fledgling linear - scaling code onetep has been used to calculate properties of a 20 base - pair strand of dna containing almost 1300 atoms .",
    "if augmented with the ability to adequately treat dispersion interactions , such linear scaling dft approaches may provide a practical means to apply full quantum mechanics to biological problems of real interest in the near future .",
