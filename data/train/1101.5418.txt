    "high-@xmath4 metallic samples there are strong indications that the impurity band merges with the host semiconductor valence band forming mostly host - like states at the fermi energy with some low - energy tail of disorder - related localized states .",
    "@xcite first - principles calculations @xcite have so far not been fully conclusive regarding the nature of the itinerant carriers in this regime , and further theoretical studies continue to be necessary .",
    "meanwhile , attention has shifted to model hamiltonian approaches assuming either the valence band @xcite or impurity band @xcite picture and their ability to adequately describe the experimental results in ga@xmath0mn@xmath1as .",
    "most theoretical approaches assuming the valence - band nature of itinerant holes in ga@xmath0mn@xmath1as treat the band structure in detail , while disorder and many - body effects are only accounted for using simple phenomenological relaxation time approximations and static screening models .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , the extreme sensitivity of magnetic and transport properties of ga@xmath0mn@xmath1as to details of the growth conditions @xcite and post - growth annealing @xcite points to the crucial role played by the defects and their configurations , and has stimulated intense research on the structure of defects and their influence on the various properties of the system .",
    "@xcite it is essential , therefore , to develop a theory of electrical conductivity in dmss with more emphasis given to disorder and electron - electron interactions , without neglecting the intricacies of the electronic band structure .    here",

    "considered only static properties of the system .",
    "@xcite in this paper we simultaneously account for the complexity of the valence band , use a first - principles approach to describe disorder contributions , and employ a fully dynamic treatment of electron interactions .    to account for the valence band structure we use the generalized @xmath2 approach@xcite where a certain number of bands are treated exactly while the contribution from the remote bands is included up to second order in momentum . to describe disorder effects we use the equation of motion for the paramagnetic current response function of the fully disordered system .",
    "this approach has some similarities to models developed earlier using the memory function formalism .",
    "@xcite the advantage of our approach as compared to the memory function formalism is the relative simplicity and transparency of the derivation and the straightforward possibility to include the spin degree of freedom .",
    "another advantage is that our formalism is expressed in terms of a current - current and a set of density and spin - density response functions .",
    "this enables us to use the powerful apparatus of time - dependent density - functional theory ( tddft ) @xcite to treat many - body effects such as dynamic screening and collective excitations of the itinerant carriers in principle exactly .    the paper is divided into two major sections and conclusions . for ease of reading , some of the derivations are presented in appendices .",

    "the general case of multiple types of defects , including defect correlations , was considered in ref .  .",
    "for simplicity we here include only the most important defect type , namely randomly distributed manganese ions in gallium substitutional positions ( @xmath23 ) .",

    "the derivation of such a hamiltonian is outlined in appendix  [ app : kp ] . by diagonalizing the matrix of this hamiltonian , however ,",
    "we obtain the eigenvectors of the modified hamiltonian ( [ hbar ] ) . before evaluating the matrix elements between bloch periodic functions @xmath50 in eqs .",
    "( [ currentmb ] ) and ( [ spindensitymb ] ) we therefore have to perform the unitary transformation ( [ canon ] ) .",

    "let us first examine the current response of the clean system . in this paper",
    "we are considering the optical response , i.e. the response to transverse perturbations . since",
    "transverse perturbations only induce a transverse response in a homogeneous system , there are no density fluctuations directly created by an electromagnetic field .",
    "the total current response of the interacting system in this case can be expressed as @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the response of the noninteracting system , @xmath66 is the coulomb interaction , and the local field factor @xmath67 represents corrections from the exchange - correlation ( xc ) part of the electron interaction .",
    "the corrections to the transverse current response function caused by electron - electron interaction are relativistically small in this case and can be neglected .",
    "so , for the transverse current response of the clean system we will use the noninteracting form .",
    "the set of the density and spin - density response functions of the clean system enters our expression ( [ tau ] ) for the frequency- and momentum - dependent relaxation rates .",
    "tddft allows us to describe all the effect of electron interaction , including correlations and collective modes , in principle , exactly . within the tddft formalism",

    "overall , for energies above the main peak position around 0.2 ev , the calculations are in good agreement with the experimental results .",
    "note also that unlike in ref .  , our calculations do not require incorporation of an impurity band within the energy gap to avoid a drop in conductivity around 0.8 - 1 ev . at energies below the main peak position the agreement with the experiment is worse .",

    "once the frequency goes to zero , the static conductivity should more appropriately be calculated using an expression derived from the semiclassical boltzmann equation.@xcite we have investigated this regime before@xcite to describe the drop in static resistivity in the ferromagnetic phase .",
    "we have developed a comprehensive theory of transport in spin and charge disordered media .",
    "the theory is based on the equation of motion of the paramagnetic current response function of the disordered system , treats disorder and many - body effects on equal footings , and combines a @xmath2 based description of the semiconductor valence band structure with a full dynamic treatment of electron - electron interaction by means of tddft .",
    "we have applied our theory to the specific case of gamnas .",
    "we have shown that the multiband nature and spin - orbit interaction within the valence band bring new effects for p - doped gaas as compared to the conventional n - type systems .",
    "the density and spin - density responses of noninteracting carriers within the valence band are not the same anymore .",
    "moreover , the long wavelength side of the single - particle excitation spectrum is now completely dominated by the inter - valence band _ spin _ excitations . due to the extended region of single - particle excitations within the valence band",
    ", the collective plasmon mode entirely falls within the region of these excitations and , therefore , is effectively damped for all wave vectors .",
    "for the magnetically doped system the mean - field part of the @xmath20-@xmath21 exchange interaction between itinerant holes and localized spins substantially modifies the semiconductor band structure once the system enters a magnetically ordered phase .",

    "our calculations are in good agreement with experimental data for the temperature dependence of the infrared conductivity in gamnas .",
    "a full dynamical treatment of electron - electron interactions is essential to capture the influence of the collective excitations on the carrier relaxation rate .",
    "our calculations show that , by providing an effective channel of momentum relaxation , the collective excitations within the valence band significantly ( up to 50% ) increase the transport relaxation rate .    however , it turns out that the actual infrared absorption spectra are not very sensitive to the details of the frequency dependence of the relaxation rate , but are mostly determined by the features of the band structure .",
    "direct measurements of the position and lineshape of the plasmon resonance itself are likely to be more sensitive to the details of the frequency and momentum dependence of the carrier relaxation rate .",
    "the theory presented here , treating disorder and many - body effects on equal footings , provides a very general framework for describing electron dynamics in materials .",
    "it can , in principle , be made self - consistent and thus be applied beyond the weak - disorder limit ; it can accommodate many different types of disorder , as well as band structure models .",
