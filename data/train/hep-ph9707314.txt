    "the standard model of particle physics has been successfully tested to great accuracy in the past decade  @xcite , the latest result being the remarkable discovery of the top quark  @xcite at the tevatron . despite the many achievements of the standard model at current energies ,",
    "there are reasons to believe it is but the low - energy manifestation of a more fundamental theory  @xcite .",
    "supersymmetry provides an appealing extension of the standard model , which among other virtues , solves the gauge hierarchy problem naturally  @xcite . another argument in favor of supersymmetry is the predicted unification of all gauge coupling constants at approximately @xmath3 gev , which can be taken as a hint of supersymmetric grand unification  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study a scenario in which low - energy supersymmetry has been found and its details have been determined . since such low - energy supersymmetric theories often contain indications of some deeper symmetry ( such as the unification of the coupling constants mentioned above )",
    ", we will assume that such a supersymmetric theory represents the low - energy limit of a more fundamental supersymmetric theory ( such as theories exhibiting supersymmetric grand unification  @xcite , supersymmetric left - right models  @xcite , etc . ) .",
    "we will then look for signatures of this more fundamental theory using an effective lagrangian approach  @xcite which will allow us to isolate the observables in the low - energy supersymmetric theory which are most sensitive to the virtual effects of the underlying theory . in our calculations we will not assume a specific high - energy supersymmetric model ; we will instead determine the kinds of physics probed by the different observables which we consider and their corresponding scales .",
    "we assume that the heavy theory is weakly coupled .",
    "this procedure has been carried out for some particular interactions , such as those relevant to proton decay  @xcite . in this publication",
    "we extend these results by obtaining the complete list ( for a given low - energy supersymmetric spectrum ) of dimension 5 and 6 operators .",
    "we will study the effects of these effective interactions on lepton and baryon number violation and flavor changing processes .    in order to pursue the above program we need to choose a low energy supersymmetric theory .",
    "we will use , for simplicity , the minimal extension of the standard model ( mssm )  @xcite .",
    "the whole program can be carried out for any other low - energy supersymmetric model ( though the presence of new fields considerably lengthens the computations ) . in the following",
    "we will only use the particle content of the mssm , constraints such as the relationships between the scalar and vector masses  @xcite will not be imposed .    in the mssm",
    "each standard model particle acquires a supersymmetric partner of the same mass . concerning the scalar sector , ( at least ) two higgs doublets with their corresponding supersymmetric partners",
    "are required due to the holomorphic character of the superpotential and to achieve anomaly cancelations . in this theory ,",
    "baryon number is not naturally conserved , which leads to an unacceptably fast rate for proton decay . in order to avoid this problem a new symmetry ( r - parity )",
    "must be imposed  @xcite .",
    "after this is done one finds that the most general renormalizable supersymmetric potential compatible with all the symmetries does not break gauge and super - symmetries .",
    "this necessitates the introduction of the so - called `` soft breaking terms ''  @xcite , _ i.e. _ , super - renormalizable terms which break supersymmetry and electroweak symmetry .",
    "the fact that such terms are needed supports the idea that the mssm is the low - energy effective model of a more fundamental theory which becomes manifest above a scale @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "the low - energy effective lagrangian of a weakly coupled renormalizable theory can be written as a linear combination of operators in the light fields suppressed by powers of the heavy scale @xmath4 ( as guaranteed by the decoupling theorem  @xcite ) . in our case",
    "each of these operators is built from the light superfields and respects the low - energy symmetries ( _ i.e. _ @xmath5r - parity ) . the detailed characteristics of the full theory will be encoded in the set of coefficients multiplying the operators .",
    "it is useful to divide the operators into those that can be generated at tree - level by the underlying theory , and those that are only generated by loops  @xcite . under weak coupling conditions ,",
    "tree - level operators are expected to be dominant since the coefficients of loop - generated operators have an additional @xmath6 suppression factor .",
    "we therefore expect that observables affected by tree - level - generated operators will be more sensitive to the heavy physics . using this and similar estimates we and",
    "determine the reach in @xmath4 of any given experiment , and to select those most sensitive to the new physics .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section we briefly describe the structure of an effective supersymmetric lagrangian and summarize the construction of supersymmetric gauge invariant operators . in section [ one ]",
    "we introduce the supersymmetric model we use to exemplify the method , _",
    "i.e. _ , the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm ) and the notation we use , and enumerate all operators of dimensions 5 and 6 . in section [ two ] we find those operators that are generated at tree level from vertices of a most general underlying supersymmetric theory .",
    "as we mentioned before , these are expected to give heavy supersymmetric corrections to processes with the mssm as the low energy scenario . in section",
    "[ three ] we analyze a few examples which represent sensitive probes of potential heavy contributions to low - energy physics .",
    "additional useful information is provided in the appendices .",
    "it is well known that in supersymmetric theories only the f component ( @xmath7 component ) of chiral superfields and the d component ( @xmath8 component ) of vector superfields are invariant up to a total divergence under supersymmetry transformations  @xcite .",
    "as will be explain in more detail in section [ two ] , the effective supersymmetric lagrangian has the following structure @xmath9 + { 1\\over m^2 } \\left [ \\sum_i b_i o_i^{(6 ) } + \\hbox{h.c . } \\right ] + \\cdots , \\label{the.leff}\\ ] ] where ` h.c ' denotes complex conjugation , \\{@xmath10 } and \\{@xmath11 } are gauge - invariant operators of dimension 5 and 6 that result after taking f or d components of suitable supersymmetric operators , and \\{@xmath12 } , \\{@xmath13 } , _ etc .",
    "_ , are undetermined ( and , in general , complex ) coefficients ; the ellipsis denote higher dimensional contributions .",
    "all the operators are constructed out of the light superfields and must be gauge invariant and respect supersymmetry .",
    "to illustrate the procedure by means of which these operators are constructed consider two chiral superfields @xmath14 and @xmath15 transforming respectively as the fundamental representation @xmath16 of su(n ) and its complex conjugate @xmath17 , and the corresponding vector superfield @xmath18 .",
    "their explicit transformation laws are @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the ( hermitian ) generators for @xmath16 and @xmath17 respectively ; it follows that @xmath22 which will be useful below .",
    "note that for the case of local gauge transformations the @xmath23 must be chiral superfields and therefore are necessarily complex , @xmath24 .    using these definitions",
    "we can construct two types of invariants , @xmath25 since * n * corresponds to the fundamental representation we also have the additional invariant   @xmath26    all supersymmetric - invariant operators involving these fields are constructed taking products of composites of the form ( [ inv.1 ] ) and ( [ inv.2 ] ) and extracting their f or d components . in the mssm",
    "both superfields associated with particles and antiparticles are chiral ; products of the form @xmath27 are then also chiral , and the corresponding f components will appear in the ( effective ) lagrangian .",
    "the terms of the form @xmath28 always involve a chiral - antichiral product , hence its d component would be chosen .",
    "a general operator will be a product of these gauge invariant building blocks in which case each operator must be considered separately in order to determine whether its f or d component should be included .",
    "since both @xmath29 and @xmath30 are invariant under global gauge transformations ( as is ( [ inv.2 ] ) ) , all operators can be obtained by first imposing global gauge invariance and then replacing @xmath31 for every chiral superfield , where @xmath32 and the index @xmath33 runs over the different gauge group factors present .",
    "the @xmath34 are the charges of @xmath35 and @xmath36 denote the corresponding lie - algebra valued vector superfields .",
    "it is important to recall at this point that , if an operator @xmath37 has dimension @xmath38 , then its f - component , @xmath39 has dimension @xmath40 , while its d - component , @xmath41 will have dimension @xmath42 .",
    "for example , in order to obtain the contributions to the effective lagrangian of dimension 5 we need chiral composites of dimension 4 and vector composites of dimension 3 . in the next section",
    "we construct all dimension 5 and 6 supersymmetric contributions to the effective lagrangian .",
    "in this section we will construct the operators of dimension @xmath43 appearing in the effective lagrangian .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction we assume that the mssm  @xcite describes the low energy supersymmetric limit to lowest order in @xmath4 ( the scale of the underlying theory ) .",
    "this model is invariant under local @xmath0 ; the superfields involved are listed in table [ tab1 ] , these include two chiral scalar superfields responsible for generating masses for quarks and leptons .    @xmath44    we now construct all operators involving the fields in table [ tab1 ] and their covariant derivatives and whose f and d components are of mass dimension 5 and 6 . to do this we follow the ideas outlined in the previous section and use the canonical dimensions for superfields and derivatives as follows : [ chiral]@xmath45 , [ vector]@xmath46 , [ gauge field strength]@xmath47 and [ covariant derivative]@xmath48 ( see , for example ,  @xcite ) .",
    "further conservation laws ( such as those responsible for the suppression of baryon number violating processes ) are related to additional gauge or discrete symmetries @xcite ( _ eg . _ r - parity ) .",
    "these additional symmetries will be imposed later .",
    "anticipating these restrictions , however , we will ignore all operators of dimension 4 which violate r - parity ( see appendix [ apc ] ) since they imply a short proton lifetime  @xcite .",
    "additional phenomenological constraints will also be considered at the end .    with these preliminaries",
    "we can now enumerate all dimension 5 and 6 operators of the mssm . in constructing this list",
    "we have used the equations of motion  @xcite to eliminate redundant contributions ( see appendix [ apa ] for details ) . to simplify the expressions",
    "it proves convenient to define @xmath49    in what follows @xmath39 indicates that the @xmath50 component of the operator listed is to be included in ( [ the.leff ] ) ; similarly @xmath41 indicates the @xmath51 component should appear in ( [ the.leff ] ) . for compactness",
    ", we will refer to superfields @xmath52 as `` fermions '' , @xmath53 as `` scalars '' and @xmath54 as `` vectors '' .",
    "for some of the operators listed below gauge invariance might allow more than one index contraction ; we choose to keep the indices implicit for a simpler presentation . in section",
    "[ three ] we will calculate the contribution of some of the operators to some physically interesting processes and we will then make explicit the index structure of the relevant operators .",

    "no operators exist in this category since no gauge invariant expression can be constructed out of three ( mssm ) scalar superfields .",
    "@xmath68      @xmath69      chiral operators of this type must contain five chiral scalar superfields ; all such composites violate gauge invariance .",
    "there are no operators in this category .      to obtain a dimension-6 contribution to the effective lagrangian we need an @xmath39 operator of dimension 5 , or an @xmath41 operator of dimension 4 .",
    "neither of these can be constructed purely out of powers of the field strength @xmath70 .",

    "when considering the phenomenological effects of the above operators it must be emphasized that the contributions of an operator will be suppressed whenever it is generated by loops in the underlying theory . within our assumption of a weakly coupled underlying theory the coefficient of any loop ",
    "generated operator will be suppressed by a factor @xmath78 together with a product of coupling constants .",
    "operators generated at tree level will only be suppressed by a product of couplings . because of this it becomes important to determine which of the operators of the previous section are generated at tree level .",
    "following  @xcite we first enumerate all possible vertices present in a general renormalizable supersymmetric gauge theory . using these vertices",
    "we construct all possible graphs corresponding to effective contributions of dimensions 5 and 6 . since we are interested in the effective theory at low energies we consider only graphs with light external and heavy internal lines .    a general renormalizable superpotential contains terms of the form @xmath79 and @xmath80 where @xmath81 denotes a fermion or scalar chiral superfield .",
    "fermion - vector and scalar - vector interactions are generated by @xmath82 , where @xmath18 denotes a vector superfield .",
    "the expansion of the exponential will bring interactions of the form @xmath83 with @xmath84 an integer . finally , there are vector self - interactions coming from the kinetic terms ; the corresponding vertices contain three or more vector lines .",
    "given this set of vertices we now discriminate between heavy and light fields .",
    "we denote by @xmath85 with @xmath86 light ( or heavy ) fermion , scalar and vector superfields respectively .    a first restriction concerns effective operators involving vector superfields only ; they are generated by the kinetic terms and take the general form ( see for example  @xcite ) , @xmath87 since the light generators form a subalgebra any structure constant of the form @xmath88 must vanish .",
    "therefore , as in the non - supersymmetric case  @xcite , the allowed vertices are of the form @xmath89 for four - vector interactions only the following combinations of structure constants are non - vanishing  @xcite @xmath90 leading to @xmath91    a second restriction follows from the fact that the generators of the light algebra can not mix light with heavy chiral superfields .",
    "this disallows vertices of the form @xmath92 and @xmath93 ( n integer ) ; similarly no vertex of the form @xmath94 is present in the theory , which follows from the initial diagonalization of the kinetic terms .",
    "the remaining restrictions apply to vertices containing a single scalar superfield , which are generated by the corresponding kinetic term when a heavy scalar gets a vacuum expectation value @xmath95 .",
    "being interested in operators of dimension @xmath1 we need only consider diagrams with one heavy internal vector line .",
    "this means that we can replace @xmath96 using the fact that the light generators annihilate @xmath97 we have @xmath98 .",
    "we also note that given an broken generator @xmath99 the vector @xmath100 is the direction of a would - be goldstone boson ; since these excitations transform among themselves under the unbroken group we have @xmath101 and @xmath102 for all physical scalar superfields @xmath103 . collecting these results",
    "we get @xmath104 so that there are no vertices of the form @xmath105 .",
    "there are no other general constraints to be derived from gauge invariance .    using the allowed vertices",
    "we now construct all possible diagrams corresponding to contributions to the effective lagrangian of dimension 5 and 6 which are generated at tree level ; the procedure is straightforward , although lengthy .",

    "the operators ( [ inc10]-[inc16 ] ) and ( [ inc18]-[inc20 ] ) modify the couplings of the vector - boson to the quarks and leptons and are correspondingly constrained by existing data which implies@xmath108tev ( taking the corresponding @xmath109 in ( [ the.leff ] ) and assuming no cancelations ) @xcite .",
    "four - fermion interactions provide similar bounds  @xcite . finally ( [ bisscaone])-([bisscatwo ] ) contribute two the @xmath110 parameter which also provides a bound of the same order  @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that supersymmetry and gauge invariance allows us to bound operators containing only sparticles through current data .",
    "we note that all these bounds merely state that @xmath111 is greater than ( roughly ) the scale at which low - energy supersymmetry is expected to become manifest .",
    "higher sensitivity can be achieved by considering processes which are strictly forbidden with in the mssm , but which can be generated by the heavy dynamics .",

    "there are a few operators , however , which violate some of the global symmetries of the mssm and the corresponding observables are much more sensitive to @xmath4 .",
    "we will study three important examples : operators contributing to proton decay , to flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) and to processes with lepton number violation .",
    "baryon and lepton number conservation are automatic in the standard model after gauge invariance and renormalizability",
    ". however , this is not so in supersymmetric models , where we need to invoke additional symmetries @xcite in order to forbid fast baryon decay through dimension - four operators .",
    "discrete , global and gauge symmetries have been considered in the literature , though only gauge symmetries are respected by gravitational interactions  @xcite .",
    "therefore only the low - energy remnants of such extra gauge interactions appear to be feasible candidates . here",
    "we use r - parity to forbid these dangerous operators  @xcite .",

    "these operators must have the symmetries of the low - energy theory , in this case @xmath184 and r - parity , the latter which must be included to avoid fast nucleon decay .    for phenomenological reasons we divided the operators into those that can be generated at tree level by the underlying physics and",
    "those which must be generated via loops . under weak coupling conditions of the underlying theory ,",
    "tree - level operators are expected to be dominant ( for a given dimension ) compared to loop - generated ones .",
    "having done this we can estimate the relevant contributions for a process , or compare the coefficients of the operators and determine their relative ( estimated ) strengths .",
    "existing data puts , for the most part , no stringent bounds on the scale of heavy supersymmetry .",
    "we studied three exceptions : proton decay , fcnc and lepton number violation . for the case of baryon number violation",
    "the corresponding contributions have been extensively studied in the literature  @xcite ; the above estimates ( validated by these detailed calculations ) @xmath185 and @xmath186 for the masses of the heavy scalars and vectors respectively .",
    "the constraints on fcnc imply @xmath187 .",
    "finally neutrinoless double-@xmath188 decay data requires @xmath189 . in obtaining these bounds we assumed that there are no significant cancelations among the various contributions , when this is relaxed the bounds are weakened",
    "should the mssm ( or an alternative model ) be discovered , the elucidation of the various couplings and masses should considerably improve this picture allowing for a variety of bounds obtained by considering processes involving sfermions and other superparticles .",
    "the study of rare processes , however , will provide the best bounds unless low - lying mass thresholds exist .",
    "the bounds derived constrain different types of heavy fields depending on the diagrams responsible for the relevant operators .",
    "it is important to note that although the bounds obtained for @xmath4 using l violating operators constrains the physics at which lepton number is violated , this does not necessarily imply that _ all _ physics beyond low - energy supersymmetry is similarly bounded .",
    "thus , while the bounds obtained using rare processes are quite severe , they do not necessarily extend to the whole set of operators obtained .",

    "when writing all possible effective operators from a given set of light fields and covariant derivatives there may be redundant information ; operators which differ by terms vanishing when the equations of motion are used are equivalent at the level of the s matrix ( see for example @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "one can then use the classical equations of motion to reduce the actual set of operators to a minimal set of inequivalent operators .",
    "in particular , for operators that involve covariant derivatives , the equations of motion can be used to reduce them to operators without covariant derivatives . in what follows",
    "we sketch the way the substitution proceeds , without trying to be exhaustive .",
    "we denote the supersymmetry - gauge covariant derivative by @xmath190 and @xmath191 for the covariant spinorial derivative .",
    "operators that involve @xmath192 can be simplified by using the equations of motion .",
    "the classical equation for @xmath193 has the form @xmath194 where @xmath195 is the superpotential and involves operators up to dimension three .    as an example we can consider operator ( [ covder ] ) below . from the mssm superpotential ( see appendix [ apc ] ) , we obtain @xmath196 where @xmath197 are constants , and therefore @xmath198 the operators on the right are exactly ( [ fourthree ] ) and ( [ fourfive ] ) .",
    "we also note that , in this particular case , the operators are a total divergence after taking the d - component on both sides , since the right - hand side is a chiral operator .",
    "operators that involve the combination @xmath199 { \\nabla^\\alpha}\\ ] ] can be similarly simplified by using the equations of motion .    in what follows we enumerate all the operators involving covariant derivatives and superfield strengths .",
    "we use the notation @xmath200 to represent the superfield strength corresponding to superfields @xmath72 defined in ( [ ves ] ) .",
    "@xmath202    where the expression for the covariant derivative involves those vector superfields that correspond to each case .",
    "+      @xmath203      @xmath204    similar comments as above for @xmath205 .",
    "@xmath206      @xmath207      @xmath208",
    "we need dimension - four operators of the f - type to construct the superpotential .",
    "the list is the following : @xmath209 the first three operators conserve baryon and lepton number and enter the mssm lagrangian . operators ( [ fourone])-([fourtwo ] ) violate these symmetries and induce fast proton decay .",
