    "marcy et al . ( 2001 ) have discovered two planets in 2:1 orbital resonances about the star gj876 .",
    "this and possibly two other resonant pairs , one in 2:1 resonances about hd82943 ( mayor et al .",
    "2001 ; godziewski & maciejewski 2001 ) and the other in 3:1 resonances about 55cnc ( marcy et al . 2002 ) , and the ease of capture into these resonances from nebula induced differential migration of the orbits ( e.g. , lee & peale 2002 ) , mean that such resonances are likely to be ubiquitous among extrasolar planetary systems .",
    "a dynamical fit to the radial velocity data ( e.g. , laughlin & chambers 2001 ) places the gj876 planets on coplanar orbits deep in three resonances at the 2:1 mean - motion commensurability .",
    "the libration of the mean - motion resonance variables , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and the secular resonance variable , @xmath2 , about @xmath3 ( where @xmath4 are the mean longitudes of the inner and outer planet and @xmath5 are the longitudes of periapse ) differs from the familiar geometry of the 2:1 resonances between jupiter s satellites io and europa , where @xmath6 librates about @xmath3 but @xmath7 and @xmath8 librate about @xmath9 . we have found that this difference is mainly due to the magnitudes of the orbital eccentricities involved ( @xmath10 for the io - europa system , but @xmath11 for gj876 ) .",
    "stable simultaneous librations of the resonance variables require the equality of the average periapse motions , @xmath12 .",
    "when the @xmath13 are small , the @xmath14 are dominated by the lowest order resonant terms in the disturbing potential , and @xmath15 requires @xmath16 and @xmath17 . on the other hand ,",
    "when the @xmath13 are large , the dominance of higher order terms means that @xmath18 requires both @xmath6 and @xmath19 ( see lee & peale 2002 for details ) and for some systems with masses different from those in gj876 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 far from either @xmath3 or @xmath9 ( see   3 ) .",
    "the likely origin of the resonances in the gj876 system is the differential planet migration due to planet - nebula interaction .",
    "the planets are sufficiently massive to open gaps in the nebula disk surrounding the young gj876 and to clear the disk material between them ( bryden et al . 2000 ; kley 2000 ) , and the resulting planet - nebula interaction typically forces the outer planet to migrate inward on the disk viscous timescale ( e.g. , ward 1997 ) .",
    "figure 1 shows the evolution of the semimajor axes @xmath20 , eccentricities @xmath13 , and resonance variables @xmath6 and @xmath7 for a calculation where the outer planet of the gj876 system is forced to migrate inward and there is no eccentricity damping .",
    "both @xmath6 and @xmath7 are captured into libration about @xmath3 , but the @xmath13 quickly exceed the observed values ( dotted lines ) with continued migration within the resonance . therefore ,",
    "unless resonance capture occurred just before nebula dispersal , eccentricity damping is required to produce the observed @xmath13 of the gj876 system .",
    "eccentricity damping of the form @xmath21 causes the eccentricities to reach constant values that decrease with increasing @xmath22 .",
    "figure 1 also shows the evolution of the @xmath13 for a calculation with @xmath23 , which is chosen to yield the observed @xmath13 . in figure 1",
    "we have neglected the outward migration of the inner planet due to the torques induced by any nebula left on the inside of the inner planet , as this does not qualitatively change the evolution except to require less eccentricity damping ( @xmath24 ) to arrive at the observed eccentricities ( lee & peale 2002 ) .",
    "as the example in figure 1 shows , differential migration of planets through capture into a set of resonances and subsequent evolution without eccentricity damping cause the system to pass through a continuous sequence of stable libration states , whose configurations depend on the values of the eccentricities @xmath13 and the mass ratios @xmath25 and @xmath26 ( where @xmath27 is the mass of the primary ) . where a system with a given set of parameters is left along this sequence depends on the termination of the migration through nebula dispersal , or much more probably , the magnitude of the eccentricity damping .    for @xmath28 ( a factor of 10 smaller than in the gj876 system ) , @xmath29 , and very small initial @xmath13 ,",
    "a system is captured initially into a io - europa like configuration , with @xmath6 librating about @xmath3 and @xmath7 librating about @xmath9 .",
    "continued migration forces @xmath30 to larger values and @xmath31 from increasing to decreasing until the system passes smoothly over to the gj876 configuration with all @xmath32 librating about @xmath3 .",
    "then both @xmath30 and @xmath31 increase smoothly as in figure 1 until instability ensues at very large @xmath13 . for @xmath33 ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , the passage from the io - europa configuration to the gj876 configuration is as above , but when the increasing @xmath30 reaches @xmath34@xmath35 ( depending on @xmath25 ) , the libration centers depart by tens of degrees from @xmath3 , leading to stable libration of the @xmath32 far from either @xmath3 or @xmath9 .",
    "this asymmetric libration can persist for a wide range of @xmath30 , but the system returns to the configuration with all @xmath32 librating about @xmath3 for sufficiently large @xmath30 . if @xmath36 ( see fig .",
    "3 ) , the resonance variables never reach the gj876 configuration after leaving the io - europa configuration . within each type of evolution ,",
    "the details of the path depend only on @xmath25 and not on the total planetary mass , provided @xmath37 are not too large .",
    "if @xmath38 as in the gj876 system , fairly large @xmath13 are generated before resonance encounter and the io - europa configuration expected at small @xmath13 is skipped ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "for the inner two planets of the 55cnc system [ with minimum @xmath28 ] and the expected range of migration rates , capture into the 3:1 resonances is sensitive to the initial conditions and migration rate .",
    "figures 3 and 4 show the results of two calculations that are different only in the initial orientation of the orbits , and the former is captured into 2:1 resonances while the latter is captured into 3:1 .",
    "as shown in figure 4 , there are also 3:1 resonance configurations with asymmetric librations .",
    "the `` normal '' behavior for small eccentricities where the 3:1 resonance variables ( see fig .  4 for definitions )",
    "librate about @xmath3 or @xmath9 changes to librations about angles far removed from either of these as the system is forced deeper into the resonances with continued migration .",
