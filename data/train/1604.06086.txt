    "since the discovery of the high temperature superconductor lafeaso@xmath5f@xmath6 , superconductivity has been found in many iron pnictides with different crystal structures such as afeas ( a = alkaline or alkaline - earth metal ) , and ( afe@xmath2as@xmath2 , a= ca , sr , ba , and eu).@xcite iron chalcogenide materials , however , feature superconducting critical temperatures of up to about 30 k in bulk at high [ fech ( ch = s , se , and te ) ] or ambient pressure [ a@xmath6fe@xmath7se@xmath2 ( a = k , rb , cs , and tl ) ] and over 100 k in thin films.@xcite among the most notable characteristics of iron chalcogenide superconductors are chemical inhomogeneity and deviations from ideal stoichiometry with considerable influence in magnetic interactions and superconductivity . binary fech materials feature interstitial iron whereas ternary materials show vacancy - induced nanoscale separation on magnetic and superconducting domains.@xcite    the existence of super - lattice of fe - vacancies in ( tl , k , rb)fe@xmath6se@xmath8 system results in an occurrence of the block antiferromagnetic and semiconducting state.@xcite recently , it has been found that k@xmath6fe@xmath7s@xmath2 and kfe@xmath3ag@xmath4te@xmath2 feature spin glass and long range magnetic order , respectively.@xcite the latter material , in particular , is a k or fe / ag vacancy - free and its magnetism and mechanism of non - metallic state is of high interest .",
    "ag atoms fill fe lattice so that there are no vacancies on fe / ag site in the crystal structure . yet",
    ", ag does mimic fe vacancy in the electronic structure since ag orbitals are sunk from the fermi level .",
    "thus fe@xmath9 unconventional magnetic and insulating states can be studied in materials crystallizing in the fe vacancy - free i4/mmm space group , identical to the space group of superconducting nano and micro -scale domains in a@xmath6fe@xmath7se@xmath2.@xcite    in this work we report discovery of semiconducting spin glass kfe@xmath0ag@xmath1te@xmath2 single crystals with spin freezing temperature t@xmath10 below @xmath1153 k in 1000 oe .",
    "the material crystallizes in i4/mmm space group with possible vacancies on the metal site , demonstrating that magnetic ground state is very sensitive to the subtle ratio of fe / ag and defects .",
