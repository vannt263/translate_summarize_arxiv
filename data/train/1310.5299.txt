    "as the momentous transition between conducting and insulating states by making a simple change ( temperature , pressure , electron concentration , disorder ) , the metal - insulator transition ( mit ) has assumed extraordinary importance in condensed matter physics research and plays a role in actual and anticipated applications .",
    "established mechanisms include ( 1 ) _ inter_electronic repulsion of electrons at low density ( wigner transition ) , ( 2 ) _ intra_atomic repulsion and resulting correlation ( mott transition ) , ( 3 ) disorder leading to incoherence and localization ( anderson transition ) , ( 4 ) coupling to lattice , thereby opening new band gaps ( peierls transition ) , and ( 5 ) _ inter_atomic repulsion leading to charge ordering (  verwey transition ? \" ) .",
    "the latter mechanism is distinguished by a breaking of symmetry on a sublattice of cations having partially filled , correlated ( viz .",
    "@xmath5 ) electronic shells .",
    "the mechanism for the verwey mit in magnetite fe@xmath6o@xmath7 from the time of its discovery@xcite was speculated to involve ordering to two charge states fe@xmath8 and fe@xmath9 on one fe sublattice , making it the earliest example of a charge order transition , one that evidently would explain the mit .",
    "a related charge order mechanism arises from disproportionation occurring at , and driving , the transition , which might also be envisioned as the mechanism in magnetite : 2fe@xmath10@xmath1 fe@xmath9 + fe@xmath8 .",
    "the former is a disorder - order ( charge disorder - charge order ) transition in which the `` symmetric '' metallic phase contains two space- and time - fluctuating charge states , the second is a disproportionation - driven transition in which every site in the metallic phase is equivalent even on a short time scale@xcite ( rather than only in time - averaged diffraction ) .    in this paper",
    "we extend our earlier work@xcite on analyzing the connection between putative charge order driven mits and the cation charge states that are involved .",
    "this study brings the concept , and the specification , of _ charge state _ or _ ( formal ) oxidation state _ or _ formal valence _ to the fore .",
    "we noted that the physical cation charge ",
    "the @xmath5 occupation  can be identified from electronic structure calculations , by giving up the usual approach of integrating the density over some volume and instead simply looking at the cation charge density in the vicinity of the peak in the radial density @xmath11 where only @xmath5 density resides .",
    "differences in @xmath5 occupation , which are our current interest , are particularly easy to identify and quantify .",
    "several examples of differing charge states were shown to contain equal @xmath5 occupations ; actual charge is effectively divorced from `` charge state '' in some of those examples .    in sec .",
    "ii the original chemist s concept of `` oxidation number '' [ or ( formal ) oxidation state ] is discussed briefly , noting that it metamorphosed into a more physical picture of `` charge state '' for materials physicists .",
    "a brief poor man s description of what is used to specify the charge state of an ion is provided in sec .",
    "some theoretical aspects , relating both to charge order transitions and to oxidation states , are discussed in sec .",
    "iv . in sec . v we begin by recounting one illustrative example of competing charge states in a compound , and proceed to review and extend slightly our previous examples of charge ordering materials where it was established that no @xmath5 occupation difference between differing charge states exists .",
    "we proceed to an unconventional case  metallic with second order transition ",

    "vi , and in sec .",
    "vii look into the charge states of ag in stable , untransforming , insulating ago .",
    "our discussion in sec .",
    "viii pulls together some of our thoughts on understanding and modeling structural and electronic transitions in the types of systems we have discussed .",
    "chemists introduced the _ oxidation number _",
    "( sometimes , oxidation state ) of an atom in a molecule almost entirely on the basis of structure and electronegativity . with its high electronegativity , oxygen has oxidation number -2 except in very unusual geometries , and halides are -1 , in both cases filling a shell .",
    "electropositive ions ( alkalis , alkaline earths , rare earths ) in oxides and halides donate the electrons in their outer @xmath12 and @xmath13 shells , giving obvious positive oxidation numbers denoted early on and occasionally still by roman numerals : viz .",
    "li@xmath14 , ca@xmath15 , la@xmath16 .",
    "most of the complications arise when , after nature has completed its bonding , an open @xmath17 shell remains .",
    "for example , vanadium oxides may have v@xmath15 , v@xmath16 , v@xmath18 , and v@xmath19 , and combinations thereof .",
    "the chemistry literature@xcite contains numerous disclaimers that these oxidation states  have nothing to do with actual charge \" and some strive to maintain distinctions between the different terms in covalent molecules and molecular complexes . in the current materials physics literature",
    "there is no discernible distinction .",
    "oxidation states are assigned from the structure ( coordination and distance of neighbors of known valence ) , becoming formalized@xcite in the _ valence bond sum _ that derives a formal valence ( or ` bond order ' ) directly from bondlengths .",
    "sometimes the magnetic moment is involved , giving different ionic radii for high spin versus low spin ion .",
    "nevertheless oxidation numbers ( formal valences ) have come to be connected with the number of actively - occupied local orbitals ; through size  higher oxidation state means fewer electrons and a smaller ion ; through symmetry  a jahn - teller ( jt ) distorted coordination shell reflects specific orbital occupations ; through magnetic moment , which requires specific unpaired spin - orbitals .",
    "these oxidation numbers smelled a lot like charges to later scientists ( especially material physicists ) , and they necessarily sum to zero like real charges . already in 1939 , fourteen years after the naissance of quantum mechanics , verwey was discussing the metal - to - insulator ( mit ) transition in magnetite ( fe@xmath6o@xmath7 )  the verwey transition at 120 k  in terms of charge ordering of fe@xmath9 and fe@xmath8 ions on one of the iron sublattices . note that the notation had already begun to shift fe(ii)@xmath1 fe@xmath9 etc .",
    "the meaning was clearly _ physical charges _ as opposed to puerile oxidation states : to account for the transition from itinerant conductor to charge - localized insulator , actual charges were ordering , getting stuck to ions , becoming localized , and so forth  that seemed to be the problem to solve .",
    "ionic radii and high / low spin designations differ with coordination,@xcite due in large part to the difference in crystal field . unless noted , we use language applying to octahedral coordination for our comments .    _ size . _ the ionic radius characterization of charge states has organized a great deal of structural information .",
    "the organization of all the structural data culminated in the table of _ shannon ionic radii _ compiled by shannon and prewitt that have provided the standard for more than four decades.@xcite for @xmath17 ions in 6-fold coordination ,",
    "the average cation - oxygen distance together with the o@xmath20 radius of @xmath211.40 - 1.42   specifies the ionic radius , the shannon values being the best fit for a given presumed charge state to a large set of compounds .",
    "note that the ionic radius contains no input from the actual size of the electronic cloud of the ion .",
    "also , ionic radii differ for different coordinations , whereas the charge density is virtually invariant .",
    "the charge density is not used , as it is never measured with sufficient precision to be useful in this context ( and the chemists insist it is irrelevant anyway ) .    _",
    "symmetry_. distortions from symmetric coordination ",
    "jahn - teller distortions  are assigned to occupation of specific , directional orbitals .",
    "such assignments have been borne out by electronic structure calculations in a great number of cases .",
    "the la@xmath4vcuo@xmath22 example will be discussed in sec .",
    "v , where it will be seen that spin - orbital occupations can be confusing .    _",
    "magnetic moment . _ a curie - weiss moment , or ordered moment , reflects `` unpaired '' occupation , _",
    "i.e. _ distinct orbitals are occupied by one spin only .",
    "cations of a given charge state can sometimes occur in both high spin and low spin ( often zero ) configurations .",
    "interestingly , the two spin states that arise in several ions have been assigned to different ionic radii , with the high spin configuration typically 0.04    larger than low spin of a given charge state.@xcite spin polarization actually changes the @xmath5 occupation and the radial density ( real ionic size ) by a negligible amount .",
    "spin polarization does however create a spin splitting so that up and down spin electrons hybridize differently with the o ions , and there is an interorbital hund s rule energy .",
    "tight binding modeling of charge ordering transitions typically invokes , beyond the hopping term @xmath23 , direct _",
    "inter_site repulsion between charges on neighboring cations in addition to _ intra_site repulsion : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the hubbard on - site repulsion and @xmath26 is an intersite repulsive energy , where @xmath27 indicates neighboring sites and @xmath28 are spin indices . the second term alone , which is pictured as the driving force , would minimize the energy by forcing as much charge as possible onto as few distant sites as possible .",
    "the hubbard term provides the necessary , and physical , energy that opposes excessive inhomogeneity .",
    "pietig _ et al._@xcite and hellberg@xcite have shown , for example , that this hamiltonian alone , on a two - dimensional cluster with periodic boundary conditions , shows a range of re - entrant ( with temperature ) charge order transitions in a certain range of @xmath29 ( with @xmath25 set equal to the bandwidth ) , similar to the popular interpretation of behavior observed in some manganites .",
    "other hamiltonian terms are included in more general models than the single - band case just mentioned : very often jahn - teller distortion energies @xmath30 for multiorbital systems , and sometimes magnetic hund s rule energy ( on - site spin - spin ) @xmath31 as well as distance dependent kinetic hopping @xmath32 .",
    "this type of extension ( without hund s rule ) has been applied by mishra _",
    "et al._@xcite to model behavior observed in manganites . in a two band model for @xmath33 electrons in perovskite nickelates ( which we discuss below ) ,",
    "lee and coworkers@xcite applied a hamiltonian @xmath34 ( notably without @xmath35 ) and obtained charge order - like phases driven by fermi surface nesting .",
    "these nickelates do not show jt distortions as anticipated of an @xmath36 system , prompting mazin _",
    "et al._@xcite to suggest avoidance of jt distortion can be accomplished in certain regimes by charge ordering instead .",
    "they suggested the form of hamiltonian mentioned above , minus the @xmath35 term , should provide the relevant energies .",
    "interestingly also , when performing a thorough mean field study of ordered states in @xmath37nio@xmath4 ( @xmath37 = na , li , ag , the latter of which we address in sec .",
    "vi ) , uchigaito _ et al . _ also chose not to use the @xmath35 intersite repulsion term , although several other interactions were included . amongst the many possible phases uncovered for a selection of independent interaction strengths in the hamiltonian were phases of charge ordered type.@xcite      it is commonly stated and generally accepted that dividing the crystalline density into atomic contributions is so subjective as to be useless for specifying a charge state .",
    "this statement contains a lot of truth but is not entirely correct .",
    "creating disjoint volumes associated with ions is indeed subjective and ambiguous .",
    "however , the general question is more subtle than dividing up space , so it is worthwhile to digress briefly .",
    "almost four decades ago ball demonstrated,@xcite using small displacements of nuclei , how the charge density of a collection of atoms can be decomposed uniquely into contributions from each atom ( `` pseudoatoms '' ) . in the process",
    "he also identified a charge backflow field associated with each atom when it is displaced slightly .",
    "subsequently he qualified@xcite this result , which does indeed apply to any finite system and to non - polar solids where the pseudoatoms are necessarily neutral .",
    "polar solids , however , provide additional challenges closely related to the difficulties of treating polarization in such solids , where much progress has been made in the past two decades.@xcite the fact that the born effective charge for a charged ion is a tensor provides insight : the ( born ) effective charge is not a simple scalar , but depends on the direction of displacement .",
    "ball s prescription has so far been applied only to simple metals,@xcite where it may be useful for understanding lattice dynamics and , applying the same prescription to the potential , electron - phonon coupling.@xcite because the name _ pseudoatom _ has been used in so many different contexts , the designation _ enatom _ has been suggested for ball s",
    "pseudoatom.@xcite    it remains true that trying to divide space into regions in which the charge density is assigned to a particular atom is a subjective , hence useless enterprise in practice .",
    "approach differs , by deriving overlapping atomic densities extending perhaps to a few shells of neighbors .",
    "this observation conforms well to our finding,@xcite discussed at more length below , that the @xmath17 occupation often does not vary at all between different charge states .",
    "if a rather small sphere were chosen to specify the charge , different charge states would have identical charges ( in those regions ) . where the charge state picture clearly works  which is very often  the electronic spectrum is a central property : occupied bands corresponding to occupied local spin - orbitals can be identified , and the sum of the orbital occupations determines the charge state .",
    "these have conventionally been pictured as atomic orbitals , but the development and use of wannier functions ( wfs ) over the past decade provides an alternative viewpoint that we return to below .",
    "two proposals for the definition and calculation of  oxidation states \" ( both used this terminology rather than charge states ) have appeared recently . with molecular complexes in mind ,",
    "sit _ et al . _",
    "suggested@xcite projecting the occupied states onto atomic ( @xmath5 , say ) orbitals to obtain the spin - orbital occupation matrix as is done in the lda+u method , diagonalize this matrix , and the number of eigenvalues representing full occupancy provide the number of occupied physical orbitals and hence the oxidation state .",
    "smaller occupations are ignored . for the transition metal complexes they provided as examples , the procedure was relatively clear . however , possible ambiguities could be imagined : in one of the examples 0.93 needed to be interpreted as occupied , 0.63 as not occupied .",
    "more testing of these ideas should prove instructive .",
    "another proposal , by jiang _",
    "et al._,@xcite applying specifically to periodic systems , employed developments in the theory of polarization in crystals to formulate their definition of oxidation number as the integral of ( viz .",
    "average of ) the born effective charge as the ion s sublattice is displaced adiabatically by one direct lattice vector .",
    "the material must remain insulating but otherwise the result is independent of the path in configuration space .",
    "this procedure does not identify an ion s charge density or necessarily even entail a true charge , but does provide the interpretation of the change in polarization as being due to the transport of a number of unit charges equal to the oxidation state through a displacement corresponding to the lattice vector .    as in the case of the enatom",
    "mentioned earlier , this definition also does not make the oxidation state a property of the static reference state ",
    "displacement is required . because the path is periodic ( it can be repeated ) ,",
    "any point can be considered as the starting ( reference ) point , with the same oxidation state ( same integral ) .",
    "thus the ion retains one fixed oxidation state along the path in configuration space .",
    "considering that the born effective charge is anisotropic , it seems possible that the oxidation state by this definition in an anisotropic insulator also depends  as does the born effective charge  on the direction of the direct lattice vector that connects the end points .",
    "further applications of this proposal will be enlightening , as will the fact that displacement is required to specify what is normally envisioned as a property of the static system .      in the survey in this paper of charge ordering transition involving different charge states , and hence of the specification of charge states more generally , we will begin to explore the viability of abandoning atomic orbitals , whose occupation often does not change at the ` charge ordering ' transition , in favor of wannier orbitals .",
    "the basic idea is : calculate atomic - like wannier functions for the relevant states and explore whether these orbitals support the charge state viewpoint .",
    "though ideas along these lines have been implicit in discussing specific materials , and wannier functions have been integrated into the electronic structure calculations in various ways , this change from atomic to wannier orbitals becomes transformational when applied to ` charge ordering ' transitions . without any change in actual ( @xmath5 ) charge on the open - shell cation ,",
    "what are the relevant degrees of freedom to consider ?",
    "we return to some of these general issues in the discussion in sec .",
    "viii , but we begin by considering a simple and nearly transparent case illustrating the idea .    in the double perovskite compound ba@xmath4naoso@xmath22 ,",
    "osmium is formally a heptavalent os@xmath38 @xmath39 ion  a very high oxidation state . calculating the @xmath40 charge in the ion ,",
    "though one can not arrive at a precise value as noted above , corresponds to occupation by around 4.5 ( not 1.0 ) @xmath40 electrons.@xcite cases of large differences between actual charge and oxidation state are common knowledge in the electronic structure community . does this signal the breakdown of the charge state picture for high valence state ions ?",
    "it does nt : calculations@xcite indicate one electron in the otherwise unoccupied `` @xmath40 bands , '' spin half of course , and if the @xmath40 occupation is not tied to the charge state ( which it is nt ) then the formal valence picture survives in robust fashion .",
    "analysis shows that the occupied @xmath40 orbital ( _ i.e. _ the wannier function ) is a strongly hybridized mixture of 50% os @xmath40 state and 50% o @xmath41 contributions distributed around the neighboring oxygen ions .",
    "the other four electrons making up the total @xmath40 occupation of 4.5 are hybridized into ( and thereby vanish into ) the 6 atoms @xmath42 3 orbitals = 18 occupied o `` @xmath41 bands . ''",
    "transformation from atomic orbitals to wannier orbitals would presumably lead to 18 occupied o - centered orbitals of @xmath13 symmetry with tails of os @xmath40 states , and _",
    "one _ occupied os @xmath40-derived orbital with tails composed of o @xmath41 orbitals .",
    "so although several @xmath40 electrons vanish into the o @xmath41 bands , all five `` @xmath40 orbitals '' survive by recovering charge from the @xmath41 orbitals .",
    "understanding that strong metal - oxygen hybridization implies the efficacy of generalized ( wannier ) orbitals has been around for a while ; for example , it provided a simple picture explaining why _ second _ cu - cu neighbor coupling along a chain dominated over near neighbor coupling in the cu - o magnetic chain compound li@xmath4cuo@xmath4.@xcite    another example illustrates an apparent connection between wfs and formal valence .",
    "et al._@xcite have calculated @xmath33 wfs for the two charge states in a charge ordered manganite la@xmath43ca@xmath43mno@xmath6 , finding a substantial difference in the extent of the tails , the `` mn@xmath44 '' wf being more localized .",
    "concerns about specifying charge states with wfs include ( 1 ) a computational issue : the gauge freedom means wfs are far from unique , so subjective choices may lead to different conclusions , and ( 2 ) a conceptual issue : the choice of projections  the orientations , for example  themselves are not objective .",
    "at one extreme are maximally localized wfs@xcite that may not be centered on an ion and may be unsymmetrical , therefore complicating if not destroying any utility in representing physical orbitals .",
    "atom orbital- and symmetry - projected wfs@xcite ( `` maximally projected '' ) provide an alternative approach , one that should provide a more physical representation , and the projection issue may present less of a non - uniqueness ambiguity . this viewpoint remains to be tested seriously .",
    "in oxides containing two transition metals , one of the first tasks in understanding them is to categorize the charge states of the ions .",
    "the sum is known from oxygen and the simpler ions , but a number of competing factors ( which are not well understood and are likely to be material - specific ) determine the balance .",
    "the double perovskite structure is simple and provides our first example .",
    "the computational methods we have used were described previously.@xcite in our earlier work@xcite on la@xmath4vcuo@xmath22 , using the lda+u method@xcite as is necessary for such oxides , it was found that the two configurations v@xmath45cu@xmath46 , a standard closed shell band insulator , and v@xmath44cu@xmath9 , a spin - compensated ferrimagnetic correlated insulator with a very small gap , are practically degenerate in energy after full structural relaxation .",
    "these charge state assignments fit in all respects .",
    "structurally , the mean v - o distances are 1.84   and 1.88   respectively for the two configurations , differing by the difference in the corresponding v ionic radii ( 0.04  ) .",
    "the mean cu - o distances are 2.02   and 1.98  , respectively , again differing by their ionic radii ( 0.04   also ) .",
    "the jahn - teller distortion magnitude for the magnetic configuration ( long bond minus short bond ) is 0.11   for both ions , an unambiguous jt distortion .",
    "magnetically , v and cu have one electron and one hole , respectively , as judged by the moment ( reduced somewhat by hybridization ) and by their respective filled and empty bands .",
    "these two configurations are `` poster kids '' for the charge state picture  nothing could be clearer . the spin density is pictured in fig",
    ".  [ vcuspindens ] and supports the charge state description of the spin compensated mott insulating phase .",
    ".spin - orbital inscribed atomic sphere occupation numbers from gga+u calculations for the two charge states of la@xmath4vcuo@xmath22 .",
    "the difference in the total ( last column ) for the two charge states of both v and cu arise from _ oxygen tail contributions _ , since the @xmath5 occupations are identical for the two charge states .",
    "values for the active jahn - teller orbitals are emphasized in boldface . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     since the nio@xmath22 octahedra are somewhat distorted in this system , it is the eigenvalues of the occupation matrices for the two spins for ( ferromagnetic ) ynio@xmath6 that we present in table  [ ynio3occnumbers ] .",
    "these values can be used to evaluate the oxidation state prescription of sit _",
    "et al._@xcite their prescription gives ni@xmath9 and ni@xmath44 oxidation states as long as one identifies 0.83 and 0.85 as ` fully occupied ' ( the other fully occupied states have eigenvalue 0.91 - 0.92 ) , and 0.58 and 0.64 as not fully occupied and thus _ un_occupied . to make the issue more apparent , it is useful to think of scaling the maximum occupation for this sphere size , 0.92 , up to 1.00",
    ". then 0.84@xmath10.91 must be `` fully occupied '' and 0.64@xmath10.70 must be treated as `` not fully occupied '' to give the mentioned oxidation states .",
    "the atomic moments are calculated as 1.35 @xmath47 and 0.54 @xmath47 versus the idealized values of 2 and 0 @xmath47 respectively .",
    "the atomic - orbital projected density of states ( pdos ) , presented earlier,@xcite is reproduced in fig .",
    "[ ni1ni2pdos ] .",
    "the larger moment on ni1 arises almost equally from more majority states centered at -0.5 ev ( an expected difference , near e@xmath48 ) and less minority states near -5 ev ( an unexpected change in the strongly bound part of the spectrum ) .",
    "the amount of _ unoccupied _ @xmath5 spectral density does not differ much between ni1 and ni2 , unlike the formal picture would suggest ( a factor of two ) but it is consistent with our finding of no difference of @xmath5 occupation .",
    "the difference lies in the spin and energetic distribution .",
    "the `` charge state '' picture thus is murky : the ionic radii are consistent with full disproportionation @xmath49=1 whereas other data ( see below ) are used to justify @xmath49=0.3 as the best value .",
    "the spin - orbital occupation eigenvalues and the pdos are hardly definitive .",
    "very often the contrasting core level energies of different sites are used to identify and specify charge states , and this has been done for a few nickelates . in our earlier",
    "paper@xcite we pointed out that these on - site energies are given well by dft calculations , and thus are due to the differing environments rather than to any difference in local charge .      in charge order transformation phenomenology , or more broadly for the specification of the oxidation state , the real cation charge ",
    "the @xmath5 occupancy  is a peripheral , many say irrelevant as mentioned above , issue , and our specification of @xmath5 occupation reinforces that picture .",
    "however , the charge state _ language _ invites  in essence , requires ",
    "an interpretation of selected spin - orbitals to account for differences in the different sites .",
    "the ordered state of @xmath50nio@xmath6 , which contains roughly symmetric nio@xmath22 octahedra of substantially different size , can not be understood in terms of an @xmath36 ion which should have strong jt tendencies , hence the conventional `` charge order '' designation .",
    "this picture would have the driving mechanism , the entropy frozen out at the transition , be due to charges hopping amongst disordered ni@xmath51 and ni@xmath52 sites .",
    "mazin _ et al._@xcite observed that a fully disproportionated `` high spin @xmath53 , no spin @xmath54 '' picture accounts for ( 1 ) the lack of jt distortion and ( 2 ) the large and small ni moments .",
    "they confined their attention to the ordered phase ( ground state ) .",
    "the large and small octahedra , expected on the basis of differences in ionic radii for distinct charge states , does not have any quantitative explanation  in any picture  for ions of identical charge and radial extent .",
    "they further suggested that the hund s rule magnetic energy is important in producing these configurations . our earlier work established that there is _ negligible _ actual @xmath5 occupation difference between ni1 and ni2 , which seems to leave the search for the true microscopic driving force between the charge transfer energy , hund s rule energy , and electron - lattice coupling , and the change in kinetic energy that results from the latter two and modulated by the former .",

    "the entropy is due to fluctuating local breathing modes that freeze in at the transition .    in the ordered phase , the coherent alternation of distortions  a nonzero amplitude of the zone boundary breathing mode , to use common language  opens a gap in the band structure and",
    "the material becomes a ( correlated ) insulator .",
    "the transition can be approached from the opposite direction : the ordered phase is a small - gap mott insulator as long as the structural distortion is coherent , but loss of the coherence smears the gap and leads to a very bad metal but conducting phase . from either viewpoint , the transition is at the most basic level an order - disorder transition , rendered more complex than most by the electronic correlation effects .",
    "the breathing distortion modulates the ni @xmath5 on - site energy , and hence modulates the charge transfer energy between the o subsystem and each ni site .",
    "jt distortions , on the other hand , retain the mean ni - o distance and do not modulate the @xmath5 on - site energy significantly .      in our previous report@xcite we noted two additional charge - order systems for which there is no difference in @xmath5 occupation of the `` charge ordered '' cations .    _",

    "yang and collaborators@xcite noted from their dft calculations that no meaningful ( i.e. discernible ) difference in real fe @xmath5 charge ( which they identified as around 5.1 electrons ) could be obtained , which led them to categorize the ordered state in terms of ligand holes , @xmath56 + @xmath57 rather than as fe@xmath8 + fe@xmath45 .",
    "the difference in fe - o distance changes the hybridization considerably , and the resulting difference in hyperfine field that they calculated agreed well with the experimental data .    _",

    "the structural transition at 365 k in this triangular lattice compound is not first order but instead continuous , and moreover it is not a mit but rather a ( semi)metal to ( semi)metal transition , so agnio@xmath4 belongs to a separate class from the systems discussed above .",

    "the objectivity and generality of this viewpoint remains to be tested , and there are cases such as the @xmath50nio@xmath6 nickelates where the resulting picture seems less than convincing even with wannier functions in mind .",

    "returning to another underlying motivation  the faithful modeling of `` charge ordering '' transitions ",

    "the answer is that this seems not to be the right question .",
    "the challenge is different : in a wannier function basis of @xmath5 orbitals the most transparent local orbital basis , with occupations one or zero , is different on either side of the transition  the environment is instrumental in characterizing the charge state . the difference can be seen in several ways , but most clearly by the observation that the @xmath5 occupation would differ ( by order unity , the difference in occupations ) if they were not considerably different .",
    "a physical local orbital description on each side of the transition is simple only if substantially different local orbitals are used on either side .",
    "a basis sufficient to enable both representations is the set of all @xmath5 and @xmath41 orbitals ( other orbitals are out of the picture ) ; a single simple @xmath33 or t@xmath82 basis lacks the necessary flexibility .",
    "the issue is not what terms are in the hamiltonian so much as that a good minimal basis on one side of the transition is a poor , insufficient one on the other .",
    "einstein is said to have stated : `` a theory ( or model ) should be as simple as possible , but no simpler . ''",
    "the requisite basis set , until shown differently , is ( 1 ) the set of relevant atomic @xmath17 states on the open shell cation ( @xmath33 or @xmath55 when crystal field splitting is large , for example ) _ and _ ( 2 ) the active @xmath41 atomic orbitals on the ligand ( oxygen ) .",
    "these o functions are necessary because the o participation in a wannier function changes across the transition , and this is a crucial degree of freedom . the on - site repulsion @xmath25 is relevant due to its role in keeping the @xmath17 occupation fixed , but perhaps it can be thought of heuristically as a @xmath83 term as far as the mean field physics is concerned .",
    "cation - ligand hopping terms and cation - ligand coulomb energies , both distance - dependent , must be important . the on - site energy difference ( `` charge transfer '' energy @xmath84 ) of a reference state ( the high symmetry structure ) is important in determining the character of the wannier functions , and hund s rule energy is a relevant factor .    setting up and carrying out fruitful modeling is a task for the future .",
    "a fundamental question remains : why does a given charge state  occupation of a specific type of wannier orbitals  lead to a reasonably well defined ionic radius , rather than a continuum depending on the environment  why are ionic radii ` quantized ? '",
    "more broadly stated : why does the conventional charge state picture function so usefully , when @xmath5 ( or @xmath63 ) charge is not involved  both cation and anion charges are unchanged?@xcite an understanding of `` charge ordering '' transitions may require an answer to this question .",
