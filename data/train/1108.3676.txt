    "an important open question in topology is whether the mapping class group of a surface with boundary is linear . in [ [ faithful ] ]",
    ", the authors use the tools of bordered heegaard floer homology to answer a categorifed version of this question , showing that the mapping class group of a surface with boundary @xmath0 acts faithfully on a finitely - generated linear category . specifically , the category is the derived category of finitely - generated left @xmath1-modules , where @xmath1 is an algebra associated to the surface @xmath0 .",
    "there is also a standard bimodule @xmath2 , and a version @xmath3 of the tensor product , which lets us define a bimodule @xmath4 .",
    "the action comes from assigning to @xmath5 the functor @xmath6 and then passing to the derived category .",
    "the bimodule @xmath7 can be defined in terms of curves on @xmath0 and polygons formed between them , and this gives very concrete geometric interpretations to the results involved .",
    "incidentally , @xmath7 is not actually an ordinary bimodule but a more general @xmath8-bimodule , and checking @xmath8 identities tends to involve verifiying infinitely many relations .",
    "while [ [ faithful ] ] gives combinatorial definition of the bimodules @xmath7 , it refers proofs about their structure to [ [ bimodules],[lot10c ] ] , which rely on hard analysis . in this paper",
    "we give completely combinatorial proofs of the main results in [ [ faithful ] ] in terms of polygons and operations on them . in light of [ [ auroux ] ] , it is interesting to compare our results with [ [ abouzaid ] ] .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ some definitions ]",
    "we define some of the basic objects that will be used throughout the paper , especially @xmath8-algebras and modules , and we define @xmath1 and @xmath7 . in section [ some preliminary results ] we prove some foundational results :    @xmath9 is a @xmath10-@xmath11 @xmath8-bimodule .",
    "let @xmath12 and @xmath13 be diffeomorphisms representing the same element of @xmath14 . then @xmath15 and @xmath16 are homotopy equivalent as @xmath8-bimodules .    in section [ the main result ]",
    "we give the key ingredient for an action :    the bimodules @xmath17 and @xmath18 are @xmath8-homotopy equivalent .",
    "we then complete the proof by showing that the identity mapping class gives the identity functor and that the action is faithful :    [ identityisidentity ] @xmath19 is isomorphic as a type da bimodule to @xmath20 .",
    "if @xmath21 is quasi - isomorphic to @xmath20 , then @xmath22 is isotopic to @xmath23 .",

    "we begin by defining @xmath8-algebras , and @xmath8-bimodules over @xmath8-algebras .",
    "these are like associative algebras and ordinary differential bimodules except with associativity replaced by a weaker condition involving infinitely many terms .",

    ". then ( [ countingsigmashortchords ] ) follows by noting that the number of left endpoints of components of @xmath824 is @xmath828 , whereas the number of right endpoints is @xmath829 .",
    "first observe that @xmath19 has one generator @xmath830 for each idempotent @xmath65 of @xmath11 , and hence its generators are in a natural bijective correspondence with the generators of @xmath20 .",

    ". since the left inputs of the @xmath132 in the diagram are short chords , we must have @xmath834 by ( [ countingsigmashortchords ] ) of lemma [ possibleshortchords ] .",
    "thus it suffices to show that there is a unique polygon @xmath835 with initial point @xmath324 passing through entirely short chords on the left and @xmath836 on the right , and that @xmath126 fits into a diagram of the form ( [ twopartdiagram ] ) .",
