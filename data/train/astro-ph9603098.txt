    "rapid periodic oscillations are observed in the optical flux of high accretion rate ( `` high-@xmath3 '' ) cataclysmic variables ( cvs ; nova - like variables and dwarf novae in outburst ) ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) these oscillations have high coherence ( @xmath4@xmath5 ) , periods @xmath630  s , amplitudes of less than 0.5% , and are sinusoidal to within the limits of measurement .",
    "they are referred to as `` dwarf nova oscillations '' ( dnos ) to distinguish them from the apparently distinct longer period , low coherence ( @xmath7@xmath8 ) quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) of high-@xmath9 cvs , and the longer period , high coherence ( @xmath10@xmath11 ) oscillations of dq  her stars .",
    "dnos have never been detected in dwarf novae in quiescence , despite extensive searches ; they appear on the rising branch of the dwarf nova outburst , typically persist through maximum , and disappear on the declining branch of the outburst .",
    "the period of the oscillation decreases on the rising branch and increases on the declining branch , but because the period reaches a minimum about one day after maximum optical flux , dwarf novae describe a loop in a plot of period versus optical flux .",
    "the dwarf nova ss  cygni routinely exhibits dnos during outburst .",
    "optical oscillations have been detected at various times with periods ranging from 8.2  s to 10.9  s ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . during one outburst ,",
    "the period was observed over a interval of @xmath12 days to fall from 7.5  s to 7.3  s and then rise to 8.5  s ( @xcite ) . at soft x - ray energies ( @xmath130.5 kev ) ,",
    "oscillations have been detected in led  1 data at periods of @xmath14  s and 11  s ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and in _ exosat _ le data at periods between 7.4  s and 10.4  s ( @xcite ) . in this letter",
    ", we describe observations with the _ extreme ultraviolet explorer _ satellite ( _ euve _ ; @xcite ; @xcite ) of the euv oscillations of ss  cyg .",
    "target - of - opportunity observations of ss  cyg in outburst were made with _ euve _ in 1993 august ( mjd 9216.58 to 9223.12 ; @xmath15 ) and 1994 june / july ( mjd 9526.67 to 9529.78 and 9532.54 to 9536.94 ) .",
    "on both occasions , ss  cyg was detected with the _ euve _ deep survey ( ds ) photometer and short wavelength ( sw ) spectrometer .",
    "the optical and ds count rate light curves of the outbursts are shown in figure  1 of mauche ( 1996a ) . on both occasions ,",
    "the optical flux was above @xmath16 for @xmath17 days , but the 1993 outburst was anomalous in that it took @xmath18 days for the light curve to reach maximum , whereas typical outbursts ( such as the 1994 outburst ) reach maximum in 1 to 2 days .",
    "the euv light curve of the 1993 outburst rose more quickly than the optical , and the rise of the euv light curve of the 1994 outburst was delayed by @xmath19 day relative to the optical . on both occasions , the euv spectrum evolved homologously over roughly two orders of magnitude in luminosity .",
    "the euv spectrum is very complex , but it can be very crudely approximated by a blackbody with a temperature of @xmath2030  ev absorbed by a neutral hydrogen column density of @xmath21@xmath22 ( @xcite ) .    to detect oscillations in the euv flux of ss  cyg",
    ", we proceeded as follows .",
    "first , we selected valid intervals when the source was above the earth s limb and both the ds and sw instruments were in operation .",
    "only those intervals longer than 600  s were retained for further consideration . for the 1993 ( 1994 ) observations , 89 ( 75 )",
    "valid intervals were defined with a net time of 155 ( 103 ) kiloseconds .",
    "second , we calculated the background - subtracted count rate in the ds and sw instruments for each of the valid time intervals . for the sw instrument , only those photons between 75 and 120    were included in the sum ; above and below these limits , the spectrum is dominated by noise ( @xcite ) .",
    "third , for each of the valid time intervals , we constructed background - subtracted ds count rate light curves with 1  s time resolution .",
    "fourth , we calculated the power spectra of these light curves using the xronos software package .",
    "as with the _ heao-1 _ ( @xcite ) and _ exosat _ ( @xcite ) soft x - ray power spectra , typical _ euve _ power spectra consist of a single line in a single frequency bin , with no power above the noise at any of the harmonics ( @xcite ) .",
    "from this result , we understand that the euv oscillation is ( a ) sinusoidal and ( b ) essentially coherent ( @xmath23 ) over the @xmath24 min valid time intervals .",
    "the period of the oscillation is then simply the inverse of the frequency of the bin of the power spectrum with the peak power , and its error is less than the bin width of @xmath25  s. fifth , we calculated the amplitude of the oscillation during each valid time interval by phase - folding the data on the period appropriate to that interval and fitting a function of the form @xmath26 where @xmath27 .",
    "the relative amplitude @xmath28 was @xmath29 during the 1993 outburst and @xmath30 during the 1994 outburst , with a tendency in the 1994 data for the relative amplitude to decrease as the count rate increased .",
    "these amplitudes are comparable to those of the soft x - ray oscillations measured by _ heao-1 _",
    "( @xcite ) and _ exosat _ ( @xcite ) .",
    "the period of the euv oscillation of ss  cyg detected by the above means is plotted as a function of time in figure  1 . for the 1993 outburst",
    ", the oscillation turned on during the rise to outburst on mjd 9218.77 ; its period was initially 9.31  s , fell over the next @xmath31 days to @xmath32  s , and then asymptotically approached @xmath33  s over the next few days .",
    "for the 1994 outburst , the oscillation turned on during the fast rise to outburst on mjd 9528.06 ; its period was initially 8.90  s , fell to 7.19  s ( the shortest period ever observed in ss  cyg , or in any other dwarf nova ) within less than a day , and rebounded to 7.42  s by the end of the observation on mjd 9529.77 .",
    "when observations resumed 2.8 days later , the period of the oscillation was 7.59  s and rose slowly over the next few days to @xmath34  s. on both occasions , the oscillations switched on when the sw count rate was @xmath35 or when the ds count rate was @xmath36 ( @xcite ) . for a coherent oscillation to be detected below this count rate ,",
    "its amplitude must be @xmath37 .",
    "superposed on figure  1 is the log of the 75120    sw count rate as a function of time .",
    "it is clear from this figure that the period of the oscillation anti - correlates with the sw count rate , being long when the count rate is low and short when the count rate is high . to quantify this trend , we plot in figure  2 the log of the period of the oscillation as a function of the log of the sw count rate .",
    "the solid line connects the points chronologically starting in the upper left - hand corner .",
    "the upper panel of the figure shows the slow evolution of the period from 9.3  s to 7.5  s during the 1993 outburst .",
    "the lower panel shows the initial rapid evolution of the period during the 1994 outburst as the period fell from 8.9  s to 7.2  s and then rose to 8.0  s. two aspects of this plot require immediate comment .",
    "first , despite the vastly different rate at which the period evolved in this diagram during the 1993 and 1994 outbursts , the slope and normalization of the trend of period with sw count rate is to first order the same . using a function of the form @xmath38 , where @xmath1 is the 75120    sw count rate , the combined data is fit with parameters @xmath39  s and @xmath40 if the errors on the period are set to produce @xmath41 , but a more realistic estimate for the exponent is @xmath42 .",
    "second , there is no `` hysteresis '' in the trajectory of the 1994 outburst ",
    "it doubles back on itself instead of `` looping , '' as do plots of the period of optical dnos versus optical flux ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this figure makes clear that to first order the period of the euv dnos of ss  cyg is determined solely by the sw count rate .",
    "because the sw spectrum does not change during the observations , the bolometric correction for the euv flux is fixed .",
    "we conclude that the period of the euv dnos of ss  cyg is determined by the euv / soft x - ray luminosity , and , by inference , by the mass - accretion rate onto the white dwarf .",
    "yet another conclusion follows from the above result that the period of the euv dnos of ss  cyg is a single - valued function of the euv flux .",
    "optical and euv light curves of ss  cyg ( @xcite ) , u  gem ( @xcite ) , and vw  hyi ( @xcite ) demonstrate not only the well - know result that the optical flux leads the euv flux by @xmath43 day on the rise to outburst , but that the optical flux lags the euv flux on the decline from outburst . with the ( as - yet unproven ! ) assumption that the period of the optical and euv dnos are equal",
    ", the looping trajectory of the period of optical dnos versus optical flux is understood to be simply due to the time - dependent lead / lag of the optical flux relative to the euv flux , and , by extension , the mass - accretion rate onto the white dwarf .",
    "[ quite happily , just such an effect is predicted by the accretion disk limit cycle mechanism for dwarf nova outbursts ( see , e.g. , figure 13 of @xcite ) . ] this result , combined with the high coherence , amplitude , and luminosity of the euv dnos , strongly supports the long - held belief that the optical dnos are produced by reprocessing of the euv dnos .",
    "many models have been considered to explain the dnos of high-@xmath3 cvs ( @xcite ) .",
    "the low period stability of the oscillations rules out the rotating white dwarf ( the dq  her mechanism ) as well as non - radial pulsations of the white dwarf as the cause of the oscillations ; pulsations are observed in high inclination systems , ruling out the eclipse by the white dwarf of luminous blobs of material in the inner disk and boundary layer ; r - modes and trapped g - modes fail because more than one mode would be excited ; oscillations of the accretion disk fail because they are not confined to a particular annulus and hence to a particular period .",
    "viable mechanisms are more difficult to construct .",
    "warner & livio ( 1996 ) propose that the oscillations are due to the combined action of the differentially rotating surface layers of the white dwarf and magnetically controlled accretion .",
    "despite any other indication that the white dwarf in ss  cyg is magnetic , we consider the requirements of a magnetospheric model for the dnos of ss  cyg .",
    "such a model has been recently applied by finger et  al .",
    "( 1996 ) to the quasi - periodic oscillations of the hard x - ray flux of the x - ray transient a0535 + 262 .",
    "the burst and transient source experiment onboard the _ compton gamma - ray observatory _ observed a `` giant '' outburst of a0535 during 1994 february 3 through march 20 .",
    "finger et  al .  applied a magnetospheric model to the pulsar in a0535 to explain the observed variations in the qpo frequency @xmath44 and spin - up rate of the neutron star .",
    "the rationale is a follows : the neutron star accretes through a disk ; the disk will be disrupted by the magnetic field of the pulsar at some radius @xmath45 ; the observed qpos will be generated by some mechanism at either ( a ) the keplerian frequency @xmath46 at @xmath45 or ( b ) the beat frequency @xmath47 between the keplerian frequency at @xmath45 and the spin frequency of the neutron star @xmath48 ; and torques on the magnetosphere interior and exterior to the corotation radius @xmath49^{1/3}$ ] will spin the neutron star up or down as @xmath45 varies with the mass - accretion rate . assuming a dipole magnetic field @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the dipole moment , and determining @xmath45 by conservation of angular momentum for a keplerian flow ( @xcite ) , @xmath52 where @xmath53 is a constant of order unity .",
    "hence , @xmath54 . with these relationships and a simple estimate for the accretion torque , finger et  al .  could fit the observed variations in the qpo frequency and neutron star spin - up rate as a function of the measured 20100  kev flux by identifying the qpo frequency with either @xmath55 or @xmath56 .",
    "specifically , @xmath57 over a variation of a factor of @xmath58 in the observed 20100  kev hard x - ray flux @xmath59 . for subsequent reference , we note here that for the parameters derived by finger et  al . , @xmath60 and , at the peak of the outburst , @xmath61 .",
    "with these values , the above equation gives @xmath62 neutron star radii .",
    "the strength of the magnetic field on the surface of the star is @xmath63  g and its value at @xmath45 is @xmath64  g.    whereas @xmath65 for a0535 , @xmath66 for ss  cyg . if a magnetospheric model applies to ss  cyg as it does to a0535 , why is the variation of the dno frequency such a weak function of the euv flux ?",
    "variations in the bolometric correction relating the observed euv flux to the euv / soft x - ray luminosity and hence to @xmath3 are ruled out because the euv spectrum does not change throughout the outburst .",
    "two alternatives exist , both of which appeal to different scalings of @xmath45 with @xmath3 than shown above : @xmath67 where @xmath68 .",
    "the first alternative involves the accretion disk .",
    "ghosh ( 1996 ) considered four standard disk models and found @xmath69 for a one - temperature , optically thick , radiation pressure dominated disk ; @xmath70 for a one - temperature , optically thick , gas pressure dominated disk ; and larger values of @xmath71 for more exotic two - temperature optically thin disks .",
    "the data for a0535 are well fit by the scaling for the one - temperature , optically thick , gas pressure dominated disk : @xmath72 , hence @xmath73 .",
    "although a one - temperature , optically thick , radiation pressure dominated disk gives a weaker scaling for @xmath74 with @xmath3 , it is very unlikely that such a model describes the disks of high-@xmath3 cvs .",
    "if the structure of the inner disk of ss  cyg does not differ significantly from that of a0535 , perhaps the structure of its magnetosphere does .",
    "the weak dependence of the frequency of the dnos of ss  cyg on euv flux suggests that the magnetosphere of ss  cyg is `` stiffer '' than the dipole magnetosphere of a0535 .",
    "assuming instead of a dipole magnetic field a single star - centered multipole field @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the multipole moment ( @xcite ) , @xmath77 hence , @xmath78 . to match the observed behavior of ss  cyg , we require @xmath79 . at the peak of the outburst ,",
    "the euv / soft x - ray luminosity of ss  cyg is @xmath80 for @xmath81  ev ( @xcite ) , hence @xmath82 , where we have used @xmath83 and @xmath84  cm . identifying @xmath85 with @xmath55 , @xmath86 white dwarf radii (",
    "if instead we had used @xmath87 , for which @xmath88  cm , @xmath89 white dwarf radii ; the magnetosphere is crushed to the surface of the white dwarf ) . with these values and the above equation",
    ", the strength of the magnetic field at @xmath45 is @xmath90  g ( independent of @xmath91 ! ) and its value on the surface of the white dwarf is @xmath92  g.    a surface magnetic field strength of 0.11  mg is sufficiently low to be impossible to detect directly . in the presence of the light from the disk and secondary , field strengths below @xmath935  mg are undetectable via circular polarization measurements in the optical or infrared ( @xcite ) .",
    "direct detection of the cyclotron harmonics is difficult because the cyclotron fundamental is at @xmath94  mm .",
    "zeeman splitting broadens spectral lines by a measurable @xmath95 , but stark broadening is significant in the high - temperature , high - density photosphere of the white dwarf , and the disk contributes lines with doppler widths @xmath96 .",
    "furthermore , unlike some other dwarf novae ( e.g. , u  gem , vw  hyi ) , the white dwarf in ss  cyg is not observed above the disk and secondary during quiescence , even in the uv .    of more concern",
    "is the high order required of the multipole magnetic field .",
    "this comes about because of the weak dependence of the frequency of the dnos of ss  cyg on euv flux and , by inference , the slow variation of @xmath45 with @xmath97 .",
    "we have produced this slow variation by increasing the sensitivity of the magnetic field strength on radius : @xmath75 with @xmath98 instead of the usual expression with @xmath99 . in general ,",
    "the magnetic field can be expressed as an infinite sum of multipoles : @xmath100 .",
    "the behavior of ss  cyg requires that at @xmath45 the strength of the @xmath98 multipole component of the magnetic field be significantly greater than the sum of all other components : @xmath101 for @xmath102 .",
    "this condition is quite restrictive , as it requires that the corresponding surface fields @xmath103 .",
    "it is unlikely that such a strong inversion in the distribution of multipole components arises naturally  the topology of the currents required to produce such a field would be complex , to say the least .",
    "it is much more likely that the intrinsic magnetic field of the white dwarf of ss  cyg is a low - order multipole .",
    "the magnetic fields of am her stars are predominantly dipolar , though often the field strengths at the two poles are not equal , indicating that the dipole is off - center or equivalently that a few higher order terms enter into the expansion of the field . if the intrinsic magnetic field of ss  cyg is similarly predominantly dipolar , we need to explain why its magnetosphere behaves so much more `` stiffly '' than a dipole .",
    "a clue comes from the relative sizes of the magnetospheres of ss  cyg and a0535 . in the latter",
    ", the magnetosphere extends to @xmath104 stellar radii at the peak of the outburst , while in the former it extends to only @xmath105 stellar radii .",
    "suppose that the accretion disk of ss  cyg is sufficiently diamagnetic as to exclude a significant fraction of the magnetic field of the white dwarf . during the outburst",
    ", the magnetosphere will be pinched inward by the accretion disk as the mass - accretion rate increases and the inner edge of the disk moves inward . trapped in the orbital plane between the inner edge of the disk at @xmath45 and the surface of the white dwarf at @xmath106 ,",
    "the magnetosphere will become significantly distorted if the ratio @xmath107 becomes small , as it does in ss  cyg . expressing the distorted field as a sum of multipoles",
    ", it is clear that higher - order terms will become more and more important as the field is increasingly distorted .",
    "we do not imagine that the @xmath98 term ever actually dominates the multipole expansion of the field , but that the magnetosphere comes to behave as if it did . in the context of the simply theory behind equation ( 1 ) , we require simply that conditions conspire to produce @xmath108 with @xmath98 . our derived value of @xmath109  g should still be a reasonable estimate , but the extrapolation of the strength of the field from @xmath45 to the surface of the white dwarf is very uncertain .",
    "the simply scaling gives @xmath110  g for @xmath111 , but this can be considered only an order - of - magnitude estimate .",
    "if a magnetospheric model applies to ss  cyg , it appears likely that the surface magnetic field strength of its white dwarf is 0.11  mg .",
    "this range of values is orders of magnitude lower than the field strengths of am  her stars ( @xmath11280  mg ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , but may overlap with the field strengths of dq  her stars ( very uncertain , by @xmath11310  mg ; @xcite ) .",
    "with such a field strength , it is a challenge for ss  cyg in quiescence not to manifest the photometric variations associated with dq  her stars ; the limit on such variations in the optical is 0.001 mag ( @xmath114 ) near 0.1  hz ( @xcite ) . in outburst",
    ", the accretion flow should be channeled down to the footpoints of the magnetic field and produce hard and soft x - rays in the manner of am  her and dq  her stars . however , neither the eponymous dq  her nor v533  her are hard x - ray sources ( @xcite ) , demonstrating that magnetic accretion can take place without the production of hard x - rays . while ss  cyg in outburst is a _ known _ hard x - ray source ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , it is _ not _ known to oscillate in hard x - rays ; the limit is 6% when soft x - ray oscillations were observed by _",

    "xte _ observations are required .",
    "planned simultaneous observations of ss  cyg in outburst with _",
    "xte _ and _ euve _ will determine the shapes of the hard and soft x - ray light curves , the correlations between the soft and hard x - ray fluxes , and the extent to which the oscillations in the soft x - ray flux are manifest in the hard x - ray flux .",
    "the _ euve _ observations of ss  cyg could not have been accomplished without the efforts of the members , staff , and director , j.  mattei , of the american association of variable star observers ; _ euve _ deputy project scientist ron oliversen ; and the staffs of the center for euv astrophysics ( cea ) , the _ euve _ science operations center at cea , and the flight operations team at goddard space flight center .",
