    "in the standard evolutionary scheme , of stars are the progenitors of wolf - rayet stars .",
    "as the star evolves into the supergiant phase , its stellar wind becomes stronger , which translates in some lines appearing in strong emission in the optical spectrum ( heii @xmath2 4686 , h@xmath4 ... ) . on the other hand ,",
    "wr stars are characterized by strong emission lines , also related to their strong and dense winds .",
    "the similarities in the spectral morphology in the optical domain of these two classes of stars is a well - established fact for several decades @xcite . in this context",
    ", @xcite discussed the similarities between the k - band spectra of the o4if@xmath0 stars hd16691 and hd190429a , and those of wolf - rayet stars .",
    "the latter authors pointed out the _ connection in the spectral morphology between some early of and wn stars _",
    "likely attributable to an evolutionary relationship .",
    "another star worth considering in the same framework is the bright o4if@xmath0 star hd15570 , member of the open cluster ic1805 , that has been qualified as transitional by @xcite on the basis of its uv spectral properties .",
    "in addition , @xcite reported on the probable presence around hd16691 and hd14947 ( o5if@xmath0 ) of interstellar bubbles that are very similar in shape to other bubbles surrounding wr stars .",
    "if one wants to address the issue of the dynamics of the quite extreme stellar winds of such transitional objects , variability studies are likely to bring crucial information . in their study of the line profile variations of h@xmath4 , @xcite reported on significant variations in the case of hd190429a , hd14947 and hd16691 .",
    "even though their time series were limited to only a few spectra , they pointed out some similarities in the spectral shape and in the behaviour of these stars .",
    "they also noted that the lack of significant line profile variability in other lines such as heii @xmath2 6527 suggests that the variations in h@xmath4 were probably due to processes in the wind .",
    "however , to investigate in detail such a line profile variability , a very good time sampling is required .    in the context of the present study",
    ", we focus on three targets : hd14947 , hd16691 and hd15570 .",
    "the latter one has already been investigated by @xcite , but the time series was not well suited for the study of short time scale variations , i.e. of the order of the day or shorter .",
    "the significantly improved time series presented here are used to more adequately characterize the line profile variability of our three targets .",
    "we first discuss the optical spectrum of the stars ( section[spec ] ) .",
    "the main part of the paper consists in a detailed description of the variability study ( section[res ] ) , followed by a discussion in section[disc ] .",
    "our conclusions are presented in section[conc ] .",
    "spectroscopic observations were collected at the observatoire de haute - provence ( ohp , france ) during several observing runs from october 2004 to autumn 2007 .",
    "all spectra were obtained with the aurlie spectrograph fed by the 1.52 m telescope @xcite , using the same setup as described for instance by @xcite .",
    "our collection of spectra is described in table[runs ] , and the detailed journal of the observations is given in table[log ] .",
    "the typical exposure time was about 30  45 minutes , depending on the weather conditions . in order to carry out a detailed variability study of our targets , we organized the observing campaign in such a way that we covered time scales from a few hours up to a few years . in total , we obtained 57 , 64 and 64 blue spectra between 4450 and 4900 respectively for hd14947 , hd15570 and hd16691 .",
    "in addition , in october 2005 , we otained 7 , 5 and 6 red spectra between 6340 and 6780 respectively for the three targets spread over a few days .",
    "the resolving power is about 8000 in the blue , and 11000 in the red .",
    "all data were treated following the reduction procedure already described by @xcite .",

    "we note that this observing campaign ended in october - november 2007 , with a 28 consecutive nights of observation .",
    "the latter observing run allowed us to obtain a very good sampling of shorter time - scales , that turned out to be critical in the context of the variability study of our targets . as we were intending to study the variability in line profiles , we focused on high quality spectra with high signal - to - noise ratios , in most cases significantly higher than 200 ( see table[runs ] ) .",

    "once again , we clarified the situation by considering only the 2007 data set . in this case , the power spectrum is dominated by two components : a poorly constrained long term trend ( with essentially its @xmath10 alias ) may be related to the timespan of the data collected in 2007 , of the order of 11 days .",
    "] , and a series of peaks at @xmath11 = @xmath12 + @xmath13 ( @xmath12 being close to 0.37d@xmath7 ) , with a highest peak for @xmath13 equal to 1 and to 2 respectively for h@xmath3 and heii @xmath2 4686 ( along with their aliases at @xmath14 ) .",
    "this situation is illustrated in figure[fourheh15570 ] , where the result of successive prewhitening with two frequencies is shown for heii @xmath2 4686 ( left part ) and h@xmath3 ( right part ) . even though we scrupulously selected the highest peaks to prepare figure[fourheh15570 ] , it should be noted that we obtain very similar results with frequencies close to 1.37 and 2.37@xmath15 ( corresponding respectively to time scales of 17.5 and 10.1h ) .",
    "this is not unexpected as the corresponding peaks have very similar amplitudes .",
    "our temporal sampling seems inadequate to discriminate between these two frequencies . when considering the complete time series , the time scale of about 17.5h is clearly preferred .",
    "however , it should be noted that the power spectrum of the complete time series is strongly affected by non physical peaks ( see above ) which could bias the relative amplitudes of other peaks .",
    "we finally note that the residual power spectra shown in figure[fourheh15570 ] present families of low amplitude peaks at frequencies slightly different from those of the main family reported above .        considering the rather short time",
    "scales reported above , one may wonder whether spectra collected during a same night show clear variations .",
    "the tvs technique applied to reduced times series containing 4 spectra spread over maximum 6 hours revealed indeed significant variations for most of the nights where several spectra were obtained .",
    "this lends some support to the idea that at least a part of the behaviour of the line profiles of hd15570 is ruled by a process occurring on time - scales shorter than a day .",
    "we detect a significant variability in the profiles of all the strongest lines in the blue spectrum , as well as in h@xmath4 .",
    "the tvs presents a triple peaked structure , whilst a double peaked structure was observed for the two other stars investigated in our study .",
    "the most spectacular variations are observed in the case of heii @xmath2 4686 and h@xmath4 . in the case of the heii @xmath2 4686 and h@xmath3 lines , the variability reaches its highest level in the red part of the profile .",
    "the variations in the profile of these two lines are remarkably correlated .",
    "the inspection of the spectra suggests that at least two components are present in this heii line ( see individual profiles in figure[tvs ] ) .",
    "however , the asymmetry of the profile remains unchanged all along our time series in the sense that the more intense part of the profile is always found on the red side .",
    "it should be noted that the variations observed in heii @xmath2 4686 , h@xmath3 and h@xmath4 are very similar to those observed in the case of hd14947 and hd15570 , but with a much higher amplitude .",
    "the investigation of the niii lines at 4634 and 4641 strongly suggests that two doublets are present . in order to illustrate this",
    ", we have overplotted the niii complex profile observed on hjd2453295.616 ( # 4 in table[log ] ) to a synthetic profile made of two shifted pairs of gaussians superimposed on a broad bump similar to that observed in actual data .",
    "the two horizontal lines below the profile in the upper panel of figrure[nitrogen ] illustrate the wavelength interval between two gaussians in a given pair .",
    "this interval has been fixed at a constant value of about 7 in all fits , in agreement with the expected separation between niii lines respectively at 4634 and 4641 .",
    "the agreement between the observed profile and the synthetic one strongly suggests that two shifted niii doublets are present , or maybe that the two niii lines present a double peaked shape similar to that expected e.g. for a rotating disk .",
    "the power spectrum of the complete time series ( 64 blue spectra ) reveals a dominant peak at a frequency of 0.505d@xmath7 ( corresponding to a time scale of 1.98d ) for heii @xmath2 4542 , niii @xmath2 4634 , niii @xmath2 4641 , heii @xmath2 4686 and h@xmath3 ( see figure[four16691 ] ) .",
    "we repeated the analysis on the 2007 data set ( 46 blue spectra ) and we obtained periodograms dominated by the same frequency . prewhitening with this frequency yields excellent results , as can be seen in figure[four16691 ] for the complete data set , except for the niii lines where significant residuals are present in the middle panel .",
    "we note that frequencies close to this one were already detected , though with some ambiguity , using the data set made of spectra from 2004 to 2006 ( only 18 spectra ) .",
    "the gathering of more data , mostly with a better sampling of short time - scales , tends to confirm that a stable clock with a period of about 2d is ruling the strong variability observed in the blue spectrum of hd16691 .",
    "considering the results presented in section[res ] , we can formulate a series of remarks about the behaviour of our three sample stars .",
    "the various points worth noting can be separated in similarities and differences .",
    "first , we consider the following common features in the temporal behaviour of the three stars , in addition to the similarities of the mean spectrum already enumerated in section[spec ] :    1 .",
    "the main variations are observed for heii @xmath2 4686 , h@xmath3 and h@xmath4 .",
    "the variations of heii @xmath2 4686 consist mainly in an alternating amplification and reduction of its asymmetry .",
    "a similar variation of the profile asymmetry is observed in the absorption component of h@xmath3 , with a multi - component tvs whose amplitude is stronger on the red side .",
    "the variations in the profile of heii @xmath2 4686 and h@xmath3 are correlated , both in time - scale and in morphology ( the amplification of the asymmetry occurs at the same time in both lines ) .    on the other hand ,",
    "significant differences are found in the behaviour of the spectral lines investigated in this study :    1 .",
    "hd16691 is clearly the most variable star of our sample , both in the amplitude of the variations and in the ubiquity of its variability .",
    "significant variations are indeed observed in all the prominent lines we investigated in the blue spectrum , and in h@xmath4 .",
    "its tvs presents a central contribution in addition to the two other ones found also in the other stars of our sample .",
    "2 .   hd14947 presents also some significant variations in the niii emission lines , but the same lines in the spectrum of hd15570 seem to be quite stable .",
    "3 .   the amplitude of the variations in the asymmetry of the heii @xmath2 4686 and h@xmath3 lines increases from hd14947 to hd15570 , to hd16691 . the latter one , in its extreme configuration , suggests a partial deblending of two main emission components contributing to the profile .",
    "the profile of the niii emission lines is rather confused in the case of hd16691 , and can be modelled as consisting of the blending of two pairs of lines .",
    "5 .   in the case of hd16691 , a stable and well - established variability time - scale is determined ( @xmath12d ) . for the other two stars ,",
    "a significant part of their behaviour appears to be determined by time - scales of about 7.2d and 17.5h ( or perhaps 10.1h ) respectively for hd14947 and hd15570 .",
    "however , these time - scales do not seem to represent completely the behaviour of their line profiles .      when confronted to a rather complex line profile variability",
    ", it may be a good starting point to disentangle the various components likely to contribute to these profiles . from this",
    ", the line profile variability may be investigated by varying some of these components in position or in intensity , in order to check what is the impact of this varying component on the line profile .    to perform such a simple morphological description of the line profile ( without hydrodynamic or radiative transfer code ) , we started with the following hypotheses :    1 .",
    "the line profiles can be split into a limited number of gaussian components , 2 .",
    "the parameters of each individual components can be tuned to reproduce the observed line profiles ( absorption , emission , or pcygni profiles ) .    in the case of h@xmath3 ,",
    "the pcygni profile is clearly dominated by its absorption component , except perhaps for hd16691 . in order to produce synthetic profiles similar to those observed for the stars considered in this study",
    ", we used a mathematical function such as equation1 in @xcite , with the required number of gaussians . for the pcygni profile",
    ", we used two gaussians shifted in wavelength with opposite signs .",
    "the h@xmath3 profile morphology of hd14947 and hd15570 can at first sight be reproduced using a pcygni component and an additional absorption ( or pcygni with a weak emission component ) to reproduce its asymmetry . for hd16691",
    ", there is a clear additional emission component seen on top of the profile in some spectra ( see e.g. # 32 in the lower right panel of figure[tvs ] ) .",
    "the result of the fit is shown in figure[fithbeta ] .",
    "this set of components fits the morphology of the h@xmath3 line quite well . for the heii line of hd16691 , we fitted the profiles using 4 components : 3 gaussians of similar widths and intensities representing emission components , and a broad emission component used to account approximately for the presence of the large underlying emission bump .",
    "we note that it was necessary to adapt the normalization factors of two components ( by about 10@xmath9 , sometimes more ) between the two configurations to obtain acceptable fits .",
    "the results of these fits are shown in figure[fitheii ] . in the case of hd14947 and hd15570 , we reproduced quite well the profiles using the same approach , but with somewhat lower amplitude spectral shifts of the gaussians from one spectrum to the other .     profile of hd16691 at two different epochs ( spectra # 1 and # 32 in table[log ] ) .",

    "the wavelengths are expressed in .[fithbeta],width=302 ]    , but for heii @xmath2 4686.[fitheii],width=302 ]    a strong contribution of the observed variations can be reproduced to some extent by varying the position of the lateral gaussians by at most a few tens of kms@xmath7 . however , the normalization of the gaussians had also to be adapted from one spectrum to the other at a level that is sometimes significantly larger than the expected level of variations related to normalization errors in that region of the blue spectrum .",
    "we caution however that the observed profiles are only approximately represented with gaussians .",
    "significant deviations from this simple representation are indeed observed in many spectra .",
    "we built minimum emission spectra for each star by assigning to each spectral resolution element the minimum flux value of the corresponding spectral bin among the spectra of the time series .",
    "we then substracted the minimum heii @xmath2 4686 and h@xmath3 profiles from each individual observed profile in our time series .",
    "the residuals reveal the spectral location where some excess flux is detected in the line , in addition to the minimum profile .",
    "the most striking results are obtained for hd16691 , as illustrated in figure[minspec ] . a large fraction of the heii profiles display double - peaked residuals , suggesting that a variable emitting volume contributes significantly both to the blue and to the red wings of the line , on top of a minimum broad emission .",
    "the typical separation between peaks in the residuals is of the order of 500kms@xmath7 , and their position seems to be rather stable in wavelength , with variations generally of at most 10 - 20kms@xmath7 from one observation to the other ( see the vertical lines on the left part of figure[minspec ] ) .",
    "however , in the case of some spectra , other excess components with higher amplitudes are also observed ( see e.g. the residual # 13 in the negative radial velocity part ) .",
    "it is also interesting to note that at several epochs , only the blue part of the line presents a significant excess with respect to the minimum profile .",
    "we do not observe such peaks with a striking velocity confinement in the case of h@xmath3 .",

    "residuals have been shifted vertically by a quantity of 0.12 units for the sake of clarity .",
    "the bottom scales corresponds to velocities expressed in kms@xmath7 .",
    "the number of the spectrum as defined in table[log ] is provided in each case . from the top to the bottom , these spectra correspond resptively to the arbitrary phases 0.00 , 0.10 , 0.20 , 0.27 , 0.45 , 0.50 , 0.59 , 0.69 , 0.81 and 0.93 . in the case of heii ,",
    "the two vertical lines ( respectively at 280 and 220kms@xmath7 ) emphasize the alignment of the peaks observed in the residuals of most of the profiles.[minspec],width=302 ]    , but for hd14947 .",
    "the five profiles whose residuals are plotted correspond to spectra number # 1 to # 5 , from the top to the bottom.[minspec2],width=302 ]    , but for hd15570.[minspec3],width=302 ]    hd14947 and hd15570 have in common to present the bulk of their excess with respect to the minimum emission profiles generally only on one side of the profile : at null or slightly negative velocities for the heii line , and at null or slightly positive velocities for h@xmath3 in those examaples illustrated in figures[minspec2 ] and [ minspec3 ] .",
    "we note that lower amplitudes excesses are also measured at other radial velocities , but with a much lower amplitude .",
    "this agrees with the shape of the tvs plotted in figure[tvs ] for these two stars .",
    "this could indicate that the mmaterial that produces an extra ( blueshifted ) heii @xmath2 4686 emission simultaneously produces an extra h@xmath3 absorption .",
    "the main difference between these two stars comes from the fact that the residuals are more peaked and regular in the case of hd15570 . for the latter star ,",
    "the peak in the residuals of h@xmath3 seems to be quite stable in wavelength .",
    "significant line profile variations may be the signature of a binary system .",
    "for instance , we mention the case of the very massive binary wr20a @xcite whose heii @xmath2 4686 profiles are similar to those observed in the case of the three stars investigated in this study . in order to check the viability of such a scenario",
    ", we had a look at absorption lines less likely to be affected by wind emission to search for radial velocity excursions attributable to an orbital motion .",
    "in addition , we also searched for a periodic variation of the width of the line profile , simultaneously with a variation of its depth .",
    "as we are dealing with early - type stars , hei lines are rather weak .",
    "we will thus focus on the heii line at 4542 .",
    "we measured the radial velocities of heii @xmath2 4542 by fitting gaussians to the line profiles . in the case of hd14947",
    ", we obtain a mean radial velocity for the complete time series of 32.1@xmath177.1kms@xmath7 .",
    "we performed a fourier analysis of the radial velocity series and the power spectrum presents several peaks at various frequencies .",
    "the highest peak is found at 0.099d@xmath7 ( corresponding to a time - scale of about 10.1d ) , with an amplitude close to 6kms@xmath7 .",
    "our measurements of the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the line profile did not reveal any significant trend attributable to a binary motion . the power spectrum computed on the basis of the measurements of the depth of the line is similar to that obtained for the line profile ( see section[res ] ) , with the highest peak at about 0.87d@xmath7 .    in the case of hd15570 , the multiplicity study performed by @xcite did not reveal any significant radial velocity variation .",
    "we completed the latter radial velocity analysis by adding the data collected in 2007 .",
    "the mean radial velocity measured on the heii @xmath2 4542 line is 47.1@xmath175.8kms@xmath7 .",
    "the fourier analysis performed on the radial velocities revealed several peaks with amplitudes not higher than 5kms@xmath7 .",
    "however , the fourier analysis performed on the line depth measurements led to a power spectrum dominated by two peaks respectively at 0.369 and 1.361d@xmath7 , with very similar amplitudes ( the first one being the highest ) .",
    "these frequencies belong obviously to the family of frequencies already pointed out in section[res2 ] for this star .",
    "we did not obtain any significant result for the fwhm measurements .",
    "finally , we repeated the same analysis for hd16691 .",
    "the mean radial velocity is 49.6@xmath179.1kms@xmath7 .",
    "none of the three quantities measured on this line presents a large amplitude variability with the same time - scale as reported in section[res ] for the line profiles .",
    "however , the peculiar shape of the niii emission profile deserves some attention .",
    "the fact that obvious double lines are found for this profile raises the question of the multiplicity of hd16691 .",
    "a careful inspection of the line profiles reveals that the spectral position of the components constituting the profile undergoes significant shifts , but with a rather weak semi - amplitude similar to that reported for heii @xmath2 4542 , e.g. of the order of 10kms@xmath7 .",
    "we fitted every niii emission profile of the complete time series in order to disentangle the four components using the same approach as shown in the left panel of figure[nitrogen ] .",
    "it should be noted that the line intensities do not seem to be constant from one spectrum to the other .",
    "this could be due either to intrinsic changes of the components that make up the niii lines profiles were also requested to fit the profiles with gaussians from one spectrum to the other . ] or to changes of the underlying broad emission bump .",
    "the derived radial velocities of the gaussian pairs are respectively of the order of 140 and 70kms@xmath7 .",
    "the phase coverage of the time series is rather good , provided the period is 1.98d ( see the results of the line profile temporal analysis in sect.[res3 ] ) , and none of the profiles of our times series shows completely merged components representative of intermediate radial velocities .",
    "the four individual components of the niii multiplet undergo only weak velocity shifts , i.e. at most 10 kms@xmath7 in semi - amplitude .",
    "the behaviour described in section[minprof ] , with the double - peak shape of the residuals on top of the minimum profile of the heii@xmath24686 line , is similar to that of the pair of niii doublets .",
    "this situation is difficult to reconcile with the orbital motion of at least two emission components associated to two stars in a binary system .",
    "we emphasize also that no obvious signature of the presence of a companion has been found in other lines .",
    "we therefore can not report on any signature of binarity for hd16691",
    ".      a plausible origin for the variations may be the stellar wind itself .",
    "stellar winds are unlikely spherical and homogeneous .",
    "any large scale structure in the wind may be responsible for additional emission or absorption components in spectral lines produced predominantly in the wind ( e.g. heii @xmath2 4686 and h@xmath4 ) , or at least partly produced in the wind ( e.g. h@xmath3 ) . in this context ,",
    "the strong correlation in the behaviour of the lines investigated in this study may be explained by their common physical origin , i.e. the same structured stellar wind .",
    "none of the three stars present any strong evidence for binarity .",
    "therefore , we consider a phenomenon related to a structured stellar wind , with a variability time - scale possibly related to the stellar rotation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "such a phenomenon has been investigated from the theoretical point of view , e.g. corotating interaction regions ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or a magnetically channelled wind scenario ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the processes responsible for the formation of spectral lines in stellar atmospheres ( stationnary or expanding ) are intimately dependent on the density of their production region . any large scale structure ( with a significant density contrast with respect to the surrounding mean wind )",
    "will therefore contribute to emission lines ( additional contributions due to the enhanced local density ) , and will have an impact on absorption lines as well ( for instance , photospheric light undergoing additional absorption when crossing higher density regions ) . according to the density contrast and distribution , and to their physical extension , the morphological impact of such structures on spectral lines may vary substantially .",
    "+ large scale corotating structures ( lscs ) can be responsible for a substantial line profile variability . on the one hand , any deviation from the axial symmetry of the rotating emitting region will lead to periodic variations ruled by the rotation period .",
    "such features may come from azimuthal inhomogeneities in the mass loss , or from the interaction of the wind plasma with an inclined magnetic field ( the so - called _ oblique magnetic rotator _ ) . in this context",
    ", it is especially worth mentioning recent advances in the modelling of rigidly rotating magnetospheres @xcite , with emphasis on the excellent results obtained in the representation of the h@xmath4 variations in the bp star @xmath18orie @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "smaller scale heterogeneities in the stellar wind are likely to induce additional  not necessarily periodic ",
    "variations superimposed on those due to the lscs .",
    "we note that we do not expect small scale density structures distributed across the whole stellar wind ( i.e. clumps ) to be responsible for the variations reported in this study .",
    "such a wind clumping would more probably yield a uniform tvs , in contradiciton with the structured one presented in figure[tvs ] .",
    "in addition , clumping is expected to lead to line profile variations with an amplitude of a few per cent at most ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , much lower than those described in this paper .",
    "it should be worth checking whether the time - scales found in sect.[res ] are compatible with the putative rotation period of the star . to do so , we used the relations ( 1 to 3 ) used by @xcite and the parameters given in table[paramrotper ] , in order to estimate the expected minimum ( constrained by the critical rotation velocity ) and maximum ( constrained by the projected rotational velocity ) rotation periods for the three stars .",
    "the results ( p@xmath19 and p@xmath20 ) are quoted in table[paramrotper ] . in the case of hd16691",
    "whose variability time - scale seems rather well - established , the 1.98d time - scale is compatible with the rotation period . actually , it is rather close to the critical period below which the star would break up . on the contrary , the time - scale of 7.2d reported for hd14947 is closer to the upper limit given in table[paramrotper ] .",
    "the case of hd15570 is more problematic , in the sense that the reported variability time - scales ( 17.5h , or even 10.1h ) are significantly shorter than the break - up rotation period .",
    "however , the observed variability time scale may be a only a fraction of the actual rotation period if the symmetry of the lscs is not rigorously cylindrical ( e.g. elongated large - scale structure ) , or if several structures in corotation are present ( e.g. structures related to several ` bright ' or ` dark ' spots on the stellar surface ) .",

    "however , the careful inspection of the h@xmath3 line profiles revealed the presence of an additional absorption component moving simultaneously with at least one component of the heii @xmath2 4686 profile . this additional absorption may be due to the higher opacity of the lscs at some phases of the rotation cycle .",
    "the additional small emission observed in the case of hd16691 may also come from the lscs . to some extent , the slight asymmetries reported in the case of heii @xmath2 4542",
    "may also be explained by the additional absorption due to the lscs .",
    "this common origin is able to explain the strong correlation between the asymmetries of the heii @xmath2 4686 and h@xmath3 lines , as clearly shown in figure[tvs ] .",
    "the increasing amplitude of these asymmetries from hd14947 to hd16691 may be a result of the combined effect of different inclinations with respect to the line of sight and of the spatial extension of the lscs , resulting in the different extensions in the radial velocity space .",
    "the two niii doublets observed in the case of hd16691 suggest that these lines are mostly produced in the lscs , in a confined emission region .",
    "this would imply that the region where the temperature conditions are more favorable for the production of the niii @xmath8 4634,4641 is coincident with the location of the lscs .",
    "the fact that such a feature is not observed for hd14947 and hd15570 may at least partly be explained by a lack of coincidence of the production region of the niii lines and of the lscs . we should not reject a scenario where the lscs is located at somewhat larger radial distances than the niii emission region in the case of hd14947 and hd15570 ( explaining the single line shape and the lack of substantial variability ) , whereas in the case of hd16691 the lscs",
    "may be extended up to much shorter distances from the star , including almost completely the niii emission region .",
    "the location and extension of the lscs are indeed expected to depend intimately on several parameters such as wind properties and putative magnetic properties of the stars , provided the existence of the lscs is of magnetohydrodynamic origin .",
    "in such a scenario , the variations reported on the intensity of the components contributing to line profiles ( heii @xmath2 4686 , h@xmath3 or niii @xmath8 4634,4641 ) may be the signature of small asymmetries in the density distribution of the lscs .",
    "the slight variations in position measured mainly for the niii individual components , and for the residual emission in exces to the minimum profile of heii@xmath24686 , point also to slight deviations from any cylindrical symmetry for the density distribution in the stellar wind .",
    "a large scale structure in the stellar wind modulated by the rotation of the star is therefore likely to explain most of the features observed for the three stars .",
    "we presented the very first detailed investigation of the line profile variability of a sample of of@xmath0 supergiants , using unprecedented spectral time series mostly in the blue domain .",
    "we report on significant correlated variations in the profile of heii @xmath2 4686 and h@xmath3 .",
    "the stronger variations are found in the spectrum of hd16691 which presents some peculiarities with respect to hd14947 and hd15570 .",
    "the most striking feature is the niii doublet at 4634,4641 , where each line seems to be double with a separation of the order of 200kms@xmath7 .",
    "the latter feature is unlikely to be related to a binary scenario .",
    "our temporal analysis points to a period of about 2d for hd16691 , but the variability time - scale is not so well established for hd14947 and hd15570 .",
    "when put together , most of the features of the spectral behaviour of the three stars investigated in this study are compatible with a common scenario , with differences that are more quantitative than qualitative .",
    "no convincing evidence for the presence of a companion exists for the three targets , rejecting therefore variations related to binarity and colliding - wind phenomena .",
    "the behaviour described in the present study is much more compatible with a single star scenario where large scale corotating stuctures ( lscs ) in the wind contribute significantly to emission and absorption features .",
    "such a scenario appears to be well - suited for the line profile variations of heii @xmath2 4686 and h@xmath3 ( and also h@xmath4 , even though it has not been investigated in detail in this study ) . in the context of this scenario , the peculiar shape of the niii @xmath8 4634,4641 profile in hd16691",
    "is tentatively explained by a coincidence of the region that is most favorable to the production of the niii lines with a particularly extended ( in radial velocity space ) lscs .",
    "the absence of such a peculiarity for the two other stars in then explained by the lack of such a coincidence .    the single star nature of the three stars investigated in this study , combined with the structured corotating wind scenario , should not be considered as a firm conclusion based on strong observational evidence , but should be rather viewed as the best working hypothesis to date for future investigations of line profile varitions of early - type stars , and in particular of of@xmath0 supergiants .",
