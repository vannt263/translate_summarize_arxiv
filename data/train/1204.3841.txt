    "diffusion is a fundamental irreversible process intervening in the evolution of many out of equilibrium systems . at sufficiently large scales",
    "it is successfully described by fick s law obtained from non - equilibrium thermodynamics @xcite and , at shorter time scales , by means of kinetic equations of the fokker - planck type derived from mesoscopic non - equilibrium thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "when the particles diffuse through a heterogeneous or complex medium , the structure and the physicochemical properties of the medium may give rise to the appearance of additional kinetic processes that affect the dynamics of the particles@xcite .",
    "an important example of this situation , with applications ranging from biomedicine to engineering , is diffusion in the presence of adsorption in which particles moving through the pores of the material have certain probability to become attached at the walls of the pores @xcite .",
    "two possibilities can be analyzed : total or partial immobilization of the particles at the surface @xcite .",
    "the kinetics is thus dominated by a set of transport equations that may present different relaxation time scales depending on the physicochemical properties of the surface and of the bulk fluid @xcite .",
    "our purpose in this article is to propose a simple model able to analyze the mutual influence of diffusion and adsorption processes in micro and nanopores , a situation observed in zeolites , bentonites or in new engineered highly porous materials @xcite .",
    "we are interested in provide a simple theoretical model able to explain , at least in qualitative form , how this mutual influence is responsible for interesting effects observed in experiments @xcite and recently studied via molecular dynamics and cellular automaton techniques on the diffusion properties of the particles in the pore @xcite .",
    "examples of these effects are the non - monotonic behavior of the diffusivity as a function of particle concentration or particle loading of the pore , or even the strong suppression of self - diffusivity as the number of particles in the pore increases @xcite .",
    "the model describes diffusion of one component in another at rest by means of the fick law and adsorption through a generalized langmuir equation obtained from non - equilibrium thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "using the fact that the concentration of the diffusing particles depends on that of the adsorbed particles , due to mass conservation , we formulate an effective medium theory in which the overall process is described as effective diffusion , with a diffusion coefficient depending on the characteristics of the adsorption process .",
    "our analysis on the effects of adsorption on bulk diffusion is complementary to the usual theoretical approach to the problem which makes emphasis on the surface dynamics of the adsorbed phase @xcite.here , we are considering the case of isothermal adsorption .",
    "the generalization to the case when non - isothermal effects , such as pervaporation associated to the mass transport through a zeolite membrane could also be performed by following a non - equilibrium thermodynamics analysis similar to that of ref .",

    "the effective diffusion coefficient is calculated for a particular adsorption kinetics .",
    "it is shown that it includes a factor accounting for its deviation for the case of absence of adsorption . at high concentrations of adsorbed particles",
    ", a virial expansion is proposed to estimate the effects of interactions .",
    "we conclude that the effective transport properties of the system strongly depend on the adsorption - desorption rate constants as well as on temperature through the corresponding virial coefficients .",
    "the great multiplicity of behaviours found reveals the strong influence that one of these proceses exerts on the other .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we present the model and analyze the case of total immobilization of the adsorbed phase .",
    "section 3 is devoted to study the effect of surface diffusion of the adsorbed phase on the diffusion / adsorption process .",

    "it is convenient to stress here that we will only consider the case when the diffusing particles have a coherent structure , such that their geometry can be characterized by an effective radius which is much larger than the molecules of the solvent .",

    "<S> a non - equilibrium thermodynamics model able to analyze the combined effect of diffusion and adsorption in porous materials is proposed . </S>",
    "<S> the model considers the coupled dynamics of the diffusive phase , described by a diffusion type equation , and the adsorbed phase governed by a generalized langmuir equation . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the combination of diffusion and adsorption can be treated as diffusion in an effective medium , with an effective diffusion coefficient depending on the characteristics of the adsorption kinetics . </S>",
    "<S> the interplay between these effects leads to the appearance of different regimes in which the effective diffusion coefficient exhibits peculiar behaviours such as a decrease due to the presence of the adsorption process and a non - monotonous behavior resulting from particle interactions . </S>",
    "<S> we outline applications of the model developed to diffusion in porous materials such as zeolites and bentonites , and to engineered highly porous materials . </S>"
