    "the crab pulsar proves that sn  1054 must have marked the final core - collapse supernova ( sn ) explosion of a massive star  but what exactly was the initial mass of that star , and what were the properties of the explosion that gave rise to the crab nebula we see today ?",
    "answers to these basic questions remain highly uncertain , despite decades of intensive and careful observations .",
    "a central mystery that has never been resolved is that while sn  1054 was more luminous than a normal type ii sn , the kinetic energy of the crab nebula is surprisingly low ( about 7@xmath610@xmath7 erg or less ) compared to the canonical 10@xmath8 ergs of kinetic energy in a typical sn .",
    "the standard explanation for this fundamental puzzle of the crab , summarized recently by hester ( 2008 ) , is that most of the mass and 90% of the kinetic energy of sn  1054 actually reside far _ outside _ the visual nebulosity known as the crab nebula , in an invisible freely expanding envelope of cold and neutral sn ejecta .",
    "this fast envelope , as well as the blast wave one expects at the leading edge of the fast ejecta that collide with the ambient medium , have never been detected to remarkably low upper limits ( see below ) . in this scenario ,",
    "first articulated by chevalier ( 1977 ) , the crab nebula that we see is only the thin interface between the expanding synchrotron nebula and the ejected stellar envelope .",
    "some models for the crab involve an `` electron - capture sn '' ( ecsn ) marking the collapse of a degenerate onemg core in a star with initial mass 8 - 10 @xmath0 ( e.g. , nomoto et al .  1982 ; nomoto 1987 ; miyaji et al.1980 ) , producing a weaker explosion ( typically 10@xmath1 erg of kinetic energy , instead of 10@xmath8 for fe core collapse ) .",
    "these models , however , also predict sub - luminous explosions ( kitaura et al .",
    "2006 ) due to the under - production of @xmath2ni compared to fe core - collapse sne .",
    "thus , the disagreement between the crab s low kinetic energy and the high luminosity of sn  1054 has remained quite puzzling .",
    "this paper proposes a solution to this enduring mystery , enlisting shock interaction with dense circumstellar material ( csm ) as seen in many type  iin sne .",
    "csm interaction can produce a very luminous sn despite a low total explosion kinetic energy , because a high fraction ( typically @xmath410 - 30% or more ) of the kinetic energy is converted to radiation .",
    "this same model matches many other unusual properties of the crab , like the slow , thin , filamentary shell that is the direct product of dense csm interaction , and helps to provide a unifying picture of sn  1054 .",
    "the crab nebula is one of the most carefully observed objects in the sky , providing a long list of detailed observational constraints for any model .",
    "an abbreviated list of some of the most relevant observed properties of sn  1054 and the crab nebula are given below .",
    "these are compiled from two comprehensive reviews by davidson & fesen ( 1985 ) and hester ( 2008 ) , except where noted .",
    "sn  1054 was certainly a core - collapse event because it produced a neutron star . this could , however , be accomplished either by a standard fe core collapse , or by an ecsn event .",
    "there are a number of reasons to favor the latter .",
    "sn  1054 should have been a type ii supernova ( had spectra been available ) , because h emission lines are bright in the crab filaments .",
    "the relative n(h)/n(he ) abundance of @xmath42 ( davidson & fesen 1985 ) is too high for it to have been a type  iib event , and certainly not a type  ib or ic ( dessart et al .",
    "2012 ; haschinger et al .",
    "the only viable known types are then type ii - p , ii - l , or iin .    \\3",
    "sn  1054 was , however , quite luminous compared to normal sne  ii - p and iib , with a peak absolute visual magnitude of roughly @xmath518 ( this is discussed in more detail below in  2 ) .",
    "the average peak luminosity for sne ii - p is around @xmath515.6 , and around @xmath516.7 for sne iib ( li et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "the network of thermally emitting filaments that encloses the synchrotron nebula has an expansion rate suggestive of an origin in sn  1054 . while proper motions of the filaments indicate a later ejection date of 1120 - 1233 a.d .  when extrapolated back in time assuming linear expansion ( trimble 1968 ;",
    "wyckoff & murray 1977 ; bietenholz et al .",
    "1991 ; nugent 1998 ) , it is thought that the pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) has been pushing outward against the filaments and has accelerated them ( e.g. , woltjer 1958 ) , producing a younger apparent age and driving the instabilities that shape the filaments .",
    "more recently , rudi , fesen , & yamada ( 2007 ) have measured the proper motion of the crab s northern `` jet '' , which is more distant from the pulsar and less likely to be influenced by acceleration from the pwn , and they measure an ejection date of 1055  a.d .",
    "@xmath924 yr .    \\5 .",
    "the total mass in the crab nebula s filaments is difficult to estimate from nebular spectroscopy , but is likely to be around 5 @xmath0 , although some estimates have been lower ( 12 @xmath0 ) .",
    "some additional mass might be hidden in the dense neutral / molecular cores of some filaments that are shielded from uv radiation and not traced by the emission lines used to estimate the mass .",
    "indeed , high resolution images of filaments and blobs do show ionization gradients consistent with self - shielding ( e.g. , blair et al .",
    "1997 ; sankrit et al .",
    "we adopt @xmath45 @xmath0 as the total mass in the shell of filaments .",
    "the crab nebula is expanding slowly , and has extremely low kinetic energy for a sn .",
    "drift scans of the integrated spectrum from the entire nebula show that most of the gas producing the brightest visual - wavelength emission lines is expanding at roughly @xmath91200 km s@xmath3 ( macalpine et al .  1989 ; fesen et al .  1997 ; smith 2003 ) , which we adopt as the representative bulk speed for most of the mass in the filaments .",
    "fainter emission extends to @xmath92000 - 2500 km s@xmath3 , but only very low - level emission and a small fraction of the mass extends to that speed . with @xmath45 @xmath0 expanding at roughly 1200 km s@xmath3 , the kinetic energy of the crab filaments is only 7@xmath610@xmath7 ergs ( and this is more generous than some estimates ) .    \\7 .",
    "no blast wave has ever been detected outside the crab nebula in x - ray emission ( mauche & gorenstein 1989 ; predehl & schmitt 1995 ; seward , gorenstein , & smith 2006 ) or radio emission ( frail et al.1995 ) . a blast wave located outside the crab at many times",
    "the radius of the current filaments is expected in the `` standard '' model for the crab nebula , where a freely expanding , fast , and cold stellar envelope should be colliding with the ambient medium .",
    "attempts to explain the lack of a blast wave require special conditions in the surrounding medium and are generally unsatisfying .",
    "no neutral envelope outside the visible filaments with speeds comparable to a normal sn  ii - p has ever been detected .",
    "as above , an extended fast expanding envelope of cold sn ejecta should reside outside the crab in the standard view .",
    "lundqvist et al .",
    "( 1986 ) predicted that because of ionization from the synchrotron emission , this extended envelope would be easily detected in a number of uv absorption lines .",
    "sollerman et al .",
    "( 2000 ) presented a weak detection of the c  iv @xmath101550 resonance lines in absorption , but did not detect any material moving faster than 2500 km s@xmath3 , only tracing about 0.3 @xmath0 of material at those relatively slow speeds that correspond to the outer parts of the visible filaments .",
    "other upper limits on any fast envelope outside the crab are quite restrictive ( e.g. , fesen et al .",
    "1997 ) , making it unlikely that there is an envelope of several @xmath0 moving at speeds up to 10,000 km s@xmath3 as one expects if sn  1054 were a normal sn ii - p .",
    "analysis of the chemical composition of the crab nebula filaments reveals them to be he and c rich , and not as o - enriched as other ccsn remnants ( see davidson & fesen 1985 , and references therein ; e.g. , henry & macalpine 1982 ; pequignot & dennefeld 1983 ; davidson et al.1982 ; fesen & kirshner 1982 ; kirshner 1974 ; satterfield et al.2012 ) .",
    "this yield implies a relatively low initial mass for the progenitor star of around @xmath11 8@xmath510 @xmath0 ( some put the initial mass at the higher end of this range ; e.g. , macalpine & satterfield 2008 ) .",
    "the composition of the filaments also indicates relatively low abundances of iron - peak elements , which in turn implies a low yield of @xmath2ni .",
    "this too is consistent with a relatively low - energy ecsn .",
    "the crab is located about 180 pc from the galactic plane . aside from the remote possibility that it could be a runaway from the i geminorum association ( although radial velocities seem to discount this ; minkowski 1970 ) , it does not appear to be associated with any group of ob stars .",
    "these facts also seem to point toward a relatively low - mass progenitor star .",
    "the crab filaments formed significant amounts of both dust and molecules , indicating that they went through a phase with very high density and rapid cooling .",
    "dust in the filaments can be inferred based on the absorption it produces , causing some of the filaments to be seen in silhouette against the synchrotron nebula ( fesen & blair 1990 ) .",

    "the observed parameters listed above present a serious challenge to understanding sn  1054 as a normal type ii explosion ( either sn  ii - p , iib , or ii - l ) .",
    "a large number of unrelated and unlikely circumstances would need to conspire to produce the crab nebula from a normal core - collapse sn .    in stark contrast ,",

    "sne  iin are fundamentally different from other types of sne because they are dominated by intense csm interaction , which sweeps up most of the mass into a cold , dense shell ( cds ) that collapses as a result of radiative cooling .",

    "the association of the crab nebula with the famous `` guest star '' observed by chinese astrologers , discovered on 1054 july 4 , has been recounted many times ( lundmark 1921 ; duyvendak 1942 ; mayall & oort 1942 ; shklovsky 1968 ; minkowski 1971 ; clark & stephenson 1977 ; chevalier 1977 ; brecher et al .",
    "the weirdness of the crab compared to other traditional sne and sn remnants has also been repeated many times , by these same authors and others . adopting the known extinction of @xmath14 mag ( miller 1973 ) and a distance of @xmath42 kpc ( trimble 1973 ; or 15002200 pc as given by davidson & fesen 1985 ) , one can translate the historical accounts of chinese astrologers to approximate absolute magnitudes ( roughly @xmath13-band ) .",
    "there are essentially two facts that we gain from the historical reports :    * _ sn  1054 was visible during daytime for a total of 23 days . _",
    "following shklovsky ( 1968 ) , this implies @xmath15 mag , and therefore an absolute visual magnitude of about @xmath518.1 or brighter during those 23 days .",
    "it is not known how day 23 compares to the time after explosion , because the discovery on july 4 may have been the date when sn  1054 first appeared in the early morning after being behind the sun ( it is a fall and winter object ) .",
    "thus , the peak absolute magnitude is not firmly established ( i.e. , it is at least as luminous as @xmath518 mag during that time , but could have been more luminous at earlier times ) .",
    "the time when sn  1054 was seen during the day is marked by the first two black dots in figure  [ fig : lc ] , adopting an uncertainty of @xmath90.8 mag ( although the first point should perhaps be regarded as a lower limit to the initial luminosity ) .",
    "* _ sn  1054 faded thereafter , and remained visible at night to the unaided eye until 653 days after discovery . _",
    "the rate of fading is not known , but we can conclude that by day 653 the sn had faded to a luminosity of about @xmath16 = @xmath57.6 mag .",
    "this is indicated by the last black dot on figure  [ fig : lc ] , adopting a somewhat smaller uncertainty of @xmath90.6 mag ) .",
    "what do these two facts tell us about the type of sn that made the crab ? before considering that question , let s remember that we can rule out sne  ib and ic , and probably also iib , because of the presence of substantial amounts of h in the crab filaments .",
    "considering only sne of type ii , then , figure  [ fig : lc ] does provide some useful constraints .",
    "figure  [ fig : lc ] allows us to rule out normal sne  ii - p like sn  1999em and fainter sne",
    "ii - p like sn  2005cs because they never achieve such a high peak luminosity .",
    "this is quite useful information , because one class of sne that is consistent with _ some _",
    "available information about the crab is the group of low - luminosity sne ii - p , which could be caused by low - energy ecsne that would agree with the kinetic energy and abundances of the crab , and its implied low - mass progenitor star .",
    "however , the high peak luminosity of @xmath518 mag clearly rules these out ( at least without some mechanism to make them more luminous ) .",
    "there are some relatively luminous sne ii - p ( li et al .",
    "2011 ; elias - rosa et al .  2009 ; arcavi et al .",
    "2012 ) that approach the peak luminosity of sn  1054 , but these are thought to be luminous because of an energetic explosion that synthesizes a relatively large mass of @xmath2ni .",
    "a large mass of @xmath2ni would produce a luminous radioactive decay tail that would be too bright ( in fact , according to figure  [ fig : lc ] even sn  1999em would be too luminous at late times ) .",
    "moreover , a large mass of @xmath2ni is in conflict with the observed abundances of the crab , which are deficient in fe - group elements ( see above ) .",
    "this means that attributing the late - time faintness to dust formation alone does not solve the problem .",
    "some sne  ii - l do have brighter peak luminosities around @xmath517 to @xmath518 mag , but they tend to fade slowly and are more luminous at late times than sn  1054 .",
    "the canonical sn  ii - l 1980k is shown in figure  [ fig : lc ] for comparison .",
    "normal sne iin like sn  1998s have light curves very similar to sne ii - l , and do achieve peak luminosities like sn  1054 .",
    "however , these also tend to fade more slowly , and remain luminous at late times due to ongoing csm interaction .",
    "finally , there is an observed class of sne that does seem to agree well with the historical light curve of sn  1054 , and that is the class of sne  iin - p ( mauerhan et a.  2013a ) .",
    "the @xmath13-band light curves of sn  1994w , sn  2009kn , and sn  2011ht are shown in figure  [ fig : lc ] . like traditional sne  iin",
    ", they can achieve relatively high peak luminosities in agreement with sn  1054 , and indeed they often fade significantly during their `` plateau '' .",
    "what is unique about these sne is that , unlike other sne  iin , their luminosity plummets after @xmath4120 days so that they do not maintain the high level of csm interaction luminosity at late times seen in most sne  iin . it has been suggested ( mauerhan et al .",
    "2013a ; sollerman et al .  2001 ) that this rapid fading may indicate unusually low yields of @xmath2ni , or efficient dust formation ( or both ) .",
    "this drop should also be accompanied by a drop in csm interaction , although the reason why all these sne would do this at @xmath4120 days is not obvious ( mauerhan et al .",
    "the drop from the end of the plateau is more extreme in some sne  iin - p as compared to others .",
    "the most extreme drop after the plateau is for the case of sn  2011ht , but in this case we know that the colors became very red , whereas the bolometric luminosity did not drop quite so much ( mauerhan et al .",
    "2013a ) . once again",
    ", dust formation may be influential , whereas sn  2009kn may have formed less dust and consequently had bluer colors on its decay tail .",
    "the rapid drop after the plateau probably correlates with low @xmath2ni mass , as in low - luminosity sne  ii - p .",
    "for comparison , figure  [ fig : lc ] also includes representative fading rates due to radioactive decay at late times ( black dashed lines ) , matched to the one late - time luminosity constraint for sn  1054 .",
    "two cases are shown : ( 1 ) all the @xmath17-ray luminosity is trapped by the ejecta and reprocessed into visual light , which would indicate a mass of synthesized @xmath2ni of about 0.009 @xmath0 , and ( 2 ) some leakage of the @xmath17-rays produced by radioactive decay ( where the @xmath17-ray optical depth evolves as @xmath18 , following sollerman et al .",
    "2001 ) , yielding a somewhat larger mass of @xmath19(@xmath2ni ) = 0.016 @xmath0 .",
    "both are significantly less than the @xmath2ni mass expected from a normal 10@xmath8 erg sn event . as we discuss below , however ( and as mentioned by sollerman et al .",
    "2001 ) , csm interaction may also make a contribution to the late time luminosity , potentially lowering the @xmath2ni mass further .",
    "how does the apparent uniqueness of the crab compare to the frequencey of various sn subtypes ?",
    "the crab nebula is the only one of its kind among the handful of known galactic sn remnants that are connected to historically observed events , provoking many commentaries about how unique or bizarre it is .",
    "considering the statistics , we note that sne of type  iin make up only 8 - 9% of all core - collapse sne in a volume - limited sample ( smith et al .",
    "2011a ) , and an even lower fraction of all sne if type ia events are included ( li et al .",
    "moreover , the sn  iin - p sublass represents only a subset of all sne  iin .",
    "the apparently unique character of the crab among young nearby sn remnants in the galaxy is therefore not so surprising if sn  1054 was a type  iin - p event , but it is very difficult to reconcile with the idea that sn  1054 was a normal sn  ii - p in which most of the mass and kinetic energy have gone undetected at the present time .",
    "this is diuscussed further in  4.2 and  4.5 .",
    "the observational case outlined in the previous section makes a compelling argument that sn  1054 shared properties in common with sne  iin , and the sub - class of sne  iin - p in particular .",
    "we must discuss whether this makes sense physically as well as observationally .",
    "this section outlines a very simple baseline model of csm interaction that can account for both the luminosity of the events ( sn  1054 and the class of sne  iin - p ) and the resulting mass , kinematics , and structure of the crab nebula .",
    "let s begin with some order - of - magnitude estimates . for sne  iin - p and for sn  1054 , we wish for the shock interaction between the explosion ejecta and the dense csm to achieve a luminosity of order @xmath518 mag or @xmath410@xmath20 @xmath21 for the first few months .",
    "in this scenario , dense csm decelerates the shock , and the resulting high densities in the post - shock region allow the shock to become radiative ( i.e. the shock becomes momentum conserving instead of energy conserving , as in all sne  iin ) . with high densities and optical depths in h - rich gas , thermal energy is radiated away primarily as visual - wavelength continuum emission .",
    "this loss of energy removes pressure support behind the forward shock , leading to a very thin , dense , and rapidly cooling shell at the contact discontinuity ( usually referred to as the `` cold dense shell '' , or cds ; see chugai et al .",
    "2004 ; chugai & danziger 1994 ) .",
    "this cds is pushed by ejecta entering the reverse shock , and it is slowed and mass - loaded by the csm , into which it expands at a speed @xmath22 . in this scenario , the maximum emergent continuum luminosity from csm interaction",
    "is given by    @xmath23    where @xmath22 is the outward expansion speed of the cds , @xmath24 is the speed of the pre - shock wind , @xmath25 is the mass - loss rate of the wind , and @xmath26 = @xmath27 is the so - called wind density parameter ( see chugai et al .",
    "2004 ; chugai & danziger 1994 ; smith et al .",
    "2010 ) .    for a radiated luminosity of 10@xmath20 @xmath21 and for an assumed expansion speed of the cds of around 1100 km s@xmath3 ( recall that the present speed of @xmath41200 km s@xmath3 in the crab filaments is the result of later acceleration by the pwn ) , we require a csm density of order @xmath26 @xmath28 6@xmath610@xmath29 g cm@xmath3 .",
    "the total mass in the csm would be @xmath43 @xmath0 @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the outer radius of the csm shell in units of 10@xmath33 cm .",
    "note that according to equation ( 1 ) we could also achieve a very high csm interaction luminosity with less dense csm but with a faster shock speed , due to the @xmath34 dependence .",
    "for example , we could also reach @xmath35 with @xmath36 km s@xmath3 and @xmath26=8@xmath610@xmath33 g @xmath37 .",
    "this is , however , infeasible for the crab because csm interaction must also conserve momentum , and in this scenario with a faster shock , the lower masses of the csm and sn ejecta ( which together would need to be less than 1 @xmath0 ) are ruled out by the observed mass and speed of the crab filaments . a low cds shock speed and a low energy are needed to match the observed constraints of the crab , whereas we do not have independent constraints on the cds mass in the case of extragalactic sne  iin - p .",
    "the observed visual csm - interaction luminosity should be close to the total bolometric luminosity during the bright `` plateau '' phase of the event ( i.e. a small bolometric correction ) , judging from the apparent temperatures of @xmath46000 - 7000 k typically seen in the continua of virtually all sne  iin .",
    "this may not be strictly true if the apparent temperature changes with time as the shock slows down . in that case the estimated mass - loss rate or the ejecta speed might need to be increased slightly , which does nt significantly change the nature of the event discussed here . to be sure , csm interaction",
    "does afford some flexibility in model parameters .",
    "one can also adjust the geometry so that the interaction has a different strength at various latitudes .",
    "small differences of this sort may account for the variation from one sn  iin - p to the next , and there does appear to be some departure from spherical geometry in the csm interaction that yielded the crab nebula ( see below ) .",
    "the purpose here is to be illustrative rather than exact , in order to demonstrate that csm interaction can naturally fix the long - standing puzzle of the high peak luminosity of sn  1054 being apparently at odds with the low kinetic energy of the crab .      equation ( 1 ) suggests that sn  1054 requires a wind density parameter of @xmath26 @xmath28 6@xmath610@xmath29 g cm@xmath3 , which implies a total csm mass of about 3 @xmath0 within 10@xmath33 cm of the progenitor . since the progenitor wind speed ( @xmath24 ) is not known",
    ", there is uncertainty about the mass - loss rate , the nature of the pre - sn mass loss , and the physical state of the progenitor star .",
    "dense and massive csm could arise from a sudden explosive or eruptive pre - sn ejection event ( @xmath410@xmath7 erg ) occuring a few years before the sn , as has been hypothesized for more luminous sne  iin such as sn  2006gy ( smith & mccray 2007 , smith et al .",
    "2010a ) , for sn  1994w ( chugai et al .",
    "2004 ) , and a number of other sne  iin .",
    "there is now observed precedent for this type of event associated with sne  iin from the documented series of pre - sn luminous blue variable ( lbv)-like events that were actually detected before the sn in the case of sn  2009ip ( see mauerhan et al .",
    "2013b and references therein ) .",
    "there was also a brief pre - sn outburst observed 2 yr before sn  2006jc ( pastorello et al .",
    "2007 ) , but that event was a type ibn instead of a type iin .",
    "the fact that this type of precursor burst has been detected in both sne iin and ibn is very interesting with regard to the crab , however , given the high he abundance in the crab filaments .",
    "there is also some theoretical motivation for this type of pre - sn eruption in stars of 8 - 10 @xmath0 due to ne flashes in the degenerate core ( chugai et al .",
    "2004 ; arnet 1974 ; hillebrandt 1982 ; weaver & woosley 1979 ) .",
    "alternatively , some evolution models for super - agb stars in this mass range become unstable due to strong he flashes that cause the star s interior to exceed the classical eddington limit , possibly causing hydrodynamic ejection ( wood & faulkner 1986 ; lau et al .",
    "although lau et al .  ( 2012 ) also note that the ensuing mass loss in this scenario could lead the star to avoid the ecsn fate .",
    "a second possibility is that the dense csm would come from a steady , short - duration wind . for a fiducial pre - shock csm speed of 10 km",
    "s@xmath3 , this would translate to a progenitor mass - loss rate of @xmath410@xmath3 @xmath0 yr@xmath3 blowing for @xmath430 yr before the sn .",
    "this timescale would achieve the desired outer csm radius of @xmath410@xmath33 cm .",
    "such a high wind mass - loss rate from a relatively low - mass star seems difficult to achieve , however , since stars of this mass are not expected to undergo prolonged super - eddington phases .",
    "one last alternative has properties that fit well with some theoretical predictions for stars in the right range of initial masses .",
    "the csm mass required to power sn  1054 and sne iin - p through interaction might come from the dense wind of a super - agb star with @xmath38 yr@xmath3 , blowing for a few 10@xmath39 yr to achieve the desired total csm mass of @xmath43 @xmath0 .",
    "a few 10@xmath40 yr duration and @xmath38 yr@xmath3 is expected for the thermal - pulsing asymptotic giant branch ( tp - agb ) phase associated with super - agb stars of initial mass 8 - 10 @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , precisely this scenario is found in some stellar evolution models for the super - agb progenitors of ecsne ( see , e.g. , figure 15 of poelarends et al .  2008 ) .",
    "the difficulty with this scenario is that the massive csm must be confined to within a few 10@xmath33 cm in order to provide a high - enough density to power the early light curve and the right duration of the plateau , whereas a super - agb wind in free expansion blowing for a few 10@xmath39 yr could extend to @xmath40.1 pc .",
    "thus , the dense csm required would seem to be either a short - duration enhanced mass loss phase before core - collapse , or a longer - duration wind that is somehow confined within a smaller volume ( either by external pressure of a previous hot - wind phase or gravity of a companion star , for example ) .",
    "these are unsolved issues , but it is nevertheless true that the observed light curves of sne iin - p require very dense csm with this very compact radial extent .",
    "below we explore models using csm environments with density that falls off as @xmath41 ( as in a wind ) and a csm with constant density ( as in a pressure - confined wind or perhaps an ejected shell ) .",
    "this distinction turns out to cause only minor differences in the mass and energy requirements .",
    "equation ( 1 ) provides a very rough estimate of the csm density needed to power the peak luminosity with csm interaction . to compute a simple model light curve and to derive better estimates of the energy and mass involved , however , we must account for the fact that the speed of the cds and the speed of sn ejecta crashing into the cds will change with time .",
    "we adopt a simple spherically symmetric model where relatively low - energy ( @xmath410@xmath1 erg ) ejecta collide with dense csm . at each time",
    "- step in the ensuing collision , the cds conserves momentum contributed by the sn ejecta and csm .",
    "the deceleration of the faster sn ejecta upon joining the cds leads to a drop in the kinetic energy , and the difference between the initial and final kinetic energy at each time step provides the emergent luminosity at that time , from which the light curve is calculated .",
    "( although this light curve represents the maximum possible bolometric luminosity , we assume that this is close to the visual luminosity since the cds is optically thick and its peak flux is in optical light .",
    "this should be true during the bright plateau phase , but may become a worse approximation at late times as the optical depth drops . )",
    "this is essentially the same type of model used to calculate the csm interaction luminosity of the @xmath410@xmath1 erg great eruption of @xmath42  carinae ( smith 2013 ) , except that the csm and ejecta speeds and mass were different in that model , which led to a fainter luminosity with a longer duration .",
    "we consider two cases for the csm , with a model that has @xmath43 , as would be appropriate for a steady short - duration wind , and with a model that adopts a constant - density csm envelope ( as used by chugai et al .",
    "2004 in the case of sn  1994w ) , which would be more appropriate for a pressure - confined csm or perhaps for an eruptive event .",
    "the resulting light curves for the two cases are shown in the top panels of figures  [ fig : model1 ] and [ fig : model2 ] , respectively .",
    "the bottom panels of both figures plot the time evolution of the radius and speed of the cds corresponding to each model .",
    "the main difference between the two model light curves is in the shape of the plateau .",
    "since more csm mass is located at larger radii in the constant density csm model , this light curve has a flatter plateau and it takes a longer time to rise to peak luminosity . for this reason , the light curve plotted in figure  [ fig : model2 ] has been shifted in time by @xmath540 days due to a larger delay between the time of explosion and the time of discovery by visual observers . although this is a crude model , the resulting light curves are very similar to light curves of sn / csm interaction produced using more detailed 1-d and 2-d hydrodynamic simulations ( e.g. , van marle et al .",
    "2010 ; woosley et al.2007 ) .",
    "the drop in luminosity at the end of the plateau arises because the expanding cds reaches the outer edge of the dense csm , at which time csm interaction ends .",
    "the time at which this occurs is set by the choice of the outer radius of the csm , which is chosen to be 120 days as seen in sne iin - p , and the speed at which the cds moves through the csm .",
    "this is easily adjusted and is not a critical part of the model for the crab , however , since there are not ( yet ) any observational constraints on the duration ( or existence ) of a plateau in sn  1054 .",
    "the steep drop in the model plateau is somewhat artificial , dictated by the assumed instantaneous drop in density at the outer boundary of the csm in the simple model ; in reality , it is likely that this transition would be smoother , as observed in sne iin - p .",
    "after the plateau ends and the luminosity drops at @xmath4120 days , there is a tail of declining luminosity .",
    "there are two likely contributions to this late - time luminosity .",
    "first , even though the cds is no longer sweeping into dense csm ahead of the shock , there would still be some luminosity contributed by ongoing shock interaction as the remaining inner sn ejecta catch up to the dense and slowly expanding cds .",
    "this shock luminosity drops with time because of the shrinking difference between cds speed ( now coasting at constant speed ) and the speed of freely expanding sn ejecta ( slower ejecta take longer to catch up to the cds ) .",
    "the strength of this ongoing shock interaction is set by the final mass and speed of the cds at the end of the plateau .",
    "the second expected contribution to the late - time luminosity is from radioactive decay , which is observed to be low in sne iin - p and should be low in sn  1054 due to the low abundance of fe - group elements in the crab .",
    "even if we allow for some @xmath17-ray leakage ( see above ) , the implied masses of @xmath2ni synthesized in the explosion are of order 0.01 @xmath0 .",
    "the solid orange curves at late times show the sum of the radioactive decay and shock luminosity , while each individual contribution is shown separately with dotted and dashed curves .",
    "this late - time luminosity does not include any contribution from luminosity that might be associated with early spin - down of the young neutron star ; core - collapse simulations ( e.g. , ott et al .  2006 ) yield shorter periods than one expects from extrapolating the present - day spin period of 33 ms for the crab .",
    "some loss of rotational energy is probably required , although the mechanism and possible luminosity associated with this are uncertain .",
    "both models in figures  [ fig : model1 ] and [ fig : model2 ] with somewhat different csm density distributions provide an adequate account of the peak luminosity and late time luminosity of sn  1054 , and morover , the final properties of the coasting cds match the mass , speed , and kinetic energy of the crab filaments . the model with density falling as @xmath41 would seem to do a better job of accounting for the fact that sn  1054 was only at its peak luminosity for a relatively short time of 23 days , whereas the longer plateau that arises from constant density would seem to match some of the sn  iin - p light curves a bit better .",
    "the distinction between these two is subtle , and proper radiative transfer may provide better constraints on the emergent temperature and bolometric correction ( these plots are just the total bolometric radiated luminosity ) .",
    "the true density distribution may be between the two cases illustrated here , and it may of course be non - spherical , but the order of magnitude in the csm density and mass must be roughly correct .    although the model used here is quite simplified , it adequately demonstrates that a relatively low - energy 10@xmath1 erg explosion that would be expected from an ecsn can produce both the high peak luminosity and low late - time luminosity of sne iin - p and sn  1054 .",
    "it also securely demonstrates that csm interaction allows the light curve to be reconciled with the present - day observed properties of the crab filaments .",
    "since the forward shock has been decelerated by the dense csm , no additional mass or sn energy needs to be hidden outside the observed crab filaments in this model .          how did the complex structure of the crab nebula we see today  including its spectacularly complex web of dense filaments  arise as a result of the csm interaction model described above ?",
    "figure  [ fig : sketch ] illustrates a possible sequence of events that would lead to the basic structures seen in the scenario where sn  1054 was a type iin - p explosion .    in this model ,",
    "the progenitor star must have been a relatively low - mass ( 8 - 10 @xmath0 ) super - agb star surrounded by a dense shell of csm within about 1 - 2 @xmath610@xmath33 cm of the central star ( figure  [ fig : sketch]a ) . to account for some specific structures seen in the crab ( see below ) , this initial configuration includes a density enhancement near the equatorial plane of the progenitor star , with this `` disk '' seen roughly edge - on and with an east / west orientation .",
    "this disk is not needed to explain the light curve .    immediately after core collapse ,",
    "the remaining stellar envelope that had not already been shed in the pre - sn mass loss expands outward into the dense csm ( figure  [ fig : sketch]b ) .",
    "this collision , which lasts of order 120 days , produces the peak luminosity phase of sn  1054 as ejecta kinetic energy is converted to visual - wavelength radiation . in this process",
    ", the slow csm is accelerated and the fast sn ejecta are decelerated ; both pile up in the very thin cold dense shell ( cds ) that expands outward at about 1000 km s@xmath3 .",
    "the shell is thin because it collapses to a dense layer as radiation cools the gas and removes pressure support from the post - shock region .",
    "this intense phase of interaction continues until the shock reaches the outer boundary of the dense csm ( figure  [ fig : sketch]c ) .",
    "after that time , the luminosity would plummet ( at a decline rate dictated by the steepness in the density drop , which is not constrained by available observations ) . by this time ,",
    "about 5 @xmath0 has piled up in the slowly expanding cds , which would coast at a speed of @xmath41100 km s@xmath3 after this time .",
    "the thin shell is composed entirely of sn ejecta and csm ejected before the explosion , and its chemical abundances reflect the he - rich abundances in the star s envelope in the final phases of its evolution . some of the slower ejecta continue to crash into the reverse shock and heat the cds , but this ongoing shock interaction is far less intense than during the plateau phase .",
    "after this , the cds would simply continue to coast , were it not for the fact that sn  1054 also gave birth to a pulsar than energizes a pwn .",
    "for the next @xmath41000 yr up until modern times , the expansion of the pwn must contend with a massive , slow - moving shell that is in its path of expansion .",
    "it is this last phase of the pwn interacting with the thin shell that produces much of the complex structure seen in the crab ( figure  [ fig : sketch]d ) .",
    "it is known that the expansion of the pwn has pushed and accelerated the crab filaments , since their measured proper motions would seem to indicate an origin 70 - 80 yr after 1054 a.d .",
    "( trimble 1968 ; wyckoff & murray 1977 ; bietenholtz et al .",
    "1991 ; nugent 1998 ) . in this scenario , where a thin shell is accelerated outward by an underlying fluid , the thin shell will be subject to severe rayliegh - taylor ( rt ) instabilities , and the thin shell will fragment into a network of dense filaments . as the pwn tries to push through the spaces between these filaments , it could give rise to the bubble - like morphology in the outer `` [ o  iii ] skin '' seen in deep exposures of the crab ( fesen & gull 1986 ) . in some locations , the pwn may push through the shell , perhaps leading to breakout structures akin to the `` chimney '' or `` jet '' on the northern perimeter of the crab ( fesen & gull 1982 ; cox et al .",
    "1991 ) , although this is speculative .",
    "hydrodynamic simulations of the pwn pushing into a massive cds that results from a type iin explosion might be illuminating .",
    "the overall non - spherical geometry can also be accounted for in this interaction .",
    "fesen , martin , & shull ( 1992 ) have provided a detailed discussion of the prominent indentations in the crab synchrotron nebula known as the east and west `` bays '' .",
    "these features mark a location where the continuum synchrotron emission is absent , apparently because the expansion of the pwn has been thwarted there .",
    "fesen et al .",
    "( 1992 ) suggested that this may be the result of an equatorial disk - like distribution of dense csm around the progenitor star , that pinched the waist of the expanding remnant , and they also pointed out a connection to the belt of he - rich filaments that share the same basic orientation as the e and w bays but at larger radii ( see also uomoto & macalpine 1987 ; macalpine et al .",
    "1989 ; lawrence et al .",
    "this is quite easily accommodated in the csm interaction scenario for the crab if the pre - sn csm shell had an equatorial density enhancement , with an equator / pole density contrast of oder 2 .",
    "the common orientation of the bays and the he - rich torus are harder to accommodate in the `` standard '' view of the crab , where the observed crab filaments are solely the result of the pwn expanding into the freely expanding sn ejecta ( hester 2008 ) ; i.e. no interaction with the csm has occurred here because the hypothetical forward shock is located far outside the crab . in this scenario ,",
    "the se / nw elongation axis of the crab would arise because of a stronger push along this axis from the crab s synchrotron jet , known to share this orientation ( see fig .",

    "light echoes have even been detected from the 19th century great eruption of @xmath42 carinae ( rest et al .",
    "2012 ) . because @xmath42 carinae s peak luminosity was much lower than a sn , and",
    "because its peak apparent magnitude was much fainter than sn  1054 , there may yet be hope that continuing efforts will be able to identify light echoes from sn  1054 , despite its old age of @xmath41000 yr and low - density environment .",
    "this is a difficult task , but in the event that light echoes of sn  1054 can be identified , they offer the opportunity to directly test the model proposed here .",
    "this prediction may provide a rather definitive and useful test .",
    "the `` standard '' picture for the crab ( hester 2008 ) places most of the mass and most of the kinetic energy outside the filaments in a fast , freely expanding envelope . at the present time",
    "this envelope is transparent and invisible , and produces no detectable shock as it encounters the surrounding medium . during the peak luminosity phase of sn  1054 ,",
    "however , the fast envelope would dominate the observed spectrum with a recombination photosphere moving back through the rapidly expanding ejecta . in this scenario ,",
    "the spectrum should show only broad ( 5000 - 10000 km s@xmath3 ) emission lines with similarly broad p cygni profiles that should appear to be typical of normal sne ii - p .",
    "on the other hand , if the csm interaction model advocated here is correct , the sn ejecta are quickly decelerated by dense csm , giving rise to a high luminosity generated by the collision . in the csm interaction scenario ,",
    "the peak luminosity spectrum should exhibit narrow lines typical of sne iin .",
    "this might include some broad wings or intermediate - width components that are typically seen in sne iin , of course , but the strongest emission in the cores of the lines should be narrow ( less than about 1000 - 1500 km s@xmath3 , matching the speed of the cds ) .",
    "in particular , the spectra of light echoes from sn  1054 should closely resemble the spectra of the subclass of sne  iin - p , like sne  1994w , 2009kn , and 2011ht ( chugai et al .",
    "2004 ; kankare et al.2012 ; mauerhan et al .",
    "2013a ) , for which high - quality spectra exist .",
    "in addition , the brightness evolution of light echoes can provide information about the historical light curve , usually providing better time sampling than the original historical observations .",
    "this would be very useful , given the sparse observations of sn  1054 .",
    "the light curves derived from images of light echoes of sn  1054 may show a plateau that drops after 120 days if sn  1054 really is a sn iin - p , or a smoother decline if it is a more traditional sn iin ( or some other type of sn ) .",
    "however , the pleateau is less important than the presence of a type  iin spectrum in order to confirm the essence of the suggested model , since a normal type ii - p will also have a plateau .",
    "the scenario suggested here , wherein the crab is the result of a type  iin sn , may be relevant to the larger class of crab - like snrs and pwne in general .",
    "the crab is the archetype for a class of filled - center supernova remnants ( snrs ) known as pwne ( gaensler & slane 2006 ) , also sometimes referred to as filled - center remnants or `` plerions '' ( e.g. , gaensler 2001 ; reynolds 1985 ) . the filled center refers , of course , to the bright pulsar - powered synchrotron nebula in the interior of the crab and its siblings .",
    "the class includes other famous objects like the crab s twin snr  0540 - 69.3 with its young 50 ms pulsar ( e.g. , morse et al .",
    "2006 ; seward et al .  1984 ) , and 3c58 ( weiler & seielstad 1971 ; weiler 1983 ) that is possibly associated with sn  1181 ( clark & stephenson 1977 ) .",
    "it is natural to ask if the physics of a type  iin explosion can yield favorable conditions to enhance the observability or physical properties of pwne , or to change their physical properties in a systematic way .",
    "namely , sne  iin are distinct from other types of sne in that the end product of the explosion is a slow , thin , and very massive ( 5 - 10 @xmath0 or more ) dense shell of swept - up csm and ejecta .",
    "if a pulsar is born in the core - collapse event associated with a sn  iin , its pwn nebula must push outward against this slow and massive shell .",
    "essentially , it may be possible that the cds in a sn  iin acts as a `` cage '' to confine the pwn , restricting its expansion and thereby increasing the energy density inside the volume of the pwn .",
    "this may make the pwn appear brighter than it otherwise would be .",
    "a pulsar born in a normal sn  ii - p would only need to push outward against the slowest inner ejecta of the sn , which constitute a much smaller fraction of the total mass of the progenitor star , and may not as easily confine the pwn .",
    "if the crab nebula is the end product of a type  iin sn explosion , as described above , then there is no need to invoke the existence of a hypothetical extended , rapidly expanding sn envelope outside the crab that retains most of the mass and energy of the exploded star ( hester 2008 ) . in a model where a type  iin event powers the high luminosity of sn  1054 despite the low explosion energy , the outer edge of the crab s shell of thermal filaments is the remnant of the cds .",
    "the lack of any observational evidence for the putative fast envelope and the lack of any observed signature of a blast wave far outside the crab are both , therefore , expected if sn  1054 was a type iin event .",
    "this model predicts that continued efforts to measure a massive outer fast envelope will only produce deeper upper limits .",
    "there is a possibility that there could be a remaining exterior blast wave if the forward shock accelerated through a steep density gradient after exiting a dense csm shell ( see smith 2013 ) , but this would involve very little mass and kinetic energy , and has probably cooled significantly in the past 1000 yr since explosion .",
    "we do not expect to see an extended , fast , cold neutral ejected stellar envelope with any substantial mass ( several @xmath0 ) . if there are any surrounding clouds that show evidence for some outward acceleration by radiation pressure from the sn , it is likely that their accelerated mass and momentum are far less than would be expected for a 10@xmath8 erg blast wave .",
    "recent observations have placed much better constriants on the mass of dust that resides in the dense filaments of the crab nebula .",

    "far - ir observations with _ herschel _ ( gomez et al .",
    "2012 ) yield a surprisingly large mass of 0.10.2 @xmath0 of dust . with a filament gas mass of order 5 @xmath0 , this would suggest a gas / dust mass ratio of 25 - 50 , significantly higher than in the normal insterstellar medium , and indicative of very efficient dust condensation .",
    "this indicates that the dust formed from processed stellar ejecta .",
    "this dust mass is much higher than that which is deduced from ir measurements of normal sne ii - p , typically of order 10@xmath44 @xmath0 or less ( sugerman et al .",
    "2006 ; andrews et al.2010 ; meikle et al .",
    "the ir images of the crab have sufficient angular resolution to suggest that most of the emitting dust resides in the filaments , and not in a hypothetical envelope outside the crab .",
    "this confirms the indication that dust resides in the filaments themselves , based on the fact that some filaments on the near side of the crab s shell are seen in silhouette against the synchrotron continuum ( fesen & blair 1990 ) .",
    "if the crab is the result of a type  iin supernova , then csm interaction that formed the thin cds might also have precipitated efficient dust formation .",
    "studies of the type  ibn event sn  2006jc showed that dust formed efficiently and quickly ( @xmath450 days after explosion ) as the sn ejecta crashed into dense he - rich csm ( smith et al .",
    "mounting evidence from studies of sne  iin suggest that these compressed post - shock layers may be efficient sites of dust formation in h - rich sne  iin as well ( see smith et al .",
    "2012 , and references therein ) .",
    "the efficient raditaive cooling and very high densities in the post - shock zones may lead to much more efficient and rapid dust formation in sne iin as compared to normal sne where the ejecta expand rapidly and the density quickly drops .",
    "the drop in luminosity after the plateau of sne  iin in particular may aid the formation of dust , because the cds temperature will drop while the density is still very high .",
    "indeed , the very low late - time luminosity and red color of sne iin - p like sn  2011ht seem to suggest efficient dust formation ( mauerhan et al .",
    "such rapid dust formation in the filaments of the crab is harder to explain in the standard model of sn  1054 as a normal sn , which lacks such a dense and thin cooling layer .      taken together , the crab nebula and the sub - class of sne iin - p provide strong evidence that a subset of sne  iin arise from the lowest - mass progenitor stars that can undergo core collapse .",
    "these are super - agb stars in the range 8 - 10 @xmath0 that suffer an ecsn rather than an fe core collapse event .    in that case",
    ", the class of sne  iin must be a fairly heterogeneous collection of explosions , with both very high mass progenitors and low - mass progenitors .",
    "in addition to the low - mass 8 - 10 @xmath0 super - agb stars that may produce sne  iin - p , some sne  iin may arise from star systems with even lower initial masses below 8  @xmath0 ; these are the so - called `` hybrid '' type ia / iin objects , that seem to result from type ia explosions surrounded by dense h - rich csm , such as sn  2002ic ( e.g. , chugai & yungelson 2004 ; silverman et al .  2013 ; and references therein ) .",
    "at the other extreme , there are several arguments that sne  iin are associated with very massive progenitor stars as well .",

    "thus , there is strong and direct evidence that very massive lbv - like stars do sometimes explode as sne  iin .",

    "in that case , there is no apparent conflict with the ecsn model suggested here for the crab , since at least in principle , an ecsn may or may not have dense - enough csm to raise its luminosity appreciably . with the expected explosion energy and @xmath2ni yield , the luminosities of the faintest sne ii - p match expectations for ecsn with no significant csm interaction .    another class of transients that has been linked to ecsne by some authors ( thompson et al .  2009 ; botticella et al .",
    "2009 ) is the sub - class of sn impostors whose archetypes are sn  2008s and the 2008 transient in ngc  300 ( ngc  300-ot ) .",
    "the motivations for this link are that ( 1 ) the progenitors are consistent with short - lived dust - enshrounded stars of relatively low initial mass ( prieto et al.2008 , 2009 ; thompson et al .  2009 ) , reminiscent of the super - agb stars expected as the progenitors of ecsne , and ( 2 ) various factors suggest that the transients are explosive ( e.g. , kochanek 2011 ) . with durations of @xmath4100 d and",
    "peak absolute magnitudes around @xmath514 mag , the total radiated energy of these events is a few 10@xmath45 erg , or a fraction of only @xmath410@xmath44 of the expected explosion energy of an ecsn .",
    "this is a factor of 10 lower than the luminosity and radiated energy in the low - luminosity sne  ii - p like sn  2005cs .",
    "a potential conflict in this picture is that the spectra of these transients exhibit narrow lines and no significant broad absorption at the times of peak luminosity , similar to the spectra of sne  iin .",
    "this , in turn , suggests that they are dominated by strong csm interaction . yet , these sn impostor transients are a factor of @xmath45 less luminous than even the faintest sne ii - p discussed above .",
    "csm interaction can generate a lower luminosity if the dense csm only occupies a small fraction of the solid angle of the explosion , but in that case the spectrum should also reveal the bare ecsn photosphere ( which should show broad lines similar to sn  2005cs ) , and moreover , the level of dust obscuration around the progenitors seems to require that the dense csm covers a large fraction of the solid angle .",
    "the csm mass of order 1 @xmath0 around these progenitors ( wesson et al.2010 ) and the observed line widths would require that csm interaction from a 10@xmath1 erg explosion would either be several times more luminous or would last much longer than 100 days ( i.e. as in the 10 yr long great eruption of @xmath42  carinae , if it was powered by csm interaction in a 10@xmath1 erg explosion ; smith 2013 ) , and would convert a larger fraction of the kinetic energy into light .",
    "( it is not clear yet if the integrated ir luminosity can make up the difference , but perhaps continued study will answer this . ) because an ecsn that interacts with csm should be significantly more luminous than the faint sne  ii - p , not less luminous , this suggests that sn impostors probably arise from explosive transients of lower energy ( 10@xmath46 ergs ) .",
    "unless an ecsn can produce an explosion energy this low , there is probably some other physical mechanism for these sn impostors and related transients that is different from the crab and sne iin - p . discussing these numerous other possibilities",
    "is beyond the scope of this paper .",

    "<S> these events probably arise from relatively low - energy ( 10@xmath1 erg ) explosions with low @xmath2ni yield that may result from electron - capture sn ( ecsn ) explosions , but their high visual - wavelength luminosity and type  iin spectra are dominated by shock interaction with dense circumstellar material ( csm ) rather than the usual recombination photosphere . in this interaction , </S>",
    "<S> a large fraction of the 10@xmath1 ergs of total kinetic energy can be converted to visual - wavelength luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> after about 120 days , nearly all of the mass outside the neutron star in the csm and ejecta ends up in a slowly expanding ( 1000 - 1500 km s@xmath3 ) thin dense shell , which is then accelerated and fragmented by the growing pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) in the subsequent 1000 yr , producing the complex network of filaments seen today . </S>",
    "<S> there is no need to invoke the extended , invisible fast sn envelope hypothesized to reside outside the crab . </S>",
    "<S> as differentiated from a normal sn  ii - p , sne  iin - p provide a much better explanation for several observed features of the crab : ( 1 ) no blast wave outside the crab nebula filaments , ( 2 ) no rapidly expanding sn envelope outside the filaments , ( 3 ) a total mass of @xmath45 @xmath0 swept up in a thin slow shell , ( 4 ) a low kinetic energy of the crab at least an order of magnitude below a normal core - collapse sn , ( 5 ) a high peak luminosity ( @xmath518 mag ) despite the low kinetic energy , ( 6 ) chemical abundances consistent with an 8 - 10 @xmath0 star , and ( 7 ) a low @xmath2ni yield . </S>",
