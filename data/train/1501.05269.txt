    "when computing the numbers of inhabitants and workers in each cell we do not consider the diagonal of the od matrix .",
    "this means that we omit the individuals who live and work in the same cell ( considered as ` immobile ' at this spatial scale ) .    in order to extract a simple signature of the od matrix",
    ", we proceed in two steps .",
    "we first extract both the residential and the work locations with a large density  the so called ` hotspots ' ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "the number of residents of cell @xmath5 is given by @xmath7 and its number of workers is given by @xmath8 .",
    "the hotspots then correspond to local maxima of these quantities .",
    "it is important to note that the method is general , and does not depend on how we determine these hotspots .",
    "once we have determined the cells that are the residential and the work hotspots ( some cells can possibly be both ) , we proceed to the second and main step of the method .",
    "we reorder the rows and columns of the od matrix in order to separate hotspots from non - hotspots .",
    "we put the @xmath9 residential hotspots on the top lines , and do the same for columns by putting the @xmath10 work hotspots on the left columns .",
    "the od matrix then becomes a 4-quadrants matrix where the flows @xmath2 are spatially positioned in the matrix with respect to their nature : on the top left the individuals that live in hotspots and work in hotspots ; at the top right the individuals that live in hotspots and do not work in hotspots ; at the bottom left individuals that do not live in hotspots but work in hotspots ; and finally in the bottom right corner the individuals that neither live or work in hotspots . for each quadrant",
    "we sum the number of commuters and normalize it by the total number of commuters in the od matrix , which gives the proportion of individuals in each of the four categories of flows . in other words , for a given city , we reduce the od matrix to a @xmath0 matrix @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the proportion of * * i**ntegrated flows that go from residential hotspots to work hotspots ;          by construction , we have @xmath16 $ ] and @xmath17 .",

    ", we can compute the importance of each commuting flow category and get a simple picture of the mobility structure in the city . ]",
    "large scale individual mobility networks are nowadays extracted from pervasive geolocated data , such as mobile phone , gps , public transport cards or social apps data  @xcite . in particular ,",
    "if an individual s mobile phone geolocated activity is available during a sufficiently long period of time , it is possible  under certain regularity conditions  to infer the most likely locations of her home and her workplace , and by aggregation to construct od matrices  @xcite .",
    "several parameters however impact the construction of od matrices such as the nature of the data source ( survey or user - generated geolocated data ) , or the spatial scale at which the od matrix is built which can be dictated by administrative units ( divisions in wards , counties , municipalities , etc . ) or by technical reasons such as the density of antennas in the case of mobile phone data .",
    "given this variety of data collection protocols , it is thus particularly remarkable that when considering the commuting flows at a city scale , various sources of pervasive data provide a very similar mobility information when compared to the od matrices built from surveys  @xcite .",
    "this result needs to be confirmed for other cities and countries , but it already opens the door to a systematic use of pervasive , geolocated data as a relevant substitute to traditional transport surveys .    in the following we apply our icdr method to od matrices that have been extracted from mobile phone records in thirty - one spanish urban areas during a five weeks period",
    "( see the methods section for details on the dataset and the calculation of the od matrices ) .      as described above",
    ", the first step consists in determining hotspots .",
    "several possible methods have been proposed in the literature  @xcite , and we use here a parameter - free method based on the lorenz curve of the densities that we have proposed in a recent study ( see  @xcite and the methods section ) .",
    "once we have determined both the origin ( residential ) hotspots and the destination ( work ) hotspots in each city , we first observe how their number scale with the population size of the city .",
    "both these numbers for residential and employment hotspots scale sublinearly with the population size ( see supplementary figures 4 and 5 ) .",
    "the number of work hotspots grows significantly slower than the number of residential hotspots , showing that residential areas are ( i ) more dispersed in the city , and ( ii ) are more numerous than activity centers , as intuitively expected ( see supplementary figure 6 that displays the locations of home and work hotspots in four cities that exhibit different spatial organizations ) .",
    "we also note here that the sublinear scaling of the work hotspots confirms previous results obtained with a totally different dataset ( the number of employment centers in us cities ) @xcite .",
    "we now apply the second part of the method in order to calculate the @xmath22,@xmath19,@xmath20 and @xmath21 values for each od matrix . for the 31 spanish urban areas under study ( see supplementary figure 1 ) , we obtain the values shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : icdr - values ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig : icdr - values](a ) , we plot these values versus the population size of these cities . for this sample of cities we see that globally the proportion @xmath22 of individuals that commute from hotspot to hotspot decreases as the population size increases , while the proportion @xmath21 of ` random ' flows increases and the proportions @xmath19 and @xmath20 of convergent and divergent flows seem surprisingly constant whatever the city size . in fig .  [",
    "fig : icdr - values](b ) we plot the same values but sorted by decreasing values of @xmath22 which shows clearly that the @xmath22 and @xmath21 values are the relevant parameters for distinguishing cities from each other .",
    "we also notice that the values obtained for another spatial scale of data aggregation confirm this trend ( see supplementary figure 7 ) .",
    "the decay of @xmath22 flows ( integrated ) flows in favor of @xmath21 flows ( random ) when @xmath23 increases shows that the population growth among spanish cities goes with a decentralization of both activity places and residences .",
    "as cities get bigger , their numbers of residential and employment hotspots grow ( sublinearly ) , but these hotspots catch a smaller part of the commuting flows .      in order to evaluate to",
    "what extent the @xmath24 signatures of cities are characteristic of their commuting structure , we compare these values to the ones returned by a null model of commuting flows . for each city",
    "we generate random od matrices of the same size than the reference od matrix but with random flows of individuals that preserve the in- and out- degree of each node ( see supplementary note 5 ) .",
    "fig  [ fig : icdr - values](c ) shows the average values and standard deviation obtained for 100 replications . on fig",
    "[ fig : icdr - values](d ) we plot the z - scores of the @xmath22 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 values of each city when compared to the values @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 returned by our null model ( e.g. for the quantity @xmath21 of the city @xmath5 , the z - score is given by @xmath29 ) . essentially , we observe that the z - scores of @xmath22 and @xmath21 are positive and large , while those of @xmath19 and @xmath20 are negative ( and large in absolute value ) . also as cities grow , the z - scores of @xmath22 and @xmath21 increase while those of @xmath19 and @xmath20 decrease .",
    "these results demonstrate that the larger a city , and the less random it appears .",
    "this is in contrast with the naive expectation that the larger a city and the more disordered is the structure of individuals mobility . for large cities",
    ", there seems to be a commuting backbone which can not result from purely random movements of individuals .",
    "this backbone is the footprint of the city s structure and history , and probably results from strong constraints and efficiency considerations .",
    "since our method first requires to determine origin and destination hotspots , one could argue that the interpretation of the @xmath22,@xmath19,@xmath20 and @xmath21 values will crucially depend on the particular method chosen to define these hotspots .",
    "the identification of hotspots is a problem that has been broadly discussed in urban economics ( see supplementary note 3 ) . roughly speaking , starting from a spatial distribution of densities ,",
    "the goal is to identify the local maxima and amounts to choose a threshold @xmath30 for the density @xmath31 of individuals : a cell @xmath5 is a hotspot if the local density of people is such that @xmath32 . in order to test the impact of the choice of a particular threshold @xmath30 on the resulting @xmath24 values",
    ", we measure the sensitivity of these values as a function of the density threshold @xmath30 ( see supplementary figure 8) .",
    "as expected , the lower the density threshold , the larger the number of origin and destination hotspots , and consequently the larger @xmath22 and the smaller @xmath21 .",
    "in contrast , changing the density threshold has little impact on the @xmath19 and @xmath20 terms .",
    "more importantly , the conclusions drawn from the comparison of the @xmath24 values across cities remain the same : whatever the density threshold @xmath30 chosen to define residential / employment hotspots , we still observe the same qualitative behavior : a decay of integrated flows ( @xmath22 ) in favor of ` random ' flows ( @xmath21 ) , when the population size increases .",
    "we now want to characterize spatially these different flows and the relation between city size and the commuting distances traveled by individuals . in each city",
    "we compute the average distance traveled by individuals per type of flows @xmath22,@xmath19,@xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the resulting average distances measured in data are plotted in red on fig .",
    "[ fig : avg - norm - commuting - dist](a ) .",
    "we observe that the average distance for all categories of flows increases with population size , an expected effect as the city s area also grows with population size .",
    "we also observe that the average distance of convergent flows @xmath19 increases faster than for other types of flows ( we note that the average distance associated to convergent flows increases more than the distance associated to divergent flows @xmath20 , showing that these flows are not symmetric as one could have naively expected ) .",
    "this result means that for this set of spanish cities , commuters from small residential areas to important activity centers travel on average a longer distance than all other individuals .",
    "this observation could be an indication that for our set of cities , residential areas have expanded while activity centers remained at their location , leading to longer commuting distances ( see supplementary figures 10 and 11 when considering various spatial scales of aggregation ) .",
    "another interesting information is provided by the comparison of distances measured in the data with average distances measured from the random od matrices generated by the null model .",
    "the average distances associated to the null model are plotted in blue in fig .",
    "[ fig : avg - norm - commuting - dist](a ) .",
    "we see that for all types of flows the distances measured in the empirical data are shorter than those generated by the null model .",
    "this is another clear indication of the spatial organization of individual flows in cities .",
    "it also highlights the importance of the travel time budget in the residential locations choice .",
    "remarkably enough , the distance of convergent flows ( c ) is both the largest and the one that increases the fastest with population , indicating a low degree of efficiency .    the comparison of this behavior with the null model leads to interesting results .",
    "[ fig : avg - norm - commuting - dist](b ) we plot the ratio @xmath33 for the four types of flow .",
    "values lower than @xmath34 indicate that the average commuting distance generated by the null model is shorter than the distance observed in the city .",
    "surprisingly , we observe that small cities display a value less than one indicating the lesser importance of space at this short scale .",
    "we also see that this ratio increases faster for random flows ( @xmath21 ) than for the others ( @xmath35 ) , suggesting a remarkable spatial structure of these @xmath21 flows .",
    "we also consider the fraction of total commuting distance by type of flow ( fig .",
    "[ fig : total - commuting - dist ] ) .",
    "we see that for each type of flows , their respective fraction is constant and independent of city size . with the loubar hotspots detection method @xcite ( see supplementary figure 3 ) and with a grid of @xmath36 square cells",
    ", we measure that roughly @xmath37 of the total commuting distance is made on random flows while the other types represent each about @xmath38 .",
    "this result shows that the method is able to identify where most of the commuting distance is traveled .",
    "in particular , we see that the natural , obvious flows ( i ) from residential centers to activity centers are not the most important ones , and that the decentralization of commuting flows seems to be the rule for the spanish cities in our sample .",
    "finally , the @xmath24 signature of their od matrix allows to cluster cities with respect to the structure of their commuting patterns .",
    "we measure the euclidian distance between the cities @xmath24 signatures and we then perform a hierarchical cluster analysis . fig .",
    "[ fig : dendrogram ] shows the dendrogram resulting from the classification .",
    "four well - separated clusters are identified on this dendrogram , and table  [ table : classe - profiles ] gives the average value of each term along with the average population of the cities composing the cluster . remarkably these summary statistics show that largest cities are clustered together and are characterized by a larger proportion of ` random ' flows ( @xmath21 ) of individuals both living and working in parts of the city that are not the dominant residential and activity centers .",
    "this can be interpreted as an increased facility in bigger urban areas to commute from any part of the city to any other part .",
    "further studies on other cities and countries are needed at this stage in order to discuss the relevance of the proposed classification .",
    "it is also important to test the robustness of this classification and we show that introducing a reasonable amount of noise in the od matrices does not change the classification ( see methods and supplementary figure 12 ) .",
    "this sensitivity test confirms that the clustering is robust against possible errors in the data source and in the extraction of the mobility networks .",
    "the classification of cities based on their @xmath24 values is also reasonnably robust to a change of the method used to define residential and employment hotspots ( see supplementary figure 13 ) .",
    "comparing properties of cities of very different population sizes and areas requires to rely on a harmonized , spatial delimitation of cities that goes beyond the administrative boundaries defined by national authorities .",
    "these administrative boundaries may be somewhat arbitrary and do not follow neither the morphological nor functionnal spatial footprint of the city . to this end",
    "we have chosen to rely on the _ urban areas _ defined by the audes initiative ( areas urbanas de espaa : audes project .",
    "documentation and open data available at http://alarcos.esi.uclm.es/per/fruiz/audes/ ( accessed january 27 , 2014 ) ) .",
    "this project is an attempt to capture some coherent spatial delimitations of spanish cities regarding the ( journey to work ) commuting patterns of individuals living in the core city of each urban area and in their surrounding municipalities .",
    "these delimitations are built upon statistical criteria based on the proportion of residents of surrounding municipalities that commute to the main city to work .",
    "the locations and spatial boundaries of the 31 spanish urban areas analysed in this study are represented on supplementary figure s1 .",
    "we remove the btss with zero mobile phone users and we compute the voronoi cells associated with each btss of the urban area ( hereafter called ua ) .",
    "we remark in supplementary figure s2a that there are four types of voronoi cells :    1 .",
    "the voronoi cells contained in the ua 2 .",
    "the voronoi cells partitionned between the ua and the territory outside the ua .",
    "the voronoi cells between the ua and the sea ( noted s ) .",
    "4 .   the voronoi cells between the ua , the territory outside the ua and the sea .    to compute the number of users associated with the intersections between the voronoi cells and the ua we have to take into account these different types of voronoi cells .",
    "let @xmath9 be the number of voronoi cells , @xmath39 the number of mobile phone users in the voronoi cell @xmath40 and @xmath41 the area of the voronoi cell @xmath40 , latexmath:[$v",
    "\\in        we note in equation [ eq : vua ] that we remove the intersection of the voronoi area with the sea , indeed , we assume that the number of users calling from the sea are negligeable .",
    "now we consider the number of mobile phone users @xmath44 and the associated area @xmath45 of the voronoi cells intersecting the ua ( see supplementary figure s2b ) .",
    "we can not directly extract an od matrix between the grid cells with the mobile phone data because each users home and work locations are identified by the voronoi cells .",
    "thus , we need a transition matrix @xmath23 to transform the bts od matrix @xmath46 into a grid od matrix @xmath47 .",
    "let @xmath9 be the number of voronoi cells covering the urban area and @xmath3 be the number of grid cells .",
    "let @xmath46 be the od matrix between btss where @xmath48 is the number of commuters between the bts @xmath5 and the bts @xmath6 . to transform the matrix @xmath46 into an od matrix between grid cells @xmath47 we define the transition matrix @xmath23 where @xmath49 is the area of the intersection between the grid cell @xmath5 and the bts @xmath6",
    ". then we normalize @xmath23 by column in order to consider a proportion of the btss areas instead of an absolut value , thus we obtain a new matrix @xmath50 ( equation [ eq : pchap ] ) .",
    "a city is divided in @xmath3 cells and the data give us access to its @xmath1 od matrix extracted from the mobile phone data . after straightforward calculation",
    "we obtain the distributions @xmath53 and @xmath54 of the numbers of residents / workers in the @xmath3 cells composing the city .",
    "the determination of centres and subcentres is a problem which has been broadly tackled in urban economics ( see for example the references given in the paper and references in @xcite ) . starting from a spatial distribution of densities , the goal is to identify the local maxima .",
    "this is in principle a simple problem solved by the choice of a threshold @xmath55 for the density @xmath31 : a cell @xmath5 is a hotspot if the density of users @xmath56 .",
    "it is however clear that such method based on a fixed threshold introduce some arbitrariness due to the choice of @xmath55 , and also requires prior knowledge of the city to which it is applied to choose a relevant value of @xmath55 . in @xcite",
    "we proposed a generic method to determine hotspots from the lorenz curve of the densities .",
    "in the following we quickly introduce the principle of the method and its application to the determination of the residential and work hotspots of each city .",
    "we invite the interested readers to refer to @xcite for further discussion on this method .",
    "we first sort @xmath53 and @xmath54 in increasing order , and denote the ranked values by @xmath57 where @xmath3 is the number of cells .",
    "the two lorenz curves of the distribution of residents / workers are constructed by plotting on the x - axis the proportion of cells @xmath58 and on the y - axis the corresponding proportion of commuters @xmath59 with : @xmath60 if all the cells had the same number of residents / workers the lorenz curves would be the diagonal from @xmath61 to @xmath62 .",
    "in general we observe a concave curve with a more or less strong curvature . in the lorenz curve ,",
    "the stronger the curvature the stronger the inequality and , intuitively , the smaller the number of hotspots .",
    "this remark allows us to construct a criterion by relating the number of dominant places ( i.e. those that have a very high number of residents / workers compared to the other cells ) to the slope of the lorenz curve at point @xmath63 : the larger the slope , the smaller the number of dominant values in the statistical distribution .",
    "the natural way to identify the typical scale of the number of hotspots is to take the intersection point @xmath64 between the tangent of @xmath65 at point @xmath63 and the horizontal axis @xmath66 ( see suplementary figure s3 ) .",
    "this method is inspired from the classical scale determination for an exponential decay : if the decay from @xmath63 were an exponential of the form @xmath67 where @xmath4 is the typical scale we want to extract , this method would give @xmath68 ( see @xcite for further discussion ) .",
    "on supplementary figure s8 we plot the @xmath22,@xmath19,@xmath20,@xmath21 values of the 31 spanish urban areas as a function of the density threshold @xmath30 chosen to define hotspots ( here defined relatively to the density value @xmath69 returned by the loubar method  see section [ sec : hotspots - def ] ) ) .    in the extreme case represented on supplementary",
    "figure s9 all cells whose number of residents / workers are greater than the mean value of the distribution of residents / workers are tagged as hotspots ( see @xcite for a discussion of this criteria and his comparison to the \" loubar  criteria used in this study ) . with a much broader acceptation of what is an hotspot , it is obvious that the term @xmath22 will increase drastically since we increase both the number of residential hotspots and the number of work hotspots . still what is important to notice is that we can still observe the qualitative trend observed with the loubar method . as the population size increases , the decrease of the proportion @xmath22 of integrated flows",
    "is accompanied by an increase of the proportion @xmath21 of random flows .      in order to evaluate to",
    "what extent the @xmath24 values of a given city are characteristic of its commuting structure , we compare these values to the values returned by a reasonable null model of commuting flows . the guiding idea is to generate od matrices that ( i ) have the same size than the city s od matrix ( i.e that contain the same total number of individuals ) ; ( ii ) that respect the city s static spatial organisation ( i.e. the in- and out - degrees of all nodes should stay constant ) ; and ( iii ) that randomize the flows between the nodes , i.e. with different weights of the edges .",
    "such a null model of flows that respects the static organization of the city is indeed more reasonnable and realistic than a null model that would respect the total number of individuals in the matrix but that would modify the in- and out - degrees of the nodes .    to generate a random graph that conserves the in- and out- degree of each node of the reference graph",
