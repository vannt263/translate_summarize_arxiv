    "in the autumn of the year 2014 one can safely conclude that the sm - like higgs scenario  @xcite is being observed at the lhc @xcite .",
    "such a scenario can be realized in various models beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "it was found recently that the lhc is very effective in constraining models with so called higgs - portal to the dark matter ( dm ) , see eg .",
    "in particular , lhc results on the higgs boson properties can give stronger limits on the higgs - dm couplings than the astrophysical dm experiments .",
    "in addition , some important constraints are coming from the dedicated search of dark matter at the lhc  @xcite .",
    "let us start with a little bit of history .",
    "it was only 50 years ago when the quark model as well as the mass generation mechanism had been proposed .",
    "these were crucial steps towards building a theory of elementary particles known as the standard model .",
    "the first idea of a global su(3 ) symmetry arose from an observation and classification of a plethora of hadrons , which were being discovered copiously in early 1950s .",
    "it led to our current understanding of the structure of matter at the fundamental level , probed up to a distance of 10@xmath0  cm , in the form of 3 generations of quarks and leptons .",
    "the masses of these particles show no clear pattern , besides the fact that the second generation of fermions is heavier than the first one , and the third one is the heaviest . among the particles which are carriers of fundamental interactions , the photon ( electromagnetic interaction ) and the gluons ( strong interaction ) are massless , while @xmath1 and @xmath2 , the carriers of the electroweak force , are massive , actually very massive as compared to the proton .",
    "it was already known in the 1960s that this may create a serious problem in describing a very short range weak interaction ( a point - like interaction according to fermi ) in a theoretical approach based on a local symmetry .",
    "the brout - englert - higgs mechanism ( b - e - h ) , proposed already in 1960s , is based on spontaneous breaking of the ew symmetry @xmath3 to @xmath4@xcite .",
    "one su(2 ) doublet @xmath5 of spin 0 fields with a non - zero vacuum expectation value @xmath6 ( vev ) is introduced , and the gauge bosons and fermions acquire mass thanks to interaction with this constant field component .",
    "mass of @xmath7 generated in this way is equal to @xmath8 , and at tree level @xmath9 .",
    "masses of fermions are generated due to yukawa interaction with @xmath5 .",
    "the higgs boson @xmath10 which arises in the b - e - h mechanism has spin 0 , even cp parity and no electric charge .",
    "its couplings to the sm particles are all fixed , being proportional to their masses .",
    "the only unknown parameter is ( was ) @xmath11 related to the strength of higgs self - interaction .",
    "long term hunting for a higgs boson seems to have reached its finale in the summer 2012 , when at the lhc the higgs boson with mass around 125  gev has been discovered . up to now , with all collected data ( already 1 million of higgses ! ) , the signal strengths in various channels ( defined with respect to the sm prediction ) are close to 1 , and the observed scenario can be described as a sm - like higgs scenario .",
    "although the sm is in very good agreement with existing data , there are many serious arguments to go beyond it .",
    "the sm has many free parameters , contains massless neutrinos , does not have a dm candidate , can not describe baryon asymmetry of the universe , etc . the recently discovered 125  gev scalar has properties very close to those predicted by the sm . but how close ?",
    "as long as other new particles are not seen at the lhc the only relevant bsm models are those allowing for sm - like scenario , i.e. , with a sm - like higgs boson and other new particles too heavy or too weakly interacting to be observed in existing experiments .",
    "the main production channel of the higgs particle at the lhc is gluon - gluon fusion .",
    "the channels allowing most precise measurements are higgs decays to @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "loop couplings of the higgs to gauge bosons @xmath14 , @xmath15 ,",
    "@xmath16 are sensitive to new physics ( even to contribution of very heavy particles due to nondecoupling effects ) .",
    "the overall signal strength is equal to @xmath17 ( cms )  @xcite , @xmath18 ( atlas )  @xcite .      throughout the years",
    "much evidence for the existence of dm has been collected : rotation curves of galaxies , gravitational lensing , etc .",
    "@xcite . a typical candidate for dm",
    "is the so - called wimp ( weakly interacting massive particle ) .",
    "the dm relic density is inferred from the measurements made by wmap and planck with a good accuracy  @xcite .",
    "there are other astrophysical experiments searching for dm , either directly ( via scattering off nuclei ) or indirectly ( search for products of dm annihilation or decay ) .",
    "unfortunately , the picture given by these experiments is not entirely consistent .",
    "however , some information about dm can be drawn from the lhc measurements , and hopefully it can shed some light on its nature .",
    "among the simplest extensions of the higgs sector in the sm are models with two su(2 ) doublets ( two higgs doublet models  2hdms ) . in the non - supersymmetric 2hdms",
    "a special role is played by the inert doublet model ( idm )  the only version of 2hdm with a stable particle ( scalar )  @xcite .    in the idm",
    "the scalars interactions are defined by the following potential @xmath19+\\frac{1}{2}\\big[\\lambda_{1}(\\phi_{s}^{\\dagger}\\phi_{s})^{2}+\\lambda_{2}(\\phi_{d}^{\\dagger}\\phi_{d})^{2}\\big]\\\\   & + \\lambda_{3}(\\phi_{s}^{\\dagger}\\phi_{s})(\\phi_{d}^{\\dagger}\\phi_{d})+\\lambda_{4}(\\phi_{s}^{\\dagger}\\phi_{d})(\\phi_{d}^{\\dagger}\\phi_{s})+\\frac{1}{2}\\lambda_{5}\\big[(\\phi_{s}^{\\dagger}\\phi_{d})^{2}+(\\phi_{d}^{\\dagger}\\phi_{s})^{2}\\big].\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this potential possesses a global discrete @xmath20-type symmetry @xmath21 under an action of which the field @xmath22 changes sign , while @xmath23 remains untouched .",
    "the interactions with fermions are chosen in the idm such as to preserve this symmetry ,  i.e. , only @xmath23 couples to fermions . in this way",
    "the whole idm lagrangian is @xmath21-symmetric , and moreover , the vacuum state of this model is such that @xmath21 is not broken spontaneously .",
    "the vevs of the two doublets read @xmath24 with these choices the model possesses an exact @xmath21-symmetry , which leads to a conserved quantum number ( @xmath21 parity ) .",
    "because of that the lightest @xmath21-odd particle is stable , and constitutes a good candidate for a dm particle .",
    "the particle spectrum of the idm consists of the higgs boson @xmath10 which follows from the @xmath23 doublet , and the dark scalars @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 coming from @xmath22 . the higgs boson has all tree - level couplings to fermions and gauge bosons equal to the sm ones .",
    "nonetheless , some non - sm effects can occur at the loop level , due to the existence of new scalars .",
    "the dark scalars do not couple to fermions at tree level but they do interact with the gauge bosons ( through the covariant derivative ) and the higgs particle .",
    "the lightest one among them that is neutral plays the role of the dm particle .",
    "here we assume that @xmath28 , hence @xmath25 is the dm candidate in our model .",
    "deviations from the sm properties of the higgs boson can be observed in two ways , because of decays of the higgs into invisible dark particles or because of additional loop effects thereof . in the following",
    "we will first discuss invisible decays of the higgs boson , and then loop induced decay of the higgs boson to a pair of photons .",
    "the higgs boson of the idm has additional , non - sm decay channels leading to dark particles : @xmath29 .",
    "the last channel is excluded ( at tree - level ) by the lep limits for @xmath30 : @xmath31 .",
    "the partial decay width for the process @xmath32 reads ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) [ part ] ( hhh)= , where @xmath33 is proportional to the coupling between the higgs boson and a pair of dm particles . for the decay",
    "@xmath34 the parameters @xmath35 and @xmath36 have to be replaced by @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "since the decay width  ( [ part ] ) depends on the mass of the product of the decay and its coupling to the higgs boson , these quantities can be constrained with the use of the lhc results on the branching ratio of the higgs boson decay to invisible particles . in the same way the measurement of the total higgs decay width can be used , since @xmath39 contributes significantly to it ( see next section ) .",
    "below , for the sake of simplicity we will assume that @xmath26 is too heavy for the @xmath34 process to be allowed , i.e. , @xmath40 and @xmath41 . in fig .",
    "[ invisible ] the constraints on @xmath35 and @xmath36 , coming from experimental constraints on br@xmath42  @xcite and on the total width @xmath43  @xcite , are presented . from fig .",
    "[ invisible ] one can see that the coupling @xmath35 is constrained by br@xmath44 to a small value , @xmath45 for @xmath46 .     and @xmath36 following from the lhc measurement of br@xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "the region between the corresponding curves is allowed .",
    "we assume that the decay @xmath34 is kinematically forbidden .",
    "[ invisible ] ]      the differences between the sm and the idm can also be observed in the loop induced decays of the higgs boson , @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "the first of these decays , being measured very precisely , recently gained much attention , since the first measurements showed some deviation from the sm expectation giving a hint on the existence of new physics .",
    "nowadays , these measurements converged to the sm , as the observed signal strengths ( often denoted by @xmath52 ) are @xmath53 ( atlas )  @xcite , @xmath54 ( cms )  @xcite , where the expectation of the sm is @xmath55 .",
    "we see , than new physics effects are still acceptable within the experimental bounds .",
    "note that the @xmath56 signal strength has not yet been measured with enough precision to constrain new physics .",
    "let us consider @xmath57 for the 125 gev-@xmath10 in the idm ( see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) r_:= , where we have used the narrow - width approximation and the fact that the main production cross section @xmath58 is in the idm the same as in the sm .    in the formula above @xmath59 is known , and @xmath60 .",
    "all the tree - level decay widths of the higgs boson to sm particles are in the idm the same as in the sm .",
    "only the existence of the invisible decay channels , and the @xmath49 , and @xmath56 decays can modify the total decay width .",
    "however , branching ratios of the latter are very small , at the order of @xmath61 so they can be ignored , and to a good approximation , only invisible channels modify @xmath48 ( we used this fact already in sec .",
