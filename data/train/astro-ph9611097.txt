    "the origin in nature of the neutron - rich isotopes heavier than the iron group remains uncertain , but rapid progress in both theory and observation has been made in recent years .",
    "for example , analysis of the metal deficient star cs 22892 - 052 ( [ fe / h ] @xmath9 ) by sneden et al .",
    "( 1996 ) shows striking evidence that the solar abundance pattern for the @xmath0-process isotopes exists even at very early times in our galaxy , and suggests an origin for these nuclei quite distinct from the @xmath10-process .",
    "the fact that the @xmath0-process abundance pattern in this very metal deficient star is so strikingly solar across the entire range @xmath11 also suggests that this pattern is generic and reflects the conditions constantly obtained in a unique astrophysical environment responsible for the @xmath0-process .",
    "however , we note that the current observational data for @xmath12 are not so conclusive .    on the theoretical front",
    ", many recent calculations ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) have shown that a promising site for @xmath0-process nucleosynthesis is the neutrino - driven wind blowing from a nascent neutron star following a core - collapse - driven supernova .",
    "this @xmath0-process site has some attractive features .",
    "first of all , the @xmath0-process would be primary , in accordance with the observation of @xcite ( see also @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , the total mass loss in the wind approximately accounts for the amount of @xmath0-process material ejected per supernova , @xmath13 , as expected from the supernova rate and total @xmath0-process yields of the galaxy .",
    "finally , the conditions in the wind are determined by the properties of the neutron star and the characteristics of its neutrino emission .",
    "therefore , the @xmath0-process nucleosynthesis might be approximately constant from event to event , reflecting the near constancy of the neutron star mass and cooling history , if possible complications due to fallback could be ignored",
    ".    however , problems have emerged in the theoretical model .",
    "the successful @xmath0-process calculations , with the possible exception of woosley et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , all utilize parametric modifications to the key parameters , especially an artificial increase in the entropy .",
    "the high entropies of wilson s supernova model reported in woosley et al .",
    "( 1994 ) have not been replicated elsewhere .",
    "this discrepancy has been emphasized by the analytic calculations of qian & woosley ( 1996 , hereafter paper i ) . in general , the deficiency in entropy is only a factor of two , but the gap is proving difficult to bridge .",
    "paper i also suggested that other relevant parameters of the problem , especially a short dynamic time scale or large neutron excess , might compensate for the low entropy , or that there may emerge other sources of entropy hitherto neglected .",
    "but , for the time being , a potentially beautiful solution to a classic problem  the origin of the @xmath0-process  falters by a factor of two .",
    "we will not resolve this quandary in the present paper .",
    "what we shall do however , is : a ) show that the standard models of the neutrino - driven wind derived in paper i give interesting nucleosynthesis above the iron group , but with the electron fractions obtained in woosley et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , do not give the classical @xmath0-process ; and b ) determine , both analytically and numerically , the conditions that _ are _ required in this sort of model to produce the @xmath0-process , in particular the platinum peak .",
    "an @xmath0-process might occur for various combinations of entropy , electron fraction , and dynamic time scale .",
    "different authors , using numerical supernova models , have arrived at qualitatively different values for these key parameters in the neutrino - driven wind . in order to obtain a better understanding of the physical conditions ,",
    "both analytic and numerical studies of the wind were carried out in paper i. the primary goal of that paper was to examine the dependencies of the physical parameters in the wind on the neutron star mass ( @xmath14 ) and radius ( @xmath15 ) , and the emergent neutrino luminosity ( @xmath16 ) and energy spectra .",
    "the analytic study was in the same spirit as that of duncan , shapiro , & wasserman ( 1986 ) , but was more extensive and directed towards nucleosynthetic issues .",
    "the analytic results of paper i were given by equations ( 48a ) , ( 48b ) , and ( 49 ) for the entropy ( @xmath1 ) , equations ( 58a ) and ( 58b ) for the mass outflow rate ( @xmath17 ) , equation ( 61 ) for the dynamic time scale ( @xmath18 ) , and equation ( 77 ) for the electron fraction ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "physically , the first three parameters ( @xmath1 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 ) are determined by the sum of heating produced by all neutrinos , whereas the evolution of @xmath2 mostly reflects the difference between the @xmath19 and @xmath20 fluxes through the inter - conversion of free nucleons by @xmath19 and @xmath20 captures . as discussed in paper",
    "i , the first three parameters are not sensitive to the exact values of @xmath2 , and their determination can be essentially decoupled from the evolution of @xmath2 in the wind .",
    "the analytic results for these three parameters were tested by a series of numerical calculations using the one - dimensional implicit hydrodynamic code kepler .",
    "a total of nine models were studied .",
    "the neutron star mass and radius , and neutrino luminosity at the inner boundary of these models were varied to observe the corresponding effects on these three parameters .",
    "a comparison between analytic and numerical results was summarized in table 1 of paper i.    from these numerical models , we have extracted the velocity ( @xmath21 ) , density ( @xmath22 ) , and temperature ( @xmath23 ) of a mass element as functions of its position ( @xmath0 ) in a steady - state wind .",
    "using @xmath24 , we can obtain the evolution of @xmath0 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 with time @xmath25 for the mass element .",
    "starting at @xmath26 ( @xmath27 is the temperature in units of @xmath28 k ) , when nuclear statistical equilibrium ( nse ) is assured , we then follow the time evolution of the nuclear composition in this mass element with a reaction network ( @xcite ) , until the composition freezes out at @xmath29 . to good accuracy , the mass element is initially composed of free nucleons , in proportions specified by the initial electron fraction @xmath30",
    ". the initial electron fraction is essentially determined by the equilibrium between @xmath19 and @xmath20 captures on free neutrons and protons , respectively ( @xcite ; see also paper i ) .",
    "if we denote the rates for @xmath19 and @xmath20 captures on free nucleons as @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively , the initial electron fraction is given by @xmath33 in turn , the rate @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) is determined by the @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) luminosity and energy spectrum .    in realistic supernova models ,",
    "the neutrino luminosity and energy spectra evolve with time .",
    "the individual wind models of paper i represent the steady - state configurations reached at different neutrino luminosities over time scales much shorter than the evolution time scales of the neutrino luminosity and energy spectra .",
    "because the time evolution of the neutrino energy spectra is much less pronounced than that of the neutrino luminosity , two generic sets of neutrino mean energies were assumed for these models . from the analytic results of paper",
    "i , we can see that the mass loss rate , the dynamic time scale , and especially the entropy would not change significantly if a more precise prescription of the neutrino energy spectra were used .",
    "however , because the electron fraction is sensitive to the difference between the @xmath19 and @xmath20 fluxes , and the nature of heavy element nucleosynthesis is extremely sensitive to @xmath2 , in this paper we calculate the @xmath19 and @xmath20 reaction rates according to the time evolution of neutrino luminosity and energy spectra in wilson s 20 m@xmath36 supernova model used in woosley et al .",
    "specifically , we take from wilson s supernova model the neutrino energy spectra corresponding to the same neutrino luminosity as in the wind model . starting with the initial value in equation ( 1 ) , we then follow the evolution of @xmath2 in the reaction network , taking into account @xmath19 and @xmath20 captures on free nucleons and heavy nuclei ( @xcite ) , electron and positron captures on free nucleons and heavy nuclei , and nuclear @xmath37-decays .",
    "the results of the nucleosynthesis calculations are presented in tables 13 .",
    "the entropy , the initial electron fraction , and the dynamic time scale are given for each wind model .",
    "the dynamic time scale roughly corresponds to the time over which the temperature changes by one @xmath38-fold ( paper i ) . in order to check the influence of the neutrino flux on the nucleosynthesis",
    ", we have carried out five different calculations .",
    "all runs included electron and positron captures on free nucleons and nuclei , as well as nuclear @xmath37-decays .",
    "the individual runs differ in the inclusion of various neutrino reactions . respectively",
    ", they cover the cases including ( 1 ) no neutrino reactions ( column 2 ) , ( 2 ) @xmath19 and @xmath20 captures on free nucleons only ( column 3 ) , ( 3 ) @xmath19 and @xmath20 captures on free nucleons , and neutral - current neutrino spallation on @xmath39-particles ( column 4 ) , ( 4 ) @xmath19 and @xmath20 captures on free nucleons and nuclei ( column 5 ) , and ( 5 ) @xmath19 and @xmath20 captures on free nucleons and nuclei , as well as neutral - current neutrino spallation on @xmath39-particles ( column 6 ) . for all runs ,",
    "we give the electron fraction ( @xmath40 ) , the average mass number of nuclei excluding free nucleons and @xmath39-particles ( @xmath41 ) , and the neutron and @xmath39-particle mass fractions ( @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) at the freeze - out of the charged - particle reactions ( @xmath44 ) .    in figures 19 , detailed nucleosynthesis results from the runs that included",
    "@xmath19 and @xmath20 captures on free nucleons ( column 3 in tables 1 - 3 ) are given in terms of the production factor , defined as the final mass fraction ( after all weak decays ) of a given stable nucleus divided by its solar abundance ( @xcite ) .",
    "these results are also representative of the nucleosynthesis obtained in the other runs . in these figures , the most abundant isotope in the solar abundance distribution for a given element is plotted as an asterisk .",
    "isotopes of a given element are connected by solid lines .",
    "a diamond around a data point indicates that the isotope is produced chiefly as a ( neutron - rich ) radioactive progenitor .",
    "the dotted horizontal lines represent an approximate `` normalization band , '' bounded from above by the largest production factor in the calculation and from below by a production factor four times smaller .",
    "nuclei that fall within this band will be the dominant species produced . in figures 19 , no re - normalization has been attempted .",
    "models 10a  f produced interesting nucleosynthesis representative of the @xmath39-process ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the most abundant nuclei produced have mass numbers @xmath45 .",
    "model 10a ( @xmath46 , @xmath47 per baryon ) shows the production of the @xmath48 closed - neutron - shell nuclei which were grossly overproduced in previous studies .",
    "models 10b and c , with progressively lower neutrino luminosity and lower values of @xmath2 , made heavier nuclei .",
    "production of sn , sb , and te was not accurately calculated , as the radioactive progenitors for these species were isotopes of ru , the last element in our reaction network .",
    "models 30a  c produced nuclei near the iron group .",
    "model 30a exhibits interesting nucleosynthesis for @xmath49 , while model 30c shows the production of @xmath50zn ( made as itself ) , the dominant isotope of this element .",
    "this nucleus was not accounted for in the surveys of galactic chemical evolution and nucleosynthesis in massive stars ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , and appears to be made predominantly under conditions similar to those obtained in the neutrino - driven wind ( @xcite ) .    from tables 13 , it is also clear that inclusion of the neutrino reactions made a difference .",
    "the @xmath19 and @xmath20 captures on free nucleons have the largest effect .",
    "the electron fraction increases appreciably due to these capture reactions when free nucleons are being assembled into @xmath39-particles .",
    "this so - called `` @xmath39-effect '' ( @xcite ; @xcite ) is evident when we compare the case including no neutrino reactions ( column 2 ) with the cases including various neutrino reactions ( columns 36 ) .",
    "the inclusion of neutral - current neutrino spallation on @xmath39-particles and @xmath19 and @xmath20 captures on heavy nuclei did not have a major effect on the nucleosynthesis , at least before the freeze - out of the charged - particle reactions .",
    "for the relatively low entropies studied here , the neutrino spallation on @xmath39-particles did not have any appreciable influence on the final @xmath39-particle mass fraction .",
    "this is to be contrasted with the dramatic effect of these spallation reactions on the @xmath0-process in wilson s high - entropy supernova model ( @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath19 captures on heavy nuclei may have important consequences for the ensuing neutron - capture phase of the @xmath0-process ( @xcite ) .",
    "regardless of these issues , it is clear that none of these wind models produced an @xmath0-process .",
    "the neutrons had been consumed by the time the charged - particle reactions froze out ( @xmath44 ) , and the nuclear flow did not even reach the @xmath51 @xmath0-process peak .",
    "another important issue concerns the overall ejection of the synthesized material in the wind into the interstellar medium . as the following simple argument will show",
    ", the magnitudes of the production factors may preclude the ejection of such material in all nine wind models . from the time evolution of neutrino luminosity in wilson s supernova model",
    ", we find that , for example , the neutrino luminosity decreases from twice to half the value in model 30b over a time of @xmath52 s. with a mass loss rate of @xmath53 and the largest production factor of @xmath54 in model 30b ( figure 8) , the corresponding normalized production factor is @xmath55 , if the total amount of ejecta from the supernova is @xmath56 .",
    "models 30a and c give normalized production factors of up to @xmath57 . for models 10a ",
    "f , the normalized production factors for the nuclei produced in the largest amount are typically of order 100 .",
    "however , woosley & weaver ( 1993 ) find that the normalized production factor should not be much above 10 in order for supernovae to produce the observed solar abundance of oxygen",
    ". therefore , these wind models can not represent in detail what commonly occurs in supernovae .",
    "it is quite possible that appropriate modifications of these standard wind models can lead to the physical conditions for acceptable nucleosynthesis .",
    "paper i studied the effects of an additional energy source on the entropy and dynamic time scale in the wind .",
    "model 10f of paper i was recalculated with an additional energy input of @xmath58 distributed uniformly in volume between 15 and 25 km . at these radii",
    ", the mass loss rate has been more or less determined .",
    "the additional energy input represents a moderate perturbation to the total amount of heating provided by neutrinos ( @xmath59 ) . as a result ,",
    "the entropy increased from 140 to 192 per baryon , and the dynamic time scale decreased from 0.11 to 0.022 s , while the mass loss rate slightly increased from @xmath60 to @xmath61 @xmath62 s@xmath63 .    the effect on the nucleosynthesis was dramatic as shown in table 4 . the neutron - to - seed ratio ( cf",
    "[ 3 ] ) , less than 10 in all of the unmodified models , rose to @xmath64 . with an average mass number of @xmath65 for the seed nuclei , uranium could be produced if all the neutrons were to be subsequently captured .",
    "the @xmath66 @xmath0-process peak probably could have been produced with less additional energy input , and hence a lower entropy and a longer dynamic time scale , than assumed in paper i. we conclude that lower values of @xmath2 than those calculated by wilson in woosley et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , or additional energy input like that considered in paper i , are necessary to produce an @xmath0-process in a spherically symmetric wind model .",
    "from our studies of nucleosynthesis in the neutrino - driven wind in the previous section , we learn that the standard wind models of paper i fail to make an @xmath0-process . on the other hand",
    ", we also see that reasonable modifications of these models can significantly change the physical conditions in the wind , and therefore give rise to a possible @xmath0-process . in order to better understand the deficiencies of the standard wind models , and furthermore , to motivate and direct physically plausible modifications of these models",
    ", we now survey the important physical parameters required for a strong @xmath0-process .",
    "( see also @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; and @xcite ) .",
    "we consider the following generic model for the @xmath0-process .",
    "neutron - rich material initially composed of free nucleons at high temperatures ( @xmath67 ) adiabatically expands and cools .",
    "after nearly all the protons are assembled into @xmath39-particles at @xmath68 , an @xmath39-process occurs to burn the @xmath39-particles into heavy nuclei .",
    "the @xmath39-process stops when charged - particle reactions freeze out at @xmath69 .",
    "the heavy nuclei produced at the end of the @xmath39-process then become the seed nuclei for the subsequent rapid neutron capture process , or the @xmath0-process .",
    "we do not intend to account for the full detail of the @xmath0-process , such as the final abundance distribution , which becomes meaningful only in the context of a consistent astrophysical model .",
    "what we are most interested in is the physical conditions favorable for the production of the most abundant @xmath0-process nuclei , such as those in the platinum peak of the solar @xmath0-process abundance distribution . for this purpose",
    ", we can think of the @xmath0-process as the transformation of seed nuclei into @xmath0-process nuclei through simple addition of the available neutrons . in this sense ,",
    "the possibility of producing @xmath0-process nuclei around a certain mass number depends only on the relative abundances of seed nuclei and neutrons at the end of the @xmath39-process .    in general ,",
    "the composition resulting from the @xmath39-process satisfies @xmath70 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the final mass fractions of neutrons and @xmath39-particles , respectively , and @xmath71 is the total mass fraction of seed nuclei . if we represent the seed nuclei with a mean proton number @xmath72 and a mean mass number @xmath41 , we can define a neutron - to - seed ratio at the end of the @xmath39-process as @xmath73 in terms of this ratio , our simplified condition for making @xmath0-process nuclei with mass number @xmath74 becomes @xmath75 we are particularly interested in the production of the platinum peak , and will describe the numerical calculations for @xmath76 in the following .    to follow the nucleosynthesis in the adiabatically cooling material with a nuclear reaction network , we need the initial composition and the time evolution of temperature and density",
    ". the initial composition at @xmath67 can be simply specified by the initial electron fraction @xmath30 , with the initial mass fractions of neutrons and protons given by @xmath77 and @xmath78 , respectively . because temperature and density are related through the constant entropy for the adiabatically cooling material , we only need to specify the temperature as a function of time . for simplicity",
    ", we introduce a dynamic time scale ( @xmath18 ) over which the temperature changes by one @xmath38-fold , i.e. , @xmath79 with this time evolution of the temperature , the duration of the adiabatic expansion from @xmath80 to 2.5 is @xmath81 hereafter , we will refer to @xmath82 as the expansion time .",
    "we further assume that the entropy is dominated by contributions from radiation and relativistic electron - positron pairs , and is given by @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the density in units of @xmath85 , and @xmath1 is in units of boltzmann constant per baryon .",
    "for convenience , we frequently refer to entropy without its unit throughout this paper .",
    "now it is straightforward to determine the combinations of initial electron fraction , entropy , and expansion time , for which an @xmath39-process can lead to a sufficient neutron - to - seed ratio for production of @xmath0-process nuclei with @xmath76 .",
    "we choose a range of expansion times ( @xmath86 s ) . for each @xmath82",
    ", we survey a broad range of initial electron fractions ( @xmath87 , 0.25 , 0.30 , 0.35 , 0.40 , 0.45 , 0.46 , 0.47 , 0.48 , 0.49 , and 0.495 ) . with a particular set of @xmath82 and @xmath30",
    ", we seek through iteration the appropriate entropy which enables the @xmath39-process to produce a final composition satisfying equation ( [ nesrp ] ) for @xmath76 . in our calculations",
    ", we take into account the effects of electron and positron captures and nuclear @xmath37-decays on the evolution of the electron fraction .",
    "the results are given in table 5 and figure 10 .",
    "for each successful run , the composition at the end of the @xmath39-process are given in terms of the final neutron and @xmath39-particle mass fractions and the mean proton and mass numbers for seed nuclei .",
    "the mean proton and mass numbers were calculated from @xmath88 and @xmath89 , respectively , with @xmath90 the number fraction of the seed nucleus with proton number @xmath91 and mass number @xmath92 .",
    "the final electron fraction and the neutron - to - seed ratio are also given in table 5 .",
    "the combinations of initial electron fraction and entropy in the successful runs for three specific expansion times are shown as filled circles connected by solid lines in figure 10 . at a given @xmath82",
    ", values of @xmath30 and @xmath1 to the left of the solid line will not give a sufficient neutron - to - seed ratio for production of the platinum peak .",
    "in addition , the following features of this figure are worth mentioning :    \\(1 ) depending on the expansion time , there exist many possible combinations of initial electron fraction and entropy that can produce nuclei with @xmath66 .",
    "the `` high entropy '' scenario ( @xmath93 and @xmath94 ) corresponds to longer expansion times ( @xmath95 s ) .",
    "the results for @xmath96 s are consistent with the conditions seen at late times in wilson s supernova model ( @xcite ) , and those employed in the successful @xmath0-process calculations of woosley et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and takahashi , witti , & janka ( 1994 ) , although the later required an artificial increase in the entropy ( by a factor of five ) to produce nuclei with @xmath66 .",
    "\\(2 ) alternatively , there is a `` low entropy '' scenario ( @xmath97 and @xmath98 ) that requires shorter expansion times ( @xmath99 s ) . for the most extreme case shown ( @xmath100 s )",
    ", the platinum peak can be made for any @xmath101 if @xmath102 .",
    "such an expansion would correspond to very high velocities which might be more appropriate to a jet than to a quasi - steady - state wind as considered in paper i. however , these rapid expansions may not continue after the @xmath39-process in order to allow enough time for the neutron capture phase of the @xmath0-process .",
    "the slowing down of the expansion could be facilitated by a massive overlying mantle in the case of a type ii supernova .",
    "\\(3 ) for smaller values of @xmath30 , the required entropy decreases regardless of the expansion time .",
    "this merely reflects the very neutron - rich nature of the initial composition .",
    "the results of paper i suggest that values of @xmath2 below 0.3 might be very difficult to achieve in the neutrino - driven wind .",
    "material with @xmath103 would need to be ejected without any significant interaction with neutrinos .",
    "\\(4 ) for a fixed expansion time , the required value of entropy actually _ decreases _ as @xmath30 increases from @xmath104 to @xmath105 .",
    "lower entropy translates to higher density ( cf .",
    "eq . [ 7 ] ) , and",
    "would normally produce more seed nuclei .",
    "however , in these cases of high @xmath30 , the electron fraction has even more leverage on the seed production . as @xmath30 increases towards 0.5 , the neutron abundance decreases to vanishingly small values when the @xmath39-process begins at @xmath106 .",
    "this in turn diminishes the efficiency of burning @xmath39-particles through the main reaction path bridging the unstable mass gaps at @xmath107 and 8 , i.e. , @xmath108 .",
    "table 5 shows that these high @xmath30 values give extreme @xmath39-rich freeze - outs with final @xmath39-particle mass fractions approaching unity and comparable mass fractions for neutrons and heavy seed nuclei .    in deriving the above results , we have made two major assumptions : ( 1 ) the entropy is proportional to @xmath109 with the proportionality constant calculated for a mixture of radiation and relativistic electron - positron pairs , and ( 2 ) weak interactions other than electron and positron captures and nuclear @xmath37-decays can be neglected in the nuclear reaction network .",
    "we will discuss how our results are affected if we drop either assumption in turn .",
    "due to its logarithmic dependence on the temperature and density , the entropy of non - relativistic particles roughly stays constant over the temperature range in our calculations ( @xmath110 ) . for a total entropy of @xmath111 ,",
    "the change in density essentially maintains a constant entropy of relativistic particles as the material adiabatically cools . at high temperatures ( @xmath112 ) ,",
    "the relativistic particles include photons and electron - positron pairs , and the corresponding entropy is given by equation ( 7 ) .",
    "however , as the temperature cools below @xmath113 , electron - positron pairs begin to annihilate .",
    "the situation is much like the big bang",
    ". eventually , at @xmath114 , the only relativistic particles in the material are photons , with the corresponding entropy given by @xmath115 . in general",
    ", we can write the entropy in relativistic particles as @xmath116 . because @xmath117 decreases noticeably from @xmath106 to 2.5",
    "when the @xmath39-process is taking place in our calculations , we have overestimated the density by using @xmath118 throughout the adiabatic expansion of the material .",
    "consequently , we have overestimated the seed production and underestimated the neutron - to - seed ratio at the end of the @xmath39-process .",
    "this is especially true for the cases of high entropies where more time is available to produce seed nuclei .    with an accurate expression for the entropy , the condition in equation ( [ nesrp ] ) is satisfied at slightly lower entropies than those given in table 5 for the same initial electron fraction and expansion time .",
    "in fact , we have repeated our calculations for @xmath119 , 0.40 , 0.45 , 0.47 , and 0.49 , using an exact adiabatic equation of state to compute the density corresponding to a specific temperature .",
    "this equation of state takes into account the contributions to the entropy from radiation , electron - positron pairs , and ions .",
    "the results are shown as filled squares in figure 10 for three of the expansion times explored in the initial numerical survey .",
    "as expected , our previous results using equation ( 7 ) overestimated the entropy required to produce the platinum peak .",
    "when we use the exact adiabatic equation of state , the required entropy is lower by @xmath120% for the longest expansion time @xmath96 s , whereas for the shortest expansion time @xmath100 s , the results are essentially unchanged .",
    "if the @xmath0-process occurs in an environment with intense neutrino flux , perhaps we should also include various neutrino interactions in the nuclear reaction network .",
    "in fact , we could have specified a less `` generic '' model by considering an @xmath0-process site similar to the neutrino - driven wind . in this case , the adiabatically expanding material is also moving away from the neutrino source .",
    "we can define a constant dynamic time scale as @xmath121 , with @xmath0 the distance from the neutrino source and @xmath21 the expansion velocity .",
    "the time evolution of temperature in equation ( 5 ) follows on assuming @xmath122 .",
    "we can then introduce an additional parameter , e.g. , the initial neutrino flux @xmath123 at @xmath80 , in our calculations .",
    "as the material adiabatically expands , the neutrino flux it receives decreases as @xmath124 . in principle , using the above prescription , we can repeat our calculations for a range of @xmath123 with various neutrino interactions included in the nuclear reaction network .    from our discussions in @xmath125 , we have seen that for relatively low entropies of @xmath97 , the major role of the neutrino flux in determining the neutron - to - seed ratio is to increase the electron fraction by @xmath19 and @xmath20 captures on free nucleons through the @xmath39-effect .",
    "in addition , meyer ( 1995 ) has shown that for high entropies of @xmath126 , neutral - current neutrino spallations on @xmath39-particles during the @xmath39-process can increase the production of seed nuclei . in both cases ,",
    "inclusion of neutrino interactions tends to reduce the neutron - to - seed ratio at the end of the @xmath39-process , although the effects of these neutrino interactions are less important for shorter expansion times",
    ". therefore , we can interpret the entropies in table 5 and figure 10 as the _ minimum _ values required to produce the platinum peak for given sets of initial electron fraction and expansion time . with this interpretation",

    "comparing equations ( 8a ) and ( 8b ) with equations ( 10a ) and ( 10b ) , we see that the fractional change in the neutron mass fraction during the @xmath39-process is less than that in the @xmath39-particle mass fraction for @xmath131 . obviously ,",
    "because neutrons carry no charge and the mean charge per nucleon for @xmath39-particles exceeds @xmath132 for the heavy seed nuclei , the final composition favors the presence of neutrons for @xmath133 .",

    ", we can clearly see the individual roles of the initial electron fraction , entropy , and dynamic time scale in determining the neutron - to - seed ratio .",
    "in addition to specifying the overall availability of neutrons ( cf .",
    "[ 8b ] ) , the initial electron fraction serves to direct the path of nuclear flow during the @xmath39-process .",
    "as our analytic treatment indicates , the comparison of @xmath30 with the ratio @xmath132 for the typical seed distribution reflects whether @xmath39-particles or neutrons are mainly consumed during the @xmath39-process .",
    "the influence of entropy is manifested through the density dependences of the equilibrium abundance of @xmath140be ( cf .",
    "eq . [ 12 ] ) and the rate for burning @xmath39-particles ( cf .",
    "[ 11a ] ) .",
    "physically , a high entropy means many photons per baryon in radiation - dominated conditions . a significant fraction of these photons can be on the high - energy tail of the bose - einstein distribution , and therefore can maintain a low @xmath140be abundance through the photo - disintegration reactions .",
    "in turn , this limits the overall efficiency of burning @xmath39-particles , and hence the production of seed nuclei .",
    "the dynamic time scale , or the expansion time , specifies the duration of the @xmath39-process ( cf .",
    "eq . [ 6 ] ) .",
    "obviously , the expansion time also acts to limit the production of seed nuclei . in general , a lower initial electron fraction , a higher entropy , and a shorter expansion time all give a larger neutron - to - seed ratio .",
    "it is most interesting to notice that for a given @xmath30 , the composition resulting from the @xmath39-process essentially only depends on the combination @xmath181 ( cf .",
    "[ 20a ] and [ 20b ] ) .",
    "consequently , the same neutron - to - seed ratio can be achieved for the same initial electron fraction with an expansion time 8 times shorter if the entropy is reduced by a factor of 2 .",
    "for reasonable assumptions regarding neutrino luminosity , neutron star mass and radius , and the time history for @xmath2 , the nucleosynthesis resulting from the analytic model developed in paper i for the neutrino - driven wind does not resemble the solar @xmath0-process , although a number of interesting species in the mass range @xmath182 are produced .",
    "this failure may be a consequence of important ( but unknown ) physics neglected in paper i , or our results may reflect the true nucleosynthesis from typical core - collapse - driven supernovae ( however , see the discussion concerning the ejection of the wind material in @xmath172 ) . extra ( but , so far , artificial ) energy input to the wind beyond the injection radius ( where @xmath17 is determined ) does give a successful @xmath0-process .",
    "possible sources of this energy were discussed in paper i.    a numerical survey has delineated the necessary combinations of key parameters  @xmath2 , entropy , and expansion time  needed to produce the third @xmath0-process peak ( i.e. , the platinum peak ) .",
    "high entropy is not a unique requirement .",
    "a shorter expansion time also serves to limit the number of heavy seed nuclei produced and thus increase the neutron - to - seed ratio .",
    "a lower @xmath2 also leads to a larger neutron - to - seed ratio .",
    "the sensitivity of the neutron - to - seed ratio to @xmath2 diminishes as one proceeds to shorter expansion times , as does the sensitivity to the entropy .",

    "approximate analytic formulae ( eqs .",

    "given that the standard wind models , without artificial modification , produce a set of abundances distinct from the @xmath0-process , one must be concerned about the observational consequences .",
    "one possibility already mentioned is that important physics has still been omitted from the simple wind model  e.g. , neutrino flavor mixing , added energy input from shocks , rotation , or magnetic fields , convection , etc .  and that the conditions required for the @xmath0-process may still ultimately be achieved in common core - collapse - driven supernovae .",
    "perhaps material having a much lower @xmath2 than calculated by wilson in woosley et al .",
    "( 1994 ) is ejected ( @xcite ) . another possibility which must be seriously considered however , is that the @xmath0-process has more than one important site and neutron exposure .",

    "similar results hold for the more metal poor star cs 22892 - 052 , although pt was not observed and the detection of os is less certain .",
    "coupled with previous data , the fit to the solar @xmath0-process pattern for all elements between ba and os is striking , suggesting that , for this range of nuclei , the solar @xmath0-process abundance distribution appears to be made in its entirety in the progenitor(s ) of these metal poor stars .",
    "this result argues for a primary production scenario . due to",
    "the star s very low metallicity , especially so for cs 22892 - 052 , the observed @xmath0-process abundance pattern probably arose from only a few supernovae .",
    "interestingly , the abundance pattern for cs 22892 - 052 shows that elements in the first neutron capture peak ( sr , y , and zr ) are below their scaled solar @xmath0-process fractions relative to pt , os , and th , yet well above the the iron group .",
    "thus locally the @xmath0-process abundances seem solar , but globally they are not .",
    "sneden et al .",
    "( 1996 ) suggest that the bulk of the solar abundance of sr , y , and zr is due to the @xmath10-process , but these nuclei are also easily produced in the neutrino - driven wind ( figure 1 here ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this is consistent with the existence of two sources for the @xmath0-process , one responsible for production of the @xmath0-isotopes for @xmath12 , including those in the @xmath48 peak , and the other for the heavier elements , possibly operating in another site or a higher entropy version of the same site .",
    "a very different type of @xmath0-process would arise also for much shorter expansion times , as might occur in accretion induced collapse where the wind is not slowed down by a massive overlying mantle ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",

    "with short expansion times , the duration of the neutron capture phase of the @xmath0-process may require special consideration .",
    "if the material undergoing nucleosynthesis can not be slowed down during the neutron capture phase , the @xmath0-process may have to be accelerated by @xmath19 captures on heavy nuclei ( nadyozhin & panov 1993 ) .",
