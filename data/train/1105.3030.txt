    "the _ fermi _ large area telescope ( lat ) provides a wealth of new data on isolated , rotation - powered pulsars , increasing the number of detected @xmath0-ray pulsars from seven to more than sixty ( e.g. , abdo et al .",
    "the _ agile _ has also reported the detection of about twenty @xmath0-ray pulsars ( e.g. , pellizzoni et al .",
    "since interpreting @xmath0-rays should be less ambiguous compared with reprocessed , non - thermal x - rays , the @xmath0-ray pulsations observed from these objects are particularly important as a direct signature of basic non - thermal processes in pulsar magnetospheres , and potentially should help to discriminate among different emission models . in a pulsar magnetosphere ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sidev ] ) , there is a surface called the null surface , on which the goldreich - julian charge density ( goldreich & julian  1969 ) @xmath1 changes sign , where @xmath2 denotes the local magnetic field , @xmath3 the ns angular - velocity vector , and @xmath4 the speed of light .",
    "there is another characteristic surface called the light cylinder beyond which the co - rotational velocity exceeds @xmath4 .",
    "the distance of the light cylinder from the rotation axis is called the light - cylinder radius , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 denotes the ns rotational angular frequency . on each magnetic azimuthal angle ( measured around the magnetic axis )",
    ", there is a magnetic field line that crosses the light cylinder tangentially ; they are called the the last - open field lines.    in the lower colatitudes than the last - open field lines , field lines closes inside the light cylinder ; thus , a high plasma density is expected by the trapping of relativistic charges due to magnetic mirrors , preventing the occurrence of a strong magnetic - field - aligned electric field , @xmath7 , in this closed zone . in the higher colatitudes , on the other hand , field lines open to a distant region beyond the light cylinder , allowing a pulsar wind to flow along them , thereby resulting in a high vacuum with unscreened @xmath7 in some regions in this open - field - line zone .    on these grounds , in all the pulsar emission models , particle acceleration is assumed to realize in the open zone . in polar - cap ( pc ) models , emission takes place within a few neutron star ( ns ) radii above a pc surface ( arons & scharlemann 1979 ; daugherty & harding 1982 , 1996 ) .",
    "however , the observed cutoff energies , typically between 1  gev and 4  gev ( abdo et al .",
    "2010a ) , along with the 25  gev detection of pulsed signals from the crab pulsar ( aliu at al .  2008 ) , suggests no attenuation from one - photon absorption by a strong magnetic field ( baring 2004 ) near the ns , indicating the minimum altitudes of a few stellar radii above the pc surface .",
    "thus , the possibility of a high - altitude emission gathered attention .",
    "recent pulsar high - energy emission models adopt , therefore , higher - altitude geometries .",
    "there are two main scenarios in this approach : the outer - gap ( og ) model ( cheng et al .",
    "1986a , b ; romani  1996 ; cheng et al .  2000 ; hirotani  2008 ; takata et al .  2008 ; romani & watters  2010 ) , and the pair - starved polar - cap model ( frackowiak & rudak  2005 ; harding et al .  2005 ; venter et al .  2009 ) .    in the present paper , we focus on the og model , in which pairs are created in the outer magnetosphere mainly by photon - photon ( @xmath0-@xmath0 ) pair production .",
    "the produced pairs polarize owing to the magnetic - field - aligned electric field , @xmath7 .",
    "if the rotation and magnetic axes reside in the same hemisphere , a positive @xmath7 is exerted to accelerate @xmath8 s ( or @xmath9 s ) outward ( or inwards ) , increasing the real charge density outwards .",
    "the inward - migrating , relativistic @xmath9 s radiate curvature @xmath0-rays , some of which ( nearly head - on ) collide with the x - rays emitted from the ns surface to materialize as pairs .",
    "the purpose here is to examine the detectability of the @xmath0-ray photons from pulsars with og accelerators . on the neutron - star period ( @xmath10 ) versus period - derivative ( @xmath11 ) plane , we find two kinds of death lines below which the pulsar ogs become inactive . in   [ sec : pair ] , we derive the first kind death line , which turns out to be a modification of the previous death lines ( zhang et al .",
    "we then derive the second kind , new death line in   [ sec : threshold ] , by separately considering the threshold of @xmath0-@xmath0 pair production .",
    "we finally combine these two death lines and discuss the detectability of pulsars with recent @xmath0-ray telescopes .",
    "according to the analytical consideration in classic og model ( cheng et al .",
    "1986a , b ; romani  1996 ; cheng et al .  2000 ) , and to the numerical solution of the og ( hirotani  2006a , b ) , an og is found to exist essentially between the null surface and the light cylinder ( fig .  [",
    "fig : sidev ] ) .",
    "since most of the pairs are produced in the inner - most region of the og , the ( outward - moving ) @xmath8 s propagate longer distance than the ( inward - moving ) @xmath9 s . as a result , the outward @xmath0-ray flux becomes greater than the inward one .",
    "this result is particularly important when we predict the high - energy emission properties from an og .",
    "nevertheless , to investigate the condition for an og to be self - sustained , it is crucial to consider the collisions between the _ inward _ @xmath0-rays , which are emitted by @xmath9 s , and the outward - propagating x - rays , which are emitted from the heated pc surface .",
    "thus , in this paper , we concentrate on the condition for the inward - propagating @xmath0-rays to materialize as pairs in the inner magnetosphere .    for young pulsars like crab or vela ,",
    "@xmath0-@xmath0 pair production is sustained by the strong thermal emission from the cooling ns surface , and the gap trans - field thickness is kept thin . however , as the ns ages , the heated pc emission due to the bombardment of in - falling @xmath9 s dominates the cooling ns emission and controls the gap trans - field thickness .",
    "therefore , when we investigate the death lines below which an og accelerator ceases to emit @xmath0-rays , it is appropriate to consider the heated pc as the source of x - rays for @xmath0-@xmath0 pair production . for simplicity ,",
    "we assume that the heated pc has a uniform temperature @xmath12 with area @xmath13 . when the og activity is marginally sustained , pair production takes place mainly near the null surface .      at an altitude @xmath14 ,",
    "the photon energy flux is given by @xmath15 where the flux measured at the surface becomes @xmath16 @xmath17 denotes the ns radius , @xmath18 the colatitude of the point from the _ magnetic _ axis . in this paper",
    ", we consider that the magnetic axis is moderately or highly inclined with respect to the rotation axis . in this case , the pc surface is almost face - on from the gap inner boundary , which is located well inside the light cylinder .",
    "thus , we adopt @xmath19 in what follows .    evaluating the photon number flux at typical blackbody photon energy , @xmath20",
    ", we obtain the mean - free path for an inward - propagating @xmath0-ray to materialize in a collision with the surface x - ray as @xmath21 where the @xmath0-@xmath0 pair - production total cross section is evaluated by @xmath22 , because the collisions take place mostly head - on .",
    "inward - propagating @xmath0-rays are typically emitted from the central colatitude in the gap .",
    "therefore , before crossing the critical field lines on which the null surface intersects the light cylinder ( i.e. , before escaping from the gap ) , they propagate the distance @xmath23 where @xmath24 denotes the distance of the null surface on the last - open field line from the ns center , @xmath25 the angle between rotation and magnetic axes . if @xmath26 , @xmath27 gives @xmath28 , whereas if @xmath29 , @xmath30 gives @xmath31 , for example . note that the gap is supposed to exist only below the critical field lines , because such solutions are being obtained by three - dimensional og simulations . because of this geometry , the obtained death lines give tighter constraints than previous ones , which are obtained by assuming that the og occupies the entire open - field - line regions between the null surface and the light cylinder ( i.e. , by imposing @xmath32 as in zhang et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "combining equations  ( [ eq : mfp ] ) and ( [ eq : length ] ) , we can compute the optical depth @xmath33 for @xmath0-@xmath0 pair production , @xmath34 where @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 is the ns spin period ; @xmath38 is used .      for the pulsars near the death line ( to be derived below ) , the potential drop in the og becomes a good fraction of the electromotive force , @xmath39 , exerted on the pc surface .",
    "thus , we can reasonably evaluate the maximally possible @xmath7 by @xmath40 where @xmath41 denotes the ns dipole moment , and @xmath42 the magnetic field strength at the ns surface . since the potential drop occurs only in a portion of the open zone ,",
    "we multiply the factor @xmath43 in the numerator . by this acceleration electric field , the inward motion of @xmath9 s attain a force balance between the electrostatic and curvature - radiation forces . thus ,",
    "the typical lorentz factors of the @xmath9 s become @xmath44 where @xmath45 refers to the magnitude of the charge on the electron , @xmath46 the curvature radius of the magnetic field line .      to evaluate @xmath46 , we we consider the following two representative cases .",
    "+ * case 1 : * the null surface intersects the last - open field line in the _ inner - most _ magnetosphere ; that is , @xmath47 , in this case , the curvature radius can be approximated as @xmath48 on the last - open field line . if @xmath49 , this case becomes applicable along the magnetic field lines that crosses the ns surface with magnetic azimuthal angle in the range @xmath50 , where @xmath51 increases counter - clockwise and @xmath52 points the rotation axis from the magnetic axis . to derive the og death line ,",
    "it is sufficient to consider only this range , @xmath53 , because the og is active only in @xmath53 . +",
    "* case 2 : * the null surface intersects the last - open field line in the _",
    "magnetosphere ; that is , @xmath54 . in this case",
    ", we have @xmath55 if @xmath56 , this case becomes applicable in @xmath53 .",
    "substituting equation  ( [ eq : epara ] ) into ( [ eq : lf ] ) , we obtain @xmath57 for case  1 , and @xmath58 for case  2 , where @xmath59 .",
    "the flux density of the curvature spectrum peaks at the frequency @xmath60 , where the critical frequency is defined by @xmath61 however , for the pulsars near the death line , @xmath0-@xmath0 pair production is maintained by the collisions between the @xmath0-ray photons with energy @xmath62 and the thermal photons near the blackbody peak @xmath63 , or between the @xmath0-rays with @xmath64 and the thermal photons in the wien regime @xmath65 , or both ( i.e. , @xmath66 and @xmath67 ) . to take account of such effects",
    ", we can practically assume that pair production takes place between the @xmath0-rays with @xmath68 and the surface x - rays with @xmath69 ; this treatment incurs relatively small errors from the exact , complicated numerical computations .    substituting equations  ( [ eq : lf1 ] ) or ( [ eq : lf2 ] ) into ( [ eq : nu_c ] ) , we obtain the typical @xmath0-rays energy , @xmath70 @xmath71 for cases  1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "let us now evaluate number of photons emitted by a single inward - accelerated @xmath9 near the null surface , the inner - most region of the gap .",
    "if @xmath46 were constant in the magnetosphere , the photons emitted between the altitudes @xmath24 and ( @xmath72 ) illuminate the null surface , where @xmath73 is given by equation  ( [ eq : length ] ) .",
    "therefore , we could evaluate the number of @xmath0-rays emitted by a single @xmath9 by @xmath74 it follows that a single @xmath9 cascade into @xmath75 secondary pairs within the gap . substituting equations  ( [ eq : hnu_c1 ] ) or ( [ eq : hnu_c2 ] ) into ( [ eq : ngamma0 ] )",
    ", we obtain @xmath76 @xmath77 for cases 1 and 2 , respectively .      combining equations  ( [ eq : tau0 ] ) and ( [ eq : ngamma1 ] )",
    ", we obtain the number of pairs that a single @xmath9 cascades within the gap , @xmath78 for case 1 . in the same manner , combining equations  ( [ eq : tau0 ] ) and ( [ eq : ngamma2 ] ) , we obtain @xmath79 for case 2 . we have to express @xmath80 so that the emitted energy in the form of the blackbody radiation from the heated pc surface may be consistent with the energy deposited by the bombardment of gap - accelerated @xmath9 s .",
    "the number flux of @xmath9 s falling onto the polar cap surface ( with area @xmath81 ) can be evaluated by @xmath82 where @xmath83 denotes the entire pc area .",
    "since typically @xmath84  % of the open flux tubes thread the gap , @xmath85 is a good compromise .",
    "see figure  [ fig : pc ] for an example of active field lines on the pc surface , which indicates that about @xmath86 of the open field line fluxes are active .    from numerical analysis",
    ", @xmath87 is appropriate for @xmath88 , while @xmath89 for @xmath90 . in newtonian approximation , @xmath91 typically becomes @xmath92 , because we obtain @xmath93 at the pc surface , where @xmath94 refers to the magnetic field component projected along the rotation axis .",
    "thus , @xmath91 decreases with increasing @xmath25 .",
    "however , as the ns rapidly rotates , the space - time dragging effect ( muslimov & tsygan 1992 ) leads to a smaller @xmath91 than @xmath92 . on the other hand , in a three - dimensional pulsar magnetosphere , inward @xmath0-rays preferentially propagates towards the leading side due to the aberration of the photon propagation direction ; thus , created current becomes super goldreich - julian in the leading side to exert a space - charge - limited flow of ions from the pc surface in an og ( h06a ) .",
    "thus , @xmath91 can exceed the value @xmath95 at the pc surface .",
    "for a highly inclined case , the fraction of the field lines having super - goldreich - julian current density increases because of the decreased @xmath96 at the pc surface .",
    "thus , @xmath87 is more appropriate than @xmath97 for @xmath26 .",
    "however , for @xmath29 , most field lines have sub - goldreich - julian current ; thus , we obtain @xmath98 . as an intermediate case , we present the solution of @xmath91 in a three - dimensional og with @xmath99 in the left panel of figure  [ fig : pc ] , which shows that the evaluation of @xmath100 is appropriate on average .",
    "each @xmath9 brings the energy @xmath101 on the ns surface , where @xmath102 denotes the lorentz factor at the altitude @xmath103 below which all the emitted photons hit the ns . for case  1 ,",
    "most of the @xmath9 s kinetic energy at the gap inner boundary will be eventually turned into the ns surface emission , because @xmath104 shows that @xmath105 if @xmath106  s. for case  2 , on the contrary , only a portion of @xmath107 at the null surface will be used in the heating of the ns surface , because @xmath108 .    for case  1 , we can put @xmath109 , where the right - hand side is evaluated by equation  ( [ eq : lf1 ] ) . thus , combining equations  ( [ eq : lf1 ] ) and ( [ eq : dot_ne ] ) , we obtain @xmath110    for case  2 , on the other hand , electrons lose energy by curvature radiation from @xmath111 down to @xmath112 before illuminating the ns . integrating the equation of lorentz factor evolution , @xmath113 from @xmath111 to @xmath112 , we obtain @xmath114^{-1/3 }    \\label{eq : lf_evol2}\\ ] ] where the weak dependence on @xmath115 , which is of the order of unity , may be neglected . combining equations  ( [ eq : lf_evol2 ] ) and ( [ eq : dot_ne ] )",
    ", we obtain @xmath116    equating the heating rate @xmath117 derived just above with the emission rate @xmath118 , where @xmath119 denotes the stefan - boltzmann constant , we can evaluate the effective area of the heated pc region , @xmath13 , and obtain @xmath120 for case 1 , and @xmath121 for case 2 .",
    "note that @xmath122 merely parametrizes the fraction of active field lines to the entire open field lines .",
    "for case  1 , substituting equation  ( [ eq : rfac1 ] ) into ( [ eq : pairs1 ] ) , we obtain @xmath123    for case  2 , substituting equation  ( [ eq : rfac2 ] ) into ( [ eq : pairs2 ] ) , we obtain @xmath124    in this paper , we evaluate the ns magnetic moment assuming the vacuum dipole radiation formula , @xmath125 . then , equations ( [ eq : pairs1b ] ) and ( [ eq : pairs2b ] ) give @xmath126 @xmath127 for cases  1 and 2 , respectively .    setting @xmath128",
    ", we obtain the death line on the @xmath10 versus @xmath11 plane , which describes the condition for an og to emit @xmath0-rays efficiently .",
    "thus , the minimum spin - down rate for a given @xmath10 is obtained as @xmath129 @xmath130 for cases  1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "since we consider that the gap will not extend in the entire open field line region , the obtained death lines  ( [ eq : death line_1a ] ) and ( [ eq : death line_2a ] ) gives a tighter constraint than previous works .",
    "for example , zhang et al .  (",
    "2004 ) gives @xmath131 for a uniform distribution of @xmath25 s , and @xmath132 for a cosine distribution of @xmath25 .",
    "death lines  ( [ eq : death line_3a ] ) and ( [ eq : death line_3b ] ) are depicted by the thick and thin dash - dotted lines in figure  [ fig : deathline ] .",
    "we now turn to the second and important constraint obtained by pair - production threshold . to derive this",
    ", we must evaluate the maximally possible energies of both the surface x - rays and the curvature @xmath0-rays .",
    "first , let us examine the maximum surface temperature , @xmath133 , which is probably realized in a limited area of the heated pc , near the footpoints of active magnetic field lines .",
    "that is , we release the assumption of uniform @xmath12 on the heated pc surface , which was adopted in   [ sec : pair ] .",
    "electrons will fall onto the ns surface with the typical lorentz factor given by equation  ( [ eq : lf_evol2 ] ) , where @xmath134 may be replaced with @xmath17 .",
    "however , the logarithmic factor little changes the right - hand side ; thus , we evaluate the lorentz factor of in - falling @xmath9 s by @xmath135 , where @xmath136 . equating @xmath137 with @xmath138",
    ", we obtain @xmath139 therefore , the typical x - ray energy can be estimated by @xmath140 for both case  1 and case  2 , apart from the difference of @xmath91 .",
    "second , we examine the maximum energy of curvature photons . for case  1 , we use equation  ( [ eq : hnu_c1 ] ) with @xmath141 to obtain @xmath142 for case  2 , we compute @xmath143 by equation  ( [ eq : hnu_c2 ] ) .",
    "third , we impose the pair - production threshold condition , @xmath144 to obtain @xmath145 @xmath146 for cases  1 and 2 , respectively .    on these grounds ,",
    "the actual death line is obtained by taking the greater @xmath11 in each case . for case  1 ,",
    "we obtain @xmath147 and for case  2 , we obtain @xmath148 it follows that the death line little depends on @xmath25 . in figure",

    "if they are non - thermal ( as in the case of old , nearby , non - recycled pulsars ) , it may be due to a magnetospheric emission from the extended polar gap ( see   [ sec : disc_old ] ) .",

    "this is because negative feedback effects work ( hirotani  2006 ) in an og and its electrodynamic structure little changes when we moderately change such parameters as @xmath25 , @xmath10 , and @xmath41 .",
    "however , the gap electrodynamic structure is mildly subject to change when we adopt different @xmath12 ( eqs .  [ [ eq : pairs1c ] ] & [ [ eq : pairs2c ] ] ) , because it directly affects the efficiency of @xmath0-@xmath0 pair production .    in their death line calculation , zhang et al .",

    "this argument is valid until the pulsar approaches the death line , and will be discussed in a separate paper .      in figure",
    "[ fig : deathline ] , we plot the x - ray detected pulsars by small ( green ) open circles .",

    "this corresponds to a modification of the original pair - starved polar - cap ( pspc ) model attempted to apply to the away curvature field lines ( muslimov & harding 2004a , b ; venter et al .",
    "this topic , a modified version of the pspc model , will be discussed in a separate paper .",
    "let us finally consider the relationship with x - ray observations . to this aim ,",
    "we present the og solution obtained for a typical millisecond pulsar parameter , @xmath171  ms , @xmath172 , by applying the numerical technique described in hirotani ( 2011 ) .",
    "since the solution close to the death line can not be easily obtained by numerical analysis , we consider this set of ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) , which is located relatively away from the death line ( fig .",
    "[ fig : deathline ] ) . to consider a moderate case , we assume @xmath99 .",
    "we present the solved @xmath91 , the created current density normalized by the typical goldreich - julian ( gj ) value , @xmath173 in the left panel of figure  [ fig : pc ] .",
    "it follows that the created current becomes super - gj , @xmath174 , in the leading side ( in the first quadrant ) , whereas sub - gj in the trailing side ( in the fourth quadrant ) .",
    "this is because the inward @xmath0-rays propagate towards the rotational direction due to the aberration of the photon propagation direction to preferentially materialize as pairs in the leading side .",
    "the created current concentrate near the last - open field line in the leading side , because the magnetic flux surface ( i.e. , a constant @xmath175 surface ) has a negative extrinsic curvature ( like the saddle or the inner surface of a daughnut ) in the lower altitudes where pair production mainly takes place . the inward @xmath0-rays preferentially propagate towards the lower magnetic colatitudes ( i.e. , towards the magnetic equator ) to materialize as pairs near the last - open field line .",
    "this forms a striking contrast with two - dimensional calculation , which predicts that the created current peaks in the middle or higher magnetic colatitudes ( i.e. , away from the last - open field lines ) in the gap ( fig .  1 of takata et al .",
    "2008 ) .    using @xmath91 and the lorentz factors of the in - falling @xmath9 s at the pc surface",
    ", we can compute the maximum attainable surface temperature using equation  ( [ eq : ktmax ] ) .",
    "the result is presented in the right panel of figure  [ fig : pc ] .",
    "the integrated pc x - ray luminosity becomes @xmath176 , whereas the magnetospheric @xmath0-ray luminosity becomes @xmath177 .",
    "we should notice here that this figure does not represent the actual temperature distribution on the pc surface of a millisecond pulsar by any means .",
    "for a weak surface magnetic field ( @xmath178  g ) of millisecond pulsars , the cyclotron energy is comparable or less than the coulomb energy .",
    "thus , we can expect more or less isotropic heat conduction on the surface of a millisecond pulsar .",
    "the high heat conduction of subphotospheric layers , where the in - falling plasmas energy is released , allows the heat to propagate across the ns surface , resulting in a greater hot region than given in figure  [ fig : pc ] ( right ) with decreasing temperature toward the rim of the heated region .",
    "since there is no reliable calculation of the heat conduction on a ns surface , we simply present the maximum attainable temperature in this paper .    from the x - ray observations of several nearby field millisecond pulsars ( see pavlov & zavlin 1997 , zavlin & pavlov 1998 , bogdanov et al .",
    "2007 for j0437 - 4715 ; becker et al .",
    "2000 , becker & achenbach 2002 , for j0030 + 0451 ; zavlin 2007 for j2124 - 3358 ; zavlin 2006 for j1024 - 0719 ) , it is suggested that the heated pc emission can be fitted by a superposition of two thermal components .",
    "one component has a higher temperature around a few hundred ev with emission area of @xmath179 , which is sometimes referred to as the core region of the heated pc .",
    "another component has a lower temperature around @xmath180 ev with emission area of @xmath181 , which is sometimes referred to as the rim region of the heated pc .",
    "we expect that the higher temperature region appearing in the leading side ( i.e. , in the first quadrant of figure  [ fig : pc ] ) near the last - open field line corresponds to the observed core region , whereas the lower temperature region appearing in the trailing side ( i.e. , in the fourth quadrant ) partially corresponds to the rim region .",
    "although a detailed calculation of the heat conduction across the ns surface may not be easy , it is suggestive that the leading side tends to have a higher temperature than the trailing side .",
    "if the photon statistics will be improved in the future , the phase - resolved spectrum of a broad peak in the x - ray light curve will show a decreasing temperature with pulsar phase .",

    "derivation of equation  ( [ eq : length ] ) is given below .",
    "for simplicity , we assume a newtonian dipole magnetic field configuration .",
    "we consider the plane ( @xmath182,@xmath183 ) in which both the rotation and magnetic axes reside .",
    "let us express the position of the cross section ( point p1 in fig .",
    "[ fig : sidev ] ) between the null surface and the last - open field line as ( @xmath184,@xmath185 ) in cartesian coordinates .",
    "then , the radial distance of point p1 from the ns center becomes @xmath186 where @xmath187 specifies the null surface , and @xmath188 the colatitudes ( measured from the rotation axis ) of the point at which the last - open field line becomes tangent to the light cylinder .",
    "thus , the distance of point p1 from the rotation axis becomes @xmath189 if a photon is emitted leftward from point p1 , it crosses the critical field line ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sidev ] ) before escaping from the gap at point p2 ( @xmath190,@xmath191 ) . for a newtonian dipole field , we obtain @xmath192 and hence @xmath193 . therefore , we obtain the distance between p1 and p2 , @xmath194 for photons emitted from the middle colatitude in the gap , we thus obtain the propagation distance below the critical field line , @xmath195 where @xmath196 the factor",
    "@xmath197 in the denominator of equation  ( [ eq : app_l2 ] ) is appropriate if the poloidal magnetic field lines are co - centric . for a dipole field geometry on the poloidal plane , equation  ( [ eq : app_l2 ] )",
    "overestimates @xmath73 . nevertheless",
    ", the inward @xmath0-rays propagate towards the leading side in a three - dimensional magnetosphere owing to aberration and propagate a longer distance than what is evaluated only on the poloidal plane .",
    "thus , equation  ( [ eq : app_l2 ] ) gives a good estimate .",
    "since @xmath198 , @xmath199 reduces equation  ( [ eq : app_l2 ] ) into equation  ( [ eq : length ] ) .",
