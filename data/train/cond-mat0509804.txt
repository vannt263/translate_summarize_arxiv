    "<S> the quantum instability of the mean - field theory for identical bosons is shown to be described by an appropriate bogoliubov transformation . </S>",
    "<S> a connection between the quantum and classical linear stability theories is indicated . </S>",
    "<S> it is argued that the instability rate in a system of identical bosons must be strongly affected by the nonlinear terms ( interactions ) . in the case of the repulsive interactions or strong attractive interactions the instability rate </S>",
    "<S> is suppressed . on the other hand , a weak attraction </S>",
    "<S> significantly enhances the instability rate . </S>",
    "<S> the results can have applications in the field of bose - einstein condensates of dilute quantum gases .    under some conditions , </S>",
    "<S> a quadratic hamiltonian describing a system of identical bosons can be diagonalized by the bogoliubov transformation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the physical sense of the diagonalization lies in a redefinition of the vacuum state and introduction of quasiparticles satisfying the boson commutation relations . </S>",
    "<S> the diagonalization is used , for instance , in description of the excitations in a bose - einstein condensate of dilute quantum gas @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> diagonalization is not always possible which means that the quasiparticle excitations may give rise to an instability @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> below it is shown that such instabilities are described by an appropriate bogoliubov transformation which , however , is not related to the diagonalization procedure . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , it is argued that even weak interactions ( i.e. the higher - order terms ) can cause a dramatic effect on the instability rate .    driving a quantum many - body system through an instability region by changing the system parameters is an important tool in the quantum state engineering in bec physics @xcite , for instance , in the process of the atomic association @xcite and molecular dissociation in bec @xcite . in a region of instability </S>",
    "<S> the mean - field theory breaks down @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the instability in system of identical bosons is also referred to as the curve crossing @xcite and is related to the landau - zener theory @xcite . in a condensate with the attractive interactions the quantum corrections are crucial for description of the dynamics when the mean field state is unstable @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> let us first briefly recall the basics of the diagonalization procedure @xcite . consider a hamiltonian quadratic in the boson creation ( @xmath0 ) and annihilation ( @xmath1 ) operators : @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( here @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 denote the hermitian conjugation , the transposition , and the complex conjugation , respectively ) . </S>",
    "<S> the diagonalization of the hamiltonian ( [ eq1 ] ) introduces new boson operators , say @xmath8 and @xmath9 , such that the corresponding matrix @xmath10 becomes diagonal and @xmath11 vanishes .    </S>",
    "<S> the fact that the new operators satisfy the boson commutation relations together with the linearity and homogeneity of the transformation gives immediately the most general form of the bogoliubov transformation : @xmath12 here , for simplicity , the index - free operators denote the whole column of such operators , e.g. @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> note that the conditions on matrices @xmath14 and @xmath15 in equation ( [ eq2 ] ) also guarantee the existence of the inverse transformation @xmath16    to diagonalize the hamiltonian ( [ eq1 ] ) the bogoliubov transformation must be such that columns of the transformation in equation ( [ eq3 ] ) are the eigenvectors of the following matrix eigenvalue problem @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 denote the @xmath20-th columns of the respective matrices . if the diagonalization is possible , the hamiltonian ( [ eq1 ] ) in the quasiparticle representation reads @xmath21 , where @xmath22 are the elements of the matrix @xmath15 @xcite . note that the number of quasiparticles @xmath23 is conserved .    </S>",
    "<S> the diagonalization procedure described above is closely related to the classical theory of stability of the stationary points of the hamiltonian systems @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the second matrix on the l.h.s . of equation ( [ eq4 ] ) , @xmath24 is the hessian of the classical hamiltonian system corresponding to the quantum hamiltonian ( [ eq1 ] ) when the boson operators @xmath25 and @xmath26 are replaced by the @xmath27-numbers . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the eigenvalues @xmath28 of the eigenvalue problem ( [ eq4 ] ) come in quartets @xmath29 . for the diagonalization to exist it is necessary that there are @xmath30 non - zero real eigenvalues and @xmath30 corresponding eigenvectors with the positive normalization , i.e. @xmath31 .    the simplest sufficient condition for the diagonalization is the positivity of the corresponding hessian . in the classical stability theory </S>",
    "<S> the quadratic form of the hessian is the first non - zero term in the energy expansion , thus its positivity implies linear stability @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the physical sense of the positivity of the hessian is that the linearized system about the stationary solution is equivalent to a system of uncoupled oscillators ( in the stationary case ) . in the quantum case </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding hamiltonian , quadratic in boson operators , can be diagonalized . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is clear that the diagonalization is not always possible ( for example , the hamiltoian ( [ eq6 ] ) below can not be diagonalized when @xmath32 ) . in this case there </S>",
    "<S> no interpretation in terms of the uncoupled oscillators since the linearized system is hyperbolic .    </S>",
    "<S> a mean - field theory for bosons can be considered stable if the quasiparticle excitations remain bounded ( for instance , when the hessian is positive ) . </S>",
    "<S> there is a correspondence between the classical and quantum stability . </S>",
    "<S> physically such a correspondence seems to be quite clear : due to the linearity of the heisenberg evolution equations ( for @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) the stability in the classical sense implies that the diagonalization of the corresponding hamiltonian , quadratic in boson operators , is possible . in the classical theory </S>",
    "<S> it is established that under a variation of the parameters the solution to a hamiltonian system may become unstable due to collision of the imaginary eigenvalues with the energy of opposite signs ( the opposite krein signatures ) or due to a collision of the eigenvalues at zero @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the simplest quantum instability is due to a collision of two frequencies at a resonance .    </S>",
    "<S> the simplest example of the quantum instability ( or non - diagonalizable boson hamiltonian ) has already appeared in the description of a boson system driven through a resonance @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding hamiltonian reads @xcite @xmath33a_1^{\\dagger}a_1 + [ -\\omega + \\delta(t)]a_2^{\\dagger}a_2 + \\gamma(a_1^{\\dagger}a_2^{\\dagger}+ a_1a_2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> \\label{eq6}\\ ] ] this hamiltonian conserves the difference of the number of bosons : @xmath34 = 0 $ ] . the total number of bosons is not conserved which is a reflection of the fact that the hamiltonian ( [ eq6 ] ) appears as a linearization of the full nonlinear hamiltonian about the mean - field state or in the case of a macroscopically populated source of bosons . for instance , such a hamiltonian appears in the description of the formation of atomic pairs by the dissociation of a molecular condensate @xcite . in the case of one highly populated molecular mode , while the atomic mode populations are not large , the model hamiltonian is @xmath35\\psi_{1}^{\\dagger}\\psi_{1 } + [ -\\omega + \\delta(t)]\\psi_{2}^{\\dagger}\\psi_{2 }   + ( g\\psi_m\\psi_{1}^{\\dagger}\\psi^\\dag_{1 } + g^*\\psi_m^\\dag\\psi_{1}\\psi_{2 } ) $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> if a macroscopic number of molecules does not change considerably , the annihilation operator for the molecular state can be approximated by an order parameter , @xmath36 . defining @xmath37 and @xmath38 with @xmath39 we obtain the hamiltonian ( [ eq6 ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> for the hamiltonian ( [ eq6 ] ) the corresponding hessian reads @xmath40 the characteristic equation is bi - quadratic : @xmath41 , it has the following four roots @xmath42 ( the two @xmath43 signs can be arbitrarily selected ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the hamiltonian ( [ eq6 ] ) can be diagonalized for @xmath44 by solving the eigenvalue problem ( [ eq4 ] ) . setting @xmath45 </S>",
    "<S> one obtains the diagonalizing transformation @xmath46 with @xmath47 ^ 2\\right)^{-1/2}$ ] and @xmath48u_1 $ ] ( without loss of generality , the arbitrary phases @xmath49 can be set to zero ) . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the new boson operators read @xmath50 and the hamiltonian reduces to @xmath51    when @xmath52 is time - independent the diagonalization decouples the heisenberg evolution equations for the boson operators @xmath53 and </S>",
    "<S> @xmath54 : @xmath55 otherwise , there is no point in diagonalizing the hamiltonian since the bogoliubov transformation will be time - dependent and the evolution of the new boson operators @xmath53 and @xmath54 will be coupled ( similar as the evolution equations for the original operators @xmath56 and @xmath57 ) .    in the classical stability theory </S>",
    "<S> the hessian ( [ eq7 ] ) describes a collision of two eigenfrequencies at @xmath58 ( @xmath59 from below or @xmath60 from above ) with the appearance of complex eigenvalues ( eigenfrequencies ) . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to the fact that the boson hamiltonian ( [ eq6 ] ) can not be diagonalized for @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding quantum instability can be thought as the exponential growth of the number of bosons , described by the boson operators @xmath56 and @xmath57 , since the total number is not conserved .    </S>",
    "<S> though the hamiltonian can not be diagonalized in the region of instability , the bogoliubov transformation ( [ eq2 ] ) plays an essential role in the solution of the heisenberg evolution equations . </S>",
    "<S> this statement is valid for _ any _ quadratic hamiltonian ( [ eq1 ] ) and follows from the fact that the action of the corresponding time evolution operator on the boson creation and annihilation operators can be represented by an appropriate time - dependent bogoliubov transformation ( which is different from the diagonalizing transformation ) . </S>",
    "<S> the latter fact is just a consequence of the boson commutation relations for the creation and annihilation operators .    </S>",
    "<S> let us consider the hamiltonian ( [ eq6 ] ) as an illustrative example . </S>",
    "<S> first one notes that @xmath61 can be eliminated by the unitary transformation with the generator @xmath62 , which results in the substitution @xmath63 and @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> then , taking into account the symmetry of the transposition @xmath65 , the bogoliubov transformation solving the heisenberg evolution equations can be cast as @xmath66 the condition @xmath67 requires that @xmath68 , while the second condition from equation ( [ eq2 ] ) is satisfied identically . </S>",
    "<S> differentiating equation ( [ eq8 ] ) with respect to time and expressing the constant operators @xmath69 and @xmath70 through the time - dependent operators @xmath71 and @xmath72 by using the inverse bogoliubov transformation one arrives at the following linear system for the parameters of the transformation @xmath73 a solution of system ( [ eq9 ] ) determines the corresponding solution to the heisenberg equations for the boson operators @xmath71 and @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the latter equations can be obtained by the formal replacement : @xmath74 and @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> note that the transformation defined by the solution of equation ( [ eq9 ] ) has nothing to do with the diagonalization of the hamiltonian </S>",
    "<S> .    system ( [ eq9 ] ) formally coincides with the normalized classical system , which obtains from the hamiltonian ( [ eq6 ] ) by replacing the boson operators with @xmath27-numbers ( equations ( [ eq18 ] ) and ( [ eq19 ] ) with @xmath76 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian ( [ eq6 ] ) can also be cast as a linear combination of generators of the group @xmath77 ( in our case : @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 with @xmath81 = \\pm\\mathcal{k}_\\pm$ ] and @xmath82 = -2\\mathcal{k}_0 $ ] ) , thus the quantum instability case is formally similar to the problem of parametrically forced quantum oscillator @xcite . however , the physics is quite different . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , in the quantum instability case there no adiabatic frequencies in the region of instability . </S>",
    "<S> the time - dependent bogoliubov transformation was first used in the solution of the forced oscillator problem in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    system ( [ eq9 ] ) is equivalent to the approach of refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . let us show , for instance , how the asymptotic formula of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , relating the boson operators at @xmath83 in the case @xmath84 , appears in our approach . </S>",
    "<S> the first order system ( [ eq9 ] ) is equivalent to a second order equation ( satisfied by both @xmath85 and @xmath86 ) . setting @xmath87 with @xmath88 we get the equation for the parabolic cylinder ( weber ) functions : @xcite @xmath89u_k(z/\\alpha ) = 0 \\label{eq10}\\ ] ] with @xmath90 . using the simplified version of the integrating bogoliubov transformation @xmath91 the asymptotic conditions @xmath92 and @xmath93 as @xmath94 complemented with the asymptotics of the first derivative derived from equation ( [ eq9 ] ) and the standard asymptotic formulae for the parabolic cylinder functions one can arrive at the asymptotic formula of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite : @xmath95^{1/2}a^{\\dagger}_{k^\\prime}(-\\infty),\\ ] ] @xmath96^{1/2 } , \\label{eq12}\\ ] ] with @xmath97 for @xmath98 and @xmath99 for @xmath100 .    </S>",
    "<S> it is noted that formula ( [ eq12 ] ) resembles the well - known landau - zener formula @xcite ( where the weber functions also play the key role , see for instance ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . however , the quantum instability due to a collision of two eigenfrequencies is completely different from the landau - zener problem . </S>",
    "<S> this is manifested by our system ( [ eq9 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , system ( [ eq9 ] ) resembles the landau - zener system but the evolution matrix on the r.h.s . </S>",
    "<S> of equation ( [ eq9 ] ) is not hermitian and the normalization condition for the `` wave vector '' @xmath101 is formulated in the minkowsky space rather than in the euclidian one . </S>",
    "<S> one consequence is that , as distinct from the landau - zener case , there is no equivalent of the adiabatic transition for slow time dependence of @xmath102 , since the boson system passes through a region ( @xmath32 ) where the diagonalized hamiltonian ( [ ad3 ] ) is invalid . in other words , there is no adiabatic eigenfrequencies slowly depending on time in the region of @xmath32 , instead the system is hyperbolic with the solution given by a combination of the exponents @xmath103 .    therefore , the principal physical difference from the landau - zener problem lies in the fact that , due to the very instability that system ( [ eq9 ] ) describes , the number of bosons grows in time and their interaction can not be neglected at all times , in general . </S>",
    "<S> let us consider what effect the interactions may have on the instability rate . </S>",
    "<S> remembering that the hamiltonian ( [ eq6 ] ) appears as an approximation to the full nonlinear hamiltonian ( for instance , with the binary atomic collision term in the case of molecular dissociation ) and eliminating the @xmath61 by @xmath104 and @xmath105 one arrives at the simplest non - quadratic hamiltonian describing the instability and interactions @xmath106 below , for simplicity , we will set all the interaction coefficients equal , @xmath107 . </S>",
    "<S> the heisenberg evolution equations written for the operators @xmath108 and @xmath109 , with @xmath110 , read @xmath111 where @xmath112 and @xmath113 .    system ( [ eq14 ] ) is equivalent to an infinite - dimensional linear system of equations arising in the fock representation of the schrdinger equation with the hamiltonian ( [ eq13 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that a satisfactory numerical simulation of such a system requires a large number of the fock modes to be used ( about 10 000 ) due to the spreading of the excitations over a large number of the fock amplitudes . </S>",
    "<S> this is in contrast to the linear case ( @xmath76 ) when the corresponding infinite dimensional system in the fock space is equivalent to the finite - dimensional system ( [ eq9 ] ) for the parameters of the the bogoliubov transformation .    </S>",
    "<S> therefore , in the nonlinear case one has to rely on an approximate system . </S>",
    "<S> our approximation is based on the replacement of the number operators @xmath114 and @xmath115 in equation ( [ eq14 ] ) by their averages . </S>",
    "<S> then the evolution of the boson operators @xmath116 and @xmath117 must be given by an appropriate bogoliubov transformation . </S>",

    "<S> it is interesting to compare the approximate system ( [ eq17 ] ) with the classical system resulting from the hamiltonian ( [ eq13 ] ) when the boson operators are replaced by the @xmath27-numbers : @xmath127 + \\gamma[c^*_1c^*_2 + c_1c_2 ] + g[(c^*_1)^2c_1 ^ 2 + c^*_1c_1c^*_2c_2 + ( c^*_2)^2c_2 ^ 2 ] . </S>",

    "<S> one difference between them lies in the definition of the nonlinearity coefficient . in the classical system </S>",
