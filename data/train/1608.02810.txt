    "the direct observation of the gravitational wave ( gw ) signal in events gw150914 and gw151226 @xcite , emitted by the coalescence of a compact binary system composed by two black holes ( bh ) is the dawn of the gw astronomy era .",
    "the measured signal from those events shows the expected signature of an inspiral and merger , and subsequent final black hole ringdown .",
    "this single event encourages further studies of properties and astrophysical implications of binary black hole ( bbh ) populations @xcite . among compact binary systems , binary neutron star ( bns ) mergers are another expected source candidate for gw astronomy .",
    "their composition and ultra - dense neutron star ( ns ) matter behavior encoded in the equation of state ( eos ) make them a unique target to be measured with ground - based interferometers ( advanced ligo @xcite , advanced virgo @xcite , and kagra @xcite ) , in order to understand the structure and properties of ns systems and the distribution of ns masses .",
    "the first bns system discovered is psr b1913 + 16 , better known as hulse - taylor binary @xcite , a pulsar which , together with another ns is in orbit around a common center of mass forming a binary star system . this system provided indirect evidence of the emission of gw as predicted by general relativity  @xcite ( from now on we will use the pulsar name to denote the corresponding bns system ) .",
    "since then , nine other binary neutron star systems have been discovered in our galaxy ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) . among them is also the binary system of the pulsar j0453 + 1559  @xcite , with a mass ratio of @xmath4 @xcite , confirming the existence of unequal mass bns systems in nature with a quite unexpected large mass difference between the two stars .",
    "this fact has the potential to change and improve our understanding on the nature of ns formation as well as their evolution and final fate .",
    "because of this , it also should be considered when computing templates of gw signals from bns mergers for data analysis pipelines .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,<,^,^,>,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ , < \" , ]     similarly , and as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : energyeos ] and table  [ tab : energyemittedeos ] , while there is almost no dependence of the total energy emitted in gws for @xmath5  ms after merger , there are clear differences after that .",
    "the apr4 model shows the highest amount of radiated energy , while the model using ms1 shows considerably less , and also stops emitting noticeably much sooner than the other three models .",
    "we have presented a study of the merger of six different known galactic systems of bnss of unequal mass with a mass ratio between @xmath0 and @xmath1 : j1756 - 2251 , j0737 - 3039a , j1906 + 0746 , b1534 + 12 , j0453 + 1559 and b1913 + 16 .",
    "for all of these , we used a semi - realistic , seven segment piece - wise polytropic slypp eos with a thermal component of @xmath6 .",
    "for the most extreme of these systems ( @xmath3 , j0453 + 1559 ) , we also have investigated the effects of different eoss , namely : apr4 , h4 , and ms1 .",
    "we follow the dynamics of the merger from the late stage of the inspiral process up to @xmath2 after the system has merged , either to form a hmns or a rotating bh .",
    "all simulations have been performed using only publicly available , open - source codes such as , the einstein toolkit code deployed for the dynamical evolution , and the lorene code for the generation of the initial models .",
    "all simulations start with the stars at a distance of , which corresponds to 3 - 4 orbits before merger , and all use a resolution of @xmath7  cu .",
    "we followed the late - inspiral phase and post - merger for more than ( in some cases up to ) .",
    "a detailed comparison with the now huge literature ( see @xcite ) on bns systems is difficult and beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "this is particularly difficult because in most of the work full details on the numerical setting and a detailed descriptions of the eos are lacking .",
    "also , in most of the numerical work the crust part of the eos is not considered or just approximated by a single polytropic eos .",
    "in fact , in the interpretation of the results one should keep in mind that the final scenario is strongly dependent on the eos , i.e. , that the post - merger remnant may be either a ( supra)massive neutron star ( smns ) , a ( hyper)massive neutron star ( hmns ) , or directly a bh surrounded by an accretion disk .    in all evolutions presented in this work , the amount of baryonic matter leaving the grid is less than 0.01  @xmath8 .",
    "using the sly eos ( in its piece - wise polytropic representation used here ) , of the simulated systems , j1756 - 2251 and j0737 - 3039a result in a smns ( very close to the threshold @xmath9 to be hmns ) , while all the other correspond to hmnss .",
    "only two of the hmnss collapse to a bh within the simulated time ( ) ; one right after the merger ( b1913 + 16 , hulse - taylor system ) , and the second after a short hyper massive ns phase formation of ( b1534 + 12 ) .",
    "these cases have some resemblance to the already analyzed cases in  @xcite , namely models sly16vs16 and sly15vs15 , respectively",
    ". both models result in a bh surrounded by an accretion disk , but with a disk of very much different mass .",
    "the final dimensionless rotational parameter of the bh ( @xmath10 ) is @xmath11 for b1913 + 16 , while the expected final value for b1534 + 12 is @xmath12 .",
    "we also considered the evolution of j0453 + 1559 , using also three different eoss .",
    "the remnant just after the merger is a hmns for sly and h4 , while it is a smns in the case of apr4 , and in the case of m1 the system is even below the non - rotating maximum mass",
    ". nevertheless , none of these models collapses to a bh within the first after merger .",
    "we have also shown that the inspiral phase of the merger is not very sensible to the eos .",
    "dominant effects should be related to the eccentricity , as shown in  @xcite , but not studied here .",
    "tidal effects during this phase may in principle be detected by future ligo / virgo / kagra detectors and will depend on eccentricity .",
    "thus , it is crucial to reduce the orbital eccentricity in simulations to maximize the precision with which we can extract neutron - star parameters and constrain the neutron star eos from gw observations . this task has already been considered in  @xcite , and we will leave the task to find the appropriate method to generate the ( still - lacking ) public initial data with no eccentricity to future work .    most of the energy in gws is emitted during the merger ( from before to after it ) .",
    "the gw signal during the inspiral is essentially identical for all models .",
    "on the other hand , the total amount of energy emitted in the post - merger ( from to after merger ) is almost of the same size as the total energy emitted during the whole inspiral phase ( from infinite separation to before merger ) .",
    "we note that for the more extreme unequal mass case ( j0453 + 1559 ) the total energy emitted is much reduced , in agreement with the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was shown that the gw luminosity is suppressed as the mass ratio of the two stars decreases .",
    "there is also the notable exception of b1913 + 16 , which promptly collapses to a bh and shortly after stops emitting gws .",
    "this is similar to binary black hole mergers , which would make it more difficult to discriminate this case from a bbh merger .    finally , we would like to remark that the merger and post - merger phases show a very complicated gw pattern , stemming likely from very complex excitation mode dynamics .",
    "because of this , we expect it to be unlikely that semi - analytic templates could be assembled to represent the full gw signal from the inspiral to the post - merger phase .",
    "the only common characteristic ( beside the one from inspiral phase up to five before merger ) seems to be that there is a final and sustained phase in the late post - merger dynamics in which there is only a dominating mode in the 22-component .",
    "this project greatly benefited from the availability of public software that enabled us to conduct all simulations , namely `` lorene '' and the `` einstein toolkit '' .",
    "we do express our gratitude the many people that contributed to their realization .",
    "this work would have not been possible without the support of the suma infn project that provided the financial support of the work of af and the computer resources of the cineca `` galileo '' hpc machine , where most of the simulations were performed .",
    "other computational resources were provided by he louisiana optical network initiative ( qb2 , allocations loni_hyrel , loni_numrel , and loni_cactus ) , and by the lsu hpc facilities ( supermike ii , allocations hpc_hyrel15 and hpc_numrel ) .",
