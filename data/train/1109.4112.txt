    "one of the great mysteries of the universe today is the nature of dark energy which drives the late time cosmic acceleration . this has been confirmed by number of observational results including type - ia supernovae @xcite , cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) (  komatsu et al .",
    "( 2011 ) ) as well as the latest surveys of the large scale structure (  eisenstein et al .",
    "( 2005 ) ) .",
    "there has been wide range of contrasting proposals to explain this late time cosmic acceleration .",
    "most popular of these is to include a dark candidate with a large negative pressure ( also known as dark energy ) in the energy budget of the universe (  bean et al .",
    "( 2005 ) ,  copeland et al .",
    "( 2006 ) ,  li et al .",
    "( 2011 ) ,  padmanabhan(2003 ) ,  peebles & ratra  ( 2003 ) ,  sahni & starobinsky  ( 2000 ) ) .",
    "the simplest candidate for this dark energy is a cosmological constant @xmath0 .",
    "however , the well - known fine tuning and coincidence problems render @xmath0 a rather unattractive proposal from a theoretical point of view . going beyond @xmath0 , scalar field models with generic features",
    "are perhaps the simplest alternatives to a cosmological constant . a large class of scalar field models including quintessence (  ratra & peebles  ( 1988 ) ,  caldwell et al .  ( 1998 ) ,  liddle & scherrer  ( 1999 ) ,  steinhardt et al .  ( 1999 ) ) , tachyon (  abramo & finelli  ( 2003 ) ,  bagla et al .",
    "( 2003 ) ,  aguirregabiria & lazkoz  ( 2004 ) ,  copeland et al .",
    "( 2005 ) ) phantom (  caldwell  ( 2002 ) ) and k - essence (  armendariz et al .  ( 2001 ) ,  scherrer  ( 2004 ) ,  sen  ( 2006 ) ,  vikman  ( 2005 ) ) have been thoroughly investigated in recent years to explain the late time acceleration of the universe .",
    "the advantage of these scalar field models is that not only can they alleviate the fine tuning and coincidence problem , they can also mimick a cosmological constant at present epoch .",
    "these models have equation of state as a function of redshifts .",
    "this feature is important to distinguish these scalar field models from cosmological constant as large amount observational data from higher redshifts are coming in or expected to come in near future .",
    "the simplest scalar field is the one with linear potential having a canonical kinteic energy . in this case , the scalar field is frozen initially due to large hubble damping and behaves like a cosmological constant with @xmath2 .",
    "as the universe expands and hubble damping decreases , the field starts rolling and the equation of state starts deviating away from @xmath3 . but because the potential has no minima , the model gives a collapsing universe in future which results in a finite history for our universe (  kratochvil et al .",
    "( 2004 ) ) .",
    "more complicated scalar field models can be divided in to two broad classes : the fast roll and slow roll models , also termed as freezing / tracking and thawing models (  caldwell & linder  ( 2005 ) ) .",
    "the fast roll models have steep potentials allowing the scalar field to mimick the background matter / radiation , and to remain subdominant for most of the history of the universe . only at late times",
    ", the field becomes dominant and starts behaving like a component with negative pressure driving the acceleration of the universe . on the other hand , slow roll or thawing models are similar to the inflaton field , where the potential is sufficiently flat .",
    "due to this , kinetic energy of the field is much smaller than the potential energy and field is initially frozen due to large hubble damping in the early universe . that is why initially @xmath4 , and the energy density of the scalar field is nearly constant and have a negligible contribution to the total energy budget of the universe .",
    "but as the background radiation / matter gets diluted due to the expansion of the universe , the background energy density becomes comparable to the scalar field energy density .",
    "at this moment , the scalar field starts thawing and slowly evolves away from the frozen @xmath4 state towards a higher value of @xmath5 .",
    "however , in this case some degree of fine tuning is needed in order to get a suitable late time evolution .",
    "one of the early studies for thawing models was by alam et al .",
    "(  alam et al .  ( 2003 ) ) where they studied the decaying dark energy models which have thawing type cosmological evolution .",
    "recently , scherrer and sen (  scherrer & sen  ( 2008a))have studied the thawing scalar field models with a nearly flat potential satisfying the slow roll conditions . they have shown that under such conditions , thawing models with variety of potentials evolve in a similar fashion and results in a unique analytic expression for the equation of state @xmath6 .",
    "this result was later extended to the case of phantom models (  scherrer & sen  ( 2008b ) ) and tachyon scalar field models (  ali et al .",
    "( 2009 ) ) . in another work , thawing models ( for both canonical and non canonical scalar field ) have been studied without the assumption of the slow roll condition (  sen et al .",
    "( 2010 ) ) . in a more recent work , dutta and scherrer (  dutta & scherrer  ( 2011))have studied the slow roll freezing scalar field models and derived an analytical expression for the equation of state @xmath5 as a function of the energy density of the scalar field @xmath7 .",
    "there is another elegant way to explain the present cosmic acceleration .",
    "this is achieved through the large scale modification of the gravitational sector of the theory .",
    "these models include dgp model (  dvali et al .",
    "( 2000 ) ) , cardassian model (  freese & lewis  ( 2002 ) ) , modified gcg model (  barreiro & sen  ( 2004 ) ) , f(r ) theories (  starobinsky  ( 2007 ) ,  hu & sawicki  ( 2007),amendola et al .",
    "( 2007 ) ) , galileon models (  nicolis et al .",
    "( 2009 ) ,  chow & khoury  ( 2009 ) ) as well as models having non local gravitational interactions (  deser & woodard  ( 2007 ) ) .    with current obsevational data",
    ", the concordance @xmath0cdm indeed appears to provide a very good fit to the present observations .",
    "hence , for any given dark energy model ( different from @xmath0cdm ) , it is natural to ask how to distinguish it from @xmath0cdm . keeping this in mind ,",
    "different diagnostic measures have been proposed .",
    "@xmath8 diagnostic and the statefinders are two elegant examples for such diagnostic measures .",
    "recently , another interesting diagnostic measure , ` _ statefinder hierarchy _",
    ", @xmath9 ' ( with @xmath10 ) , has been introduced by arabsalmani and sahni (  arabsalmani & sahni  ( 2011 ) ) .",
    "it was shown that while all the @xmath9 s remain fixed at unity during the entire evolution of the universe for concordance @xmath0cdm , they are in general time dependent for dark energy models . hence they can be used not only to compare different dark energy models with @xmath0cdm but also to compare different theoretical approaches to explain present cosmic acceleration .    in the present investigation , we consider thawing dark energy models involving canonical scalar fields .",
    "we do not assume the slow roll conditions on the potential of the field .",
    "we first use the statefinder diagnostic @xmath9 to compare different thawing models with other dark energy models as well as with modified gravity proposal such as dgp model .",
    "next , we use the latest observational results involving background cosmology to put constraints on the deviations of the thawing models from the @xmath0cdm behaviour .",
    "we also forecast constraints from future observations .",
    "we assume that dark energy is decsribed by a minimally coupled scalar field @xmath11 with canonical kinetic energy , governed by the equation of motion @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the hubble parameter determined by the einstein equation @xmath14 we work in the natural unit @xmath15 . here , @xmath16 is the non - relativistic matter ( pressure @xmath17 ) content of the universe and the @xmath18 is the energy density of the scalar field .",
    "we assume a spatially flat universe , so that @xmath19 .    with this , one can form an autonomous system using equations ( [ sf ] ) and ( [ hub ] ) ( see  scherrer & sen  ( 2008a ) ) for detail derivation ) : @xmath20 here @xmath21 ( @xmath22 being the equation of state for the scalar field ) , and @xmath23     versus @xmath24 .",
    "larger value of @xmath25 corresponds to the distant past ( @xmath26 ) whereas , the smaller value @xmath27 corresponds to the future .",
    "@xmath28 for this plot .",
    "the different * solid lines * are ( right to left ) : thawing quintessence model with @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 respectively . the * dashed lines * corresponds to cg ( 1 ) , gcg ( 2 ) , dgp ( 3 ) , cpl ( 4 ) , @xmath34 ( 5 ) .",
    "the region between two vertical solid lines roughly corresponds the present epoch.,width=302 ]    .,width=302 ]    given the initial conditions for @xmath35 , @xmath7 and @xmath36 , one can solve the above system for any potential @xmath37 ( the information about the form of the potential is encoded in @xmath38 ) . as our goal is to study the thawing models , the scalar field",
    "is initially frozen due to large hubble damping ( i.e @xmath39 ) .",
    "hence @xmath40 initially which gives @xmath41 as initial condition .",
    "we shall not assume slow - roll conditions for the potential @xmath37 .",
    "hence , the initial value @xmath42 is a parameter in our model .",
    "this initial value of @xmath42 determines the deviation of @xmath22 from the initial @xmath43 frozen state as the universe evolves . for smaller @xmath42 ,",
    "the deviation is negligibly small , and the scalar field behaves as a cosmological constant at all time . for larger values of @xmath42 , @xmath22 deviates substantially from @xmath44 as the universe evolves . in general , the contribution of scalar field to the total energy density is negligible in the early universe .",
    "nevertheless one has to fine tune the initial value of @xmath7 in order to have its correct contribution at present .",
    "hence @xmath45 is related to the @xmath46 . with this",
    "we evolve our system from the intial era @xmath47 till any redshift we want .",
    "we consider various power - law potentials for which @xmath38 is a constant . in recent past ,",
    "clemson and liddle have considered thawing models using a multiparameter extension of the exponential potential (  clemson & liddle  ( 2009 ) ) .",
    "one can taylor expand the scale factor of the universe around the present era ( @xmath48 ) as follows : @xmath49^n , \\label{state}\\ ] ] where , @xmath50 it is easy to check that @xmath51 is the deceleration parameter .",
    "similarly @xmath52 is related to the statefinder @xmath53 or jerk @xmath54 and @xmath55 is related to the snap @xmath56 and so on . using the equations ( [ state ] ) and ( [ alpha ] )",
    ", one can now define the statefinder hierarchy @xmath9 (  arabsalmani & sahni  ( 2011 ) ) as : @xmath57    it is remarkable to see that for @xmath0cdm , @xmath58 during the entire history of the universe . in the rest of this section we use different combinations of @xmath9 , to study the evolution of thawing models and",
    "compare them with other popular dark energy and modified gravity models.we consider the following models :    * dark energy with a constant equation of state , @xmath59 .",
    "* dark energy with a cpl parametrized equation of state (  chevallier & polarski  ( 2001 ) ,  linder  ( 2003 ) ) , @xmath60 , where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are constants . * dark energy with a generalized chaplygin gas (  bento et al .",
    "( 2002 ) ) type equation of state , @xmath63 , where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are constant .",
    "@xmath66 gives the standard chaplygin gas .",
    "* dvali , gabadadze and porrati ( dgp ) model (  dvali et al .",
    "( 2000 ) ) .",
    ".,width=302 ]    in fig.1 , we show the behaviours of the models in the @xmath67 phase plane .",
    "the figure shows that in this phase plane which involves the second derivative of the scale factor , the models are highly degenerate around the present value of @xmath68 .",
    "as we go to the higher order @xmath9 s , one can remove these degeneracies among various models .",
    "this is revealed in the subsequent figures , fig . 2 and fig . 3 where we show the phase portrait in the @xmath69 and @xmath70 planes respectively .",
    "4 we show the phase portrait in @xmath71 plane where again the degeneracies among different models are broken .",
    "we should comment on @xmath72 in particular . from fig . 2 and fig . 4",
    ", one can see that @xmath72 can be used to break the degeneracies among the thawing models themselves as its present day value varies substantially for different thawing potentials .",
    "similarly , @xmath73 lets us differentiate between thawing and other models . we should mention that although we assume @xmath74 for these figures , the conclusions remain same for other values of @xmath1 .    .",
    "dashed lines are same as fig 1 .",
    "the solid lines ( top to bottom ) : thawing quintessence model with @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 respectively .",

    "( dashed)_.the dots _ ( black ) _ represents the potentials @xmath78 ( from top to bottom , for each z)respectively.,width=302 ]    with future data , one can probe the background expansion at higher redshifts thereby probing the higher derivatives of the scale factor .",
    "hence statefinder hierarchy will be quite useful to distinguish various dark energy models .",
    "we further study the @xmath79 phase plane for different thawing dark energy models . here ` prime ' denotes the differentiation with respect to @xmath80 . as discussed in the previous section , for smaller values of @xmath42 ,",
    "all the thawing models behave similar to the cosmological constant .",
    "so to study the @xmath79 phase plane , we assume @xmath81 for which the thawing models behave significantly different from cosmological constant . linder and caldwell",
    "have previously showed that the thawing models are constrained to lie between @xmath82 region in @xmath79 phase plane . in fig . 5 and fig .",
    "6 , we show different thawing models in the @xmath79 phase plane at different redshifts and compare them with the constraint proposed by linder and caldwell (  caldwell & linder  ( 2005 ) ) ( lc ) .",
    "it can be seen that for higher redshifts , all the thawing models are inside the lc bound .",
    "this is obvious as all the thawing models behave very close to cosmological constant for larger redshifts and hence satisfy the lc bound .",
    "but at the present epoch ( z=0 ) , for smaller values of @xmath1 , thawing models with certain potentials ( as shown in figure 5 ) are outside the lc bound . but as one increases the value of @xmath1 ( see figure 6 ) , they tend to satisfy the lc bound .",
    "hence thawing models which deviate significantly from the @xmath0cdm behaviour at smaller redshift tend to satisfy the lc bound for higher values of @xmath1 whereas for lower values of @xmath1 , some of the potentials do not satisfy the lc bound .    ,",
    "in this section , we constrain the parameters in the thawing scalar field models with the assumption of a flat universe by using the latest observational data including the type-1a supernovae union2 compilation (  amanullah et al .",

    ", we use the data coming from different recent observations e.g snia , bao , cmb as well as h(z ) measurements .",

    "when we consider the current data , there is always an upper bound on @xmath42 .",
    "this upper bound is most prominent for the linear potential .",
    "hence this gives strong constraint on deviation from the @xmath0cdm behaviour for the linear potential . for exponential or inverse",
    "squared potential , this deviation is not strongly constrained and @xmath42 as large as 1 is allowed even at @xmath118 confidence level . moreover",
    "if one takes into account the wmap7 bound on @xmath1 , current data always allow the @xmath0cdm behaviour ( @xmath119 ) for all the potentials .",
    "but this changes as one does similar analysis with the simulated data for future sn - surveys like jdem (  holsclaw  ( 2010 ) ) . with this , considering the wmap7 bound on @xmath1 , although @xmath0cdm ( @xmath119 ) is allowed for some values of @xmath1 , for other values of @xmath1 , @xmath42 has a lower bound different from zero .",

    "for all the potentials that we considered , one can rule out @xmath0cdm at @xmath118 confidence level for some values of @xmath1 using simulated data for future - sn survey like jdem .",
    "although we study a generic class of dark energy , e.g the thawing models , this shows the advantage of the large scale surveys like jdem to distinguish different dark energy models from @xmath0cdm which is difficult with the presently available data .",
    "next we study how effective is the simulated data in distinguishing different dark energy models using the _ statefinder hierarchies_. in section 2 , we already mentioned that @xmath72 is the most promising parameter to distinguish different dark energy models . keeping this in mind ,",
    "we calculate the bound on the present day value of @xmath72 , using the simulated jdem data for different values of @xmath1 . in figure 11 , the regions inside the horizontal lines show this bound at @xmath118 confidence level .",
    "this bound on @xmath72 is valid for all thawing models with power law potentials and is independent of the power law form .",
    "as one can see , the bound becomes narrower as one increases the @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , it is clear that as one decreases the value of @xmath1 , e.g. @xmath121 , @xmath122 is outside the @xmath118 allowed region ruling out the @xmath0cdm . but for higher values of @xmath1 , @xmath0cdm is allowed .",
    "this is consisnent with our earlier conclusions from fig 7 - fig 10 .    in the same figure",
