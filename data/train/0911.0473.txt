    "<S> we investigate the recovery chances of highly spinning waveforms immersed in ligo s5-like noise by performing a matched filtering with @xmath0 randomly chosen spinning waveforms generated with the lal package . while the masses of the compact binary are reasonably well recovered ( slightly overestimated ) , the same does not hold true for the spins . </S>",
    "<S> we show the best fit matches both in the time - domain and the frequency - domain . </S>",
    "<S> these encompass some of the spinning characteristics of the signal , but far less than what would be required to identify the astrophysical parameters of the system . </S>",
    "<S> an improvement of the matching method is necessary , though may be difficult due to the noisy signal .    </S>",
    "<S> we report on an attempt to recover a gravitational wave signal @xmath1 immersed in ligo s5-like noise by a matched filtering with @xmath0 randomly chosen templates generated with spinning waveforms @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we applied the following process to generate a ligo s5-like noise sample of n elements : ( i ) cut out a stretch of 2n elements from an arbitrary sample of real ligo s5 noise , ( ii ) cut the stretch into half , resulting in two stretches of n elements , ( iii ) fourier - transfom both stretches with an fft method , resulting in two samples of n complex elements , ( iv ) combine the magnitude values of the first spectrum with the phase values of the second spectrum , resulting in a complex spectrum of n elements , ( v ) apply an inverse fft on the combined spectrum , and use the real part of the resulting array as our ligo s5-like noise sample . </S>",
    "<S> this method has the advantage of preserving the basic spectral and statistical properties of the original ligo data , while discarding any real gravitational wave signatures  that might be present within the original data stretch .        </S>",
    "<S> the matched filtering follows the method described in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> namely , we calculate the _ overlap _ between the noisy injection @xmath2 and the spinning templates @xmath3 as @xmath4 = \\frac{\\left\\langle h_{n , i}|h_{template}\\right\\rangle } { \\sqrt{\\left\\langle h_{n , i}|h_{n , i}\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle h_{template}|h_{template}\\right\\rangle } } ~ ,   \\label{o}\\]]where@xmath5with @xmath6 the fourier transform of @xmath7 and @xmath8 the power spectral density of the noise . </S>",
    "<S> we choose @xmath9hz and @xmath10hz , which lies in the best sensitivity of the ligo detectors , also the post - newtonian prediction for the waveform can be considered reasonably accurate . </S>",
    "<S> the most lengthy templates in this domain were found to last for approximately @xmath11 sec .        on theoretical grounds , </S>",
    "<S> an infinitely long data series would be required for exact determination of the power spectrum . in order to achieve a stability of the power spectrum of the order of @xmath12 </S>",
    "<S> , we would like to have at least @xmath13 periods of all frequencies to be included in the power spectrum , therefore a minimal length of the templates of @xmath14 sec was imposed . </S>",
    "<S> as we know where the injection commences in the noise time sequence , we simplify our analysis by comparing with templates beginning at the same instant @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> further , we also assume identical antenna functions of @xmath16 both for the injection and templates </S>",
    "<S> . moreover , all parameters of the injection and templates other then the masses @xmath17 and spins ( given by their dimensionless magnitude @xmath18 , polar and azimuthal angles @xmath19 , @xmath20 , taken in the inertial system with the line of sight on the @xmath21-axis ) were kept fixed . </S>",
    "<S> these parameters were the distance of the binary @xmath22mpc , and the polar angle of the orbital angular momentum @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> the initial phase @xmath24 .    </S>",
    "<S> we picked up the injection signal as one of the longests available ( see fig [ fig1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of a high spin induces a strong amplitude modulation , but also a less visible frequency modulation . for comparison , </S>",
    "<S> we have also represented on fig [ fig1 ] the corresponding non - spinning signal , with the same masses , but the spins switched off .     templates . </S>",

    "<S> for comparison , the injected signal is also shown .    </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that even with all the simplifying assumptions adopted , ( a ) either the number of @xmath0 templates employed was still insufficient or ( b ) the @xmath40 additional parameters introduced by the spins cause severe degeneracies , which can not be resolved by this method . in this context </S>",
    "<S> we note that the use of a markov - chain monte - carlo technique @xcite , @xcite may turn useful in the recovery of spinning signals </S>",
