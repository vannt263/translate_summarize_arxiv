    "waveguide arrays ( was ) have been used intensively to simulate the evolution of a non - relativistic quantum mechanical particle in a periodic potential @xcite . many fundamental phenomena in non - relativistic classical and quantum mechanics such as bloch oscillations @xcite and zener tunneling @xcite have been investigated both theoretically and experimentally by using was .",
    "it was shown in recent studies that most of the nonlinear phenomena usually associated to fiber optics ( such as the emission of resonant radiation from solitons and soliton self - frequency shift ) can also take place in specially excited was , but in the spatial domain rather than in the temporal domain @xcite .",
    "in addition , a supercontinuum in both frequency and wave number domains can be generated in nonlinear was @xcite .",
    "binary waveguide arrays ( bwas ) have been used to mimic relativistic phenomena typical of quantum field theory ( qft ) , such as klein tunneling @xcite , _ zitterbewegung _ ( trembling motion of a free dirac electron ) @xcite , and fermion pair production @xcite , which are all based on the properties of the dirac equation @xcite .",
    "the discrete gap solitons in bwas in the _ classical _ context have been investigated both numerically @xcite and experimentally @xcite .",
    "gap and out - gap solitons and breathers in bwas have been investigated @xcite .",
    "these gap solitons were already known in @xcite for diatomic lattices , and later derived in their continuum - limit form for the bwa system in @xcite .",
    "recently , the explicit suggestion to use bwas to simulate a quantum nonlinear dirac equation has been put forward in @xcite where the gap solitons in bwas have been shown to be connected to dirac solitons ( dss ) in a nonlinear extension of the relativistic one - dimensional ( 1d ) dirac equation describing the dynamics of a freely moving relativistic particle . the 1d ds stability ,",
    "its dynamics and different scenarios of soliton interaction have been systematically investigated in @xcite .",
    "the formation and dynamics of two - dimensional dss in square binary waveguide lattices have also been considered in @xcite .",
    "the higher - order dirac solitons in bwas have been studied in @xcite . although there is currently no evidence for fundamental quantum nonlinearities ,",
    "nonlinear versions of the dirac equation have been studied for a long time , mainly because they allow the exploration of extreme physical environments , such as , for instance , dirac particles dynamics in astrophysical objects @xcite , or the influence of fermion fields in general relativity singularities @xcite .",
    "one of the earlier extensions was investigated by heisenberg himself @xcite in the context of field theory and was motivated by the question of mass . in the quantum mechanical context , nonlinear dirac equations have been used as effective theories in atomic , nuclear and gravitational physics @xcite , and in the field of topological insulators @xcite . to this",
    "regard , bwas can offer a unique platform to simulate nonlinear extensions of the dirac equation when probed at high light intensities .    in this work ,",
    "we explore the possibility of creating the optical analogue of a special topological state , known in qft as a _ jackiw - rebbi _ ( jr ) solution @xcite .",
    "this solution is a type of topological edge state , which exists at the ( continuous or discontinuous ) interface of two waveguide array regions where the dirac mass changes sign .",
    "we study the linear and _ nonlinear _ properties of the jr - state , which is possible by using the kerr nonlinearity of the waveguides forming the array . finally , we explore the excitability of jr - states starting from two dirac solitons with masses of opposite sign , propagating individually in each waveguide array .",
    "this new photonics state can have important applications in light manipulation and circuitry , or in the generation of robust , topologically protected correlated photon sources .",
    "light propagation in a discrete , periodic binary array of kerr nonlinear waveguides can be described , in the monochromatic regime , by the following dimensionless coupled - mode equations ( cmes ) @xcite : @xmath0 - ( -1)^{n } \\sigma a_{n } +   \\gamma |a_{n}(z)|^{2}a_{n}(z)=0,\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is the electric field amplitude in the @xmath2th waveguide , @xmath3 is the longitudinal spatial coordinate , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the propagation mismatch and the coupling coefficient between two adjacent waveguides of the array , respectively , and @xmath6 is the nonlinear coefficient of waveguides which is positive for self - focusing , but negative for self - defocusing media . for @xmath7 ( for the left - hand side bwa )",

    "after setting @xmath11 and @xmath12 , and following the standard approach developed in @xcite we can introduce the continuous transverse coordinate @xmath13 and the two - component spinor @xmath14 = @xmath15 which satisfies the 1d nonlinear dirac equation @xcite : @xmath16 where the nonlinear terms @xmath17 ; @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the usual pauli matrices .",

    "@xcite and are initially motionless in the transverse direction with centers at waveguides @xmath2 = @xmath48 10 .",
    "these two dirac solitons repel each other during propagation , and at the same time a jr - state is formed at the center of the array . in figs . [ fig3](c ) and [ fig3](e ) we plot the beam profiles and its phase patterns , respectively , at four propagation distances @xmath3 = 0 ( red ) , 100 ( blue ) , 200 ( green ) , and 300 ( black ) of the jr - state shown in fig . [ fig3](a ) .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that at the input the overlapping of the two dirac solitons is weak and we have the profile which is totally different from the one of a jr - state .",
    "however , the phase pattern of the field at the center of the array at the input ( see the red curve in fig . [ fig3](e ) ) is identical to the one of the jr - state as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1](d ) ( note the trivial fact that the phase difference equal to 2@xmath49 means fields are just in - phase ) .",
    "this requirement for phase pattern at the input is crucial for formation of the jr - states later during propagation . for two symmetric dirac solitons located at two bwas as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) this phase pattern is only obtained if these two dirac solitons are initially out - of - phase .",

    "we have shown in figs .",
    "[ fig3](a ) , [ fig3](c ) , and [ fig3](e ) that a jr - state can be formed from two out - of - phase dirac solitons . in the same way",

    "[ fig3](b ) , [ fig3](d ) , and [ fig3](f ) that a _ quasi _",
    "jr - state can also be formed from just one dirac soliton which is initially located close to the border of the two bwas .",
    "however , in this case , the peak amplitude of the established _ quasi _",
    "jr - state as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](d ) is about three times weaker than the jr - state shown in fig . [",
    "fig3](c ) . the phase pattern of this beam as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig3](f ) is also not perfectly identical to the one of a true jr - state .",
    "we have analytically and numerically demonstrated the existence of the optical analogue of edge states - known in quantum field theory as the jackiw - rebbi states - formed at the interface of two bwas having propagation mismatches with opposite signs .",
    "remarkably , the localized jr states can be formed both in linear and nonlinear regimes and can be divided into two types with different amplitude profiles depending on the signs of propagation mismatches at the interface .",
    "we have also shown the excitation of jr - states from dirac solitons . due to the robustness of the topological jr - states , we envision important future applications in the generation of topologically - protected correlated photons , using a similar scheme as proposed recently in ref .",
