    "observational understanding of the initial assembly of galaxies within the early universe arises by tracing the luminosities and characteristics of galaxies as a function of redshift .",
    "the astrophysical questions are fundamental : how and when did the first generation of stars form and assemble into galaxies ? when and how did the supermassive black holes ( smbh ) within quasars or active galactic nuclei ( agns ) develop ?",
    "how massive can be early galaxies and smbh ?",
    "what is the connection between initial star formation and agn ?    a specific observational challenge is to trace these formation processes to their highest redshifts . for luminous quasars and luminous star formation ,",

    "it is also known , however , that there are many luminous but dusty sources whose dust obscures the primary optical , ultraviolet and even x - ray sources of luminosity .",
    "the existence of such dusty objects means that a census of the universe derived only from optical observations must be incomplete .",
    "it is known , for example , that the most luminous galaxies ( @xmath3 @xmath12 10@xmath13 l@xmath6 ) in the local universe are the ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs , e.g. soifer , neugebauer and houck 1987 , sanders and mirabel 1996 ) whose luminosity arises from reemission by dust at infrared wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation initially generated at much shorter wavelengths .",
    "surveys in the submillimeter initially discovered individual , optically obscured , dusty sources at redshifts z @xmath14 2 @xcite .",
    "various observing programs to understand optically faint infrared sources using spectra from the @xmath0 infrared spectrometer ( irs ; houck et al .",

    "this @xmath0-discovered population of high redshift ulirgs has large infrared to optical flux ratios [ @xmath16(24 ) @xmath12 1 mjy and @xmath17 @xmath12 24 ] and has been labeled  dust obscured galaxies \" ( dogs ; dey et al .",
    "dogs are the high redshift , most luminous examples of ulirgs .",
    "the requirement for a high redshift population of agn with substantial multiwavelength extinction was initially demonstrated by the spectrum of the x - ray background , requiring a harder spectrum than could be explained by the population of unobscured type 1 agn and quasars @xcite .",
    "this harder spectrum was explained by a population of  compton - thick \" agn having sufficient column densities of gas ( @xmath14 10@xmath18 @xmath19 ) to absorb soft x - rays ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "various studies confirmed the presence of a population of obscured agn ( usually considered as type 2 agn ) that outnumbers unobscured agn ( type 1 agn ) by a factor of a few @xcite .",
    "the most luminous dogs also have multiwavelength spectral characteristics of agn , including x - ray luminosity , `` power law '' near infrared spectra without indication of stellar spectral features , and mid - infrared spectra without the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) features that characterise starbursts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a natural conclusion is that these sources are a population of agn that represents those type 2 agn which are most extreme in obscuration and luminosity .",
    "the major advantage of using infrared luminosities to characterise sources is that all agn can be compared consistently without the uncertain extinction corrections necessary for luminosity measures at shorter wavelengths .",
    "for example , dust extinction at 0.2 is a factor of @xmath15 100 greater than at 20 @xcite . with the completion of the @xmath0 mission and the full archive of spectra from the irs , many previously defined samples of agn and quasars",

    "the uniform sample of agn in @xcite discovered because of high energy x - rays in the all sky sample from the burst alert telescope ( bat ) on the @xmath1 small explorer @xcite ; 125 of these have irs low resolution spectra .",
    "the agn with the most accurate determinations of virial black hole masses , using the reverberation mapping technique to determine scale size of the broad line region @xcite ; 32 have irs low resolution spectra ( many of these are also in the bat sample ) .",
    "the 100 type 1 quasars most luminous in the mid - infrared [ @xmath2(7.8 ) ] ; these are found by combining an empirical spectral template determined with the irs for type 1 agn and quasars with photometry at 22 from the wide - field infrared survey explorer ( wise , wright et al .",

    "the results give consistent measures of dust luminosity for local agn and for the most luminous type 1 quasars to z = 5 .",
    "results are compared to the infrared luminosities for the most luminous dogs discovered both by @xmath0 and by wise .",
    "the mid - infrared spectra of agn are dominated by the continuum emission from dust and show direct evidence of either dust emission or absorption , revealed primarily by the 9.7 silicate feature ( figure 1 ) .",
    "the presence of silicate absorption means there is cooler dust between the observer and the hotter dust responsible for the infrared continuum .",
    "the infrared spectra of absorbed agn are consistent with observing an agn behind dust clouds , with dust on the inner side of the absorbing clouds heated by the agn ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . when classifiable optically , these agn are most often type 2 @xcite but often are not classifiable optically because of strong extinction of the agn .",
    "by contrast , type 1 agn and quasars generally show silicate emission ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which indicates that the hot dust is observed without intervening cool dust .",
    "this arises when the circumnuclear dust clouds are observed sufficiently face on that the heated side of the clouds is directly observed so silicate emission is seen . while orientation effects alone may not explain all the spectroscopic differences among agn , the success of dusty torus models in explaining all agn types indicates that circumnuclear dust is a general characteristic of agn @xcite .",
    "the geometrical dust distributions required to explain silicate absorption and emission observed in irs spectra , and how this relates to optical classifications , have been carefully discussed @xcite .",
    "the essential conclusions are that the only geometries ruled out by observations are spherically symmetric and uniform dust screens .",
    "silicate absorption can take place through either uniform screens or clumpy dust distributions , but silicate emission can not be observed unless some lines of sight do not pass through dust which is cooler than the emitting dust",
    ". presence of silicate emission requires , therefore , either toroidal distributions of dust or spherical distributions of clumpy dust so that there are some lines of sight where an observer can see directly the emitting dust heated by the agn .",
    "detailed models of dust distributions including optical depth effects for absorbing clouds are not completely consistent with the simplest  unified theory \" whereby all agn are fundamentally similar but differ in appearance from type 1 to type 2 only because of orientation to the observer . a distribution of dust geometries",
    "is required , and the most extreme examples derive from the most extreme geometries with the largest covering factors for the dust @xcite . for our purposes in the present paper ,",
    "the most important question is how well the infrared luminosity from dust , @xmath8 , measures the total intrinsic luminosity , @xmath10 , generated by the agn .",
    "the ratio @xmath8/@xmath10 is a measure of the covering factor of the dust clouds which absorb the primary radiation from @xmath10 and reemit as @xmath8 .",
    "although the presence of silicate absorption or emission in infrared spectra generally correlates with type 2 and type 1 optical classification , the qualitative nature of optical classifications and the dependence of optical parameters on extinction corrections provides a motive for classification based only on the infrared silicate spectrum . in the present paper ,",
    "we quantitatively classify sources depending on the measured strength of the silicate absorption or emission .",
    "we call sources  obscured agn `` if they have silicate absorption and ' ' unobscured agn \" if they have silicate emission . this single parameter agn classification based on silicate strength",
    "is described below .",
    "the infrared classification and luminosity parameters which we utilize are illustrated in figure 1 .",
    "the classification is a measure of the height or depth of the silicate feature measured at 10 .",
    "as illustrated in figure 1 , this measure of silicate strength assumes an extrapolated dust continuum between 7.8 and 13 , and the silicate feature is measured relative to this continuum .",
    "the strength of the silicate feature is defined as @xmath16(10 observed)/@xmath16(10 continuum ) , for @xmath16(10 continuum ) extrapolated linearly between @xmath16(7.8 ) and @xmath16(13 ) , as shown .",
    "this parameter is designed primarily to allow estimation of silicate absorption in dogs at z @xmath14 2 , for which irs spectra have limited wavelength coverage and poor signal to noise ( s / n ) .",
    "various alternatives for measuring silicate strength when longer , reliable continuum baselines can be used are discussed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "our measurement is similar to one of the continuum fits they illustrate , except that we do not express the silicate strength as an optical depth , and we always measure at a single wavelength instead of seeking the wavelength where the feature is strongest .",
    "the observed mid - infrared luminosity is determined as @xmath2(7.8 ) ( rest frame ) .",
    "this luminosity parameter is chosen because it is the most reliable flux measurement for dusty sources , especially faint sources at z @xmath14 2 with irs spectra ( summarized by @xcite ) , because this wavelength is a localized continuum maximum between absorptions on either side for heavily obscured sources ( as seen in figure 1 ) .",
    "this luminosity parameter is especially important for highly obscured , optically faint dogs when optical spectra can not be obtained . for silicate emission sources , such as",
    "optically discovered quasars , measuring @xmath2(7.8 ) allows an unambiguous luminosity comparison with the obscured sources .",
    "the greatest uncertainties in measuring @xmath2(7.8 ) or the silicate strength in this way arise when pah features from a starburst are present , because the flux density at 7.8 is not then a purely continuum measurement but also includes the peak of the 7.7 pah feature . for this reason",
    ", we do not measure silicate strength or @xmath2(7.8 ) for any source with ew(6.2 pah ) @xmath12 0.05 , as discussed below in section 2.2 . as can be seen by examining individual spectra in cassis , uncertainties in the measure of silicate strength",
    "are all in the direction that silicate emission would be underestimated and silicate absorption overestimated .",
    "this is partly because any pah contribution would artificially raise the assumed continuum at 7.8 and partly because the peak of silicate emission moves to wavelengths longer than 10 for sources with strong silicate emission .",
    "the infrared agn classification derived from silicate strength is now demonstrated for a uniform and independent agn sample using comparisons between cassis infrared spectra and characteristics of the uniform sample of agn defined by hard x - rays ( 14 - 195 kev ) from the @xmath1 bat all sky survey @xcite . as those authors explain , this is an unbiased agn sample discovered without regard to optical classification , using only the presence of hard x - rays .",
    "consequently , it is an excellent sample for objective tests of the infrared classification criteria . of the 234 sources listed in the bat sample having `` sy '' or `` quasar '' optical classifications ( table 5 of tueller et al . )",
    ", 125 have irs spectra in cassis .",
    "results for these agn are summarized in table 1 .",

    "of the 125 agn with irs spectra , only 12 have ew(6.2 ) @xmath12 0.1 .",
    "these exceptions are explainable as sources for which the agn continuum luminosity is weak in the infrared compared to the luminosity from a circumnuclear starburst .",
    "figure 2 shows the silicate absorption or emission strength from cassis spectra compared to optical agn classification for @xmath1 bat agn in table 1 , using the optical classifications given in @xcite .",
    "( as explained in section 2.1 , no silicate strength is given for the 20 sources with ew(6.2 ) @xmath12 0.05 to avoid possible contamination of the 7.8 continuum by 7.7 pah emission . ) the overall consistency between infrared and optical classifications is clearly demonstrated in figure 2 . as expected , the sources with silicate absorption are predominately type 2 and those with silicate emission predominately type 1",
    ".    there are ambiguous sources and a wide range of silicate strength at a given optical classification .",
    "this is not surprising given that the broad optical emission lines that classify type 1 can sometimes be seen via scattering from intervening dust .",
    "in fact , the observation of this scattering in polarized light led to the initial `` unified theory '' @xcite .",
    "an important example of an ambiguous classification is the well studied ulirg markarian 231 .",
    "this object has silicate absorption of strength 0.5 in the infrared and extensive multiwavelength evidence of heavy absorption @xcite but is optically a type 1 agn .",
    "such ambiguities are a primary motive for classification based only on the silicate strength , which provides a quantitative measure of the presence or absence of intervening dust between observer and agn .",
    "for example , the dust covering factor can be estimated by the fraction of agn seen with silicate absorption . within the bat agn sample ,",
    "the fraction of sources with measured absorption ( silicate strength less than 1 among those with measured strength in table 1 ) is 58/105 , or 55% .",
    "this implies that of all agn , 55% are observed through dust clouds .",
    "this could arise from various configurations .",
    "a uniform dusty torus might cover 55% of the solid angle around the agn , or individual clouds in a spherical configuration could cover 55% . for our purposes , the numerical value of the covering factor is the important result because that is a measure of the fraction of @xmath10 for agn which is absorbed and reradiated as @xmath8 .",
    "bat agn having @xmath0 irs spectra and optical classifications in @xcite .",
    "strength of the silicate feature is defined in figure 1 and listed in table 1 .",
    "values @xmath12 1 correspond to silicate emission and values @xmath7 1 to silicate absorption .",
    "sources having optical classes 1.0 or 2.0 and silicate strength 1.0 are artificially displaced slightly in optical class to avoid overlapping symbols . ]",
    "the primary result we desire from studying irs spectra of the bat sample is to calibrate how well the mid - infrared continuum luminosity @xmath2(7.8 ) is a measure of total agn luminosity for agn of all classifications , because we use this mid - infrared luminosity parameter for the high redshift dogs and other dusty quasars .",
    "we also will compare to the emission line luminosity of the mid - infrared [ oiv ] 25.89 emission line , because of previous conclusions that this line is an indicator of intrinsic agn luminosity @xcite .",
    "the comparisons between infrared emission lines and bat x - ray properties by @xcite used 79 sources with irs high resolution spectra .",
    "this sample is enlarged if we use the 125 sources in table 1 with low resolution spectra .",
    "the [ oiv ] line is strong enough to measure in most of these low resolution spectra , but the lower contrast of emission lines in low resolution spectra means the measurement of line fluxes is more uncertain because of continuum noise . to use these measurements ,",
    "we need an estimate of the line flux uncertainty .",
    "this is estimated by comparing the cassis low resolution measures with the high resolution measures for the objects in common . to extend these comparisons",

    "]     1 correspond to silicate emission and values @xmath7 1 to silicate absorption . ]",
    "the emission line measurements from irs high resolution and low resolution spectra are independent .",
    "the high resolution fitting and measurements in @xcite are based on calibrations for the high resolution spectra provided by data products from the @xmath0 science center .",
    "the cassis low resolution results derive from independent calibration in the cassis process @xcite and from gaussian line fits done with the smart analyis package @xcite .",
    "comparisons of low resolution and high resolution line fluxes are shown in figure 3 . the median and dispersion log [ flux(high)/flux(low ) ] = -0.02 @xmath4 0.10 .",
    "the small systematic offset can be caused by small sample size , by differences in line fitting techniques , or by calibration differences ; the total systematic difference of @xmath15 5% is an upper limit to calibration differences .",
    "the dispersion in the results gives the random measurement uncertainty of @xmath15 25% .",
    "we can not determine from figure 3 how much of the random uncertainty is attributed to the low resolution lines and how much to the high resolution , but we assume this dispersion to be a measure of the uncertainty only in low resolution fluxes because low resolution lines are more affected by localized continuum noise .",
    "therefore , the dex @xmath4 0.10 dispersion of the ratio is taken as the uncertainty for the [ oiv ] line fluxes when compared to x - ray fluxes in figure 4",
    ".    three measures of agn flux given in table 1 are compared in figure 4 : 1 .",

    "are equivalent when luminosities are compared at the same rest frame wavelengths as the observed fluxes , so we can discuss correlations using either flux ratios or luminosity ratios .",
    "the 20 bat agn in table 1 with ew(6.2 pah ) @xmath12 0.05 are not used in these comparisons to avoid possible contamination of the continuum @xmath16(7.8 ) by the 7.7 pah feature .",
    "medians and dispersions are log [ @xmath20(7.8 ) /@xmath21(x ) ] = -0.31 @xmath4 0.35 and log [ @xmath21([oiv ] 25.89 ) /@xmath21(x ) ] = -2.64 @xmath4 0.6 .",
    "these dispersions quantitatively demonstrate that the @xmath20(7.8 ) scales more closely with @xmath21(x ) than does [ oiv ] emission , and the dispersion compared to @xmath21(x ) provides our most unbiased calibration yet available of the precision with which the mid - infrared continuum tracks the primary luminosity from the agn",
    ".    the measured dispersion of @xmath4 0.35 in dex means that the mid - infrared flux ( or luminosity ) predicts the hard x - ray flux ( or luminosity ) to a one sigma precision of about a factor of 2 .",
    "this is a cosmic dispersion illustrating differences from source to source in the various physical characteristics that affect this ratio .",
    "differences can arise from many effects including differences in covering factors and temperatures for the absorbing dust , and differences in the spectral energy distribution of the primary luminosity such that the luminosity at wavelengths absorbed by the dust differs in proportion to the hard x - ray luminosity .",
    "because of the many factors that can enter the ratio @xmath20(7.8 ) /@xmath21(x ) and the wide wavelength difference between these two observational measures , the resulting correlation illustrates ( to us ) surprising consistency among agn .",
    "the next question is whether the mid - infrared continuum luminosity represents the intrinsic luminosity regardless of agn orientation and any extinction imposed by the accident of the observer s line of sight .",
    "this is tested in figure 5 , by considering the ratio of mid - infrared flux ( or luminosity ) to x - ray flux ( or luminosity ) for bat agn when compared to the strength of silicate absorption or emission .",
    "the silicate strength is a measure of whether the agn is observed through dust , as discussed in section 2.1 .",
    "this figure shows no trend for the ratio log [ @xmath20(7.8 ) /@xmath21(x ) ] to depend on silicate strength ; the median ratio for emission sources ( strength @xmath22 1 ) is -0.35 and for absorption sources ( strength @xmath7 1 ) is -0.3 .",
    "this result implies the important conclusion that the mid - infrared luminosity can be used equally well as a measure of intrinsic agn luminosity regardless of agn orientation and the resulting classification .",
    "the preceding sections establish the reliability of the luminosity measure @xmath2(7.8 ) for agn of any classification , so that agn ( or quasars ) can be uniformly compared in luminosity regardless of the extinction effects that may seriously affect rest frame optical and ultraviolet measurements . in this section ,",
    "we compare this measure of infrared luminosity to other measures of bolometric luminosity for a local agn sample and for the most infrared - luminous quasars now known .",
    "we also compare to the most fundamental physical parameter for agn , which is the mass of the accreting supermassive black holes .",
    "these comparisons illustrate the differences and dispersions between very different methods of measuring luminosity .",
    "long term variability studies of agn combined with observed velocity dispersions in the broad line region ( blr ) led to the `` reverberation mapping '' technique for measuring the virial masses of black holes in type 1 agn @xcite .",
    "the primary set of reverberation mapped agn contains 35 sources with black hole masses , of which 32 have cassis spectra .",
    "these are summarized in table 2 and are the local agn sample for which we compare @xmath2(7.8 ) to black hole masses and @xmath10 .    because reverberation mapping works only if the blr is observable , these local agn are of necessity type 1 . to extend these comparisons to the most luminous type 1",
    "sources known , we also summarize the most infrared - luminous type 1 quasars .",
    "these arise from the wide area sdss survey combined with infrared photometry from wise . finally , the most luminous type 1 quasars are compared to the infrared luminosities of the heavily obscured quasars among the dogs discovered spectroscopically by @xmath0 and among those estimated photometrically from wise .",

    "one quasar is overluminous by a factor of 1000 compared to the local agn relation between bhm and mid - infrared luminosity !",
    "the median values in bhm and luminosity for the quasars show infrared luminosities about a factor of 10 larger than would be expected from the virial black hole mass ( or , conversely , a bhm underestimated by a factor of 10 compared to the luminosity ) .",
    "although this difference is large , it is only about a 2@xmath24 effect compared to the uncertainties in the virial mass determinations @xcite .",
    "there are various reasons that can explain this lack of fit for luminous quasars compared to local agn .",

    "favors the type 1 sources with the most extreme hot dust emission .",
    "this extreme could arise for a combination of reasons involving the geometry of the dust , including hotter dust because the dust is closer to the agn or more dust emission because the dust covering factor is greater .",
    "these possibilities are considered further in the next section .",
    "the primary bolometric luminosity @xmath10 arising from the agn is the fundamental luminosity measurement that is ultimately needed . in the absence of extinction",
    ", this @xmath10 can be scaled from rest frame optical or ultraviolet observations using multiwavelength templates , and such measurements are the primary sources of @xmath10 @xcite . to understand the uncertainties of such estimates for @xmath10 , we compare to the independent measures of infrared luminosity .",
    "the objective in using an infrared luminosity measure is to achieve an independent measurement of total luminosity that avoids template assumptions and is not sensitive to extinction effects , so that all agn and quasars can be uniformly compared without concerns about classification or orientation .",
    "the simple explanation assumed for the total infrared luminosity @xmath8 is that primary radiation at optical through soft x - ray wavelengths has been absorbed by dust and then reradiated from the heated dust as @xmath8 via the dust continuum emission .",
    "if all of the emitting dust is optically thick to the shorter wavelength primary radiation , then the total infrared luminosity emitted must equal the total primary luminosity absorbed . if the dust covering factor is large , therefore , @xmath8",
    "@xmath15 @xmath10 .",
    "the total infrared luminosity @xmath8 is the integrated luminosity from 5 to 1000 as defined by @xcite using infrared fluxes in the photometric bands of the infrared astronomical satellite ( iras ) .",
    "the @xmath8 have been empirically scaled to @xmath2(7.8 ) by @xcite using type 1 agn having measures of both @xmath8 from iras and @xmath2(7.8 ) from irs spectra ; the scaling is log [ @xmath8/@xmath2(7.8 ) ] = 0.51 @xmath4 0.21 .",

    "the references cited review the large uncertainties in @xmath10 , especially because no extinction corrections are made to the optical or ultraviolet fluxes to obtain @xmath10 . our goal is only to illustrate an overall comparison of systematic differences between the independent observational measures @xmath8 and @xmath10 , so we do not examine this comparison for individual sources .    the comparisons of @xmath8 and @xmath10 are shown in figure 8 . for the agn sample ( crosses in figure 8) , the median log @xmath8/@xmath10 = -0.35 .",
    "this is the systematic difference that arises when using these two independent measures of total luminosity .",
    "if the optically determined @xmath10 are not affected by extinction , i.e. the observed optical luminosity at rest frame 0.51 for type 1 agn shines past dust clouds with no interruption , then the ratio @xmath8/@xmath10 is also a measure of the fraction of primary radiation intercepted by dust clouds in directions outside the observer s line of sight .",
    "this ratio is equivalent to the covering factor for the dust clouds , corresponding to 45% with this value of the median .",
    "this value of 45% is similar to the 55% dust covering factor for bat agn determined by silicate absorption in the irs spectra , discussed in section 2.3 .     in erg s@xmath5 to total bolometric luminosity @xmath10",

    "the ratio @xmath8/@xmath10 for the most infrared - luminous sdss / wise quasars ( table 3 and circles in figure 8) has a median of log @xmath8/@xmath10 = 0.1 , indicating that the optically - derived and infrared - derived measures of total luminosity are nearly the same systematically .",
    "this implies a nearly 100% dust covering factor , which can be explained for these type 1 quasars only if the measured @xmath10 derives from ultraviolet luminosity that just happens to be observed without extinction through small holes between dust clouds .",
    "the ratio extends to values of log @xmath8/@xmath10 @xmath15 2 , however , indicating that for some type 1 quasars , the infrared measures can give much larger total luminosities than the @xmath10 measures derived from rest frame ultraviolet luminosity .",
    "if log @xmath8/@xmath10 @xmath12 0 , the simple equating of @xmath8/@xmath10 to a dust covering factor can not apply ; this ratio can not exceed unity when all primary radiation is absorbed and the covering factor is 100% . cases with @xmath8 @xmath12 @xmath10 would anyway be nonsensical within our assumptions , because no rest frame optical or ultraviolet radiation could be observed from which to derive an @xmath10 if optically thick dust covers 100% of the source .",
    "extreme values of @xmath8 @xmath12 @xmath10 can be qualitatively explained in part by selection effects that arise from choosing only those type 1 quasars which are most luminous in the mid - infrared .",
    "there is a one sigma dispersion of @xmath4 0.2 in the ratio log @xmath8/@xmath2(7.8 ) calibrated empirically by @xcite .",
    "furthermore , section 2.3 showed a dispersion in log of @xmath4 0.35 for the ratio of hard x - ray flux to mid - infrared @xmath20(7.8 ) .",
    "these two factors reflect the cosmic dispersion in dust temperature and/or intrinsic spectral energy distributions that affect the fundamental relation between @xmath8 and the intrinsic bolometric luminosity of the agn",

    "variability in the ultraviolet luminosity that is used to measure @xmath10 could also explain some unusual ratios because the @xmath8 arising from dust reradiation should not be variable .    furthermore , those quasars with the largest dust covering factors would also be those most likely to have some dust extinction affecting the rest frame ultraviolet that leads to @xmath10 . measuring @xmath10 too small because the ultraviolet is not corrected for extinction would also lead to erroneously large values of @xmath8/@xmath10 , and this effect is the most straightforward explanation for sources with large values of @xmath8/@xmath10 .    the most important conclusion from figure 8",
    "is that infrared measures can give substantially larger values of total luminosity than do @xmath10 measures derived from rest - frame ultraviolet luminosities , even for type 1 quasars .",
    "this means that infrared measures are essential to derive total luminosities not only for the very dusty , optically obscured dogs , but also for the most luminous optically discovered quasars .",
