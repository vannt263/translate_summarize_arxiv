    "the lack of structural symmetry in a two dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) has attracted lots of attention of condensed matter physicists due to the possible remarkable future applications as proposed by datta and das@xcite .",
    "various experiments have confirmed the existence of a spin - orbit coupling known as rashba spin - orbit coupling ( rsoc ) in a 2deg with structural inverse asymmetry@xcite .",
    "the rsoc lifts the spin degeneracy of electron even in absence of any magnetic field and provide a nice way to manipulate electron s spin degree of freedom .",
    "moreover , the rsoc is responsible for some noble effects like spin - fet@xcite , metal - insulator transition in a two - dimensional hole gas@xcite , spin - resolved ballistic transport@xcite and spin - galvanic effect@xcite .",
    "the experimental confirmation of the enhancement of rsoc strength up to a significant amount by the application of the gate voltage has made this field much more attractive@xcite .",
    "+ the rsoc produces two different energy branches for spin - up and spin - down electrons @xcite and manifests itself through transport@xcite , magnetic@xcite and optical properties @xcite . the spin hall effect ( she)@xcite is one of the most unique property exhibits by 2deg with rsoc .",
    "the she has been studied extensively theoretically after the experimental detection of the spin accumulation on opposite sides of the sample with opposite polarization@xcite .",
    "+ in presence of magnetic field , an additional degeneracy comes into picture when landau levels of two opposite branches overlap for a certain magnetic field .",
    "this degeneracy is the outcome of the competition between zeeman splitting and rashba splitting .",
    "this additional degeneracy manifests through a jump in the spin polarization and the resonance in shc@xcite .",
    "+ later , the effect of disorder in the spin hall resonance has been studied theoretically and showed the appearance of double peaks around the resonance field instead of single peak at the resonance point@xcite .",
    "the splitting of single peak into double is the effect of the disorder induced landau levels broadening . + the disorder is not the only sole way to broaden the width of landau levels .",
    "the landau levels can be broadened by applying a weak electric or magnetic modulation@xcite .",
    "the width of the landau levels due to the modulation is periodic with inverse magnetic field whereas the disorder induced broadening is magnetic field independent .",
    "this kind of modulation induced oscillatory broadening of landau levels results in oscillatory diffusive conductivity in inverse magnetic field , which is known as weiss oscillation@xcite .",
    "moreover , the modulation effect on the spin hall conductivity has been studied theoretically also and shows the weiss type oscillation accompanied by beating in shc at low magnetic field@xcite . in this paper ,",
    "our major aim is to study the effect of modulated landau levels in spin hall resonance .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we summarize the exact energy eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenfunctions of a 2deg with the rashba soi in presence of a perpendicular uniform magnetic field .",

    "for the numerical calculation , we use the following parameters : electron effective mass @xmath67 with @xmath68 as the free electron mass , rsoc strength @xmath69 with @xmath70 ev - m and the carrier concentration @xmath71 .",

    "the resonance point now shows a minimum in conductivity and maintains it for a wide range of magnetic field .",
    "the gap between two new peaks which appears on both sides of the resonance field are modulation period dependent .",
    "the gap is increasing with increasing modulation period .",
    "note that two new peaks are not confined within the central peak which was observed in the disorder induced landau broadening case@xcite .",
    "another point is that the intensity of the two new peaks are decreasing with the increase of the modulation period which can be explained from the expression of energy correction as follows : @xmath75 i.e ; the increasing modulation period enhances the effective modulation strength .     for short range modulation period .",
    ", width=370 ]    in fig.2 , we plot the same but for shorter range of modulation periods .",
    "this shows the disappearing of double peaks with decreasing the modulation periods .",

    "the flat band between two weak peaks also increases with the increase of the modulation strength .",

    "the level width can be tuned by changing @xmath41 .",
    "this width modulation can not be captured in the small range of magnetic field which is actually taken here around the resonance point .",
    "the changing periods results itself only through the suppressing or enhancing the intensity of the double peaks and by widening or shortening the gap between these peaks .",
    "we study the effect of modulation induced landau levels broadening in spin hall resonance . we find that this level broadening suppress the resonance shc and splits the central resonance peak into double peaks but relatively weak in strength .",
    "the separation between two new peaks can be controlled by the modulation period i.e ; the gap increases with increasing modulation period .",

    "a wide flat band is observed between two peaks in our case whereas in disorder induced level broadening there is a narrow region between two peaks .",
