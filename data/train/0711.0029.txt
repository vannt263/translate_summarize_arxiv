    "the recent experimental discovery of bose - mott insulating phases in optical lattices has generated an explosion of research in the ultra - cold atom community ( see  @xcite for a recent review ) , and has helped to merge two major branches of physics : atomic - molecular - optical and condensed matter physics .",
    "most experiments thus far have relied on measuring the momentum distribution of the atoms after switching off the trap confining the atoms to infer the existence of a superfluid to insulator transition  @xcite . however , very recently , two experimental groups  @xcite have used spatially selective microwave spectroscopy to probe _ in situ _ the superfluid - to - insulator transition of @xmath0rb in a three dimensional ( 3d ) optical lattice with a harmonic envelope . in these experiments , the shell structure of the bose - mott insulating states",
    "was revealed for very deep lattices .",
    "regions of filling fraction @xmath1 through @xmath2 ( @xmath1 through @xmath3 ) were mapped in the mit  @xcite ( mainz  @xcite ) experiment . their observations in three - dimensional optical lattices lead to the confirmation of the mott - insulating shell structure consisting of `` mott plateaus '' with abrupt transitions between any two sucessive shells as proposed in two dimensional ( 2d )  @xcite optical lattices .",
    "one of the next frontiers for ultra - cold bosons in optical lattices is the search for superfluid regions separating mott - insulating shells .",
    "eventhough the mott shell structure was determined recently using microwave spectroscopy  @xcite , any evidence of superfluid shells has remained elusive .",
    "thus , in anticipation of the next experimental breakthrough , we study 2d and 3d optical lattices of atomic or molecular bosons in harmonically confining potentials , and show that between the mott regions of filling fraction @xmath4 and @xmath5 , superfluid shells emerge as a result of fluctuations due to finite hopping , and extend our previous work on this topic  @xcite .",
    "this finite hopping breaks the local energy degeneracy of neighboring mott - shells , determines the size of the superfluid regions and is responsible for the low energy ( sound ) and vortex excitations .",
    "in addition , we find that the order parameter equation is not in general of the gross - pitaeviskii type . furthermore ,",
    "in 3d optical lattices , when superfluid regions are thin ( nearly 2d ) spherical or ellipsoidal shells , we obtain bound vortex - antivortex excitations below the berezinski - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) transition temperature  @xcite which is different for each superfluid region . finally , we propose the use of laguerre - gaussian and bragg spectroscopy techniques for the detection of superfluid shells .    the remainder of the manuscript is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "sec : shell - structure ] , we analyze the emergence of an alternating superfluid and mott shell structure , comparing two different approaches involving non - degenerate and nearly degenerate perturbation theory .",
    "we also obtain the order parameter equation , the characteristic sizes of the superfluid and mott regions , the local filling fraction and the local compressibility .",
    "we find that the superfluid order parameter that emerges between two mott shells is not of the gross - pitaeviskii type , except very close to the insulating boundaries . in sec .",

    "sec : conclusions ] .",
    "to describe the physics of alternating insulating and superfluid shells of atomic or molecular bosons in optical lattices , we use the lattice bose - hubbard hamiltonian with a harmonic potential described by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the local chemical potential , @xmath8 is the harmonically confining potential , @xmath9 is the lattice spacing , and @xmath10 is the creation operator for a boson at site @xmath11 . here , the vector @xmath12 , and the distance @xmath13 . the anisotropic confining potential @xmath14 becomes isotropic when @xmath15 .",

    "[ eqn : bose - hubbard - hamiltonian ] is restricted to nearest neighbors .",
    "the harmonic trap makes the system inhomogenous and introduces interesting properties which are absent in homogenous bose - hubbard systems  @xcite . for the inhomogeneous systems , it is useful to define a local chemical potential @xmath18 which plays an essential role in the emergence of shell structures .    .    for bosons in a homogeneous optical lattice",
    ", the bose - hubbard model without the harmonic confining potential can be used . in this case",
    ", it is well known that an integer number of particles on each site or @xmath19 describes an insulating state for sufficiently large @xmath17 ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "this is because the on - site interaction @xmath17 makes it energetically unfavorable for a particle to move from one site to another .",
    "in this situation the system is in what is known as the mott insulator phase @xcite .",
    "however , for non - integer number of particle , the extra bosons can move more easily , at a small energy cost , because its interaction energy is essentially the same on every site .",
    "for this reason , a system with non - integer number of bosons on each site is a superfluid at zero temperature @xcite .",
    "recently , several mott - insulator shells of bosons were detected in optical lattices  @xcite , which are inevitably inhomogenous , and thus require a model that includes the effects of the harmonic part of the confining potential .",
    "this can be modeled by the inhomogenous bose - hubbard hamiltonian described in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : bose - hubbard - hamiltonian ] ) . in this case",
    ", one can either be in a regime where the entire system is superfluid or in a regime where the system exhibits a shell structure of alternating mott - insulator and superfluid regions .",
    "the existence of this shell structure has been shown numerically  @xcite , but the lack of analytical progress has hindered a true understanding of the emergence and properties of these shells .",
    "a simple argument for the emergence of the shell structure can be made by inspection of the standard phase diagram of the homogenous bose - hubbard model shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : one ] upon the substitution of @xmath21 . in an inhomogenous system",
    ", the effective local chemical potential @xmath22 is spatially varying .",
    "thus , in the regions where the number density @xmath23 is not an integer , a superfluid shell emerges , and in the regions where @xmath23 is an integer , a mott - insulator shell appears .",
    "eventhough , a simple argument for the existence of the shell structure can be made , many questions need to be seriously addressed . for instance , what are the characteristic order parameter , dimensions and excitations of each superfluid shell ?",
    "thus , we begin our presentation by discussing next the emergence of the mott - insulator and superfluid shell structure .",
    "a standard approach to analyse such bosonic systems is to use the bogoliubov mean field approximation .",
    "however , as shown in  @xcite , this approximation fails to predict the expected phase transition since it treats the interactions only approximately .",
    "hence , instead of using the bogoliubov approximation , we generalize a method found in the literature  @xcite , by introducing a local mean field theory that treats the interactions exactly and approximates the kinetic energy of the atoms in the optical lattice .",
    "we introduce the local superfluid order parameter @xmath24 .",
    "we can now construct a consistent local mean field theory by susbstituting the operator @xmath25 , leading to an effective local hamiltonian @xmath26 which is diagonal in the site index @xmath11 with @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the number operator . for @xmath29 , the shell structure for mott - insulating phases",
    "is revealed by fixing @xmath30 , to obtain the local energy @xmath31 when @xmath32 . since @xmath33 , the change from a mott shell with filling fraction @xmath4 to @xmath34 occurs at the degeneracy condition @xmath35 , which for a spherically symmetric potential happens at the radius @xmath36 where @xmath37 .",

    "we show how the hopping term in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : bose - hubbard - local ] ) affects the ground state energy of the system .",
    "qualitatively one can see that the kinetic energy controlled by @xmath16 lifts the degeneracy of the system at @xmath35 and in the process introduces a superfluid order parameter in a region of finite width depending on parameters @xmath41 and @xmath17 .    to obtain analytical insight into the emergence of superfluid shells ,",
    "we make first a continuum approximation through the taylor expansion @xmath42 where repeated indices indicate summation .",
    "this should be true in the limit where the order parameter is smoothly varying at a length scale much greater than the unit lattice spacing @xmath9 . under this approximation",
    "the effective local hamiltonian becomes    @xmath43    where @xmath44 reflects the amplitude for the creation of a single boson excitation at position @xmath11 , while the last term @xmath45\\ ] ] reflects the local mean - field energy shift . here",
    "@xmath46 is the number of nearest - neighbor sites ( coordination number ) depending on the lattice dimension @xmath47 . within this approximation ,",
    "a simple analytical treatment of the emergence of superfluid shells is possible , as discussed next .",

    "any contribution of other states to the local energy will be of the order of @xmath50 .",
    "the hopping term in eq .  ( [ eqn : bose - hubbard - local ] ) affects the ground state energy of the system by removing the local degeneracy of @xmath51 and @xmath52 at @xmath53 . to illustrate this point",

    "first , it changes the local energies @xmath58 and @xmath59 of the mott shells @xmath4 and @xmath5 through @xmath56 .",
    "second , it mixes the two mott regions through the off - diagonal term @xmath60 and its hermitian conjugate .",
    "thus , the physics near the boundary between the @xmath4 and @xmath5 mott regions is described by an effective local two - level system with diagonal ( @xmath56 ) and off - diagonal ( @xmath60 ) perturbations .",

    "the order parameter equation ( ope ) is determined by minimization of @xmath71 with respect to @xmath72 leading to @xmath73 notice that the ope is not of the gross - pitaeviskii ( gp ) type , since the superfluid regions emerge from local fluctuations between neighboring mott shells .",
    "the zeroth order solution of this equation with @xmath74 leads to the spatially dependent order parameter @xmath75 since @xmath76 , it implies that @xmath77 in the superfluid region .",
    "thus the inner radius @xmath78 and the outer radius @xmath79 of the superfluid shell between the @xmath4 and @xmath34 mott regions is obtained by setting @xmath80 leading to @xmath81 for a spherically symmetric harmonic potential @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is defined above .",
    "our notation to describe the mott - superfluid boundaries is illustrated in fig .",

    "it is very important to emphasize that in the superfluid regions the order parameter @xmath101 is not identical to @xmath95 since the ope equation is not of the gross - pitaeviskii type . while the order parameter @xmath102 vanishes at the boundaries @xmath97 between the superfluid and mott shells , and",

    "eventhough the use of tomographic microwave techniques has allowed the detection of several mott regions  @xcite , it has been quite challenging to detect superfluid shells . in this section ,",
    "we propose a possible experiment for the detection of superfluid shells through the use of gauss - laguerre and gaussian beams followed by bragg spectroscopy .",
    "the idea is that gauss - laguerre and gaussian beams can tranfer angular momentum to the atoms in superfluid phase without transfering linear momentum , and that bragg spectroscopy can detect their existence since the technique is only sensitive to the velocity of the atoms in the superfluid phase .",
    "this is because the mott insulator regions do not absorb the angular momentum because of the presence of a large gap in the excitation spectrum .",
    "next , when the frequencies of the beams used in bragg spectroscopy are correctly chosen some of the rotating atoms in the superfluid regions acquire extra momentum and are kicked out of their shells and can be imaged .",
    "the gauss - laguerre technique has been sucessfully used to rotate superfluid sodium atoms @xmath265na in a _",
    "_ potential  @xcite .",
    "the technique used was a two step process , where initially a gauss - laguerre beam transfered both linear and angular momentum to atoms , and a second gaussian beam canceled the linear momentum transfer leaving each trapped atom with exactly one unit of angular momentum . in this manner ,",
    "the atoms participating in superfluidity rotate without dissipation , and when the trap is released , the superfluid region expands , but does not fill the center of the cloud , thus maintaining a toroidal structure throughout the time of flight . furthermore , bragg spectroscopy was used to detect the sense of rotation of vortices within a vortex lattice of sodium bec  @xcite and to observe the persistent flow of bose - condensed sodium atoms in toroidal traps  @xcite .    the gauss - laguerre technique and bragg spectroscopy may also be used to detect superfluid shells of bosons in harmonically confined optical lattices . however , the situation here is slightly different because of the existence of mott shells and multiple superfluid regions . to illustrate this we discuss the simpler case of a nearly two - dimensional configuration , where the harmonic trap is very tight along the z - direction and loose along the x- and y- directions and only two superfluid shells are present . upon application of the gauss - laguerre technique along the z- direction ,",
    "angular momentum transfer occurs essentially to the atoms in the superfluid phase , imposing a rotating superfluid current with a well defined superfluid velocity profile , while the mott regions remain unchanged due to their large gap in the excitation spectrum .",
    "the angular momentum transfer is chosen to occur along the z direction generating the superfluid currents in the x - y plane , and the amount of angular momentum transfer is assumed to be @xmath266 for each atom that absorbed a gauss - laguerre photon with @xmath267 .",
    "next we use bragg spectroscopy with counter - propagating beams along the x - direction to detect the sense of rotation and determine the regions of superfluid rings with well defined velocities .",
    "if there is sufficient optical resolution and signal - to - noise ratio , then the experiment may be performed _ in situ _ , otherwise the bragg spectroscopic measurements can be performed in time - of - flight .",
    "[ htb ]    a schematic plot of the detection of superfluid shells using bragg spectroscopy can be found in fig .",
    "[ fig : brag ] , which shows two superfluid shells rotating counter - clockwise and two counter propagating beams applied along the x direction . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : brag ] the right(left)-going beam has frequency @xmath182(@xmath268 ) and linear momentum @xmath269(@xmath270 ) .",

    ", we retain @xmath266 , instead of setting @xmath116 . applying momentum conservation",
    ", we can easily obtain that the final linear momentum of the atoms in the superfluid region is @xmath273 , in terms of the initial linear momentum of the photons @xmath274 and -@xmath275 .",
    "thus , the bragg beams transfer a net linear momentum @xmath276 to the atoms which satisfies the energy conservation condition @xmath277 in the equation above @xmath278 is the component of the velocity @xmath279 along the x direction . notice that @xmath278 can also be written as @xmath280 where @xmath281 is the angle between the bragg beams and the velocity @xmath282 of the atoms in the superfluid shell and @xmath283 is the magnitude of @xmath282 .",
    "for an atom carrying one unit of angular momentum , the superfluid velocity is @xmath284 .",
    "therefore , within a superfluid shell at position @xmath285 atoms get a linear momentum kick of @xmath286 when the velocity @xmath287 satisfies the condition given in eq .",
    "[ eq : bragg ] .",
    "this leads to two bragg angles @xmath288 , and @xmath289 for each superfluid shell . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : brag ] the bragg angles are @xmath290 and @xmath291 for the outer superfluid shell labelled by @xmath292 , and are @xmath293 and @xmath294 for the inner superfluid shell labelled by @xmath295 .",
    "the regions with same velocity @xmath278 are identified by the condition @xmath296 .",
    "once these atoms are kicked out of their respective superfluid shells , they form two small cloud , which can be detected by direct imaging . as mentioned before , if there is sufficient optical resolution and signal - to - noise ratio , then the experiment may be performed _ in situ _ , otherwise the bragg spectroscopic measurements can be performed in time - of - flight .",
    "in fact these clouds also carry the information of the sense of rotation of the superfluid shells and their velocity profile , and one can in principal extract that information from the images .",
    "having discussed our proposal for the experimental detection of superfluid shells in harmonically confined optical lattices , we present next our conclusions .",
    "we studied 2d and 3d optical lattices of atomic or molecular bosons in harmonically confining potentials , and showed that between the mott regions of filling fraction @xmath4 and @xmath5 , superfluid shells emerge as a result of fluctuations due to finite hopping .",
    "we found that the presence of finite hopping breaks the local energy degeneracy of neighboring mott - shells , determines the size of the superfluid regions as shown in fig  [ fig:1 ] , and is responsible for low energy ( sound ) and vortex excitations .",
    "in addition , we obtained an order parameter equation which is not in general of the gross - pitaeviskii type , except near the boundaries separating the superfluid from the insulating regions .",
    "furthermore , we obtained bound vortex - antivortex solutions ( as shown in fig  [ fig:3 ] below the berezinski - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) transition when superfluid regions are thin ( nearly 2d ) spherical ( or ellipsoidal ) shells .",
    "finally , we discussed that the emergence of these superfluid regions should be detectable using a combination of gauss - laguerre and bragg spectroscopy techniques .",
