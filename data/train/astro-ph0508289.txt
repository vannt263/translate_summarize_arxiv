    "it is now clear that some x - ray sources in external galaxies are brighter than those seen in our galaxy , thus providing a strong scientific motivation for high spatial resolution x - ray studies .",
    "off - nuclear sources in nearby galaxies with luminosities exceeding 10@xmath3 ergss@xmath2  have been designated ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) .",
    "the nature of ulxs , in particular whether they are powered by intermediate - mass black holes ( imbh , m@xmath4100 m@xmath0 ) that are distinct from stellar - mass and supermassive black holes , has become a hotly debated issue @xcite .",
    "if their x - ray emissions are isotropic and sub - eddington , the compact objects in ulxs must be at least 7 solar masses ( 7m@xmath0 ) .",
    "our object of study here is cxokm101  j140332.74 + 542102 ( hereafter m101",

    "observations @xcite .",
    "@xcite have discovered an optical counterpart of m101  ulx-1 , with brightness and colors consistent with those of a b supergiant in m101 , hence it is almost certainly a high - mass x - ray binary ( hmxb ) .",
    "also throughout 2004 , we carried out a series of _ chandra _  observations totaling a million seconds of exposure time ( hereafter `` msec '' ) for a comprehensive x - ray study of m101 , including monitoring of bright individual sources .",
    "@xcite have analyzed a subset of these data and claim that m101  ulx-1  reached a peak 0.37 kev luminosity of 3@xmath5 ergss@xmath2  in july 2004 , a claim which we reexamine in  3.3 , after considering the long - term and short - term variability in  3.1 and  3.2 , respectively .",
    "we then reassess the nature of m101  ulx-1  in  4 .",
    "the msec data set , as well as our reduction method , will be described fully in @xcite . in addition , we have analyzed all archival _ rosat _ , _ chandra _ , and _ xmm - newton _  observations of m101 to establish the long - term history of m101  ulx-1 .",
    "here we present our detailed analysis of the high state _",
    "chandra _  and _ xmm - newton _  data .",
    "the relevant datasets are summarized in table[hsdata ] .",
    "we do not analyze the low state data in detail ; any effort to analyze them ( e.g. , @xcite ) is necessarily limited by the poor statistics .",
    "in addition , there is potential for source confusion in a low state , since we can not rule out a faint contaminating source at luminosities up to 10@xmath6 ergss@xmath2 .",
    "we have reconstructed the long - term light curve of m101  ulx-1 .",
    "we compute the 0.32.5 kev luminosity using an absorbed blackbody plus power law model for the high signal - to - noise data ( all data marked as `` high state '' in table 1 as well as the 2000 october _",
    "chandra _  and 2004 july _ xmm - newton _   observations ) . for fainter data ,",
    "we convert from count rates to luminosity using a conversion factor derived from 2004 july _ xmm - newton _  data .",
    "we similarly estimate the luminosity during earlier _ rosat _  observations .",
    "we present the resulting light curve in figure[ltlc ] , once for the entire period ( 1991 june through 2005 january ) and once for the _ chandra_-_xmm - newton _  era ( 2000 march through 2005 january ) .",
    "the most obvious feature of this is the recurrent high states .",
    "we investigate if there is an underlying periodicity in these high states .",
    "high states of m101  ulx-1  appear to have durations of over eighteen days , though the amount of time spent at the peak luminosity is significantly shorter , judging from the lightcurves of the 2004 july and 2004 december/2005 january high states .",
    "the intervals between the 2000 march high state and the 2000 october high state ( 216 days ) and that between the 2004 july high state and the 2004 december/2005 january high state ( 151 days ) are incommensurate , implying that the high states of m101  ulx-1  does not repeat on a strict period .    in order to explore the characteristic time scales of the system , we have classified each observation as either `` high '' ( l@xmath7 ergss@xmath2 ) or `` low . ''",
    "we attempted to match this bimodal light - curve with a square wave with period @xmath8 , phase , and an activity fraction as free parameters .",
    "if the source were strictly periodic , then the activity fraction would correspond to the duty fraction . for a source that is not strictly periodic",
    ", the activity fraction corresponds to the width of a `` window '' in which the source is likely to be active , convolved with the duty fraction .",
    "we have explored three different data selections : the well sampled interval from 2004 january to 2005 january ( the msec interval ) , the less well sampled interval from 2000 march to 2005 january ( the _ chandra__xmm - newton _  era ) , and the entire interval , which includes the _ rosat _  data as well .",
    "these selections allow us to investigate a range of periods , allowing for departures from a strict periodicity .",
    "we have tested periods from 20 to 250 days , and activity fractions from 1% to 60% .",
    "figure  [ periods ] ( left ) shows the regions with the best matches to the data for the three different data selections .",
    "note that , given the high / low simplification of the light curve used in our analysis , the regions in this plot are either allowed or not allowed , with no quantitative goodness of fit in the usual sense .",
    "the msec epoch data allow `` periods '' of 154163 days and 187199 days , with no data - model mismatches .",
    "the more extended interval does not allow a solution if we require that all data points match the model .",
    "however , if we allow one mismatch , periods of 159 days and 189199 days are allowed .",
    "the entire dataset has a periodic solution only if we allow two observations to be mismatched .",
    "`` periods '' with only two mismatches are 156 days , 159 days , 172174 days , and 193197 days .",
    "thus , no matter which data subset was chosen , `` periods '' around 159 and 195 days best matched the data , but the longer the interval , the more mismatches are required .",
    "we also investigated if a shorter period ( @xmath960 days ) might match the data ( figure  [ periods ] right ) . using the msec interval ,",
    "the best solutions ( 45 days ) would produce two mismatches , usually the 2004 july _ xmm - newton _  observation , and either the first or last observations of an extended set of _ chandra _  observations .",
    "longer fit intervals produced greater numbers of mismatches for their best fits .",
    "this analysis suggests that m101  ulx-1  has a characteristic time - scale .",
    "it is not a strict periodicity , although it is still possible that it is a superposition of periodic and random variations .",
    "we present the light curves of 2004 july and 2004 december/2005 january high states in figure[lcjuly ] and figure[lcjan ] , respectively .",
    "the high degree of short - timescale variability is obvious .",
    "moreover , we confirm our earlier results @xcite of the energy dependence of the variability : m101  ulx-1  is more variable at higher energies .",
    "the power density spectra ( pds ) of disk - accreting x - ray binaries can be classified into two broad categories based on whether the eddington accretion rate ( @xmath10=@xmath11/@xmath12 ) is above or below the critical value , @xmath13 , regardless of the nature of the primary @xcite . at low accretion rate ( @xmath14 ) , x - ray binaries have a fractional rms amplitude of a few times 10% and a broken power law pds ( hereafter type a ) ; at high accretion rate ( @xmath15 ) , they have a fractional rms of a few percent , with power law ( index 11.5 ) pds ( type b ) .",
    "although there is a well - known hysteresis effect @xcite that complicates the situation , @xcite have nevertheless obtained an empirical calibration of @xmath13 of 0.1 , in terms of observed 0.310 kev luminosity as a fraction of the eddington limit .",
    "they ( see also @xcite ) have applied this to identify black hole candidates in m31 .",
    "we have performed a similar pds analysis of m101  ulx-1 , both from the 2000 march observation and from the 2004 july observations ( figure[pdslong ] ) .",
    "the pdss can be described by a power law with a slope of about @xmath161 , merging into the photon counting noise at 10@xmath17 hz .",
    "this is consistent with a type b pds for an extragalactic x - ray binary , implying that the eddington accretion rate of the source was in the range 0.11.0 both in 2000 march and in 2004 july .",
    "therefore , equating our estimate of the 0.310 kev luminosity in 2004 july of @xmath18 ergss@xmath2  (  3.3 ) with 0.1 l@xmath19 , we infer the upper limit of compact object mass of @xmath20 40 m@xmath21 .",
    "if the x - rays we observe from m101  ulx-1  are beamed , then the true luminosity is lower , and the compact object mass is also lower . on the other hand , equating the highest luminosity we measure ( 3@xmath22 ergss@xmath2 ) with l@xmath19 , we infer a lower limit of 20 m@xmath21 , again assuming that there is no beaming and m101  ulx-1  stays sub - eddington at all times .",
    "however , the latter assumption need not apply strictly , since it is quite possible for an accreting object to exceed its eddington limit for a short time .",
    "we have investigated the high state spectra of m101  ulx-1 , first using an absorbed blackbody model @xcite . when applied to the 2004 july data",
    ", we obtain an high absorbing column ( n@xmath23@xmath24 @xmath25 ) and an absorbed 0.37 kev luminosity of @xmath26 ergss@xmath2 .",
    "( note that the 3@xmath5 ergss@xmath2  value claimed by @xcite is the unabsorbed luminosity in the 0.37 kev band ) .",
    "the x - ray absorbing column inferred by this fit is well above the galactic column of @xmath27 @xmath25  and the total absorption through the disk of m101 ( @xmath28 @xmath25 ) .",
    "if this x - ray column was due to normal interstellar matter , this translates to an expected color excess e@xmath29 of @xmath200.33 @xcite , or a visual extinction a@xmath30 of @xmath201 magnitude .",
    "in contrast , the optical counterpart has a b@xmath16v color of @xmath160.15@xmath310.12 , which is consistent with that of a b supergiant with little reddening ( see figure 4 of @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , an assumed value of a@xmath30=0.4 will make the optical counterpart intrinsically bluer than any early type stars .",
    "moreover , there is a suggestion of day - to - day variability of n@xmath23  during the interval july 512 , 2004 in the spectral fits by @xcite .",
    "therefore , if this model is correct , a significant fraction of the x - ray absorber is likely to be located within the binary or in its immediate surroundings and is thus subject to an intense ionizing radiation .",
    "given this , we have also fitted the average ( july 511 ) spectrum using a blackbody plus ionized absorber model ( the latter implemented in xspec as `` absori '' ) .",
    "highly ionized matter is essentially transparent at soft x - ray energies , and even a small ( @xmath32 ) ionization makes the fit visibly worse ( figure[absori ] ; table[absfit ] ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that the observed shape of the soft x - ray spectrum demands a near neutral absorber , if a blackbody ( or a disk blackbody ) is the intrinsic spectrum shape .",
    "what if the intrinsic spectral shape is a blackbody with absorption edges in the _ chandra _  band , as @xcite claimed ? we can indeed fit the 2004 july spectrum with modest interstellar column ( 4@xmath33 @xmath25 ) , but only if we include a strong edge below the acis band , e.g. , at 0.28 kev .",
    "we show one such example in figure[absori ] , resulting in a 63 ev blackbody with edges at 0.28 and 0.56 kev .",
    "however , a strong edge below 0.3 kev requires low z elements ( presumably c ) with k - shell electrons . that is , such an edge is in fact the sign of a near neutral absorber .",
    "we therefore conclude that the presence of a neutral absorber is required to explain the observed curvature of the spectrum below @xmath200.5 kev .",
    "we have then analyzed all high state spectra obtained with _",
    "chandra _  together .",
    "these are the 2000 march observation analyzed by @xcite ; the 2004 july observations ; and the 2004 december/2005 january observations .",
    "we omit the 2000 october observation , since m101  ulx-1  was relatively faint , although still well within the high state , and the exposure time was short ( @xmath910 ksec ) .",
    "we re - use the subdivision of 2000 march data into high , medium , and low intensity states as defined by @xcite .",
    "when m101",
    "ulx-1  is at its brightest , we observe an excess of counts above 2 kev , which can be fitted with an additional power law .",
    "however , the parameters of this component is poorly constrained , so we concentrate on fitting below 2 kev .    using the blackbody model absorbed only with a neutral absorber , we plot the blackbody temperature , the absorbing column , and the inferred bolometric luminosity against the count rates in the left column of figure[trend ] .",
    "we use the observed count rates for the msec observations , but scale the 2000 march count rates by the ratio of 0.31 kev effective areas to approximately account for the loss of low energy response in acis - s .",
    "we immediately see that both n@xmath34 and the inferred bolometric luminosity ( l@xmath35 ) have a negative correlation with the observed count rate .",
    "the similarity of behavior of the two suggests there is a common origin .",
    "we propose that this is an artifact of the absorbed blackbody fit : if the true spectrum of m101  ulx-1  is more strongly peaked than a blackbody , blackbody fits will forced to a high n@xmath34 value and inflate the inferred l@xmath35 .    to test this hypothesis ,",
    "we have fitted these 6 spectra with a second model .",
    "after some experimentation , we have fixed n@xmath34 to 4@xmath33 @xmath25 , a reasonable value for an object in the disk of m101 .",
    "the underlying model is a variable blackbody plus a relativistic line from an accretion disk ( `` diskline '' as implemented in xspec ) .",
    "this model is often invoked for the fe k lines in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "more recently , @xcite have fitted the _",
    "xmm - newton _  rgs spectra of two agn using relativistic lines from oviii , nvi , and cv , and the same physical interpretation can in principle apply to m101  ulx-1 .    the parameters for the diskline were fixed at the following values , after experimentation : the central energy , 0.5 kev ; @xmath36 ( power law index for the radial dependence of emissivity ) , @xmath162 ; range of accretion disk radius , 61000 m@xmath37 ; and disk inclination , 75@xmath38 .",
    "we show the july 2004 data as fitted with this model in figure[absori ] .",
    "the line energy ( 0.5 kev ) suggests nvi , while for this spectrum alone ( in fact , only the july 6 spectrum ) , an additional line at 0.8 kev would further improve the fit .",
    "alternatively , this feature could be due to a transient edge at 0.9 kev @xcite .",
    "as for the 0.6 kev edge also noted by @xcite , this is not required for a good fit once the 0.5 kev emission line is included in the model .",
    "we summarize the results for all high state spectra in table[trendtab ] and in the right column of figure[trend ] .",
    "in contrast to the absorbed blackbody fits , the inferred l@xmath35 values are positively correlated with the count rates using this model .",
    "the inferred bolometric luminosity and the unabsorbed 0.310 kev luminosity for the 2004 july data are @xmath39 ergss@xmath2  and @xmath18 ergss@xmath2 , in contrast to the much higher value obtained with the absorbed blackbody fit .",
    "the 2005 january _ xmm - newton _  data can also be fitted with either model ( table[trendtab ] ) . in these fits ,",
    "the model parameters are statistically well - constrained ( e.g. , the blackbody temperature has typical errors of 5 to 20 ev ) , but it is clear that the true uncertainties are dominated by the systematics due to our choice of models .",
    "various authors have borrowed existing terminology to describe m101  ulx-1  and other bright x - ray sources in nearby galaxies . on closer inspection , however , the applied terminology often fails to meet the traditional definition used in the galactic x - ray binary community .",
    "we have therefore considered , and ultimately declined to use , two nomenclatures that have been applied to m101  ulx-1 .",
    "super - soft sources ( ssss ) are luminous soft x - ray sources with equivalent blackbody temperatures of @xmath201580 ev and estimated bolometric luminosities of 10@xmath610@xmath40 ergss@xmath2  @xcite .",
    "it is generally accepted that , with few exceptions , ssss are nuclear burning white dwarfs . however , some authors ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) have sought to expand the definition of the class in recent years . while the expanded definition allows these authors to draw attention to a collection of interesting objects , they are likely to be a heterogeneous mixture .",
    "we prefer to preserve the well - established connotation of sss with nuclear burning white dwarfs .",
    "@xcite identified 10 _ chandra _  sources in m101 as supersoft , using a hardness ratio criterion that approximates the traditional definition : these sources have no counts above 0.8 kev . on the other hand , m101  ulx-1  was in a high state at the time and had significant counts even above 1.3 kev .",
    "we therefore do not consider m101  ulx-1  to be an sss .",
    "the other terminology we discuss is `` x - ray transient , '' for which it is difficult to find a formal definition .",
    "historically , this term is applied to galactic x - ray sources that are detectable by all - sky monitors at one epoch and undetectable in pointed observations using collimated ( non - imaging ) instruments . in particular ,",
    "soft x - ray transients , which are believed to be due to disk instability @xcite , usually have quiescent luminosity less than 10@xmath41 ergss@xmath2 . with the current generation of instruments ,",
    "sources in m101 that are fainter than 10@xmath6 ergss@xmath2  are undetectable in a single observation .",
    "such an upper limit is far too high to establish the presence of a true transient , although it is certainly possible to find candidate transients @xcite . in the specific case of m101  ulx-1",
    ", it is unknown if it ever becomes fainter than 10@xmath6 ergss@xmath2 .",
    "for this reason , we have not used the term `` transient '' to describe m101  ulx-1 , nor have we used the related terms `` quiescent '' and `` outburst , '' instead preferring the more neutral terms , `` high state '' and `` low state . ''",
    "@xcite have analyzed the 2004 july spectra of m101  ulx-1  using the absorbed blackbody model , inferred a bolometric luminosity of @xmath42 ergss@xmath2 , and concluded that m101  ulx-1  must contain an imbh . using the eddington luminosity argument , @xmath42 ergss@xmath2  corresponds to a minimum mass of 700 m@xmath0 .",
    "however , our spectral analysis above makes it clear that this conclusion is highly model - dependent .",
    "we argue , moreover , that the absorbed blackbody fits have two shortcomings : the requirement for a neutral absorber next to a @xmath410@xmath43 ergss@xmath2  x - ray source , and the counterintuitive trend of fitted parameters against _ chandra _  count rate .",
    "as noted earlier , the high and variable values of the x - ray absorber in the absorbed blackbody fits ( figure[trend ] ) require the absorber to be in the vicinity of m101  ulx-1  itself .",
    "whereas the presence of such intra- or circum - binary material is expected , due to the copious mass loss from the supergiant mass donor , it is likely to be highly ionized on average ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , even when the luminosity is a few times 10@xmath40 ergss@xmath2 ; much more so if the bolometric luminosity is near 10@xmath44 ergss@xmath2 .",
    "while high density clumps with lower than average ionization are expected , we need extreme clumping to explain the observed absorber .",
    "for example , for a clump 10@xmath45 cm from a 10@xmath44 ergss@xmath2  source to have @xmath46 , a density greater than 10@xmath47 cm@xmath17 is required ; for such a clump to be responsible for the observed x - ray absorption of n@xmath23  @xmath24 @xmath25 , it must have a length of only @xmath49 cm .",
    "a clump at a distance of 10@xmath47 cm needs a density @xmath50 cm@xmath17 and a length of @xmath51 cm .",
    "that is , for such a clump to remain neutral , it must have a high overdensity factor , and hence a small filling factor .",
    "we therefore consider the inferred neutrality of the x - ray absorber to be a severe problem for the absorbed blackbody interpretation .",
    "this model also leads to a counterintuitive trend with observed count rate ( figure[trend ] ; table[trendtab ] ) , whereas our alternative spectral model does not suffer from this problem .",
    "we do not necessarily claim that our model is the correct physical description of m101  ulx-1 .",
    "nevertheless , it is comforting to note that a simple analytical model , with a physical interpretation ( relativistic emission line from the accretion disk ) can fit the collection of high state spectra without requiring an anti - correlation between observed count rate and bolometric luminosity , or the presence of a neutral absorber within an ulx system .",
    "it is quite possible that other models can be found that can fit the available data equally well .",
    "any model that fits the data without requiring a high n@xmath23  will likely result in a moderate bolometric luminosity in 2004 july of @xmath39 ergss@xmath2 .",
    "we conclude that there is no compelling evidence for an imbh of the sort claimed by @xcite ( @xmath52100 m@xmath0 ) in m101  ulx-1 .",
    "we furthermore consider that the accreting object is likely a 2040 m@xmath21 black hole from our pds analysis (  3.2 ) .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of m101  ulx-1  is unlike those of well - established stellar - mass black hole candidates , but this is common problem for all models of m101  ulx-1 . before proceeding further with this interpretation ,",
    "we briefly consider possible alternatives .    can m101  ulx-1  contain a nuclear burning white dwarf , given that the high state spectrum of m101  ulx-1  is dominated by a soft , blackbody - like component ?",
    "there is indeed a superficial similarity between m101  ulx-1  and sss .",
    "however , m101",
    "ulx-1  is too hot at times ( kt as high as 0.2 kev ) , and the observed luminosity in 2000 march ( before absorption and bolometric corrections ) is well above the eddington limit for a white dwarf .",
    "high luminosity is thought to drive a strong ( but non - relativistic ) outflow , expanding the white dwarf photosphere and driving the emission to longer wavelength ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "beaming is unlikely , since the supersoft emission in a nuclear burning white dwarf is photospheric , and no relativistic jet is expected .",
    "thus , a white dwarf accretor appears unlikely in this case .",
    "can it be a neutron star ?",
    "many x - ray pulsars have a soft component often modeled as a blackbody with kt@xmath200.1 kev @xcite , which is also pulsed .",
    "if it is a pulsar , its emission is by definition beamed , so the eddington luminosity argument loses its punch .",
    "although accreting pulsars are usually dominated by a hard power - law component in the _ chandra _  band , different beaming of the hard and soft component might make m101  ulx-1  appear dominated by the soft component .",
    "our timing analysis is limited by the time resolution of the acis data in the high state and the lack of photons in the low state , so a p@xmath53s pulsar would have not been detected .",
    "this possibility should be kept in mind for m101  ulx-1 , but does require a factor of 10 beaming of the soft component to explain the highest luminosity data .",
    "we therefore return to the interpretation we consider most likely , that m101  ulx-1  is a high - mass x - ray binary ( hmxb ) with a b supergiant mass donor @xcite and a 2040 m@xmath21 black hole . at the low end of our preferred range , it can be considered a normal stellar - mass black hole , while at the high end , it is more massive than those predicted by the standard theory of stellar evolution .",
    "it is unclear , however , if a radically different formation mechanism is required for such a black hole . in any case , the binary as a whole shows a family resemblance to the more familiar hmxbs .",
    "one well - known system to which m101  ulx-1  might be compared is cyg x-1 , for which the transitions to and from the low / hard state and the high / soft state enhance the apparent variability , depending on the bandpass of the x - ray instrument .",
    "its count rates varies by a factor of @xmath2010 in the _ rxte _ asm , which is sensitive to 210 kev x - rays . with the exception of the orbital period",
    ", there is no known periodic component in its long - term light curves , even though there are well - studied correlations between average brightness , x - ray spectral shape , x - ray pds , and the radio emission @xcite .",
    "we might simply consider m101  ulx-1  to be an extreme cousin of cyg x-1 , perhaps related to the higher black hole mass .    alternatively",
    ", the long - term modulation of m101  ulx-1   may be a `` super - orbital '' variability seen in several galactic and magellanic x - ray binaries ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "radiation - induced warping of the accretion disk is the leading candidate mechanism for such modulations ; it typically operates in high - luminosity , roche - lobe overflow systems and the resultant modulations are not strictly periodic .",
    "the long - term light curve suggests that m101  ulx-1  is usually in a low state , with secular average luminosity of about 10@xmath54 ergss@xmath2 . for a black hole with accretion efficiency ( l/@xmath55 ) of 10%",
    ", an accretion rate of 1.1@xmath56 gs@xmath2 or 1.8@xmath57 m@xmath0yr@xmath2 is required to produce 10@xmath54 ergss@xmath2 .",
    "it is possible to achieve such an accretion rate through wind accretion , without the mass donor filling its roche lobe .",
    "if so , the long - term variation may reflect the orbital period of an eccentric binary .",
    "for example , gx301@xmath162 is a 41.5 day period , eccentric ( @xmath58=0.462 ) binary in which a neutron star accretes the wind of a supergiant mass donor ( see , e.g. , @xcite )",
    ". the analogy would be very close if the long - term modulation is an irregular manifestation of an underlying 45-day clock ( figure  [ periods ] right ) .    in conclusion ,",
    "the observations so far of m101  ulx-1  are consistent with this being a high mass x - ray binary with a b supergiant mass donor and a large stellar mass black hole .",
    "the long - term variability may have an underlying periodic clock , and this should be investigated with further x - ray observations . at the same time , ground - based optical spectroscopy should be pursued in search of the orbital period .",
