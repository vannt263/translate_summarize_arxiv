    "we found numerically that for electron kinetic energies as low as @xmath196 the electrons can penetrate the focus and the maximum deflection angle is below @xmath197 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the transverse ponderomotive force which is responsible for the deflection is proportional to the gradient of the laser intensity and scales as @xmath198 , where @xmath46 is rather small and the laser spot size @xmath199 is large .",
    "consequently , electrons with kinetic energies of a few hundred @xmath200 are suitable for such experiments .",
    "in conclusion , studying the laser assisted compton scattering of x - rays will significantly advance our understanding of strong - field qed scattering processes in the @xmath0 multi - photon regime .",
    "the authors are grateful to t.  e.  cowan and r.  sauerbrey for the inspiring collaboration on future experiments at hibef .",
    "ds acknowledges stimulating discussions with s.  fritzsche , a.  surzhykov and v.  g.  serbo .",
    "in this appendix we discuss briefly the limit of infinite monochromatic plane waves ( ipw ) , @xmath201 . in this case ,",
    "characterized by @xmath202 , the integral in the exponents of the functions @xmath104 , eq .  ,",
    "is given by @xmath203 owing to the periodicity of the monochromatic field , the integrand of the @xmath104 can be expanded in a discrete fourier series , excluding the non - periodic terms in , such that the integrals @xmath104 turn into a sum over discrete partial amplitudes . for instance , for @xmath118",
    "we find @xmath204 with amplitudes @xmath205 and the bessel functions @xmath206 .",
    "similar relations can be found for all integrals @xmath207 .",
    "thus , in the limit of infinite plane waves the variable @xmath16 becomes a discrete @xmath208 , with integer values of @xmath18 , due to @xmath209 .",
    "the term @xmath210 can be absorbed into the electron momenta leading to the occurrence of the field - dressed quasi - momentum @xmath211 and similarly for @xmath114 .",
    "the formal energy momentum conservation turns into @xmath212 where @xmath18 can be considered as number of laser photons exchanged during the scattering process , as pointed out e.g.  in @xcite for non - linear compton scattering .",
    "solving for the frequency @xmath11 gives @xmath213 i.e.  discrete frequencies @xmath214 with an intensity dependent red - shift quantified by the term @xmath215 in the denominator @xcite .    integrating over @xmath108 in and exploiting the delta distributions in the functions @xmath207 , the amplitude @xmath109 , eq .  , becomes a sum of discrete partial amplitudes @xmath216 the same is true for the cross section @xmath217 as known from the literature , e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the dependence on @xmath11 in is replaced by a sum over discrete values of @xmath18 .",
    "this shows that our results for pulsed plane waves , in particular , and , contain also the known case of infinite plane waves in the proper limit .",
