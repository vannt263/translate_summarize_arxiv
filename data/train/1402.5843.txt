    "are regarded to be the simplest non periodic words .",
    "sturmian words admit many different characterizations of combinatorial , geometric and arithmetic nature . in the 1940 s , hedlund and",
    "morse showed that each sturmian word is the symbolic coding of the orbit of a point @xmath3 on the unit circle under a rotation by an irrational angle @xmath22 called the slope , where the circle is partitioned into two complementary intervals , one of length @xmath23 and the other of length @xmath24 conversely each such coding defines a sturmian word .",
    "it is well known that the dynamical / ergodic properties of the system , as well as the combinatorial properties of the associated sturmian word , hinge on the arithmetical / diophantine qualities of the slope @xmath25 given by its continued fraction expansion .",
    "sturmian words arise naturally in various branches of mathematics including combinatorics , algebra , number theory , ergodic theory , dynamical systems and differential equations .",
    "they also have implications in theoretical physics as @xmath26-dimensional models of quasi - crystals .",
    "other measures of complexity of words have been introduced and studied in the literature , including abelian complexity , maximal pattern complexity , @xmath27-abelian complexity , binomial complexity , periodicity complexity , minimal forbidden factor complexity and palindromic complexity . with respect to most word complexity functions ,",
    "sturmian words are characterized as those non periodic words of lowest complexity .",
    "one exception to this occurs in the context of maximal pattern complexity introduced by kamae in @xcite . in this case , while sturmian words are _ pattern sturmian _ , meaning have minimal maximal pattern complexity amongst all non periodic words , they are not the only ones .",
    "in fact , a certain restricted class of toeplitz words which includes the period doubling word are also known to be pattern sturmian ( see @xcite ) . on the other hand , the thue - morse word , while closely connected to the period doubling word , is known to have full maximal pattern complexity ( see example 1 in @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we consider a new measure of complexity , _ cyclic complexity _ , which consists in counting the factors of each given length of an infinite word up to conjugacy .",
    "two words @xmath28 and @xmath29 are said to be _ conjugate _ if and only if @xmath30 and @xmath31 for some words @xmath32 i.e. , if they are equal when read on a circle .",
    "the cyclic complexity of a word is the function which counts the number of conjugacy classes of factors of each given length .",
    "we note that factor complexity , abelian complexity and cyclic complexity can all be viewed as actions of different subgroups of the symmetric group on the indices of a finite word ( respectively , the trivial subgroup , the whole symmetric group and the cyclic subgroup generated by the permutation @xmath33    we establish the following analogue of the morse - hedlund theorem :    [ theor1 ] a word @xmath9 is ultimately periodic if and only if it has bounded cyclic complexity .",
    "the factor complexity does not distinguish between sturmian words of different slopes .",
    "in contrast , for cyclic complexity the situation is quite different .",
    "indeed , we prove :    [ theor2 ] let @xmath3 be a sturmian word . if @xmath4 is an infinite word whose cyclic complexity is equal to that of @xmath5 then up to renaming letters , @xmath3 and @xmath4 have the same set of factors . in particular , @xmath4 is also sturmian .",
    "a word is ( purely ) periodic if and only if there exists an integer @xmath1 such that all factors of length @xmath1 are conjugate .",
    "therefore , the minimum value of the cyclic complexity of a non periodic word is 2 .",
    "we prove that if @xmath9 is a sturmian word then @xmath34 we show however that this is not a characterization of sturmian words by exhibiting a family of toeplitz words , which includes the period doubling word , for which @xmath34 we further show that if @xmath35 is a paperfolding word , then for every @xmath8 one has @xmath36 .",
