    "the visibility of material processed by their own interior nuclear reactions at the surfaces of stars is a remarkable diagnostic that will contribute to unique definitions of their evolutionary status and histories , once the complex mechanisms involved can be identified and understood .",
    "an inverse n / c , o dichotomy in certain ob spectra was announced and discussed by walborn ( 1971 , 1976 ) .",
    "unfortunately , reliable quantitative analysis of these spectra has lagged those results by decades , because of the complexity of especially the supergiant atmospheres and winds ; only recently have thorough analyses of substantial samples begun to appear ( e.g. , rivero gonzlez et  al .",

    "there is a growing consensus that the rare extreme cases of the phenomenon bracket systematic trends of nitrogen enrichment among massive stars , such that , e.g. , the majority of _ morphologically _ normal ob supergiants are _ physically _ enhanced , while the obc and obn spectra correspond to opposite extremes , as originally suggested by walborn ( 1976 ) .",
    "of course , that can be established only quantitatively , not only because of the range of degrees , but also because morphological detection of even extreme cases depends on the availability of suitable criteria , which is nonuniform and produces selection effects .    the galactic o - star spectroscopic survey ( gosss ; maz apellniz et  al .",
    "2011 ) ambitiously proposes to observe the blue - violet spectra of every accessible o  star in the galaxy , i.e. , a few thousand , with homogeneous resolving power ( @xmath02500 ) and signal - to - noise ( @xmath0200 ) .",
    "nearly 450 verified or new classifications have already been published ( sota et  al .  2011 , 2014 ; papers  i & ii , respectively ) and about as many more are in progress .",
    "such a project is guaranteed to reveal new categories of spectra as well as individual objects of special interest , and that has already occurred ( walborn et  al .  2010 , 2011 ) .",
    "the first of those references addresses curious differences in the relative intensities of n  iii and c  iii emission features among of spectra , which may or may not be related to chemical abundances since selective excitation effects are involved .",
    "the second expands upon the onn category of nitrogen - enhanced , rapidly rotating , late - o giant spectra , further increased by one in this paper .",
    "two new on  supergiants are likewise significant because of their rarity and the need to disentangle possibly multiple physical mechanisms within the category .",
    "thus , these three new objects are presented and discussed in their respective contexts here , along with some related developments in their classification criteria .",

    "data for these objects are listed in table  1 , in the same order as the figure .",
    "the two new members have somewhat earlier types ( higher temperatures ) , which at first glance had excluded them from the category .",
    "that is because the original definition of an on  star required the n  iii  @xmath36463446404642 absorption blend ( hereafter `` @xmath374640 '' ) to be stronger than c  iii  @xmath36464746504652 ( `` @xmath374650 '' ) , which is not the case in these spectra .",
    "however , the other n  iii features are exceedingly strong , including the @xmath3645114515 blend discussed later as an additional criterion for the class , and especially @xmath374097 in the shortward wing of h@xmath38 .",
    "c  iii is also significantly weaker than normal .",
    "the relative weakness of @xmath374640 is a result of filling by the of selective emission , which increases toward earlier types ( and higher luminosities ) , resulting in a strong selection of the on classification toward the latest o  types .",
    "we have three observations of hde  328209 , from 2011 march  24 , 2013 may  30 , and 2014 april  26 , among which all spectral features are essentially identical ; the second of these is shown in fig .  1 .",
    "the exact spectral types of these two stars are not well defined due to somewhat conflicting criteria .",
    "both the he  ii  @xmath374200/he  i  @xmath374144 and he  ii  @xmath374541/he  i  @xmath374387 ratios should have values of unity at type o9 , increasing toward earlier and decreasing toward later types .",
    "however , in both of these spectra the first of those ratios is slightly larger ( tending toward type o8.5 ) while the latter is slightly smaller ( type o9.2 ; sota et  al .",
    "thus , the compromise typeo9 is adopted for both . in the first ratio ,",
    "the discrepancy is most likely caused by blending with enhanced n  iii  @xmath364196 , 4200 .",
    "in addition , hde  323110 is an sb2 , with blended , shortward secondary components visible at the he  i lines in fig .  1 .",
    "unfortunately , the luminosity classes of the two spectra are likewise problematic.hde  323110 appears to have a very weak p  cyg profile at the principal criterion he  ii  @xmath374686 , which is consistent with class  ia .",
    "( an alternative interpretation could be a blend of lines from the two sb components , weaker in the longward spectrum which would still indicate ia . ) in contrast , in hde  328209 , the @xmath374686 absorption ( which weakens with increasing luminosity also due to the of effect ) is only slightly weaker than he  i  @xmath374713 , which calls for class  ib , in substantial disagreement with the exceedingly strong si  iv  @xmath364089 , 4116 absorptions that are appropriate for ia .",
    "hence , only a relatively indeterminate luminosity class of i can be assigned to this spectrum .",
    "a further interesting feature of these spectra is the prominent quartet of weak , similarly spaced absorption lines near @xmath374000 .",
    "its bookends are the usual n  ii  @xmath373995 and he  i  @xmath374009 , which are at the low - ionization extreme of these spectra , while the two intermediate lines , favored by the ionization and nitrogen enhancement , are n  iii  @xmath363999 , 4004 that have similar intensities to the outer two for those reasons .",
    "this configuration can be recognized in the other on  i spectra briefly discussed next , albeit with differing relative intensities corresponding to their respective spectral types .",
    "there is also interesting prior and current external information about both of these stars .",
    "the anomalous n / c spectra of hde  323110 (= lss  4103 ) were accurately first reported by vijapurkar & drilling ( 1993 ) ; our later recognition of this characteristic is independent and thus confirmatory of theirs .",
    "moreover , in agreement with the above description of line profiles in our spectrogram , the own survey ( barb et  al .",
    "2010 ) has discovered that this object is a short - period , eclipsing , interacting sb2 , which will be presented in the context of that program .",

    "this is an obvious problem ripe for intensive theoretical investigation with the hope of a well defined solution .",
    "to date ( january 2016 ) gosss has observed a total of nearly 900 o  stars , for 590 of which reviewed or new spectral classifications have been or are about to be published ( sota et  al .  2011 , 2014 ; maz apellniz et  al .  2016 , in press ) .",
    "the former total includes 56 with spectral types in the ranges o9o9.7  ib - ia , of which 7 are on and 4 oc ; and 74 in the ranges o8.5o9.7  iv ",
    "ii(n)nn , of which 8 are on and none oc .",
    "thus , the on supergiants comprise 12.5% of the total in their spectral - type ranges , and the onn giants 11% of their ranges .",
    "of course , the `` normal '' samples exhibit differing degrees of mixed processed material , including nitrogen - strong ( nstr ) and nitrogen - weak ( nwk ) spectra that are less extreme than the on / oc ,  and in particular a majority with some degree of mixing among the supergiants ( see walborn 1976 ) .",
    "the extreme on / oc spectra are small tails of the overall distributions .      as discussed early in the history of the obn / obc classification dichotomy ( walborn 1976 ) , the recognition of such morphological anomalies is nonuniform in the hrd , depending upon the available features and their normal two - dimensional ( temperature , luminosity ) behavior .",
    "the @xmath3646404650 absorption blends in late - o supergiants provide a prime example . in normal spectra ,",
    "the longward c  iii blend is much stronger than the adjacent , shortward n  iii . when the latter becomes the stronger in the rare on spectra , a striking anomaly results ( fig .  1 ) . when the two are about equal , the `` nstr '' notation is used .",
    "however , this criterion functions optimally only in the restricted o9.2b0.5 range . at later types ,",
    "first the n  iii and then the c  iii become too weak and are dominated by o  ii blends at the same wavelengths . toward earlier types ,",
    "the issue is the progressive filling in of the n  iii absorption by the of emission effect , such that it never exceeds the c  iii even for comparable or greater n enhancements .",
    "thus , a strong selection effect in the on classification arises .",
    "it is interesting to note that it also applies to the even rarer case of luminosity exceeding ia , as in hde  269896 with he  ii  @xmath374686 in emission despite the late - o spectral type ; that has been compensated in its on classification even though the n  iii absorption is only comparable to the c  iii .",
    "here we have introduced that same compensation for somewhat hotter supergiants , namely hde  323110 and 328209 , in which the two blends are again comparable , while other n  iii absorption features are abnormally intense and c  iii is deficient , as already described above .",
    "actually , this development has recently been anticipated by the on8  iii((f ) ) classification of vfts  819 in 30  doradus ( walborn et  al .",
    "2014 , fig .",
    "22 ) although @xmath374640 is nearly neutral .",
    "note that other n  iii absorption features in its spectrum , including @xmath3645114515 , are stronger than in the somewhat more luminous o8 spectra adjacent to it in the figure .",
    "the possible relevance of @xmath3645114515 as an additional indicator of n  enhancement was discussed long ago by bisiacchi et  al .",
    "while their discrimination of the feature s normal two - dimensional behavior was not entirely satisfying , their proposal deserves reconsideration in the present context . it would indeed be interesting if accurate quantitative ew measurements of this feature might reveal smaller , continuous degrees of n  enhancement relative to the normal trends over a wider range of o  types , as they discussed .",
    "perhaps its ratio to c  iii  @xmath374650 would provide even higher sensitivity . as a start",
    ", we provide such measurements in table  1 for the spectra in figure  1 .",
    "it is encouraging that the ratios show monotonic discrimination among the on , normal , and oc spectra in the expected sense : the on range ( which may well be real ) runs from 0.83 to 2.35 with a mean of 1.48  @xmath46  0.19  ( m.e . ) , while the normal spectrum yields 0.4 and the oc 0.15 .",
    "those ratios can be derived from the measurements of bisiacchi et  al .  for 8  supergiants with the classifications of which as such we agree ( in a number of other cases they list as supergiants objects that are giants in our system ; note also their typo for hd  202124 ) : @xmath44  cam , 0.43 ; @xmath47  ori , 0.15 ; hd  75222 , 0.19 ; @xmath48  nor , 0.08 ; hd  152249 , 0.10 ; hd  202124 , 0.41 ; 19  cep , 0.22 ; hd  225146 , 0.10 . of these ,",
    "@xmath47  ori is nwk and hd  152249 is oc , while we consider the remainder to have morphologically normal cno .",
    "thus there is good to excellent agreement with our measurements in most cases , with the exceptions of @xmath48  nor and hde  225146 , which have values appropriate for oc while their spectral appearance is compatible with normal cno , albeit perhaps at the low - n side of the range .",

    "<S> is discussed as a means to alleviate that effect , and it is relevant to the two new objects . </S>",
    "<S> the entire on supergiant class is discussed ; they display a fascinating diversity of detail undoubtedly related to the complexities of their extended atmospheres and winds that are sensitive to small differences in physical parameters , as well as to binary effects in some cases . </S>",
    "<S> serendipitously , we have found significant variability in the spectrum of a little - known hypergiant with normal n , c spectra selected as a comparison for the anomalous objects . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the supergiants , the onn spectra are virtual ( nitrogen)-carbon copies of one another except for the degrees of line broadening , which emphasizes their probable unique origin and hence amenability to definitive astrophysical interpretation . </S>"
