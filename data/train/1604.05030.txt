    "magnetic skyrmions were recently observed via neutron diffraction in bulk chiral magnets such as mnsi  @xcite and in the multiferroic material cu@xmath0oseo@xmath1  @xcite .",
    "currently , they are attracting an enormous attention due to their stability  @xcite and their displacement speed upon applying electrical currents which makes them suitable for technological applications  @xcite .",
    "real space observation of skyrmions in fege and fe@xmath2co@xmath2si thin films has become possible using lorentz microscopy and magnetic force microscopy  @xcite and more recently in transition - metal films using spin - polarized low - energy electron microscopy  @xcite and magneto - optical kerr effect ( moke ) measurements  @xcite . in ultra - thin films of a few monolayers ,",
    "the skyrmion diameter can shrink down to a few nanometers and spin - polarized scanning tunneling microscopy ( sp - stm ) @xcite is a powerful tool for their observation and manipulation  @xcite .",
    "sp - stm is sensitive to the projection of the local magnetization density of states of the sample onto the magnetization direction of the tip @xcite and does not allow a direct determination of the three magnetization components in a single measurement .",
    "however , in most experimental setups it is not possible to continuously rotate the tip magnetization direction and conclusions have to be drawn from sp - stm experiments performed with only one or two tip magnetization directions .",
    "such measurements only allow a partial determination of the spin structure  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore essential to know ( i ) if the skyrmion ground states and some metastable states can be differentiated via simple sp - stm experiments ( based on one or two tip magnetization directions ) and ( ii ) to establish a clear proposal in order to discriminate between the different possible chiral spin structures via sp - stm .",
    "the occurrence of metastable skyrmionic spin structures is studied in a single atomic layer of pd in fcc stacking on the fcc monolayer fe on the ir(111 ) surface denoted as pd(fcc)@xmath3fe@xmath3ir(111 ) .",
    "this system has been studied experimentally using sp - stm @xcite and from first - principles calculations @xcite which allow to understand the transition from a spin spiral to a skyrmion and a ferromagnetic ( fm ) phase in an external magnetic field .",

    "we have obtained metastable states in mc simulations by relaxing a super cell of 100@xmath8100 spins on a two - dimensional hexagonal lattice starting from a random spin configuration at 1  k under a magnetic field of 20  t with a standard metropolis algorithm . at this field value",

    "the image shows a brighter contrast for the fm background with several black spots .",
    "all darker spots have a round shape and could correspond to skyrmion spin structures . however , when the tip magnetization is changed from out - of - plane to in - plane ( fig .",
    "[ fig : relax](b ) ) , the simulated sp - stm image shows two types of contrast compatible with recent observation of skyrmion  @xcite .",
    "the first contrast has a two - lobe pattern with one brighter and one darker side .",
    "the lobes can be aligned along the x axis or are rotated with respect to it .",
    "the second type of contrast has four lobes and appears seldom .",
    "it does not seem to have a preferred alignment .",
    "the topological character of different spin structures is given by their winding or skyrmion number : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the unit vector of the local magnetization and @xmath27 can take only integer values .",

    "the four - lobe contrast has a triangular shaped skyrmion density that integrates to the value of  @xmath30 suggesting the presence of a metastable higher order skyrmion in this system .",
    "experimentally , the different spin structures can be obtained by freezing an ultra - thin film sample from high temperatures to a temperature e.g. 1  k under magnetic field or by locally heating the sample  @xcite e.g.  with an electrical current while maintaining the sample at a low temperature .",

    "the current decreases when the tip scans across the skyrmion due to the antiparallel spin alignment and the contrast darkens .",

    ". the simulated sp - stm images of a skyrmion and an antiskyrmion could only differ by a rotation as seen fig .",
    "[ fig : relax](b ) .",
    "the only spin structure that can be easily distinguished is the higher - order skyrmion due to the multiple nodes of the contrast ( cf .",

    "the contrast of the sp - stm images can be quantified by the corrugation amplitude , i.e.  the maximal change of tip height as it is scanned across the spin structure , which is obtained by analyzing scan lines . from the simulated images one expects that such line profiles are very similar which",
    "is indeed confirmed in fig  [ fig : profile ] . for an out - of - plane magnetized tip , which leads to qualitatively very similar contrasts in the sp - stm images ( cf .",
    "fig  [ fig : static - stm ] ) , we obtain line profiles which are also in quantitative agreement with experimental data @xcite .",
    "these line profiles are characterized by a smooth change from a high tip - sample separation in the fm background ( when the magnetization of tip and the local magnetization of the sample are aligned ) to a low separation at the center of the spin structures .",
    "very similar corrugation amplitudes are found in our simulations for all spin structures , with corrugation values of 5.6 , 4.4 , 6.4 , and 7.1 pm for the right - handed skyrmion , the left - handed skyrmion , the antiskyrmion and the higher - order antiskyrmion , respectively .",
    "these corrugation amplitudes are on the same order as found in the experiments @xcite .",
    "when the tip magnetization is switched to in - plane , the line profiles show the same behavior for the right - handed skyrmion , the left - handed skyrmion and the antiskyrmion ( fig .",
    "[ fig : profile](a - c ) ) .",
    "since the contrast of the sp - stm images of the skyrmion and antiskyrmion are only rotated with respect to each other and the corrugation amplitudes are very similar , they can only be distinguished in experiments when both spin structures are present simultaneously . on the other hand , the higher - order skyrmion ( fig .",
    "[ fig : profile](d ) ) can be easily discriminated due to the presence of multiple nodes of the magnetization density also seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : static - stm](h ) .    in order to distinguish between the skyrmion and the antiskyrmion spin structures",
    ", we propose an experiment based on a 3d vector field available in stm experiments @xcite .",
    "such a field enables a rotation of the tip magnetization both within the surface plane as well as from in - plane to out - of - plane .",
    "although all in - plane magnetized tips result in the same contrast i.e.  a butterfly with a bright and a dark lobe ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : static - stm ] ) , the behavior of this contrast when the tip changes its direction is different as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spstm - rotate ] . for a right - handed skyrmion",
    ", the lobes will rotate in phase with the tip magnetization direction ( thick black arrows ) . in the case of an antiskyrmion ,",
    "a clockwise rotation of the in - plane component of the tip will induce a counterclockwise rotation of the lobes .",
    "therefore , in - plane rotation of the tip magnetization allows an unambiguous distinction between the right - handed skyrmion and the antiskyrmion .",
    "on the other hand , in order to distinguish a left- and right - handed skyrmion the tip magnetization must be rotated from the in - plane to the out - of - plane direction .",
    "in conclusion , we have demonstrated that it is non - trivial to distinguish via sp - stm between metastable spin structures at surfaces that differ by their chirality and/or topological charge .",
    "skyrmions and antiskyrmions exhibit a spherical shape in sp - stm using tips with an out - of - plane magnetization . for in - plane magnetized tips",
    "we obtain a characteristic butterfly pattern that is aligned along the tip magnetization for skyrmions , while the alignment depends on the antiskyrmion orientation with respect to the tip magnetization . if the tip magnetization is rotated within the surface plane the butterfly contrast rotates in phase with the tip direction for skyrmions and in the opposite direction for antiskyrmions allowing to unambiguously distinguish between them .",
    "the demonstration of stabilizing localized spin structures with different chirality and topological charge in the same system e.g. pd / fe / ir(111 ) , opens new possibilities for spintronics @xcite .",
