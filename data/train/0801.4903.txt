    "much of our current understanding of incompressible magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) turbulence has its roots in the pioneering work of iroshnikov  ( 1963 ) and kraichnan  ( 1965 ) .",
    "these studies emphasized the important fact that alfvn waves travelling in the same direction along a background magnetic field do not interact with one another and explained how one can think of the cascade of energy to small scales as resulting from collisions between oppositely directed alfvn wave packets .",
    "they also argued that in the absence of a mean magnetic field , the magnetic field of the energy - containing eddies at scale  @xmath7 affects fluctuations on scales  @xmath8 much in the same way as would a truly uniform mean magnetic field .",
    "another foundation of our current understanding is the finding that mhd turbulence is inherently anisotropic .",
    "montgomery & turner  ( 1981 ) and shebalin , matthaeus , & montgomery  ( 1983 ) showed that a strong uniform mean magnetic field  @xmath0 inhibits the cascade of energy to small scales measured in the direction parallel to  @xmath0 .",
    "this early work was substantially elaborated upon by higdon  ( 1984 ) , goldreich & sridhar  ( 1995 , 1997 ) , montgomery & matthaeus  ( 1995 ) , ng & bhattacharjee  ( 1996 , 1997 ) , galtier et al  ( 2000 ) , cho & lazarian  ( 2003 ) , oughton et al  ( 2006 ) , and many others .",
    "for example , cho & vishniac ( 2000 ) used numerical simulations to show that when the fluctuating magnetic field  @xmath9 is @xmath10 the small - scale turbulent eddies become elongated along the local magnetic field direction .",
    "goldreich & sridhar ( 1995 ) introduced the important and influential idea of `` critical balance , '' which holds that at each scale the linear wave period for the bulk of the fluctuation energy is comparable to the time for the fluctuation energy to cascade to smaller scales .",
    "goldreich & sridhar ( 1995 , 1997 ) , maron & goldreich  ( 2001 ) , and lithwick & goldreich  ( 2001 ) clarified a number of important physical processes in anisotropic mhd turbulence and used the concept of critical balance to determine the ratio of the dimensions of turbulent eddies in the directions parallel and perpendicular to the local magnetic field .",
    "over the last several years , research on mhd turbulence has been proceeding along several different lines .",
    "for example , one group of studies has attempted to determine the power spectrum , intermittency , and anisotropy of strong incompressible mhd turbulence using direct numerical simulations .",
    "( see , e.g. , cho & vishniac 2000 , mller & biskamp 2000 , maron & goldreich 2001 , cho et  al  2002 , haugen et  al  2004 , muller & grappin  2005 , mininni & pouquet 2007 , perez & boldyrev 2008 ) .",
    "another series of papers has explored the properties of anisotropic turbulence in weakly collisional magnetized plasmas using gyrokinetics , a low - frequency expansion of the vlasov equation that averages over the gyromotion of the particles .",
    "( howes et al  2006 , 2007a , 2007b ; schekochihin et al 2007 ) .",
    "these authors investigated the transition between the alfvn - wave cascade and a kinetic - alfvn - wave cascade at length scales of order the proton gyroradius  @xmath11 , as well as the physics of energy dissipation and entropy production in the low - collisionality regime .",
    "turbulence at scales  @xmath12 has also been examined both numerically and analytically within the framework of fluid models , in particular hall mhd and electron mhd .",

    "another group of studies has investigated the power spectrum , intermittency , and decay time of compressible mhd turbulence .",
    "( oughton et al 1995 , stone et  al  1998 , lithwick & goldreich  2001 , boldyrev et al  2002 , padoan et al  2004 , elmegreen & scalo 2004 ) . additional work by kuznetsov ( 2001 ) , cho & lazarian ( 2002 , 2003 ) , chandran ( 2005 ) , and luo & melrose ( 2006 ) has begun to address the way in which alfvn waves , fast magnetosonic waves , and slow magnetosonic waves interact in compressible weak mhd turbulence .",
    "another recent development is the finding that strong incompressible mhd turbulence leads to alternating patches of alignment and anti - alignment between the velocity and magnetic - field fluctuations .",
    "( boldyrev 2005 , 2006 ; beresnyak & lazarian 2006 ; mason , cattaneo , & boldyrev 2006 ; matthaeus et  al  2007 ) these studies examined how the degree of local alignment ( and anti - alignment ) depends upon length scale , as well as the effects of alignment upon the energy cascade time and the power spectrum of the turbulence .",
    "the topic addressed in this paper is the role of cross helicity in incompressible mhd turbulence .",
    "the cross helicity is defined as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the velocity and  @xmath15 is the magnetic field .",
    "the cross helicity is conserved in the absence of dissipation and can be thought of as a measure of the linkages between lines of vorticity and magnetic field lines , both of which are frozen to the fluid flow in the absence of dissipation ( moffatt 1978 ) . in the presence of a background magnetic field , @xmath16 ,",
    "the cross helicity is also a measure of the difference between the energy of fluctuations travelling in the @xmath17 and @xmath18 directions .",
    "dobrowolny , mangeney , & veltri  ( 1980 ) showed that mhd turbulence with cross helicity decays to a maximally aligned state , with @xmath19 , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the fluctuating velocity and magnetic field and @xmath22 is the mass density .",
    "different decay rates for the energy and cross helicity were also demonstrated by matthaeus & montgomery  ( 1980 ) . in another early study , grappin , pouquet , &",
    "lorat  ( 1983 ) used a statistical closure , the eddy - damped quasi - normal markovian ( edqnm ) approximation , to study strong 3d incompressible mhd turbulence with cross helicity , assuming isotropic power spectra .",
    "they found that when  @xmath23 , the total energy spectrum is steeper than the isotropic iroshnikov - kraichnan @xmath24  spectrum .",
    "pouquet et  al  ( 1988 ) found a similar result in direct numerical simulations of 2d incompressible mhd turbulence .",
    "more recently , lithwick , goldreich , & sridhar  ( 2007 ) and beresnyak & lazarian ( 2007 ) addressed the role of cross helicity in strong mhd turbulence taking into account the effects of anisotropy .",
    "this paper presents a new phenomenology for strong , anisotropic , incompressible mhd turbulence with nonzero cross helicity , and is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : wpc ] presents some relevant theoretical background .",
    "section  [ sec : theory ] introduces the new phenomenology as well as two nonlinear advection - diffusion equations that model the time evolution of the power spectra . analytic and numerical solutions to this equation in the",
    "weak - turbulence and strong - turbulence regimes are presented in sections  [ sec : weak ] and  [ sec : strong ] .",
    "section  [ sec : strong ] also presents a simple phenomenological derivation of the power spectra and anisotropy in strong mhd turbulence .",
    "section  [ sec : trans ] presents a numerical solution to the advection - diffusion equation that shows the smooth transition between the weak and strong turbulence regimes .",
    "section  [ sec : unequal ] addresses the case in which the parallel correlation lengths of waves propagating in opposite directions along the background magnetic field are unequal at the outer scale . in section  [ sec : solarwind ] , the proposed phenomenology is applied to turbulence in the solar wind and solar corona , and in section  [ sec : comp ] the results of this work are compared to the recent studies of lithwick , goldreich , & sridhar  ( 2007 ) and beresnyak & lazarian  ( 2007 ) .",
    "the equations of ideal incompressible mhd can be written @xmath25 where @xmath26 are the elsasser variables , @xmath14 is the fluid velocity , @xmath21 is the magnetic field fluctuation , @xmath22 is the mass density , which is taken to be uniform and constant , @xmath27 is the alfvn speed , @xmath16 is the mean magnetic field , and @xmath28 , which is determined by the incompressibility condition , @xmath29 . throughout this paper",
    "it is assumed that @xmath30 and @xmath31 .    in the limit of small - amplitude fluctuations ( @xmath32 ) ,",
    "the nonlinear term @xmath33 in equation  ( [ eq : mhd ] ) can be neglected to a first approximation , and the curl of equation  ( [ eq : mhd ] ) becomes @xmath34 which is solved by setting @xmath35 equal to an arbitrary function of @xmath36 .",
    "thus , @xmath37 represents fluctuations with @xmath38 that propagate in @xmath39 direction at speed  @xmath40 in the absence of nonlinear interactions . in the absence of an average velocity ,",
    "the cross helicity defined in equation  ( [ eq : defc ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath41 .",
    "\\label{eq : defc2}\\ ] ] the cross helicity is thus proportional to the difference in energy between fluctuations propagating in the @xmath17 and @xmath42 directions .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : mhd ] ) shows that the nonlinear term is nonzero only at those locations where both @xmath43 and @xmath44 are nonzero .",
    "nonlinear interactions can thus be thought of as collisions between oppositely directed wave packets ( kraichnan 1965 ) .",
    "when both @xmath43 and @xmath44 are nonzero , equation  ( [ eq : mhd ] ) indicates that the @xmath37 fluctuations are advected not at the uniform velocity @xmath45 , but rather at the non - uniform velocity @xmath46 .",
    "maron & goldreich ( 2001 ) elaborated upon this idea by showing that to lowest order in fluctuation amplitude , if one neglects the pressure term , then @xmath43 wave packets are advected along the hypothetical magnetic field lines corresponding to the sum of @xmath0 and the part of @xmath47 arising from the @xmath44 fluctuations .",
    "this result can be used to construct a geometrical picture for how wave - packet collisions cause energy to cascade to smaller scales , as depicted in figure  [ fig : f1 ] . in this figure , two oppositely",
    "directed wave packets of dimension @xmath48 in the plane perpendicular to  @xmath0 and length  @xmath49 along  @xmath0 pass through one another and get sheared . collisions between wavepackets of similar  @xmath50 are usually the dominant mechanism for transferring energy from large scales to small scales .",
    "the duration of the collision illustrated in the figure is approximately  @xmath51 .",
    "the fluctuating velocity and magnetic field are taken to be in the plane perpendicular to  @xmath0 , as is the case for linear shear alfvn waves .",
    "the magnitude of the nonlinear term in equation  ( [ eq : mhd ] ) is then @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the rms amplitude of the @xmath54 wave packet .",
    "the fractional change in the @xmath14 and @xmath55 fields of the @xmath56 wave packet induced by the collision is then roughly @xmath57    , width=288 ]    if this fractional change is @xmath58 for both @xmath43 and @xmath44 fluctuations then neither wave packet is altered significantly by a single collision , and the turbulence is weak .",
    "wave packets travel a distance  @xmath59 before being significantly distorted , and the fluctuations can thus be viewed as linear waves that are only weakly perturbed by nonlinear interactions with other waves . in the wave - packet collision depicted in figure",
    "[ fig : f1 ] , the right - hand side of the @xmath60 wave packet is altered by the collision in almost the same way as the left - hand side , since both sides encounter essentially the same  @xmath43 wave packet , since the  @xmath43 packet is changed only slightly during the collision .",
    "changes to the profile of a wave packet along the magnetic field are thus weaker than changes in the profile of a wave packet in the plane perpendicular to  @xmath0 ( shebalin et al 1983 , ng & bhattacharjee 1997 , goldreich & sridhar 1997 , bhattacharjee & ng  2001 , perez & boldyrev  2008 ) . as a result , in the weak - turbulence limit , the cascade of energy to small  @xmath49 is much less efficient than the cascade of energy to small  @xmath50 ( galtier et al 2000 ) .    on the other hand , if the fractional change in equation  ( [ eq : defchi1 ] ) is of order unity then a @xmath56 wave packet is distorted substantially during a single collision , and the turbulence is said to be `` strong . '' in the case that the fractional change in equation  ( [ eq : defchi1 ] ) is @xmath61 for one fluctuation type , ( e.g. , @xmath44 ) but @xmath58 for the other ( @xmath43 ) , the turbulence is still referred to as strong . it should be noted that strong turbulence can arise when @xmath62 , provided that @xmath63 . in strong turbulence energy cascades to smaller  @xmath49 to a greater extent than in weak turbulence , but the primary direction of energy flow in  @xmath64-space is still to larger  @xmath5 , as discussed in the next section .",
    "in order to develop an analytical model , it is convenient to work in terms of the fourier transforms of the fluctuating @xmath54 fields , given by @xmath65 the three - dimensional power spectrum  @xmath66 is defined by the equation @xmath67 where @xmath68 denotes an ensemble average .",
    "cylindrical symmetry about  @xmath0 is assumed , so that @xmath69 , where @xmath5 and @xmath70 are the components of @xmath71 perpendicular and parallel to  @xmath0 .",
    "the mean - square velocity associated with @xmath54 fluctuations is then @xmath72    it is assumed that at each value of  @xmath5 there is a parallel wave number @xmath73 such that ( 1 ) the bulk of the @xmath54 fluctuation energy is at @xmath74 and ( 2 ) @xmath75 depends only weakly on  @xmath70 for @xmath74 .",
    "a @xmath54 wavepacket at perpendicular scale @xmath76 then has a correlation length in the direction of the mean field of @xmath77 .",
    "the rms amplitude of the fluctuating elsasser fields at a perpendicular scale @xmath76 , denoted @xmath78 , is given by @xmath79 as described in the section  [ sec : wpc ] , when a @xmath56 wave packet at scale @xmath76 collides with a @xmath54 wave packet at scale @xmath76 , the fractional change in the @xmath56 packet resulting from the collision is approximately @xmath80 the wave number @xmath81 is defined to be the value of @xmath82 for which @xmath83 .",
    "thus , @xmath84      when @xmath85 , the value of @xmath86 is  @xmath58 and a @xmath43 is only weakly affected by a single collision with a @xmath44 wave packet .",
    "each such collision requires a time @xmath87 .",
    "the effects of successive collisions add incoherently , and thus @xmath88 collisions are required for the @xmath43 wave packet to be strongly distorted , and for its energy to pass to smaller scales .",
    "the cascade time @xmath89 for a @xmath43 wave packet at perpendicular scale  @xmath76 is thus roughly @xmath90 similarly , if @xmath91 , then @xmath92 .",
    "when @xmath93 , the value of @xmath94 is  @xmath61 , a @xmath43 is strongly distorted during a single wave packet collision , and the turbulence is strong .",
    "each such collision takes a time @xmath95 . since @xmath96 , @xmath97 similarly , if @xmath98 , then @xmath99 .    the case",
    "@xmath100 ( i.e. , @xmath101 ) is explicitly excluded from the discussion .",
    "initial conditions could in principle be set up in which @xmath100 .",
    "however , the cascade mechanisms described in section  [ sec : parcasc ] will not produce the condition @xmath100 if it is not initially present .",
    "it should be emphasized that in both weak turbulence and strong turbulence , the cascade time is given by the same formula , @xmath102 , which involves the @xmath103 spectrum evaluated only at @xmath104 .      the two basic mechanisms for transferring fluctuation energy to larger  @xmath70 were identified by lithwick , goldreich , & sridhar  ( 2007 ) .",
    "the first of these can be called `` propagation with distortion . ''",
    "suppose a @xmath43 wave packet of perpendicular scale @xmath76 and arbitrarily large initial parallel correlation length begins colliding at @xmath105 with a stream of @xmath44 wave packets of similar perpendicular scale . at time @xmath106 , the leading edge of the @xmath43 wave packet has been distorted substantially by the stream of @xmath44 wave packets , but the trailing portion of the @xmath43 wave packet at distances @xmath107 behind the leading edge has not yet encountered the stream of @xmath44 wave packets . if the parallel correlation length of the  @xmath43 wave packet is initially @xmath108 , then during a time  @xmath89 the @xmath43 wave packet acquires a spatial variation in the direction of the background magnetic field of length scale  @xmath109 .",
    "this process is modeled as diffusion of @xmath54 fluctuation energy in the @xmath70 direction with diffusion coefficient @xmath110 , where @xmath111 and @xmath112 . ``",
    "propagation with distortion '' then leads to a value of @xmath113 of @xmath114 .",
    "the second mechanism identified by lithwick , goldreich , & sridhar  ( 2007 ) can be called `` uncorrelated cascade . ''",
    "consider a @xmath43 wave packet of perpendicular scale  @xmath76 and arbitrarily large parallel correlation length , and consider two points within the wave packet , @xmath115 and @xmath116 , that move with the wave packet at velocity  @xmath117 and are separated by a distance along  @xmath0 of @xmath118 .",
    "the @xmath44 wave packets at perpendicular scale  @xmath76 encountered by the portions of the @xmath43 wave packet at @xmath115 and @xmath116 are then uncorrelated , because @xmath44 wave packets are substantially distorted while propagating between @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "thus , the way in which the @xmath43 wave packet cascades at location  @xmath115 is not correlated with the way in which the  @xmath43 wave packet cascades at location  @xmath116 .",
    "if the parallel correlation length of the  @xmath43 wave packet is initially  @xmath119 , then wave - packet collisions introduce a spatial variation along  @xmath0 into the @xmath43 wave packet of length scale  @xmath120 during a time  @xmath89 .",
    "again , we model this as diffusion of @xmath54 fluctuation energy in the @xmath70 direction with @xmath110 and @xmath121 , but now @xmath122",
    ". `` uncorrelated cascade '' thus leads to a @xmath70-diffusion coefficient of  @xmath123 .",
    "accounting for both mechanisms , one can write @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the larger of @xmath126 and @xmath127 . if @xmath128 , then @xmath43 energy diffuses in  @xmath70 primarily through the `` uncorrelated cascade '' mechanism , while @xmath44 energy diffuses in  @xmath70 primarily through the `` propagation with distortion cascade '' mechanism .",
    "the phenomenology described in the preceding sections is encapsulated by the following nonlinear advection - diffusion equation , @xmath129 where @xmath130 is shorthand for @xmath131 , @xmath132 and @xmath133 are dimensionless constants of order unity , and @xmath134 and @xmath135 are forcing and damping terms , respectively . the first term on the right - hand side of equation  ( [ eq : fppm ] ) represents advection of fluctuation energy to larger  @xmath5 , while the second term represents diffusion of fluctuation energy to larger  @xmath136 .",
    "the quantity @xmath137 is an effective cascade time at perpendicular scale  @xmath76 .",

    "wave - reflection is more efficient at lower frequencies ( velli 1993 ) , so if there is a range of wave frequencies at each  @xmath5 , the energy - weighted average frequency of inward waves would tend to be somewhat lower than that of the outward waves .",
    "this suggests that at the outer scale the parallel correlation length  @xmath322 of the @xmath44 fluctuations is somewhat larger than the value of  @xmath322 for the @xmath43 fluctuations . however , given equation  ( [ eq : chicorona ] ) , the @xmath43 fluctuations imprint their parallel correlation length on the @xmath44 fluctuations during a single turnover time @xmath292 , as argued in section  [ sec : unequal ] .",

    "this heating is that low - frequency alfvn waves are launched by turbulent motions of field - line footpoints in the photosphere , that some of these waves are reflected , and that interactions between oppositely directed alfvn wave packets in the corona causes the wave energy to cascade to small scales and dissipate ( matthaeus et  al  1999 , 2002 ; dmitruk et  al  2001 , 2002 ; cranmer & van ballegooijen 2005 , 2007 ; verdini & velli 2007 ) . in one version of this model ,",

    "thus , for waves with a period @xmath337  minute , equations  ( [ eq : wpwmra ] ) , ( [ eq : chicorona ] ) , and  ( [ eq : taucorona ] ) give @xmath338  minutes . on the other hand ,",
    "the alfvn speed in a coronal hole at  @xmath339 is  @xmath340  km / s ( cranmer & van ballegooijen 2005 ) , and the time for an alfvn wave to travel from the coronal base out to @xmath314 is 4 - 6 minutes .",

    "much of the discussion of the inertial - range power spectrum of solar - wind turbulence has focused on the question of whether the spectral index is closer to the kolmogorov ( 1941 ) value of  @xmath342 or the iroshnikov - kraichnan value of  @xmath343 ( iroshnikov  1963 , kraichnan  1965 ) .",

    "the condition under which it is valid to treat the solar - wind fluctuations at a some  @xmath300 with an observed  @xmath389 as homogeneous turbulence with the same @xmath389 is that the cascade time at the outer scale @xmath391 be much smaller than the time @xmath392 for turbulent structures to be advected a distance  @xmath300 , where @xmath347 is the solar wind speed .",

    "the principal difference between this paper and  lgs07 lies in our treatment of the cascade time for the dominant fluctuation type ,  @xmath43 . lgs07",
    "argue that if @xmath406 , @xmath98 , and @xmath211 , then the shearing applied by @xmath44 wave packets on a @xmath43 wave packet at perpendicular scale  @xmath76 is coherent over a time  @xmath407 , which greatly exceeds the time @xmath408 required for a @xmath43 and @xmath44 wave packet at perpendicular scale @xmath76 to pass through each other .",

    "let us call these hypothetical magnetic field lines the `` @xmath43 field lines , '' and let us consider a @xmath43 wave packet of perpendicular scale  @xmath76 and parallel scale @xmath410 , where @xmath411 .",
    "let us work in a frame of reference that moves at speed  @xmath40 in the  @xmath17 direction along with the  @xmath43 fluctuations .",
    "let us also take an initial snapshot of the turbulence at @xmath105 and trace out all of the `` @xmath43 field lines '' that pass through our wave packet .",
    "the volume filled by these @xmath43  field lines is the `` source region '' from which the @xmath44 wavepackets encountered by our @xmath43 wave packet originate .",
    "if we wait one crossing time @xmath412 and take a new snapshot of the turbulence , then at any given location the @xmath43 fluctuations will not have changed very much , since @xmath413 . however , if we trace out the new @xmath43 field lines passing through our wave packet , the volume that is filled by these new @xmath43 field lines will differ substantially from the initial source region at distances  @xmath414 from our wave packet due to the rapid divergence of neighboring field lines in mhd turbulence .",
    "in other words , small local changes in @xmath43 lead to large changes in the connectivity of the @xmath43 field lines .    to see this ,",
    "let the @xmath43 field line that passes through some point  @xmath415 in our wave packet at  @xmath105 be called `` field line  @xmath416 . ''",
    "let the @xmath43 field line that passes through point  @xmath415 at @xmath417 be called `` field line  @xmath418 . '' as before",
    ", let us work in a frame of reference that moves at speed  @xmath40 in the  @xmath17 direction . field lines  @xmath416 and  @xmath418 are fixed curves , since they are traced out within two snapshots of the turbulence . if we follow field line  @xmath418 for a distance  @xmath419 , it will separate from field line  @xmath416 by some small distance  @xmath420 that is  @xmath421 . if we continue to follow field line  @xmath418 ,",
    "its separation from field line  @xmath416 is analogous to the separation of two neighboring field lines within a single snapshot of the turbulence .",
    "as shown by narayan & medvedev  ( 2001 ) , chandran & maron  ( 2004 ) , and maron , chandran , & blackman  ( 2004 ) , if a pair of field lines is separated by a distance  @xmath422 at one location , then the distance the field - line pair must be followed before it separates by a distance  @xmath76 is a few times the parallel size of an eddy of perpendicular size  @xmath76 - i.e. , a few times  @xmath423 .",
    "it turns out that the particular value of @xmath420 has little effect unless one considers the ( irrelevant ) case in which @xmath424 where @xmath425 is large and @xmath426 is the perpendicular dissipation scale .",
    "( chandran & maron 2004 ) this is because within the inertial range the amount of magnetic shear increases towards small scales ; therefore , if @xmath420 is made very small , then the distance one has to follow the field - line pair in order for  @xmath420 to double becomes very small .",
    "thus , as a result of the rapid divergence of neighboring field lines in mhd turbulence , the `` source region '' of our @xmath43 wave packet at @xmath427 differs substantially from the source region at @xmath105 at distances @xmath428 from our wave packet . because the @xmath44 fluctuations vary rapidly in the direction perpendicular to the magnetic field , the @xmath44 wave packets encountered by our @xmath43 wave packet will decorrelate on a time scale of order the crossing time @xmath429 due to the time evolution of the source region .",
    "it should noted that there are two unexplained aspects of lgs07 s model , as pointed out by beresnyak & lazarian  ( 2007 ) .",
    "the first concerns the nature of the transition from the weak - turbulence regime  ( @xmath91 and @xmath211 ) to the strong - turbulence regime  ( @xmath276 and @xmath211 ) . in lgs07",
    "s analysis , as one passes from the weak regime to the strong regime , the coherence time for the straining of the @xmath43 wave packets by  @xmath44 wave packets increases by a factor of @xmath430 and the energy cascade time  @xmath89 decreases by a factor of  @xmath223 .",
    "it is not clear why these large changes should occur across the transition scale .",
    "the second issue is that lgs07 find that @xmath431 and @xmath432 regardless of the fractional cross helicity . since the ratio @xmath433 is independent of wavenumber , it is not clear how pinning could occur in their model , or how the spectra would behave near the dissipation scale .",
    "beresnyak & lazarian ( 2007 ) ( hereafter bl07 ) have published an online article on strong mhd turbulence with cross helicity .",
    "the following discussion refers to the version of their article that is available electronically as of the writing of this paper .",
    "the work of bl07 is similar to this paper in that both studies take the dominant fluctuation type , @xmath43 , to undergo a weak cascade .",
    "also , equations  ( [ eq : defapam ] ) through ( [ eq : olkp1 ] ) of this paper are equivalent to their equation  ( 5 ) , except for the fact that they take the parallel correlation lengths of @xmath43 and @xmath44 to differ by a constant multiplicative factor when a power - law solution for the spectra is assumed .",
    "( the possibility of more general solutions is claimed by bl07 . ) on the other hand , there are a number of significant differences between this paper and beresnyak & lazarian s ( 2007 ) work .",
    "they argue that for the @xmath43 fluctuations , the dominant nonlinear interactions are between fluctuations with comparable parallel correlation lengths and different perpendicular correlation lengths , whereas for the @xmath44 fluctuations the dominant interactions are between fluctuations with comparable perpendicular scales . here , it is argued that for both @xmath43 and @xmath44 the dominant interactions are between fluctuations with similar perpendicular scales .",
    "when @xmath434 and @xmath98 , their figure  1 suggests that the parallel correlation length of  @xmath43 fluctuations can be less than the parallel correlation length of  @xmath44 fluctuations .",
    "it is argued in section  [ sec : unequal ] of this paper that this can not be the case , because the @xmath43 fluctuations will imprint their parallel correlation length onto the  @xmath44 fluctuations .",
    "they argue that the scalings given by equations  ( [ eq : defapam ] ) and ( [ eq : olkp1 ] ) [ equivalently , their equation  ( 5 ) ] can not apply if the parallel correlation lengths of the @xmath43 and @xmath44 fluctuations are equal , arguing that this would require @xmath435 , whereas in this paper the ratio  @xmath178 depends upon the slopes of the power spectra , as in weak turbulence .",
    "they argue that if the @xmath43 and @xmath44 fluctuations are driven with the same parallel correlation length at the outer scale , there will be a non - power law part of the solution at large scales that will transition at smaller scales to a power law solution with @xmath222 and @xmath436 both @xmath437 and @xmath438 .",
    "in contrast , in this paper a power - law solution starting at the outer scale is obtained with different scalings for @xmath439 and @xmath436 , and with @xmath440 growing more slowly than  @xmath441 .",
    "this paper proposes a new phenomenology for strong , anisotropic , incompressible mhd turbulence with cross helicity and introduces a nonlinear advection - diffusion equation [ equation  ( [ eq : fppm ] ) ] to describe the time evolution of the anisotropic power spectra of the @xmath43 and @xmath44 fluctuations .",
    "it is found that in steady state the one - dimensional power spectra of the energetically dominant @xmath43 fluctuations , @xmath442 , is steeper than @xmath1 , and that @xmath442 becomes increasingly steep as the fractional cross helicity  @xmath389 increases .",
    "increasing @xmath389 also increases the energy cascade time of the @xmath43 fluctuations , reduces the turbulent heating power for a fixed fluctuation energy , and increases the anisotropy of the fluctuations at small scales .",
    "although most of the discussion has focused on forced , steady - state turbulence , the results of this paper can also be applied to decaying turbulence .",
    "for example , equations  ( [ eq : tau1 ] ) and ( [ eq : tau2 ] ) can be used to estimate the time scale for turbulence to decay .",
    "the resulting prediction is that if the fluctuations are initially excited with @xmath443 and with comparable parallel correlation lengths at the outer scale , then the turbulence will decay into a state in which  @xmath44 fluctuations are absent , as in the earlier work of dobrowolny , mangeney , & veltri ( 1980 ) , grappin et  al  ( 1983 ) , and lithwick & goldreich ( 2003 ) .",
    "this `` maximally aligned '' state will then be free from nonlinear interactions , and will persist for long times until it damps via linear dissipation .",
