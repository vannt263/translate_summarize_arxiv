    "let us give an account of the existing literature and of related problems .",
    "existence and uniqueness of a strong solution for system ( a ) was first obtained in saisho and tanaka @xcite with @xmath37 .",
    "extensions to @xmath38 and to @xmath39 are done in fradon and rlly @xcite , fradon , rlly and tanemura @xcite .",

    "the construction of the stationary process ( i.e. , starting from the invariant measure ) can also be performed by using dirichlet forms theory . actually , @xmath18 intersected with any ball @xmath41 is a lipschitz domain ( see the ) so that one can use results in bass and hsu @xcite , chen , fitzsimmons and williams @xcite , fukushima and tomisaki @xcite to build the hunt process naturally associated to the dirichlet form ( see , e.g. , fukushima , oshima and takeda @xcite for the theory of dirichlet forms ) @xmath42 it is then enough to let @xmath43 go to infinity and show conservativeness of the obtained process which is equivalent to non - explosion .",
    "this is standard .",
    "the solution of ( a ) built by using stochastic calculus do coincide with the hunt process associated to the dirichlet form @xmath44 obtained for @xmath45 .",
    "some properties , like the decomposition of the boundary into a non - polar and a polar parts or the girsanov s like structure are discussed in chen _",

    "such a construction is performed in osada @xcite , tanemura @xcite .",
    "let us recall also some regularity of the processes and their associated semi - groups which we will need in the sequel . for @xmath46 ,",
    "we denote by @xmath47 the transition kernel of the process @xmath48 starting from @xmath49 at time @xmath50 .",
    "it is well known that for all @xmath51 , @xmath47 is absolutely continuous with respect to the lebesgue measure restricted to @xmath52 ( in particular does not charge the boundary @xmath53 ) .",
    "in addition the density @xmath54 is smooth as a function of the two variables @xmath49 and @xmath55 in @xmath56 .",
    "this follows from standard elliptic estimates ( as in bass and hsu @xcite ) or from the use of malliavin calculus as explained in cattiaux @xcite .",
    "furthermore , this density kernel extends smoothly up to the smooth part of the boundary ( see cattiaux @xcite ) .",
    "but since the domain is ( locally ) lipschitz , the potential theoretic tools of bass and hsu @xcite sections 3 and 4 can be used to show that @xmath57 extends continuously to @xmath58 .",
    "actually section  4 in bass and hsu @xcite is written for bounded lipschitz domain but extends easily to our situation by localizing the dirichlet form as we mentioned earlier and using conservativeness ( of course the function is no more uniformly continuous ) .",
    "in particular , the process is feller ( actually strong feller thanks to fukushima and tomisaki @xcite ) .",
    "comparison with the killed process at the boundary shows that for any @xmath59 and any starting @xmath51 , @xmath60 for any @xmath61 ( see , e.g. , ( 3.15 ) and ( 3.16 ) in bass and hsu @xcite and use repeatedly the chapman ",

    "another classical consequence is the uniqueness of the invariant measure ( since all invariant measures are actually equivalent ) up to a multiplicative constant .",
    "since @xmath25 is deduced from @xmath13 by a smooth linear transformation , similar statements are available for @xmath25 in @xmath34 .",
    "in particular , @xmath25 is a feller process satisfying the local dobrushin condition with a unique invariant probability measure .",
    "looking at long time behavior of such systems is not only interesting by itself but relates , as @xmath69 ( low temperature regime in statistical mechanics ) , to the following _ finite packing problem _ : what is the shape of a cluster of @xmath3 spheres  with equal radii @xmath4  minimizing their quadratic energy , that is , their second moment about their center of mass .",
    "( for a review of different questions on finite packing , see the recent monograph br \" oczky @xcite . )",
    "this problem , in spite of its simple statement and its numerous useful applications , remains mainly open .",
    "even for @xmath70 ( so called _ penny - packings _ ) , only the case @xmath71 was solved by temesvri  @xcite . for more pennies",
    ", the optimal configurations are known only among the specific class of hexagonal packings ( chow @xcite ) . for @xmath72 ,",
    "one finds in sloane _",
    "@xcite a description of the putatively optimal arrangements until @xmath73 . for the case of infinitely many spheres and their celebrated densest packing",
    ", we refer to conway and sloane @xcite or to fradon and rlly @xcite , pages  99100 , for recent references and a more complete discussion .",
    "indeed , as @xmath69 , the invariant measure @xmath35 concentrates on the set of configurations with minimal quadratic energy that is , the set latexmath:[\\[\\ee_{\\mathrm{min } } = \\biggl\\{{\\mathbf{y}}\\in d ' ; v({\\mathbf{y}}):=\\sum _ { i , j } |y_i - y_j|^2 = \\inf_{{\\mathbf{z}}\\in\\mathcal d ' } \\sum_{i , j }    @xmath40 and @xmath75 .",
    "so looking simultaneously at large @xmath50 and large @xmath12 furnishes some _ simulated annealing algorithm _ for the uniform measure on @xmath76 ( see theorem  [ th_exp_erg_3 ] for the case @xmath77 ) .    a similar ( but different )",
    "algorithmic point of view is discussed in the recent paper diaconis , lebeau and michel @xcite , where the problem under discussion is : _ how can we place _ randomly _ @xmath3 hard balls of radius @xmath40 in a given large ball ( or hypercube ) ? _",
    "according to the introduction of diaconis , lebeau and michel @xcite this problem is the origin of metropolis algorithm .",
    "the authors relate the asymptotics of the spectral gap of a discrete metropolis algorithm to the first neumann eigenvalue ( called @xmath78 ) for the laplace operator in @xmath34 intersected with a large hypercube ( see their theorem  4.6 ) .",
    "there are several methods to attack the study of long time behavior for markov processes . in this paper",
    ", we will restrict ourselves to exponential ( or geometric ) ergodicity .",
    "moreover , we will try to give some controls on the rate of exponential ergodicity .",
    "let us first recall some definitions .",
    "[ defergod ] a markov process @xmath79 with transition distribution @xmath80 and invariant measure @xmath81 is said to be exponentially ergodic if there exists @xmath82 such that for all initial condition @xmath83 , @xmath84    if the function @xmath85 is @xmath86-integrable , the previous extends to any initial distribution @xmath86 .",
    "our main result reads as follows .",
    "[ thmmain ] consider a system of @xmath3 hard balls in @xmath22 submitted to the dynamics described by _",
    "( a)_. if @xmath0 , the process @xmath25 of their relative positions viewed from their center of mass , described by the system _ ( b ) _ , is exponentially ergodic .",
    "remark that , if we are only interested in the convergence of the ball system to the set of configurations with minimal energy in the large attraction regime , the quantity of interest reduces to the @xmath87-valued system of the distances between the centers of the @xmath3 balls and their center of mass .",
    "its rate of convergence to equilibrium is much faster that those of the @xmath88-valued process @xmath25 . for two balls ,",
    "the difference is explicit when comparing theorems [ thm2 ] and [ thm2bis ] in the next section .",
    "exponential ergodicity is connected to the existence of an exponential coupling , as explained in kulik @xcite , and is strongly dependent on the existence of exponential moments for the hitting time of compact subsets .",
    "this method can be traced back to veretennikov @xcite .",
    "let us give a precise statement taken from kulik @xcite , theorem  2.2 .",
    "[ thmalex ] suppose that the process @xmath79 satisfies the local dobrushin condition .",
    "assume that we can find a real valued function @xmath89 and a compact set @xmath90 and positive constants @xmath91 such that :    @xmath89 is larger than 1 and @xmath92 as @xmath93 ,    there exists @xmath94 and @xmath95 such that for all initial condition @xmath83 , @xmath96 where @xmath97 denotes the hitting time of @xmath62 ,    @xmath98 as @xmath99 .",
    "then the process @xmath79 is exponentially ergodic .",
    "though the result is only stated in the case @xmath100 in kulik @xcite , the method extends to any @xmath95 without difficulty .",
    "it is instructive to compare this result with other forms of _ harris - type _",
    "theorems for exponential ergodicity , frequently used in the literature .",
    "typically such theorems assume an irreducibility of the process on a set @xmath62 ( in our case this is the local dobrushin condition ) and its recurrence .",
    "recurrence assumption is formulated usually in the terms of the generator @xmath101 of the process , like the foster ",
    "lyapunov condition , see , for example , meyn and tweedie @xcite , @xmath102 in theorem  [ thmalex ] , assumptions ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) can be interpreted as a recurrence assumption , but since the generator @xmath101 is not involved therein , we call it an _ integral _ lyapunov condition , while  ( [ foster ] ) is a _ differential _ one . in our framework , because of the presence of several local time terms in ( b ) , it is very difficult to find a lyapunov function which satisfy ( [ foster ] ) but we succeeded in showing that the quadratic energy of the system , @xmath103 , satisfies the more tractable integral lyapunov condition presented in theorem  [ thmalex ] .",
    "it should be noted that , unfortunately , the exponential rate of convergence @xmath104 in theorem  [ thmalex ] is difficult to express explicitly in a compact form , as it depends on @xmath105 but also on other constants connected with the behavior of the process , in particular a quantitative version of the local dobrushin condition in @xmath62 . for an example of such an explicit expression ,",
    "we refer the reader to the end of section  3.2 in kulik @xcite .",
    "similar formulae should appear in the framework of theorem  [ thmalex ] too , but in order not to overextend the exposition we do not analyse it here in a very detailed way .",
    "another classical approach of exponential ergodicity is the spectral approach , that is , the existence of a _",
    "spectral gap_. recall the well known equivalence    [ poinc ] pick @xmath106 .",
    "for any @xmath107 , @xmath108 if and only if @xmath81 satisfies the following poincar inequality @xmath109    when @xmath81 is not only invariant but reversible , it is known that both approaches coincide , that is , the following theorem holds .",
    "[ thmequiv ] the process @xmath79 is exponentially ergodic if and only if @xmath81 satisfies some poincar inequality .",
    "furthermore if @xmath81 satisfies a poincar inequality , we may choose @xmath110 , while if the process is exponentially ergodic we may choose @xmath111 .",
    "the difficult part of this equivalence ( i.e. , exponential ergodicity implies poincar ) is shown in bakry , cattiaux and guillin @xcite , theorem  2.1 , or kulik @xcite , theorem  3.4 .",
    "the converse direction is explained in cattiaux , guillin and zitt @xcite .    as it was pointed out in details in the recent papers",
    "kulik @xcite and cattiaux , guillin and zitt  @xcite ( which despite the dates of publication were achieved simultaneously ) , these two formulations of exponential ergodicity are also equivalent to the existence of exponential moments for the hitting time of a compact set , in the case of usual diffusion processes . for the reflected processes we are looking at",
    ", some extra work is necessary .    in this paper",
    ", we use the second approach related to theorem  [ thmequiv ] to analyse the 2-ball system in the next section , and the first method presented in theorem  [ thmalex ] to prove the ergodicity of the 3-ball system developed in the third section .",
    "for that system , we prove geometric ergodicity in theorem  [ th_exp_erg_3 ] , but during the proof ( see , e.g. , the statement of proposition  [ prop_sect_3 ] ) we show that the total quadratic energy @xmath103 is a lyapunov function in the sense of the function @xmath89 of theorem  [ thmalex ] .",
    "the proof is quite intricate .",
    "the key idea is to study and control the hitting time of a _ cluster _ , that is , a set of relatively small quadratic energy .",
    "it turns out that the most practical way to describe the triangle configuration built by the three centers is to look at the medians of this triangle .",
    "the reason is that one has to control a single local time term .",
    "we expect that for any @xmath112 the system of @xmath3 stochastic hard balls will exhibit the same principal behavior : the hitting time of a ( properly defined ) cluster should verify an analogue of proposition  [ prop_sect_3 ] which would yield an exponential convergence rate to the invariant measure .",
    "however , the proof for @xmath77 uses specific and comparatively simple geometry of a 3-ball system : essentially , there exists only one type of non - clustered configuration which is _ bad _ in the sense that some collision could happen and increase a local time term : two balls are close , while one is distant . for greater @xmath3",
    "this method does not work straightforwardly , and one should take into account the more complicated structure of _ sub - clusters _ of close balls : the analysis of local time terms , generated by the collisions of the balls in this sub - cluster , is much more delicate .",
    "this is a subject of our further research , and we plan to control the impact of sub - clusters using induction by @xmath3 .",
    "note that the proof of proposition  [ prop_sect_3 ] implicitly contains the induction step from @xmath113 to @xmath77 .    throughout the proofs",
    ", we have tried to trace the constants as precisely as possible , in particular to obtain the convergence rate as an explicit function of @xmath12 .",
    "this goal was achieved completely in the case @xmath113 and partially in the case @xmath77 , where we give explicit estimates on exponential moments of hitting times of clusters .",
    "clearly , these estimates then would yield a bound for the convergence rate , but we do not give it explicitly because of the lack of explicit formula for @xmath104 in theorem  [ thmalex ] .",
    "in this section , we consider the `` baby model '' case @xmath113 .",
    "the relative position of the two balls is described by the @xmath114-valued process @xmath115 which satisfies @xmath116 where @xmath117 is a brownian motion with covariance @xmath118 and @xmath119 is the local time of @xmath25 on the centered sphere with radius @xmath4 , that is , @xmath25 is simply an ornstein  uhlenbeck process outside the ball of radius @xmath4 and normally reflected on the boundary of this ball . in particular",
    "@xmath120 is simply a centered gaussian measure restricted to @xmath121 .",
    "this measure is thus spherically symmetric and radially log - concave , so that one can use the method in bobkov @xcite in order to evaluate the poincar constant .",
