    "the main aim of this work is to achieve better understanding of large annihilation rates observed for many polyatomic molecules @xcite .",
    "in particular , we use an exactly solvable model to verify the prediction @xcite that positron capture into vibrational feshbach resonances ( vfr ) gives rise to a strong enhancement of the annihilation rate .",
    "we also use this model to investigate the dependence of positron binding energy for polyatomics on the size of the molecule .",
    "such binding was postulated in @xcite as a necessary condition for vfrs .",
    "the annihilation rate for positrons in a gas of atoms or molecules can be expressed in terms of an effective number of electrons , @xmath1 , by @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the classical electron radius , @xmath4 is the speed of light and @xmath5 is the number density of the gas .",
    "measurements by paul and saint - pierre in the early sixties @xcite indicated unusually large positron annihilation rates in certain polyatomic molecular gases , with @xmath1 exceeding the actual number of electrons by orders of magnitude .",
    "they speculated that this might be caused by the formation of positron - molecule bound states , and later smith and paul @xcite explored the possibility that the large rates might be caused by a vibrational resonance .",
    "research on the alkanes and similar molecules since that time @xcite uncovered a rapid growth of @xmath1 with the size of the molecule and very strong chemical sensitivity of @xmath1 .",
    "however , only recently a verisimilar physical picture of this phenomenon has begun to emerge @xcite .",
    "these papers put forward a mechanism which is operational for molecules with positive positron affinities , and which involves capture of positrons into vfrs .",
    "recent measurements of annihilation with a positron beam at high resolution ( 25 mev ) @xcite , have shown resonances in the energy dependence of the annihilation rate parameter , @xmath1 , of alkane molecules .",
    "most of the features observed have been unambiguously identified as related to molecular vibrations . in particular , for all alkanes heavier than methane @xmath1 displays a prominent c  h stretch vibrational peak .",
    "the experiments found that the magnitude of @xmath1 in the peak increases rapidly with the size of the molecule ( similarly to the increase in @xmath1 observed with thermal room - temperature positrons @xcite ) .",
    "another remarkable finding concerns the position of the c  h peak . while for ethane its energy is close to the mode energy of c  h stretch vibrations ( @xmath6 ev ) , for heavier alkanes the resonances appear at an energy @xmath7 mev lower for each carbon added .",
    "this downward shift provides evidence of positron binding to molecules .",
    "the binding energies observed increase from about 14 mev in c@xmath8h@xmath9 to 205 mev in c@xmath10h@xmath11 .",

    ", calculations have been done using a model positron - molecule correlation potential in a fixed nuclei approximation @xcite .",
    "such calculations often provide a reasonable description of low - energy positron - molecule scattering . however , their results , almost without exception , underestimate experimental @xmath1 , in some cases by an order of magnitude .",

    "in this model the interaction of the positron with each of the atoms is parametrised using the atomic value of the scattering length .",
    "it is applicable at low energies when the de broglie wavelength of the projectile is much larger than the typical size of the scatterers .",
    "once zrp is adopted , the problem of the positron - molecule interaction , including the vibrational dynamics , can be solved practically exactly . in the previous paper @xcite the interaction between the atoms in the dimer",
    "was treated using the harmonic approximation ( ha ) , which allowed the vibrational coupling matrix elements to be calculated analytically .",
    "a parabolic potential does not describe well the shallow asymmetric interatomic potential for a weakly bound van der waals molecule such as kr@xmath0 . in this work we use the morse potential to provide a better description of the molecular interaction .",
    "it is a good approximation to the best potential available for kr@xmath0 @xcite .",

    "the first vibrational excitation energy of the @xmath35kr@xmath0 complex , @xmath94 , for mp is 3.15  mev , while in ha it is 2.82  mev .",
    "thus , mp calculations predict a `` stiffening '' of the vibrational motion of the complex in comparison with that of kr@xmath0 .",
