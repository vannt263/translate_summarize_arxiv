    "indeed , since the even degree invariants determine @xmath38 up to sign , after replacing @xmath40 with @xmath41 if necessary , the condition holds for @xmath38 if it holds for the even degree generators .",
    "therefore , one can reduce the former condition on linear equivalence to test it only for the four generator invariants of even degree . in the literature",
