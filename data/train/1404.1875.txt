    "type@xmath1iii bursts have been subject of theoretical , observational and numerical studies .",
    "the first detailed theory of the type@xmath1iii emission invoked coherent plasma waves , generated by a stream of fast particles @xcite , which are due to rayleigh and combination scattering at @xmath3 and @xmath4 subsequently transformed into radio waves .",
    "stochastic growth of the density irregularities was invoked in order to produce stochastically generated clumpy langmuir waves , where the ambient density perturbations cause the beam to fluctuate around marginal stability @xcite .",

    "@xcite it was found that the non@xmath1gyrotropic beam excites electromagnetic radiation by @xmath5@xmath1space drift ( or in other words wave refraction ) while propagating along the 1@xmath1dimensional spatial domain throughout the decreasing plasma density profile .",
    "the analysis presented here reveals a new signal evident in the perpendicular components of the electromagnetic field in the scenario of the non@xmath1gyrotropic emission : a wave propagating backwards from the beam front .",
    "investigation of the features of this wave component , its characterisation and its generation mechanism is topic of the presented numerical study .",
    "the background magnetic field was varied in order to prove the backwards travelling wave component s frequency to be proportional to the imposed background magnetic field .",
    "analysis of the @xmath5@xmath1space drift shows that the wave fits well to the whistler dispersion curve . the mechanism which generates the backwards propagating whistler waves",
    "is found to correspond to the normal doppler - shifted relativistic resonance .",

    "emission of the whistlers through normal doppler - shifted resonance has been reported in a laboratory experiment , where the excited whistlers propagate opposite to the beam direction and their phase and group velocities are characteristic of the beam@xmath1whistler resonant cyclotron coupling @xcite .    the numerical model is described in sec .",
    "ii . in sec . iii the general evolution of the system and the evidence for the backwards propagating waves are presented , followed by their characterisation and identification through altering the background magnetic field .",
