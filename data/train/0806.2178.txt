    "in traditional charge - based electronics , the spin degree of freedom has not been fully explored . until recently , the scientists found that spin control and manipulation in the nano - scale can enhance operational speed and integration density of conventional charge - based electronic devices.@xcite in order to successfully use the spin degree of freedom of electrons in the conventional semiconductor devices , one has to have a good control , manipulation , and detection of the spin and its flow in nano - devices .",
    "this emerging field called spintronics is a new sub - discipline of condensed matter physics , and it is growing rapidly and generating great interests in recent years.@xcite    it is well known that the spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) plays an important role in the emerging field of semiconductor spintronics .",
    "soi couples the spin degree of freedom of electrons to their orbital motions , thereby giving rise to a useful way to manipulate and control the spin of electron by an external electric field or a gate voltage .",
    "soi is an intrinsic interaction having its origin from relativistic effects that can be quite significant in some semiconductors.@xcite for instance experiments show that the significant soi indeed exist in some semiconductors,@xcite e.g. rashba soi was found in the ingaas / inalas heterostructure or inas quantum wells,@xcite and both the rashba and dresselhaus soi were detected in various iii - v material based 2d structures at room temperature,@xcite to just name a few .",
    "moreover , the strengths of these soi have been well modulated by the gate voltage experimentally.@xcite    many interesting effects resulting from soi have been predicted .",
    "for example , using the effect of spin precessions due to the rashba soi , datta and das proposed a spin - transistor more than ten years ago.@xcite by using the rashba soi , a method to efficiently control and manipulate the spin of the electron in the quantum dot has been proposed.@xcite very recently , a very interesting effect , the intrinsic spin hall effect , is theoretically predicted by murakami _ et.al . _ and sinova _ et.al .",
    "_ in a luttinger soi 3d p - doped semiconductor and a rashba soi 2d electron gas,@xcite respectively , that a substantial amount of dissipationless spin current can be generated from the interplay between the electric field and the soi .",
    "since then , the spin hall effect has generated tremendous interests with a great amount of works focusing in the field of spintronics.@xcite on experimental side , two groups by kato _",
    "et al._@xcite and wunderlich _",
    "et al._@xcite have observed the transverse opposite spin accumulations near two edges of their devices when the longitudinal voltage bias is added . in additional ,",
    "a third group by valenzuela and tinkham took the electric measurement of the reciprocal spin hall effect,@xcite and they have observed an induced transverse voltage in a diffusive metallic conductor when a longitudinal net spin current flows through it .    in this paper , we study two closely related subjects that : ( i ) we predict another interesting effect that a persistent spin current without accompanying charge current exists in a coherent mesoscopic semiconductor ring with symplectic symmetry , i.e. , with soi but maintaining the time reversal symmetry ; ( ii ) we examine the issue whether it is needed to redefine the conventional spin current , or in other words , whether the conventional definition of the spin current , @xmath0,@xcite is reasonable in the presence of soi . since these two subjects are closely related , we investigate them together here .",
    "in fact , a few years ago , by using the conventional definition of the spin current rashba has found a nonzero spin current @xmath1 in an infinite two - dimensional system with rashba soi in the thermodynamic equilibrium.@xcite in his opinion , this spin current @xmath1 is not associated with real spin transport , and therefore should be eliminated in calculating the transport current by modifying the conventional definition of the spin current .",
    "after his work , many subsequent work have discussed the definition of the spin current.@xcite so to uncover the physical meaning of the non - zero spin current in the equilibrium system , we must face the question of whether one needs to redefine the spin current .",
    "more than two decades ago , the persistent ( charge ) current in a mesoscopic ring threaded by a magnetic flux has been predicted theoretically,@xcite and later observed experimentally in early 1990s.@xcite it is now well known that the persistent charge current is a pure quantum effect and can sustain without dissipation in the equilibrium case .",
    "there has also been many investigations on the persistent spin current.@xcite for example , in a mesoscopic ring with a crown - shape inhomogeneous magnetic field@xcite or threaded by a magnetic flux@xcite , the persistent spin current has been predicted and is related to the berry s phase .",
    "recently , the persistent spin current carried by bosonic excitations has also been predicted in a heisenberg ring with the magnetic field or in the ferromagnetic material.@xcite the reason that the persistent spin current exists may be explained as follows . due to the magnetic field or the magnetic flux ,",
    "there are persistent flows of both spin up and down electrons . in the absence of soi , this gives rise to the well known persistent charge current . in the presence of soi or magnetic field , the persistent charge current is spin polarized resulting a nonzero persistent spin current .",
    "hence the origin of this persistent spin current is the same as that of persistent charge current so that the persistent spin current always accompanies with a persistent charge current .",
    "recently,@xcite we have reported that a persistent spin current without accompanying charge current ( a pure persistent spin current ) can sustains in a mesoscopic semiconducting ring with soi in the absence of the external magnetic field , magnetic flux , and the magnetic material .",
    "this pure persistent spin current is induced solely by soi , which is different with the pervious case . in main part of this paper",
    ", we will give detailed discussions on the existence of the persistent spin current and the behavior of the spin current .",
    "another motivation of the present paper is to study the definition of the spin current in the presence of soi .",
    "in fact , the spin current is the most important physical quantity in the field of the spintronics .",
    "so it is important to give an appropriate definition of the spin current .",
    "this problem , the discussion of the definition of the spin current , is first tackled by rashba . in a recent work by rashba,@xcite he found a nonzero spin current @xmath1 in an infinite two - dimensional system with rashba soi even in the equilibrium case by using the conventional definition of the spin current,@xcite @xmath2 .",
    "so he questioned the correctness of the conventional definition of the spin current and suggested that the conventional definition should be modified to eliminate the equilibrium non - zero spin current .",
    "besides the nonzero spin current in the equilibrium , there are others problems with the conventional definition : ( 1 ) the spin current is not conserved using the conventional definition in the presence of soi or / and the magnetic field .",
    "this is because the operator @xmath3 does not commute with the hamiltonian @xmath4 when the system has soi or / and the magnetic field .",
    "the onsager relation is violated using the conventional definition .",
    "after rashba s work , many subsequent papers have discussed the definition of the spin current.@xcite for instance , sun and xie suggested that in addition to the conventional ( linear ) spin current @xmath5 , one needs to introduce the angular spin current @xmath6 to describe the rotational motion ( precession ) of a spin,@xcite because the spin operator is a vector .",
    "similar to the conventional linear spin current , the angular spin current can also induce an electric field .",
    "al._@xcite gave a new definition of the spin current with @xmath7 , in which the operator of the spin current @xmath8 is the derivative of the whole @xmath9 .",
    "compared with the conventional definition of the spin current , it has an extra term @xmath10 in this new definition .",
    "wang _ et .",
    "al._@xcite pointed out that the spin current is automatically conserved using the conventional definition of the spin current if the spin - spin interaction is included . in the sec .",
    "vi in the present paper , we will explore the definition of the spin current .    in this paper ,",
    "we first give physical argument as to why the persistent spin current can exist in equilibrium . in order to show that the persistent spin current should exist in the mesoscopic system with solely soi , four physical pictures or physical argument from the different aspects",
    "will be discussed : ( i ) from the picture of electric and magnetic correspondence to analyze the driving force of persistent spin current ( in fig.1a and fig.1b ) ; ( ii ) from the point of view of the spin berry phase ; ( iii ) from the comparison among four effects , the hall effect , spin hall effect , the persistent ( charge ) current , and the persistent spin current ( see fig.2 ) ; ( iv ) from the point of view of the motion of the spin .",
    "as an example , we then consider a semiconducting soi - normal hybrid mesoscopic ring and show that indeed a pure persistent spin current can emerge with solely soi .",
    "we note that currently there is no consensus on the definition for the spin current in the presence of soi . in order to avoid the problem of the definition of the spin current ,",
    "here we first use the following approach : we consider a mesoscopic hybrid ring that consists of a rashba soi s region and a normal region without soi as shown in fig.1c .",
    "since there is no spin - flip in this normal region , the definition of the spin current in that region is without controversy .",
    "so we can calculate and study the spin current in the normal region , and to make sure that the persistent spin current indeed can be induced solely by soi . after making sure the existence of the persistent spin current , we then to investigate the definition of the spin current .",
    "we point out that the non - zero spin current in the equilibrium system in the presence of the soi is the persistent spin current .",
    "it describes a real spin motion and has the physical meaning , so this spin current should be kept as it is .",
    "( ii ) . since spin operator is a vector , it has the rotational motion ( precession ) due to the soi in accompany with the particle translational motion , so in general spin current is not a conserved quantity .",
    "in fact , there are experimental indications that the spin current is not conserved.@xcite on the other hand , in certain cases if one includes the strong spin - spin interaction into the hamiltonian , the spin current obtained from the conventional definition will be conserved automatically .",
    "it is well known that the onsager relation holds under certain condition .",
    "we will show that for the spin system , this condition does not satisfy .",
    "we think that the above three points are actually the intrinsic properties of spin transport so we feel that the conventional definition of the spin current need not to be modified.@xcite    in addition , we also address the following issues .",
    "the relation between the persistent spin current and transport spin current .",
    "we note that they can not be distinguished from each other in the coherent part of the device .",
    "( 2 ) . in calculating the persistent linear and angular spin currents in the soi s region of the soi - normal hybrid ring , we find that the persistent spin current still exists in the soi s region even if the whole ring has the soi .",
    "so the normal part is not necessary for generating the persistent spin current .",
    "the measurement of the persistent spin current is discussed , we suggest that this persistent spin current can be observed by detecting its induced electric fields . ( 4 ) . including the spin - spin interaction in the ring , we find that the persistent spin current calculated using the conventional definition is a conserved quantity .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we provide physical arguments and physical pictures from four different aspects to show the existence of the persistent spin current . in section iii",
    ", we consider a soi - normal hybrid mesoscopic semiconducting ring device to show that indeed a pure persistent spin current can emerge in the normal region where the definition of the spin current is without controversy .",
    "then the effect of sharp interface between the soi s region and the normal region , and the relation of the persistent spin current and the transport spin current , are discussed in section iv and v , respectively . in section",
    "vi , we study the definition of the spin current . in section vii ,",
    "the persistent linear and angular spin current in the soi s region as well some conserved quantities in the hybrid ring device are explored . in section viii , we investigate electric fields induced by the persistent spin current .",
    "this provides a way to detect the persistent spin current . in section ix",
    ", we discuss the effect of spin - spin interaction in the ring which makes the persistent spin current conserved .",
    "finally , section x summarizes the results of our work .",
    "in this section , we argue that the pure persistent spin current ( without accompanying charge current ) should exist in the mesoscopic semiconducting ring device with the soi . in particularly , this pure persistent spin current can be induced solely by soi even at zero magnetic flux or magnetic field .",
    "we examine this new effect from following four different aspects .      for the persistent charge current in the mesoscopic ring ,",
    "the magnetic flux or magnetic field acts like a `` driving force '' , so one naturally looks for the analogous `` driving force '' in the spin case . to discuss this question ,",
    "let us consider two devices .",
    "the first device consists of a mesoscopic ring ( without soi ) where a magnetic atom with a magnetic dipole moment is placed at the center of the ring ( see fig.1a ) . in the second device",
    "the magnetic atom is replaced by a charged atom , e.g. , an ion ( see fig.1b ) .",
    "the magnetic atom produces a vector potential @xmath11 on the perimeter of the ring which drives the persistent charge current . by analogy ,",
    "a charged atom which produces a scalar potential @xmath12 on the perimeter of the same ring should drive a persistent spin current.@xcite since the presence of this ionic center generates a soi in the relativistic limit , we expect that this soi which plays the role of the spin `` driving force '' will induce a pure persistent spin current .",
    "in addition , from the picture of electric and magnetic correspondence , the persistent charge current in the ring should also change into the persistent spin current , when the center magnetic atom ( in fig.1a ) is substituted by a charged atom ( in fig.1b ) .",
    "second , the existence of the pure persistent spin current can be examined from another point of view using the spin berry phase.@xcite this physical arguments has been provided in detail in our previous letter ( see the 4-th paragraph in ref.@xcite ) , so we omit the discussion here .      in the following ,",
    "let us compare the four effects : the hall effect , the spin hall effect , the persistent charge current , and the persistent spin current , from which one expect that the persistent spin current should exist in the mesoscopic ring with solely soi .",
    "\\(i ) we consider a four - terminal device with a bias @xmath13 added between the terminals 1 and 3 and a perpendicular magnetic field @xmath14 ( as shown in fig.2a ) . for this system",
    "there exists the hall effect , and a charge current is induced in the transverse terminals 2 and 4 .",
    "( ii ) replacing the perpendicular magnetic field by the soi ( see fig.2b ) , a spin current emerges ( instead of the charge current ) in the transversal terminals 2 and 4 .",
    "this is the spin hall effect predicted recently and generated tremendous interests.@xcite ( iii ) consider a mesoscopic ring with a perpendicular magnetic field ( see fig.2c ) , a persistent charge current is induced in the ring .",
    "this is the persistent current , which is well known now.@xcite ( iv ) by analogy , a persistent spin current instead of the persistent charge current should be induced when the soi replaces the perpendicular magnetic field ( see fig.2d ) .",
    "let us discuss the hamiltonian in four devices in fig.2 .",
    "( i ) in fig.2a , the hamiltonian is @xmath15 , and there exists the hall effect because of the vector potential @xmath11 .",
    "( ii ) to replace @xmath11 by the rashba soi with @xmath16 , the hall effect change into the spin hall effect , and a spin current instead of the charge current emerges in the terminals 2 and 4 ( see fig.2b ) .",
    "( iii ) in fig.2c , the hamiltonian is @xmath17 , and there exist the persistent charge current in the ring because of the vector potential @xmath11 .",
    "( iv ) by analogy , when @xmath11 is replaced by the rashba soi , a persistent spin current should emerge instead of the persistent charge current .      by analyzing the motion of the spin , including the translational and rotational motion ( precession ) of a spin",
    ", one can also show the existence of the persistent spin current in the mesoscopic device with the soi.@xcite in order to analyze the motion of the spin , we need to solve the wave - functions of the electron , so we put this analysis in the appendix , where the wave - functions have been solved .",
    "in this section , we present an example to show that indeed a pure persistent spin current can exist for a mesoscopic semiconducting ring with soi . in the presence of soi , the spin of an electron experiences a torque and",
    "hence @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) is not a good quantum number anymore .",
    "because of this , the spin current is not conserved using the conventional definition . at present",
    "there are controversies on whether one should define a conserved spin current or whether there exists a conserved spin current.@xcite in another word , so far there is no consensus on the definition for the spin current in the presence of soi . in this section ,",
    "we use the following approach .",
    "we first discuss the persistent spin current for a one - dimensional mesoscopic semiconducting ring that consists of a rashba soi s region and a normal region without soi as shown in fig.1c .",
    "since there is no spin - flip in the normal region , the spin current can be calculated using conventional definition without controversy , so that we can make sure the existence of the persistent spin current in the equilibrium case with solely soi . after we make sure the existence of the persistent spin current",
    ", we then go back to examine the definition of the spin current , which is given in section vi .",
    "the hamiltonian of our system is given by:@xcite @xmath20    -i \\frac{\\alpha_r(\\varphi)}{2a}\\sigma_{\\varphi}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 , @xmath22 is the radius of the ring , @xmath23 is the effective mass of the electron , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 .",
    "@xmath26 is the strength of the rashba soi , @xmath27 while @xmath28 , i.e. in the normal region , and @xmath26 is a constant @xmath29 in the soi s region with @xmath30 .",
    "the eigenstates of hamiltonian ( 1 ) can be solved numerically in the following way .",
    "first in the rashba soi s region ( @xmath31 ) , the equation @xmath32 has four independent solutions @xmath33 ( @xmath34):@xcite @xmath35 and @xmath36 with @xmath37 being the time - reversal operator . in eq.(2 ) , the wave vectors @xmath38 , and the angle @xmath39 is given by @xmath40 . similarly , in the normal region ( @xmath41 )",
    ", the sch@xmath42dinger equation has four independent solutions : @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 , with @xmath46 .",
    "secondly , the eigen wave function @xmath47 with the eigen energy @xmath48 can be represented as : @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 ( @xmath34 ) are constants to be determined by the boundary conditions at the interfaces @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "here the boundary conditions are the continuity of the wave function @xmath54 and the continuity of its flux@xcite @xmath55 , where @xmath56 $ ] is the velocity operator . by using the boundary conditions",
    ", we obtain eight series of linear equations : @xmath57 @xmath58 @xmath59 @xmath60 @xmath61 @xmath62 @xmath63 @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "the eigenvalue @xmath67 can be solved numerically by setting the determinant of the coefficient of the variables @xmath50 and @xmath51 in the above eight series of linear equations to zero .",
    "now we present the numerical results .",
    "fig.3a shows the eigen values @xmath67 versus the rashba soi s strength @xmath29 . for the normal ring ( @xmath68 ) ,",
    "the eigenvalues are @xmath69 with fourfold degeneracy , and the corresponding eigenstates are @xmath70 and @xmath71.@xcite as the soi is turned on the degenerate energy levels split while maintaining twofold kramers degeneracy . the higher the energy level , the larger this energy split .",
    "typically , the splits are on the order of @xmath72 at @xmath73 , with @xmath74 for the ring s radius @xmath75 and the effective mass @xmath76 .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath67 versus the normal region s angle @xmath53 are also shown ( see fig.3b ) .",
    "for @xmath77 , the whole ring is normal and @xmath67 are fourfold degenerate.@xcite when @xmath53 is away from @xmath78 , the degenerated levels are split into two , and the splits are larger with the smaller @xmath53 . when @xmath79 , the whole ring has the rashba soi , and the split reaches the maximum .",
    "since @xmath67 is twofold degenerate , we obtain two eigenstates for each @xmath67 , which are labeled @xmath80 and @xmath81.@xcite with the wave functions , the spin current contributed from the level @xmath82 can be calculated straightforwardly using the conventional definition @xmath83 ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "notice that the spin current @xmath84 is a tensor , where @xmath85 in the cylinder coordinates and @xmath86 in the orthogonal coordinates .",
    "the first index @xmath87 describes the direction of the motion of the electron , and the second index @xmath88 represents the direct of the spin .",
    "because the device in the present paper is a ring , the motion of the electron has no components along radial ( @xmath89 ) and @xmath90 axis .",
    "hence the spin currents @xmath91 and @xmath92 ( @xmath93 ) are zero . only spin current @xmath94 with the electron moving along the @xmath95 direction is non - zero . to simplify the notation ,",
    "hereafter we use the symbol @xmath96 to replace @xmath97 . since there is a controversy about the definition of spin current in the soi s region , we will calculate the spin current only in the normal region in this section .",
    "the spin current in the soi s region will be studied in the section vii after the definition of the spin current is investigated in the section vi . in the normal region , the spin current is conserved , so @xmath98 is independent of the angle coordinate @xmath95 .",
    "fig.4 shows the spin current @xmath96 versus the rashba soi s strength @xmath29 for @xmath99.@xcite since @xmath67 is twofold degenerate , the wave - functions can be arbitrary combination of @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "but the spin current @xmath96 remains the same .",
    "our results in fig.4 show that @xmath100 is exactly zero for all level @xmath82 while @xmath99 , and @xmath101 and @xmath102 exhibit the oscillatory pattern with @xmath29 . a @xmath103-phase shift between @xmath101 and @xmath102",
    "is observed with @xmath104 approximately constant . for two adjacent levels @xmath105 and @xmath106 , their spin current have opposite signs , and @xmath107 if @xmath108 .",
    "we note that the spin current @xmath96 is quite large .",
    "for example , the value @xmath109 is equivalent to the spin current of a moving electron in the ring with its speed @xmath110 .",
    "the spin current @xmath96 versus the angle @xmath53 that describes the normal region at a fixed @xmath111 is shown in fig.5 . when @xmath112 , the whole ring is normal , @xmath101 and @xmath102 are exactly zero .",
    "however , @xmath100 is non - zero ( see fig.5a ) .",
    "note that @xmath113 ( @xmath114 ) and @xmath115 at @xmath112 , so the total spin current @xmath116 is still identically zero because that the ( 2n-1)-th and the 2n - th states are degenerate and have the same occupied probability at @xmath112 .",
    "when @xmath117 where part of the ring has the soi , three components @xmath118 of the spin current can be non - zero . for the larger n ,",
    "the absolute value of the spin current @xmath119 is larger . for two adjacent levels @xmath105 and @xmath106 , their spin current have opposite signs , which is similar to the result of fig.4 .",

    "the persistent charge current and the equilibrium spin accumulation are found to be zero because the system has the time - reversal symmetry .",

    "one of the main results is that the spin current indeed is non - zero when @xmath126 .",
    "the persistent spin currents @xmath120 in fig.6 have the following features . at @xmath68",
    "the whole ring is normal , so @xmath120 is exactly zero . with increasing @xmath29 , @xmath120 increases initially and then oscillates for the large @xmath29 . in fig.6a",
    ", b , the parameter @xmath53 is @xmath127 , i.e. half of the ring is normal and the other half of the ring has the soi , then @xmath116 is zero , and only @xmath128 and @xmath129 are non - zero . if @xmath130 , the components @xmath131 can be non - zero . at certain @xmath29 , there is a jump in the curve of @xmath120 versus @xmath29 .",
    "this is because for this @xmath29 the fermi energy @xmath123 is in line with a level @xmath67 , leading to a change of its occupation . at zero temperature ,",
    "the jump is abrupt as shown in fig.6a , b . but at finite temperature , this jump will be washed out .",
    "in fact , these results are similar to the persistent ( charge ) current in the mesoscopic ring.@xcite    the spin current @xmath120 versus the angle @xmath53 of normal region at a fixed @xmath111 is shown in fig.6c , d .",
    "when @xmath112 , the whole ring is normal , we have @xmath132 .",
    "when @xmath53 is away from @xmath78 , the spin current @xmath131 emerges . for some fermi energy a jump appears in the curve @xmath120-@xmath53 ( as shown in fig.6c ) ,",

    "in particular , in the limit when @xmath53 goes to zero , i.e. when there is no normal region in the ring , the spin current @xmath116 and @xmath129 still exist .",
    "this indicates that the normal region is not necessary for generating @xmath120 .    in the above numerical calculation ,",

    "but the spin currents @xmath136 at these @xmath29 that are far away from this point of jump ( e.g. @xmath138 in fig.7 ) are not effected very much by the temperature @xmath139 even for @xmath139 reaching @xmath140 . upon further the temperature @xmath139 is raised and on the same order of the energy - level interval , the spin currents @xmath120 is reduced for all values @xmath29 .",
    "this is because the probability of occupation , i.e. @xmath141 , of the energy level vary smoothly versus the level index @xmath82 and the spin current due to the adjacent levels are opposite in sign .",
    "however , even when @xmath139 reaching @xmath142 , the persistent spin current @xmath120 is still quite large . for the ring s radius @xmath75 and the effective mass @xmath76 , @xmath72 is about @xmath143 .",

    "etc_. thus , it is a generic feature that a pure persistent spin current appears in a system with soi . in this section",
    ", we will discuss the relation between the persistent spin current and the normal transport spin current .",
    "first let us review and discuss the relation of the persistent ( charge ) current and the transport ( charge ) current in a mesoscopic ring device . to consider a mesoscopic ring threaded by a magnetic flux coupled to two leads ( the lead - l and the lead - r ) which act as the electron reservoirs ( see fig.11a ) .",
    "there exists dissipation in the two leads and they are always in equilibrium for an isolated lead - l(r ) .",
    "the size of the ring is assumed within the coherent length and no dissipation in the ring . at zero bias ( i.e. the equilibrium case ) ,",
    "the transport charge current is zero everywhere , including the two leads and the ring , but the persistent charge current exists only in the ring , but not the leads because of presence of dissipation in the leads .",
    "if a non - zero bias is added between two leads , a transport charge current flows from one lead through the ring to the other lead , so there exists both transport and persistent charge currents in the ring but only the transport current in the leads because of dissipation .",
    "in other words , at a finite bias , the charge currents @xmath175 in the two arms of the ring are the sum of the transport currents @xmath176 and the persistent current @xmath177 : @xmath178 and @xmath179 .",
    "can one distinguish the transport charge currents @xmath176 and the persistent charge current @xmath177 ?",
    "in fact , they ( @xmath176 and @xmath177 ) can not be distinguished either in theory or in experiment .",
    "the transport charge currents @xmath176 and the persistent charge current @xmath177 in the ring have identical behaviors , both of them are dissipationless@xcite , capable of inducing a magnetic field , _",
    "etc_. so in principle only the total charge currents @xmath175 in the arms are observable physical quantities . if some dissipative impurities are introduced in the ring , then the transport charge currents @xmath176 show dissipation while the persistent charge current @xmath177 does not . under this circumstance , can one distinguish the transport currents @xmath176 and the persistent currents @xmath177 ?",
    "it turns out that one can still not distinguish these types of currents .",
    "when dissipative impurities are introduced , the original dissipationless ring is changed into a new different ring , in which the persistent charge current @xmath177 is quenched while the transport charge currents @xmath176 are normally reduced due to dissipation .",
    "thus , it is impossible to obtain @xmath176 and @xmath177 of the original dissipationless ring .",
    "the relation between the persistent spin current and the transport spin current is identical to the relation between the two charge currents discussed above . consider that part of a mesoscopic ring contains a soi but without a magnetic flux , and with two leads coupled to this ring ( see fig.11b ) . in the equilibrium case ,",
    "a persistent spin current emerges in the ring , neither the transport spin current nor the persistent spin current is present in the leads . under a spin - motive force,@xcite a transport spin current flows from one lead through the ring to the other lead .",
    "the persistent spin current in the leads is always absent independent of with or without a spin - motive force due to dissipation . on the other hand , with a spin motive force ,",
    "both persistent spin current and the transport spin current exist in the ring .",
    "similarly to the charge currents , both persistent spin current @xmath180 and transport spin currents @xmath181 in the two arms of the ring are indistinguishable since they behave identically in all physically measurable properties . both of them are dissipationless@xcite , describing the real spin motion , capable of inducing an electric field , and so on .",
    "from the sections ii , iii , and iv , we have made sure that the persistent spin current exists in the equilibrium mesoscopic semiconducting device in the presence of soi . in this section , we examine the definition of the spin current .",
    "the first work to question the conventional definition of the spin current is by rashba.@xcite after that , many subsequent papers have discussed the definition of the spin current as mentioned in the introduction.@xcite in summary,@xcite in the presence of soi one faces three problems when using the conventional definition @xmath182:@xcite ( i ) there exists a non - zero spin current even in the equilibrium system , ( ii ) the spin current usually is non - conservative , and ( iii ) the onsager relation is violated .",
    "therefore suggestions have been made in previous papers that one needs to modify the conventional definition of the spin current . in the following ,",
    "we examine these three problems in detail and we argue that there is no need to modify this conventional definition@xcite @xmath182 .    * ( i ) the non - zero spin current in the equilibrium system : *    from the investigation and the discussion in the sections ii , iii , and iv , we have clearly shown that this non - zero spin current is the persistent spin current .",
    "it describes the real motion of spins , has the physical meaning , and can be observed in the experiment in principle ( see the section viii ) .",
    "so this non - zero spin current should be kept in the calculation of the total spin current .    *",
    "( ii ) non - conservation of the spin current : *    in this sub - section , we argue that in general the spin current is not conserved in the presence of the soi or / and the magnetic field .",
    "however , in certain cases , the spin current can be conserved by including the strong spin - spin interaction .",
    "let us analyze this problem from the both aspects of the theory and experiment .",
    "in the aspect of the theory , we give two examples of the non - conserved spin current ( for intuition the readers can also consider the spin as a classic vector ) .",
    "first , we want to show that in general if the system has spin flip mechanism , the spin current will not be conserved .",
    "for instance , in the presence of a rotating magnetic field or circular polarized light@xcite the spin current exists in a device connected to only one terminal . this one terminal device and its spin translational motion and precession are as shown in fig.12a .",
    "here at @xmath183 , the spin is without precession , and the spin pointing to the @xmath184-direction moves along the @xmath185-direction while the spin pointing to the @xmath186-direction moves along the opposite direction .",
    "so it has a non - zero spin current @xmath187 at @xmath183 .",
    "near the point @xmath188 where the quantum dot located , the spin precesses and is flipped due to the presence of a rotating magnetic field or circularly polarized light.@xcite then the spin accumulation does not vary with time and the system maintains the steady state .",
    "it is obvious that the spin current is not conserved because of only one terminal in this device .    in the second theoretical example , to consider the spin translational motion and precession on a ring as shown in fig.12b . at point",
    "a with its angular coordinate @xmath52 , the spin pointing to @xmath185-direction moves down while the spin pointing to @xmath189-direction moves up , then the non - zero element of the spin current is @xmath190 . at another point b with its angular coordinate @xmath191 , the spin pointing to @xmath192-direction moves along the @xmath185-axis and the spin pointing to @xmath186-direction moves along the @xmath189-axis ,",
    "then the non - zero element of the spin current is @xmath193 .",
    "so it is obvious that the spin current is not conserved in this ring device , but the spin accumulation still keep invariant .",
    "in fact , this example is similar to the persistent spin current in the mesoscopic ring while the whole ring has the soi ( see the section vii.c and the appendix ) , in which the motion of the @xmath194-@xmath184- plane elements of the spin is as in the fig.12b and the spin accumulation is zero everywhere .",
    "in addition , there are experimental indications that the spin current is not conserved . for example , let us consider the experimental result by valenzuela and tinkham.@xcite in this experiment , they have clearly shown that a pure spin current injects from the fm1 electrode into the al strip , reduces with its flowing forward because of the spin flip , and finally disappears while the distance much longer than the spin diffusion length ( see fig.1a , b , c , and fig.4 in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "this experimental result gives a strong proof of that the spin current should be non - conserved in the presence of the soi , the magnetic field , the magnetic impurity , or others .    *",
    "( iii ) violation of the onsager relation : *    the onsager reciprocal relation is an important theorem of the near - equilibrium transport theory . up to now , the onsager reciprocal relation is always satisfied for transport of any physical quantity ( e.g. the charge transport , thermal transport , etc ) by suitably defining a corresponding current .",
    "however , in the following we point out that the onsager relation for the spin transport is in general violated . in particular , it is impossible to restore the onsager relation regardless of how to modify the definition of the spin current .",
    "this is very different from all previous cases . in this sub - section",
    ", we first recall the tenable condition of the onsager reciprocal relation , and then examine the case of the spin current .",
    "we find that the spin transport does not always meet this condition no matter how to define the spin current , although this condition is met for all previous transport phenomena people have studied .",
    "so the onsager relation is in general violated for the spin transport .",
    "first , let us recall the tenable condition of the onsager relation .",
    "considering the currents @xmath195 and its corresponding forces @xmath196 , and they have the following relationships : @xmath197 where @xmath198 is the conductivity . _",
    "if _ the local entropy production @xmath199 per unit time can be expressed as : @xmath200 , there exists an onsager relation @xmath201 ( assuming that the system has the time - reversal symmetry ) .",
    "next , we give an intuitive example to show the tenable condition of the onsager relation .",
    "let us consider the charge conductivity in the two - dimensional system . to take the vectors @xmath202 and @xmath203 ( as shown in fig.13a ) as the base vectors of the charge current and its force [",
    "i.e. the gradient of the potential , @xmath204 , the equation ( [ eq14 ] ) becomes : @xmath205 in this case , the onsager relation is tenable , and @xmath206 .",
    "if taking the non - orthonormal vectors @xmath202 and @xmath207 ( as shown in fig.13b ) as the base vectors of the current and the force , the onsager relation will be violated as shown in the following . for the base vectors @xmath202 and @xmath207 , any current vector @xmath208 and force vector @xmath209 can still be expressed as : @xmath210 and @xmath211 .",
    "then it is easily to obtain the relation between @xmath212 and @xmath213 : @xmath214 where @xmath215 so under the base vectors @xmath202 and @xmath207 , the eq.([eq15 ] ) changes to : @xmath216 it is obvious that the two off - diagonal elements of the conductivity in the above equation are not equal , so the onsager relation is violated in the non - orthonormal base vectors @xmath202 and @xmath207 .",
    "in fact , for the charge current , the onsager relation is only tenable under the orthonormal and linear independent base vectors .",
    "now , let us discuss the spin current .",
    "the spin current has @xmath217 elements and the charge current has @xmath218 elements .",
    "so here the current @xmath208 ( including spin and charge ) and the corresponding force @xmath219 totally has @xmath220 elements and the conductivity has @xmath221 elements . for simplicity and clarity ,",
    "we consider a one - dimensional system and the electron can only move along the @xmath194 axis . in this case , the current @xmath208 and the force @xmath219 have only 4 non - zero elements , and they are : @xmath222 where @xmath223 ( @xmath19 ) is the spin chemical potential and @xmath224 is the ( charge ) chemical potential.@xcite the spin chemical potential @xmath223 means that the electron of the spin pointing to @xmath225 and @xmath226-direction occupy up to @xmath227 and @xmath228 ( shown in fig.13c , d , e ) , respectively",
    ". then the eq.([eq14 ] ) becomes : @xmath229 and the conductivity has @xmath230 elements .",
    "now we show that the spin transport does not meet the tenable condition of the onsager relation .",
    "first , the three base vectors @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) are not orthonormal , and it is impossible to find a series of the orthonormal base vectors regardless of what combination of the three @xmath18 .    in addition , once the spin chemical potential of one component is fixed , the other two spin potentials @xmath223 can not exist .",
    "for example , if we give the value for the spin potential @xmath231 , this means that the electron of the spin along @xmath232 direction occupies up to @xmath233 and the electron of the spin at @xmath234 direction occupies up to @xmath235 if @xmath236 ( see fig.13e),@xcite and the electron occupational state has completely been determined .",
    "then one can not further specify the spin states and the corresponding occupation number along @xmath185 and @xmath189 ( or @xmath192 and @xmath186 ) .",
    "therefore , while giving the value for one component of the spin potential , e.g. @xmath231 , the others @xmath237 and @xmath238 do not exist .",
    "this conclusion hold even for spin free and conserved system with @xmath239=0 $ ] for all @xmath88 ( @xmath19 ) . due to the fact that three spin potentials @xmath223 can not be simultaneously evaluated , the eq.([eq20 ] ) [ i.e. the eq.([eq14 ] ) ]",
    "does not exist for the spin transport , regardless of how to define the spin current .",
    "therefore there is no onsager relation in spin transport , and it is impossible to restore the onsager relation by modifying the definition of the spin current .",
    "in fact , the onsager relation is not satisfied for any existing definitions of the spin current .",
    "furthermore , we can also use the four normal terminal device ( as the device in ref.@xcite ) to examine the onsager relation . because the four terminal leads are normal metal without the soi , there is no spin - flip . for this system , there is no controversy for the definition of the spin current in the terminal leads .",
    "therefore we can avoid the definition of the spin current and examine the onsager relation .",
    "the results also show that the onsager relation does not exist for the spin transport .",
    "this gives an additional proof .",
    "we wish to mention that because @xmath231 and @xmath240 ( or @xmath237 and @xmath240 , or @xmath238 and @xmath240 ) can be determined simultaneously , the onsager relation for @xmath241 ( or @xmath242 , or @xmath243 ) might exist,@xcite e.g. , in the suitable boundary condition in the four terminal device.@xcite however , it is impossible that six relations ( @xmath241 , @xmath242 , @xmath243 , @xmath244 , @xmath245 , and @xmath246 ) are satisfied simultaneously.@xcite for three - dimensional systems , the conductivity has @xmath247 elements @xmath198 , similar conclusion applies , i.e. , it is impossible that @xmath248 are satisfied for all off - diagonal matrix element simultaneously .    *",
    "( iv ) discussions *    from the discussion in the last three sub - sections , we have clearly shown that ( i ) the non - zero spin current in the equilibrium soi s device is the persistent spin current , ( ii ) in general the spin current is not conserved , and ( iii ) the onsager relation is violated for the spin transport . in particular , it can not be restored regardless of how to modify the definition of the spin current .",
    "therefore the three `` flaws '' of the conventional definition of the spin current , which has been mentioned and commented in some previous papers , are intrinsic properties of spin transport .",
    "in addition , the conventional definition has very clear physical intuition and has described the spin motion very well .",
    "using this conventional definition , one can account for many effects that relate the spin transport,@xcite e.g. , the heat produced by the spin current , the spin currents induced electric field , and the force and the torque acting on the spin current in the presence of electric field .",
    "therefore we make the conclusion that there is no need to modify the conventional definition @xmath249.@xcite    before the end of this section , we wish to mention that if the spin - spin interaction is included into the hamiltonian , the spin current calculated using the conventional definition will be conserved automatically.@xcite we will discuss this in detail in section ix .",
    "we also note that our discussion above does not contradict with the angular spin current in our previous paper by sun and xie.@xcite to see this , let us first recall the ( linear ) velocity @xmath250 and the angular velocity @xmath251 .",
    "( a ) the ( linear ) velocity @xmath252 ( or the velocity operator @xmath253 ) can describe the translational motion of the vector ( or the rigid body ) and there is no need to modify this velocity definition @xmath252 .",
    "( b ) on the other hand , the vector has the rotational degrees of freedom except for its translational motion , so we need to introduce the angular velocity @xmath251 to describe its rotational motion .",
    "we emphasize that two statements ( a ) and ( b ) do not contradict to each other and can be rephrased as ( a ) the ( linear ) spin current @xmath254 can describe the translational motion of the spin and there is no need to modify its definition .",
    "( b ) on the other hand , the spin has the rotational degrees of freedom ( precession ) except for its translational motion , so we need to introduce the angular spin current @xmath255 to describe its rotational motion.@xcite",
    "after clarifying the definition of the spin current , we return to discuss the persistent spin current in the soi s region of the normal - soi ring in this section . in the sub - section",
    "a , we investigate the linear and angular persistent spin current . in the sub - section b",
    ", we show that the persistent spin current still exists even using the new definition of the spin current as in ref .",

    "fig.14 shows the linear spin current @xmath118 ( i.e. the element in the orthogonal coordinates ) and the angular spin current @xmath268 ( i.e. the element in the cylindrical coordinates ) versus the angular coordinates @xmath95 . in the normal region",
    ", @xmath118 is conserved and is independent of the coordinates @xmath95 , and @xmath268 is zero , since the spin has only the translational motion without the precession there . on the other hand ,",
    "in the soi region , except for @xmath269 , the ( linear ) spin current @xmath270 and the angular spin current @xmath268 are all non - zero and non - conserved , because of the spin precession in the presence of the soi .",
    "the linear spin current @xmath271 versus @xmath95 is always continuous , even at the interface between the normal region and the soi region where the strength of soi @xmath26 changes abruptly .",
    "but the angular spin current @xmath272 versus @xmath95 shows a jump whenever @xmath26 versus @xmath95 has as abrupt change , as shown in fig.14d , e , and f. the jump position of @xmath273 is located at the abrupt point of @xmath26 .",
    "the spin currents @xmath96 ( and @xmath274 ) versus @xmath95 for the states with the same - parity , e.g. @xmath275 , or @xmath276 , are similar in shape ( see fig.14a , c , d , and f ) , but the value of @xmath119 ( or @xmath277 ) is much larger for a larger @xmath82 .",

    "second , if the coordinate origin is not located at the center of the ring , all 9 elements of the spin current are in general different to those by using the conventional definition . in particular , they are all non - zero and non - conserved in equilibrium .",
    "let us consider the case of @xmath287 , i.e. the normal region is gradually getting smaller and at the end the whole ring contains the soi .",
    "fig.16 shows the persistent spin current @xmath131 versus the angle coordinate @xmath95 for @xmath288 , @xmath289 , and @xmath290 , respectively .",
    "the results clearly show that the persistent spin current @xmath131 does exist , and its value @xmath291 is even larger with decreasing of the normal region , i.e. @xmath53 .",
    "eventually when the entire ring contains the soi , @xmath291 reaches its maximum value .",
    "this means that the normal region is not necessary for the existence of the persistent spin current .",
    "in fact , if the whole ring has a constant soi with @xmath292 , the persistent spin current can be analytically obtained . in this case , the eigenwave function is:@xcite @xmath293 where @xmath294 and the eigenvalue @xmath67 is given by @xmath295\\ ] ] then the linear spin current @xmath296 and the angular spin current @xmath297 from the state @xmath82 are as follows : @xmath298 \\label{eq27 } \\\\   { \\bf i}^n_{\\omega } & = & ( e_a / a ) f(\\theta ) \\left [ \\vec{e}_x\\sin\\theta \\sin\\varphi   -   \\vec{e}_y \\sin\\theta \\cos \\varphi \\right ] \\nonumber \\\\    & = & -(e_a / a ) f(\\theta ) \\vec{e}_{\\varphi } \\sin\\theta    \\label{eq28}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath299/2\\pi $ ] .",
    "the persistent linear and angular spin currents @xmath280 and @xmath300 are obtained by summing @xmath296 and @xmath297 over the occupied states .",
    "in addition , from the wave function [ eq.([eq25 ] ) ] and the spin currents [ eq.([eq27],[eq28 ] ) ] , the spin motion in the ring can be obtained ( see the discussion in appendix ) .      from the results of eq.([eq27],[eq28 ] ) , three quantities characterizing the spin current @xmath296 are found to be conserved , although the spin current itself is not conserved in the presence of a soi . (",
    "a ) the spin current @xmath301 with spin polarization along z - direction is a conserved quantity for the ring geometry .",
    "( b ) the magnitude of the spin current @xmath302 is a constant of motion .",
    "( c ) for a given cross - section of the ring , the vector of spin polarization for the spin current @xmath296 makes a fixed angle with the normal direction of that cross - section .",
    "this angle is a constant for any cross - section of the ring . in this sense ,",
    "the spin current @xmath303 is `` conserved '' , although the direction of spin polarization for @xmath296 is not a constant of motion due to a soi .",
    "so the non - conservation of spin current in the ring device means that while moving along the ring the direction of spin polarization is precessing due to the torque from the soi . for the hybrid ring",
    ", our numerical results also show that the magnitude of spin current @xmath304 is again a constant of motion across the hybrid ring , but the element of the z - direction @xmath301 and the angle in ( c ) are not .",
    "there are a number of experiments that have been carried out to confirm the existence of spin current,@xcite e.g. to observe the spin current induced spin accumulations by the kerr effect,@xcite or to make the electric measurement through the reciprocal spin hall effect.@xcite since the persistent spin current is an equilibrium property , the above mentioned methods are not suitable .",
    "there is also a proposal that a spin current may cause a spin torque that can be measured experimentally@xcite .",
    "very recently , sonin pointed out that this method can be employed to detect the persistent spin current.@xcite on the other hand , we note that the persistent charge current can be detected by measuring its induced magnetic field.@xcite it has been shown that the persistent spin current can also generate an electric field.@xcite so this offers another way to detect the persistent spin current by measuring its induced electric field . in the following ,",
    "we calculate the persistent spin current induced electric field and electric potential , and show that this electric field or the electric potential can be observed in the present technology .    the induced electric fields @xmath305 and @xmath306 at space point @xmath307 by the linear and angular spin currents @xmath280 and @xmath300 in the ring device are:@xcite @xmath308 where @xmath309 is the bohr magneton and @xmath310 is the position vector in the ring . considering the whole ring having a constant soi ,",

    "so @xmath361 is important for contributing to the total electric field @xmath328 . on the other hand , while very near the ring device ( e.g. @xmath362 in fig.18b , d , f ) , @xmath334 is much larger than @xmath361 and @xmath334 is dominant in @xmath363 .",

    "@xmath372 that could be due to spin - spin interaction,@xcite the many - body hamiltonian @xmath4 in eq.([eq39 ] ) reduces into the one - body form : @xmath373 now the hamiltonian of eq.([eq40 ] ) is easily solved , and the linear spin current and the spin torque all depend on @xmath372 .",
    "the induced self - consistent field @xmath372 in eq.([eq40 ] ) is determined by requiring that the spin torque ( or the angular spin current ) is zero or @xmath374 for any @xmath375 .",
    "once @xmath372 is solved the persistent spin current is automatically conserved by using the conventional definition .",
    "now we apply this method to the ring without the normal region and set soi to a constant with @xmath167 .",
    "we start with the following hamiltonian @xmath376 where @xmath377 is the original hamiltonian [ see eq.(1 ) ] for a ring with full soi .",
    "the reason that we choose the induced field as @xmath378 is because we know @xmath379 is conserved and there is a torque along @xmath380 .",

    "now we calculate the total torque . from continuity equation ,",
    "the torque is just the angular spin current @xmath390 $ ] with @xmath391 .",
    "it is easy to show that @xmath392 has only @xmath393 component @xmath394 note that the purpose of introducing the self - consistent field @xmath384 is to make sure that the spin current is conserved or the torque vanishes as we have discussed earlier . setting the torque @xmath395 to zero we obtain the second equation that determines the self - consistent field @xmath384 @xmath396 once @xmath384 is solved from eqs.([rel1 ] ) and ( [ rel2 ] ) , the spin current will be conserved following the continuity equation . plugging eq.([rel2 ] ) into eq.([rel1 ] ) , we find @xmath397 this means that @xmath398 defined in eq.([fun ] ) is zero and the conserved persistent spin current is nonzero only for the spin polarization along z - direction @xmath399 \\cos\\theta\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 is determined by eq.([rel3 ] ) .",
    "we wish to point out that even for the hybrid ring , the above approach can be used and the persistent spin current is also conserved in the presence of spin - spin interaction .",
    "the only difference is that we have to introduce three self - consistent fields @xmath400 , @xmath401 . from the energy dispersion relation ,",
    "we have relationship between @xmath39 and @xmath400 . by requiring the torque along each direction to be zero ,",
    "we obtain three additional equations .",
    "these four equations will determine @xmath400 and @xmath39 .",
    "this in turn gives the displacement spin current and hence the conserved persistent spin current .",
    "in summary , we have investigated two closely related subjects : ( a ) the prediction of a pure persistent spin current in an equilibrium mesoscopic device with solely spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) , and ( b ) the issues concerning the definition of the spin current . through the physical arguments and physical pictures from four different aspects , the analytic calculation results of a soi - normal hybrid ring , as well as the discussion of the sharp interface between the normal and soi part",
    ", we demonstrated that the persistent spin current indeed exists in the equilibrium device with a soi alone . in",
    "particularly , we emphasize that this persistent spin current is an analog of the persistent charge current in the mesoscopic ring threaded by a magnetic flux , and it describes the real spin motion and are experimentally measurable .    after showing the existence of the persistent spin current",
    ", we investigate the definition of the spin current .",
    "we point that : ( i ) the non - zero spin current in the equilibrium soi s device is the persistent spin current ; ( ii ) in general the spin current is not conserved ; and ( iii ) the onsager relation is violated for the spin transport , and in particularly , it can not be recovered through modification of the definition of the spin current .",
    "so these three `` flaws '' , the non - zero spin current in the equilibrium case , the non - conserved spin current , and the violation of the onsager relation , of the conventional definition of the spin current are intrinsic properties of spin transport . in particular , the conventional definition , @xmath402 , possesses a very clear physical picture , and is capable of describing the spin motion .",
    "so we draw the conclusion that the conventional definition of the spin current makes physical sense , and no need to modify it .",
    "in addition , a number of problems have also been discussed .",
    "the relation between the persistent spin current and transport spin current is discussed , and we find that they are indistinguishable in the coherent part of the device .",
    "we calculate the persistent linear and angular spin current in the soi s region of the hybrid ring , and the results show that the persistent spin current still exists in the soi s region , even when the soi covers the whole ring .",
    "the measurement issue of the persistent spin current is also discussed , we suggest that the persistent spin current can be observed by detecting its induced electric field . in the presence of a spin - spin interaction in the ring ,",
    "we find that the persistent spin current using the conventional definition is automatically conserved .",

    "the direction of spin ( translational ) motion is counter - clockwise , while precessing with @xmath251 in the perpendicular direction of @xmath405 , so that the spin is in the @xmath316-@xmath317 plane all along .",
