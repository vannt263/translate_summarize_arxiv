    "the observations of zwicky @xcite and rubin and ford @xcite demonstrate the existence of dark matter , and therefore have set the motion for an intensive theoretical and experimental search to determine the nature and composition of this new kind of matter .",
    "the detection of dark matter is crucial to solve some of the actual cosmological problems .",
    "our present knowledge of the universe supports the notion that it is composed by ordinary matter , dark matter ( dm ) and dark energy ( de ) .",
    "the amount of barionic density matter can be determined with great accuracy @xmath0 @xcite , and the fractions of the other components amount to @xmath1 ( dm ) and @xmath2 ( de ) .",
    "an electrically neutral wimp is the most probably candidate for dm .",
    "the estimates of the mass of the wimp vary from @xmath3 to @xmath4 @xcite , though this range may be reduced to values of the order of @xmath5 to @xmath6 @xcite , it interacts weakly and gravitationally with the ordinary matter but does not interact electromagnetically and/or strongly with other particles .",
    "it is assumed that the dm in the galactic halo is composed mostly by wimp with velocities which obey maxwell - boltzmann distribution function @xcite . as a consequence of the earth motion around the sun , a time variable flux of dark matter ( annual modulation ) might be detected and from it some properties of the wimp may be experimentally determined .",
    "there are several efforts to measure the annual modulation of the wimp s signal , that is experiments which aim at its direct detection @xcite like dama @xcite , cresst @xcite , cogent @xcite , cdms @xcite , xenon @xcite , sabre@xcite , dm - ice @xcite , and experiments based on indirect detection methods@xcite like icecube @xcite , antares @xcite , fermi - lat @xcite , hess @xcite , among others .    because of the extremely low signal - to - noise rates , direct - detection experiments need to be performed in low - background conditions .",
    "therefore , they are located in underground laboratories , and these experiments measure the recoil - energy deposited by wimp interacting with the atomic nuclei of a detector . to confirm a positive signal , it is important to collect data with the same kind of detectors in two or more different laboratories since , as we shall show , the diurnal modulation of the amplitude of the signal depends on the location of the laboratory .",
    "although diurnal modulation of dark - matter signals may be very difficult to measure , if it is observed the difference between data collected in northern and southern locations could help to refine the parameters used to characterize the dark matter .",
    "more importantly , a directional detector showing a different declination angle to the wimp - wind between northern and southern locations would probe the signal to be caused by dark matter .    in this work",
    "we compare the response of two existing detectors , a nai based detector ( dama ) and a ge - type detector ( cogent ) , both located in the northern hemisphere , with the response of similar detectors ideally located in the andes laboratory , which will be built in the province of san juan , argentina , under the mountains at a deep of @xmath7 ( about 5000 m.w.e ) @xcite .",
    "then , we focus on a similar comparison between nai - based detectors : ( sabre)@xcite to operate in a southern location ( supl , australia ) and dm - ice@xcite in the south pole .    the paper is organized as follows . in section [ formalismo ]",
    "we describe the formalism needed to compute annual and diurnal modulation rates . in section [ resultados ]",
    "we demonstrate the dependence of the diurnal modulation with the location of the detector , and make the comparison between andes and the other places .",
    "our conclusions are drawn in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "the interactions between wimp and a nucleus of the detector cause the recoil of the nucleus , at the rate ( recoil - rate ) @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the recoil energy , @xmath10 is the reduced mass of the system , @xmath11 is the mass of the nucleus , @xmath12 is the mass of the wimp , @xmath13 is the dispersion angle , @xmath14 is the local mass - density of dark matter , @xmath15 is the wimp velocity - distribution , and @xmath16 is the wimp velocity with respect to the detector . the cross section is written @xmath17 in the previous equation , @xmath18 is the momentum transferred to the nucleus , @xmath19 is the cross section at @xmath20 , and @xmath21 stands for the nuclear form factor .    by defining the mean inverse - velocity @xmath22 the recoil rate of eq .",

    "in this work we have calculated observables associated to the scattering of wimps by nuclei , like amplitudes for diurnal and annual modulations and recoil - rates . we have considered two different detectors , nai and ge , and we have shown that , for the best - fit values of the wimp mass and cross section , the diurnal modulation amplitude depends on the location of the detector on the earth .",
