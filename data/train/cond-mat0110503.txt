    "although only slightly more than a decade old , the lattice boltzmann ( lb ) method @xcite has already gained the status of a versatile simulation tool for homogeneous and heterogeneous flows in various , often very complex , geometries .",
    "inclusion of viscoelastic effects , common for many naturally - occurring fluids , will make the range of application of the lb method even wider .",
    "a modification of the standard bgk model @xcite , suggested in @xcite , allows for shear wave propagation , which is one of the intrinsic features of viscoelastic fluids .",
    "however , the physical foundations of the approach , proposed in @xcite , are somewhat unclear , since it does not include any memory about an accumulated shear strain .",
    "we propose a more general approach , based on a physically transparent maxwell model of viscoelasticity @xcite , which exhibits viscoelastic properties and accounts for accumulated stress via exponentially decaying memory function .",
    "let us for simplicity consider a standard 6-velocity bgk model on a 2d hexagonal lattice , though generalizations for more sophisticated lattice boltzmann schemes is straightforward .",
    "evolution equations for an _ i_th channel occupation number @xmath0 have the following form @xcite : @xmath1 where equilibrium occupation numbers @xmath2 are : @xmath3.\\ ] ] here @xmath4 are the equilibrium density and velocity at each lattice site , and @xmath5 are the lattice unit vectors . performing chapman - enskog expansion , one can prove @xcite that for @xmath6 these equations reproduce the navier - stokes equation with correct convective term .    maxwell model for viscoelastic media @xcite",
    "links the elastic part of the stress tensor @xmath7 to the rate of strain @xmath8 via the linear equation with exponentially decaying elastic `` memory '' : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is an elastic coefficient and @xmath11 is a memory time . as the 6-velocity bgk model adequately reproduces the navier - stokes equation only for incompressible fluids @xmath12 , in the following we limit our consideration to this case only .",
    "then the viscoelasticity of the fluid can be taken into account by adding the maxwell elastic stress ( body force ) term @xmath13 , @xmath14\\;\\,\\delta   { \\vec v } ( \\vec{r},t ' ) dt'/\\,\\t,\\ ] ] to the right - hand side of navier - stokes equation . in terms of chapman - enskog expansion @xcite this elastic term",
    "has the same order ( @xmath15 ) as the standard viscous term . hence to reproduce the elastic term ( [ fnv ] ) in corresponding continuous ( navier - stokes ) equation we must add its lattice equivalent to the relaxation term in the lattice - boltzmann equations ( [ lb ] ) : @xmath16 here @xmath17 is calculated similarly to ( [ fnv ] ) , but with the discretized time : @xmath18+\\delta \\vec{u}(\\vec{r } , t){\\m\\over\\t},\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the discrete laplace operator for the hexagonal lattice : @xmath20,\\ ] ] and @xmath21 are equilibrium velocities at sites @xmath22 .",

    "( [ upd]-[du ] ) formally define our model .",
    "thus , to include the maxwell viscoelastic effects into the standard lb method , one just needs to add a new local vector field ( [ f ] ) to the standard bkg lb relaxation term ( [ upd ] ) , which is updated each time step for every lattice site @xmath23 . in the following section we first qualitatively and",
    "then quantitatively check the proposed lb method ( [ upd ] ) using three examples : a transverse velocity autocorrelation function for free evolving system with random initial velocities , a boundary - driven propagating shear waves , and a resonant enhancement of oscillations in a periodically driven fluid in a capillary .",
    "to check whether our model have viscoelastic properties at all , we measure the fourier transform of transverse velocity autocorrelation function @xmath24 , where @xmath25 where @xmath26 here the sum on @xmath27 corresponds to the averaging of @xmath28 on the @xmath27 coordinate of the sample .    .",

    "the axes are @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31    .",
    "sketch of the fourier transform of the transverse velocity autocorrelation function , @xmath24 , for the lb system without elastic interaction .",
    "the axes are @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath32    in our simulation we use the following parameters : relaxation parameter @xmath33 ( which corresponds to viscosity @xmath34 ) , elastic coefficient @xmath35 , memory time @xmath36 , lattice of @xmath37 sites , maximum time @xmath38 and random initial occupation numbers corresponding to average density per site @xmath39 .",
    "the simulation results , averaged over 100 initial configurations , are presented in fig .  1 and fig .  2 for the lb models with and without elastic effects , respectively .",
    "two symmetric branches @xmath40 , clearly noticeable in fig .",
    "1 , which correspond to propagating shear waves , indicate that the lb model defined by ( [ upd ] ) indeed exhibits viscoelastic properties .    to get more quantitative insight on the elastic feature of our model , we first derive dispersion relations for the continuous shear waves in the framework of the maxwell model .",
    "linearized navier - stokes equation with maxwell elastic term for transverse velocity of incompressible fluid reads : @xmath41\\;\\delta v(t ' ) { dt'\\over\\t}.\\ ] ] after inserting @xmath42 and discarding exponentially decaying terms , we obtain @xmath43 or separating real and imaginary parts of @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 : @xmath47}}\\times\\\\ \\left\\ { \\sqrt{\\m\\om\\t+\\sqrt{(\\m\\om\\t)^2+[\\n(1+\\om^2\\t^2)+\\m]^2}}+ \\right .",

    "but lb systems with too small viscosity and too large elastic coefficient turn out to be numerically unstable . either for random initial conditions or for small drive , we experimentally determined that domain of stability is roughly limited by @xmath52 and @xmath53 for these boundary values of viscosity and elastic coefficient we find that @xmath54 reaches its minimum when @xmath55 , at which @xmath56 to check whether our model reproduces this continuous prediction , we perform the following simulation . we consider a @xmath57 lattice with periodic boundary conditions in @xmath58 direction and reflecting boundary conditions in @xmath59 direction .",
    "the reflection form the @xmath60 wall is periodically modulated so that the @xmath58 components of the velocities after reflection were set to be proportional to @xmath61 . simulations were performed for @xmath33 , ( or @xmath62\\approx 0.042 $ ] ) , elastic coefficient @xmath35 , memory time @xmath63 , and the period of oscillation @xmath64 corresponded to the theoretical minimum of @xmath54 , @xmath65 .    .",
    "plot of the @xmath58 component of the average velocity @xmath66 measured at the times @xmath67 , @xmath68 vs. the distance form the driving wall @xmath27 .    .",

    "the simulation results are presented in the figures 3 and 4 .",
    "3 shows the plot of the @xmath70 component of velocity @xmath66 , measured at the times @xmath67 , @xmath68 and averaged over @xmath70 and @xmath71 . in the fig.4",
    "the square root of mean square velocity @xmath69 is plotted as a function of distance from the wall @xmath27 .",
    "we observe that @xmath72 ( wavelength of oscillation is equal to 10 ) and @xmath73 , which , given the discrete nature of the lb simulations , is in good agreement with the theoretical values ( [ pred ] ) for illustrative purposes , figs  3,4 contain results obtained using similar system , but without the elastic effects ( @xmath74 ) , for which @xmath75 .",
    "finally , let us consider one more example on which the viscoelastic properties of our lb approach can be quantitatively studied : a periodically volume - driven fluid in a capillary .",
    "the model consists of a @xmath76 elongated lattice with stick boundary conditions for long walls and periodic boundary conditions for short walls .",
    "a uniform time - periodic volume force @xmath77 , directed along the longer walls , is applied to the fluid in the capillary . in the lb update scheme ( [ upd ] ) it is implemented by adding the driving force @xmath78 to the elastic force @xmath79 in the relaxation term on the right hand side of the lattice equation .",
    "as the fluid in the capillary exhibits shear elasticity , there should be a resonance when the driving frequency @xmath80 coincides with the intrinsic oscillation frequency @xmath81 of elastic media in the capillary .",
    "to study the resonance , we look at the driven oscillations of the first fourier harmonic of velocity along the applied force , @xmath82 where the integration on @xmath83 stands for averaging along the length of the capillary . in the presence of volume force @xmath78 , a linearized navier - stokes equation yields for the steady state amplitude of the first fourier harmonic @xmath84 : @xmath85   + i\\om[{q^2\\m\\t\\over 1 + \\om^2 \\t^2}-1]},\\ ] ] where @xmath86 is a wavevector of the first harmonic .",
    "the resonance is achieved when the absolute value of this expression has the maximum , i.e. when the second bracket in denominator becomes equal to zero , @xmath87 also , when a system is in resonance , there no phase shift between driving force and induced oscillation so that the ratio between the force and the oscillation amplitudes is real . to check whether our lb model behaves",
    "as predicted by the continuous navier - stokes equation , we performed a simulation using the following parameters : @xmath35 , @xmath33 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 ; frequency of the drive @xmath90 was equal to @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 .",
    "the measured values of the @xmath84 are presented in fig.5 .    .",
    "amplitude of the first fourier harmonic @xmath84 as a function of time for different driving frequencies , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 .",
    "after a short transient period the system approaches the steady state .",
    "as predicted by ( [ amp ] ) , for resonant drive ( @xmath94 ) the steady state amplitude of oscillation @xmath97 ; while for off - resonance drive , @xmath96 and @xmath98 , the amplitudes @xmath84 are at least twice smaller . to study a phase shift between the drive and induced oscillations",
    ", we also plotted a driving force for the resonant frequency , @xmath99 .",
    "one can observe that there is no visible phase shift between driving and induced oscillation , which confirms that the shear elastic resonance frequency of our lb model is well reproduced by the continuous expression ( [ res ] ) .",
    "we also observe that when the drive frequency @xmath90 is below or above the resonance frequency @xmath81 , the induced oscillations are phase - delayed and phase - advanced , respectively , which again follows from ( [ res ] ) .",
    "three examples , considered in this section , indicate that for a variety of physical systems , the behavior of the proposed viscoelastic lb model is qualitatively and quantitatively described by the continuous navier - stokes equations with maxwell viscoelastic term .",
    "it allows us to conclude that our model indeed reproduces the maxwell viscoelasticity for the incompressible fluid flow .",
    "we proposed a simple yet versatile approach of incorporating viscoelastic effects into lattice boltzmann simulations for 6-velocity 2d bgk model generalization for more sophisticated lb schemes which includes 3d and higher - velocity models is straightforward .",
    "although , for computational stability and efficiency reasons , our approach has not yet allowed us to reach a limit of pure elastic solids , it works well in the range of parameters typical for most naturally - occurring viscoelastic media .",
    "we leave consideration of more sophisticated than the maxwell viscoelastic models for the future .",
