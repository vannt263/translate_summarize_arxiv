    ", spatial hypersurfaces are naturally discretized into quantum analogues of polyhedra @xcite .",
    "the areas of the 2-faces are determined by spin labels .",
    "in addition , each polyhedron carries an intertwiner , which determines ( up to quantum uncertainty ) the dihedral angles between the 2-faces . in spinfoam models ,",
    "one discretizes space__time _ _ , again with spin and intertwiner quantum numbers on the 2-faces and 3-faces .",
    "the spins and intertwiners in the bulk of the spacetime region are summed over .",
    "while it is clear that one should also sum over the combinatorics of the discretization , there is no agreement about which combinatorics should be allowed .",
    "a simple possibility is to demand that the spinfoams correspond to simplicial decompositions .",
    "this establishes a direct link to regge calculus .",
    "an obvious difference between regge calculus and lqg / spinfoams is that in the latter , there is no concept of edge lengths , or indeed of edges .",
    "the combinatorics and the quantum numbers all refer to 2-faces , 3-faces and 4-volumes .",
    "early on , carlo rovelli suggested @xcite that lqg is related to a new type of regge calculus , now known as area regge calculus . in area regge calculus ,",
    "the fundamental variables are not the edge lengths , but the triangle areas .",
    "since a 4-simplex contains both ten edges and ten triangles , the areas can determine its geometry just as well as the edge lengths ( at least on the level of degree - of - freedom counting ; the correspondence is not one - to - one when right angles are involved @xcite ) .",
    "it turns out @xcite that area regge calculus is fundamentally different from the standard length - based calculus .",
    "first , the deficit angles are forced to vanish on - shell .",
    "second , the theory allows for metric discontinuities .",
    "this is in contrast to other variants of regge calculus ( e.g. @xcite ) , which simply rewrite the same dynamics in different variables .",
    "the area calculus is _ also _ different from canonical lqg and from the eprl spinfoam . while lqg spins are directly analogous to the triangle areas , there is no variable in the area calculus that would correspond to lqg intertwiners",
    "nevertheless , there exists a quantum gravity model to which area regge calculus is relevant .",
    "that model is the barrett - crane spinfoam @xcite , the predecessor of eprl .",
    "we review its relation to area regge calculus and to the eprl model in section [ sec : review : bc ] .",
    "the question whether area regge calculus is a viable discretization of gr has so far remained open . in section",
    "[ sec : review : arearegge ] , we review the state of the art on this issue",
    ". we then proceed to expand on it in two ways . in section [ sec : concept ] , we discuss the conceptual advantages of area regge calculus in discussing finite - region observables in quantum gravity .",
    "we argue that it allows notions of evolution of 3d hypersurfaces , and especially of 2d surfaces , that avoid the `` problem of time '' associated with transverse diff - invariance .    despite this , in section [ sec : ricci ] , we indicate an apparent technical failure of the theory . after establishing a seemingly natural regularization scheme",
    ", we argue that non - trivial solutions of euclidean area regge calculus always carry nonzero scalar curvature @xmath8 at the triangles .",
    "this scalar curvature has the same sign at each triangle , and thus can not be averaged away .",
    "this is in contradiction to pure gr , whose solutions have @xmath9 .",
    "the argument also extends to lorentzian spacetime , if all the triangles are spacelike and all the tetrahedra have the same signature .",
    "this includes the case of spacelike tetrahedra , which is the one usually considered in lorentzian spinfoams .",
    "one could hope that a nonzero ricci scalar is simply an indicator of a cosmological constant .",
    "however , this possibility is also problematic .",
    "we discuss it along with several others in section [ sec : discuss ] .",
    "it appears , then , that area regge calculus is not a valid discretization of gr , at least not in the sectors of interest for either euclidean or lorentzian spinfoams .",
    "we thus end up agreeing with the abandonment of the barrett - crane model .",
    "+      within a single 4-simplex , standard regge calculus and area regge calculus agree .",
    "however , they lead to quite different pictures on a larger triangulation @xcite . in the area calculus",
    ", two neighboring 4-simplices may disagree on the geometry of their shared tetrahedron .",
    "this is because a tetrahedron s geometry has six degrees of freedom , out of which its face areas supply only four .",
    "thus , in the area calculus , the metric is discontinuous across 4-simplex boundaries . on the other hand , the equations of motion of the area calculus force all the deficit angles to vanish : @xmath10 thus , if it were nt for the discontinuities , we would say that all the solutions are flat . however , the discontinuities are important , and may provide an alternative source of curvature .",
    "let us look closer at the nature of the metric discontinuities .",
    "consider a triangle , shared by several tetrahedra and 4-simplices ( figure [ fig : triangle ] ) .",
    "the 4-simplices all agree on the triangle s area , but in general disagree on its angles .",
    "thus , as we cross successive tetrahedra in the triangle s normal plane , the triangle s metric undergoes area - preserving deformations . infinitesimally , such deformations are encoded by a @xmath11 traceless symmetric matrix @xmath12 , i.e. by a shear tensor .",
    "these are the same degrees of freedom that encode the amplitude and polarization of a gravitational wave .",
    "another peculiarity of the area calculus is that spatial hypersurfaces , considered in isolation from the bulk spacetime , do not have a determinate metric . in simplicial gravity ,",
    "a spatial hypersurface is a triangulated 3d manifold composed of tetrahedra .",
    "now , in standard regge calculus , the geometry of these tetrahedra is determined by their edge lengths .",
    "in contrast , in the area calculus , one only has the face areas .",
    "as noted above , these do not suffice to determine a tetrahedron s geometry .",
    "the tetrahedra in the hypersurface only acquire a metric once we are given the areas of the other triangles in the 4-simplices that contain them .",
    "the metric of the hypersurface is then obtained by patching the tetrahedra together . whenever neighboring tetrahedra in the hypersurface do not share a 4-simplex",
    ", the metric may be discontinuous across their boundary .",
    "also , as with a single tetrahedron , the 4-simplices on either side of the hypersurface induce two different geometries .",
    "thus , the hypersurface has two metrics : an `` initial '' one and a `` final '' one .",
    "it has long been unclear whether area regge calculus is a discretization of gr , or indeed of any continuum theory .",
    "the literature contains several positive indications .",
    "a perturbative analysis on a hypercubic lattice @xcite shows that the number of true degrees of freedom is the same in standard regge calculus and in the area calculus .",
    "an analysis of a simple class of solutions with a discontinuity across a single hyperplane @xcite recovers the `` refractive wave '' geometries , introduced in @xcite as generalized solutions of gr .",
    "moreover , the allowed discontinuities were found to agree with the junction conditions in linearized gr .",
    "the barrett - crane spinfoam model uses spin degrees of freedom to encode triangle areas in a spacetime triangulation . unlike the eprl model",
    ", it has no intertwiner degrees of freedom to encode the angles between triangles in a tetrahedron .",
    "the large - spin limit of the barrett - crane 4-simplex amplitude @xcite reduces to the action of area regge calculus , with an important caveat : each 4-simplex separately can have the sign of its action flipped , or worse yet , it can fall into a degenerate configuration .",
    "in fact , the large - area limit of the amplitude is dominated by these degenerate contributions .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that for simple triangulations , the degenerate contributions can be damped by a boundary state peaked both in areas and in dihedral angles . however , it s unclear in this approach how to avoid degenerate 4-simplices in the bulk of a large triangulation .",
    "non - degenerate contributions with the opposite sign of the regge action are also puzzling .",
    "see @xcite for a discussion .",
    "a version of the model without sign - flipped actions was proposed in @xcite .",
    "the sign - flipped action and the degenerate 4-simplices persist in the eprl spinfoam @xcite .",
    "there exist proposals to overcome them by modifying the model @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we give the barrett - crane model the benefit of the doubt with regard to the `` wrong '' contributions to the large - spin limit and their implications .",
    "we focus on the `` correct '' contribution , which corresponds to area regge calculus , and ask whether it is viable . this question is largely answered in the negative in the lqg community , in part due to the mismatch between the degrees of freedom in the barrett - crane model and the kinematical state space of lqg .",
    "this mismatch is exemplified in the 4-simplex `` graviton propagator '' calculation @xcite , which showed that the barrett - crane vertex does nt respond correctly to the intertwiner data in the boundary state . on this issue",
    ", we again give the barrett - crane model the benefit of the doubt ; we do not owe allegiance to the lqg kinematical hilbert space .",
    "let us , then , judge the barrett - crane model in its natural classical setting , which is area regge calculus . note that in this setting , there is by definition no problem with the 4-simplex `` graviton propagator '' : in area regge calculus , there are no variables to vary in a 4-simplex other than its triangle areas .",
    "the question remains : on its own terms , is area regge calculus a faithful discrete version of gr ?",
    "the difficulties in quantum gravity are both conceptual and technical .",
    "the conceptual problems are greatly simplified when dealing with observables at the boundary of asymptotically flat or asymptotically ads spacetime .",
    "quantum gravity then reduces to finding an s - matrix , or all possible boundary correlators , respectively .",
    "supergravity , perturbative string theory and ads / cft have made great progress in defining and calculating such observables , albeit never in fully realistic settings .",
    "the harder questions in quantum gravity refer to finite regions within the spacetime s bulk .",
    "what happens near the singularity of a black hole ?",
    "what is the precise fate ( operationally ! ) of locality , causality and unitarity ?",
    "what is the probabilistic content of quantum mechanics when applied to finite - region geometries ?",
    "one could try to argue , given the success of the descriptions on the spacetime s boundary , that these are red herrings : precise physics exists only at infinity , and that s that .",
    "however , the questions persist .",
    "observers most likely can fall into black holes . from that moment on , at least classically , infinity is inaccessible and the singularity unavoidable .",
    "more universally , modern cosmology implies that _ all _ observers live in a world with a positive cosmological constant , making spatial ( or null ) infinity inaccessible to _ anyone_. in such a world , there is no sense in which infinity can be approached asymptotically : the cosmological constant provides a finite large - distance cutoff .",
    "approaches to quantum gravity like lqg and spinfoams try to take seriously the issues concerning finite regions . however , they fall short .",
    "hamiltonians may be defined , transition amplitudes may be calculated , but the operational probabilistic interpretation of the theory remains unclear . a key factor in this is the operational meaning of a hilbert space and its relation to finite - time transition amplitudes .    when conducting experiments , one essentially prepares a state and then measures it at a later time .",
    "the probabilities of different measurements are then determined by quantum - mechanical amplitudes . the inner product in the hilbert space of states _ at a given time _",
    "is obtained in the limit , when the preparation and measurement are ( almost ) simultaneous . in quantum field theory , finite - time transition amplitudes are usually associated with spacetime regions as in figure [ fig : spacelike_boundary ] .",
    "the region s boundary consists of an initial 3d spacelike hypersurface and a final one .",
    "the two hypersurfaces intersect at a 2d surface .",
    "this corner surface is often taken at spacelike infinity , but this is not essential .",
    "the hilbert - space product is obtained from the transition amplitude as the two hypersurfaces draw closer and closer together .",
    "+    now , in gravity , the relative positions of the initial and final hypersurfaces in spacetime can not be easily specified a - priori .",
    "they are nonlocal functions of the metric in the bulk of the spacetime region , which is in turn dynamically determined by the initial and final data .",
    "thus , without solving the dynamics , we can not control the time separation between the two hypersurfaces !",
    "it s even impossible to control its sign : the bulk solution may be such that the two hypersurfaces intersect , thus flipping their `` initial '' and `` final '' roles .",
    "in particular , we ca nt easily construct the limit where the two hypersurfaces approach each other . as a result",
    ", it is nt clear how to give meaning to a hilbert - space inner product .",
    "a notion of time separation that _ does _ persist in the gravitational case is the corner angle between the two hypersurfaces at their intersection .",
    "this is a local quantity , encoding a singularity in the boundary s extrinsic curvature .",
    "the corner angle can be cast as an actual time difference by passing to a rindler frame in the infinitesimal neighborhood of the intersection surface . of course",
    ", specifying the corner angle does nt help with controlling the time separation throughout the boundary : away from the corner , the remarks from the previous paragraph still apply .",
    "the fact that time separation can be cleanly defined only near a 2d surface suggests that state spaces for finite - region gravity should be defined more naturally in terms of such surfaces .",
    "this is of course yet another intuitive argument for holography .",
    "the metric discontinuities in area regge calculus are usually seen as puzzling , at best .",
    "we will now point out two ways in which these discontinuities may help in addressing the issues raised in section [ sec : concept : puzzles ] .",
    "these and other issues concerning quantum gravity in finite regions are the major conceptual open problem in theoretical physics",
    ". area regge calculus does nt provide answers , but as we hope to show , it appears more suitable than standard regge calculus as a starting point in the discussion .",

    "if the hypersurface is spacelike ( or null ) , these two geometries can be designated as `` initial '' and `` final '' .",
    "we thus have an instantaneous evolution of the hypersurface geometry , where it s clear that the initial and final geometries are indeed on the same hypersurface in spacetime .",
    "as discussed in section [ sec : concept : puzzles ] , it is this notion that appears necessary in order to define a hilbert space of hypersurface geometries .",

    "regge calculus , as we rotate in the normal plane , the triangle s geometry undergoes shear discontinuities across 4-simplex boundaries . in other words , the triangle s conformal metric _",
    "evolves _ as a function of the angular ( rindler ) time coordinate .",
    "moreover , the equations of motion of area regge calculus set the deficit angle around the triangle to zero .",
    "this means that the periodicity of the angular coordinate is always the same , with no dependence on the specific solution .",
    "thus , around every triangle , there is a predetermined notion of rindler time , with different solutions inducing different histories of the triangle s conformal metric .",
    "we now return to the central question : is area regge calculus a discretization of gr ? to address it , we must have some notion of riemann curvature in a simplicial geometry with metric discontinuities .",
    "it was pointed out in @xcite that the curvature of a discontinuous metric is ill - defined . since the christoffel symbols contain derivatives of the metric , they become distributional .",
    "the riemann tensor must then contain products of these distributions , which are ill - defined in general .",
    "one should nt conclude from this singular nature of the curvature that area regge calculus can not describe gr .",
    "indeed , standard regge calculus is singular in its own way .",
    "there , a closed loop encircling a triangle carries a deficit angle .",
    "this angle does nt change as we shrink the loop to an arbitrarily small area .",
    "one could therefore say that the riemann curvature diverges !",
    "as discussed in @xcite , the regge action avoids this problem by effectively always drawing the loop around a face of the voronoi ( dual circumcentric ) lattice . in this way",
    ", the loop is kept at a natural , finite area . in the area calculus",
    ", a similar kind of smearing may be able to defuse the distribution - squared nature of the curvature at tetrahedra .",
    "let us provisionally take this point of view .",
    "also , as in standard regge calculus , let us treat the curvature as if it is concentrated around the triangles .",
    "this seems more promising than looking at the discontinuity across each tetrahedron separately .",
    "a single triangle can be viewed as maintaining its 2d plane and its area , while its conformal metric evolves as a function of the angle in the normal plane .",
    "a triangle - based description successfully captures the discontinuity across each tetrahedron - once for each of the tetrahedron s faces .",
    "moreover , it is at triangles that the on - shell vanishing of deficit angles takes effect .",
    "these considerations suggest that we focus on the metric around a single triangle .",
    "this metric can be written as : @xmath13 here , the @xmath14 are coordinates in the triangle s plane , while @xmath15 are polar coordinates in the normal plane . due to the vanishing deficit angle , @xmath16 has the standard @xmath17 periodicity .",
    "different signatures can be incorporated by allowing complex @xmath15 .",
    "if the normal plane is euclidean , @xmath16 ranges in @xmath18 .",
    "if the normal plane is lorentzian , @xmath16 ranges in @xmath19 , with different values @xmath20 in the plane s four quadrants @xcite .",
    "@xmath21 ranges in @xmath22 when the radius is spacelike and in @xmath23 when it is timelike .",
    "if the discontinuities across 4-simplex boundaries are taken literally , then the triangle s metric @xmath24 makes sudden jumps at values of @xmath16 where there is a tetrahedron ( see figure [ fig : triangle ] ) . here",
    ", we will consider a regularization where the discontinuities are smeared out in @xmath16 , so that the triangle s shear @xmath25 under @xmath16 evolution is finite .",
    "the condition that the triangle s area is independent of @xmath16 can be encoded as a tracelessness condition : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the inverse of @xmath28 .",
    "the christoffel symbols and the riemann tensor of the metric have the following non - vanishing components : @xmath29 where indices on @xmath12 are raised with @xmath27 .",
    "the ricci scalar reads : @xmath30 in the last equality , we used the area - preserving condition . as anticipated above ,",
    "if we take the discontinuities at the 4-simplex boundaries literally , @xmath12 becomes distributional , making ill - defined . on the other hand ,",
    "if we smooth out the discontinuities into a finite @xmath12 , then only the origin of the normal plane is singular ( note that @xmath28 is indeterminate there ) .",
    "the null rays in a lorentzian normal plane may be also singular , if they carry a nonvanishing @xmath12 .",
    "however , unless there is a null tetrahedron along one of these rays , it makes sense to keep @xmath31 only in the relevant ( spacelike or timelike ) quadrants .",
    "a smeared version of the ricci scalar in area regge calculus may get contributions not only from the local value , but also from the holonomy around the origin in the triangle s normal plane .",
    "in fact , this is where curvature comes from in standard regge calculus .",
    "it turns out , however , that in the area calculus , this extra contribution vanishes .",
    "consider transporting a vector @xmath32 along a closed loop in the @xmath16 direction .",
    "under parallel transport with the connection , the components of @xmath32 evolve as : @xmath33 due to the vanishing deficit angle , the overall change in @xmath34 along a closed loop vanishes .",
    "there may be a nonzero change in @xmath35 , which will contribute to ( a smeared version of ) the riemann component @xmath36",
    ". however , this component makes no contribution to the ricci tensor .",
    "we conclude that the mean ricci scalar around the triangle is fully accounted for by the local value .",
    "now , for spacelike @xmath28 , the square @xmath37 is always non - negative . if in addition @xmath38 has the same sign wherever @xmath31 ( recall that @xmath21 is imaginary for timelike radii ) , then the ricci scalar has the same sign everywhere . in the simplicial geometry ,",
    "spacelike @xmath28 and a constant sign of @xmath38 at the ( smeared ) discontinuities correspond to spacelike triangles and to tetrahedra that are either all spacelike or all timelike .",
    "in such a case , we conclude that the ricci scalar @xmath39 has the same sign around all the triangles , and thus has a non - vanishing mean value .",
    "the only exception is when @xmath40 everywhere , i.e. when the metric is flat with no discontinuities .",
    "nonzero @xmath39 of course contradicts the field equations of pure gr .",
    "we conclude that area regge calculus , at least in the sector with all triangles spacelike and all tetrahedra of a fixed signature , is not a discretization of gr .",
    "the non - trivial solutions of the area calculus in this sector do not satisfy einstein s equations .",
    "in this paper , we pointed out a serious problem with area regge calculus : it is prone to develop nonzero ricci curvature .",
    "we focused on the ricci scalar in particular , since its mean value is easier to define than that of the full ricci tensor .",
    "the theory s euclidean sector appears completely ruled out , since all non - trivial solutions are characterized by a positive ricci scalar . in the lorentzian , the sector with spacelike triangles and either all - spacelike or all - timelike tetrahedra is similarly ruled out .",
    "these cases cover the setups that are usually considered in the spinfoam literature .",
    "we conclude that spinfoam models that reduce to area regge calculus rather than standard regge calculus are very probably non - viable .",
    "this rules out the barrett - crane model .",
    "the refractive - wave solution of @xcite evades our argument , since the discontinuity there is along _ null _ tetrahedra .",
    "one may be tempted to construct a version of area regge calculus where all tetrahedra are null .",
    "unfortunately , this is impossible for combinatoric reasons @xcite : 4-simplices with null tetrahedra can not triangulate spacetime , due to a mismatch between the numbers of `` spacelike '' and `` timelike '' wedges between tetrahedra .",
    "in addition , null tetrahedra lead to infinite dihedral angles , making the regge action ill - defined .",
    "it remains logically possible that some sector of lorentzian area regge calculus , featuring both spacelike and timelike tetrahedra , may correspond to discretized gr .",
    "we consider this unlikely .",
    "one may also hope that the non - vanishing ricci scalar hints at gr with a cosmological constant .",
    "however , the model has no characteristic length scale , except perhaps the scale of the discretization .",
    "thus , even if the ricci scalar somehow develops a _ constant _ mean value , as is necessary for gr with cosmological constant , then the cosmological radius will be at the same scale as the discretization - an unwanted outcome in itself .",
    "another important possibility is that our negative result is an artifact of the intuitive regularization scheme that lead to the metric .",
    "if someone comes up with a better way to approach the metric discontinuities , it would be most welcome . as laid out in section [ sec : concept ] , the special properties of area regge calculus sit well with the author s intuitions about quantum gravity .",
