    "many problems in physics require an understanding of the non - equilibrium properties of highly excited states of a quantum field theory .",
    "the principal motivation underlying the present work is to understand the nature of phase transitions in the very early universe , in particular those that might give rise to inflation @xcite .",
    "most discussions of inflation assume that the non - equilibrium state of the relevant system of quantum fields can adequately be characterised by expectation values governed by a classical potential .",
    "however , calculations which attempt to go beyond this classical approximation indicate that it may be seriously inaccurate ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "non - equilibrium effects are also likely to be important in the context of baryon - number violation at the electroweak scale @xcite and in the study of quark - gluon plasmas formed in heavy - ion collisions @xcite , as well as in many aspects of condensed matter physics .",
    "our own long - term programme , set out in @xcite , has as its goal a complete description within perturbation theory of the dynamics of symmetry - breaking phase transitions .",
    "an essential requirement is to formulate perturbation theory in such a way that the evolving state of the non - equilibrium quantum fields is taken adequately into account in the low orders of the perturbative expansion which are likely to be tractable .",
    "the standard closed - time - path formalism @xcite which deals with real - time phenomena in thermal equilibrium was generalised by semenoff and weiss @xcite to apply to a real scalar field with a time - dependent action , such as might arise in a robertson - walker spacetime .",
    "however , the propagators entering their feynman rules depend on the state of the field essentially through single - particle occupation numbers which are fixed at their initial values , and therefore do not properly reflect the evolution of the state .    in earlier work",
    "@xcite we have shown , for real scalar fields how this difficulty may be overcome . by adding a suitable counterterm ( which we call the `` dissipative '' counterterm ) to the quadratic part of the action , and subtracting it from the interaction , we obtain a lowest - order theory in which the absorptive parts of loop contributions to the 2-point functions are partly resummed into the unperturbed propagators . as a result , these propagators contain quasiparticle occupation numbers which evolve with time in the expected way .",
    "interestingly , the form of the counterterm is rather similar to the action encountered by hu and various collaborators ( see e.g. @xcite and references given in these papers ) .",
    "these authors use the feynman - vernon influence functional technique to obtain the effective action for a quantum field in the presence of environmental variables ( which can be thought of as a heat bath ) when the latter are integrated out .",
    "our procedure can be thought of as a self - consistent treatment of a field which provides its own heat bath , though none of the modes of this field are integrated out .",
    "a similar structure also arises in non - equilibrium formulations of thermo - field dynamics ( see e.g. @xcite ) but this formalism turns out to equivalent to a version of quantum statistical mechanics restricted to gaussian initial density matrices @xcite    in dealing with a realistic model ( such as the standard model or a grand unified theory ) , one naturally meets complex scalar , spinor and gauge fields and it is essential to extend the non - equilibrium formalism to encompass fields of these kinds .",
    "( real - time perturbation theory for scalar , spinor and gauge fields in equilibrium is discussed , for example , by kobes _",
    "et al _ @xcite . )",
    "the purpose of the present work is to extend the formalism to complex scalar fields , giving particular attention to the effects of a non - zero chemical potential , which turns out to be non - trivial . in section",
    "ii we obtain the structure of the matrix of 2-point functions in the closed - time - path formalism , which is applied in section iii to find the most general permissible form of the dissipative counterterm .",
    "the corresponding unperturbed propagators are derived in section iv , where we find that , in the presence of a non - zero chemical potential , not only occupation numbers but also decay widths and thermal masses are different for the quasiparticle modes corresponding to particles and antiparticles . in section v we evaluate the dissipative counterterm at the lowest non - trivial order and find , with suitable approximations , that the time - dependent occupation numbers obey a kinetic equation of the boltzmann type .",

    "we , on the other hand , have set about calculating unambiguously defined green s functions in an optimal manner . for us , the quasiparticle modes and their occupation numbers simply provide a convenient way of thinking about quantities which arise naturally in the course of these calculations , and the boltzmann equation is a low - order approximation to a rather more complicated second - order evolution equation .",
    "the novel aspects of the work reported here concern the effects of a non - zero chemical potential . to the extent",
    "that the quasiparticle picture is valid , we find that not only the occupation numbers but also the decay widths and thermal masses of the quasiparticles are different for particle and antiparticle modes . in particular , the difference in thermal masses is a two - loop effect ( in the @xmath206 theory ) , which is not readily apparent in the usual perturbative treatment ( see e.g. @xcite ) , although it should be derivable from a two - loop calculation of the self - energy , even in equilibrium .",
