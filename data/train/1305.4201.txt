    "<S> strategies based on homodyne detection have great practical advantages @xcite , and for this reason their performances have been analyzed in realistic situations . in particular , receivers based on homodyne detection has been theoretically @xcite and experimentally investigated @xcite in the presence of losses and phase insensitive thermal noise . </S>",
    "<S> more generally , these receivers have been proved to represent the optimum gaussian strategy for the discrimination of the psk coherent signals @xcite , and it has been also demonstrated that it possible to emulate adaptive processes by means of postprocessing and bayesian analyses @xcite . </S>",
