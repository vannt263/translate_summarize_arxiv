    "martin harwit ( @xcite ) might say we have rediscovered in h@xmath1the interstellar cirrus that was discovered first in the infrared by iras ( @xcite ) .",
    "such a rediscovery is not insignificant .    to measure anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background , astronomers must first measure and subtract foreground emission from the milky way s interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "three components of foreground emission from the ism are important ( @xcite ) : 1 ) bremsstrahlung ( or `` free - free '' ) emission from free electrons accelerated by interactions with ions in a plasma , 2 ) synchrotron emission from relativistic electrons accelerated by magnetic fields , and 3 ) thermal emission from dust . the h@xmath1  images directly trace the free - free component , because ionized gas emits h@xmath1  and bremsstrahlung in direct proportion .",
    "in addition , the h@xmath1  images indirectly trace the thermal emission from that dust associated with the ionized medium .",
    "this paper shows that h@xmath1 and 100 @xmath9 m emissions are weakly correlated at high galactic latitude .",
    "high latitude , filamentary nebulosities have been observed before ( @xcite , @xcite , and references in each ) , but verifying the emission to be h@xmath1 in particular had not been possible .",
    "in fact , guhathakurta & tyson ( 1989 ) showed that the optically broad - band red color of cirrus is not due to h@xmath1 emission , but may be due to luminescence of hydrocarbons .",
    "kogut et al ( 1996 ) have shown that multi - frequency radio emissions ( commensurate with free - free ) are correlated with 140 @xmath9 m emission .",
    "broadbent , haslam , & osborne ( 1989 ) have shown that free - free emission and thermal dust emission are positively correlated at low galactic latitude , i.e. emissions from h ii regions .    at low galactic latitudes ,",
    "there is considerable confusion for optical tracers of gas : where there is gas , there tends to be dust too , and the dust that is emitting at 100 @xmath9 m , for example , is absorbing h@xmath1  light . even at high latitudes , where dust opacity is minor ( @xcite ) , for any integral along a line of sight ,",
    "the 100 @xmath9 m surface brightness is proportional to the density of dust , whereas the h@xmath1  surface brightness is proportional to the electron density _ squared _ ( see section [ discussion ] ) . for these reasons",
    ", we do not expect a strict proportionality between the h@xmath1  and infrared emissions .",
    "our h@xmath1  images provide not absolute surface brightnesses but only relative ones .",
    "the same is true of the iras images .",
    "we do not attempt absolute calibration of the h@xmath1  surface brightness because our h@xmath1  filter s 1 nm bandpass is too wide to suppress geocoronal h@xmath1 , which is typically a few rayleighs and varies with time ( @xcite ) .",
    "fabry - perot spectroscopy allows absolute calibration of h@xmath1  surface brightness , and the infrared has been calibrated by cobe .",
    "however , to compare iras and h@xmath1  images , it suffices to filter out the background in the same way for both images , and that we have done ( see section [ data ] ) .",
    "the observations were made at the mt .",
    "laguna observatory with a wide - field , narrowband imaging camera similar and yet superior to other such cameras ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we attached it `` piggy - back '' upon a 1-m telescope , which was used solely for blind pointing and tracking ; no acquisition or guiding was necessary .",
    "the camera consists of a filter wheel , a 135-mm f/2.8 lens , and a 2048@xmath02048 pixel ccd . with the 135-mm lens ,",
    "the 15-@xmath9 m pixel spacing corresponds to 0.38/pixel , and a field of view of 13@xmath013 .    to tune the center wavelength of the 1.0 nm wide ( fwhm ) h@xmath1  filter , the filter wheel was thermoelectrically cooled and thermostatically controlled to a precision of 1  c.",
    "the temperature was set such that the h@xmath1  filter s transmission of zero - velocity h@xmath1  peaked off the optical axis while maintaining the on - axis transmission to greater than 75% of the peak . at off - axis angles of @xmath14 ,",
    "the transmission of zero - velocity h@xmath1  drops below 50% , so each image is cropped at a radius of 4.8 .",
    "other than cropping , we made no attempt to correct for the radial dependence of the sensitivity to zero - velocity h@xmath1  .considering that and other potential errors , we estimate our absolute scaling of h@xmath1  surface brightness could be in error by as much as a factor of 1.5 .",
    "observations of external galaxies show the velocity coverage extends from @xmath15 km / s to @xmath16 km / s .",
    "the backside illuminated ccd has a quantum efficiency at 656.3 nm of 95% ( @xcite ) .",
    "the sensor is cooled with liquid nitrogen to -120  c , so for these observations , dark current is negligible .",
    "the noise of the readout amplifier is 9  e@xmath17 rms , but the integration times were selected so that the readout noise would be negligible compared to the poisson noise of the sky s photons .",
    "forty - eight pairs of exposures were taken over a period of 5 nights , september 21 - 25 , 1995 .",
    "each pair consisted of a continuum image followed by an h@xmath1  image while the telescope turned at the sidereal rate for the duration of the pair .",
    "each continuum image was a 1-minute exposure through a r band filter , except for the first few , which were 2 minutes each ( and which had too many saturated stars ) .",
    "each h@xmath1exposure was 20 minutes ; the total observing time on - source was 16 hours .",
    "the images were dithered ; that is , the telescope was repositioned after each pair of images .",
    "the dithering pattern was a 5@xmath05 grid with 1  spacing , covered almost twice with the 48 image pairs .",
    "we observed the north america nebula and barnard s loop to calibrated the h@xmath1  surface brightness .",
    "these two h  ii regions have surface brightnesses of 850 r and 153 r ( each @xmath1810% , @xcite ) , averaged over 48  diameter fields centered on 21h00m.0 + 4500  [ 2000 ] and 05h53m.8 -0608  [ 2000 ] .",
    "much of the data reduction is aimed at eliminating stars from the images while preserving the diffuse h@xmath1  emission .",
    "the stars are suppressed in a number of ways : 1 ) continuum subtraction , 2 ) flagging pixels that are bright in continuum , 3 ) flagging pixels at the locations of filter - induced flares near very bright stars , and 4 ) median filtering with a spatial scale larger than a stellar image .",
    "the ccd bias was determined by overscanning . the relative gain correction for the ccd pixels ( the `` flat field '' )",
    "was determined by observing the zenith at sunset in order to minimize gradients and curvatures ( @xcite ) .",
    "each continuum image was scaled by a constant and subtracted from the h@xmath1  images .",
    "the constant was empirically - determined based upon stars in each field .",
    "the continuum - subtracted images invariably exhibited a smooth intensity pattern with radial symmetry about the optical axis .",
    "the radial pattern may be due to telluric line emission , although it could also be due to the combination of vignetting and inaccuracy of the flat fields . in any event",
    ", the circular pattern was removed by fitting and subtracting circular isophotes .",
    "our experience has been that continuum subtraction is adequate for faint stars , but inadequate for bright stars .",
    "invariably , the two images are not focused identically or they are not registered well enough or both . in the presence of these systematic errors and the increased poisson noise at the positions of bright stars , it is worthwhile to excise those pixels near bright stars from the data .",
    "we flag pixels in the h@xmath1images based upon their respective intensities in the r band images , and flagged pixels are excluded when computing the medians described below .",
    "each image was median filtered spatially with a 2  diameter ring median filter ( @xcite ) .",
    "each median - filtered image was subtracted from its original to eliminate large scale intensity variation due to the variation in airmass across the field , residual inaccuracies in flat fielding , or the occasional telluric cirrus cloud . to check that this procedure was not eliminating real emission from the milky way",
    ", we also reduced the data without this median filtering step , but instead substituted fitting and subtracting a plane of intensity .",
    "the two methods give similar results .",
    "the images were registered automatically to a common coordinate system , using a few dozen sao stars on each image to determine the appropriate shift , expansion , rotation , and distortion .",
    "the 48 registered images were combined by averaging them pixel by pixel , while excluding flagged pixels . also , an iterative procedure eliminated those individual pixel values that were further than @xmath19 from the median of the other values for that particular pixel .",
    "finally , a ring median filter of radius 2.3  was applied , and then the image was convolved with a circular gaussian of width @xmath20 .",
    "the h@xmath1  image ( figure [ fig1 ] ) appears similar to the corresponding area of sky observed by iras at 100 @xmath9 m ( figure [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "we have inscribed boxes in figures [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] that contain the two most apparent similarities : 1 ) at left , a filled arc of 100 @xmath9 m emission , enveloped by an arc of h@xmath1emission , and 2 ) at center - top , a potato - shaped outline in both 100 @xmath9 m and h@xmath1  emission .",
    "and 100 @xmath9 m images is available from the author . ]    to quantify the association between the h@xmath1 and 100 @xmath9 m emissions , we evaluated their ( pearson ) correlation coefficient , @xmath21 , over the central 8.5@xmath08.5  subregions of the 13@xmath013  images .",
    "the sugregion was selected because the effective observing time is less near all edges of the h@xmath1  mosaic and because residual , circular artifacts of the mosaicing process are apparent near the western edge .",
    "we also correlated the h@xmath1 image with 36 controls .",
    "the controls are 100 @xmath9 m iras images from `` random '' but statistically similar directions on the sky , centered at galactic coordinates b = @xmath22 , l = 1 , 21 , ... , 341 .",
    "each control was created and processed like the image in figure 2 .",
    "the controls should be uncorrelated with the h@xmath1 image ( i.e. the expectation value , @xmath23 ) , so they provide a standard by which to judge the validity of our measured correlation .",
    "the distribution of correlation coefficients of the 36 controls is approximately gaussian , with @xmath9 = -0.017 and @xmath24 = 0.041 ( see figure [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "the measured correlation coefficient ( @xmath25 ) is statistically significant from zero by @xmath26 . from the controls we can conclude with @xmath895% confidence5% likelihood that the two emissions are uncorrelated ( @xmath27 ) , i.e. that the measured correlation is due solely to chance . ]",
    "that @xmath28 , but we should not immediately conclude that @xmath29 .",
    "mathematically , we expect @xmath30 to be larger than @xmath31 because noise in the data tends to reduce @xmath32 from its true value .",
    "physically , we expect @xmath30 to be larger or smaller for various directions on the sky .",
    "for example , in the boxes of figures 1 and 2 , which were inscribed because the emissions within them looked similar , @xmath33 .    the bias of @xmath30 due to noise in the two images can be estimated , and it is not large .",
    "we let @xmath34 equal the variance of the infrared intensity and we let @xmath35 equal the variance of the h@xmath1 intensity , both as measured over the inner 8.5@xmath08.5  subregions .",
    "the @xmath34 and @xmath35 each include both genuine variation of emission and random noise .",
    "we evaluate the noise variances in each image , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , by computing the average of the variances in small regions apparently lacking emission . if the ratios @xmath38 and @xmath39 are both large compared to unity , the bias is small and more precise estimates of the noise are not warranted .",
    "the measured values are @xmath40 and @xmath41 . in",
    "can be shown that the ratio of the true to the observed ( pearson ) correlation coefficients is @xmath42 which in this case is 1.19 and is smaller than the fractional uncertainties of both the statistical variation of @xmath30 estimated from the controls and the spatial variation evident from the value of @xmath33 of the alternative subregion .",
    "accounting for the bias of noise , we estimate @xmath11 .",
    "having established that the 100 @xmath9 m and h@xmath1 emissions are weakly correlated , we evaluate the ratio of the two correlated emissions by a linear fit of the form , i(100 @xmath9 m ) = a i(h@xmath1 ) + b , to the data within the central 8.5@xmath08.5  subregions of the two images . the slope `` a '' is of interest ; the value `` b '' is not , because the zero points of both the 100 @xmath9 m intensity and the h@xmath1intensity are arbitrary . because both the 100 @xmath9 m and h@xmath1 emissions have substantial observational errors , ordinary least squares fitting is invalid .",
    "we fit the data by two methods as described below .",
    "both methods allow for errors in each of the observed quantities .",
    "the first method is based upon the work of @xcite .",
    ", not @xmath43 as originally printed .",
    "] it yields a value for the slope a = 1.2(@xmath44 ) @xmath13 , under the assumption of additive gaussian errors of zero mean and variances of ( 0.17 mjy sr@xmath5)@xmath45 and ( 0.077 r)@xmath45 , for the 100 @xmath9 m and h@xmath1  emissions , respectively .",
    "we determined the variance of the h@xmath1  emission , ( 0.077 r)@xmath45 , from an ensemble of 1-dimensional gaussian fits to the bivariate distribution of 100 @xmath9 m and h@xmath1 emissions by rows ; the variance of the 100 @xmath9 m emission was determined similarly , but by columns ( cf .",
    "figure 4 ) . note that those variances include real ( but uncorrelated ) emission in addition to detector and shot noise",
    "; the uncorrelated emissions act as approximately gaussian `` errors '' with respect to the correlated components of the emissions .",
    "we consider the formal error ( @xmath46 ) to be a lower limit of the true error . to investigate empirically the reliability of the slope estimate",
    ", we performed the same analysis separately on the four quadrants of the central 8.5@xmath08.5  subregion .",
    "the slopes so measured were 1.5 , 1.4 , 1.3 , and 0.6 @xmath13 for the nw , ne , sw , and se quadrants , respectively .",
    "the second method is a simplification of the `` bces '' method of @xcite .",
    "bces refers to `` bivariate correlated errors and intrinsic scatter '' ; our simplification is to assume that the observational errors of the 100 @xmath9 m and h@xmath1 emissions are uncorrelated .",
    "we evaluate the observational errors by examining small regions apparently lacking emission .",
    "the standard deviations so measured are 0.07 mjy  sr@xmath5 and 0.04 r , for the 100 @xmath9 m and h@xmath1 emissions respectively .",
    "the bces bisector slope ( see @xcite ) , evaluated over the central 8.5@xmath08.5  subregion , yields the same slope as the first fitting method , a = 1.2 @xmath13 .",
    "likewise , the bces bisector slopes for the nw , ne , sw , and se quadrants are 1.68 , 1.31 , 1.16 , and 1.53 @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "the result of averaging the 8 slopes from the four quadrants and the two methods is a = @xmath12 @xmath13 .",
    "the mean value given is a vector average ( i.e. @xmath47 , i = 1 , ... , 8) .",
    "the excursions ( @xmath48 and @xmath49 ) describe the 1@xmath24 dispersion of the 8 slopes , also calculated vectorially , not arithmetically .",
    "additional observations are required to determine if the dispersion of slopes is statistical or intrinsic to the ism .",
    "the brightest object in the h@xmath1  image has no counterpart at 100 @xmath9 m , illustrating that the correlation between 100 @xmath9 m and h@xmath1  emissions is not true in general .",
    "to the contrary , additional observations at lower galactic latitudes ( @xmath50 ) and of less sensitivity show many h@xmath1  features with no infrared counterparts ( @xcite ) .",
    "those additional images also show h@xmath1infrared correlations , both positive and negative . at the lower galactic latitudes ,",
    "there is considerable confusion .",
    "the brightest object in figure [ fig1 ] may be associated with the magellanic stream ; it lies between two h  i peaks of ms iv ( @xcite ) and its long axis is parallel to the magellanic stream .",
    "if so , it is the brightest h@xmath1  emission from the magellanic stream ( cf .",
    "however , it might be simply a density enhancement in the ism unrelated to the magellanic stream .",
    "the critical test is to measure its velocity .",
    "the h@xmath1  light we observe could be from either a reflection nebula or an emission nebula , or both . in this section",
    "we show that the reflection component is expected to be small compared to the reflection component .    in the case of a reflection nebula ,",
    "the surface brightness of the h@xmath1light is proportional to the product of the surface emissivity in h@xmath1of the disk of the milky way and the dust column density along the line of sight . using canonical values for the surface emissivity , the ratio of dust to gas , and the dust s scattering cross section and phase function , jura ( 1979 )",
    "predicts the surface brightness of the h@xmath1   light i@xmath51 ( in rayleighs ) backscattered from dust : @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the total hydrogen column density .    in the case of an emission nebula ,",
    "the surface brightness of the h@xmath1light i@xmath51 ( in rayleighs ) is proportional to the emission measure ( @xcite ) : @xmath54 where t@xmath55 is the electron temperature in units of @xmath56  k. in the warm ionized medium of the ism , t@xmath57 ( @xcite ) . the emission measure em @xmath58 has units @xmath59pc .",
    "the region is assumed to be optically thick to lyman lines ( a.k.a .",
    "case b ) , and extinction is ignored , but otherwise , equation [ recomb ] is derived directly from the fundamental physics of recombination .    from the emission measures and dispersion measures along the high - latitude lines of sight to a few globular clusters containing pulsars , reynolds ( 1991a ) shows that the density of high latitude ionized gas , where it exists% of the volume . ]",
    "is @xmath80.08 @xmath60 and the ratio of the ionized hydrogen column density to the total hydrogen column density ranges from 0.2 to 0.4 ( @xcite ) , with an average of 0.27 for the five lines of sight .    combining the emission and reflection contributions to the h@xmath1surface brightness using the above values from the literature , we find @xmath61 where we have expressed the em as a product of the volume density , n@xmath62 , and the ionized hydrogen column density , n@xmath63 , by approximating @xmath64 .",
    "the latter approximation is valid if hydrogen is the dominant ion and if the electron volume density is bimodal , i.e. either @xmath65 is 0.08 @xmath60 or it is zero",
    ".    equation [ iha ] predicts the emission component to be @xmath83 times greater than the backscattered component .",
    "the backscattering component will be less than a third of the emission component if the gas is either denser or more highly ionized than we have assumed .",
    "reynolds et al ( 1973 ) estimate the ratio of backscattered to total h@xmath1  light to be 0.1 ( @xmath66,@xmath67 ) toward a few lynds nebulae .    it is well known that dust and neutral hydrogen are positively correlated in general ( @xcite ) , but is that true in this region ?",
    "the three h  i maps of highest resolution and sensitivity ( @xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) are inadequate to allow us to answer this question because the beams are too large ( 0.5  fwhm ) and the sensitivity is too poor ( the r.m.s . is equivalent to @xmath68 to a few times 10@xmath69 @xmath4 ) .",
    "the _ peak _ 100 @xmath9 m emission , @xmath80.5 mjy sr@xmath5 above the background , corresponds to a _",
    "h  i column density of 6@xmath010@xmath69 @xmath4 , assuming @xmath70 mjy sr@xmath5 ( @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , we analyzed the h  i column density data of heiles & habing ( 1974 ) exactly as we did the h@xmath1 data above and found no statistically significant correlation with the 100 @xmath9 m data .",
    "the h  i&infrared correlation coefficient is @xmath71 , which corresponds to @xmath72 less than zero ( @xmath73 is evaluated as before using thirty six 100 @xmath9 m controls ) .",
    "the anticorrelation of h  i&infrared in the same region where h@xmath1&infrared is positively correlated is intriguing , but it is not statistically significant .",
    "the anticorrelation also is opposite in sign to the firmly established results of boulanger & perault ( 1988 ) .    in section [ results ] the slope of the correlated components of the 100 @xmath9 m and h@xmath1 emissions",
    "is estimated to be @xmath12 @xmath13 . from 4 years of cobe data ,",
    "kogut et al . (",
    "1996 ) determine the slope of the correlated components of the antenna temperature @xmath74 of the dmr at 31.5 ghz with respect to the 140 @xmath9 m surface brightness @xmath75 measured with dirbe : @xmath76 .",
    "in so far as free - free emission dominates thermal dust emission at 31.5 ghz , the slope @xmath77 corresponds to a ratio @xmath78 , which is similar to the @xmath79 ratio derived in this work . on the @xmath87  angular scale of dmr ,",
    "@xcite conclude that more than one third of ( and perhaps `` the bulk of '' ) the free - free emission must be from that component correlated with 140 @xmath9 m emission . at much smaller angular scales ,",
    "the bulk of the h@xmath1 emission is not correlated with 100 @xmath9 m emission ( section [ results ] ) ; thus it appears that the correlation between ionized gas and dust emissions increases with increasing angular scale .",
    "an h@xmath1  image of a 13@xmath013  region at ( l , b ) = ( 71,@xmath80 ) shows structure @xmath810 times fainter than the 12@xmath010  region of sky at ( l , b ) = ( 144,@xmath81 ) previously observed by reynolds ( 1980 ) .",
    "the new image gives a preliminary view of the sky over many degrees at unprecedented sensitivity .",
    "the new h@xmath1  image weakly resembles the 100 @xmath9 m iras image ; a point - by - point comparison of the two shows a positive correlation ( @xmath82 ) ; and comparison with cobe data indicates that the correlation coefficient increases with increasing angular scale .",
    "the slope of the correlated components of the 100 @xmath9 m and h@xmath1 emissions is @xmath12 @xmath13 .",
    "an important extension of this work ( already underway by many investigators ) will be to image the h@xmath1 emission over much of the sky .",
    "an all - sky h@xmath1 image may prove critical to distinguishing the galactic foreground from the cosmic background at the precision necessary to determine cosmological parameters .",
