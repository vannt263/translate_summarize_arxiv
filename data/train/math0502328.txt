    "the goal of this work is to give a calculation of the heegaard floer homology groups of the product @xmath12 of a closed oriented surface @xmath0 of arbitrary genus @xmath13 with a circle .",
    "this problem has been addressed in part in other places @xcite , @xcite , mainly as illustration of calculational techniques ( some of which are used here ) .",
    "our interest is more particular .",
    "a standard construction in smooth and symplectic 4-dimensional topology is the normal connected sum , or `` fiber sum '' construction where , in the simplest instance , neighborhoods of closed surfaces of the same genus and trivial normal bundle are removed from two 4-manifolds and their complements glued along their boundary .",
    "indeed , together with a short list of other basic constructions , this operation gives rise to all known examples of exotic closed 4-manifolds .",
    "these examples are typically distinguished via gauge - theoretic invariants using either ad - hoc arguments or an appeal to general product theorems ( or a combination ) .",
    "the 4-manifold invariants of ozsvth and szab @xcite are expected to give the same information as the seiberg - witten invariants but are in some cases easier to work with ( results in this direction include the vanishing theorems for sums along @xmath14-spaces by ozsvth and szab @xcite and the rational blowdown formulae by roberts @xcite ) .",
    "an approach to understanding the behavior of ozsvth - szab invariants under fiber sum is to interpret the invariants as the result of a certain pairing of relative invariants of the complements of the surfaces in each 4-manifold , invariants taking values in the floer homology of the boundary @xmath12 .",
    "this strategy is carried out in @xcite ; the results of the latter article are largely based on the techniques and theorems of the present paper .",
    "a more ambitious goal is to study the ozsvth - szab invariants of general fibered 3-manifolds .",
    "there is a sense in which the floer homology of such a 3-manifold @xmath15 is a module over the heegaard floer homology of the trivial fibered 3-manifold @xmath12 ( and in particular @xmath16 should have the structure of a ring ) . indeed ,",
    "the pair - of - pants construction should lead to a product @xmath17 where @xmath18 is an orientation - preserving diffeomorphism and @xmath19 denotes the mapping torus of @xmath20 ( c.f .",
    "again , the basic information relevant to the study of this structure is an understanding of the floer homology of @xmath12 .",
    "this paper deals with floer homology with `` untwisted '' coefficients , though much of the technical work accomplished here is applicable to the more general situation . for this reason ,",
    "the results here are not directly relevant to the problems mentioned above .",
    "indeed , the behavior of ozsvth - szab invariants under composition of cobordisms is functorial only modulo an indeterminacy ( requiring a sum over structures in general ) , which is best handled by passing to floer homology with twisted coefficient modules . however , even the untwisted floer homology of @xmath12 is surprisingly rich for such a simple manifold , and we hope that the results here will have independent interest .",
    "we summarize the results of the paper .",
    "first , as mentioned above , certain parts of this problem have been understood by ozsvth and szab . recall that",
    "if @xmath21 is a structure on @xmath12 such that the chern class @xmath11 is not a multiple of the poincar dual of the class @xmath22\\in h_1(\\sigma_g\\times s^1;{\\mathbb{z}})$ ] , then @xmath7 vanishes by the adjunction inequality @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the adjunction inequality also implies that if @xmath11 is dual to @xmath23 $ ] then we obtain a similar vanishing unless @xmath24 ( or @xmath25 when @xmath26 ) .",

    "the factor @xmath36 is declared to lie in degree @xmath37 , and as usual @xmath38 carries grading @xmath39 .    ozsvth and szab also calculated @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the structure with @xmath42 , in the cases @xmath26 @xcite , @xmath43 @xcite , and @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "thus , at least at the level of graded @xmath28$]-modules , all heegaard floer homology of @xmath12 was previously known except @xmath40 with @xmath5 .",
    "the calculation of these groups is the main goal of this paper .    to state the result",
    "we introduce some notation .",
    "if @xmath45 is a symplectic vector space of dimension @xmath46 then there is a natural operation @xmath47 given by wedge product with the symplectic form ( after using the symplectic form to identify @xmath48 ) , and a natural adjoint map @xmath49 .",
    "the _ primitive _ subspace @xmath50 of @xmath51 is defined to be the kernel of @xmath14 , where @xmath52 , and the _ coprimitive _ subspace @xmath53 is the kernel of @xmath54 .",

    "some remarks are in order .",
    "first , note that the reduced group @xmath76 vanishes for @xmath77 ( this was observed already by ozsvth and szab ) , and is nontrivial for @xmath5 .",
    "in fact , the reduced group is nontrivial in degrees from @xmath78 to @xmath79 .",
    "second , the identification of @xmath76 with @xmath80 $ ] on the level of graded groups does not respect the action of @xmath38 .",
    "see remark [ remarks ] below for more details .",
    "the floer homology in large degrees can be understood as follows .",
    "once @xmath81 , the groups @xmath82 are all isomorphic ; according to the theorem they are identified with the sum @xmath83 or @xmath84 depending on the parity of @xmath85 . identifying the primitives and coprimitives as above",
    ", we see that in each sufficiently large degree there is an identification @xmath86 ( forgetting the grading on the right hand side ) .",
    "a more suggestive interpretation can be given as follows .",
    "consider the jacobian torus @xmath87 of @xmath0 .",
    "then @xmath88 carries a natural `` symplectic '' cohomology class @xmath89 corresponding to the intersection pairing on @xmath90 .",
    "let @xmath91 be the total space of the @xmath2 bundle @xmath92 whose euler class is @xmath93 ; then it follows quickly from the gysin sequence that the cohomology @xmath94 can be identified with the ( co)primitive cohomology of @xmath88 : @xmath95 here `` primitive '' is defined via multiplication and contraction by @xmath96 on @xmath97 .",
    "the previous description of the large - degree behavior of @xmath98 can be summarized in the statement ( which follows from theorem [ mainthm ] ) @xmath99,\\ ] ] after adjusting the grading on @xmath6 by a half - integer .",
    "note that it is not quite true that the image of @xmath6 in @xmath100 is @xmath101/u\\cdot{\\mathbb{z}}[u]$ ] , since the coprimitive pieces appear in gradings too small by two .",
    "lee and packer @xcite calculated the integer cohomology @xmath102 using the gysin sequence together with results from combinatorial matrix theory .",
    "according to their results , @xmath102 contains considerable torsion : indeed , cyclic summands of any given order @xmath103 appear in @xmath102 for all @xmath104 . the calculations in the current paper that lead to bear a substantial similarity to those in @xcite ( c.f .",
    "remark [ contrrem ] below ) , and lead one to suspect that holds with @xmath73 replaced by @xmath8in particular that torsion elements of any given order appear in @xmath105 for large enough @xmath1 . at the moment , however , we are satisfied with the following .",
    "the floer homology @xmath106 has dimension @xmath107 for each @xmath29 .    since @xmath108 and @xmath109 for all sufficiently large @xmath29 , we conclude :    the floer homology @xmath110 ( and therefore also @xmath105 ) contains @xmath111-torsion for all @xmath5 .",
    "in fact , the identification also holds with @xmath73 replaced by @xmath112 .",
    "these results are proved in section [ mod2sec ] , where the mod-2 floer homology @xmath113 is determined .",
    "it can also be shown by direct ( though computer - assisted ) calculation using the approach in this paper that @xmath110and therefore also @xmath105contains elements of order 3 for all @xmath114 and elements of order 4 for all @xmath115 .",
