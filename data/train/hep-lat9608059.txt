    "recently it has become apparent that coarse anisotropic lattices with @xmath12 can be very useful in performing accurate monte carlo simulations of qcd at low computational cost .",
    "this is especially true when modeling heavy quantum states of qcd  like glueballs , for example . because of the exponential fall off of the signal , small @xmath6 gives better resolution of the correlators at an early time step . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath5 should be kept relatively large because of critical slowing down .    since the anisotropy of the lattice breaks the euclidean invariance of the continuum theory , it induces temporal @xmath13 and spatial @xmath14 correlation lengths which scale as @xmath15 so that @xmath16 .",
    "on the other hand , the autocorrelations in monte carlo updates are proportional to a power of the correlation length @xmath17 where theoretically @xmath18 for local stochastic updates and @xmath19 for cluster / overrelaxation updates .    in practice",
    ", different lattice operators will have very different autocorrelation times , and we expect operators that couple strongly to @xmath13 to have larger @xmath3 .",
    "unfortunately `` interesting operators '' in lattice qcd , like those for glueballs , live in the spatial domain and scale with @xmath20 which is large .",
    "this work tries to address the issue of the scaling behavior of different gluon operators on anisotropic lattices , and their relevance to the problem of mc algorithm optimization .",
    "the doubler - free gluon action used in this study is given by @xmath21 this is a symanzik - improved lattice action  @xcite , which is accurate up to errors @xmath22 ( classically ) .",
    "the tadpole - improvement scheme is @xmath23 because of the assumption @xmath24  @xcite .",
    "we examine anisotropic lattices with spatial lattice spacings @xmath5 from 0.25 to 0.4 fm and anisotropy @xmath25 ranging from 1/2 to 1/5 .",
    "the mean spatial tadpole - improvement factor @xmath8 varies from 0.772 to 0.807 . for every lattice",
    "considered we generate a corresponding markov chain of 4000 configurations ( _ i.e. _ mc sweeps ) , which are viewed as monte carlo time series of appropriate lattice operators .    on these time series",
    "we perform autocorrelation measurements on six lattice observables : pss , pst , rss , rst1 , rst2 and act , which are shown in fig .",
    "[ plqs ] .",
    "in fig .  [ awil ] and fig .  [ arec ] we present comparison graphs of the autocorrelation functions for the simple plaquettes and the @xmath11 rectangles .",
    "at small anisotropy of the lattice the autocorrelation times of the spatial and temporal gluon operators are small and almost indistinguishable .",
    "=    =    =    =    with increasing ( inverse ) anisotropy , @xmath26 , the degeneracy lifts .",
    "the autocorrelation times increase for pss and rss , and remain small and degenerate for pst , rst1 and rst2 observables .",
    "this is to be expected , since pss and rss couple strongly to @xmath20 .",
    "as can be observed from the graphs our autocorrelation functions distinguish well between the spatial and temporal modes on the lattice , and can be a good starting point for the optimization procedure .",
    "the integrated autocorrelation times for an observable @xmath27 are obtained using the method proposed by sokal  @xcite , namely @xmath28 with @xmath29 and @xmath30 chosen so that @xmath31 .",
    "the smallest value of @xmath30 for which @xmath32 has been chosen in a self - consistent manner .",
    "from here we derive an estimate for the error of @xmath3 given by the formula @xmath33 we call this criterion  `` criterion @xmath34 ''",
    ".    we also double check our results against the procedure employed by the qcd - taro collaboration  @xcite , wherein the autocorrelation time is defined as : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is determined so that @xmath3 is maximized , but @xmath37 of the total sample and @xmath38 .",
    "likewise , we call this criterion ",
    "`` criterion @xmath39 '' .",
    "we use hybrid overrelaxation updating scheme , which is considered to be the state - of - the - art algorithm for bosonic systems when no cluster algorithm is available  @xcite .",
    "it simply consists in the mixing of cabibbo - marinari pseudo - heatbath and the brown - woch microcanonical overrelaxation sweeps with a ratio @xmath40  @xcite .",
    "in fig .  [ err ]",
    "we show our final results for the dependence of the integrated autocorrelation time on the anisotropy of the lattice for the six lattice observables .",
    "we find small variation of the amplitude of the integrated autocorrelation time @xmath3 for the temporal loops .",
    "the error bars for these observables are small .",
    "it is apparent that the modes are strongly suppressed because they effectively propagate in the spatial domain with characteristic correlation length @xmath42 , which is small .",
    "in contrast , the integrated autocorrelation times for the spatial loops increase as @xmath26 increases .",
    "this study is an initial attempt to perform accurate studies of qcd gluon update dynamics on lattices with large spatial lattice spacing and small temporal lattice spacing .",
    "this work is at an early stage of development .",
    "we have found clear evidence that the spatial and temporal link variables have different autocorrelation behavior , and that this difference becomes more extreme as the anisotropy is increased .",
    "we hope to look for an optimal update scheme for anisotropic simulations .",
    "this will be accomplished by exploiting the freedom we have on such lattices to vary pseudo - heatbath and overrelaxation updates on the spatial and temporal links independently .",
    "since the action has explicitly broken euclidean symmetry , we can expect that an optimal update scheme will involve different update methods for spatial and temporal links .",
    "we anticipate the optimal update method will involve overrelaxation of the spatial links ( which have been shown here to have the longest autocorrelation times ) with heatbath updates of temporal links to ensure the overall update is ergodic ."
