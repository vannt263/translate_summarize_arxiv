    "the set of homology cylinders has a natural product operation given by stacking , so that it forms a monoid denoted by @xmath2 .",
    "the study of the monoid @xmath2 was initiated by goussarov @xcite and habiro @xcite in their theory of clasper surgery and finite type invariants of 3-dimensional manifolds . in their study ,",
    "a quotient group of the monoid by clasper surgery equivalence was introduced and its structure was intensively clarified in massuyeau - meilhan @xcite and habiro - massuyeau @xcite .    on the other hand , garoufalidis and",
    "levine @xcite introduced another equivalence relation by considering homology cobordisms of homology cylinders and they defined the quotient group @xmath3 called the _",
    "homology cobordism group _ of homology cylinders . to understand the structure of the group @xmath3",
    "is considered to be important because it is quite likely that the structure provides an efficient way of understanding the set of homology cobordism classes of 3-dimensional manifolds as the braid group contributes to knot theory . in this paper , we focus on this group @xmath3 ( and its generalization to higher dimensional cases ) .",
    "another motivation for studying the monoid and groups of homology cylinders comes from the fact that they include the mapping class group @xmath4 of @xmath0 , and moreover share many properties .",
    "in fact , garoufalidis - levine @xcite , levine @xcite and habegger @xcite gave a deep relationship to the theory of johnson homomorphisms used originally in the study of @xmath4 and its subgroups .",
    "in pursuing more relationships between @xmath4 and @xmath3 , it should be an important step to determine and compare their abelianizations .",
    "as for @xmath4 , it was first shown by harer @xcite that the abelianization is trivial ( namely , the group @xmath4 is perfect ) except a few low genus cases . on the other hand ,",
    "the abelianization of @xmath3 has not yet been determined ( see section [ sec : abelian ] for details ) .    in our previous paper @xcite ,",
    "we introduced two kinds of invariants of homology cylinders : the magnus representation and the reidemeister torsion .",
    "both invariants are crossed homomorphisms from the monoid @xmath2 to some groups of matrices .",
    "it was observed that the magnus representation factors through @xmath3 , while the reidemeister torsion does not so . in the same paper , we found many abelian quotients of _ sub_monoids of @xmath2 and _ sub_groups of @xmath3 .",
    "however no information was extracted on abelian quotients of the whole monoid and group .",
    "it had been conjectured that @xmath3 was perfect for general @xmath1 along the comparison with @xmath4 .",
    "after that , however , cha , friedl and kim @xcite succeeded in showing that the abelianization of @xmath3 is infinitely generated by using a version of the reidemeister torsion which we will call the _ @xmath5-torsion _ in this paper .",
    "in fact , they took an appropriate reduction of the torsion invariant so that the resulting map becomes a homology cobordism invariant homomorphism .",
    "the purpose of the first half of this paper is to use ( the determinant of ) the magnus representation together with cha - friedl - kim s reduction technique to investigate again abelian quotients of @xmath3 .",
    "it looks easier to extract information on @xmath3 than cha - friedl - kim s invariant because the magnus representation itself is a homology cobordism invariant as mentioned above .",
    "however , the result turns out to be somewhat negative .",
    "in fact , we will observe in section [ sec : abelian ] that the invariant obtained from the magnus representation subordinates to cha - friedl - kim s invariant .",
    "the situation changes if we consider homology cylinders over higher dimensional manifolds , which seem to have their own interest , and apply the machinery to them . to explain this is the purpose of the second half .",
    "the main theorem ( theorem [ thm : acymag ] ) is that the homology cobordism groups of homology cylinders over a certain series of manifolds regarded as a higher dimensional generalization of surfaces have abelian quotients isomorphic to the free abelian group of infinite rank . for the proof , we use a purely group - theoretical description of the magnus representation as the representation of the automorphism group of the _ acyclic closure _ of a free group .",
    "this description was first given by le dimet @xcite in the context of string links , and then we clarify its relationship to homology cylinders in our previous paper @xcite .",
    "the definition of the acyclic closure , which is originally due to levine @xcite , and its fundamental properties are reviewed in section [ sec : acyclic ] .",
    "we prove the theorem by constructing first an epimorphism from the homology cobordism group onto the automorphism group of the acyclic closure of a free group ( theorem [ thm : acysurj ] ) and then showing that this automorphism group has an abelian quotient isomorphic to the free abelian group of infinite rank ( theorem [ thm : h1acy ] ) .",
    "all manifolds are assumed to be smooth throughout this paper , while similar statements hold for other categories .",
