    "a characteristic of partial orders and partially ordered sets ( posets ) as used in order theory @xcite is that they are amongst the simplest structures which can be called `` hierarchical '' in the sense of admitting to descriptions in terms of _ levels_. these levels are typically identified via a rank function as an integer - valued function on a poset which increments with the covering relation .",
    "but rank functions are only available on graded posets , where all saturated chains connecting two elements are the same length .",
    "effectively , each element in a graded poset can be assigned a unique , singular vertical level .",
    "we have extended the concept of a rank function to all finite posets by making it interval - valued @xcite , and establishing it as an order homomorphism from a base poset to a poset over real intervals , for one of many possible order relations on intervals .",
    "an interval - valued rank reflects information about chain lengths to an element dually from both the top and the bottom of the poset , and a standard , or canonical , interval rank function is available as the largest such function , measuring specifically the maximum length maximum chain from both top and bottom .    as mentioned above",
    ", various ordering relations are available over intervals .",
    "the order ordinarily identified on intervals we call the strong order , where comparability is equivalent to disjointness .",
    "but we have identified @xcite two other orders as being much more useful for interval rank function available on intervals : a weak order ( actually the product order on endpoints ) and ordering by subset .",
    "these are ( nearly ) conjugate orders , in that they `` partition '' the space of pairwise comparisons of order elements .",
    "we begin this paper by considering standard interval rank for the conjugate to the weak order . and since interval rank functions are order homomorphisms to an interval order , it is also natural to ask about interval rank functions applied reflexively on whatever poset of intervals we have chosen",
    ". this motivates studying the structure of the homomorphic image of a poset under the standard interval rank operator , both singly and in repeated iterations .",
    "we close with a discussion of how the use of experimental mathematics , using computers as a tool to explore problems and form conjectures , influenced this work .",

    "therefore , we generated many random bounded posets of sizes between 10 and 25 ( 200 posets of each size ) to get similar data . see section [ expaspect ] for a discussion on the method used to generate random posets .",
    "figures [ sizestats ] , [ numitersstats ] , and [ heightstats ] show the box plot and regression for the size of @xmath46 vs. size of chain , size of @xmath46 vs. number of iterations to a chain , and height of @xmath46 vs. height of chain respectively . from the limited amount of data",
    "it appears that the the number of iterations that must be done to get to the total preorder is roughly linear in the number of elements in the poset .",
    "the compression that we get in the end is approximately @xmath378 .",
    "throughout section [ structurerpl ] we mentioned the use of experiments to make conjectures or gather data . `` experimental mathematics '' was once an oxymoron , however with the advent of computer algebra systems ( e.g. , maple and mathematica ) and more powerful computers , it has gained much more acceptability .",

    "@xcite we use it in our work as a tool to : ( a ) gain insight and intuition , ( b ) test conjectures , and ( c ) suggest approaches for formal proof .",
    "as we began to investigate properties of the interval rank poset , @xmath252 , we found it necessary to construct many examples .",
    "rather than construct arbitrary posets we constructed the set of all bounded posets of size less than or equal to 9 using the computer algebra system maple on a laptop with an intel core i5 - 2520 m processor and 4 gb ram .",
    "we did this by first generating all reflexive @xmath379-matrices of size between 1 and 7 .",
    "we considered these matrices as binary relations , i.e. , if the @xmath380 entry is 1 then @xmath381 .",
    "then we checked each matrix for antisymmetry and transitivity : if @xmath382 then @xmath383 , and if @xmath384 then @xmath385 .",
    "we then had to check for isomorphic copies of the same poset , i.e. , checking that permuting the rows and columns of one matrix did nt yield another matrix in the set .",
    "lastly , we added a top and bottom bound ( a row of all 1 s and a column of all 1 s ) .",
    "we generated all of the posets of size up to 6 rather quickly , even checking for isomorphic copies , there are only 318 of size 6 .",
    "however , it took many days to generate the 2045 posets of size 7 .",
    "bounding each was then a trivial step .",
    "we then had a test set of all 2450 bounded posets of size between 3 and 9 .",
    "of course , any real - world posets would be considerably larger than size 9 , however this test set allowed us to get some intuition about behavior of the @xmath175 operator .",
    "the test set of 2450 posets was enough for us to get a feeling for the structure of @xmath252 , and formulate the conjectures that would become propositions [ heightincr ] , [ widthdecr ] , [ gradedchain ] , and [ eventuallychain ] .",
    "however , for the work in section [ itrrpl ] we wanted to gather data for larger posets . because the number of posets of size @xmath308 , @xmath386 , is @xmath387 @xcite it is difficult to get a representative sample of posets of size @xmath308 .    our strategy was to generate random posets using two different algorithms , both found in @xcite .",
    "the first is the random graph model .",
    "given some @xmath388 and @xmath389 generate the erds - rnyi random graph @xmath390 .",
    "this is a graph on @xmath308 labeled vertices where each edge , @xmath391 , is included with probability @xmath349 .",
    "we then create a directed graph by directing each edge from smaller to larger , i.e. , if @xmath392 is an edge then we direct it from 1 to 2 .",
    "notice that this graph must be acyclic since there can be no decreasing edge .",
    "from here we take the transitive closure to form a random partial order .",
    "the second model is the random @xmath393-dimensional model . here",
    ", we choose @xmath393 random linear orders ( i.e. , @xmath393 random permutations of @xmath394 $ ] ) and take their intersection . by the definition of dimension , the resulting partial order has dimension at most @xmath393 .",
    "the results reported here point towards a number of continuing efforts .",
    "canonical strong conjugate : : :    in this paper we did not pursue the problem of finding a canonical    conjugate order to the strong interval order ( if one exists ) . while    the weak interval order @xmath133 and the subset order    @xmath129 stand as conjugates , in we discussed the    availability of conjugates for the strong interval order    @xmath126 .",
    "we have identified a number of possibilities    experimentally , and would like to cast the question more generally . to    do",

    "the complement of @xmath398 should be the    comparability graph for any conjugate order to @xmath126 , if    they exist .",
    "we also know that the complement of the comparability    graph of @xmath5 must be an interval graph , that is , the    intersection graph of the intervals @xmath56 .",

    "we deal more with unlabeled    posets , but note that if there are two labeled posets ,    @xmath402 with    @xmath403 then there are two    unlabeled posets with the same property .",
