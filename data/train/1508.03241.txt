    "the migration of protoplanets embedded in accretion discs has been extensively studied in recent years ( see , e.g. , review by @xcite ) .",
    "a low - mass protoplanet excites density waves in the disc at the lindblad resonances and migrates toward the star if no other torques are exerted ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , a corotation torque originating near the planet can slow or even reverse the migration ( e.g. , @xcite ) . another possible cause of slowed or reversed migration is the excitation of magnetic resonances in the disc when a relatively strong ( @xmath4 , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the pressure and magnetic field in the disc , respectively ] ) azimuthal magnetic field is present @xcite . these magnetic resonances can halt or reverse the migration of the planet if the magnetic field is sufficiently strong and it has a steep gradient toward the star",
    "the action of this mechanism has been shown in numerical simulations by @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , accretion discs threaded with a weak magnetic field are prone to the magneto - rotational instability ( mri ; @xcite ) .",
    "numerical simulations of planet migration in a turbulent disc have shown that the semimajor axis of the planet changes stochastically due to the planet s interaction with the turbulent cells in the disc .",
    "the migration rate can increase or decrease , and the direction of the migration can reverse @xcite .",
    "an initial goal of this paper was to more deeply investigate the effect of magnetic resonances on the migration of a low - mass embedded planet following the methods used by @xcite , albeit that we explored a larger parameter space with regards to the mass of the planet and the density distribution in the disc , as well as the magnetic field strength and its distribution in the disc .",
    "while exploring this expanded parameter space , we noticed the development of mri - driven turbulence in the disc in many cases .",
    "in particular , when the magnetic field is weak , non - axisymmetric density waves excited by the planet lead to perturbations in the initially - azimuthal magnetic field and , subsequently , to growth of the radial component of the magnetic field near the planet .",
    "the azimuthal field grows with time due to the stretching of the radial field lines by the differential rotation of the keplerian disc . as a result ,",
    "an mri - type instability develops and propagates to larger distances from the planet , and the disc becomes turbulent .",
    "the planet interacts with the turbulent cells , and the torque associated with this interaction is much larger than the torque seen prior to the development of turbulence ( i.e. , the torque due to magnetic resonances ) .",
    "therefore , we also studied the parameter space describing the transition from a laminar to a turbulent disc , as well as the migration of a planet in a turbulent disc in detail .",
    "we first describe how the migration rate and direction of a low - mass planet are affected by the planet mass , as well as the distribution of surface density and magnetic field in the laminar disc .",
    "we also show how these parameters alter the time at which the onset of turbulence occurs in magnetized discs .",
    "finally , to better understand the interaction between the planet and turbulent cells in the disc , we study the torque on the planet by ( 1 ) an ordered , low - amplitude density wave generated at the inner boundary and ( 2 ) a high - amplitude wave that is excited in a turbulent mhd disc .",
    "the plan for this paper is as follows . in  [ sec : theoretical background ] we overview the theory of the different sources of torque on the planet . in  [ sec : model ] we describe our physical model and numerical setup . in ",
    "[ sec : parameter space ] we describe our main parameters .",
    "we describe our test simulations in the hydrodynamical disc in  [ sec : migration hydro ] and simulations in a laminar magnetic disc in  [ sec : magres migration ] .",
    "migration in turbulent discs is shown in  [ sec : migration turbulent ] , and migration under the influence of density waves is shown in  [ sec : migration in waves ] .",
    "we conclude in  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "in this section , we discuss the causes of inward and outward migration in hydrodynamic and mhd discs .      in the absence of a magnetic field in the disc ,",
    "the migration of the planet is determined by the lindblad and corotation torques @xcite .",
    "the lindblad torque is generated when the planet excites @xmath7-armed waves in the disc with `` orbital '' frequencies @xmath8 .",
    "the dispersion relation for these waves in a low - temperature , low - mass disc is @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the epicyclic frequency in a keplerian disc .",
    "substituting @xmath11 , the locations of the lindblad resonances are @xmath12 for each value of @xmath7 ( except @xmath13 ) , there is one resonance located closer to ( farther from ) the star than the planet called the inner ( outer ) lindblad resonance . the inner lindblad resonances exert a positive torque on the planet and `` push '' the planet outward , while the outer lindblad resonances have the opposite effect . the total lindblad torque ( also known as the `` differential lindblad torque '' )",
    "determines the migration direction in the absence of other torques .",
    "the differential lindblad torque is negative , resulting in overall inward migration of the planet if there are no other sources of torque .",
    "however , there is typically a corotation torque exerted on the planet as well .",
    "the physics of the corotation torque and its effect on planet migration has been studied by number of authors ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in an isothermal disc , both the magnitude and sign of the corotation torque",
    "depend on the gradient of the surface density at the corotation radius .        in strongly magnetized laminar discs ,",
    "magnetic waves can be excited , and torques associated with the magnetic waves can affect a planet s migration .",

    "@xcite investigated the propagation of waves in a magnetized disc in which the magnetic field is purely azimuthal and found that there are two singular radii at which the frequency perturbation in a frame rotating with the fluid matches that of a slow mhd wave propagating along the field lines ; these radii define the locations of the magnetic resonances .",

    "we suggest that @xmath30 and find the position of the inner and outer magnetic resonances to be @xmath31 @xcite showed that the waves associated with the magnetic resonances can exert a positive torque on the planet that is larger in magnitude than the differential lindblad torque if the magnetic field increases toward the star .",
    "@xcite performed simulations of a planet s migration in a magnetized disc and found that the magnetic resonances can slow or stop the migration of a planet . in particular",
    ", they investigated the migration of a @xmath0 planet embedded in a disc that is threaded with an azimuthal magnetic field with @xmath32 with @xmath33 initially .",
    "they took an initial value of @xmath34 at the planet s location and found that , depending on the steepness of the magnetic field distribution ( defined by @xmath35 ) , the planet s migration slowed or reversed in direction .",
    "@xcite studied the effects of an mhd corotation torque on a low - mass planet in a 2d laminar disc with a weak azimuthal field threading the disc .",
    "the field was not strong enough to generate an appreciable torque from magnetic resonances , and it was not strong enough to dominate the hydrodynamic corotation torques , but a `` torque excess '' attributed to the presence of the magnetic field was found .",
    "the mri arises under conditions in which a weak magnetic field threads the disc and the radial component of the field can be stretched and enhanced by the differential rotation in the disc .",
    "such a seed field can either be an axial field , perpendicular to the disc @xcite , or an azimuthal field @xcite .",

    "evidently , instability can occur if @xmath49 , which happens if @xmath50 . for a keplerian disc",

    "therefore , the above - mentioned condition that @xmath52 implies that instability occurs only for @xmath53 .    _ toroidal seed magnetic field .",
    "_    @xcite studied the linear mhd stability / instability of a thin keplerian disc with a toroidal magnetic field @xmath54 .",
    "this case is more complicated than the case of a vertical field @xcite .    the complication in the toroidal field case results from the presence of both the mri instability and the buoyancy instability of the toroidal field @xcite .",
    "the buoyancy instability is triggered by an azimuthally - dependent , radially - localized vertical displacement in the plasma and the toroidal field @xcite .",
    "these authors find that the mri instability in a thin disc with an embedded toroidal magnetic field shows up in localized perturbations ( i.e. , whose wavelengths are small compared with @xmath55 ) , @xmath56 , under the conditions @xmath57 and @xmath58 , where @xmath59 .",

    "we expect that the interaction with smaller - sized turbulent cells is similar to the observed interaction with mhd waves , but that the duration of the interaction is shorter . as a result of such interactions ,",
    "a torque is exerted on the planet during short intervals of time , and the planet s semimajor axis varies stochastically under the action of these torques .    based on our observations with both the low- and high - amplitude waves we can schematically describe the interaction between a planet and a turbulent cell ( see fig . [",
    "fig : planet - cell ] ) .",
    "when the planet is at the outer edge of the cell ( the side that is farther from the star ) , the density is increasing toward the planet ( @xmath286 ) , and so we expect the torque to be negative and the planet to migrate inward .",
    "conversely , when the planet is on the inner edge of the cell ( the side that is closer to the star ) , the density decreases toward the star ( @xmath287 ) , and so we expect the torque to be positive and the planet to migrate outward .",
    "this inward - outward migration does not `` trap '' the planet , because the cell is moving away from the star , so this is a transient process .",
    "we investigated the migration of a low - mass planet ( @xmath288 ) in magnetized discs using a godunov - type hlld mhd code in polar coordinates @xcite .",
    "the initial surface magnetic field is azimuthal , with different radial distributions @xmath289 , and different strengths determined by the initial plasma parameter at the planet s location , @xmath131 , which varied between @xmath256 and @xmath224 .",
    "we also varied the initial radial surface density distribution in the disc , @xmath227 .",
    "our main conclusions are as follows :    1 .   in strongly - magnetized discs ( @xmath290 ) , and where the density distribution in the disc is flat ( @xmath226 ) , the planet s migration is strongly influenced by magnetic resonances , which are excited near the planet and",
    "exert a positive torque on the planet .",
    "the migration slows down when the magnetic field distribution is flat ( @xmath241 ) ; it slows down more strongly when the magnetic field increases towards the star ( @xmath243 ) ; and the migration reverses when the field steeply increases towards the star ( @xmath244 ) .",
    "these results are in accord with theoretical predictions by @xcite and simulations by @xcite .",
    "2 .   compared with @xcite , we investigated the effect of magnetic resonances on the migration of a planet in discs with different density distributions .",
    "we observed that the steepness of the density distribution strongly influences the rate and direction of the migration . when the density increases towards the star ( @xmath228 ) the planet migrates inward at any steepness of the magnetic field ( @xmath248 ) and the effect of the magnetic resonances is negligibly small .",
    "this is because , at larger density steepness , the negative differential lindblad torque is much larger than the positive corotation or magnetic torques . in the opposite situation , when the density in the disc decreases toward the star ( @xmath230 ) , and the positive corotation torque almost balances the negative lindblad torque , the role of the positive magnetic torque becomes very significant .",
    "the planet migrates outward due to magnetic resonances at all values of the magnetic field steepness ( @xmath245 ) .",
    "experiments with a larger mass planet , @xmath1 , show that the action of the magnetic resonances is similar to that in the case of a lower - mass planet : the positive torque increases with the steepness of the field , as predicted by the theory .",
    "we also observed that , at @xmath244 , the more massive planet migrates outward more rapidly than the lower - mass planet .",
    "this is in accord with eqn .",
    "( 65 ) of @xcite , in which the migration time scale is shown to be @xmath291 .",
    "we investigated weakly - magnetized discs with initial plasma parameter @xmath292 .",
    "we observed that non - axisymmetric motions in the disc lead to the formation of a radial component of the magnetic field , its stretching by the differential rotation in the disc , and subsequent mri- driven turbulence in the disc .",
    "interaction between the planet and turbulent cells leads to stochastic migration , similar to that observed in 3d discs by , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "we investigated the transition from the laminar to turbulent disc that often starts near vicinity of the planet , where non - axisymmetric density waves are excited by the planet .",
    "the turbulence starts more rapidly when the planet is more massive .",
    "the torques acting on the planet are larger in turbulent discs than in the laminar discs , leading to more rapid migration .",
    "however , the direction of the migration is also stochastic , and outward migration is frequently observed .",
    "6 .   to understand how planets interact with individual turbulent cells",
    ", we investigated the propagation of a planet through density waves in the disc .",
    "we observed that a planet experiences a strong negative torque when it is located inside the wave or at the outer edge of the wave ( where the density increases towards the star ) .",
    "however , when the planet is located at the inner edge of the wave ( where the density decreases towards the star ) , then it experiences a positive corotation torque , and it migrates away from the star . we conclude that the stochastic motion of the planet is connected with the alternating action of these positive and negative torques .",
