    "we revisit the kuramoto model  @xcite to investigate the phase order parameter and its dynamic fluctuations near the onset of the synchronization transition .",
    "in particular , we focus on their critical finite - size scaling ( fss ) behavior .",
    "even though the kuramoto model and its extended versions have been widely studied  @xcite , some issues persist , in particular about the above points . in the few existing studies",
    "@xcite , the critical properties near the transition point have only been partially resolved , which prompted the present work .",
    "fss is particularly important for data analysis , since real systems are always finite , and particularly so in many experimental systems , biological or not  @xcite .",
    "recently , the fss of the synchronization order parameter in the kuramoto model and several extended versions on complex networks has been investigated .",
    "an unusual fss exponent @xmath2 has been found  @xcite .",
    "this value was obtained in the classic case , hereafter referred to as the _ random distribution _",
    ", where the individual frequencies of oscillators are sampled independently according to a given unimodal distribution @xmath1 .",
    "in such a situation , oscillator frequencies can be arbitrarily close to each other even in a finite population . interestingly , when the oscillator density fluctuation along the frequency axis is suppressed in a population with _ regular distribution _ , a very different fss exponent @xmath3 is obtained . here",
    "we present details of our numerical study that led to this previously reported value  @xcite .",
    "dynamic fluctuations of the order parameter in the kuramoto model is another long - standing problem  @xcite . in the perturbation theory developed by daido  @xcite",
    ", it is claimed that they scale differently when approaching the synchronization threshold from above and from below , with the scaling exponent @xmath4 in the supercritical region and @xmath5 in the subcritical region .",
    "this result is quite surprising by itself , in the sense that conventional scaling theory predicts identical scaling behavior on either side of the transition .",
    "note that daido used the regular frequency distribution in numerical investigations as well as in his perturbation theory  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we report extensive numerical results on the fss of the order parameter and its dynamic fluctuation in the random and regular realizations of the intrinsic frequency distribution .",
    "the fss exponent in the regular case is estimated numerically as @xmath6 , half the value of its random counterpart .",
    "in contrast to daido s predictions , we find that dynamic fluctuations scale with the same exponent @xmath7 on both sides of the transition .",
    "interestingly , our data supports @xmath8 for the random frequency distribution and @xmath9 for the regular case .",
    "given the order parameter exponent @xmath10 , the hyperscaling relation @xmath11 is thus violated in the random case , but obeyed in the regular case .",
    "we finally briefly discuss the implications of our observations on the ordering process and dynamic response in the kuramoto model .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce the kuramoto model and present the two types of frequency realizations that we consider in this paper . in sec .",
    "iii , we investigate the fss of the order parameter and its dynamic fluctuations with the random frequency distribution and discuss the validity of the hyperscaling relation in the model . in sec .",
    "iv , we repeat the investigation and analysis with the regular distribution . we summarize and discuss the results in sec .",
    "v. appendix a presents the mean - field approximation to the fss in the case of the random frequency distribution .",
    "the kuramoto model  @xcite consists in a finite population of @xmath0 globally - coupled phase oscillators governed by @xmath12 here @xmath13 is the phase of the @xmath14th oscillator , and @xmath15 its intrinsic frequency .",

    "the coupling strength @xmath18 is positive ( @xmath19 ) .",

    "the sample - to - sample fluctuations arise from the randomly drawn oscillator frequencies from the distribution @xmath1 .",
    "consequently , the spacing between neighboring frequencies on the real axis is poissonian in any given realization .",
    "it turns out that this quenched noise and the nonlinear dynamic fluctuations are intimately related to each other in the sense that , when the former is removed , a very different set of fss exponents are obtained . the two types oscillator frequency distributions are discussed in sec .",
    "iii and iv , respectively .",
    "in this section , we consider the realizations ( samples ) of frequency sets @xmath16 by randomly and independently drawing frequencies from the gaussian distribution @xmath1 .",
    "we measure the phase order parameter and its dynamic fluctuation for each sample and average over many samples . in practice",

    "@xcite and explained in detail in the appendix a , for @xmath18 close to @xmath57 , eq .  ( [ eq : sce - fs ] ) admits a scaling solution of the form ( [ eq : delta_random_fss ] ) with the exponents @xmath58 the scaling function @xmath41 , however , has significant sample - to - sample fluctuations .",
    "the exponent value @xmath10 is typical of various equilibrium mean - field models described by the so - called @xmath59 theory .",
    "however , the fss exponent value of @xmath2 is quite unusual and implies much stronger fluctuations than that in ordinary models with the conventional value @xmath60 .",
    "this remarkable result has been confirmed by extensive numerical simulations  @xcite and the straightforward extension to the kuramoto model on various sparse random networks in  @xcite .",

    ", scaling in the critical region is controlled by a single fixed point in the renormalization group ( rg ) sense , and hence @xmath7 .",
    "the corresponding fss takes the form @xmath76 irrespective of the side of the transition , and the scaling function @xmath77 has the limiting behavior @xmath78    in this context , the kuramoto model is somewhat special in that each oscillator has its own intrinsic frequency and the effect of the mean - field is different on different oscillators .",
    "therefore the usual rg argument with only a few relevant variables may not apply and one should entertain the possibility that @xmath79 . in such a situation , the fss exponent @xmath43 should also be different on the two sides of the transition , so that the ratio relation @xmath80 be satisfied , in order to maintain the continuity of @xmath68 at @xmath81 .",

    "as expected , finite - size effects become huge near the transition point .",

    ", we conclude that our numerical data strongly support simple scaling exponents : @xmath115 however , a proper analytic treatment for the dynamic fluctuations in the supercritical side is lacking , and further investigations are thus needed .",
    "one should note that the dynamic fluctuations of the order parameter are not necessarily proportional to the susceptibility ( response of the order parameter to an infinitesimal external field ) in general nonequilibrium steady states due to probable violation of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",
    "it is almost trivial to derive the susceptibility exponents in the kuramoto model , which turn out to be @xmath116  @xcite .",

    "therefore it appears that dynamic fluctuations renormalize the strength of the quenched noise @xmath135 , but do not change its scaling with @xmath0 .",
    "it is interesting to compare the violation of hyperscaling in the kuramoto model to known cases in equilibrium phase transitions .",
    "one well - known such case is the incompatibility between the correlation length exponent @xmath136 at the gaussian fixed point and the mean - field exponents @xmath10 and @xmath113 above the critical dimension @xmath137  @xcite .",
    "violation of hyperscaling is also reported in the three - dimensional random - field ising model whose ordering transition is controlled by a zero - temperature fixed point@xcite . in both cases , the energy associated with the symmetry - breaking field is much stronger than the thermal energy on large length scales , hence the order parameter fluctuations , as measured by the exponent @xmath72 , become less than what is predicted by the hyperscaling relation . in this sense , the weaker dynamic fluctuations of the order parameter in the kuramoto model may be interpreted in a similar way , despite the fact that we are now in a nonequilibrium situation .",
