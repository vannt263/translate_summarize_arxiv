    "semi  classical quantum gravity has its most beautiful realisation in the context of black hole physics , where it breathes life into the equations describing their thermodynamics@xcite .",
    "the standard central quantities are the black hole s",
    "mass @xmath1 , surface gravity @xmath2 , and area @xmath3 , which are related to the thermodynamic energy @xmath4 , temperature @xmath5 , and entropy @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "an odd ( but perfectly consistent ) feature of this framework is the absence of a variable representing pressure and its conjugate , volume , two central players in traditional discussions of thermodynamics when applied to everyday substances .",
    "recent work has shown that the effective cosmological constant ,  @xmath7 , of the spacetime in question can be treated as a pressure _ via _",
    "@xmath8 , ( @xmath9 is newton s constant , and we will choose units such that @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) , and study of the resulting `` extended thermodynamics '' results in the natural suggestion@xcite that black hole mass @xmath1 determines not the internal energy @xmath4 but the _ enthalpy _ : @xmath13 , which includes a contribution from the energy of formation of the system .",
    "the thermodynamic volume @xmath14 can then be deduced in terms of the variables of the black hole spacetime in question .",
    "one interesting consequence of this is the observation that @xmath14 is not necessarily a geometrical volume defined in the spacetime at all , a fact revealed by _",
    "e.g. , _ studying rotating black holes@xcite .",
    "motivated by the ads / cft correspondence@xcite , and by the fact that consistent traditional thermodynamics can be defined for non  black  hole spacetimes ( see _ e.g. _ refs.@xcite ) , the suggestion was made in ref.@xcite to enlarge the framework of extended thermodynamics to include _ any _ spacetime , again equating the mass to the enthalpy .",
    "the result was a larger class of examples of thermodynamic volumes which are non  geometrical ( in the above sense ) , now associated to the taub  nut and taub  bolt spacetimes .",
    "the extreme example of taub ",
    "nut is especially notable for having a thermodynamic volume while there is no geometrical candidate at all .",
    "we summarise some of the results we will need in sections  2 and  3 .    in a sense ,",
    "the extended thermodynamics brings the physics of black holes closer to the physics of everyday ( non  gravitational ) substances in a manner complementary to way the ads / cft correspondence does@xcite . for example , using the standard treatment of the thermodynamics , it was discovered@xcite that the fixed charge ensemble of reissner ",
    "nordstrom black holes in ads has a rich thermodynamic phase structure reminiscent of the van der waals description of a liquid / gas system , including a line of first order phase transitions ending in a second order critical point . through ads",
    "/ cft this maps holographically to a strongly coupled fluid in an unusual universality class .",
    "this is of course an exciting and important way of defining non  traditional universality classes of fluids and other substances , given its potential use for interpreting and modelling new experimental discoveries .",
    "this is an idea that is well over a decade old@xcite . on the other hand",
    "it is intriguing to learn that black hole physics can be mapped ( at least in part ) to more traditional classes of substance , which is precisely what the extended thermodynamics has made possible .",
    "for example , that same charged black hole system , once pressure and volume are allowed to be dynamical , turns out to have the same critical properties as the van der waals system including the standard mean field exponents .",
    "several other familiar thermodynamic phase diagram phenomena ( many in traditional universality classes ) have now been mapped to black hole physics in the extended thermodynamics .",
    "work on this continues by several groups .",
    "the meaning of the extended thermodynamics and what it implies for systems described holographically by ads / cft remains to be spelled out .",
    "it is likely that the two areas can enrich each other once the right interpretation is found .",
    "as suggested in ref.@xcite , it seems clear that the natural ads / cft context where the extended thermodynamics might play a role would concern situations where there is flow between field theories , perhaps involving operators that can dynamically change the effective degrees of freedom .",
    "perhaps the extended thermodynamics is a good language for discussing dynamics on the space of field theories itself , and in the ads / cft language this boils down to dynamics on the space of holographic rg flows , a quite natural object in gauged supergravity , and perhaps string theory .",
    "intriguingly , natural thermodynamic principles , such as the second law of thermodynamics ( realised in terms of thermodynamic cycles representing heat engines and refrigerators ) would translate into statements about the kinds of processes one could do in the space of field theories ) is connected to the number of degrees of freedom in the dual field theory by virtue of being related to the rank , @xmath15 , of the dual gauge theory .",
    "note that although they did not pursue the connection , refs.@xcite also mention the link between @xmath16 and @xmath15 , and wondered as to its significance .",
    "we thank b. dolan and d. kastor for pointing this out . ] .",
    "one of the other points made in ref.@xcite is that the enlarged dynamical setting of the extended thermodynamics helps place sometimes puzzling thermodynamic properties of spacetimes into a light where they can be seen to make physical sense .",
    "for example ,",
    "ads@xmath17 with an @xmath18 slicing ( where euclidean time is an @xmath19 fibred over an @xmath20 ) has negative entropy . for fixed cosmological constant",
    "this is simply strange . on the other hand ,",
    "ads@xmath17 is a perfectly good spacetime that has just been sliced unusually . rather than discard it , it would seem prudent to simply find a context in which this slicing makes sense .",
    "putting it into the extended thermodynamics context and using the enthalpy prescription reveals that it has a negative thermodynamic volume@xcite , which might also seem odd .",
    "however , in a context where there are dynamically changing pressures and volumes , and accompanying heat flow , both work done and heat flow into the volume naturally come with both signs , and so for positive @xmath5 and @xmath16 can result in negative @xmath6 and @xmath14 , with the correct interpretation .",
    "a negative specific heat should have a natural dynamical narrative as well .",
    "it is familiar , for example in the case of schwarzschild black holes in flat space .",
    "in extended thermodynamics it becomes the specific heat at constant pressure , vanishes for static black holes@xcite .",
    "] , @xmath21 .",
    "negative specific heat suggests a thermal instability , and so we are strictly outside equilibrium thermodynamics now , but can at least start to follow the physics .",
    "the system runs to higher temperature ( like a flat space black hole radiating away its energy ) , lowering its entropy .",
    "this is a rather runaway process for a black hole in flat space , and so a discussion of it is somewhat incomplete since it runs off to regimes that lie well outside the semi  classical context in which we began . adding a cosmological constant avoids the problem altogether , rather than solving it : analogues of the schwarzschild black holes exist in ads as the solutions representing the `` small '' branch of black holes , but they never appear in the phase diagram , ( either in the standard or extend thermodynamics ) . at any pressure ( and hence @xmath7 ) the low temperature phase is ads ( with the traditional @xmath22 slicing ) , and then there is the hawking ",
    "page transition@xcite temperature above which the `` large '' branch black holes are thermodynamically favoured .",
    "so the negative @xmath21 of the black holes never needs to be interpreted .",
    "nevertheless , it seems natural to try to give negative @xmath21 an interpretation in other systems where it might not be avoided , with the help of the extended thermodynamics .",
    "we have a context in which to do so : start again with ads@xmath17 with the @xmath18 slicing .",
    "it lies on an extended phase diagram that we will explore more in this paper . we are free to adjust the temperature of this slicing by viewing ads@xmath17 as part of the taub  nut  ads class of spacetimes@xcite , characterised by nut charge @xmath23 , with temperature @xmath24 .",

    "this demands to be treated as interpretable sensible physics , and we do so .",
    "it is in a sense a `` safer '' system than the flat space schwarzschild black hole case since the physics does not run away to regimes outside the semi ",

    "we will discuss these cases below .",
    "finally , in the extended thermodynamics it was proposed in ref.@xcite that the mass for the taub  nut and taub  bolt spacetimes define the enthalpy of the system , and so we write : @xmath80 : @xmath81 and this results in an interesting expression for the conjugate to pressure , the thermodynamic volume@xcite : @xmath82 note that this thermodynamic volume is ( in general ) not to be associated directly with any geometric volume in the spacetime , as discussed in detail in ref.@xcite .",
    "it can also be negative , which was also given an interpretation in ref.@xcite : the environment did positive work in forming the spacetime , as opposed to having work done on it , as is more familiar with an enthalpy .",
    "the volume for taub ",
    "nut is @xmath26independent and so is also true in asymptotically locally flat space ( the limit of @xmath83 ) .",
    "interestingly , the result for the taub  bolt spacetime in asymptotically flat space ( using at large @xmath26 the small branch family : @xmath84 in the limit ) is equal in magnitude to that of taub  nut , with opposite sign : @xmath85 the nut and bolt spacetimes seem rather complementary in their roles . in this limit ,",
    "it is worth noting the other ( finite ) quantities as well@xcite : @xmath86",
    "r0.4        the phase structure of the taub  nut / taub  bolt system , as studied in ref.@xcite , was only the structure at a particular value of the cosmological constant , and hence at fixed pressure .",
    "the action difference between each spacetime was studied as a function of temperature . at a certain temperature , the taub ",
    "bolt spacetime had lower action , and so there was a first order transition where the difference @xmath87 in equation  ( [ eq : action_diff ] ) becomes negative .",
    "since there are two branches of bolts , the curve of @xmath87 as a function of @xmath23 ( which sets the inverse temperature ) is made of two parts that meet ( at @xmath57 ) to form a cusp shape .",
    "the transition is for the large bolts ( the @xmath54 branch ) .    in the extended thermodynamics where pressure is a variable",
    ", we can explore the phase transitions found in the earlier work further , seeing that they form a line of points in the ( @xmath88 ) plane .",
    "each value of the pressure @xmath89 gives a cusp curve where the cusp starts at @xmath57 and proceeds on two branches to lower @xmath23 . in the limit of infinite  @xmath26 ( zero pressure ) ,",
    "it is only the part of the cusp that corresponds to the small bolts ( the @xmath55 branch ) that has finite action , and for them @xmath90 .",
    "see figure  [ fig : action_difference ] and equation  ( [ eq : zero_pressure ] ) .",
    "( parenthetically , notice that the curves can all be superimposed by a scaling .",
    "this actually follows from equation  ( [ eq : action_diff ] ) for the action difference .",
    "if @xmath91 and @xmath92 , then @xmath93 .",
    "this all results from the fact that an accompanying scaling of the coordinates ( @xmath94 and @xmath95 ) rescales the overall metric of equation  ( [ eq : metric ] ) : @xmath96 . )",
    "the action difference  ( [ eq : action_diff ] ) changes sign at the positive zero of the quadratic in the numerator , which is at @xmath97 . putting this into the quadratic equation  ( [ eq : arbyquadratic ] ) satisfied by @xmath58 gives an equation for the value of @xmath23 at which the transition happens , which we denote as @xmath98 . after some algebra , @xmath99 and further algebra can be used to turn this into an expression for the transition temperature  @xmath30 , as a function of pressure : @xmath100    r0.43        so far this is an analogue of a solid  liquid coexistence curve form of the curve , and other phase boundaries in the @xmath0 plane that we will uncover , follows from the scaling properties discussed at the end of the previous paragraph , since @xmath101 and @xmath102 . ] in the phase diagram , although further study in this section will show that only one phase can exist near the line , due to a thermal instability .",
    "then section  6 will study a deformation that will allow for regimes where it is genuinely a coexistence line .",
    "the @xmath103 point on the curve is deceptive .",
    "in fact , strictly at zero pressure , there is no bolt phase at all , as the large bolts have gone to infinite size , and their action is infinite .",
    "but we see now in this larger context that this is a very special point that neighbours on a richer story .",
    "the transition temperature is lower for lower pressure , and so as soon as there is some non  zero cosmological constant ( pressure ) there will be a nearby transition to a bolt solution .",
    "this is analogous to the hawking  page black hole transition , where at finite cosmological constant there is a transition from pure ads to an ads ",
    "schwarzschild black hole , but that transition disappears at zero cosmological constant : flat space schwarzschild black holes ( the small branch survivors of the two branches available at finite @xmath7 ) have higher action than flat space at any temperature .",
    "in fact , the varying pressure coexistence curve can be computed in that case too ( see ref.@xcite for a recent review ) , with the same functional dependence , but with coefficient @xmath104 instead of the one displayed in equation  ( [ eq : transition - temp ] ) for our case .",
    "the diagram has two additional curves plotted on it as well .",
    "the shaded region between them has positive values for both the entropy and the specific heat at constant pressure , @xmath105 .",
    "we ll call this the `` positive wedge '' in the @xmath0 phase diagram , for the purposes of discussion . along a fixed pressure slice , for low enough temperatures ,",
    "the entropy is negative , while at high enough temperatures @xmath29 . between these two temperatures ,",
    "both are positive .",
    "the temperatures can be read off from equation  ( [ eq : entropy ] ) specialised to the taub ",
    "nut entropy ( by putting @xmath74 ) to give : @xmath106 from which the specific heat can be computed as depends strictly on the temperature only through @xmath24 and hence fixing the volume fixes @xmath6 .",
    "this is analogous to the vanishing of @xmath107 for static black holes , although their origins are quite different .",
    "there , the entropy and volume are not independent quantities , both depending upon a single parameter , the radius @xmath108 of the black hole . ]",
    "@xmath109    r0.45        from the above expressions we can compute the profile of the curves that border the positive wedge . at a given value of the pressure @xmath16 , we have for the lower temperature : @xmath110 and for the upper temperature : @xmath111 and so we have @xmath112 for the slice of the positive wedge located at pressure @xmath16 . after the transition temperature @xmath30 ,",
    "the entropy of the favoured bolt solutions is both positive and has @xmath113 .",
    "figure  [ fig : entropyplot ] shows the entropy as a function of @xmath5 for a fixed pressure slice , and the three temperatures @xmath114 .",
    "the negative entropy of taub  nut for the region @xmath115 and the negative specific heat for  @xmath5 in the region between @xmath28 and the transition at @xmath30 are identified as puzzles in refs.@xcite .",
    "there is a very natural narrative in the context here , _",
    "i.e. , _ extended thermodynamics . for a start , having a negative entropy for the spacetime can quite naturally arise as a result of some net heat outflow during the same formation process that accompanies the interpretation of the mass as enthalpy of formation , as discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "we wo nt have any more to say about that here , except to note that we can , if we choose to , avoid the negative entropy region altogether by appropriate paths in the @xmath0 plane .",
    "for example , one can start at @xmath103 and turn on finite temperature .",
    "the entropy is positive and given in equations  ( [ eq : zero_pressure ] ) .",
    "the same set of equations shows that the action of taub  nut is lower than taub  bolt and so is thermodynamically favoured .",
    "then one can directly enter the positive wedge by turning on small enough pressure  @xmath16 .",
    "we can move around inside the positive wedge and do standard equilibrium thermodynamics .",
    "notice that the special case when taub ",
    "nut is actually pure ads@xmath17 with an @xmath18 slicing , @xmath25 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath116 , lies outside this wedge .",
    "now we wish to consider how to traverse the region in figure  ( [ fig : transitiontempplot ] ) between the positive wedge in the taub  nut region and the transition at @xmath30 to taub  bolt .",
    "are there any obstructions to doing so ?",
    "the fact that @xmath21 goes negative at the edge of the wedge signals what presumably happens .",
    "the system develops an instability to fluctuations above the edge temperature @xmath117 , and it is dynamically predisposed to drive itself to higher temperature , where the specific heat becomes even more negative , improving the susceptibility to instability .",
    "this happens until the system arrives at @xmath30 and transitions to taub  bolt , where it is again stable .",
    "we can go further and track the changes in the system through this process in the extended thermodynamics .",
    "it is easy to do at fixed pressure , _",
    "i.e. , _ moving along a state curve of the form given in figure  [ fig : entropyplot ] .",
    "this isobaric process has a volume change , and so ( in the spirit of ref.@xcite ) we should take this seriously as a physical process during which work is done either on or by the system , with an accompanying heat flow .",
    "this changes the internal energy of the system , which was computed in ref.@xcite to be : @xmath118 all of this is of course accounted for using the first law of thermodynamics , naturally written in terms of the enthalpy @xmath119 as @xmath120 .",
    "our isobar gives us : @xmath121\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\frac{1}{g } ( n^*-n^o ) - { 8\\pi p}[(n^*)^3-(n^o)^3 ]   - p\\frac{8\\pi } { 3}[(n^*)^3-(n^o)^3]\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\delta u_n+p\\delta v_n\\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in summary then , it is natural to think of the pressure as a parameter that allows us to explore a larger phase space of parameters that deform the taub  nut / bolt system away from flat space ( the origin ) .",
    "a critical line develops separating taub  nut and taub  bolt phases , and two regions develop in the taub ",
    "nut area , one has @xmath122 and the other has @xmath29 , separated by the `` positive wedge '' .",
    "we can avoid the @xmath122 region by appropriate choice of path in the @xmath0 plane .",
    "fluctuations dynamically drive points in the @xmath29 region toward the transition line to become taub  bolt solutions .",
    "presumably this means that one can not quasi  statically follow a path from the taub  bolt region back toward taub ",
    "nut solutions region . ] .",
    "furthermore this means that the transition line is strictly not a phase coexistence line like those familiar in solid / liquid transitions .",
    "the @xmath29 region means that the nuts and bolts , despite having equal action ( gibbs free energy ) there , do not coexist indefinitely .",
    "bolt dominates after a long enough time .",
    "however , the relative locations of the positive wedge region and the transition line are adjustable using a natural deformation parameter .",
    "we explore that in the next two sections , finding that there are some values of the parameter where the transition line is more like a standard coexistence line .",
    "the taub  nut / bolt spacetime has many interesting properties .",
    "one of them is that while it possesses ordinary mass , it also has nut charge , which can in fact be interpreted as a magnetic counterpart to the ordinary `` electric '' mass . in this sense",
    "it is a dyon , for the mass sector , and this helps contribute to taub ",

    "one might wonder if that can happen here . indeed , there are two branches of new solutions that appear , but they do not add ( in the euclidean section ) any new physical structures : taking the small @xmath136 limit of equation  ( [ eq : arbyquartic ] ) gives the cubic @xmath137 . at @xmath138",
    "the two new branches are the repeated ( unphysical ) root @xmath139 , joining our familiar large @xmath26 solution @xmath140 . turning on @xmath32",
    "then shows that the two branches grow out as a pair of roots from the origin of the @xmath141 plane , one positive , the other negative .",
    "it can be seen that both have @xmath142 , and so are not physical .",
    "instead we have a system of physical solutions that is similar in structure to what we saw before ( see figure  [ fig : arbyplot_dyonic ] for an example ; _ c.f .",
    "_ figure  [ fig : arbyplot ] ) .",
    "there are two branches of bolts , a `` small '' and a `` large '' , and they join at a deformed value of a maximum  @xmath23 we can call @xmath143 , which is less than @xmath57 .",
    "correspondingly , we might expect that the transition from the dyonic taub ",
    "nut to the dyonic taub ",
    "bolt is at lower  @xmath23 , or higher temperature , and we will confirm this below .    since there are no new branches of solution for @xmath58 in the presence of charge , it seems that it qualitatively does not matter too much whether we use the fixed charge or fixed potential ensemble to study the phase structure although of course there are differences in the precise values of the parameters at transition .",
    "we can sketch out what happens , picking the fixed potential ensemble is easier than fixing @xmath129 when comparing the two solutions , because ( looking at equation  ( [ eq : charge ] ) ) @xmath129 depends upon @xmath58 , which is a complicated function of @xmath32 . ] .",
    "the action of the system was computed in ref.@xcite using an extension of the techniques outlined in refs.@xcite , with the result ( in the fixed potential ensemble ) : @xmath144r_+^2-(r_+^4 + 4n^2r_+^2-n^4)\\ell^2v^2}{(3r_+^2 - 3n^2+\\ell^2)r_+^2+(r_+^2-n^2)\\ell^2v^2}\\ .\\ ] ] the entropy was computed as : @xmath145r_+^2}{(3r_+^2 - 3n^2+\\ell^2)r_+^2+(r_+^2-n^2)\\ell^2v^2}+ \\frac{2\\pi}{g}\\frac{(r_+^4 + 4n^2r_+^2-n^4)\\ell^2v^2}{(3r_+^2 - 3n^2+\\ell^2)r_+^2+(r_+^2-n^2)\\ell^2v^2}\\ .",
    "\\label{eq : dyon - entropy}\\ ] ]    let us pause to see how this all looks in the case of the dyonic nut , where the expressions are much simpler .",
    "we can put @xmath74 to get : @xmath146 and @xmath147 interestingly , the mass is the same as in the neutral case .",
    "this means that the enthalpy is unchanged in the extended thermodynamics , which leads to another new result : a quick computation shows that the thermodynamic volume @xmath148 for the dyonic taub  nut stays the same as it was for the neutral case .",
    "put differently , the shift in the entropy is entirely accounted for by the new @xmath149 term in the smarr@xcite relation : @xmath150 just as in ref.@xcite for the neutral case , we can use the same smarr relation to deduce the thermodynamic volume for the dyonic bolt case . the resulting expression does depend ( explicitly and implicitly through @xmath58 s dependence on @xmath32 ) on the deformation parameter @xmath32 and it is long and not useful for us here , so we will not write it .",
    "from our taub  nut  dyon s entropy , we see that the specific heat at constant pressure is now : @xmath151    r0.39        so the deformation parameter @xmath32 has shifted the location of the place in the @xmath0 plane where the entropy is negative , and where the specific heat goes negative .",
    "our previously obtained temperatures for the borders of the positive wedge get rescaled by a factor @xmath152 .",
    "the temperature where the entropy starts going positive is lower , as well the temperature where the specific heat @xmath21 becomes negative .",
    "the dyonic charge evidently hastens the destabilisation of taub  nut . in the limit of infinite @xmath32",
    ", entropy becomes positive for all temperatures , but then @xmath29 everywhere .",
    "the phase structure for the dyonic system can now be explored , although analytic expressions do not seem to be possible for all regions .",
    "a numerical exploration reveals some pleasant results , however .",
    "for example , figure  [ fig : dyonic_action_difference ] shows a plot of the action difference between dyonic taub  bolt and dyonic taub  nut as a solid curve , against the neutral case for comparison ( a dashed curve ) .",
    "they have the same value of the pressure ( @xmath153 and we ve chosen units such that @xmath154 ) and @xmath155 for the dyon . as anticipated , the transition temperature has been raised",
    ".    a series of such examples can be generated numerically for varying pressure , extracting the transition temperature for each case .",
    "this allows for the generation of a new phase diagram for the dyonic deformation as a companion to the neutral one we generated in figure  [ fig : transitiontempplot ] .",
    "the result is shown in figure  [ fig : transitiontempplotdyona ] .",
    "there seems to be no simple analytic expression for the shape of the first order transition line for non ",
    "zero @xmath32 , although it fits the @xmath156 dependence rather well .",
    "the deformation widens the size of the unstable @xmath29 region .",
    "the fate of the phase diagram in the large @xmath32 limit is therefore interesting , since in that case the @xmath29 region increasingly envelops the phase diagram , at the expense of the negative entropy region , which shrinks away , along with the positive wedge , against the @xmath16axis .",
    "although its full meaning is unclear , it is worth noting that the case where we continue  @xmath32 to being purely imaginary is also interesting here corresponds to imaginary magnetic and electric fields for our dyons . ] . from equations  ( [ eq : deformed - entropy ] ) and  ( [ eq : deformed - specific ] ) , we see that the positive wedge is now pushed more toward the right , toward the transition line .",
    "a numerical exploration shows that the temperature at which there are available bolt solutions is decreased ( _ i.e. _ @xmath143 is now greater than @xmath57 ) . correspondingly , the first order phase transition line tilts more toward the left , and so approaches the positive wedge for increasing imaginary @xmath32 .",
    "the @xmath29 region for taub  nut gets squeezed .",
    "see figure  [ fig : transitiontempplotdyonb ] .",
    "ultimately there are yet new regimes that appear ( for increasingly large imaginary @xmath32 ) .",
    "one occurs when the @xmath29 region no longer has lowest action . in other words , the transition line to taub ",
    "bolt is inside the positive wedge : @xmath157 . in this case",
    "the transition line is genuinely a coexistence line analogous to that found in solid / liquid systems .",
    "another regime is when ( at @xmath158 ) the @xmath29 taub  nut region vanishes entirely .",
    "the whole positive wedge disappears , leaving a phase diagram where there is only taub  nut with negative entropy before the transition line to taub  bolt .",
    "interestingly , yet another new phase can appear at even higher imaginary @xmath32 , as illustrated by the samples in figures  [ fig : complex - dyon - snapshotsa ] and  [ fig : complex - dyon - snapshotsb ] .    the large taub  bolt solutions themselves begin to develop regions of negative entropy ( as is evident from the form of equation  ( [ eq : dyon - entropy ] ) ) .",
    "the sample plots of the action difference show that for large enough  @xmath159 the large taub ",
    "bolt solutions become thermodynamically favoured as soon as they become available , as their action relative to the taub ",
    "nut solutions are negative for all @xmath160 .",
    "so these negative entropy taub ",
    "bolts appear on the phase diagram for a window of temperatures , until at higher temperatures the positive entropy taub ",
    "bolt solutions take over again .",
    "perhaps there is even more interesting and instructive physics to explore further in this regime .",
