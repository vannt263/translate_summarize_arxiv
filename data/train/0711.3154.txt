    "the quark condensate @xmath10 is an order parameter of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in qcd . with increasing temperature the quark condensate decreases ( or  melts  ) . for low temperatures",
    "this effect can be systematically calculated in chiral perturbation theory . at three - loop order @xcite",
    "the estimate @xmath11mev for the critical temperature , where chiral symmetry will eventually be restored , has been found .",
    "this extrapolated value of @xmath12 is remarkably consistent with @xmath13mev @xcite obtained in numerical simulations of full qcd on the lattice , although this result is still under debate .",
    "it has subsequently been criticized @xcite with respect to the reliability of the continuum extrapolation performed in ref.@xcite .",
    "in fact the qcd chiral",
    " phase transition  is merely a non - singular cross - over , with the transition temperature ( deduced from the peak of the chiral susceptibility ) lying in the broad range @xmath14mev according to ref.@xcite .",
    "the chiral condensate @xmath15 drops also with increasing baryon density . presently , it is not feasible to study this phenomenon rigorously in lattice simulations of qcd due to the problems arising from the complex - valued euclidian fermion determinant at non - zero baryon chemical potential . as an alternative ,",
    "the density dependence of the quark condensate @xmath16 can be extracted by exploiting the feynman - hellmann theorem applied to the chiral symmetry breaking quark mass term @xmath17 in the qcd hamiltonian .",
    "the leading linear term in the nucleon density @xmath18 is then readily derived by differentiating the energy density of a nucleonic fermi gas , @xmath19 , with respect to the light quark mass @xmath20 .",
    "this introduces the nucleon sigma - term @xmath21mev @xcite as the driving term for the density evolution of the chiral condensate . following this simple linear density approximation",
    "one would naively estimate that chiral symmetry gets restored at @xmath22 , with @xmath23@xmath24 the nuclear matter saturation density .",
    "corrections beyond the linear density approximation arise from the nucleon - nucleon interactions which transform the nucleonic fermi gas into a nuclear fermi liquid .",
    "these corrections have been studied in one - boson exchange models of the nn - interaction combined with the relativistic dirac - brueckner approach to nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "knowledge of the quark mass derivatives of the various meson masses and coupling constants is required in order to quantify the interaction effects on the in - medium condensate . for the vector and scalar bosons",
    "it has been assumed that their sigma - terms scale linearly with that of the nucleon , i.e. @xmath25 . in the further development",
    "it has been demonstrated in ref.@xcite that the higher order corrections ( in density ) depend sensitively on the interpretation of the isoscalar scalar ",
    "@xmath26-boson ( which is responsible for the central nn - attraction in one - boson exchange models ) and its substructure . within modest variations of an unknown parameter @xmath27",
    "both an accelerated and a hindered tendency towards chiral restoration are possible .",
    "the way out of this dilemma is to replace the fictitious",
    " @xmath28-boson exchange by realistic two - pion exchange processes .",
    "because of the goldstone boson nature of the pion with its characteristic mass relation , @xmath29 , the pion - exchange dynamics in nuclear matter plays a particularly important role for the in - medium quark condensate . a first step in this direction",
    "was made in ref.@xcite where realistic saturation of nuclear matter could be obtained from the iteration of @xmath2-exchange plus a short - range nn - contact interaction to second order .",
    "it was found that the pionic interaction effects ( with well - known quark mass derivative ) counteract the reduction of the condensate from the leading linear term in density .",
    "actually , if one restricts oneself to the density region @xmath30@xmath24 , then all existing calculations agree that the deviations from the linear density approximation are relatively small and practically get masked by the uncertainty of the empirical nucleon sigma - term , @xmath31mev .",
    "the chiral approach to nuclear matter has been extended and improved in refs.@xcite by systematically including effects from irreducible @xmath3-exchange together with excitations of virtual @xmath32-isobars .",
    "the physical motivation for such an extension is threefold .",
    "first , the spin - isospin-@xmath33 @xmath4-resonance is the most prominent feature of low - energy @xmath34-scattering .",
    "secondly , it is well known that the @xmath35-exchange between nucleons with excitations of virtual @xmath36-isobars generates the medium- and long - range components of the isoscalar central nn - attraction @xcite , which is simulated by the scalar ",
    "@xmath26-boson in the one - boson exchange models .",
    "thirdly , the delta - nucleon mass - splitting @xmath37mev is of the same size as the fermi momentum @xmath38 at nuclear matter saturation density .",
    "therefore pions and @xmath36-isobars should both be treated as explicit degrees of freedom in the nuclear many - body problem .",
    "it has been found in ref.@xcite that the inclusion of the chiral @xmath39 dynamics significantly improves e.g. the momentum - dependence of the ( real ) single - particle potential @xmath40 and the isospin properties ( as revealed by the density - dependent asymmetry energy @xmath41 and the neutron matter equation of state ) .",
    "moreover , it guarantees spin - stability of nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to investigate the in - medium chiral condensate ( beyond the linear density approximation ) in this extended and improved framework for nuclear matter where interaction effects are ( almost ) exclusively given by one- and two - pion exchange according to the rules of chiral symmetry . since the pion mass @xmath1 appears as an explicit variable in our calculation we can also study how the  dropping  in - medium condensate evolves from the chiral limit , @xmath42 , to the real world with its fixed amount of explicit chiral symmetry breaking , @xmath7mev .",
    "we find that the in - medium condensate behaves very differently in both cases , with drastic consequences for nuclear physics in the chiral limit .",
    "our starting point is the feynman - hellmann theorem which relates the in - medium quark condensate @xmath43 to the quark mass derivative of the energy density of isospin - symmetric spin - saturated nuclear matter . using the gell - mann - oakes - renner relation @xmath44 one finds for the ratio of the in - medium to the vacuum quark condensate : @xmath45 with the fermi momentum @xmath46 related to the nucleon density @xmath47 in the usual way .",
    "the term proportional to @xmath48 comes from the noninteracting fermi gas including kinetic energy contributions expanded up to order @xmath49 .",
    "interaction contributions beyond the linear density approximation are collected in the function : @xmath50 defined as the derivative of the interaction energy per particle @xmath51 with respect to @xmath52 .",
    "we mention here that @xmath53 denotes the pion decay constant in the chiral limit and @xmath52 stands for the leading linear term in the quark mass expansion of the squared pion mass . with this convention",
    "the gell - mann - oakes - renner relation , @xmath54 , becomes exact and @xmath55 is the vacuum condensate in the chiral limit .",
    "in this section we present analytical expressions for the contributions to the derivative function @xmath56 as given by various one- and two - pion exchange diagrams . taking",
    "the @xmath52-derivative is a straightforward procedure since we can borrow here heavily from the explicit expressions for the diagrammatic contributions to @xmath51 written down in our previous works @xcite .",

    "the individual entries are about a factor 4 smaller : @xmath192 , suggesting an approximate @xmath193-dependence of the total interaction contribution .",
    "fig.6 shows separately the effects of the five classes of interaction contributions .",
    "they are consecutively added up in the sequence : @xmath194 . the last two major steps ( in opposite directions ) should not be misinterpreted as a sign of bad convergence since the corresponding terms belong to the same order in the small momentum expansion of the nuclear matter energy density ( @xmath195 ) .",
    "fig.6 actually demonstrates the prominent importance of the @xmath3-exchange interaction beyond leading order for the in - medium quark condensate .",
    "it is important to include all effects generated by the pion - loops .",
    "for example , if one would drop the last constant term proportional to @xmath196 in eq.(15 ) an amount of @xmath197 would be missing in the total balance ( at @xmath9 ) . as a consequence of that omission",
    "the condensate ratio would lie appreciably below the linear density approximation .",
    "this particular non - analytical @xmath198-term gives also an explanation for the drastically different behavior of the in - medium condensate in the chiral limit and for the physical pion mass .",
    "its contribution to the condensate ratio , @xmath199 , vanishes in the chiral limit , @xmath42 , but reaches @xmath200 for the physical pion mass @xmath7mev at @xmath201@xmath202 .",
    "this selective consideration does , of course , not mean that the other one- and two - pion exchange contributions would not also depend strongly on the pion mass .",
    "their dependences can be studied easily case by case with the help of the analytical formulas presented in section 2 . in general",
    ", one can say that the condensate ratio @xmath203 is affected significantly by interaction terms which otherwise play only a marginal role for the nuclear matter equation of state @xmath51 ( as e.g. the chiral @xmath100-contact term proportional to @xmath101 ) .",
    "this pronounced shifting of weights comes from taking the derivative with respect to the squared pion mass @xmath52 . on the other hand , the fermi gas approximation ( i.e. the linear density approximation ) works reasonably well for the in - medium chiral condensate almost up to nuclear matter saturation density @xmath164@xmath24 , even though it is far from correctly describing nuclear matter as a self - bound fermi liquid .",
    "let us compare our results for the in - medium chiral condensate with other works which have treated to some limited extent the pion - exchange dynamics in nuclear matter .",
    "in the work of lutz et al.@xcite @xmath2-exchange plus an adjustable nn - contact interaction have been iterated to second order . in the region @xmath204 they find a weaker ( positive ) deviation from the linear density approximation , with no trend for stabilization of the in - medium condensate .",
    "this difference comes from not including the irreducible @xmath3-exchange , the chiral @xmath89-dynamics and the @xmath101-contact vertex .",
    "recently , the tbingen group @xcite has employed the chiral nucleon - nucleon potential at next - to - leading order to calculate nuclear matter within the relativistic dirac - brueckner - hartree - fock approach .",
    "they also derive the in - medium chiral condensate by exploiting the feynman - hellmann theorem eq.(1 ) .",
    "irrespective of using the hartree - fock or brueckner - hartree - fock approximation , their effects from pion - exchange interactions ( e.g. @xmath205 at @xmath166 @xcite ) are much smaller than in our calculation . moreover , there is no trend of stabilization in the whole density region @xmath206 considered .",
    "again , these substantial differences arise in ref.@xcite from taking only the next - to - leading order chiral nn - potential ( i.e. @xmath2-exchange and irreducible @xmath3-exchange ) , but neglecting the actually more important effects from @xmath3-exchange with virtual @xmath36-isobar excitation .",
    "we note that our perturbative calculation , when truncated to @xmath2-exchange , iterated @xmath2-exchange and irreducible @xmath3-exchange exchange , would lead to an in - medium condensate below the linear density approximation ( see fig.6 ) .",
    "qualitative differences may also come from the approximations ( angle - averaged pauli - blocking operator , etc . )",
    "used in the brueckner - hartree - fock calculation of ref.@xcite and not treating the iterated @xmath2-exchange in full detail ( as done in the present work ) . apart from all these differences",
    ", ref.@xcite agrees with our conclusion that the short - range nn - dynamics plays only a minor role for the in - medium chiral condensate .",
    "it is indicated to repeat the calculation of ref.@xcite with the more complete next - to - next - to - leading order chiral nn - potential including the non - analytical polynomial pieces .",
    "our results for the in - medium chiral condensate can be alternatively summarized by the density dependent effective nucleon sigma - term : @xmath207 it captures the correlation effects in the nuclear medium which reduce the tendency towards chiral symmetry restoration .",
    "fig.7 shows the effective nucleon sigma - term as a function of the density for @xmath208@xmath24 . in this figure",
    "we display also the uncertainties associated with the still existing error band of @xmath209mev in the empirical determination of @xmath102 .",
    "moreover , we have varied the regularization scale @xmath61 between @xmath168gev and @xmath169gev which leads to some widening of the error band as the density increases .",
    "in this work we have used in - medium chiral perturbation theory to calculate the quark condensate @xmath167 beyond the linear density approximation .",
    "the pertinent correction term follows from differentiating the interaction contributions to the energy per particle of isospin - symmetric nuclear matter with respect to the pion mass .",
    "analytical expressions for the contributions to @xmath210 from @xmath211-exchange ( with @xmath1-dependent vertex corrections ) , iterated @xmath211-exchange and irreducible @xmath3-exchange with inclusion of @xmath36-isobar excitations and pauli - blocking corrections have been presented in section 2 .",
    "we find a strong , nonlinear dependence of the  dropping  in - medium condensate on the value of the pion ( or light quark ) mass . in the chiral limit , @xmath5 ,",
    "chiral restoration seems to be reached already at about @xmath6 times normal nuclear matter density .",
    "by contrast , for the physical pion mass @xmath7mev , the in - medium condensate stabilizes at about @xmath8 of its vacuum value above that same density . including systematically the effects from @xmath3-exchange with @xmath4-isobar excitation ( or the equivalent chiral @xmath100 contact interactions @xmath212 ) is crucial in order to obtain such a pronounced behavior .",
    "non - analytical ( contact ) terms in the quark mass ( such as @xmath213 ) , which are often dropped in the presentation of the chiral nn - potential , have a very strong influence on the in - medium chiral condensate .",
    "below @xmath214@xmath24 the correction beyond the linear density approximation remain relatively small .",
    "this finding can be taken as an a posteriori justification of the assumptions made in ref.@xcite about the in - medium scalar mean - field .    as a consequence of the hindered tendency towards chiral symmetry restoration ( in the real world with @xmath173mev )",
    ", pions and nucleons can be used as effective low - energy degrees of freedom at least up to twice nuclear matter density .",
    "the major source of uncertainty for the density dependence of @xmath167 is caused by the error band in the empirical determination of the nucleon sigma - term @xmath215mev .",
    "one can hope that upcoming dispersion relation analyses of @xmath34-scattering data and lattice qcd calculations will lead to a more accurate value of @xmath102 .",
    "of course , there remain also questions about the size of effects from yet higher order interaction contributions related to @xmath216-exchange , two - loop @xmath3-exchange etc . on the other hand ,",
    "an estimate based on recent lattice qcd results indicates that the short - distance nn - dynamics has only a very small effect on the density dependence of the quark condensate @xmath217 .",
    "we thank t. hatsuda and n. ishii for providing us with the nucleon - nucleon potential from lattice qcd and for stimulating discussions .",
