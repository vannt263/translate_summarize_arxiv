    "a significant fraction of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) produce powerful relativistic jets , which are prominent sources of non - thermal radiation . in blazars , where one of the jets is closely aligned with our line of sight , this non - thermal radiation component is relativistically boosted to the point that it easily outshines the entire host galaxy .",
    "spectral energy distributions of many blazars peak in the gamma - ray band , making data from the fermi large area telescope ( fermi / lat ) essential for studying the jet physics .",
    "the gamma - ray emission of blazars is well known for its strong and incessant variability , indicating the complex structure of the underlying dissipation and particle acceleration sites .",
    "it proved to be very difficult to provide a satisfactory statistical description of these variations that would be useful for constraining such basic parameters as , e.g. , the location and size of the dissipation sites along the jet . before the launch of fermi , thorough blazar variability studies were impaired mainly due to the lack of @xmath0-ray blazar monitoring data , and robust statistical methods to model the variable blazar emission .",
    "the fermi / lat instrument has been performing continuous observations of the @xmath0-ray sky since 2008 , which provided good quality light curves of a sample of bright blazars , and boosted the blazar @xmath0-ray variability studies .",
    "recently , it has been demonstrated that the @xmath0-ray power spectral densities ( psd ) of blazars appear to be in the form of a power - law function ( e.g. abdo et al .",
    "2010 ; nakagawa & mori 2013 , hereafter nm13 ) , indicating a stochastic nature of the high energy blazar variability . on the other hand ,",
    "the highest flux states of blazars are commonly described as flares , defined using the concept of the flux doubling and halving time scales ( e.g. nalewajko 2013 , saito et al .",
    "such an approach suggests that flares have an origin that is distinct from that of the bulk of the @xmath0-ray blazar variability .",
    "an important characteristic of a variability process is a frequency or a time scale at which the properties of its psd ( e.g. the slope ) change .",
    "this time scale may be related to , e.g. , the size of the emitting region , and used to constrain the process triggering the variability .",
    "however , the featureless power - law like fermi / lat blazar psd have been so far preventing this kind of inference , with 3c 454.3 being the only blazar with a @xmath0-ray psd break reported in the literature .",

    "ackermann et al .",
    "( 2010 ) cautioned that their psd break may not indicate a characteristic time scale but a frequency at which two psd components become equally strong .",
    "nm13 interpreted their characteristic time scale in terms of the internal shock model for the @xmath0-ray blazar emission , in which blob ejecta collide in the internal shock of the blazar jet ( kataoka et al .",

    "[ fig : dt ] we plot the relative time of each light curve as a function of the time bin index . in this representation",
    "a uniformly binned light curve would be given by a linear relation .",
    "it can be seen that the time bin distribution in some light curves ( pks 1510 - 089 , b2 1520 + 31 and mrk 421 ) reseambles closely a uniform distribution . on the other hand , light curves of pks 0454 - 234 ,",

    "we model the fermi / lat light curves of the sources in our sample as a single ornstein - uhlenbeck ( ou ) process ( kelly et al . 2009 ) , or a linear superposition of the ou processes ( hereafter sup - ou , kelly et al .",

    "we summarize briefly the main properties of these processes , and we refer the reader to kelly et al .",
    "( 2009 , 2011 ) for the full details of the models construction and fitting procedures .    the ou process , @xmath16 , is defined by the following stochastic differential equation : @xmath17 the parameters of the process are the characteristic frequency , @xmath18 ; the mean value of the process , @xmath19 ; and the amplitude of the driving noise process , @xmath20 , being the rate at which variability power is injected into the stochastic process @xmath16 .",
    "the term @xmath21 denotes a wiener process ( i.e. , a brownian motion ) , and its derivative is white noise .",

    "hence , @xmath18 may be associated with a characteristic time scale @xmath25 related with a change in the properties in the psd of the ou process .",

    "2011 ) .",

    ", @xmath31 is a set of the ou processes , allows to model light curves with more complex psd , e.g. those that are flat below a low - frequency break , @xmath32 , decay as @xmath33 with @xmath342 above the low - frequency break , and then steepen to @xmath23 above a high - frequency break , @xmath35 , as observed e.g. in the x - ray psd of nearby agn and black hole x - ray binaries ( e.g. kelly et al .",
    "2011 , axelsson et al .",
    "we define the short and long term characteristic time scales related to the two characteristic frequencies as @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the characteristic time scales that we sample for are between @xmath38 and @xmath39 chosen to be 100 ( 10 ) times the length of the time series , and one - hundredth ( one - tenth ) the smallest time spacing in the time series in the ou ( sup - ou ) model . throughout the paper it holds that a fourier frequency @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is a specific time scale .",
    "thus , our study covers a wide range of characteristic time scales corresponding to the @xmath4210@xmath43hz and @xmath4410@xmath45hz range in fourier frequency in the ou and sup - ou models , respectively .",
    "uttley et al .",

    "the observational evidence supporting this conclusion include the linear rms - flux relation observed on all time scales in the x - ray variations of gbhs and agns ( uttley & mchardy 2001 ) , and the log - normal distribution of fluxes for cygnus x-1 ( uttley et al . 2005 ) .",
    "thus , we model the natural logarithm of the fermi / lat fluxes in order to investigate whether the @xmath0-ray light curves of agn share the properties of the optical and x - ray agn light curves .",
    "the error bars derived in this work are representative of the 90% confidence regions , while the upper and lower limits represent the 99% confidence regions . while reporting the results , we use logarithms to base 10 and calculate time scales in the observer s frame , unless otherwise stated .",
    "first , we modeled the fermi / lat light curves of the blazars in our sample with the ou process .",
    "we plot the light curves , the model realizations corresponding to the highest posterior likelihood , the standardized model residuals and their histograms compared to the expected standard normal distribution in figures  [ fig : fits - ou][fig : fits - supou4 ] ( left ) .",
    "the sample posterior distribution functions of the characteristic time scale , @xmath3 are presented in figure  [ fig : omega0 ] . in table",
    "[ tab : sample ] we list the median characteristic time scales and their uncertainties for all sources .",
    "the ou modeling gives the characteristic time scales in the @xmath4943day range ( table  [ tab : sample ] ) . in the case of 3c 454.3 the characteristic time scale",
    "is not constrained , and we derive the lower limit on its value , @xmath50 > 2.0 $ ] .",
    "it is apparent that in general the ou process does not fit well the studied light curves . in particular , the model experiences systematic difficulties to fit the data during the quiet time periods when the assumed condition that @xmath14 forces the adaptive time bins @xmath51 to be larger than a few days ( see e.g. figures  [ fig : fits - supou1][fig : fits - supou3 ] , left ) . to evaluate the quality of the fits , we compare the distributions of the standardized fit residuals with the standard normal distribution .",
    "in addition for each source we calculate the auto - correlation function of the standardized residuals ( figure  [ fig : acf ] ) .",
    "it can be observed that while the distribution of the residuals approximate the standard normal distribution reasonably well , the auto - correlation functions deviate in several sources ( e.g. b2 1633 + 38 ) from that expected for the white noise process .",
    "thus , we proceed to testing the sup - ou model on the fermi / lat light curves of blazars .      in the next step we considered the superposition of the ou processes ( sup - ou ) and applied it to the fermi / lat blazar light curves . we observed a significant improvement to the quality of the fits in the low - flux periods , compared to the case of the ou modeling .",
    "the distributions of the standardized residuals assuming the sup - ou process can be compared with the ou model fit residuals and the standard normal distribution ( figures  [ fig : fits - supou1][fig : fits - supou4 ] , right ) .",
    "the auto - correlation functions of the standardized residuals assuming the sup - ou process indicate that , indeed , in majority of sources the sup - ou residuals approximate the white noise process better than the ou process residuals ( figure  [ fig : acf ] ) .    to evaluate formally what model is more successful in describing the fermi / lat blazar light curves , we computed the deviance information criterion ( dic , spiegelhalter et al .",
    "dic is used in bayesian model selection problems where the posterior distributions of the models have been obtained by markov chain monte carlo simulations . models with smaller dic are preferred to models with larger dic .",
    "it is accepted that @xmath52 is a difference substantial enough to prefer the model with smaller dic .",
    "we use the following definition of the dic .",
    "@xmath53 where @xmath54 $ ] describes the effective number of model parameters and hence the model complexity ; while @xmath55 is the deviance defined as @xmath56 $ ] , where @xmath57 is the model likelihood function , @xmath58 are the data , and @xmath59 denotes the parameters in the model .",
    "the second term in equation  [ eq : dic ] , @xmath60 , is the expected value of the deviance .",
    "the comparison of dic computed for the two models ( table  [ tab : sample ] ) indicates that the sup - ou model is preferred over the ou model in all sources except 3c 454.3 , 3c 66a , and pks 2155 - 304 in which @xmath61 .",
    "thus , for these three sources we accept the results of the ou modeling , while for the remaining sources we assume the results of the sup - ou modeling .    for each source",
    ", we plot the posterior probability distributions of the short and long characteristic time scales resulting from the sup - ou model in figure  [ fig : o1o2 ] .",
    "we notice that in many cases the posterior probability distributions of the characteristic time scales deviate from a gaussian distribution .",
    "it can be inferred that while formally we can derive the median long and short characteristic time scales and their 90% confidence intervals in all sources , they may depend on our choice of @xmath39 and @xmath38.the least deviated shapes are those representing the long characteristic time scale in pks 1510 - 089 ; and the short characteristic time scales in 3c 454.3 , and ( to a lesser degree ) in 3c 66a , pks 0716 + 714 , and bl lac .",
    "thus , we provide the median @xmath62 and/or @xmath63 and their uncertainties for these five cases , and the relevant limits for all sources ( table  [ tab : sample ] ) . the upper limits on @xmath63 can be compared with the smallest time spacing in the respective light curves , @xmath51 ( see table  [ tab : sample ] ) , and the shortest sampled time scale , @xmath64 .",

    "the distributions peak close to @xmath65 for the majority of the sources .",
    "the individual values and their uncertainties are listed in table  [ tab : sample ] . the slopes do not depend on the blazar class ( bl lac vs. fsrq ) or redshift ( figure  [ fig : results ] , right ; left ) . with the sup - ou model , we constrain the psd slopes in all sources , except 3c 454.3 for which we find @xmath66 .",
    "we analyzed the variability properties of 13 bright blazars with the most complete first 4-year fermi / lat light curves available from the satellite archive .",
    "we used the stochastic models for luminosity fluctuations developed in kelly et al .",
    "( 2009 , 2011 ) .",
    "the models rely on computing the likelihood function and performing bayesian inference to access the probability distributions of the variability parameters such as , e.g. , the characteristic time scales , given the data .",
    "the models implement the ou ( ornstein - uhlenbeck ) process leading to a bending psd , and the superposition of the ou processes leading to a doubly bent psd .",
    "these shapes of psd are typically observed in radio - quiet agn in the optical and x - ray bands , and in x - rays in the black hole binaries across different spectral states .",
    "our approach provides an alternative to the methods relying on the psd extraction known to suffer from a number of observational biases due to irregular sampling , read noise leak , and aliasing .",
    "moreover , our approach allows for non - uniform binning of the light curves .",
    "hence , in this work we binned the light curves adaptively in order to avoid compromising the time resolution in high flux periods for the sake of uniform binning over the entire observing period .",
    "in addition , in our modeling we sampled a wide range of temporal frequencies , up to 8 orders of magnitude starting at @xmath67@xmath68hz .",
    "thus , we improved significantly over the earlier fermi / lat blazar variability studies ( e.g. , @xmath690.2hz , abdo et al .",
    "2010 ; @xmath70@xmath71hz , nm13 ) .",
    "the main result of our study is the consistency of the 4-year fermi / lat blazar activity with stochastic processes .",
    "the mixed ou process was prefered in 10 blazars from our sample , while in the 3 remaining blazars ( two bl lacs , 3c 66a and pks 2155 - 304 ; and one fsrq 3c 454.3 ) the single ou process and the mixed ou process resulted in fits of equally good quality .",
    "the posterior probability distributions of the characteristic time scales from the ou process allowed us to constrain the fermi / lat characteristic time scales in two bl lac sources ( @xmath50 = 1.39^{+0.43}_{-0.29}$ ] in 3c 66a , and @xmath50 = 1.63^{+2.79}_{-0.35}$ ] in pks 2155 - 304 ) .",
    "this is the first time that the characteristic time scales have been observed in the fermi / lat light curves of blazars other than 3c 454.3 . in 3c 454.3",
    "the ou modeling resulted only in a lower limit , @xmath50 > 2.0 $ ] , which was inconsistent with the nm13 result .",
    "nm13 found that the psd of 3c 454.3 can be characterized with @xmath72 and @xmath73 below and above the psd break , respectively .",
    "the high frequency slope significantly steeper than @xmath262 assumed in our modeling might have led to poor constraints on the characteristic time scales in this source .",
    "characteristic time scales found through the ou modeling in 3c 66a and pks 2155 - 304 fall outside of the frequency range studied by nm13 .",
    "we conclude that perhaps the method of the psd construction used by nm13 was not sensitive enough to detect these bl lac characteristic time scales in the fermi / lat light curves .    with regard to the sup - ou modeling , we reported the relevant limits on the characteristic time scales . in five cases with the posterior probability distributions",

    "however , blazar @xmath0-ray emission is dominated by the processes related to the jet physics and beamed due to relativistic effects , unlike the x - ray coronal emission of the radio - quiet agn and black hole binaries . nevertheless , it could be envisaged that the accretion disk variability structure is carried outwards in the jet , leading to the jet variability with properties inherited from the innermost radii of the accretion disk / x - ray corona system ( e.g. lohfink et al . 2013 ) .",
    "it would be then expected that the x - ray and fermi / lat short characteristic time scales of blazars were consistent with those found in x - rays in radio - quiet and radio - loud agn .",
    "thus , it is interesting to compare the blazar and non - blazar variability properties across different energy bands in order to search for evidence in favor or against a common variability mechanism ( figure  [ fig : results ] , middle ; note differing frequency bands sampled by the respective studies ) .",
    "blazar psd have been studied in only several sources in energy bands other than the @xmath0-rays .",
    "soft x - ray blazar psd ( here below 20kev ) were computed for three bl lac sources ( mkn 421 and pks 2155 - 304 also included in our fermi / lat sample , and mkn 501 ) by kataoka et al .",

    "( 2008 ; 3c 279 ) .",
    "characteristic time scales corresponding to the high - frequency psd break were detected in all of these sources with the exception of 3c 279 .",
    "the sampled frequency bands and detected psd breaks are indicated in figure  [ fig : results ] ( middle ) . in general",
    ", these studies demonstrated that in soft x - rays blazars show high - frequency breaks and psd shapes below these breaks that are largely consistent with those of seyfert galaxies and radio - loud agn ( e.g. 3c 120 , marshall et al .",
    "2009 ; 3c 390.3 , gliozzi et al .",
    "2009 ) , despite a possible contribution from a jet emission in the latter class .",
    "however , at the frequencies above the high - frequency break the soft x - ray psd of bl lacs seem to drop more rapidly than it is observed in seyfert galaxies . hard x - ray ( 14150kev ; swift / bat ) psd have been recently constructed by shimizu & mushotzky ( 2013 ) for a sample of 30 agn , which included two fsrqs ( 3c 273 and 3c 454.3 ) and one bl lac ( mkn 421 ) .",
    "this study covered longer time scales than the soft x - ray study of kataoka et al .",
    "a characteristic time scale was detected only in 3c 273 preventing a detailed cross - band comparison .",
    "the psd of all other agn in their sample were described with unbroken power - law functions with a typical slopes , @xmath6 , when constrained .",
    "the @xmath0-ray blazar psd slopes derived in our study are in general consistent with those observed in x - rays in non - blazar agn .",
    "however , we were able to derive only the upper limits on the blazar short characteristic time scales .",
    "given that they are consistent with the low end of @xmath63 detected in the radio - quiet agn ( figure  [ fig : results ] ) , we can not discard the possibility that the @xmath0-ray @xmath63 in blazars and the x - ray @xmath63 in non - blazar agn are comparable .    however , the ou @xmath0-ray characteristic time scales detected in pks 2155 - 304 and 3c 66a are much longer than those of the bl lac sources ( and also fsrqs ) in the soft x - rays .",
    "in addition , closer inspection of few available blazar psd across different energy bands suggests that they are rather different . in particular , in pks 2155 - 304",
    "the value on @xmath63 derived in our work is in disagreement with the x - ray @xmath63 found in kataoka et al .",
    "the psd slope derived here for 3c 279 , @xmath81 , is in disagreement with that reported in the soft x - rays by chatterjee et al .",
    "( 2008 , @xmath82 ) .",
    "we do not detect a @xmath0-ray characteristic time scale in 3c 273 , while the soft and hard x - ray detections were reported at the values well within our range of sampled time scales ( mchardy 2008 , shimitzu & mushotzky 2013 ) .",
    "these discrepancies imply that either the blazar variability process is energy dependent , or the origins of the x - ray and @xmath0-ray blazar variability are different .    the processes intrinsic to the jet physics such as the internal shock model ( e.g. ghisellini 1999 ) or the minijets - in - a - jet model ( e.g. begelman et al . 2008 , giannios et al .",
    "2009 , narayan & piran 2012 ) may well dominate the blazar variability structure leading to the @xmath0-ray variability properties that are largely different from those implied by the accretion disk physics and propagation models .",
    "alternatively , the @xmath0-ray variability pattern may be a combination of the baseline stochastic disk / corona variability carried out in a jet , and variability intrinsic to the jet .",
    "if the propagation model of variability envisaging coupling of perturbations at different radii continues toward the jet , and the disk x - ray perturbations couple with the x/@xmath0-ray perturbations intrinsic to the jet , then the resulting fermi / lat variability structure may differ from that known from the x - ray band .",
    "additional complication may be introduced by altering the variability time scales due to relativistic effects .",
    "we have applied the stochastic models of luminosity fluctuations developed in kelly et al .",
    "( 2009 , 2011 ) to the fermi / lat light curves of 13 well observed blazars in order to study their time variability properties .",
    "the light curves of 3 blazars were consistent with the ou process which is characterized with a psd @xmath83 featuring a bend at a characteristic times scale , @xmath3 , where the slope , @xmath2 , changes from 0 ( @xmath4 ) to 2 ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "we constrained @xmath3 in two bl lac type blazars , 3c 66a ( @xmath84day , or @xmath85day in the rest frame ) and pks 2155 - 304 ( @xmath86day , or @xmath87day in the rest frame ) .",
    "thus , the inferred @xmath0-ray bl lac characteristic time scales were longer than those observed in the soft x - ray blazar and seyfert light curves .",
    "in addition , the low- and high - frequency psd slopes in the bl lacs fitted well with the ou process were flatter than their counterparts in the soft x - rays .",
    "these discrepancies indicate either the energy dependence of the psd or different origins of the bl lac x - ray and @xmath0-ray variability .    in 10 of 13 sources a better agreement with the data was obtained with the mixed ou process characterized with a psd featuring two bends and an intermediate part of psd where @xmath6 . for these sources we derived respective limits on the long and short characteristic time scales . we concluded that their underlying psd has likely the form of a power - law function over the sampled range of temporal frequencies .",
    "the upper limit on the short characteristic time scale indicates sub - hour variability in 4 fsrq sources .",
    "this finding needs to be addressed by present and future theoretical models of blazar @xmath0-ray variability .",
    "we constrained the psd slopes , @xmath2 , for all sources except 3c 454.3 .",
    "our stochastic approach is particularly well suited for the variability studies of various classes of agn because it accounts self - consistently for irregular sampling , measurement errors , red noise leak , and aliasing .",
    "thus , it provides an alternative to the variability methods based on the psd construction .",
