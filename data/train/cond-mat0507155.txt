    "fig : vx ] ) . in spite of large scatter in the data",
    ", @xmath27 increases with decreasing @xmath26 .",
    "the data scattering is due mainly to the sample dependence of the distribution and morphology in the insulating regions .    to confirm whether this anomalous phenomenon is characteristic of @xmath0-h8et - br ,",
    "similar measurements were performed for four samples of @xmath0-(h8et)@xmath1cu(ncs)@xmath1.@xcite the magnetic susceptibilities are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : chit](d)[fig : chit](f ) .",
    "although @xmath28 in the _ q _ state is slightly lower by about 0.20.3 k than in the @xmath29 state , an almost perfect meissner effect is obtained for both the cooling states , independent of sample size .",
    "we therefore conclude that the effect of crystalline size on sc suppression is a peculiar feature in quenched @xmath0-h8et - br . as directly indicated below , the non - sc region in the @xmath21 state",
    "is interpreted as a coexisting insulating phase in the surface vicinity .    in smis measurements , a shift of the fully symmetric molecular vibration mode",

    "the sc phase gives a higher frequency in the @xmath31 mode at low temperatures,@xcite demonstrating that the homogeneous sc state appears in the _ s _ state . on the other hand , in the map of the _ q _ state ( fig .",
    "[ fig : smis](b ) ) , we find dark areas with much lower frequency than for the sc phase . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : smis](d ) , the peak of the @xmath31 mode in the dark area ( b - site ) is shifted toward lower frequency compared with that in the remaining bright area ( a - site ) .",
    "the corresponding reflectance spectra at almost the same positions in the _ s _ state are very similar ( fig .",
    "[ fig : smis](c ) ) .",
    "thus , the inhomogeneous frequency map in the _ q _ state clearly indicates the coexistence of sc and insulating regions .",
    "figures [ fig : smis](e ) and [ fig : smis](f ) show peak frequency histograms .",
    "the histogram in the _ s _ state has a narrow maximum at 13201330 @xmath17 , whereas that in the _ q _ state is spread over 13001330 @xmath17 with a double peak structure , reflecting spatial inhomogeneity in the _ q _ state .",
    "in the phase diagram of the @xmath0-(et)@xmath5 system,@xcite the sc and antiferromagnetic mott insulating ( afi ) phases appear next to one another .",
    "the ground state in @xmath0-h8et - br is the sc phase , while the fully deuterated salt @xmath0-(d8et)@xmath1cu[n(cn)@xmath1]br ( abbreviated as @xmath0-d8et - br , where d8et is fully - deuterated bedt - ttf ) , has an afi ground state accompanied by a minor sc phase ( phase separation).@xcite deuteration therefore changes the ground state from the sc to afi phase through a first - order mott transition.@xcite this is likely caused by a structural modulation in the slight change of the bond length between c - h and c - d bonds , i.e. , chemical pressure .",
    "the decrease of the bandwidth @xmath32 by deuteration results in an increase in @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the on - site coulomb interaction .",
    "this leads to a crossing of the mott boundary toward the afi ground state .",
    "the minor sc phase in @xmath0-d8et - br is further suppressed by faster cooling , though it was believed that superconductivity in @xmath0-h8et - br is robust even after fast cooling.@xcite furthermore , in @xmath35c - nmr studies of @xmath0-h8et - br after fast cooling , no trace of the afi phase has been observed.@xcite on the contrary , a marked crystalline size effect on the sc volume fraction in the @xmath21 state is found , reflecting macroscopic suppression of superconductivity and an insulating region with 50100 @xmath3 m diameter is directly observed by the smis technique .    recently , macroscopic phase separation has been found near the mott transition for the d8et molecular substituted system @xmath0-[(h8et)@xmath36(d8et)@xmath37@xmath1cu[n(cn)@xmath1]br by the same smis measurement.@xcite for the @xmath21 state with @xmath26 = 0.7 , it was observed that the dominant insulating region contains a small sc region.@xcite this corresponding to a sc volume fraction suppressed to much less than @xmath4 10%.@xcite similarly , the present insulating region observed in quenched @xmath0-h8et - br ( an end - member with @xmath26 = 0 ) seems to grow over a wide area of 50100 @xmath3 m diameter . at first sight , one might regard the result for @xmath26 = 0 as evidence that large portions of the sample volume become insulating .",
    "this is however inconsistent with the large sc volume even in the @xmath21 state of 8090% ( fig .",
    "[ fig : chit](c ) ) .",
    "we here note that the skin depth @xmath38 in the smis measurement , @xmath39 , is roughly estimated to be 0.7 @xmath3 m , where @xmath40 is the speed of light and using the values @xmath41 1000 @xmath17 and @xmath42 s / cm.@xcite thus , although the smis measurements provide satisfactory bulk properties at a depth of approximately 1 @xmath3 m , they do not give information on regions much deeper than @xmath38 from the crystalline surface . taking account of absence of the insulating regions detectable in nmr@xcite",
    ", the existence of the insulating domains at inner site will be extracted .",
    "accordingly , we suggest that the insulating regions in quenched @xmath0-h8et - br are located in the surface vicinity and the depth of the thin domain is distributed over the surface . to verify this proposal , detailed nmr measurements for a quenched single crystal with several sample sizes will be required .    in the following ,",
    "we discuss the mean depth scale of the thin domain .",
    "a crude model can explain the sc suppression in the _ q _ state , suggesting that the insulating region extends down to a depth of @xmath4 2 @xmath3 m .    for the magnetic susceptibility measurements , we chose samples with a similar dimensional ratio of @xmath43:@xmath44:@xmath45 @xmath46 1:0.9:0.2 .",
    "we here adopt the longest length @xmath26 as the parameter representing the sample size , namely , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and the sample volume @xmath49 , where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are dimensionless numbers , @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the first finding is that an almost perfect meissner effect is observed in the _ s _ state , regardless of @xmath26 .",
    "thus the sc volume in the _ s _ state ( @xmath54 ) can be defined as the crystalline volume : @xmath55 .",
    "of course the sc volume is not the same as @xmath56 , because the magnetic field penetrates into the surface by @xmath8 ; however , it is sufficiently negligible , as shown below .",
    "the second finding is that the sc volume decreases in smaller samples by quenching , i.e. , a smaller @xmath26 gives a larger @xmath57 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : vx ] . to consider @xmath57 as a function of @xmath26 , we here assume an sc state with a rectangular insulating shell : superconductivity in the _ q _ state is suppressed in a mean depth @xmath14 from all the surfaces and edges ( i.e. , @xmath14 is the thickness of the thin shell shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : vx ] ) and @xmath14 is independent of sample size . on the basis of this assumption , the sc volume in the _ q _ state is @xmath58 .",
    "we finally obtain the non - sc fraction in the _ q _ state as @xmath59 for @xmath60 , where @xmath61 .",
    "this fraction can be compared with the experimental values of @xmath25 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : vx ] , @xmath62 is depicted as a function of @xmath26 for @xmath14 = 0.5 , 2 , and 4 @xmath3 m ( solid curves ) .",
    "one can see that the curve for @xmath14 = 2 @xmath3 m is in good accordance with the experimental data .",
    "this value of @xmath14 is adequate for the present system , because it satisfies all the following conditions : ( i ) @xmath60 ( @xmath46 200 @xmath3 m ) , ( ii ) @xmath63 ( @xmath46 0.60.7 @xmath3m@xcite ) , and ( iii ) @xmath64 ( @xmath46 0.7 @xmath3 m ) .",
    "the first two conditions justify the derivation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : vx ] ) and the third guarantees that the bulk insulating properties are surely captured in the smis studies .",
    "regardless of the naive assumption that the sc state is suppressed over all the surfaces , this shell - type model well explains the present crystalline size effect . indeed , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : smis](b ) , the sc region clearly remains in the _ q _ state .",
    "we never rule out the existence of insulating regions that penetrate further into the sample than @xmath14 .",
    "the existence of a macroscopic insulating phase at a depth of a few @xmath3 m explains the overestimation of the fast cooling data for @xmath9 observed in the low magnetic field measurements.@xcite in the magnetization ( @xmath65 ) measurements performed in magnetic fields higher than @xmath12 , @xmath8 is obtained from the slope in the @xmath66 curves , in which the influence of the insulating regions is sufficiently negligible.@xcite however , in the low field measurements , the correct estimation of @xmath8 is disturbed by the shell - type insulating domain induced by fast cooling , because the magnetic field penetrates into the insulating regions .",
    "this leads to the overestimation of @xmath9 as described below .",
    "if the suppression of the sc volume is attributed to the magnetic penetration depth to the sc state from the edge , @xmath9 becomes very large , @xmath4 24100 @xmath3m.@xcite however , this is an incorrect treatment because the suppressed sc volume fraction after quenching mainly contains the contribution of the insulating shell with @xmath14 , as demonstrated in fig.[fig : vx ] .",
    "accordingly , the very large @xmath9 in the low field measurements after fast cooling can be explained as being due to the influence of the shell - type insulating domain .",
    "finally we discuss what happens after fast cooling in @xmath0-h8et - br .",
    "two contributions originate from fast cooling .",
    "the first is the chemical pressure effect , as in the case of deuteration . as discussed in previous reports,@xcite",
    "fast cooling through 80 k decreases @xmath32 , giving rise to an increase of @xmath33 .",
    "thus , the macroscopic non - sc region in quenched @xmath0-h8et - br will also be a mott insulating phase , because @xmath0-h8et - br is in the vicinity of the mott insulating phase .",
    "indeed , no sc suppression is detected in @xmath0-(h8et)@xmath1cu(ncs)@xmath1 , which is farther from the mott boundary .",
    "the present size effect on the sc volume and the large increase of @xmath9 observed in the low field measurements@xcite are due to the existence of the macroscopic afi region induced by chemical pressure .    the second contribution from fast cooling is the introduction of molecular disorder .",
    "there is an internal degree of freedom in the terminal ethylene groups of the et molecule ( conformational disorder ) .",
    "the conformational disorder is thermally excited at room temperature@xcite and is frozen into the system by fast cooling .",
    "the frozen disorder will be distributed randomly all over the sample , both in the sc and non - sc regions .",
    "the disorder in the sc region gives impurity scattering .",
    "the increase of the dingle temperature@xcite and the slight increase of @xmath9 observed in the high field measurements@xcite can be explained as the influence of quasi - particle scattering by the increase of disorder in the fast cooling process .",
    "meanwhile , a decrease of @xmath28,@xcite vortex pinning suppression,@xcite and an increase of the residual resistivity@xcite may result from both the contributions of microscopic impurity scattering and macroscopic insulating region ( or boundary ) formation by fast cooling .",
    "the question as to why the insulating region grows in the vicinity of the surface is still open .",
    "a possible speculation is that much more disorders in the surface vicinity are induced by very fast cooling than those in the inner site .",
    "a very fast cooling treatment may not guarantee a homogeneous cooling state within a sample , because of a thermal flow problem .",
    "such inhomogeneous distribution of disorders may result in the present shell type insulating state . besides",
    ", several authors have reported unconventional electronic properties arising from the surface state.@xcite for example , in @xmath0-(h8et)@xmath1cu(ncs)@xmath1 , two kinds of photoemission spectra have been found , attributed to the different surface types.@xcite however , the present shell - type insulating domain has a bulk scale of @xmath4 2 @xmath3 m in depth , which is about 700 times larger than the inter - layer distance @xmath4 15  .",
    "this seems to be too large as a coherence scale originating from the surface structure of the first layer , such as structural reconstruction .",
    "further study will be needed to clarify this point .",
    "in conclusion , we have proposed a macroscopic shell - type insulating domain in quenched @xmath0-h8et - br by the observation of a marked size effect on the sc suppression and by smis mapping of the _ q _ state .",
    "the thin insulating domain is located in the surface vicinity with 50100 @xmath3 m diameter and a few @xmath3 m depth . the very large value of @xmath9 obtained from the measurements in magnetic fields lower than @xmath12 after fast cooling can be explained well by the existence of the shell - type insulating domain .",
