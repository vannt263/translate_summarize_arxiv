    "when heavy negative particles ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , etc . )",
    "stop in matter , they usually form exotic atoms in highly excited states with principal quantum number @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the reduced mass of the exotic atom and @xmath6 is the electron mass .",
    "the exotic - atom formation is followed by an atomic cascade consisting of multistep transitions to lower atomic states . for hadronic atoms ,",
    "the atomic cascade is a complete life history because the hadrons get absorbed by the nuclei with high probability before reaching the ground state .",
    "muonic atoms ( where the absorption is weak ) de - excite to the ground state and engage in various reactions ( muon catalyzed fusion , muon transfer , molecular formation ) with initial conditions determined by the atomic cascade . in both cases , the atomic cascade can reveal important information about the properties of exotic atoms and reactions with atoms in excited states .",
    "this paper , supplementing the earlier reviews @xcite , focuses on the recent progress in theoretical studies of the atomic cascade in light muonic and pionic atoms .",
    "a brief summary of the cascade processes in the exotic atoms with @xmath0 is given in table  [ tabcm ] .",
    "the radiative de - excitation and the nuclear absorption ( in hadronic atoms ) do not depend on experimental conditions directly .",
    "all other processes occur in collisions with surrounding atoms and their rates are proportional to the hydrogen density and usually depend on energy .",
    "at least tree cascade mechanisms are essential for the basic understanding of the atomic cascade @xcite : the radiative transitions , the external auger effect , and the stark mixing . in this paper ,",
    "the cascade models , which include these three mechanisms only , will be called the minimal cascade model ( mcm ) .",
    ".[tabcm]cascade processes in exotic atoms with @xmath0 and their energy dependence . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "since the rates of the radiative transitions are well known , the competition between the radiative and collisional processes can be used for testing the collisional de - excitation rates by measuring the x - ray yields at various densities .",
    "the most suitable system for this study is the muonic hydrogen where the x - ray yields are not suppressed by absorption during the cascade .",
    "another convenient factor is that the rates of the auger de - excitation , which is the main collisional process , have a weak energy dependence , therefore they are not strongly affected by uncertainties in the kinetic energy distribution .",
    "the main features of the density dependence of the yields of the @xmath7-lines were already fairly well explained by the mcm @xcite .",
    "figure  [ figxrayhe]a shows the experimental data in comparison with the recent calculations @xcite that include , in addition to the auger de - excitation , the coulomb transitions .",
    "+    the relative role of the collisional processes can be illustrated by the following simplified calculation of the density dependence of the @xmath8 ratio using the method suggested in @xcite .",
    "the yields @xmath9 and @xmath10 are given by the balance equations : @xmath11 where @xmath12 are the populations of the atomic states @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the effective rates of the radiative transitions , @xmath16 is the hydrogen density in units of liquid hydrogen density @xmath17 ( lhd ) , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the rates of the auger and coulomb transitions normalized to lhd . equations ( [ yka],[ykb ] ) are valid at @xmath20 and give the following dependence of the ratio @xmath21 on the density : @xmath22 if one neglects the coulomb de - excitation , then eq .",
    "( [ yayb ] ) gives @xmath23 at @xmath24 which is slightly below the corresponding experimental ratio @xmath25 @xcite . at @xmath26",
    "the difference is larger : @xmath27 and @xmath28 . with the coulomb transitions taken into account the theoretical ratio gets closer to the experimental values as discussed in @xcite .",
    "this observation can be considered as evidence that some mechanisms in addition to the auger effect , like the coulomb transitions , are needed for a better description of the x - ray yields .",
    "the evolution of the kinetic energy distribution during the atomic cascade is very important because many collisional processes are energy dependent ( table  1 ) . in muonic atoms",
    ", it determines the initial energy distribution in the ground state , which influences the diffusion of @xmath29-atoms @xcite and muon catalyzed fusion @xcite .",
    "a large fraction of the atoms is not thermalizedev  hot or highly - energetic. ] during the atomic cascade , as it follows from the cascade calculation demonstrated in fig.[figxrayhe]b .",
    "+    the kinetic energy distribution in the atomic cascade can be studied with different methods .",
    "direct probes which are model independent are based on the measurements of the doppler broadening of the x - ray lines in @xmath30 and @xmath31 and the @xmath32-tof spectra in the reaction @xmath33 . given the kinetic energy distribution @xmath34 at the instant of the radiative transition , the doppler broadening of the x - ray line @xmath35 has the form : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the x - ray energy in the atomic rest frame and @xmath38 is the mass of the atom . a straightforward inversion of the transformation ( [ dbwe ] )",
    "gives the cumulative energy distribution @xmath39 : @xmath40 figure  [ figmupdoppler ] shows an example of the calculated distributions for the @xmath41-transition in @xmath30 atoms at 15  bar which features characteristic peaks in the high - energy component resulting from the coulomb de - excitation discussed in sec .",
    "[ seccoulomb ] .",
    "the doppler broadening of the neutron tof spectra from the reaction @xmath42 is related to the kinetic energy distribution in a similar way ( see @xcite ) .",
    "a good knowledge of the kinetic energy distribution is essential for precise measurements of the @xmath43 nuclear width @xcite .",
    "for example , the kinetic energy @xmath44ev corresponds to a doppler broadening of the @xmath41 line @xmath45ev which is about 10% of the nuclear width @xmath46ev .",
    "indirect methods of probing the kinetic energy distribution rely on models of the kinetics .",
    "in particular , the first evidence for epithermal muonic atoms was found in muon catalyzed fusion ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "important results on the initial kinetic energy distribution in the ground state were obtained from the diffusion of @xmath30 and @xmath47 atoms at low density @xcite ; they allow one to determine the energy distribution in excited states using cascade models as discussed in @xcite .",
    "indirect methods exploiting energy dependent processes , like the muon transfer in excited states @xcite , were used for the estimates of the average energy in excited states , however , they are not sensitive to the details of the energy distributions .",
    "the elastic collisions , where the principal quantum number of the exotic atom is not changed , play two important roles in the atomic cascade .",
    "first , the stark mixing is nothing but the elastic scattering as long as only the rates of transitions between the @xmath48-sublevels of the same @xmath32 are concerned .",
    "second , the energy losses in elastic collisions lead to the deceleration of the epithermal exotic atoms .    the basic features of the elastic scattering can be explained in the semiclassical approximation @xcite .",
    "the motion of the @xmath30 atom with the parabolic quantum numbers @xmath49 in the electric field of a hydrogen atom is described by the effective potential . ]",
    "@xmath50 where @xmath51 , @xmath52 is the @xmath30 reduced mass , @xmath53 is the electron screening factor , @xmath54 is the electron bohr radius . neglecting the electron screening",
    ", this corresponds to the well known @xmath55 potential with a large dimensionless coupling constant @xmath56 ( @xmath38 is the reduced mass of the @xmath57 system ) .",
    "the @xmath55 behaviour leads to the @xmath58 dependence of the elastic cross section . in the limit @xmath59",
    ", many partial waves contribute to the scattering , and the differential cross section can be approximated by the classical result ( @xmath60 ) : @xmath61 the average coupling constant for given @xmath32 is @xmath62 .",
    "the cross section ( [ xelcl],[xelclw ] ) has an unphysical singularity at @xmath63 which must be regularized by taking the electron screening into account .    a semiclassical model of the stark mixing",
    "was developed in @xcite and used with some variations and refinements in @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the exotic atom moves along a straight line trajectory with a constant velocity through the electric field of a hydrogen atom , and the stark transitions induced by this electric field are calculated . instead of straight line trajectories",
    "the classical trajectories can be used as in @xcite .",
    "the characteristic scale of the stark mixing cross section is determined by the electron screening of the proton electric field , i.e. by the size of the hydrogen atom which makes stark mixing the fastest collision process in the atomic cascade , see figs .",
    "[ figmuppip ] .",
    "recently the problem of the elastic scattering of exotic atoms in excited states was treated in a quantum mechanical framework using the adiabatic expansion @xcite , the calculation being done in a single - channel adiabatic approximation .",
    "the results show fair agreement with the semiclassical calculations @xcite for the collision energies @xmath64ev . a detailed discussion of the stark collisions , including the relative role of transitions with different @xmath65 can be found in @xcite",
    ". it would be desirable to extend the quantum mechanical model of the elastic collisions by including the effects of the shift and width of the @xmath66 states as well as the coupling between different adiabatic terms .",
    "the elastic scattering leads to the deceleration of exotic atoms if the kinetic energy is larger than the target temperature .",
    "the effective deceleration rate for the @xmath57 collisions is defined by the transport cross section : @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the atomic velocity , @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the @xmath30 and hydrogen masses correspondingly . using the classical result ( [ xelcl],[xelclw ] ) one gets the following estimation of the transport cross section : @xmath71 the deceleration rate ( fig .  [ figmuppip ] ) is a crude measure of the slowing down ; in general one uses the differential cross sections in detailed kinetics calculations .",
    "the first estimation of the deceleration rates was done in @xcite , semiclassical calculations were done in @xcite , and quantum mechanical calculations in @xcite .",
    "the coulomb de - excitation ( table  1 ) , where the transition energy is shared between the colliding particles , is an important acceleration mechanism producing hot ( @xmath72ev ) exotic atoms ( see fig .",
    "[ figmupdoppler]a ) .",
    "the highly - energetic @xmath31 atoms were discovered experimentally in @xcite , and a multicomponent structure of the energy distribution was found in @xcite .",
    "recent experiments in liquid and gaseous hydrogen @xcite found the shape of the kinetic energy distribution to be consistent with the coulomb mechanism .",
    "the cascade calculations @xcite show that the @xmath31 atoms with kinetic energy @xmath73ev are not significantly decelerated between the coulomb de - excitation and the nuclear reaction . for the atoms with @xmath74ev",
    "the deceleration is important and the coulomb peaks are expected to be smeared out",
    ".    the earlier calculations of the coulomb transitions @xcite were rather controversial . the latest calculations @xcite seem to clarify the theoretical picture .",
    "this removes one of the uncertainties in the cascade calculation of the past where a coulomb rate - tuning parameter was used to normalize the calculated high - energy component to the measurements in pionic hydrogen @xcite .",
    "it is not excluded that the coulomb de - excitation can be part of a multistep process .",
    "for instance , the formation of excited molecular states can be followed by a coulomb - like decay @xcite .",
    "the atomic cascade in mixtures of hydrogen isotopes provides additional information on the collisional processes in excited states .",
    "the muon transfer in excited states was studied in detail in the recent experiments @xcite by measuring the relative yields of the @xmath30 and @xmath47 @xmath7-lines in liquid and gaseous hd mixtures .",
    "figure  [ figq1s ] shows a comparison of the experimental data with the cascade calculations for the probability @xmath75 that the muon captured initially by the hydrogen in a hd mixture reaches the @xmath30 ground state ( the fraction @xmath76 is transferred to @xmath47 during the atomic cascade ) .",
    "since the rates of the muon transfer @xmath77 are strongly energy dependent @xcite , the @xmath75 factor is very sensitive to the kinetic energy distribution in the excited states @xcite .",
    "the theoretical models tend to predict a stronger dependence of @xmath75 on the deuterium fraction and the density than experimentally observed ( this so - called `` @xmath75-problem '' is known since the first experimental results were obtained from the kinetic analysis of muon catalyzed fusion @xcite ) .",
    "the agreement between theory and experiment improves if the transfer rates are scaled by a factor of about 0.5 @xcite .",
    "this suggests that some mechanism may still be missing in the cascade model .",
    "one candidate is the resonant molecular formation in excited states ( resonance side - path mechanism @xcite ) which can produce a significant inverse transfer @xmath78 leading to an enhancement of @xmath75 as discussed in @xcite .",
    "the current cascade models are advancing from a phenomenological level towards straightforward detailed calculations of the kinetics .",
    "the recent progress in quantum mechanical calculations of the scattering of exotic atoms in excited states makes it possible to get rid of tuning parameters and ad hoc assumptions in future calculations .",
    "the ultimate goal of _ ab initio _ cascade calculations does not seem to be unrealistic any more .",
    "a detailed knowledge of atomic cascade is essential for precision x - ray spectroscopy of the @xmath31 atom where the doppler - broadening corrections must be taken into account in order to measure the nuclear width of the @xmath79 state . the new generation of precise experiments with the @xmath30 and @xmath31 atoms",
    "@xcite will make it possible to study the kinetics of the atomic cascade in great detail and to perform critical tests of the theoretical methods used in the calculations of various reactions with excited exotic atoms .",
    "the results of theses studies will also be very useful for other systems like @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
