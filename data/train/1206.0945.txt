    "the size of the particles is assumed to be small compared to the typical length over which the velocity gradient  @xmath3 changes ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "for turbulent flows , this assumption is satisfied if the particles are smaller than the kolmogorov scale , where viscosity smooths out the velocity fluctuations ; the reynolds number of the flow at the scale of a particle is thus less than  1 .",
