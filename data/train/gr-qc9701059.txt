    "understanding the origin of the black - hole entropy is one of the most fascinating problems in black - hole physics  @xcite .",
    "the concept of the black - hole entropy traces back to the work by bekenstein , who pointed out that the behavior of the basic physical quantities describing stationary black holes has an analogous structure to that of ordinary thermodynamical systems  @xcite .",
    "this thermodynamical structure inherent in the black - hole theory is usually called the ` black - hole thermodynamics ' . in analogy with ordinary material systems , then , it is natural to expect that the black - hole entropy comes from microscopic degrees of freedom of a system including a black hole .",
    "this suggests that quantum theory of gravity should inevitably take part in the black - hole thermodynamics . in this sense , understanding the origin of the black - hole entropy shall provide us with important information on quantum gravity .",
    "this is one among the several reasons why the black - hole entropy needs to be understood at the fundamental level .",
    "let us recall basic properties of the black - hole thermodynamics by taking a simple example .",
    "we consider the one - parameter family of schwarzschild black holes parameterized by the mass @xmath0 . here and throughout this paper , we assume that the relation analogous to the first law of thermodynamics holds for a black - hole system . in the present example , there is only one parameter @xmath0 characterizing a black hole . therefore , this relation should be of the simplest form @xmath1 where @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are quantities that are identified with the energy , the entropy and the temperature of a black hole , respectively . the relation eq.([eqn:1st - law ] ) is called the first law of the black - hole thermodynamics  @xcite .",
    "thus , if two of the quantities @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are given , @xmath5 determines the remaining quantity . for simplicity ,",
    "let us call this procedure of defining energy , entropy and temperature which satisfy the first law ( eq.([eqn:1st - law ] ) ) the ` construction of thermodynamics ' .    in the present example",
    ", @xmath0 is the only parameter characterizing the family of black holes .",
    "therefore the simplest combination which yields the dimension of energy is @xmath6 this is the energy of the black hole .",
    "there is also a natural choice for @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "hawking showed that a black hole with surface gravity @xmath7 emits thermal radiation of a matter field ( which plays the role of a thermometer ) at temperature @xmath8 .",
    "moreover one can show that if any matter field in a thermal - equilibrium state at any temperature is scattered by a black hole , it goes to another thermal - equilibrium state at a temperature closer to @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "thus it is natural to define the temperature of a schwarzschild black hole with mass @xmath0 by @xmath9 since @xmath10  @xcite .    from eqs.([eqn:1st - law])-([eqn :",
    "t - bh ] ) , we can construct the thermodynamics for the schwarzschild black holes .",
    "thus we get an expression for @xmath3 given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the area of the event horizon and @xmath13 is some constant . since a value of @xmath13 is not essential in our discussions , we shall set hereafter @xmath14 it is well - known that classically the area of the event horizon does not decrease in time just as the ordinary thermodynamical entropy .",
    "the result eq.([eqn : s - bh ] ) looks reasonable in this sense .",
    "indeed this observation was the original motivation for the introduction of the black - hole thermodynamics  @xcite .",
    "however , it is not clear to what extent @xmath3 is related with the information as the ordinary thermodynamical entropy is . at this stage",
    "we would like to point out that the third law of thermodynamics does not hold for a black hole irrespective of the choice of the value for @xmath13 as is seen from eqs.([eqn : t - bh ] ) and ( [ eqn : s - bh ] ) .",
    "we shall come back to this point in  [ subsection : discrepancy ] . in any case , understanding the origin of @xmath3 is an important problem in black - hole physics .",
    "there have been many attempts to understand the origin of the black - hole entropy  @xcite . among them",
    "we shall concentrate only on the so - called entanglement entropy  @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to judge whether entanglement entropy can be regarded as the origin of black - hole entropy .",
    "for this purpose it is effective to investigate the whole structure of the thermodynamics obtained from the entanglement entropy , rather than just to examine the apparent structure of the entropy alone .",
    "thus we shall construct the ` thermodynamics of entanglement ' and compare it with the black - hole thermodynamics .",
    "as is expected by the above example of the black - hole thermodynamics , we have to define either energy or temperature to construct the thermodynamics of entanglement . combining it with the entanglement entropy , which is already at hand  @xcite , the other",
    "is automatically defined by means of eq.([eqn:1st - law ] ) . in this paper",
    "we shall choose the option to define the entanglement energy firstly , deriving the entanglement temperature afterwards .",
    "we shall consider two possible definitions of entanglement energy .",
    "therefore we can construct two different kinds of thermodynamics by combining each of these definitions of entanglement energy with the entanglement entropy .",
    "we show that neither of these thermodynamics is compatible with the black - hole thermodynamics if no gravitational effects are taken into account .",
    "after that , we see how inclusion of gravity alter the thermodynamics of the entanglement .",
    "we give a suggestive argument that they have a common behavior if gravitational effects are taken into account properly .",
    "thus the entanglement entropy passes a non - trivial check to be the origin of the black - hole entropy .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : sent ] we review the concept of the entanglement entropy . in section [ sec : eent ] we propose two natural definitions of entanglement energy and present general formulas for calculating the energy . in section [ sec : example ] explicit expression for the entanglement energy are derived for some tractable models with the help of the formulas prepared in section [ sec : eent ] . in section [ sec : discussion ]",
    "we construct the thermodynamics of entanglement and compare it with the black hole thermodynamics from various angles .",
    "section [ sec : summary ] is devoted to the summary of our results .",
    "in this section we review the definition and basic properties of the entanglement entropy .      here",
    "we give a general definition of entanglement entropy , since it is not usually made clear in the literature .",
    "let @xmath15 be a hilbert space constructed from two hilbert spaces @xmath16 and @xmath17 as @xmath18 where @xmath19 denotes a tensor product followed by a suitable completion .",
    "we call an element @xmath20 _ prime _ if @xmath21 can be written as @xmath22 with @xmath23 and @xmath24 . for example",
    ", @xmath25 is prime since @xmath21 can be represented as @xmath26 . on the other hand @xmath27 is not prime if neither @xmath28 and @xmath29 nor @xmath30 and @xmath31 are linearly dependent .",
    "the entanglement entropy @xmath32 defined below can be regarded as a measure of the non - prime nature of an element of @xmath33 .",
    "first of all , from an element @xmath21 of @xmath34 with unit norm we construct an operator @xmath35 ( ` density operator ' ) by @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the inner product which is antilinear with respect to @xmath21 . in this context",
    "@xmath35 represents a ` pure state ' .    from @xmath35",
    "we define another operator ( ` reduced density operator ' ) @xmath38 by @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are orthonormal bases of @xmath42 and @xmath43 respectively .",
    "note that @xmath44 for an arbitrary bounded operator @xmath45 on @xmath43 .    finally we define the entanglement entropy with respect to @xmath35 as @xmath46        \\equiv    -k_b{\\rm tr}_{\\cal w } \\left [ \\rho_{\\cal w }                         \\ln \\rho_{\\cal w } \\right]\\ \\ \\ .",
    "\\label{eqn : entropy}\\ ] ] we can totally exchange the roles played by @xmath16 and @xmath17 in eq.([eqn : reduced ] ) and eq.([eqn : entropy ] ) .",
    "the entanglement entropy is so defined as to be invariant under the exchange of @xmath47 and @xmath17 when @xmath35 corresponds to a pure state , i.e. , when @xmath35 is given by eq.([eqn : rho ] ) .",
    "( see _ appendix _ for the proof of this property . )    as a simple example , let us consider spin states for a system consisting of an electron and a proton .",
    "we take @xmath48 for an electron and @xmath49 for a proton , where ` @xmath21 ' and ` @xmath50 ' are for ` up ' , while ` @xmath51 ' and ` @xmath52 ' are for ` down ' .",
    "then @xmath53 is spanned by @xmath54 now let us consider a state @xmath55 which is clearly a prime state . according to eq.([eqn : reduced ] ) , we then get @xmath56 here ` @xmath57 ' is for ` electron ' . by a suitable diagonalization of this matrix ,",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath58 .",
    "we can exchange the roles between ` electron ' and ` proton ' : we then get @xmath59 ( ` @xmath60 ' is for ` proton ' ) which again leads to @xmath58 .    on the contrary ,",
    "an @xmath61-state @xmath62 is not a prime state . for this state",
    "the reduced density operators are given by @xmath63 therefore we get @xmath64 .      in the case of black - hole physics , the presence of the event horizon causes a natural decomposition of a hilbert space @xmath65 of all states of matter fields to a tensor product of the state spaces inside and outside a black hole as @xmath66 for example , let us take a scalar field .",
    "we can suppose that its one - particle hilbert space @xmath67 is decomposed as @xmath68 where @xmath69 is a space of mode functions with supports inside the horizon and @xmath70 is a space of mode functions with supports outside the horizon .",
    "then we can construct new hilbert spaces ( ` fock spaces ' ) @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 from @xmath74 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 , respectively , as @xmath75 where @xmath76 denotes the symmetrization .",
    "now these three hilbert spaces satisfy the relation ( [ eqn : f = f1*f2 ] ) .",
    "hence the entanglement entropy @xmath77 is defined by the procedure given at the beginning of this section ( eqs.([eqn : rho])-([eqn : entropy ] ) ) for each state in @xmath71 .",
    "the entanglement entropy @xmath77 originates from a tensor product structure of the hilbert space as eq.([eqn : f = f1*f2 ] ) , which is caused by the existence of the boundary between two regions ( the event horizon ) through eq.([eqn : h = h1+h2 ] ) .",
    "furthermore the symmetric property of @xmath77 between @xmath16 and @xmath17 mentioned before also suggests that @xmath77 is related with a boundary between two regions .",
    "in fact @xmath77 turns out to be proportional to the area of such a boundary ( a model for the event horizon ) in simple models ( see the next subsection ) . in view of eq.([eqn : s - bh ] ) with eq.([eqn : constants ] ) , thus , the entanglement entropy has a nature similar to the black hole entropy .    the relevance of the entanglement entropy to the black hole entropy is also suggested by the following observation .",
    "let us consider a free scalar field on a background geometry describing a gravitational collapse to a black hole .",
    "we compare the black hole entropy and the entanglement entropy for this system .",
    "we begin with the black hole entropy . in the initial region of the spacetime",
    ", there is no horizon and the entropy around this region can be regarded as zero . in the final region , on the other hand , there is an event horizon so that the black - hole possesses non - zero entropy . as for the entanglement entropy , the existence of the event horizon naturally divides the hilbert space @xmath71 of all states of the scalar field into @xmath78 . thus according to the argument in the previous subsection , the scalar field in some pure state possesses non - zero entanglement entropy . in this manner",
    ", we observe that the black - hole entropy and the entanglement entropy come from the same origin , i.e. the existence of the event horizon .",
    "this is the reason why the entanglement entropy is regarded as one of the potential candidates for the origin of the black - hole entropy .",
    "the relation between the entanglement entropy and the black hole entropy was analyzed in terms of simple tractable models by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they considered a free scalar field on a flat spacelike hypersurface @xmath79 embedded in a 4-dimensional minkowski spacetime , and calculated the entanglement entropy for a division of @xmath80 into two regions @xmath81 and @xmath82 with a common boundary @xmath83 . here",
    "@xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 are , respectively , the models of the interior , the exterior of the black holes and the horizon .",
    "ref.@xcite chooses @xmath83 to be a 2-dimensional flat surface , and the matter state to be the ground state , showing that the resulting entanglement entropy becomes proportional to the area of @xmath83 .",
    "ref.@xcite chooses @xmath83 to be a @xmath84-sphere in @xmath85 , and chooses @xmath81 and @xmath82 to be the interior and the exterior of the sphere .",
    "the matter state is chosen to be the ground state .",
    "then it is shown that the resulting entanglement entropy is again proportional to the area of @xmath83 .",
    "both of the results can be expressed as @xmath86 = \\frac{k_b   { \\cal n}_s}{a^2}a \\ \\ \\ ,   \\label{eqn : sent - result}\\ ] ] where @xmath87 is the ground - state density matrix , @xmath45 is the area of the boundary , @xmath88 is a cutoff length , and @xmath89 is a dimensionless numerical constant of order unity .",
    "this coincides with ( [ eqn : s - bh ] ) and ( [ eqn : constants ] ) if the cut - off length @xmath88 is chosen as @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the planck length . here",
    "note that @xmath88 depends only on the planck length .",
    "in this paper we adopt the same simple models to construct thermodynamics of entanglement , and to discuss its relevance to the black hole thermodynamics . there",
    "the relation ( [ eqn : a = lpl ] ) and the subsequent comment will play an important role .",
    "in this section we define the entanglement energy to construct the thermodynamics of entanglement .",
    "we give two possible definitions of entanglement energy .",
    "the difference between them comes from the difference in the way to formulate the reduction of a system ( caused by , for instance , the formation of an event horizon ) . in the first definition (  [ subsection : eenta ] and  [ subsection : eentb ] ) , we assume that the state of a total system undergoes a change in the course of the reduction of the system ( so that the density matrix of the system changes actually ) , while operators are regarded as unchanged . in the second definition (  [ subsection : eentc ] and",
    " [ subsection : eentd ] ) , on the contrary , we assume that some operators drop out from the set of all observables , while the state is regarded as unchanged . since at present we can not judge whether and which one of these treatments reflects the true process of reduction , the best way is to investigate both options . as we shall see in  [ sec : discussion ] , the universal behavior of the thermodynamics of entanglement does not depend on the choice of the entanglement energy .    to make our analysis a concrete one",
    ", we apply these definitions to the tractable models given in ",
    "[ subsection : bhcase ] .",

    "@xmath35 reduces to @xmath99 given by @xmath100 it is easy to see that the entropy associated with this density matrix becomes @xmath101 =       s_{ent}[\\rho ] + s'_{ent}[\\rho ] ,         \\label{eqn : sent - tot}\\ ] ] where @xmath102 $ ] and @xmath103 $ ] are entanglement entropy obtained through @xmath97 and @xmath98 , respectively . @xmath102 $ ] and @xmath103 $ ] are identical if @xmath35 is a pure state ( see the argument below eq .",
    "( [ eqn : entropy ] ) ) .",
    "it is clear that the partial systems labeled by ` 1 ' and ` 2 ' can be treated symmetrically : the symmetric property of the entanglement entropy for a pure state shows that it measures the entanglement between @xmath72 and @xmath73 , so that it is symmetrical in nature .",
    "accordingly , one can exchange the suffices ` 1 ' and ` 2 ' in the above formulas .",

    "in this paper we have tried to judge whether the black - hole entropy can be understood as the entanglement entropy associated with the division of spacetime by the event horizon .",
    "our strategy has been to look at the whole thermodynamical structures inherent in a black - hole system and models introduced in @xcite to relate their entanglement entropy to the black - hole entropy . following this strategy",
    "we have undertaken the construction of the thermodynamics of entanglement .",
    "for this purpose , after reviewing the basics of the entanglement entropy @xmath77  @xcite , we have proposed two reasonable definitions of the entanglement energy @xmath267 . to obtain explicit values of @xmath267 , we have prepared basic formulas for the entanglement energy .",

    "the difficulty becomes clear in the context of the third law of thermodynamics .",
    "namely both the response to the variation of @xmath45 ( with @xmath88 or @xmath91 being fixed ) and the response to the variation of @xmath88 or @xmath91 ( with @xmath45 being fixed ) are very different in these two types of thermodynamics ( _ table _ [ table : summary ] ) . as is discussed in ",

    "then we get the universal behaviors of the thermodynamics of entanglement , eq.([eqn : ent - a ] ) . on the other hand , the behaviors eq.([eqn : bh - a ] ) of the black - hole thermodynamics are well - established results .",
    "though @xmath3 is also proportional to the area of the event horizon , @xmath45 , like @xmath77 , @xmath2 is proportional to @xmath328 rather than @xmath45 .",

    "<S> entanglement entropy is often speculated as a strong candidate for the origin of the black - hole entropy . to judge whether this speculation is true or not , it is effective to investigate the whole structure of thermodynamics obtained from the entanglement entropy , rather than just to examine the apparent structure of the entropy alone or to compare it with that of the black hole entropy . </S>",
    "<S> it is because entropy acquires a physical significance only when it is related to the energy and the temperature of a system . from this point of view </S>",
    "<S> , we construct a ` thermodynamics of entanglement ' by introducing an entanglement energy and compare it with the black - hole thermodynamics . </S>",
    "<S> we consider two possible definitions of entanglement energy . </S>",
    "<S> then we construct two different kinds of thermodynamics by combining each of these different definitions of entanglement energy with the entanglement entropy . </S>",
    "<S> we find that both of these two kinds of thermodynamics show significant differences from the black - hole thermodynamics if no gravitational effects are taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> these differences are in particular highlighted in the context of the third law of thermodynamics . </S>",
    "<S> finally we see how inclusion of gravity alter the thermodynamics of the entanglement . </S>",
    "<S> we give a suggestive argument that the thermodynamics of the entanglement behaves like the black - hole thermodynamics if the gravitational effects are included properly . </S>",
    "<S> thus the entanglement entropy passes a non - trivial check to be the origin of the black - hole entropy . </S>"
