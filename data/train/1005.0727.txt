    "the heavy - ion fusion reactions in the low - energy range near and below the coulomb barrier have been the subject of extensive experimental and theoretical efforts in the past decades  @xcite . beside the fact that the questions of the possible occurence of unexpected phenomena , such as breakup effects on the fusion reactions at near barrier energies  @xcite , are still unresolved , one has still to understand better the role of neutron transfers in the fusion process  @xcite .",
    "for instance , effects of neutron - rich projectiles on the formation of super - heavy elements ( she )  @xcite , especially with the development of newly available radioactive ion beams ( rib ) facilities need to be clarified as well as fusion hindrance at extremely low energies that remain among the most interesting open questions in the nuclear astrophysics domain @xcite",
    ". fusion enhancement below the coulomb barrier is one of the most studied phenomena and , measurements of fusion barrier distributions have been widely performed to investigate the mutual importance of both the nuclear structure and dynamical process effects on the sub - barrier fusion enhancement @xcite .",
    "coupled - channels ( cc ) calculations have been used to describe the reactions in this energy range theoretically ( see for example refs . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "fusion enhancement due to the static deformations and surface vibrations of the nuclei has been well described in the coupled - channels calculations @xcite .    the influence of the neutron transfer channels on sub - barrier fusion process @xcite is not yet fully understood . during the last 20 years",
    "a large number of experimental and theoretical investigations were undertaken to study the neutron - transfer mechanisms in competition with the fusion process .",
    "et al_.  @xcite proposed an original scenario that uses an empirical method involving a sequential transfer of several neutrons between the reactants .",
    "this multineutron transfer process is capable to initiate fusion at large internuclear distances and will smooth the fusion barrier distributions ( with larger width ) with lower energy thresholds . this ",
    "shift \" effect corresponds to the energy window for which the nuclei are allowed to come sufficiently close together for neutrons to flow freely between the target and projectile . as a consequence , this will reduce the effective barrier and enhance the fusion cross sections at sub - barrier energies .",
    "following this idea , rowley _",
    "et al_.  @xcite have first used a simple phenomenological model that simulates coupling to neutron transfer channels with a parametrized coupling matrix .",
    "later on , zagrebaev  @xcite proposed another semiclassical theoretical model that has been successfully used to reproduce the sub - barrier fusion enhancement of the old @xmath3ca+@xmath2zr reaction data of ref .",
    "@xcite by including the intermediate positive _ q_-value neutron transfer channels in the cc calculations .",
    "the failure of the cc calculations including only the couplings to the inelastic excitations indicates that couplings to neutron transfer channels may play a key role in the fusion dynamics near the barrier for medium - heavy systems such as @xmath3ca+@xmath4zr @xcite , @xmath5s+@xmath4zr @xcite , and @xmath6ne+@xmath7zr @xcite , the last two reactions being studied by measurements of large - angle quasielastic scattering .",
    "previous measurement of quasielastic scatterings of @xmath0s+@xmath4zr were also undertaken at backward angles near the barrier  @xcite ; their analysis gave indication that positive _",
    "q_-value neutron transfer channels should be included in the coupling scheme . up to now",
    "no fusion data exist neither for @xmath6ne+@xmath7zr nor for the @xmath0s+@xmath4zr reactions , it will be interesting to measure their fusion excitation functions . in order to disentangle the possible effect of positive _ q_-value neutron transfer couplings we decided to investigate the two last systems .",
    "we report here about the measurement of near- and sub - barrier fusion excitation functions of @xmath0s+@xmath1zr and @xmath0s+@xmath2zr performed with small energy steps and good statistics accuracy .",
    "+ our research will focus on the role of neutron transfers between the colliding nuclei as a mechanism that enhances the fusion cross sections at sub - barrier energies .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : sec .",
    "ii presents the experimental setup and details on the measurements .",
    "results of the analysis of the experimental data are given in sec .",
    "their discussion is finally proposed in sec .",

    "the experiment was performed at the hi-13 tandem accelerator of ciae , beijing .",
    "the collimated @xmath0s ( q = 10@xmath8 charge state ) beam was used to bombard the zirconium oxide targets .",
    "the beam intensity was stabilized in the 2 - 20 pna range in order to minimize the pile - up for each of the bombarding energies .",
    "the 3 mm diameter ( 98.87% enriched ) @xmath1zro@xmath9 and ( 86.4% enriched ) @xmath2zro@xmath9 targets were both 50 @xmath10g/@xmath11 thick and evaporated onto 15 @xmath10g/@xmath11 carbon foil backings .",
    "the beam energies varied over the range @xmath12 = 100 - 130 mev for @xmath0s+@xmath1zr and @xmath12 = 95 - 130 mev for @xmath0s+@xmath2zr ( in 1.33 mev steps at the higher and 0.67 mev at the lower energies ) and changed only downwards starting at @xmath12 = 130 mev in order to reduce the magnetic hysteresis for both targets .",
    "the target chamber contains four silicon detectors at @xmath13 = @xmath1425@xmath15 symmetrically ( right / left and up / down ) with respect to the beam axis in the forward direction in order to monitor the beam optics ( rutherford scattering ) and to provide an absolute normalization of the fusion cross sections .",
    "the fused evaporation residues ( er ) concentrated to within a few degrees of the incident beam direction were separated from the incident beam ( see fig .",
    "1 ) by an electrostatic deflector which design is pretty much similar to the experimental setup in legnaro  @xcite .",
    "it consists of two pairs of electrodes followed by an _",
    "e_-tof arrangement with of a microchannel plate ( mcp ) detector coupled to a si(au ) surface barrier detector .",
    "two - dimensional plots of the data were used to cleanly separate the er s from the beam - like products ( blp ) .",
    "a typical example of the time - of - flight versus energy spectrum for @xmath0s+@xmath2zr measured at @xmath12 = 130 mev and @xmath13 = 2@xmath15 is shown in fig .",

    "e_-tof of the events , following beam separation , taken at @xmath12 = 130 mev and at 2@xmath15 for the @xmath0s+@xmath2zr reaction .",
    "two groups of particles [ beam - like particles(blp ) and evaporation residues ( er ) ] are indicated.,width=288,height=240 ]    the particles coming from the target were selected before entering the fields by an entrance collimator of 3 mm diameter , corresponding to a @xmath16 = @xmath14 0.57@xmath15 opening .",
    "a 10@xmath17g/@xmath11 thick carbon foil clung to the collimator was used to reset the atomic charge state distribution on the ion path .",
    "the collimator of the mcp defined the solid angle of the electrostatic deflector as being approximately @xmath18 = 0.3 msr .",
    "er angular distributions were measured in the range @xmath13 = -4@xmath15 to @xmath13 = 10@xmath15 with step @xmath16 = 1@xmath15 at three beam energies ( @xmath12 = 100 , 115 , and 130 mev ) for both systems .",
    "the angular distributions were found to be symmetrical about @xmath13 = 0@xmath15 , as expected .",
    "their typical shape did not change appreciably with the beam energy .",
    "these combined angular distributions and the double gaussian fits were used to obtain the fusion cross sections . at each energy",
    "the number of er events was normalized to the rutherford scattering rates counted by the monitor detectors .",
    "for the most of energy points , only differential cross sections were measured at @xmath13 = 2@xmath15 , from the obtained values , the total er cross sections were deduced . using the solid angles ,",
    "the @xmath13 = 2@xmath15-to - total ratios and the measured transmission efficiencies , these er yields were transformed into total cross sections . since fission of the compound nucleus can be neglected for both systems , the measured cross sections were taken as complete fusion cross section @xmath19@xmath20 .",
    "the transmission efficiencies and the relevant voltages used to deflect the er were calibrated by the @xmath21ba beam scattered by the @xmath1zr target at small angles and at the corresponding energies with the fusion evaporation residues . it was found that the defocusing effect of the deflection voltage reduces the transmission from unity to 0.60@xmath140.06 .",
    "additional systematic errors come from the geometrical solid angle uncertainties , the angular distribution integrations , and the transmission measurements .",
    "altogether these contributions sum up to a @xmath14 15% value for systematic errors .",
    "the measured er excitation functions for the two systems are shown in fig .",
    "2 , where the energy scale is corrected for the target thickness . the statistical errors shown in the figure do not exceed the symbol size for most of the experimental points .",
    "they are @xmath14 0.8% for both the high - energy and the intermediate - energy points and increase to @xmath14 23% for the low - energy points .",

    "the data have been analyzed with both the ccfull code and the ntfus code based on a semi - classical coupled - channels model , which includes the sequential neutron transfers for @xmath0s+@xmath2zr as earlier proposed by zagrebaev .",
    "good agreement between experimental data and the calculation is achieved for @xmath0s+@xmath1zr by including the couplings to the low - lying quadruple and octupole vibrations in @xmath0s and @xmath1zr . whereas the ntfus calculations can reproduce the data by including four sequential neutron transfer channels as well as the low - lying quadrupole and octupole vibrations in @xmath0s and @xmath2zr .",
    "the comparison with previous data on @xmath3ca+@xmath2zr shows that the excitation functions of @xmath0s , @xmath3ca+@xmath2zr are very similar in the whole energy range .",
    "both systems have similar collective states and positive _ q_-value neutron transfer channels .",
    "this comparison strongly supports the previous suggestion @xcite that positive _ q_-value neutron transfer channels enhance sub - barrier fusion cross sections , particularly at very low energies .",
    "also the fusion and quasi - elastic barrier distributions of the @xmath0s+@xmath4zr systems are basically consistent in both cases .",
    "the two barrier distributions for @xmath0s+@xmath2zr can not be reproduced by ccfull code below 75 mev .",
    "the fact shows again the effect of the @xmath240 neutron transfers on the sub - barrier fusion process .",
    "in addition to the fusion excitation function , the neutron transfer cross section measurement for this system should provide useful information on the coupling strength of neutron transfer channels , which will allow us to reach a much deeper understanding of the role of neutron transfer mechanisms , sequential or simultaneous , in the fusion process .",
