    "the accurate acquisition of physical objects has numerous applications , especially in the entertainment industry .",
    "while there exist commercial systems for digitizing rigid objects , the acquisition of deforming objects remains a challenge due to the complex changes in geometry over time .",
    "a rigid object can be scanned sequentially from multiple viewpoints to accurately capture the complete surface , whereas scanning the entire surface of a deforming object would require a complex and expensive physical setup involving multiple synchronized sensors , which may still be subject to occlusions .",
    "recently , several techniques were proposed that solve this problem by using a template shape as a geometric and topological prior for the reconstruction and by deforming the template to fit to the observed data  @xcite . in some of these methods ,",
    "the observed data comes from a set of single - view scans .",
    "the single viewpoint assumption greatly simplifies the acquisition process .",
    "template - based tracking approaches are shown to lead to visually pleasing results for numerous examples .",
    "however , the deformation of the unobserved side of the object is generally only guided by a smoothness function .",
    "we combine a tracking - based approach with fitting a volumetric elastic model to improve the estimation of the unobserved side of the object .",
    "we employ a linear finite element method ( fem ) to solve for physical deformations when a given force is applied .",
    "our method proceeds in two steps : first , we use a tracking approach to deform the template model .",
    "second , we use the displacements of the observed vertices of the template mesh found using the tracking step in a fem to predict the displacements of the unobserved vertices . hence , rather than smoothly deforming the unobserved side of the model , we deform the unobserved side through the volumetric mesh of the fem model .",
    "we repeatedly linearize the deformation in the fem at its current deformation state .",
    "note that our method allows for tracking data acquired using single , multiple , or moving viewpoints .    while deformable models have been introduced to computer vision and computer graphics 30 years ago  @xcite ,",
    "here we combine modern non - rigid template - based tracking with a volumetric elastic model for completion of the deformation at the unobserved side only .",
    "our major contributions are therefore :    * the combination of a non - rigid template - based tracking approach with a linear finite element model to robustly track the complete geometry of an object whose deformation is captured from a single viewpoint only . * the use of a fem - based model to deform the unseen side leading to more physically plausible results than by using a smoothness cost in the template - based tracking . * tracking linear and non - linear deformations by repeatedly linearizing the fem model at its current deformation state .",
    "this paper presents the following three major improvements over the preliminary version of this work  @xcite .",
    "first , we present a computationally more efficient energy formulation to track the deformable object using a non - rigid iterative closest point framework .",
    "second , we propose an iterative method for the fem estimation that considers forces at supporting surfaces of the model",
    ". our method does not require the measurement of forces but estimates the forces up to a scale factor from the fem model and the deformation .",
    "third , we evaluate the performance of our method extensively using numerous synthetic and scanned data sequences and compare our results to our preliminary findings .",
    "special attention is paid to the influence of both synthetic and real scanner noise , as well as to the influence of the fem step on the result .",

    "lee et al .",
    "@xcite proposed a method to estimate material parameters and forces of tissue deformations based on two given frames of observations .",
    "this method , which is similar in spirit to our approach , assumes that for both frames , the segmented boundaries of the organ ( which are 3d surfaces ) are given .",
    "the approach proceeds by repeatedly simulating a deformation from the start frame for a set of material parameters and input forces , and by measuring the distance of the simulated deformation to the given target surface .",
    "the distance to the target surface is then used to improve the estimated material parameters and input forces using a gradient descent technique . unlike our method",
    ", this approach operates exclusively on a tetrahedral volumetric mesh and therefore has limited resolution .",
    "a more serious limitation of the approach is the need for good initial material parameters and force directions .",
    "while good initial estimates are known for many organic tissues , we do not have access to good initial estimates in our application .",
    "hence , our approach takes a different strategy to optimize the material parameters that does not require initial estimates .",
    "the input to our method consists of a closed template @xmath0 , a set of contact points on @xmath0 along with force directions that lead to the deformation of the model , and a set of observed 3d video frames ( point clouds ) @xmath1 capturing the deformation .",
    "we assume that the template has roughly the shape of the object before the deformation , and is approximately aligned to the first frame .",
    "the main idea of our approach is to combine tracking the observed point cloud data using a template deformation approach and predicting the deformation on the unobserved side of the model using a linear fem . to track the data",

    ", we use a down sampled version of @xmath0 that is tetrahedralized , which is denoted by @xmath4 in the following .",
    "let @xmath5 denote the deformed tetrahedral mesh . finally , we readjust the shape of the unobserved side of @xmath2 to take this displacement into account . when multiple frames are recorded , we start the tracking and fem deformation for frame @xmath6 from @xmath2 and @xmath5 , respectively . fig .",
    "[ fig_overview ] gives a visual overview of the proposed method .",
    "we use the following representation for the deformation of @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath7 denote the vertices of @xmath0 , @xmath8 denote their position vectors , and @xmath9 denote their homogeneous coordinates .",
    "furthermore , let @xmath10 denote the unit outer normal at @xmath7 . we deform @xmath0 by applying a @xmath11 transformation matrix @xmath12 to each @xmath9 of @xmath0 .",
    "the transformation matrix @xmath12 depends on six parameters : three parameters @xmath13 describing a translation , two parameters @xmath14 describing a unit rotation axis , and one parameter @xmath15 describing a rotation angle .",
    "that is , @xmath12 describes a rigid transformation as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a coordinate transformation that expresses a point in a coordinate frame centered at @xmath7 and @xmath18 is a coordinate transformation that expresses a point in a coordinate frame rotated by angle @xmath15 around axis @xmath14 . expressing",
    "the transformation in a coordinate system centered at @xmath7 has the advantage that differences between the transformations of neighboring vertices can be measured directly .",
    "this section presents our energy optimization approach to find the transformation parameters @xmath19 , and @xmath15 that lead to a mesh that is close to the point cloud data .",
    "we aim to deform the template @xmath0 to the observed data . when fitting @xmath0 to the first frame , we start by deforming @xmath0 using a global rigid transformation @xmath20 to fit the observed data as much as possible .",
    "we consider all vertices @xmath7 of @xmath0 and compute the nearest neighbor @xmath21 of the deformed point @xmath22 in the point cloud data .",
    "let @xmath23 denote the unit outer normal at @xmath21 in the point cloud .    to rigidly align @xmath0 to @xmath24 , we find @xmath20 by minimizing @xmath25 with respect to seven degrees of freedom ( one for scaling , three for rotation , three for translation ) , where @xmath26 is a weight term and @xmath27 denotes the scalar product .",
    "note that the term @xmath28 measures the distance of the transformed point @xmath22 to the supporting plane of its nearest data point @xmath21 , which leads to a faster convergence rate of the algorithm than using the distance from @xmath22 to @xmath21  @xcite .",
    "note that we fix the associated point @xmath29 of @xmath7 for this step to obtain a differentiable energy function .",
    "the scaling term accommodates slight errors in the calibration of the 3d scanner used to acquire the template shape and/or the calibration of the camera system used to acquire the frames .",
    "the weight @xmath26 is used to distinguish valid data observations from invalid ones , and should be one for vertices that have a valid data observation and zero for all other vertices . to exclude data points that are inconsistent with @xmath7 ,",
    "@xmath26 is set to zero if the distance between @xmath22 and @xmath21 is above @xmath30 or if the angle between @xmath10 and @xmath23 is above @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the average edge length of the undeformed template @xmath0 and @xmath33 and @xmath31 are parameters . setting all of the remaining @xmath26 to one has the problem that many vertices of @xmath0 that are close to the acquisition boundary of @xmath24 may pick the same nearest neighbor , which leads to poor assignments . to remedy this problem , we wish to set @xmath26 to zero if @xmath21 is located on the acquisition boundary of @xmath24 .",
    "it is not straight forward to define a `` boundary '' on a noisy point cloud .",
    "we use a heuristic that considers points @xmath34 of @xmath24 to be part of the boundary if many vertices of @xmath0 choose @xmath34 as nearest neighbor . to find the boundary points in a way that is independent to global resolution changes of both @xmath0 and @xmath24 , we count for each point of @xmath24 the number of vertices of @xmath0 that chose it as nearest neighbor and average this count over all points of @xmath24 that were chosen by at least one point of @xmath0 . a point of @xmath24",
    "is then considered a boundary point if its count exceeds twice the average count . in all remaining cases , @xmath26",
    "is set to one .",
    "to fit @xmath0 to any frame , we deform @xmath0 in a non - rigid fashion by changing @xmath19 , and @xmath15 to minimize the energy @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are weights for the individual energy terms , @xmath38 is the set of indices corresponding to points @xmath39 that have geodesic distance at most @xmath40 of @xmath41 , and @xmath42 denotes the cardinality of a set . as before , @xmath32 is the average edge length of @xmath0 and @xmath43 is a parameter .",
    "as above , @xmath26 is set to zero if the angle between @xmath10 and @xmath23 is above @xmath31 , if the distance between @xmath22 and @xmath21 is above @xmath30 , or if @xmath21 is a boundary point , and to one otherwise .",
    "the transformation matrices @xmath12 are computed according to equation  [ deformation_matrix ] .",
    "the data term @xmath44 drives the template mesh to the observed data .",
    "however , using only this term results in an ill - posed problem .",
    "we therefore add the smoothness term @xmath45 to act as a regularization term that encourages smooth transformations .",
    "unlike previously used regularization terms  @xcite that measure the difference between the transformations @xmath12 , @xmath45 measures the differences in translations and rotation angles in a local coordinate system centered at @xmath7 . to obtain results that are invariant under rigid transformations , it is important to initialize the transformation parameters in a way that is invariant to rigid transformations of the scene .",
    "initializing @xmath13 and @xmath15 to zero yields the initial identity transformation @xmath12 regardless of how @xmath14 is initialized .",
    "a natural rotation - invariant choice to initialize @xmath14 is @xmath10 .",
    "if @xmath45 were to depend on the difference in rotation axes with this initialization , @xmath45 would not be zero in the rest state .",
    "hence , the difference in @xmath14 does not increase @xmath45 .",
    "we found that in practice , @xmath45 helps to avoid self - intersections during the deformation , which is important as self - intersections might cause problems in the fem step .    to minimize @xmath46 , we start by encouraging smooth transformations by setting @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "similar to li et al .",
    "@xcite , whenever the energy does not change by much , we relax the smoothness weight as @xmath49 to give more weight to the data term .",
    "we stop when the relative change in energy + @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the iteration number , is less than @xmath52 or when @xmath37 is smaller than @xmath53 . to obtain a differentiable energy function",
    ", we do not update the associated point @xmath29 of @xmath7 for a fixed set of weights .",
    "that is , @xmath29 is updated every time the weight @xmath37 is changed .",
    "recall that the distance to the nearest neighbor used in @xmath44 is limited by the template resolution . to allow for larger deformations",
    ", we use a multi - resolution approach as follows .",
    "we compute a multi - resolution hierarchy of @xmath0 by collapsing edges of the mesh according to garland and heckbert s geometry criterion  @xcite .",
    "we do not collapse edges if this would lead to a self - intersecting mesh .",
    "we perform the test whether an edge collapse leads to self - intersections greedily by performing the collapse and testing if self - intersections occur . in each resolution step , we halve the number of vertices .",
    "we stop the collapse when the base mesh contains about 1000 vertices or when no more valid edges can be found for the edge collapse operation .",
    "once @xmath46 is minimized for resolution level @xmath54 , we consider the mesh of the next higher resolution level @xmath55 .",
    "for the vertices of level @xmath55 that are present in level @xmath54 , we initialize the transformation parameters to the result of the previous resolution . for the remaining vertices , @xmath14",
    "is initialized to @xmath10 , and @xmath13 and @xmath15 are found by minimizing @xmath45 with respect to the indices @xmath51 that are not present in resolution level @xmath54 .",
    "this multi - resolution framework works well when the geometric complexity is approximately linked to the amount of deformation .",
    "however , in cases where most of the deformation occurs in feature - less regions of the surface , some deformation detail may be lost by this multi - resolution framework .",
    "a possible remedy is to use a deformation graph to compute a multi - resolution framework  @xcite .",
    "while the solution yields a globally smooth deformation field by design , it is not guaranteed to give a deformation field that is locally smooth at every vertex @xmath7 . instead",
    ", it may happen that a single vertex is transformed by a significantly different deformation than its neighbors , thereby generating a new feature in the geometry .",
    "if this happens , we can optionally post - process the result as follows .",
    "for every vertex @xmath7 of @xmath0 , we consider the minimum of @xmath56 over all @xmath57 in the one - ring neighborhood of @xmath7 .",
    "if this minimum is larger than two , which means that the distance of @xmath7 to each of its neighbors has at least doubled during the deformation , we set the transformation parameters of @xmath7 to the average of the transformation parameters of the one - ring neighbors of @xmath7 .",
    "the average rotation axis is computed using spherical linear interpolation .    in our experiments",
    ", we observed that the post - processing step was usually only required because of the fem step in the previous frame .",
    "that is , the fem step caused some vertices @xmath7 to move relatively far from their neighbors when updating the unobserved side of the previous frame .",
    "this in turn led to a lack of smoothing as @xmath38 contained few points .",
    "a possible remedy to this problem is to use a more complex multi - resolution framework , as discussed above .",
    "we chose not to implement this solution , because in practice , we found that this post - processing was usually not crucial in most examples . in our experiments ,",
    "less than @xmath58 of the frames were influenced by this post - processing .",
    "our preliminary work used a data energy based on a point - to - point distance , a smoothness energy that varied depending on the differences in rotation axes , and an energy designed to discourage self - intersections by repelling close - by vertices that are not neighbors  @xcite . if we let @xmath59 denote the complexity to find @xmath21 , and assume @xmath38 to have constant complexity ( which holds for regularly sampled templates ) , a single evaluation of the energy used by wuhrer et al .",
    "has a complexity of @xmath60 for a template mesh with @xmath61 vertices as their energy requires the computation of all distances between pairs of vertices on the mesh .",
    "in contrast , evaluating @xmath46 has a complexity of @xmath62 .",
    "furthermore , it is known that using a point - to - plane distance instead of a point - to - point distance leads to faster convergence rates  @xcite .",
    "hence , we reduced the computational complexity of our method .",
    "furthermore , as will be shown in section  [ sec : results ] , using @xmath46 results in less self - intersections and higher data accuracy than using the energy by wuhrer et al .",
    "consider the situation after @xmath0 was deformed to frame @xmath3 using the approach outlined in the previous section , and denote the deformation of @xmath0 by @xmath2 .",

    "_ observed vertices _ , and we call the remaining vertices _",
    "unobserved vertices_. unobserved vertices were deformed using smoothness assumptions on the deformation field only .",
    "this section describes how to displace the unobserved vertices using a linear fem .",

    "we use @xmath63 with @xmath64 as start position for the fem step .",
    "a tetrahedral mesh is used to compute the fem .",
    "the initial tetrahedral mesh of @xmath0 is obtained by tetrahedralizing a simplified version of @xmath0 .",
    "this simplification is necessary to make the algorithm more time and space efficient .",
    "the tetrahedral mesh contains vertices on the surface of the model ( these vertices are a subset of the vertices of @xmath63 ) and vertices that are internal to the model . in the following ,",

    "let @xmath69 denote the vector of forces applied to the vertices of the tetrahedral mesh and let @xmath70 denote the vector of displacements of the vertices of the tetrahedral mesh . both @xmath69 and @xmath70 have dimension @xmath71 , where @xmath61 is the number of vertices of the tetrahedral mesh .",
    "furthermore , let @xmath72 and @xmath73 denote the force and displacement vectors of vertex @xmath51 .",

    "however , due to numerical instabilities when using a single tetrahedron , in practice , redundant observations are commonly used to estimate the material parameters . *",

    "if for each vertex with non - fixed displacement either the force or the displacement are provided , we can compute the missing displacements and force vectors by rearranging the linear system of equations  @xcite .",
    "we rely on forces in addition to displacements in the estimation of unobserved vertices because overspecified boundary conditions are required to estimate material parameters .",
    "note that this simple linear fem is only suitable to model small deformations , as large rotations may cause artifacts .",
    "however , this problem does not occur in our case as we linearize the deformation locally at each frame by modeling deformations between consecutive frames , which ensures that only small deformations are considered .",
    "because of using the deformed tetrahedral template from the previous tracking frame as the rest state , the material parameters estimated by our method are not expected to be physically meaningful .",
    "it is easy to see that we do not have enough constraints to use equation  [ fem_equation ] directly to solve for all missing information . from the tracking step , we computed displacements @xmath73 for all surface vertices , but not for the internal vertices .",
    "these displacements are reliable for observed vertices only , and we aim to use the fem model to find reliable displacements for the unobserved ones .",
    "furthermore , we are given the direction of the force at the contact point .",
    "note that we can normalize the length of the force direction at the contact point , since changing the length of @xmath69 only scales @xmath67 ( see e.g. becker and teschner  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* equation 17 ) ) .",
    "the forces @xmath72 at internal vertices can be assumed to be zero as no external forces can act on the interior of the model .",
    "note that other contact surfaces of the model , such as the table the model rests on , are not modeled explicitly in our framework . instead , we rely on the observed surface points to model these additional constraints .",
    "this leaves us with the following unknown or unreliable quantities : @xmath67 , @xmath68 , the displacements at internal and unobserved vertices , and the forces at surface vertices that are not contact points .",
    "prior work assumed all forces to be zero , solved for @xmath67 and @xmath68 by only considering the points with known displacements and forces , and used the estimated @xmath67 and @xmath68 to solve for the displacements of unobserved vertices  @xcite .",

    "hence we did not adopt this approach .",
    "we propose an iterative method to find reliable displacements at unobserved vertices and demonstrate in section  [ sec : results ] that this change leads to an improvement of the tracking results .",

    "however , by combining template - based tracking with simple physical simulation models , we make a first step in the direction of acquiring the geometry and material properties of an object jointly .    we have demonstrated that our method , which uses a linear fem model , allows to track both linear and non - linear material deformations accurately .",

    "we leave the following ideas for future work .",
    "the tracking is lost when the distance between consecutive frames is large .",
    "this could potentially be addressed by tracking feature points on the model and by using these features to guide the non - rigid motion of the template during tracking .",
    "furthermore , our approach assumes that a template is known a priori .",
    "while this assumption is commonly used in 3d tracking approaches , it will be interesting to relax this requirement in the future .",
    "one way to relax this requirement would be to assume that the undeformed object is observed from a single moving viewpoint before the deformation , which allows to fuse these views into a template shape automatically .",
