    "the rise of two - dimensional materials and a subsequent avalanche of studies @xcite have led to significant advances in theory and experiments . with this , the dirac equation has found happy applications in electronic transport @xcite , photonic structures @xcite and recently , ultracold matter in optical lattices @xcite .",
    "the crossover between crystalline structures and relativistic quantum mechanics compells us to analyze these systems from different angles . in this paper",
    "we are interested in discrete symmetries , whose implications in elementary particle physics have been clearly established and  in the frontiers of our knowledge  occasionally tested @xcite .",
    "our tasks imply a revision of dimensionality and its consequences .",
    "the @xmath1 dimensional dirac equation shares many features with the usual @xmath0 dimensional case , but there are also differences that manifest themselves in discrete transformations and the nature of chiral symmetries . in a more general framework , we should point out that nearest - neighbor tight - binding models allow exact solutions , and that their formulation goes beyond the dirac approximation . therefore , this is an excellent opportunity to discuss discrete symmetries in a more general setting . as a bonus , we shall see that a symmetry breaking analogous to cpt violation may occur beyond effective dirac theories .",
    "we present our discussion in the following order : in section ii we provide the concepts that explain the appearence of discrete transformations as members of the lorentz group .",
    "we also review the origin of the dirac equation and show how its spinorial dimensionality is related to space - time dimensionality . in section iii we focus on parity , analyzing both @xmath0 and @xmath1 dimensional cases . section iv is devoted to effective dirac theories ; in this section we study the effects of parity on hexagonal lattices and suggest a symmetry breaking of full tight - binding models .",
    "we conclude in section v.",

    "the role of discrete symmetries in both particle physics and condensed matter systems should not be underestimated . in this paper",
    "we have reviewed the subject at the level of the dirac equation in first quantization .",
    "it is important to mention that a frequent approach to symmetries in quantum field theory comes from the invariance of the action that generates the euler - lagrange equations , including the dirac equation .",
    "invariance of the action leads indeed to invariance of the theory , but the converse is not necessarily true ; the subtleties of this and other properties arising in a second - quantized scheme have been left aside for the sake of a simple treatment .",
    "we encourage our readers with particle physics inclinations to consult references @xcite with respect to state - of - the - art cpt invariance tests .    as to the honeycomb lattice , there is a clear message arising from our results : lattice deformations and long range interactions constitute a source of asymmetry that can be used to our favor as a testbed for new effects .",
    "however , we must warn the reader that the validity of conical approximations in graphene has been experimentally established for energies in the vicinity of the band center .",
    "thus , the effects arising due to a full - band theory may be visible in other honeycomb realizations .",
    "the so - called artificial graphene @xcite is worthy of attention .",
