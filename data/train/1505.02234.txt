    "the advances of organic field - effect devices in recent years have inspired renewed research interest in the charge transport problems in organic semiconducting crystals.@xcite recent studies focus on the intrinsic regime of charge transport , featured by observation of both band - like and hopping - like properties in the same device under different operating conditions.@xcite besides , the underlying electronic states are proved to be localized both theoretically@xcite and experimentally .",
    "@xcite it is realized that the coupling between carriers , which is denoted as electrons for simplicity throughout the paper , and lattice vibrations ( phonons ) plays an essential role in the charge transport process .",
    "further , in many cases , the energy scales of the electron - phonon coupling , temperature and intermolecular transfer integral overlap , which renders the problem in the intermediated parameter regime , where the traditional pictures may not be effective.@xcite for example , troisi and orlandi proposed that the carriers in such materials are no longer localized by the self - trapping mechanism in polaron problems.@xcite rather , it is due to dynamic disorder brought by phonons at finite temperature .",
    "many theoretical works have been contributed to this topic.@xcite among them , the series of studies using quantum - classical dynamics , which treat the electronic system quantum - mechanically and the phonons classically , are promising ones .",
    "@xcite they offer a time - dependent view of the transport process , enabling the calculation of quantities such as the transient conductivity .",
    "@xcite computationally , they are more efficient than the full quantum - mechanical methods and are convenient to be tuned for realistic materials . for example , the detailed crystal and electronic structures extracted by experiments and first - principle calculations can be input as model parameters for multi - scale simulations.@xcite besides , existing studies on chemical dynamics provide valuable resources for the improvement of those methods . for example , wang et al .",
    "successfully generalized the surface hopping approach to such systems,@xcite revealing an interesting crossover between band - like and hopping behavior .    despite the successes of the quantum - classical dynamics ,",
    "there are still some inconsistencies in the resulting carrier dynamics .",
    "for example , in the pioneering work of troisi et al . by ehrenfest dynamics,@xcite",
    "the form of evolution of the electronic system is quantum - mechanically coherent .",
    "the electron wave functions keep expanding without a well - defined localization length , which does not coincide with experimental findings.@xcite .",
    "this could be ascribed to the lack of explicit treatment of decoherence.@xcite in the charge transport process , the electronic system ( electron ) can be seen as the central system . in realistic situations",
    ", it would interact with many other species ( environment ) , especially the dominant phonon degrees of freedom that are treated classically here .",
    "together , they form a system - environment architecture .",
    "one direct consequence for the system from coupling with environment is the destruction of phase coherence within the system , _",
    "i.e. _ , decoherence,@xcite which is essential for the consistency of quantum - classical dynamics.@xcite the incorporation of decoherence is indicated or proposed in several further studies .",
    "fratini et al . introduced a relaxation time approximation , in which the information of initial dynamics are used and the long - time dynamics are corrected.@xcite yao et al . introduced the instantaneous decoherence correction ( idc ) by measurement - like operations in the lattice site representation , through which band - like temperature dependence of mobility and localized electronic states coexist.@xcite also , in the surface hopping studies of wang et al .",
    ", decoherence corrections are included by collapsing the electronic states to the active states at the surface hopping events .",
    "@xcite    besides decoherence , another prominent process due to the system - environment coupling is the energy relaxation ( dissipation),@xcite by which the system absorbs / dissipates energy from / to the environment and relaxes to the thermal equilibrium with the environmental temperature.@xcite this process is essential for the interpretation of transient experiments , such as the pump - probe ones.@xcite however , there are signs that it is not treated properly in some forms of quantum - classical dynamics . for example , if the effect of phonon motion is taken to be a stochastic potential for the electronic system , all the adiabatic states tend to be populated with equal probability in the long time limit.@xcite this means the effective temperature of the electronic system is infinitely large .",
    "thus these methods are rigourous only when the thermal energy is much larger than the bandwidth . in the ehrenfest dynamics",
    "the electronic system could influence the phonons by the mean - field hellmann - feynman force .",
    "however , it does not prevent the electronic system to deviate from the near - equilibrium distribution in the diffusion dynamics,@xcite which is also shown in the following . besides , in the study using kubo formalism with adiabatic approximation , the dc conductivity turns out to be zero.@xcite the surface hopping approach is promising in treating the energy relaxation through the frustrated hops in the switching procedure.@xcite however",
    ", these hops also lead to inconsistency problems , the solution of which is under active studies.@xcite thus the problem of properly accounting for both decoherence and energy relaxation in the quantum - classical dynamics of the dynamic disordered systems remains an open question .    in this paper , we extend the idc approach @xcite to the adiabatic representation to investigate the decoherence and energy relaxation processes .",
    "similar approaches have been employed to the study of spin dynamics of excited states@xcite and carrier dynamics of the anderson model.@xcite the evolution of the system in short time regime ( comparable to the phonon frequency ) are governed by the quantum - classical dynamics .",
    "the long time dynamics , which is recognized to be problematic,@xcite are modified by decoherence corrections .",
    "the idc are carried out by measurement - like operations with different schemes . for energy relaxation ,",
    "the detailed balance is considered by introducing the idc with energy - dependent reweighing factors , such as the boltzmann ( idc - bm ) and the miller - abrahams ( idc - ma ) factors .",
    "the idc with only destruction of phase coherence ( idc - dp ) is also studied for comparison .",
    "based on the off - diagonal electron - phonon coupling model , the physical consequences of the idc approach are explored .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , the model and the idc approach are presented in detail . in section iii ,",
    "the results of the idc are shown , including both diffusion and electronic energy .",
    "the paper is summarized briefly in section iv .",
    "in this section , we first present the off - diagonal electron - phonon coupling model and the equations of motion .",
    "we then move on to introduce the idc approach with a couple of schemes for energy relaxation , including that with boltzmann and miller - abrahams factors .",

    "the hamiltonian for the phonons is @xmath8,\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the effective mass of the phonon and @xmath10 is the frequency .",
    "the electron state is described by the wave function @xmath11 that is governed by the schrdinger equation , which is @xmath12 the electronic system back - reacts on the phonons through the mean - field hellmann - feynman force .",
    "the langevin heat bath is included to account for the fluctuations of the phonons due to the thermal environment .",
    "the equations of motion for the phonons is @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the expectation value of energy at time @xmath15 , @xmath16 the friction constant of the langevin heat bath and @xmath17 the stochastic forces . @xmath17",
    "satisfy the correlation function @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath20 is the temperature .",
    "the initial displacements @xmath21 and velocities @xmath22 are drawn from the maxwell distributions with variance @xmath23 and @xmath24 respectively .",
    "the initial state of the electron is chosen among the adiabatic states ( energy eigenstates ) at @xmath25 according to the boltzmann distribution @xmath26 .",
    "the evolution is carried out by the @xmath27th order runge - kutta method and the stochastic forces are incorporated by the method of wang et al.@xcite the final result is averaged over enough realizations for the convergence of relevant physical quantities .",
    "we now move on to describe the instantaneous decoherence corrections ( idc ) , which is carried out by repeated measurement - like operations on the electronic wave function in the adiabatic representation.@xcite a decoherence time @xmath28 is introduced as the time interval between successive idc .",
    "it reflects the decoherence rate due to the system - environment interaction .",
    "this approach is shown to be effective to incorporate decoherence in the dynamics.@xcite although discrete , it is shown in the site representation that the results resemble those by actually adding an attenuation term in the equation of motion of the non - diagonal elements of the density matrix.@xcite for the following results , a fixed @xmath28 is used for convenience .",
    "actually , more elaborate forms for @xmath28 can be taken to reflect the situation in realistic materials .",
    "for example , proper distributions , such as the poisson distribution,@xcite can be used , together with specific models to determine @xmath28 from other parameters.@xcite    in detail , the dynamics are sliced into segments of time period @xmath28 . within each @xmath28 , the carrier and phonons",
    "are evolved by the quantum - classical dynamics .",
    "after each @xmath28 , a measurement - like operation is carried out for the electronic system by collapsing the electron state to a certain adiabatic state according to a chosen distribution , which can be set by different schemes .",
    "suppose the adiabatic states are denoted as @xmath29 with energy @xmath30 and the distribution is @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the index .",
    "a random number @xmath33 is chosen uniformly in @xmath34 .",

    "this scheme removes the phase relation among adiabatic states and is termed as the idc with destruction of phase coherence ( idc - dp ) .",
    "however , as is shown below , this scheme only includes decoherence and energy relaxation is still not properly treated .      for the purpose of energy relaxation in the idc , we consider the detailed balance through the introduction of energy - dependent reweighing factors .",
    "we propose a couple of schemes in this work .",
    "the first one is to implement a boltzmann factor , which is @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the normalization factor .",
    "this scheme could reflect the ability of the environment to recover the thermal distribution for the electronic system and is denoted as the idc - bm in the following .",
    "it is motivated by einstein s theory of spontaneous emission of excited states,@xcite which is the result of quantum fluctuations of radiation fields .",
    "further , motivated by the miller - abrahams formula,@xcite an alternative scheme is implemented .",
    "if the measurement is to collapse the state to an adiabatic state with higher energy , the probability is reduced by a factor from actually absorbing the energy from the environment . in this sense ,",
    "the distribution is @xmath40/c_{\\text{ma } } , & e_{\\mu}>\\bar{e } , \\\\",
    "p_{\\mu}/c_{\\text{ma } } , & e_{\\mu}\\leq\\bar{e } , \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] where @xmath41 is a normalization constant .",
    "this scheme is termed as the idc - ma in the following .",
    "similar expressions are widely used for the hopping rates in the simulation of charge transport in amorphous organic semiconductors.@xcite they are shown to capture the transient mobility behavior@xcite and charge extraction transients in organic solar cells,@xcite which depend on the correct treatment of energy relaxation .",
    "it is noted that with the idc , the electronic states remain fairly localized .",
    "it is not necessary to solve the hamiltonian of the whole lattice and a specific region is chosen instead , within which the electronic state is populated , which is more efficient .",
    "the region is determined as follows .",
    "the index of the left / right boundary of the region is denoted as @xmath42 .",
    "the quantity @xmath43 is calculated and is ensured to be smaller than a critical value . otherwise the region should be expanded .",
    "actually , @xmath44 reflect the expectation value of populations on the boundary sites after the decoherence correction . in the following calculations ,",
    "the critical value is chosen to be @xmath45 , which is small enough to not influence the final result .",
    "for the following results , the parameters are taken to be typical for pentacene.@xcite the transfer integral @xmath2 is @xmath46v , the electron - phonon coupling constant @xmath47 @xmath48 , the phonon frequency @xmath49 ps@xmath48 , the phonon effective mass @xmath50 amu ; the lattice constant @xmath51  ; the temperature @xmath52 k. the friction constant @xmath16 is taken to be @xmath53 ps@xmath48 .",

    "the prominent effect of the idc in adiabatic representation is that the diffusion is enhanced , in contrast to the suppression of diffusion with the idc in site representation,@xcite which is a result of the quantum zeno effect.@xcite the enhancement is reduced by inclusion of energy relaxation with the idc - bm and idc - ma schemes . for comparison ,",
    "the results after averaging over 10 and 100 realizations with the idc - bm are also shown .",
    "it can be seen that with 100 realizations , the result is already close to the final one .",
    "the enhancement of diffusion originates from the way the electron diffuses in the quantum - classical dynamics .",
    "take the idc - dp as an example .",
    "the average population on the @xmath5-th site before the decoherence correction is @xmath67 the decoherence correction destroys the phase coherence between different adiabatic states and the corresponding population after the decoherence correction is @xmath68 comparing with @xmath69 , the missing terms in @xmath70 are the interference ones between adiabatic states . in the ehrenfest dynamics , the wave function starts to change by the mixing of adiabatic states due to phonon motion . if the wave function is expanded in the evolved adiabatic states , the interference terms tend to be constructive for those sites that are initially populated and destructive for those sites that are initially unpopulated . with further evolution , this kind of phase relation is disrupted by the stochastic phonon motion and population emerges on those initially unpopulated sites .",
    "the idc helps this process and thus enhances diffusion .",
    "a specific example of this enhancement is shown in the supplementary material .",

    "besides , the diffusion constants with the idc show sharper dependence on temperature . beyond @xmath72",
    "k , they begin to deviate from a power - law behavior . this can be related to the corresponding deviation of the localization length of adiabatic states .",
    "the temperature dependence of the averaged localization length is provided in the supplementary material.@xcite      we now turn our attention to the electronic energy @xmath73 for the energy relaxation process .",

    "an initial small decrease away from zero is observed , which persists beyond @xmath65 ps .",
    "the small deviation is caused by the polaron effect due to the hellmann - feynman force , which is a feedback from the electronic system to the phonons .",
    "it is confirmed by the evolution of averaged displacements and phonon potential energies that are shown in the supplementary material.@xcite these results show that the near - equilibrium boltzmann distribution is violated in the ehrenfest dynamics .",
    "all the adiabatic states tend to be populated with equal probability , which corresponds to a large effective temperature .",

    "<S> we explore an instantaneous decoherence correction ( idc ) approach for the decoherence and energy relaxation in the quantum - classical dynamics of charge transport in organic semiconducting crystals . </S>",
    "<S> these effects , originating from environmental fluctuations , are essential ingredients of the carrier dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> the idc is carried out by measurement - like operations in the adiabatic representation . </S>",
    "<S> while decoherence is inherent in the idc , energy relaxation is taken into account by considering the detailed balance through the introduction of energy - dependent reweighing factors , which could be either boltzmann ( idc - bm ) or miller - abrahams ( idc - ma ) type . for a non - diagonal electron - phonon coupling model </S>",
    "<S> , it is shown that the idc tends to enhance diffusion while energy relaxation weakens this enhancement . as expected , both </S>",
    "<S> the idc - bm and idc - ma achieve a near - equilibrium distribution at finite temperatures in the diffusion process , while the ehrenfest dynamics renders system tending to infinite temperature limit . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting energy relaxation times with the two kinds of factors lie in different regimes and exhibit different dependence on temperature , decoherence time and electron - phonon coupling strength , due to different dominant relaxation process . </S>"
