    "starburst galaxy mergers involve highly dissipative collapse of tremendous amounts of molecular gas from their location in two separate galaxies , into the inner few 100 pc of the merged system .",
    "the high gas densities in the core of the merger prompt powerful star formation ; the dust associated with the gas absorbs the uv / optical light and re - radiates in the far - ir , resulting in an ultraluminous infrared galaxy ( ulig ) .    in most uligs , merging is sufficiently advanced that the gas has mostly collapsed into the central a few 100 pc .",
    "notable examples are the nearest uligs like arp  220 ( downes & solomon 1998 ( ds98 ) ; sakamoto et al .",
    "there are , however , a few very highly luminous galaxies with extranuclear star forming regions ( just below the @xmath2 ulig cutoff ) where the gas has apparently not yet collapsed into the nuclei ( e.g. , arp  299 aalto et al . 1997 ; casoli et al . 1999 ; vv  114 yun et al . 1994 ) .",
    "these systems are of crucial importantance as they give us a glimpse into the ( apparently brief ) intermediate stage between well - separated gas - rich pairs and the merged late - stage uligs .",
    "ii  zw  96 ( @xmath3 , nuclear separation @xmath4 kpc ) , shows four distinct star - forming regions , as revealed by optical and near - ir observations ( goldader et al .",
    "1997 ( g97 ) ) .",
    "two of those are apparently associated with galaxy nuclei .",
    "the other two sources lie well away from the two nuclei , extremely weak in optical , but prominent in near - ir , implying heavy dust obscuration in these extra - disk star forming regions .",
    "in order to explore the extra - disk star forming regions heavily obscured by dust , we have observed ii  zw  96 at co(1 - 0 ) using the 10-element bima array at hat creek , california .",
    "the data presented here are mainly compact c and d array observations plus some limited long baseline b array observations .",
    "the combined data give a synthesized beam of @xmath5 ( @xmath6 kpc ) .",
    "additional b array observations at @xmath7 resolution are being conducted currently to further improve the resolution .",
    "a total h@xmath8 mass of @xmath9 ( standard conversion ) was estimated from a single - dish co survey ( gao  & solomon 1999 ) .",
    "our bima observations have recovered most of the single - dish flux and revealed that ii  zw  96 is a morphologically complex and extraordinary system with most of co emission located outside the two merging stellar disks ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "the dominant co concentrations correspond to the two extra - disk star - forming regions hidden by heavy dust , whereas the others are associated with the two galaxy disks and the region between them .",
    "the huge co concentrations far away from the galaxy disks account for more than @xmath10 of the total co emission with a h@xmath8 mass of @xmath11 .",
    "huge concentrations of molecular gas in the overlap regions have been observed already in merger systems like arp  299 and the `` antennae '' galaxies arp  244 .",
    "the enormous amount of molecular gas located far away from merging disks makes ii  zw  96 quite unique .",
    "moreover , the gas density of @xmath12 ( as seen by a beam resolution of @xmath13 kpc ) at the peak of the concentrations , although at least @xmath14 higher than either nuclear regions of the merging galaxies , is orders of magnitude less than that of uligs and even arp  299 .",
    "the peak gas surface density would still be several times less than that of uligs even if the entire co emission covered by current larger synthesized beam is from the central @xmath15 kpc region .",
    "in addition , the extra - disk gas concentrations appear to be peaked with a small offset from the star forming knots identified in near - ir ( fig .  1 ) and are mostly at higher velocities ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "only a small amount of molecular gas has been observed in se galaxy which appears to have little association with the extra - disk gas concentrations ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "nw galaxy has a rather extended gas distribution , gas rotation motion and connection of the disk gas with the extra - disk co concentration , whereas much less gas is observed in the se disk .",
    "it is difficult to speculate that most of the gas in the extra - disk concentrations could have come from the nw galaxy .",
    "could the se galaxy have been originally very gas - rich with extended gas disk and left most of the gas behind after colliding with the nw galaxy ?",
    "the star forming knots seen in near - ir in the extra - disk gas concentrations show properties of the hii regions as that of the se nuclear region indicating powerful young starbursts ( g97 ) .",
    "these same spectral features are also found in arp  299 and vv  114 . in all these systems ,",
    "the apparent ages of the starbursts are @xmath16830 myr , much younger than the allowed range of uligs .",
    "in fact , goldader et al . (",
    "g97 ) suggested that these three systems might be examples of a short - lived phase through which many ",
    "pass on their way to becoming more advanced , centrally concentrated ulig mergers .",
    "because the hi disks are more extended than the stellar disks , they may merge first prior to the merging of the stellar and molecular gas disks when a pair of gas - rich spirals approach each other .",
    "indeed , we may have seen such early merging and formation of the hi disks overlap region in ngc  6670 where huge concentration of hi has been observed between the two galaxies whose hi disks have been highly disrupted , whereas little distortion is observed in the stellar disks ( wang et al .",
    "one plausible idea is that the hi gas disk overlap regions formed much earlier in early mergers ( ngc  6670 ) may be the progenitors of the apparent overlap regions in intermediate mergers ( arp  244 ) , which may evolve into the extended gas disks around the much more concentrated double nuclear gas disks in uligs ( arp  220 , ds98 ) . ii  zw  96 fits in between early mergers like ngc  6670 and intermediate mergers like arp  244 .    as merging progresses and",
    "the gas overlap region further concentrates , these huge co concentrations will eventually merge with the double nuclear gas disks .",
    "they could thus , be the progenitors of the so called _ extreme starburst _ regions , which dominate the overall starburst power output of the entire system , yet be confined within sub - kpc scale ( ds98 ) .",
    "they may also appear to be the multiple `` nuclei '' claimed in some uligs ( cf .",
    "borne et al .",
    "although there are now several galaxy mergers where huge gas concentrations in the overlap regions  the `` interaction zones '' have been observed , ii  zw  96 appears to be the only one with most of the gas concentrations ( presumably the overlap regions ) located outside the stellar merging disks . is this unique  ?",
    "are there more such systems to be found , especially in the distant universe where galaxy collisions are expected to be much more frequent  ?",
    "perhaps , one should not be totally surprised when alma has mapped some huge molecular gas concentrations with little or no optical correspondences , or the peaks of the molecular gas concentrations offset from the optical peaks by several kpc , in merging / star - forming galaxies at high redshift .",
