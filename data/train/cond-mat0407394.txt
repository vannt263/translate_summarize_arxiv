    "unfortunately however , for quasi 1d materials this is still an open issue .",
    "it is the aim of this work to investigate the phonon spectra of a 1d model of mixed orbital and spin degrees of freedom by investigating its harmonic lattice dynamics in the vicinity of two specifically chosen jahn - teller ( jt ) distortions .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "i we discuss the 1d spin - orbital hamiltonian and its excitations using a bond - operator method close to the so - called dimer line .",
    "sections ii and iii will focus on the phonon - spectra which form in the presence of a frozen - in , either ferro- or antiferro - orbital jt distortions .",
    "conclusions will be presented in the final section iv .",
    "technical details are deferred to appendices a through d.",
    "in this section , and prior to discussing their effect on the lattice dynamics we develop a description of the orbital and spin excitations . in the limit of strong coulomb repulsion , orbital degeneracy in the hubbard model",
    "can be described in terms of a pseudo - spin model , as was shown several decades ago by kugel and khomskii@xcite . in 1d and for a two - fold orbital degeneracy at 1/4-filling",
    "this leads to the hamiltonian of a magnetic spin-1/2 chain coupled to an orbital pseudo - spin-1/2 chain by bi - quadratic interactions @xmath4 where , apart from the spin-@xmath5 operator @xmath6 , a pseudo spin-@xmath5 variable @xmath7 with @xmath8 corresponding to the orbital degrees of freedom is attached to each site @xmath9. summation over the spin indices @xmath10 and @xmath11 is implied . in the remainder of this paper energies will be given in units of @xmath12 .",

    "point @xmath14=@xmath15=3/4 this ground state can be expressed as a direct matrix - product of alternating spin and orbital singlets with an energy gap of @xmath20@xcite .",
    "exactly on the dimer line the elementary excitations are massive solitons , i.e. domain walls between the two - fold degenerate ground - states . however , off from the dimer - line the latter readily bind to form generalized gapful triplet - modes@xcite .",
    "prior to including the effects of a jt - distortion we now reformulate ( [ kkchain ] ) in terms of bosonic bond - operators@xcite .",
    "this allows for an approximate description of the formation of the spin and orbital singlets in the ground state of the dimer phase @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 create / destroy spin(orbital ) singlets and triplets and the index @xmath24 labels the left ( right ) site of the dimer @xmath9 in fig .",

    "an interacting bose gas is obtained . in the limit of strong dimerization",
    "one may proceed with the latter by invoking the holstein - primakoff ( lhp ) approximation@xcite .",
    "i.e. the singlets are removed using ( [ constr ] ) and assuming @xmath26 and @xmath27 to be @xmath28-numbers .",
    "this is consistent with a condensation of the singlets in the ground state , i.e. the formation of a dimer state .",

    "<S> we study the interplay of spin , orbital and lattice degrees of freedom in a one - dimensional kugel - khomskii model coupled to phonons . in the vicinity of the dimer point </S>",
    "<S> we analyze the excitation spectrum , mapping the spin and orbital degrees of freedom to bond operators . </S>",
    "<S> in particular we study the renormalization of the phonon propagator due to coupling to the orbital and magnetic excitations . considering both , ferro- and antiferro - orbital ordering </S>",
    "<S> we will show that the appearance of orbiton shake - up processes in the phonon spectrum is sensitive to the type of jahn - teller distortion . </S>",
    "<S> the relevance of our results for optical spectroscopy on low dimensional transition metal compounds will be discussed . </S>"
