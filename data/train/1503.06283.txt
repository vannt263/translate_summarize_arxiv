    "in heavy ion collisions , the pattern of variation of net baryon density ( @xmath1 ) in rapidity space is found to vary with beam energy .",
    "for example , for sis18/ags energies , the variation of net baryon density with rapidity is found to be of gaussian shape with its peak at mid - rapidity @xcite whereas at rhic / lhc energies , such variation of ( @xmath1 ) shows bimodality with a minimum at mid - rapidity @xcite .",
    "it is therefore easily comprehensible that the rapidity distribution of a particle , the production of which is sensitive to net baryon density , or otherwise , the particles containing leading quarks ( such as @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) , might tend to follow the net baryon density . the rapidity dependence of other particles whose none of the constituents are @xmath5 or @xmath6 quarks might not exhibit any such dependencies on net baryon density .",
    "our earlier work @xcite on variation of width of the rapidity distribution of various produced particles on beam rapidity , with special reference to @xmath3 and anti @xmath3 has vindicated such prediction .",
    "it may therefore be not completely out of context to believe that a number of other kinematic and dynamical properties of heavy ion collision might get coupled with this net baryon density effect .",
    "strange particles are produced only at the time of collisions and thus expected to carry important information of collision dynamics .",
    "strangeness enhancement is considered to be one of the traditional signatures @xcite of formation of quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) . due to the limitation of the detector acceptance ,",
    "the past and ongoing heavy ion experiments could measure the strangeness enhancement at midrapidity only .",
    "all such measurements assume a global conservation of strangeness . however , steinheimer et al .",
    "@xcite from urqmd calculation predicted that strangeness is not uniformly distributed over rapidity space leading to a local violation of strangeness conservation .",
    "thus , the study of rapidity dependent strangeness enhancement is of considerable significance .",
    "considering the fact that with the large acceptance upcoming fair - cbm detector @xcite measurement of the rapidity dependent strangeness enhancement factor @xmath7 could be a possibility , strangeness enhancement factor at different rapidity bin has been estimated for various identified particles produced in @xmath0 collisions at 30__a _ _ gev using a string based hadronic transport model urqmd-3.3 ( ultra relativistic quantum molecular dynamics ) .",
    "a sum of 93 million minimum biased urqmd events has been used for the present analysis .",
    "ultra relativistic quantum molecular dynamics ( urqmd ) @xcite is a microscopic model based on a phase space description of @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 collisions that remains successful in describing the observables of heavy ion collisions over an energy range @xmath11 = 100 amev to @xmath12 = 200 gev @xcite . at low and intermediate energies ( @xmath13 5 gev ) , it describes the phenomenology of heavy ion collisions in terms of interactions between known hadrons and their resonances . at higher energies ( @xmath14 5 gev ) , the excitation of color strings and their subsequent fragmentation into hadrons are taken into account . in this",
    "model , strange hadrons in heavy ion collision may either be produced in the very early stage in the initial collisions among the incoming nucleons or in the later stage through secondary collisions among the produced particles @xcite . in low energy domain",
    "i.e. , close to threshold energy , strangeness can either be produced in nn reaction channel directly e.g. @xmath15 or in two steps reactions such as @xmath16 and finally @xmath17 . at higher incident",
    "beam energies , particle production in general is dominated by string excitation and fragmentation @xcite .",
    "other than string excitation and fragmentation , the multi - strange hyperons like @xmath18(sss ) can also be produced via @xmath19 channel .",
    "strangeness enhancement factor @xmath20 is quantified by measuring the ratio of yield of strange particles in @xmath10 collision and respective yield in @xmath8 collisions , where both the numerator and denominator are normalized by the number of participants ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "the conventional definition of strangeness enhancement factor is @xcite ",
    "@xmath22    in this report , using reference @xcite , alternative definition of strangeness enhancement factor @xmath20 is used where @xmath20 is defined as -    @xmath23 _ { central}/ \\left[\\frac{(yield)_{aa}}{\\langle n_{\\pi^-}\\rangle}\\right ] _ { peripheral }     \\label{r}\\ ] ]    the reason for taking the average number of produced pions @xmath24 , instead of @xmath25 , as a measure of centrality variable is described elsewhere @xcite .",
    "[ tb ]     [ tb ]      the strangeness enhancement factor ( @xmath20 ) has been calculated and plotted as a function of rapidity for various identified particles for @xmath0 collision at 30__a _ _ gev and is shown in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "we choose @xmath0 collision at 30__a _ _ gev for the present study as the baryon density is reported to be maximum at this energy @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to see from the figure that @xmath20 depends strongly on rapidity and this dependence follow two distinctive patterns . while the enhancement factor at mid - rapidity is found to be maximum for the particles containing leading quarks ( filled circle ) , the same is observed to be minimum at mid - rapidity for the particles containing produced quarks only ( open circle ) . however , even though a rise and fall pattern is also visible for @xmath26 , consisting of three produced quarks only ( sss ) , the existence of a slight dip at mid - rapidity can not be ruled out and is consistent with the general trend .    to understand the underlying dynamics of such rapidity dependent strangeness enhancement , the normalized rapidity distributions ( fig.[fig2 ] ) as well as the width of the rapidity distribution as a function of centrality ( fig.[fig3 ] ) are plotted for various produced particles .",
    "it is readily evident from fig.[fig2 ] and fig.[fig3 ] that the different patterns of rapidity dependence of strangeness enhancement factor for particles containing and not containing leading quarks lie on the dependence of rapidity distribution or otherwise the variation of the width of the rapidity distribution on centrality .",
    "the width of the rapidity distribution increases as we go from central to peripheral collisions for the particles containing leading quarks , a feature that might be attributed to the variation of net - baryon density with impact parameter at the studied energy . in fig.[fig4 ] , we therefore plot the rapidity distribution of net - baryon number for different centrality for the studied @xmath0 collision at 30__a _ _ gev .",
    "it is seen from this figure that as we go from central to peripheral collision , the width of the rapidity distribution of net - baryon number increases upto a certain impact parameter . as the impact parameter",
    "is further increased , as expected , the net - baryon number tends to populate the extreme rapidity spaces due to small overlap of the colliding partners .",
    "this increase in the population of baryon over anti - baryon at larger rapidities causes the broadening of the width of the rapidity distribution of the particles containing leading quarks ( since their production is dependent on the distribution of @xmath5 and @xmath6 quark ) .",
    "further , from fig . [ fig3 ] ( right panel ) it is seen that for all but @xmath26 particles , that contain produced quarks only , the rapidity width decreases with decreasing centrality . such decrease in the width of the rapidity distribution of the particles containing produced quarks",
    "only could be due to the decrease in the size of the central fireball with the increase of impact parameter . for @xmath26 , whose",
    "all the constituent quarks are produced quarks only ( sss ) , its production in urqmd-3.3 , in addition to string fragmentation is also influenced by @xmath4 ( dss ) , whose one of the constituent is a leading quark , via @xmath19 .",
    "it is because of this influence of @xmath4 , being a leading particle whose width increases with decrease of centrality , @xmath26 is found to exhibit a different pattern other than its species member ( having no leading quarks ) . to prevent the production of @xmath26 from @xmath27 interaction another 60 millions of events",
    "were generated by switching off @xmath19 channel in the urqmd event generator and the resulting rapidity dependent enhancement factor of @xmath26 is replotted in fig [ fig5 ] .",
    "it can be readily seen from this figure that the generic rise and fall pattern of @xmath20 , as seen for leading particles , is completely missing now for @xmath26 . even though the plot is not exactly symmetric ( which could be due to the limitation of the patch itself used for stopping the @xmath19 channel )",
    ", the presence of a clear minimum around mid - rapidity can surely be not ruled out .",

    "the strangeness enhancement factor of various produced particles containing and not containing leading quark as one of the constituents is studied at various rapidity bins for @xmath0 collisions at 30__a _ _ gev . from this study",
    "it is seen for the first time that the pattern of rapidity dependent strangeness enhancement factor depends on the quark content of hadrons . at mid - rapidity",
    ", the strangeness enhancement factor is found to be maximum for the particles containing leading quarks while it shows a minimum at mid - rapidity for the particles containing produced quarks only .",
    "such two distinctive patterns of variation of strangeness enhancement with rapidity have been attributed to the fact that the width of the rapidity distribution of the produced particles follows two different patterns with centrality ( impact parameter ) for particles containing or not containing leading quarks .",
