    "pulsars have high space velocities , typically in the range 1501500  @xcite .",
    "since such speeds are well in excess of typical sound speeds for the cold ( @xmath0  ) or warm components ( @xmath1  ) of the interstellar medium ( ism ) , we expect that many pulsars are moving supersonically , and that they should thus drive bow shocks through ambient gas .",
    "such phenomena are , of course , not unique : astrophysical bow shocks are seen around proto - stars , clumps of supernova ejecta , runaway ob stars , and in the solar wind ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , several factors make pulsar bow shocks particularly appealing to study .",
    "first , for pulsars the mechanical luminosity of the wind driving the bow shock can be reasonably estimated through the pulsar s `` spin - down luminosity '' , given by @xmath2 ( where @xmath3  g  @xmath4 is the neutron star s assumed moment of inertia , @xmath5 is the star s spin period , and @xmath6 is the period derivative ) .",
    "spin - down luminosities for observed pulsars are typically in the range @xmath7  ergs  s@xmath8 .",
    "second , for many pulsars , precision timing and interferometric measurements allow accurate determinations of the star s position and proper motion . finally , compared to many other galactic populations , the distances to pulsars are reasonably well - established  from parallax for about 20 sources ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and from dispersion of the pulsed radio signals for over 1500 others @xcite .",
    "all these factors mean that many of the unknowns generally associated with bow shocks are not an issue for pulsars ; in principle , the only parameters to be determined are the density and structure of the ism , plus the inclination angle of the system .",
    "furthermore , most pulsars are @xmath9 years old , their high space velocities having carried them far from their birth places .",
    "this means that pulsars are more or less randomly located within the galactic disk , and that their bow shocks can thus act as unbiased probes of the ism .",
    "bow shocks also potentially provide an opportunity to study the winds of `` typical '' pulsars , rather than extreme cases of youth and energy as typified by the crab nebula .    despite their potential as useful probes of pulsars and their surroundings ,",
    "very few pulsar bow shocks were known until recently . because of several recent discoveries and accompanying theoretical modelling ,",
    "there has been renewed interest in these systems in the last few years . here",
    "i summarise recent work , and the resulting improvements to our understanding . for earlier reviews on bow shocks",
    "see @xcite and @xcite ; for more general discussion of pulsar wind nebulae , the reader is referred to reviews by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "several authors have considered the theory of bow shocks in detail , both under general circumstances @xcite and specifically in the case of pulsars @xcite .",
    "some pertinent points from these studies are as follows .",
    "* scaling parameter : * one parameter sets the overall scale of a bow shock  the `` stand - off distance '' , @xmath10 .",
    "this is the separation between the pulsar position and the apex of the bow shock , and is set by pressure balance , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the ambient mass density and @xmath13 is the pulsar s space velocity relative to its surroundings .",
    "* shape : * @xcite has provided an elegant analytic solution to the shape of a bow shock , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the radius of the bow shock at a polar angle @xmath16 . this solution is for an idealised thin - layer shock , but is also expected to be a reasonable approximation to pulsar bow shocks in regions near the apex @xcite .",
    "* overall structure : * because of the long cooling time scales , bow shocks are not thin shells , but show a characteristic double - shock structure , as shown in figure  [ fig_bucc ] .",
    "the morphology consists of a forward shock which heats the ism , a termination shock which decelerates the pulsar wind , and a contact discontinuity dividing shocked ism from shocked pulsar wind material .    *",
    "termination shock : * the pulsar wind experiences a significant difference in pressure between regions ahead of and behind the pulsar s motion .",
    "the termination shock is therefore not of uniform radius around the pulsar , but rather has a bullet - shaped morphology , the head of the bullet aligned with the pulsar s direction of motion as can be seen in figure  [ fig_bucc ] .",
    "for low mach numbers , @xmath17 , the ratio of termination shock radii between the directions immediately behind and directly ahead of the pulsar is roughly proportional to @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "however , in the limit of high mach number , this ratio tends to an asymptotic limit of about 5 @xcite .",
    "the forward shock should produce observable h@xmath19 emission , resulting from collisional excitation and charge exchange of neutrals in ambient gas .",
    "indeed some beautiful bow shocks have been observed in the h@xmath19 line , several of which have been discovered just in the last few years @xcite .",
    "detection of such a bow shock allows one to estimate measure @xmath10 , although two cautions must be issued .",
    "first , @xmath10 formally corresponds to the distance from the pulsar to the termination shock , not to the forward shock ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "so the observed pulsar / shock separation needs to be scaled by some factor , which simulations suggest has a value @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "second , the measured separation needs to be corrected for the ( usually unknown ) inclination .",
    "this correction is not a simple trigonometric factor , because projection of the three - dimensional bow - shock surface onto the sky can be larger than the true separation @xcite .",
    "correction for inclination is non - trivial , and quantities inferred from the observed bow - shock separation should thus be considered approximate .    with these caveats in mind",
    ", pressure balance can be applied to a system in which @xmath21 and @xmath13 are known to yield @xmath12 via equation  ( [ eqn_balance ] ) .",
    "this approach suggests ambient densities @xmath22  @xmath23 , as expected for warm neutral gas in the ism @xcite . in cases where @xmath13 is not known ,",
    "one can write @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the adiabatic coefficient of the ism and @xmath26 is the ism pressure . adoption of a typical value for @xmath26 allows one to directly estimate @xmath18 .    in the case of an isotropic pulsar wind propagating through a homogeneous ism , equation  ( [ eqn_wilkin ] ) should describe the h@xmath19 brightness profile well . for psr  j04374715",
    "this indeed seems to be the case , allowing one to solve for the inclination angle of the system @xcite .",
    "however , in several other cases there are significant deviations from this idealised solution , in the form of abrupt kinks and bulges in the bow - shock profile , or a rotational offset between the symmetry axis of the bow shock and the velocity vector of the pulsar ( e.g. , psr  b074028 , @xcite @xcite ; psr  j21243358 , @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "these shapes imply some combination of anisotropies in the pulsar wind ( as are known to exist around young pulsars ; see @xcite @xcite ) , density variations in the ism , or significant motion of ambient gas with respect to the local restframe .",
    "multi - epoch observations , showing changes in the bow - shock structure with time , are beginning to explore these possibilities @xcite .",
    "just as is the case for younger systems like the crab nebula , we expect that the particles in the pulsar wind will be accelerated at the termination shock , generating radio and x - ray synchrotron emission .",
    "indeed cometary radio and x - ray emission aligned with the direction of motion is seen around several high velocity pulsars @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig_mouse ] shows the results of a recent detailed study of `` the mouse '' , an elongated radio and x - ray nebula coincident with the energetic pulsar j17472958 @xcite .",
    "the mouse is very luminous , and thus represents an ideal opportunity to test the theories developed for bow - shock termination shocks .",
    "if the x - ray and radio emission from the mouse comes from the termination shock region , we expect it to be sharply bounded at its apex by the contact discontinuity .",
    "the extent of emission thus allows us to estimate the stand - off distance for this system  for a distance of 5  kpc we find @xmath27  pc . for ism pressures",
    "@xmath28  k  @xmath23 ( with typical observed values in the range @xmath29 ) , this implies a high mach number , @xmath30 , and thus a likely space velocity @xmath31  if propagating through the warm component of the ism .",
    "the x - ray and radio morphologies shown in figure  [ fig_mouse ] both indicate the presence of an elongated bright `` tongue '' of emission behind the pulsar , about 0.25  pc in length .",
    "an interpretation of this feature is suggested by comparison with the hydrodynamic simulation shown in figure  [ fig_bucc ] , where it can be seen that the tongue has a similar appearance to the surface of the bullet - shaped termination shock .",
    "if we make this identification , then the tongue in the mouse is directly analogous to the inner toroidal ring seen for the crab nebula and other related systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , demarcating the point where the pulsar wind reacts to its surroundings and where wind particles are accelerated up to synchrotron - emitting energies .",
    "it is important to note that hydrodynamic simulations such as that shown in figure  [ fig_bucc ] do not explicitly include the effects of magnetic fields or relativistic flows , so an exact correspondence between the data and the model is not expected .",
    "in particular , two important discrepancies can be identified : the ratio of backward and forward termination shocks is observed to be @xmath1 , rather than the value of 5 predicted for @xmath32 ; and the sheath does not show any limb - brightening as would be expected given its geometry .",
    "the first of these points can potentially be explained by the effect of ions in the wind , whose gyrations in the magnetic field spread the electron shock over a large distance @xcite .",
    "this effect should operate in the backward flow from the pulsar , but not in the forward direction due to the high degree of pressure confinement .",
    "the lack of limb brightening can be accounted for by doppler boosting in the post - shock flow , as is consistently observed in the winds of younger , lower velocity pulsars @xcite . while confirmation of these effects will require a fully relativistic magnetohydrodynamic treatment , we emphasise that both the effects claimed here have been seen in the wind nebulae around `` crab - like '' pulsars .",
    "the need to invoke similar phenomena here suggests a high degree of commonality between the wind properties of the youngest pulsars and more typical members of the population",
    ".    west of the tongue , a fading tail of emission is seen , which must come from material significantly downstream of the termination shock .",
    "this emission is analogous to the main body of the nebula in crab - like systems .",
    "the tail of emission behind the mouse can be delineated into two components , as indicated in figure  [ fig_mouse ] .",
    "the first component is bright , reasonably narrow , and is seen in both radio and x - rays ; the second component is broader , fainter , and is seen in radio only .",
    "these structures can be qualitatively understood by again considering the hydrodynamic simulation of figure  [ fig_bucc ] , in which it can be seen that there are two extremes in the flow .",
    "ahead of the pulsar , the wind shocks at a small distance from the pulsar at the apex , then turns around and flows around the edges of the shocked region .",
    "in contrast , behind the pulsar the distance to the shock is considerably larger ; the post - shock flow then remains in a narrow collimated region lying along the symmetry axis . if equipartition holds , so that @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the post - shock nebular magnetic field , then the shocked flow ahead of the pulsar should have a magnetic field @xmath1 times larger than that behind the pulsar .",
    "we thus expect a broad flow in which the x - ray emission suffers severe synchrotron losses , enveloping a narrow flow in which the x - rays are yet to cool .",
    "this is in accordance with observations , suggesting that in contrast to the crab nebula , the pulsar s motion structures the post - shock emitting regions into two distinct zones .",
    "now that we have a picture of what might be occurring for the mouse , it is insightful to consider other bow shocks which produce radio and x - ray emission , to see if similar features are observed .",
    "some pulsars , such as psrs  b175724 and b1957 + 20 @xcite , show short ( @xmath35  pc ) x - ray trails extending opposite the pulsar s direction of motion .",
    "one interpretation is that these features are synchrotron `` wakes '' , i.e. , particles left behind by the pulsar as it moves through the ism .",
    "however , the time taken for a pulsar to traverse the extent of one of these trails is @xmath36  yr , implying abnormally low nebular magnetic field strengths if synchrotron cooling at x - ray energies is to be avoided during this period .",
    "it has therefore been suggested that a rapid backflow or nozzle operates downstream , which rapidly advects emitting particles and produces the trail structures observed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , the mouse suggests an alternative interpretation .",
    "we expect two components to the downstream synchrotron emission from a pulsar bow shock .",
    "close to the pulsar , we should see a `` tongue '' of emission around the termination shock .",
    "we expect this region to show a constant x - ray spectrum across its extent , to have a comparable extent in radio and x - rays , and to abruptly terminate at a distance @xmath37 behind the pulsar .",
    "further from the pulsar , the `` tail '' component representing post - shock material should show an x - ray spectrum which softens with distance from the pulsar , should have a larger extent in radio than in x - rays , and should gradually fade into the background over an extent @xmath38 .",
    "armed with the realisation that bow shocks should show both these components , it seems that the short trails seen around psrs  b1957 + 20 and b175724 correspond well to the tongue component of the mouse .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have thus both argued that the name `` trail '' is a misnomer  these features are simply the surfaces of the termination shock around these pulsars , the longer tail of emission downstream being too faint to see .    on the other hand , a closer examination of other pulsar bow shocks suggests that they too potentially show multiple components in x - rays , corresponding both to the termination shock and to the tail of emission behind it .",
    "possible examples of such systems are psr  b1853 + 01 in the supernova remnant ( snr ) w44 @xcite , psr  b1951 + 32 in snr  ctb  80 @xcite , and the neutron star cxou  j061705.3 + 222127 in snr  ic  443 @xcite .",
    "the latter source is shown in figure  [ fig_ic443 ] , where the identification of these possible structures is indicated .",
    "it is interesting to note that this source is moving through the shocked gas in the interior of an evolved snr . in this case",
    ", we expect a mach number @xmath39 @xcite , much lower than for a pulsar moving through the ism . for this low mach number",
    ", we expect the `` tongue '' region to only be about half as long ( in units of @xmath10 ) than for a high mach number system like the mouse .",
    "indeed the data in figure  [ fig_ic443 ] suggest an extent for this feature @xmath40 , compared to @xmath37 for the mouse .",
    "deeper _ chandra _  observations of both cxou  j061705.3 + 222127 and psr  b1853 + 01 are scheduled to take place in 2005 , which should allow a better investigation of these possibilities .",
    "in  [ sec_theory ] , it was noted that a double - shock structure is expected around a supersonic pulsar . while we clearly see either forward or termination shocks around various neutron stars , for just one system , psr  b1957 + 20 ,",
    "have both the termination shock ( in x - rays ) and forward shock ( in h@xmath19 ) been identified in the same source @xcite .",
    "a collection of such sources can act as a detailed probe of the hydrodynamics of the bow - shock interaction , so expansion of this sample is obviously highly desirable .",
    "most of the pulsar bow shocks seen in radio / x - rays have high values of @xmath21 , meaning that they are reasonably rare and hence distant .",
    "the high extinction to these systems makes it difficult to identify any h@xmath19 emission around them .",
    "on the other hand , h@xmath19 bow shocks tend to be nearby , so are worthwhile targets for x - ray imaging , even if @xmath21 is low .",
    "but of the five other known h@xmath19 bow shocks besides that around psr  b1957 + 20 , two ( psr  j04374715 , @xcite @xcite ; rx  j1856.53754 ) show no extended x - ray emission , one ( psr  b2224 + 65 ; @xcite @xcite ) shows an x - ray filament completely misaligned with the pulsar s direction of motion , and the remaining two ( psrs  b074028 and j21243358 ) are yet to be observed at high angular resolution by _",
    "chandra_. radio searches to some of these sources have also not been successful at detecting extended emission @xcite .",
    "the lack of emission from the termination shock in systems for which the wind is known to be strongly confined is puzzling .",
    "a consistent understanding is now beginning to emerge of the various multi - wavelength structures seen around high velocity pulsars .",
    "as expected , we see optical emission from the shocked ism in several bow shocks , from which we can infer the density of the ambient medium or the mach number of the system .",
    "the morphologies of these shocks also allow us to probe anisotropies in the ism and in the pulsar wind .",
    "the x - ray and radio emission produced at the termination shock in these systems permit a study of the relativistic wind which drives the bow shock . just as in the crab nebula ,",
    "high - resolution x - ray imaging allows us to identify both the surface of the termination shock and emission from the post - shock flow . as in the crab ,",
    "the effects of an ion - loaded wind and of doppler beaming are required to explain the observations , suggesting that the wind composition and behaviour is similar for bow shocks and for crab - like systems . however ,",
    "a distinct difference from the crab is the presence of two flow zones downstream , corresponding to highly- and weakly - magnetized material , emerging from the front and back of the termination shock , respectively .    in the near future",
    ", we expect that deeper x - ray and optical images will increase the sample and show new types of structure ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and that relativistic magnetohydrodynamical simulations can begin to provide a solid theoretical underpinning for the observed morphologies .",
    "the time domain is now also beginning to play a role , in that we can watch bow shocks evolve as they trace the cascade of density inhomogeneities in the ism @xcite .",
    "clearly bow shocks are now beginning to fulfil their long - standing promise to act as unique probes of pulsars and their surroundings .",
