    ", various empirical results have threatened the predictive and explanatory power of these classical models : human judgments display order effects  the answers given to two questions depend on the order of presentation of these questions ( schuman and presser 1981 , tourangeau , ribs and rasinski 2000 , moore 2002 )  , conjunction fallacies  someone is judged less likely to have characteristic @xmath0 than characteristics @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( tversky and kahneman 1982 and 1983 , gavanski and roskos - ewoldsen 1991 , stolarz - fantino _ et al .",
    "_ 2003 )  , violate the sure - thing principle  stating that preferring @xmath2 to @xmath3 given any possible state of the world should imply preferring @xmath2 to @xmath3 when the exact state of the world is not known ( allais 1953 , ellsberg 1961 , shafir and tversky 1992 )  , or asymmetries in similarity  @xmath2 is judged more similar to @xmath3 than @xmath3 to @xmath2 ( tversky 1977 , krumhansl 1978 , ashby and perrin 1988 ) . in the classical cognitive framework ,",
    "these behaviors have often been dubbed as irrational or paradoxical .",
    "recently , a research field that rely on so - called  quantum \" or  quantum - like \" models has developed to account for such behaviors . the qualifier ",
    "quantum \" is used to indicate that the models exploit the mathematics of a contemporary physical theory , quantum mechanics .",
    "note that only some mathematical tools of quantum mechanics are employed , and that the claim is not that these models are justified by an application of quantum physics to the brain .",
    "for that reason , we shall prefer to call them  quantum - like \" models . such models put into question two classical characteristics recalled above : they abandon bayesian probabilities for others which are similar to probabilities in quantum mechanics , and they allow for preferences or attitudes to be undetermined .",
    "quantum - like models have received much interest from psychologists , physicists , economists , cognitive scientists and philosophers .",
    "for example , new theoretical frameworks have been proposed in decision theory and bounded rationality ( danilov and lambert - mogiliansky 2008 and 2010 , yukalov and sornette 2011 ) .",
    "various quantum - like models have been proposed to account for any of the seemingly paradoxical behaviors recalled above ( for reviews , see pothos and busemeyer 2013 , ashtiani and azgomi 2015 ) .",
    "first , as the mathematics involved in quantum mechanics are well - known for their non - commutative features , one of their natural application is the account of question order effects .",
    "for instance , wang and busemeyer ( 2013 ) and wang _ et al . _",
    "( 2014 ) offer a general quantum - like model for attitude questions that are asked in polls .",
    "( 2009 ) present a model for mental states of visual perception , and atmanspacher and rmer ( 2012 ) discuss non - commutativity .",
    "quantum - like models have also been offered to explain the conjunction fallacy .",
    "for instance , franco ( 2009 ) argues that it can be recovered from interference effects , which are central features in quantum mechanics and at the origin of the violation of classical probabilities .",
    "( 2011 ) present a quantum - like model that could explain conjunction fallacy from some order effects .",
    "the violation of the sure thing principle has also been investigated by means of quantum - like models .",
    "busemeyer , wang and townsend ( 2006 ) , and busemeyer and wang ( 2007 ) use quantum formalism to explain this violation by introducing probabilistic interference and superposition of states .",
    "khrennikov and haven ( 2009 ) also explain ellsberg s paradox , and aerts _ et al . _",
    "( 2011 ) model the hawaii problem .",
    "lambert - mogiliansky _ et al . _",
    "( 2009 ) offer a model for the indeterminacy of preferences .",
    "dynamical models , that rely on a time evolution of the mental state , have also been introduced ( pothos and busemeyer 2009 , busemeyer _ et al .",
    "_ 2009 , and trueblood and busemeyer 2011 ) .",
    "several other empirical features , such as asymmetry judgments in similarity have also been offered a quantum - like model ( pothos and busemeyer , 2011 ) .",
    "we shall concentrate in this paper on one kind of quantum - like models , those which claim to account for question order effect  that answers depend on the order in which questions are asked .",
    "we choose these models because ( i ) order effect is a straightforward application of the non - commutative mathematics from quantum mechanics , ( ii ) order effect models are perhaps the simplest ones and ( iii ) some of them are at the roots of other models .",
    "all quantum - like models for order effect are not identical . yet ,",
    "several of them are built along the same lines , as in conte _",
    "( 2009 ) , busemeyer _ et al . _",
    "( 2009 ) , busemeyer _ et al . _",
    "( 2011 ) , atmanspacher and rmer ( 2012 ) , pothos and busemeyer ( 2013 ) , wang and busemeyer ( 2013 ) and wang _ et al . _",
    "we choose to focus here on this kind of models for order effect ( to be characterized , at least partly , in section  2 ) .",
    "so , we do not consider for instance the model in aerts , gabora and sozzo ( 2013 ) that rely on different hypotheses , or a quantum - like model for order effect in inference that can be found in trueblood and busemeyer ( 2011 ) or in busemeyer _",
    "our analyses only bear on the previously mentioned kind of models .",
    "when such quantum - like models for order effects were proposed , empirical adequacy was cared about : it was argued that the models were able to account either for existing empirical data ( e.g. wang and busemeyer 2013 for the data from moore 2002 , wang _ et al .",
    "_ 2014 for data from around 70 national surveys ) or for data from new experiments ( e.g. conte _ et al .",
    "_ 2009 , wang and busemeyer 2013 ) .",
    "this is not all : a supplementary _ a priori _ constraint ( the  qq equality \" ) has been derived and it has been successfully verified on the above - mentioned data ( wang and busemeyer 2013 , wang _ et al . _ 2014 ) .",
    "so , it seems that quantum - like models for question order effects are well verified and can be considered as adequate , at least for a vast set of experiments .",
    "however , some details remain to be settled . in many cases , the above - referred papers do not specify exactly which model , with which parameters , is to account for the data in this or thus order effect situation .",
    "in particular , when it is claimed that some data can be accounted for by a quantum - like model , the dimensionality of the model is often not specified , and the most general case is assumed : the model is supposed to be @xmath4 dimensional , and the answers to the questions can be represented by subspaces of any dimension .",
    "this encompasses two cases : either the answers are represented by 1-d subspaces , in which case the model is said to be _ non - degenerate _ , or the answers are represented by subspaces of larger dimensions , in which case the model is said to be _ degenerate_. the papers do not always specify whether the model that is to account for the data can remain simple and be non - degenerate , or has to be degenerate  this is a question of theoretical importance , as we shall argue .",
    "the quantum - like literature is inclined to favor degenerate models , insisting on the high - dimensionality of the space and on the complexity of the experimental situation to be modeled , and often considers non - degenerate models as toy models and use them for illustrative purposes onlyfor instance , in busemeyer and bruza ( 2012 ) , the non - degenerate model is presented as  a simple example \" ( p. 100 ) or as  much too simple \" ( p. 108 ) , before the general model , which is degenerate , is presented . that non - degenerate models are  toy models \" is also what suggest busemeyer _ et al . _",
    "2015 p. 240",
    ", albeit for quantum - like models for the conjunction fallacy .",
    "an exception towards degeneracy is conte _ et al . _",
    "( 2009 ) , one of the first papers in the field , which only considers non - degenerate models . ] .",
    "so , the question of choosing between non - degenerate and degenerate models on an empirical basis has not been fully dealt with , and it remains unclear so far whether the simple non - degenerate version of the models could be empirically adequate .",
    "is there a simple way to test whether a non - degenerate version of the quantum - like models is sufficient to account for some order effect data ?",
    "the present paper argues that this question can receive a positive answer .",
    "we show that the non - degenerate versions of the quantum - like models under consideration can actually be empirically tested in another unstudied  although simple  way , that bears on data that were not intended to be explained but that are nevertheless predicted by the models . after reconstructing a non - degenerate quantum - like version of a model for order effect ( section  2 )",
    ", we derive from the quantum law of reciprocity a set of constraints for it that we call the grand reciprocity ( gr ) equations ( section  3 ) . in section  4 , we argue that the non - degenerate versions of the models that can be found in conte _",
    "( 2009 ) , busemeyer and bruza ( 2012 ) , pothos and busemeyer ( 2013 ) , wang and busemeyer ( 2013 ) and wang _ et al . _",
    "( 2014 ) , have to obey the gr equations  note that these papers , except for conte _ et al . _",
    "( 2009 ) , also consider degenerate versions of the models , that are not required to obey the gr equations , and thus will not be tested here .",
    "using only available data and without carrying out any new experiment , we are able to put the gr equations to the test ( section  5 ) . we show that a vast majority of empirical cases fail to satisfy the gr equations , which means that the non - degenerate versions of the above - mentioned models can not account for these cases .",
    "in other words , if the quantum - like models that have been proposed are indeed to work , it can not be in the special case of their non - degenerate versions , as the authors themselves had rightly anticipated , and the data should be accounted for with degenerate models . in section  6 ,",
    "we suggest however that the route of degenerate models is not necessarily an easy one , and we argue for more research on the empirical adequacy of models in general .",
    "overall , the positive conclusion of our results , we suggest , is that research on quantum - like models for question order effect should be directed towards degenerate models , both as a consequence of the failure of non - degenerate ones and in order to find generalizations of the gr equations that should enable to empirically test them .",
    "this paper is the first one to challenge non - degenerate models for order effect and to show that they can not be used as such in many cases .",
    "our work puts warnings about the future use of these specific models , and provides a critical and constructive look at quantum models of cognition .",
    "as indicated in the introduction , we are concerned here with the following quantum - like models for order effect : conte _ et al . _",

    "as they are more or less built along the same lines , we choose for simplicity to present in this section one simple and general model , which sets the notations and on which all the discussions will be made . a crucial point is this : these models , except for conte _ et al . _",
    "( 2009 ) , are quite general and can be degenerate or non - degenerate , as already noted . as we shall be concerned here with testing their non - degenerate versions only , as a special case ,",
    "the model we present in this section is non - degenerate . in section  4",
    ", we shall discuss in detail how this model is included in the models from the above list .",

    "it is important to note that an answer is supposed to be represented by a vector ( or more exactly , see below , by the ray defined by this vector ) , and not by a plane or by any subspace of dimension greater than 1 . since there are no other possible answers to question @xmath5 ( respectively @xmath6 ) than 0 and 1 , the set ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) ( respectively ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) ) forms a basis of the vector space of possible answers , and the vector space is thus of dimension @xmath11 .",

    "another possible generalization concerns the basis vectors : what if they depend on the agent @xmath87 , with @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 ? in this case , the above gr equations can be established for each agent @xmath87 in the same way as previously , except that the terms are now indexed for each agent @xmath87 , in the form @xmath92 ( or respectively @xmath93 ) , with @xmath94 . for the whole population , @xmath95 is now defined by the average of the statistical probabilities @xmath96 on all @xmath4 agents:@xmath97 and similarly for @xmath98 .",
    "but because for any @xmath87 , @xmath92 , then @xmath99 so finally @xmath100 ( or respectively = @xmath101 ) , and the gr equations hold for the whole population even if the basis vectors depend on the agent .",
    "this is just because it holds for any agent , and that the average on the agents is a linear operation that enables to keep the form of the equations .",
    "also , quantum systems can be described with more general mixed states , instead of pure states .",
    "here is the difference : @xmath26 has been supposed to be equal to a vector from the hilbert space , i.e. a pure state , and this supposes that the modeler knows to which vector the state is equal .",
    "but there are cases in which the modeler does nt know exactly to which vector the state is equal ( for instance , she only knows that there are 50% chances that the state is @xmath7 , and 50% chances that it is @xmath8 ) . to express this ,",
    "the belief state is considered as a statistical ensemble of pure states , and it is represented by a density matrix ( for instance , we write @xmath102 for the above case ) .",
    "the question is then : are the gr equations valid for pure states only , or also for mixed states ?",
    "for both , because no particular hypothesis has been made on the state _ before the first question is asked_. what matters for the demonstration is the state after the first question , and it is doomed to be the corresponding eigenvector ( up to a phase factor ) , whether the belief state was described as a statistical mixture or not before the question was asked .",
    "so , the gr equations hold even if mixed states are assumed , which can prove very powerful .",
    "the gr equations apply to a model with 2 questions with 2 possible answers each , but one could also consider a larger set of questions . consider a model with @xmath103 questions @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath0 ,  that are asked in a row , in various orders , each with 2 possible non - degenerate answers , in a hilbert space of dimension  2 . for the questions considered 2 by 2",
    ", the reciprocity law ( eq .  [ eq_law - reciprocity - general ] ) holds , since what matters is that answers are represented by 1d subspaces , and so the gr equations hold too .",
    "this gives a set of @xmath104 gr equations that this model must satisfy .",
    "consider now a model with 2 questions , each with @xmath105 possible answers , with non - degenerate eigenvalues , in a complex hilbert space of dimension  @xmath105 .",
    "the reciprocity law still holds in this case , and the gr equations hold for each couple of indexes @xmath106 .",
    "overall , the gr equations can be generalized to apply for models with @xmath103 questions and @xmath105 possible non - degenerate answers .",
    "the hypothesis that eigenvalues are non - degenerate , i.e. that eigenspaces are of dimension  1 , can be relaxed in some cases .",
    "suppose a model @xmath107 with eigenspaces of dimensions greater than 1 is empirically equivalent to a model @xmath108 with eigenspaces of dimension  1 .",
    "so to speak , the supplementary dimensions of @xmath107 are theoretically useless , and empirically meaningless .",
    "as the gr equations hold for @xmath108 , they will also hold for @xmath107 , to which it is equivalent .",
    "so , more generally , the gr equations hold for models which have eigenspaces of dimension 1 , or which are reducible ( i.e. equivalent ) to it",
    ".    these results may have a larger impact still .",
    "suppose that there exists a set of elementary questions , the answers of which would be represented by non - degenerate eigenspaces , i. e. rays .",
    "these elementary rays would define the fundamental basis belief states , on which any belief could be decomposed .",
    "the number of such elementary rays would define the dimensionality of the hilbert space representing human beliefs .",
    "such an assumption is widespread in the quantum - like literature .",
    "for instance , a similar idea is expressed by pothos and busemeyer about emotions :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  one - dimensional sub - spaces ( called rays ) in the vector space would correspond to the most elementary emotions possible .",

    "for instance , a degenerate answer represented by a plane combines two elementary dimensions because it fails to distinguish between them . as a consequence ,",
    "the meaning of a degenerate answer could be specified through more specific elementary answers .",
    "more importantly , the degenerate model could actually be tested on these fundamental questions , with our gr equations or their generalized versions with @xmath103 questions and @xmath105 answers .",
    "in other words , if elementary questions existed  and it seems to be a usual assumption in the quantum - like literature  any model of the kind presented in section  2 , but with non - degenerate answers or not , could be tested with gr equations .",
    "this is of fantastic interest , as it enables to test any model , and it has never been noted before .",
    "we shall come back on this point in section  6 .",
    "part of the gr equations is actually known in the literature as the requirement of  double stochasticity \" .",
    "let us analyze the links between the two constraints .",
    "define the change of basis matrix @xmath109 between the two bases @xmath110 and @xmath111 , as :    @xmath112    as the two bases are orthonormal by hypothesis , this matrix is unitary . from it",
    ", a transition matrix @xmath113 can be defined by @xmath114 : @xmath115 @xmath116 contains the probabilities for the answers to question @xmath5 given the previous answer to question @xmath6 ( @xmath116 could be also called @xmath117 ) .",
    "transition matrices are left stochastic : they are square matrices of non - negative real numbers , of which each column sums to 1 .",
    "this expresses the fact that , once an answer has been given to the first question , there is a probability 1 that one of the answers is given to the second question .",
    "a matrix is said to be doubly stochastic in case all columns and all rows sum to  1 . saying that @xmath116 is doubly stochasticity amounts to the following equations :    [ eq_pa0b0+pa1b0=1 ] p(a_0|b_0 ) + p(a_1|b_0 ) = 1 + p(a_0|b_1 ) + p(a_1|b_1 ) = 1 + p(a_0|b_0 ) + p(a_0|b_1 ) = 1 + [ eq_pa1b0+pa1b1=1 ] p(a_1|b_0 ) + p(a_1|b_1 ) = 1    substracting these equations one by one gives eq .",
    "[ eq_pa0b0=pa1b1 ] and [ eq_pa0b1=pa1b0 ]  but no more and [ eq_pb1a0=pb0a1 ] can not be derived from eq .",
    "[ eq_pa0b0+pa1b0=1][eq_pa1b0+pa1b1=1 ] : as they bear on questions asked in different orders , it is easy to imagine a case in which the former are false , whereas the latter are true . ] .",
    "so , one gets _ one half _ of the reciprocity relations .",
    "this should be no surprise : the double stochasticity constraint bears on only _",
    "one _ experiment , when the order of the questions is the same , and can not be informative about the reverse order .",
    "it is easy to see that if the double stochasticity of the reverse transition matrix ( @xmath118 ) is assumed , then one gets the other half of our reciprocity relations ( eq .  [ eq_pb0a0=pb1a1 ] and [ eq_pb1a0=pb0a1 ] ) , and then also the gr equations .",
    "conversely , our gr equations imply double stochasticity for both transition matrices .",
    "so , the gr equations are equivalent to the requirement of double stochasticity for transition matrices in both senses .    in the literature ,",
    "double stochasticity is a well - known property of transition matrices for quantum - like non - degenerate models cf .",
    "for instance busemeyer and bruza ( 2012 , 5354 ) , busemeyer , wang and lambert - mogiliansky ( 2009 ) , pothos and busemeyer ( 2013 , 269 ) . ] , but it has generally been required for _ one _ transition matrix only ( i.e. for questions posed in one order ) .",
    "an exception is khrennikov ( 2010 , 24 and 36 ) , who studies double stochasticity for transition matrices in both senses , and shows that it must be verified by quantum - like probability models with non - degenerate eigenvalues , i.e. like in our general model .",
    "however , he does not insist on testing experimentally this property in a systematic way , as we shall do here , with important consequences for existing models .",
    "although the gr equations are equivalent to double stochasticity in both orders for transition matrices , there are several reasons why the former formulation should be preferred , both pragmatically and theoretically . to test double stochasticity ,",
    "one first needs to write equations like eq .",
    "[ eq_pa0b0+pa1b0=1][eq_pa1b0+pa1b1=1 ] .",
    "but such equations are not independent , so it complicates the statistical tests of significance . or in order not to test useless equations",
    ", some work needs to be done beforehand to find the independent equations . actually , untangling the equations would just lead to the gr equations , which are directly usable .",
    "overall , the gr equations can be considered as the pragmatic form one should use to test double stochasticity in both orders .",
    "they also clearly show that two set of equations ( [ eq_mix0011 ] and [ eq_mix1001 ] ) are equivalent , and that one needs to pick only the corresponding data . also , the gr equations show at first sight that there is only one free parameter among all the possible conditional probabilities , while this is not transparent from the double stochasticity requirement .",
    "more theoretically , the gr equations are directly linked with a central mathematical property of the scalar product in the model , making it clear why it holds . on the other hand ,",
    "the reason why double stochasticity should hold in this model is more obscure .",
    "finally , the gr equations connect with a fundamental law of quantum mechanics , namely the law of reciprocity , which helps to understand why it holds only in the case of non - degenerate eigenvalues , like in quantum mechanics .",
    "wang and busemeyer ( 2013 ) and wang _ et al . _",
    "( 2014 ) defend the test of a relation called  the qq equality \" that they introduce .",
    "this equality holds for the non - degenerate quantum - like model presented in section  [ sec_general - quantum - model ] , and also if eigenvalues were degenerate . in the case of non - degenerate eigenvalues",
    ", it can be derived from our gr equations , as can be shown in the following way .    with the notations of our model ( and adding the notation @xmath119 for the probability to answer @xmath43 to question @xmath120 , when posed in the order @xmath2-then-@xmath3 ) , the qq equality ( wang and busemeyer 2013 , 698 ) can be written as : @xmath121 that is , @xmath122 because @xmath123 , it is equivalent to : @xmath124 = p(a_1|b_0 )   p_{ba}(b_0 ) + p(a_0|b_1 )   [ 1- p_{ba}(b_0)],\\ ] ] which can be rewritten as : @xmath125 p_{ab}(a_0 ) + p(b_0|a_1 )   = [ p(a_1|b_0 ) - p(a_0|b_1 ) ]   p_{ba}(b_0 ) + p(a_0|b_1).\\ ] ] the square brackets are null because of eq .",
    "[ eq_pb1a0=pb0a1 ] and [ eq_pa0b1=pa1b0 ] , and the two remaining terms are equal because of eq .",
    "[ eq_mix1001 ] .",
    "so , the qq equality is demonstrated from the gr equations when eigenspaces are not degenerate .",
    "the gr equations can not be derived in general from the qq equality : below , section  [ sec_empirical - glimpse ] gives an example of data which satisfy the qq equality , but not our gr equations .",
    "so the two tests are not equivalent .",
    "they test different things : if a data set does not satisfy the gr equations , the non - degenerate quantum - like model of section  2 can not apply to it ( it remains an open question whether a degenerate model would ) ; if a data set does not satisfy the qq equality , the non - degenerate quantum - like model of section  2 can not apply to it , and a degenerate version of it could not either . in other words ,",
    "a non - degenerate quantum - like model must satisfy both the gr equations and the qq equality , and a degenerate quantum - like model must satisfy the qq equality .      why test these gr equations ? as noted before , the quantum - like literature often consider models that can be either non - degenerate ( answers are represented by rays ) or degenerate ( answers are represented by subspaces of any dimension ) .",
    "so , a first reason to test the gr equations is simplicity : if a non - degenerate model is empirically adequate , why bother considering a degenerate one ?",
    "the possibility to have a non - degenerate model should be settled , and the gr test exactly enables it .",
    "conversely , for models that are proposed only in a non - degenerate version , the gr equations should be verified without condition , and they provide a decisive test of empirical adequacy .",
    "so , in any case , we suggest that ( one of ) the gr equation(s ) be directly tested experimentally for any quantum - like model that contains the model presented in section  2 , as a particular case only or not . ",
    "directly tested \" here means that what should be measured are the conditional probabilities that are present in these equations , or data that enable their computation .    on a more pragmatic ground ,",
    "the needed data are basic ones , easy to get experimentally .",
    "the equations are ready - to - use ones , simpler than the test of double stochasticity ( cf . section  [ subsec_link - dble - stoch ] ) . more theoretically , each gr equation is equivalent to a fundamental property of quantum - like models , namely the law of reciprocity .",
    "it is not just a consequence of it but it is just the expression of this law _ for all possible cases _ in the model .",
    "testing the gr equations is exactly testing the reciprocity law ( testing the qq equality , which is only a consequence of the reciprocity law , amounts to another test ) .",
    "the benefit is that testing the gr equations is more economical : they state that only 4 conditional probabilities need to be compared to test the law in general .",
    "another reason to test the gr equations is that a classical model does not verify them ; so they can be seen as a test of the quantum - like character of the data . ) . note that classical models which satisfy the gr equations are uninteresting : all @xmath126 and all @xmath127 are equal to @xmath128 . ]    a last point in favor of the test is that , when some empirical data verify the gr equations , it can be used to define a quantum - like model in a real hilbert space .",
    "define @xmath129 ; because of the gr equations , any conditional probability @xmath130 is either @xmath131 or @xmath132 , and eq .  [ eq_tab ] becomes : @xmath133 on the other hand , a model from a real hilbert space ( like in fig .",
    "[ fig_bases - a - and - b ] ) has a change of basis matrix @xmath134 and hence a transition matrix @xmath135 taking @xmath136 enables the real model to account for the data of conditional probabilities . to put it another way",
    ", checking the empirically validity of the gr equations enables at the same time to define the two bases relatively from one another .",
    "note that testing the gr equations require that the experiment be conducted in both question orders ( @xmath5-then-@xmath6 and @xmath6-then-@xmath5 ) .",
    "if only one question order is studied , a test can still be performed , but only on half of the equations .",
    "so , whenever a quantum - like model of the kind depicted here is proposed to account for the results of a succession of two questions in one order only , then the model should also be tested for the reverse order .",
    "the non - degenerate quantum - like model that we introduced in section  [ sec_general - quantum - model ] was intended to serve as a concise presentation for several models from the literature . in this section ,",
    "we discuss in detail the relation between our model and existing ones , in order to clarify whether the latter should verify the gr equations . recall that satisfying the gr equations is required in general for non - degenerate models only .",
    "so , if an existing model is proposed in the most general case either as non - degenerate or degenerate , then the gr equations apply only to the non - degenerate version of the model , not to its degenerate version .",
    "consider first conte _ et al . _",
    "( 2009 ) , who propose a quantum - like model to account for order effects in mental states during visual perception of ambiguous figures .",
    "their model can be cast into the lines of our general model : the two dichotomous questions or tests are also called @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and the probabilities of the answers are noted @xmath137 , @xmath138 , @xmath139 and @xmath139 , corresponding to our @xmath140 , @xmath141 , @xmath142 and @xmath143 .",
    "the questions concern visual perception of ambiguous figures , and a vector state , noted here @xmath144 ( instead of our @xmath145 ) represents the state of consciousness about the perception .",
    "it belongs to a complex hilbert space , and an answer is represented by a one - dimensional subspace ( this is implicit in their formula ( 3 ) ) .",
    "the usual born rule makes the link with probabilities .",
    "the model also involves a projection postulate : during perception , the  potential \" state of consciousness is collapsed onto  an actual or manifest state of consciousness \" ( p.  6 and 7 ) .",
    "note however a slight difference : for conte _ et al .",
    "_ , the projection of the state arises during perception of the figure , not during answering a question .",
    "but as the latter quickly follows the former , and as an agent answers a question only once her perception has stabilized , this does not make any difference in practice .",
    "overall , conte _ et al . _",
    "( 2009 ) s model matches our general model in all respects , as it supposes that eigenspaces are of dimension  1 .",
    "so , it has to obey the gr equations .",
    "consider now the model proposed by wang and busemeyer ( 2013 ) , called the qq model , which is to account for several types of order effects about judgments on various topics ( politics , sports , society , etc . ) .",
    "the clear presentation of the model in their section  2 , together with their geometric approach which provides figures similar to ours ( in the case of a real hilbert space ) , easily enables to see that it encompasses the non - degenerate model of section  2 . however , wang and busemeyer s model is more general and allows for an answer to be represented either with a subspace of dimension  1 ( non - degenerate version ) , or with a subspace of dimension larger than  1 ( degenerate version ) .",
    "the gr equations apply only to the former version , as a special case . for instance",
    ", they apply to figures 1 and 2 ( p.  4 and 5 ) , which represent  a two - dimensional example of the quantum - like model of question order effects \" .",
    "hence , the gr test will exactly fit here the aim we set it in the introduction : within this general model , specify whether non - degenerate model can be sufficient , or degenerate model are required .",
    "wang and busemeyer s general model is also at the basis of two other presentations : in busemeyer and bruza s 2012 book ( p.",
    "99116 ) , and in the review article of pothos and busemeyer ( 2013 ) . here too , the model can be non - degenerate or degenerate , and the gr equations apply with the same conditions : only to the special case of the non - degenerate version",
    ". atmanspacher and rmer ( 2012 , p.  277 ) make the suggestion that wang and busemeyer s model could be extended to mixed states , instead of just pure states .",
    "although this is an interesting theoretical possibility , it is clear that it can not be used to avoid the gr equations , as they are valid for pure as for mixed states ( cf .",

    "this paper has been concerned with the quantum - like models that have been recently proposed to account for question order effect .",
    "so far , many of them have been proposed in the most general way , either as non - degenerate or as degenerate , while it was suggested that degenerate models would be probably required .",
    "we settled on the project to document this empirically , by testing whether the non - degenerate versions of the models could be sufficient . to this end , we have advocated the test of novel predictions of the models , which are equivalent to the law of reciprocity : the gr equations . after performing the test against available data , the result is quite clear : non - degenerate models are not an option , being not empirically adequate or not needed .",
    "this confirms the suggestions from the literature ( cf .",
    "footnote  [ footnote_toy - model ] ) that they are too simple to be empirically adequate and should be considered as toy models only .    as we have also made it clear , our results do not rule out all quantum - like models : degenerate versions of the model , to which the gr equations do not apply , have not been tested here .",
    "so , a natural line of research is now to turn to degenerate quantum - like models , where answers are represented by sub - spaces of dimension 2 or larger .",
    "for instance , this is the solution adopted by busemeyer , wang and lambert - mogiliansky ( 2009 ) : after showing that a 2d quantum - like model is not doubly stochastic ( which implies that it does not respect our gr equations ) , they switch to a 4d model .- dimensional ones , which can be degenerate . ]    a strong suggestion in favor of this line of research comes from the following fact .",
    "while the gr equations are violated on a vast majority of experimental data sets , the qq equality is experimentally verified in all these cases ( for the data considered in wang and busemeyer 2013 and wang _ et al .",
    "recall that the qq equality is valid for quantum - like models of the kind considered here , whether they are degenerate or not ( cf . section  [ subsec_link - qq - equality ] ) .",
    "it is just an empirical prediction they all have to satisfy .",
    "also , wang and busemeyer ( 2009 , section  6 ) have argued that other kinds of models , like bayesian or markov ones , do not generally satisfy the qq equality , which gives good grounds to think that some quantum - like model could account for the data ( cf .",
    "also wang _ et al .",
    "as our present results exclude non - degenerate models , the hopes are now on the degenerate ones .",
    "overall , the following tests might be made on a data set of question order effect : 1 ) test the qq equality ; if it is violated , no quantum - like model ( of the sort considered in this paper ) can account for it ; if it is not violated , it gives good grounds to think ( but does not prove ) that a degenerate or non - degenerate quantum - like model can account for it ; 2 ) test the gr equations ; if they are violated , no non - degenerate quantum - like model can account for the data ; if they are not , one can .",
    "however , in our view , the route of degenerate models is not necessarily an easy one , and we would like to recommend that some research be done about their empirical adequacy .",
    "first , degenerate models are not _ a priori _ freed from any constraint , and this is the point on which we would like to insist very much .",
    "one should not consider that , when a data set satisfies the qq equality and violates the gr equations , the solution safely lies in a degenerate model .",
    "the moral of our paper should be taken as insisting on the need to empirically test all quantum - like models .",
    "note that we do not just call for running more experiments ; all the tests we have done here have been made _ on available data _ , and could have been made beforehand . importantly",
    ", empirical adequacy does not only mean applying to a vast number of empirical cases , but also , for one experimental case , making correct predictions _ in all respects _ , and for that it is crucial to pull the threads of all possible predictions . here , we have found simple and ready - to - use tests for non - degenerate models , and we suspect that some other constraints apply to degenerate models .",
    "research is urgently needed here to find general tests .",
    "at least , when a degenerate model is proposed to account for some features of a data set , we suggest that all parameters be specified and that serious efforts be directed towards empirically testing this model by unveiling experimental predictions that lie outside the feature one intends to explain , so as to prevent later  bad surprises \" .    a promising way to test degenerate models has already been indicated in the end of section  [ subsec_generalizations ] : degenerate eigenspaces may actually encompass non - degenerate and more fundamental eigenspaces , that correspond to fundamental elementary questions  to be identified .",
    "if such elementary questions exist , and the quantum - like literature seems not to have doubts on that , all degenerate models can actually be tested against generalized gr equations for these more fundamental questions .",
    "in other words , our gr test for non - degenerate models can possibly apply at a fundamental level for all degenerate models , provided elementary questions are identified .",
    "we are ready to admit , however , that the fundamental dimensions and the corresponding tests can be hard to uncover .    the need to specify the elementary dimensions of the hilbert space for degenerate models is also required by other arguments . introducing dimensions of degeneracy",
    "should be justified , so as not to be accused of being just _",
    "ad hoc_. as pothos and busemeyer ( 2013 , p.  215 ) write ,  dimensionality is not a free parameter \" . in quantum physics for instance ,",
    "degeneration is usually theoretically justified with a symmetry in the hamiltonian , and the degeneration can be experimentally removed by introducing some factor that was not present ( e.g. , the spin degeneration is removed by introducing a magnetic field ) . for quantum - like judgment models as well , one should provide a similar theoretical justification and an experimental way of removing the degeneration . in this respect ,",
    "the idea that there exists fundamental questions and rays will certainly be helpful ; the work is then to find out which fundamental dimensions are hidden behind the degenerate eigenspace .    overall , all this argues against the view that switching to degenerate models when gr equations are violated would be a natural or unquestioned move to have and that it would solve all problems . instead , supplementary dimensions should be justified , probably with elementary questions , and other predictions of the model than those one intends to account for should be investigated and tested , possibly with generalized gr equations .    beyond degenerate quantum - like models in the flavor of the model presented in section  2 , there are also other possible lines of research around quantum ideas . for instance",
    ", khrennikov has proposed to consider hyperbolic hilbert space models , instead of complex ones like in this paper .",
    "hyperbolic models enable probabilities that are not constrained in the same way , and can account for some data that are out of reach for complex quantum - like models ( see khrennikov 2010 for a synthesis ) .",
    "also , other tools than projectors , like povms , could be considered ; or other axioms of standard quantum - like models , like the projection postulate or the born rule , could be abandoned or modified .    to conclude ,",
    "quantum - like models have brought to discussion many provoking and seminal ideas , such as the hypotheses that judgments or preferences might be undetermined instead of only unknown , or that non - classical probabilities could be considered . we have insisted on the need to empirically test existing models for question order effect , and our results suggest that non - degenerate quantum - like models should be considered more as toy models than as empirically adequate models , in accordance with suggestions from the literature , and that future investigations should focus on degenerate models . in spite of the potential difficulties that such models face ,",
    "there is plenty of room for future research in the area , and besides our results can be taken as posing a challenge liable to trigger a revival of the discussion on quantum - like models of various sorts .",
