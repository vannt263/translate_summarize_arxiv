    "evidence for highly ionized outflowing material is seen in the rest - frame ultra - violet spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of many quasars .",
    "outflows are most prominent in broad absorption line quasars ( balqsos ) , where extensive line absorption by matter at outflow velocities up to 30000  is seen as a broad trough blueward of the rest - frame emission from the quasar @xcite .",
    "balqsos themselves are observed to make up some 20per cent of the population ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the intrinsic fraction of balqsos is even higher at redshifts @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the ubiquitous presence of outflows with velocities up to 12000 , visible via their absorption in the 1548.19,1550.77 doublet @xcite suggests the estimate that 60per cent of quasars possess outflows in the review by @xcite may be conservative .",
    "while the evidence for the presence of outflows associated with the majority of quasars is established , the origin , dynamics and composition of such outflows are poorly constrained .",
    "models based on radiation driven flows @xcite , magnetohydrodynamic driven winds @xcite and thermal winds @xcite all remain viable and it is possible that more than one mechanism is important .",
    "the quantity of material expelled from the central region of the quasar , and the energy it carries , has important implications for determining the lifetime of the quasar , the composition of the interstellar medium ( ism ) and galactic feedback mechanisms . @xcite",
    "provide a recent review of the key physical quantities involved .",
    "information about the nature of outflows , and the importance of radiative driving in their generation , can be gained from an analysis of the observed velocity structures present in the outflowing material .",
    "radiation - driving , and particularly the importance of acceleration via the interaction of photons with bound electrons in the outflowing material , is perhaps most familiar as the mechanism for producing winds from hot stars .",
    "@xcite presented the theory for stars at a time when spectroscopic observations of quasars were just beginning to provide observational constraints on the properties of gaseous material associated with the objects @xcite .",
    "compared to the situation with hot stars , the geometry of outflows in quasars is likely more complex and there are key differences in the physical properties of the outflowing material , notably the much lower particle densities .",
    "the theory behind radiatively - driven winds for quasars was developed by arav and coworkers in the 1990s @xcite .",
    "the importance of radiation - driving for outflows in balqsos was stressed @xcite and @xcite proposed the detection of the ` ghost of ly@xmath6 ' as unambiguous evidence for radiation - driving as the dominant source of acceleration in balqso winds .",
    "the phenomenon is postulated to arise in outflows where absorption of ly@xmath6 photons by -ions at a velocity of @xmath05900(where , in the frame of the outflowing -ions , strong resonant absorption occurs ) results in the rapid acceleration of material to greater velocities , reducing the amount of material present .",
    "the overall absorption opacity at @xmath05900is thereby reduced and an excess of emission is visible ( e.g. see figure 1 of  @xcite ) . for a tracer - ion in the flow , such as ,",
    "the manifestation of the phenomenon is a reduction in the absorption at @xmath05900 , leading to an apparent local excess of continuum emission ; hence the ` ghost of ly@xmath6 ' name .",
    "the in - depth consideration of the phenomenon by @xcite was motivated in part by possible differences in the spectra of non - balqsos and balqsos presented by @xcite and the subsequent investigation of @xcite . as discussed by @xcite ,",
    "very specific conditions are necessary for the ` ghost of ly@xmath6 ' to be detected .",
    "an outflow , including significant absorption , extending to @xmath710000 , must be present in a quasar that possesses both strong and relatively narrow intrinsic ly@xmath6 emission .",
    "the ghost signature is predicted to be most obvious for quasars where the far - ultraviolet spectrum of the quasar is weak , suppressing any contribution to the acceleration of the outflow from additional absorption due to resonance lines with wavlengths @xmath81000 .",
    "observational evidence for the presence of the ghost of ly@xmath6 has proved elusive , even when a systematic approach , using the power of the very large sample of homogeneous , moderate resolution and moderate signal - to - noise ratio spectra of quasars @xcite from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) are employed @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we undertake a complementary search , focused on the presence of ` line - locked ' absorption features in the spectra of individual quasars with extended narrow line absorption .",
    "such line - locked absorption is also accepted as evidence that radiative line - driving plays an important role in quasar outflow dynamics  @xcite .",
    "the principle behind line - locking in radiatively - driven outflows is that , under certain circumstances , material closer to the origin of the outflow can shield material further out , resulting in a synchronising of the outflow velocities .",
    "specifically , if a distant ` cloud ' is being accelerated outwards by line - driving arising from resonant absorption of photons in a particular ionic species , the reduction in the flux received by this cloud due to shielding by an inner cloud , moving with a relative velocity equivalent to the separation of two prominent absorption lines , could cause the clouds to become locked together in velocity  @xcite .",
    "simulations of the structure , dynamics and origin of quasar outflows also indicate that , for radiatively driven flows , line - locking could be prevalent  @xcite .",
    "quasar outflows are almost certainly quite complex and simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) predict the presence of significant structure on a variety of scales , involving fragmentation and clumping , some of which may be highly non - spherical ( e.g. filamentary or pancake - like ) .",
    "our use of the cloud-terminology above , and later in the paper , is as a shorthand for some form of modulation in density within the flow , along the line - of - sight to the illuminating source .",
    "the potential significance of observing a clear signature of line - locking has been recognised @xcite for much of the period since the discovery of quasars .",
    "evidence for the presence of line - locking signatures have , however , been largely confined to the identification of ` picket fence'-type absorption configurations in a relatively small number of individual quasars  .",
    "the availability of the sdss spectroscopic quasar sample @xcite now allows quantitative statistical investigation of outflow absorption signatures to be undertaken .",
    "we focus on the properties of absorption due to triply - ionized carbon , specifically the doublet transition 1548.19,1550.77 , which is the most readily observable high - ionization absorption feature in the sdss spectra that appears longward of the effects of the ly@xmath6-forest ( below @xmath01200 ) .",
    "the nature of absorption in balqsos and non - balqsos is dramatically different and we analyse samples of balqsos and non - balqsos separately .",
    "initially we began the investigation using an auto - correlation calculation , designed to be sensitive to the presence of many , individually difficult to detect , faint absorption features .",
    "more specifically , we looked for correlations between ` absorber pixels ' as a function of velocity separation , within each quasar spectrum , without the need to pre - identify individual , discrete absorbers .",
    "the auto - correlation method was devised primarily for balqsos , which represent a subset of the quasar population where outflows of material are very definitely present , yet the complex absorption profiles of the bal - troughs mean that searches for discrete absorbers might not represent the optimum approach . in practice ,",
    "such a reservation turned out to be unfounded and , as a result , we employed the familiar approach of identifying discrete absorption features and then investigating the incidence of absorber ` pairs ' as a function of velocity separation .",
    "the discrete - absorber method turns out to be highly effective for the investigation of the properties of individual , relatively narrow , -absorbers present in both the non - balqso and balqso quasar samples .",

    "we create and analyse composite quasar spectra as a function of outflow velocity , allowing an investigation into the physical properties of the absorbers and the host quasars .",
    "line - locking is shown to be almost ubiquitous among narrow -absorbers in quasar outflows with multiple absorbers .",
    ", a discussion of the interpretation of the results , including exploratory simulations using cloudy , is presented in section  [ sec : discuss ] , before the main conclusions of the paper are summarised in section  [ sec : conclude ] .",
    "the base quasar sample consisted of 42273 objects with redshifts @xmath9 from the dr7 quasar catalogue of @xcite , where the lower redshift limit was imposed in order for the blue - wing of the emission line to lie within the sdss spectra .",
    "above redshift @xmath10 the number of quasars in the sdss catalogue drops rapidly , and the majority are fainter than their lower redshift counterparts resulting in a significant reduction in the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) of the spectra .",
    "the quasars possess absolute magnitudes in the range -23.0@xmath11@xmath12@xmath11 - 29.5 @xcite but the sample is predominantly ( 79per cent ) made up of objects with -25.0@xmath11@xmath12@xmath11 - 27.0 .",
    "the spectra were all processed through the sky - residual subtraction scheme of @xcite , which results in significantly improved s / n at observed wavelengths @xmath137200 , contributing to the estimation of more accurate quasar redshifts from @xcite , which are employed throughout . for 3581 quasars in the sample ,",
    "the sdss dr7 release includes multiple spectra of high quality .",
    "for these quasars , the spectra were co - added using inverse variance weighting to produce a combined spectrum with improved s / n .",

    "the sample was culled to remove objects with spectra of low s / n in which the majority of moderate equivalent width absorption features are not readily detectable .",
    "specifically , spectra were retained in the sample if the average s / n per pixel in the continuum redward of the emission , at 1600 - 1650 , exceeded s / n=5.0 . to eliminate objects possessing spectra with extended wavelength regions missing , spectra with fewer than 3500 pixels ( defined by the sdss - flag ngood )",

    "discrete absorption features were identified using the following scheme . a ` continuum ' is defined for each quasar via the application of a simple 41pixel median filter .",
    "the ` difference ' spectrum , to be searched for absorption features , is then obtained by subtracting the continuum from the original quasar spectrum .",

    "the combination of the finite resolution of the quasar spectra and the intrinsic velocity widths of absorption systems precludes the detection of pairs of absorbers with small velocity separations .",

    "the acceleration decreases as lines become optically thick and are self - shielded . as shown by (",
    "* equation 3.48 ) , the radiative acceleration decreases when the line optical depth becomes significant . the outward acceleration has fallen by about a factor of two at the shielded face of the cloud .    although lines contribute 89 per cent of the total radiative acceleration , the doublet is not an important contributor to this total .",
    "the @xmath52629.7 line contributes over two thirds of the total acceleration , with lesser contributors from the and doublets .",
    "the doublet contributes only about 1 per cent of the total .",
    "nearly all of the acceleration due to continuum absorption is due to photoelectric opacity , with electron scattering being negligible .",
    "the exploratory investigation has been successful in showing that line - driving is capable of accelerating ` clouds ' with properties given in section  [ sec : clouds ] . in the context of the observations , it has also been possible to show that the line - locking signature due to exists as a local maximum in velocity space . in terms of the spectrum of potential line - locks",
    ", the 500feature represents the lowest velocity feature present and the idea that material in an outflow might ` lock ' naturally at the first significant peak in the line autocorrelation function ( fig .",
    "[ fig : acorr ] ; lower panel ) is attractive .",
    "what remains unclear , however , is why material in outflows appears to maintain the 500separation when the contribution of the -doublet represents such a small fraction of the total acceleration .",
    "line - driven winds are famously unstable @xcite .",
    "the decreasing acceleration means that the cloud will be compressed , becoming a pancake @xcite . eventually , the the geometry shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : accelldepth ] will become rayleigh - taylor unstable and will fragment over scales similar to the line shielding length .",
    "this brings in rich dynamical aspects which merit further more detailed investigation .",
    "[ fig : accelldepth ] gives hints to the origin of the line locking phenomenon .",
    "the properties of the cloud were taken from previous investigations and were not ` fine tuned ' for this work . had the column density been significantly smaller than assumed , the lines would have been optically thin ( and hence undetectable in this study ) and the cloud would also have been stable . had the column density been significantly larger , the lines would have been far more optically thick and self - shielded , with the acceleration falling precipitously as a consequence",
    ". such a cloud would fragment over scales corresponding to roughly optical depth unity in the driving lines .",
    "in fact , for these assumed properties , the cloud has precisely these properties .",
    "could the currently visible , line - locked , small column density clouds be the result of radiative instabilities in a cloud which was originally considerably larger ?",
    "such a scenario might explain why the line - locking signature for the narrow absorbers is also present among the balqso sample .",
    "alternatively , in a model in which bal features are due to winds above the accretion disk , seen only for special viewing angles , the narrow absorption systems studied in this paper could result from the outwardly accelerated interstellar medium of the host galaxy , visible for a much larger range of viewing angle .",
    "investigation of the statistics of strong , narrow doublet absorbers present in outflows seen in a large sample of luminous quasars ( -25.0@xmath1@xmath12@xmath1 - 27.0 ) demonstrates that line - locked absorber doublets are an almost ubiquitous feature of outflows . from the samples of @xmath031000 non - bal and @xmath02600 bal quasars it",
    "is found that :    @xmath97 approximately two thirds of quasars with multiple absorption systems in outflows extending to @xmath712000possess line - locked absorbers , visible as absorber triplets .",

    "@xmath97 line - locked systems are present in outflows with velocities reaching at least 20000 .",
    "@xmath97 there are no detectable differences in the absorber properties and the dust content of single doublets and line - locked doublets .",
    "@xmath97 the gas associated with both single and line - locked narrow absorption systems produces strong absorption due to species with a wide range of ionization potential ( 15ev ( ) to 98 ( ) and even 138ev ( ) ) .",
    "@xmath97 both single and line - locked absorber systems show strong systematic trends in their ionization as a function of outflow velocity @xmath25 . the ratio of the ew of @xmath54 to @xmath22 decreases with increasing @xmath25 , while that of @xmath55 to @xmath22 increases .",
    "@xmath97 the current sample of absorbers from the sdss dr7 quasars does not provide useful constraints on the prevalence of line - locks with velocity separations @xmath181000 , including those due to and at 964and 1654respectively .",
    "@xmath97 simulations employing cloudy demonstrate that a rich spectrum of line - locked signals at various velocities may be expected due to significant opacities from resonance lines of li - like , he - like and h - like ions of o , c and n , along with contributions from and resonance lines .",
    "@xmath97 computing the line optical - depth autocorrelation function ( acf ) for the full agn sed spectrum for parameters taken from published models provides a quantitative way to assess the importance of overlapping lines .",
    "@xmath97 many strong contributors to the acf are found , particular those from , and doublets but , in the general case , the doublet lock is not the strongest .",
    "@xmath97 the strength of particular line - locks depends on the shape of the illuminating agn sed , which provides the photons responsible for the acceleration at the wavelength of each absorber species .",
    "the line - lock can be made to appear significantly stronger by adopting an agn sed shape in the ultraviolet to near x - ray range that is consistent with current knowledge of the agn sed .",

    "the outward acceleration falls by a factor of two across our fiducial cloud , showing that the flow is rayleigh - taylor unstable .",
    "such a flow will fragment over scales similar to that observed  the point where the acceleration has fallen by a moderate factor .",
    "could the clouds we observe be the result of such fragmentation of clouds that were originally significantly larger ?",
    "the observational results presented open up a potentially important new constraint for i ) understanding the origin of the accelerating mechanism for high - ionization outflows in quasars and ii ) the physical conditions pertaining within the flow .",
    "observationally , improved constraints on the frequency of line - locks due to other species will be possible through the analysis of the forthcoming release ( dr11 ) of the sdss iii quasar catalogue .",
    "modelling outflows is a challenging , many - parameter , problem but the dependence of line - lock signatures from different species on the form of the agn sed is a particularly promising direction for future work , on which we intend to embark",
