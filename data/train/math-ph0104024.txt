    "molecules consist of light electrons , mass @xmath0 , and heavy nuclei , mass @xmath1 which depends on the type of nucleus . born and oppenheimer @xcite wanted to explain some general features of molecular spectra and realized that , since the ratio @xmath2 is small , it could be used as an expansion parameter for the energy levels of the molecular hamiltonian .",
    "the time-_independent _ born - oppenheimer theory has been put on firm mathematical grounds by combes , duclos , and seiler @xcite , hagedorn @xcite , and more recently in @xcite .    with the development of tailored state preparation and ultra precise time resolution there is a growing interest in understanding and controlling the dynamics of molecules , which requires an analysis of the solutions to the time-_dependent _ schrdinger equation , again exploiting that @xmath2 is small .",
    "the molecular hamiltonian is of the form @xmath3 for notational simplicity we ignore spin degrees of freedom and assume that all nuclei have the same mass .",
    "we have @xmath4 electrons with positions @xmath5 and @xmath6 nuclei with positions @xmath7 .",
    "the first and second term of @xmath8 are the kinetic energies of the electrons and of the nuclei , respectively . an external magnetic field",
    "is included through the vector potential @xmath9 .",
    "electrons and nuclei interact via the static coulomb potential .",
    "therefore @xmath10 is the electronic , @xmath11 the nucleonic repulsion , and @xmath12 the attraction between electrons and nuclei .",
    "@xmath10 and @xmath11 may also contain an external electrostatic potential .    in atomic units ( @xmath13 )",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ sbo1 ] ) can be written more concisely as @xmath14 emphasizing that the nuclear kinetic energy will be treated as a `` small perturbation '' .",
    "@xmath15 is the electronic hamiltonian for given position @xmath16 of the nuclei , @xmath17 @xmath15 is a self - adjoint operator on the electronic hilbert space @xmath18 restricted to its antisymmetric subspace .",
    "later on we will need some smoothness of @xmath15 , which can be established easily if the electrons are treated as point - like and the nuclei have an extended , rigid charge distribution .",
    "generically @xmath15 has , possibly degenerate , eigenvalues @xmath19 which terminate at the continuum edge @xmath20 .",
    "thereby one obtains the band structure as plotted schematically in figure 1 .",
    "the discrete bands @xmath21 may cross and possibly merge into the continuous spectrum as indicated in figure 2 .    [ f1 ]    comparing kinetic energies , we find for the speeds @xmath22 , which means that on the atomic scale the nuclei move very slowly . if we regard @xmath23 as a given nucleonic trajectory , then @xmath24 is a hamiltonian with slow time variation and the time - adiabatic theorem @xcite can be applied @xcite . for us",
    "@xmath16 are quantum mechanical degrees of freedom .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath8 of ( [ sbo21 ] ) is time - independent and we can only exploit that the nucleonic laplacian carries a small prefactor . to distinguish , we refer to our situation as space - adiabatic .",
    "since the nuclei move very slowly , their dynamics must be followed over sufficiently long times . from the speed ratio",
    "we conclude that these times are of order @xmath25 in atomic units . to simplify notation",
    "we define @xmath26 as the small dimensionless parameter .",
    "then @xmath27 and we want to study the solutions of the time - dependent schrdinger equation @xmath28 in the limit of small @xmath29 .    the crude physical picture underlying the analysis of ( [ se2 ] ) is that the nuclei behave semiclassically because of their large mass and that the electrons rapidly adjust to the slow nucleonic motion .",
    "thus , in fact , the time - dependent born - oppenheimer approximation involves two limits .",
    "if the electrons are initially in the eigenstate @xmath30 of the @xmath31-th band with energy @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the approximate initial configuration of the nuclei , then the @xmath31-th band is adiabatically protected provided there is an energy gap separating it from the rest of the spectrum .",
    "thus at later times , up to small error , the electronic wave function is still in the subspace corresponding to the @xmath31-th band . but",
    "this implies that the nuclei are governed by the born - oppenheimer hamiltonian @xmath34 since @xmath35 , @xmath36 can be analyzed through semiclassical methods where to leading order the contributions come from the classical flow @xmath37 corresponding to the classical hamiltonian @xmath38 on nucleonic phase space .    in general",

    ", @xmath40 , in nucleonic configuration space , such that @xmath41 restricted to @xmath42 does not cross or touch any other energy band .",
    "the classical flow @xmath37 then has @xmath43 as phase space and is defined only up to the time when it first hits the boundary @xmath44 .",

    "we carefully separate the space - adiabatic and the semiclassical limit .",
    "one immediate benefit is the generalization of the first order analysis of hagedorn from coherent states to arbitrary wave functions .",
    "let us explain our result for the space - adiabatic part in more detail .",
    "we assume that there is some region @xmath39 in the nucleonic configuration space , such that some subset @xmath51 of @xmath52 is separated from the remainder of the spectrum by a gap for all @xmath53 , i.e.@xmath54 @xmath42 could be punctured by small balls ( for @xmath55 ) because of band crossings .",
    "@xmath42 could also terminate because the point spectrum merges in the continuum , which physically means that the molecule loses an electron through ionization .",
    "let @xmath56 be the spectral projection of @xmath15 associated with @xmath51 and @xmath57 .",
    "we will establish that the unitary time evolution @xmath58 agrees on ran@xmath59 with the diagonal evolution @xmath60 generated by @xmath61 up to errors of order @xmath29 as long as the leaking through the boundary of @xmath42 is sufficiently small .    to complete the analysis one has to control the flow of the wave function through @xmath62 .",
    "one possibility is to simply avoid the problem by assuming that @xmath63 , hence @xmath64 .",
    "we will refer to this case as a _ globally isolated _ band .",
    "of course , the set @xmath65 may contain arbitrary band crossings .",
    "as one of our main results , we prove that the subspace ran@xmath59 is adiabatically protected .",
    "in particular for the purpose of studying band crossings the full molecular hamiltonian may be replaced by a simplified model with two bands only .",
    "in general one has @xmath66 , to which we refer as a _ locally isolated _ band . to estimate the flow out of @xmath42 the only technique available seems to be semiclassical analysis . but",
    "this requires a control over the semiclassical evolution , for which one needs , at present , that @xmath67 contains no band crossings .",
    "then @xmath68 is the disjoint union of possibly degenerate energy bands @xmath21 .",
    "we will prove that each band separately is adiabatically protected .",
    "[ f2 ]    in the special case where @xmath69 is a nondegenerate eigenvalue for @xmath53 , @xmath60 is well approximated through @xmath70 on @xmath71 .",
    "since @xmath36 is a standard semiclassical operator , one can easily control the @xmath16-support of the wave function and therefore prove a result for rather general @xmath72 , for the details see theorem [ mt ] .",
    "roughly speaking , it says that if @xmath73 is a solution of the effective schrdinger equation for the nuclei @xmath74 with supp@xmath75 , then , modulo an error of order @xmath29 , @xmath76 is a solution of the full schrdinger equation ( [ se2 ] ) with initial condition @xmath77 as long as @xmath78 is supported in @xmath42 up to @xmath49-mass of order @xmath29 .",
    "this maximal time span can be computed using the classical flow @xmath37 .",
    "as first observed by mead and truhlar @xcite , in general @xmath36 acquires as a first order correction an additional vector potential @xmath79 and ( [ bohi ] ) has to be replaced by @xmath80 multiplying @xmath81 with a smooth @xmath16-dependent phase factor induces a gauge transformation for @xmath82 , which implies that the physical predictions based on ( [ bohii ] ) do not change , as it should be . as noticed in @xcite ,",
    "if @xmath42 is not contractible , then @xmath82 can not be removed through a gauge transformation and ( [ bohii ] ) and ( [ bohi ] ) describe different physics .",
    "berry realized that geometric phases appear whenever the hamiltonian has slowly changing parameters .",
    "therefore @xmath83 is referred to as berry connection , cf .",
    "@xcite for an instructive collection of reprints .",
    "in fact , the motion of nuclei as governed by the born - oppenheimer hamiltonian ( [ bohii ] ) is one of the paradigmatic examples for geometric phases .    if @xmath84 is @xmath4-fold degenerate , not much of the above analysis changes .",
    "@xmath36 becomes matrix - valued and acts on @xmath85 , i.e.@xmath86 the connection @xmath83 contains in general also off - diagonal terms and matrix - valued semiclassics must be applied .",
    "however , since the only nondiagonal term is in the subprincipal symbol , the leading order semiclassical analysis reduces to the scalar case and , in particular , agrees with the nondegenerate band case .",
    "we do not carry out the straightforward extension of theorem [ mt ] below to the degenerate band case , because the technicalities of matrix - valued semiclassics would obscure the simple ideas behind our analysis .",
    "in their recent work @xcite martinez and sordoni independently study the time - dependent born - oppenheimer approximation as based on techniques developed by nenciu and sordoni @xcite .",
    "they consider the case of a globally isolated band for a hamiltonian of the form ( [ sbo1 ] ) with smooth @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "they succeed in proving the adiabatic decoupling to any order in @xmath29 for subspaces @xmath89 which are @xmath29-close to the unperturbed subspaces",
    "@xmath59 considered by us . with this result , in principle , higher order corrections to the effective hamiltonian ( [ bohi ] ) could be computed .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 contains the precise formulation of the results .",
    "section 3 gives a short discussion of the semiclassical limit of @xmath36 and on how such results extend to the full molecular system .",
    "proofs are provided in section 4 . in spirit",
    "they rely on techniques developed in @xcite in the context of the semiclassical limit for dressed electron states . in practice",
    "the born - oppenheimer approximation requires several novel constructions , since the `` perturbation '' @xmath90 increases quadratically .",
    "our results can be formulated and proved in a more general framework dealing with , possibly time - dependent , perturbations of fibered operators . also the gap condition can be removed by using arguments similar to those developed by avron and elgart in @xcite .",
    "the general operator theoretical results will appear elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the specific form ( [ sbo3 ] ) of the electronic part of the hamiltonian will be of no importance in the following .",
    "thus we only assume that @xmath91 where @xmath92 is self - adjoint on some dense domain @xmath93 and bounded from below and @xmath94 is a continuous family of self - adjoint operators , bounded uniformly for @xmath95 .",
