    "the ee for 1d critical states is known to receive a logarithmic correction proportional to the central charge of the associated conformal field theory ( cft ) @xcite .",
    "the fact that entanglement is a resource for quantum computation @xcite can be reversed , to state that it is the limiting feature for many numerical methods designed to study quantum many - body problems @xcite , such as the density matrix renormalizartion group ( dmrg ) @xcite .",

    "for example , for a 1d translation - invariant system in real space , the minimax entropy block will contain no holes , and the optimal permutation will follow the 1d structure . for the xxz model in momentum space",
    "we conjecture that the minimax entropy takes place for the energy blocks around the fermi surface .",
