    "in condensed matter physics non - equilibrium problems have attracted increasing interest in recent years . despite many advances , describing those problems accurately in the presence of strong correlations remains a formidable challenge even today .",
    "the physics is often involved and the number of available non - equilibrium many - body methods allowing for a controlled access beyond plain perturbation theory is limited . furthermore , each of those has its own advantages and shortcomings .",
    "an alternative way to gain insights into the interplay of non - equilibrium and correlations is to identify non - equilibrium problems which can largely be understood in terms of their equilibrium physics ; compared to non - equilibrium , the latter is frequently rather well understood .",
    "generally , scrutinizing under which conditions such a reduction in complexity can be applied , is of importance to draw a more complete picture .",
    "here we conduct such a study for the non - equilibrium physics of so called quantum quenches in quantum impurity problems .    as they provide a basic probe of the non - equilibrium dynamics of many - body quantum systems , quantum quenches have been of great interest recently .",
    "this development is motivated by the progress of experiments with ultra - cold atoms in a tunable potential .",
    "@xcite at time @xmath2 , the system is suddenly brought far from equilibrium by abruptly changing a control parameter , and is subsequently left to evolve unitarily .",
    "_ global _ quenches , for which the control parameter is quenched throughout the entire system , correspond to injecting an extensive amount of energy , thereby allowing one to address the intriguing issues of thermalization and non - equilibrium steady - states in closed many - body quantum systems .",
    "@xcite _ local _ quantum quenches , for which the sudden change is restricted in space ,  @xcite allow one to investigate the energy propagation .",
    "one might expect that for large times only the low - energy excitations matter and the non - equilibrium dynamics shows universality , provided the system in equilibrium has this property .",
    "we here provide evidence that for several quantum impurity problems this is indeed the case . in this work ,",
    "we study a particular class of local quantum quenches : at time @xmath2 , two independent metallic reservoirs are either directly tunnel - coupled or coupled through a single - level quantum dot and left to evolve unitarily following the schrdinger equation .",
    "in addition , we investigate the quench dynamics after abruptly tunnel coupling a single lead to a quantum dot .",
    "a quantum quench of this type has recently been realized experimentally exploiting the optical absorption of a semiconductor quantum dot .",
    "@xcite in equilibrium , the considered impurity setups are characterized by a low - energy scale @xmath0 , the kondo temperature .    from a theory perspective",
    ", it was argued  @xcite based on general considerations and explicit computations for a non - interacting impurity problem , that the energy scale @xmath0 characterizes a crossover in the post - quench dynamics , with the long - time behavior being essentially controlled by the low - energy properties of the hamiltonian after the quench . for the considered type of local quench , one can expect that the same holds also in the presence of two - particle interactions .",
    "we focus on parameter regimes in which the sub - system coupling ( weak link or dot ) is a relevant perturbation in the renormalization group ( rg ) sense in equilibrium , and therefore drastically alters the low - energy properties of the system . the explicit non - interacting result of ref .   and the expectation for interacting systems can thus be interpreted as follows : time essentially acts as the inverse of an energy scale , and the post - quench dynamics effectively follows the rg flow . at large times , the system ` heals ' itself so that the quantum impurity becomes strongly hybridized with the lead(s ) .     via different contacts .",
    "we focus on two different of such geometries : ( a ) coupling the reservoirs indirectly by a single level quantum dot and ( c ) connecting the two chains directly by a weak link , respectively .",
    "furthermore , we consider the setup ( b ) in which a single lead is coupled to a single level quantum dot . the subsequent out - of - equilibrium dynamics is analyzed.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    because of the energy scale @xmath0 that breaks conformal invariance , many of the analytical results on local quenches from conformal field theory  @xcite can not be used .",
    "it is in general very difficult to provide closed analytical expressions for the time evolution of observables showing the full crossover , even for formally exactly solvable ( ` integrable ' ) or non - interacting systems .",
    "however , if the above scenario holds , one can expect that the post - quench dynamics is universal in the sense that every observable only depends on @xmath1 ( in the absence of any other energy scale ) and that the long - time regime @xmath3 can be described using boundary conformal field theory ( bcft ) . in this manuscript",
    ", we investigate numerically whether this is indeed the case for various interacting quantum impurity setups , using a combination of density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg )  @xcite and functional renormalization group ( frg )  @xcite methods .",
    "we focus on two key observables : the entanglement entropy between sub - systems , whose long - time behavior reduces to the cft prediction of refs .",
    "( see ref .   for a similar observation ) , and the time dependent fidelity or loschmidt echo , whose long - time behavior carries signatures of the effective boundary condition felt by the lead(s ) .",
    "the latter is induced by the screened impurity .",
    "the loschmidt echo is related to the equilibrium anderson orthogonality catastrophe  @xcite and is of particular interest since it can be linked to the fourier transform of the absorption spectrum measured in a recent experiment .",
    "@xcite in all the examples considered , we find that the field theory predictions describe reasonably well the dynamics of the microscopic models under scrutiny .    the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "2 we introduce the different models and observables studied , along with the analytical and numerical methods used in our analysis .",
    "section 3 contains a detailed discussion of the so - called interacting resonant level model ( irlm ) , the arguably simplest interacting impurity model with spinless non - interacting fermi liquid leads . in sect .",

    "the alleged simple replacement of equilibrium energy scales such as temperature by inverse time in standard rg arguments is obviously very specific to the considered type of _ local _ quenches . within field theory on a technical level it is linked to the possibility of ` folding ' and the subsequent use of bcft .",
