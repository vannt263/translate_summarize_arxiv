    "a number of radio galaxies have been observed to emit diffuse x - rays in the region between the nucleus and radio hot spots in recent years .",

    "has long been anticipated since the discovery of cmb ( e.g. , felten & rees 1967 ) .",
    "since the increase in the cmb energy density with redshift ( @xmath10 ) compensates for the cosmological surface brightness dimming , this extended emission has been seen at both low and high redshift , and has been used as a probe of the relativistic plasma in the lobe .",
    "combined with radio observations , this emission provides constraints on the magnetic field and on the energy distribution among the relativistic particles , or both . while electrons with @xmath11 to emit ghz synchrotron radiation ( for typical magnetic fields of a few @xmath12 g ) , it requires @xmath9 to upscatter the cmb photons to the observed @xmath13 kev range in x - rays .",
    "the simultaneous radiation in two different wavelengths caused by the same parent electron population provides an excellent opportunity to probe the physical nature of the radiating object . comparing",
    "the x - ray and radio emission from lobes , blundell ( 2006 ) showed that the injected electron energy distribution have a low - energy turn - over at @xmath14 , since the x - ray bright regions did not coincide with the radio hot spots .",
    "the comparison between x - ray and radio studies also shed light on the magnetic field .",
    "croston ( 2005 ) argued that the inferred magnetic field strength is close to the equipartition value ( lying between @xmath15 times the equipartition value ) .    in this paper",
    ", we use a variant of a model of emission from frii radio galaxies advocated by kaiser & alexander ( 1997 ) ( hereafter ka97 ) and kaiser , dennett - thorpe & alexander ( 1997 ) ( hereafter kda97 ) to study the evolution of x - ray power and surface brightness with time , and as functions of the radio lobe size , ambient density , redshift and the jet power .",
    "we do not assume self - similarity of the evolution of the radio lobe assumed by ka97 and kda97 , in order to study the effect of the cessation of jet activity on the x - ray surface brightness .",
    "the evolution of radio lobes after the stopping of jets has been discussed by komissarov & gubanov ( 1994 ) , although they did not address the soft x - ray emission by old electrons .",

    "the jets produce strong shocks where the jet particles are accelerated and these particles made the cocoon expand .",
    "the density distribution in the ambient medium is assumed to be a power - law , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the density at a core radius @xmath18 . if the jet power is denoted by @xmath19 , then the combination @xmath20 has the dimension of length , and , in a self - similar model , it is proportional to the length of the jet , @xmath21 ( falle 1991 ) .",

    ", we can not use the self - similar evolution assumed in kda97 .",
    "instead , we calculate the size evolution the radio lobe in the following way that captures the basic physical processes in a simple manner .    following the standard evolutionary picture ( scheuer 1974 ; begelman & cioffi 1989 , reynolds & begelman 1997 ) , that radio jets inject relativistic particles into a cocoon , which is overpressured ( nath 1995 ) and drive a strong shock into the ambient medium .",

    "observations of individual galaxies show @xmath50 to be in the range of @xmath57 g cm@xmath6 ( fukazawa 2004 ) , whereas jetha ( 2007 ) inferred @xmath58 g cm@xmath6 in group environments , although these determinations assume @xmath59 . for simplicity , because of the ability of combining two free parameters ( @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) into one ( @xmath50 ) , we assume a value of @xmath49 for our calculations .    solving equations [ eq : dyn ] , we can therefore determine the cocoon pressure @xmath39 at any instant , from which we determine an equipartition value of magnetic field , using eqn ( [ eq : magfrac ] ) . assuming ( as in kda97 ) a ratio @xmath34 between particle and magnetic field energy density .",
    "the corresponding electron energy density is then given by @xmath60 , assuming that there is no thermal particles in the cocoon ( i.e. , in the language of kda97 , @xmath61 ) .",
    "in the kda97 model , particles are assumed to be injected at the termination point of the jet . in our case , after the jet stops , the injection of particles also stops , and so the integration in the equation ( [ eq : synint ] ) , for the determination of radio power at a given time @xmath35 , has an upper limit of @xmath62 . to perform this integration , we rewrite the equation for volume segments ( eqn ( [ eq : kdavol ] ) ) which in the kda97 model used the exponent @xmath63 for self - similar evolution of cocoons . for @xmath64 ,",
    "any small volume segment of the cocoon at a a given instant @xmath35 can be related to the pressure at the time ( @xmath65 ) when the electrons in this segment were injected into the cocoon .",
    "one can rewrite equation ( [ eq : kdavol ] ) in the kda97 model as ( for @xmath66 ) v(t)=(_c -1 ) q_j p_c(t_i ) ( 4 r^2)^(1-_c)/_c ( p_c(t ) p_c(t_i ) ) ^1/_c t_i .",

    "here @xmath67 is the cmb photon energy density , @xmath68 is the thomson cross - section , @xmath69 is the electron mass and @xmath70 is the speed of light .",
    "thus , beginning with an initial energy distribution law with a power - law index @xmath71 , one can solve for the energy distribution at any given time , @xmath33 , given the initial distribution , @xmath72 .",
    "note that this was analytically done by kda97 for a self - similar evolution of the cocoon , and we explicitly solve it in order to go beyond self - similarity .    using this knowledge of @xmath33 , we can then use equation ( [ eq : syn ] ) in conjunction with eqn ( [ eq : kdavol2 ] ) , and integrate over time to calculate the radio power at a given frequency and at a given instant .",
    "we extend this formalism further to determine the inverse - compton ( ic ) emission as a function of time .",
    "firstly , we note that electrons with lorentz factor @xmath73 boosts a cmb photon of frequency @xmath74 into an energy @xmath75 .",
    "the precise calculation of the ic power for this photon would require one to consider the total spectrum of cmb photons .",
    "but we can simplify it for our purpose here by assuming all cmb photons to have a single frequency .",
    "we assume that the cmb photon distribution function is given by @xmath76 , where the normalizing factor @xmath77 can be calculated by requiring that total energy density @xmath78 , and one has @xmath79 .",
    "the total scattered power depends on the integral ( see equation ( 7.29a ) in rybicki & lightman 1979 ) , i=d v ( ) ^ p-1 2 = a t_cmb ^3 k_b ( k_b t_cmb)^(p-1)/2 .",
    "if one had used the blackbody distribution function @xmath80 , then the corresponding integral would have yielded ( see equation 7.31 in rybicki and lightman 1979 ) , i = d v ( ) ^p-1 2 = 8 h^3 c^3 ( k_b t_cmb)^p+5 2 ( p+5 2 ) ( p + 5 2 ) , where the symbols have the standard meanings",
    ". then the ratio , = ^4 15 1 ( p+5 2 ) ( p + 5 2 ) , shows the error one incurs in assuming all cmb photons to have the peak frequency in estimating the inverse compton power . for @xmath81 ,",
    "one finds @xmath82 .",
    "therefore the total scattered power calculated using this assumption is correct within an accuracy of 60% , and we adopt it for simplicity in our calculation .",
    "we therefore calculate the ic power at a given frequency , in the manner of previous eqn ( [ eq : syn ] ) , as , p_ic , = _ 0 ^ 1 6 _ t c",

    "not all volume elements in the cocoon would contribute to the ic radiated power though .",
    "electrons in some volume element that was injected at an earlier time @xmath65 may lose energy to the extent that they fail to boost cmb photons to the observed x - ray band .",
    "these volume elements would not contribute to the x - ray power .",
    "we calculate the total projected area of the cocoons that contribute to x - ray power , assuming the cocoon to be in the plane of the sky , and an axial ratio @xmath23 .",
    "this allows us to calculate the x - ray surface brightness .",
    "we also calculate the fraction @xmath83 of the total surface area of the cocoon that contributes to x - ray emission .",
    "to begin with , as a fiducial case , we consider @xmath84 erg s@xmath6 , @xmath85 g cm@xmath6 at @xmath86 , and a constant axial ratio @xmath87 .",
    "following kda97 , we also adopt @xmath88 and @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "we refer to this set of parameters as case i.    = 0.5    -3 mm    the set of thick lines in figure 1 show the results for this fiducial case .",

    "the corresponding evolution of the ratio of synchrotron to ic power with cocoon size is shown in the bottom - right panel .",
    "the solid lines show the case for @xmath92 yr , and dotted and dashed lines show the cases @xmath93 and @xmath94 yr , respectively .    in the same figure",
    ", we also show the results of another case , with a higher jet power and one located at a higher redshift than in the fiducial case .",
    "the thin set of lines in figure 1 show the case with @xmath95 erg s@xmath6 at @xmath96 ( case ii ) , keeping the values of other parameters the same .",
    "the evolution of the size of the cocoon is self - similar , as expected , till @xmath97 ( top left panel of figure 1 ) , after which the cocoon size expands slower than before .",
    "the radio luminosity as a function of time ( top - right panel ) is comparable to the results of kda97 for the case of @xmath98 yr , with sources at higher redshift dimming faster than their low redshift counterparts because of inverse compton loss . for shorter jet lifetime ,",
    "the radio luminosity drops precipitously after @xmath99 .",
    "this is mainly driven by rapidly declining pressure inside the cocoon owing to adiabatic expansion .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of the cocoon at 1 kev ( bottom - left panel of figure 1 ) increases till @xmath100 , as high energy electrons lose energy ( @xmath101 ) and enter the energy bins that are conducive for inverse compton scattering cmb photons to the soft x - ray band .",
    "the number of electrons with lorentz factors @xmath102 increase because the draining of these electrons to lower energy bins is more than compensated by the supply of energetic electrons from the jet .",
    "but after the jet stops , no new electrons are supplied to the cocoon , and the x - ray power drops rapidly ( more so at high redshifts ) .",
    "the time scale for inverse compton loss is @xmath103 yr for @xmath9 at present epoch .",
    "the time scale for the drop in x - ray power is made shorter than this by the additional loss of energy from adiabatic expansion of the cocoon .",
    "it is clear from curves in figure 1 that the stopping of the jet activity has a profound effect on the x - ray power that would have been missed in a calculation with self - similar evolution of cocoons .",
    "self - similar models would have predicted a rising x - ray power , although the rate of increase would have tapered beyond a time - scale @xmath104 , because the loss of electron energy would have been continually compensated by injection of new and energetic electrons . in the case of jet stopping after @xmath42 , this privilege is withdrawn from the cocoons and their x - ray power rapidly diminishes with time .",
    "the ratio of x - ray to radio power ( bottom - right panel ) , therefore , shows a mild increase till @xmath42 , after which it increases rapidly , because of the drop in radio luminosities .",
    "we note that , typically the value of the ratio at @xmath97 is of order @xmath105 . for a single power law electron energy distribution with index @xmath106 , where @xmath107 is the synchrotron ( and inverse compton ) radiation spectral index ,",
    "the ratio of relative luminosities can be written in terms of the strength of the magnetic field and the cmb temperature . for @xmath108 , we have ( e.g. tucker 1977 ) , 4.7 10 ^ -11 ( t_cmb 2.73 k ) ^3 + ( b 10 g ) ^-(+1 ) where the coefficient is @xmath109 for @xmath110 , and @xmath111 for @xmath112 .",
    "these values are somewhat lower than predicted from our detailed calculations , which take into account the electron energy distribution in different parts of the cocoon as they evolve . although the magnetic field strength throughout the cocoon is assumed to the same at any given time , the difference in the evolution of electron energy spectrum in different parts of the cocoon can give rise to a value of the ratio @xmath113 that is different from the above simple estimate . admittedly , the flux ratio is mainly driven by magnetic field , which is what the above simple estimate indicates , but our calculations show the important role played by the evolution of electron spectrum prior to the observed epoch for an object .    the observed ratios of fluxes at 1 kev and 178 mhz fall in the range of @xmath114 , for objects with a variety of linear sizes and at different redshifts ( e.g. , 3c 215 ( @xmath115 ) , 3c 334 ( @xmath116 ) , 3c 9 ( @xmath117 ) ( bridle 1994 ) , 3c 219 ( @xmath118 ) ( perley 1980 ) , 3c 265 ( @xmath119 ) ( bondi 2004 ) , 3c 109 ( @xmath120 ) ( giovannini 1994 ) , 3c 179 ( @xmath121 ) ( sambruna 2002 ) ) .",
    "we indicate this range by two dot - dashed lines in the figure .",
    "since the evolution of this ratio depends on many parameters ( as listed in table 1 , for example ) , our goal in this paper is not to reproduce all the observed parameters , but to probe whether or not the model yields representative values consistent with observations .",
    "it is apparent from the figure that the observed range of ratios are mostly consistent with model predictions for different parameters .",
    "it also appears that the observed range is _ not _ related to the rapidly rising part of the evolutionary curves . in other words , the systems observed in x - ray ( near 1 kev )",
    "should also be radio bright at low frequencies , of order @xmath122 mhz , that we have used for our calculations ( @xmath123 mhz ) .",
    "low frequency radio observations therefore should be an important probe of x - ray bright cocoons , as has been pointed out by previous authors .",
    "another aspect is that cocoons spend a relatively short time in the rapidly rising parts of the curves for ratio between @xmath113 , because of the precipitous drop in radio luminosity after @xmath42 . in other words ,",
    "radio galaxies that have faded from the window of frequencies of order a few hundred mhz , are unlikely to be x - ray bright , since the x - ray power would also drop ( see bottom - left panel of figure 1 ) .",
    "= 0.5    -3 mm    next , we plot in figure 2 the corresponding flux in the 1 - 5 kev band ( top left panel ) for the cases shown in figure 1 .",
    "our results show that for the parameters used here the cocoons typically emit at a flux of @xmath124 erg s@xmath125 @xmath5 per kev ( or a few micro - crab ) before dropping after @xmath42 , consistent with observed fluxes ( see , e.g. , laskar 2010 ) .",
    "we also need to consider the x - ray surface brightness apart from the total flux .",
    "we calculate the total area of the x - ray bright region of the cocoon , by summing over the volume elements in which electrons contribute to the x - ray emission in the 1 - 5 kev band , and projecting in the plane of the sky .",
    "this is shown in the bottom - left panel of figure 2 , which suggests that for cocoons larger than @xmath126 kpc , typically a patch as large as tens of arcseconds would be x - ray bright .",
    "if one estimates the fraction of the cocoon area that is x - ray bright , this fraction initially rises ( till @xmath42 ) to @xmath127 of the total area ( assuming the cocoon the projected in the plane of the sky ) , and then drops .",
    "this calculation of the angular size of the x - ray bright region of the cocoon allows us to estimate an average x - ray surface brightness of the cocoon , and we show the results in the top - right panel of figure 2 , for the same cases as mentioned earlier .",
    "the surface brightness ( in the 1 - 5 kev band ) initially drops in a gradual manner , owing to two competing effects : increasing x - ray luminosity and an increasing portion of the cocoons which are illuminated by x - ray .",
    "but the it drops rapidly after @xmath42 , especially at high redshift .",
    "another important probe of x - ray bright cocoons is the x - ray spectral index .",
    "we calculate the photon index @xmath128 in the 1 - 5 kev band for the same cases , and the results are shown in the bottom - right panel of figure 2 .",
    "we also include data points for a number of cases which have been observed long enough for spectrum determination .",
    "we have estimated the cocoon angular size from visual inspection from the observations cited in the caption , assuming the cocoons to be projected in the plane of the sky , and estimated the physical size assuming a @xmath50-cdm cosmology with @xmath129 .",
    "the error bars on the data points are large , but there appears to be a trend of decreasing photon index with increasing cocoon size : larger cocoons show flatter x - ray spectrum .",
    "our model predictions show that initially the x - ray spectrum gradually gets flatter ( smaller value of @xmath130 ) till @xmath100 .",
    "this is because of the fact that for electrons @xmath0 , the injection of fresh particles mitigates the radiative steepening of electron spectrum .",
    "the injection of electrons from the jet compensates for synchrotron energy losses for electrons with @xmath9 , where two relevant time scales become comparable : ( a ) the jet lifetime ( @xmath131 yr ) and the ( b ) inverse compton cooling time scale of electrons with @xmath9 ( @xmath132 yr at present cosmological epoch ) .",
    "this energy scale ( corresponding to @xmath133 ) also happens to be the one required to upscatter cmb photons to kev range .",
    "the concurrence of these two timescales produces a temporary hardening of the soft x - ray spectrum .",
    "then , after the jet stops , the number of electrons at this energy scale rapidly decreases because of inverse compton and adiabatic loss , and the spectrum becomes soft again .",
    "this softening occurs rapidly at high redshift , as expected from increasing inverse compton loss . with regard to some of the data points with large cocoons and @xmath134",

    "the x - ray properties of cocoon also depend on the ambient density ( here parametrized as @xmath50 ) and the lower cutoff in the electron energy distribution ( @xmath31 ) . to study the effect of these parameters , we first plot in figure 3 ( with solid lines ) the results for a fiducial case ( case iii ) : @xmath95 erg s@xmath6 , @xmath137 , @xmath92 yr , and @xmath85 g cm@xmath6 , @xmath91 .",
    "in this section we will study the effect of changing the values of @xmath138 separately , and compare with the results for our fiducial case .",
    "we will not vary the redshift and the jet life time , as the discussion in the previous section has already considered the effects of changing these parameters .",
    "also , we keep @xmath32 fixed at @xmath139 , and we do not change the values of @xmath71 and @xmath34 .    in figure 3 , we have plotted the x - ray flux ( in 1 - 5 kev band ; top - left panel ) , ratio between x - ray and radio power ( top - right panel ) , x - ray surface brightness ( in 1 - 5 kev ; bottom - left panel ) , and the photon index ( @xmath130 ) in the bottom - right panel .",

    "the ratio of x - ray to radio power does not change , however , but the surface brightness increases .",
    "the photon index continues to decrease and the x - ray spectrum becomes harder with time ( and size ) for @xmath97 after which it becomes softer .",
    "next , we change the value of @xmath31 to @xmath141 ( keeping all other values same as in the fiducial case ) , and the results are shown with short - dashed lines .",
    "increasing the lower cutoff results in increasing the number density of electrons for a given total energy in the cocoon , and produces a larger x - ray flux and surface brightness .",
    "but since there are more electrons with high energy in this case compared to the fiducial case , they also lose energy faster , and consequently , the drop in x - ray power after the stopping of the jet is faster than in the fiducial case .",
    "interestingly , the increasing of @xmath31 does not effect the the x - ray to radio power ratio and the x - ray photon index .",
    "( it would , if the lower cutoff were to increase beyond @xmath142 . )",
    "finally , we change the ambient density to @xmath143 g cm@xmath6 that is indicative of a dense environment .",
    "the results are shown with long - dashed lines , and they show that the radio cocoon is constrained to remain small in size in this case . this results in not allowing the cocoon pressure ( and magnetic field ) to decrease fast enough , so that electrons are made to lose energy faster through synchrotron radiation .",
    "both x - ray and radio power drop rapidly in this case and the ratio between x - ray to radio power also decreases ( although , since the curves are drawn as functions of @xmath144 , the rapid decrease is not apparent from the figures ) .",
    "the photon index also hardens faster than in the fiducial case .",
    "this implies that it would be difficult to detect x - ray bright cocoons in dense environments like galaxy clusters , although it would be difficult to observe them anyway because of the bright x - ray emission from the intracluster gas .",
    "= 0.5    -3 mm    the x - ray fluxes shown in the top - left panel of figure 3 suggest that for typical radio galaxy parameters as used here , the cocoons shine in soft x - rays with a flux of @xmath13 micro - crab , or , @xmath145 erg @xmath5 s@xmath6 per kev , before dropping to lower values after @xmath42 .",
    "curves in the top - right panel of figure 3 show that the ratio of x - ray to radio power is a robust parameter , in the sense that it does not vary with changes in @xmath31 and jet power at fixed times .",
    "the curves are plotted against@xmath144 , but the kink in the curves due to the stopping of jet occurs for all curves at the same time , namely , @xmath42 , and a comparison of the solid , short dashed ( which happens to be superposed on the solid curve ) and the dotted curves show that the ratio is a robust parameter .",
    "it does vary with redshift ( as we have seen in figure 1 ) and with ambient density ( long dashed line in figure 3 ) .",
    "this robustness allows us to use this parameter to characterize the connection between radio and x - ray properties of cocoons , and we will discuss this issue further in the next section .",
    "our results show that many of the x - ray properties of fr - ii radio galaxy cocoons vary substantially with time , even when all other parameters such as jet power , ambient density and others are kept constant .",
    "it is therefore not easy to predict the x - ray properties of these sources that can be tested with observations , because it is difficult to determine the age of these sources from radio or other observations .",
    "one can however use the fact that the evolutionary time - scale of radio galaxies , of order a few hundred myr , is much shorter than the hubble time , even at redshifts when the radio galaxy population peaked in number density ( @xmath146 ) .",
    "this implies that one can use time - averaged quantities related to x - ray emission , and speculate upon their average properties that could be observed and tested .    in particular",
    ", we would like to determine the average property of the ratio of luminosities in x - ray and radio frequencies , @xmath147 of the sources under consideration , averaged over time until their x - ray or radio emission drops rapidly : @xmath148 .",
    "our results ( figure 3 , top - right panel ) shows that this ratio of luminosities is a robust parameter , and it varies negligibly with the variations in jet power , lower cut - off in @xmath73 , although it varies strongly with changes in ambient density .",
    "this ratio is however likely to increase with redshift , and we wish to determine the scaling with redshift .",
    "we therefore compute the x - ray luminosity @xmath149 in the 1 - 5 kev band , and we choose a radio frequency of @xmath150 mhz to compute @xmath151 .",
    "we compute a time - average of this ratio , summing over the duration in which the sources are both x - ray and radio bright in these frequencies ( in the source frame ) .",
    "celotti & fabian ( 2004 ) have discussed the significance of this ratio of x - ray and radio luminosities in the case of radiation from electrons with a single power law energy distribution . in this case , this ratio can be written as , = u_cmb u_b ( _ x _ b _ r _ cmb ) ^1- ( 1+z)^3 + , where @xmath107 is the radio spectral index , @xmath152 and @xmath153 are the energy density in cmb photons ( at @xmath154 ) and magnetic field , respectively .",

    ". the ratio increases with redshift , although the increase can be mitigated by the possibility that magnetic field may change with redshift .",
    "celotti & fabian chose a conservative value of unity for this ratio , at all redshifts , and discussed the possible implications .",

    "we show the evolution of the time - averaged ratio of x - ray and radio luminosities at the above mentioned frequencies ( in the source frame ) with redshift in figure 4 , for two values of @xmath108 ( solid line ) , and @xmath89 ( dotted line ) , the last choice of @xmath71 being motivated by kda97 .",
    "interestingly , the difference between these two initial values of @xmath71 is not large , and makes the time - averaged ratio of luminosities a robust quantity .",
    "we find that the case for @xmath108 can be fitted with a simple scaling with redshift , _",
    "( 1+z)^3.8 .",
    "the results of the two cases of different values of @xmath71 are different from the expectation from the simple formula mentioned above . the x - ray to radio luminosity increases with decreasing @xmath71 ( or increasing @xmath107 ) , especially at high redshift .",
    "this is because the increased population of high energy electrons ( for smaller values of @xmath71 ) rapidly lose energy , decreasing @xmath73 down to the level where they become x - ray bright , and this process become more efficient at high redshift .",
    "we are now in a position to estimate the number density of x - ray bright radio galaxy cocoons using the radio luminosity function of these sources , and using the above results for the relation between x - ray and radio emission .",
    "we use the radio luminosity function of fr - ii galaxies , as determined by willott ( 2001 ) from 3crr , 6ce and 7crs samples .",
    "this luminosity function was determined assuming a cosmological model with @xmath161 .",
    "we have converted it for the @xmath50-cdm cosmology with @xmath162 using the relation ( peacock 1985 ) , _ 1 ( p_1 , z ) dv_1 dz=_2 ( p_2 , z ) dv_2 dz [ eq : cos ] where @xmath163 is the luminosity derived in a specific cosmological model for a measured flux and at a given redshift @xmath164 , and the indices refer to the two different cosmological models .",

    "having done this , we have associated a diffuse x - ray luminosity to each fr - ii sources with the scaling result from the last section , and determined the x - ray luminosity function of fr - ii galaxies .",

    "the peak of the x - ray luminosity function shifts to increasing luminosity because of the strong redshift evolution of the x - ray to radio power ratio .",
    "we note that celotti & fabian ( 2004 ) assumed a constant ratio of unity and so their x - ray luminosity function peaked at the same luminosity at different redshifts ( their figure 3 ) .",
