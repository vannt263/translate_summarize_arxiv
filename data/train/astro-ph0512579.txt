    "there is large literature on gamma - ray burst ( grb ) afterglows based on the assumption that the x - ray , optical and radio afterglows are the synchrotron emission from relativistic electrons fermi accelerated at the forward shock of the blast wave ( see recent reviews by mszros 2002 ; zhang & mszros 2004 ) .",
    "a longstanding difficulty with this assumption has been the inferred magnetic field needed to fit the afterglow data typically requires that the magnetic energy density exceeds by many orders of magnitude that which would be expected from the shock compression of the interstellar magnetic field of the host galaxy ( gruzinov & waxman 1999 ; gruzinov 2001 ) .",
    "many authors have therefore assumed that the shock somehow manufactures field energy to meet this requirement , but no convincing mechanism has been proposed to date .",
    "one mechanism discussed is the weibel instability ( medvedev & loeb 1999 , silva et al .",
    "2003 ; frederiksen et al .",
    "2004 ; jaroschek et al .",
    "2005 ; medvedev et al .",
    "2005 ; kato 2005 ; nishikawa et al . 2005 ) , which has the fastest growth rate and produces relatively strong small scale magnetic field even in an initially non - magnetized plasma .",
    "it is expected that the thermalization of the upstream flow could occur via scattering of particles on the magnetic fluctuations . in the electron - positron plasma",
    ", the instability does generate the magnetic field at about 10% of the equipartition level and does provide the shock transition at the scale of a dozen of electron inertial length ( spitkovsky 2005 ) .",
    "however , simulations of colliding electron - proton flows show that while the electrons are readily isotropized , the protons acquire only small scattering in angles after passing the simulation box ( frederiksen et al .",
    "how long the field persists after the shock is also an important question ( gruzinov 2001 ) but here we discuss whether the weibel instability can even cause the shock in the first place .",
    "moiseev & sagdeev ( 1963 , see also sagdeev 1966 ) analyzed the structure of the nonrelativistic weibel driven shock and found that the width of the shock transition should be very large because electrons easily screen proton currents thus suppressing development of the instability .",
    "failure of the weibel instability to preempt other shock mechanisms , except for very large alfven mach numbers , has been discussed in the context of nonrelativistic shocks by blandford and eichler ( 1987 ) . here",
    "we estimate the width of the weibel driven shock in the ultra - relativistic electron - proton plasma . although based on a number of physical assumptions about the behavior of the plasma parameters at the non - linear stage of the weibel instability , such analytical scalings are necessary in any case , because , by evident reasons , simulations of plasmas are possible only with artificially low proton - to - electron mass ratios ( e.g. , frederiksen et al .",
    "( 2004 ) took @xmath0 ) .",
    "in this paper , we present the parameters in physically motivated dimensionless form and we believe that our assumptions could be checked by numerical simulations . only by combining numerical simulations with analytical scalings can we achieve reliable conclusions about the properties of real shocks .    as a model for the shock formation , we consider collision of two oppositely directed plasma flows . eventually two diverging shocks should be formed with plasma at rest between them .",
    "however at the initial stage , the two flows interpenetrate each other exciting turbulent electro - magnetic fields .",
    "particles are eventually thermalized by scattering off these turbulent fields .",
    "as electrons are thermalized relatively rapidly , we consider development of the weibel instability in two proton beams propagating through relativistically hot isotropic electron gas .",
    "we estimate the proton isotropization length in such a system and conclude that the weibel - mediated shocks are so wide that even in the interstellar medium , the shock should be formed at the scale of the larmor radius of the proton in the background magnetic field .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in sect.2",
    ", we find the growth rate of the proton weibel instability .",
    "saturation of the instability is considered in sect.3 . in sect.4",
    ", we exploit the obtained results in order to estimate the width of the weibel - mediated shock transition .",
    "section 5 contains the discussion .",
    "let us consider two proton beams of equal strength propagating in opposite directions along the @xmath1-axis .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , let us adopt the waterbag distribution function : @xmath2\\theta(p_{\\perp 0}^2-p_{\\perp}^2);\\label{distr}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the heaviside step function , @xmath4 .",
    "assume that the beams propagate through an isotropic relativistically hot electron plasma with the distribution function @xmath5 .",
    "this configuration is known to be unstable because a small transverse magnetic field @xmath6 would drive the oppositely moving protons into current layers of opposite sign , which reinforce the initial field ( see , e.g. , fig.1 in medvedev & loeb 1999 ) .",
    "evolution of the electromagnetic field is governed by maxwell s equations @xmath7 which are written in fourier space as @xmath8 note that only @xmath1 components of @xmath9 and @xmath10 are present in this configuration .",
    "the current density , @xmath11 , may be found from a solution to the linearized vlasov equation @xmath12\\ ] ] as @xmath13 as usual ( e.g. , krall & trivelpiece 1973 ) , the condition for the set of equations ( [ maxwell][current ] ) to have a nonzero solution yields the dispersion equation @xmath14;\\label{disp}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the susceptibility of the plasma species @xmath16 .    substituting the proton distribution function ( [ distr ] ) into eq.([suscept ] ) yields @xmath17@xmath18 where @xmath19 is the relativistic proton plasma frequency , @xmath20 . below only the strongly anisotropic , highly relativistic case is considered , @xmath21 , @xmath22 .",
    "then one can neglect the first term in the curly brackets .",
    "the susceptibility of isotropic electrons is written as @xmath23@xmath24@xmath25 here we used the spherical coordinates in the momentum space and the plemeli formula .",
    "the weibel instability operates in the low - frequency limit , @xmath26 . in this case",
    "the imaginary part of @xmath27 dominates because at @xmath28 , the principal value of the integral in @xmath29 goes to zero .",
    "the physical reason is that only electrons with small @xmath30 contribute to the susceptibility because other electrons `` see '' rapidly oscillating field as they move in @xmath31 direction over a distance larger than @xmath32 for the time @xmath33 .",
    "now one can write @xmath34 where @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",
    "the parameter @xmath37 is equal to the electron temperature if the electron spectrum is maxwellian and @xmath38 .",
    "note that in their analysis of the proton webel instability , wiersma & achterberg ( 2004 ) erroneously used the expression @xmath39 , which is valid only in the high frequency limit , @xmath40 , and therefore is irrelevant to the case of interest .",
    "now one can write the dispersion equation ( [ disp ] ) in the low - frequency limit : @xmath41 in the limit of negligible angular spread of the proton beams , @xmath42 , the dispersion equation is reduced to a simple cubic equation @xmath43 where @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 .",
    "the system is unstable provided @xmath47 . in the small- and long - wavelength limits ,",
    "the growth rate @xmath48 is found as @xmath49 the full solution to eq.([disp2 ] ) is shown in fig.1 .",
    "one can see that if @xmath50 , as one can expect within the shock structure , the most unstable are short - wave perturbations , @xmath51 .",
    "when the angular spread of the beams increases , the growth rate of the instability decreases ( fig.2 ) .",
    "the threshold of the instability may be easily found by substituting @xmath52 into eq.([disp1 ] ) ; this yields @xmath53 so at small wavelengths , where the growth rate is maximal , the instability stops after a small spread in the angular velocity distribution is achieved .",
    "the dispersion relation ( [ disp ] ) was found assuming that the particles are nonmagnetized , i.e. their trajectories are nearly straight .",
    "the instability saturates when this condition is violated either for protons or for electrons . as a result of the instability ,",
    "current filaments are formed along the direction of the proton motion .",
    "the magnetic field forms a sort of cocoon around these filaments and eventually traps protons within the filaments ; then the instability stops ( yang , arons & langdon 1994 ; wiersma & achterberg 2004 ) .",
    "the quiver motion of a proton within the current filament may be described by the linearized equation @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the proton displacement in the transverse direction . near the axis of the filament , the magnetic field",
    "may be written as @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the amplitude of the perturbation . then eq.([quiver ] ) describes oscillations in the transverse direction with the frequency @xmath58 and the ( growing ) amplitude @xmath59 .",
    "the proton is trapped within the filament when the oscillation amplitude becomes less than @xmath32 or , which is the same , frequency @xmath60 exceeds the growth rate of the instability , @xmath61 . this occurs when the magnetic field reaches the value @xmath62    one can consider electrons as non - magnetized if their larmor radius exceeds the characteristic scale of the unstable perturbation ( moiseev & sagdeev 1962 ; sagdeev 1966 ) .",
    "this condition is violated when the field reaches the value @xmath63 then the magnetic field becomes frozen into the electrons and the magnetic flux does not grow more .        .",
    "the obtained limits on the magnetic field are shown in fig.3 .",
    "the instability develops until the magnetic field @xmath64 is reached .",
    "one can see from fig.3 that the maximal field is achieved in perturbations with the wave number @xmath65 the corresponding wavelength is of the order of the inertial length of electrons .",
    "the energy of the generated field scales as the energy of electrons : @xmath66 within the shock structure , one can conveniently normalize the electron temperature as @xmath67 where @xmath68 is a dimensionless parameter ; @xmath69 means that the average electron energy remains the same as upstream of the shock .",
    "now one can estimate the fraction of the upstream kinetic energy transformed into the energy of the magnetic field as @xmath70",
    "when two oppositely directed plasma streams collide , the weibel instability generates small scale magnetic fields ; particle scattering off these magnetic fluctuations provides an isotropization mechanism necessary for the shock transition to form .",
    "the electron streaming is halted easily whereas protons still plow on through an isotropic electron gas .",
    "the shock is formed on the scale defined by slow diffusion of protons in the momentum space ( moiseev & sagdeev 1962 ; sagdeev 1966 ) .",
    "let us denote the transverse scale of the magnetic inhomogeneities by @xmath71 and the amplitude of magnetic fluctuations by @xmath72 .",
    "the proton is scattered over a characteristic correlation length by the angle @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the angle the proton makes with the flow direction . here",
    "we take into account that the weibel instability generates strongly elongated current filaments so that the proton passes the distance @xmath75 within the same filament ( of course @xmath76 and @xmath77 remain finite at @xmath78 however we are interested in isotropization scale , which is determined by @xmath79 ) .",
    "the angular diffusion coefficient is estimated as @xmath80 which yields the isotropization scale @xmath81 motivated by the estimates expressed in eqs .",
    "( [ k0 ] ) , ( [ b0 ] ) , and ( [ temp ] ) , we normalize the characteristic inhomogeneity scale , @xmath71 , and turbulent magnetic field amplitude , @xmath72 , as @xmath82 where @xmath68 , @xmath55 , and @xmath83 are dimensionless parameters .",
    "now the shock width may be expressed as @xmath84 the estimated shock width , @xmath85 , is thus very large compared to the proton inertial length @xmath86 assuming that the electron temperature as well as the scale and amplitude of the generated magnetic field do not exceed significantly their fiducial values , i.e. @xmath87 .",
    "we now explain why this is expected to be the case .",
    "if @xmath88 , then , although the shock width could then be brought down to the proton skin depth , this would beg the question of how the electrons are heated , which is merely passing along the question of a shock mechanism .",
    "similarly , we expect @xmath89 because we know of no reason to expect that magnetic field would grow above the limit ( [ b0 ] ) . on the contrary ,",
    "such a small - scale magnetic field should decay ( gruzinov 2001 ) .",
    "there are evidences for hierarchical merging of current filaments ( silva et al .",
    "2003 ; frederiksen et al .",
    "2004 ; medvedev et al 2005 ; kato 2005 ) so that @xmath83 might exceed unity . however , the merging should be accompanied by the field dissipation because the magnetic field between two parallel adjacent currents change sign and therefore should dissipate when the currents merge .",
    "so possible increase of @xmath83 would be compensated by decrease of @xmath55 . in any case , at the scale larger than the electron larmor radius , which is of the order of @xmath90 , the field is already frozen into the electron gas therefore @xmath83 could hardly ever grow significantly beyond unity .",
    "one should also take into account that the current filaments are unstable to a kink - like mode ( milosavljevi & nakar 2005 ) , which also stimulates the field decay .",
    "therefore we believe that there is no reason for the weibel - driven shock transition to be significantly narrower than eq.([shockwidth ] ) predicts .",
    "there is , however , reason to suspect that the transition is even more gradual than predicted by eq.([shockwidth ] ) ; this is decay of the small scale magnetic field .",
    "the highest resolution published simulations of shell collisions with @xmath0 ( frederiksen et al .",
    "2004 ) do show that while electrons are readily isotropized , the proton beams achieve only a small angular spread when passing the simulation box of the length @xmath91 .",
    "these simulations also show that the average electron energy does not grow so that our conjecture @xmath92 seems to be correct .",
    "the experiment duration , @xmath93 , was three times larger than the particle crossing time ; by the end of the simulations the spatial wavelength of the magnetic fluctuations achieved one half of the width of the simulation box . in physical units , this is written as @xmath94 ; @xmath95 so that @xmath96 .",
    "although one can not exclude that the pattern growth was frustrated by the finite size of the simulation box , we believe , by the reasons outlined above , that @xmath83 would not grow significantly in any case .    according to the estimate ( [ shockwidth ] ) ,",
    "the full shock transition is too wide to be simulated numerically even with a moderate mass ratio @xmath97 . on the other hand ,",
    "the scaling ( [ shockwidth ] ) may hardly be ever applied to the case @xmath98 because it was obtained under the assumption that the proton and electron scales are well separated , i.e. that @xmath99",
    ". therefore direct numerical check of this scaling is very difficult",
    ". nevertheless it would be very useful to follow behavior of the parameters @xmath68 , @xmath55 and @xmath83 in numerical simulations even with a low mass ratio .",
    "even 2.5d simulations of the proton weibel instability in the isotropic electron gas would clarify the behavior of these parameters in highly nonlinear regime .",
    "the estimate ( [ shockwidth ] ) was obtained under the assumption that there is no magnetic field in the upstream flow .",
    "if the flow is magnetized , a shock transition may be formed at the scale of the proton larmor radius ; therefore the above estimates are valid only if @xmath100 , where @xmath101 is the magnetic field in the upstream flow .",
    "one can conveniently characterize the magnetization of the flow by the parameter @xmath102 . making use of eq.([shockwidth ] )",
    ", one finds that the shock may be driven by the weibel instability if @xmath103 if the shock propagates through the interstellar medium , the magnetization exceeds the right - hand side of eq.([magnetization ] ) by factor about 30 : @xmath104 , where @xmath105 g is the interstellar magnetic field , @xmath106 @xmath107 the gas number density .",
    "this suggests that forward shocks that presumably produce grb afterglows are mediated not by the weibel instability but by the larmor rotation of protons in the background magnetic field .",
    "this does not mean that the weibel instability does not work at all .",
    "on the contrary , it does develop and may well create some small scale magnetic field that is much stronger than the background field . the scattering off these magnetic fluctuations results in diffusion of the protons in angles .",
    "however , because the scattering does not manage to isotropize the protons at the scale less than the larmor radius it is hard to see how the weibel instability could convert the kinetic energy to another forms .",
    "the strong dependence of the estimate ( [ maznetization ] ) on the parameters @xmath55 , @xmath68 , and @xmath83 makes accurate determination of their values , presumably by simulations , crucial to solidify this conclusion .",
    "the estimate ( [ magnetization ] ) shows that a fraction @xmath108 of the total energy is converted into the magnetic energy unless the electrons are heated additionally within the shock structure",
    ". the generated small - scale field should decay ( gruzinov 2001 ; milosavlevi & nakar 2005 ) so that @xmath109 may be even lower . according to panaitescu & kumar ( 2002 ) and yost et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , the observed spectra and light curves of the grb afterglows imply @xmath110 in most cases .",
    "eichler & waxman ( 2005 ) demonstrated that the above estimates may be rescaled such that the observations are fitted with values of @xmath109 that are smaller by an arbitrary factor @xmath111 , @xmath112 . taking this into account one",
    "can see that the weibel instability could provide the necessary field unless the field decay is too strong . on the other hand , as the global structure of the shock transition is dictated by the larmor rotation of the protons in the background field , some new physics could come into play .",
    "a presumably important physical mechanism is the synchrotron maser instability at the shock front .",
    "this instability generates semi - coherent , low - frequency electromagnetic waves ( gallant et al .",
    "1992 ; hoshino et al .",
    "1992 ; lyubarsky in preparation ) . in low magnetized flows , the amplitude of these waves exceeds the amplitude of the shock compressed background field .",
    "in this case , relativistic particles radiate in the field of the waves via nonlinear compton scattering ( e.g. , melrose 1980 , pp .",
    "136 - 141 ) .",
    "the power and characteristic frequencies of this emission are similar to those for synchrotron emission in the magnetic field of the same strength therefore the observed gamma ray bursts afterglows may be attributed to the nonlinear compton scattering off the electromagnetic waves generated by the synchrotron maser instability at the shock front .",
    "it is beyond the scope of this paper to redo afterglow theory with the spectrum of low frequency electromagnetic waves that is expected from this instability .",
