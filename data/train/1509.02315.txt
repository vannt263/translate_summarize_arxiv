    "in the linear elasticity theory of anisotropic materials , the relation between the strain tensor @xmath0 and the stress tensor @xmath1 , the generalized hooke s law , is expressed by the use of the elasticity ( stiffness ) tensor @xmath2 @xmath3 in 3-dimensional space , a generic 4th order tensor has 81 independent components .",
    "however , due to the standard symmetry assumptions for the stress and strain tensors , @xmath4 the elasticity tensor is left with 21 independent components only .",
    "these components are not really the intrinsic characteristics of the material because they depend on the choice of the coordinate system .",
    "thus , in order to deal with the proper material parameters , one must look for the _ invariants of the elasticity tensor_.    there are only two linearly independent invariants of the first order of @xmath5 .",
    "they are usually taken as follows , see @xcite , @xmath6 here and subsequently , we use the standard tensor conventions that strictly distinguish between covariant and contravariant indices . in these notations",
    ", two repeated indices can appear only in up - down positions and summation for only two such repeated indices is assumed .",
    "the indices of a tensor can be raised / lowered by the use of the metric tensor @xmath7 .",
    "for instance , the lower components of the elasticity tensor are defined as @xmath8 . since in the elasticity literature",
    "a simplified notation is frequently used , we provide both notations in most cases and relate the corresponding quantities by the sign @xmath9 , as in ( [ intro2 ] ) . notice that this shorthand notation is applicable only in euclidean space endowed with rectangular coordinates .",
    "quadratic invariants of the elasticity tensor were studied by ting @xcite .",
    "he presented two such invariants , @xmath10 ahmad @xcite has contributed the two additional quadratic invariants , @xmath11 he also proved that the set of seven quadratic invariants @xmath12 is linearly independent .",
    "norris @xcite studied the problem of the quadratic invariants and proved that the set ( [ intro5 ] ) is complete .",
    "it means that every quadratic invariant of the elasticity tensor is a linear combination of the seven invariants listed in ( [ intro5 ] ) . in order to prove this fact , norris presented a generic quadratic invariant in the form @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a numerical tensor and provided a detailed analysis of this tensor .",
    "it is proven that due to the symmetries ( [ intro2 ] ) , the most components of @xmath14 vanish and a lot of the remaining components are linearly related . this way ,",
    "exactly seven invariants are left over . in particular",
    ", norris demonstrated that a rather natural additional invariant @xmath15 can be in fact represented as a linear combination of the invariants listed in ( [ intro5 ] ) , namely @xmath16 in this situation , some principal questions arise :    * is there some preferable basis of quadratic invariants ?",
    "* is there a systematic way to construct such a basis ? * which quadratic invariants can be used as characteristic parameters for different elastic materials ? * which physical interpretation can be given to various quadratic invariants of the elasticity tensor ?",
    "in the current paper , we analyze the quadratic invariants problem in the framework of the unique irreducible decomposition of the elasticity tensor . in section 2",
    ", we present the principle algebraic facts of this decomposition .",
    "the key point that such resolution of the elasticity tensor in the simple pieces generates the direct sum reduction of the elasticity tensor space .",
    "the corresponding subspaces are completely independent and even orthogonal relative to the euclidean ( frobenius ) scalar product . in this framework",
    ", we construct in section 3 the basis set of seven quadratic invariants that emerge in a natural and systematic way . moreover the completeness of this basis and its independence of basis tensors follow immediately from the direct sum representation of the elasticity tensor space .",
    "we compare this basis to the basis given in ( [ intro5 ] ) . in section 4 ,",
    "we provide some applications of quadratic invariants to physics motivated problems .",
    "we define cauchy factor for an arbitrary anisotropic material .",
    "it can be used as a measure of deviation of a material from an analogical cauchy material .",
    "we also prove fedorov s relation for an isotropic material closest to an anisotropic one .",
    "this result follows immediately from the irreducible orthogonal decomposition .",
    "correspondingly , we define the isotropic factor that measures the closeness of an anisotropic material to its isotropic prototype . in section 5 , we study a simplest non - trivial example of cubic crystal .",
    "it is naturally represented by three independent quadratic invariants .",
    "this low - dimensional case allows the visualization of the cauchy and isotropic factors .",
    "corresponding graphs are presented . in conclusion section",
    "we present our main results and propose some possible direction for future investigations .",
    "to describe the irreducible decomposition of the elasticity tensor we first observe two groups acting on it simultaneously , see @xcite . for an arbitrary tensor of the range @xmath17 defined on @xmath18 , these are the permutation ( symmetry ) group @xmath19 and the group of rotations @xmath20",
    ".      the symmetry group @xmath21 provides permutations of the elasticity tensor indices .",
    "the decomposition of @xmath2 under this group is described by two young diagrams : @xmath22 all other 4-the order young s diagrams are non - relevant in our case due to the original symmetries ( [ intro2 ] ) of @xmath2 .",
    "the left - hand side of ( [ irr3 ] ) represents a generic 4th rank tensor . on the right - hand side ,",
    "two diagrams describe two tensors of different symmetries .",
    "the explicit expression of these tensors can be computed by the use of the corresponding symmetrization and antisymmetrization operations . for the elasticity tensor ,",
    "the result is obvious . the first ( row )",
    "diagram represents the totally symmetric tensor .",
    "the second ( square ) diagram represents an additional tensor that can be considered merely as a remainder .    as a result",
    ", we arrive at the unique and irreducible decomposition of the elasticity tensor under the action of the group @xmath21 : @xmath23 with @xmath24 and @xmath25 we use the standard normalized bach parentheses for symmetrization and antisymmetrization of indices .",
    "we observe that every antisymmetrization of @xmath26 gives zero and every symmetrization preserves this tensor . as for the second part @xmath27 , its total symmetrization @xmath28 vanishes .",
    "consequently , we have a useful symmetry relation @xmath29    as it is shown in @xcite and @xcite , the equation @xmath30 describes the well - known cauchy relation .",
    "thus , we call @xmath31 the _ cauchy part _ and @xmath27 the _ non - cauchy part _ of the elasticity tensor .    observe the main algebraic properties of this decomposition :    * the partial tensors @xmath31 and @xmath27 satisfy the minor symmetries , @xmath32kl}=s^{ij[kl]}=0\\qquad { \\rm and}\\qquad   a^{[ij]kl}=a^{ij[kl]}=0\\,,\\ ] ] and the major symmetry , @xmath33 thus , these partial tensors can themselves serve as elasticities of some hypothetic material .",
    "* moreover , any additional symmetrization or antisymmetrization preserves the tensors @xmath31 and @xmath27 or nullifies them . * the decomposition ( [ decomp ] ) is preserved under arbitrary linear transformations .",
    "thus , it can be referred to as irreducible @xmath34-decomposition . *",
    "the irreducible decomposition of the tensor @xmath35 provides the decomposition of the corresponding tensor space @xmath36 into a _ direct sum _ of two subspaces @xmath37 ( for the tensor @xmath38 ) and @xmath39 ( for the tensor @xmath40 ) , @xmath41",

    "we use the euclidean metric tensor @xmath49 . in rectangular coordinates , @xmath50 .",
    "we start with the totally symmetric cauchy part @xmath31 . from the contraction of @xmath31 with the metric tensor",
    ", we construct a unique symmetric second - rank tensor @xmath51 and a unique scalar @xmath52 we denote the traceless part of the tensor @xmath53 as @xmath54 now we turn to the decomposition of the tensor @xmath31 .",
    "we denote the two subtensors @xmath55 it can be checked now by the straightforward calculations that the remainder @xmath56 is totally traceless if and only if @xmath57    hence , we obtain the decomposition of the totally symmetric tensor @xmath31 into the sum of three independent pieces : @xmath58 where @xmath59 @xmath60 and @xmath61 these pieces are unique and invariant under the action of the group @xmath47 .",
    "moreover , the corresponding subspaces @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 are mutually orthogonal .",
    "indeed , for @xmath65 with @xmath66 , @xmath67 this fact follows immediately from the tracelessness of the tensors @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "consequently , the vector space @xmath70 of the totally symmetric tensor @xmath31 is decomposed into the direct sum of three subspaces @xmath71 with the corresponding dimensions @xmath72    we turn now to the second part of the elasticity tensor .",
    "the irreducible piece @xmath27 is a fourth rank tensor with 6 independent components .",
    "it is quite naturally that it can be represented as a symmetric second - rank tensor , see @xcite,@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite for detailed discussions .",
    "we define @xmath73 where @xmath74 denotes the 3-dimensional levi - civita permutation pseudo - tensor .",
    "consequently , @xmath75 is a symmetric tensor , @xmath76 , and we have @xmath77    for a proof of this proposition it is enough to substitute ( [ del ] ) into ( [ delta-1 ] ) and to apply the standard relations for the levi - civita pseudo - tensor .    in order to decompose the non - cauchy part @xmath27 , it is convenient to use its representation by the tensor density @xmath78 .",
    "we denote @xmath79 by using the relation @xmath80 and eq.([delta-1 ] ) , we derive @xmath81 the tensor density @xmath78 can be decomposed into the scalar and traceless pieces : @xmath82 where the traceless piece is given by @xmath83 substituting ( [ sub6 ] ) into ( [ delta-1 ] ) , we obtain @xmath84 where the scalar part is given by @xmath85 and the remainder reads @xmath86 we recall that the tensor @xmath87 is symmetric and traceless . since the product of two levi - civita pseudo - tensors is represented by the determinant of the metric tensor @xmath88 , the latter equation can be rewritten as @xmath89 the decomposition given in eq.([sub7 ] ) is unique , invariant , and irreducible under the action of the rotation group @xmath90 and of the permutation group @xmath21 .",
    "correspondingly , the vector space @xmath91 of the tensor @xmath27 is irreducibly decomposed into the direct sum of two subspaces @xmath92 with the corresponding dimensions @xmath93 since the trace of @xmath94 equals zero , these subspace are orthogonal to one another , @xmath95 collecting our results , we formulate the following    under the simultaneous action of the groups @xmath21 and @xmath90 , the elasticity tensor is uniquely irreducibly decomposed into the sum of five parts @xmath96 this decomposition corresponds to the direct sum decomposition of the vector space of the elasticity tensor into five subspaces @xmath97 with the dimensions @xmath98 the irreducible pieces are orthogonal to one another : for @xmath66 @xmath99 the euclidean squares , @xmath100 and @xmath101 with @xmath102 , fulfill the ",
    "pythagorean theorem : \" @xmath103      the decomposition ( [ ort3 ] ) involves two scalars @xmath38 and @xmath40 , two second order traceless tensors @xmath104 and @xmath105 , and a fourth order totally traceless tensor @xmath106 . exactly the same types of tensors emerge in the harmonic decomposition that is widely used in elasticity theory .",
    "such decomposition is generated by expressing the partial tensors in term of the harmonic polynomials , i.e. , the polynomial solutions of the laplace equation .",
    "the corresponding tensors are required to be completely symmetric and totally traceless .",
    "as it was demonstrated by backus @xcite , such a harmonic decomposition is not applicable in general in a space of the dimension greater than three .",
    "the most compact expression of this type was proposed by cowin @xcite , @xmath107 an alternative expression was proposed by backus @xcite .",
    "it reads , see @xcite , @xmath108 let us compare these two expressions .",
    "first we observe that two totally traceless tensors must be equal to one another , @xmath109 . as for the scalar terms in eq.([id1 ] ) , they are merely linear combinations of the corresponding terms in eq.([id2 ] ) . indeed , it is enough to take @xmath110 quite similarly , the traceless second order tensors of eq.([id1 ] ) are linear combinations of the corresponding terms of eq.([id2 ] ) with the identities @xmath111 both decompositions are irreducible under the action of the rotation group .",
    "the key difference between the two is that that the decomposition of backus is also irreducible under the action of permutation group .",
    "cowin s decomposition is reducible in this sense .",
    "let us compare now the harmonic decomposition eq.([id2 ] ) to our decomposition as it is given in eq.([sub10 ] ) .",
    "we immediately identify @xmath112 we can straightforwardly derive the relations @xmath113 and @xmath114    thus the two decompositions are equivalent .",
    "the difference is that in eq.([sub10 ] ) the partial tensors are identified as elasticities themselves .",
    "these partial tensors generate the minimal direct sum decomposition of the elasticity tensor space . moreover .",
    "the corresponding subspaces are mutually orthogonal and the squares of the tensors satisfy the  pythagorean theorem \" .",
    "we will see in the following section how those properties can be applied to the problem of quadratic invariants .",
    "each linear invariant of the elasticity tensor can be represented as @xmath115 where @xmath116 is a tensor . using the decomposition ( [ ort3 ] ) ,",
    "it can be rewritten as a sum of irreducible parts with different leading coefficients @xmath117 we observe that the tensor @xmath116 can be constructed only as a product of two components of the metric tensor , @xmath118 .",
    "since the tensors @xmath104 , @xmath105 , and @xmath106 are totally traceless they do not contribute to the sum in eq.([lin2 ] ) .",
    "consequently we are left with @xmath119 hence , every linear invariant is represented as a linear combination of the two basic linear invariants @xmath120 their independence can be seen from their explicit expressions .",
    "it follows also from the fact that @xmath38 and @xmath40 are related to two different subspaces @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "we readily obtain the expression of the linear invariants given in eq.([intro2 ] ) , @xmath123      norris @xcite presented a generic quadratic invariant of the elasticity tensor in the form @xmath124 here @xmath14 is a numerical tensor . using the irreducible decomposition ( [ ort3 ] ) it can be rewritten as @xmath125 the tensors with the components @xmath126 can be constructed only as a product of four components of the metric tensor , @xmath127 . using the traceless property of the tensors @xmath104 , @xmath105 , and @xmath106 , we can show that the quadratic invariants can be chosen uniquely as @xmath128 @xmath129 it is clear that this set of invariants is complete .",
    "indeed , when two tensors in ( [ quad1 ] ) are irreducibly decomposed in the form ( [ ort3 ] ) with an arbitrary tensor @xmath14 constructed from the metric tensor and numbers , only the terms ( [ quad3a ] , [ quad4aa ] ) can appear .",
    "moreover , these invariants are independent .",
    "it is due to the fact that they are taken from independent and even orthogonal subspaces of the elasticity tensor space .",
    "let us display the quadratic invariants of the set ( [ intro5 ] ) in terms of @xmath130 .",
    "we present the details of calculations in the appendix .",
    "for the quadratic invariants constructed from the linear ones , we have straightforwardly @xmath131 for the first invariant of ting , we write @xmath132 due to the orthogonality of the set , we are left here with @xmath133 let us list the expressions of these invariants @xmath134 and @xmath135 consequently , @xmath136 the second invariant of ting takes the form @xmath137 the first and the second invariants of ahmad read @xmath138 and @xmath139 respectively . from these expressions",
    "we see that the set of invariants ( [ intro5 ] ) is complete and the invariants are independent .",
    "the same is true for our set @xmath140 .",
    "we calculate also the additional invariant of norris : @xmath141 substituting the expressions ( [ quad3a][quad4aa ] ) we obtain the formula ( [ intro8 ] ) of norris .",
    "since invariants of the elasticity tensor are independent of the coordinate system used in specific measurements , they can be used as intrinsic characteristics of the materials .",
    "it is clear that linear independence is not enough for this goal . indeed , although the invariants @xmath142 , and @xmath143 are linear independent , they are related by a quadratic relation @xmath144 .",
    "we will show that an intrinsic meaning can be assigned to the five invariants that correspond to different direct subspaces of the elasticity tensor space , namely @xmath145 all these invariants are positive .      in the early days of the elasticity theory , cauchy formulated a molecular model for elastic bodies , based on 15 independent elasticity constants .",
    "in this way 6 constraints , called _ cauchy relations _ were assumed .",
    "a lattice - theoretical analysis shows , see @xcite , @xcite , that the cauchy relations are valid provided the following conditions hold :    * the interaction forces between the molecules of a crystal are central forces ; * each molecule is a center of symmetry ; * the interaction forces between the building blocks of a crystal can be well approximated by a harmonic potential .",
    "more recent discussions of the cauchy relations can be found , e.g. , in [ 1 ] , [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] , or [ 7 ] .",
    "different compact expressions of the cauchy relations can be found in literature .",
    "for instance in @xcite , they are presented as @xmath146 an alternative form is widely used , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xmath147 the irreducible decomposition technique @xcite yields @xmath148 as it was demonstrated experimentally already by voigt , the cauchy relations do not hold even approximately .",
    "thus , elastic properties of the generic anisotropic material is described by the whole set of 21 independent component .",
    "in fact , the situation with the cauchy relations is much more interesting , see @xcite .",
    "one can look for the _ deviation of the elasticity tensor from its cauchy part .",
    "_ as it was pointed out by hausshl @xcite , this deviation , even being a macroscopic characteristic , can provide some important information about microscopic structure of the material . to have such deviation term",
    "we must have a unique proper decomposition of the elasticity tensor into two independent parts that can be referred to as cauchy and non - cauchy parts .    in @xcite ,",
    "the deviation from the cauchy part was presented by the value of the corresponding combination given in the left hand side of eq.([cauchy - haus ] ) .",
    "such way of expression is valid only in the case when the non - cauchy part is presented by only one component .",
    "moreover this expression is dimension - full and depends on the choice of the coordinate system .    with the use of the quadratic invariants we can introduce an invariant characteristic of deviation of a material from its cauchy prototype . due to the",
    " pythagorean theorem \" ( [ ort3 ] ) , we define the dimensionless quantity , which we will call the _ cauchy factor _",
    "@xmath149 evidently , @xmath150 .",
    "a pure cauchy material is determined by @xmath151 . for @xmath152",
    ", we have a hypothetic material without cauchy part at all . comparing two materials",
    ", we must conclude that a material with higher cauchy factor has a microscopic structure closer to spherical symmetry .      in linear",
    "elasticity for anisotropic materials one must deal with a big set of elasticity constants .",
    "but in some problems , the elastic body can only be slightly different from an isotropic one .",
    "fedorov @xcite , in a classical book on the propagation of elastic waves in anisotropic crystals , has demonstrated how the anisotropic elastic tensor can be averaged over the 3-dimensional spatial directions in order to find some kind of isotropic approximation .",
    "recently norris @xcite took up this program and defined an euclidean distance function for solving the fedorov problem in a novel way .",
    "he succeeded in doing so and even extended the formalism for averaging the given set of elastic parameters relative to less symmetric classes .",
    "the corresponding procedure can be outlined as follows :    * for a given 4th order elasticity tensor , one constructs the corresponding 2nd order christoffel tensor , which is quadratic in the wave vector .",
    "* one consider the @xmath153 norm of the difference between the given anisotropic christoffel tensor and a generic isotropic one .",
    "the isotropic christoffel tensor is taken with two unknown parameters . *",
    "since christoffel tensor is quadratic in the wave vector @xmath154 , the mentioned norm is quartic @xmath154 likewise .",
    "its average is computed in space directions . *",
    "the resulting expression is left to be a function of two isotropic parameters .",
    "its minimization is applied and the resulting pair of isotropic parameters is derived .",
    "the result of this consideration is given in @xcite as @xmath155    in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , norris explained that minimizing a euclidean distance function is equivalent to projecting the tensor of elastic stiffness onto the appropriate symmetry .",
    "let us consider an elasticity tensor of 21 independent components .",
    "it is irreducibly decomposed to the sum of five independent pieces .",
    "two scalar pieces , namely @xmath156 and @xmath157 has a special property : they are invariant under arbitrary @xmath47 transformation . using the direct sum of the corresponding subspaces",
    ", we can construct a subspace @xmath158 this 2-dimensional subspace is @xmath47 invariant and orthogonal to all other subspaces of an arbitrary elasticity tensor . evidently it must be identified as an _ isotropic part _ of an elasticity tensor .",
    "consequently we constructed an isotropic part of the generic elasticity tensor in the form @xmath159 or , explicitly , @xmath160 let us compare this expression to the standard representation of an isotropic material in terms of the lam moduli @xmath161 and @xmath162 @xmath163 we derive the _ effective lame moduli _ for an anisotropic material @xmath164 recall that @xmath165 substituting these expressions into equations ( [ iso4 ] ) , we derive @xmath166 with the bulk constant @xmath167 we recover both expressions given in eq.([fed ] ) .",
    "in order to express the deviation of the given anisotropic material from its effective isotropic prototype , one uses the distance between two tensors .",
    "this quantity is dimensionful and depends on the average magnitude of the elasticity tensor .",
    "instead , we define the _ isotropy factor _ of an anisotropic material in the form @xmath168 in terms of the constants @xmath38 and @xmath40 it reads @xmath169 we observe that @xmath170 .",
    "it is equal to one for pure isotropic materials and equal to zero for some hypothetic material without isotropic part , i.e. , in the case when the effective lam moduli vanish .      as a natural extension of the cauchy and the isotropy factors described above , we introduce dimensionless numerical factors that describe the contribution of the irreducible pieces to the elasticity tensor .",
