    "is usually called completely exceptional and born - infeld theory is the only completely exceptional regular nonlinear electrodynamics . finally ( and more technically ) born - infeld theory can be seen as a covariant generalization of mie s theory , and very close to einstein s idea of introducing a nonsymmetric metric tensor with the symmetric part corresponding to the usual metric tensor and the antisymmetric to the electromagnetic field tensor . during the 1990s",
