    "most stars are born rotating quite rapidly .",
    "they can arrive on the main sequence with rotational velocities as high as 200 @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "stars with convection zones at their surfaces , like the sun , slowly spin down as they shed angular momentum through their magnetized stellar winds .",
    "the time needed for significant spindown appears to be a strong function of stellar mass ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : solar - mass stars slow less rapidly than somewhat less massive g and k - type stars , but still appear to lose much of their angular momentum by the time they are as old as the sun .",
    "present day observations of the solar wind likewise indicate that the current angular momentum flux from the sun is a few times 10@xmath3 dyn  cm ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , suggesting a time scale for substantial angular momentum loss of a few billion years .",
    "thus the sun likely rotated significantly more rapidly in its youth than it does today .",
    "rotation appears to be inextricably linked to stellar magnetic activity .",
    "observations indicate that in stars with extensive convective envelopes , chromospheric and coronal activity  which partly trace magnetic heating of stellar atmospheres ",
    "first rise with increasing rotation rate , then eventually level off at a constant value for rotation rates above a mass - dependent threshold velocity .",
    "activity may even decline somewhat in the most rapid rotators ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "similar correspondence is observed between rotation rate and estimates of the unsigned surface magnetic flux @xcite . this `` rotation - activity '' relationship is tightened when stellar rotation is given in terms of the rossby number @xmath4 , with @xmath5 the rotation period and @xmath6 an estimate of the convective overturning time ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "expressed in this fashion , a common rotation - activity correlation appears to span spectral types ranging from late f to late m .",
    "magnetic fields can likewise feed back upon stellar rotation by modifying the rate at which angular momentum is lost through a stellar wind .",
    "analyses of stellar spindown as a function of age and mass have thus provided further constraints on stellar magnetism and its connections to rotation .",
    "there are also indications that the period of the activity cycle itself may depend on the stellar rotation rate .",
    "recent observations of solar - type stars may indicate that even the topology of the global - scale fields changes with rotation rate , with the rapid rotators having substantial global - scale toroidal magnetic fields at their surfaces @xcite .",
    "the overall picture that emerges from these observations is that rapid rotation , as realized in the younger sun and in a host of other stars , can aid in the generation of strong magnetic fields and that young stars tend to be rapidly rotating and magnetically active , whereas older ones are slower and less active ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "a full theoretical understanding of the rotation - activity relationship , and likewise of stellar spindown , has remained elusive .",
    "some aspects of these phenomena probably depend upon the details of magnetic flux emergence , chromospheric and coronal heating , and mass loss mechanisms  but the basic _ existence _ of a rotation - activity relationship is widely thought to reflect some underlying rotational dependence of the dynamo process itself ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .      in stars like the sun",
    ", the global - scale dynamo is generally thought to be seated in the tachocline , an interface of shear between the differentially rotating convection zone and the radiative interior which is in solid body rotation .",
    "helioseismology revealed the internal rotation profile of the sun and the presence of this important shear layer ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the stably stratified tachocline may provide a region for storing and amplifying coherent tubes of magnetic field which may eventually rise to the surface of the sun as sunspots .",
    "others have suggested that the latitudinal and radial gradients of angular velocity in the bulk of the convection zone may be sufficient for global dynamo action .",
    "however , it has generally been believed that magnetic buoyancy instabilities may prevent fields from being strongly amplified within the bulk of the convection zone itself @xcite . in the now prevalent `` interface dynamo '' model , solar magnetic fields",
    "are partly generated in the convection zone by helical convection , then transported downward into the tachocline where they are organized and amplified by the shear .",
    "ultimately the fields may become unstable and rise to the surface .",
    "although the rotational dependence of this process is not well understood , some guidance may come from mean - field dynamo theory .",
    "in such theories , the solar dynamo is often referred to as an `` @xmath7 '' dynamo , with the @xmath0-effect characterizing the twisting of fields by helical convection ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the @xmath1-effect representing the shearing of poloidal fields by differential rotation to form toroidal fields . both of these effects are , in mean - field theory , sensitive to rotation : the @xmath0-effect because it is proportional to the kinetic helicity of the convective flows , which sense the overall rotation rate , and the @xmath1-effect because more rapidly rotating stars are generally expected to have stronger differential rotation .",
    "but the detailed nature of these effects in the solar dynamo and the appropriate scaling with rotation has been very difficult to elucidate .",
    "simulations of the global - scale solar dynamo have generally affirmed the view that the tachocline may play a central role in building the globally - ordered magnetism in the sun .",
    "recent three - dimensional ( 3d ) simulations of solar convection without a tachocline at the base of the convection zone achieved dynamo action and produced magnetic fields which were strongly dominated by fluctuating components with little global - scale order @xcite . when a tachocline of penetration and shear was included , remarkable global - scale magnetic structures were realized in the tachocline region , while the convection zone remained dominated by fluctuating fields @xcite .",
    "these simulations are making good progress toward clarifying the elements at work in the operation of the solar global - scale dynamo , but for other stars many questions remain .",
    "in particular , observations of large - scale magnetism in fully convective m - stars @xcite , along with the persistence of a rotation - activity correlation in such low - mass stars , hint that perhaps tachoclines may not be essential for the generation of global - scale magnetic fields .",
    "this view is partly borne out by simulations of m - dwarfs under strong rotational constraints @xcite , where strong longitudinal mean fields were realized despite the lack of either substantial differential rotation or a stable interior and thus no classical tachocline .",
    "major puzzles remain in the quest to understand stellar magnetism and its scaling with stellar rotation .",
    "we began our study of rapidly rotating suns by carrying out a suite of 3d hydrodynamic simulations in full spherical shells that explored the coupling of rotation and convection in these younger solar - type stars @xcite .",
    "those simulations studied the influence of rotation on the patterns of convection and the nature of global - scale flows in such stars .",
    "the shearing flows of differential rotation generally grow in amplitude with more rapid rotation , possessing rapid equators and slower poles , while the meridional circulations weaken and break up into multiple cells in radius and latitude .",
    "more rapid rotation can also substantially modify the patterns of convection in a surprising fashion .",
    "with more rapid rotation , localized states begin to appear in which the convection at low latitudes is modulated in its strength with longitude . at the highest rotation rates ,",
    "the convection can become confined to active nests which propagate at distinct rates and persist for long epochs .",
    "motivated by these discoveries , we turn here to explorations of the possible dynamo action achieved in a solar - type star rotating at three times the current solar rate .",
    "these 3d magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulations span the convection zone alone , as the nature of tachoclines in more rapidly rotating suns is at present unclear .",
    "we find that a variety of dynamos can be excited , including steady and oscillating states , and that dynamo action is substantially easier to achieve at these faster rotation rates than in the solar simulations .",
    "magnetism leads to strong feedbacks on the flows , particularly modifying the differential rotation and its scaling with the overall rotation rate @xmath8 .",
    "the magnetic fields which form in these dynamos have prominent global - scale organization within the convection zone , in contrast to previous solar dynamo simulations @xcite .",
    "quite strikingly , we find that coherent global magnetic structures arise naturally in the midst of the turbulent convection zone .",
    "these wreath - like structures are regions of strong longitudinal field @xmath9 organized loosely into tubes , with fields wandering in and out of the surrounding convection .",
    "these wreaths of magnetism differ substantially from the idealized flux tubes supposed in many dynamo theories , though they may be related to coherent structures achieved in local simulations of dynamo action in shear flows .",
    "here we explore the nature of persistent magnetic wreaths realized in a global simulation rotating at three times the solar rotation rate , and discuss how they are maintained amidst turbulent convection .",
    "in many of our other rapidly rotating suns , the dynamos become time dependent and undergo semi - regular changes of global - scale polarity .",
    "those dynamos will be explored in an upcoming paper .",
    "we additionally find that magnetic wreaths survive in the presence of a model tachocline , and those simulations will be reported on separately .",
    "we outline in  [ sec : ash ] the 3d mhd anelastic spherical shell model and the parameter space explored by these simulations .",

    "to study the coupling between rotation , magnetism and the large - scale flows achieved in stellar convection zones , we must employ a global model which simultaneously captures the spherical shell geometry and admits the possibility of zonal jets and large eddy vortices , and of convective plumes that may span the depth of the convection zone .",
    "the solar convection zone is intensely turbulent and microscopic values of viscosity and magnetic and thermal diffusivities in the sun are estimated to be very small .",
    "numerical simulations can not hope to resolve all scales of motion present in real stellar convection and must instead strike a compromise between resolving dynamics on small scales and capturing the connectivity and geometry of the global scales . here",

    "the effects of this change are subtle , resulting primarily in slightly stronger latitudinal gradients of differential rotation and temperature in the uppermost regions of the shell .",
    "the patterns of convection are very similar to those found in case  g3 , though here they are slightly more complex near the top of the shell , and the reynolds number remains high throughout the convection zone .",
    "case  h3 possesses intricate convective patterns and a solar - like differential rotation profile , with fast zonal flow at the equator and slower flows at the poles .",
    "to initiate our dynamo case , a small seed dipole magnetic field was introduced and evolved via the induction equation .",
    "the energy in the magnetic fields is initially many orders of magnitude smaller than the energy contained in the convective motions , but these fields are amplified by shear and grow to become comparable in energy to the convective motions .",
    "stellar dynamo simulations are computationally intensive , requiring both high resolutions to correctly represent the velocity fields and long time evolution to capture the equilibrated dynamo behavior , which may include cyclic variations on time scales of several years .",
    "the strong magnetic fields can produce rapidly moving alfvn waves which seriously restrict the courant - friedrichs - lewy ( cfl ) timestep limits in the upper portions of the convection zone .",
    "case  d3 , rotating three times faster than the current sun , has been evolved for over 7000 days ( or over 2 million timesteps ) .",
    "we plan to report on a variety of other dynamo cases , some at higher turbulence levels and rotation rates , in subsequent papers .",
    "this dynamo simulation was conducted at magnetic prandtl number @xmath54 , a value significantly lower than employed in our previous solar simulations . in particular , @xcite explored @xmath55 and @xmath56 , and @xcite studied @xmath57 .",
    "the high magnetic prandtl numbers were required in the solar simulations to reach sufficiently high magnetic reynolds numbers to drive sustained dynamo action . in the simulations of @xcite only the simulations with @xmath58 and @xmath59 achieved sustained dynamo action , where @xmath60 is the fluctuating magnetic reynolds number .",
    "we are here able to use a lower magnetic prandtl number for three reasons .",
    "firstly , more rapid rotation tends to stabilize convection and lower values of @xmath34 and @xmath36 are required to drive the convection .",
    "once convective motions begin , they become quite vigorous and the fluctuating velocities saturate at values comparable to our solar cases .",
    "thus the reynolds numbers achieved are fairly large and we can achieve modestly high magnetic reynolds numbers even at low @xmath61 . secondly , the differential rotation becomes substantially stronger with both more rapid rotation @xmath8 and with lower diffusivities @xmath34 and @xmath36 .",
    "this global - scale flow is an important ingredient and reservoir of energy for these dynamos , and the increase in its amplitude means that low @xmath61 dynamos can still achieve large magnetic reynolds numbers based on this zonal flow .",
    "lastly , the critical magnetic reynolds number for dynamo action likely decreases with increasing kinetic helicity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and helicity generally increases with rotation rate ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "indeed there are even suggestions that the presence of a mean shearing flow may lower the critical magnetic reynolds number , and the strong differential rotation present in these rapidly rotating suns may serve to lower this threshold for dynamo action .",
    "we find that the rapidly rotating flows considered here achieve dynamo action at somewhat lower @xmath62 than the models of @xcite , which rotated at the solar rate .",
    "we here explore case  d3 which yields fairly persistent wreaths of magnetism in its two hemispheres , though these do wax and wane somewhat in strength once established . examining the properties of this dynamo solution should help to provide a perspective for the greater variations realized in our time - dependent dynamos which will be discussed in a following paper .",
    "the complex and evolving convective structures in our dynamo cases are substantially similar to the patterns of convection found in our hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "our dynamo solution rotating at three times the solar rate , case  d3 , is presented in figure  [ fig : case_d3_patterns ] , along with its hydrodynamic progenitor , case  h3 .",
    "the radial velocities shown near the top of the simulated domain ( figs .",
    "[ fig : case_d3_patterns]@xmath63 ) have broad upflows and narrow downflows as a consequence of the compressible motions .",
    "near the equator the convection is aligned largely in the north - south direction , and these broad fronts sweep through the domain in a prograde fashion .",
    "the strongest downflows penetrate to the bottom of the convection zone ; the weaker flows are partially truncated by the strong zonal flows of differential rotation . in the polar regions the convection is more isotropic and cyclonic . there",
    "the networks of downflow lanes surround upflows and both propagate in a retrograde fashion .",
    "the convection establishes a prominent differential rotation profile by redistributing angular momentum and entropy , building gradients in latitude of angular velocity and temperature .",
    "figures  [ fig : case_d3_patterns]@xmath64 show the mean angular velocity @xmath65 for cases d3 and h3 , revealing a solar - like structure with a prograde ( fast ) equator and retrograde ( slow ) pole .",
    "figures  [ fig : case_d3_patterns]@xmath66 present in turn radial cuts of @xmath1 at selected latitudes , which are useful as we consider the angular velocity patterns realized here with faster rotation .",
    "these @xmath65 profiles are averaged in azimuth ( longitude ) and time over a period of roughly 200  days .",
    "contours of constant angular velocity are aligned nearly on cylinders , influenced by the taylor - proudman theorem .    in the sun",
    ", helioseismology has revealed that the contours of angular velocity are aligned almost on radial lines rather than on cylinders .",
    "the tilt of @xmath1 contours in the sun may be due in part to the thermal structure of the solar tachocline , as first found in the mean - field models of @xcite and then in 3d simulations of global - scale convection by @xcite . in those computations , it was realized that introducing a weak latitudinal gradient of entropy at the base of the convection zone , consistent with a thermal wind balance in a tachocline of shear , can serve to tilt the @xmath1 contours toward a more radial alignment without significantly changing either the overall @xmath1 contrast with latitude or the convective patterns .",
    "@xcite explored the consequences of such a boundary condition in one of their simulations of young , rapidly rotating suns with deep convection zones and found that the effects on the differential rotation were similar to those found in @xcite .",
    "we expect similar behavior here , but at present observations of rapidly rotating stars only measure differential rotation at the surface and do not offer constraints on either the existence of tachoclines in young suns or the nature of their internal differential rotation profiles . as such",
    ", we have neglected the possible tachoclines of penetration and shear entirely in these models and instead adopt the simplification of imposing a constant radial entropy gradient at the bottom of the convection zone .",
