    "moreover , one can find such a surface with ample canonical divisor when @xmath17 , except @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 .",
    "assume that @xmath2058 .",
    "then , we have an algebraically simply connected minimal surface @xmath18 of general type defined over @xmath16 such that @xmath2059 and @xmath20 by propositions  [ prop : lpmethod1 ] and [ prop : lpmethod2 ] applied to examples  [ exam : k2=2main][exam : char2,k2=2 ] above . in fact , the case @xmath1830 is treated in examples  [ exam : k2=1main ] ( when @xmath2060 ) and [ exam : char2,k2=1 ] ( when @xmath2061 ) ; the case @xmath32 in examples  [ exam : k2=2main ] ( when @xmath2062 , @xmath49 ) , [ exam : k2=2char3 ] ( when @xmath1937 ) , and [ exam : char2,k2=2 ] ( when @xmath2061 ) ; the case @xmath28 in examples  [ exam : k2=3 ] ( when @xmath1937 ) and [ exam : char2,k2=3 ] ( when @xmath2061 ) ; and the case @xmath1918 in example  [ exam : k2=4 ] ( when @xmath1937 ) . here , @xmath60 is not ample only in examples  [ exam : char2,k2=1 ] and [ exam : char2,k2=2 ] .",
    "thus , we can require @xmath1557 to be ample if @xmath2063 , @xmath2064 .",
    "hence , the proof has been completed .",
