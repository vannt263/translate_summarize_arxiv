    "now consider including a third neutrino eigenvalue , retaining the required perturbation .",
    "for a solution , @xmath171 is required , and consequently @xmath172 as @xmath173 . as a result the leading eigenvector",
    "@xmath174 is unperturbed by integrating out both @xmath175 in the flavour basis , one finds ^t = ( , , ) .",
    "a @xmath176 symmetry implemented on @xmath74 and @xmath75 is consistent with @xmath154 form of the pmns matrix , as expected .",
    "now consider the breaking of @xmath154 form .",
    "the value of @xmath0 measured by the daya - bay collaboration is in agreement with the global fit values given in ref .",
    "@xcite , as such , we use the fit results to find the measured pattern of deviations in @xmath154 form .",
    "it is instructive to construct the following ratios of experimental values characterizing the deviations of @xmath154 form in each mixing angle . using the small angle approximation = 0.02 0.32 = 0.01 0.10 = 2.0 36",
    "here we have used the one sigma new reactor flux values of ref .",
    "@xcite and taken a @xmath177 symmetric one sigma error .",
    "various breaking of @xmath154 form can be studied using the fse and compared to these results .",
    "consider the case that @xmath91 retains a @xmath176 flavour symmetry in its couplings to the charged leptons , but @xmath105 breaks such a symmetry so that deviations in @xmath154 form are expected .",
    "fix @xmath178 with @xmath179 and treat this breaking as a perturbation using the fse .",
    "we use @xmath180 assuming a normal hierarchy . at leading order in the fse the breaking of @xmath159",
    "has the pattern & = & 0 , + & = & , + & = & 0 . as the range of the predicted value of @xmath181 is given by @xmath182 $ ] at leading order in the fse , this pattern of flavour breaking does not reproduce the data . in this way",
    ", particular mechanisms of the breaking of @xmath154 form can be falsified .",
    "one can perform the exercise of assuming @xmath154 form is broken in the flavour basis by @xmath91 so that @xmath183 . using the expansion",
    "one finds the pattern of deviations are distinct .",
    "these breakings of @xmath154 form are also correlated with mass perturbations in each case which are trivial to determine using this formalism .",
    "we emphasize however that the relationships _ between _ the eigenvectors determine the form of the pmns matrix in general .",
    "this is easy to demonstrate in more detail .",
    "consider retaining a @xmath176 symmetry imposed on @xmath74 and @xmath75 but deviating from the flavour basis , choosing @xmath184 as above but unfixing @xmath147 . at leading order in the expansion of @xmath4 one can solve for the condition that @xmath154 form is still obtained for general @xmath147 .",
    "one finds that _ only _ the flavour basis for @xmath147 gives a valid solution at leading order in the expansion .",
    "this makes clear that @xmath176 symmetry imposed on the lagrangian alone is not related to @xmath154 form in a basis independent manner .    as a further example that @xmath176 symmetry is also not unique or of particular physical significance in allowing @xmath154 form ( with an appropriate choice on the @xmath156 eigenvectors ) , consider the following procedure .",
    "choose a @xmath185 symmetry on the first interaction eigenvector , ie @xmath186 , and @xmath187 as a simple interaction eigenvector for @xmath111 leading to an orthonormal eigenbasis at leading order , finding ( , l ) = (    ccc & & + - & & + 0 & - &    ) .",
    "solving directly for @xmath29 so that at leading order @xmath154 form is obtained , one finds ( e , l ) = (    ccc ( + 2 ) & ( - - ) & ( - - ) + ( - 2 ) & ( + - ) & ( + + ) + - & - & - +    ) .",
    "this procedure can be used for any flavour symmetry chosen to fix @xmath188 in the fse for the @xmath67 .",
    "we also note that the impact of sterile neutrinos weakly coupled to the sm on neutrino phenomenology can be systematically studied with this approach .",
    "for example , one can relate any measured value of a deviation from @xmath154 form to the particular yukawa coupling vector of a single sterile neutrino , which can be shown to accommodate the value of @xmath0 reported by the daya - bay collaboration while the three right handed neutrinos partners of the sm fields give an exact @xmath154 form of the @xmath4 matrix .",
    "flavour symmetries that are related to the structure of the @xmath4 matrix only in a particular basis choice of @xmath28 can lead to suspect physical conclusions . as an alternative to basis dependent symmetry studies",
    ", we have developed a perturbative expansion relating the measured masses of the neutrinos to the form of the pmns matrix .",
    "this expansion offers a promising framework for broadly understanding the implications of the systematically improving experimental neutrino data , particularly in a normal hierarchy .",
    "we have illustrated our approach in an example where the flavour basis was chosen , for the sake of familiarity , and then shown how the expansion can control the predictions of @xmath154 form being broken .",
    "however , the approach we outline can accommodate any basis choice .",
    "indeed , it is the relationships between the eigenvectors that dictate the form of the @xmath4 matrix in a @xmath28 basis independent manner .",
    "this formalism can be employed in model building to attempt to determine a compelling origin of the eigenvector relationship that corresponds to @xmath154 form at leading order in the fse .",
    "further , as the breaking of @xmath154 form is now experimentally established due to the discovery of a non zero @xmath0 in ref .",
    "@xcite , we expect the fse to be of some phenomenological utility in falsifying mechanisms of the breaking of the @xmath154 form of the @xmath4 matrix , as the pattern of this breaking is further resolved experimentally in the years ahead .",
