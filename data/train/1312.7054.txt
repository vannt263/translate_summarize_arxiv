    "when the characteristic intensity of the external coupling is also the same as that of the internal coupling , i.e. , @xmath108 , the internal and external couplings are indistinguishable , and therefore , the groups exhibit in - phase collective synchronization .",
    "thus , for the case in which the type of the collective phase coupling function is anti - phase coupling , the synchronization between the groups changes from in - phase to anti - phase as the external coupling intensity @xmath109 decreases from one .",
