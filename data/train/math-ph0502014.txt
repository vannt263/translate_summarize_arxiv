    "graph models of quantum systems can often be used to describe in a simple way some important aspects of the behaviour of a quantum system .",
    "although such models are simple enough to be solvable ( because they are essentially @xmath2-dimensional ) they still have enough structure to model real systems .",
    "ruedenberg and scherr @xcite used this idea to calculate spectra of aromatic carbohydrate molecules . nowadays the rapid technical progress allows to fabricate structures of electronic devices where quantum effects play a dominant role .",
    "graph models like quantum graphs ( also called _ metric graphs _ ) can often be viewed as a good approximation of such structures . from the mathematical point of view",
    "these models were analysed first thoroughly in @xcite , for recent developments , bibliography and further applications see @xcite , @xcite ,  @xcite or  @xcite ; note that @xcite also calculated the eigenvalue asymptotic of a tubular @xmath1-neighbourhood of a curve .",
    "a quantum ( or metric ) graph is a graph where we associate a length to each edge .",
    "a natural operator acting on such graphs is given by a self - adjoint extension of @xmath3 on each edge .",
    "we will call such a self - adjoint extension a _ laplacian _ on the ( quantum ) graph .",

    "operator on @xmath4 rather than a _",
    "operator acting in @xmath5 .",
    "here , @xmath6 labels the vertices and @xmath7 the edges @xmath8 , @xmath9 , of the graph",
    ". a detailed overview on this wide field can be found in @xcite or @xcite .",
    "a natural question is in what mathematical sense a quantum graph @xmath10 can be approximated by a more smooth space @xmath0 .",
    "one is interested what laplacians on @xmath10 occur as limit operators from operators on @xmath0 .",
    "more significantly , @xmath0 could be the @xmath1-neighbourhood of an embedded graph @xmath11 or a manifold shrinking to @xmath10 as @xmath12 .",
    "we call such approximating spaces _ branched quantum wave guides_. recently , spectral convergence in the case of a bounded open set @xmath0 with neumann boundary condition has been established in  @xcite ,  @xcite and  @xcite ; for an approximation by manifolds see  @xcite .",
    "all these examples have in common , that the lowest eigenmode of the transversal direction is @xmath13 with constant eigenfunction . in this case",
    ", the limit operator is the laplacian on the graph with _ kirchhoff boundary conditions _ , i.e. , a function @xmath14 in the domain of the kirchhoff laplacian is continuous at each vertex and satisfies @xmath15 in addition , the spectral convergence holds _ independently _ of a given embedding of the graph .",
    "in particular , the convergence is independent of the curvature of the embedded edges .",
    "the case of an approximation by dirichlet laplacians on an open set @xmath0 was first treated heuristically in  @xcite .",
    "this case is harder to analyse since the first transversal eigenvalue equals @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) , i.e. , it is of the order @xmath18 if @xmath1 denotes the radius of the cross section @xmath19 of the approximating set @xmath0 .",
    "a rescaling is necessary , and first order terms of the metric @xmath20 ( cf .  ) like the curvature become important .",
