    "in recent years , stellar photometry primarily from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) has allowed astronomers to discover previously unknown spatial substructure in the galactic spheroid .",
    "other surveys such as 2mass and quest have also been influential .",
    "highlights include the discovery of new tidal streams @xcite ; dwarf galaxies , star clusters , and transitional objects @xcite ; and previously unidentified spatial structure of unknown or controversial identity @xcite .",
    "the discovery of spatial substructure immediately suggests the need for spectroscopic follow - up to determine the orbital characteristics of tidal debris , the masses of bound structures , and the character of structures of unknown identity .",
    "it has long been known that a spheroid that is formed through accretion will retain the record of its merger history much longer in the velocities of its component stars than it will in their spatial distribution @xcite .",
    "for this reason early searches concentrated on velocity to find  moving groups \" in the spheroid @xcite rather than on the search for spatial substructure .",
    "groups of spheroid stars that have similar spatial positions and velocities ( moving groups ) are generally equated with tidal disruption of star clusters or dwarf galaxies , unlike local disc  moving groups \" that were once hypothesized to be the result of disruption of star clusters @xcite but are now thought to be the result of orbital resonances .",
    "recently , searches for spheroid velocity substructure in sdss data have concentrated on local ( up to 17.5 kpc from the sun ) metal - poor main sequence stars @xcite , finding more than a dozen groups of stars with coherent velocities .",
    "@xcite estimate that there are @xmath7 cold substructures in the milky way s stellar halo .",
    "blue horizontal branch ( bhb ) stars are particularly important for studies of spheroid substruscture ( e.g. clewey & kinman 2006 ) because they can be seen to large distances in the sdss and because a large fraction of the sdss stellar spectra are bhbs . in the future",
    "we need more complete spectroscopic and proper motion surveys designed to discover velocity substructure in the milky way s spheroid .",
    "in this paper we present evidence for a tidal moving group of bhb stars , discovered in the sdss and sloan extension for galactic understanding and exploration ( segue ; yanny et al .",
    "2009 ) spectroscopic survey .",
    "additional evidence that the stars are part of a coherent structure comes from the unusually low metallicity of the stars in the moving group .",
    "we are unable to isolate this moving group in density substructure , highlighting the power of velocity information to identify low density contrast substructure in the spheroid .",
    "historically many of the spheroid substructures have been discovered by eye in incomplete datasets , rather than by a mechanical analysis of data with a well - understood background population .",
    "as the size of the substructures decreases , it becomes more critical to determine whether the observed structure could be a random fluctuation of the background . in this paper , we present a method ( appendix a ) for estimating the probability that a random fluctuation could produce an observed  lump . \"    as we work towards the fainter limits of the sdss data , it becomes more important to understand how stellar parameters derived from spectra are affected by a low signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio .",
    "the stars in the newly detected halo substructure have s / n ratio between 7 and 10 , as measured from the ratio of fluctuations to continuum on the blue side of the spectrum . in the past",
    "we have successfully used spectra with s / n as low as 5 to measure radial velocities of f turnoff stars in the virgo overdensity @xcite . in this paper , we show that although higher s / n is preferable , some information about metallicity and surface gravity can be gained for bhb stars with s / n ratios less than 10 .    since the strongest evidence that these bhbs form a coherent group is that they have unusually low metallicity , even for the spheroid , we also explore the segue metallicity determinations for bhb stars in the outer spheroid .",
    "a great variety of previous authors have measured a large metallicity dispersion for spheroid stars , with average metallicities somewhere in the @xmath8 < -1.7 $ ] range .",
    "these investigations analysed globular clusters @xcite , rr lyraes @xcite , k giants @xcite , and dwarfs @xcite .",
    "@xcite found an average [ fe / h ] of @xmath9 for globular clusters in the outer halo , and an average metallicity of @xmath10 for field stars in the outer halo , again with a large metallicity dispersion that does not depend on distance .",
    "the besanon model of the milky way adopted an average [ fe / h ] of @xmath11 , with @xmath12 , for the stellar halo .",
    "recently , @xcite analysed the full space motions of @xmath13 stars within 4 kpc from the sun , and found evidence that the ones that are kinematic members of the outer halo have an average metallicity of [ fe / h]=@xmath14 .",
    "our analysis of the sdss bhb stars shows that the metallicity of bhb stars in the galactic spheroid does not change from @xmath15 ( 6 kpc from the sun ) to @xmath16 ( 55 kpc from the sun ) at high galactic latitudes .",
    "the mean measured metallicity of these stars is [ fe / h]=@xmath17 , but analyses of globular clusters in the sample show that there could be a systematic shift in the bhb measured metallicities of a few tenths of a magnitude , and in fact [ fe / h]=@xmath6 is our best guess for the proper calibrated value .",
    "in order to search the stellar halo for co - moving groups of stars , we selected bhb stars from the sixth data release ( dr6 ; adelman - mccarthy et al .",
    "2008 ) of the sdss .",
    "this release contains both legacy survey and segue photometric data from 9583 square degrees of sky .",
    "more technical information for the sdss survey can be found in @xcite .",
    "we selected 8753 spectra with the colors of a stars from the sdss dr6 star database using the color cuts @xmath18 and @xmath19 , within the magnitude range @xmath20 , where the @xmath21 subscript indicates that the magnitudes have been corrected for reddening and extinction using the @xcite reddening map . within this color box , the stars that are bluer in @xmath22 tend to be high surface gravity blue straggler ( bs ) or main sequence stars , and those that are redder in @xmath22 tend to be low surface gravity blue horizontal branch ( bhb ) stars . using @xmath22 , @xmath23 color selection parameters as described in figure 10 of @xcite , we divided the sample into @xmath24 candidate bhb stars and @xmath25 candidate bs stars with spectra .",
    "we separated the stars in surface gravity using a photometric technique , because in 2007 when we were selecting the stars , we were concerned that the s / n of the spectra would degrade more quickly than the s / n of the photometry at the faint end of our sample .",
    "the s / n of the spectroscopy increases over the whole magnitude range from @xmath26 , while the photometric accuracy degrades only for @xmath27 .",
    "the photometric degradation affects halo bhb stars fainter than about @xmath28 . with more recent reduction software ( see below ) , we have found similar sensitivity to surface gravity in photometric and spectroscopic indicators for faint sdss spectra , but the spectroscopic separation is much better than photometric separation for bright , high s / n spectra .",
    "the photometric selection technique does not introduce gradients in the selection effect with apparent magnitude , and can be applied identically for stars with and without measured spectra .    at bright magnitudes , the spectral s",
    "/ n is high enough that the dr6 surface gravities are reliable .",
    "the sdss spectra are r=1800 , and",
    "the s / n of a star spectra varies from 50 at @xmath29 to 7 at @xmath30 .",
    "we tested the efficiency and completeness of the photometric selection technique using 3996 sdss spectra of stars with @xmath31 and colors of a - type stars .",
    "of the 1948 that had surface gravities consistent with bhb stars , 84% were classified as bhbs by the photometric technique . of the 2048 spectra with high surface gravity ( bs stars ) ,",
    "35% were classified as bhbs in the photometric technique .",
    "these numbers for completeness and contamination are similar to estimates that we made from examination of figure 13 from @xcite , and apply only to stars with @xmath32 fainter than this , the photometric errors in @xmath33 will cause increased mixing of the populations .",
    "we searched our bhb catalog for stars that clustered in velocity , apparent magnitude , and galactic coordinates .",
    "our search was less systematic than that used by @xcite , but allows us to find moving groups that are more extended , such as tidal streams .",
    "because they first searched for pairs of co - moving stars that were within @xmath34 kpc of each other , they reduced their sensitivity to tidal debris streams that could be spread over tens of kpc .",
    "we first divided the catalog into sky areas in @xmath35 that were @xmath36 by @xmath37 in the respective coordinates , and made plots of @xmath38 vs. @xmath39 magnitude .",
    "we used @xmath40 so that each partition of the data would cover an equal area of the sky . here",
    ", @xmath38 refers to the line - of - sight velocity transformed to the galactic standard of rest using the solar motion of @xmath41 km s@xmath3 @xcite . by examining the line - of - sight velocity as a function of magnitude , we found a number of co - moving groups of stars that were associated with known globular clusters , dwarf galaxies , and tidal streams .",
    "halo substructures that had been previously identified were not studied further .",
    "we concentrated only on the most significant of the remaining bhb association ; others were left for future studies .",
    "figure 1 shows the @xmath38 vs. @xmath39 plot for the most significant co - moving group of bhb stars , along with the distribution of these stars in @xmath42 .",
    "although there is a second cluster of stars at @xmath43 in the top left plot , we show in the lower left plot that these stars are dispersed in position on the sky so we did not explore that association further .",
    "the moving group we describe here has bhb stars at @xmath1 , @xmath44 ; and @xmath4 km s@xmath3 , @xmath45 km s@xmath3 .",
    "the dispersion is consistent with the instrumental error in the velocity of 19@xmath46 magnitude bhb stars @xcite .",
    "these stars have an average heliocentric radial velocity of @xmath47 km s@xmath3 , which rules out any association of these stars with the disc population . in the direction @xmath48 , the line - of - sight , heliocentric velocities expected for the thin disc , thick disc , and spheroid components are @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 km",
    "s@xmath3 , respectively .",
    "the heliocentric radial velocity of our moving group is not far from that of the average spheroid star in that direction ( @xmath52 for the spheroid and @xmath4 km s@xmath3 for the moving group ) , but the dispersion rules out an association with the general spheroid population .",
    "the lower right panel of figure 1 shows that the association of horizontal branch stars could not be detected spatially ; velocity information was required to identify the moving group .    in the same area , at @xmath53 , another cluster identified from sdss bhb stars",
    "was found by @xcite .",
    "although this cluster lies at roughly the same ( l , b ) angular position as the cluster identified in this paper , the estimated distance to the clewley et al .",
    "clump is 7.8 kpc , which is much closer to the sun than our moving group , with a horizontal branch brighter than @xmath29 .",
    "the parameters of the seven bhb stars in the moving group are presented in table 1 .",
    "the new moving group found in this study is located at @xmath54 .",
    "the stars have apparent magnitude in the @xmath55 filter of @xmath56 and velocities located within @xmath57 km s@xmath3 , with an average velocity of @xmath58 km s@xmath3 .",
    "a @xmath39 apparent magnitude of @xmath59 for bhb stars , with an estimated absolute magnitude of @xmath60 @xcite corresponds to a distance of @xmath61 kpc from the sun .",
    "the magnitude dispersion of the seven stars is @xmath62 .",
    "note that the dispersion in apparent magnitude for these stars is @xmath44 , and drops to @xmath63 if the two outliers with larger magnitudes ( one of which has a high estimated surface gravity ) are excluded .",
    "the magnitudes are consistent with a structure that has zero depth , but the depth could be as large as @xmath64 kpc .    [ cols= \" < , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]     @xmath65 highly likely member of moving group",
    "the sdss dr7 sspp pipeline @xcite generates ten different measures of the surface gravity for each stellar spectrum , and additionally computes an  adopted \" @xmath66 , which is determined from an analysis of the ten different methods . for stars with s / n less than 10 , the adopted @xmath66 is set to an error code .",
    "we analyzed histograms of the distribution in @xmath66 of bright and faint a stars in our sample , looking for a method that showed two peaks : one at low surface gravity ( bhb stars ) , and one at high surface gravity ( bs or main sequence stars ) .",
    "several of the methods appeared to separate bright a stars by surface gravity , and none appeared to separate the stars with s / n@xmath67 very well .",
    "we selected the logg9 parameter , which is described in general terms in @xcite , in which it is referred to as the  k24 grid \" .",
    "the original reference to the method is @xcite , where the method is described in great detail .",
    "the method finds the best match between the sdss spectrum and a set of model atmospheres from @xcite , using the @xmath68 color index and the normalized spectral fluxes in the wavelength range @xmath69   , using a resolving power of @xmath70 . the surface gravities using this dr7 logg9 estimator are tabulated in table 1 .",
    "six of the seven candidate members of the moving group have surface gravities less than @xmath71 , as expected for bhb stars .",
    "subsequent to our search for spheroid structure using bhb stars , @xcite published a list of sdss dr6 a stars along with measurements of @xmath72 and @xmath73 measurements .",
    "these are classical indices used by @xcite to classify bhb stars from the @xmath74 line width and depth . using this method for determining the surface gravities of a stars , only 2 of our candidate",
    "a stars appear to be low surface gravity .",
    "there are two effects that contribute to the small fraction of confirmed bhbs : ( 1 ) the performance of the @xmath72 indicator is degraded at low signal - to - noise , and ( 2 ) we disagree with the published @xmath72 values for two of the stars .    in the top panels of figure 2 ,",
    "we show the performance of the @xmath72 , @xmath73 indicators for the set of @xmath75 stars from @xcite , and for the subset of 1176 of these stars for which the s / n of the spectrum is between 7 and 10 .",
    "while the bright , high signal - to - noise spectra that were used by @xcite are separable , the lower signal - to - noise spectra do not have two clear peaks in the diagram .",
    "we show histograms of @xmath72 for all of the stars between the two vertical lines ( @xmath76 ) in the top two panels of figure 3 .",
    "for all of the stars ( most of which are high signal - to - noise ) , we see two peaks in the @xmath72 distribution .",
    "the low s / n sample shows no separation .",
    "we compare the separation using the properties of one line of the spectrum ( @xmath77 vs. @xmath73 ) with the sspp logg9 surface gravities using photometry and the continuum levels of the spectra in the bottom panels of figures 2 and 3 .",
    "figure 2 shows that the logg9 indicator works about as well as the @xmath72 indicator for bright stars .",
    "note that in the lower right panel , for stars with marginal s / n , the distribution of stars is much wider in the vertical direction , and the width in the horizontal axis is wider but not dramatically so .",
    "the lower panels of figure 3 show histograms of logg9 for all of the stars between the two horizontal lines ( @xmath78 ) . the brighter star data on the left shows two separate peaks for low and high surface gravity stars , while the marginal s / n data in the right panel does not show that separation",
    "however , we can see from the correlation between @xmath72 and logg9 in the lower right panel of figure 2 that there is some information on the surface gravity of even these lower s / n spectra .    because we were surprised that the @xmath72 numbers could be so high , even at low signal - to - noise , for stars that we expected were bhbs in a moving group , we independently computed new values for the width of the @xmath74 at 80% of the continuum for the eight stars in table 1 . for six of them , we measured widths that were reasonably consistent with the published values .",
    "however , we measured a width of 23 for 1335 - 52824 - 167 instead of 40 , and a width of 23 for 1335 - 52824 - 008 instead of 33 . with these corrections ,",
    "six of the eight stars in table 1 have @xmath72 widths less than 30 , including all four of the stars that we will later show are highly likely members of the moving group .",
    "given that we were searching through the data by eye and looking for clusters , it is important to verify that the clustering of stars is not a chance coincidence . in this section",
    "we will estimate an upper bound for the probability that this clump could be a random fluctuation in the number of stars in a a small region of angle in the sky , magnitude , and line - of - sight velocity .",
    "most of the sky that we searched for clumps was at high galactic latitude ; at low galactic latitude the stellar population is different , the density of stars is higher , and the sky coverage is less uniform .",
    "so for statistical purposes we limited our sample to @xmath79 .",
    "there are 2893 stars in our sample with @xmath79 .",
    "the seven stars were discovered in a 19 square degree area of the sky ( compared with 8800 square degrees above @xmath79 ) , with the requirement that this sky area be rectangular in galactic latitude and longitude ( @xmath80 ) . in comparison with the entire high latitude sample of bhb candidates , the seven stars in the clump span about 1/46@xmath46 of the entire longitude range of the input data , and 1/10@xmath46 of the latitude range of the data in an equal - area plot . from figure 1",
    ", we find that the range of velocities in the clump includes @xmath81 of the sample stars , and the range of magnitudes in the clump is the same as @xmath82 of those in the high latitude sample .",
    "appendix a presents a statistical method to determine the significance of a  clump \" of data points in a @xmath83-dimensional search space . in this case",
    "we have four dimensions : galactic longitude , galactic latitude , radial velocity , and apparent magnitude .",
    "the statistical method measures the probability that random data will produce a clump of seven or more points within a four - dimensional box of the measured size . by using percentiles",
    ", we account for the non - uniformity of the data in the radial velocity and apparent magnitude dimensions .",
    "we also adjust the statistics , as explained in appendix a.4.2 , for the periodic boundary condition in galactic longitude .",
    "what is important for the calculation is that each of the dimensions be independent ( separable , in the terms of appendix a ) . in our case ,",
    "the variables are not quite independent , especially galactic coordinates .",
    "because the density of a stars with sdss spectra varies as a function of position in the sky , the relative percentiles in @xmath42 would be different if a clump of the same areal extent were discovered in a different part of the sky .",
    "we estimate that the local density in the region of the sky that the clump was found is 3.5 times higher than average .",
    "therefore , following the prescription of appendix a4.4 , we multiplied the longitude width of the clump by a factor of 3.5 .",
    "it was not possible to account for every known peculiarity of the data .",
    "for instance , when we searched for clumps we divided the sky up into fixed @xmath42 boxes , so there are regions around the edge of each @xmath42 box that were not as thoroughly searched .",
    "however , it is possible that if nothing was found with these limits we would have adjusted the box sizes and positions , so this oversight ( which would underestimate the significance of a clump ) is probably justified .    given the percentiles of the 4-d search space listed above , we expect 0.32 stars in a typical box with these dimensions . using the algorithm in appendix a , the number of clumps we should expect to find in this data that have seven or more stars in a 4-d box of these dimensions or smaller is 0.96 .",
    "since we found one clump , this is very close to random . if we eliminate one star from the sample that is an outlier in @xmath42 , so that the area of sky is now @xmath84 , @xmath85",
    ", then we calculate that the e - value for finding six or more stars in a 4-d box with these ( smaller ) dimensions is 0.18 , so the probability of finding this moving group is not more than one in six .",
    "using only these dimensions , the clump of stars is not a significant detection .    in order to claim a significant detection of the moving group represented by these seven stars ,",
    "it is necessary to compare their metallicities with the metallicities of the background population .",
    "only 30% of the stars in the sample have metallicities as low as those in the clump of seven stars . if we extend the statistical calculation to five dimensions , including metallicity , then the probability of finding seven stars in a region of this size and shape ( or smaller ) ,",
    "anywhere in the 5-d parameter space is not more than 1 in 244 ( e - value of 0.004 ) , and the probability of finding six stars in a smaller angular region in the sky ( in 5-d ) is not more than 1 in 490 ( e - value=0.002 ) .",
    "these are highly significant detections .",
    "since metallicity is critical to the detection of this substructure , we examine the sdss dr7 metallicity measurements of these stars , and bhb stars in general , in the next two sections . in section 8 ,",
    "we use the information we have learned in the analysis of this moving group to re - select similar data from sdss dr7 , and make an even stronger argument for the statistical significance of our result .",
    "all seven of the candidate bhb stars in this moving group had unmeasured metallicities in sdss dr6 , but metallicities were assigned to these same spectra in the much improved sspp pipeline of sdss dr7 @xcite .",
    "our metallicities come from the dr7 , which became public in october 2008 .",
    "the sdss dr7 tabulates many measures of the metallicities of stars , of which the most commonly used is feha , the  adopted \" metallicity , which is derived from a comparison of all methods used to measure metallicity . in this paper",
    "we use instead the metallicity of @xcite , hereafter wbg , which is specifically designed to measure the metallicities of bhb stars .",
    "the wbg metallicities of the seven bhb stars in the moving group are given in table 1 and are shown in figure 4 .",
    "the mean of the distribution is [ fe / h]@xmath86 , and the width is @xmath87 .    we now show that the metallicities of the moving group stars are not consistent with being drawn at random from the stellar halo .",
    "we selected all stars in dr7 with the same photometric constraints as the stars in the moving group , and with @xmath88 so that the bhb stars are likely to come from the same component ( the spheroid ) , and not be confused with disc populations of bhbs . to remove bhb stars in the sagittarius dwarf tidal stream from the sample , we also eliminated stars with @xmath89 .",
    "there were 298 stars with @xmath90 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and that passed the photometric low surface gravity cut .",
    "of these , 260 had measured metallicities that are shown in figure 4 .",
    "the mean of the distribution is [ fe / h]@xmath91 , and the width is @xmath92 . note that the error quoted here is a statistical error . because very few of the segue calibration stars are as blue as a stars , the systematic errors at this end are about @xmath93 .",
    "the comparison stars are about 45 kpc from the sun , and above @xmath94 , so they come from the distant halo .",
    "the blue straggler contaminants are 10 to 28 kpc away , which is also fairly far from the disc at high galactic latitudes .",
    "a comparison of the stars in the moving group with the similarly selected stars in the spheroid with a t - test gives a probability of 1 in @xmath95 that the two groups of stars were selected from the same stellar population .",
    "the mann - whitney test ( also known as the wilcoxon rank sum test ) gives a p - value of 0.00023 , or a 2 in 10,000 probability that the two samples are drawn from the same population .",
    "this leads us to conclude that the moving group is real .    as a further test",
    ", we selected the other 8 stars in the lower panel of figure 1 that have the same @xmath38 and apparent magnitude as the blue horizontal branch stars in the moving group , and find that they have a mean metallicity of @xmath96 with a sigma of 0.86 .",
    "the t - test ( p=0.948 ) shows that this distribution is not distinguishable from the background population .",
    "( performing the mann - whitney test for this sample is problematic since several of the stars are not part of our selected background distribution . )",
    "in this section we explore the accuracies of the dr7 metallicity measurements of bhb stars as a function of s / n and in comparison with published metallicities for globular clusters .",
    "we also explore the metallicity of bhb stars in the halo as a function of apparent magnitude .",
    "since all of our moving group stars have low s / n , we need to test the accuracy of the metallicity measurements .",
    "we do this by selecting bhb stars in the leading tidal tail of the sgr dwarf galaxy that are about the same distance from the sun as the moving group .",
    "we selected all of the spectra from sdss dr7 that had elodierverr@xmath97 ( if the radial velocity error when matching to the stellar templates is less than zero , that indicates that the object is not a star ) , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 km s@xmath3 , logg9@xmath103 , and @xmath104 .",
    "the 94 stars that are likely bhbs in the sgr dwarf tidal stream were divided into three files based on s / n .",
    "there were 14 stars with @xmath105s / n@xmath106 , 49 stars with @xmath107s / n@xmath67 ( excluding three with unmeasured metallicities ) , and 28 with @xmath108s / n@xmath109 .",
    "the metallicity distributions of these three s / n groups is shown in figure 5 .    the highest s / n group ( @xmath108s / n@xmath109 ) has a mean [ fe / h]@xmath110 , which is similar to the group with marginal s / n ( @xmath107s / n@xmath67 ) which has a mean [ fe / h@xmath111 . a mann - whittney test comparing these two samples gives a result of @xmath112 , @xmath113 , and a p - value of 0.165 .",
    "these distributions are not significantly different from each other .",
    "this gives us some confidence that the metallicities of the moving group stars , which have s / n measurements in this marginal range , are usefully measured .",

    ", we calculate that we would expect 0.0038 stars in a 6-d region that instead has four stars .",

    "second , the four stars are not randomly distributed within the @xmath42 box , they are tightly constrained to a line , as one would expect for a tidally disrupted globular cluster ; if our statistical analysis allowed a non - axis aligned region , the computed statistical significance would have been stronger . and third , when we calculated the density of stars in the region containing the moving group we included the moving group stars ( half of the sample of eight ) in the density calculation .",
    "this artificially inflates our galactic latitude multiplier . to estimate the effect of just this third factor",
    ", we counted the number of a stars in a slightly larger region of the sky with @xmath153 and @xmath149 and found 16 stars , of which 4 are members of the moving group .",

    ", we expect to find 0.0025 objects where we actually find four , and the expected fraction of the time a clump of four stars in this size region of 6-d space should be found in this size data set is not more than 0.0063 .",
    "we estimate the properties of a progenitor of this moving group , making the assumption that it was a globular cluster , and that we have detected the majority of the bhb stars from what was the core of the star cluster .",
    "we expect the progenitor was a globular cluster because the stars are very well aligned in the sky , have a velocity dispersion consistent with instrumental errors , and there are very few stars identified . if the progenitor was a dwarf galaxy , so that it also has younger or more metal rich components , or if we have found only a knot of increased stellar density along a longer tidal debris stream , then the inferred size of the progenitor is larger .",
    "we detected 4 - 8 bhb stars in the moving group . in the color - magnitude range in the vicinity of the moving group",

    "we selected sdss dr6 stars within about nine arcminutes of the centre of ngc 2419 ( this does not include stars near the very centre of the gc , since individual stars are not resolved there ) .",

    "we shifted the magnitudes of the color - magnitude boxes by 1.41 magnitudes ( the difference in distance modulus between our moving group and ngc 2419 ) and counted the number of stars in @xmath166 and @xmath167 .",
