    "exploration of the high redshift universe and discovery of the most distant objects is still in its infancy .",
    "only recently have the tools been available to detect normal galaxies at redshifts larger than one , when the first galaxies were created ( @xcite ) .",
    "it seems likely that young galaxies will have a variety of different signatures so that it will be necessary to use several diverse techniques to uncover all of them : searches at optical , infrared , x - ray , and radio wavelengths , for example . in particular , basing the statistical studies of the high redshift galaxies only on objects detected in the rest - frame uv could miss many young galaxies ( @xcite ) , and sampling longer wavelength ranges is necessary .",
    "we carried out a survey for infrared emission - line galaxies by imaging through narrow ( @xmath2 ) and broad band filters between 1 and 2.5@xmath3 m , identifying objects that appeared brighter in the narrow filters ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter tmb96 ) ) . our first survey was designed to uncover emission lines at the redshifts of quasars within each survey field , in case there is substantial clustering marked by quasars . in an area of 276 , only one emission - line galaxy was discovered ( @xcite ) .",
    "the surface density of such objects implied by these results is similar to that inferred from other surveys ( @xcite ) and suggests that the infrared emission - line galaxies constitute at most a modest population of young galaxies at high redshift .    using the same instruments",
    ", we undertook a second infrared survey for emission - line galaxies targeted at the redshifts of damped ly@xmath0  or metal absorption lines in the spectra of quasars .",
    "damped ly@xmath0  absorbers are thought to contain as much baryonic matter as seen in all spiral galaxies today ( @xcite ) and may , therefore , mark sites of ongoing star formation .",
    "several other groups ( @xcite ) carried out similar surveys at optical wavelengths looking for ly@xmath0  emission - line galaxies in these regions .",
    "they discovered only a few such emission - line ( non - agn ) galaxies , but @xcite showed that the implied volume density was significantly higher than in the general field .",
    "metal absorption systems also indicate that star formation has taken place , and are identifiable from the ground at lower redshifts than ly@xmath0  alone .",
    "we selected damped ly@xmath0  systems or metal absorbers whose redshifts put the main optical lines h@xmath0 , h@xmath4 , [ oiii ] , and [ oii ]  into standard narrow - band filters in the j , h and k bands .",
    "the resulting redshift ranges are : @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "special emphasis was given to the h@xmath0  line expected to be the brightest in young star systems and the least affected by dust .",
    "this letter describes the results of the new survey .",
    "as described in tmb96 , pairs of narrow and broad - band images were taken of the selected fields .",
    "most of the data , 163  in 13 fields , were obtained at the calar alto 3.5 m telescope , using the nicmos3 256@xmath8 magic cameras ( @xcite ) with a resolution of 081 per pixel .",
    "one field , 38.6 , was obtained at the same telescope with the omega prime camera using a 1024@xmath8 , hgcdte hawaii array with 040 per pixel .",
    "five more fields for a total of 26.2  were observed with the irac2b camera at the 2.2 m eso / mpi telescope at la silla .",
    "the area - weighted average limiting flux is 2.4@xmath9erg @xmath10 sec@xmath11 , or 1.6@xmath9erg @xmath10 sec@xmath11 , if only the calar alto data are considered . the comoving volume sampled by this survey at the redshift of the absorbers is about 20,600mpc@xmath12 , assuming only the target line at the appropriate redshift could be detected .",
    "considering all the four principal optical lines [ oii ] , h@xmath4  , [ oiii ]  and h@xmath0  , the total sampled volume is 90,000mpc@xmath12 ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 , assumed throughout this paper ) . for comparison ,",
    "the total sampled volume by the first survey targeting quasars redshifts is 153,000mpc@xmath12 .",
    "objects were selected if well detected in the narrow - band images , with narrow - band magnitudes exceeding the broad - band magnitudes by more than 2.5 standard deviations of the combined uncertainties in the two filters , and with derived line equivalent width larger than 50 .",
    "these criteria are easily checked by plotting objects in a color - magnitude diagram , where the color is the broad minus narrow band magnitude .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] is a color - magnitude diagram of the q0100 + 130 ( phl  957 ) field showing the detection of two candidates discovered in the j band .",
    "the candidates , denoted a & b , clearly stand out above the noise at high equivalent width , although a is near the narrow - band limit .",
    "this field also contains a ly@xmath0  emission - line galaxy discovered by @xcite and subsequentely imaged in the h@xmath15+[nii ] lines at 2.177@xmath3 m by @xcite .",
    "this object is not seen in our image , and its expected [ oii]@xmath13727  flux ( about 0.7 @xmath9 cgs ) derived from the h@xmath15 flux by @xcite is below our detection threshold ( about 1.4 @xmath9 cgs ) . neither a nor b is seen in the @xcite image , while our candidate a is barely visible on the @xcite narrow band image , implying faint h@xmath15 emission .",
    "both a and b are visible in their broad band k image , as well , thus supporting the reality of the detections in our survey .    from the color - magnitude diagrams of five of the 19 fields in this survey , we discovered 18 candidates for emission - line galaxies",
    ". the emission lines , if spectroscopically confirmed , would correspond to h@xmath0  at redshifts of 0.89 ( 6 objects ) and 2.4 ( 10 objects ) , or [ oii]@xmath13727  at a redshift of 2.3 ( 2 objects ) .",
    "most of the objects are a few seconds of arc in extent suggesting that they are galaxies at redshifts greater than a few tenths .",
    "table  1 lists the coordinates of the candidates , their offsets from the quasar , and their morphology as deduced from our images .",
    "the angular distances from the quasars are between 9  and 120 , corresponding to projected distances between 70kpc and 1mpc at the distances to the absorption - line systems .",
    "very few , if any , of these objects could , therefore , be identified with the absorption - line objects , whose typical extents are probably those of galaxies or protogalactic clumps , @xmath16kpc across ( @xcite ) . however , due to the coarse sampling in our images , no attempt was made yet to subtract a psf from the qso image , so objects within a few arcsec from the qso would not have been easily seen .",
    "table  2 gives the magnitude , a rank of the significance of the detection , the statistical signal - to - noise ratio of the emission line , and the line flux for each candidate .",
    "the final four columns give the line identification , redshift , rest equivalent width , and derived star formation rate ( @xcite ; tmb96 ) assuming the line is at the redshift of the absorption - line .",
    "the derived sfrs attribute all of the line emission to hii regions , ignoring any contribution from an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) , an assumption that may be incorrect in at least some cases ( @xcite ) .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows images of each candidate in the narrow and broad filters .",
    "the typical angular resolution is about 12 , corresponding to about @xmath17kpc for redshifts between 1 and 3 .",
    "most of the objects appear resolved even at this resolution .",
    "the field around q1623 + 268 was observed by steidel in 1996 may with the hubble space telescope using the wfpc2 camera with the f702w filter and total integration time of 87 min .",
    "two of our emission - line candidates , q1623 + 268a and q1623 + 268d , appear in these images , parts of which are shown in figure  [ fig3 ] .",
    "both objects appear to be late - type spiral or irregular galaxies .",
    "the object sizes are 24 ( q1623 + 268a ) and 36 ( q1623 + 268d ) , corresponding to 20 and 30 kpc for @xmath18 .",
    "if these objects are at the assumed redshifts , they are large , well formed galaxies . the detected star formation activity with sfrs between 5 and 10 m@xmath19/yr  would be the normal activity of late - type spiral or irregular galaxies .",
    "the most striking result of this survey is the large number of candidates discovered in a small area implying that by choosing the right redshift intervals , it is possible to detect emission - line objects rather easily .",
    "the total sky coverage in this survey was 228  compared with 276  in tmb96 , yet 18 candidates were discovered in the second survey compared to a single emission - line galaxy in the first .",
    "taken at face value , the new results suggest that damped ly@xmath0  and metal absorbers pinpoint the regions where galaxy formation is taking place .",
    "confirmation of the exact nature of these objects will require spectroscopic follow up and perhaps additional imaging with hst .",
    "since not all the objects are resolved at the coarse pixel scale used , some could be stars or other nearby objects .",
    "a few objects are near the 3@xmath20 detection limit .",
    "statistical comparison must , therefore , be regarded with some caution until further data are available .    nevertheless , we believe that the main result of this survey is robust : there are more emission - line galaxies associated with damped ly@xmath0  and metal absorber redshifts than with the redshifts of quasars or at arbitrary redshifts .",
    "first , the observational method employed was identical to that of tmb96 , but the resulting number of candidates is almost 20 times larger .",
    "second , the one candidate , ck39 , discovered in the first survey by tmb96 was also coarsely sampled but is , indeed , an emission line galaxy ( @xcite ) spectroscopically confirmed and easily resolved with the keck telescope .",
    "third , the hst images of two of our _ least _ statistically significant candidates show them to be galaxies of exactly the size expected for objects at redshifts greater than a few tenths and with the kind of morphology expected of objects in late stages of assembly .",
    "these results may be compared with similar studies of ly@xmath0  emitting galaxies in the neighborhood of damped ly@xmath0  absorption line systems . by the number of detected objects ( @xcite ) and observed fields ( @xcite ) an average comoving density of these systems of about 7@xmath21 mpc@xmath22",
    "is derived down to a limiting sfr of about 5m@xmath19/yr , assuming case b recombination and no dust .",
    "the infrared technique gives similar results , i.e. , detections in about 1/4 of the fields and a density of @xmath23mpc@xmath22 .",
    "the range of sfr implied by our observations 6 - 200m@xmath19/yr , is somewhat higher than that usually obtained by the optical searches , 5 - 20m@xmath19/yr , but not dramatically so .",
    "if there is modest local extinction to the star formation regions in high redshift galaxies , optical derived sfrs must be increased by a factors of about 3 to get the true sfr ( @xcite ) , making their range almost coincident with ours .",
    "our results are perhaps more consistent with the limiting sfr of 30 - 80m@xmath19/yralong sightlines toward eight @xmath24 damped ly@xmath0  absorbers as derived from redshifted h@xmath15 ( @xcite ) .    on the other hand , the lines could be produced by active galactic nuclei .",
    "there are several good reasons to believe this could be the case for the one emission - line object discovered in the survey of tmb96 ( @xcite ) , and that it could be a widespread phenomenon ( @xcite ) .",
    "if so , the density of such objects in these regions is considerably higher than the cosmic average .",
    "the density of known quasars at these redshifts ( e.g. , @xcite ) implies about @xmath25 quasars per field , meaning that we might be seeing far more agns than expected .",
    "although the damped ly@xmath0  redshifts mark regions with many galaxies , the nature of each single galaxy will remain a mystery until proper follow up observations will be able to distingish between emission due to star formation and agns .",
    "cold dark matter simulations of early galaxy formation produce filaments of galaxies ( @xcite ) with groups of high redshift metal and damped ly@xmath0  absorbers spanning up to several hundred kpc ( @xcite ) . if the damped ly@xmath0  absorbers actually trace the positions of these filaments , then the high detection rate of emission line galaxies in this survey may support the overall structure predicted by cdm .",
    "this conclusion can be made quantitative by measuring the average overdensity of objects near damped ly@xmath0  and metal systems with respect to tmb96 .",
    "+    we are grateful to the staffs at the calar alto observatory and eso at la silla for excellent assistance with the observations .",
    "we profited from discussions with esther hu , garth illingworth , matt malkan , ed salpeter and chuck steidel .",
    "this research was supported by the max - planck - society and also uses archival data from the hubble space telescope .",

    "<S> because a similar survey targeted at the redshifts of quasars themselves uncovered only one emission - line galaxy in a larger volume , the results imply substantial clustering of young galaxies or formation within filaments or sheets whose locations are indicated by the redshifts of absorption along the lines of sight to more distant quasars . </S>"
