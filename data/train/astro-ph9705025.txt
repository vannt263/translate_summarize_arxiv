    "high energy gamma ray emission from the crab pulsar was observed by satellite - borne telescopes for 15 years : in 1972 - 73 by sas-2 ( kniffen et al .",
    "1974 ) , from 1975 - 82 by cos - b ( clear et al . 1987 ) , and since 1991 by egret ( nolan et al . 1993 ; ramanamurthy et al . 1995 ) .",
    "early observations showed possible sinusoidal variation in the relative intensities of the two peaks ( wills et al .",
    "1982 ) with a time scale of @xmath0 years , and it was suggested that this variation might be due to the precession or free nutation of the neutron star ( kanbach 1990 , zel 1991 ) .",
    "an apparent confirmation of the sinusoidal signal was seen in the low energy gamma ray emission ( ulmer et al .",
    "1994 ) , matched in phase and period with the high energy results , but with a smaller amplitude .",
    "egret data from 1991 through early 1994 were consistent with the expected variation ( nolan et al .",
    "1993 , ramanamurthy et al . 1995 ) , although these observations spanned a time when the ratio of the peaks was predicted to be fairly constant , near the minimum of the sinusoid .",
    "egret observations have now extended the available data by over two years .",
    "the most recent data were expected to be @xmath1 from the average of the previous values if the sinusoidal model is correct .",
    "the egret instrument is a spark chamber gamma - ray telescope with an energy range of 30  mev  30  gev .",
    "details of the instrument design , calibration , and standard analysis software are given in thompson et al .",
    "( 1993 ) .",
    "all viewing periods where egret was pointed within @xmath2 of the crab were analyzed , with the exception of viewing period 0021 ( 1991 jul 815 ) , in which there was a large solar flare .",
    "the compton observatory viewing period numbers and dates for these observations are shown in table 1 .",
    "the eight viewings numbered 4120 through 5280 ( 1995 feb . through 1996 aug . )",
    "have been completed since the time of the previous work of ramanamurthy et al .",
    "( 1995 ) .",
    "all photons with measured energy above 50 mev , which were within an energy - dependent cone of half - angle @xmath3 were used in this analysis .",
    "the angle @xmath3 , chosen such that @xmath4 of the photons originating from the pulsar are within the acceptance cone , is given by ( thompson et al .",
    "1993 ) @xmath5 the arrival time of each detected photon was transformed to solar system barycentric time using the de200 ephemeris , then binned according to the pulsar phase at that time , determined from the princeton pulsar timing database ( arzoumanian et al .",
    "this analysis was performed using the pulsar program ( fierro 1995 ) .    as seen in figure 1 ,",
    "the light curve was divided into several sections , including peak 1 ( phase .94  .04 ) , peak 2 ( phase .32  .46 ) , and the off - pulse background ( phase .46  .94 ) .",
    "these definitions follow those used in the cos - b analysis ( wills et al .",
    "1982 ) and are similar to those used by nolan et al .",
    "( 1993 ) and ramanamurthy et al .",
    "the background ( from the crab nebula , nearby sources , and the diffuse galactic radiation ) was assumed constant as a function of pulsar phase .",
    "the off - pulse count rate was then used to find the background - subtracted counts estimates of the two peaks ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) . in order to avoid any effects of changes in instrument performance ,",
    "the evolution of the ratio @xmath8 was examined ( as in previous analyses ) .",
    "the two peaks have slightly different energy spectra ( nolan et al .",
    "1993 ) , and the egret response at different energies has changed at different rates ( esposito et al .",
    "thus the ratio @xmath8 is affected by the changes in instrument performance over time .",
    "calculations of this effect , however , indicate that it is an order of magnitude smaller than the errors in @xmath8 due to poisson fluctuations .",
    "the differences in the energy responses of the sas-2 , cos - b , and egret instruments are larger than the variation in the egret response . however , statistical errors in the previous instruments data are larger as well .",
    "thus the value of @xmath8 obtained from egret data should be comparable to that obtained with sas-2 and cos - b .",
    "the values of @xmath8 obtained , together with the @xmath9 errors , are shown in table 1 .",
    "a reduced data set , where nearby points are joined for clarity , is shown in figure 2 .",
    "the data were fit with a constant , yielding @xmath10 , with @xmath11 with 20 degrees of freedom ( dof ) .",
    "such a low value of @xmath12 might imply that the errors in the data were over - estimated . in this case , however , the errors arise purely from statistical poisson fluctuations , and the low value must occur purely by chance .",
    "the data are very consistent with a constant value of @xmath8 .",
    "the data were also fit with a straight line ( @xmath13 with 19 dof ) , and a quadratic ( @xmath14 with 18 dof ) .",
    "neither result gives a significantly better fit : the egret data are most consistent with no variation .",
    "the egret data were also analyzed in conjunction with the sas-2 ( kanbach 1990 ) and cos - b ( clear et al .",
    "1987 ) data .",
    "the best fit sinusoid to the previous instruments data , @xmath15 where t is the year of the observation , and to the combined data set , @xmath16 are shown together with the data and the average value of p2/p1 in figure 3 .    as can be seen ,",
    "the most recent egret observations ( the last data point ) are much less consistent with the large amplitude sinusoid .",
    "the constant value of @xmath17 gives a @xmath18 ( with 27 dof ) , indicating a good fit .",
    "the sinusoid fit to the combined data gives a period of 11.6 years with @xmath19 ( with 24 dof ) , which does not represent a significant improvement .",
    "thus , using the combined data sets , the data are most consistent with no variation in p2/p1 .",
    "the light curves obtained from phase 1 data ( apr 91sept 92 ) and from phases 4 and 5 ( feb 95aug 96 ) are shown in figure 1 .",
    "the overall shape seems to have changed little , in contrast with the expected change if the 14 year cycle were correct .",
    "a @xmath12 test was performed to compare the two light curves in a quantitative way . in order to take out possible systematic effects , both an additive offset and a multiplicative factor for the second light curve",
    "were fit to the data .",
    "the resulting @xmath20 ( with 48 dof ) is consistent with no change in the light curve . without the offset , @xmath21 ( with 49 dof )",
    "was obtained , indicating an inconsistency at the 99.95% confidence level .",
    "the offset required indicates a lower background level in the later observations .",
    "this could be due to a change in the nebular emission ( de jager et al .",
    "1996 ) , or could be a result of changes in the performance of egret . as the gas in the spark chamber ages , the sensitive area at low energies decreases , which decreases the width of the average point spread function .",
    "this effect might lower the background in the later observations .",
    "recent observations with egret have provided data relevant to the reported variation in the p2/p1 ratio of the crab pulsar .",
    "data from sas-2 and cos - b suggested a sinusoidal variation in this ratio .",
    "the egret data , both taken alone and in conjunction with the data from previous instruments , are most consistent with a constant value of p2/p1 .",
    "examination of the light curves from early and later observations shows no distinct changes in the pulsar s light curve .",
    "the egret data can not , of course , rule out past variability in the p2/p1 ratio .",
    "future observations by egret and its successors may allow a more precise characterization of the long term behavior of the crab s light curve .",
