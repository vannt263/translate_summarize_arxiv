    "the pierre auger observatory , combining fluorescence telescopes with an extensive air shower array of water cherenkov detectors , is well apt to the study of cosmic rays at the highest energies ( @xmath1 ev ) .",
    "the use of the two techniques allows the determination of the primary energy improved with respect to former arrays and with no basic dependence on interaction models and hypothesis on the primary composition .",
    "the technique is based on the calibration of the energy estimator of the surface detector ( sd ) through the fluorescence detector data ( fd ) : the sd provides the required statistics thanks to its collecting area and its much larger duty cycle ( around 100% ) . the signal measured at a specific distance from the shower axis , @xmath2 ,",
    "is well established as an energy estimator for the surface detector : in the auger observatory @xmath3 is 1000 m. the accuracy in the determination of such estimator depends on the detector resolution and sampling fluctuations , and on shower fluctuations in the longitudinal development , since the measurement is performed at a single , fixed atmospheric depth",
    ". moreover , the sd energy estimator is not directly measured , but interpolated by a fit to a lateral distribution function ( hereafter called ldf ) . in this paper , we present the results of a study of the accuracies in the event reconstruction and in the determination of the energy estimator by the sd , in view of the measurement of the energy spectrum .",
    "with respect to the uncertainties arising from the detector sampling different kinds of shower particles and from the ldf shape , since it is not possible to rely on theoretical predictions , these studies are performed using the experimental data themselves . on the other side ,",
    "simulations are needed to evaluate the uncertainties due to cascade fluctuations and to justify the choice of @xmath0 as energy estimator . + after giving in section 2 a brief description of the pierre auger array , we will present in section 3 the event reconstruction technique and the systematic and statistical accuracies in the determination of @xmath0 and core position .",
    "we will discuss in section 4 the effects of shower fluctuations and the stability of @xmath0 with respect to such fluctuations .",
    "the surface detector of the pierre auger observatory is extensively described in @xcite .",
    "we will limit here to describe the characteristics of the detector relevant to the analysis discussed in the following sections .",
    "+ the water in each cherenkov detector is viewed with three 9  diameter photomultipliers .",
    "signals are extracted from the anode and from the last dynode ( amplified by a factor 40 , resulting in a dynode - to - anode ratio of 32 ) and are then converted , after appropriate calibration ( see @xcite for a detailed description ) , in units of vertical equivalent muons ( vem ) .",
    "the vem is the unit used in the subsequent analysis , both for the ldf and the reconstruction of @xmath0 .",
    "+ a hierarchical trigger sequence ( fully described in @xcite ) is used to identify a cosmic ray event .",
    "the lowest level is imposed on each single station , which is fired if the signal satisfies either a 3-fold coincidence of 1.75 vem on each pmt dynode or a 2-fold coincidence of 13 bins exceeding 0.2 vem within a 3@xmath4s window .",
    "the highest level triggers are realized to select physical events , and , for each of them , the stations ( @xmath5 ) which are not due to chance coincidences .",
    "the event reconstruction is applied to all the physical events , and among them `` quality '' events are selected .",
    "the `` quality '' cuts , which will be used in the following analysis , select showers with the highest signal recorded in a tank surrounded by at least five operating ones , and the reconstructed core within a triangle of working stations .",
    "+ the arrival directions are measured from the relative arrival times of the signals in the selected stations @xcite , while the core position , ( @xmath6 ) , and @xmath0 are determined from the water cherenkov signals recorded by each selected station , through a fit to a formula describing the ldf .",
    "the reconstruction is based on a maximum likelihood method , in which the signals measured by each station , @xmath7 , are compared with those expected from a lateral distribution function ( ldf ) , @xmath8 .",
    "determination of the ldf is described in @xcite and it is represented by a nishimura - kamata - greisen form : + @xmath9 ^{-\\beta}$ ] , with @xmath10 m , @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "+ the likelihood function includes : + ( i ) a term due to fired stations .",
    "this is is given by : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the uncertainty in the signal measurement @xcite .",
    "for fired stations with a saturated anode signal in at least one channel , @xmath15 is the signal deduced using the undershoots on the dynode and anode channels , and due to the coupling capacitors of the bases . in this case @xmath16 and @xmath17 , for anode undershoot @xmath18 adc channel and @xmath19 adc channel , respectively .",
    "+ ( ii ) a term due to the stations which are below trigger threshold , up to 10 km from a triggered one .",
    "the contribution of these stations is described by a poisson law , with no - detection probability , @xmath20 , up to 4 vem : @xmath21      the statistical accuracies in the measurement of ( @xmath22 and @xmath0 are obtained by fluctuating the signals detected in each station , @xmath7 , adopting a gaussian law with mean value corresponding to @xmath7 and r.m.s .",
    "the reconstruction procedure is then applied to the `` fluctuated '' event , and repeated 30 times .",
    "the widths of the distributions of @xmath0 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 provide the statistical uncertainty : we show in figure [ fig1 ] the behavior of @xmath26 vs @xmath0 , and in figure [ fig2 ] the distribution of the differences in core location .",
    "+ the dependence of systematic uncertainties on the determination of ( @xmath27 ) and @xmath0 arising from the assumed form of the ldf has been investigated .",
    "the systematic differences are at the level of about 4% with fluctuations around 4% for either a log - log parabola or the nkg - like form with different @xmath28 @xcite , thus showing that the determination of @xmath0 is quite stable with respect to the choice of the ldf .",

    ", we considered only events with the maximum signal detected by a tank surrounded by a full circle of operating detectors , i.e. , six .",
    "we hence artificially switched off one or more of the fired stations to simulate a shift of the event toward the boundaries , or to simulate the effect of a missing internal station . in any case",
    "we preserved the quality criterion of five operating tanks surrounding the one with the maximum signal , and we repeated the reconstruction procedure .",
    "we show in figure [ fig4 ] the ratio between @xmath0 after the artificial boundary shift or loss of an internal tank , and the original @xmath0 : the systematic difference is @xmath31 2% while the fluctuations are @xmath31 8% .",

    "intrinsic fluctuations in the process of development of the showers in the atmosphere are a further source of uncertainties in @xmath0 , different for different primary cosmic ray mass .",
    "such fluctuations were studied by monte carlo simulations using the aires package @xcite .",
    "the air showers were simulated for various energies , zenith angles , primary types and interaction models ( qgsjet and sibyll ) .",

    "we have shown that for the geometry of the surface detector of the pierre auger observatory the water cherenkov signal at a distance of 1000 m from the shower core , @xmath0 , is the best energy estimator , for all primaries and zenith angles .",
