    "nuclear emulsions were largely used during the last century and are connected to many discoveries in the early days of nuclear and particle physics . since the production and the measurements were carried out manually , the amount of emulsions used for the experiments was quite small@xcite .",
    "significant improvements in the emulsion technique and the development of fast automated scanning systems during the last two decades@xcite have made possible the use of nuclear emulsions in large scale experiments like opera at the infn gran sasso underground laboratories .",
    "opera is a long baseline experiment@xcite designed to search for @xmath2 oscillations in the parameter range suggested by atmospheric neutrino experiments@xcite .",
    "the goal is to observe the appearance of the short - lived @xmath3 leptons in a pure @xmath4 beam produced by the cngs facility at cern@xcite .",
    "the @xmath3 lepton is directly identified through its decay topologies which need track position and angular measurements with accuracies of @xmath5 micron and a few milliradiants respectively .",
    "nuclear emulsions are made of micro - crystals of silver halides ( agbr ) dispersed in a gelatin layer .",
    "the energy released by ionizing particles to the crystals , produces a latent image which is stable in time .",
    "a chemical development process reduces the irradiated grains to metallic ag . after fixing and washing to remove undeveloped crystals",
    "the gelatin is transparent ; the path of an ionizing particle is visible as a sequence of black silver grains about 0.5 @xmath6 m in size @xcite .    in order to see the track of a particle in emulsion , almost 30 developed grains every 100 @xmath6 m of path are necessary .",
    "the grains which accidentally develop are randomly distributed in the emulsion volume and their concentration should be @xmath7 in 1000 @xmath6m@xmath8 .    in the opera detector , as in other recent experiments ,",
    "the emulsions are used as thin films : a pair of emulsion layers ( 44  @xmath6 m thick ) is mounted on both sides of a plastic base ( 205  @xmath6 m thick ) @xcite .",
    "the opera detector is a hybrid system consisting of electronic detectors and a massive lead - emulsion target segmented into @xmath9 _ bricks _ ( fig .",
    "[ fi : operatarget ] ) .",
    "a _ brick _ is a sequence of 56 lead sheets , acting as target , interleaved with 57 emulsion sheets , acting as high precision trackers , and satisfies the need of both a large mass and a high precision tracking capability . with the cngs neutrino beam@xcite at its nominal intensity ,",
    "@xmath10 neutrino selected interactions per day are expected . therefore",
    ", @xmath11 emulsion sheets per day must be ( partially ) scanned in order to find the vertex and analyze the event . in total , @xmath12@xmath13 per day have to be analyzed with a sub - micrometric precision per 5 years of data taking .     _ bricks _ which are sequences of lead and emulsion sheets.[fi : operatarget ] ]",
    "new automatic fast automatic scanning systems have been developed : the european scanning system ( ess ) and the s - uts in japan .     ]    the ess ( fig .",
    "[ fi : esslayout ] and fig .",
    "[ fi : ess ] ) is based on the use of commercial hardware components or developed in collaboration with specialized companies .",
    "the ess is able to scan an emulsion volume of 44 @xmath6 m thickness with a speed of 20 @xmath1/h .",
    "this represents an improvement of more than an order of magnitude with respect to the systems developed in the past .",
    "the japanese s - uts system uses a dedicated hardware suitable for point scanning with a speed of 1.2 s / prediction ( @xmath14 15 min / brick ) .    ]    by adjusting the focal plane of the objective , the whole 44 @xmath6 m emulsion thickness is spanned and a sequence of 15 tomographic images of each field of view , taken at equally spaced depth levels ( 3 @xmath6 m ) , is obtained .",
    "emulsion images are digitized , converted into a grey scale of 256 levels , sent to a vision processor board , hosted in the control workstation , and analyzed to recognize sequences of aligned grains ( clusters of dark pixels of given shape and size ) .    the three - dimensional structure of a track in an emulsion layer",
    "is reconstructed by combining clusters belonging to images at different levels and searching for geometrical alignments",
    ". a linear fit to these clusters allows the determination of the track position and angle . after emulsion sheets alignment ,",
    "tracks are reconstructed in the entire brick ( fig .",
    "[ fi : trackreco ] ) .    ]",
    "several test exposures at pions beams were performed to estimate the scanning performances .",
    "the scanning systems are successfully running with high efficiency ( @xmath1590% ) , good signal / background ratio ( @xmath16 $ ] ) and the design speed of 20 @xmath1/h . position and angular resolutions at small incident angles are @xmath17 = 1 @xmath6 m and @xmath18 = 2 mrad ( fig .",
