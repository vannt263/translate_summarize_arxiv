    "the strong supression of hadron yields at high transverse momentum in central heavy - ion collisions at rhic , compared to yields in p+p scaled by the number of binary nucleon - nucleon collisions has been regarded as a manifestation of the extremely dense color charged medium created in the collision @xcite . such a dense medium is expected to strongly enhance the energy loss of a hard - scattered parton and modify its fragmentation . a well suited tool to study jet production and to address their in - medium modification are azimuthal angular correlations with respect to a leading hadron .",
    "already the pioneering studies at sps have revealed broadening of the away - side in central pb - au collisions at @xmath0  agev / c @xcite and the recent studies at rhic show further modifications to the correlation pattern @xcite .",
    "the present study is based on the analysis of 30 million pb - au events at @xmath0  agev / c recorded with the ceres spectrometer at sps in the year 2000 .",
    "the momenta of the charged particles are determined by the curvatures of their tracks in the radial time projection chamber ( tpc ) .",
    "the achieved momentum resolution is @xmath4  gev / c  @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the detector acceptance is @xmath6 in azimuth and @xmath7 to @xmath8 in pseudo - rapidity .",
    "the centrality and the number of participating nucleons have been estimated with the nuclear overlap model calculation @xcite using the charged particle multiplicities in the silicon drift detectors ( sdd ) and the tpc .",
    "the data set has been subdivided into three centrality samples according to the @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 most central events , respectively .",
    "+ for the analysis of leading hadron correlations , we follow a scheme presented by the phenix collaboration @xcite .",
    "we select trigger particles in the range @xmath12  gev / c  @xmath13  gev / c and calculate the azimuthal angular difference @xmath14 with respect to associated particles with @xmath15  gev / c  @xmath16  gev / c in the same event .",
    "the normalized yield @xmath17 has been divided by the normalized yield @xmath18 obtained from mixed event pairs to form a correlation function : @xmath19 . due to the limited two - track resolution pairs of tracks with @xmath20  mrad",
    "have been rejected in the same- and mixed event sample .",
    "the resulting correlation functions are shown in fig .",
    "the non - zero two - particle flow contribution ( @xmath21 ) has been approximated by ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "the flow values ( @xmath23 ) for the trigger and ( @xmath24 ) for associated particles have been obtained from the reaction plane method @xcite .",
    "the resulting flow contributions are shown as solid lines in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . in order to extract the ( di-)jet signal",
    ", the correlation function is decomposed into two contributions : one proportional to the distribution of the background pairs ( containing flow ) , and the second @xmath25 representing the ( di-)jet pairs : @xmath26 .",
    "the parameter @xmath27 is chosen to match the zero yield at minimum ( zyam ) condition @xcite .",
    "after the flow contribution is subtracted from the correlation function , the fully corrected ( di-)jet pair distribution @xmath28 can be constructed .",
    "the conditional yield distribution of jet - associated particles per trigger is given by : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the number of triggers and @xmath31 the total number of @xmath32 pairs in the event sample .",
    "the conditional yields have been corrected for the single hadron efficiency estimated to be @xmath33 at laboratory momenta greater than @xmath15  gev / c .",
    "this correction leads to a @xmath34 systematic uncertainty on the absolute normalization .",
    "furthermore , the data sample has been divided into like - sign and unlike - sign pairs with respect to e.m .",
    "charge of the trigger and associated particle .",
    "corresponding correlation functions are shown in the upper panel of the fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .    ) and ( @xmath35 ) varied according to their statistical uncertainties .",
    "conditional yields of the jet - pair distributions for the three centrality bins , normalized to the number of triggers .",
    "the full , horizontal bands represent the systematic uncertainty resulting from the flow constant @xmath27 estimation by the zyam method . ]",
    "the yields of the ( di-)jet associated particles in the lower panel of the fig . [ fig1 ] show significant modification of the away side as compared to the expected shapes from p+p collisions . additionally , the away side structure in the central collisions develops a pronounced plateau , as compared to the less central sample , possibly indicating a local minimum at @xmath36 in the case of unlike - sign pairs .",
    "the substantial modification of the back - to - back structure is possibly caused by large re - interaction of the scattered partons in the medium .",
    "these findings , qualitatively similar to the observations at rhic @xcite , suggest that conceivable mechanisms such as conical flow emerging from supersonic partons in a thermalized colored medium @xcite may also be at work at sps .",
    "+ furthermore , the strength of the near side correlation for the unlike - sign pairs is larger than for the like - sing pairs .",
    "this may be due to charge ordering in the fragmentation process .",
    "on the other hand , the observed di - jet yield on the away - side is largest for the like - sign pairs .",
    "this behaviour is also observed in p+p events generated with pythia at @xmath37  gev / c , however , the away - side yield difference between the like - sign and unlike - sign correlations vanishes at higher energies .",
    "+ the correlations presented here are under further investigations , also by means of the three - particle correlations .",
