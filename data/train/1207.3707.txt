    "for large detuning , by utilizing berry phase , the eigenstates of the interacting hamiltonian will give rise to an effective @xmath3 gauge potential ( see method section ) @xmath24 , where @xmath25 are the pauli matrices , @xmath26 is the total wave vector of the laser fields and @xmath27 is the relative wave vector , @xmath28 $ ] .",

    "then neglecting the trapping potential and the constant terms , the effective hamiltonian of cold atom reads @xmath33 in which @xmath34 is the kinetic energy , @xmath35 is an effective charge , @xmath36 is a non - relativistic dimensionless strength factor ( assuming the light velocity @xmath37 ) , @xmath38\\sigma _",
    "{ z}$ ] @xmath39 is a scalar potential originating from construction of @xmath40 .",
    "it is generally known that the so coupling appears in @xmath4 gauge potential , hence to construct so coupling , let s reduce the @xmath3 gauge potential @xmath41 to @xmath4 potential .",
    "firstly , we denote @xmath42 as a unit vector which follows the direction of magnetic field , and define the direction vector of internal @xmath3 space as @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is time , @xmath45 .",
    "the definition implies that we have chosen the same directions for the external and the internal spaces at the initial time .",
    "then along the direction vector @xmath46 , @xmath41 will be decomposed to two gauge potentials @xmath47 @xcite , with @xmath48,\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\mathcal{b}=[\\sigma,\\nabla _ { 0}\\sigma],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 $ ] represents the time component of covariant derivative , @xmath31 $ ] denotes the commutator . according to reduction theorem ,",
    "when @xmath41 is reducible to @xmath4 potential , there should be @xmath50 therefore , if @xmath41 is a @xmath4 potential , @xmath51 .",
    "we view @xmath52 is the abelian part of @xmath41 , and the potential @xmath53 is the non - abelian part .",
    "now let s discuss the physical meaning of the constraint condition @xmath54 .",
    "this condition actually is a parallel transportation . taking the planck constant @xmath55",
    ", @xmath56 will correspond to hamiltonian operator . neglecting the scalar potential @xmath57 and setting the effective charge @xmath58",
    ", we obtain @xmath59=[\\sigma,\\mathcal{a}_{0}]$ ] , the constraint condition becomes @xmath60.\\ ] ] this equation is nothing but the equation of motion of spin .",
    "therefore , the constraint condition in fact corresponds to the equation of motion of spin , and the direction vector @xmath46 corresponds to the spin operators of the system , as shown in fig .",
    "we conclude that , only when the non - abelian gauge potential @xmath41 satisfies the constraint condition@xmath61 , @xmath41 is suited for constructing so coupling .",
    "if the constraint condition can not be satisfied , the gauge potential @xmath62 in @xmath41 will exist and only @xmath52 is suited for constructing so coupling in this case .",
    "we now add the scalar potential @xmath57 to the effective hamiltonian to check whether @xmath63 satisfies the constraint condition or not .",
    "the constraint condition can be rewritten as @xmath64 + [ \\mathcal{a}_{0},\\sigma]$ ] . because the scalar potential is a non - abelian potential , we find @xmath65 .",
    "in this situation , the so coupling term of cold atom reads @xmath66 , with its explicit expression @xmath67 the coupling strength factors @xmath68 and @xmath69 are @xmath70 $ ] and @xmath71 , respectively , in which the initial direction of @xmath46 is pointed to @xmath41 in the @xmath3 space .",
    "since the non - abelian gauge potential @xmath41 does not satisfy the constraint condition , there will be a residual term left in the hamiltonian after constructing so coupling .",

    "the potential @xmath53 is a gauge covariant potential , it has a mass term @xmath74 $ ] .",
    "writing down the action of non - abelian gauge field , the mass reads @xmath75 ( see method section ) .",
    "consequently , the effective hamiltonian of cold atom can be written as @xmath76 , in which @xmath77 it is clear that the hamiltonian @xmath78 describes an excitation .",
    "@xmath72 can be viewed as the kinetic energy of the coupling between the excitation and the atom .",
    "the scalar potential @xmath79 in fact describes the coupling between the mass of the excitation and the atom , where @xmath80 is a dimensionless coupling factor .",
    "let s discuss the origin of the excitation . as shown in fig .",
    "2 , the original direction of @xmath81 presents @xmath3 symmetry in the internal space , its direction can be chosen freely . nevertheless , when @xmath63 is used to construct so coupling , the direction of @xmath46 is confined to the constraint condition , and the initial symmetry is broken .",
    "yet in general , the whole @xmath41 can not be suited for constructing so coupling , so there is a trend to restore the initial symmetry .",
    "the potential @xmath53 just plays the role of an excited field which restores the initial symmetry .",
    "we treat the excitation as higgs - like excitation . due to the excitation , the gauge field @xmath41 obtains mass .",
    "note that the excitations are different from the appearance of higgs bosons in dynamic gauge field .",
    "the appearance of higgs bosons requires local gauge invariance , while the gauge field discussed here is induced by berry phase , it is not dynamic and lack the local gauge invariance",
    ".      the trajectories of single cold atom contributed by excitation can be calculated from the equation of motion @xmath82 $ ] .",
    "as shown in fig .",

    "3b shows the dispersion of @xmath78 .",
    "the dispersion is linear , and the energy does not vanish at zero momentum due to the presence of excited mass @xmath83 .",
    "next , let s discuss the impact of the excitations to the cold atom system .",
    "a two - dimensional harmonic potential @xmath84 is chosen to trap the cold atoms .",
    "the relationship between the particle number @xmath85 and the trap frequency @xmath86 can be obtained by solving the equation @xmath87 in which @xmath88\\ ] ] is the density profile of the cold atom system , @xmath89^{-1}$ ] are the spin - depending fermi distributions with @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 are the boltzmann constant and temperature .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by ( see method section ) @xmath93 where @xmath94 is a characteristic mass of the system .",
    "the relationship is shown in fig .",
    "we now discuss the spin hall currents of the system . in order to generate spin hall currents , the wave vectors of the lasers",
    "are chosen as @xmath95 , the internal space is rotated @xmath96 around the @xmath97 direction . in this case , the so coupling reads @xmath98 .",
    "this term describes the spin hall currents in which the spin is polarized to @xmath99 direction while the currents move along @xmath100 direction .",
    "the spin hall currents can be written as @xmath101 where @xmath102 are the single particle currents , @xmath103_{+}$ ] are the spin current operators , @xmath104 $ ] is the velocity along @xmath100 direction .",
    "the impact of the excitations to the spin hall currents is shown in fig .",
    "it demonstrates that the spin down current is suppressed by the increase of the excited mass , while the spin up current grows slightly .",
    "the evolution of the atomic density profile @xmath105 is shown in fig . 5b .",
    "let s discuss the observation of the higgs - like excitations by detecting the spin hall currents .",
    "we can choose @xmath106 atoms for a three - level @xmath5-type system , the particle number is about @xmath107 , a @xmath108 harmonic potential is used to trap the atoms .",
    "the configuration of four laser fields is shown in fig .",
    "the wave number of the lasers can be taken as @xmath109 @xcite .",
    "for a large detuning , the rabi frequency and the detuning are required to satisfy @xmath110 . when the laser fields are turned on , a non - abelian gauge potential is applied to the @xmath106 atoms . by tuning the angle @xmath15 between the lasers , different masses of excitations",
    "can be obtained .    to detect the spin up current ,",
    "we firstly initialize the atoms in @xmath6 state .",
    "then a raman pulse is applied between the states @xmath6 and @xmath7 to transfer the atoms to spin up state @xmath111 .",
    "the rabi frequency of the pulse is required to match the spatial variation of @xmath111 . turning on the lasers",
    ", the cold atoms will experience the so coupling , and couple to the excitations .",
    "after a time @xmath44 , we turn off the lasers and apply a reversal raman pulse to transfer the atoms back to the initial state . by using the time of flight measurement , the spin up current of the system can be determined .",
    "the measurement of the spin down current ( corresponding to the @xmath112 state ) also can be detected in the same manner @xcite .",
    "in this report , we investigated the higgs - like excitations , which distinguish from the higgs amplitude mode , in cold atom system . in condensed matter physics ,",
    "the higgs amplitude mode is collective excitations which are generated by interactions between particles in many - body system , the interactions induce the system to go through a spontaneous breaking of continuous symmetry , and the higgs amplitude mode emerges",
    ". nevertheless , the higgs - like excitations are single - particle excitations which have nothing to do with interactions between particles , as shown by fig .",
    "2 , the emergence of higgs - like excitations is due to the breaking of parallel transportation of non - abelian gauge potential .",
    "moreover , the higgs amplitude mode is independent of the so coupling , while the higgs - like excitations can connect to so coupling .",
    "the impact of the higgs - like excitations to the spin hall currents is shown in fig .",
    "it demonstrates that the spin down current is suppressed , while the spin up current grows slightly by the increase of the excited mass .",
    "we discuss how to observe the higgs - like excitations through the detection of spin hall currents in real experiment .",
    "it should be noted that the results we obtain not only confine in cold atom system , but also can apply to systems concerning berry phase .",
