    "the distributions of mesons at large transverse momenta in @xmath4 or @xmath5 collisions are usually calculated in the framework of perturbative qcd using collinear factorization ( see e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "while the shape at transverse momenta larger than 2 - 4 gev can be relatively well explained , there are discrepancies at lower transverse momenta . in this analysis",
    ", the calculations are performed using a new approach , based on the unintegrated parton distributions . in recent years",
    "only gluon degrees of freedom are taken explicitly in this context @xcite . in the present analysis , in addition to the @xmath6 mechanism",
    ", we include also @xmath7 and @xmath8 mechanisms and similar ones for antiquarks , in order to obtain a fully consistent description .",
    "the new contributions @xmath7 and @xmath8 are comparable to the contribution of the @xmath6 diagram at midrapidities and are dominant in the fragmentation region .",
    "the new mechanisms are responisible for @xmath9 asymmetry .",
    "a purely gluonic mechanism would lead to identical production of positively and negatively charged hadrons .",
    "the recent results of the brahms experiment @xcite show that the @xmath10 and @xmath11 ratios differ from unity .",
    "this put into question the successful description of ref.@xcite . in the light of this experiment ,",
    "it becomes obvious that the large rapidity regions have more complicated flavour structure . at lower energies these ratios",
    "are known to differ from unity drastically @xcite .",
    "many unintegrated gluon distributions in the literature are ad hoc parametrizations of different sets of experimental data rather than derived from qcd .",
    "recently kwieciski and collaborators @xcite have shown how to solve the so - called ccfm equations by introducing unintegrated parton distributions in the space conjugated to the transverse momenta @xcite .",
    "we present results for pion and kaon production based on the unintegrated parton ( gluon , quark , antiquark ) distributions .",
    "the formulae for inclusive quark / antiquark distributions are similar to the formula for @xmath6 @xcite @xmath12 these seemingly 4-dimensional integrals can be written as 2-dimensional integrals after a suitable change of variables @xcite .",
    "the formulae can be written in the equivalent way in terms of the parton distributions in the space conjugated to the transverse momentum @xcite .",
    "there are a few sets of fragmentation functions available in the literature , details were described e.g. in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . the inclusive distributions of hadrons ( pions , kaons , etc .",
    ") can be obtained through a convolution of inclusive distributions of partons and flavour - dependent fragmentation functions .",
    "one dimensional distributions of hadrons can be obtained through the integration over the other variable ( see @xcite ) .",
    "in fig .  [ fig : pions_pt ] we compare the model invariant cross sections for @xmath13 ( left panel ) and @xmath14 ( middle panel ) as a function of pion transverse momentum at w = 27.4 gev for different values of the parameter @xmath15 of our gaussian nonperturbative form factor ( for explanation see @xcite ) with the experimental data from ref.@xcite , @xcite . in principle , the result should not exceed experimental data especially in the perturbative regime of @xmath16 2 gev where the perturbative @xmath17 parton subprocesses are crucial .",

    "the asymmetry is well described by this model , in contrast to individual distributions .",
    "this seems to suggest the right relative contributions of diagram @xmath23 ( gg @xmath2 g ) , @xmath20 and @xmath22 .",
    "the asymmetry depends only weakly on the value of the parameter @xmath15 of the gaussian nonperturbative form factor .",

    "we present dependence of the invariant cross section for kaon production , calculated for w = 27.4 gev , on the value of the parameter @xmath15 of the gaussian nonperturbative form factor .",
    "the data for @xmath27 @xmath28 0.5 gev are well described by the @xmath3-factorisation approach with the kwieciski updfs for the parameter @xmath15 @xmath29 0.5 gev@xmath19 .",
    "this is the same value of the paramater as that obtained for pions in the same energy range ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : pions_pt ] ) .",
    "more examples can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
