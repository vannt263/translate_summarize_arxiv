    "understanding the mechanism of generating the baryon asymmetry of the universe has been one of the most important issues in particle physics and cosmology for a long time . in order to generate the baryon asymmetry from the baryon symmetric initial state ,",
    "the following sakharov s three conditions have to be satisfied  @xcite : 1 ) baryon number nonconservation , 2 ) c and cp violation , 3 ) departure from the thermal equilibrium .",
    "the electroweak gauge theory can naturally satisfy the above three conditions .",
    "the baryon number nonconservation is realized by the sphaleron process at high temperature .",
    "the c violation can naturally occur in chiral gauge theories , and cp violating phases can remain in the matter sector after rephasing .",
    "finally , the circumstance of thermal non - equilibrium can appear if the electroweak phase transition ( ewpt ) is of strongly first order .",
    "this scenario is often called the electroweak baryogenesis  @xcite .",
    "the most attractive feature of this scenario would be its testability .",
    "the scenario is necessarily related to the dynamics of electroweak symmetry breaking , so that it can be directly tested by measuring the higgs boson properties at collider experiments",
    ". currently , higgs boson searches are underway at the tevatron and the lhc .",
    "we expect that the physics of electroweak symmetry breaking will be clarified in near future",
    ". then the models of electroweak baryogenesis can be experimentally tested .    in the standard model ( sm )",
    ", it is found that the cp violation by the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa matrix is quantitatively insufficient  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the requirement of sufficiently strong first order ewpt predicts the higgs boson mass to be too small to satisfy the constraint from the lep direct search results  @xcite .",
    "therefore , in order to realize the baryon asymmetry of the universe we need to consider an extension of the sm .",
    "one of the viable models for successful electroweak baryogenesis would be the two higgs doublet model ( thdm )  @xcite .",
    "the extension of the higgs sector can introduce additional cp violating phases , and the quantum effect of extra scalar bosons in the higgs potential makes it possible to realize sufficiently strong first order ewpt without contradicting the lep data for the mass of the higgs boson . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the connection between the first order ewpt and the triple coupling for the lightest sm - like higgs boson @xmath0 ( the @xmath1 coupling ) has been clarified . in the model with sufficiently strong first order ewpt ,",
    "the @xmath1 coupling constant significantly deviates from the sm prediction due to the same nondecoupling quantum effects of additional scalar bosons which make the first order ewpt strong .",
    "such nondecoupling effects on the @xmath1 coupling constant have been studied in ref .",
    "the scenario of electroweak baryogenesis by nondecoupling loop effects of extra bosons has also been applied in a tev scale model where tiny neutrino masses , dark matter and the baryon asymmetry of the universe may be simultaneously explained  @xcite .",
    "it would also be attractive to consider the scenario of electroweak baryogenesis in the model based on supersymmetry ( susy ) .",
    "susy is a good candidate of new physics , which eliminates the quadratic divergence in the one - loop calculation of the higgs boson mass .",
    "the lightest susy partner particle in susy models with the r parity can naturally be a candidate for the cold dark matter .    in the minimal supersymmetric sm ( mssm )",
    ", there are many studies to realize the electroweak baryogenesis  @xcite .",
    "currently , this scenario is highly constrained by the experimental data , especially the lep higgs mass bounds , leading to the tension between the lightest higgs boson mass and the strength of the first order ewpt .",
    "nevertheless , it is still viable for some specific mass spectrum . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , the strong first order ewpt is possible if @xmath5  gev and @xmath6  gev , where @xmath0 is the lightest higgs boson and @xmath7 is the lightest stop . to satisfy the lep bound on @xmath8 , the soft susy breaking mass for the left - handed stop should be greater than 6.5  tev .",
    "the most striking feature of this scenario is that the electroweak vacuum is metastable and the global minimum is a charge - color - breaking vacuum , where the lifetime of the electroweak vacuum is found to be longer than the age of the universe",
    ".    the aforementioned tension in the mssm baryogenesis can be relaxed by extending the higgs sector .",
    "one of the possibilities is to add a gauge singlet field into the mssm .",
    "so far , many studies on the electroweak baryogenesis have been done in such singlet - extended mssms ; i.e. , the next - to - mssm  @xcite , the nearly mssm or the minimal non - mssm  @xcite , the @xmath9-extended mssm  @xcite , the secluded @xmath9-extended mssm  @xcite , and so on . in this class of the models",
    ", the strong first order ewpt can be induced by the trilinear mixing term of the doublet and the singlet fields appearing in the tree - level higgs potential .",
    "if this is the case , the mass constraints on the lightest higgs boson and the light stop would be alleviated significantly . in the singlet - extended mssm ,",
    "however , the vacuum structure is inevitably more complicated than the mssm , giving rise to the unrealistic vacua in the large portion of the parameter space , especially electroweak baryogenesis - motivated scenario  @xcite .    in this letter",
    ", we consider how the electroweak phase transition can be of sufficiently first order due to the nondecoupling effect of additional scalar bosons in another extended susy standard model , where a pair of extra doublet chiral superfields @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) and @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) and a pair of charged singlet chiral superfields @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) and @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) are introduced in addition to the mssm content  @xcite .",
    "since the singlet fields are charged rather than neutral , they do not have the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) as long as the @xmath18 is preserved .",
    "therefore , at least at the tree level , there is no vacuum instability caused by the singlet field as opposed to the neutral singlet - extended mssm as mentioned above . on top of this",
    ", this model may be motivated by susy extensions of the models with additional charged singlet fields in which neutrino masses are generated by radiative corrections  @xcite . in the present model , apart from the model in which an additional neutral singlet chiral superfield is added to the mssm , there is no tree - level f - term contribution to the mass of the lightest higgs boson , but there can be large one - loop corrections to the triple higgs boson coupling due to the additional bosonic loop contribution  @xcite .",
    "we note that in the susy higgs sector with four doublet chiral superfields  @xcite , all the quartic interactions in the higgs potential come from the d - term so that there are no large nondecoupling quantum effects on the @xmath1 coupling  @xcite . similarly to the case of the non - susy thdm , these nondecoupling bosonic loop contributions can also make first order phase transition stronger .",

    "<S> we investigate the one - loop effect of new charged scalar bosons on the higgs potential at finite temperatures in the supersymmetric standard model with four higgs doublet chiral superfields as well as a pair of charged singlet chiral superfields . in this model , </S>",
    "<S> the mass of the lightest higgs boson @xmath0 is determined only by the d - term in the higgs potential at the tree - level , while the triple higgs boson coupling for @xmath1 can receive a significant radiative correction due to nondecoupling one - loop contributions of the additional charged scalar bosons . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the same nondecoupling mechanism can also contribute to realize stronger first order electroweak phase transition than that in the minimal supersymmetric standard model , which is definitely required for a successful scenario of electroweak baryogenesis . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , this model can be a new candidate for a model in which the baryon asymmetry of the universe is explained at the electroweak scale . </S>"
