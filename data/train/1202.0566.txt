    "the resonance is broad because of the effect of the contacts in the electron states in the sample .",
    "the strength of the lead - sample coupling @xmath133 is of the order 0.02 in our calculations . at larger frequencies ( larger than 0.18 )",

    "we find the higher modes attenuated and apparently a longer wavelength .",
    "however , a systematic investigation of the dispersion of the standing waves is not possible at this stage .",
    "we have simulated the time dependent transport through a one - dimensional interacting finite quantum wire attached to two leads , described by a lattice model .",
    "out - of - phase time periodic signals are applied at the contact sites generating a turnstile operation .",
    "the calculations are performed by solving the generalized master equation of the reduced density operator in the fock space of the many - body states of the electrons in the sample , which are calculated via exact diagonalization . the time periodic contacts generate standing waves of charge along the length of the wire with finer details depending on the location of the contacts .",
    "the amplitude of the currents depends on the contact site not only through the tunneling constants but also through the amplitude of the charge fluctuations at the given contact .",
    "the current profile in the leads is determined by the charge fluctuations in the sample , which depend on the entire standing wave pattern .",
    "we have called this model a quantum flute .",
    "we emphasize that the excitation of these collective oscillations are obtained from a fully quantum treatment of an open few - electron system .",
    "collective oscillations have been studied in quantum dots with few electrons by mapping out the oscillator strength of exact mess @xcite or a by more traditional linear response approach @xcite .",
    "the evolution to systems with a higher number of electrons has also been studied @xcite . in the present work",
    "the excitation method is of a different type and it may be used in transport measurements .",
    "the charge oscillations occur both due to the finite length of the sample and due to the coulomb interaction .",
    "both the boundaries of the sample and the coulomb repulsion create the restoring ( `` elastic '' ) forces .",
    "the coulomb interaction has also an important role in the charge distribution , through the well known blocking and correlation effects , and therefore the inclusion of the coulomb effects is necessary for a consistent description .",
    "the relative strength of the coulomb interaction @xmath142 may however depends on the material constants .",
    "it is quite difficult to compare the results without and with the coulomb interaction included for the same set of parameters ( i.  e.  bias window , coupling constants ) .",
    "if coulomb effects are neglected ( @xmath143 ) the whole energy spectrum changes and new states are present within the bias window .",
    "then the chemical potentials in the leads have to be shifted accordingly in order to capture in the bias window states with similar number of electrons as in the interacting case .",
    "this means one can not compare the two situations just by changing only one parameter .",
    "our calculations are performed for a relatively weak coupling of the sample to leads . in this case",
    "the perturbation of the sample states due to the leads is minimal , and so the results can still be interpreted in terms of the states of the sample itself .",
    "increasing the coupling strength the finer details of the current profile determined by the sample may be washed out .",
    "the standing waves are obviously not possible in quantum dots where , to our knowledge , most of the experimental and theoretical work on turnstile pumping has been done .",
    "therefore the spatial extension of the sample is , in our opinion , a novel element in this topic .",
    "the short time scale of the oscillations , in the picosecond domain , is related to the energy gaps between the quantum states .",
    "this domain is attainable by the present experimental technology .    in this work we completely ignored the coulomb interaction in the leads . due to computational limitations we studied a short nanowire which generated a short time scale . and also a relatively narrow bias window , which together with the weak sample - leads coupling yielded low currents . but even though the currents calculated in these examples are small and we are limited here only to the qualitative effects , the predicted results may be seen in future experiments .",
    "for example in a setup with an array of finger electrodes placed on top of a single wire where currents can be driven by any pair of contacts @xcite .",
    "another possibility is to change the location of one contact , like in our simulations , using a scanning tunneling or a conductive atomic force microscope @xcite .",
    "consequently one can expect that a suitable placement of the source and drain leads along the sample would be a way to deliver modulated output currents with a desired shape and period . the time dependent charge propagation along transmission lines of a quantum mechanical nature may be a future direction in the field of nanophysics .",
