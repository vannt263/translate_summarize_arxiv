    "the collective dynamics and the dissipative properties of the nuclear fermi liquid depend in many aspects on the dynamical distortion of the fermi surface in momentum space . as is well - known , taking into account this distortion allows the description of a new class of phenomena , the most famous of which are the giant multipole resonances .",

    "thus , inclusion of memory effects in the collision integral @xmath116 in eq .",
    "( [ 2.5 ] ) implies a consistent change of both dissipative and conservative forces in the equations of motion ( [ 2.16 ] ) and ( [ 2.28 ] )",
    ".    a more detailed analysis of this question will be the subject of further investigation . here , we only want to mention that we adopt phenomenological values for the parameters in our approach .",

    "it is important to account for these memory effects in order to obtain a correct description of the transition in fermi - liquid from the zero - sound regime at low temperature to the first - sound regime at high temperatures .",
