    "the study of opinion dynamics has recently started to attract the attention of the control community .",
    "this interest is in large part motivated with the bulk of knowledge which has been developed about methods to approximate and stabilize consensus , synchronization , and other coherent states .",
    "however , in contrast with many engineering systems , social systems do not typically exhibit a consensus of opinions , but rather a persistence of disagreement , possibly with the formation of opinion parties .",
    "it is then essential to understand which features of social systems prevent the formation of consensus . to the authors understanding",
    ", scholars have focused on two key reasons : opinion - dependent limitations in the network connectivity and obstinacy of the agents .",
    "the first line of research has seen a growth of models involving `` bounded confidence '' between the agents : if the opinions of two agents are too far apart , they do not influence each other .",
    "these models typically result into a clusterization of opinions : the agents split into non - communicating groups , and each group reaches an internal consensus .",
    "influential models have been defined in  @xcite , and their understanding has been recently deepened by the control community , which has studied evolutions both in discrete time @xcite and in continuous time  @xcite , possibly including heterogenous agents  @xcite and randomized updates  @xcite .    although interesting and motivated , these `` bounded confidence '' models do not seem to be sufficient to explain the persistence of disagreement in real societies , in spite of persistent contacts and interactions between agents . instead , a persistent disagreement is more likely a consequence of the agents being unable , or unwilling , to change their opinions , no matter what the other agents opinions are .",
    "this observation has been made by social scientists , as in the models introduced in  @xcite , and more recently by physicists  @xcite . since this idea has spread to applied mathematics and systems theory , several models",
    "have already been studied in detail , using techniques from stochastic processes  @xcite and from game theory  @xcite .    following the latter line of research , in this paper",
    "we define a _ gossip dynamics _ such that at each time step a randomly chosen agent updates its opinion to a convex combination of its own opinion , the opinion of one of its neighbors , and its own initial opinion or `` prejudice '' .",
    "we show that , although the resulting dynamics persistently oscillates , its average is a stable opinion profile , which is not a consensus .",
    "this means that the expected beliefs of an agent will not in general achieve , even asymptotically , an agreement with the other agents in the society .",
    "furthermore , we show that the oscillations of opinions are ergodic in nature , so that the averages along sample paths are equivalent to the ensemble averages .",
    "our work has been deeply influenced from reading the papers  @xcite and  @xcite , which also include agents with prejudices .",
    "compared to the former paper , our contribution is a new model of communication between agents and , thus , of opinion evolution : a more precise discussion is given below in section  [ sect : relation - gossip - friedkin ] .",
    "compared to the latter paper , which also proves an ergodic theorem , we allow the agents to have a continuum of degrees of obstinacy , rather than a dichotomy stubborn / non - stubborn .",
    "the qualitative picture , however , shows strong similarities .",
    "finally , we point out that we have recently performed a similar analysis of ergodicity for a randomized algorithm , which solves the so - called localization problem for a network of sensors  @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we are confident that these techniques may foster the understanding of other randomized algorithms and dynamics  @xcite , including for instance distributed pagerank computation  @xcite .",
    "sections  [ sect : friedkin - dynamics ] and  [ sect : gossip - dynamics ] are devoted to present the two models of opinion dynamics which we are interested in : the classical friedkin and johnsen s model and our new gossip algorithm , respectively . for both dynamics",
    ", we state a convergence result .",
    "section  [ sect : analysis ] is then devoted to provide a proof of these statements .",
    "a few comments are given in the concluding section .",
    "real and nonnegative integer numbers are denoted by @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "we use @xmath2 to denote the cardinality of set @xmath3 , and @xmath4 to denote the euclidean norm .",
    "provided @xmath5 is a directed graph with node set @xmath6 and edge set @xmath7 , we define for each node @xmath8 the set of neighbors @xmath9 and the degree @xmath10 .",
    "we assume that @xmath11 for all @xmath12 , so that @xmath13 for every @xmath8 .",
    "such an edge is said to be a self - loop .",
    "we refer the reader to  @xcite for a broader introduction to graph theory and for related definitions .",
    "we consider two models of opinion dynamics : one is the well - known friedkin and johnsen s model , which we describe below , while the other is a related randomized model which we describe in the next section .",
    "we consider a set of agents @xmath6 , whose potential interactions are encoded by a directed graph @xmath5 , which we refer to as the _ social network_. each agent @xmath8 is endowed with a state @xmath14 , which evolves in discrete time , and represents its _ belief or opinion_. we denote the vector of beliefs as @xmath15 .",
    "an edge @xmath16 means that agent @xmath17 may directly influence the belief of agent @xmath18 . to avoid trivialities , we assume that @xmath19 .      here",
    "we recall friedkin and johnsen s model and we give a convergence result based on the topology of the underlying social network .",
    "let @xmath20 be a nonnegative matrix which defines the strength of the interactions ( @xmath21 if @xmath22 ) and @xmath23 be a diagonal matrix describing how sensitive each agent is to the opinions of the others , based on interpersonal influeneces .",
    "we assume that @xmath24 is row - stochastic , i.e. , @xmath25 , where @xmath26 denotes the vector of ones , and we set @xmath27 , where @xmath28 collects the self - weights given by the agents .",
    "the dynamics of opinions @xmath29 proposed in @xcite is @xmath30 with @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the vector @xmath33 , which corresponds to the individuals preconceived opinions , also appears as an input at every time step .",
    "the presence of this input is the main feature of this model , and marks its difference with , for instance , the mentioned models which are based on bounded confidence . as a consequence of  , the opinion profile at time",
    "@xmath34 is equal to @xmath35 the limit behavior of the opinions is described in the following result .",
    "[ prop : convergence - friedkin ] assume that from any node @xmath36 there exists a path from @xmath37 to a node @xmath38 such that @xmath39 .",
    "then , the opinions converge and @xmath40    due to the assumption , @xmath23 is a substochastic matrix , that is , a matrix with positive entries which sum to less than or equal to one along each row",
    ". then , @xmath41 is substochastic also , and schur stable by lemma  [ lemma : substoch_stab ] ( proved in section  [ sect : analysis ] ) .",
    "thus , the dynamics in ( 1 ) with the constant input term @xmath42 is convergent to @xmath43 .",
    "the assumption of the proposition implies that each agent is influenced by at least one stubborn agent . as shown in the proof ,",
    "this is sufficient to guarantee the stability of the opinion dynamics . in practice",
    ", we expect that in a social network most agents will have some level of obstinacy , thus a positive @xmath44 .",
    "let @xmath45 , which is referred to as the total effects matrix in  @xcite .",
    "since @xmath24 is stochastic , we observe that under the assumption of proposition  [ prop : convergence - friedkin ] also @xmath46 is stochastic : this means that the limit opinion of each agent is a convex combination of the preconceived opinions of the group .",
    "however , we note that @xmath43 is not a `` consensus '' , but a more general opinion profile such that @xmath47 .",
    "note that instead a consensus is reached if @xmath24 has zero diagonal ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath48 ) and the graph is aperiodic and has a globally reachable node ; see for instance  @xcite .      here",
    ", we briefly describe an example from  @xcite to illustrate how the opinion dynamics arise in the context of social networks .",
    "we consider a group of @xmath49 agents and study how opinions are formed through interactions .",
    "the model is an abstraction of experiments conducted and reported in the reference .",
    "the general flow of the experiments is as follows :    1 .",
    "the agents are presented with an issue ( related to sports , surgery , school , etc . )",
    "on which opinions can range , say , from 1 to 100 .",
    "each agent forms an initial opinion on the issue .",
    "3 .   the agents can communicate over phone with other agents ( predetermined by the experiment organizer ) individually to discuss the issue .",
    "4 .   after several rounds of discussion",
    ", they settle on final opinions that may or may not be in agreement .",
    "they are also asked to provide estimates of the relative interpersonal influences of other group members on their final opinions .    as a simple example",
    ", we describe a case with four agents .",
    "let the initial and final opinion vectors be @xmath50^{\\top},\\\\    x ' & =   [ 60~ 60~ 75~ 75]^{\\top}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the matrix @xmath24 which determines the influence network for this group is given by slightly differs from that on page six of  @xcite because the rows of the latter do not sum exactly to one , due to rounding errors . ]",
    "@xmath51 where the entries represent the distribution of relative interpersonal influences on the issue .",
    "note that agent 3 in this example is `` totally stubborn '' , meaning that it does not change its opinion at all during the evolution .",
    "this matrix is obtained from the experiment data @xmath52 , @xmath43 , and the estimate of the relative interpersonal influences .",
    "we take @xmath53 ; the entries represent the agents susceptibilities to interpersonal influence .",
    "the off - diagonal entries of @xmath24 are the weights of the influence by the others .",
    "for example , @xmath54 shows that the direct relative influence of agent  2 on agent  1 is .120 .",
    "the matrix @xmath46 is @xmath55 this matrix indicates the influence of each agent on every other agent in the final opinions through the flow of direct and indirect interactions .",
    "for example , @xmath56 shows that almost 55% of the final opinion of agent  2 is determined by agent  3 .",
    "the evolution of the opinions is illustrated by the simulations in figure  [ fig : fjmodel ] , which respectively plot the state @xmath29 and the corresponding limit point @xmath43 ( marked by blue circles ) .    .",
    "the opinions @xmath57 converge to the limit @xmath43 ( marked by blue circles ) . ]",
    "we propose here a class of randomized opinion dynamics , which translates the idea of friedkin and johnsen s model into a `` gossip '' communication model .",
    "the agents beliefs evolve according to the following stochastic update process .",
    "each agent @xmath8 starts with an initial belief @xmath58 . at each time",
    "@xmath59 a directed link is randomly sampled from a uniform distribution over @xmath7 .",
    "if the edge @xmath60 is selected at time @xmath61 , agent @xmath18 meets agent @xmath17 and updates its belief to a convex combination of its previous belief , the belief of @xmath17 , and its initial belief .",

    "[ assmp : coefficients]let the diagonal matrix @xmath65 be defined by @xmath66 and the matrix @xmath67 defined by @xmath68 .",

    ", we observe that at all times the opinions of the agents are convex combinations of their initial prejudices .",
    "note that if an edge of the form @xmath73 is sampled at time @xmath61 , then @xmath74 that is , the opinion of agent @xmath18 moves back closer to its preconceived opinion .",
    "also note that if @xmath75 , then agent @xmath18 is totally stubborn , whereas if @xmath76 , then agent @xmath18 is totally open - minded : we may say that @xmath77 is proportional to the obstinacy of the agent .",
    "our analysis -detailed in the next section- requires to study first the average dynamics of the gossip model .",
    "[ lemma : expected - dynamics ] under assumption  [ assmp : coefficients ] , the dynamics   is such that @xmath78 = & \\big(i-\\frac{1}{{|{\\mathcal{e}}|}}\\big(d(i - h ) + h(i-\\gamma)\\big ) \\big){\\mathds{e}}[x(k ) ]   + \\frac{1}{|{\\mathcal{e}}|}d(i - h)u,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath79 is the degree matrix of @xmath80 , a diagonal matrix whose diagonal entry is equal to the degree @xmath10 .",
    "based on this preliminary result , we make the following statement about the convergence properties of the gossip opinion dynamics . in order to prove it",

    "indeed , if instead @xmath85 and @xmath80 has a globally reachable node , then the dynamics reduces to a standard asymmetric gossip consensus algorithm , studied for instance in  @xcite .",
    "we also notice that our results assume the edges to be chosen for the update according to a uniform distribution .",
    "this choice is made for simplicity , but our analysis can easily be extended to consider more general or different distributions .    in our result , we prove ergodicity in the sense that the time - averages ( also known as cesro averages or polyak averages in some contexts ) converge to the limit of the expected dynamics in mean square sense . we could also have given the corresponding statement of almost - sure convergence : its proof would closely follow the arguments in  @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we prefer to focus on mean square convergence because we are able to give a detailed proof by a direct argument .",

    "<S> such agents are often called  stubborn \" . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the opinions of the agents fail to converge , but persistently undergo ergodic oscillations , which asymptotically concentrate around a mean distribution of opinions . </S>",
