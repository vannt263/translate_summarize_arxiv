    "ever since the advent of high energy colliders , the study of multi - particle final states in hadronic collisions has offered the possibility of probing the structure of qcd at a deep level .",
    "much attention has been focused on the nature of multi - particle production in jets  for a nice review , see ref .",
    "the problem is however very general .",
    "theoretical developments in the last couple of decades suggest that the bulk of multi - particle production at the highest collider energies may be controlled by semi - hard scales .",
    "this suggests the possibility that weak coupling computations of final states can be compared to experiments .",
    "first steps in applying this program to understanding high energy nuclear collisions at the relativistic heavy collider ( rhic ) are very promising @xcite .",
    "we expect these considerations to be even more relevant for next generation experiments at rhic and at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "motivated by these considerations , in a previous paper @xcite , we developed a general formalism to study the properties of particle production in a field theory coupled to a strong external time - dependent source .",
    "we focused there , for simplicity , on the case of a @xmath0 scalar field theory .",
    "we believe however that most of our results are of general validity and can be extended to a gauge theory like qcd .",
    "the relevance of such a field theory coupled to strong sources to the description of multi - particle final states in high energy hadronic interactions comes from the possibility of separating , in a high energy hadron wave - function , partons with a large longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath1 from low @xmath1 partons .",
    "this is because large @xmath1 partons are time - dilated and evolve very little over the interaction time with the other hadron .",
    "they are therefore  frozen \" color sources for partons at smaller @xmath1 .",
    "the latter , in contrast , are dynamical fields over the time scales of the interaction process .",
    "the balitsky - fadin - kuraev - lipatov ( bfkl ) evolution equation @xcite predicts that parton densities grow very rapidly with decreasing @xmath1 .",
    "because this rapid growth leads to large phase - space densities of partons in the hadron wave - function , the dynamics of the field that describes the small @xmath1 partons is to a good approximation classical .",
    "this separation of the degrees of freedom of a high energy hadron into static sources and dynamical fields that behave almost classically is the essence of the mclerran - venugopalan model @xcite .",
    "the corresponding effective theory is the theory we mimicked in @xcite .    in a high energy hadron , the effective theory that results from this separation of the degrees of freedom",
    "is completely specified by the knowledge of the distribution of hard sources . because physical results should not depend on the arbitrary scale which is used to separate the degrees of freedom ,",
    "the distribution of sources must obey a renormalization group equation , known as the jimwlk equation @xcite . in the limit of a large number of colors and of a large nucleus",
    ", it takes a much simpler form , the balitsky - kovchegov equation @xcite .",
    "this framework is referred to as the color glass condensate ( cgc ) @xcite .    in this framework , to compute an observable in a high energy hadronic collision , one first finds the appropriate distribution of color sources and subsequently computes the observable of interest for that particular distribution of color sources .",
    "finally , the observable has to be averaged over all possible configurations of distributed sources .",
    "the former involves solving the evolution equation for the distribution of sources . as in @xcite we will assume here that the distribution of sources is known and focus on the second part of the calculation .",
    "we will also assume that factorization holds and that any back reaction from the produced fields on the sources can be neglected .",
    "finally , we will assume that the sources ( because of the rapid growth of parton densities with decreasing @xmath1 ) are strong sources .",
    "this growth is tamed only when the self - interactions of the partons become important , a regime which is called `` saturation '' @xcite . in this saturation regime , which is natural for a non - abelian gauge theory at sufficiently high energies , the color sources are of the order of the inverse of the coupling constant .",
    "they are therefore strong sources in a weakly coupled theory .",
    "a crucial feature of the strong source saturation regime is that the calculation of any observable in the background provided by such sources is non perturbative in the specific sense that one needs to sum an infinite set of feynman diagrams , even at leading order .",
    "one therefore needs to develop techniques in order to sum the relevant diagrams . in @xcite",
    ", we showed how the calculation of the average number of produced particles can be remapped , at leading order in the coupling constant , into the problem of solving the classical equation of motion ( eom ) for the field with retarded boundary conditions .",
    "we also showed that the average multiplicity could be computed at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) by solving in addition the equation of motion for a small fluctuation of the field on top of the classical solution .",
    "again , remarkably , this is an initial value problem with purely retarded boundary conditions .",
    "the retarded solutions of these two equations of motion also allows one in principle to obtain higher moments of the distribution of multiplicities .",
    "one such quantity is the variance of the distribution of particles .",
    "this framework was already employed previously to compute gluon production at leading order @xcite and in the calculation of quark production @xcite .",
    "the latter computation , leading order in quark production , is similar to gluon pair production , which contributes to the gluon multiplicity at nlo .",
    "a recent numerical study of plasma instabilities in heavy ion collisions @xcite is very similar in spirit to the computation of the small fluctuation fields necessary to determine nlo contributions to the average multiplicity .",
    "one should emphasize a crucial aspect of these results : the equations of motion are solved with retarded boundary conditions .",
    "_ this allows one to develop straightforward numerical algorithms for finding these solutions even at next - to - leading order_.    in @xcite , we introduced a generating function for the distributions of multiplicities .",
    "we only used it there as an intermediate device for finding expressions for the moments of the distribution of multiplicities .",
    "in fact , determining it would allow one to obtain the distribution of probabilities for @xmath2-particle final states rather than the average multiplicity alone .",
    "we shall discuss here the problem of computing the generating function for particle production . expressing the generating function as a sum of vacuum - vacuum diagrams in the schwinger - keldysh formalism @xcite",
    ", we show that the derivative of the generating function is given by a sum of diagrams that are very similar to those involved in the calculation of the average multiplicity .",
    "further closely examining the set of relevant diagrams at leading order , we show that their sum can be expressed in terms of two solutions of the classical equation of motion .",
    "however , unlike the average multiplicity , the boundary conditions obeyed by these solutions are not retarded and instead , one has boundary conditions both at the initial and at the final time .",
    "this makes the numerical solution of this problem much more difficult .",
    "we will discuss briefly one possible strategy for its numerical solution .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [",
    "sec : reminder ] , we remind the reader of results derived in @xcite that are important later in our discussion . in section [ sec : all - orders ] , we define the generating function and establish a formula for its derivative . this formula is valid to all orders in the coupling constant . in section [ sec :",
    "lo ] , we restrict ourselves to leading order ; at this order , the derivative of the generating function can be expressed in terms of solutions of the classical equation of motion .",
    "we derive the boundary conditions for these solutions .",
    "these are shown to be very simple constraints on the fields at times @xmath3 .",
    "we briefly discuss a possible strategy to compute these solutions numerically . in section [ sec : variance ] , we use the previous results in order to derive an explicit formula for the variance of the number of produced particles , in terms of solutions of the equation of motion for small field fluctuations on top of the classical field . finally , in section [ sec :",
    "e - gf ] , we construct a generating function for the distribution of produced energy as opposed to the number of particles .",
    "such a generating function is likely more relevant to gauge theories that have infrared problems .",
    "we show that it can be obtained at leading order ( in a very similar fashion to the generating function for the number ) from solutions of the classical eom .",
    "in this section , we shall provide a brief synopsis of the results in @xcite on computing moments of the multiplicity distribution in a field theory with time dependent external sources .",
    "the lagrangian density in our toy model is @xmath4 we assume the source @xmath5 to be time - dependent and of strength @xmath6 . by that we mean that the dimensionless number @xmath7 when we do the power counting for a diagram  .",
    "else , the theory has no minimum about which a stable weak coupling expansion can be performed . ] .",
    "when the current @xmath5 coupled to the fields is time - dependent , non - zero transition amplitudes between the vacuum and populated states are allowed .",
    "the probability @xmath8 for the production of @xmath2 particles is @xmath9 it is well known that the transition amplitude @xmath10 is the sum of all the feynman diagrams with only sources in the initial state and @xmath2 particles in the final state .",
    "note that these feynman diagrams are built from * time - ordered * propagators . in a field theory coupled to a time - dependent source , one should also include the disconnected vacuum - vacuum diagrams in computing the probabilities .",
    "( this is in sharp contrast to conventional field theories without external sources where such diagrams can indeed be ignored because they add up to a pure phase in the amplitude and unity in the probabilities . )",
    "the necessity of keeping track of the vacuum - vacuum diagrams is what makes the direct calculation of any of the probabilities @xmath8 difficult . in order to illustrate the difficulty of the task , we display in figure [ fig : p11 ] a typical contribution to @xmath11 , the probability of producing 11 particles in the final state .",
    "the number of disconnected vacuum - vacuum graphs is arbitrary , although their sum is the exponential of all the connected ones : @xmath12\\ ; .\\ ] ] in a field theory in the vacuum , @xmath13 is a real number , and @xmath14 and the similar factor from the complex conjugate amplitude cancel each other .",
    "however , this is not the case in the presence of a time - dependent source @xmath5 .",
    "one should also note that it not possible to perform a perturbative expansion of the probability @xmath8 when the strength of the source is @xmath6 .",
    "indeed , the leading order contribution in this approach corresponds to keeping only the * tree * disconnected factors , but because each of these factors is of order @xmath15 , any truncation is meaningless .      in @xcite",

    "moreover , because the boundary conditions for this equation are retarded , the problem is straightforward to solve numerically .",
    "further , we also showed in @xcite that , at next - to - leading order , the calculation of @xmath30 only requires one to solve the equation of motion for small fluctuations of the field on top of the classical solution again , with retarded boundary conditions .",
