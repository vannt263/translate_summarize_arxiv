    "since abrikosov s @xcite prediction of the flux - line lattice in type - ii superconductors from ginzburg - landau ( gl ) theory @xcite , several approximate formulas for the magnetization @xmath6versus the applied magnetic field @xmath7 or average induction @xmath8 have been published @xcite . in these papers and below , the basic situation is considered where a macroscopically large , homogeneous and isotropic , long superconductor is exposed to a uniform parallel field @xmath7 . in this ideal case demagnetization effects , flux - line pinning , and surface effects may be disregarded , and thus the flux - lines are straight lines forming an ideal periodic lattice .",
    "these results are easily extended to anisotropic superconductors ( where an anisotropic effective - mass tensor is introduced into the gl theory ) by defining an effective gl parameter @xmath9 that depends on the orientation of the flux lines ; this transformation works when @xmath7 is along a principle symmetry axis @xcite .",
    "generalization to geometries where demagnetization effects occur , are possible by introduction of a demagnetizing factor ; but this concept works only for homogeneous specimens with the shape of an ellipsoid . in this case",
    "the flux lines in the bulk are still straight and form an ideal flux - line lattice ( fll ) . for other specimen shapes the fll is distorted , i.e. , the orientation and density of the fll varies spatially and can be calculated only numerically @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to compare the widely used approximate expressions for @xmath5 with the exact value obtained numerically and to give useful general analytic interpolation formulas valid in the entire ranges of @xmath7 and @xmath10 where the fll exists , namely , @xmath1 for @xmath7 , or @xmath11 , and @xmath12 for @xmath10 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the lower and upper critical fields and @xmath10 is the gl parameter .",
    "interestingly , such general formulas have not been published yet , and thus the accuracy of the commonly used expressions is not known , probably due to the difficulty of the numerical solution of the complex - valued gl equations .",
    "early numerics @xcite used the circular cell method ( ccm ) , which approximates the hexagonal unit cell of the triangular fll ( or the quadratic unit cell of the square fll ) by a circle and the two - dimensional ( 2d ) solution by the 1d rotationally symmetric solution inside this circular cell ; both the gl function and the magnetic field are forced to have vanishing slope on this circular boundary , as the exact solution has on the boundary of the wigner - seitz cell .",
    "this method yields the exact @xmath15 and is expected to be best at low inductions @xmath16 where the flux lines are well separated .",
    "but surprisingly , the circular cell approximation gives very good magnetization curves at all @xmath8 ( see fig .  1 ) and even yields the exact value of the upper critical field @xmath17",
    ". some more exact results of the ccm are listed below .",
    "another method @xcite uses a similar circular symmetric gl order parameter and a linear superposition of circular symmetric magnetic fields to obtain excellent approximate @xmath5 , see also ref .  .",
    "an in principle exact numerical method @xcite uses periodic real trial functions for the squared gl function @xmath18 and magnetic field @xmath4 and minimizes the resulting free energy functional with respect to a finite number of fourier coefficients .",
    "the same method was later applied @xcite to solve the microscopic bcs - gorkov theory for the properties of the fll in the entire temperature interval @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the superconducting transition temperature ( gl theory , strictly spoken , applies only close to @xmath20 ) . recently",
    "this variational method was improved @xcite by keeping the same periodic trial functions but now solving the gl equations iteratively ; this iteration works much faster and allows to use many more fourier coefficients ( many thousands instead of only five in ref .  ) .",
    "i shall use this 2d iterative precision method of ref .   for the calculation of the fll at @xmath21 . at low inductions @xmath16",
    "this 2d method is supplemented by an iterative circular cell method presented in appendix a. this 1d method yields accurate values of @xmath22 , which then can be used in interpolation formulas . for convenience ,",
    "i introduce the reduced fields @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , such that one has @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 .",
    "for completeness it should be mentioned that the isolated vortex @xcite and the fll @xcite have also been computed from bcs theory ( valid at all temperatures ) using the quasiclassical eilenberger theory based on energy - integrated green functions .",
    "this method was recently extended to compute the fll structure and local density of states for s - wave @xcite , d - wave @xcite , and chiral p - wave @xcite superconductors .",
    "very recently the gl method @xcite was generalized phenomenologically to lower temperatures and to charged vortices @xcite .",
    "magnetization curves of the triangular fll , which coincide within line thickness with the results for the square fll and for the fll obtained from the circular cell approximation , see fig .  3 for the difference .",

    "the equilibrium magnetic field @xmath7 , and the magnetization @xmath6 , are obtained either from the definition @xmath62 or , more elegantly , from the virial theorem discovered by doria , gubernatis , and rainer , @xcite which in reduced units reads @xmath63    some of the properties of the fll , and all properties of the isolated flux line , may be calculated in an elegant way by the circular cell approximation @xcite as described in app .",

    "i find that the free energy of the triangular fll , @xmath73 , and its magnetization , @xmath74 , are reproduced by the ccm with high accuracy in the entire ranges of @xmath10 and @xmath8 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "in particular , the ccm not only yields @xmath15 ( in the limit @xmath77 ) but it also reproduces the exact upper critical field @xmath78 , and in the special case @xmath79 even the exact result @xmath80 .",
    "these somewhat surprising features of this approximation are related to the facts that @xmath17 , and in the case @xmath81 even the entire curve @xmath82 , are _ independent _ of the detailed arrangement of the flux lines , i.e. , they are the same for triangular and square or honey - comb flls and for any other arrangement of single or multiple quanta flux lines .",
