    "the activity of the study on the synthesis of super - heavy elements is still maintained in both experimentally and theoretically . on the experimental branch ,",
    "s. hofmann et .",
    "al @xcite in gsi , darmstadt , performed experiments on the synthesis and identification of the nuclei @xmath0 and @xmath1 in order to confirm their previous results obtained in the middle of 90s of last century @xcite .",
    "furthermore , several additional decay chains from the reactions @xmath2 and @xmath3 were also measured .",
    "the joint iupac - iupap working party ( iwp ) has confirmed the discovery of element with atomic number 110 , which is named as darmstadtium ( ds ) , recently the new element with atomic number 111 has also been proposed by iwp to be named as roentgenium ( rg ) .",
    "experiments on the synthesis of new elements with atomic numbers 115 as well as 113 in the reaction @xmath4 were carried out at the u400 cyclotron in dubna @xcite , recently they also reported the results of excitation - function measurements for the @xmath5 fusion - evaporation reactions for element 114 and the synthesis of new isotopes of element 116 with the @xmath6 reaction @xcite .    on the theoretical branch ,",
    "the physics on the more complicated dynamical process to super - heavy elements has been paid more attention @xcite and investigated by several groups under different mechanisms , for example , the di - nuclear concept(see the recent works in @xcite and the references therein ) , the fluctuation - dissipation model @xcite , the concept of nucleon collectivization @xcite , as well as the macroscopic dynamical model @xcite .    in the di - nuclear system ( dns )",
    "concept @xcite , the fusion process is considered as the evolution of a di - nuclear system caused by the transfer of nucleons from the light nucleus to the heavy one .",
    "the nucleon transfer process is described in ref.@xcite by solving the master equation numerically .",
    "it is found that the fusion probability of the compound nucleus is very sensitive to the specific form of the driving potential . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the coulomb interaction potential of deformed nuclei with a tip - tip orientation is considered .",
    "however , spherical nuclei were adopted in calculating the nuclear interactions since it is thought that the nuclear interaction does not depend so strongly on the deformation of the nuclei as the coulomb interaction due to the short range characteristics of the nuclear force .",
    "although some reasonable results , such as the optimal excitation energies , the residual cross sections of super - heavy compound nuclei , were obtained for different heavy - ion fusion reactions , the reliability has to be checked .",
    "presently a double - folding method is developed to calculate the nuclear and coulomb interactions between the two deformed nuclei with arbitrary orientations .",
    "here we consider the ground state deformations of the nuclei for all possible combinations of the dns of a certain reaction . in principle",
    ", the deformed nuclei can have different relative orientations which supply quite different conditions for fusion .",
    "some averaging over the orientations of the nuclei has to be carried out at least in the entrance channel .",
    "the deformation and the orientation evolutions are difficult to be described , which have not yet been investigated very well by any model so far . nevertheless , it is important to bear in mind : what are the magnitudes that the deformation of nuclei contributes to the nuclear and coulomb interactions , respectively , and to explore how and to which extent the orientations contribute",
    ". these investigations will give a direction for further improvement .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows . in the next section",
    ", the treatment of the nuclear and coulomb potentials is introduced .",
    "we present the calculated results and the corresponding discussions in section iii , where the interaction potentials between different deformed nuclei and their dependence on orientations as well as the driving potentials used in the dns model for different fragmentations in reactions leading to @xmath7 .",
    "finally , section iv gives a brief conclusion and outlook .",
    "for a dinuclear system , the local excitation energy is defined as follows , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the intrinsic excitation energy of the dinuclear system converted from the relative kinetic energy loss , @xmath10 is the corresponding intrinsic spin due to the dissipation of relative angular momentum @xmath11 . @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the relative and intrinsic moments of inertia respectively .",
    "@xmath14 is the driving potential energy responsible for the nucleon transfer in the dns model , and is written down as ,    @xmath15    where @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 represent the mass numbers of the two nuclei and the corresponding compound nucleus , respectively , we have @xmath19 . in the dns model , the driving potential is normally given as a function of @xmath20 .",
    "the first three parts of the right hand side of the equation are calculated from the liquid - drop model plus the shell and pairing corrections @xcite .",
    "@xmath21 and @xmath22 are the corresponding coulomb and nuclear potential energies between the nuclei and depend on the fragmentation of the dinuclear system , on the internuclear distance @xmath23 and on the orientation and deformation of the nuclei .",
    "they could be calculated by different methods . in the present work ,",
    "we calculate them by using the double - folding method    @xmath24    where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the density distribution of @xmath27 and @xmath28 nucleons in a dinuclear system , @xmath29 is the corresponding interaction between the two points . for the nuclear part @xmath30 we use densities with a smooth falling off at the surface ( see later ) and constant densities for the coulomb interaction .",
    "the long - range coulomb interaction is not sensitive to the density at the surface which allows to simplify the calculations .",
    "therefore , we write the coulomb interaction as follows ,        @xmath31    where @xmath32 is the vector between the two centers of the nuclei ( `` t '' and `` p '' ) as illustrated in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "the charge densities are set as @xmath33 and @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the proton numbers and the volumes of the two nuclei , respectively .",
    "the symmetry axes ( @xmath37 and @xmath38 ) of the two deformed nuclei and the @xmath39-axis are assumed to be in the same plane . @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the corresponding angles between the symmetric axes and @xmath39-axis , _",
    "i.e. _ , which represent the different orientations of the two nuclei , while @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the angles between arbitrary vectors @xmath44 and the symmetric axes @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "the distance between the two points is given by @xmath45    it is easy to find the following relations , @xmath46 @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the angles of @xmath44 with respect to the coordinates ( @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath39 ) and ( @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 ) , respectively .    the upper and lower limits of @xmath55 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 are @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 describe the nuclear surface with quadrupole deformations .",
    "@xmath59 here @xmath60 are the spherical radii of the two nuclei which preserve their fixed volumes .",
    "@xmath61 is spherical harmonics and the axial symmetry is preserved .",
    "the @xmath62 is the quadrupole deformation parameter of @xmath63-nucleus taken from ref.@xcite .",
    "it is easy to write down the expressions for @xmath42 and @xmath43 as @xmath64 and @xmath65    for the nuclear potential , following the work by adamian et al .",
    "@xcite , we adopt the skyrme - type interaction without considering the momentum and spin dependence , in which a zero - range treatment of the effective interaction @xmath66 is assumed .",
    "the nuclear potential is obtained in the sudden approximation @xcite ,    @xmath67    with @xmath68 here @xmath69 and @xmath35 are the neutron and proton numbers of the two nuclei respectively .",
    "obviously the isospin effect of the nucleon - nucleon interaction is considered here though the relative influence is small .",
    "the parameters @xmath70 mev@xmath71@xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77@xmath78 are also used in this work .",
    "the functions @xmath79 and @xmath80 are two - parameter woods - saxon density distributions ( now we set the center of the `` p''-nucleus at the coordinate origin and @xmath81 )    @xmath82    and @xmath83 the parameters @xmath84 and @xmath85 represent the diffuseness of the two nuclei , respectively . whereas @xmath86 is given in eq .",
    "( [ cosa1 ] ) , we use the following formula with @xmath87    @xmath88    we directly calculate the six- and three - dimensional integrals in eqs .",
    "( [ coulpot ] ) and ( [ un ] ) numerically . for eq .",
    "( [ un ] ) , a truncation parameter @xmath89 for the upper limit of @xmath90 is introduced due to the long tails of the nuclear densities expressed in eqs .",
    "( [ rho1 ] ) and ( [ rho2 ] ) . for each mass asymmetry we calculated the sum of the coulomb and nuclear potential energies as a function of the internuclear distance @xmath23 and took the potential at the minimum in @xmath23 which is shorter than @xmath91 ( coulomb - barrier saddle point ) as the driving potential of the dns model .",
    "in this paper , the nuclear and coulomb interaction for the dns of the reaction @xmath92 is studied by taking the nuclear deformations and the corresponding orientations into account . for simplicity ,",
    "the diffuseness parameters @xmath93 and @xmath94 are chosen as @xmath95fm , which is a little bit larger than those in ref .",
    "furthermore , @xmath96fm is used .",
    "the parameter @xmath97fm for the radial integration of the nuclear potential of the deformed nucleus in eq .",
    "( [ un ] ) , is taken for an adequate precision .",
    "fig.[fig2 ] ( a ) and ( b ) show the nuclear interaction potentials of two sets of projectile - target combinations , namely @xmath98 and @xmath99 , to form the same compound nucleus @xmath7 as a function of distance @xmath23 between the centers of the two nuclei .",
    "the corresponding nucleus - nucleus potentials including both the nuclear and coulomb interactions are given in fig.[fig2 ] ( c ) and ( d ) .",
    "in fig.[fig2 ] ( a ) and ( c ) , both nuclei are prolately deformed , @xmath100 with @xmath101 and @xmath102 with @xmath103 , respectively , while in fig.[fig2 ] ( b ) and ( d ) , @xmath104 is prolate and @xmath105 oblate with @xmath106 and @xmath107 , respectively .",
    "the system @xmath99 is more mass - symmetric , _",
    "i.e. _ , it has a smaller @xmath108 than the system @xmath98 , and thus a higher coulomb potential energy . in each panel ,",
    "different orientations for the two systems , _",
    "i.e. _ , tip - tip , tip - belly and belly - belly orientations are investigated , an illustration is shown in ( c ) plot . when both @xmath109 values are positive in ( a ) and ( c ) , the angles @xmath110 , @xmath111 , and @xmath112 are the corresponding ones for the tip - tip , tip - belly , and belly - belly cases , respectively , while for the case of @xmath113 and @xmath114 in cases ( b ) and ( d ) , @xmath115 , @xmath116 , and @xmath117 , respectively .",
    "the two nuclei become more compact with a belly - belly orientation in contrast to the tip - tip one , and the minimum of the potential energy for a belly - belly orientation is at a smaller @xmath23 than that of the tip - tip case .",
    "when the orientation changes from the tip - tip type to the belly - belly one , the minima of the nuclear potentials in ( a ) and ( b ) behave differently as those of the total potentials shown in ( c ) and ( d ) , _ i.e. _ , the minima of the nuclear interaction go down while the minima of the total interaction increase .",
    "the reason for the decrease from tip - belly to belly - belly in ( c ) is that the increase of the coulomb interaction energy is smaller than the decrease of the nuclear interaction energy . defining a distance between the surface of the two nuclei , for example , for the tip - tip case , @xmath118 , while for the belly - belly case , @xmath119 ( @xmath120 represent the long and short axes of the deformed nucleus @xmath63 , respectively ) , we find that @xmath121 changes a little for different orientations .",
    "when @xmath108 decreases from @xmath27 to @xmath122 , the value of @xmath121 increases due to a larger repulsive coulomb force , which can be seen more clearly in fig.[fig5 ] .",
    "therefore , the effect of the mass asymmetry and the orientation of the dns on the driving potential can be analyzed from these results .",
    "are shown as a function of @xmath23 for different orientations of the two nuclei.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    fig.[fig3 ] shows the potentials at the minimum of @xmath123 illustrated in fig.[fig2 ] for the above two combinations as a function of the orientation , the orientation is chosen in a way that keeps @xmath124 for the system @xmath98 and @xmath125 for @xmath99 . on the left hand side",
    ", @xmath40 goes from @xmath126 to @xmath127 and @xmath41 from @xmath127 to @xmath126 , on the right hand side , @xmath40 is chosen from @xmath127 to @xmath128 and @xmath41 from @xmath129 to @xmath130 in order to obtain similar trends of the variation of potentials as a function of the orientation of the two nuclei as on the left hand side , in the two cases , both of the orientation changes from the tip - tip orientation to the belly - belly one and finally back to the tip - tip orientation ( the orientation of the nuclei is shown in the lower - left plot of fig.[fig3 ] ) .",
    "with the changing of the orientations of the two nuclei , the nuclear potentials ( upper panels ) form a valley while the coulomb potentials ( middle panels ) attain a peak value for the tip - tip orientation .",
    "the summation of the two contributions shown in the bottom panels is similar in shape to the coulomb potential but the change with angle is gentler .     for @xmath98 ( left panel ) and @xmath131 for @xmath99 ( right panel ) .",
    "see text for details.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    fig.[fig4 ] displays the driving potentials in eq .",
    "( [ drivpot ] ) for different orientations . in the upper panel of the figure we fixed @xmath40 and @xmath41 to @xmath127 or @xmath129 , while in the lower panel ,",
    "the results for the tip - tip and belly - belly orientations are shown .",
    "the curves in fig.[fig4 ] were calculated by starting with the initial fragmentation @xmath132 ( @xmath133 ) transferring nucleons in steps of one proton or one neutron by searching for the minimum of potential energy .",
    "therefore , the potentials are only approximately symmetric with respect to @xmath134 for the tip - tip and belly - belly cases while for the cases with orientations of @xmath135 and @xmath136 in the upper panel , this symmetry is lost obviously . from fig.[fig4 ] , we find that the driving potential is quite sensitive to the choice of orientations of the two nuclei .",
    "the driving potential for the tip - tip configuration is smaller than that for the belly - belly configuration in the whole range of @xmath137 .",
    "this result is in disagreement with that obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , this discrepancy might be associated to the different consideration of the fusion process of heavy - ions .",
    "to evaluate the difference between the different orientations , we show the differences between the potential energies of the various cases with respect to the tip - tip case in the upper half of fig.[fig5 ] , where @xmath138 is shown with a line , while the other two cases are shown with different scattered symbols .",
    "the differences are peaked in two regions , one in @xmath139 and the other in @xmath140 . in each region there exists a large deformation of the nuclei , especially when @xmath108 is @xmath141 .",
    "however , the detailed deformation of the two nuclei in each part is different , that is , when @xmath140 , the smaller nucleus is almost spherical while the larger counterpart is prolately deformed .",
    "when @xmath139 , prolate and oblate deformations of the two nuclei occur , for example , for @xmath142 , the corresponding configuration is @xmath143 with a couple of large prolate deformation @xmath144 . when @xmath145 , the corresponding @xmath146 consists of a negatively ( @xmath147 ) deformed @xmath148 and a positively ( @xmath149 ) deformed @xmath150 .",
    "the separation distance @xmath121 between the surface of the two nuclei of the dns is shown in the lower graph of fig.[fig5 ] .",
    "because of the relatively large coulomb potential , @xmath121 is stretched when the masses of the two participating nuclei become more equal , which has also been shown in fig.[fig2 ] .     as a function of @xmath137 with tip - tip orientation .",
    ", scaledwidth=90.0% ]     as a function of @xmath137 with tip - tip orientation .",
    ", scaledwidth=90.0% ]    for the di - nuclear system @xmath92 , fig.[fig6 ] shows the comparison between the present driving potential shown by dots and that calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite shown by a fine line for the tip - tip orientation . in the present calculations , the ground state deformation has been taken into account for both the nuclear and coulomb interactions , and in ref .",
    "@xcite a parameterized morse formula @xcite without considering the deformation of the nuclei has been adopted for the nuclear potential .",
    "we find that the two potentials are basically very close each other , however , some obvious deviations appear in the relatively large deformed regions , for example , around @xmath151 and @xmath152 .",
    "it should be pointed out that a deviation also occurs at @xmath153 .",
    "after checking the detailed path of evolution , we find that the configurations of the dns in the two cases are different at this point .",
    "for the case with a nuclear interaction of spherical nuclei , the combination @xmath154 is preferred , while for the one with that of deformed nuclei , a more charge - symmetric combination @xmath155 is taken into account .",
    "obviously , the effect of a large deformation in the deformed region @xmath151 changes the final path of the evolution near @xmath134 .",
    "a double - folding method used to calculate the nucleus - nucleus potential between deformed nuclei is further developed to improve the driving potential of nuclear fusion in the dns model . by taken into account the nuclear deformation in the nuclear interaction together with the coulomb interaction , the formalism for calculating the driving potential of heavy - ion fusion becomes more reasonable .",
    "the deformations and orientations of the interacting nuclei contributing to the nuclear and coulomb interactions are investigated for every fragmentation of the dns considered .",
    "it is natural that the tip - tip orientation has the lowest interaction energy , and may be preferred during the nucleon exchange process .",
    "the minimum energies of the nucleus - nucleus interaction along the distance between the centers of the two nuclei appear at larger distances when mass - asymmetry @xmath108 changes from unit to zero , which is due to the larger coulomb force , and is in favor for the quasi - fission process .",
    "so far a dynamical evolution of the deformation and orientation during the heavy - ion fusion process is not reasonably treated by the present models to our knowledge , our results have estimated the effects of the deformation and orientation of the nuclei , on the driving potential .",
    "hopefully it will give a direction for the further investigation and improvement .",
    "in the next step , we will calculate the fusion probability of various projectile - target combinations with deformed nuclei .",
    "furthermore , when the distance between the surface of the two nuclei is elongated the effect of quasi - fission is expected more pronounced",
    ". we will further consider a two - dimensional potential as functions of the mass asymmetry @xmath137 and the internuclear distance @xmath23 in order to investigate the effect of quasi - fission in the subsequent work .",
