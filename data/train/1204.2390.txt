    "phase transitions are common phenomena in nature and they have long been the subject of intense theoretical interest . since they are driven by thermal and/or quantum fluctuations , an understanding of them at the microscopic level requires a good many - body description .",
    "particular interest in recent years has centered on the so - called quantum phase transitions that occur in systems in their ground state at zero temperature ( @xmath10 ) as some parameters in the hamiltonian describing them are varied .",
    "spin - lattice systems with competing interactions provide a particularly rich field in which to study such quantum phase transitions .",
    "the exchange interactions that lead to collective magnetic behavior in spin systems are clearly quantum - mechanical in origin .",
    "one knows too that the interplay between reduced dimensionality , frustration ( due to either competing interactions or the underlying lattice geometry ) , and strong quantum fluctuations generates a huge variety of new states of condensed matter beyond the usual states of quasiclassical long - range order ( lro ) .",
    "a particularly rich place to observe such exotic ground - state ( gs ) phases is in situations where they originate as a result of quantum fluctuations within a large set of configurations that are degenerate at the classical level.@xcite    the search for such exotic phases that owe their existence purely to quantum effects is nowadays one of the primary reasons for the study of frustrated quantum spin - lattice systems .",
    "the interplay between magnetic frustration and quantum fluctuations provides a powerful mechanism for disturbing , destabilizing , or even completely destroying magnetic order .",
    "the search for a genuine quantum spin - liquid ( qsl ) phase,@xcite which has no magnetic order and no lro or long - range correlations of any kind , has itself attracted huge theoretical interest ever since its first proposal nearly 40 years ago by anderson,@xcite and its subsequent pursuit by , for example , shastry and sutherland@xcite , and many others following them .",
    "the gs wave function of a qsl is clearly a superposition of a large number of different configurations .",
    "an example could be the resonating valence - bond ( rvb ) state , which is a superposition of many short - range singlet valence bonds .",
    "the rvb state was itself first proposed by fazekas and anderson@xcite as the gs wave function for the spin-@xmath0 isotropic heisenberg antiferromagnet ( hafm ) on the geometrically frustrated , two - dimensional , ( 2d ) triangular lattice with only nearest - neighbor ( nn ) interactions , all of equal strength , although it is now known that this proposal is incorrect and that this system is magnetically ordered .    in a genuine qsl state",
    "no symmetry is broken and the quantum fluctuations are required to form a many - body singlet state that contains no long - range correlations with respect to _ any _ operator , although there may be present some form of topological order .",
    "other exotic quantum paramagnetic ( qp ) states , which also have no magnetic lro but which break some spatial symmetry with respect to short - range magnetic correlations , can also arise .",
    "the various qp valence - bond crystalline ( vbc ) solid phases fall into this category .",
    "as we have noted , a combination of strong quantum fluctuations and strong frustration in a spin system provides an ideal scenario for the emergence of such novel quantum gs phases as the qsl and other qp phases discussed above , which do not possess the magnetic lro that typifies the classical gs phases of the corresponding models taken in the limit @xmath11 of the spin quantum number @xmath12 of the lattice spins .",
    "we know that quantum fluctuations tend to be largest for the smallest values of @xmath12 , for lower dimensionality @xmath13 of the lattice , and for the smallest coordination number @xmath14 of the lattice .",
    "thus , for spin-@xmath0 models the honeycomb lattice plays a special role since its coordination number ( @xmath15 ) is the lowest possible for @xmath16 .",
    "frustration is easily incorporated by the inclusion of competing next - nearest - neighbor ( nnn ) and possibly also next - next - nearest - neighbor ( nnnn ) bonds . for these reasons",
    "such spin-@xmath0 frustrated heisenberg models on the honeycomb lattice have engendered huge theoretical interest.@xcite    interest in the honeycomb lattice has been given further impetus by the discovery of a qsl phase in the exactly solvable kitaev model,@xcite in which the spin-@xmath0 particles are sited on a honeycomb lattice .",
    "additional interest has also emanated from the recent synthesis of graphene monolayers@xcite and other magnetic materials with a honeycomb structure .",
    "for example , it is likely that hubbard - like models on the honeycomb lattice may well describe many of the physical properties of graphene . in this context",
    "it is particularly interesting to note the clear evidence of meng _",
    "et al._@xcite that quantum fluctuations are strong enough to trigger an insulating qsl phase between the non - magnetic metallic phase and the antiferromagnetic ( afm ) mott insulator for the hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice at moderate values of the coulomb repulsion @xmath17 .",
    "this latter mott insulator phase corresponds in the limit @xmath18 to the pure hafm on the bipartite honeycomb lattice , whose gs phase exhibits nel lro",
    ". however , higher - order terms in the @xmath19 expansion of the hubbard model ( where @xmath20 is the hubbard hopping term strength parameter ) lead to frustrating exchange couplings in the corresponding spin - lattice limiting model ( and see , e.g. , ref .",
    "[ ] ) , in which the hafm with nn exchange couplings is the leading term in the large-@xmath17 expansion .    the unexpected result of meng _ et al._,@xcite together with other related work,@xcite has excited much interest in understanding the physics of frustrated quantum magnets on the honeycomb lattice . in particular , a growing consensus is emerging@xcite that frustrated spin-@xmath0 hafms on the honeycomb lattice exhibit a frustration - induced qp phase .",
    "it is interesting to note in this context that recent experiments@xcite on the layered compound bi@xmath21mn@xmath22o@xmath23(no@xmath21 ) ( bmno ) at temperatures below its curie - weiss temperature reveal qsl - like behavior . in bmno",
    "the mn@xmath24 ions are situated on the sites of ( weakly - coupled ) honeycomb lattices , although they have spin quantum number @xmath25 .",
    "the successful substitution of the @xmath26 mn@xmath24 ions in bmno by v@xmath24 ions could lead to a corresponding experimental realization of a spin-@xmath0 hafm on the honeycomb lattice .",
    "other realizations of quantum hafms which exhibit the honeycomb structure include magnetic compounds such as inna@xmath27cu@xmath28sbo@xmath29@xcite and incu@xmath30v@xmath31o@xmath27.@xcite in both of these materials the cu@xmath32 ions in the copper oxide layers form a spin-@xmath0 hafm on a ( distorted ) honeycomb lattice .",
    "other similar honeycomb materials include the family of compounds bam@xmath33(xo@xmath22)@xmath33 ( m = co , ni ; x = p , as),@xcite in which the magnetic ions m are disposed in weakly - coupled layers where they are situated on the sites of a honeycomb lattice .",
    "the co ions have spins @xmath34 and the ni ions have spins @xmath35 .",
    "recent calculations@xcite of the material @xmath36-cu@xmath33v@xmath33o@xmath37 have demonstrated that its properties can also be described in terms of a spin-@xmath0 model on an ( anisotropic ) honeycomb lattice .",
    "finally , we note that the very recent prospect of being able to realize spin - lattice models with ultracold atoms trapped in optical lattices@xcite is likely to make even more data available about the quantum phase transitions in the models as the exciting possibility opens up in such trapped - atom experiments to tune the strengths of the competing magnetic bonds , and hence to drive the system from one phase to another .",
    "recently , we have made a series of studies of the frustrated spin-@xmath0 @xmath1@xmath2@xmath3 model on the honeycomb lattice using the coupled cluster method ( ccm ) complemented in some cases with the lanczos exact diagonalization ( ed ) of small lattices .",
    "we have studied various regimes in the full @xmath38 parameter space of nn ( @xmath39 ) bonds , nnn ( @xmath40 ) bonds , and nnnn ( @xmath41 ) bonds .",

    "the spin-@xmath0 @xmath1@xmath2@xmath3 model on the honeycomb lattice , or special cases of it ( e.g. , when @xmath50 or @xmath48 ) have been intensively studied by many authors ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "[ ] and references cited therein ) .",
    "the hamiltonian of the model is @xmath51 where @xmath52 runs over all lattice sites , and where @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 run over all nn sites , all nnn sites , and all nnnn sites to @xmath52 , respectively , counting each bond once and once only .",
    "each site @xmath52 of the lattice carries a spin-@xmath12 particle represented by an su(2 ) spin operator @xmath56 .",
    "we restrict ourselves here to the case @xmath57 .",
    "the lattice and the exchange bonds are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ model ] .    before discussing the @xmath57 version of the model that is the topic of the present paper it is useful to consider first the classical limit ( i.e. , @xmath58 ) .",
    "thus the @xmath1@xmath2@xmath3 model on the honeycomb lattice has six classical gs phases in the case where @xmath42 ( as considered here ) and where @xmath40 and @xmath3 are arbitrary ( i.e. , can take either sign).@xcite the six phases comprise three collinear afm phases , the fm phase , plus two different helical phases ( and see , e.g. , fig . 2 of ref .  ) .",
    "the three afm phases are the nel ( n ) phase , the striped ( s ) phase and the anti - nel ( an ) phase as shown in figs .",
    "[ model](a ) , ( b ) , and ( d ) respectively . the s , an , and n states have , correspondingly , 1 , 2 , and all 3 nn spins to a given spin antiparallel to it .",
    "similarly , if we consider the sites of the honeycomb lattice as comprising a set of parallel sawtooth ( or zigzag ) chains ( in any one of the three equivalent directions ) , the s state consists of alternating up - spin and down - spin fm chains , whereas the an state consists of afm chains in which nn spins on adjacent chains are parallel .",
    "although at @xmath10 there exists an infinite family of non - coplanar states degenerate in energy with respect to each of the s and an states , both thermal and quantum fluctuations @xcite favor the collinear configurations . when @xmath59 the spiral state shown in fig .",
    "[ model](c ) is the stable classical gs phase in some region of the parameter space .",
    "this state is characterized by a pitch vector perpendicular to one of the three equivalent @xmath39 bond directions , and a single spiral angle defined so that as we move along the parallel sawtooth chains [ drawn in the horizontal direction in fig .",
    "[ model](c ) ] the spin angle increases by @xmath60 from one site to the next , and with nn spins on adjacent chains antiparallel .",
    "the classical gs energy for this spiral state is minimized when the pitch angle takes the value @xmath61 $ ] . the corresponding minimum value for the gs energy per spin is then given as @xmath62 when @xmath63 this spiral state simply becomes the collinear n state with a corresponding energy per spin given by @xmath64 clearly",
    ", the phase transition between this spiral state and the n state is of a continuous nature and the corresponding phase boundary is given by the equation @xmath65 , for @xmath66 , where @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "similarly , when @xmath69 this spiral state becomes the collinear s state with a corresponding gs energy per spin given by @xmath70 the classical spiral and s states undergo a continuous phase transition along their common phase boundary @xmath71 , for @xmath72 .",
    "furthermore there is a first - order phase transition between the collinear n and s states along the boundary line @xmath73 , for @xmath74 .",

    "thus in this limiting case the classical model simply becomes two hafms on weakly connected interpenetrating triangular lattices , with the classical triangular - lattice ordering of nn spins oriented at an angle @xmath79 to each other on each sublattice .    when @xmath80 ( and @xmath42 ) the above three states are the only classical gs phases .",

    "another collinear afm state , the an state shown in fig .",

    "this second spiral phase is characterized by a pitch vector that is parallel to one of the @xmath39 bond directions and by two spiral angles @xmath89 and @xmath36 . within a unit cell",
    "the spin directions deviate from those in the n state by an angle @xmath89 , and as one advances from one unit cell to the next there is a twist by an angle @xmath36 .",
    "both of the two pitch angles of this second spiral phase smoothly approach the value zero along the above boundary with the n state , and the value @xmath90 along a second boundary curve that joins the points @xmath91 and @xmath92 , on which it meets the an state .",
    "both transitions are continuous in nature .",
    "this second spiral phase meets the three collinear states n , an , and fm at the tetracritical point @xmath91 .    in this paper",
    "we further our study of the spin-@xmath0 model of eq .",

    "thus , henceforth we set @xmath4 to set the overall energy scale , and we work here within the parameter space window @xmath5 $ ] .",
    "recently we have used the ccm to study the special @xmath1@xmath2 case of this model ( and in this parameter window with @xmath42 and @xmath93 ) in which @xmath48.@xcite we found a paramagnetic plaquette valence - bond crystalline ( pvbc ) phase for @xmath94 , where @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "we found that the transition at @xmath97 to the n phase appeared to be of a continuous deconfined type ( although we could not exclude a very narrow intermediate phase in the range @xmath98 ) , while that at @xmath99 to the an phase appeared to be of first - order type . as we noted above the an phase exists in the classical version of the @xmath1@xmath2 model only at the isolated and",
    "highly degenerate critical point @xmath100 .",
    "the spiral phases that are present classically for all values @xmath101 were found to be absent for all @xmath102 .",

    ", we now extend its study to map out its entire phase diagram in the parameter regime @xmath110 $ ] . in view of the proven success of using the ccm on the above special cases of this model",
    ", we continue to utilize it , and in sec .",
    "[ ccm ] we accordingly first briefly outline the method as it is applied here .",
    "the ccm is a widely used microscopic many - body technique .",
    "it is has been demonstrated to be particularly efficient and very accurate in handling a wide variety of highly frustrated quantum magnets .",
    "such frustrated systems are notoriously challenging at the theoretical level .",
    "only a very limited number of established numerical methods exist for their accurate treatment , and other recent and very promising approaches such as those based on projected entangled pair states@xcite have not yet been sufficiently widely tested to be able to evaluate properly their accuracy and efficacy .    of the other",
    "well established and widely used techniques we note that exact diagonalization ( ed ) techniques , which involve the finite - size extrapolation of numerical exact data for finite - lattice systems , are much more challenging for the present honeycomb - lattice model than for comparable square - lattice models , to which they have been very efficiently and accurately applied ( see , e.g. , refs .  [ ] ) .",
    "the reasons include the facts that for the honeycomb lattice the unit cell now contains two sites , and that there exist relatively fewer finite - sized lattices ( than in the square - lattice case ) that are small enough for ed techniques to be used but which also contain the full point - group symmetry.@xcite also , quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) methods are severely restricted in the presence of frustration by the well - known `` minus - sign problem '' .    by contrast",
    "the ccm , when evaluated to high orders in one of its systematic approximation hierarchies , as described below , has been proven through a huge variety of applications to provide a powerful tool both to determine with good accuracy the positions of quantum critical points , @xcite and to classify the nature of any qp phases in the system.@xcite as noted above , we have also used the ccm very successfully in some previous applications to honeycomb - lattice models,@xcite and for all these reasons we now employ it again here .",
    "the ccm is a size - extensive method , in which the limit @xmath111 , where @xmath112 is the number of lattice spins , may automatically be imposed from the outset .",
    "the many - body system under study is assumed to have exact ket and bra gs energy eigenvectors , @xmath113 and @xmath114 respectively , which satisfy the corresponding schrdinger equations , @xmath115 and which are chosen to have the normalization @xmath116 , i.e. , @xmath117 .",
    "the quantum correlations present in the exact ground state are expressed systematically in the ccm with respect to some suitable normalized model ( or reference ) state , @xmath118.@xcite it is common practice to choose simple quasiclassical states as ccm reference states , although other choices are certainly possible . in this study",
    "we choose various classical model states as our ccm model states , namely : ( a ) the nel , ( b ) the striped , ( c ) the spiral , and ( d ) the anti - nel states shown in fig .  [ model ] , as we discuss below .",
    "the model state @xmath118 is required to be a fiducial vector in the sense that all possible ket states in the many - body hilbert space can be obtained by acting on it with an appropriate linear combination of mutually commuting many - body creation operators , @xmath119 , which may be defined with respect to the model state .",
    "the operators @xmath120 , with @xmath121 , thus have the property that @xmath122 ; @xmath123 .",
    "the ccm parametrizations of the exact ket and bra gs wave functions are given in terms of the usual exponentiated forms , @xmath124 where the ccm correlation operators @xmath125 and @xmath126 are themselves expressed as generalized multiconfigurational creation and destruction operators respectively , @xmath127 clearly these parametrizations satisfy the normalization relations @xmath128 .",
    "the set of correlation coefficients ( @xmath129 , @xmath130 ) is now determined by requiring the energy expectation value @xmath131 to be a minimum with respect to each of the correlation coefficients themselves .",
    "this will result in the coupled sets of equations @xmath132 and @xmath133 ; @xmath123 , which we normally solve for the correlation coefficients ( @xmath129 , @xmath130 ) using parallel computing routines once the specific truncation scheme is specified , as described further below .    in order to treat each lattice site in the spin system on an equal basis",
    "it is extremely convenient to rotate the local spin - axes on each site in such a way that all the spins of each ccm reference state used point along the negative @xmath14-direction .",
    "such rotations in spin space are obviously canonical transformations that have no effect on the fundamental su(2 ) commutation relations .",
    "the spins of our system are then represented entirely by these locally defined spin coordinate frames .",
    "the multispin creation operators may be written as linear sums of products of the individual spin raising operators @xmath134 , i.e. , @xmath135 .",
    "after calculation of the correlation coefficients ( @xmath129 , @xmath130 ) , we can then calculate the gs energy using @xmath136 , and the magnetic order parameter , which is defined to be the average local on - site magnetization , @xmath137 , with respect to the local rotated spin coordinates described above .",
    "if we include all possible multispin configurations for the calculation of the correlation coefficients ( @xmath129 , @xmath130 ) , then the ccm formalism becomes exact .",
    "of course in practice one needs to truncate the set , and there are several well - developed and systematically improvable truncation hierarchies that have been extremely widely tested by now . for spin-@xmath0 systems we usually use the well - established localized lsub@xmath138 truncation scheme where we keep at a given truncation level specified by the truncation index @xmath138 only all of those multi - spin configurations which may be defined over all possible lattice animals ( or polyominos ) of size @xmath138 on the lattice .",
    "a lattice animal ( or polyomino ) of size @xmath138 is defined as a set of @xmath138 contiguous sites in the usual graph - theoretic sense where every site is adjacent ( in the nearest - neighbor sense ) to at least one other site .",
    "the method of solving for higher orders of lsub@xmath138 approximations is well documented in refs .",
    "[ ] , to which the interested reader is referred for further details .",
    "table [ table_fundconfig ] shows the number @xmath139 of fundamental configurations that are inequivalent after all space and point - group symmetries of both the hamiltonian and the model state have been taken into account , for each of the nel , striped , spiral , and anti - nel model states of the spin-@xmath0 @xmath1@xmath2@xmath3 model on the honeycomb lattice .",

    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table_fundconfig ]    we note that the number @xmath139 of such independent spin configurations taken into account in the ccm correlation operators @xmath125 and @xmath126 increases rapidly with the truncation index @xmath138 .",
    "clearly the number of independent configurations is smaller for states such as the nel state that have a higher degree of point - group symmetry , and for which we can utilize conservation laws such as @xmath142 , where @xmath143 is the total spin operator referred to the global spin coordinates .",
    "clearly the spiral state has the largest number @xmath139 , for a given level of lsub@xmath138 approximation , from among our four model states , and for this state we are limited to values @xmath144 even with the use of massively parallel computing to derive and solve the corresponding coupled sets of ccm bra- and ket - state equations.@xcite for the spiral state we note too that we have the additional computational cost that the pitch angle @xmath145 at a given lsub@xmath138 level must be chosen to minimize the corresponding estimate for the gs energy . for specified values of each of the exchange parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 ( with @xmath4 )",
    "a typical computational run for the spiral phase at the lsub@xmath146 level typically requires about 5@xmath147h computing time using 3000 processors simultaneously .",
    "although the ccm works from the outset in the limit @xmath148 of an infinite number of spins , and hence the need for any finite - size scaling is obviated , we do still need to extrapolate the lsub@xmath138 data to reach results in the exact @xmath149 limit . although there are no known exact extrapolation rules , by now there exists a wealth of empirical experience in extrapolating the gs energy , @xmath150 , and the magnetic order parameter ( i.e. , the average local on - site magnetization ) , @xmath151 . for the gs energy per spin , @xmath152 , a well - established and very accurate extrapolation ansatz ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "[ ] ) is @xmath153 whereas for the magnetic order parameter , @xmath151 , we use different schemes depending on different circumstances , specifically on whether the system is highly frustrated or not .",
    "thus , for systems with a gs order - disorder transition or with a considerable degree of frustration , such as is the case for the present model , we use ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "[ ] ) @xmath154 when we have only three data points to fit to an extrapolation formula , such as will sometimes occur here , specifically for the spiral phase , a two - term extrapolation fit can easily be preferable in practice to a three - term fit .",
    "this is particularly the case when one of the data points is either far from the limiting case or when it does not represent all of the features of the system as well as the remaining , more accurate points . in such cases",

    "we note that a quite different recent ed study@xcite of the model ( along the @xmath48 line only ) , which used a nn singlet valence - bond basis , found very similar critical points to ours for the boundaries of the qp phase , but found that while the qp phase was bounded on one side ( for smaller values of @xmath40 ) by the n phase , it was bounded on the other side by a sdvbc phase .",
    "however , these results would again be equally consistent with the identification of this phase as our an phase , since their interpretation is strongly biased by their choice of basis .    a quite separate study of the case @xmath48",
    "has also been performed recently based on an entangled - plaquette variational ( epv ) ansatz.@xcite this epv study uses a single very broad class of entangled - plaquette states as trial wave functions , and finds in this very unbiased way that along the @xmath48 line the model has n , qp , and an phases with critical points very close to ours . in the same region studied by us (",

    "an uncertainty remains over the precise extent of the phase with spiral order , and whether or not there is an an phase along the @xmath48 line for values of @xmath40 beyond the point where the qp phase disappears , and hence also for small positive values of @xmath41 up to the point where spiral order sets in .",
    "the other main uncertainty is the nature of the qp phase itself .",
    "we have argued here that over at least some widely separated points on the boundaries with the n , s , and an phases the qp phase has pvbc order .",

    "by contrast the epv calculations@xcite along the @xmath48 line seem to favor a disordered ( spin - liquid ) phase , while spin - wave calculations@xcite favor sdvbc order along the same line in the qp regime .",
    "the pffrg study,@xcite also done over the entire @xmath5 $ ] window , finds evidence too that a large part of the qp regime has strong sdvbc order , while the part with smaller values of @xmath40 has only weak pvbc order . on the other hand",
    "the se study@xcite finds that sdvbc order is not favored , at least for low values of @xmath41 .",
    "we should note , however , that the se study is in broad disagreement with most other studies along the @xmath48 line , in that it finds no evidence at all for a magnetically disordered phase there , but instead finds that the n phase first gives way to the second classical spiral phase , and then later to the spiral phase considered here , as @xmath40 is increased . on the other hand ,",
    "the se results are consistent with the finding from the ed+sccmf analysis@xcite that at least for some parameter ranges the sdvbc state might be very difficult to distinguish from magnetically ordered states such as our s state .    finally we note that the ed+sccmf study also presents evidence for the n to pvbc transition being a strong candidate for a deconfined transition , just as we have found in our earlier ccm studies of the model along the @xmath50 line@xcite and along the @xmath48 line.@xcite clearly this model still has open questions , but we believe that the ccm results presented here have furthered our understanding of it .",
