    "the broad - band spectral sensitivities of two x - ray astronomy spacecraft , the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ , bradt , rothschild , & swank 1993 ) and _ bepposax _ ( boella et al . 1997 ) , combined with the high timing resolution of _ rxte _ , have allowed major advances in recent years in the study of low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) .",
    "progress has been particularly rapid in the field of x - ray bursters ( xrbs ) , binary systems containing a low - magnetic field neutron star ( ns ) accreting matter from a late - type companion star via roche lobe overflow .",
    "it had become apparent by the mid 1990 s that ns systems were capable of producing hard x - ray ( @xmath2 kev ) emission , as indicated by batse and sigma detections of several xrb at @xmath3 kev ( barret & vedrenne 1994 , tavani & barret 1997 and references therein ) .",
    "this eliminated hard x - ray radiation as a unique identifier of black hole ( bh ) systems , but the limited sensitivity and spectral resolution of these instruments , together with the lack of simultaneous soft x - ray observations , did not allow the spectral shape to be studied in detail or possible differences between ns and bh hard x - ray properties to be determined .",
    "the two new satellites are revolutionary due to their broad spectral coverage : the proportional counter array ( pca ) and high energy x - ray timing experiment ( hexte ) instruments on _ rxte _ cover the range 2150 kev , while the suite of narrow - field instruments ( nfis ) on _ bepposax _ combine to cover 0.1200 kev .",
    "many xrb have now been observed with these experiments , allowing detailed modeling of the complete x - ray to hard x - ray spectra with a variety of complex models ( e.g. , church et al .",
    "1998 ; guainazzi et al .",
    "1998 ; in t zand et al . 1999 ; olive et al .",
    "1999 , piraino et al . 1999a ; piraino et al . 1999b ; barret et al .",
    "1999 , 2000 ) .",
    "in addition to broad spectral coverage , _ rxte _ offers unprecedented timing resolution ( @xmath4s ) due to the large collecting area of the pca .",
    "this has led directly to the discovery of quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) with frequencies near 1000 hz ( khz qpos ) in the x - ray timing power spectra of many ns systems ( strohmayer et al .",
    "1996 ; van der klis et al .",
    "since kilohertz frequencies are naturally associated with orbital timescales near a ns , it is generally accepted that the khz qpos are produced in the inner accretion disk and that the frequency is related to the inner disk radius .",
    "if this is true , the khz qpos are a potentially valuable probe of strong field gravity ( kaaret & ford 1997 ) .",
    "in particular , the relationship between qpo frequency and accretion rate should provide a means to test for the existence of the marginally stable orbit predicted by general relativity ( kaaret , ford , & chen 1997 ; zhang , strohmayer , & swank 1997 ) .",
    "in this paper we present the results of _ rxte _ observations of 4u 1820 - 30 , an xrb with a particularly colorful history .",
    "4u 1820 - 30 is located in the core of the globular cluster ngc 6624 and was one of the first globular cluster x - ray sources discovered ( giacconi et al .",
    "the distance to ngc 6624 , @xmath5 kpc , was derived by vacca et al .",
    "( 1986 ) from a study of horizontal branch stars .",
    "thus the distance to 4u 1820 - 30 is among the better known of all x - ray sources .",
    "it is the brightest globular cluster source , and was the first identified x - ray burster ( grindlay et al .",
    "the source has been observed to shift between a high and a low state with a period of about 176 days ( priedhorsky & terrell 1984 ) ; in the all sky monitor ( asm ) on _ rxte _ the 212 kev flux varies by typically a factor of @xmath6 and as much as a factor of @xmath7 between the two states ( see figure  [ fig - asm ] )",
    ". also observed is an 11 minute ( 685 s ) period believed to be the orbital period , the shortest known orbital period of all cosmic binary systems ( stella , priedhorsky , & white 1987 ) .",
    "such a short period suggests that the mass - donating star is a helium dwarf with a mass of 0.060.08 m@xmath8 ( rappaport et al .",
    "two simultaneous khz qpos were detected in the persistent flux from 4u 1820 - 30 by smale , zhang , & white ( 1997 ) .",
    "the goal of the present investigation is to observe the broad - band ( 2150 kev ) spectrum of 4u 1820 - 30 with the pca and hexte instruments on _ rxte _ and to study the relationships between spectral parameters , khz qpo frequencies , and accretion rate .",
    "the steady 176-day variation of the flux from 4u 1820 - 30 is most likely due to modulation of the accretion flow , since x - ray bursts are only observed in the low state ( stella , priedhorsky , & white 1987 ) , and so this source provides a good laboratory for the study of accretion - related spectral changes .",
    "we have observed 4u 1820 - 30 over the course of a year at roughly monthly intervals to sample the entire 176-day period .",
    "this same data set was used to study timing properties by zhang et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . in section  [ sec - prev ]",
    "we describe previous spectral and timing observations of 4u 1820 - 30 . in section  [ sec - obsanal ]",
    "we describe the observations and our analysis procedure .",
    "the results are presented in section  [ sec - res ] , discussed in section  [ sec - disc ] , and we state our conclusions in section  [ sec - conc ] .",
    "as evidenced by its long history , 4u 1820 - 30 is an extremely well - studied system . in this section",
    "we briefly review previous spectral and timing observations of the source .",
    "4u 1820 - 30 has previously been observed by _ ans _ , _ exosat _ , _ ginga _ , _ asca _ , _ einstein _ , and _ bepposax_. a wide variety of models have been used to fit the recorded spectra , but the most successful have been two - component models consisting of either optically thin thermal bremsstrahlung plus a blackbody ( tb + bb ) , a power law with exponential cutoff ( an analytical approximation of unsaturated comptonization ) plus a blackbody ( cpl + bb ) , or a more detailed comptonization model developed by sunyaev & titarchuk ( 1980 ) plus a blackbody ( compst + bb , after the _ compst _ model in xspec ) .",
    "models based on optically thin thermal bremsstrahlung are widely believed to be unphysical for xrb , since the emission measures typically derived ( @xmath9 @xmath10 ) imply , for small optical depths , that the plasma cloud has a radius @xmath11 cm , too large to be heated to several kev by the neutron star ( white et al .",
    "1986 ; christian & swank 1997 ) .",
    "we therefore restrict our attention to the cpl and compst ( with or without a bb ) model results .",
    "the important parameters for the cpl + bb model are the blackbody temperature @xmath12 , the power law photon index @xmath13 , and the exponential cutoff energy @xmath14 . for the compst + bb model ,",
    "the parameters of interest are @xmath12 and the temperature @xmath15 and optical depth @xmath16 of the comptonizing electron cloud , assumed here to be spherical .",
    "photoelectric absorption at low energies by the interstellar medium must be included as well , given by the equivalent hydrogen column density @xmath17 ( found using the absorption cross sections of morrison & mccammon(1983 ) ) .",
    "finally , a gaussian line feature at @xmath18 kev is often required , representing a blend of @xmath19 emission lines from helium - like ions of iron ( fe xxv or xxvi ; white et al .",
    "1986 ; hirano et al .",
    "a summary of previously - reported spectral fits using these models is given in table  [ tab - prev ] and shown graphically in figure  [ fig - comp ] ; we discuss them briefly here .",
    "intensity - related spectral changes were first reported for 4u 1820 - 30 by parsignault & grindlay ( 1978 ) using _",
    "ans_/hxx data and a power law fit .",
    "they found that the photon index @xmath13 varied between @xmath20 at high count rates and @xmath21 at low count rates , indicative of spectral hardening at low luminosity .",
    "more complex models could be used after the _ exosat _ me instrument observed 4u 1820 - 30 between 1984 and 1985 ( stella , white , & priedhorsky 1987 ) , finding a high state luminosity ( 130 kev ) of @xmath22 ergs  s@xmath23and a low state luminosity of @xmath24 ergs  s@xmath23 . fits with the cpl + bb model ( stella , white , & priedhorsky 1987 ) gave low state values of @xmath25 , @xmath26 kev , and @xmath27 kev , while in the high state @xmath13 decreased to 1.7 , @xmath14 decreased to @xmath28 kev , and @xmath12 fell to 2.0 kev .",
    "note that the inclusion of an exponential cutoff has changed the intensity - related behavior of @xmath13 compared to the _ ans _ results ; the softening of the spectrum is now described by the lower cutoff energy while @xmath13 describes the spectrum below this .",
    "white , stella , & parmar ( 1988 ) fitted the compst + bb model to the _ exosat _ data and found that between the low and high states @xmath12 decreased from 2.06 to 1.61 kev , @xmath15 fell slightly from 3.5 to 3.3 kev , and @xmath16 decreased from 13.2 to 11.9 . for both models",
    "the ratio of blackbody to `` hard component '' flux @xmath29 decreased from 50% to 25% as the luminosity increased . in a similar energy band , the _ ginga _",
    "lacs observed 4u 1820 - 30 at two different intensity levels in 1987 may ( ercan et al . 1993 ) , but the power law was steeper with a lower cutoff than in the _ exosat _ spectrum ( table  [ tab - prev ] ) .",
    "the ratio @xmath29 was similar however .",
    "lower energy coverage was provided by _ asca_/gis and _ einstein _ observations .",
    "_ asca _ observed 4u 1820 - 30 in 1993 in the low state and the spectrum ( 0.611 kev ) was fitted with the compst + bb model ( smale et al .",
    "compst parameters were similar to those found by _ exosat _ , but the blackbody temperature was substantially lower ( @xmath30 kev ) .",
    "christian & swank ( 1997 ) report on an _ einstein _ ( sss + mpc ) observation ( 0.520 kev ) of 4u 1820 - 30 from 1978 .",
    "the luminosity was @xmath31 ergs  s@xmath23 , indicative of the high state , and yet fitting the compst + bb model gave paramters very similar to those from _",
    "asca _ ( table  [ tab - prev ] ) .",
    "the blackbody flux was only 6% of the compst flux .",
    "the first observations of 4u 1820 - 30 extending above @xmath32 kev were made by the nfis ( 0.1200 kev ) on _ bepposax _ in 1998 ( piraino et al . 1999a ; kaaret et al . 1999 ) .",
    "these were the first truly broad - band observations , though they covered only a narrow range in luminosity ( table  [ tab - prev ] ) .",
    "a cpl + bb fit to the 0.340 kev spectrum gave @xmath33 kev , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 kev , while the compst + bb model yielded @xmath36 0.460.66 kev , @xmath37 kev , and @xmath38 .",
    "thus the instruments with response below 1 kev consistently find low values of @xmath12 .",
    "the entire range of luminosities observed so far with all instruments has yielded very similar values for the parameters of the compst + bb model .",
    "the _ bepposax _ phoswich detection system ( pds ) failed to detect 4u 1820 - 30 above 40 kev , consistent with the failure of batse to detect the source ( 20100 kev ) over the first four years of the _ cgro _ mission ( bloser et al .",
    "thus 4u 1820 - 30 is not a member of the class of xrb detected at @xmath3 kev .",
    "two simultaneous khz qpos were discovered in the persistent emission of 4u 1820 - 30 by smale , zhang , & white ( 1997 ) using _",
    "rxte_/pca data from 1996 october .",
    "the characteristics of the qpos were similar to those found in other xrb : their centroid frequencies were correlated with the 260 kev pca count rate , but the frequency difference remained constant at @xmath39 hz .",
    "the fractional rms amplitudes increased dramatically with energy .",
    "zhang et al . (",
    "1998 ) studied monthly pca observations of 4u 1820 - 30 ( the same data set reported on here ; see section  [ sec - obsanal ] ) and found that the frequencies of the qpos are only correlated with pca count rate below a critical value .",
    "above this , the qpo frequencies remain constant while the count rate increases .",
    "saturation of qpo frequency at high mass accretion rates is an expected signature of the marginally stable orbit ( miller , lamb , & psaltis 1998 ; kaaret , ford , & chen 1997 ) ; however , mndez et al .",
    "( 1999 ) have shown that pca count rate is not a good indicator of accretion rate .",
    "kaaret et al .",
    "( 1999 ) used more reliable estimators of mass accretion rate , broad - band flux and hard color , to show that the frequency saturation is robust and thus strong evidence that the inner disk in 4u 1820 - 30 does reach the marginally stable orbit at high accretion rates .",
    "the pca instrument on _ rxte _ is made up of five xenon proportional counter units ( pcus , numbered 04 ) sensitive from 260 kev with a total area of about 6500 @xmath40 ( bradt , rothschild , & swank 1993 ) .",
    "the hexte instrument consists of two clusters of four nai(tl)/csi(na ) phoswich scintillation detectors sensitive from 15200 kev with an effective area of 1600 @xmath40 ; these clusters rock on and off source to obtain background measurements ( rothschild et al .",
    "the asm is comprised of three scanning shadow cameras ( sscs ) with one - dimensional slit masks and @xmath41 fields of view that monitor the fluxes of bright x - ray sources several times a day in the 212 kev band ( levine et al . 1996 ) .",
    "sixteen joint pca / hexte pointed observations of 4u 1820 - 30 were performed at roughly monthly intervals between 1997 february 9 and 1997 september 10 .",
    "in addition , seven observations made between 1996 october 26 and 31 were included ( smale et al . 1997 ) .",
    "the _ rxte_/asm 212 kev light curve of 4u 1820 - 30 during this period is shown in figure  [ fig - asm ] , with the times of our pointed observations marked .",
    "each point represents the one - day average of the asm count rate .",
    "the 176-day modulation is clearly visible and is well - sampled by the pointed observations .",
    "the asm count rate varies from @xmath42 to @xmath32 counts s@xmath43 during this time , or @xmath44 mcrab to @xmath45 mcrab . assuming a crab - like spectrum and @xmath46 @xmath47 ( see below )",
    ", these low and high state values correspond to 120 kev luminosities of @xmath48 ergs  s@xmath23and @xmath49 ergs  s@xmath23 , respectively , consistent with the range of luminosities observed previously ( table  [ tab - prev ] ) .",

    "event mode data were used instead of the standard archive mode data because the 1996 archive data files were corrupted ; this problem has been corrected in the reprocessed distribution of 1996 data .",

    "the soft and hard colors are defined as the ratios of background - subtracted pca count rates in the bands 3.56.4 kev and 2.03.5 kev , and 9.716.0 kev and 6.49.7 kev , respectively .",
    "the ccd is shown in figure  [ fig - ccd ] .",
    "we observe 4u 1820 - 30 in all three of the states associated with `` atoll '' sources ( hasinger & van der klis 1989 ) : the island state , lower banana branch , and upper banana branch .",
    "this confirms that the 176-day modulation is in fact due to variation in the mass accretion rate .",
    "figure  [ fig - ccd ] shows that we have adequately sampled the long period and observed the source in all of its possible states .",
    "closed symbols indicate data segments in which khz qpos were discovered by zhang et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , while filled symbols indicate data without khz qpos .",
    "it is generally believed that in atoll sources the mass accretion rate @xmath51 increases monotonically as the source moves from the island state , through the lower banana , and into the upper banana branch ( hasinger & van der klis 1989 ) .",
    "mndez et al .",
    "( 1999 ) defined the parameter @xmath1 to measure the position of an atoll source within its ccd and thus parameterize its accretion rate .",
    "we follow mndez et al .",

    "@xmath1 is then defined as the distance along this curve , as measured from the island state .",
    "we arbitrarily set @xmath52 at ( 2.378,0.650 ) and @xmath53 at ( 2.671,0.597 ) in the ccd .",
    "each data point is assigned the value of @xmath1 of the point closest to it on the curve . the error in @xmath1",
    "is estimated by simply projecting the error bars of the data points onto the curve .",
    "thus we may use @xmath1 in addition to the source luminosity to study accretion rate - related changes in spectral parameters or khz qpo behavior .",
    "the advantage in using @xmath1 instead of the hard color ( kaaret et al . 1999 ) to track the dependence of qpo frequency on accretion rate is that @xmath1 is more sensitive to changes of state along the nearly horizontal banana branch , which is where the break in qpo frequency observed by zhang et al .",
    "( 1998 ) occurs .",
    "the spectral analysis was performed using xspec v10.0 ( arnaud 1996 ) .",
    "spectra for each pcu and hexte cluster were reduced separately and combined within xspec . due to systematic uncertainties in the response matrices ,",
    "only hexte data above 20 kev was used .",
    "several authors have written on systematic effects in the pca and their effect on spectral fitting ( e.g. sobczak et al .",
    "1999 ; barret et al .",
    "2000 ; wilms et al . 1999 ; tomsick et al .",
    "1999 ) ; we performed similar investigations and reached similar conclusions .",
    "we extracted spectra for each pcu from archival crab observations spanning the year of our observations ( 1996 oct 27 , 1997 mar 22 , 1997 jul 26 , and 1997 dec 15 ) and fit them with an absorbed power law .",
    "initially we used response matrices generated by _ pcarmf _",
    "v3.5 , but we got very poor fits with large systematic deviations in the residuals , especially around 5 kev .",
    "the residuals were far better using the v2.2.1 response matrices for all four crab observations , and so we used these for all our 4u 1820 - 30 fits .",
    "the residuals still showed large systematic effects below 2.5 kev and above 20 kev , and so we restricted our fits to this energy range .",
    "we also found , as have other authors , that the residuals in pcus 2 and 3 are considerably worse than those in pcus 0 , 1 , and 4 .",
    "for this reason we use only pcus 0 , 1 , and 4 in our fits .",
    "pcu 4 was on during all observations except 1997 may 28 .",
    "the relative normalizations of the three pcus and two hexte clusters were left as free parameters , since there still exist large uncertainties in the relative flux normalizations . in our crab fits ,",
    "all three pcus find power law normalizations 20%30% higher than the accepted value of @xmath54 photons @xmath47 s@xmath43 kev@xmath43 at 1 kev ( e.g. jung 1989 ) .",
    "tomsick et al . ( 1999 ) have reported similar results .",
    "all spectral model normalizations reported here are obtained from pcu 0 ; in tables  [ tab - fits1]  [ tab - fits3 ] ( and also figure  [ fig - gauss ] ) we report the flux values found directly by pcu 0 , while when comparing luminosities with previous measurements ( figure  [ fig - comp ] ) we reduce the pca values by 15% ( see section  [ sec - disc ] ) .",
    "a systematic error of 1% was added to all pca channels using _",
    "grppha_. in figure  [ fig - twospec ] we show two representative pca and hexte spectra of 4u 1820 - 30 , one from the low island state and one from the high banana state .",
    "the hardening of the spectrum at low luminosity is clear . in the island state",
    "the source is detected by hexte only up to 50 kev , confirming the lack of a detection above this by _ bepposax _ ( piraino et al .",
    "1999 ) and batse ( bloser et al . 1996 ) .    for our spectral analysis data segments were grouped according to their position in the ccd as follows : spectra were extracted for each of the 90 data segments .",
    "the four island state segments were combined into one spectrum , and the five uppermost banana state segments were each analyzed as separate spectra . in between",
    ", data segments were grouped into 26 bins of width 0.025 in @xmath1 and combined together , with an average value of @xmath1 and the total exposure time computed for each bin .",
    "thus we had a total of 32 spectra to fit ( see tables  [ tab - fits1]  [ tab - fits3 ] ) .",
    "all spectra were initially fit with two models : the cpl model described in section  [ sec - prev ] , and the recently - developed comptonization model of titarchuk ( 1994 ) , called the _",
    "comptt _ model in xspec .",
    "this model improves on the compst model by including relativistic effects and extending the theory to work in both the optically thin and thick cases .",
    "in addition to the comptonizing electron temperature @xmath15 and optical depth @xmath16 , an additional parameter is the temperature of the cool seed photons @xmath55 , assumed to follow a wien law .",
    "we consider only a spherical geometry for comparison with previous results . in nearly all cases",
    "the model fits were improved by the addition of a blackbody component .",
    "we also included a gaussian line component at @xmath18 kev in all spectra and a smeared absorption edge in the island state , as described in more detail in section  [ sub - spec ] .",
    "some xrb have recently been fit with a multi - color disk blackbody ( dbb ; mitsuda et al .",
    "1984 ) instead of a simple single - temperature bb to account for the soft excess ( guainazzi et al . 1999 ; barret et al . 1999 ) .",
    "we also fit all our spectra with a model consisting of a cpl plus this disk blackbody ( cpl + dbb model ) .",
    "the dbb model parameters are the color temperature of the inner disk @xmath56 and the projected inner disk radius @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the inclination of the system .",
    "it is expected , however , that the true spectrum emitted by the accretion disk will be that of a `` diluted blackbody '' due to the effects of electron scattering , and the dbb parameters must then be modified by a spectral hardening factor @xmath59 ( ebisawa et al .",

    "the ccd was reproduced with bins of 128 seconds , and each point was grouped into one of five phase bins .",

    "we therefore froze @xmath74 at 6.8 kev and @xmath75 at 0.8 kev for our fits with the comptt + bb model , since we found that the gaussian parameters were less well defined with this choice of continuum .",
    "the gaussian parameters were left free for the cpl + dbb fits , and no difference was found between the island and banana state line energies ( table  [ tab - fits3 ] ) .",

    "we show the spectral parameters of the cpl + bb and comptt + bb models as a function of @xmath1 , and thus presumably of @xmath51 . in both models",
    "it is clear that the parameters of the hard spectral component are correlated with the accretion rate , especially as the accretion rate become low , in the sense that the spectrum becomes harder as @xmath51 decreases .",

    "this change is not gradual throughout the ccd , however ; only as the source moves from the lower banana to the island state do the parameters change appreciably .",
    "the optical depth @xmath16 of the comptt model drops at lower @xmath51 , and the power law index @xmath13 ( inversely related to @xmath16 in the cpl approximation ) rises .",
    "this general behavior is consistent with that seen in other sources ( e.g. , barret et al .",
    "2000 ; christian & swank 1997 ) .",
    "the most intriguing feature of figure  [ fig - params ] is that the parameters of the comptt + bb model show a distinct change at @xmath93 .",
    "the ratio @xmath29 is inversely correlated with @xmath1 below this , but becomes constant above .",
    "the blackbody temperature @xmath12 drops from @xmath94 kev to @xmath95 kev , and the blackbody radius @xmath83 begins to increase from @xmath96 km to @xmath97 2 km .",

    "these `` special '' values of @xmath99 and @xmath98 are especially interesting because , as shown in section  [ sub - qpo ] above , these are the same values at which the khz qpos saturate in frequency and disappear completely , respectively . thus the accretion flow must be changing at the values of @xmath51 corresponding to these values of @xmath1 in a way that affects both the energy spectrum and the frequencies of the khz qpos . the fact that this correlation is seen only with the comptt + bb model suggests that this model is the more accurate description of the spectrum . in figure  [ fig - wien ]",
    "we show the seed photon temperature @xmath55 and the wien radius @xmath87 described above as a function of @xmath1 .",
    "although the error bars are large , there is an indication that the temperature and radius are anticorrelated below @xmath99 and constant above .",
    "this is precisely the behavior expected if the seed photons are coming from the inner part of the accretion disk , and the disk is contracting until it reaches the last stable orbit at @xmath99 as indicated by the khz qpos .",
    "this trend gives us confidence in the fitted values of @xmath55 , which must still be treated with some caution because the peak of the wien spectrum at @xmath100 lies below the pca energy range .",
    "the large values of the wien radius also suggest that the seed photons originate in the disk .",
    "the parameters for the cpl + dbb model are shown in figure  [ fig - paramsdbb ] .",
    "the cut - off power law components behave similarly to those in the cpl + bb model , though the values of @xmath13 and @xmath14 are both considerably lower .",
    "this is because the dbb model prefers lower temperatures than the simple bb , and so the curvature in the spectrum at higher energies must now be described by a lower cutoff value .",
    "the behavior of the dbb component is of great interest : @xmath56 rises and @xmath101 falls with increasing accretion rate until @xmath72 , then both remain nearly constant ( though there is some indication that @xmath56 continues to rise slowly ) .",
    "the fraction of the total luminosity in the dbb component increases with @xmath1 in the same manner .",
    "thus it appears that the accretion disk inner radius grows smaller and hotter as the accretion rate increases until the last stable orbit is reached at @xmath99 .",
    "this behavior of the dbb component is consistent with that expected from the behavior of the khz qpos .",
    "thus this model is also compelling as an accurate physical description of the system .",
    "first we compare our spectral results for 4u 1820 - 30 to those previously reported using the cpl + bb and comptt + bb models . in figure  [ fig - comp ] we show our _ rxte _ spectral parameters together with the previously - reported parameters described in section  [ sec - prevspec ] and table  [ tab - prev ] . here",
    "we plot the spectral parameters as a function of the total 250 kev luminosity , assuming a distance of 6.4 kpc .",
    "the luminosities of the previous measurements have been translated into the 250 kev band based on the reported parameters and fluxes . the integrated 250 kev flux in the archival crab spectra ( see section  [ sec - fitting ] ) is @xmath102% higher than what is expected ; therefore , the _ rxte _ luminosities in figure  [ fig - comp ] have been divided by a factor of 1.15 for proper comparison to previous instruments .",
    "it is immediately obvious that there is considerable disagreement between different instruments . in general , the _ rxte _ spectral parameters agree most closely with those found by _",
    "exosat _ and _ ginga _ , and differ the most from those found by _ bepposax_. more specifically , the _ rxte _ bb component parameters agree fairly well with those found by _",

    "the _ exosat _",
    "cpl parameters also agree well with our values in the low and high states , as do the _ einstein",
    "_ values ( christian & swank ( 1997 ) do not report bb values for the cpl model with _ einstein _ ) .",
    "the _ bepposax _ bb parameters and cpl spectral index @xmath13 differ considerably from ours .",
    "all of the experiments that used a compst model found comptonization parameters that agree well with our comptt parameters at high luminosity . in the low state ,",
    "however , _ exosat _ did not observe the increase in @xmath15 and decrease in @xmath16 that we see .",
    "it is strange that the _ exosat _ low state observation could only place a lower limit of @xmath32 kev on @xmath14 for the cpl model , yet could still constrain such a low @xmath107 kev for the compst model .",
    "it is apparent that our island state observation is the first observation of 4u 1820 - 30 in the low state since _",
    "exosat _ , and it is puzzling that the comptonization parameters differ so much .",
    "further observations in the island state are needed , but the low duty cycle in this state seen in figure  [ fig - asm ] makes this difficult .",
    "it is apparent from table  [ tab - prev ] and figure  [ fig - comp ] that those experiments without sensitivity below 1 kev , i.e. _ exosat _ , _ ginga _ , and _ rxte _ , find consistently higher @xmath12 and lower @xmath83 than do those instruments with sensitivity below 1 kev , i.e. _ asca _ , _ einstein _ , and _",

    "the instruments with low energy sensitivity find @xmath108 km , consistent with the radius of a neutron star .",
    "the other instruments , including _ rxte _ , find @xmath109 km , implying that the blackbody component can come from only a limited region of the neutron star surface , such as an optically thick boundary layer .",
    "( an alternate explanation for apparently small blackbody radii for xrbs given by rutledge et al . ( 1999 ) , that a blackbody is not an appropriate model and fits with hydrogen atmosphere models give radii near 10 km , is not applicable to 4u 1820 - 30 since the accretion rate is too high . )",
    "we have attempted to fit our _ rxte _ spectra with a bb component with @xmath110 kev , forcing the fit to find a new local minimum . for a comptt + bb model of this type",
    ", @xmath12 remained nearly constant at @xmath111 kev while @xmath83 stayed at @xmath112 km , too large for a ns surface .",
    "the seed photon energy @xmath55 decreased from 1.8 kev to 1 kev as @xmath1 increased from 1.0 to 1.4 , which also seems unphysical , and neither @xmath15 nor @xmath16 changed their behavior at the interesting values of @xmath1 .",
    "the new model was unable to reproduce the observed counts at energies above 3040 kev in the island state .",
    "this , together with the clear change in the behavior of our bb parameters at an `` interesting '' value of @xmath1 ( or @xmath113 ) seen in figure  [ fig - params ] , leads us to conclude that the bb component parameters listed in tables  [ tab - fits1 ] and  [ tab - fits2 ] are the best fits to our data for the cpl + bb and comptt + bb models .",
    "we note , however , that properly measuring low energy components depends on having the correct @xmath17 , which we can not measure with the pca , and so it is entirely possible that additional components exist in the true spectrum .",
    "this notion is perhaps supported by the fact that the seed photon temperature found in the comptt + bb model is in good agreement with the bb temperature found by _",
    "our _ rxte _ data on 4u 1820 - 30 may be described equally well by two different physically - motivated models ( comptt + bb and cpl + dbb ) , both of which have parameters that appear to `` know '' about the saturation of khz qpo frequency at the accretion rate corresponding to @xmath99 .",
    "the physical interpretation of these two models leads to two different pictures of the origin of the spectral components in xrbs .",
    "neither picture , however , is completely consistent with theoretical and observational constraints .",
    "the question of the origin of the soft and hard spectral components in xrbs has been addressed by many authors ( e.g. , white , stella , & parmar 1988 ; guainazzi et al .",
    "1998 ; olive et al . 1999 ,",
    "barret et al . 1999 , 2000 ) .",
    "early work supposed that the accretion disk intersects the ns surface in an optically thick boundary layer which is the source of the blackbody component observed in xrbs .",
    "a potentially useful diagnostic is the ratio of flux or luminosity in the bb component to the flux in the hard component ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "sunyaev & shakura ( 1986 ) showed that , if relativistic effects are taken into account , the luminosity of the boundary layer should be at least equal to that of the disk , and can be more than twice it if the disk extends all the way to the marginally stable orbit .",
    "we find @xmath114 at all times for the comptt + bb and cpl + dbb models , and in the comptt + bb model at high accretion rates it is as low as 0.1 .",
    "many authors ( white , stella , & parmar 1988 ; barret et al .",
    "1999 , 2000 ; table  [ tab - prev ] ) have found similar results for this and other sources .",
    "guainazzi et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and barret et al .",
    "( 1999 ) suggest that this implies the weak bb component is produced by an optically thick accretion disk , while the strong comptt component originates in an optically _ thin _ boundary layer through a process such as the gap accretion model of kluniak & wilson ( 1991 ) .",
    "barret et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , however , argue that the similarities between ns and bh hard x - ray emission require that both be produced by the same mechanism , which rules out boundary layer processes .",
    "in addition , church et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have found that the evolution of spectra during x - ray dips in sources such as 4u 1916 - 05 are consistent with a compact blackbody emitter being occulted while an extended hard x - ray emitter is only partially covered . from timing of dip ingresses and egresses",
    "they estimate a diameter of @xmath115 cm for the hard x - ray emitting region .",
    "thus one possibility is that the bb component is produced in an optically thick boundary layer covering a fraction of the neutron star surface , while the cpl or comptt component comes from an extended hot corona .",
    "some mechanism must then reduce the luminosity of the boundary layer relative to that of the disk and corona .",
    "white , stella , & parmar ( 1988 ) suggest that the ns may be spinning close to equilibrium with the inner edge of the accretion disk , which would lessen the energy dissipated in the boundary layer , but the ns spin periods measured with _ rxte _",
    "( typically @xmath116 hz ) are well below this .",
    "another possibility discussed by barret et al .",
    "( 2000 ) is that an optically thick boundary layer does not exist .",
    "instead , within the standard optically thick accretion disk there exists a hot , optically thin phase of the accretion flow such as the advection - dominated solutions of narayan & yi ( 1995 ) .",
    "such a picture has been applied successfully to bh systems ( esin et al . 1998 ) .",
    "barret et al .",
    "( 2000 ) suggest that the boundary between such a hot flow and the ns may well be optically thin and thus neither contribute to the bb component ( now coming entirely from the disk ) nor quench the hot advective flow and cause it to collapse to a thick disk ( yi et al .",
    "the ns surface must still be a source of cool reprocessed photons , however , and it is not clear what effect this must have .",
    "we can interpret our comptt + bb model fits for 4u 1820 - 30 in terms of the former of these two possibilities , in which the 2.3 kev bb flux comes from an optically think boundary layer and the comptt component from an extended corona .",
    "we have noted that in figure  [ fig - params ] the ratio @xmath29 decreases as the optical depth of the comptonizing cloud increases , and both become nearly constant at the same accretion rate . in figure  [ fig - tauratio ]",
    "we show @xmath29 as a function of @xmath16 ; the two are obviously strongly anticorrelated .",
    "thus perhaps the bb emission from the boundary layer is simply becoming more obscured as the optical depth of the corona increases , and the boundary layer emission is being redistributed to higher energies by the comptonizing cloud . at the accretion rate corresponding to the break , the @xmath94 kev boundary layer could be completely obscured , and a cooler , @xmath105 kev disk component would begin to dominate the bb part of the spectrum .",
    "this component is emitted from radii outside the inner hot cloud , leading to the upward trend in @xmath83 observed at the same @xmath1 . in this scenario",
    "a multicolor disk blackbody model would be preferable for the higher luminosity spectra , but as noted in section  [ sec - fitting ] fits of a dbb together with the comptt model were indeterminate .",
    "such a scenario ties in with the accretion rate - dependence of the khz qpo frequencies .",
    "the origin of khz qpos is often explained by means of a `` beat - frequency '' model . the magnetospheric beat - frequency model ( lamb 1991 ) , which was developed to explain horizontal branch oscillations ( hbos ) in z sources , has been suggested by strohmayer et al . ( 1996 ) as the source of khz qpo pairs as well .",
    "miller , lamb , & psaltis ( 1998 ) point out that it is not clear how the x - ray modulation at the orbital frequency of the disk is produced in this model , and that it can not explain both the hbos and the khz qpos sometimes seen together in z sources .",
    "instead , miller , lamb , & psaltis ( 1998 ) propose the sonic - point beat - frequency model , in which the disk is truncated by radiation drag from the ns which causes clumps of gas to lose energy and fall rapidly inward on spiral trajectories .",
    "this spiral pattern crashes onto the star to create x - ray hot spots which rotate at the frequency of the disk inner edge , generating the high frequency qpo .",
    "this flow is optically thin , which permits the radiation to exert its drag on the disk in the first place . at the same time",
    ", some gas is channeled by the ns magnetic field onto hot spots which rotate at the spin frequency of the star .",
    "these hot spots modulate the radiation drag , and thus the brightness of the first hot spots , at the frequency of the beat between the disk orbital and stellar spin frequencies , producing the second qpo .",
    "miller , lamb , & psaltis ( 1998 ) point out several predictions of this model as the inner edge of the disk , or `` sonic point , '' approaches the marginally stable orbit .",
    "first , the frequencies of the qpos should increase together up to a certain accretion rate , then remain constant .",
    "this is clearly seen in figure  [ fig - sa ] .",
    "second , after the marginally stable orbit is reached , the amplitudes of the qpos should decrease .",
    "this is because , as @xmath51 increases further , the optical depth between the sonic point and the ns surface will increase , lessening the radiation drag which produces the modulation in the first place .",
    "zhang et al . ( 1998 ) found that the fractional rms amplitudes of the qpos steadily decreased as the count rate increased until they disappeared altogether .",
    "thus we can envision the following scenario : in the island state the inner edge of the disk lies at a radius greater than @xmath117 , within which the sonic - point model is operating . the boundary layer is optically thick , producing blackbody radiation from a small equatorial region of the ns surface .",
    "the ns is surrounded by a hot cloud in the form of an accretion disk corona , since the optically thick boundary layer prevents an advection - dominated solution from existing in this case .",
    "the wien temperature and radius also indicate that the corona is supported by the disk .",
    "the electron scattering optical depth of the corona is low , and we may see the boundary layer emission .",
    "as @xmath51 increases the inner edge of the disk moves inward and the qpo frequencies increase .",
    "the optical depth of the corona increases and , as the boundary layer and disk emission increase , the corona is cooled and @xmath15 drops . the increased emission from the boundary layer does not make it out to the observer , as it goes into cooling the corona .",
    "the derived wien radius also indicates that the disk inner radius is shrinking .",
    "when the inner edge of the disk reaches the marginally stable orbit , the qpo frequencies cease rising .",
    "the disk has reached its maximum emitting area for cool photons , and so @xmath15 does not fall any more . further increasing",
    "the accretion rate causes the optical depth of both the corona and the spiraling gas clumps between the disk edge and the boundary layer to rise , reducing the radiation drag that ultimately generates the qpos .",
    "the qpo amplitude begins to decrease until , at the point when the boundary layer is completely obscured , they disappear altogether . at this point",
    "the cooler emission from the disk itself is all that can be seen from the outside , resulting in a lower observed @xmath12 and higher @xmath83 , as the boundary layer powers the optically thick , nearly thermal - looking comptonizing cloud .",
    "the ratio of bb to comptt flux is quite small at this point .",
    "the main problem with this picture is that the comptonizing corona is supported by the accretion disk , as indicated by the wien parameters ( figure  [ fig - wien ] ) , and yet its luminosity is always more than twice that of the bb component .",
    "if the boundary layer is being obscured by the corona , transferring energy from the soft to the hard component , then the seed temperature of the comptt model should start to reflect this .",
    "thus if the corona is supported by the disk this picture is not consistent with theoretical constraints on the ratio of the flux from the boundary layer and disk ( sunyaev & shakura 1986 ) .    our cpl + dbb model for 4u 1820 - 30",
    "may be interpreted in terms of a hot advective flow lying within the standard thin accretion disk if the boundary layer between this hot , optically thin flow and the ns may also be optically thin ( barret et al . 2000 ) .",
    "the scenario is fairly straight forward in this case . in the island state ,",
    "the inner disk radius is large and the temperature is low . between the disk and the ns the hot advective flow comptonizes soft photons from the disk and ns surface , producing the cpl component .",
    "as the disk lies outside the hot corona , it is clearly visible . as @xmath51 increases",
    ", the inner disk moves inward and its temperature increases , as shown in figure  [ fig - paramsdbb ] . as the disk area increases ,",
    "the ratio of dbb to cpl flux increases , as does the cooling of the hot flow , causing the cutoff energy to drop .",
    "the power law index falls as well , indicating an increase in @xmath16 .",
    "the qpos may be produced by the same sonic point model as before , and so their frequency increases . when the inner disk reaches the last stable orbit , the flux ratio , temperature , radius , optical depth , and cutoff energy reach constant values . as @xmath51 continues to rise , @xmath12 does appear to continue rising slowly as well .",
    "we may use the dbb parameters at the last stable orbit to estimate the mass of the ns , as described by ebisawa et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and shimura & takahara ( 1995 ) .",
    "as discussed in section  [ sec - fitting ] , @xmath101 must be corrected by a spectral hardening factor ; this effective radius is then set to the radius at which the disk temperature becomes a maximum , 5/3 the inner disk radius itself .",
    "then @xmath118 , where @xmath119 is the schwarzschild radius .",
    "the factor of 0.6 accounts for the decrease in @xmath57 due to relativistic effects . using @xmath120 from shimura & takahara ( 1995 ) and @xmath121 km from figure  [ fig - paramsdbb ] gives a ns mass of @xmath122 m@xmath8 .",
    "the ns mass may also be estimated by setting the maximum khz qpo frequency of @xmath123 hz equal to the keplerian frequency at the last stable orbit .",
    "this gives @xmath124 m@xmath8 for a non - rotating ns . for a ns spin frequency of 275 hz ( zhang et al .",
    "1998 ) the relativistic corrections are small .",
    "equating these two masses requires @xmath125 , which is nearly problematic due to the lack of dips from this source .",
    "should any dbb flux be lost due to scattering in the hot corona , however , the true value of @xmath101 and thus @xmath126 would appear reduced .",
    "appealing as this physical model is , it is inconsistent with the observational work of church et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , who find that x - ray dips in xrbs may be modeled by partial absorption of a large corona responsible for the hard x - ray emission .",
    "they estimate a diameter of @xmath127 cm for this corona , considerably larger than the @xmath128 km @xmath129 cm allowed from figure  [ fig - paramsdbb ] if the hot advective flow is to lie inside the accretion disk .",
    "tomsick , lapshov , & kaaret ( 1998 ) analyze a dip observed from the bh candidate 4u 1630 - 47 and find that the power law component of the spectrum is more highly absorbed , in contrast to the situation found by church et al .",
    "( 1998 ) for xrbs .",
    "thus a hot advective comptonizing flow lying within the accretion disk may be a good model for bh systems , but seems to present a geometry problem for xrbs .      as noted in section  [ sec - prevspec ] , 4u 1820 - 30",
    "does not belong to the class of xrbs detected at @xmath3 kev .",
    "our _ rxte _ observations confirm this , as the source is not detected above 50 kev even in the hardest state .",
    "extrapolating the island state spectrum from table  [ tab - fits2 ] into the batse energy range ( 20100 kev ) gives a hard x - ray luminosity of @xmath130 ergs  s@xmath23 , consistent with the upper limit of @xmath131 ergs  s@xmath23 found by batse ( bloser et al .",
    "the predicted flux at 100 kev in the island state is @xmath132 photons @xmath47 s@xmath43 kev@xmath43 . from figure",
    "[ fig - asm ] is is clear that the source spends only a small fraction of its duty cycle in the island state , making hard x - ray detection even less likely .",
    "barret , mcclintock , & grindlay ( 1996 ; see also barret et al .",
    "2000 ) have proposed that xrbs can only produce substantial hard x - ray emission when their soft x - ray ( 120 kev ) luminosity is below a critical value of @xmath133 ergs  s@xmath23 , and that this may be used to distinguish ns systems from bh systems .",
    "since the 120 kev luminosity of 4u 1820 - 30 never falls below @xmath134 ergs  s@xmath23 , even in the island state , our lack of detection of the source above 50 kev is consistent with this picture .",
    "we have studied the x - ray spectrum of 4u 1820 - 30 in all three states displayed by atoll sources , including the first observation in the island state since the _ exosat _ observation described by stella , white , & priedhorsky ( 1987 ) .",
    "the fact that the 176-day flux variation corresponds to normal motion in the ccd indicates that the long period is indeed due to modulation in the accretion rate .",
    "the spectra are well fit by the cpl + bb , comptt + bb , and cpl + dbb models , but the parameters of the comptt + bb and cpl + dbb models show more robust correlations with each other and with the frequencies of the khz qpos when plotted as a function of accretion rate ( as parameterized by @xmath1 ) . in the comptt + bb case , the relative contribution of the blackbody component decreases as the optical depth of the comptonizing cloud increases until both reach constant values at the same @xmath51 at which the qpos disappear .",
    "this can be understood in terms of simple geometrical arguments and the sonic - point beat - frequency qpo model of miller , lamb , & psaltis ( 1999 ) if the blackbody component emanates from an optically thick boundary layer and the hard comptonized component from an extended cloud ; however , the relative fluxes of the two components violate theoretical constraints . in the cpl + dbb case ,",
    "the behavior of the parameters for the inner accretion disk agree with expectations from the qpos , but the comptonizing corona must take the form of a hot advective flow within the standard thin disk ; observations of dipping xrbs suggest the corona is much larger than this .",
    "the questions raised by both models are central to the issue of hard x - ray production in ns systems . in either case",
    ", the saturation of qpo frequency at @xmath98 provides strong additional evidence for the detection of the marginally stable orbit in the accretion disk of 4u 1820 - 30 .",

    "<S> we find that the 176-day period corresponds to normal atoll source motion in the color - color diagram , indicating that the long period is due to mass accretion rate changes . </S>",

    "<S> we find that the inner disk radius reaches a minimum at the same accretion rate at which the khz qpo frequency saturates , as expected if the disk reaches the last stable orbit . </S>",
