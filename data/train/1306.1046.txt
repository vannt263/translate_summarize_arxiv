    "a grand challenge in the relativistic physics is to construct a self - consistent theory that is responsible for generation , acceleration , and collimation of the astrophysical jet .",
    "the stability of the relativistic plasma flow is of intrinsic importance in both the acceleration and collimation mechanisms of the jet .",
    "if the plasma flow propagating relativistically through the ambient medium is unstable to internal disturbances , it should be difficult to attain the remarkable persistency and velocity of the jet expected in compact object - accretion disk systems because of the nonlinear material mixing process caused by instabilities .",
    "the relativistic jet propagating through the ambient medium is subjected to a storm of instabilities .",
    "the shear layer , which develops spontaneously at the interface between the jet and the surrounding medium , can be destabilized by the kelvin - helmholtz instability @xcite .",
    "it has been investigated theoretically and numerically in the framework of the astrophysical jet @xcite , and is expected as a primary mechanism of the material mixing @xcite .",
    "in association with the magnetically driven mechanism for the jet - launching @xcite , the stability of the magnetized jet is one of the front line topics in relativistic physics .",
    "the poynting flux - dominated jets carrying large - scale helical magnetic fields can become unstable to the kink mode of the current - driven ( cd ) instability @xcite .    a pioneering numerical work done by @xcite investigated the cd kink instability for a static force - free equilibrium by three - dimensional ( 3d ) general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulation",
    "( see also baty & keppens 2002 for the case of non - relativistic mhd ) . however , it is still a matter of debate whether the cd kink instability is essential for the astrophysical jet because the 3d configuration and strength of the magnetic field , which are deeply related to the launching mechanism , are veiled in mystery .",
    "one of few works that studies the effect of the rayleigh - taylor instability ( rti ; * ? ? ?",

    "they performed 2.5 dimensional numerical simulations of two - component jet consisting of a fast inner spine and a slower outer flow .",
    "they found that the rotational shear that develops at the interfaces between the spine and sheath , and the sheath and ambient , plays a key role in triggering the rti in the two - component jet .",
    "the driving force of the rti is , in this case , the centrifugal force .    even without the rotation ,",

    ", the simulation is initiated .",
    "here , to aid understanding of our numerical results , we briefly describe the basic physics governing the radial jet oscillation , which naturally arises from the pressure difference between the jet and the external medium .",
    "see matsumoto et al .",
    "( 2012 ) for more detail of the radial oscillating motion of the jet in the axisymmetric model .    figure 1(a ) schematically depicts the traditional picture of the relativistic jet propagating through the ambient medium .",
    "the ambient medium is thermalized at the jet head during the jet propagation , and simultaneously forms a cocoon .",
    "this is the reason the jet is surrounded by the enveloped cocoon material .",
    "the transverse structures of the jet on cutting planes at @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are shown in panels ( b1)(b3 ) , respectively .",
    "the region enclosed by a red curve is the reconfinement region .",
    "the blue curve denotes the contact discontinuity that separates the jet from the surrounding medium .",
    "since the jet is initially overpressured in our model , it starts to expand adiabatically in the radial direction ( panel ( b1 ) ) .",
    "the adiabatic cooling leads to in - situ energy conversion between the thermal and bulk kinetic energies of the jet according to the relativistic bernoulli s principle ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "the gas pressure inside the jet thus becomes smaller than that of surroundings in the expansion phase .",
    "the expansion is then decelerated by the inward pressure - gradient force acting on the jet - surrounding medium interface , and is finally turned into the contraction ( panel ( b2 ) ) . in the subsequent phase , the pressure inside the jet increases with the contraction of the jet ( panel ( b3 ) ) . the jet restarts to expand radially when the gas pressure of the jet becomes larger than that of the surrounding medium .    during the radial oscillation of the jet , the reconfinement region enclosed by a shock surface",
    "is formed inside the jet @xcite . as shown in figure 1(a ) , the shock - shock collision at the center of the jet excites the outward - propagating shock .",
    "the collision between the shock and the contact discontinuity results in the contracting reconfinement shock .",
    "the transition between the outward- and inward - propagating shocks occurs repeatedly and shapes the reconfinement region .",
    "the radial pressure mismatch between the jet and surrounding medium assumed in our initial setting is a modeling to reproduce this radial jet oscillation already established in axisymmetric models @xcite .",
    "the restoring force of the jet oscillation , which is obviously the pressure gradient force acting on the jet - surrounding medium interface , might induce the rti when we consider the non - axisymmetric evolution of the jet .",
    "shown sequentially in figures 2(a)(f ) is the temporal evolution of the cross section of the jet for the fiducial model ( model a1 in table 1 ) .",
    "the snapshots ( a)(f ) represent the transverse distribution of the effective inertia @xmath32 at @xmath33 , and @xmath34 , respectively .",
    "figure 2(g ) shows the temporal evolution of the volume  averaged azimuthal velocity @xmath35 defined by , @xmath36 at the time corresponding to the snapshots ( a)(f ) .",
    "the development of the rti at the interface separating two fluids is controlled by the difference in the inertia of the fluid gases in the non - relativistic regime . in the relativistic regime where the internal energy of the gas is comparable to or greater than its rest mass energy and/or the fluid velocity is relativistic , the inertia of the fluid is enhanced by relativistic effects .",
    "the effective inertia @xmath32 is thus a good indicator for studying the gas dynamics , especially the stability .",
    "note that the effective inertia of the jet is larger than the external medium although the density of the jet is smaller than the external medium in the fiducial model .    in figure 2(a )",
    ", the inward - propagating reconfinement shock is formed behind the corrugated contact discontinuity that separates the jet and the external medium .",
    "one can find that the amplitude of the corrugated jet  external medium interface grows as time passes ( figures 2(a)(c ) ) .",
    "then a finger - like structure , which is a typical outcome of the rti , emerges in figure 2(c ) .",
    "the rti is induced by inward pressure gradient force .",
    "the convergence of the inward - propagating reconfinement shock produces an outward - spreading shock at the center of the jet . at the timing",
    "when the outward going shock collides with the contact discontinuity , the richtmeier - meshkov instability ( rmi ; * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is secondarily excited between rti fingers .",
    "see figure 2(d ) for the excitation of the rmi fingers that are marked by open circles ( this process can be clearly seen in the online animation ) .",
    "the evolution of the rmi - driven finger marked by the white circle in figure 2(d ) is tracked in figures 2(e ) and ( f ) .",
    "we stress that almost all finger - like structures in figure 2(f ) have their origin in the rmi .    during the radial oscillating motion of the jet , the two types of finger structures",
    "are amplified and repeatedly excited at the contact discontinuity , and finally deform the transverse structure of the jet .",
    "the fiducial model indicates that the transverse structure of the jet is dramatically deformed by a synergetic growth of the rti and rmi once the jet - external medium interface is corrugated in the case with the pressure - mismatched jet .",
    "the synergetic growth of the rti and rmi can be confirmed in figure 2(g ) .",
    "the volume - averaged azimuthal velocity @xmath35 increases exponentially until @xmath37 after @xmath38 .",
    "this is due to the rti that grows at the jet - external medium interface . at around the time @xmath39",
    "when the outgoing shock passes through the contact discontinuity , the evolution property of the @xmath40 is dramatically changed , linearly increasing in time .",
    "this is evidence of the excitation of the rmi because it is well - known that the perturbation amplitude grows linearly with time when the rmi develops ( richtmyer 1960 ; nishihara et al .",
    "after @xmath41 , the system enters into the nonlinear saturation stage .      the condition for the transverse structure of the jet being maintained is studied by varying two physical parameters that characterize the jet - external medium system .",
    "we focus on the initial effective inertia ratio between the jet and external medium , which is defined by @xmath42 and the initial specific enthalpy of the jet @xmath43 which is a good indicator whether the gas is relativistically hot .",
    "the model parameters surveyed for examining the jet stability are summarized in table 1 ( models a1d4 ) . with the same physical and computational settings except the parameters @xmath44 and @xmath45",
    ", we simulate various jet - external medium systems .    in the following",
    ", the `` unstable model '' corresponds to the model in which the transverse structure of the jet is deformed in the same way as the fiducial model .",
    "in contrast , the `` stable model '' means that the transverse structure of the jet is maintained . as an example of the stable model ,",
    "the temporal evolution of the @xmath35 for model a4 is demonstrated by a dashed line in figure 2(g ) .",
    "the rti and rmi are suppressed and the jet interface does not deform in the stable model .",
    "figure  [ phase_diagram ] presents the stability diagram for the transverse structure of the jet in the @xmath43 ",
    "@xmath44 parameter space .",
    "the vertical axis shows @xmath46 .",
    "the cross and open circle indicate the unstable and stable models , respectively .",
    "one finds that the stability criterion of the jet can be simply written as @xmath47 regardless of the specific enthalpy of the jet .",
    "the jet can maintain its transverse structure as long as the effective inertia of the jet is smaller than that of the ambient when excluding the destabilization effects by the kelvin - helmholtz mode .",
    "in this letter , the stability of the transverse structure of the non - rotating single - component relativistic jet was studied using srhd simulations .",
    "the nonlinear evolution of the non - axisymmetric perturbation in the two - dimensional @xmath21@xmath22 plane was highlighted by assuming a translational invariance along the jet axis .",
    "initial pressure mismatch between the jet and surrounding medium results in the radial oscillating motion of the jet .",
    "an intriguing finding in our study is that the inertia force , which acts as a restoring force of the radial oscillating motion , triggers the primary rti and the secondary rmi at the jet - external medium interface . the transverse structure of the jet is remarkably deformed by the nonlinear growth of these radial oscillation - induced instabilities .",
    "the condition for the transverse structure of the jet being maintained is written , regardless of the specific enthalpy of the jet , as @xmath48 , where @xmath0 is the effective inertia ratio of the jet to the external medium .",
    "this suggests that the inertia ratio between the jet and enveloped cocoon material is a critical parameterin a realistic situation , as illustrated in figure 1(a ) , to evaluate the stability of the relativistic jet to the oscillation - induced rti and rmi .",
    "the condition for the growth of the radial oscillation - induced rti is the same as that for the centrifugally driven rti found in @xcite .",
    "this simply indicates that a contact discontinuity separating two fluids with @xmath49 becomes unstable to the rti regardless of the origin of the driving force . unlike the rti",
    ", the growth of the rmi at the jet - surrounding medium interface has not been reported in @xcite and the other previous studies .",
    "the synergetic growth of the rti and rmi , which is a characteristic feature in our unstable model , enhances the deformation of the jet interface .",
    "the growth of the rmi is essentially due to the pressure - mismatched jet that is assumed in our initial setting .",
    "this induces the radial oscillating motion of the jet and , additionally , the rmi at the jet - surrounding medium interface .",
    "@xcite adopts the initial condition where the radial pressure balance is established in the calculation domain .",
    "this would be the main reason the rmi does not grow in their work .",
    "a lot of previous 2d axisymmetric studies suggest that the formation and oscillation of the reconfinement shock is a natural result of the jet propagation through the ambient medium and is a key to attain the remarkable collimation and persistency of the jet . however , an important message from our simulations is that the non - axisymmetric nature is essential for the stability of the relativistic jet to the oscillation - induced instabilities .",
    "they would have a great impact on the collimation and the acceleration of the three - dimensional jet propagating through ambient medium .",
    "the high - resolution realistic 3d simulation of the jet propagation is within the scope of our work and will be reported in our subsequent paper .",
    "we thank kazunari shibata , hiroyuki r. takahashi , and akira mizuta for thier useful discussions .",
    "numerical computations were carried out on cray xt4 and the general - purpose pc farm at the center for computational astrophysics , the national astronomical observatory of japan and on sr16000 at yitp at kyoto university .",
    "the evolution of the rti and rmi was simulated in this letter . to capture these instabilities , a numerical scheme capable of accurately resolving a contact discontinuity is required . in our simulations , we use a relativistic hllc scheme @xcite , which is a modification of the hll scheme @xcite by restoring the missing contact wave in the solution of the riemann problem . here",
    "we shed light on the ability of the hll and hllc schemes to simulate these instabilities using codes developed by @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "figure  [ hllc_vs_hll ] shows the temporal evolution of the cross section of the jet for the fiducial model ( model a1 in table 1 ) .",
    "the upper and lower panels place , in order of time , results obtained in models evolved by hllc and hll schemes , respectively .",
    "it is surprising that the rti and rmi fingers do not emerge in the model with hll scheme although the completely same initial settings and grid spacings ( @xmath50 zones in @xmath51  and @xmath52directions ) are adopted in both models . with our simulation codes",
    ", three times higher resolution is needed to capture the rti and rmi in the hll scheme than in the hllc scheme .",
