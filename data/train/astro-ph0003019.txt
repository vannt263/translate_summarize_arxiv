    "since the egret detection of about 60 blazars as strong @xmath1-ray emitters the study of these extreme objects has received a renewed interest .",
    "the overall spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of blazars shows two broad components , the first one peaking at ir - up to soft x - rays , the second one in the @xmath1-rays , from mev up to tev energies .",
    "the first peak is due to synchrotron radiation produced by relativistic electrons , while the high energy component is believed to be inverse compton scattered radiation .",
    "the seed photons for the ic scattering could be the synchrotron photons themselves ( ssc model ) or photons produced in the region external to the jet ( ec model ) which , especially for quasars with strong emission lines , is probably rich of optical - uv radiation .",
    "the subclass of quasar - like sources contains the most luminous sources , with apparent @xmath1-ray luminosity up to @xmath5 erg s@xmath6 .    in the following",
    "we present the @xmath0sax observations of three gamma - loud quasars ( 0836 + 710 , 2230 + 114 and 1510 - 089 ) , detected up to 100 kev with the high energy instrument pds , and we discuss the external compton scenario .",

    "@xmath70836 + 710 : this is a distant quasar ( @xmath8 ) , characterized by a very flat x - ray spectrum , observed with rosat and asca .",
    "the asca observation showed a column density greater than the galactic value ( cappi et al .",

    "the residuals show an excess at about 2 kev , that could be interpreted as the redshifted fluorescence iron line ( see fig 1 ) . adding a gaussian line with energy as a free parameter the fit converges to an energy of @xmath32 with an intrinsic equivalent width of @xmath33 ev ,",

    "electrons cool through the synchrotron and ic processes and are free to escape from the source at some velocity @xmath50 , forming a flat ( @xmath51 ) power - law below @xmath42 .",

    "@xmath7 it is interesting to note that the derived spectral indices in the medium to hard x - ray band are flatter than 0.5 in two out of three sources . a population of electrons cooling through synchrotron and ic forms a distribution which produce a spectrum with @xmath36 .",
    "therefore some additional mechanism is required in order to produce the observed flatter spectrum , e.g. escape or injection of an intrinsically flat distribution ( see e.g. ghisellini 1996 ) .",
    "@xmath7 we confirm the presence of absorption higher than the galactic one in 0836 + 710 .",
    "the origin of this absorption is likely intrinsic to the source .",
    "the fluorescence iron line suggested by our data could be produced through reprocessing by the same material responsible for the absorption .",
    "on the other hand a broken power - law continuum with galactic absorption can reproduce the data equally well : in this case the break could be due to the incomplete comptonization of the soft external photons ( see ghisellini 1996 ) ."
