    "the shock transition in fast astrophysical shocks is intrinsically a `` collisionless '' process , and energy is dissipated via plasma turbulence and/or electromagnetic fields .",
    "an important consequence of the collisionless nature of the shocks is cosmic ray acceleration ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "while there is increasing evidence of cosmic ray acceleration in supernova remnants , the details of the process are still not well understood , and the question of whether supernova remnants ( snrs ) are the primary acceleration sites of galactic cosmic rays is still open @xcite .",
    "cosmic ray acceleration models require a precursor in which accelerated particles can scatter back to the postshock region for further acceleration .",
    "observations of the cosmic ray precursor can constrain the two key parameters of acceleration models ; the diffusion coefficient and the injection efficiency @xcite .",
    "the balmer - dominated filaments that are produced when fast snr shocks propagate into partially neutral gas are potential sites where such a cosmic ray precursors can be observed .",
    "most of the balmer emission comes from a very narrow zone behind the shock , where the hydrogen atoms swept up by the shock are excited before they are ionized @xcite .",
    "however , in the presence of the precursor , additional balmer emission is expected from the precursor region where the preshock gas is compressed and heated . using long - slit h@xmath0  spectroscopy along the shock normal of a balmer filament in tycho s snr , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lee07 hereafter ) found that there is an increase of the h@xmath0  narrow component intensity in a small region ( @xmath2 ) ahead of the shock front , which they proposed as potential emission from the precursor .",
    "however , the angular resolution of the observation by lee07 is @xmath3 and their results needed to be verified with high resolution observations .    in this _ letter _ , we report h@xmath0  imaging observations of balmer - dominated filaments in tycho s snr using the wide field and planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) on the hubble space telescope ( hst ) , which resolves the detailed structure of the shock .",
    "  [ sec : observations ] presents the observations and reports the detection of the precursor .",
    "the precursor is modeled in   [ sec : model ] and its characteristics are discussed in   [ sec : analysis ] . finally in   [ sec : summary ] , we discuss the efficiency of cosmic ray acceleration in this region .",
    "[ fig : kpno - hst ]",
    "we observed the eastern limb of tycho s snr using wfpc2 on hst .",
    "the observations were conducted on mar 23 , 2008 , with the camera arranged to cover knot g , one of the brightest h@xmath0  filaments in the remnant ( @xmath4 , @xmath5=00@xmath6 25@xmath7 52@xmath8 , + 64@xmath9 09@xmath10 21@xmath11 ) .",
    "a total of 10 exposures , each with @xmath12 sec , were obtained using the f656n h@xmath0  filter , which has a central wavelength of 6564 .",
    "the filter has a bandwidth of 54    ( @xmath13 ) , which is comparable to the velocity width of the h@xmath0  broad component in this region @xcite , and transmits about half of the broad component flux .",
    "images are combined and `` drizzled '' onto a @xmath14 pixel@xmath15 scale using the iraf task _ multidrizzle _",
    "@xcite , which also detects and removes cosmic - rays .",
    "the psf of the final drizzled image has a fwhm of @xmath16 .",
    "the full field observed with hst is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : kpno - hst ] .",
    "the brightest filaments , comprising the knot g region and associated filaments , are seen on the wf3 chip , while fainter filaments belonging to the northeastern limb of the snr are visible on the wf4 chip .",
    "the superb angular resolution of hst reveals details of the filaments not available from ground - based telescopes .",
    "this is more clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : hst - kotg ] , where we compare the close - up view of the knot g region to the image observed with a ground - based telescope ( ccd image obtained at the kpno 2.1 m telescope on 2007 october 4 ) at the same scale .",
    "the hst image reveals a faint extension of the emission toward upstream ( to the east ) along most of the bright part of the filaments ( between @xmath17=64@xmath9 08@xmath10 40@xmath11 and @xmath17=64@xmath9 09@xmath10 20@xmath11 ) .",
    "this extension is more clearly demonstrated by the h@xmath0  brightness profiles from the cuts along the shock normals , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : profile - southe ] .",
    "the profiles show a bright emission peak of thickness @xmath18 , which is the emission from neutral hydrogen excited in the postshock area .",
    "the small bumps around offsets @xmath19 and @xmath20 are likely due to the projection of fainter tangencies of the rippled shock front to the line of sight .",
    "the h@xmath0  emission slowly falls off not only toward the downstream but also toward the upstream direction . in the downstream",
    ", the h@xmath0  emission is emitted within a very narrow region behind the shock as neutral hydrogen is rapidly ionized .",
    "thus , we consider that the downstream emission is likely a projection of the curved shock fronts",
    ". some of the upstream emission could be in principle attributed to a similar projection effect .",
    "however , fig .",
    "[ fig : hst - kotg ] shows that the shock front in this region does not show any significant curvature , and it is difficult to devise a shock geometry that explains both upstream and downstream emission .",
    "[ fig : simple - fit ] shows emission profiles along different cuts , and the upstream emission components are similarly seen .",
    "the upstream emission is also seen faintly in the profile of cut  01 where the shock surface is apparently convex ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : hst - kotg ] ) , and a projection effect is not likely to explain the upstream emission .",
    "therefore , we propose that the faint emission from the upstream region represents the emission mostly from the neutral hydrogen atoms excited in a shock precursor , and the effect of shock geometry makes only a minor contribution .",
    "to estimate the physical properties of the precursor , we model the observed spatial h@xmath0  emission profiles ( fig .",
    "[ fig : simple - fit ] ) .",
    "we first try a simple toy precursor model .",
    "we assume a shock front located at @xmath21 with increasing @xmath22 toward downstream .",
    "the h@xmath0  emission from the postshock region is assumed to be confined to a region of thickness of @xmath23 with a uniform emissivity . in the precursor ,",
    "the h@xmath0  emissivity peaks at the shock front and decreases exponentially away from the shock front .",
    "the profile is written as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the total h@xmath0  flux from the postshock region , @xmath26 is the precursor length scale , and @xmath27 is a flux ratio of the precursor to the postshock region . the variation in the downstream region could be modeled with a curved geometry of the shock . however , we find that the observed variation can not be adequately fit by shocks of a simple geometry . instead of introducing arbitrary fit parameters to describe the structure along the line of sight ,",
    "we simply assume plane - parallel shocks and ignore the data where the model deviates from the observation . as long as @xmath26 is sufficiently smaller than the local curvature radii of the shocks , the plane - parallel assumption will not significantly affect estimated precursor parameters . as evident from fig .",
    "[ fig : hst - kotg ] , the profiles require multiple shock components projected along the line of sight . to minimize the number of free parameters , we assume that shocks have the same profile shape , i.e. , parameters @xmath27 , @xmath26 and @xmath23",
    "are tied among multiple shocks for a given profile cut from fig .",
    "[ fig : hst - kotg ] .",
    "the model profiles are gaussian smoothed to account for the instrumental profile .",

    "fig : simple - fit ] , and the results are summarized in table  1 .",
    "we find that the h@xmath0  flux from the precursor region is comparable to that of the postshock area ( f @xmath37 ) , with @xmath26 around 1 , corresponding to @xmath38  cm at the assumed distance of 2.1 kpc to tycho @xcite . the thicknesses of the postshock emitting area are around @xmath39 .",
    "a relatively large @xmath26 of @xmath40 is found in cut  01 , but this is likely to be overestimated due to the much stronger local curvature of the shock in this region .",
    "we also note that , for profiles in cuts  02 and 03 , where the structure of the overlapping shocks is quite complex , the fitted precursor parameters are somewhat sensitive to the assumed baseline and also the number of shock components .",
    "these can cause @xmath41 systematic uncertainties on the fitted parameters .",
    "we now consider a more realistic precursor model that assumes an exponential temperature profile ( similar to the above toy model ) in the precursor .",
    "the model calculates the ionization of hydrogen atoms throughout the shock and the emissivity of h@xmath0  and ly@xmath42  lines .",
    "the radiative transfer of the ly@xmath42  line is computed using the monte carlo technique to account for the h@xmath0  enhancement by ly@xmath42-trapping .",
    "the model has been utilized by @xcite to interpret the result of lee07 .",
    "we adopt the parameters used in @xcite ; shock velocity of 2000 @xmath43 , preshock density of 1 @xmath44 , and the preshock neutral fraction of 0.85 .",
    "more details of the model and the input parameters can be found in @xcite .",
    "the extensive discussion of the detailed modeling and associated uncertainties is beyond the scope of this _ letter _ , and here we simply present a brief summary of the results . for cuts 02 , 03 , and 04 , we estimate peak temperatures in the precursor t@xmath45 k , and the precursor length scale @xmath46 cm . as in the toy model , a larger length scale is required for cut 01 .",
    "the estimated length scales of the precursor are generally larger than those estimated from the simple toy model .",
    "this is because the h@xmath0  emissivity is sensitive to the temperature , i.e. , the emissivity profile increases more rapidly than the temperature profile , thus effectively reducing the length scale .",
    "we note that the precursor parameters are in agreement with the results of @xcite , while the length scale is slightly larger .",
    "the existence of a thin precursor has been suggested from previous observations .",
    "the spectral profiles of the h@xmath0  narrow component traces the velocity distribution of the gas entering the shocks , and those observed in snrs have widths of 40  60 @xmath43  .",
    "this is too large for the temperature of the ambient gas , as all the hydrogen would have been ionized at the implied temperature and no balmer filament should exist .",
    "instead , the observed line width is suggested to represent the gas heated in the precursor , which is thin enough for the preshock neutrals not to be completely ionized . also , the observed flux ratio of the h@xmath0  broad component and the narrow component was sometimes found to be smaller than what models predict ( e.g , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the excessive narrow component emission was attributed to the contribution of emission from the precursor @xcite .",
    "the characteristics of the precursor revealed by our hst observations are consistent with results from previous observations .",
    "the peak temperature in the precursor may be relatively higher than the temperature implied by the line width of the h@xmath0  narrow component .",
    "however , the temperature we modeled is the electron temperature , which might not be in equilibrium with the neutral hydrogen atoms .",
    "also , the velocity profiles of the h@xmath0  emission could deviate from a gaussian profile @xcite , and a simple line width may not be an adequate temperature indicator .",
    "our observations show that the emission from the precursor is a significant contributor to the h@xmath0  narrow component .",
    "we estimate that the precursor emission may contribute up to 30 - 40% of the narrow component for a slit width of @xmath47 .",
    "the narrow component emission from the precursor will affect estimates of electron - ion equilibration based on the observed broad - to - narrow intensity ratio @xcite .",
    "for those snrs where the observed h@xmath0  broad - to - narrow flux ratio was smaller than the model predictions , accounting for the precursor could bring them into agreement .",
    "the likely candidates for producing this precursor are a cosmic ray precursor or a fast neutral precursor @xcite .",
    "while our hst results provide detailed structure of the precursor , models of these precursors are not available for a quantitative comparison . however , the cosmic ray precursor scenario has been preferred over the fast neutral precursor for various reasons ( see lee07 and references therein ) .",
    "also , the growing evidence of cosmic ray acceleration in tycho s snr supports the existence of cosmic ray precursor ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite computed a series of time dependent numerical simulations of cosmic ray modified shocks , tuning the model parameters to reproduce the precursor characteristics of lee07 .",
    "the results of @xcite can be a plausible approximation as the estimated precursor properties are not much different .",
    "they found that , assuming a distance of 2.1 kpc to tycho s snr , the cr diffusion coefficient , @xmath48 , the injection parameter , @xmath49 , and the timescale for the energy transfer , @xmath50 , of @xmath51 @xmath52 s@xmath15 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 yr is required to describe the observations .",
    "the length scales of the precursor estimated from our new observation are slightly larger than that of lee07 .",
    "the larger precursor length scale requires a larger cosmic ray diffusion coefficient .",
    "this increases the acceleration time scale , so the cosmic ray injection parameter may need to be increased to compensate for the slower acceleration .",
    "while some fine tuning of the parameters may be required , we believe that @xcite s findings , e.g. , that the cosmic ray acceleration is not very efficient in this shock and about 10% of the shock energy has converted to cosmic rays , are still valid .",
    "the existence of the cosmic ray precursor does not necessarily imply efficient cosmic ray acceleration . for the balmer - dominated filaments to be observable , some neutral hydrogen needs to survive ionization in the precursor . as efficient cosmic ray acceleration tends to make the precursor wider and hotter",
    ", the balmer - dominated filaments may not trace the shocks having efficient cosmic ray acceleration ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "for the shock studied in this paper , a more direct suggestion of inefficient acceleration can be inferred from the results of lee07 . from the difference in radial velocity of the preshock gas and the h@xmath0  narrow component emitted in the postshock region , they estimated the amount of gas deceleration in the precursor .",
    "the preshock gas is decelerated in the precursor due to the gradient of the cosmic ray pressure by about a few hundred @xmath43  based on the radial velocity measurements .",
    "the value is not sensitive to the assumed distance , and is significantly smaller than the measured line width of the broad component . in this shock ,",
    "the thermal pressure of the ordinary gas still dominates over the cosmic ray pressure and the acceleration is not likely to be very efficient .    throughout the discussion",
    ", we have assumed that the distance to tycho s snr is 2.1 kpc .",
    "the measurement is based on the estimated proton temperature ( from the observed line width of the broad component ) and the optical proper motion , assuming no cosmic ray acceleration at the shock . the cosmic ray acceleration ,",
    "if significant , can effectively reduce the postshock temperature ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) ; thus the distance may have been underestimated .",
    "however , as has been discussed above , the optical observations are consistent with cosmic ray acceleration not being very efficient in this region , so the distance of 2.1 kpc , derived assuming no cosmic ray acceleration , remains a reasonable value .    using chandra observations",
    ", @xcite found the locations of the shock front ( sf ) and the contact discontinuity ( cd ) along the boundary of the remnant .",
    "they interpreted the small separation between the two as an indication of efficient cosmic ray acceleration .",
    "the region of knot g is one of the regions where the sf - cd separation is smallest ( except those regions of ejecta protrusion ) .",
    "a simple extrapolation of their argument will lead to the most efficient cosmic ray acceleration in this region , being inconsistent with our results .",
    "however , the region around knot g is where the remnant could be interacting with dense ambient clouds @xcite .",
    "thus , the small sf - cd separation in this region could be due to a recent encounter of the shock with the dense ambient gas , instead of efficient cosmic ray acceleration .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have presented high resolution h@xmath0  imaging observations of tycho , revealing the existence of a thin precursor which we interpret as a cosmic ray precursor . while the current observation is consistent with inefficient acceleration , the observation of the precursor itself provides an important opportunity to constrain the key parameters of the acceleration , such as the diffusion coefficient and the injection parameters .",
    "a comparison with detailed numerical simulations will be critical to study the detailed physics of cosmic ray acceleration ."
