    "the last two processes are kinematically possible because of the dispersion relations of electromagnetic excitations in a plasma which differ significantly from the vacuum dispersion .",

    "@xcite are not only opened kinematically but also become substantial .    due to a very weak interaction of axions with a matter ( the latest astrophysical data yield @xmath25  gev  @xcite ) , the processes with axion emission could be of great importance in astrophysics as an additional source of star energy losses   is obtained from the requirement that stars not lose too much energy by axions . ] . in the studies of processes occurring inside astrophysical objects ,",
    "one has to take into account the influence of both components of the active medium  a plasma and a magnetic field .",
