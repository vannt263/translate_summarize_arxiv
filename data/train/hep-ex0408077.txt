    "the quark mixing parameters in the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix are fundamental constants that must be determined from experiments .",
    "semileptonic @xmath7 meson decays are of great physics interest because they are relatively simple to handle theoretically .",
    "the decay matrix for semileptonic @xmath7 meson decay decouples into a weak current ( describing the @xmath8 vertex ) , and a strong current ( for the @xmath9 vertex ) that is parameterized through form - factor functions of the invariant mass ( @xmath10 ) of the @xmath11 exchanged .",
    "the form factors can not be easily computed in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) since they are affected by significant nonperturbative contributions .",
    "that is the main source of uncertainty in the extraction of the ckm matrix element from the simple decay processes .",
    "precise experimental measurements are needed to guide theoretical progress in this area .",
    "charm semileptonic decays allow measurements of the form factors and ckm matrix elements @xmath12 and @xmath13 . using heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) or lattice gauge techniques ,",
    "the measured charm form factors can be related to those needed to interpret @xmath14 transition and the measurement of the ckm matrix element @xmath15 .",
    "while measurements of form factors in all charm exclusive semileptonic decays are important , those in pseudoscalar - to - pseudoscalar transitions are the easiest to perform .",
    "the differential decay rate for the exclusive semileptonic decay @xmath16 ( @xmath17 stands for a pseudoscalar meson ) with the electron mass effects neglected can be expressed as  @xcite : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the fermi coupling constant , @xmath20 is the four - momentum transfer squared between the parent @xmath7 meson and the final state meson , @xmath21 is the momentum of the pseudoscalar meson in the @xmath7 rest frame , and @xmath22 is the relevant ckm matrix element , either @xmath23 or @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath25 is the form factor that measures the probability that the flavor changed quark @xmath26 and the spectator quark @xmath27 in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] will form a meson in the final state .",
    "the corresponding branching fractions can be obtained from @xmath28    = 0.6",
    "the data sample used in this analysis was produced at the @xmath1 resonance with the cornell electron storage ring ( cesr ) and collected with the general purpose cleo - c detector  @xcite .",
    "the total integrated luminosity of this data set is 60 pb@xmath0 .",
    "the cleo - c tracking system covers about 95% of the 4@xmath29 solid angle with a large cylindrical drift chamber and an all stereo wire vertex chamber .",
    "these tracking devices also provide specific - ionization ( @xmath30 ) measurements for particle identification .",
    "the electromagnetic calorimeter is made of 7800 cesium iodide crystals with a total solid - angle coverage of 95% of 4@xmath29 .",
    "the calorimeter is crucial for electron identification and provides excellent efficiency and energy resolution for photons , yielding a typical mass resolution for @xmath31 reconstruction around 6 mev/@xmath32 ( standard deviation ) .",
    "the ring imaging cherenkov ( rich ) detector covers 80% of the 4@xmath29 solid angle and provides superb particle identification capability .",
    "for this analysis we take full advantage of the unique kinematics of @xmath33 production at the @xmath1 resonance , just above charm threshold .",
    "we first select events in which a @xmath34 meson is fully reconstructed in one of the nine hadronic final states : @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 .",
    "charge conjugation is implied here and throughout this paper . within these tagged events we select the subset in which the @xmath44 meson decayed semileptonically to a specific final state .",
    "the efficiency - corrected ratio of the event yields gives the absolute branching fraction for the exclusive semileptonic decay mode .",
    "this branching fraction is independent of the luminosity of the experiment and benefits from the cancellation of many systematic uncertainties .",
    "this selection procedure provides an exceptionally clean sample of semileptonic decays that is ideal for determination of form - factor parameters and ckm elements , although our current data sample is not yet adequate for these determinations .",
    "full details of the hadronic event reconstruction and tag selection can be found in a separate paper  @xcite .",
    "the selection is based on two variables .",
    "@xmath45 is the difference between the beam energy and the energy of the fully reconstructed @xmath34 candidate .",
    "@xmath46 is the beam - constrained mass of the @xmath34 candidate , which is defined as @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the beam energy and @xmath49 is the measured momentum of the @xmath34 candidate",
    ". fits to the beam - constrained mass distributions for @xmath34 candidates are shown in fig .",
    "[ md0bc1 ] .",
    "multiple combinations have been eliminated by selecting the candidate with the minimum value of @xmath50 .",
    "the signal component in these fits consists of a gaussian and a bifurcated gaussian , which is found to adequately describe initial - state radiation ( isr ) .",
    "the background component in these fits is presented by an argus function  @xcite .",
    "the tag yields and efficiencies for selecting tags are given in table  [ table ] .",
    "our results for @xmath51 and @xmath52 are consistent with those from the pdg  @xcite .",
    "our @xmath53 result is lower than that from the pdg  @xcite .",
    "the ratio @xmath54 is closer to the cleo iii result  @xcite of @xmath55 , while lower than the pdg value  @xcite .",
    "the improved precision in these branching fractions is consistent with the expected performance of cleo - c with initial data sample of 60 pb@xmath0 at the @xmath1 .",
    "the full integrated luminosity of @xmath563 fb@xmath0 can be expected to provide great improvement in our knowledge of a much larger set of @xmath34 and @xmath57 exclusive semileptonic branching fractions as well as decay form factors and the ckm matrix elements @xmath23 and @xmath24  @xcite .",
