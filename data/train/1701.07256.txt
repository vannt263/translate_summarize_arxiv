    "<S> magnetic skyrmions can be considered as topologically protected quasiparticles . due to their stability , their small size , and the possibility to move them by low electric currents they are promising candidates for spintronic devices . leaving the topological protection untouched , </S>",
    "<S> it is possible to create skyrmion - antiskyrmion pairs , as long as the total skyrmion number remains unchanged . </S>",
    "<S> we derive a skyrmion equation of motion which reveals how spin - polarized charge currents create skyrmion - antiskyrmion pairs . </S>",
    "<S> it allows to identify general prerequisites for the pair creation process . </S>",
    "<S> we corroborate these general principles by numerical simulations . on a lattice , where topological protection becomes imperfect , </S>",
    "<S> the antiskyrmion partner of the pairs is annihilated and only the skyrmion survives . </S>",
    "<S> this eventually changes the total skyrmion number and yields a new way of creating and controlling skyrmions .    </S>",
    "<S> magnetic skyrmions ( sks ) are vortex - like localized magnetization configurations @xcite which have been predicted @xcite before they were discovered experimentally @xcite in magnetic layers with a strong spin - orbit interaction @xcite . despite their size being much smaller @xcite than , for example , </S>",
    "<S> that of topologically trivial magnetic bubbles , their thermodynamic stability is amazing @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is a consequence of the particular magnetic configuration which can be characterized by a topological sk number @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> it can take integer values only and therefore can not be changed continuously @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this feature protects magnetic sks against typical drawbacks of solid state systems such as disorder or imperfect fabrication @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> together with the property of easy repositioning by rather tiny in - plane electrical currents @xcite , this makes diluted sks attractive candidates for future racetrack memory devices @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> creation of sks has been reported in the vicinity of notches @xcite or by sweeping the back ground magnetic field @xcite . controlled creation and annihilation of individual sks has been demonstrated @xcite . with in - plane electrical currents @xcite the density of sks adjusts to the respective equilibrium value when , </S>",
    "<S> for example , the strength of the externally applied zeeman magnetic field is varied in time . </S>",
    "<S> this process must overcome topological stability . </S>",
    "<S> the precise mechanism of sk creation remained , however , unexplored .    in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we derive a sk equation of motion which reveals the details of the process how sk - numbers @xmath0 change by an applied in - plane current . </S>",
    "<S> we find this to happen in three steps . </S>",
    "<S> first , a skyrmion - antiskyrmion ( sk - ask ) pair is created @xcite , triggered by small spatial fluctuations of the magnetization . </S>",
    "<S> pair creation does not change the total sk - number @xmath0 , since the sk and the ask have non - zero equal @xmath0 of opposite sign , respectively . then , in a second step , sk and ask get spatially separated by the dynamics we describe below . </S>",
    "<S> the sk equation of motion reveals the relevant terms at work which are not captured by the common thiele approximation @xcite . finally , </S>",
    "<S> the ask , being no stable solution for a given zeeman- and dzyaloshinsky - moriya interaction strength , decays due to gilbert damping . </S>",
    "<S> it is this last dissipative step which is ultimately responsible for changing @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> all general findings are confirmed by extended numerical simulations .    </S>",
    "<S> the two - dimensional magnetization configuration @xmath1 of a single current - driven sk evolves in time according to the landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( llg ) equation @xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a normalized vector field . </S>",
    "<S> all interactions of the hamiltonian @xmath4 describing the system are contained in the effective field @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> below , in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ latticemodel ] ) , we specify the hamiltonian for a lattice model , but its detailed form is not relevant for the following consideration . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath6 already contains the gyromagnetic ratio and we set @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> further important parameters are the gilbert damping constant @xmath8 and the non - adiabaticity parameter @xmath9 . in this work </S>",
    "<S> , we focus specifically on the impact of spin - polarized electronic currents @xmath10 @xcite flowing homogeneously in space and time in the magnetic plane with spin polarization @xmath11 and lattice constant @xmath12 , proportional to an electronic charge current density @xmath13 . with the vector field @xmath14 </S>",
    "<S> , we then define the sk density @xmath15\\;,\\ ] ] and the spatial integral which yields the quantized skyrmion number @xmath16 in fact , this homotopy invariant completely characterizes sks and is the degree of the vector field @xmath17 @xcite . for convenience , we take the direction of the spin current @xmath18 as reference direction , @xmath19 and @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> while the topological invariant @xmath0 is conserved in time at low energies , the time evolution of @xmath21 describes the current - induced local motion of sks . in particular , </S>",
    "<S> as discussed below , it also describes the generation or annihilation of sk - ask pairs .    to reveal the sk - ask pair creation mechanism , </S>",
    "<S> we decompose the effective field according to @xmath22 by combining eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq::llg ] ) , ( [ eq::qxyt ] ) and ( [ eq::basis ] ) , we readily obtain the sk equation of motion @xmath23 with the sk currents    [ eq::jsk ] @xmath24\\mathbf v_s\\label{eq::jskd1}\\\\ & \\qquad-[{\\ensuremath { ( \\hat{\\mathbf v } \\cdot\\nabla){\\ensuremath{\\mathbf </S>",

    "<S> we note , however , that conservation of @xmath0 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq::q ] ) in the present case is not a consequence of noether s theorem , albeit conserved quantities may still exist for eq .   </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq::eom ] ) @xcite under continuous variation of @xmath29 @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the physical meaning of @xmath30 and @xmath31 becomes apparent when we consider sk in the steady state where @xmath32 and thus @xmath33 . for not too large current densities , no major structural changes of the magnetization </S>",
    "<S> occur and @xmath6 remains parallel to @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> then , the perpendicular components @xmath34 vanish and the coefficients @xmath35 and @xmath36 in eq .   </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq::jsk_coeff ] ) are constant . </S>",
    "<S> a case of special importance occurs when @xmath37 , which implies that @xmath38 , @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> then , @xmath40 , such that the undistorted sk density @xmath28 moves with the velocity @xmath41 , according to eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq::jskt ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this motivates to call @xmath30 a sk current density . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath42 ( but still assuming @xmath43 ) , @xmath36 becomes nonzero . </S>",
    "<S> then , we may rewrite eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq::jskd1],[eq::jskd2 ] ) in the form @xmath44 , with the coefficients @xmath45 and @xmath46 ^ 2/q$ ] . </S>",
    "<S> we can simplify @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the angle between @xmath49 and @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> this term @xmath51 only adds to the contribution of @xmath30 ( though with a different dependence on @xmath8 , @xmath9 , as well as on the shape of the vector field @xmath29 ) to drive sk density and ask density along @xmath52 depending on the explicit angle @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> + crucial for the following is the term @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> first , it points perpendicularly to the externally applied spin current and , second , it drives sk- and ask - densities in opposite directions , as it changes sign under the inversion @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore identify the contribution  ( [ eq::jskd2 ] ) as being responsible for separating the sk from the ask density resulting in a common sk - ask pair . </S>",
    "<S> the separation takes place perpendicularly to the external current . </S>",
    "<S> actually , this process can be expected to be a common scenario in real materials for sufficiently strong applied charge current densities . </S>",
    "<S> the only further prerequisites are @xmath55 and small spatial fluctuations of the sk density @xmath21 , which also imply finite gradients @xmath49 and @xmath50 and thus a finite @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> a finite gradient @xmath50 is , strictly speaking , not necessary for a non - vanishing current @xmath31 [ cf . </S>",
    "<S> eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq::jskd2 ] ) ] . nevertheless , it is important for a finite divergence @xmath56 . only in this case , the skyrmion current can not be gauged away and is physically relevant . </S>",
    "<S> having such a current means that regions of negative and positive sk density @xmath21 are separated . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , regions of opposite signs appear quite naturally in the topologically trivial state @xmath57 , as regions of finite @xmath28 , which we have postulated , have to cancel each other to sum up to zero . ultimately , a sk - ask pair is formed out of these fluctuations when this is energetically favorable . </S>",
    "<S> we note in passing that the detailed motion of asks is typically more complicated than that of sks , since commonly , an isolated ask is not a stationary solution and thus , already for @xmath58 , @xmath6 is clearly not parallel to @xmath29 , which implies that @xmath59 .        in the following , we illustrate these general principles for a concrete model realized by the hamiltonian @xcite @xmath60\\nonumber\\\\ & -\\sum_{{\\ensuremath{\\mathbf r}}}\\mathbf b_{\\mathbf r}\\cdot{\\ensuremath{\\mathbf n_{\\mathbf r}}}\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] defined on lattice sites @xmath61 ( unit lattice constant ) in two dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> it supports diluted sks within certain ranges of the parameters . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath62 is the exchange interaction and @xmath63 the dzyaloshinsky - moriya interaction ( dmi ) strength . </S>",
    "<S> we use the values @xmath64 , @xmath65 reported for mnsi @xcite . here , we only discuss a bulk dmi which stabilizes bloch sks . </S>",
    "<S> yet , we have also verified our findings for systems with an interfacial dmi which stabilizes nel sks @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> no qualitative modifications occur and our findings thus apply to both kinds of sks . in the numerical simulations , we use a @xmath66 square lattice with periodic boundary conditions . </S>",
    "<S> depending on the magnitude of the externally controlled zeeman - field @xmath67 , either a helical phase , a sk lattice or the ferromagnetic ( field polarized ) phase is the ground state @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a field @xmath68 is in fact strong enough to align all magnetic moments , @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> then , @xmath21 remains zero everywhere and , according to eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq::eom ] ) and ( [ eq::jsk ] ) , for all times , since @xmath70 , even at non - zero applied current densities .    to realize at least a small initial non - zero sk density @xmath28 , we add a tiny modulation to the magnetic field pointing in the @xmath71-direction , i.e. , @xmath72 $ ] and @xmath73 . as a matter of fact , the precise form of the initial inhomogeneous magnetization configuration is of minor importance . </S>",
    "<S> the time evolution of the system is calculated by solving the llg eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq::llg ] ) by standard advanced numerical methods .    </S>",
    "<S> starting from the fully field polarized state @xmath74 , we first let the system accommodate to the additional @xmath75 field , at zero external current . </S>",
    "<S> after this initial equilibration , we switch on the current at @xmath76 and calculate @xmath21 at every time step . </S>",
    "<S> a movie of this evolution is available in the sm @xcite while a selection of snapshots of @xmath28 is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig::snapshots ] . </S>",
    "<S> initially , the very small amplitude @xmath77 of @xmath75 generates a tiny seed sk density of both , positive and negative sign with an overall @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> gradually , under the influence of the external current , sk - ask pairs begin to form with growing magnitudes of @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> consistent with our theoretical prediction , the sk and ask centers separate in the @xmath71-direction , perpendicular to the external current flow . after its full development , since it is unstable , the ask disappears on a time scale @xmath78 . </S>",
    "<S> thereby its diameter shrinks relatively quickly , eventually below the lattice constant . at this moment , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath79 abruptly changes by one .    </S>",
    "<S> ( color online ) . </S>",
    "<S> black solid line : time - dependence of the total sk number @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> black dashed line : time - dependence of the total ask number defined as @xmath80 stemming from negative sk densities only . </S>",
    "<S> note that @xmath81 does not need to be integer and that the restriction to lattice points imposes some small , unimportant ambiguity on the precise determination of @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> red dashed line : time - dependence of the energy in reference to the initial energy , @xmath82 , per lattice site . before every @xmath0-jump </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath81 gradually increases , accompanied by an increase of the energy which eventually is taken from the external current . ]    </S>",
    "<S> this scenario is demonstrated further in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig::q_vs_t ] , where we show the time - dependence of @xmath79 . over large time spans , the total sk number ( black line ) takes integer values , while occasionally @xmath79 jumps to the next integer within a short ( but on the graph resolvable ) transition time . </S>",
    "<S> these transitions are accompanied by sudden rises of the total ask number @xmath80 , a quantity that we define by integrating over negative sk - density only . during the times when @xmath79 stays integer , @xmath83 may decrease gradually with time . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates the gradual creation of sk - ask pairs , their growth and their spatial separation , before the finally isolated , but unstable ask annihilates during a time much shorter than the duration of its creation , as described above . </S>",
    "<S> this initial gradual development of the first sk - ask pair due to a weak spatial inhomogeneity of the zeeman - field is clearly seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig::q_vs_t ] . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> as soon as a finite number of sks exist ( after 6300 ps in fig .  [ fig::q_vs_t ] ) </S>",
    "<S> , their intrinsic inhomogeneous magnetization suffices to facilitate further creation of sk - ask pairs in their surroundings , then even at a homogeneous zeeman - field as we have convinced ourselves independently .    </S>",
    "<S> since the system starts very close to the ferromagnetic ground state , the sk creation costs energy . </S>",
    "<S> this energy is pumped into the system by the charge current . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig::q_vs_t ] confirms the connection between the increase of the energy and of negative sk - density . </S>",
    "<S> the evolution of sk - ask pairs is overshadowed by the relatively short life time of the ask . </S>",
    "<S> the details of this process are further illustrated by an additional movie @xcite where we set the dmi to zero . </S>",
    "<S> then , neither the sk nor the ask is energetically preferred and the full sk - ask pair evolves in time .            the duration for sk creation can be quantified by the time @xmath84 which we define as the time span from the onset of the current flow till the creation of the first sk . </S>",
    "<S> since the ask annihilation is comparably fast , it is sufficient to define @xmath84 by the condition @xmath85 . </S>",
    "<S> this creation time is a combination of the time @xmath86 needed to form a sufficiently large sk - ask pair and the annihilation time @xmath87 of the ask . </S>",
    "<S> since both processes happen at least partially simultaneously , the resulting @xmath84 is not a direct sum of both . </S>",
    "<S> still , @xmath88 such that we can safely take @xmath89 . </S>",
    "<S> since we attribute the creation of sk - ask pairs to the existence of a finite @xmath31 , we expect sks to be created faster when the magnitude of @xmath31 is larger . from eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq::jskd1],[eq::jskd2],[eq::jd ] ) we find @xmath90 in the limit of vanishing @xmath91 and @xmath92 . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig::tau ] , this relation between @xmath84 and @xmath31 is confirmed by the numerical results . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , @xmath84 depends on @xmath93 and @xmath94 . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , no sks can be created when @xmath37 which implies that the dissipative current is essential for the charge current - induced sk creation . finally , we note that even though we have chosen a particular seed magnetic field @xmath95 to create sk density fluctuations , their precise origin is not important . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , only an inhomogeneous @xmath96 , besides @xmath42 and @xmath97 , is necessary for @xmath31 to become non - vanishing . </S>",
    "<S> thus , a multitude of ways are eligible to create such fluctuations , for example by local fields , material modification , or by temperature . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , a change of @xmath0 will often be undesirable in distinct set - ups . </S>",
    "<S> then , @xmath31-contributions to eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq::jsk ] ) should be suppressed by a proper choice of the material with a small @xmath93 , or by avoiding magnetization fluctuations , apart from simply working in the low current regime .    in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we have established the skyrmion equation of motion by combining the general definition of the skyrmion density and the landau - lifshitz - gilbert equation . </S>",
    "<S> we here define `` skyrmion current densities '' that conserve the total skyrmion number of a sample . in the presence of in plane </S>",
    "<S> spin current densities , we identify terms that give rise to simple movement of skyrmions against the externally applied charge flow . other contributions to skyrmion current densities that we identify </S>",
    "<S> explicitly drive the separation of positive skyrmion density from negative antiskyrmion density perpendicularly to the charge current flow . </S>",
    "<S> these latter contributions eventually cause the creation of skyrmion - antiskyrmion pairs , already out of very small magnetic inhomogeneities . </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical predictions are corroborated by numerical simulations and applied to systems with bulk and interfacial dmi .    </S>",
