    "the simplest quantitative characteristic of an interface is its width , or roughness , @xmath5 , defined as the rms fluctuation of the height around its average position .",
    "the scaling of the average width of different realizations with the length @xmath6 and the time @xmath7 is useful for analyzing interfaces formed in several processes  @xcite .",
    "another potentially useful characteristic is the full roughness distribution at the steady state , particularly in cases where reliable estimates of scaling exponents are not available .    the distributions for linear growth models , such as the edwards - wilkinson ( ew ) and the mullins - herring ( mh ) equations , were obtained exactly in @xmath2 and can be computed with high degree of accuracy in @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "the generating functions for gaussian interfaces with power spectrum of the type @xmath4 were computed by the same methods  @xcite .",
    "however , many real interfaces are described by nonlinear equations at a coarse - grained level , and their scaling exponents and roughness distributions are exactly known only in some particular cases . consequently , their accurate numerical calculation may provide a basis for comparison with results from experiments or model systems . in this brief report",
    ", we will study numerically the distributions of models governed by second and fourth order nonlinear growth equations , in @xmath2 and @xmath0 .",
    "the first model is that of kardar , parisi and zhang ( kpz )  @xcite , in which the local height @xmath8 at position @xmath9 and time @xmath7 evolves as @xmath10 here , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are constants and @xmath13 is a gaussian noise with zero mean and variance @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the dimension of the substrate . in the case",
    "@xmath16 , we obtain the ew equation .",

    "alternatively , one may use the scaling form @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the rms deviation of the squared width .    for kpz in @xmath2 , these scaling relations",
    "are analytically predicted and confirmed by numerical data  @xcite . in @xmath0",
    ", simulations of discrete models showed agreement with the scaling relation ( [ scaling2 ] )  @xcite , but the shape of the scaling function was not analyzed in detail . here , we will calculate accurate roughness distributions for three discrete models in @xmath0 : the etching model of mello et al  @xcite , the restricted solid - on - solid ( rsos ) model of kim and kosterlitz  @xcite and a generalized rsos model with maximum neighboring heights difference @xmath26  @xcite , hereafter called rsos2 .",
    "their analysis is presented in sec .",
    "roughness distributions of the vlds class were previously obtained by rcz and plischke  @xcite , who simulated a model with arrhenius dynamics in @xmath0 . in order to analyze the shapes of the vlds distributions , both in @xmath2 and @xmath0 ,",

    "( [ scaling1 ] ) , with @xmath28 .",
    "results for other system sizes confirm the expected scaling of fig .",
    "1 . the number of configurations in which @xmath29 was measured was near @xmath30 for each model and periodic boundary conditions were adopted .",
    "( [ scaling2 ] ) and ( [ scaling1 ] ) are equivalent , but the latter was used because it provides much better data collapse for the kpz models",
    ".     scaled roughness distributions ( according to eq .",
    "[ scaling1 ] ) at the steady states of the models : rsos in @xmath31 ( solid line ) , etching in @xmath31 ( squares ) and rsos2 in @xmath32 ( triangles ) . ]    quantitative information on the shape of the kpz distribution can be obtained from the dimensionless ratios of the moments of the roughness distribution @xmath33 .",
    "the ratios obtained with better accuracy involve the lowest - order moments : the skewness @xmath34 and the kurtosis @xmath35 .",
    "although these quantities do not characterize the whole distribution , they may be useful for the comparison with data from experiments or other model systems if data collapse methods are unreliable .",
    "the finite - size estimates of @xmath36 and @xmath37 for the distributions of the rsos and the etching models are shown in figs .",
    "2a and 2b .",
    "their asymptotic estimates are @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "these large values show that the roughness distribution strongly deviate from a gaussian near the maximum . for @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the abscissa of the maximum of the distribution in fig .",
    "1 , the curve has an approximately gaussian shape centered at @xmath41 .",
    "however , for @xmath42 , it significantly deviates from a gaussian , showing a much slower decay .",

    "1 is not a straight line , contrary to what is observed in the @xmath43-dimensional kpz model .",
    "this is certainly related to the non - gaussian behavior of the kpz interface in @xmath27 dimensions  @xcite .",

    "one question that could be raised here is the possibility of fitting the kpz distributions by those of @xmath4 signals  @xcite .",
    "however , the plots of the distributions for several values of @xmath59 show that this procedure does not provide good fits of our data .",
    "indeed , this can be quantitatively explained by the above values of the skewness and the kurtosis , which are much larger than the upper bounds for the distributions of @xmath4 signals  @xcite : @xmath60 and @xmath61 , obtained in the limit @xmath62 .",
    "moreover , the simple exponential decay of the @xmath4 distributions for large @xmath54 disagrees with the @xmath63 decay of the kpz models .",
    "the crsos models considered here are extensions of the original ones in which the incident particle executes a random walk among neighboring columns until finding a position in which its aggregation is allowed  @xcite . in crsos1 and crsos2 models , the conditions @xmath64 and @xmath26 between neighboring columns are satisfied , respectively .",
    "nearly @xmath30 configurations were used to measured @xmath29 in each case .    here , we will show distributions scaled according to eq .",

    "the latter was obtained from the generating function given in ref . @xcite and the calculation of the residues of more than @xmath76 poles closest to the origin .",
    "both distributions have a simple exponential decay for large @xmath77 , which is justified in the vlds case by the linear fit shown in fig . 5 ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "however , the vlds distribution is much narrower than that of the mh theory : the maximum of the vlds scaling function is @xmath79 , while the maximum of the mh one is @xmath80 ( see , e. g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and the respective decays are , approximately , @xmath81 and @xmath82 . for the vlds distribution ,",
    "the skewness and kurtosis are @xmath83 and @xmath84 , while the values for the mh theory are @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "we also tried to fit the scaled distributions of the crsos1 model , in @xmath2 and @xmath0 , with @xmath4-noise distributions  @xcite , with some value of @xmath59 . in @xmath2 , no good fit",
    "was already expected due to the form of the decay of the scaling function discussed above . in @xmath0",
    ", there is no simultaneous agreement of the values of @xmath36 and @xmath37 of those distributions and our estimates , for any @xmath59 , indicating that this type of fit is also impossible . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a fit with @xmath87 was suggested for the distribution of a growth model with arrhenius dynamics , but this was probably a consequence of the lower accuracy of the data for that model .",
    "roughness distributions were calculated for several discrete models in the kpz and the vlds class , in one- and two - dimensional substrates , confirming the scaling relations ( [ scaling2 ] ) and ( [ scaling1 ] ) .",
    "the scaling functions are different from their counterparts of the linear theories , ew ( second order ) and mh ( fourth order ) . in the @xmath27-dimensional kpz class ,",
    "large values of the skewness @xmath36 and kurtosis @xmath37 of the scaling functions are related to the high asymmetry near the maximum . for large @xmath54 , the scaling functions decay approximately as @xmath1 , in contrast to the simple exponential decay of the linear theories and of @xmath43-dimensional kpz . in the @xmath43-dimensional vlds class , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are smaller than those of the mh theory and a decay approximately as @xmath3 is obtained . for the @xmath27-dimensional vlds class ,",
    "the simple exponential decay of the scaled distribution is quantitatively different from that of the mh theory .",
    "another interesting point of our study is that none of the above distributions are fitted by those of @xmath4 noise , for any @xmath59 .",
    "it contrasts with the distributions for model and experimental interfaces in the depinning thresholds analyzed in recent works  @xcite , which indicates strong effects of the non - gaussian nature of the kpz ( in @xmath0 ) and vlds interfaces . on the other hand",
