    "in [ 1 ] we introduced the generalised root identities , namely :    @xmath18    the lhs in ( [ eq : genrtid1 ] ) is the derivative side of the root identities for @xmath19 at @xmath20 and @xmath7 ; the rhs is the root side .",
    "writing @xmath21 for the expression on the derivative side and @xmath22 for the root side , saying that a function @xmath19 satisfies the generalised root identities means that @xmath21 and @xmath22 are identically equal as functions of two complex variables ( we may omit reference to the underlying function @xmath19 in the notation for @xmath23 and @xmath24 unless the context requires it ) .    in general , within an equivalence class of functions (",
    "equivalent up to multiplication by a nowhere - zero entire function ) , we expect there to be a unique representative which satisfies these root identities . for many functions of great interest , however , we saw in [ 1 ] that they themselves satisfy the generalised root identities , at least for many values of @xmath25 and @xmath7 , without any need to go exploring within their equivalence classes .",
    "for example in [ 1 ] we showed that :    \\(a ) the function @xmath26 satisfies the generalised root identities at @xmath27 for arbitrary @xmath6 , with the root identities in this case being precisely equivalent to the famous functional equation for @xmath8 in @xmath7 .",
    "\\(b ) the function @xmath0 satisfies the generalised root identities for arbitrary @xmath28 and @xmath29 , with a renormalisation being required when @xmath10 , and with a distributional interpretation of the derivative side and a cesaro evaluation of the root side required when @xmath30 .",
    "\\(c ) the function @xmath1 satisfies the generalised root identities for arbitrary @xmath31 and @xmath9 , while @xmath32 satisfies the identities when @xmath10 after the removal of an `` obstruction '' in this instance ( the resulting @xmath10 identity being equivalent to the hadamard product formula for @xmath8 ) .",
    "additionally we showed that the derivative side of ( [ eq : genrtid1 ] ) should be identically zero as a function of @xmath25 when @xmath30 and we conducted three cesaro calculations of the root side for such cases , namely for @xmath14 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 . for @xmath14 and @xmath33",
    "we verified the claimed result , at least modulo an estimate on the argument of the zeta function , @xmath35 , in the case @xmath33 which is known to hold if the riemann hypothesis ( rh ) is true . for @xmath34 , however , we claim that the resulting cesaro evaluation of the root side suggests that the riemann hypothesis must be false .",
    "as discussed in [ 1 ] , however , the fact that these computations were conducted for isolated values of @xmath7 , rather than as a systematic extension in open regions of the @xmath7-plane , is a deficiency of the argumentation thus far ( in [ 1 ] , the case of @xmath26 when @xmath27 is in fact the only instance in the whole paper where the case of arbitrary @xmath36 is considered for root identity calculations ) .    in this paper , therefore , we address this by explicitly focusing on the root identities for arbitrary @xmath7 and @xmath20 in @xmath37 ( and then @xmath38 by analytic continuation ) , verifying them in this general case also for the functions considered in [ 1 ] , in particular @xmath39 and @xmath8 .    as in [ 1 ] , however , we start with simple examples before proceeding to the more complex ones . specifically , in section 2.1 , we first consider the simplest possible example of @xmath4 and show that it satisfies the generalised root identities ( [ eq : genrtid1 ] ) for arbitrary @xmath40 . in this case , of course , the root side , @xmath22 , is trivial to compute , but the derivative side for arbitrary @xmath7 is already interesting , requiring the usual distributional calculations when @xmath30 and the use of generalised fresnel integrals when @xmath41 .",
    "we then use this result to extend to the case of arbitrary polynomials in section 2.2 , and to the case of @xmath0 in section 3 .",
    "finally we consider the case of @xmath8 in section 4 . by considering the case of arbitrary @xmath7 and @xmath25",
    "we shall be able to verify numerically that @xmath8 satisfies the generalised root identities ( [ eq : genrtid1 ] ) when @xmath7 and @xmath25 are in half - planar regions of @xmath38 , and also discuss how these numerical computations may be both extended to all of @xmath42 and used to cast light on certain other theoretical gaps identified in [ 1 ] , in particular the legitimacy of the claim there that we may take @xmath43 on the root side for @xmath8 for @xmath14 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 . these results in turn ,",
    "we believe , give strong numerical evidence in support of the idea that @xmath8 does satisfy the generalised root identities at arbitrary @xmath7 ( and in particular at @xmath44 , and @xmath45 ) and hence that the claims in [ 1 ] are valid .",
    "in this case @xmath19 has a single root of multiplicity @xmath46 at @xmath47 and so the root - side of the generalised root identities is given by    @xmath48    we now consider the derivative side in several steps .",
    "\\(i ) the case of @xmath49 : when @xmath10 the derivative side is    @xmath50    and by direct differentiation it is then trivial to see that we likewise have    @xmath51    so that certainly @xmath4 satisfies the generalised root identities for @xmath49 .",
    "using cesaro methods , but there is obviously no need when @xmath49 ]    \\(ii ) the case of @xmath30 : recalling the definition from [ 1 ] of the derivative side , that@xmath53(\\xi)\\textrm{e}^{iz_{0}\\xi}\\textrm{d}\\xi\\label{eq : derivsidedef}\\ ] ] and that @xmath54(\\xi)=-2\\pi$]@xmath55 ( where @xmath56 is the odd heaviside function ) we can calculate the derivative side via the sort of distributional calculations used in [ 1 ] . for @xmath14 we have    @xmath57=1=r(z_{0},0)\\label{eq : rtid_id_fn_derivside3}\\ ] ]    while for @xmath33 we have    @xmath58=-z_{0}=r(z_{0},-1)\\label{eq : rtid_id_fn_derivside4}\\ ] ]    and similarly for @xmath59 so that @xmath4 also satisfies the generalised root identities for @xmath30 .",
    "\\(iii ) the case of @xmath60 : assume initially that @xmath20 is also real and positive .",
    "then the derivative side , @xmath61 is given by    @xmath62    on recalling the definition of @xmath56 .",
    "changing variables in these integrals by letting @xmath63 and noting that @xmath64 , it follows that    @xmath65    but recall the generalised fresnel integral identity    @xmath66    defined initially for @xmath67 and then extended by analytic continuation .",
    "this reduces to the classical fresnel integral from optics @xmath68    from this it readily follows also that    @xmath69    for @xmath67 and extended by analytic continuation .    combining ( [ eq : generalisedfresnel ] ) and ( [ eq : generalisedfresnel2 ] ) in ( [ eq : rtid_id_fn_derivside6 ] ) it follows that we have    @xmath70",
    "thus we see that @xmath4 also satisfies the generalised root identities for arbitrary @xmath60 and @xmath71 .",
    "\\(iv ) extension to arbitrary @xmath72 : keeping @xmath71 initially , we can then extend from @xmath60 to all of @xmath41 by a combination of differentiation under the integral w.r.t @xmath20 and homogeneity arguments ( which guarantee there are no constants of integration ) .",
    "we thus have now verified that @xmath4 satisfies the generalised root identities for arbitrary @xmath5 and @xmath71 . by unique analytic continuation",
    "they therefore continue to hold first for arbitrary @xmath6 and @xmath71 , and finally also for arbitrary @xmath6 and @xmath28 , except for a branch cut from @xmath73 to @xmath27 when @xmath36 .",
    "since @xmath4 satisfies the generalised root identities for arbitrary @xmath74 it follows readily from ( [ eq : derivsidedef ] ) and elementary properties of the fourier transform ( in particular that @xmath75(\\xi)=\\mathcal{f}[f](\\xi)\\textrm{e}^{ia\\xi}$ ] ) that the generalised root identities are also satisfied for arbitrary @xmath76 by @xmath77 .",
    "but then it also follows immediately from the fact that @xmath78 and the obvious additivity of the root side that the generalised root identities must also be satisfied for arbitrary @xmath76 by any polynomial @xmath79 .",
    "for any given @xmath79 , the structure of the branch cuts in @xmath20 when @xmath36 ( corresponding to the branch cut on @xmath80 for @xmath4 replicated for each factor ) is slightly more complicated , but there are no branch cut complications for generic @xmath20 , and in particular for all @xmath20 in a half - plane to the right of the root with the most positive real part , which is all we require in certain subsequent arguments .",
    "in this case @xmath0 has poles of multiplicity @xmath81 at @xmath82 and so the root side of the generalised root identities is    @xmath83    which is classically convergent for @xmath84 and cesaro convergent for general @xmath7 ( renormalisation being required as per [ 1 ] when @xmath10 ) . for example , using the euler - mclaurin sum formula and the same sort of reasoning as used in [ 1 ] , when @xmath85 we have @xmath86 given by    @xmath87    while for @xmath17 we have    @xmath88    and so on . for @xmath36",
    "there is a single branch cut on @xmath89 ( with branch points at @xmath82 ) .    on the derivative side ,",
    "using the working from [ 1 ] , section 3.4 , example 2 , we have@xmath90+\\\\ \\\\\\left[\\frac{(i\\xi)}{2!}+\\frac{(i\\xi)^{2}}{3!}+\\ldots\\right]^{2}-\\ldots\\end{array}\\right\\ } \\textrm{e}^{i(z_{0}+1)\\xi}\\textrm{d}\\xi\\nonumber \\\\ \\label{eq : gammaderivside1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in [ 1 ] we showed already that @xmath91 when @xmath29 ( after renormalisation when @xmath10 ) and thus that @xmath39 satisfies the generalised root identities when @xmath7 is an integer .    now , taking the case when @xmath41 , the working in section 2.1 , in particular ( [ eq : rtid_id_fn_rootside ] ) and ( [ eq : rtid_id_fn_derivside5a ] ) has shown that    @xmath92    for arbitrary @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "it follows in ( [ eq : gammaderivside1 ] ) that , for arbitrary @xmath41 and @xmath95 , we have , after simplification ,    @xmath96    as an euler - mclaurin - style asymptotic expansion for the derivative side .    using ( [ eq : gammarootside])-([eq : gammaderivside3a ] ) we may then write code to numerically check the generalised root identities for @xmath0 when @xmath36 .",
    "in particular , for any given @xmath36 we can evaluate @xmath97 to any desired degree of accuracy for @xmath98 sufficiently large using sufficient terms in ( [ eq : gammaderivside3 ] ) ; and verifying @xmath91 on such a half - plane in @xmath20 ( sufficiently far to the right for the given @xmath7 ) suffices to verify their agreement for all @xmath20 by analytic continuation for the given @xmath7 .",
    "numerical investigations implementing ( [ eq : gammarootside])-([eq : gammaderivside3a ] ) have been implemented in r - code by dana pascovici and it has been found that @xmath0 does indeed appear to satisfy the generalised root identities for arbitrary @xmath76 ( with branch cut on @xmath89 when @xmath36 ) .",
    "for example , consider the following :            these pictures show agreement between real and imaginary parts of @xmath97 and @xmath86 for a range of @xmath7-values from @xmath99 to @xmath100 for @xmath101 using @xmath102 roots to approximate @xmath86 and truncating the expression for @xmath97 at @xmath103 .",
    "the following picture also shows how , for @xmath7 small ( @xmath104 ) , the function @xmath105 closely approaches the limiting function @xmath106 which we know from section 3.4 in [ 1 ] is given by @xmath107 .",
    "the r - script for gamma is made available with this paper and further numerical tests may be performed as desired .",
    "in [ 1 ] , section 4.1 , we derived an expression , using the euler product formula , for the derivative side of the generalised root identities for @xmath8 , which applies for arbitrary @xmath108 , namely    @xmath109    for @xmath110 this is convergent for arbitrary @xmath111 ; and for any given @xmath7 can then be uniquely analytically continued to arbitrary @xmath112 from this right half - plane in @xmath25 . in [ 1 ]",
    "we confirmed that @xmath8 satisfies the generalised root identities when @xmath9 ( for which the root side is convergent ) and that it satisfies them for @xmath10 also after removal of an obstruction , with this result for @xmath10 corresponding to the hadamard product formula for the related function @xmath113 .",
    "we also noted that ( for @xmath110 initially and then all @xmath31 by analytic continuation ) equation ( [ eq : zetaderivsidea ] ) clearly implies that    @xmath114    in [ 1 ] , section 4.2 , we then performed explicit cesaro calculations of the root side , @xmath22 , for @xmath8 in the three cases @xmath44 and @xmath45 . in the first two cases we confirmed that    @xmath115    also , at least modulo an estimate on @xmath35 in the latter case which holds conditional on rh ; so that @xmath8 continues to satisfy the generalised root identities in these two cases .",
    "when @xmath34 , however , we found that    @xmath116    based on the assumption of the riemann hypothesis ; from which we concluded that the riemann hypothesis appears to be false . at no stage in [ 1 ] , however , did we consider the root side , @xmath117 , for @xmath8 for arbitrary @xmath36 , which we noted represented a gap in rigour in our arguments , since care must be taken in ascribing cesaro limits at isolated values of a parameter ( @xmath7 ) in which analytic continuation is being undertaken .",
    "we thus now consider the possibility of arbitrary @xmath36 in the root identities for @xmath8 . in ( [ eq : zetaderivsidea ] ) this extension requires no further work for the derivative side , which is convergent for arbitrary @xmath7 when @xmath110 .",
    "on the root side , we write @xmath117 as the sum of three separate contributions from @xmath118 ( trivial roots ) , @xmath119 ( simple pole ) and @xmath120 ( non - trivial roots ) as in [ 1 ] :    @xmath121    where    @xmath122    when @xmath123 , this is also classically convergent for generic @xmath31 and so may be evaluated to any required degree of accuracy by including sufficiently many roots , both trivial and non - trivial . here , by generic @xmath25 we mean @xmath25 not on either @xmath124 nor on any of the rays running from a non - trivial root @xmath125 horizontally to the left towards @xmath126 ; these being branch cuts of terms in the expressions above .",
    "since it is all that is required for our arguments , and simultaneously avoids all of these branch - cut issues , from now on we shall always restrict consideration to @xmath25 in the half - plane @xmath110 .      for such @xmath25 we",
    "may then readily test numerically whether @xmath8 does satisfy the generalised root identities also for arbitrary @xmath123 by simply evaluating the expressions ( [ eq : zetaderivsidea ] ) and ( [ eq : zetarootsidec1 ] ) to the required degree of accuracy and checking whether we do indeed have    @xmath127    for the derivative side this requires including sufficiently many primes @xmath128 ( the larger @xmath25 the fewer primes required to reach a given accuracy ) ; for the root side it requires including sufficiently many trivial roots for @xmath129 and sufficiently many non - trivial roots for @xmath130 ( the more positive @xmath11 is , the fewer such roots required for a given level of accuracy ) .    in order to implement such numerical tests a list of primes and a list of non - trivial roots must be used .",
    "such lists can readily be obtained and downloaded - e.g. a list of the first @xmath131 zeros can be downloaded as a text file from [ 2 ] , and in fact [ 3 ] contains files listing up to the first @xmath132 zeros .    using these we may then readily code up checks for random values of @xmath133 and @xmath11 and see that @xmath8 does indeed seem to satisfy the generalised root identities ( [ eq : zetagenrootidentity ] ) for arbitrary @xmath134 in this region ( starting with real @xmath134 and then extending by analytical continuation ) .",
    "indeed dana pascovici s r - script for @xmath8 , available with this paper , contains such code ( currently using the first @xmath135 primes ( for @xmath136 ) and the first @xmath102 trivial and @xmath120 zeros ( for @xmath137 ) but readily adaptable to use more of either if desired ) .",
    "this thereby allows rapid , systematic checking and on the basis of this we can confirm that @xmath8 does indeed appear to satisfy the generalised root identities for arbitrary @xmath110 when @xmath123 , albeit that we can not extend the testing down to @xmath7-values too close to @xmath46 without radically increasing the number of roots used in our numerical approximations for @xmath117 , for obvious convergence reasons .",
    "the following pictures , for example , illustrate the agreement of both real and imaginary parts of @xmath138 and @xmath117 for @xmath139 for a range of @xmath7-values greater than @xmath140 .",
    "when @xmath141 the evaluation of both @xmath129 and @xmath130 on the root side requires cesaro methods , since the sums in ( [ eq : zetarootsidec2 ] ) and ( [ eq : zetarootsidec4 ] ) are no longer classically convergent .",
    "we take the components of the root side in turn :",
    "for @xmath143 we use the euler - mclaurin sum formula for the partial sums @xmath144 .",
    "since the shifted roots occur at @xmath145 , @xmath146 , we let @xmath147 with @xmath148 and write    @xmath149    where    @xmath150    now , by euler - mclaurin ,    @xmath151    and so we can obtain the cesaro limit in ( [ eq : zetarootsided1 ] ) by the usual cesaro - style calculations on terms of the form @xmath152 ( see e.g. [ 1 ] or the earlier working for @xmath0 ) .",
    "for example , considering just the case @xmath153 initially , here we have    @xmath154    and thus since pure powers @xmath155 have generalised cesaro limit @xmath15 , so    @xmath156    where this is now a classical limit .",
    "similar but more involved calculations can be performed on the lower order terms to extend ( [ eq : zetarootsided5 ] ) to a formula applicable for @xmath157 , then @xmath158 and so on .",
    "we shall only consider the next case of @xmath157 here and in this case the formula becomes    @xmath159",
    "this is clearly given by    @xmath161    for any @xmath25 and @xmath7 .",
    "here we use the riemann - von mangoldt formula for the counting function @xmath163 and mimic the argumentation in [ 1 ] . write @xmath164where",
    "@xmath165 refers to the subset of non - trivial zeros with positive imaginary part and @xmath166 to the subset with negative imaginary part .",
    "we work initially on @xmath165 and then simply state the corresponding formulae for @xmath166 which are derived in analogous fashion . for a root @xmath167",
    "we have , on writing @xmath168 , that    @xmath169    and therefore , bearing in mind that any roots off the critical line occur in symmetric pairs either side of it and arguing as in [ 1 ] , we have    @xmath170    we next need to express the partial sums for these series in terms of the parameter @xmath118 using the riemann - von mangoldt formula that    @xmath171    where , as in [ 1 ] ,    @xmath172    and",
    "@xmath35 is the argument of the zeta function , and    @xmath173    once we have such expressions we will then re - express them in terms of the geometric variable z ( as in [ 1 ] ) and try to evaluate their generalised cesaro limits by removing eigenfunctions @xmath174 etc and averaging the remainder ( in @xmath118 ) .",
    "note , however , that in combining with @xmath163 only the sums in ( [ eq : zetarootsidef2 ] ) that have no explicit @xmath175-dependence will be able to be handled .",
    "this is because we certainly have no understanding of the functional dependence of any @xmath176 on @xmath118 . in part for this reason , and also for reasons of numerical tractability , for this paper we shall only consider the extension of numerical checks to @xmath177 , @xmath36 .",
    "so now suppose @xmath177 .",
    "then in ( [ eq : zetarootsidef2 ] ) we have only the sums @xmath178 and @xmath179 being divergent , the former for all such @xmath7 , the latter only when @xmath180 .",
    "take the case of @xmath178 first . considering just @xmath165 initially , this generates a contribution up to imaginary part @xmath118 of    @xmath181    since @xmath182 , the terms involving @xmath183 are classically convergent when @xmath184 .",
    "and by arguments analogous to those in [ 1 ] the terms involving @xmath35 are also convergent under some suitable power of the cesaro averaging operator @xmath119 ( they are classically convergent when @xmath185 and require one application of @xmath119 when @xmath157 ) .    the only terms where there are explicit eigenfunction divergences that require removing are therefore those involving @xmath186 . here , from ( [ eq : zetarootsidef4 ] ) we have , on writing @xmath187 , using integration by parts & changing variables to @xmath188 , that    @xmath189\\\\ + \\mu\\intop_{0}^{u}\\left[\\begin{array}{cc } v^{-\\mu}\\ln v - v^{-\\mu}\\\\ + \\frac{7}{8}v^{-\\mu-1}\\end{array}\\right]\\textrm{d}v\\end{array}\\right\\}\\ ] ]    @xmath190    similarly , for @xmath191 we have contribution    @xmath192    and the only divergent terms come from the @xmath186 terms , namely    @xmath193    it follows from combining these calculations in ( [ eq : zetarootsidef2 ] ) that , when @xmath177 , the divergent part of @xmath194 is given by @xmath195 where    @xmath196    since @xmath36 it is then clear that @xmath195 can be expressed exactly in terms of powers of the geometric variable @xmath197 .",
    "in fact    @xmath198    and if @xmath199 in @xmath200 all these terms have generalised cesaro limit @xmath15 so that    @xmath201    in other words , for @xmath142    @xmath202    where @xmath195 is as per ( [ eq : zetarootsideg6 ] ) and this is in fact a classical limit if @xmath16 and requires only one application of the averaging operator , @xmath203 , if @xmath17 .    in similar fashion , for the @xmath120 roots below the real axis , @xmath204 , we have    @xmath205    and thus , by identical reasoning , for @xmath142 the divergent piece of the partial sums to `` height '' @xmath206 for @xmath166 is given by    @xmath207    for @xmath199 this can be expressed exactly in terms of the geometric variable @xmath208 as    @xmath209    with generalised cesaro limit @xmath15 , i.e.    @xmath210    so that , for @xmath142    @xmath211    where @xmath212 is as given in ( [ eq : zetarootsideg11 ] ) and again this is a classical limit if @xmath16 and requires one application of the averaging operator , @xmath213 , if @xmath17 .",
    "if we write @xmath214 and @xmath215 for the expressions on the right in ( [ eq : zetarootsideg9 ] ) and ( [ eq : zetarootsideg14 ] ) we thus have    @xmath216    where    @xmath217    and the expressions in ( [ eq : zetarootsideg9 ] ) and ( [ eq : zetarootsideg14 ] ) then allow numerical computation of @xmath162 also for @xmath142 .",
    "based on the results in parts ( a)-(c ) in section 4.2.1 we have proceeded to implement code for numerical evaluation of @xmath117 and thus for testing of the generalised root identities for @xmath8 for @xmath142 .",
    "the following general observations apply to these efforts :    \\(a ) with only @xmath102 @xmath165 roots , convergence is too slow to obtain reasonable approximate values on the root side when @xmath7 approaches @xmath15 from _ above_. this is for the same reason that we could nt obtain reasonable approximations even in the convergent region ( @xmath11 ) when @xmath7 approached @xmath46 from above . when @xmath7 is just above an integer ( e.g. @xmath15 ) the residual piece , even after throwing away the divergent terms , converges too slowly ( like @xmath218 or @xmath219 when @xmath16 small ) to get reasonable convergence with only @xmath102 @xmath165 roots",
    ".    however , when @xmath7 approaches an integer ( e.g. @xmath15 ) from _ below _ , one can get accurate numerical results , since on throwing away the extra divergent terms that appear when @xmath7 passes through the integer value , the remaining residual term decays much more rapidly ( like @xmath220 or @xmath221 when @xmath13 small ) .",
    "thus for our numerical tests in this section we consider only @xmath7-regions just to the _ left _ of @xmath10 and @xmath15 .",
    "this also helps get accurate evaluations of the trivial - roots contributions , @xmath143 , with our choice of @xmath102 trivial roots .",
    "\\(b ) as noted , when @xmath85 we only need to remove divergent pieces and then take classical limits ( and in doing this we only subtract those terms in the expressions ( [ eq : zetarootsided6 ] ) , ( [ eq : zetarootsideg6 ] ) and ( [ eq : zetarootsideg11 ] ) which are themselves divergent when @xmath85 ) .    when @xmath17 , however , for the @xmath120-root contributions we need to remove the divergent pieces in ( [ eq : zetarootsideg6 ] ) and ( [ eq : zetarootsideg11 ] ) and then apply the cesaro averaging operator ( in @xmath118 or @xmath206 ) once to the resulting partial - sum function on the critical line , whose step - jumps on crossing roots are now bigger than @xmath46 and grow",
    ". alternatively this can be viewed as being needed in order to handle the oscillatory contributions from the @xmath35-components of these expressions .",
    "for @xmath7 small negative and approaching @xmath15 , however , we see that the step - discontinuities approach height @xmath46 and the resulting partial - sum functions become very close to piecewise linear functions with negative slope between root - steps .",
    "this can be seen clearly , for example , in the following picture :        this shows the partial - sum function for @xmath214 when @xmath139 and @xmath222 on the interval @xmath223 .",
    "we see that by using the trapezoidal rule between each pair of successive @xmath120-roots we can readily implement code to perform the required cesaro averaging approximately for @xmath13 small , and hence numerically evaluate the contributions from @xmath224 and @xmath225 . using these we are then able to verify",

    "\\(c ) with the observations from ( a ) and ( b ) in mind , in implementing our numerical root - side calculations to test the root - identities for @xmath8 we have :    \\(i ) implemented this within the @xmath8 r - script for @xmath85 and in order to generate pictures of the partial - sum function in @xmath118 when @xmath17 ( as for example in the figure above ) , but    \\(ii ) implemented the full calculations involving cesaro averaging when @xmath17 in vba code in xl2007 ; this can be adapted to the more powerful framework of r , but is sufficient for our numerical experiments in this paper and has the virtue of enhanced transparency of the code .",
    "both the xl file ( `` rootidentitieszeta_mu_-1to0_testsb.xlsm '' ) and the zeta r - script , along with their required source files , are made available with this paper to allow a reader readily to examine the code involved , replicate the claimed results and conduct further independent tests if desired ( see appendix 5.1 for further brief instructions on doing this ) .",

    "the following pictures show how the convergence on the root side improves appreciably as @xmath230 and agreement between @xmath138 and @xmath117 thus becomes progressively better as @xmath230 :            we believe that these provide convincing evidence that @xmath8 does indeed satisfy the generalised root identities also for @xmath85 ; this could be further tested , over a wider @xmath7-range , by using more than @xmath102 trivial and @xmath120-roots .",
    "\\(b ) when @xmath17 we likewise get reasonably close agreement between @xmath138 and @xmath117 for @xmath231 after cesaro averaging , but @xmath102 @xmath120-roots is insufficient to obtain reasonable root side values when @xmath232 :            these pictures are again for @xmath139 . here , and in all testing described for @xmath17 , the approximations are obtained using @xmath135 primes on the derivative side with a truncation threshold of @xmath233 ( so that @xmath138 values should be very accurate ) , while on the root side we use @xmath102 trivial roots for @xmath129 and an average over the next @xmath135 roots starting at the @xmath234 @xmath120-root , with 5 subintervals in the trapezoidal rule and an offset of @xmath235 ( to avoid the step - jumps at roots ) in the calculation of @xmath236 and @xmath237 .",
    "the following tables show further detail on the breakdown of the calculations for @xmath138 and @xmath117 when @xmath7 is very small , namely @xmath238 , @xmath239 and @xmath240 : ( insert tables here )    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we clearly see that both parts of the above conjecture appear to be confirmed numerically with @xmath241 becoming progressively closer and closer to @xmath242 and @xmath243 diverging as predicted with leading order asymptotics more and more closely resembling @xmath244 .",
    "as noted this in turn provides a strong justification for ascribing value @xmath15 to the 2d cesaro limit of @xmath245 when @xmath14 ( as done in [ 1 ] ) in order to retain continuity of analytic continuation across @xmath14 ; and presumably similarly for @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the numerical results presented in this paper are generated in r - scripts ( `` r code gamma.r '' and `` r code zeta.r '' ) and an xl2007 spreadsheet with vba code ( `` rootidentitieszeta_mu_-1to0_testsb.xlsm '' ) .",
    "the supporting files for the zeta r - script are two .txt files (  first10000primes.txt containing the first @xmath135 primes and `` zero_all2m.txt '' containing the first @xmath102 @xmath165 roots of @xmath8 as obtained from the zip file contained at [ 2 ] ) .",
    "these are also used to populate the required areas of the xl spreadsheet in order for its functions to work correctly .",
    "the spreadsheet has been saved without this data embedded for reasons of space , which is also why the file for the @xmath102 @xmath165 roots is left for the reader to unzip and rename as `` zero_all2m.txt '' . for both the r - scripts and the xl spreadsheet",
    "the code is public and completely transparent .",
