    "the original model  @xcite is related to an artificial intelligence experiment called talking heads  @xcite , in which embodied software agents observe a set of objects through digital cameras , assign them randomly chosen names and communicate these names to each other .",
    "since different agents can invent different names for the same object , the final emergence of a common dictionary for all the agents is not granted from the start .",
    "however , it turns out that such a consensus is in fact experimentally reached . in order to try to capture the essential relevant features of such a dynamics , baronchelli et al .",
    "@xcite have proposed a minimal model of naming game that reproduces the phenomenology of the experiments , despite the agents of the model are far from the complicate software effectively used as `` talking heads '' .",
    "such a model is however amenable to both analytical and extensive numerical treatment  @xcite , allowing for a better understanding of the mechanisms at work .",
    "the model considers @xmath0 identical individuals ( or agents ) which observe the same object and try to communicate its name one to the other .",
    "each agent is endowed with an internal inventory or memory in which it can store an a priori unlimited number of different names or opinions .",
    "initially , each agent has an empty inventory .",
    "the dynamics proceeds as follows : at each time step , two individuals are chosen at random for a pairwise interaction ( or `` communication '' ) .",
    "one of these agents acts as the `` speaker '' and the other one as the `` hearer '' .",
    "if the speaker does not know a name for the object ( its inventory is empty ) , it invents a new name and records it .",
    "else , if it already knows one or more synonyms ( stored in the inventory ) , it chooses one of them randomly .",
    "the invented or selected word is then transmitted to the hearer .",
    "if the hearer already has this term in its memory , the interaction is a success , and both agents retain that term as the right one , canceling all the other terms in their inventories ; otherwise , the interaction is a failure , and the new name is included in the inventory of the hearer , without any cancellation .    the way in which agents may interact with each other is determined by the topology of the underlying contact network .",
    "the mean - field case corresponds to a fully connected network , in which all agents are in mutual contact . in this case , studied in  @xcite , each agent rarely interacts twice with the same partner , so that the system initially accumulates a large number ( @xmath4 ) of different names ( synonyms ) for the object , invented by different agents ( speakers ) and @xmath5 total words in the whole population .",
    "interestingly however , this profusion of different names leads in the end to an asymptotic absorbing state in which all the agents share the same name .    as a second step towards the understanding of the model from a statistical physics point of view , we have considered in",
    "@xcite the case of agents sitting on the nodes of a regular lattice in dimension @xmath6 . in this case",
    ", each agent is connected to a finite number of neighbors ( @xmath7 ) so that it may possess only a finite number of different words in its inventory at any given time . as a result",
    ", the total amount of memory used by the whole system grows as @xmath0 instead of @xmath8 .",
    "local consensus appears at very early stages of the evolution , since neighboring agents tend to share the same unique word .",
    "the dynamics then proceeds through the coarsening of such clusters of agents sharing a common name ; the interfaces between clusters are composed by agents who still have more than one possible name , and diffuse randomly .",
    "because of this particular coarsening process , the average cluster size grows as @xmath9 , and the time to convergence corresponds to the time needed for one cluster to reach the system size , i.e. a time @xmath10 for @xmath11 . in one dimension in particular ,",
    "the convergence is thus dramatically slowed down from @xmath12 to @xmath13 .    in the following ,",
    "we investigate the effect of long - range connections which link agents that are far from each other on the regular lattice .",
    "we use the small - world model of watts and strogatz : starting from a one - dimensional lattice of @xmath0 sites , with periodic boundary conditions ( i.e. a ring ) , each vertex being connected to its @xmath14 nearest neighbors , a stochastic rewiring procedure is applied .",
    "the vertices are visited one after the other , and each link connecting a vertex to one of its @xmath15 nearest neighbors in the clockwise sense is left in place with probability @xmath16 , and with probability @xmath1 is reconnected to a randomly chosen other vertex . for @xmath17 the network retains a purely one - dimensional topology , while the random network structure is approached as @xmath1 goes to @xmath18 . at small but finite @xmath1 ( @xmath19 ) , a small - world structure with short distances between nodes , together with a large clustering ,",
    "is obtained .",
    "for @xmath17 , it has been shown in  @xcite that the dynamics proceeds by a slow coarsening of clusters of agents sharing the same state or word . at small @xmath1 ,",
    "the short - cuts are typically far from each other , with a typical distance @xmath20 between short - cuts so that the early dynamics is not affected and proceeds as in dimension @xmath18 . in particular , at very short times many new words are invented since the success rate is small . after a time of order @xmath0 , each agent has played typically once , and therefore @xmath21 different words have been invented : the number of different words reaches a peak which scales as @xmath0 .",
    "since the number of neighbors of each site is bounded ( the degree distribution decreases exponentially  @xcite ) , each agent has access only to a finite number of different words , so that the average memory per agent used remains finite , as in finite dimensions and in contrast with the mean - field case .",
    "the interaction of neighboring agents first leads to the usual coarsening phenomena as long as the clusters are typically one - dimensional , i.e. as long as the typical cluster size is smaller than @xmath20 .",
    "however , as the average cluster size reaches the typical distance between two short - cuts @xmath22 , a crossover phenomena is bound to take place ; since the cluster size grows as @xmath9  @xcite , this corresponds to a crossover time @xmath23 . for times much larger than this crossover , one expects that the dynamics is dominated by the existence of short - cuts and enters a mean - field like behavior .",
    "the convergence time is thus expected to scale as @xmath8 and not as @xmath24 . in order for this picture to be possible , the crossover time @xmath3 needs to be much larger than @xmath18 , and much smaller than the consensus time for the one - dimensional case @xmath24 ; these two conditions read @xmath2 , which is indeed the necessary condition to obtain a small - world network .",
    "it is therefore expected that the small - world topology allows to combine advantages from both finite - dimensional lattices and mean - field networks : on the one hand , only a finite memory per node is needed , in opposition to the @xmath25 in mean - field ; on the other hand the convergence time is expected to be much shorter than in finite dimensions .",
    "various quantities of interest can be monitored in numerical studies of the naming game model in order to verify and quantify the qualitative expected picture . among the most relevant ones",
    "are the average number of words in the agents inventory , @xmath26 , which corresponds to the average memory used , and the total number of distinct words in the system , @xmath27 .",
    "figure  [ fig : nwk8 ] displays the evolution of the average number of words per agent as a function of time , for a small - world network with average degree @xmath28 , and various values of the rewiring probability @xmath1 and size @xmath0 . while @xmath26 in all cases decays to @xmath0 ( fig .",

    "is observed due to the one - dimensional coarsening process  @xcite .",
    "as soon as @xmath2 however , deviations are observed and get stronger as @xmath1 is increased : the decrease of @xmath30 is first slowed down after the peak , but leads in the end to an exponential convergence .",
    "the intermediate slowing down and the faster convergence are both enhanced as @xmath1 increases . on the other hand , a system size increase at fixed @xmath1 corresponds , as shown in fig .",

    "[ fig : nwk8]b and  [ fig : nwk8resc]b could convey the impression that , after the memory peak , the system tends to reach a stationary state whose length increases with @xmath0 , the analysis of the evolution of the number of _ distinct _ words instead displays a continuous decrease ( see fig .
