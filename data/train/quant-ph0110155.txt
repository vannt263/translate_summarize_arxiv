    ", sources will give rise to boundary conditions on the scattering wave function in the form of incoming plane waves .",
    "however , sources that are close to or within the relevant interaction region should be introduced directly into the schrdinger equation @xcite .",
    "more generally , the concept of a particle source arises naturally if a complex quantum process can be decomposed into several steps , where the preparation of the state under consideration is separated from its further evolution in an external field .",
    "for example , in intense - field laser - atom physics , the laser interacts with a pool of atoms in a complicated nonlinear way . as a result of that process a coherent source of above - threshold electrons",
    "is generated that will emit electrons in the form of an outgoing spherical wave with a given energy in the continuum @xcite .    in this article",
    "we discuss in more detail a stationary quantum source that allows for a fully analytical solution .",
    "our novel example predicts how the properties of the resulting matter waves are controlled by the size of the underlying source .",
    "the model we are presenting is surprisingly simple : a weak , harmonic perturbation couples the bound state in an isotropic oscillator potential to a continuum state experiencing a homogeneous force field . in section  [ sec : sourcemodel ] , we show how the ground state wave function acts as a stationary quantum source for the uniformly accelerated scattering wave , and discuss the ensuing integrated current and current distribution . for a three - dimensional gaussian source embedded into a linear potential environment , an exact solution for the emitted wave and the associated current is obtained in section  [ sec : sourceuniformfield ] , which allows for a pictorial interpretation in terms of a `` virtual '' point source . in section  [ sec : examples ] , this theory serves as a simple model for two phenomena recently investigated experimentally , the formation of a freely falling `` atom laser '' beam from a trapped bose - einstein condensate , as well as near - threshold photodetachment microscopy of negative ions in an electric field .",
    "finally , a brief outlook is given in section  [ sec : outlook ] .",
    "to motivate the quantum source approach , we will introduce a two state model with time - independent hamiltonians .",
    "one state is a bound state of the hamiltonian @xmath0 , the second state is a scattering state of the hamiltonian @xmath1 containing an external potential .",
    "both states have an energy difference of @xmath2 and are weakly coupled by a homogeneous but oscillating interaction potential of strength @xmath3 : @xmath4 we split off the time dependence of the states @xmath5 to obtain the stationary equations @xmath6 upon introducing a suitable energy - dependent green function @xmath7 for @xmath1 ( see section  [ sec : greenanalytic ] ) @xmath8 the formal solution of equation  ( [ eq : psistationarycont ] ) is given by @xmath9 a similar equation holds for @xmath10 .",
    "however , if we assume only a weak interaction in the sense that @xmath10 is not changed appreciably by the interaction , we may as a first approximation replace @xmath10 in equation  ( [ eq : psicontgreen ] ) by the bound eigenstate @xmath11 of @xmath0 , which is defined by @xmath12 in this way we have decoupled both equations and we obtain a new schrdinger equation with an inhomogeneous source term @xmath13 @xmath14 from now on we will suppress the label @xmath15 , since we are not interested in the propagation of the bound state .",
    "therefore the rewritten equation  ( [ eq : psicontgreen ] ) @xmath16 serves as the starting point for our development of the theory of quantum sources .",
    "we associate a probability current density @xmath17 with the scattering wave @xmath18 via @xmath19 where @xmath20 denotes the vector potential .",
    "together with equation  ( [ eq : schroedingersource ] ) it is straightforward to derive the equation of continuity for this stationary problem : @xmath21 note that the introduction of sources @xmath22 in the schrdinger equation  ( [ eq : schroedingersource ] ) causes the appearance of a source term in the equation of continuity that depends on the wave function @xmath18 . by integration over a surface enclosing the source",
    "we obtain a bilinear expression for the total probability current carried by @xmath18 : @xmath23 this quantity details the total cross section of the underlying scattering process .      for our stationary problem ,",
    "the mathematical formulation of source theory heavily relies on the energy - dependent green function @xmath24 of the hamiltonian . in the continuous spectrum of @xmath25 ,",
    "however , this integral kernel is by no means unique . from a physical point of view",
    ", this ambiguity of the solution set ( [ eq : wavefunction ] ) is required to accommodate different boundary conditions for the resulting wave function @xmath26 . here , we are interested in outgoing matter waves that enforce the use of the retarded energy green function @xcite .",
    "( this choice of kernel guarantees the correct sign for the total current @xmath27 ( [ eq : currenttotal ] ) , as shown by an eigenfunction expansion of @xmath24 @xcite . ) for reasons of causality , the retarded energy green function is connected to the propagator @xmath28 of the equivalent time - dependent problem by the laplace transform : @xmath29 the time - dependent quantum propagator is a thoroughly studied subject , and a fairly exhaustive list of available solutions is given in @xcite .",
    "in contrast , only few closed analytic solutions are known for energy - dependent green functions in three dimensions .",
    "notable examples are the expressions for the free field environment , the static uniform electric field @xcite , the static uniform magnetic field @xcite , and combined parallel static electric and magnetic fields @xcite .      exploiting the time - reversal symmetry relation for the propagator @xmath30 , the total current @xmath27  ( [ eq : currenttotal ] ) can be rewritten using equation  ( [ eq : greenprop ] ) as @xmath31 integration with respect to the energy @xmath32 , together with the initial condition @xmath33 , leads to the following sum rule for the total current : @xmath34",
    "to illustrate the formalism developed in the preceding section , we discuss the specific example of a quantum source of gaussian shape embedded in a uniform force field @xmath35 .",
    "experimentally , this situation is approximately realized in near - threshold photodetachment of negative ions in an electric field @xcite , where the limit of point - like sources applies . considerably extended sources emerge when ultra cold rubidium atoms are continuously released from a trapped bose - einstein condensate under the influence of gravity ( `` atom lasers '' , @xcite ) .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath1 for uniformly accelerated motion with @xmath36 is given by : @xmath37 for simplicity , we align the field along the @xmath38-axis : @xmath39 .",

    ", we note that this green function is invariant with respect to simultaneous shifts of the origin and the energy : @xmath45 for a compact notation it is suitable to introduce a set of scaled parameters @xmath46 this allows us to express the green function in integral form via ( [ eq : greenprop ] ) and ( [ eq : kfield ] ) : @xmath47      initially , we discuss a point - like quantum source in a homogeneous force field @xmath35 . assuming an isotropic emission pattern , we may idealize the source @xmath22 in terms of the dirac @xmath48-distribution @xmath49 where @xmath50 denotes some complex constant .",
    "we note that for this type of sources the sum rule stated in equation  ( [ eq : currentsum ] ) is not applicable , since the @xmath51 norm of @xmath52 is not defined .",
    "instead , the detailed mechanism behind the source in equation  ( [ eq : sourcedelta ] ) merely influences the emission process through the scaling parameter @xmath50 , the source strength .",
    "the wave function generated by @xmath53 directly follows from equations  ( [ eq : wavefunction ] ) and ( [ eq : greenfield ] ) @xmath54 and yields analytic expressions for the current density ( [ eq : currentdensity ] ) in the field direction @xmath55}^2+\\beta\\left[z(2e+fz)+fr^2\\right ] { [ { \\rm ai}(\\alpha_-)]}^2\\right\\},\\ ] ] and for the total current ( [ eq : currenttotal ] ) @xmath56}^2 + 2\\beta e { [ { \\rm ai}(-2\\beta e)]}^2\\right\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in a different context , these expressions are implicitly contained also in @xcite .",

    ", a distinct ring pattern in the current density prevails for @xmath126 m . the number of fringes diminishes with increasing source width , until for @xmath127 m the current profile attains an increasingly narrow gaussian shape . to interpret this behaviour",
    ", we first note that for an extended source region , the simple concept of two interfering paths originating from a single point in space is not readily applicable . recalling the particular property of a gaussian source to act as a virtual point source shifted in space ( [ eq : psivirtual ] ) , we may recover the concept of interfering paths .",
    "however , the effective initial kinetic energy decreases with growing source size ( [ eq : scaledparameter ] ) and becomes negative for @xmath128 , leading to a `` virtual '' tunneling source that emits a beam of gaussian profile .",
    "its properties are discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "quantum sources that are inserted into the schrdinger equation provide a convenient and practical tool to assess and solve scattering problems in external potentials . specifically , we studied point - like and gaussian quantum sources embedded within a three - dimensional homogeneous force field , and analytical solutions for the resulting particle distribution and total current were obtained . for point sources ,",
    "the model is in excellent agreement with data gained from near - threshold photodetachment experiments conducted in the presence of an electric field .",
    "available measurements on continuous atom laser beams are in reasonable accordance with the theory presented for an extended source .",
    "dependent on the condensate size , we predict the appearance of a ring pattern related to two - path interference in the atom laser beam released from a single ideal bose - einstein condensate .    a modification of the presented theory to comprise sources with definite angular momentum is feasible and will be the subject of a forthcoming publication .",
