    "in recent years , manifolds living in a higher dimensional space - time well known as _ d - branes _ have fascinated numerous physicists .",
    "they have been derived from topological soliton solutions in string theory @xcite , which arise naturally in ten - dimensional supergravity or string / m - theory @xcite .",
    "it is an old idea that space - time may have more than four dimensions and the extra ones are unobservable for ordinary energy scales @xcite .",
    "there are generally three different possibilities of extra - dimensional scenario : extra - dimensional space is compact @xcite , non - compact but has a finite size @xcite , and non - compact with an infinite size @xcite . in particular , ref.@xcite leads to localized gravity around a 3-brane with non - zero tension in anti - de sitter ( ads ) space though the extra - dimensional space with an infinite size .",
    "the brane proposed in refs.@xcite and its generalizations , _",
    "i.e. _ , models of randall - sundrum ( rs ) type , are essentially static point - like external sources in the extra dimensions . on the other hand , an increasing interest recently has focused on study of gravitating thick ( or fat ) defects embedded in higher dimensional space - time with codimension one or more @xcite .",
    "our main proposal is to construct a new 3-brane which is described by special classical solutions , _",
    "i.e. _ , topological solitons of a field - theoretical lagrangian .",
    "this approach is inspired by the d - branes where the solutions are constructed by topological solitons in string theory . in that sense",
    ", the solitonic branes may be more natural rather than another descriptions by the delta - function like potential .",
    "3-branes in relevant previous works are constructed by the classical solutions in gauge theory ; such as kink in five dimensions ( 5d ) , abelian - higgs vortex in 6d , and thooft - polyakov monopole in 7d @xcite . in particular , codimension-2 braneworld models constructed from abelian - higgs vortex in 6d",
    "are studied for a only case of flat 3-brane but also curved 3-brane @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "our 3-brane is written by a maxwell gauged @xmath2 model whose origin is @xmath1 sigma model in ( 2 + 1)-dimensional field theory @xcite .",
    "@xmath1 sigma model appears in various aspects of physics , and has richer topological classes than abelian - higgs vortex ; lump , gauged vortex , baby skyrmion , and instanton .",
    "the @xmath1 sigma model can possess finite energy soliton solutions by adding some additional terms or gauges into the lagrangian .",
    "the solitons in gauge theory are strongly restricted by the configurations of their gauge groups ; on the contrary , our framework is flexible and thus can be easily applied for various background geometry .",
    "another aim of the present paper is to analyze linear stability of our new solutions by fluctuating all fields @xcite .",
    "study of a linear stability and the second order correction of gravity and coupled fields for models of rs type have been done by numerous authors @xcite .",
    "also , analysis for gravitating thick defects embedded in higher dimensions are found in the literature ; for 5d @xcite , and for 6d @xcite .",
    "( note that the model in ref.@xcite is constructed by gravitating multidefects in five dimensions ) .",
    "the studies for thick defects , however , are _ works in progress _ since the topological defects used in the literature are quite complicated structures . more seriously , stabilized mechanisms for the models of rs type , like `` moduli stabilization '' ,",
    "have not been found .",
    "analyzing the linear stability of our obtained solutions is thus worthwhile to tackle .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in sec.[sc : setup ] we build up the model and the resulting equations of motion . in sec.[sc : bc ] we describe the boundary conditions for the matter fields and the warp factors . in sec.[sc : as ] we mainly discuss about the asymptotic behavior of the solutions of the model . in sec.[sc : ns ] we introduce the methods for solving our boundary - value problem .",
    "some typical results localizing gravity around the 3-brane are shown in this section . in sec.[sc : lgp ] we give a detailed analysis for the stability of our branes for linearized gravitational perturbations .",
    "finally , in sec.[sc : cncl ] some conclusions and summary of this paper are drawn .",
    "in this section we shall construct maxwell gauged @xmath0 model combining with general relativity in six dimensions .",
    "as in the previous works for braneworld scenarios , an action of the models is written as a coupled system with gravity and solitons .",
    "the total action of our six - dimensional model is written as @xmath3 where @xmath4 is maxwell gauged @xmath0 model action and @xmath5 is the six - dimensional generalization of einstein - hilbert gravity .",
    "the explicit form of einstein - hilbert gravity is given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the six - dimensional ricci scalar , @xmath8 is the bulk cosmological constant , @xmath9 and @xmath10 denotes the six - dimensional planck mass .",
    "on the other hand , the brane action ) field , therefore the small latin indices run about from 1 to 2 . ]",
    "is of the form @xmath11 \\biggr\\ } , \\label{eq : brane_action}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the third component of the pauli matrix .",
    "the action ( [ eq : brane_action ] ) is strongly motivated by the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional field - theoretical model @xcite .",
    "the coupling constants @xmath13 describe those of the field strength of the gauge field , the kinetic term of @xmath0 and the potential term .",
    "their dimensions are @xmath14 , [ m^4],[m^6]$ ] in the n.u.(@xmath15 denotes a unit of mass ) , respectively .",
    "the gauge covariant derivative @xmath16 in eq.([eq : brane_action ] ) is defined in terms of the @xmath17 gauge field @xmath18 such as @xmath19 in standard @xmath0 model , the @xmath18 is not an independent field but is the composite field connection in terms of @xmath0 field defined as @xmath20 .",
    "the composite field connection substantially works as a @xmath17 gauge field @xcite .",
    "thus we replace the composite field connection with the @xmath17 gauge connection @xmath18 and treat as the independent field variable @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that our model with this replacement is not to be completely equivalent to @xmath1 sigma model .",
    "formally by varying the actions ( [ eq : grav_action ] ) and ( [ eq : brane_action ] ) with respect to the field variables , one can obtain the classical equations of motion @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the covariant derivative with respect to the metric tensor and @xmath23 is the six - dimensional energy - momentum tensor .    at the present paper",
    ", we would like to consider about a warped six - dimensional space - time with axially symmetric two extra dimensions .",
    "the ansatz is imposed on the metric tensor @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are , respectively , the bulk radius and the bulk angle , @xmath27 denotes four - dimensional minkowski metric tensor and the function @xmath28 are often called _",
    "warp factors _ in brane world scenarios . for the matter fields ,",
    "we explore the solutions for the @xmath0 doublet field and the @xmath17 gauge field of the form : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the winding number of the gauge field and the @xmath0 doublet @xmath31 satisfies the constraint @xmath32 .",
    "the classical equations of motion of the present system are then @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the dimensionless gravitational coupling constant , @xmath35 is the dimensionless bulk cosmological constant , and @xmath36 is the dimensionless coupling constant . besides the dimensionless coordinate @xmath37 is introduced and the prime in the equations denotes the derivative with respect to this dimensionless coordinate .",
    "the matter fields @xmath38 , @xmath39 and the warp factors @xmath40 , @xmath41 are rewritten in terms of the new coordinate , that is , @xmath42 the functions @xmath43 and @xmath44 are defined by the above functions as @xmath45 which seem to have some similarity with the cole - hopf transformation appearing in the integrable theory .",
    "the components of the energy - momentum tensor @xmath46 go to be dimensionless ones @xmath47 where the dimensionless quantities @xmath48 have been defined as @xmath49    before beginning our analysis , let us consider basic properties of the field equations ( [ eq : scalar])-([eq : eeq_r ] ) .",
    "clearly eqs.([eq : scalar ] ) and ( [ eq : gauge ] ) are the dynamical equations because they are second order differential equations of the fields @xmath50 .",
    "since eqs.([eq : eeq_4d ] ) and ( [ eq : eeq_theta ] ) contain @xmath51 , _",
    "i.e. _ , the second derivative of the warp factors , these equations are the dynamical equations , too .",
    "eq.([eq : eeq_r ] ) is comprised of the first derivatives only .",
    "thus it means that the equation works as a constraint equation for the dynamical fields @xmath52 . as a result ,",
    "we must treat a numerical problem of a series of four dynamical equations with one constraint equation .",
    "existence of topological soliton solutions is inferred from derrick s scaling argument @xcite in which , if soliton exists , a stationary point of the energy in the field configuration should be stationary against all variations including spatial rescaling . also , the soliton solutions always have the lower energy bound which is defined by their topology . for the @xmath17 gauged @xmath0 model with maxwell or chern - simon term , such existence proof was confirmed numerically @xcite . besides the original maxwell gauged @xmath0 model in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions can have topological soliton solutions @xcite .",
    "these analysis clearly indicate that the solitons can be stabilized without any higher order terms , like the _ skyrme term _ in ( 3 + 1 ) dimensions @xcite .",
    "if we apply these models to the six - dimensional space - time , both the @xmath2 field and the @xmath17 gauge field should go to zero at infinity and be regular at the origin in the extra - dimensional space , which exactly agree with the topological requirements of the model .",
    "these conditions are @xmath53 as is well known that @xmath54 model has a close relation to @xmath1 sigma model . for the case of @xmath55 , one can easily obtain the @xmath1 sigma model by using the transformation @xmath56 where @xmath57 are scalar triplet fields , @xmath58 are doublet fields , and @xmath59 are the three pauli matrices . in the sense ,",
    "the original @xmath0 model is essentially @xmath1 sigma model when it is written in terms of the @xmath60 .",
    "moreover , in the view of @xmath1 sigma model , the topological boundary condition is interpreted as the south pole configuration at the origin and the north pole configuration at infinity .",
    "the details of above discussion can be seen , _",
    "e.g. _ , in ref.@xcite . as mentioned before ,",
    "our model however is not equivalent to @xmath1 sigma model completely .",
    "regular geometry at the origin defines the boundary conditions for the warp factors .",
    "an effective action derived from six - dimensional gravity action generally has two kinds of singularity at the origin , which are called conical and curvature singularity problem ( _ e.g. _ , in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the boundary conditions for geometry are introduced in order to exclude these serious difficulties in the six - dimensional model . in this paper",
    "they are given by @xmath61 one simply fixes @xmath62 since the value of @xmath63 is an arbitrary constant .",
    "the boundary conditions for @xmath64 and @xmath65 correspond to the conical and the curvature singularity problem at the origin , respectively .",
    "also , we concentrate on the problem of the regular geometry without the conical singularity so that we employ the boundary condition @xmath66 .    in order to solve the equations of motion ( [ eq : scalar])-([eq : eeq_r ] ) by an analytical method , the boundary conditions ( [ eqs : matter_bc ] ) and ( [ eq : reg ] ) are sufficient .",
    "however , eqs.([eq : reg ] ) do not tell anything about the asymptotic behavior of the metric tensor at large @xmath67 and thus a possibility of the gravity localization around the 3-brane remains unknown .",
    "the requirement of the gravity localization is equivalent to a finiteness of the four - dimensional planck mass @xmath68 , _ i.e. _ , an inequality @xmath69 must be satisfied . notice that solutions respecting the boundary conditions do not often satisfy the inequality ( [ eq : planckmass ] ) .",
    "since the inequality requires a fine - tuning of parameters for realizing the gravity localization , practically it works as the fifth boundary condition of the model . as we shall see below , imposing it on the model and considering about a empty space - time with only the bulk cosmological constant , we can find the information of geometry far from the origin .",
    "if a gravitational source in certain brane model is constructed by a _",
    "topological defect , the all source terms in the einstein equation will vanish for the region of @xmath70 .",
    "namely an asymptotic behavior of geometry at infinity , which can not be determined by the boundary conditions , obeys vacuum solutions of the sourceless einstein equation with the bulk cosmological constant .    combining the components of einstein equation ( [ eq : eeq_4d])-([eq : eeq_r ] )",
    ", one can easily find equations for vacuum solutions , given by @xmath71 if the cosmological constant @xmath72 is negative , then one analytically obtains the solutions @xmath73 where @xmath74 are arbitrary integral constants and the coefficient @xmath75 is a function of the model parameters . on the other hand ,",
    "the case for the positive @xmath72 was investigated in ref.@xcite .",
    "therefore we shall concentrate the case of the negative bulk cosmological constant @xmath72 at the present paper .",
    "both cases are acceptable in seven dimensions @xcite .    furthermore , in order to study the singularity structure of the geometry , we investigate all curvature invariants for the metric tensor ( [ eq : metric ] ) .",
    "explicit forms of the curvature invariants are @xmath76^{2 } } { 5\\mathcal{m}^{4}\\mathcal{l}^{2 } } \\label{eqs : curv_inv}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath77 are defined as dimensionless curvatures .",
    "the curvatures were already defined , _",
    "e.g. _ , in ref.@xcite .    inserting eqs.([eqs : gv_solutions ] ) into eqs.([eqs : curv_inv ] ) , we study the geometry at infinity .",
    "the scalar and the ricci curvature invariants @xmath78 are simply constants for any @xmath79 , whereas the riemann and the weyl curvature invariants @xmath80 are functions of @xmath79 , where @xmath81 thus we find that the scalar and the ricci curvature invariants are always constant and the regularity of the riemann and the weyl curvature invariants depend on @xmath79 , for the above vacuum solutions",
    ".    next , in order to study whether the gravity can be localized and the geometry can be regularized on those solutions , we must analyze about the integral constant @xmath79 .    for @xmath82 ,",
    "the solutions become @xmath83 and thus the warp factors @xmath84 are exponentially decreasing . in the present case the riemann and the weyl curvature invariants are also constants similar to the others .",
    "also each of the curvature invariants is equivalent to the one calculated from riemann tensor for ads@xmath85 space in ref.@xcite .",
    "for ads@xmath85 space , each of the curvature tensors is represented in terms of the gaussian curvature @xmath86 , which are given by @xmath87 since one can easily find @xmath88 from @xmath89 in eqs.([eqs : scalar&ricci ] ) in our six - dimensional model ( namely @xmath90 ) , the other curvature invariants for ads@xmath91 can be also obtained simply .",
    "therefore the choice of @xmath79 is desired one for the finiteness of the four - dimensional planck mass ( [ eq : planckmass ] ) ; since the asymptotic solutions can lead to a smooth ads@xmath91 geometry far from the vortex string core and to localize gravity around the vortex string .",
    "are as follows ( see also ref.@xcite ) .",
    "if @xmath92 or @xmath93 , we obtain exponentially growing solutions . for this case eq.([eq : planckmass ] ) diverges and therefore gravity can not be localized .",
    "( the case @xmath94 is somewhat specific since a singularity of kasner type is developed in the origin . ) if @xmath95 , the geometry has a singular point @xmath96 and @xmath97 should be required . in spite of the fact , the integral ( [ eq : planckmass ] ) is finite .",
    "thus this case has a possibility of localizing gravity if the singularity at @xmath96 is resolved . finally , let us note that if the bulk cosmological constant @xmath8 is zero , solutions have a power - law behavior belonging to kasner class .",
    "these solutions leave open only two possibilities but can not lead to localization of gravity . ]",
    "the integral constants @xmath98 have not been fixed for the above discussion . however ,",
    "if a string - like defect is placed at the origin @xmath99 , the constants are no longer arbitrary and become functions of the model parameters @xmath100 , namely , @xmath101 , and so on",
    ". the regular geometry is achieved together with the gravity localization if the parameters lie on the surface @xmath102 .",
    "therefore we shall find numerical solutions with @xmath102 .",
    "in order to solve eqs.([eq : scalar])-([eq : eeq_r ] ) numerically , asymptotic behaviors of the warp factors , scalar , and gauge fields in the vicinity of the origin as well as at large distance of the core are mandatory @xcite .",
    "they are obtained by expanding the functions around the origin and approximating the equations at infinity . in this section",
    ", we also study about relations for a string tension since they may give useful informations to find the proper solutions .      to examine behaviors at the origin , we start by expanding the warp factors together with the scalar and gauge fields as power series in @xmath67 . here",
    "we consider the case of @xmath103 .",
    "( for other @xmath30 s one can estimate in a quite similar fashion . )",

    "we employ the parallel or multiple shooting method ( psm ) @xcite as the solver of the two - point boundary - value problem since psm successfully dissolves the instability of ssm very well .",
    "the word of _ instability _ in our problem means that the functions released from a boundary - point tend to be divergent before arriving at the other . in psm , in order to evade the instability of ssm , the integral region is divided into some subintervals where the running solutions is regular .",
    "after that , we apply ssm to each of them and continue the calculation until the functions converge at all junction and both boundary - points . since psm requires many initial conditions for all junction ,",

    "thus the procedure to obtain solutions is as follows : ( i ) solve the equations by ssm with the down - hill simplex method , ( ii ) use the solutions as an initial trajectory for psm , ( iii ) solve by psm to obtain new solutions , and ( iv ) repeat ( ii)-(iii ) until the convergence is attained .",
