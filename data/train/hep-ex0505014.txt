    "the possibility to determine the cp properties of a light higgs boson through the spin correlations in its @xmath1 decay has been often considered  [ 19 ] .",
    "the principle is simple .",
    "let @xmath2 denote the projection of the spins of the @xmath3 s in their respective rest frames on a @xmath4-axis oriented in the direction of the @xmath5 line of flight for the @xmath6 and opposite to the @xmath6 line of flight for the @xmath5 .",
    "the @xmath7 spin state @xmath8\\ ] ] is a cp@xmath9 state for @xmath10 , a cp@xmath11 state for @xmath12 , and a mixed cp state otherwise .",
    "such a state is produced by the decay of a cp=+1 higgs with a coupling  @xcite @xmath13 in this case , neglecting @xmath14 , the phase is @xmath15 .",
    "the spin correlations for the state ( [ eq : etat ] ) are : @xmath16 the way to measure @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) is transparent in the case of two @xmath19 decays . using ( [ eq : etat ] ) and the @xmath3 decay amplitudes , one gets the correlated decay distribution @xmath20~,\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the polar angle in the @xmath22 rest frame between the @xmath23 direction ( @xmath24 ) and the above defined @xmath4-axis .",
    "the relative azimuthal angle @xmath25 is the angle between the two planes defined by the @xmath5 direction and the @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) direction respectively in the higgs rest frame .",
    "the distribution of the azimuthal angle is obtained by integrating out the polar angles : @xmath28~.\\ ] ] the merits of the two distributions for the measurement of @xmath17 can be quantified by their sensitivities @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the error on @xmath17 expected from a maximum likelihood fit of the distribution for a sample of @xmath31 events .",
    "the sensitivities measure the information per event on @xmath17 contained in the distributions  @xcite ; their computation is straightforward when an analytical or numerical expression of the distributions is known .",
    "they are @xmath32 for the distribution  ( [ eq : w3d ] ) and @xmath33 for  ( [ eq : w1d ] ) .",
    "the superiority of ( [ eq : w3d ] ) is not very large and it decreases when experimental effects are introduced .",
    "for that reason and for the sake of simplicity , we will only consider the distribution  ( [ eq : w1d ] ) in the following .    the best place to study a light higgs at a linear @xmath34 collider is the higgsstrahlung process @xmath35 .",
    "we assume that the mass of the higgs is well measured by the analysis of its dominant decay modes .",
    "the four - momentum of the higgs is determined by the measurement of the z and therefore the four - momenta of the @xmath6 and the @xmath5 can , in principle , be reconstructed in the case of two hadronic decays ( sec .",
    "[ sec : hgfr ] ) .",
    "it is known  @xcite that under such circumstances the three main hadronic decay modes , @xmath0 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 have the same analysis power for the measurement of spin effects .",
    "this is due to the fact  [ 11,13 ] that , in the @xmath3 rest frame , all the information on the spin is embodied in the distribution of a unit vector @xmath38 , the polarization analyser , which is equal to @xmath24 ( pion direction ) in the case of @xmath0 .",
    "this vector can be computed  @xcite from the measured momenta in the case of the above decay modes .",
    "for example , if @xmath36 and @xmath39 , then @xmath40 where @xmath41 is a normalization factor , @xmath42 is the four - momentum of the neutrino , and @xmath43 is the difference of the four - momenta of the two pions .",
    "the distribution ( [ eq : w3d ] ) , where @xmath44 is replaced by @xmath38 in the definition of the angles , contains all the available information on the spin correlation .",
    "the three decay modes ( i.e. , ( 55%)@xmath45 of the @xmath7 pairs ) can therefore be used in the same way for the measurement of the cp violating parameter @xmath17  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , it has been shown by monte carlo studies  @xcite that the standard reconstruction ( sec .",
    "[ sec : hgfr ] ) of the @xmath3 four - momenta is critically impaired by the effects of beamstrahlung .",
    "a new estimator has been proposed  [ 79 ] , which is less sensitive to the quality of the @xmath3 reconstruction but requires that both @xmath6 and @xmath5 decay by the process @xmath36 .",
    "however , the ideal sensitivity of the new method , when all the four - momenta are exactly known , is @xmath46 to be compared with @xmath47 for the standard method . besides it takes advantage of @xmath48 only of the @xmath7 pairs .",
    "there is therefore a possible improvement of the error on @xmath17 by a factor of at least four , if a method of reconstruction of the @xmath3 s insensitive to beamstrahlung is found .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to devise such a method . to check the sensitivity to beamstrahlung",
    ", we use a simple monte carlo procedure .",
    "first the energies of the @xmath49 after beamstrahlung are generated using the program circe  @xcite with the parameters of the tesla project and the cross section for higgsstrahlung in the case of a cp=+1 higgs  @xcite ; next the production and decay angles of the z are generated according to their correlated distribution under the same hypothesis  @xcite .",
    "the higgs decay angles are generated according to an isotropic distribution .",
    "for the correlated decay of the @xmath3 s we consider three cases : two decays into @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) , a decay into @xmath50 and a decay into @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) , and two decays into @xmath52 ( @xmath54 ) . for each case , the azimuthal angles and the cosines of the polar angles in the decays of @xmath3 s and @xmath55 s are generated uniformly . from eq .",
    "[ eq : etat ] and the decay amplitudes for @xmath0 and @xmath56 , the correlated decay probabilities are computed for diverse values of @xmath17 and the events are accepted or rejected accordingly .",
    "the four - momenta of all the particles are then computed and , finally , the decay lengths of the @xmath3 s are generated .",
    "the higgs mass is assumed to be 120  gev and three values of the total energy are considered : @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "the natural energy for a detailed study of the higgs is the energy of the largest cross section ( i.e. near @xmath60 ) .",
    "the consideration of higher energies allows estimating the robustness of the method and possibly the effect of an underestimation of radiative effects .",
    "the reconstruction of the @xmath3 s in the @xmath7 rest frame for hadronic decays @xmath61 has been known for a long time  @xcite and was used at lep to improve the measurement of the @xmath3 polarization  @xcite .",
    "its principle is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : taucone ] . both @xmath3",
    "s have the same energy @xmath62 and the energies and momenta of the hadrons are measured .",
    "the angle @xmath63 between the direction of a @xmath22 displayed by the unit vector @xmath64 and the direction of the hadron @xmath65 is therefore fixed : @xmath66 the direction of the @xmath5 , @xmath67 is on the intersection between the cone around @xmath68 with angle @xmath69 and the cone around @xmath70 with angle @xmath71 .    in general there are two solutions @xmath72 , where the vectors @xmath73 and @xmath74 , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : taucone ] , are given by @xmath75\\nonumber \\vec{n}_\\perp&=&\\sqrt{\\frac{1-\\vec{n}_{\\scriptscriptstyle\\parallel}\\,\\!\\!^2}{\\sin^2\\delta}}\\,\\hat{h}^+\\wedge\\hat{h}^-~ , \\hspace{1em}\\text{with}\\hspace{1em}\\cos\\delta=-\\hat{h}^+\\cdot\\hat{h}^-~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the ambiguity can be resolved using the information from a vertex detector but , because the main vertex is known from the z decay , the use of the detector is rather different and simpler than at lep  @xcite .",
    "one needs only to make a chi - square test on the distances in the laboratory between the reconstructed @xmath3 lines of flight and the trajectories of the charged pion s .",
    "the situation is degraded in the presence of beamstrahlung and/or other experimental effects because the intersection of the two cones is no more granted . as a result",
    "the acceptance is reduced and the distribution of @xmath76 strongly deformed .",
    "the reconstruction is especially awkward in the case of two @xmath0 decays , because the polarization analyser is then @xmath77 and thus @xmath76 is the angle between the vectors @xmath78 and @xmath79 . from eq .",
    "[ eq : nparperdef ] , one gets @xmath80 which shows that the two cones are tangent when @xmath81 , feature that can also be observed in fig .  [",
    "fig : taucone ] . as a consequence , even for @xmath82 , where the closeness to the threshold reduces the effect of beamstrahlung ,",
    "the acceptance becomes very small when @xmath83 is near @xmath84 and the distribution  ( [ eq : w1d ] ) can hardly be used to test the cp properties of the higgs .",
    "owing to the observation of the z decay products , which allows the reconstruction of the main vertex , one may envisage to perform the reconstruction of the @xmath3 s in the laboratory frame .",
    "let us assume that the @xmath22 energies in the laboratory @xmath85 are known .",
    "the angles @xmath86 between the directions of the @xmath3 s and the hadrons are given by the relation  ( [ eq : cosdelta ] ) , which reads here @xmath87 the reconstruction of the @xmath22 direction is then very simple in the case of the @xmath19 decay mode ( fig .",
    "[ fig : taulab]-a ) .    denoting by @xmath88 the unit vector of the perpendicular from the vertex to the pion trajectory and by @xmath24 , the unit vector of the pion momentum , the vector @xmath89 is given by @xmath90 in the case of a @xmath91 decay mode , @xmath89 is on the intersection of the plane defined by the vertex and the charged @xmath92 trajectory with the cone around @xmath93 with angle @xmath94 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : taulab]-b ) .",
    "there are in general two solutions .",
    "the problem of the reconstruction of the two @xmath3 s is therefore a problem with two unknowns : @xmath95 and @xmath96 , but even in the presence of beamstrahlung we still have three constraints : the conservation of the components of the momentum orthogonal to the beams and the equality of the @xmath7 effective mass with the higgs mass .",
    "they are sufficient to determine the two energies and resolve the ambiguities if needed .",
    "the sensitivities to @xmath17 of the reconstructed distributions when only beamstrahlung is taken into account .",
    "the effect of the small loss of acceptance in the @xmath51 channel is included .",
    "[ tbl : sensbsonly ] [ cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]     for the charged tracks an independent gaussian smearing is performed on the five parameters : @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 and the two components of the impact parameter .",
    "we use for the widths of the gaussians the following values  @xcite : @xmath100@xmath101 the energy of the jets is smeared according to @xmath102  .",
    "the position of the vertex is determined by the shape of the beam  @xcite for the @xmath103 and @xmath104 coordinates and by the charged decay products of the z for the @xmath4 coordinate .",
    "the smearing of these coordinates is done accordingly .",
    "the reconstructed distributions at an energy of 350gev , with all the experimental effects included in the simulation , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pipi ] for the decays of the z both into @xmath105 and into @xmath106 .",
    "their sensitivities to @xmath17 at the three considered energies are given in table  [ tbl : pipismr ] .",
    "it is clear from these values that a large part of the sensitivity is retained .    because of the key role of the vertex detector in the reconstruction",
    ", we have done again the simulations with the vertex detector errors multiplied by two .",
    "the reduction of the sensitivities that results from the increased uncertainties is always smaller than 0.1 .",
    "we have studied the production of a light higgs boson by the process of higgsstrahlung and its subsequent decay into @xmath7 , under the conditions of a linear collider .",
    "we have described a method , which by the joint use of kinematics and vertexing allows the measurement of the transverse spin correlations of the two @xmath3 s .",
    "this method is not impaired by beamstrahlung and can be applied for the main hadronic decay modes of the @xmath3 and most of the visible decay modes of the z.    in the case of two @xmath0 decays , a complete simulation of the detector effects with the parameters of the tesla project  @xcite has been performed",
    ". a realistic study of the reconstruction of the @xmath107 is still to be done , nevertheless it appears that a reasonable goal for the measurement of the phase @xmath17 that parametrizes a possible cp violation should be to use all the above mentioned final states and get a sensitivity better than 0.5 , i.e. , @xmath108 .",
