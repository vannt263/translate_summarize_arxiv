    "the origin of the masses of standard model ( sm ) particles from spontaneous electroweak symmetry breaking , called higgs mechanism , is supported by the new observed scalar boson with a mass around 125 gev , measured by atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite .",
    "following the same concept , the mystery of tiny neutrino masses may be solved in the framework of multiple higgs fields without introducing the heavy singlet right - handed neutrinos @xcite , in which the representative model is the higgs triplet extension of the sm @xcite and here we call it as the conventional type - ii seesaw model ( cttsm ) .",
    "the novel feature of a higgs triplet model is the existence of a doubly charged higgs , hereafter denoted by @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , in order to detect the higgs triplet particles , the searches for @xmath1 at colliders have been studied widely by theorists  @xcite and experimentalists  @xcite .",
    "the collider signatures ordinarily depend on the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the neutral triplet field , @xmath7 , which is the source of neutrino masses .",
    "for instance , if @xmath8 gev or the associated leptonic yukawa couplings are relatively large , it is found that the doubly charged higgs mainly decays into a pair of same - sign charged leptons , i.e. @xmath9 ( @xmath10 )  @xcite .",
    "however , if @xmath11 gev or the associated leptonic yukawa couplings are relatively small , the dominant decay channel of @xmath1 is @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the searches for @xmath13 at colliders usually are focused on the decay channels of same - sign leptons or same - sign w bosons . consequently",
    ", if one assumes that @xmath13 is 100% decaying into leptons , the experimental lower bound of its mass now is around 400 gev  @xcite .",
    "if @xmath14 channel is dominant , the mass limit of @xmath1 now is up to 300 ( 550 ) gev when @xmath15 gev  @xcite .    historically , the two - higgs - doublet model ( thdm ) was proposed for solving the weak and strong cp problems  @xcite . in spite of the original motivation ,",
    "thdm itself provides rich phenomena in particle physics . by the new discovery of 125 gev scalar boson at atlas and cms ,",
    "the phenomenology of thdm has been further investigated broadly in the literature , e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite . by combining the issue of neutrino physics , it is intriguing to explore the fantastic effects in the model involving two higgs doublets ( thds ) and one higgs triplet .",
    "indeed , we find that the production and decay patterns of doubly charged higgs will be completely changed when the second higgs doublet is added to the cttsm .    in the thd type - ii seesaw model , although we have new interacting terms from various sectors , the most attractive new effects are the dimension-3 terms in scalar potential , read by @xmath16 ( j , k = 1,2 ) , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the higgs doublet and triplet , respectively .",
    "since the coefficients @xmath19 are of order of electroweak ( ew ) scale , the new terms lead a large mixing angle between the singly charged higgs of doublet ( @xmath20 ) and of triplet ( @xmath21 ) . according to our previous study  @xcite ,",
    "if we assume the higgs triplet particles are heavier than the higgs doublets , due to the new mixing effect , we have the interesting phenomena : ( i ) the charged higgs @xmath20 could be lighter than that in type - ii thdm , ( ii ) even we set the degeneracy of @xmath22 , the mass splitting between @xmath1 and @xmath21 could be magnified , ( iii ) the branching fractions for @xmath23 are much larger than those for @xmath24 . due to these new characters , one expects that the signals of @xmath1 in the thd type - ii seesaw model are different from those signals in other triplet models .    for exploring the signals of @xmath1 , in this paper we study its various production processes .",
    "since now the higgs doublets could couple to the higgs triplet , unlike the cases in cttsm and georgi - machacek model @xcite where ew processes dominate , we find that the doubly charged higgs in our model is predominantly produced by qcd processes , indicated by @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "due to more jets involved in the production and decays of @xmath1 , the selected events for simulation are @xmath27 + @xmath28jets with @xmath29 . for reducing the possible background events , we propose several kinematical cuts on the second highest transverse - momentum lepton and the invariant mass of the same - sign dilepton .",
    "additionally , we also study the discovery potential for @xmath6 significance with the collision energy of 13 tev and the designed luminosity at the lhc .",
    "we organize the paper as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we briefly discuss the relevant new interactions originated in yukawa sector , gauge invariant kinetic terms of involved scalar fields and the scalar potential .",
    "the new characters of doubly charged higgs is also introduced .",
    "we investigate the production and decays of doubly charged higgs and the branching fractions of singly charged higgses in sec .",
    "the detailed simulation on signals and backgrounds are given in sec .",
    "we summarize the findings in sec .",
    "for studying the detection of doubly charged higgs in the thd and one higgs triplet model , we first summarize the relevant interactions with @xmath1 .",
    "the detailed introduction to the model could refer to ref .",
