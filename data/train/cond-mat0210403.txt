    "furthermore the data collapse confirms again that the steady state scaling behavior of the pcp is characterized by the dp exponents .",
    "one of the most striking features of critical phenomena is the concept of universality , i.e. , close to the critical point the scaling behavior depends only on few fundamental parameters whereas the interaction details of the systems do not alter the scaling behavior . in the case of systems with short range interactions",
    "these parameters are the symmetry of the order parameter and the dimensionality of space  @xmath70  @xcite .",
    "classical examples of such universal behavior are for instance the coexistence curve of liquid - vapor systems  @xcite and the equation of state in ferromagnetic systems  @xcite . in the case of absorbing phase transitions",
    "the corresponding universality hypothesis states that systems exhibiting a continuous phase transition to a unique absorbing state generally belong to the universality class of directed percolation  @xcite .",
