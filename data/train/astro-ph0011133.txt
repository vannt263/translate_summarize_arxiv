    "much of the current research on gamma - ray bursts ( grb ) is aimed at determining the nature of the central engine and its progenitor system . while recently substantial results have begun to accumulate ,",
    "the evidence is still tentative .",
    "thus , the investigation of criteria to differentiate between various central engine possibilities is desirable .",
    "almost all the present fireball models , including those considering various non - uniform injection scenarios , assume that the energy injection into the fireball occurs in a short period of time .",
    "this is also the case in the `` refreshed shock '' scenario ( rees & mszros 1998 ; kumar & piran 2000 ; sari &   2000 ) .",
    "however , in some types of central engines , such as a fast - rotating high - field pulsar ( magnetar ) or a black hole plus a long - lived debris torus system , a significant energy input into the fireball may in principle continue for a time scale significantly longer than the @xmath2-ray emission .",
    "therefore , there is a need to investigate a continuously - fed fireball in more detail .",
    "an additional motivation is provided by the recent detection of fe features in the x - ray afterglow of grb 991216 after about 1.5 days ( piro et al . 2000 ) and grb 000214 after about 1 day ( antonelli et al , 2000 ) , which may require a continuing post - burst outflow in order to achieve less restrictive fe abundance constraints ( rees & , 2000 ) .",
    "dai & lu ( 1998a , b ) first considered continuous injection from a millisecond pulsar to interpret the afterglow light curves of some grbs , but did not perform a systematic study on this topic . in this paper",
    ", we investigate the observational consequences of a continuously injecting central engine , and more specifically , focus on the possibility that the central engine is a millisecond pulsar , in particular a highly magnetized pulsar or magnetar .",
    "we consider an engine which emits both an initial impulsive energy input @xmath3 as well as a continuous luminosity , the latter varying as a power law in the emission time . in this case",
    "a self - similar blast wave is expected to form at late times ( blandford & mckee , 1976 ) . the differential energy conservation relation for the self - similar blast wave can be written as @xmath4 , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the energy and time measured in the fixed frame . the first term @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are dimensionless constants , denotes the continuous luminosity injection , and the second term takes into account radiative energy losses in the blast wave . for @xmath10 ,",
    "an analytical solution is @xmath11 for @xmath12 ( cohen & piran 1999 ) . here",
    "@xmath13 is a characteristic timescale for the formation of a self - similar solution , which is roughly equal to the time for the external shock to start to decelerate , and @xmath3 is a constant which describes the impulsive energy input when @xmath14 .",
    "this is obtained under the assumption that a self - similar solution exists at @xmath12 , hence it can not be extrapolated down to @xmath15 .",
    "for @xmath12 the bulk lorentz factor of the fireball scales with time as @xmath16 , with @xmath17 and @xmath9 connected by @xmath18 ( cohen , piran & sari 1998 ) , and @xmath19 for the adiabatic case ( blandford & mckee 1976 ) .    in the observer frame the time @xmath20",
    "is related to the fixed frame @xmath6 ( for which @xmath21 ) by @xmath22 , and @xmath23 $ ] when @xmath24 .",
    "the differential energy conservation relation can be now expressed as @xmath25 , and the integrated relation is    ll e=()()^q t+e_imp()^- , & t > t_0 .",
    "[ e ]    here @xmath26 is the intrinsic luminosity of the central engine , @xmath27 $ ] where @xmath28 is the self - similar index for @xmath29 ( usually @xmath30 for the coasting phase ) , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 . since @xmath34 , the comparisons between @xmath35 and @xmath36 in the following discussions are equivalent to the comparisons between @xmath8 and @xmath37 ( cohen & piran 1999 ) .",
    "setting @xmath38 , the total energy at the beginning of the self - similar expansion is the sum of two terms , @xmath39 . the first term , for @xmath40 , is the accumulated energy from the continuous injection ( with radiative corrections ) before the self - similar solution starts ( note that for @xmath41 the two terms no longer have a clear physical meaning since the first one is negative ) .",
    "the second term , @xmath3 , is the energy injected impulsively by the initial event .    at different times the total energy of the blast wave given by eq.([e ] ) may be dominated either by the continuous injection term ( @xmath42 ) , or by the initial impulsive term ( @xmath43 . which of these two is dominant at a particular observation time @xmath20 depends both on the relative values of the two indices ( @xmath44 and @xmath45 , cohen & piran 1999 ) , _ and _ also on the values of @xmath46 and @xmath3 ( dai & lu 1998a , b ) .",
    "we then have three regimes : i ) if @xmath41 , the second term in ( [ e ] ) always dominates since the first term is negative .",
    "the fireball is then completely analogous to the impulsive injection case .",
    "ii ) if @xmath47 , the solution ( [ e ] ) is no longer valid , and there is no self - similar solution .",
    "iii ) if @xmath40 , the first term in ( [ e ] ) will eventually dominate over the second term after a critical time @xmath48 , and it is this term that will exert a noticeable influence on the grb afterglow light curves .",
    "this latter case is of the most interest here .    for a fireball blast wave decelerated by a homogeneous external medium with particle number density @xmath49 , the energy conservation equation at time",
    "@xmath50 is    ll e= r^3 n m_p c^2 ^2= ( ct)^3 n m_p c^2 ^2 , & t > t_0  ,    [ e  ] where @xmath51 is the radius of the blast wave , and all other symbols have their usual meanings .",
    "this relation holds also for more general cases with a non - constant @xmath5 . for the continuous injection dominated case",
    ", the energy @xmath5 in ( [ e  ] ) should have the same time dependence as the first term in the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ e ] ) , giving @xmath52 , or m= ,  ( q>-1- ) .",
    "[ m - q ] since in general @xmath53 and @xmath54 , using eq .",
    "( [ m - q ] ) the dynamics of the continuous injection - dominated case is    ll r^-(2-q)/2(2+q ) t^-(2-q)/8 , & rt^(2+q)/4  .",
    "for such a continuously - fed fireball , a forward shock propagating into the external medium and a reverse shock propagating back into the relativistic fireball will co - exist on either side of the contact discontinuity .",
    "the latter may persist as long as a significant level of energy injection is going on .",
    "the radiation spectra from these shocks are complicated by many factors .",
    "here we address only the simplest case of the standard adiabatic external shock afterglow scenario , and assume that the reverse shock is mildly relativistic , as in the refreshed shock scenario .",
    "following mszros & rees ( 1997 ) , kumar & piran ( 2000 ) and sari & mszros ( 2000 ) , one can work out the relationship between the temporal index @xmath55 and the spectral index @xmath56 , where @xmath57 . for the forward shock , the synchrotron peak - frequency @xmath58 , and the peak flux @xmath59 , so that @xmath60 . for the reverse shock , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 @xmath63 , so that @xmath64/8 $ ] . at any time",
    "the emission at a given frequency , may be dominated either by the forward or the reverse shock .",
    "the above scalings are derived for the slow cooling regime ( sari , piran & narayan 1998 ) , which is usually satisfied .",
    "the fast cooling will change the scaling laws , but does not change the qualitative `` index switching '' picture proposed in this paper .",
    "all the above scalings reduce to the standard adiabatic case by setting @xmath19 and @xmath65 .",
    "the injection - dominated regime begins at a critical time @xmath48 defined by equating the injection and energy loss terms in ( [ e ] ) , t_c = max\\{1,^1/(+q+1 ) } t_0 , [ tec ] where @xmath66 ensures that a self - similar solution has already formed when the continuous injection law dominates .",
    "if initially the continuous injection term is more important , i.e. , @xmath67 , then @xmath68 , and the dynamics is determined by the continuous injection law as soon as the self - similar profile forms . however , if initially the impulsive term dominates ( @xmath69 ) , the critical time @xmath48 after which the continuous injection becomes dominant could be much longer than @xmath70 , depending on the ratio of @xmath3 and @xmath71 .",
    "central engines with a continuous injection may , in addition , have another characteristic timescale @xmath72 , e.g. at which the continuous injection power law index ( say @xmath73 ) switches to a lower value @xmath74 .",
    "it is only for @xmath75 that the continuous injection has a noticeable effect on the afterglow light curve .",
    "different central engines may have different values of @xmath72 . in the following ,",
    "we investigate the conditions under which a continuous injection can influence the dynamics of the blast wave , and we consider the specific case of a millisecond pulsar as a central engine with a continuous injection following after the initial impulsive phase .",
    "although a wide range of grb progenitors lead to a black hole - debris torus system ( narayan , paczyski & piran 1992 ; woosley 1993 ; paczyski 1998 ; mszros , rees & wijers 1999 ; fryer , woosley & hartmann 1999 ) , some progenitors may lead to a highly - magnetized rapidly rotating pulsar ( e.g. usov 1992 ; duncan & thompson 1992 ; thompson 1994 ; yi & blackman 1998 ; blackman & yi 1998 ; kluniak & ruderman 1998 ; nakamura 1998 ; spruit 1999 ; wheeler et al .",
    "2000 ; ruderman , tao & kluniak 2000 ) . during the early stages of the evolution of these objects",
    ", the luminosity decay law could be very complicated .",
    "on the longer ( afterglow ) timescales that we are interested in , some short - term processes , such as the decay of the differential - rotation - induced toroidal magnetic field energy ( kluniak & ruderman 1998 ; ruderman et al .",
    "2000 ) , are no longer important , and the energy injection into the fireball may be mainly through electromagnetic dipolar emission .",
    "the spindown of the pulsar may also be influenced by gravitational radiation .",
    "assuming that the spindown is mainly due to electromagnetic ( em ) dipolar radiation and to gravitational wave ( gw ) radiation , the spindown law is @xmath76 ( shapiro & teukolsky 1983 ) , where @xmath77 and @xmath78 are the angular frequency and its time derivative , @xmath79 is the dipolar field strength at the poles , @xmath80 is moment of inertia , @xmath81 is stellar radius , @xmath82 is ellipticity of the neutron star .",
    "this equation can be solved for @xmath77 as a function of @xmath20 , with initial conditions @xmath83 , @xmath84 for @xmath85 .",
    "the decay solution @xmath86 includes both em and gw losses , but the corresponding energy input into the fireball will be due to the em dipolar emission only , i.e. @xmath87}/ { ( 6c^3)}$ ] , which usually will not be a simple power - law",
    ". however , at different times the spindown will be dominated by one or the other loss terms , and one can get approximate solutions . when em dipolar radiation losses dominate the spindown , we have @xmath88 , or approximately @xmath89 for @xmath90 , and @xmath91 for @xmath92 . here _ em= = 2.0510 ^ 3  s   i_45b_p,15 ^",
    "-2p_0,-3 ^ 2r_6 ^ -6 , [ teem ] is the characteristic time scale for dipolar spindown , @xmath93 , and @xmath94 is the initial rotation period in milliseconds .",
    "when gw radiation losses dominate the spindown , the evolution is @xmath95 where @xmath96 @xmath97 .",
    "gw spindown is important only when the neutron star is born with an initial @xmath98 ( e.g. usov 1992 ; blackman & yi 1998 ) . in such cases",
    "the ellipticity is large ( @xmath99 ) due to rotational instability , and the timescale for the gw - dominated regime is short , so that @xmath77 will be damped to below @xmath100 promptly in a time @xmath101{\\cal t}_{gw}$ ] .",
    "after @xmath102 , gw losses decrease sharply , and the spindown becomes dominated by the em losses .",
    "if the neutron star is born with @xmath103 , the spindown will be always in the em regime , since the typical spindown time for gw radiation is much longer .    for these regimes ,",

    "we discuss case ( a ) only , keeping in mind the possible extra complexity which case ( b ) may introduce in some extreme cases .    during the time interval @xmath120",
    "one can expect a distinctive pulsar feature to show up in the lightcurve .",
    "we take as an example the behavior ( [ leem ] ) , setting @xmath121 in this regime , and @xmath65 otherwise ( since the second slope @xmath122 would mimic in effect the standard impulsive @xmath65 , @xmath19 adiabatic case ) . for the slow - cooling external shock scenario (  2 ) , the temporal decay index changes at @xmath48 from @xmath123 to @xmath124 , and changes back to @xmath123 after @xmath105 .",
    "the temporal index is related to the spectral slope @xmath56 through @xmath125 for the forward shock , and @xmath126 for the reverse shock .",
    "this implies an _",
    "achromatic _ bump in the light curve , which could provide a signature for a pulsar .",
    "however , not all millisecond pulsars would give such observable signatures .",
    "the condition for detecting this feature is @xmath127 , which constrains the pulsar initial parameter phase space .",

    "this is the case considered in many pulsar grb central engine models ( usov 1992 ; duncan & thompson 1992 ; thompson 1994 ; spruit 1999 ) .",
    "we then have @xmath132 and @xmath133 ( a factor of 2 if the continuous injection and the prompt injection energies are comparable ) . solving @xmath134 ( in which @xmath30 has been adopted ) , where @xmath135 is the initial bulk lorentz factor of the blast wave",
    ", we have @xmath136 .",
    "the condition @xmath137 then implies b_p,15<18.4 p_0,-3 ^ 4/3 i_45 ^ 1/3 r_6 ^ -3 ( _ 0/300)^4/3n^1/6 .",
    "[ 1 ]    \\(ii ) @xmath130 is dominated by the impulsive term @xmath3 .",
    "this could be the case if the central engine is a pulsar , the initial impulsive grb fireball being due , e.g. to @xmath138 annihilation ( e.g. eichler et al 1989 ) , dissipation of initial differential rotation ( ruderman et al .",
    "2000 ) , phase conversion from a neutron star to a strange star ( dai & lu 1998b ) , etc . in this case , since @xmath139 , we have @xmath140 . the condition @xmath141 is simply @xmath142 , or p_0,-3<4.4",
    "i_45 ^ 1/2e_imp,51 ^ -1/2 . [ 2 ] since both @xmath105 and @xmath48 are large in this case , the continuous injection term may dominate at a later time .",
    "an additional constraint , to avoid rotational break - up of the pulsar , is p_0 > p_0(min )  . [",
    "3 ] the equations ( [ 1 ] ) , ( [ 2 ] ) and ( [ 3 ] ) define a region of the pulsar @xmath143 initial parameter space ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , inside which the continuous injection has the observational signature discussed above , i.e. a bump in the light curve .",
    "the separation between the two regimes ( i , ii ) is defined by the condition @xmath144 erg , or @xmath145 . above this line ( regime i ) , @xmath146 and one expects only one change , starting with the flat regime and changing to steep ; below this line ( regime ii ) one expects two changes , starting with the steep decay , followed by a flat regime , and a final resumption of the steep decay .",
    "if the central engine of grb are fast - rotating pulsars , the afterglow lightcurves may show a distinctive , achromatic feature , for pulsars whose initial parameters are within `` pulsar signature region '' region defined by equations ( [ 1 ] ) , ( [ 2 ] ) and ( [ 3 ] ) . in this case",
    "the afterglow light curves flatten after a critical time @xmath48 ( eq.[[tec ] ] ) , and steepen again after a time @xmath105 ( eq.[[teem ] ] ) .",
    "this region of pulsar parameter phase space includes  magnetars \" or ultra - high field pulsars , which play a large role in some grb pulsar progenitor models .",
    "the current data on early afterglows are insufficient to provide good tests for this feature . however , an interesting possibility is the achromatic bump observed in the afterglow of grb 000301c , which for a limited time deviates significantly from the standard broken power - law fit ( masetti et al .",
    "possible explanations include running into a non - uniform ambient density ( berger et al .",
    "2000 ) , and modification by a microlensing event ( garnavich , loeb & stanek 2000 ) .",
    "we suggest here a third possibility , that the bump may be caused by the pulsar signature discussed above . taking ( berger et al 2000 ) @xmath147 for the principal temporal index ( before the bump and before the decay ascribed to a jet transition )",
    ", the temporal index during the pulsar signature is expected to be @xmath148 , which seems reasonable to fit the achromatic bump . since the feature occurs a couple of days after the grb trigger , the initial pulsar parameters are in regime ii .",
    "taking @xmath149 from the observations ( berger et al . 2000 ) , the pulsar parameters follow from setting @xmath150 d and @xmath151 d , which gives @xmath152 ms and @xmath153 ( fig.1 ) . detailed @xmath154 fit to the data would be necessary to validate this proposal .",
    "another relevant observation may be the recent fe line detection in the x - ray afterglow of grb 991216 ( piro et al 2000 ) , which in one interpretation would require a continuously - injecting central engine ( rees & mszros 2000 ) .",
    "if @xmath155 is assumed 37 hours after the burst ( rees & mszros 2000 ) , this continued injection could be due to a pulsar with @xmath156 and @xmath157 ms , which would imply a signature bump at @xmath158 hour .",
    "such a bump is not seen in this afterglow ( e.g. halpern et al . 2000 ) .",
    "however , a slightly weaker luminosity ( e.g. @xmath159 ) could also explain the fe line features , by assuming a slightly larger fe abundance ( which is very low in this model ) .",
    "the required pulsar can therefore be more magnetized , and the characteristic times for the signature bump would be expected early enough to have evaded detection in this grb .    in conclusion , the detection of or upper limits on such characteristic afterglow bumps by missions such as _ hete2 _ or _ swift _ may be able to provide interesting constraints on magnetar grb models and their progenitors .",
