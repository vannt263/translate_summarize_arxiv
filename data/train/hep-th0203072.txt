    "the existence of classical field configurations exhibiting soliton - like properties is not only an interesting consequence of nonlinear effects in field theory , but also an important ingredient in the understanding of nonperturbative effects in particle physics @xcite .",
    "apart from one - dimensional kinks , examples of these structures in 3 + 1 dimensions include nontopological solitons ( nts ) @xcite and @xmath1 balls @xcite : in both cases , choosing a simple harmonic time - dependence for the scalar field allows one to obtain a static solution of the field equations , describing a spherically - symmetric configuration which , for a range of parameters , may be the lowest energy state .",
    "such configurations may be found in extensions of the standard model , supersymmetric or not , as has been suggested recently @xcite .",
    "they may be sufficiently stable as to allow for a quantization procedure and form a legitimate bound state ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "ntss and q - balls have also been of great interest to applications of particle physics to the early universe , often being proposed as possible candidates for dark matter @xcite .",
    "a time - dependent , long - lived , and localized configuration in 3 + 1 dimensional @xmath0 scalar field theory was re - discovered and thoroughly studied by one of us and collaborators some years ago @xcite .",
    "it was shown that these configurations , named in ref .",
    "@xcite `` oscillons , '' naturally arise from collapsing unstable spherically - symmetric bubbles in models with symmetric and asymmetric double - well potentials , being mainly characterized by a rapid oscillation of the field at the bubble s core .",
    "their relevant feature is that , albeit not strictly periodic , they possess a _ very _ long lifetime , of order @xmath2 ( @xmath3 in this work ) .",
    "oscillons may be thought of as the higher - dimensional cousins of one - dimensional breather states found from kink - antikink bound states @xcite .",
    "just as kink - antikink pairs may be thermally or quantum - mechanically nucleated through nonperturbative processes , so may oscillon states , although here the calculation must be done in real and not euclidean time .",
    "more recently , gleiser and sornborger investigated whether oscillons are present in 2 + 1 dimensions , finding not only that they do exist , but also that their lifetime is _ at least _ of order @xmath4 @xcite",
    ". motivated by this result , in the present paper we investigate two important related questions : first , if oscillons still appear during the collapse of _ asymmetric _  as opposed to symmetric  initial configurations ; and , second , if they are stable against small angular and radial fluctuations .",
    "since this implies that we will be dealing with a higher - dimensional parameter space , we restrict ourselves here to 2 + 1 dimensional oscillons . apart from being of interest in their own right , we expect that our results will be indicative of the behavior of 3 + 1 dimensional oscillons .",
    "we also note that it should be quite easy to build oscillons from more complicated field theories , including interactions between the `` oscillon '' field and other scalar or fermionic fields .",
    "the robustness of these configurations , as demonstrated here , should provide enough motivation for a careful search of such generalized oscillons ( and possibly more realistic ) in the near future .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . by means of a numerical scheme suited to tackle long - lived configurations ( described in the appendix ) , in sec .",
    "[ dynamics ] we show that oscillons quickly appear during the collapse of most elliptically deformed bubbles and , moreover , that they are _ all _ circularly symmetric and extremely long - lived , leaving no trace of the initial asymmetry .",
    "this suggests that oscillons can be understood as attractors in field - configuration space , ordered spatio - temporal structures that emerge during the nonlinear evolution of a wide variety of initial configurations .",
    "in fact , in 2 + 1 dimensions , the attractor basin is quite deep , as was initially hinted in ref .",

    "so far , all previous studies have obtained oscillons from symmetric initial configurations , with either thick or thin walls ( gaussian or tanh profiles , respectively ) .",

    "this notation allows us to construct angular averages and dispersions in a manner analogous to time averages .",
    "we therefore define the effective radial dispersion as the relative root - mean - square deviation from the average radius : @xmath35 as shown in figure [ fig : deltareff ] , the above quantity is indeed a good measure of asymmetry , i.e. it increases monotonically with @xmath13 .",

    "these can be observed here in the cases @xmath25 and @xmath45 .",
    "thus , oscillons do not always appear as the asymmetric configurations decays",

    "a crucial step not yet studied is the stability analysis against small but arbitrary asymmetric perturbations .",
    "the oscillon stability with regard to these perturbations is fundamental for the computation of quantum corrections around the classical solution @xcite and is the subject of the next session .",
    "our task now is to investigate whether symmetric oscillons are stable against small radial and angular perturbations @xmath64 , i.e. to probe the `` linear stability '' of the oscillon .",
    "we are unaware of any previous study where the stability of a field configuration with a time - dependent amplitude has been tested against small fluctuations .",
    "so far , stability investigations have been restricted to either time - independent configurations , such as bounce solutions @xcite , or to configurations with a linear time - dependence in the _ phase _ , such as @xmath1-balls @xcite ) .",
    "the stability analysis in these two situations is greatly simplified by the fact that the dynamical equation dictating the behavior of the fluctuations is separable into its spatial and temporal parts ; the resulting problem reduces to finding the eigenvalues @xmath65 of a time - independent operator ( an alternative approach based on the so - called `` bogomolnyi bound '' @xcite can also be applied in the time - independent case , see e.g. @xcite ) .",

    "the present problem , however , is not amenable to such treatment due to the anharmonic time - dependence of the oscillon ; we must consider both the space- and time - dependence of the background field , making the stability analysis of oscillon - type configurations considerably more challenging both analytically and numerically , as we will now discuss .    in order to appreciate these difficulties , let us write ( in polar coordinates ) the linearized equation of motion that follows from eq .",
    "( [ eqmotion ] ) through the substitution @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the symmetric oscillon solution and @xmath69 is the perturbation , i.e. , @xmath70 here one might be tempted to separate the variables as @xmath71 .",
    "however , the resulting equations show that one can not get rid of the simultaneous radial and temporal dependence of the background configuration , @xmath72 .",

    "a considerable simplification can nevertheless be accomplished by writing @xmath74 , isolating at least the angular part of the problem . performing such substitution",

    "this unavoidable limitation should be contrasted with the simpler case for time - independent background configurations based on a harmonic decomposition @xmath85 ( see e.g. @xcite ) , where the existence of exponentially unstable modes is clearly related to imaginary eigenvalues .",
    "however , we would like to point out a limitation of the spectral method that is often overlooked . by restricting the analysis to an exponential time - dependence , as in @xmath86 above",

    "fortunately , we shall shortly see that typical spectral instabilities ( such as that of the bounce ) do not require a long - time integration or a very wide search , being therefore bound to be observed through our method . before we do so , it is worth testing the reliability of the numerical implementation itself .",
