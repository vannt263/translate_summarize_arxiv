    "<S> we investigate @xmath0 transverse - momentum ( @xmath1 ) distributions and their centrality dependence in heavy - ion collisions at sps and rhic within the framework of a two - component model , which includes ( i ) primordial production coupled with various phases of dissociation , ( ii ) statistical coalescence of @xmath2 and @xmath3 quarks at the hadronization transition . </S>",
    "<S> the suppression of the direct component ( i ) is calculated by solving a transport equation for @xmath0 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 in an expanding fireball using momentum dependent dissociation rates in the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) . </S>",
    "<S> the coalescence component is inferred from a kinetic rate equation with a momentum dependence following from a blast wave approach . at sps energies , where the direct component dominates , the interplay of cronin effect and qgp suppression results in fair agreement with na50 @xmath1 spectra . at rhic energies , the @xmath1 spectra in central @xmath6+@xmath6 collisions </S>",
    "<S> are characterized by a transition from regeneration at low @xmath1 to direct production above . at lower centralities , </S>",
