    "astronomical observations show that galaxies have magnetic fields with a component that is coherent over a large fraction of the galaxy with field strengths of order @xmath0 gauss ( g ) ; see refs.@xcite and references therein .",
    "modeling the origin of these fields is a challenging problem . here",
    "we consider models in which the seed field is generated in the early universe , see , e.g. @xcite .",
    "there are a number of such models and different models result in different magnetic field structures .",
    "it is well known that quantum - mechanical fluctuations during inflation can generate energy - density inhomogeneities that seed observed large - scale structure , see , e.g. , ref .  @xcite .",
    "quantum - mechanical zero - point fluctuations can also generate a seed magnetic field , provided the relevant abelian gauge field is such that the lagrangian density is not conformally invariant during inflation @xcite . a seed magnetic field generated during inflation",
    "has a correlation length today that can be very much larger than the current hubble radius . a convenient phenomenological way of breaking conformal invariance during inflation is to couple the inflaton scalar field @xmath1 to the vector abelian gauge field by @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the vector field strength tensor and @xmath4 is a parameter @xcite .",
    "depending on the value of @xmath4 , this can result in a sufficiently large seed magnetic field to explain the observed galactic magnetic fields .",
    "this is a classically consistent model , with vector field back - reaction during inflation being negligibly small @xcite . while the abelian gauge field becomes strongly coupled at early times @xcite , this is not a problem for the effective , phenomenological , classical model , @xcite and also see @xcite",
    "of course , just as one does not reject the effective , phenomenological , classical `` standard '' @xmath5cdm cosmological model , one does not reject inflation - based seed magnetic field generation models for being quantum - mechanically inconsistent .",
    "rather , much as the case for @xmath5cdm , it is of great interest to understand how such a successful inflation - based seed magnetic field generation model might arise from a more fundamental underlying model or theory .",
    "there are a number of other seed field generation models ; see ref.@xcite for a discussion of seed field generation in hoava - lifshitz gravity .",
    "yet another interesting possibility is primordial magnetic field generation during a cosmological phase transition @xcite .",
    "if the phase transition takes place at late times the magnetic field correlation length is smaller than the hubble radius .    if the magnetic field was generated during or shortly after inflation ( during a pre- or re - heating phase transition ) , and survived to the epoch of recombination ( the last - scattering surface ) , it should leave observable signatures on the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation fluctuations , see ref.@xcite for a review and refs .",
    "@xcite for more recent discussions .    the shape and magnitude of a primordial magnetic field can be constrained observationally .",
    "magnetic field energy density scales like radiation ( i.e.  relativistic ) energy density .",
    "and the energy density of radiation @xmath6 is constant during cosmological evolution , if the primordial magnetic is not damped by mhd ( or other ) processes and so stays frozen into the plasma . ] during nucleosynthesis , any new form of radiation - like energy density is constrained observationally to be less than about @xmath7 of the usual radiation energy density .",
    "hence , agreement between the big bang nucleosythesis ( bbn ) model light nuclei abundance predictions and the observations yields a constraint on the primordial magnetic field energy density : @xmath8 @xcite . here",
    "@xmath9 is the current value of the magnetic field energy density parameter and @xmath10 is the current value of the hubble parameter in units of 100 km s@xmath11 mpc@xmath11 .",
    "naturally , this limit holds only if the primordial magnetic field was generated prior to or during nucleosynthesis .",
    "other constraints arise through the effects of a primordial magnetic field on the propagation of cmb photons ( faraday rotation of the cmb polarization @xcite , and magnetic field induced scalar , vector , and tensor modes of cmb anisotropies @xcite ) .",
    "available data limit the current value of a cosmological magnetic field to be less than about @xmath12 g for a scale - invariant or homogeneous primordial magnetic field .",
    "another interesting signature of a primordial magnetic field is relic gravitational waves generated by the anisotropic magnetic stress @xcite .",
    "the amplitude of the gravitational wave signal is determined by the efficiency of gravitational wave generation and the strength of the primordial magnetic field .",
    "the efficiency of gravitational wave production is small @xcite due to the small value of the newton constant @xmath13 in the coupling between the primordial magnetic field and the gravitational waves .",
    "however , a magnetic field that satisfies the bbn limit and that is generated during a strong - enough first - order phase transition can lead to a detectable signal for lisa .",
    "therefore , the direct measurement of the gravitational wave background can lead to an independent limit on a magnetic field generated in the early universe @xcite .    on large scales ,",
    "because of the high conductivity of the plasma in the early universe , the magnetic field is treated as a frozen - in field with its evolution determined by the simple dilution of magnetic field lines , @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the physical cosmic time and @xmath16 is the scale factor . in general , however , the evolution of a primordial magnetic field is a complex process influenced by mhd as well as by cosmological dynamics @xcite . in particular , the presence of a magnetic field can dramatically affect the behavior of primordial turbulence ( for example , turbulence associated with phase transition bubble motions ) @xcite .",
    "also , the presence of a magnetic field might itself lead to the development of turbulent motions , see refs .",

    "iii below .    in this paper",
    "we study the evolution of a primordial magnetic field that is coupled , through the mhd equations , with the fluid , during a cosmological phase transition .",
    "we consider two different possibilities : ( i ) when the magnetic field energy has been injected in the plasma with no initial vorticity perturbations ( no turbulent motions ) at a given typical scale ; and , ( ii ) when vorticity perturbations are present during the phase transition and couple to the magnetic field with a given spectrum . both these assumptions can be justified .",
    "the magnetic field might be generated prior to the phase transition , with the generation mechanism not requiring turbulent motion .",
    "on the other hand , the presence of initial turbulent motions can also be justified since bubble nucleation , expansion , and collisions can lead to primordial kinetic turbulence @xcite . of course",
    ", in reality both magnetic field and kinetic turbulence generation can take place together , while in our approach we assume the a priori presence of magnetic energy and/or kinetic energy during the phase transition .",
    "a causal , phenomenological description of mhd on large scales during the cosmological phase transition motivates a white noise spectrum for the magnetic spectral energy density , @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the wavenumber @xcite .",
    "a steeper batchelor spectrum with @xmath19 has been claimed to follow from cosmological causality and the divergenceless condition of the magnetic field @xcite . to understand the evolution of a cosmological magnetic field , and to be able to make observable predictions in this model ,",
    "it is important to resolve this impasse .",
    "one would like to know whether the final large - scale magnetic energy spectrum evolves to something steeper than white noise , or to a spectrum closer to the batchelor one .",
    "in fact , the mhd process itself might establish a different spectrum : the possibility of generating a random magnetic field from isotropic turbulence was first proposed by batchelor @xcite .",
    "he invoked the imperfect analogy between vorticity and magnetic fields that should generally imply a large scale distribution of the magnetic energy similar to the kinetic energy of turbulent motions @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "later , kazantsev @xcite was able to rigorously establish the possibility of small - scale dynamo action .",
    "he assumed that the velocity field varied only on large scales and found that weak magnetic fields are amplified mainly on the resistive scale .",
    "initially , this was thought to be applicable only to turbulence at large magnetic prandtl number @xcite , where the viscous cutoff scale is much larger than the resistive cutoff scale .",
    "kazantsev found that the magnetic energy spectrum increases with wavenumber like @xmath21 , which is slightly shallower than the white noise spectrum @xmath22 .",
    "the emergence of a kazantsev spectrum turned out to be much more ubiquitous and not only applicable at large magnetic prandtl number .",
    "simulations at magnetic prandtl numbers of order unity also clearly showed the kazantsev @xmath21 spectrum @xcite .",
    "such a spectrum could be of interest for primordial magnetic field evolution , because it implies somewhat larger power at large scales than white noise .",
    "the main goal of our paper is to determine , through mhd modeling , the evolution of the magnetic energy spectrum . to keep our study as general as possible",
    "we do not make any assumption about the physical process leading to primordial magnetic field generation .",
    "also , we do not address the phase transition physics itself , keeping the total magnetic field energy density @xmath23 as a free parameter whose maximal value is fixed by the bbn bound .",
    "obviously , if the magnetic field is generated during a phase transition , @xmath23 will depend sensitively on the amount of latent heat that is transformed to magnetic energy , i.e.  on the efficiency of the magnetic field generation process .",
    "one important issue addressed here is to determine the spectral shape of the magnetic field at large scales , assuming that magnetic energy and vorticity perturbations are closely coupled during the phase transition .",
    "another important question is related to the duration of mhd turbulence and how long it takes to reach equipartition between kinetic and magnetic energy densities in the primordial plasma .",

    "we employ natural units with @xmath24 and gaussian units for electromagnetic quantities . to properly account for the expansion of the universe we use comoving quantities with conformal time @xmath15 that is related to physical time @xmath25 as @xmath26 during the radiation dominated epoch .",
    "we assume that magnetic energy is generated at the electroweak or qcd phase transition , or during inflation . in the first case magnetic energy",
    "is explicitly injected into the fluid on small length scales , smaller than the hubble length at the moment of the phase transition . if the magnetic field originated at an earlier epoch of inflation the length scale at which the magnetic field interacts with the fluid",
    "is set by the characteristic length scale of the system , and is again smaller than the hubble radius . in the absence of magnetic or kinetic helicity",
    "we do not expect an inverse cascade ( i.e. , energy flow from smaller to larger length scales ) .      to model magnetic field evolution one needs to know the physical conditions during the phase transition .",
    "first , generation of turbulence requires a first - order phase transition so that at the critical temperature of the phase transition bubbles of the new vacuum nucleate within the false vacuum . bubble collisions then generate turbulent motions .",
    "the standard electroweak model does not have a first - order phase transition  @xcite , and can not account for baryogenesis .",
    "however , modifications of the standard model , such as the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm )  @xcite , result in first - order electroweak phase transitions and can account for baryogenesis  @xcite . also , recent lattice qcd computations @xcite have not yet excluded that the qcd phase transition is a first - order one , with bubble nucleation and collisions .",
    "the main parameter characterizing turbulent motions is the r.m.s.velocity @xmath27 which determines the kinetic energy density of the turbulence .",
    "obviously , @xmath27 depends sensitively on the phase transition physics , and in particular on the phase transition bubble wall expansion velocity @xmath28 , @xcite . to model the development of turbulent motions during the phase transition we adapt earlier analytical or semi - analytical results @xcite",

    "also , partial equipartition , @xmath42 , is reached in the case where the magnetic field was generated first at the injection scale , which then led to rapid growth of vorticity perturbations in the initially no - turbulent plasma .",

    "simulations show that equipartition between kinetic and magnetic energies is sustained throughout the free decay stage of the turbulence .",
    "therewith , at any given point in time , the kinetic energy spectrum peaks at the same wave - number as the magnetic energy spectrum .",
    "however , it seems that properties of the turbulent states developed through free decay depend on the method of their generation . the power spectrum of the turbulence developed after injection of a single - mode magnetic field energy peaks at @xmath148 , while injection of kinetic energy into an existing magnetic configuration leads to a turbulent state with power spectrum peaking at @xmath149 .",
    "hence , it seems that , in general , the characteristic length scale of the turbulence is sensitive to the initial driver : kinetic drivers result in smaller - scale turbulence states as compared to the case of magnetic field drivers .",
    "in this paper we have presented results from direct numerical simulations of primordial magnetic field evolution during cosmological phase transitions .",
    "these simulations account for the expansion of the universe .",
    "simulations were performed to model two different stages of primordial magnetic field evolution , the first stage when phase transition processes drive turbulence , and the second stage when free decay occurs .",
    "we show that different types of initial conditions ( drivers ) lead to rapid development of a turbulent state close to equipartition . during the following stage we model the free decay of these turbulence configurations .",
    "we study the development during this free decay stage and analyze characteristic parameters of the slowly varying power spectrum of the turbulence .",
    "we assume that the properties of the turbulence configurations modeled in our numerical experiments are similar to those of cosmological primordial turbulence .",
    "our simulations allow us to estimate the spectral indices of the large - scale distribution of the kinetic and magnetic field energies in developed turbulence .",
    "it seems that the final configuration of primordial magnetic field depends on the initial conditions that must be determined by the phase transition physics . on the other hand",
    ", the kinetic energy density of the developed state does not retain any information about the initial conditions and hence is not sensitive to the details of the phase transition .",
    "the spectral index of the kinetic energy at large scales can be well approximated as 2 ( white noise spectrum ) , while the magnetic energy density spectral index ranges between 2 and 4 depending on the initial conditions .",
    "similar spectral indices for the large - scale magnetic field are well established for laboratory turbulence , see ref .",
    "note that simulations in a finite periodic domain may suffer from the fact that originally disconnected and causally independent regions come into causal contact within one box turnover time , which , based on the scale of the domain , is @xmath150 .",
    "for the case shown in fig .",
    "[ evolution ] , this time is about @xmath120 , but the effective time can be even shorter owing to the effects of acoustic and alfvn waves .",
    "our numerical results allow us to estimate typical time - scales for decaying free turbulence .",
    "it seems that cosmological turbulence decays slightly slower then classical grid turbulence in laboratory experiments .",
    "although we took a rather small damping wavenumber , we can not expect the establishment of a kolmogorov - like spectrum at small scales .",
    "we see a fast decorrelation of turbulence at small scales .",
    "we note that the phenomenological approaches developed in refs .",
    "@xcite imply a fast kraichnan - like decorrelation of turbulence .",
    "consequently , only the large - scale or peak - scale magnetic field results may have cosmological significance and contribute observable signatures , such as gravitational wave generation and/or cmb anisotropy production .",
    "we have considered the case of non - helical turbulence .",
    "the presence of weak initial helicity can significantly change the development of turbulence .",
    "this is because magnetic helicity is a conserved quantity in the limit of large magnetic reynolds numbers and can inverse cascade to larger scales @xcite , which could be cosmologically significant .",
    "this process has been confirmed through numerous simulations @xcite .",
    "summarizing , we find that the generation of a magnetic field at phase transition scales will lead to the development of turbulent motions , and , in the case of the electroweak phase transition , this turbulence has an observable signature in the form of a gravitational wave signal .",
    "we appreciate useful discussions with l. kisslinger , a. kosowsky , k.  subramanian , and t.  vachaspati .",
