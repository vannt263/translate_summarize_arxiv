    "in @xcite the authors of the current work presented a cosmological background in a spatially flat friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) universe whose dynamics was characterized by the raychauduri equation @xmath8 where @xmath9 ( @xmath10 is the hubble rate of the flrw universe ) was a linear function in @xmath10 before the phase transition and after the phase transition it became quadratic in @xmath10 . in summary , the model realized three fold properties : ( i ) the linear part prevented the big bang singularity in finite cosmic time although it was geodesically past incomplete , ( ii ) the phase transition was essential to produce enough particles to reheat the universe and the universe went through a deflationary period for a sufficient time , and finally ( iii ) the quadratic part had a fixed point that became responsible for the current acceleration of the universe .",
    "what was worth interesting of that background is that it comes from a quintessential potential , whose inflationary part was a higgs - style potential and the quintessential part reads an exponential potential .",
    "however , the model has some undesired features such as , it provides a reheating temperature in the mev regime , although it does not contradict the nucleosynthesis success since this needs a very low temperature , and the worse thing in the model is that , since the theoretical value of the running is far from the corresponding observational mean value obtained by planck s team , thus , comparing the theoretical results provided by this model with planck 2013 and planck 2015 observational data @xcite when the running is not allowed , one can show that the model has to be disregarded .",
    "however , we found that the existing disparities in @xcite can be defeated in a family of models in this flat flrw background which has the same feature as in @xcite but in an improved manner .",
    "hence , in this sequel we propose a family of backgrounds whose dynamics before the phase transition is governed by the raychaudhuri equation @xmath11 with @xmath12 $ ] and @xmath13 is any real number .",
    "this family provides an inflationary quintessential potential whose inflationary part is basically a power law potential and the quintessential potential is governed by a cosmological constant .",
    "further , the models of this family are nonsingular in nature . in other words , although the models are geodesically past incomplete but they do not encounter with any finite time past singularity , i.e. big bang . also , the models provide a complete analytic background similar to @xcite .",
    "further , due to presence of the power law potential , the models provide a greater reheating temperature in the gev or tev regime depending on the value of the parameter @xmath14 .",
    "moreover , for some values of this parameter the models match correctly with planck 2013 @xcite and planck 2015 data @xcite without allowing the running , which indeed is an interesting and notable point in the present family of models .    the manuscript is organized as follows : in section [ model ] , we introduce the family of backgrounds and discuss its properties . in section [ scalar - field ] , we establish that the dynamics governed by the model could be mimicked by a single scalar field whose potential is a combination of a power law potential , and a cosmological constant .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the study of cosmological perturbations showing that the theoretical results provided by our models fit well with current observed data @xcite .",
    "the reheating process via gravitational particle production of heavy massive particles is studied in section 5 , where we show that our family of models provide a reheating temperature in the gev and tev regime depending on the value of the parameter @xmath14 .",
    "a detailed calculation of the number of @xmath15-fold is performed in section 6 . in section 7",
    "we compare our new family of models with the model proposed in our previous work @xcite . finally in section 8",
    "we have summarized our results .",

    "we start with the following dynamical equation @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a specific value of the hubble parameter , @xmath19 is a positive cosmological constant and @xmath12 $ ] is the parameter which defines the family of models under consideration .",
    "now , equation ( [ dynamics ] ) can analytically be solved leading to the following backgrounds :    1 .",
    "for @xmath20 the hubble parameter is given by @xmath21 and thus , the scale factor can be solved as @xmath22 } & t\\leq 0\\\\        a_e \\left(\\frac{3h_e}{\\sqrt{3\\lambda}}\\sinh(\\sqrt{3\\lambda } t)+\\cosh(\\sqrt{3\\lambda } t)\\right)^{\\frac{1}{3 } } & t\\geq 0 .",

    "when @xmath39 , the eos parameter satisfies @xmath40 ( kination or deflationary period @xcite ) , and finally , for @xmath41 one also has @xmath38 ( late quasi de sitter period ) .",
    "moreover , when one considers the approximation @xmath42 , the equation of state becomes @xmath43 where @xmath44 , @xmath45 are respectively the energy density and the pressure of the cosmic fluid and @xmath46 is the energy density of the universe at @xmath47 .",
    "in particular ,    1 .   for @xmath48 , the equation of state becomes @xmath49 2 .   for @xmath20 ,",
    "the equation of state takes the form @xmath50",
    "it is evident from equations ( [ eos1 ] ) and ( [ eos2 ] ) that at early times , our family of backgrounds satisfies @xmath51 , that means our universe was quasi de sitter in nature . since the dynamics of the early accelerating phase is well realized via a scalar field prescription , hence it is very natural to ask whether an equivalence between the family and the scalar field dynamics exists or not . if such an equivalence exists then we need to confirm their viability with the observational data , that means essentially we aim to check whether the family of models could lead to a power spectrum of cosmological perturbations that fit well with the current observational data @xcite . to do so , in the flat flrw universe , if we represent the energy density and the pressure by the notations @xmath52 , @xmath53 , respectively , then they assume the following simplest forms @xmath54    now , using eq .",

    "conversely , one can express the hubble rate in terms of the field as @xmath60    the potential is given by @xmath61 then , for our family one has @xmath62    that is ,    @xmath63 & \\varphi\\leq \\varphi_e\\\\            \\lambda m_{pl}^2 & \\varphi\\geq \\varphi_e .",

    "now , to study the cosmological perturbations , one needs to introduce the slow roll parameters @xcite @xmath65 which allow us to calculate the associated inflationary parameters , such as , the spectral index ( @xmath1 ) , its running ( @xmath3 ) , and the ratio of tensor to scalar perturbations ( @xmath2 ) defined below @xmath66 where the star ( @xmath67 ) means that the quantities are evaluated when the pivot scale crosses the hubble radius .",
    "now , for our family of models , the above inflationary parameters assume the following values @xmath68 where @xmath69 .",
    "now , let us remark the following :    for potentials of the form @xmath70 , and using that    @xmath71 one also obtains that @xmath72 , which means that our family of potentials , during the inflationary regime , are like power law potentials    the number of @xmath15-folds is given by @xmath73 then , in terms of the number of @xmath15-folds one has @xmath74    from this last formula and due to the large value of the number of @xmath15-folds , one can see that the running is of the same order as @xmath75 .",
    "then , it is clear that its theoretical value is far smaller than the central value of the best fit obtained by planck s team ( see for instance table 5 of @xcite ) , and as a consequence to check the viability of our models we have to consider the 2-dimensional marginalized confidence level in the plane @xmath5 without the presence of running provided by planck s team .",
    "moreover , it is important to realize that in quintessential inflation , the number of @xmath15-folds is greater than the @xmath15-folds for inflationary potentials with a deep well @xcite . for this reason , here",
    "we have drawn the curves from @xmath76 to @xmath77 .",

    "now , since the energy density of the background decays as @xmath105 ( i.e. deflationary regime ) , eventually the energy density of the relativistic plasma will dominate and the universe will become reheated .    here , as in @xcite , we consider the thermalization process , where the cross section for @xmath106 scattering with gauge bosons exchange whose typical energy is @xmath107 , is given by @xmath108 , with @xmath109 .",

    "in section @xmath172 of our previous work @xcite , we introduced the following dynamical system : @xmath173 where @xmath174 is the model parameter and the phase transition occurs at @xmath175 .",
    "we note that this background originally comes from the following quintessential higgs - style potential @xmath176 in which @xmath177    it has been shown in @xcite that due to the gravitational production of heavy massive particles , the reheating temperature belongs in the mev regime .",
    "this is due to the fact that the second derivative of the hubble parameter is continuous and the third one is discontinuous at the transition time .",
    "however , for the family of models described by the sole parameter @xmath6 $ ] , the second derivative of the hubble parameter is discontinuous at the transition phase what leads to a reheating temperature in the gev or tev regime .",
    "moreover , during the inflationary period , the higgs - style potential has the same behavior as a quartic one ( i.e. the model with @xmath178 ) , which means that it does not match with planck 2015 data ( see figure @xmath78 ) . on the contrary , for our new family of models ,",
    "if one takes @xmath7 , the corresponding models match at @xmath79 c.l . with planck 2013 and planck 2015 without allowing the running .",
    "it is one of the main results of the present work which proves the potentiality of the current family of models in compared to our earlier work @xcite .",
    "the current work offers a sequel of our previous work @xcite with a significant improvement in compared to its mathematical simplicity , and in agreement with the very latest observational data .",
    "let us demonstrate the main improvements by comparing the previous model @xcite with the current one and finally the need of this sequel .    in @xcite",
    "a simple unified cosmological model was proposed having ( i ) an inflationary period described by a higgs type potential , ( ii ) a sudden phase transition from the inflationary phase to the deflationary phase , which results in the production of massive particles , hence the universe begins to reheat , after that , it successively enters into the radiation and matter dominated eras , and finally , ( iii ) a quintessential stage explained by an exponential potential . additionally , although the model was geodesically past incomplete , but it did not encounter any big bang singularity in the finite cosmic time .",
    "so , essentially , we realized a singularity free cosmological model unifying the early inflationary epoch with the current cosmic acceleration by only a single scalar field whose potential is a combination of higgs potential and an exponential one .",
    "also , the model provided an complete analytic background which thus was helpful to calculate the associated cosmological parameters .",
    "we found that the model only agrees with the planck 2013 data @xcite in presence of running , however , as we have already discussed , the model does not match with the planck s observational data without the presence of running .",
    "but in the present work we provide an improved version of @xcite which is potential and worthy for further discussions .",
    "here we propose a family of new cosmological models described by a sole parameter @xmath6 $ ] which provides a complete picture of our universe via a single scalar field as in @xcite .",
    "the current family of models have ( i ) an inflationary phase described by a power law potential , ( ii ) a sudden phase transition from inflationary regime to the deflationary regime , hence beginning of reheating , consequently , successive radiation , matter dominated eras , and finally ( iii ) the models enter into the current accelerating phase responsible by the cosmological constant .",
    "in addition to that , the family of models are nonsingular in nature , i.e. they do not predict any finite cosmic time big bang singularity , but are geodesically past incomplete .",
    "that means similar to @xcite the present family of models also unifies the inflationary epoch with the current accelerating phase by a combination of a power law potential and a cosmological constant . in particular ,",
    "the inflationary power law potentials are recognized by the models with @xmath179 , @xmath180 , @xmath78 , as quadratic , cubic and quartic potentials in which for the observable modes , the universe inflates respectively for a number of 67 , 68 , and 69 @xmath15-folds .",
    "another interesting point in the family of models is that the reheating temperature could reach the gev or tev regime depending on the value of the sole parameter `` @xmath14 '' unlike in the previous model @xcite where the reheating temperature belongs in the mev regime .",
    "finally , we found that a large number of models having @xmath181 match both planck 2013 and planck 2015 data at 2@xmath182 c.l . without the need of running , which does not happen with the model presented in @xcite .",
    "summarizing , the current family of models describes a simple nonsingular inflationary quintessential analytic cosmological models , providing a greater reheating temperature in the gev / tev regime , and a large number of models belonging to this family are in excellent agreement with the planck 2015 data without allowing the running , and hence it reports a significant improvement of @xcite .",
