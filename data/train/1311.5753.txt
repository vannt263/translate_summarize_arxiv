    "for one - and - half decade , physicists have been intensively studying structural and topological properties of complex networks @xcite ( and refs . therein ) in order to understand the mechanisms responsible for the evolution of real - world complex systems and their miscellaneous consequences . arguably , one of the most exclusive among these , is the condensation phenomenon , together with a @xmath0-transition ( or temporal @xmath0-peak ) associated with this phenomenon  which hitherto have never been observed in a real - world network @xcite . by the term ` temporal @xmath0-peak '",
    "we understand here the temporal shape of a short - range order parameter ( or other parameters , e.g. of higher order , such as network characteristics ) resembling the greek letter @xmath0 .",
    "this terminology is in analogy to the @xmath0-peak of the heat capacity vs. temperature formed by the @xmath0-transition between the normal i @xmath1he and superfluid ii @xmath1he components .",
    "this analogy is developed further in the text . here",
    ", we demonstrate the first evidence for such a real - life condensation phenomenon with an associated @xmath0-transion , together with a preceeding phase of nucleation growth .",
    "furthermore , we here investigate in empirical and phenomenological ways , a complete phase diagram for these intriguing dynamic phase transitions in real - world complex networks .",
    "variety of complex network models show the phenomenon of condensation , where a finite fraction of structural elements in the network ( edges , triangles , etc . )",
    "turn out to be aggregated into an ultra compact sub - graph ( e.g. a star - like structure of edges ) , having size distinctly smaller than the size of the network @xcite ( and refs . therein ) , yet sufficiently large strongly to dominate all other local structures present in this network .",
    "it is particularly convenient to measure this size using a mean occupation layer ( mol ) , introduced by onnela - chakraborti - kaski - kertsz @xcite for study of the s&p 500 index in the vicinity of black monday ( october 19 , 1987 ) and also in the vicinity of the currency crisis in january 1 , 1998 . in this context",
    ", mol can play the role of a temporal short - range order parameter sufficiently sensitive to the local structure of a complex network @xcite .    in this work we consider empirical , undirected , canonical minimal spanning tree ( mst ) being of a correlation based network of assets returns , where multiple connections and loops are not allowed @xcite and the number of vertices , @xmath2 , and edges , @xmath3 ,",
    "are fixed .",
    "for such a network , the inter - node distance is defined as @xmath4 , for any pair of vertices .",
    "other popular metrics were also used for comparison ; however , the obtained results are practically undistinguishable within the resolution considered in our work . although we verified in an empirical way , that during the mst evolution only the positive correlations participate in its construction , the transformation from the pearson s correlation coefficient , @xmath5 , to distance , @xmath6 , was necessary , because the correlation coefficient does not obey the axioms of a metric ( or even axioms of a subdominant ultrametric distance @xcite ) .",
    "this verification was made at each time step after the construction of a temporal mst network from a complete empirical graph .",
    "we had the opportunity to compare @xmath3 temporal mst correlation based distances with all @xmath7 ones , which also contain several anti - correlation based distances .",
    "however , we can consider our temporal msts as compact ones as the covariance matrix is in our case only positive and semi - definite @xcite ( and refs .",
    "therein ) .",
    "furthermore , we expect that other correlation based networks , e.g. such as the threshold networks and hierarchical networks , will give very similar results , if the threshold value and the number of hierarchy levels are assumed to be sufficiently realistic quantities @xcite ( and refs .",
    "therein ) .    in spite of the algorithmic simplicity of the mst construction , the dynamics of mst network is still puzzling at microscales @xcite , because relocation of edges ( links ) during the evolution of the mst network , potentially involves a rearrangement of the entire graph .",
    "this defines the nonseparability feature , which makes the granger causality analysis inadequate for the identification of causation between variables represented as time - series @xcite . as such",
    ", this evolution is indeed a collective phenomena @xcite , where only the algorithmic ( and not an analytic ) recipe defines the network s single time - step transformation .",
    "we develop ( by neglecting fluctuations , cf .",
    "viii.1 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) such a phenomenological description , where the network rearrangement is derived from , and formally equivalent to the phenomenological ` macroscopic ' evolution equations , where the transition probabilities involved are verified in both semi - analytical and empirical ways .",
    "a ` microscopic ' , qualitative explanation of the nucleation and condensation processes involved , were formulated through a detailed observation and analysis of the evolution of the mst network on the properly prepared sequence of snapshot frames ( i.e. a ` movie ' ) , where active nodes and edges were suitably marked to make systematic tracing possible .",
    "we demonstrate a diachronic @xcite approach to condensation , complementary to those considered by albert - barabsi @xcite ( and refs . therein ) and dorogovtsev - goltsev - mendes @xcite ( and refs .",
    "therein ) .",
    "that is , we focus on the birth and on the death of condensation as dynamic phenomena , which occur as a result of the dynamic @xmath0-transition , between two non - equilibrium states of a complex network .",
    "this leads to the condensate , which arises as a temporal superstar - like structure .",
    "this structure is manifested in a form of a temporal singularity of the maximal vertex degree defining the dynamic @xmath0-peak , where both its sides diverge logarithmically . at this time",
    "we believe , this is the first work confirming a birth and a death of a condensate , manifested through the temporal @xmath0-peak , in a real - world complex network representing dynamic phenomena on a stock market .",
    "the condensation process is preceded by the nucleation growth entered by the mst network as a result of the continuous state transition from the equilibrium phase .",
    "as usual , the equilibrium state is defined by the detailed balance conditions ( dbc )  they are valid for the background of vertex degrees , further also referred to as the market ` plankton ' .",
    "the power law distribution observed , of these plankton degrees  not exceeding a dozen or so , is considered as the equilibrium distribution .",
    "for the initial , equilibrium state , all vertices obey this dbc criterion , while for the non - equilibrium states we trade with two kinds of ` fluids '  the equilibrium background ( the basic fluid ) and giant fluctuations of few vertex degrees ( an ` excited ' fluid ) consisting of few remaining vertices exhibiting giant fluctuations of their degrees .",
    "we foresee that our results containing universal aspects , complementary in nature to those in ref .",
    "@xcite ( and refs . therein ) , will provide a new impact to the modeling of dynamic structural and topological phase transitions and critical phenomena on financial markets @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ section : phamst ] the main goal is defined together with a systematic presentation of our empirical results , constituting a basis for the phenomenological considerations following in the two subsequent sections [ section : keqpoor ] and [ section : meszg ] .",

    "[ section : keqpoor ] the dynamics of poor vertices obeying a separability principle @xcite is studied , while sec . [",
    "section : meszg ] concerns the complex critical dynamics of the richest vertex , as a reminiscence of network complexity . in sec .",
    "[ section : sumconcl ] we discuss and summarize our results as well as highlight the most significant phenomenon found in the evolution of the mst network as a simple but sufficiently realistic and complex reference one .",
    "we take into account , as a representative example of complex network dynamics , the evolution  in daily and weekly horizons  of the most liquid number of survived companies , @xmath8 , quoted on the frankfurt stock exchange ( fse ) during the particularly significant and intriguing period of large fse variability .",
    "full time series which we use begins at 2004 - 03 - 22 ( monday ) and finishes at 2011 - 12 - 30 ( friday ) .",
    "however , since we use the optimal scanning window of 400 trading days width , the centre of the scanning window scans a shorter time series  from 2004 - 12 - 27 ( monday ) to 2011 - 03 - 25 ( friday ) , still containing the recent worldwide financial market crisis and crash ( for details , please refer to the quotation plots of the salzgitter ( szg ) ag - stahl und technologie company and the dax in fig .",
    "[ figure : dax_szg ] , as well as the underlying plots in our earlier paper @xcite ) .",
    "these @xmath9 survived companies define the fse basis  hence , we can consider the total numbers of mst vertices and edges as conserved ( non - fluctuating ) quantities .",
    "seemingly , the methodology used in this work and based on conserved quantities , appeared to be quite different from that used in our earlier works @xcite , where number of the most liquid companies fluctuate by a few percent from time to time .",
    "nevertheless , the results obtained with both methodologies are essentially indistinguishable within the assumed resolution , from those provided in the figures contained in this work .",
    "more precisely , we only observed that the absolute mol s minimum is now located at 2005 - 01 - 25 ( thursday ) instead of two trading days later , i.e. at 2007 - 01 - 29 ( monday ) .",
    "presumably , this small shift is due to sensitivity of the mol which is much greater than the mean tree length @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that , the logarithm of the mean occupation layer resembles nonequilibrium entropy of a complex network ( compare plots presented in figs .",
    "[ figure : entropy_deg_eff ] and [ figure : mols ] ) , which helps to identify the temporal key vertices in the complex network @xcite .",
    "we apply the mst technique to investigate transient behavior of a complex network during its evolution from a scale - free topology representing the initial equilibrium stock market hierarchical structure , long before the recent worldwide financial crash @xcite  its typical structure is presented in fig .",

    "[ figure : ze_16 ]  [ figure : zep_558 ] have essentially different but quite typical modular structures .",
    "the central element of the structure presented in fig .",
    "[ figure : ze_16 ] is the two - node core ( consisting of dbk and alv companies of degrees greater than ten ) .",
    "the structure presented in fig .",
    "[ figure : zep_402 ] is the superstar - like one centered at the szg vertex ( having degree greater than ninety , i.e. much greater than degrees of all other nodes ) , which later takes the modular structure shown in fig .",
    "[ figure : zep_558 ] .",
    "this latter structure consists of two well - separated parts : the first , single - core one centered at the szg node ( having degree equals twenty eight ) and the second , three - core structure , where separated cores are centered at gbf , cbk , and alv nodes ( of degrees greater than fifteen ) .",
    "however , this is with only a little szg predominance  the vice - leader , gbf company , has already degrees equals twenty two .",
    "more precisely , the current mst network is strongly decentralized , consisting of several ( at the moment of seven ) well distinguished clusters .",
    "indeed , such a structure is typical for the mst network after the entropies , mhsd and mol reach their respective minima ( see for details figs . [",
    "figure : entropy_deg_eff ]  [ figure : mols ] , respectively ) still placed at the same day , while during the time lag the leader position is exchangeably occupied by different companies .    , as seven vertices are coming off the power law , although , the szg company still occupies the leader position .",

    "this difference has no noticeable influence on any of our results therefore , we use both .    the structural and topological phase transitions , similar to those considered in the present work , we also found on the warsaw stock exchange ( wse )  a complex network of 274 companies , quoted on the wse throughout the period in question . here",

    "however , all of them suggest : ( i ) very significant role of the mol in study of the mst evolving structure and ( ii ) the appearance of a distinct absolute minimum of the mol , which can be considered to be a significant precursor of a crash",
    ". indeed , the thrilling consequence of our work would be practically to verify this conjecture and its far - reaching consequences .",
    "here we theoretically consider _ a posteriori _ , the illuminating and surprising , yet universal emergent properties of the continuous phase transition from the equilibrium scale - free mst network to the non - equilibrium nucleation preceding the condensation of edges forming a @xmath0-transition .",

    "the main goal of our work is to show , that the superhub forms a temporal structural condensate on a real - life financial market .",
    "subsequently , we aim to present the transition of the @xmath0-type from this condensate to scale - invariant topology decorated by the hierarchy of local star - like hubs , representing the market structure and topology directly after the worldwide financial crash . to observe and analyze the above mentioned temporal structure of evolving complex network we use sufficiently sensitive characteristics , for instance , the order parameters presented in figs .",

    "[ figure : ze_16 ] .",
    "it is characterized by the power law distribution of its vertex degrees ( driven by exponent @xmath16 ) .",
    "apparently , there is no vertex located off the power law ( except for the first less important boundary case as a result of a finite size effect ) .",
    "indeed , the mst network equilibrium states ( or the equilibrium phase ) are defined by    * detailed balance conditions ( [ rown : currentout0 ] ) and ( [ rown : currentin0 ] ) , hence , * by the properly suited transition probabilities given by eqs .",
    "( [ rown : trdegreed ] ) and ( [ rown : finaltrans ] ) , together with , * the sojourn probabilities ( [ rown : normhk ] ) , where time - independent equilibrium power law distributions of vertex degrees used , are governed by the average exponent @xmath94 ( for details see fig .",
    "[ figure : mean_alpha ] ) .    the agreement of these transition and sojourn probabilities with their empirical counterparts is well established ( cf .",
    "[ figure : deg_ch_prob-1 ] for details ) .",
    "furthermore , the results plotted in fig .",
    "[ figure : deg_ch_prob-1 ] are generally valid for the ` fluid ' of vertices having degrees not exceeding a dozen or so , and not only for the mst network in equilibrium . in other words , they are valid for any sub - periods , since the remaining non - equilibrium ` fluid ' is well separated , as it consists of at most few vertices having much larger degrees , coming off the equilibrium power law ( see , e.g. , fig .",
    "[ figure : zep_341 ] for details ) .",
    "hence , the two - fluid modeling of the mst network evolution is supported , in a crude analogy to the ii @xmath1he superfluidity .",
    "the considerations of subsequent sub - periods were based on the amazing observation that the peripheral szg company became a dominant one , barely within two trading days 2005 - 08 - 11/12 ( thursday / friday ) and 2005 - 08 - 12/15 ( friday / monday ) , which results in the critical - like change of the mst structure ( see figs .",

    "[ figure : oba_zbocza ] and [ figure : kondensat_day ] for the corresponding phase diagrams ) .",

    "[ figure : oba_zbocza ] , [ figure : oba_zbocza_week ] , [ figure : kondensat_day ] , and [ figure : kondensat ] , where the first critical point at @xmath122[td]@xmath252005 - 08 - 11 ( denoted by the blue dashed vertical line ) is well seen .",
    "notably , the dependence obtained from our deterministic coarse - grain ( macroscopic ) eq .",
    "( [ rown : genericdeq ] ) in the form @xmath156 valid both for @xmath23 and @xmath155 vs. @xmath19 , is a continuous one even at @xmath157 , although its derivative diverges at the critical point .",
    "therefore , we can say that this is a reminiscent of the dynamical structural continuous ( at least of the 2nd order ) phase transition .",
    "this is a transition between the scale - invariant network in equilibrium present for @xmath158 ( as discussed above ) and the non - equilibrium phase of the complex network present for @xmath159[td]@xmath252006 - 01 - 30 , where @xmath160 is denoted in figs .",

    "the non - equilibrium phase is characterized by the nucleation process of edges coalesced by the dominant szg superhub .",
    "this process ( a slow mode or slow growth law ) can be considered for @xmath30 ( the solid green curves , the green curve , corresponding to exponent @xmath30 , runs initially slightly above the second green curve concerning @xmath161 , but finally it runs below .",
    "] in both figures ) as related to the lifshitz - slyozov canonical process of a droplet growth @xcite as characterized by the same dynamical ( growth law ) exponent although , we deal here with a non - conserved dynamics , but at a fixed total number of vertices and edges .",
    "this nucleation could also serve as an analogy to the non - equilibrium ordering kinetics @xcite despite the complexity of a growth process and non - linear driving forces involved .",
    "the coalescence process for our case is slow ( slow mode ) because the richest vertices are located still relatively far ( counted in ` handshakes ' ) from the szg node ( cf . figs .",
    "[ figure : szg_k2_correct ] and [ figure : szg_k3_correct ] ) .",
    "therefore , the coordination zones of the szg node have insufficient number of vertices to accelerate an attachment process .",
    "it is worthwhile to relate this transition to nucleation , with some significant destructive events on worldwide markets .",
    "our conjecture is that , the at least crash on the market of new us houses for sale in july 2005 together with a giant fluctuation on us car market at that time , had become a crash catalyzer a month later .",
    "the slow mode transforms to a fast mode for @xmath162 , where location of @xmath10 is denoted by the red vertical dashed - dotted line .",
    "the slow and fast modes are shown by the green and red curves , respectively , pieced together before the ` condensation ' region exhibited in figs .",
    "[ figure : oba_zbocza ] , [ figure : oba_zbocza_week ] , [ figure : kondensat_day ] , and [ figure : kondensat ] .",
    "the red solid curves shown in the figures were obtained by fitting the function @xmath163 , as a solution of eq .",
    "( [ rown : lambda ] ) . for the ` condensation ' region we observed that the richest vertices are effectively ` attracted ' by the szg superhub making its first , second and the third coordination zones richer and richer in edges during the mst evolution .",
    "indeed , this mechanism induces impetuous , logarithmic coalescence of edges to the szg superhub ( or temporary attractor ) leading to a condensate . obviously",
    ", all these phenomena somehow relate to the bad news from the us economy ( and not only from the selected markets ) accumulated throughout the year 2006 .    however , for time @xmath164 the condensate is logarithmically decaying , in accordance with the function @xmath165 ) , as a solution of eq .",
    "( [ rown : lambdar ] ) , and disintegrates for the few loosely connected clusters , or sectors , centralized around their leaders .",
    "that is , for the later time , the szg superhub is logarithmically decreasing , losing its edges ( see fig .",
    "[ figure : zep_558 ] ) and finally seizes to be the dragon - king .",
    "this makes the final mst network phase step - by - step more similar to the initial ` equilibrium scale - invariant network ' , closing a single ( quasi-)cycle of the evolution of a market .",
    "the non - equilibrium evolution of the entire complex network is reduced , herein , to the non - linear dynamics of the dragon - king or super - extreme event , which makes its solution the effective one .",
    "noticably , we are saying about its deterministic component , leaving its stochastic part to the subsequent work , where complete langevin equation is discussed in the context .",
    "we can conclude that we have demonstrated the first evidence for real - life condensation phenomenon with an associated @xmath0-transition , together with a preceding phase of nucleation growth .",
    "further , we have investigated in empirical and phenomenological ways , a complete phase diagrams for these intriguing dynamic phase transitions in real - world complex networks .",
    "we expect that our results will be inspiring for interdisciplinary physicists involved in a broad spectrum of disciplines studying emergence evoked by complexity .",
    "furthermore , we expect that our work , providing a sophisticated example of the dynamical paradigm of phase transitions and critical phenomenon ( concerning a network as complex as stock market ) , will provide a new impulse to develop a unicersal theory of phase transitions in evolving complex networks .",

    "<S> we fill a void in merging empirical and phenomenological characterisation of the dynamical phase transitions in complex systems by identifying three of them on real - life financial markets . </S>",
    "<S> we extract and interpret the empirical , numerical , and semi - analytical evidences for the existence of these phase transitions , by considering the frankfurt stock exchange ( fse ) , as a typical example of a financial market of a medium size . using the canonical object for the graph theory , i.e. the minimal spanning tree ( mst ) network , </S>",
    "<S> we observe : ( i ) the initial phase transition from the equilibrium to non - equilibrium mst network in its nucleation phase , occurring at some critical time . </S>",
    "<S> coalescence of edges on the fse s transient leader is observed within the nucleation and is approximately characterized by the lifsthiz - slyozov growth exponent ; ( ii ) the nucleation accelerates and transforms to the condensation process , in the second phase transition , forming a logarithmically diverging @xmath0-peak of short - range order parameters at the subsequent critical time ; ( iii ) in the third phase transition , the peak logarithmically decreases over three quarters of the year , resulting in a few loosely connected sub - graphs . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0-peak , resembling the continuous phase transition from the normal fluid i @xmath1he to the superfluid ii @xmath1he , is reminiscent of a non - equilibrium superstar - like superhub or a ` dragon - king ' effect , abruptly accelerating the evolution of the leader company . </S>",
    "<S> the complexity of the mst is reduced then to the nonlinearity present in deterministic coarse - grain ( macroscopic ) dragon - king dynamic equation derived in tha paper . </S>",
    "<S> all these phase transitions are supported by the few richest vertices , which drift towards the leader and provide the most of the edges increasing the leader s degree . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we capture an amazing phenomenon , likely of a more universal character , where a peripheral vertex becomes the one which is over dominating the complex network during an exceptionally long period of time . </S>"
