    ". however they are not yet published with complete details .",
    "given the theoretical difficulties to solve the full polarized multi - level transfer equation rigorously , we decompose the problem as follows .",
    "small degrees of scattering polarization in o i lines allow us to assume that a decoupling of the underlying transfer equation into an unpolarized multilevel atom transfer equation with xrd , and a polarized two - level atom transfer equation with ordinary prd ( i.e. , no xrd , following * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "we use @xmath15 from the rh - code for both ordinary prd and xrd cases as the initial unpolarized solution namely , the 6-component irreducible stokes vector @xmath32 ( see e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we then calculate the 6-component mean intensity vector in the two - level atom approximation with an unpolarized ground level given by @xmath33 here @xmath34 represents an oriented magnetic field vector ( see figure  [ fig-001 ] , right panel ) .",

    "computing the mean intensity vector is an important step in which linear polarization is generated from the unpolarized intensity vector .",
    "this step is the link between the multi - level atom unpolarized radiative transfer code ( rh - code ) and the two - level atom polarized radiative transfer code that computes linear polarization at 1302  . in this second step the polarization",
    "is generated iteratively similar to a perturbation process and we finally obtain converged fractional linear polarization . for more details on the computation of linear polarization",
    "we refer the reader to ( * ? ? ? * and the references cited therein ) . for future references we name the code used in the second step as poly2d , which is a 2d extension of the so called poly code developed by @xcite .",
    "we note here that in this paper we use the word ` xrd ' when we use cross redistribution theory in the rh - code to compute linear polarization using two - level atom prd theory , and use the word ordinary ` prd ' when we use ordinary prd theory in the rh code to compute linear polarization using two - level atom prd theory .",
    "in this section we present the intensity profiles of the o i triplet and linear polarization profiles of the o i line at 1302  computed using the method described in section  [ method ] .",
    "our emphasis is on the fractional linear polarization spectrum of the o i line at 1302  .",
    "we also present an estimate of the errors in the resonance scattering fractional polarization , caused by not using xrd .",
    "we note here that the degree of the polarization in the o i resonance line is extremely small ( because of the small @xmath42 factor ) , yet they are useful to theoretically predict the effects of xrd on the fractional linear polarization .",
    "all the results presented here correspond to a non - magnetic case ( @xmath45 ) .      in figure  [ fig-0034 ]",
    "we show the emergent intensity profiles of the o i triplet in log scale computed from the 2d version of the rh - code for ordinary prd and the xrd cases .",
    "we show both , namely the spatial variation of the emergent intensity profiles and their spatial averages . the color coding of the profiles in the top panels is shown in the corresponding color bars in each panel .",
    "the spatial homogeneity of the intensity profiles is caused by the fact that the formation height of the line core is in a region of the atmosphere where it is represented by the horizontally homogeneous falc atmosphere .",
    "a comparison of the intensity profiles computed using the ordinary prd and the xrd cases show similar conclusions as presented in @xcite .",
    "the use of ordinary prd instead of xrd leads to a broadening of the intensity profiles in the near - wings of the line .",
    "the reason is that , if we do not take xrd into account , the fraction of emissions that occur by excitation in two other lines of the triplet is counted as complete frequency redistribution ( crd ) in the line under consideration , and clearly crd leads to a broadening in the lines . therefore assuming ordinary prd decreases the coherency fraction of the lines .      in figure  [ fig-01 ]",
    "we present a spatial distribution of @xmath46 profiles at the top of the 2d atmosphere for both the ordinary prd and xrd cases .",
    "the color coding of the profiles is shown in the corresponding color bars in each panel .",
    "clearly , differences between the ordinary prd and xrd profiles are significant in both the line core and the near - wings of the line . unlike the intensity profiles , the fractional linear polarization profiles are sensitive to the structuring in the atmosphere .",
    "the spatial variation due to inhomogeneities of the mhd atmosphere in the lower layers shows itself in the near - wings of the line which are formed in these layers ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the spatial distribution of linear polarization shows significant differences between the ordinary prd and xrd cases .    in figure  [ fig-02 ]",
    "we show the spatially averaged fractional polarization profiles @xmath47 profiles where each of the stokes parameters are spatially averaged before considering their ratios .",
    "these profile shapes are very much similar to the spatially averaged @xmath48 profiles for the xrd and the ordinary prd cases as shown in figure  [ fig-02a ] .",
    "however in both these cases , the spatial averaging smears out large differences between xrd and the ordinary prd fractional polarization profiles , which are clearly seen in figure  [ fig-01 ] .",
    "this suggests that the differences between xrd and the ordinary prd fractional polarization profiles become more significant in spatially resolved structures .",
    "the 2d radiative transfer allows us to show the effects of xrd also in the resonance scattering values of @xmath49 - which is generated due to geometrical symmetry breaking in the medium .    in the case of scattering polarization ,",
    "the quantities of interest have always been , the fractional polarization profiles .",
    "this is because of the following reasons . from the observational point of view , even in the most sophisticated polarimeter that measures scattering polarization to a very high accuracy , namely zimpol ( see e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ) , certain noise ( seeing noise and gain table noise namely flat - field noise due to pixel - to - pixel sensitivity variations ) in the observed data can be removed only by measuring the fractional polarization values @xmath50 and @xmath49 at each wavelength point .",
    "the small values of @xmath51 in a given spectral region further makes it difficult to measure the polarization profiles @xmath6 and @xmath52 , because the latter are obtained through a decomposition of @xmath51 in two mutually perpendicular directions ( see equation  [ stokesiqu ] and figure  [ fig-02a ] ) . from theoretical point of view , physically more meaningful are the fractional polarization profiles expressed in percents , in place of the @xmath6 and @xmath52 profiles which are expressed in some arbitrary units .",
    "for all these reasons , we conclude that the differences between xrd and ordinary prd fractional polarization profiles need to be considered when modeling the observed fractional polarization signals .",
    "as we discussed in the previous section , the xrd effects apparently become more visible in spatially resolved fractional polarization profiles ( as seen in figure  [ fig-01 ] ) , than in the spatially averaged case ( as in figures  [ fig-02 ] and [ fig-02a ] ) as the latter smears out the differences . therefore , to quantify the differences between ordinary prd and xrd profiles in the spatially resolved case , we computed percent absolute error defined as @xmath53    where @xmath54 .",
    "we do not use the relative error because in some parts of the spectrum , values of the linear polarization approach zero in which case , errors become undefined .    in figure  [ fig-03 ]",
    "we show percent absolute error in @xmath46 , ( in log scale ) , caused by using ordinary prd theory instead of xrd theory . due to steep gradient in the intensity profiles ( see figure  [ fig-02 ] ) , the errors can be as large as 28 % in the line wings ( @xmath551.44 in log scale ) of intensity profiles . in @xmath50 profiles ,",
    "the maximum absolute error is 4 % ( @xmath55 0.62 in log scale ) and in @xmath49 , it is 2 % ( @xmath55 0.37 in log scale ) .",
    "these results clearly show that xrd can cause significant differences in intensity as well as linear polarization profiles , and needs to be used whenever possible and applicable .",
    "on the one hand , the spatial distribution of the scattering polarization shows that it is sensitive to the structuring of the atmosphere . on the other hand significant differences between the spatial distribution of the polarization for the ordinary prd and xrd cases",
    "show that whenever xrd is relevant , assumption of ordinary prd may lead to significant errors .",
    "therefore , the differences between ordinary prd and xrd profiles is the outcome of both ( 1 ) multi - d transfer , and ( 2 ) the type of scattering theory used . in this way",
    "the xrd effects in combination with multi - d transfer are important to reproduce the amplitude and shapes of the observed scattering polarization profiles .",
    "in this paper we have attempted to quantify for the first time , the effects of xrd on the fractional linear polarization using the example of the resonance line of o i triplet at 1302  .",
    "we use the anisotropy computed from the rh - code for both ordinary prd and xrd theories , to compute the linear polarization based on the two - level atom prd theory of @xcite .",
    "we present also an estimate of the percent absolute error when using the approximation of ordinary prd theory instead of the more realistic xrd theory",
    ". this can be as large as 28 % for the intensity profiles , due to the steep gradients present in these profiles . in @xmath50 ,",
    "the maximum error is 4 % and that in @xmath49 it is 2 % .",
    "we show a comparison of the spatial distribution of the fractional scattering polarization and the spatially averaged profiles for ordinary prd and xrd cases .",
    "we conclude that the fractional linear polarization signals are sensitive to the structuring of the atmosphere and that the xrd effects become more significant in spatially resolved cases than in the spatially averaged case as the latter smears out the large differences . therefore , to reproduce the amplitude and shape of observed scattering polarization signals of the o i line at 1302  ,",
