    "<S> in order to identify possible experimental signatures of the superfluid to mott - insulator quantum phase transition we calculate the charge structure factor @xmath0 for the one - dimensional bose - hubbard model using the dynamical density - matrix renormalisation group ( ddmrg ) technique . </S>",
    "<S> particularly we analyse the behaviour of @xmath1 by varying  at zero temperature  the coulomb interaction strength within the first mott lobe . for strong interactions , in the mott - insulator phase , </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the ddmrg results are well reproduced by a strong - coupling expansion , just as the quasi - particle dispersion . in the superfluid phase </S>",
    "<S> we determine the linear excitation spectrum near @xmath2 . in one dimension , </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude mode is absent which mean - field theory suggests for higher dimensions .    </S>",
    "<S> recent experimental realisations of optical lattices make it possible to investigate the properties of ultracold dilute atoms in a new regime of strong correlations  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> tuning the strength of the laser field , the effective interactions between the atoms can be tuned to be stronger than their kinetic energy . the competition between the coulomb energy and the kinetic energy </S>",
    "<S> may even drive a quantum phase transition between superfluid ( sf ) and mott insulating ( mi ) phases . </S>",
    "<S> the bose  hubbard model ( bhm ) captures the essential physics of this problem . in previous work  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite we studied the photoemission spectra of the one - dimensional ( 1d ) bhm both in the mi and sf phases . in this contribution </S>",
    "<S> we extend our preceding investigations of the dynamical properties of the bhm by analysing the dynamical structure factor @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> analytically , @xmath0 has been determined by mean - field approaches  @xcite and , numerically , for rather small 1d systems , by exact diagonalisation  @xcite or , at finite temperatures , by qmc  @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> , we carry out large - scale dynamical density - matrix renormalisation group ( ddmrg )  @xcite calculations in order to examine the density - density correlations of @xmath3 interacting bose particles on @xmath4 sites at zero temperature . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , fixing @xmath5 , we set up a perturbation theory whose results can be compared with the ddmrg data in the strong - coupling limiting case .    </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian of the 1d bhm reads @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the creation and annihilation operators for bosons on site @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the boson number operator on site @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> the tunnel amplitude between nearest neighbour lattice sites is denoted by @xmath11 , and @xmath12 gives the on - site coulomb repulsion of the bose particles . </S>",
    "<S> for the ddmrg treatment of  ( [ bhm ] ) we use periodic boundary conditions , take into account @xmath13 bosons per site and keep up to @xmath14 density - matrix eigenstates , ensuring that the discarded weight is always smaller than @xmath15 .    </S>",
    "<S> the dynamical charge structure factor is defined as @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 denote the ground and @xmath19-th excited state , respectively , and @xmath20 gives the corresponding excitation energy . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0 characterises the density - density response of the bose gas and is directly accessible in experiment , for instance , by bragg spectroscopy  @xcite .     at various momenta @xmath21 ( for @xmath22 from bottom to top ) . </S>",
    "<S> ddmrg data ( symbols ) were obtained for @xmath23 ; @xmath24 ( lines ) give the corresponding first - order strong - coupling expansion results ( for the same value of @xmath25 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the dashed line indicates the point @xmath26 . ]    from lowest - order strong - coupling perturbation theory we find for @xmath5 ( @xmath27 ) @xmath28 then , for @xmath29 , we have in units of @xmath11 @xmath30 ^ 2    \\frac{\\sqrt{20 + 16\\cos k-(\\omega - u)^2}}{2\\pi(5 + 4\\cos k)}\\ , ,   \\label{sc_unconvolved}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> since ddmrg provides @xmath0 with a finite broadening @xmath32 , it is useful to convolve the strong - coupling result @xmath33 with the lorentz distribution  @xcite : @xmath34\\right]$ ] . for the 1d bhm , from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ sc_unconvolved ] ) , we thus get @xmath35    figure  [ fig1 ] illustrates the frequency and momentum dependencies of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> peaks in @xmath0 assign charge excitations . for @xmath36 , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0 exhibits a maximum around @xmath37 that can be attributed to excitations across the mott gap . within strong - coupling theory  ( [ sc_unconvolved ] ) this signature stays at @xmath37 for all @xmath38 but becomes more pronounced as @xmath38 reaches the brillouin zone boundary . </S>",
    "<S> our ddmrg data corroborate this prediction ( cf .  the left panel of fig .  [ fig1 ] depicting the results for @xmath39 ) . naturally , </S>",
    "<S> as @xmath12 gets smaller , differences between the numerical ddmrg and the analytical strong - coupling results emerge . </S>",
    "<S> most importantly , the position of the maximum in @xmath0 varies with @xmath38 : it is shifted to smaller ( larger ) frequencies for @xmath38 values near the band centre ( brillouin zone boundary ) ; see middle and right - hand panels of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> we have to include higher - order @xmath40corrections to reproduce this feature analytically . </S>",
    "<S> note that the maximum in @xmath0 amplifies as @xmath41 .    </S>",
    "<S> next , we investigate the dependences of @xmath0 on the broadening @xmath32 and the system size @xmath4 to scrutinise whether the ddmrg data `` converge '' to the unconvolved strong - coupling result  ( [ sc_unconvolved ] ) as @xmath42 and @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig2]showing @xmath0 in the mi phase at @xmath44 ( left ) , @xmath45 ( middle ) and @xmath46 ( right panel ) for @xmath23 , 32 , 64 @xmath25 , @xmath47 , @xmath11 , respectively  demonstrates that this is indeed the case . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , for @xmath39 , we see that the ddmrg results are in a satisfactory accord with @xmath48 , where as a matter of course for smaller system sizes a larger value of @xmath32 has to be used to achieve good agreement . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , @xmath0 calculated by ddmrg approaches the curve given by  ( [ sc_unconvolved ] ) for increasing system size @xmath4 and decreasing broadening @xmath32 .    </S>",
    "<S> -dependence of the dynamical structure factor @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> ddmrg data ( symbols ) are compared with the corresponding strong - coupling results ( dashed lines ) at various momenta  @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> the solid green line shows the unconvolved result of the strong - coupling expansion . ]     in the @xmath38@xmath49 plane for different @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> ddmrg data were obtained for @xmath50 system , using @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) in the mi phase and at the kt transition point ( in the sf phase ) . </S>",
    "<S> the red crosses mark the positions of the maximum in each @xmath21sector . </S>",
    "<S> the green line for @xmath53 marks the field - theory / bogoliubov result @xmath54}$ ] with @xmath55 . ]    finally , we look at the changes in the dynamical density - density response as the system crosses the mi - sf quantum phase transition with decreasing coulomb interaction strength . figure  [ fig3 ] shows the intensity distribution of @xmath0 in the mi and sf phases as well as in the vicinity of the kosterlitz  </S>",
    "<S> thouless ( kt ) transition point , where the charge excitation gap closes . for large @xmath12 </S>",
    "<S> , the spectral weight is mainly concentrated around @xmath26 in the region @xmath56 , in agreement with the strong - coupling prediction . </S>",
    "<S> as @xmath12 weakens in the mi phase , the distribution of the spectral weight broadens . at the same time , the maximum value of @xmath0 acquires a sizable dispersion ( see upper - row panels ) . as the system reaches the mi - sf transition point we observe a significant redistribution of spectral weight to lower @xmath38 values and , most notably , the excitation gap closes ( see lower panels ) . in our previous work </S>",
    "<S> , we evaluated the scaling of the tomonaga  </S>",
    "<S> luttinger liquid parameter and determined the kt transition point to be located at @xmath57  @xcite . in the sf phase spectra for @xmath58 ( cf .  </S>",
    "<S> the panel for @xmath53 ) , we observe an almost linear dispersion of the @xmath0 , which  in accordance with bosonization  @xcite and with bogoliubov theory  @xcite can be taken as a signature of the bose condensation process . </S>",
    "<S> our 1d ddmrg bhm data are unsuggestive of two distinct ( gapless sound and massive ) modes in the sf phase . </S>",
    "<S> these two phases are found in mean - field theory and may appear for dimensions @xmath59 where a true condensate exists in the sf ground state .    to summarise , </S>",
    "<S> we have determined the dynamical structure factor @xmath0 for the 1d bhm with particle density @xmath5 by means of unbiased numerical ddmrg calculations . as discussed for photoemission spectra previously  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , @xmath0 agrees with the first - order perturbation theory result in the mott insulator phase for @xmath60 . naturally , </S>",
    "<S> as the coulomb interaction is lowered , noticeable deviations appear between both approaches , in particular the ddmrg @xmath0 becomes dispersive and we find a substantial redistribution of spectral weight into the small @xmath38-sector . in this regime , higher - order corrections have to be taken into account in our analytical treatment of the bhm . </S>",
    "<S> approaching the sf state , the charge excitations gap closes and the maximum in @xmath0 exhibits a linear dispersion . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum phase transition between mi and sf phases is located at about @xmath61 and found to be of kt type .    </S>",
