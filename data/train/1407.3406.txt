    "in this paper we show the self - trapping of plasma @xmath0 in a plasma acceleration structure due to phase - mixing in an up - ramp density inhomogeneity at the vacuum - plasma interface .",
    "rising density inhomogeneities at the vacuum - plasma interface are universal features of plasma sources .",
    "hence , it is critical to study the plasma processes in a density gradient .",
    "plasma acceleration structures are excited by coherent motion of the plasma @xmath0 driven by resonant energy sources in the plasma .",
    "plasma @xmath0 typically oscillate within the potential well of the background ions spatially limited to a single bucket and do not co - propagate with the driver .",
    "trapping is a mechanism of self - injection of plasma @xmath0 into the plasma acceleration structure resulting in the transfer of energy ( and acceleration ) to the trapped electron beam .",
    "the trapped @xmath0 propagate across many plasma - wavelenghts locked to the crest of the wakefield .",
    "therefore beam loading of the acceleration structure potential leads to dissipation from the wakefields@xcite .",
    "the highest field amplitude plasmon - bucket is just behind the driver .",
    "the buckets subsequent to the first have smaller fields as they dissipate energy to the surrounding plasma and also to the plasma ions@xcite .",
    "most optimized injection schemes like external injection , self - injection due to non - linear plasmon oscillations and returning trajectory crossing , ionization injection , down - ramp injection@xcite , colliding - pulse injection etc .",
    "inject into the first wakefield bucket to accelerate at the peak gradient .",
    "it is of relevance to study the injection of plasma @xmath0 in a rising density inhomogeneity .",
    "an uncontrolled injection of plasma @xmath0 in successive plasmon buckets can increase the energy spread of the accelerated beam .",
    "the termination of injection is critical to maintaining nearly equal acceleration lengths at peak field of the stacked trapped beams injected into multiple plasmon - buckets .",
    "secondly , in beam - driven schemes where the forward longitudinal momenta is smaller in comparison to ultra - short laser pulses ( where forward longitudinal ponderomotive force is higher ) , this mechanism can lead to injection of plasma @xmath0 .",
    "the beam - driven plasma does not trap and self - inject because plasma electron longitudinal momenta are lower .",
    "these trapped particles may be observed as beam - lets at driving beam energy . and",
    ", an analysis of trapped beams can be used as a diagnostics of the beam - plasma interaction and also to study the state of the plasma behind the driver@xcite .",
    "as the phase - mixing injection mechanism is a 1-d process it is described using 1-d model ( seen in the on - axis trapping in fig.[fig : long - momentum - self - trapping][a]-[c ] ) .",
    "the 1-d momentum equation of longitudinal oscillations of a plasmon ( along z ) is @xmath3 , where @xmath4 . by simplifying ,",
    "@xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , we have , @xmath8 .",
    "the equation is similar in form to the hill s equation due to the presence of a function of dependent variable as the coefficient .",
    "the momentum solutions have phase - mixing ( in fig.[fig : phase - mixing - cartoon ] ) , as the solutions depend upon of plasmon oscillation frequencies and amplitudes ( @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) .",
    "we can build a physical picture of trapping of plasma @xmath0 by phase mixing of trajectories .",
    "the up - ramped density inhomogeneity leads to frequency up - chirped spatial - train of coherently oscillating sheets .",
    "the perturbed infinitesimal plasma sheets have different characteristic plasma frequency due to different density , therefore coupled individual sheet oscillators undergo a phase - mixing ( see fig.1)@xcite .",
    "following @xcitesec.iv-1d model , the displacement , @xmath11 from equilibrium , @xmath12 or the trajectory is @xmath13 .",
    "the time for mixing to start is @xmath14 .",
    "the displacement from equilibrium , x depends upon the maximum longitudinal field , @xmath15 .",
    "so , in 1-d model @xmath16 .",
    "the effect of phase - mixing between infinitesimal sheet leads to plasma @xmath0 encountering unbalanced fields that are not experienced during in - phase oscillations , this results in their disruption .",
    "the trajectory of first oscillation in the forward direction of propagation of the source do not cross . because , the driven @xmath0 propagate in the same direction , @xmath17 .",
    "however , during the returning trajectories of the oscillations , @xmath18 , the faster oscillators ( higher in density ) encounter the potential well of the slower oscillators",
    ". therefore the trapping of @xmath0 occurs in the second and subsquent buckets and not in the first bucket . since , the peak fields are in the first bucket this trapping mechanism is not ideal for acceleration .",
    "the disruption of the plasma oscillations also occurs when the @xmath0 trajectories are highly non - linear ( @xmath19 ) resulting in phase - mixing@xcite ( for instance they cross in the back of the bubble ) .",
    "the plasma @xmath0 that go out - of - phase see unbalanced fields in the wave - frame and get trapped in the accelerating phase of the fields .",
    "therefore in laser excited non - linear plasmons the trapping also occurs in the first bucket .",
    "density ( negative ) rises from 0 to @xmath20 between 50 and 70@xmath21 .",
    "the homogeneous plasma density is @xmath20.,width=312 ]                to study the trapping of plasma @xmath0 in a rising plasma density gradient at the vacuum - plasma interface driven by an ultra - short laser pulse and a compressed relativistic beam , we use @xmath22 osiris@xcite pic code with eulerian specification of the plasma dynamics in a fixed frame .",
    "we initialize the homogeneous background plasma density to @xmath23 pre - ionized singly - charged state .",
    "the density gradient at the vacuum - plasma interface is in fig.[fig : vacuum - plasma - gradient ] , with vacuum regions in the first and last 50@xmath21 longitudinal space .",
    "we have chosen a relatively high density plasma because of computational convenience as @xmath24 .",
    "we resolve and reference the real time in simulation to the laser period @xmath25 thereby the dynamics within a single plasma cycle is simulated in just @xmath26 laser cycles .",
    "we discretize the space with 20 cells per skin - depth ( @xmath27 ) in the longitudinal and 10 cells per @xmath21 in the transverse direction .",
    "the longitudinal simulation space size is 470 @xmath21 and the transverse size is 300@xmath21 for laser - plasma and 600@xmath21 for beam - plasma simulations .",
    "we use absorbing boundary conditions for fields and particles of all species .",
    "we use cubic or quartic splines to model the particle shapes .",
    "the laser pulse is chosen to be a circularly polarized pulse with normalized vector potential @xmath28 with a trapezoidal pulse of gaussian rise and fall time of @xmath29 and a flat - time of @xmath30 .",
    "gaussian-@xmath31 with matched@xcite fwhm focal radius of @xmath32 .",
    "the particle beam is initialized with @xmath33 , @xmath34 and gaussian - shape with dimensions of @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "these laser and beam driver parameters excite comparable longitudinal fields , in fig.[fig : on - axis - longitudinal - field ] .        in fig.[fig",
    ": long - momentum - self - trapping],[fig : long - momentum - time - evolution ] the longitudinal momentum phase - space of the plasma @xmath0 is shown .",
    "the trapped @xmath0 are seen propagating in longitudinally forward direction , fig.[fig : long - momentum - time - evolution ] .",
    "the forward propagating @xmath0 are locked to the peak of the wake - plasmon longitudinal fields , this allows the trapped @xmath0 to continuously gain momentum . in [ fig : long - momentum - self - trapping](a ) and ( b ) the _ beam - driven _ longitudinal momentum of plasma @xmath0 are shown at @xmath37 for longitudinal momentum with longitudinal - dimension ( @xmath38 ) and transverse - dimension ( @xmath39 ) phase - space respectively . corresponding snapshot of longitudinal momentum phase - space for _ laser - driven _ case are shown in ( c ) and ( d ) respectively .",
    "it is important to note that the forward longitudinal momentum ( @xmath40 ) in the first bucket for the laser with @xmath28 is much higher than the beam - driven case with @xmath41 ( in fig.[fig : on - axis - longitudinal - field ] ) .",
    "the increase ( by @xmath42 ) of first - bucket size due to relativistic effects can be observed in fig.[fig : on - axis - longitudinal - field](a),[fig : real - space - self - trapping](c ) .",
    "it is also observed that in the beam - driven case , [ fig : long - momentum - self - trapping](a)-(b ) , there is no plasma @xmath0 trapping in the first bucket behind the beam .",
    "the plasma @xmath0 are trapped in the rising density gradient at the vacuum - plasma interface in the second and subsequent buckets .",
    "however , in [ fig : long - momentum - self - trapping](c)-(d ) , plasma @xmath0 are trapped in all the buckets . in the laser - driven case ,",
    "the plasma oscillations are non - linear due to relativistic effects and larger ponderomotive effect .",
    "so , trapping of plasma @xmath0 occurs in the first bucket due to trajectory distortion ( trajectories cross in the back of the bubble ) as a result of non - linearity of longitudinal trajectories .",
    "however , the trapping in the second bucket is due to the rising density gradient at the vacuum - plasma interface .    in fig.[fig",
    ": real - space - self - trapping ] the plasma @xmath0 density is shown in real - space . in [ fig : real - space - self - trapping](a)-(b ) , the beam - driven plasma is shown in real - space . in laser - drive case in [ fig : real - space - self - trapping](c)-(d ) , the trapped @xmath0 due to trajectory crossing in the back of the first bucket can be observed .",
