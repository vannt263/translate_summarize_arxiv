    "jd2 is an interesting object in the hubble ultradeep field ( udf ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "its non - detection shortward of the 1.1@xmath0 m bandpass , even in ultradeep advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) udf optical data which are sensitive down to @xmath229 ab mag , has been interpreted as being due to the redshifted lyman break .",
    "in addition , it displays a break in its broad band spectral energy distribution ( sed ) between 2.2@xmath0 m and 3.6@xmath0 m which has been interpreted as the redshifted balmer break .",
    "@xcite argue that it may be a very massive ( 6@xmath510@xmath6  m@xmath7 ) galaxy with very little ongoing star - formation at @xmath1 .",
    "the large stellar mass of this galaxy derived from fitting population synthesis models to the multiband photometry , and high source density implied by the presence of one such object in the small area subtended by the near - infrared camera and multi - object spectrograph ( nicmos ) udf , suggest that uv - faint objects , if indeed at such high redshifts , contribute as much to the stellar mass density at @xmath1 as rest - frame ultraviolet - bright lyman break galaxies . since the age of the stellar population in jd2 is thought to be @xmath2600 myr , galaxies like jd2 might harbor remnants of the first epoch of star - formation , and play an important role in the reionization of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "such an object , if truly at high redshift , would challenge current models of galaxy formation , which do not predict a large number density of galaxies more massive than 10@xmath6  m@xmath7 at @xmath9 @xcite .    the photometric redshift solutions in @xcite favor a @xmath13 solution but provide a 15% probability that the source is at @xmath14 , with the most likely alternative solution implying a dusty galaxy at @xmath15 .",
    "there are a few inconsistencies in the high - redshift interpretation of jd2 .",
    "the optical / near - infrared sed is best fit by a template without significant extinction or star - formation .",
    "however , the object is detected in the great observatories origins deep survey ( goods ) _ spitzer _  multiband imaging photometer and spectrometer ( mips ) 24@xmath0 m survey with a flux density of 51.4@xmath164@xmath0jy .",
    "since the 24@xmath0 m flux would be dominated by redshifted hot dust and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emission , it indicates the presence of dust within the galaxy .",
    "the age - extinction degeneracy is very well known for red galaxies .",
    "most recently , @xcite have shown that the optical / near - infrared photometry of dusty , extremely red objects ( eros ) is almost identical to that of evolved , passive eros , and that only the detection of reprocessed emission at mid- and far - infrared wavelengths can break the degeneracy .",
    "nevertheless , mobasher et al .",
    "( 2006 ) suggest that the 24@xmath0 m emission could be explained by the presence of an obscured active nucleus . while this is possible , at @xmath1 , the _ chandra _ 2@xmath48 kev band traces 15@xmath460 kev emission , energies which are relatively immune to absorption .",
    "the @xmath17 detection limit corresponds to l@xmath18 of 3@xmath510@xmath19  erg  s@xmath8 at @xmath20 while the mid - infrared detection implies @xmath21l@xmath22 at rest 3@xmath0 m  of 3@xmath510@xmath23  erg  s@xmath8 .",
    "the 10@xmath0 m   to x - ray luminosity ratios of local seyfert nuclei are @xmath23 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the flat spectrum of seyferts in @xmath24 , implies that either large ( n@xmath25@xmath26 ) column densities of neutral gas must be obscuring the hard x - ray emission or the active galactic nucleus ( agn ) is an unusually low luminosity x - ray source .    in a recent paper , @xcite question the optical limits in the @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 passbands adopted by @xcite and demonstrate that the @xmath31 values in the redshift fits are skewed in the @xcite analysis by adopting optical flux limits which are too stringent . by refitting the source with revised optical limits ,",
    "they conclude the source to be at @xmath32 rather than at @xmath1 .",
    "we also note that jd2 has been visited in work by @xcite and @xcite prior to the @xcite analysis , and had been classified as a @xmath33 ero .    in this paper , we present new 16@xmath0 m  and 22@xmath0",
    "m photometry of this source from _ spitzer _   infrared spectrograph ( irs ) peak - up imaging of the goods fields @xcite .",
    "we fit the photometry at these two wavelengths and the published 24@xmath0 m  data with a variety of dust spectral energy distributions and demonstrate that the mid - infrared photometry is most consistent with a redshift of @xmath3 for jd2 .",
    "we assess the accuracy of the optical / near - infrared photometry and refit the data with this redshift constraint to determine physical properties of the galaxy .",
    "we conclude that it is a luminous infrared galaxy with l@xmath34  l@xmath7 and not a @xmath9 galaxy with a dust obscured agn . throughout this paper ,",
    "we adopt a @xmath35 , @xmath36 , h@xmath37=71 km  s@xmath8  mpc@xmath8 cosmology .",
    "the 16@xmath0 m and 22@xmath0 m observations were carried out using the peak - up imaging capability of the infrared spectrograph ( irs ) instrument @xcite on the _ spitzer _  _ space telescope_. the field of view of the peak - up imaging camera is 54@xmath3880@xmath39 .",
    "the central @xmath2130  arcmin@xmath40 of the goods - s field was observed with 60s frame times .",
    "most of the area within the goods fields had four dithers per position while the udf area had 32 dithers per position .",
    "each frame was distortion corrected and background subtracted .",
    "the dithered frames were combined using `` drizzle '' @xcite . due to the limited number of dithers per position ,",
    "point kernel drizzling , which would have minimized the correlated noise in the mosaics was not possible .",
    "the final mosaics have a plate scale of 0.9@xmath39 per pixel .",
    "the exposure time in the final mosaics is @xmath24 min  pix@xmath8 over most of the goods area while the udf area was observed with 32 min pix@xmath8 .",
    "jd2 , although in the udf region , seredipitously lies in a part of the coverage map where the exposure time is 68 min , twice that of the nominal udf . as a result ,",
    "the statistical uncertainty on its flux is lower than for the average udf source of the same brightness .",
    "the spatial resolution of @xmath41 at 16@xmath0 m and 22@xmath0 m is 4.1@xmath39 and 5.2@xmath39 full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) , respectively . at this resolution , the majority of sources , including jd2 , are point sources .",
    "this makes it possible to use prior positions from higher resolution data , such as the goods 3.6@xmath48@xmath0 m  imaging ( * ? ? ?",
    "* dickinson et al . , in prep . ) and apply point - source fitting techniques to measure the flux density of the source .",
    "the technique has successfully been used for cataloging 24@xmath0 m sources from the goods / mips imaging survey .",
    "the results are consistent with aperture photometry , with appropriate aperture corrections , for isolated sources and alleviate the contamination to the photometry from the wings of the point spread function for sources which have nearby companions .",
    "postage stamp image cutouts of jd2 are shown in figure 1 .",
    "the 16@xmath0 m and 22@xmath0 m flux densities of the source are 13.5@xmath163.5@xmath0jy and 56@xmath1612@xmath0jy respectively . in comparison ,",
    "the 24@xmath0 m flux density of the source from the goods imaging of the field is 51@xmath164@xmath0jy .",
    "hudf - jd2 is separated by 7@xmath39 from a brighter mid - infrared source to the south east which is a @xmath42 spiral galaxy ( stern et al .",
    ", in prep . ) . in order to estimate the systematic uncertainty associated with fitting the flux density of a faint source near a bright one , we performed a monte - carlo simulation .",
    "we identified a relatively isolated source in the mosaic with about the same flux density as the spiral galaxy : this is the galaxy at 3:32:43.49 , -27:45:56.45 ( j2000 ) which has a flux density of 121@xmath1610@xmath0jy at 16@xmath0 m .",
    "we added an artificial source at a distance between 7@xmath39 and 8@xmath39 from this source and extracted the flux density using the positional priors .",
    "the process was repeated 100 times each for a range of flux densities straddling the measured flux density of the source .",
    "the extracted flux was compared with the input flux density to assess the systematic uncertainty and/or flux bias in the measurement . for a source with a brightness comparable to jd2 , the monte - carlo analysis yielded 1@xmath43 uncertainties of 14@xmath0jy , 12@xmath0jy and 10@xmath0jy at 16 , 22 and 24@xmath0 m , respectively .",
    "this systematic uncertainty is primarily due to the extended wings of the brighter source and is a factor of @xmath22 - 3 larger than the statistical uncertainty .",
    "we therefore adopt values of 14@xmath1614@xmath0jy at 16@xmath0 m , 56@xmath1612@xmath0jy at 22@xmath0 m and 51@xmath1610@xmath0jy at 24@xmath0 m for jd2 .    the sharp increase in flux density between 16@xmath0 m and 22@xmath0 m",
    "can either be due to the entrance of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons into the 22 and 24@xmath0 m  bandpasses or the 9.7@xmath0 m silicate absorption feature entering the 16@xmath0 m bandpass .",
    "a third possibility is the decreasing contribution from hot dust surrounding an agn because the dust is close to its sublimation temperature .",
    "we evaluate each of these possibilities in the following sections .    we note that the irs is calibrated with respect to a constant @xmath21f@xmath22 source spectrum .",
    "color correction terms to the observed flux are smaller than 1% for the 16@xmath0 m and 22@xmath0 m data for the observed source spectrum and can be neglected .",
    "furthermore , when we estimate fits to the observed photometry , we integrate template spectra over the filter bandpasses ( figure 2 ) .",
    "the optical / near - infrared photometry of jd2 has been discussed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "spectral energy distribution fits to the photometry , which provide a photometric redshift solution , show a bimodal distribution of minimum @xmath31 values at @xmath44 and @xmath1 .",
    "one set of @xmath31 values are favored over the other depending on the choice of optical photometry .",
    "@xcite , with their stringent @xmath45 limits , derive the probability of a @xmath14 source to be 15% .",
    "@xcite instead adopt marginal detections of the source in the @xmath46 bandpasses which we discuss in secion 3.2 .",
    "any significant detection of the galaxy at optical wavelengths would rule out a photometric redshift solution which favors @xmath9 .",
    "@xcite find a minimum in the @xmath31 distribution at @xmath32 .",
    "the detection of hudf - jd2 in the deep goods 24@xmath0 m images did not break the degeneracy .",
    "@xcite suggests the hot dust emission is from an obscured agn in the galaxy .",
    "alternately , the 24@xmath0 m  emission could be dominated from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) features which would be present if the object is an extremely red , dusty starburst galaxy at @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "inclusion of the 16 and 22@xmath0 m  data allows us to measure a photometric redshift from the mid - infrared which could potentially break this degeneracy , independent of the optical / near - infrared sed fits .",
    "although fitting optical to mid - infrared simultaneously is more elegant , it is virtually impossible since there is virtually no correlation between optical / near - infrared seds and mid - infrared seds of galaxies .",
    "the mid - infrared sed of a star - forming galaxy is a complicated interplay of warm dust continuum , pah emission and silicate absorption features .",
    "the ratio of flux densities in the three abutting _ spitzer _",
    "passbands at 16 , 22 and 24@xmath0 m  allow redshifts of objects to be constrained as these dust features move through these filters .",
    "pah are only 0.5 - 1@xmath0 m wide , while the 9.7@xmath0 m silicate feature is 3@xmath44@xmath0 m wide , depending on the continuum level adopted . as a result",
    ", adjacent passbands can show widely different flux density ratios as a function of redshift ( figure 3 ) .",
    "at @xmath47 , the 9.7@xmath0 m  silicate feature enters the 16@xmath0 m bandpass while the 22 and 24@xmath0 m  bandpasses are tracing the warm dust and 11 and 12@xmath0 m  pah features . at these redshifts ,",
    "sources show low 16@xmath0m/22@xmath0 m  flux density ratios . at @xmath48 ,",
    "the 9.7@xmath0 m features moves out of the 16@xmath0 m  bandpass and into the 22@xmath0 m  bandpass , while the 6.2@xmath0 m  and 7.7@xmath0 m  pah features fall in the 16@xmath0 m  window , boosting the 16@xmath0m/22@xmath0 m  ratio . at @xmath49 , the 9.7@xmath0 m  feature moves into the 24@xmath0 m  band .",
    "since the 22@xmath0 m  bandpass is @xmath22@xmath0 m  wider than the mips 24@xmath0 m  band , the 7.7@xmath0 m  feature enters the 22@xmath0 m  bandpass .",
    "the net effect is to boost the 22@xmath0m/24@xmath0 m  flux ratio while lowering the 16@xmath0m/22@xmath0 m  ratio . at @xmath50 , the pah emission shifts out of the 16@xmath0 m  band , decreasing the 16@xmath0m/22@xmath0 m  ratio while the 22@xmath0m/24@xmath0 m  flux ratio varies as the 6.2 and 7.7@xmath0 m  pah features move within the passbands .",
    "this variation in flux ratios is illustrated in figure 3 for four different sed types derived from spectral observations of galaxies in the local universe @xcite .    while it is true that variation of pah line ratios or strength of silicate absorption can cause broadband fluxes to vary significantly , the combination of photometric redshifts from the optical / near - infrared and mid - infrared photometric redshifts using these three bandpasses can help break redshift degeneracies .",
    "the flux density ratios observed for hudf - jd2 are a 16@xmath0m/22@xmath0 m  ratio of 0.25@xmath51 and a 22@xmath0m/24@xmath0 m  ratio of 1.1@xmath52 .",
    "this indicates that the galaxy must either be at @xmath53 if it has very strong silicate absorption or at @xmath3 if it is a typical starburst galaxy with strong pah emission .    in figure 4 and table 1 ,",
    "we illustrate the quality of fits to the photometry at 16 , 22 and 24@xmath0 m from different mid - infrared template spectral energy distributions .",
    "we consider starbursts , agn and composite sources which span the range of strong pah , weak pah and strong silicate absorption @xcite .",
    "we also consider the non - detection of jd2 in deep 70@xmath0 m  observations of the goods fields which achieve 5@xmath43 flux density limits of @xmath22 mjy @xcite .",
    "the best fit to the 16@xmath0 m , 22@xmath0 m  and 24@xmath0 m photometry is from a starburst source with strong pah emission at @xmath54 .",
    "the increase in the 22@xmath0 m and 24@xmath0 m flux relative to 16@xmath0 m is due to the entrance of the 7.7@xmath0 m pah complex into the 22@xmath0 m and 24@xmath0 m bandpasses . the flux in the 16@xmath0 m bandpass is lower since the 6.2@xmath0 m pah feature is much weaker .",
    "extrapolating the templates that are fit to the mid - infrared photometry also yields an estimate of the far - infrared luminosity for the galaxy .",
    "the l@xmath55=l(8@xmath41000@xmath0 m ) luminosity of the source is @xmath25@xmath510@xmath6  l@xmath7 , which corresponds to a star - formation rate of 80  m@xmath7 yr@xmath8 . we compare this with optical / uv estimates of star - formation in the following section . using the radio - fir correlation in @xcite",
    ", we predict the 1.4 ghz to be 12@xmath0jy and the 8.4 ghz flux density to be 3.7@xmath0jy while the predicted fluxes at 70@xmath0 m  and 850@xmath0 m  are shown in table 1 .",
    "the deepest 70@xmath0 m  and 850@xmath0 m  surveys are currently sensitive to 1.5@xmath42 mjy .",
    "the predicted intensities of jd2 are below these limits implying that confirmation of the derived far - infrared luminosity will have to await deeper observations by _ herschel _ and alma .",
    "@xmath31 values are also reduced for an obscured agn template at @xmath56 which has the observed 16@xmath0 m  flux density suppressed relative to the flux density at 22@xmath0 m  and 24@xmath0 m  due to the entrance of the 9.7@xmath0msilicate absorption feature . an obscured agn template like mrk231",
    "can also fit the 8@xmath0 m  flux density of the source as shown in figure 4 while the starburst template fits at @xmath3 require the optical / near - infrared flux to be dominated by starlight ( figure 6 ) .",
    "the non - detection of any spectral lines in the optical / near - infrared spectroscopic data presented by @xcite , as well as the difficulty in accounting for the non - detection of the source at optical wavelengths ( section 3.3 ) makes the @xmath53 hypothesis unlikely . on the other hand , @xmath3 lies within the so - called redshift  desert \" , where the [ oii ] @xmath573727 doublet , [ oiii ] @xmath575007 line and h@xmath58+[nii ] lines are all severely affected by atmospheric transmission and strong oh sky lines .",
    "furthermore , as we discuss in section 3.3 , at @xmath54 , the red sed of the source between 2.2@xmath0 m and irac 3@xmath48@xmath0 m  could be due to the broad 1.6@xmath0 m  bump in the stellar sed being in the irac passbands .",
    "we now consider the implications of the irs detections to the high redshift advocated in @xcite .",
    "if we adopt the hypothesis that jd2 is at @xmath1 and the 24@xmath0 m  emission is dominated by agn light , we must first subtract the stellar contribution to the mid - infrared flux densities .",
    "we find that for the sed fit by @xcite , the contribution of stellar photospheric emission to the flux densities at 16 , 22 and 24@xmath0 m  are 10.7 , 6.5 and 6.0 @xmath0jy respectively .",
    "we then attempt to fit the starlight - subtracted mid - infrared photometry with the two mid - infrared agn templates presented in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath31 values are significantly worse than the best fits at @xmath3 ( table 1 and figure 5 ) .",
    "the mrk231 template , fairly typical of an obscured agn , is bluer in its 16@xmath0m/22@xmath0 m  flux ratios at @xmath20 than what the observations indicate .",
    "ngc1068 , which is a compton - thick agn with decreasing hot dust continuum at shorter wavelengths due to dust sublimation , would best fit the observed mid - infrared photometry at @xmath59 .",
    "the hot dust emission falls off too rapidly for it to account for the 22@xmath0 m  flux density with respect to the 24@xmath0mflux density if it were at @xmath20 .",
    "one could imagine that varying the agn template could allow for the mid - infrared photometry here to be fit but given that the @xmath54 fit using typical mid - infrared templates agrees with the parameters derived from the optical / near - infrared fits , we find the @xmath20 interpretation for jd2 substantially weakened .",
    "given the derived redshift based on the mid - infrared photometry of the source , we critically investigate the optical / near - infrared photometry to assess potential sources of error .",
    "the acs @xmath45 photometric measurements are very important to the interpretation of jd2 , since a significant optical detection would almost certainly rule out the @xmath60 hypothesis .",
    "we note that @xcite erroneously reported that their acs photometry was measured in an @xmath61 diameter aperture , when in fact a smaller , @xmath62 diameter aperture was used ( m.  dickinson , private communication )",
    ". a larger aperture size would lead to more conservative photometric limits , and is probably to be recommended , given the size of the galaxy as measured from the nicmos @xmath63-band images ( measured half - light radius @xmath64 , uncorrected for psf effects , see mobasher et al . ) .",
    "however , a larger aperture risks including light from three faint , neighboring galaxies located about 1  away from jd2 . we have masked out regions with diameter @xmath61 around those three galaxies in diameter around the neighboring galaxies .",
    "in fact , the masking diameter was @xmath61 , which we also adopt here . ] before measuring photometry for jd2 in a @xmath65 diameter circular aperture .",
    "the acs images were drizzled using a point kernel ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) which should lead to noise that is uncorrelated between adjacent pixels .",
    "we verified that this is the case by measuring the autocorrelation function of the noise after masking galaxies .",

    "@xcite report faint detections of positive flux in the acs @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30-bands , which , taken together , drive their photometric redshift estimate to favor a lower value , @xmath66 .",

    "( 2005 ) , mainly due to the larger aperture adopted here .",
    "it is possible that the positive flux detected in the dunlop et al .",
    "measurements arises in part from the faint neighboring galaxies .",
    "the nicmos @xmath68 photometry and @xmath69 photometry in @xcite are very similar to those in the udf catalog of @xcite . as a result , we have not remeasured these values . however , we note that the photometric values in @xcite do not include the nicmos count rate dependent non - linearity correction discussed in @xcite .",

    "it would imply a young 8 myr old starburst with a mass of 2@xmath510@xmath75  m@xmath7 and a true star - formation rate , as derived from extinction correction of the ultraviolet flux , of @xmath2100  m@xmath7  yr@xmath8 , all of which is dust obscured .",
    "the fits to the mid - infrared photometry at @xmath56 imply a much lower dust - obscured star - formation rate of @xmath25  m@xmath7  yr@xmath8 .",
    "although it is possible for optically thick star - formation , such as that found in local ulirgs , to result in the mid- and far - infrared luminosity of galaxies exceeding their extinction corrected ultraviolet luminosity , the converse is rarely true .",
    "this weakens the possibility of a @xmath56 starburst .    if the source is a @xmath56 obscured agn like mrk231 , then the contribution of the hot dust around the agn to the near - infrared photometry needs to be subtracted before fitting . for the mrk231 template",
    ", we find this to be 0.8 , 1.2 , 1.4 , 2.6 , 3.5 , 5.6 and 10.5@xmath0jy at 1.2 , 1.6 , 2.2 , 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 and 8.0@xmath0 m respectively .",
    "the photometry at 1.1 and 1.6@xmath0 m  of the source is a factor of @xmath76 below the expected values again indicating that a mrk231 type source , while consistent with the mid - infrared photometry , can not fit the entire sed .",
    "thus , a @xmath54 dusty star - forming galaxy sed is most consistent with all the photometry .",
    "we adopt this redshift and re - fit the optical / near - infrared data using the bc03 models .",
    "results are shown in table 3 .",
    "hudf - jd2 is best fit with a solar metallicity template from the bc03 library with a@xmath77  mag of visual extinction using a @xcite dust extinction law .",
    "we caution that the metallicity is not strongly constrained .",
    "the best - fit model is a post - starburst bc03 sed with @xmath78  myr , @xmath72=30 myr and a stellar mass of 6@xmath510@xmath12  m@xmath7 .",
    "this is similar to the @xmath44 fits presented in @xcite .",
    "the result is not surprising since post - starburst galaxies could have significant dust content from dust produced in supernovae and agb stars .",
    "in fact , it has been observationally shown that the host galaxies of core - collapse and type ia supernovae are dustier than field galaxies with the same observed optical brightness @xcite .",
    "we caution however , that the post - starburst hypothesis , motivated by the large value of @xmath79 , would be weakened if most of the star - formation takes place in optically thick regions of the galaxy .    from the sed fits",
    ", we estimate that the star - formation rate , as measured by the 1500  flux escaping the galaxy , is very small ( @xmath22@xmath510@xmath80  m@xmath7  yr@xmath8 ) .",
    "application of an extinction correction to the uv luminosity results in a star - formation rate of @xmath811  m@xmath7  yr@xmath8 .",
    "in contrast , its true star - formation rate as derived from the mid - infrared fits is @xmath280 - 90  m@xmath7  yr@xmath8 .",
    "the fact that jd2 is a compact near - infrared source with a scale length of @xmath20.3@xmath39 , combined with the large ratio of infrared to ultraviolet star - formation rate estimates , strongly suggests that jd2 is being powered by a compact , optically - thick starburst in its nucleus .",
    "there is a caveat .",
    "if we use the @xcite models to solve for an independent redshift from the optical / near - infrared photometry presented in this paper , we continue to get a high redshift minimum at @xmath82 which has a reduced @xmath31 of 1.05 compared to the reduced @xmath31 values of 1.9 and 2.4 at @xmath83 and @xmath54 respectively .",
    "thus , optical / near - infrared photometric redshifts continue to favor the high redshift hypothesis , while mid - infrared photometric redshifts favor the lower redshift hypothesis .",
    "we favor the mid - infrared photometric redshifts derived here since optical photometric redshifts for dusty galaxies have been shown to have a large scatter based on a comparison between spectroscopic and photometric redshifts for 24@xmath0 m  detected sources in goods -",
    "n @xcite .    a comparison of the properties of hudf - jd2 with the massive , red galaxy population at @xmath84 is illustrative .",
    "@xcite show that the star - formation rate of galaxies scale with the stellar mass at these redshifts and that the specific star - formation rate of a dusty starburst with mass of @xmath26@xmath510@xmath12  m@xmath7 is about @xmath85 gyr@xmath8 .",
    "udf - jd2 , for @xmath3 , has a specific star - formation rate of 1.6 gyr@xmath8 which is consistent with the massive , dusty starbursts at these redshifts .",
    "the optical extinction derived for this galaxy is rather large , corresponding to @xmath86=1.2 .",
    "spectroscopically confirmed galaxies at these redshifts which are 24@xmath0 m detected have @xmath86 values derived from their ultraviolet slopes of @xmath20.3 .",
    "this is most likely a bias since spectroscopic confirmation requires the detection of optical / ultraviolet lines which are preferentially detected in galaxies that are relatively transparent and have low extinction values .",
    "a better comparison is with the derived extinction values for local dusty starbursts presented in @xcite .",
    "the average @xmath86 to the stellar continuum for that sample at an infrared luminosity of 5@xmath510@xmath6  l@xmath7 is about 0.25 .",
    "thus , hudf - jd2 does not appear to be dissimilar from dusty , luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs ) at @xmath10 .",
    "however , its derived @xmath86 appears to be a factor of @xmath24 higher than other lirg samples , consistent with its significant detection at mid - infrared wavelengths and compact morphology in the nicmos 1.6@xmath0 m  image which suggests a compact , nuclear starburst similar to many local infrared luminous galaxies .",
    "jd2 is about 1.4 mags redder in observed @xmath87[3.6 ] colors and about 3 mags fainter at 3.6@xmath0 m  than hr10 , a @xmath88 spectroscopically confirmed dusty starburst @xcite . the predicted h@xmath58 line flux for this galaxy , including the extinction in the line , is @xmath210@xmath89ergs@xmath8  @xmath26",
    "this is a factor of 3 below the sensitivity of the existing observations in @xcite but should be detectable with a space - based near - infrared spectrograph .",
    "we present new 16 and 22@xmath0 m  mid - infrared photometry of the hudf source jd2 which had tentatively been classified as a @xmath1 massive galaxy .",
    "the mid - infrared spectral energy distribution shows a sharp increase in flux density between 16@xmath0 m  and 22@xmath0 m , most consistent with the 7.7@xmath0 m  pah feature entering the 22@xmath0 m  bandpass .",
    "our analysis concludes that the galaxy is a starbursting , luminous infrared galaxy ( lirg ) at a redshift of @xmath3 .",
    "the non - detection of the source in the udf @xmath45 data is due to the presence of @xmath90 mag of dust internal to the galaxy .",
    "we have re - evaluated the optical / near - infrared photometry of this source and find the stringent limits in @xcite are more consistent with the data rather than the marginal detection reported in @xcite .",
    "photometric redshift fits to the optical / near - infrared data alone continue to favor a @xmath9 solution .",
    "however , the unusually high l@xmath91/l@xmath92 for jd2 compared to other obscured agn , the large scatter in optical photometric redshift solutions for dusty galaxies and the similarity between the multiwavelength properties of this galaxy and other dusty starbursts in the @xmath84 range lead us to favor the mid - infrared photometric redshift solution .",
    "the non - detection of a @xmath10 lirg in the deepest optical data taken to date strongly cautions against interpreting near - infrared dropout sources in shallower surveys as @xmath9 galaxies .",
