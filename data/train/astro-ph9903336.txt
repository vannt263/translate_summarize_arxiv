    "formation history of the universe to redshifts as high as @xmath5 .",
    "although the evolution of the star  formation rate ( sfr ) is relatively well  established at lower redshifts ( @xmath6 ) , there is still substantial uncertainty about the @xmath7 era .",
    "a study of lyman break galaxies in the hubble deep field shows a decline of the sfr towards high @xmath8 , indicating a peak in the sfr around @xmath9 ( madau et al .",
    "1996 ) . on the other hand , a recent census of @xmath10 galaxies , detected in ly@xmath11 emission in a @xmath12 times wider field ,",
    "suggests that the sfr is either constant , or increasing from @xmath13 to @xmath14 ( steidel 1999 ) . at present , these uncertainties render extrapolations of the observed sfr to still higher ( @xmath15 ) redshifts unreliable .",
    "we do know , however , that some stellar activity must have taken place at @xmath16 .",
    "the presence of heavy elements observed in the high redshift ly@xmath11 forest ( tytler , cowie ) , as well as the reionization of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) , require sources of metals and ionizing photons in addition to the currently known population of galaxies and quasars . such ultra ",
    "high redshift objects are indeed expected in the current best ",
    "fit cosmological cold dark matter ( cdm ) models , which predict that the first virialized halos appear at redshifts as high as @xmath17 .",
    "it is natural to identify these small halos as the sites where the first stars or massive black holes are born , forming the first generation of `` mini  galaxies '' or `` mini  quasars '' .",
    "the first collapsed halos have masses near the cosmological jeans mass , @xmath18 , implying a virial temperature of a few hundred k. in order to form either stars or black holes , the gas in these halos must be able to cool efficiently . at this low temperature , the only mechanism in the chemically simple primordial gas that satisfies this requirement is collisional excitations of @xmath1 molecules . at still higher temperatures ( @xmath19k ) and masses ( @xmath20 ) , efficient cooling",
    "is enabled by atomic hydrogen . the presence or absence of @xmath1 molecules in",
    "the first collapsed halos therefore determines whether these small halos can form any stars or quasars , before larger halos dominate the collapsed baryonic fraction .",
    "as a consequence , the @xmath1 abundance determines when the `` dark age '' ends : if there is sufficient @xmath1 inside the first small halos , the dark age ends earlier ; if @xmath1 is absent , it ends at the later redshift when the larger scales collapse .    the fraction of @xmath1 molecules in the post ",
    "recombination igm is @xmath21 . in the absence of a background radiation field",
    ", this fraction rises to @xmath22 at the dense central regions of collapsed halos ( haiman et al .",
    "1996 ; tegmark et al .",
    "1997 ) , high enough to satisfy the cooling criterion . however , @xmath1 molecules are fragile , and are photo - dissociated efficiently by a low  intensity uv radiation . in a previous paper ( haiman et al .",
    "1997 , hereafter hrl97 ) , we showed that the flux necessary for @xmath1 photo ",
    "dissociation is several orders of magnitude smaller than the flux needed to reionize the universe .",
    "based on this result , we conjectured that the @xmath1 abundance in the first collapsed halos was suppressed soon after a small number of these halos formed stars or turned into mini",
    " quasars .",
    "this negative feedback would imply that the bulk of the first mini  galaxies or mini  quasars would reside in dark halos with masses at least @xmath23 , and that the `` dark age '' would end only at the typical collapse redshift of these halos .",
    "the first condensations at the @xmath24 times smaller jeans mass would then remain neutral , gravitationally confined gas clumps , until they merge into larger systems , or are photo  evaporated by the uvb established after reionization ( barkana & loeb 1998 ) . a small fraction of these clumps is expected to survive mergers and photo  evaporation until @xmath25 ; based on their column density and abundance , abel & mo ( 1998 ) have identified this survived fraction with the lyman limit systems observed near @xmath26 .",
    "a direct observational study of the first collapsed halos will be feasible in the future with the next generation space telescope ( ngst ) : with its @xmath27njy imaging sensitivity , ngst will be able to detect a @xmath28 halo with an average star formation efficiency at @xmath29 ( smith & koratkar 1998 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we study the conjecture of hrl97 in a cosmological setting , by quantifying the radiative feedback of the first collapsed halos on their @xmath30 abundance , as the early uvb is established in press  schechter models .",
    "the two main questions we address are : _ ( 1 ) how does the @xmath1 feedback effect the typical masses and collapse redshifts of the first halos _ ; and _ ( 2 ) could the first collapsed dark halos , with masses near the jeans mass , contribute to the early uvb , and to the reionization of the universe ? _    in hrl97 , we concluded that the negative feedback suppresses the fragmentation and collapse of small halos . in the present paper , we confirm this basic conclusion , although we find that it depends sensitively on the spectrum of the early sources .",
    "our calculations improve hrl97 in several ways .",
    "we solve the coupled evolution of the formation of new halos ( using the press ",
    "schechter formalism ) , the build  up of the early uvb , and the evolution of the @xmath1 abundance in the igm and inside each collapsed halo ; we explore the sensitivity of our conclusions on the spectral shape , specifically the x  ray to uv flux ratio ; we replace our assumption of homogeneous slabs by the centrally condensed profiles expected for virialized halos ; and we employ a more realistic star  formation criterion .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in   2 , we quantify the spectrum of the early uvb after processing through the intergalactic h and @xmath1 . in   3 , we compute the @xmath1 abundance in virialized halos under this uvb , and define our criterion for star  formation . in   4",
    ", we compute the evolution of the uvb coupled with the @xmath1feedback , and present these results in   5 . in   6 ,",
    "we discuss how these results are modified in the presence of early mini ",
    "quasars with spectra extending to the x  rays .",
    "finally ,   7 summarizes the main conclusions and implications of this work .    throughout this paper",
    ", we adopt a background @xmath31cdm cosmology with a tilted power spectrum , @xmath32 ; however , our results are relevant in any model where the cosmic structure is built hierarchically from the `` bottom up '' . for convenience",
    ", we also adopt the following terminology : a `` small halo '' is defined to be a halo with virial temperature @xmath33k , or equivalently , with mass @xmath34^{-3/2}$ ] .",
    "conversely , a `` large halo '' is defined as a halo with virial temperature @xmath19k , or equivalently , with mass @xmath35^{-3/2}$ ] .",
    "in hierarchical models of structure formation , small objects appear at high redshift , and larger objects form later , with the total fraction of collapsed baryons monotonically increasing with time . the radiation output associated with the collapsed halos gradually builds up a cosmic uv background . of interest here",
    "is the background in the 11.1813.6 ev range , enclosing the lyman and werner ( lw ) bands of molecular @xmath1 .",
    "photons in this range do not ionize neutral h atoms , and can travel to a large fraction of the hubble length across the igm , and photo  dissociate molecular @xmath1 both in the igm and inside other collapsed halos .",
    "since the presence of @xmath1 is a necessary condition for the formation of stars or a central black hole , this leads to a feedback that controls the fraction of collapsed baryons turned into luminous sources , and the evolution of the uvb . before addressing the feedback itself , in this section we quantify the spectral shape of the uvb in the relevant frequency range",
    "this is determined by the absorption of the flux by intergalactic h and @xmath1 .",
    "consider an observer at redshift @xmath36 , measuring the uvb at the local frequency @xmath37 , where @xmath38 .",
    "the photons collected at the frequency @xmath37 are arriving from sources located at @xmath39 , and have redshifted their original frequency @xmath40 to @xmath37 .",
    "if during its travel , the photon s frequency equals the frequency of any atomic lyman line , it is absorbed by the neutral igm , because the optical depth of the igm in these lines are exceedingly high , e.g. @xmath41 at @xmath42 .",
    "this statement applies to all lyman lines with @xmath43 .",
    "the ly@xmath11 absorption ( @xmath44 ) has only a small effect on the background , since most of the absorbed photons are simply re - emitted at the same frequency , except those converted to lower frequency photons by two  photon decays . in any case , the ly@xmath11 resonance is at 10.2 ev , outside the frequency range of interest here .",
    "the very high lyman lines ( @xmath45 ) have small enough cross  sections so that the total optical depth of the igm at these frequencies drops below unity . however , these resonances have a negligible contribution to the total absorption in the 11.8 - 13.6ev range . here",
    "we make the simple assumption that a `` dark screen '' blocks the view of all sources at redshifts above @xmath46 .",
    "the maximum redshift is given by @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the frequency of the lyman line closest from above to the observed frequency , @xmath37 .",
    "the processing of the early uvb by the neutral igm leads to a characteristic spectral shape , resembling a `` sawtooth '' , since the closer @xmath37 is to a resonance , the nearer the screen is to the observer .",
    "the resulting spectrum is shown in a specific model ( described below ) in figure  [ fig : sawtooth ] .",
    "the redshift distribution of sources is important for the magnitude of this `` sawtoothing '' effect .",
    "if a large fraction of the sources contributing to the uvb are located near the observer , then the effect is smaller ; if the sources are spread out over a wider range of redshifts , then the effect is larger . in the hierarchical models ,",
    "new halos form exponentially rapidly at high redshifts . at",
    "any given time , most of the sources are expected to have formed recently , i.e. at redshifts only slightly above that of the observer .",
    "since the formation rate of new halos decreases with redshifts , the sawtoothing will be increasingly pronounced at later times .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig : sawtooth ] : the flux is suppressed by a larger average factor at @xmath49 than it is at @xmath50 .",
    "in addition to absorption by neutral h , the uvb may also be modulated by the intergalactic @xmath1 .",
    "the @xmath1 in the igm removes photons from the uvb when these molecules are photo  dissociated , and decreases the rate of photo  dissociations inside collapsed halos .",
    "it is important , therefore , to assess the magnitude of the modulation from the intergalactic @xmath1 .",
    "when a lw photon is absorbed by an @xmath1 molecule , there is on average a @xmath52% chance that it causes a photo  dissociation of the molecule .",
    "this is the average probability that the molecule decays from its excited state to a continuum of two distinct h atoms ( solomon , cf .",
    "field et al .",
    "1966 ; stecher & williams 1967 )",
    ". we will assume here that in the other @xmath53 of absorptions , the lw photons is re - emitted at the same frequency , and there is no net effect .",
    "this is justified because the quadrupole transitions among the excited electronic states are much slower than decay back to the electronic ground state , and also because the small dipole moment that preferred the upper state in the absorption will preferentially populate the initial lower state in the decay ( herzberg 1950 ) .",
    "if the @xmath1 fraction in the igm is @xmath54 , then the total optical depth of the igm at redshift @xmath8 and frequency @xmath55 to @xmath1dissociations is given by @xmath56 where the sum is over the 76 lw lines of @xmath1 ; @xmath57 is the neutral h number density in the igm ; @xmath58 is the probability that absorption into the @xmath59 lw line is followed by a dissociative decay ; @xmath60 is the oscillator strength of the @xmath59 lw line ; @xmath61 ; @xmath62 is the line element in our @xmath31cdm cosmology ; and @xmath63 is the absorption line profile centered around the resonance frequency @xmath48 .",
    "we included the equilibrium ortho to para ratio of 3:1 of  implicitly in equation  ( [ eq : tauh2a ] ) by appropriately multiplying the oscillator strengths with 0.75 or 0.25 respectively .",
    "furthermore , we assume that the line shapes follow a voigt profile with thermal broadening by the igm temperature ( taken to be @xmath64k , although the total optical depth , and therefore our results , are insensitive to this choice ) .",
    "more information on the details of  pre  dissociation are given in the appendix .",
    "equation  [ eq : tauh2a ] gives a formal sum total optical depth of the 76 lw resonances , each of which is at a different frequency . from the point of view of a photon",
    "traveling across the igm , these resonances would be encountered at different redshifts . during its lifetime",
    ", a uv photon can therefore be subjected only to a subset of the lw resonances : as we argued in ",
    "2.1 above , the maximum redshift interval a uv photon can travel before it is absorbed by a neutral h atom corresponds to the redshift between two neutral h resonances .",
    "a simple calculation of the optical depth using equation  [ eq : tauh2a ] would result in an overestimate by a factor of a few ( depending on @xmath8 and @xmath55 ) of the true value relevant to the observed modulation of the uvb . to impose the fact that the uvb is _ simultaneously _ modulated both by the intergalactic h and @xmath1 , one needs to change the summation in equation  [ eq : tauh2a ] from @xmath65(1,76 ) to @xmath65(@xmath66,@xmath67 ) , where @xmath66 is the lw resonance closest in frequency from above to @xmath55 , and @xmath67 is the lw resonance farthest above @xmath55 before encountering an atomic lyman line ( see figure  [ fig : sawtooth ] and figure  [ fig : lw ] for visualizations of the relative location of the h and @xmath1 lines ) .    in figure  [ fig : igmh2 ] , we show the resulting optical depth as a function of the observed frequency , for two different redshifts , @xmath49 and @xmath50 . as the figure shows , the optical depth is largest at @xmath412.1ev .",
    "this is because the largest frequency gap between the atomic lines occurs between ly@xmath68 and ly@xmath69 , enclosing the largest subset of the @xmath1 lw lines with significant contributions to @xmath1 dissociations ( see figures  [ fig : sawtooth ] and [ fig : lw ] ) .",
    "figure   [ fig : igmh2 ] also shows that the maximum optical depth is 0.35 and 0.13 for @xmath50 and @xmath49 , respectively ( assuming @xmath70 ) .",
    "interestingly , the characteristic features in figure  [ fig : igmh2 ] depend only on the relative frequencies of atomic vs. molecular resonant absorption lines ( shown in figure  [ fig : lw ] ) , i.e. only on atomic and molecular physics .",
    "the total optical depths are near , but somewhat below unity .",
    "this result has several consequences .",
    "it is useful here to draw an analogy with the ionization of neutral h. the total optical depth of the igm to h photo  ionizations ( just above 13.6ev ) is @xmath71 ^ 3 $ ] , which justifies the simple picture of isolated hii regions ( `` strmgren spheres '' ) , each bounded by a sharp ionization front , and continuously expanding around each ionizing source .",
    "the situation with @xmath1 is different in two ways : the optical depth is less than unity , and is distributed among several lw lines , each of which is individually optically thin , and causes dissociations at a different redshift relative to each source . as a consequence ,",
    "no sharp @xmath1 dissociation `` front '' exists .",
    "a schematic sketch of four distinct regions in the radial structure of an @xmath30 photo  dissociation region is shown in figure  [ fig : pdr ] .",
    "region i extends to the usual ionization front or strmgren radius . inside this region ,",
    "the temperature is high ( @xmath72k ) , hydrogen is ionized ,  is photo  dissociated , and the  abundance tends to zero .",
    "region ii is defined to extend from @xmath73 to the radius @xmath74 , where the  photodissociation time becomes longer than the hubble time . here",
    "@xmath75 is the photon number flux in the lyman werner bands per second . in this region",
    "the temperature is that of the igm , and the  fractions are still low , but slowly rise to its background value of @xmath76 .",
    "since the optical depth in the lyman werner lines are very small , the dissociation front is significantly diluted .",
    "region iii is defined to extend from @xmath77 to the radius @xmath78^{-1.5}~{\\rm mpc}$ ] where lyman @xmath69 shifts to lyman@xmath68 . in this region",
    ", the source contributes to the soft uv background , but its flux is diminished by absorption into the atomic lyman series . in region",
    "iv beyond @xmath79 , all photons in the lyman werner bands are absorbed by an atomic lyman line .",
    "hence , at such large scales , an individual source does not contribute to the uvb and intergalactic  dissociation .",
    "although the maximum optical depths from the intergalactic @xmath1 are relatively small , the uvb flux can be suppressed by as much as @xmath80% .",
    "however , we are interested in the suppression of the @xmath1 photo  dissociation rate when the uvb falls on a collapsed halo . this suppression is smaller than 50% , since the photo  dissociation rate is given by a weighted average of the observed flux in the 11.1813.6ev range .",
    "we therefore define an `` effective '' optical depth @xmath81 , that directly characterizes the suppression of the @xmath1 photo  dissociation rate , as follows : @xmath82 @xmath83 , \\label{eq : dissoc } \\end{array}\\ ] ] @xmath84 .",
    "\\label{eq : tauave}\\ ] ] here @xmath85 is the uvb flux before processing by the intergalactic @xmath30 , and @xmath86 is the optical depth at this frequency shown by the solid lines in figure  [ fig : igmh2 ] . when the sources are assumed to be distributed according to the press",
    " schechter model ( see below ) , the maximum reduction in the @xmath1 photo  dissociation rate is 10% at @xmath50 and 4% at @xmath49 ( see the dashed lines in figure  [ fig : igmh2 ] ) .",
    "note , however , that these numbers assume a constant @xmath70 . in reality",
    "( as will be shown below ) , the intergalactic @xmath1 fraction drops sharply soon after the appearance of the first sources , before the uvb builds up to the level of causing any @xmath1 feedback inside the collapsed clumps .",
    "this is because the @xmath1 dissociation time in the igm , @xmath87 becomes shorter than the hubble time at @xmath88 , while the feedback on the dense clumps typically turns on only later , when the uvb reaches @xmath89 .    in summary",
    ", we have shown that the intergalactic @xmath1 might cause a maximum of @xmath90 suppression of the uvb near 12 ev , but the overall effect on the @xmath1 photo  dissociation rate is small : less than 10% , assuming a constant intergalactic @xmath1 fraction of @xmath91 .",
    "we will show below that the intergalactic @xmath1 fraction is substantially reduced , and therefore this small modulation disappears , by the redshifts of interest  when the uvb builds up to the levels to photo ",
    "dissociate @xmath30 molecules in dense collapsed clumps .",
    "in this section , we consider the behaviour of individual , centrally condensed gas clouds , when illuminated by an external uvb . here",
    ", we assume the uvb to have a fixed amplitude , and postpone the treatment of the coupled evolution of the uvb , and the @xmath1 abundance and star formation to   4 below .",
    "the radiative efficiency of a gas cloud by collisional excitations of @xmath30 molecules depends on the gas temperature , density , and @xmath1 abundance .",
    "although the typical average overdensity of a virialized spherical perturbation is @xmath92 , in a centrally condensed cloud , the central density can reach a much higher value .",
    "this is important in the present context , because the formation of @xmath1 molecules can be enhanced by the accelerated chemistry inside the central , dense regions .",
    "in addition , the total integrated column density of a centrally condensed cloud is higher than that of a homogeneous sphere with the same mass and density .",
    "central condensation therefore tends to make the clouds more self  shielding against the external uvb , and help to preserve the internal @xmath1 molecules .    to characterize the central condensation , here",
    "we adopt the density profiles of truncated isothermal spheres ( tis , shapiro et al .",
    "these profiles are especially convenient , since they have a one  to  one correspondence with the final virialized state of the spherical top  hats used in the press  schechter formalism .",
    "the spheres are isothermal at the virial temperature , their average overdensity is @xmath93 , and their central overdensity in the core reaches @xmath72 .",
    "the tis profiles are similar to the spherically averaged universal profiles found in numerical simulation of clusters ( nfw , navarro et al .",
    "1998 ) . the main difference from nfw is that the tis has a central core ( the existence of cores are indicated by recent simulations of galaxy groups , e.g. by kravtsov et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "we assume that the tis is composed of the nine species @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath1 , @xmath100 , and @xmath101 , with the initial abundances given by their post  recombination values ( anninos and norman 1996 ) .",
    "our results are insensitive to the precise initial conditions , such as the electron fraction ( @xmath102 ) and molecule fraction ( @xmath103 ) .",
    "although these abundances represent the chemical composition of the igm , and we start with a cloud that is already collapsed and virialized , this should not effect our final results .",
    "in 1d spherical simulations ( haiman , thoul & loeb 1996 ) , we have found that the abundances stay near their initial igm values until the formation of the virialization shock ; soon after virialization the abundances loose memory of their initial values .",
    "we solve the subsequent time evolution of the chemical abundances , as a function of radius throughout the cloud , assuming that the cloud is illuminated by the external uvb .",
    "the uvb flux is assumed to be a power law below 13.6ev , @xmath104 and to be zero above 13.6ev , since the flux from stellar sources would suppressed by several orders of magnitude by the neutral igm .",
    "the sawtooth modulation by the intergalactic h is described above , and the constant amplitude @xmath105 is in units of @xmath106 .",
    "our results are insensitive to the shape of the uvb , since we only utilize the flux between 11.18 and 13.6 ev .",
    "the possibility of a non  stellar flux , extending to higher energies will be discussed in section ",
    "6 below . the chemical reaction rates and cross  sections are taken from haiman , thoul & loeb ( 1996 ) .",
    "we have solved the radiative transfer across the cloud , assuming spherical symmetry , and included the self  shielding due to both h and @xmath1 .",
    "the initial conditions are specified by the virial temperature @xmath107 , and collapse redshift @xmath108 of the tis , and the amplitude of the uvb , @xmath105 .",
    "an illustrative example of the evolution of the @xmath1 abundance is shown in figures  [ fig : prof ] and  [ fig : evol ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : prof ] shows the radial profile of @xmath109 at 10 different time ",
    "steps , equally spaced in logarithmic time , during a time ",
    "interval that corresponds to the hubble time at @xmath110 , @xmath111 sec .",
    "the cloud is assumed to be a tis with @xmath112 and @xmath113k , and the amplitude of the uvb is taken to be @xmath114 . as figure  [ fig : prof ] shows ,",
    "initially the @xmath1 fraction rises in the core : this is because new @xmath1 molecules form via the charge transfer reactions @xmath115 and @xmath116 , utilizing the initial residual free electrons . by @xmath117 sec",
    ", @xmath109 reaches a value near @xmath22 ( cf .",
    "the lines labeled 16 ) . at this point , however , the free electron fraction has dropped by a factor of @xmath118 , and although the core is self  shielding , photo  dissociation becomes faster than  formation . as a consequence @xmath109 drops continuously , to a level below the initial @xmath119 by @xmath120 sec ( cf . the lines labeled 710 ) , while @xmath121 drops to @xmath122 .",
    "the evolution of @xmath109 at the core radius @xmath123 is also shown by the middle solid curves in figure  [ fig : evol ] for various @xmath105 .",
    "the shell at @xmath123 is normally representative of the whole core , because the density , as well as @xmath109 , is flat within @xmath124 ( in some cases , however , the @xmath1 fraction may still rise within the core , see   6 below ) .",
    "for comparison , in this figure we also show the evolution of @xmath109 in the same shell under less intense ( @xmath125 or @xmath126 ) or stronger ( @xmath127 or @xmath128 ) uv backgrounds . in the absence of any uvb ,",
    "the @xmath1 fraction rises continuously , and reaches @xmath129 in a hubble time ( top curve ) ; when a flux is turned on and increased ( bottom 4 solid curves ) , the @xmath1 fraction is continuously suppressed .    by performing similar calculations for clouds with virial temperatures and collapse redshifts in the ranges @xmath130k and @xmath131",
    ", we have found that the evolution shown in figures  [ fig : prof ] and  [ fig : evol ] remains qualitatively the same in all cases .",
    "however , the level of flux required at which the @xmath1 molecules are photo  dissociation depends on the values of both @xmath108 and @xmath132 .      in order for a cloud to fragment into stars , or continue collapsing to form a central black hole ,",
    "it is necessary for the gas to radiate efficiently .",
    "a rough estimate of the `` critical '' @xmath1 fraction can be obtained by requiring that the cooling time is shorter than either the dynamical time ( hrl97 ) , or the hubble time ( tegmark et al 1997 ) .",
    "here we adopt a somewhat more elaborate criterion for star formation , as follows . for a given combination of @xmath108 , @xmath107 , and @xmath105 ,",
    "the cloud is assumed to be able to cool if , at any time during its evolution , the cooling time in the core exceeds the `` present time '' , defined as the time elapsed since the formation of the cloud at @xmath108 .",
    "we assume this to be both a necessary and a sufficient criterion .",
    "this definition explicitly takes into account the behaviour of the @xmath1 fraction shown in figures  [ fig : prof ] and  [ fig : evol ] , especially the fact that the @xmath1 fraction in the core first rises and then declines again .",
    "our criterion imposes the requirement that the cloud not spend more than a cooling time at a given @xmath1 fraction , before the @xmath1 abundance is further reduced by photo  dissociation .",
    "this definition avoids star formation in a situation when the cooling time exceeds the dynamical time , but only for a brief interval that would be too short for a significant contraction to take place . in figure",
    "[ fig : evol ] , our criterion is implemented by requiring that the solid line ( the evolving @xmath1 fraction ) goes above the short  dashed line ( the critical @xmath1 fraction at which @xmath133 equals the present time @xmath134 ) .",
    "interestingly , we find that the cloud may undergo a brief interval during which it is self  shielding in the @xmath1 lw bands , but then may become optically thin again as the @xmath1 abundance drops due to subsequent photo  dissociation .",
    "this is demonstrated in figure  [ fig : evol ] : the long dashed line shows the value of @xmath109 that would imply an integrated @xmath1 column density of @xmath135 across the cloud , at which the lw lines become self  shielding . as the figure shows , if the flux is below @xmath136 , the @xmath1 fraction does temporarily rise above this critical value ; but for @xmath137 , our criterion for star formation is still not satisfied .",
    "this implies that self  shielding by itself does not guarantee that the molecules are preserved and enable efficient cooling . requiring the cloud simply to self",
    " shield would therefore not be a good star formation criterion . however , the decline in the  fraction is due to the decreasing electron abundance which lowers the  formation rate .",
    "hence , if an additional process keeps the @xmath138 fraction greater than @xmath139 , more  could be formed .",
    "this possibility is discussed in greater detail in   6 .      in addressing the effect of the feedback from the uvb ,",

    "schechter models , we have repeated the same calculation for a grid of values for @xmath143 , and @xmath144 . for each pair of values",
    ", we have found the critical flux for preventing star formation , @xmath140 .",
    "the resulting @xmath145 are shown in figure  [ fig : jmin ] .",
    "in general , the higher the density ( or @xmath146 ) or temperature , the higher the flux needs to be to prevent star formation .",
    "we have also found that for temperatures below @xmath147 , the value of the flux becomes irrelevant for star formation , because the cooling function of @xmath1 drops , and @xmath1 cooling is inefficient at these low temperatures , even in the absence of any flux .",
    "similarly , the value of the flux is irrelevant for @xmath148 , because at these high temperatures , cooling from ( collisional excitations of ) neutral h always dominates over @xmath1 cooling , i.e. stars can form irrespective of the @xmath1 abundance .",
    "the values of @xmath140 shown in figure  [ fig : jmin ] are relatively low . for reference ,",
    "the dashed curve in this figure shows the value of @xmath149 that corresponds to one ionizing photon per hydrogen atom , i.e. the minimum flux necessary to reionize the universe .",
    "_ since the values of the flux necessary to prevent star ",
    "formation are 24 orders of magnitude below this minimum reionizing flux , a negative feedback necessarily turns on prior to reionization_. if the star formation efficiency was a universal constant inside all halos that can cool efficiently , independent of redshift and halo size , then the negative feedback would turn on long before reionization  when the collapsed fraction of baryons @xmath150 is @xmath44 orders of magnitude smaller then it is at reionization  and it would last until @xmath150 rises by a factor of @xmath151 .",
    "since new sources appear exponentially fast in the press ",
    "schechter formalism , the relatively `` long '' interval in @xmath150 can translate into a `` short '' interval in redshift .",
    "however , it is clear from the above that the fundamental `` evolutionary parameter '' for the negative feedback , followed by reionization , is @xmath150 , rather than the redshift to which it translates to .",
    "our results may therefore vary in different cosmologies when stated in terms of redshift , but would be relatively robust to change in the background cosmology , when stated in terms of @xmath150 .",
    "finally , we emphasize that the actual redshift ( and @xmath150 ) interval between the turn  on of the negative feedback and reionization would be shorter if the star  formation efficiency in small halos is intrinsically much smaller than in large halos ( see discussion below ) .",
    "in this section , we put together the results of the previous sections to compute the redshift evolution of the uv background , the intergalactic @xmath1 fraction , and the mass  scale of the @xmath1 feedback .",
    "the latter is more conveniently expressed by defining a critical virial temperature , @xmath152 , that corresponds to the minimum size of a cloud that satisfies our star formation criterion under a fixed uv background @xmath105 and collapse redshift @xmath108 .",
    "the evolution of @xmath153 and the uvb amplitude , @xmath154 are then coupled together , since @xmath153 is directly determined by @xmath154 , and conversely , @xmath154 depends on the @xmath153 above which we allow halos to contribute to the uvb .",
    "as argued above , the evolution of the intergalactic @xmath1 can be considered separately , since it does not modulate the uvb at the level that would alter the @xmath1 photodissociation rate inside halos .",
    "our model is based on the press ",
    "schechter formalism .",
    "we assume that the mass  function of dark halos is given by the press ",

    "the mass function of collapsed baryonic clouds is obtained from @xmath156 by the simple replacement @xmath157 . for the smallest masses , near the jeans mass ( @xmath158 ) , we apply a correction to take into account the non  zero gas pressure in these clouds .",
    "this is achieved by replacing @xmath159 , where @xmath160 is the fraction of baryons that settle in the potential well of a dark halo of mass @xmath161 by redshift @xmath8 ( haiman & loeb 1997 ) .",
    "we use the mass  virial temperature relation of the tis solutions .",
    "although this relation was derived in a standard cdm cosmology , the scaling of @xmath107 with redshift is changed only negligibly in our @xmath31cdm cosmology at the high redshifts of interest .",
    "to parameterize the uncertainties regarding the ionizing photon production rate per collapsed baryon , we assume that each halo ( provided it satisfies the star formation criterion ) has a constant star formation rate for @xmath162 years , during which it turns a total fraction @xmath163 of its baryonic mass into stars with a scalo imf .",
    "this parameterization could correspond to different physical scenarios .",
    "for instance , @xmath163 would remain the same if the star formation rate in each halo was doubled , but the escape fraction of ionizing photons reduced to 50% .",
    "similarly , a nominal @xmath164 could correspond to a `` top heavy '' imf biased towards massive stars relative to scalo , so that the number of uv photons produced per collapsed baryons is increased . we do not attempt to summarize all the relevant uncertainties here ( instead , see haiman & loeb 1997 ) , and view @xmath162 and @xmath163 as representative parameters in the simplest possible model . it is important to note , however , that a combination of these parameters is constrained by the reionization redshift @xmath165 ( haiman & knox 1999 ) , requiring that a few ionizing photons per hydrogen atom be produced within this redshift interval .    within this model , we start from a high redshift ( @xmath166 ) , and take small redshift steps towards z=0 . at each step , the background flux is obtained by summing the flux of all sources that are within the imaginary redshift screen at @xmath46 as discussed in   2.1 , and satisfy the star formation criterion of   3.2 ,    @xmath167    where @xmath168 is the total emissivity from all luminous halos at redshift @xmath8 and frequency @xmath55 , @xmath169)}{dz^\\prime},\\ ] ] where @xmath170)$ ] is the total fraction of baryons in collapsed halos with virial temperatures above @xmath171 . here",

    "the evolution is qualitatively similar to the @xmath189 case : the @xmath1 feedback is active during the redshift interval @xmath190 , before reionization takes place at @xmath191 .",
    "the star formation in small halos is suppressed , and their contribution to the background flux at @xmath188 is only @xmath192 , less than in the @xmath189 case .",
    "this , however , is mostly an intrinsic effect , rather than a result of the negative feedback : as shown by the convergence of the top and bottom dashed curves , by the late time when reionization occurs , the background ionizing flux is anyway dominated by the large halos .",
    "the figure also shows that the negative feedback has a smaller effect than in the @xmath189 case ( the middle and top dashed lines differ by a smaller factor ) .",
    "this is because the background flux builds up more slowly , and the feedback is delayed to a later redshift . by this later redshift ,",

    "the negative feedback is more pronounced , and it suppresses star formation in a larger fraction of the small halos . the total contribution of small halos to the ionizing flux at @xmath196 in this case is @xmath197 . in the absence of the feedback",
    ", the small halos would dominate the flux by a factor of more than 10 at @xmath196 , and reionization would occur at @xmath198 .",
    "figures  [ fig : res4]  [ fig : res6 ] demonstrate the effect of increasing the source lifetime , @xmath162 to @xmath199 yrs .",
    "this long lifetime would also mimic the scenario in which constant mergers result in multiple recycling of the gas ( originally associated with a given halo ) for star formation . making the nominal lifetime",
    "longer is equivalent to decreasing the star formation rate , and has an effect similar to decreasing @xmath163 : the buildup of the background flux is now delayed ( although not eventually suppressed as it is when @xmath163 is decreased ) . as a result , the reionization redshift is delayed . when @xmath163=10% , then reionization is at @xmath200 , and the @xmath1 feedback takes place in the interval @xmath201 .",
    "the total contribution to the reionizing flux from small halos is nevertheless still negligible , only about 2% .",
    "figures  [ fig : res5 ] and  [ fig : res6 ] show what happens when @xmath163 is increased to 100 or 1000% ( note that it can not be decreased below 10% because then reionization would occur at @xmath202 ) . in both cases ,",
    "the @xmath1 feedback turns on before reionization , and small halos contribute a negligible amount to the reionizing flux ( @xmath203 at @xmath204 and @xmath205 at @xmath206 , respectively ) .    in summary , figures  [ fig : res1]  [ fig : res6 ]",
    "demonstrate that in all cases , the @xmath1 feedback suppresses star formation inside the small halos , and that the contribution of the small halos to the reionizing flux is always below 10% .",
    "if reionization occurs late , then the @xmath1 feedback makes little difference to the overall ionizing flux : the contribution from small halos to the reionizing flux is then small in any case , since by this late time , the collapsed baryon fraction , as well as the uv background , is dominated by the large halos even in the absence of the @xmath1 feedback .",
    "this is the case in figures  [ fig : res2 ] and  [ fig : res4 ]",
    ". this would be especially true in different cosmologies , where structure forms earlier , so that by the time of a late reionization , the dominance of larger halos is even more pronounced . although not important for reionization in these late  reionization models ,",
    "the @xmath1 feedback is still expected to occur . on the other hand , in models which would predict earlier reionization , primarily due to the small halos , the negative @xmath1 feedback is more pronounced . in these models , it is the feedback that limits the contribution of the small halos to reionization , and delays reionization until larger halos form .    although we have assumed a universal star formation efficiency , stars in small and large halos are likely to form differently , since the cooling mechanisms are different in the two cases .",
    "thus , there is no a  priori reason to expect the same star formation efficiency in these two different environments .",
    "there is a preliminary indication from 3d simulations that the efficiency in small halos might indeed be small ( @xmath207 , abel et al ) .",
    "if the star formation efficiency in the small halos were intrinsically much smaller than in the large halos , then the contribution to the flux from the small halos would be small , regardless of the @xmath1feedback .",
    "we emphasize that the @xmath1 feedback described here would still occur prior to reionization , since the flux from the rare large halos alone is sufficient to suppress star formation inside the small halos .",
    "note that this scenario is different from the one presented in , e.g. figure  [ fig : res1 ] , since in that case the small halos exert a feedback on their own population , while here the `` feedback '' is from a distinct population of larger halos .",
    "this is demonstrated explicitly in figures  [ fig : res1]  [ fig : res6 ] , where the dotted curves in each bottom panel shows the critical virial temperature @xmath171 , obtained from the uv background due only to the large halos . as these figures show , in all cases , @xmath171 still rises above @xmath183k and reaches @xmath184k before reionization .",
    "it is not surprising that the @xmath1 feedback generically occurs in any model that satisfies the reionization constraint by @xmath188 .",
    "this is because , as we have shown in   3.3 , the suppression of the @xmath1 abundance and star formation inside clouds with the relevant range of densities and temperatures requires a uv flux that is only a fraction @xmath208 of the minimum flux level required for reionization ( one photon per hydrogen atom ) .",
    "as the uvb builds up to the reionizing level , it must necessarily first reach the level at which the @xmath1 feedback sets in .",
    "so far , we have assumed that the early sources have `` stellar '' spectra , and have simply truncated the observed flux above 13.6 ev . since all of our results above depend on the flux only in a narrow frequency range below 13.6ev , they are indeed insensitive to the precise shape of the spectrum .",
    "an alternative possibility is that a halo collapsing at high redshift forms a central black hole , and turns into a `` mini  quasar '' , with a hard spectrum extending into the x - ray regime ( haiman & loeb 1998 ) .",
    "the ionization cross  section of neutral hydrogen drops rapidly with frequency ( as @xmath209 ) , and at frequencies above @xmath210kev , the neutral igm is optically thin .",
    "if the spectra of the early sources have a non  negligible contribution at these frequencies , they would establish an early x  ray background ( xrb ) , and change the chemistry qualitatively .    the importance of the x  rays is that they provide additional free electrons , both by direct photo  ionization of h and he , as well as indirectly , by collisional ionization of h by the fast photo  electrons .",
    "the resulting extra free electrons catalyze the formation of @xmath211 , and therefore tend to increase the @xmath1 abundance . in an earlier paper ( hrl96 )",
    ", we have found that inside dense regions ( @xmath212 ) , the overall effect of a background flux extending to hard x  rays is to enhance , rather than to suppress , the @xmath1 abundance .",
    "the central densities of centrally condensed virialized clouds are expected to reach @xmath213 . in the case of the tis solutions adopted here ,",
    "this density is exceeded for halos that collapse at @xmath214 , and therefore a positive feedback is expected when the uv and x  ray backgrounds together illuminate these halos .    in order to illustrate the effect of the x  rays",
    ", we have recomputed the evolution of the @xmath1 profiles in the tis models .",

    "the fiducial value for @xmath219 was chosen based on a comparison of background fluxes computed in our press  schechter model with and without absorption by neutral h and he at @xmath110 .",
    "the units of @xmath105 are @xmath220 .",
    "we have also introduced a parameter @xmath221 to characterize the ratio of x  ray to uv flux : for pure stellar sources , @xmath222 ; for typical quasar spectra ( elvis et al . ) , @xmath223 .",
    "values of @xmath221 in  between 0 and 1 could describe either miniquasars with softer spectra , or a mixed population of stars and mini  quasars .",
    "we have verified that our conclusions are not sensitive to the upper energy cutoff , provided this cutoff is above @xmath41kev .    in figure",
    "[ fig : xrays ] , analogously to figure  [ fig : evol ] , we show the evolution of the @xmath1 fraction at the core radius of a tis . for this illustrative example , we assumed that the tis has @xmath224 and @xmath225k , and that it is illuminated by a flux with @xmath226 and @xmath227 and 1 , corresponding to increasing amounts of x  ray contribution .",
    "as in the example shown in figure  [ fig : evol ] , in the absence of any flux the @xmath1 fraction rises continuously , in this case to @xmath228 ( dotted curve ) . if the uvb is turned on , the final @xmath1 fraction is suppressed to @xmath229 ( bottom solid curve ) . however , if increasing amounts of x ",
    "rays are also added ( solid curves , second and third from the bottom ) , then the @xmath1suppression ( relative to the dotted curve ) is less pronounced .",
    "we find that a @xmath4 10% x - ray contribution ( @xmath230 ) is enough to keep the @xmath1 fraction at a high enough level ( @xmath231 ) that satisfies our star formation criterion .",
    "this is seen in figure  [ fig : xrays ] , as the solid curve labeled @xmath232 reaches the short  dashed curve . for still larger x  ray contributions ,",
    "the final @xmath1 fraction is even higher .",
    "it is interesting to note that deeper inside the cloud , the sign of the feedback is entirely reversed , and the @xmath1 abundance is _ increased _ relative to the case with no flux .",
    "the top solid curve in figure  [ fig : xrays ] shows the @xmath1 fraction at the center @xmath233 , rather than at the core radius , in the @xmath234 case .",
    "indeed , @xmath109 rises above @xmath129 , and reaches a @xmath235 value than it would in the absence of any background flux .",
    "figure  [ fig : xrayprof ] shows the profile of @xmath109 across the cloud at various time",
    " steps , and demonstrates that the @xmath1 fraction still rises within the core ( @xmath124 ) by over an order of magnitude . as described above , the enhancement of the final @xmath1 fraction is due to the additional free electrons produced by the x  rays .",
    "the bottom panel in figure  [ fig : xrays ] shows the evolution of the electron fraction in each case : as expected , @xmath121 is increased by the presence of x  rays .    by experimenting with different combinations of @xmath108 and @xmath132",
    ", we have found that the situation shown in figure  [ fig : xrays ] is typical of collapsed clouds with @xmath143 and @xmath236k .",
    "generally , a @xmath237 contribution by x  rays to the flux is sufficient to keep the @xmath1 fraction high enough to allow star formation , and hence to eliminate the negative feedback caused by the uv background .",
    "to arrive at this conclusion , we have imposed our star ",
    "formation criterion at the core radius @xmath123 .",
    "however , we have also found that at still smaller radii , the @xmath1 fraction is typically much larger , and can rise above the value expected in the absence of any background flux . inside the core , net feedback on the @xmath1 fraction is therefore positive , rather than negative . in summary , we expect that if the early background had a non  negligible contribution from `` mini  quasars '' with hard spectra , extending to @xmath27 kev , then the negative @xmath1 feedback described here would not occur .",
    "we have examined the build  up of the uv background in hierarchical models , based on the press  schechter formalism , and its effect on star formation inside small halos that collapse prior to reionization .",
    "we have confirmed our previous conjecture that there exists a negative feedback before reionization .",
    "star formation inside small halos shuts off prior to reionization , as an early uv background below builds up below 13.6 ev , and suppresses the @xmath1 abundance in these halos .",
    "we have also found that as a result , the contribution to the reionizing flux from the small halos is limited to be less than a @xmath410% percent in any hierarchical model .",
    "it is possible that the star formation efficiency via @xmath1 cooling in small halos is intrinsically small , as indicated by recent 3d simulations ( abel et al . ) .",
    "the efficiency can also be kept low by internal feedback mechanisms inside each halo , such as destruction of @xmath30 molecules by an internal uv source ( silk 1977 , omukai & nishi 1999 ) , or blow  out of the gas by supernovae ( mac low & ferrara 1998 ) . in this case , the contribution of the small halos to reionization can be negligible regardless of the existence of the negative feedback .",
    "however , we have shown that the negative feedback would still occur from the flux of the large halos alone .",
    "another possibility is that even though the integrated star formation efficiency is high , the star formation rate is low , so that the uv flux is built up with a significant delay relative to the collapse of the halos . in this scenario , reionization occurs late ( near @xmath5 ) , when the collapsed baryon fraction is already dominated by large halos .",
    "again , in this case , the negative feedback would still occur early on , but would not have a significant effect on reionization .",
    "more generally , we have shown that the contribution of the small halos to the reionizing flux is small in essentially any model where the first collapsed halos do not produce hard ( e@xmath2381kev ) x  rays .",
    "the reason for this is that the flux necessary to suppress the @xmath1 abundance and cooling in small halos is @xmath239 times lower than the minimum flux necessary for reionization , corresponding to an one uv photon per baryon .",
    "finally , we have shown that the negative feedback would be turned into a positive one if there was a significant ( @xmath23810% ) contribution to the early uv background from `` mini  quasars '' with hard spectra extending to the x ",
    "rays ( upto @xmath41kev ) . in this case , the x ",
    "rays catalyze the formation of @xmath1 molecules by providing additional electrons , and the overall effect is to enhance , rather then to suppress , the @xmath1 abundance .",
    "the evolution of the small early halos is therefore distinctly different in stellar and mini ",

    "the bulk of the intergalactic h@xmath240 is in the lowest states vibrational and rotational state of the ground electronic state .",
    "hence only v=0 with j=0 ( para ) and 1 ( ortho ) are populated .",
    "there are numerous lyman werner band transitions that can yield photo - dissociation via a decay from excited electronic states to the continuum of two distinct h atoms .",
    "these are typically classified as r or p transitions , depending on whether the rotational quantum number changes by -1 or + 1 from the electronic ground to the electronic excited state ( angular momentum must change due to parity conservation ) .",
    "hence , assuming that both para and ortho hydrogen molecules are abundant in their ground states , all r(0 ) [ i.e. @xmath241 , r(1 ) [ i.e. @xmath242 , and p(1 ) [ i.e. @xmath243 transitions are possible , for each excited vibrational level .",

    "branch , however , the @xmath250 are quite significant ( especially for @xmath251 of the werner band ) .",
    "as the figure shows , photons with @xmath252 do not contribute significantly to the dissociation rate due to their small @xmath253 .",
