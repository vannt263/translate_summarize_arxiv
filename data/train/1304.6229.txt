    "then this author @xcite found the secular equation for surface ( rayleigh ) waves propagating on a semi - infinite deformed body made of bell - constrained material .",
    "next @xcite the surface stability of such a half - space under compression was analyzed and compared with that of incompressible rubber .",
    "now the propagation of interface ( stoneley ) waves is considered for two rigidly bonded semi - infinite bodies made of distinct bell materials .",
    "each half - space was subjected to a finite homogeneous predeformation and the principal axes of each deformation are assumed to coincide at the interface , which is a common principal plane . moreover ,",
    "the interfacial wave is assumed to propagate in a principal direction .",
    "these common @xcite restrictions aside , a general necessary and sufficient condition of existence of a stoneley wave is established , together with the corresponding secular equation .    these general results are obtained in section 3 , after the basic equations of the problem have been written in section 2 . for purposes of comparison and contrast ,",
    "these latter equations are written in a manner which is similar to those governing the propagation of interfacial waves in deformed hyperelastic materials subject to the constraint of incompressibility , det @xmath2 .",
    "then in section 4 , the analysis is specialized to the case where the infinite body made of the two bonded half - spaces is uniformly prestrained , that is when the principal stretch ratios of strain are the same for the upper half - space and for the lower half - space . for `` simple hyperelastic bell '' materials , the influence of the initial deformation on the wave speed",
    "is highlighted .",
    "as the half - spaces are more and more compressed , this speed tends to zero and the secular equation gives the `` neutral equation '' .",
    "the critical stretch ratios , at which the neutral equation is reached , are obtained . in the case of a plane prestrain , these critical stretches , and the corresponding ones for `` bell s empirical model '' , are compared with the critical stretches obtained by biot @xcite for the interfacial stability of ( incompressible ) neo - hookean materials , often used to model rubber .",
    "the conclusion is that , as far as interfacial stability is concerned , rubber may be compressed more than bell s empirical materials , but not as much as bell simple hyperelastic materials , before the critical stretches are reached .",

    "the principal axes of these deformations along @xmath21 , and @xmath22 and @xmath23 , two orthogonal directions in the @xmath3 plane . hence the finite deformations are described in the coordinate system of the principal axes by @xmath24 where the @xmath25 , @xmath26 are the principal stretch ratios for each half - space . for the lower half - space we have @xmath27 and",

    "so does @xmath36 , the equivalent starred version for the upper half - space .",
    "finally , the half - spaces are rigidly bounded . at the interface @xmath3 , the continuity of the tractions imposes that @xmath37 the half - spaces are maintained in these deformed states @xmath38 , @xmath39 by the application at infinity of the loads @xmath40 , @xmath41 .",
