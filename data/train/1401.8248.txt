    "the nh@xmath0(1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) and @xmath1-c@xmath0h@xmath2  data presented in this work reveal a number of features which definitely confirm an interaction of the infrared shells created by the lbv star with the irdc .",

    "i , we report also an abundance increase to the north of g79a , but could not accurately determine its position because we used effelsberg data alone . in this paper",
    "we find that the nh@xmath0  increase takes place precisely at the position where rizzo et al .",
    "( 2008 ) report a shock in co(32 ) .",
    "overall , this suggests that the north(western ) part of the g79a clump is being shocked by the expanding shell of the lbv star , releasing nh@xmath0  molecules from the dust grains back to the gas phase .",

    "2011 ) model the effects of the propagation of a c - type shock into dense ( @xmath53  @xmath50 ) interstellar material , including the sputtering of dust grains , and predict an increase in nh@xmath0  abundance from 10@xmath54 up to @xmath55 , depending on the particular conditions of the shock and pre - shock material .",
    "this nh@xmath0  abundance increase is consistent with our observations , and the physical conditions adopted in the model are also consistent with those in g79a , as the density in g79a is estimated to be @xmath53  @xmath50  ( section  4 ) , and the velocity required for efficient sputtering of dust grains is @xmath56  km  s@xmath3  ( van loo et al .",
    "2013 ) , similar to the shock velocity measured by rizzo et al .",
    "an increase of nh@xmath0  abundance in cores shocked by the passage of an outflow * is * also observed in star - forming regions , such as hh2 ( torrelles et al .",
    "1992 ; girart et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "further evidence of the gas in g79a being shocked comes from the ` hot slab ' found near the g79a peak ( fig .",
    "[ fhotspots ] ) .",
    "the different velocity components and @xmath26 of this ` hot slab ' are fully consistent with the effelsberg spectrum of nh@xmath0(3,3 ) near the same position ( paper i ) .",
    "thus , the high angular resolution data reported in this work allowed us to locate the origin of the nh@xmath0(3,3 ) hot velocity components discovered with single - dish .",
    "the facts that no mid / far - infrared point - sources are associated with the ` hot slab ' , that it is located at the interface between the lbv shell and the g79a peak , that it is elongated along the shell direction , and that their velocities are slightly different to that of the irdc , all indicate that this ` hot slab ' is probably produced by shocks generated by the expanding shell from the lbv star .",
    "furthermore , our study suggests that the interaction of the lbv shell with the g79a clump is not only through shocks , but also radiative .",
    "this is suggested by a temperature enhancement ( up to 1213  k ) extending @xmath41 in the south - western part of the g79a clump , which is almost devoid of mid / far - infrared sources and thus could be produced by external heating .",
    "moreover , in this southwestern region of g79a , @xmath1-c@xmath0h@xmath2  seems to trace the outer layers of the clump as compared to nh@xmath0  ( fig .",
    "as expected in photon - dominated regions ( pdrs ) , nh@xmath0  is photo - destroyed in the outer parts of the pdr , while @xmath1-c@xmath0h@xmath2  is known to survive in hot regions ( @xmath57  k ) for several 10@xmath58 yr ( hassel et al .",
    "2011 ; aikawa et al .",
    "2012 ) , as shown also by recent observations of the horsehead nebula and mon r2 pdrs ( rizzo et al .  2005 ; gerin et al .  2009 ; pilleri et al .",
    "the strong 24  @xmath34 m  emission surrounding not only the northern side of g79a but also the western and southern edges ( fig .",
    "5 ) is consistent with this scenario .",
    "interestingly , the outer infrared shell lies exactly to the south of g79a ( jimnez - esteban et al .  2010 ; umana et al .",
    "2011 ) , and the irdc is interrupted exactly to the west of g79a ( fig .  5 ; paper i ) , where the circular geometry of the inner shell is distorted ( umana et al .",
    "thus , the southern and western edges of the g79a clump seem to be bathed by ( mid - infrared ) radiation probably coming also from the lbv star .",
    "+ the characterization of the dense gas surrounding the g79.29 + 0.46 nebula , as well as the presented details of the interaction of the nebula with the irdc , constitute an excellent base for future modeling of the mass - loss episodes of the underlying lbv star .",
    "in addition , in paper i we show that the irdc is probably located in between the dr15 massive - star forming region and the lbv nebula g79.29 + 0.46 .",
    "the results presented in this work show for the first time clear evidence that the lbv ejecta and the irdc are interacting .",
