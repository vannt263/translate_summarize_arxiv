    "the study of social networks , representing interactions between humans or groups , is a subject of broad research interest . in recent years",
    ", tools from network analysis have been applied to sports .",
    "for example , @xcite developed a network approach to quantify the performance of individual players in soccer .",
    "@xcite studied the complex network structure of brazilian soccer players . @xcite introduced a general model - free approach to elucidate the outcome of a soccer match .",
    "network analysis tools have been applied to football ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , baseball ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and basketball ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite studied the head - to - head matchups between major league baseball pitchers and batters as a bipartite network ( @xcite ) .",
    "the advantage of a network representation of any real system is that it gives the global view of the entire system and the interaction between individuals reflecting self - emergent phenomena .    in this paper",
    "we apply tools of social network analysis to cricket .",
    "cricket is a popular sport around the world and is played mostly in the erstwhile english colonies .",
    "its popularity is the highest in the indian subcontinent . despite series of controversies involving match fixing , spot fixing and ball tampering , the sport has managed to maintain international attention as well research interests(@xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "currently there are ten countries that have been granted test status by international cricket council ( icc ) - australia ( aus ) , bangladesh ( ban ) , england ( eng ) , india ( ind ) , new zealand ( nz ) , pakistan ( pak ) , south africa ( sa ) , sri lanka ( sl ) , west indies ( wi ) and zimbabwe ( zim ) .",
    "the reliance icc rankings is the official guide used to evaluate the performance of teams as well as the players .",
    "ranking schemes are based on points that are acquired by a team after a tournament . as mentioned by @xcite , due to the opacity of the ranking schemes ,",
    "the methods used by icc are still not comprehensible . again in cricket the captain is responsible for the team .",
    "before the game starts the home captain tosses the coin and the touring captain calls heads or tails . the captain chooses the batting order , sets up fielding positions and shoulders the responsibility of on - field decision - making . thus the outcome of a match depends on the captain s decisions .",
    "additionally , the captain is also responsible at all times for ensuring that play is conducted within the spirit of the game as well as within the laws . in this sense ,",
    "the success of a team depends on the captain .",
    "however , currently there exist no ranking schemes to rank the cricket captains .",
    "in this paper we numerically estimate the success of a team as well as the captain by analyzing the network of interaction of competing teams and also the captains .",
    "the primary goal of the paper is to elucidate the impact of network structure on rankings of teams and also that of the cricket captains .",
    "while the number of wins is a natural measure for success of a team , it does not provide a full picture of the ` quality ' of win .",
    "we are thus motivated to study an alternative method to assess the quality of a win .",
    "for example , a win against australia or south africa carries more importance than a win against a lesser team .",
    "this is analogous to the citation networks in which the effect of citation coming from an important paper is greater than that coming from a less popular one .",
    "the pagerank algorithm ( @xcite ) , a network - diffusion - based algorithm has emerged as leading method to rank scientists ( @xcite ) , papers ( @xcite ) .",
    "more recently @xcite applied pagerank algorithm to rank tennis players . in this paper",
    "we apply the pagerank algorithm to rank cricket teams and also identify the most successful cricket captain .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , we define and characterize the cricket - team network and provide a description of the pagerank algorithm that we employ as a ranking scheme across eras and also in the history of cricket ( @xmath4 ) . in section 3 , we discuss the results and we conclude in section 4 .",
    "data were collected from the website of cricinfo ( _ http://www.espncricinfo.com/_ ) .",
    "we downloaded the information of results and also the captains who led their respective teams from the score - cards . for a single match",
    ", the score - card keeps track of information about the teams , the runs scored by batsmen , wickets taken by bowlers , the names of captains who led their respective teams and the result of a match .",
    "we collected the data for test matches ( @xmath5 ) and one day international ( odi ) cricket ( @xmath6 ) . in our analysis",
    "we have excluded the matches with no results and matches which were abandoned .",
    "we analyze the network of cricket teams by analyzing the head - to - head encounter of competing teams .",
    "a single match is represented by a link between two opponents .",
    "thus if team @xmath7 wins against team @xmath8 , a directed link is drawn from @xmath8 to @xmath7 ( figure  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "a weighted representation of the directed network is obtained by assigning a weight @xmath9 to the link , where @xmath9 is equal to the fraction of times team @xmath8 wins against team @xmath7 .",
    "we quantify the relevance of matches with the use of a complex network approach equivalent to the one used for the computation of the pagerank score .",
    "mathematically , the process is described by the following set of equations    @xmath10    where @xmath9 is the weight of a link and @xmath11 = @xmath12 is the out - strength of a link .",
    "@xmath13 is the pagerank score assigned to team @xmath7 and represents the fraction of the overall `` influence '' sitting in the steady state of the diffusion process on vertex @xmath7 ( @xcite ) . in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : pg ] ) , @xmath14 $ ] is a control parameter that accounts for the importance of the various terms contributing to the score of the nodes and @xmath15 is the total number of teams in the network . the term @xmath16 represents the portion of the score received by node @xmath7 in the diffusion process according to the hypothesis that vertices redistribute their entire credit to neighboring nodes .",
    "@xmath17 stands for a uniform redistribution of credit among all nodes .",
    "the term @xmath18 serves as a correction in the case of the existence of dangling nodes ( i.e. , nodes with null out - degree ) , which otherwise would behave as sinks in the diffusion process .",
    "width=528 ]    traditionally , the choice of @xmath19 is set at @xmath20 ( @xcite ) .",
    "hence , we set @xmath21 and run the ranking scheme on networks of cricket teams and also on their captains . in table",
