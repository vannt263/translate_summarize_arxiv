    "the mean intensity at all radii should therefore be enhanced relative to the optically - thin case by a factor of @xmath67 . however",

    "detection of redshifted 21 cm emission from the regions of quasars will require the presence of a uv background .",
    "background photons between the ly@xmath0 and the lyman - limit frequencies can propagate through the universe and redshift with time to the point where they resonate with the ly@xmath0 line and couple @xmath95 to @xmath96 .",
    "such a background is expected to be present at @xmath97 since the large electron scattering optical depth measured by wmap ( kogut et al .",
    "2003 ) implies that the igm had been significantly reionized by that time ( requiring the production of more than one ionizing photon per baryon above the lyman - limit ) .",
    "our result for the scattering rate should be compared with the result of madau , meiksin & rees  ( 1997 ) who estimated @xmath98 in the steady state this expression incorrectly neglects the rise in intensity that follows from the small diffusion speed of photons near the ly@xmath0 resonance and hence underestimates the value of @xmath44 by a factor of @xmath99 which amounts to several orders of magnitude .",

    "the scattering of ly@xmath0 photons may also provide a source of heating for the gas . as this peak shifts to longer wavelengths , it loses energy to the hydrogen atoms off which the photons scatter ( chen & miralda - escude  2003 ) . the additional energy density due to the scattering is @xmath100 the rate at which energy is lost from the line in an expanding igm equals the heating rate of the gas .",

    "the luminous high redshift quasars reside in rare high - density regions .",

    "an instrument like _ lofar _ is expected to have a band - pass of @xmath124mhz .",
    "this should be compared with the frequency shift associated with the redshift difference between light emitted at the quasar and the edge of the region along the line of sight @xmath125 since many channels are contained within each band - pass , the structure of the region can therefore be probed along the line - of - sight in frequency space ( madau , meiksin & rees  1997 ) , allowing determination of the full three dimensional shape of the region , including the radius of the region behind the quasar in addition to the radius @xmath30 of the region in front of the quasar .",
    "there are two distinct possibilities for the redshifted 21 cm signature of a high redshift region .",
    "first , the region might be expanding into a cold igm , in which case emission will only be seen out to a radius where the warming x - rays can reach .",
    "alternatively , the igm may have been pre - heated , either by an x - ray background , by gravitationally induced shocks in the igm ( furlanetto & loeb  2003 ) , or by an early reionization ( e.g. wyithe & loeb  2003a ; cen  2003 ) .",
    "the presence of gunn - peterson troughs in quasar spectra at @xmath1 implies an igm that is at least partially neutral , while the relatively small sizes of the strmgren spheres around these quasars suggest a neutral fraction that is of order unity ( wyithe & loeb  2004 ) . on the other hand , observations from wmap ( kogut et al .",
    "2003 ) suggest an optical depth to electron scattering of @xmath126 and therefore significant reionization at @xmath127 .",
    "if the universe were reionized twice , then the strmgren spheres would be expanding into a partially neutral , but warm igm .",
    "the most natural place to search for the redshifted 21 cm signature of quasar regions is around the highest redshift quasars discovered in wide field surveys such as the _ sloan digital sky survey _ ( sdss ) .",
    "such quasars have regions that are also probed via their ly@xmath0 absorption spectra . in this section",
    "we discuss the complimentary nature of the two observations with respect to the determination of the quasar lifetime , @xmath12 , and the neutral fraction of the igm , @xmath117 .",
    "strmgren spheres expand faster into a partially ionized igm . if the igm has a neutral fraction @xmath117 , then the observation of @xmath30 through ly@xmath0 absorption measures the combination @xmath128 ( where here we have neglected recombinations and assumed @xmath129 for simplicity ) .",

    "they found a power - law @xmath171 with @xmath172 .",
    "this slope may be extended into the x - ray regime based on the results of yuan , brinkmann , siebert & voges  ( 1998 ) .",
    "we include the ly@xmath0 emission line centered at @xmath173 , with an equivalent width of @xmath174(vanden berk et al .",
    "2001 ; telfer , zheng , kriss & davidsen  2002 ) , and a line width of @xmath175(vanden berk et al .",

    "1994 ) , and it yields an ionizing photon rate of @xmath179s@xmath43 , representative of the @xmath180 sdss quasars ( white et al .",
    "2003 ) . in this section ,",
    "we show examples of the 21 cm emission signal that may be observed around the known very high redshift quasars , with the spectrum described by equation  ( [ spec ] ) .",
    "the level of redshifted 21 cm emission is enhanced through heating of the igm by the quasar x - ray emission .",
    "the corresponding heating rates @xmath181 of the above quasar spectrum are plotted as a function of radius in figure  [ fig3 ] .",
    "the three curves correspond to radii where photons traversed path lengths through neutral gas of @xmath182 , 0.1@xmath11 and 0.9@xmath11 .",
    "the neutral fraction was set to unity in these examples .",
    "note that lower neutral fractions lead to higher values of @xmath108 and hence larger heating rates .",
    "if the strmgren spheres expand into a pre - heated igm containing a uv background that coupled the spin temperature of the igm to its kinetic temperature , the regions should appear as holes in the sky of redshifted 21 cm emission .",
    "as an example we first consider an igm that is pre - heated to @xmath183k at @xmath184 ( @xmath185 ) .",
    "we follow the evolution of the strmgren sphere , and at each time compute the heating rate of the igm beyond the edge of the region using equation  ( [ heat ] ) .",
    "the evolution of the kinetic temperature of the igm is followed on a grid using equation  ( [ temp ] ) .",
    "the spin temperature is then set to @xmath91 as appropriate in the presence of a strong ly@xmath0 background .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] shows four examples of the 21 cm emission signature of a stromgren sphere expanding into a warm igm as a function of radius ( top axes ) and apparent angle ( bottom axes ) for different combinations of @xmath186 and @xmath187 .",
    "an initial value of @xmath129 was assumed .",
    "the y - axes are labeled by the differential antenna temperature @xmath130 ( right axes ) , and the flux @xmath188 ( left axes ) assuming the design goal sensitivity of _ lofar _ @xmath189 and a top - hat beam with a diameter of @xmath190 . in each case , four profiles are shown for observing times corresponding to quasar ages of @xmath191yr at the time when the _ optical photons _ observed along the line - of - sight were emitted .",
    "the lower row includes cases with @xmath192 . the smaller neutral fraction results in larger radii , faster relativistic expansion , and therefore thinner emission shells .",
    "the 21 cm emission signal is weaker in this case because @xmath193 .",
    "there is excess emission above the level of the general igm in a ring covering the region where gas has been heated by the quasar .",
    "however the brightness temperature is only slightly higher than the rest of the igm .",
    "this is due to the temperature dependence of @xmath194 which asymptotes to a constant value of @xmath195mk for high temperatures .",
    "the panels on the right show examples with @xmath196 . the lower transverse flux results in an expansion that becomes sub - relativistic at earlier times .",
    "as a result , the emission shell has a smaller radius and a larger thickness .    as our second example we consider an igm that is cold in neutral regions [ @xmath197 , corresponding to adiabatic cooling following the thermal decoupling of the baryons from the cmb ] .",
    "the resulting 21 cm signal is shown in figure  [ fig5 ] .",
    "the heated portions of the igm beyond the edge of the region show emission , while the cold igm produces absorption of the cmb at larger radii .",
    "the brightness temperature of the emission ring obtains values of @xmath198mk , smaller in amplitude than the absorption signal of @xmath199mk .",
    "a cold igm therefore offers the best contrast for observation of the transverse extent of the region . as in the previous example",
    ", the emission rings get thicker at late times because the expansion speed becomes less relativistic .",
    "since the transverse expansion becomes sub - relativistic sooner than the line - of - sight expansion , the rings become thick at earlier times for a lower value of @xmath153 .",
    "figure  [ fig6 ] shows @xmath200 ( solid dark lines ) as well as the inner radius of the 21 cm emission ring ( solid light lines ) for the example presented in the top left panels of figures  [ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] ( @xmath165 , @xmath201 ) .",
    "the four epochs corresponding to the differential antenna temperature profiles plotted in figures  [ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] are indicated by the vertical tick marks .",
    "similarly , values of @xmath30 at @xmath202yr are indicated by tick marks in the panels of figures  [ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] .",
    "the value of @xmath30 is always larger than the radius of 21 cm emission .",
    "the dashed lines show the velocity at which the edge of the region is moving when observed at a time corresponding to @xmath34 .",
    "the 21 cm ring ( light dashed lines ) is observed at an earlier phase of evolution and so is moving at a higher velocity .",
    "the edge of the region is moving at a speed @xmath203 when @xmath204mpc .",
    "the presence of a ly@xmath0 background has very interesting implications for the observation of fossil regions .",
    "the recombination time within an ionized region of the igm at mean density is @xmath205^{-3}$ ] years , where @xmath206@xmath207s@xmath43 is the case - b recombination coefficient at a temperature of @xmath208k .",
    "thus , the recombination time at the mean cosmic density exceeds the hubble time for @xmath209 .",
    "once a quasar has turned off , it therefore leaves behind a fossil region that survives recombination .",
    "this region will therefore remain detectable in redshifted 21 cm radiation in both scenarios discussed in this paper .",
    "since the bright sdss quasars are likely to be active for only @xmath210 of the time ( wyithe & loeb  2003b ) , there should be of order 100 times as many 21 cm emission rings around fossil regions as around active quasars .",
    "furthermore , the hierarchical buildup of the supermassive black holes powering the quasars would result in an even larger number of small fossil regions .",
    "how many regions should an instrument like _ lofar _ detect ?",
    "it is anticipated that near frequencies of @xmath211mhz , the virtual core of the planned instrument _ lofar _ will have a beam - size of @xmath212 , a resolution of several tens of arc - minutes , and a system temperature of @xmath213k .",
    "the instrument will have an effective collecting area of @xmath214m@xmath215 at this frequency , leading to a resolution of @xmath216 for the telescope in a filled aperture mode .",
    "higher resolutions are obtained by spreading the array out over longer baselines , at the cost of decreased sensitivity . from the radiometer equation ( e.g. burke & graham - smith  1997 ) we can find the root - mean - square noise in the brightness temperature as a function of resolution on angular scales @xmath217 of @xmath218 here",
    "@xmath219 is the detector band - pass , and @xmath220 is the integration time .",
    "the noise in the brightness temperature is constant on scales larger than @xmath221 .",
    "the root - mean - square noise for an observation with a resolution @xmath222 therefore becomes comparable to the expected emission signal ( @xmath223mk ) for a modest integration time of @xmath224hr .",
    "the co - moving optical luminosity function of bright quasars at @xmath225 in units of @xmath226gpc@xmath227 ( fan et al .",
    "2003 ) is @xmath228 where @xmath229 is the logarithmic slope at the bright end . given a band - pass @xmath124mhz and a central frequency @xmath230mhz , the number of active quasars per logarithm of luminosity per field of view is @xmath231 where @xmath232 is the co - moving volume per unit redshift per unit solid angle . equation  ( [ n ] ) yields a value of @xmath233 bright @xmath225 quasars per _ lofar _ field .",
    "the number of redshifted 21 cm rings or holes in the emission signature of the igm per field as determined by equation  ( [ n ] ) applies to active quasars .",
    "however as noted above , the 21 cm emission may persist after the quasar has turned off .",
    "this is because in the absence of other heating sources , gas heated to temperatures far in excess of the cmb will cool adiabatically .",
    "the @xmath234 dependence of the temperature in this regime should ensure that the gas remains at a temperature in excess of the cmb by the time it is re - heated during the next episode of quasar activity .",
    "we might expect to find significant numbers of fossil regions , provided that there is continued coupling of @xmath95 and @xmath91 due to a uv background .",
    "the number of detectable fossil regions would then equal the number in equation  ( [ n ] ) multiplied by the inverse of the quasar duty cycle @xmath235 ( wyithe & loeb  2003b ) , or about 200 per field .",
    "_ lofar _ should also be sensitive to regions around less luminous quasars .",
    "the brightness temperature of the emission ring , or of the igm outside the region has a mild dependence on the quasar luminosity , and its diameter scales only with the one third power of the luminosity .",
    "regions around less luminous quasars should be more numerous by a factor proportional to @xmath236 . for example , detection of redshifted 21 cm emission around quasars with luminosities a factor of 10 smaller than those of the bright sdss quasars require a resolution that is better by a factor of @xmath237 , corresponding to an integration time that is longer by a factor of @xmath238 .",
    "however , the number of active high redshift quasars per field powering such emission rings is likely to be of order @xmath239 , while the number of fossils regions could be @xmath240 .",
    "finally , we briefly discuss the example of a redshifted 21 cm signature around a high redshift quasar presented in 5b of tozzi et al .",
    "their example shows a ring of redshifted 21 cm emission inside a ring of redshifted 21 cm absorption .",
    "this morphology is unlikely to be observed because the observation of an absorption ring requires the absence of a uv background , and the provision of coupling of the spin and kinetic temperatures through ly@xmath0 photons from the quasar itself .",
    "as we have shown , ly@xmath0 photons from the quasar are unable to couple the spin and kinetic temperatures .",
    "an emission ring enclosed within an igm that absorbs everywhere , as shown in figure  [ fig5 ] is the correct signature of a strmgren sphere expanding into a cold igm ( provided that there is a uv background ) .",
    "a very exciting possibility for instruments like _ lofar _ is to search for the emission ( or absorption ) of redshifted 21 cm radiation from the neutral igm ( averaged over large scales ) before reionization . by finding the frequency at which this emission ( absorption ) cuts off",
    ", one might determine the redshift of reionization ( e.g. shaver et al .",
    "if reionization took place over an extended period of time as suggested by recent work ( barkana & loeb 2003b ) , then this global reionization signature will be difficult to detect for two primary reasons : ( i ) because it will be superimposed on a smooth but varying foreground spectrum , and ( ii ) calibration needs to be performed over a frequency range that is broader than the detector band - pass .",
    "arc - minute resolution observations of quasar strmgren spheres would provide an alternative method to search for a step in the brightness temperature of the igm due to reionization .",
    "this is because the inner part of the region provides a calibration of the brightness temperature of the radio foreground that is unavailable along other lines of sight .",
    "note that 21 cm emission from the quasar itself does not affect this calibration , since it effectively just adds to the foreground .",
    "observations along the line - of - sight to the quasar would include emission within the spectral ranges corresponding to both the ionized region and the neutral gas within the same band - pass . redshifted 21 cm observations of quasars at a series of redshifts",
    "would therefore allow determination of the brightness temperature of the igm at different cosmic times , and a detection of the onset of reionization .",
    "redshifted 21 cm observation of highest - redshift sdss quasars will immediately determine whether the igm was significantly neutral at @xmath241 .",
    "observations of the reionization epoch in redshifted 21 cm radiation with proposed instruments like _ lofar _ will offer a unique opportunity to study the state of the igm at the end of the dark ages .",
    "the warm neutral hydrogen outside the regions surrounding bright high redshift quasars is expected to emit at 21 cm .",
    "the brightness temperature contrast of this emission will probe the neutral fraction ( with a lower contrast implying a lower neutral fraction ) , although the inference will be subject to uncertainties in the temperature of the warm igm .",
    "alternatively , the relativistic expansion of the regions provides a geometric method to determine the neutral fraction as well as the quasar lifetime .",
    "we have combined the observed ly@xmath0 absorption signal with expectations for redshifted 21 cm signatures of the regions around the highest redshift sdss quasars . because the regions around the known @xmath29 quasars are at a stage of relativistic expansion , the line - of - sight and transverse radii ( measured through ly@xmath0 absorption and redshifted 21 cm emission , respectively ) , correspond to two different epochs in the evolution of the regions .",
    "we have found that measurements of these two radii can be used to determine the neutral fraction of the igm with only a mild dependence on the anisotropy of the quasar emission ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . assuming isotropic quasar emission and the absence of a fossil region prior to the quasar activity , the observation of a redshifted 21 cm emission ring with a radius greater than 2.5mpc ( 0.5mpc ) around the known @xmath29 quasars , would provide a lower limit on the neutral fraction of @xmath242 ( @xmath170 ) .",
    "emission concentrated close to the line - of - sight and the existence of fossil regions around the quasar host galaxy would imply even larger neutral fractions .    at low redshifts ,",
    "quasar lifetimes are bracketed by a variety of techniques to the range @xmath243@xmath244yr ( e.g. yu & tremaine  2002 ; martini & weinberg  2001 ; haiman & hui  2001 ; jakobsen , jansen , wagner & reimers  2003 ) , with preferred values near @xmath245 years ( e.g. martini  2003 ) .",
    "the lifetime required for the region to expand to its observed size is proportional to @xmath160 .",
    "the geometric determination of the neutral fraction can therefore be directly used to determine also the quasar lifetime measured from the combination of @xmath11 and @xmath117 .",
    "thus , ly@xmath0 and redshifted 21 cm measurements of the expanding regions around the highest redshift quasars will allow a direct determination of quasar ages on a case by case basis and constrain quasar formation models ( e.g. haiman & loeb  2001 ) .    based on current number counts of bright high redshift quasars and the preliminary design of _ lofar _ , we forecast that each _ lofar _ field ( of radius @xmath246 ) will contain @xmath247 active quasars as bright as the observed sdss quasars within one band - pass of frequency ( @xmath248mhz ) .",
    "an integration time of @xmath183 hours should be sufficient to detect the rings of redshifted 21 cm emission from the warm igm outside the quasar regions if @xmath249 .",
    "in the presence of a strong cosmic ly@xmath0 background , these rings should remain visible after the quasar has turned off .",
    "this would result in the detection of a large number of fossil regions that exceeds the number of active quasars by the inverse of the quasar duty cycle ( @xmath250 ) .",
    "arc - minute observations of quasar strmgren spheres will provide an alternative method for measuring the spectral step that makes the so - called global signature of reionization ( shaver et al .",
    "the brightness temperature measured in the spectral range corresponding to the ionized gas within the region provides a calibration of the foreground emission at the same redshift .",
    "this calibration will help overcome the difficulties associated with measuring the global signature of an extended reionization epoch ( as suggested by the large electron scattering optical depth measured by _ wmap _ ; kogut et al .",
    "2003 ) on top of a frequency dependent foreground .",
    "detection of the signal for a statistical sample of quasars would help calibrate the expected scatter in the reionization redshift of different regions in the universe ( barkana & loeb 2003b ) .    finally , we emphasize that the redshifted 21 cm observation of existing sdss quasars will determine whether the igm was significantly neutral at @xmath241 as suggested by their observed ly@xmath0 spectra ( wyithe & loeb  2004 ) . when combined with the high value of the optical depth for electron scattering measured by",
    "_ wmap _ ( kogut et al .  2003 ) , a significant neutral fraction at @xmath251 would imply a complex reionization history and possibly an early reionization phase driven by population - iii stars ."
