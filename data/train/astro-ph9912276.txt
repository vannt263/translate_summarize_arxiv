    "the nature of the progenitors of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) remains an unsettled issue after more than three decades of research ( e.g. mszros , rees , & wijers 1999 ; paczyski 1999 ; piran 1999 ) .",
    "the discovery of x - ray ( costa 1997 ) and optical ( van paradijs 1997 ) afterglows has provided the breakthrough needed to establish the cosmological nature of these events . while the implied huge energy release per steradian must produce a relativistically expanding fireball ( e.g. mszros & rees 1992 ) , it is not yet clear if this expansion is quasi - spherical or highly collimated , or if the degree of beaming differs between the prompt grb and the delayed emission .",
    "the observed distribution of optical afterglows with respect to their host galaxies may suggest that some grbs are associated with star forming regions , and therefore with the explosions of massive stars rather than with merging neutron stars ( e.g. paczyski 1998 ; fruchter 1999 ) .",
    "recent observations of a spatial and temporal coincidence between the supernova ( sn ) 1998bw and grb980425 ( galama 1998 ) have added support to the idea that at least some grbs may be related to some type of supernova explosion .",
    "the observation of a red component , a factor of 60 higher in flux than the extrapolated afterglow in grb980326 , has also been explained with a supernova , and , if true , it would strengthen the connection of grbs with massive stars ( bloom 1999 ; see also reichart 1999 for similar evidence in grb970228 ; but see esin & blandford 2000 for an alternative explanation involving dust scattering ) .",
    "if grbs are associated with sn - like events , energetic considerations suggest that some fireballs be collimated into a solid angle @xmath8 , i.e. grbs involve strongly asymmetric outflows . without beaming the inferred ( ` isotropic equivalent ' ) energy of grb990123 , @xmath9 ergs ( kulkarni 1999 ) , rules out stellar models .",
    "additional circumstantial evidence for jet - like bursts comes from the decline ( ` beaming break ' ) observed in some afterglow light curves ( kulkarni 1999 ; harrison 1999 ) and attributed to the sideway expansion of non - spherical ejecta , although some difficulties remain ( moderski , sikora , & bulik 2000 ) .",
    "it is an unavoidable consequence of a massive star progenitor model for grbs that the hard emission will propagate in a dense circumstellar environment , such as a pre - burst stellar wind ( chevalier & li 1999 ) . shells of significantly enhanced gas density may also exist in the immediate neighborhood of a grb",
    ". this would be the case , for example , in scenarios where a supernova occurs shortly before the burst ( like in the delayed collapse of a rotationally - stabilized neutron star , vietri & stella 1998 ) so that the metal - enriched supernova remnant shell does not have time to disperse .",
    "the deceleration of a pre - supernova wind by the pressure of the surrounding medium could also create circumstellar shells , as would the interaction of fast and slow winds from massive stars ( as observed in the case of sn 1987a ) .",
    "the ambient material will then efficiently scatter the prompt grb radiation and , because of light travel time effects , produce a luminous ( albeit unresolvable ) reflection echo .",
    "the detection of scattered light may provide unique information on the environment of grbs and on their emission properties .",
    "conversely , one may use the lack of evidence for a compton echo to set constraints on the density of circumstellar material and the burst energetics . in this paper",
    "we compute the expected properties of such compton flashes in a variety of scenarios , and show that the delayed hard x - ray emission associated with the echo reflected by a red supergiant wind is significant and could be detectable by _ swift _ out to a redshift of @xmath0 .",
    "for simplicity , we will approximate the prompt grb as a collimated photon pulse that maintains a constant luminosity for a time @xmath10 .",
    "it is commonly proposed that the burst is produced when the kinetic energy of a relativistically expanding fireball is dissipated at a radius @xmath11 cm due to , e.g. , internal shocks , and radiated away as @xmath1-rays through synchrotron emission .",
    "the scattered light is observed at a time @xmath12 ( @xmath13 is measured since the burst is first detected ) , when the radiation beam can be visualized as a shell of radius @xmath14 and thickness @xmath15 .",
    "the ( equal - arrival time ) scattering material lies on the paraboloid having the burst at its focus and its axis along the line of sight , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the angle between the line of sight and the direction of the reflecting gas as seen by the burst ( e.g. blandford & rees 1972 ) .",
    "the sudden brilliance of a grb will be reflected by the circumstellar gas to create a ` compton echo ' . if @xmath18 is the total energy , @xmath19 , emitted by the burst ( @xmath20 is the energy emitted per unit energy @xmath21 and unit solid angle @xmath22 along the @xmath17 direction , @xmath23 in the case of isotropic emission ) , then the equivalent isotropic luminosity ( as inferred by a distant observer ) of the echo reflected at a distance @xmath7 from the site of the burst is @xmath24 where the integral is over the beaming solid angle @xmath4 of the prompt pulse , @xmath7 is given by equation ( 1 ) , @xmath25 is the differential klein - nishina cross section for unpolarized incident radiation ( e.g. rybicki & lightman 1979 ) , @xmath26 is the thomson cross section , @xmath27^{-1}\\ ] ] is the energy of the scattered photon , and @xmath28 the local electron density .",

    "the echo temporal behaviour in some of the scenarios discussed above is shown in figure 1 .",
    "in the following we will assume a broken power - law for the ` typical ' grb spectrum , @xmath53 this is consistent with a recent analysis of @xmath54 spectra obtained by the burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) on the _ compton gamma ray observatory _",
    "( preece 2000 ) .",
    "no attempt has been made to correct the observed break energy for the mean redshift of the grb population .",
    "equation ( [ eq : lum ] ) only applies to a scattering medium which is either at rest or moving with sub - relativistic speed .",
    "as shown by madau & thompson ( 2000 ) and thompson & madau ( 2000 ) , a strong burst of radiation will have important dynamical effects on the surrounding ism .",
    "optically thin material overtaken by an expanding photon shell at radius @xmath7 will develop a large bulk lorentz factor @xmath55 when the energy deposited by compton scattering exceeds the rest - mass energy of the scatterers , i.e. when @xmath56 where @xmath4 is the burst beaming angle , @xmath57 is the molecular weight per electron , @xmath58 the proton mass , and @xmath59 is the spectrum - weighted total cross section , @xmath60 from equations ( [ eq : kn ] ) and ( [ eq : spe ] ) . in the case of a pulse of ` isotropic - equivalent ' energy @xmath61ergs , propagating into a medium with @xmath62 , one can then define a characteristic distance @xmath63 such that for @xmath64 dynamical effects become important and may suppress the scattering rate ( by a factor @xmath65 ) .",
    "more quantitatively , consider a plane - parallel photon pulse of thickness @xmath15 propagating into the circumstellar gas .",
    "a parcel of matter moving radially with speed @xmath66 will be accelerated at the rate @xmath67 where now @xmath68 includes a correction to @xmath59 as particles moving at relativistic speed scatter an increasing fraction of ( redshifted ) photons with the full thomson cross section ( i.e. @xmath69 ) .",
    "matter initially at radius @xmath7 and accelerated from rest will surf the photon shell over a distance @xmath70 such that @xmath71 the radiative force vanishes when the photon shell moves past the particle at @xmath72 .",
    "when @xmath73 , the inverse square dilution of flux can be neglected , and equation ( [ eq : dr ] ) can be rewritten using ( [ eq : dgam ] ) as @xmath74 this can be integrated exactly to yield a maximum lorentz factor @xmath75   \\label{eq : gam}\\ ] ] which decreases with distance from the source . in the relativistic limit @xmath76 ( madau & thompson 2000 ) .",

    "as expected , the acceleration at large radii takes place on a distance @xmath80 , and the outflow becomes sub - relativistic at about @xmath81 .",
    "two effects must be noted here : ( 1 ) the accelerated medium will be compressed into a shell of thickness @xmath82 .",
    "shocks may form when inner shells ( which move faster and are more compressed ) run into outer shells , and material will accumulate at @xmath81 . in a @xmath83 density profile ,",

    "it has been shown by thompson & madau ( 2000 ) that @xmath87 pair creation occurs in grbs when side - scattered photons collide with the main @xmath1-ray beam , an effect which amplifies the density of scattering charges in the ambient medium .",
    "the pair density will exponentiate when the photon shell is optically thick to photon collisions , i.e. when @xmath88 . as @xmath89",
    ", runaway pair production may occur well beyond the radius @xmath81 defined in ( [ eq : rc ] ) . when pairs are produced in sufficient numbers , i.e. when @xmath90 , the mean mass per scattering charge drops to @xmath91 .",
    "because of the reduced inertia per particle , and also because pair - producing collisions impart direct momentum to the gas , such a pair - loaded plasma may , under some circumstances , be more efficiently accelerated to relativistic bulk velocities than a baryonic gas .",
    "this could increase the value of @xmath81 in equation ( [ eq : rc ] ) by as much as a factor @xmath92 . on the other hand",
    ", runaway pair creation will also boost the scattering optical depth of circumstellar material , thus producing brighter echoes at later times . for simplicity ,",
    "in the rest of this paper we will limit our discussion to a _",
    "scattering medium at @xmath93 , where dynamical effects can be neglected .",
    "we defer a proper treatment of reflected echoes in a @xmath87 pair - dominated wind to another work .      in the case of a massive progenitor scenario , such as a ` collapsar ' ( macfadyen & woosley 1999 ) or ` hypernova ' ( paczyski 1998 )",
    ", it is known that red supergiants and wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars have strong winds .",
    "if the progenitor is a type 1b or type 1c sn then it must have lost its hydrogen and perhaps its helium envelope at some earlier time .",
    "the winds from typical red supergiants are slow - moving and dense , with with velocities @xmath94 and mass loss rates between @xmath95 and @xmath96 .    as a ` representative '",

    "have been inferred in the circumstellar medium of this supernova by fransson , lundquist , & chevalier ( 1996 ) , and are possibly caused by a variation of the mass - loss rate from the progenitor or by a non - spherical geometry .",
    "following fransson one can write @xmath99 up to @xmath100 cm , while at larger radii the observations appear to be consistent with a @xmath83 law .",
    "figure 3 shows the reflected echo at @xmath101 , and 72 hours of a two - sided grb jet inclined at an angle @xmath17 to the line of sight , propagating through a sn 1993j - like dense environment .",
    "the prompt pulse was assumed to radiate a total of @xmath102 ergs with the spectrum given in equation ( [ eq : spe ] ) , each jet having equal strength and being invisible to the observer .",
    "it is instructive to look at the relative contribution of the approaching and receding beams . on the equal - arrival time paraboloid , the receding beam is reflected by gas that is closer to the source and denser : its contribution dominates the echo at all energies where scattering occurs in the thomson regime . above 150 kev ,",
    "however , recoil can no longer be neglected , and it is the approaching beam ( whose photons are seen after small - angle scattering ) which dominates the reflected flash at high energies .",
    "the total spectral energy distribution therefore mirrors the prompt burst at low energies , but is much steeper beyond a few hundred kev . in the limit @xmath103",
    "both beams are detected in reflected light after wide - angle scattering , and the echo is suppressed above 511 kev by compton downscattering as @xmath104 for @xmath105 .",
    "the scattered luminosity in figure 3 drops initially as @xmath106 for @xmath107 cm , to steepen to @xmath108 first at @xmath1-ray energies ( when the approaching beam encounters the @xmath83 density profile ) , and only later  depending on the jet angle  at x - ray energies ( dominated by the receding beam ) .",
    "the winds from wrs are characterized by mass loss rates @xmath109 and velocities @xmath110 ( e.g. willis 1991 ) . in a steady , spherically symmetric wind ,",
    "the electron density is @xmath111 where @xmath112 in a helium gas .",
    "figure 4 shows the fainter ( compared to the red supergiant wind case ) compton echo of a grb jet ( with same parameters as above ) propagating through a wr wind .",
    "in the case of a @xmath83 medium with the fiducial scalings given in equations ( [ eq : rc ] ) and ( [ eq : ne ] ) , the electron scattering optical depth from @xmath81 to infinity is @xmath113 .",
    "this is roughly the fraction of grb energy which is reflected in the echo on all timescales @xmath114 hours , with a scattered luminosity that drops as @xmath108 .",
    "fast - moving winds will be less dense and therefore less efficient ( @xmath115 ) at reprocessing the prompt pulse ; slow - moving winds will produce brighter echoes ( @xmath116 ) .",
    "as the electron scattering optical depth is @xmath117 , fainter and less collimated bursts will be characterized by a larger ` albedo ' relative to bright ones . for an isotropic burst of energy (",
    "say ) @xmath118 ergs , the characteristic distance in equation ( [ eq : rc ] ) decreases to @xmath119 cm . in a red supergiant wind with @xmath120 @xmath121 ,",
    "one has @xmath122 , and a fraction @xmath123 of the grb energy will be reflected in a echo on timescales @xmath124 min .",
    "bright scattering echoes are a natural consequence of a hard photon pulse propagating in a dense circumstellar environment such as a pre - burst stellar wind . in massive star progenitor models for grbs",
    "there is likely to be an echo component in the observed x- and @xmath1-ray light curves , the only question is how significant this component is . in the range 10 to 100 kev , where they mirror the spectral energy distribution of the prompt pulse , echoes will typically be harder than the afterglows observed by _",
    "bepposax_. above 200 kev , the reflected flash will have a much steeper spectrum than the parent grb as scattering occurs in the relativistic regime . while in the standard fireball / blastwave scenario both the prompt and delayed emission may be highly beamed , compton echoes are  modulo the scattering phase function  quasi - isotropic .",
    "back - scattered radiation could then provide a means for detecting a population of nearby misaligned grbs , since collimated outflows imply the existence of a large amount of undetected dim bursts and a much higher event rate than is often assumed . in a @xmath1-ray quiet burst ,",
    "the observed luminosity of a compton echo at fixed burst energy per steradian is proportional to the beaming solid angle , @xmath125 , as it scales with the intrinsic power of the parent grb . in the euclidean ( bright ) part of the number - flux relation",
    "the total number of echoes above a fixed limiting flux then scales as @xmath126 , i.e. it is smaller in the case of more collimated jets . in the flat ( faint ) part of the counts instead the number of echoes in the sky is approximately independent of the beaming solid angle .",
    "compton echoes could be studied with the _ swift _ gamma ray burst explorer to be launched in @xmath127 .",

    "note that the light emitted during the early afterglow will also be scattered by circumstellar material and give rise to a light echo : as the luminosity decays with time , however , ` later ' paraboloids will be sequentially dimmer , that is for any given radial distance from the burst the reflected power will actually decrease .",
    "a delayed outburst was observed in the x - ray afterglow of grb970508 .",

    "<S> we calculate luminosities , spectra , and light curves of such compton echoes in a variety of emission geometries and ambient gas distributions , and show that the delayed hard x - ray flash from a pulse propagating into a red supergiant wind could be detectable by _ swift _ out to @xmath0 . independently of the @xmath1-ray spectrum of the prompt burst , reflection echoes will typically show a high - energy cutoff between @xmath2 and @xmath3 because of compton downscattering . at fixed burst energy per steradian , </S>",
    "<S> the luminosity of the reflected echo is proportional to the beaming solid angle , @xmath4 , of the prompt pulse , while the number of bright echoes detectable in the sky above a fixed limiting flux increases as @xmath5 , i.e. it is smaller in the case of more collimated jets . </S>",
    "<S> the lack of an x - ray echo at @xmath6 one month delay from the explosion poses severe constraints on the possible existence of a lateral grb jet in sn 1987a . </S>",
    "<S> the late @xmath7-band afterglow observed in grb990123 is fainter than the optical echo expected in a dense red supergiant environment from a isotropic prompt optical flash . </S>",
