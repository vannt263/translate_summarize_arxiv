    "the complex processes of atomic diffusion ",
    "radiative levitation and gravitational settling ",
    "occur in upper main sequence stars , and are particularly evident in chemically peculiar a , b and f - type stars , collectively known as ap stars .",
    "accordingly , these stars are good targets to place observational constraints on atomic diffusion , which is crucial for deepening our understanding of these processes within the framework of studies of the structure and evolution of stars , and for more global analysis of galactic chemical evolution .",
    "the ap stars rotate considerably more slowly than spectroscopically normal main sequence stars with similar effective temperatures .",
    "a fraction of ap stars have extremely long rotation periods from tens of days to tens of years , and even of the order of a century in the case of @xmath5equ .",
    "there is no clear picture of the braking mechanism leading to such slow rotation , but the observational evidence strongly suggests that it is related to magnetic field ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "many ap stars possess strong , predominantly dipolar magnetic fields .",
    "the first magnetic star , 78vir , was found by @xcite .",
    "eleven years later @xcite published the first catalogue of magnetic stars , and two years following that he discovered a huge 34 kg magnetic field in the star hd215441 @xcite , known since then as `` babcock s star '' . despite success in the years that followed in increasing the number known magnetic stars  especially in last several years ( for example @xcite ; @xcite ) ",
    "hd215441 remains the record - holder for the main sequence star with the strongest magnetic field .",
    "the second strongest magnetic star , hd154708 , was discovered by @xcite . around the same time",
    "@xcite found hd137509 to have magnetic field modulus of 29 kg .",
    "his result was in agreement with @xcite who discovered a very strong quadratic magnetic field up to 37 kg in this star and mentioned that it has the one of the strongest magnetic fields .",
    "surprisingly , the longitudinal magnetic field in hd137509 is not very large and varies just from @xmath6 to @xmath7 kg @xcite .",
    "hd154708 still has the strongest magnetic field known among the cooler rapidly oscillating ( roap ) stars @xcite .",
    "the origin of the magnetic fields in ap stars and details of their peculiar properties are still mysteries , despite large efforts in the study of these stars .",
    "as usual in physics , analysis of extreme cases may provide key information , hence there is great interest in the stars with the strongest magnetic fields to help solve many problems in ap stars .",
    "recently , @xcite discovered an extremely strong magnetic field in the ap star hd75049 .",
    "many lines in the high resolution spectra are split into clear zeeman patterns . from the value of splitting @xcite",
    "estimated the photospheric magnetic field modulus to be about 30 kg .",
    "these observations also revealed a reasonably short rotation period , and large variability both of the magnetic field and the spectral line intensities .",
    "because of these interesting characteristics of this rare object , we have obtained a series of high resolution spectra and carried out circular spectropolarimetric observations with the vlt .",
    "we present in this paper the results of our analysis .",
    "to characterise the magnetic field of an ap star , it is necessary to have magnetic measurements that cover the rotational phases of the star well . while we had a preliminary estimate for the rotation period of 4.05d determined by @xcite from all sky automatic survey ( asas ) photometric survey data @xcite ,",
    "we were uncertain about this , so decided to spread new observations over half a year to be sure to determine the correct rotational period .",
    "there is also a possible 5.28-yr period in the asas data that was noted by @xcite .",
    "the nature of this long period is not clear , but it is certainly not a rotational period ; the @xmath8kms@xmath9 of hd75049 does not allow that .",
    "further understanding of this period will require long - term observations .",
    "a series high resolution spectra were obtained in service mode using uves ( ultraviolet and visual echelle spectrograph ) on the eso vlt ( very large telescope ) .",
    "twelve spectra were collected between 2007 october 10 and 2008 april 1 .",
    "two previous observations of this star with feros and uves obtained in 2007 february and march were also used for this analysis .",
    "these observations were made with echelle spectrographs over long spectral regions .",
    "for feros the spectral range is @xmath10  with a resolution @xmath11 ; for uves the range is @xmath12  with a resolution of @xmath13 .",
    "a journal of these observations is presented in table1 .",
    "software packages provided by eso ( uves and feros pipelines in the midas environment ) were used for the reduction and extraction of 1d spectra .",
    ".a journal of high resolution spectroscopic observations with uves at the vlt and feros at the eso 2.2-m telescope .",
    "the columns give the barycentric julian date ( bjd ) of the middle of each exposure , the exposure time , the signal - to - noise ratio that was measured in sections of the continuum free of spectral lines . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ abund ]    large overabundances of some chemical elements , especially of rare earth elements , is one of the defining characteristics of ap stars .",
    "various chemical elements concentrate in different places on the surface of the star .",
    "there is a tendency for rare earth elements to concentrate around the magnetic poles in some sort of spots .",
    "the size and number of spots may vary ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the situation is even more complex since the atmospheres of ap stars also show vertical stratification ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) where various elements accumulate in different layers in the atmosphere .",
    "because of the spotted structure of ap stars , average abundances do not reflect the complexity of the physical conditions at the stellar surface , yet they are useful for statistical analysis and comparison of stars in the class ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "hd75049 has a rich spectrum , but is not extraordinarily peculiar . in the spectrum",
    "many lines of rare earth elements are visible , but the majority of the strongest metal lines belong to siii , tiii , feii and crii",
    ". lines of srii in the blue region of the feros spectrum are also rather strong .",
    "we obtained the abundances of several elements using spectral synthesis where the observed spectra were compared with synthetic spectra until a best fit was obtained .",
    "an example for feii @xmath145018   is shown in fig.5 .",
    "the synthetic spectra were calculated with the software synthmag @xcite .",
    "the spectral line list was taken from the vienna atomic line database ( vald , @xcite ) , which includes lines of rare earth elements from the dream database @xcite .",
    "a model atmosphere with @xmath15k and @xmath16 with metallicity of 0.5dex above solar from the nemo database @xcite was used .",
    "the synthetic spectra provided a good match to many spectral lines with the field strength chosen , but some lines need further broadening to match the wings .",
    "macroturbulence is possibly not the explanation for this , as magnetic fields suppress macroscopic motion in the stellar atmospheres . with the non - uniform distribution of abundances  both horizontally and vertically  in ap star atmospheres",
    ", it may be that stronger magnetic field strengths in different line - forming regions could explain this extra broadening .",
    "further study is needed to test this idea .",
    "two spectra at rotation phases near minimum and maximum longitudinal field strength ( phase 0.063 and 0.388 ; see fig.[fig : bzbm ] ) were used for abundances determination .",
    "magnetic field strengths of 26 kg and 30 kg , respectively , were used for calculation of the synthetic spectra at these two rotational phases .",
    "synthetic line profiles for various abundances were compared with observed profiles for best fits .",
    "many calculated line profiles do not fit the observed profiles perfectly as a result of blending and asymmetry , but the average value for a number of lines gives reliable results .",
    "it was more difficult to fit the spectrum observed at rotational phase 0.063 when the field strength is lower and some lines are not as sharp and more asymmetric .",
    "table4 presents the values of the abundances with errors determined for various ions .",
    "the errors given are the internal standard deviations for the list of examined lines for each ion .",
    "there were no lines of ndii found in the spectra , so only an upper limit is given in table4 .",
    "the last column in the table gives solar abundances for the same elements taken from @xcite .",
    "hd75049 shows overabundances of silicon , chromium and europium and thus can be considered to belong to the sicr group of ap stars , according to the classification of peculiar stars .",
    "the strong magnetic field of hd75049 is an exciting discovery .",
    "this star is a rival for the long - known strongest ap magnetic field in babcock s star , hd215441 .",
    "both stars have deep silicon lines , but are at opposite ends of the temperatures range of the apsi stellar group .",
    "@xcite noted that hd215441 does not have outstanding peculiarities in the spectrum .",
    "we have found the same in hd75049 , which has a rich peculiar spectrum , but with overabundances of number chemical elements similar to other ap stars with much smaller field strengths .",
    "hd215441 has a magnetic field modulus that changes from 32 to 35 kg over the rotational period ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite suggested that the magnetic field of this star deviates from a centred dipole .",
    "magnetic configurations with a combination of dipole and quadrupole components @xcite or dipole , quadrupole and octupole @xcite components were required to model both observations of @xmath17 obtained by @xcite and @xmath18 by @xcite .",
    "in contrast , for hd75049 the centred dipole model is a suitable first approximation to fit both the longitudinal field and field modulus measurements .",
    "some discrepancy with the second magnetic moment dipole model may be a result of nonuniform distribution of chemical elements at surface .",
    "more complex magnetic geometry may also be present in this star .",
    "an important result is that the star is probably young .",
    "its estimated stellar radius places it close to the zeor - age main sequence .",
    "@xcite examined the inclination of rotation axis @xmath19 to line - of - sight and obliquity @xmath20 of the magnetic axis to the rotation axis for a sample of magnetic ap stars .",
    "they found that the majority of the slow rotators with periods longer than 25d have @xmath20 smaller than @xmath21 , while stars with short rotation periods tend to show a large obliquity of the magnetic axis .",
    "our estimation of @xmath22 for hd75049 is consistent with this conclusion .",
    "we thank dr . romanyuk for providing information about the zeeman configuration of some spectral lines and for useful discussion .",
    "dwk and vge acknowledge support for this work from the science and technology facilities council ( stfc ) of the uk .",
    "this research has made use of nasa s astrophysics data system and simbad database , operated at cds , strasbourg , france ."
