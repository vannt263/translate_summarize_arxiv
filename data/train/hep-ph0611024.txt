    "in the brane - world scenario @xcite our universe is understood as a three - brane embedded in a higher dimensional space .",
    "if the extra space is compact , the large radius @xmath0 of the @xmath1 extra dimensions implies that the fundamental gravity scale in @xmath2 dimensions @xmath3 can be much lower than the planck scale @xmath4 .",
    "indeed @xmath5 .",
    "thus typically it is possible to have weak - scale gravity @xmath6 tev for @xmath7 and @xmath8 mm or @xmath9 and @xmath10 fermi .",
    "however , apart from @xmath3 , there is another fundamental scale in these models which is given by the finite tension of the brane @xmath11 .",
    "the relative size of these two scales determines two completely different regimes . in the rigid - brane limit ( @xmath12 ) , the new relevant degrees of freedom are the kaluza - klein ( kk ) modes of fields propagating in the extra dimensions . in the flexible - brane limit ( @xmath13 ) , the kk modes decouple from the standard model ( sm ) fields @xcite and",
    "the only new relevant degrees of freedom are those corresponding to the brane fluctuations ( branons ) . in this work",
    "we will review the main phenomenological consequences of brane - world models in this latter case .",
    "let us consider our four - dimensional space - time @xmath14 to be embedded in a @xmath15-dimensional bulk space whose coordinates will be denoted by @xmath16 , where @xmath17 , with @xmath18 , correspond to the ordinary four dimensional space - time and @xmath19 , with @xmath20 , are coordinates of the compact extra space .    from the point of view of particle physics , the first new effects of brane - worlds are related to the kk mode expansion of the bulk gravitational field : @xmath21 where a toroidal compactification has been assumed for simplicity and @xmath22 is a @xmath1 dimensional vector with components @xmath23 . therefore a bulk graviton can be understood as a kk tower of four dimensional massive gravitons with masses of the order of @xmath24 with @xmath25 being any natural number ( for the @xmath26 case ) so that the distance in the mass spectrum between two consecutive kk gravitons is of the order of @xmath27 .",
    "this means in particular that the kk graviton spectrum can be considered as approximately continuous for large extra dimensions . in principle",
    "we expect two kinds of effects from the kk graviton tower , namely graviton production and virtual effects on other particle production or observables ( see for instance @xcite and references therein ) . the rates for the different processes can be computed by linearizing the bulk gravitational field and by coupling the graviton field to the sm energy - momentum tensor @xmath28 . then expanding the gravitational field in terms of the kk modes one finds the corresponding feynman rules .",
    "however , apart from the existence of kk modes , the fact that the brane is a physical object with finite tension requires the existence of new fields which parametrize the brane fluctuations @xcite . for simplicity we will assume that the bulk metric tensor takes the following form : @xmath29 where the warp factor is normalized as @xmath30 .",
    "working in the probe - brane approximation , our 3-brane universe is moving in the background metric given by ( [ metric ] ) which is not perturbed by its presence .",
    "the position of the brane in the bulk can be parametrized as @xmath31 , and we assume for simplicity that the ground state of the brane corresponds to @xmath32 .    in the simplest case in which the metric is not warped along the extra dimensions , i.e. @xmath33 , the transverse brane fluctuations are massless and they can be parametrized by the goldstone bosons fields @xmath34 ( branons ) . in that case",
    "we can choose the @xmath35 coordinates so that the branon fields are proportional to the extra - space coordinates : @xmath36 , where the proportionality constant is related to the brane tension @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "in the general case , the curvature generated by the warp factor explicitly breaks the traslational invariance in the extra space .",
    "therefore branons acquire a mass matrix which is given precisely by the bulk riemann tensor evaluated at the brane position : @xmath37    the fact that the brane can fluctuate implies that the actual metric on the brane is no longer given by @xmath38 , but by the induced metric which includes the effect of warping through the mass matrix : @xmath39 the dynamics of branons can be obtained from the nambu - goto action by introducing the above expansion .",
    "in addition , it is also possible to get their couplings to the ordinary particles just by replacing the space - time by the induced metric in the standard model action . thus we get , up to quadratic terms in the branon fields : @xmath40 \\label{lag}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we can see that branons interact with the sm particles through their energy - momentum tensor .",
    "the couplings are controlled by the brane tension scale @xmath41 and they are universal very much like those of gravitons . for large @xmath41",
    ", branons are therefore weakly interacting particles .",
    "= 7.5 cm    parity transformation on the brane for : a ) odd - dimensional brane .",
    "branon fields change sign ( pseudoscalars ) .",
    "b ) even dimensional brane ( scalar branons )    the sign of the branon fields is determined by the orientation of the brane submanifold in the bulk space . under a parity transformation on the brane ( @xmath42 ) ,",
    "the orientation of the brane changes sign provided the ordinary space has an odd number of dimensions , whereas it remains unchanged for even spatial dimensions ( see fig.1 ) . in the case",
    "in which we are interested with three ordinary spatial dimensions , branons are therefore pseudoscalar particles . if the gravitational sector of the theory respects parity on the brane , then branons always couple to sm particles by pairs , which ensures that they are stable particles .",
    "this fact can have important consequences in cosmology as we show below .",
    "the main processes in colliders in which branons could contribute in a relevant way are the single photon and single - z production in @xmath43 colliders ( lep ) and the monojet and single - photon production in hadron colliders such as tevatron @xcite , @xcite . in those processes , a pair of branons are produced in the final state which are not detected and therefore they appear as missing energy and momentum .",
    "we have computed the limits on @xmath44 imposed by the absence of any deviation from the sm predictions in such processes .",
    "the results are summarized in fig .",
    "= 4.5 cm    collider limits on branon parameters from single - photon and single - z processes at lep ( l3 ) @xcite ( left ) . limits from monojet and single - photon processes at tevatron - i @xcite ( right )    we have also estimated the prospects for future hadron colliders ( tevatron - ii and lhc ) and @xmath43 colliders ( ilc ) . in fig .",
    "3 we show the accessible regions in the @xmath44 plane .    = 12.5 cm    collider limits on branon parameters from monojet and single - photon processes for tevatron - ii and lhc and single - photon and single - z processes for the international linear collider ( ilc ) with typical values for the center of mass energy of 1 tev and total integrated luminosity of 1000 fb@xmath45 .",
    "as commented before branons are stable and weakly interacting particles , this makes them natural dark matter candidates @xcite .     thermal relic abundance in the @xmath46 plane for a model with one branon of mass @xmath47 .",
    "the two lines on the left correspond to the wmap first year measurements : @xmath48 and @xmath49 curves for hot - warm relics , whereas the right line corresponds to the latter limits for cold relics ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the lower area is excluded by single - photon processes at lep - ii @xcite together with monojet signal at tevatron - i @xcite .",
    "the astrophysical constraints are less restrictive and they mainly come from supernova cooling by branon emission @xcite .    in @xcite the thermal relic branon abundance has been calculated in two cases : either relativistic branons at freeze - out ( hot - warm ) or non - relativistic ( cold ) , and assuming that the evolution of the universe is standard for @xmath50 ( see fig . 4 for comparison with the wmap first year limits ) .",
    "however , branons can also act as non - thermal dark matter very much in the same way as axions . indeed ,",
    "if the maximum temperature reached in the universe is smaller than the branon freeze - out temperature @xmath51 , but larger than the explicit symmetry breaking scale @xmath52 , then branons can be considered as essentially massless particles decoupled from the rest of matter and radiation . in such a case , there is no reason to expect that the brane initial position @xmath53 should coincide with the potential minimum , but in general we would have @xmath54 .",
    "thus as the universe cools down , the brane can start oscillating coherently around the equilibrium position , in a completely analogous way to the axion misalignment mechanism .",
    "the energy density of those oscillations scales as that of non - relativistic matter , and can be estimated as @xcite : @xmath55 limits on the different parameters in such a case can be found in fig 5 .",
    "thermal vs. non - thermal branons regions in the @xmath46 plane .",
    "the dashed ( red ) line separates the two regions and corresponds to @xmath56 .",
    "the continuous ( black ) lines correspond to @xmath57 for different values of the radius of the extra dimensions @xmath58 gev@xmath45 .",
    "if branons constitute the dark matter of the universe , they will make up the galactic halo and could also be detected by direct or indirect detection experiments . in the direct case ,",
    "branons interact with the nuclei in the detector and the nucleus recoil energy can be measured .",
    "several underground experiments set limits on the branon mass and the elastic branon - nucleon cross section at zero momentum transfer @xmath59 @xcite ( see fig .",
    ".     elastic branon - nucleon cross section @xmath59 in terms of the branon mass .",
    "the thick ( red and green ) line corresponds to the @xmath60 curve for cold branons in fig . 2 from @xmath61 and @xmath62 branon species .",
    "the shaded areas are the lep - ii and tevatron - i exclusion regions .",
    "the solid lines correspond to the current limits on the spin - independent cross section from direct detection experiments .",
    "the discontinuous lines are the projected limits for future experiments .",
    "limits obtained from @xcite .",
    "the egret region correspond to parameter space for which dark matter annihilation in the galactic halo could account for the gamma - ray excess observed by egret @xcite",
    ".    branons could also be detected indirectly : their annihilations in the galactic halo can give rise to pairs of photons or @xmath63 which could be detected by @xmath64-ray telescopes such as magic or glast or antimatter detectors ( see @xcite for an estimation of positron and photon fluxes from branon annihilation in ams ) .",
    "annihilation of branons trapped in the center of the sun or the earth can give rise to high - energy neutrinos which could be detectable by high - energy neutrino telescopes .",
    "dark matter annihilation has been proposed as a possible explanation for the excess of flux above 1 gev in the egret data of the diffuse galactic gamma rays . for that purpose a wimp mass around 50 - 70 gev would be required . in fig .",
    "6 we include the parameter region calculated from @xcite",
    "branons can also have phenomenological consequences through virtual effects @xcite .",
    "probably the most immediate effect of virtual branons is the suppression of the coupling of sm particles and the kk modes of bulk fields like the graviton . when branon fluctuations are taken into account this effective coupling is described by the action : @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the squared reduced planck mass .",
    "the @xmath67 couplings appear due to the fact that the brane is no more sitting at @xmath68 , but can fluctuate around this point .",
    "now the branons fields can be integrated out in the usual way to find : @xmath69 where the @xmath70 expectation value is given by : @xmath71 e^{i s_{eff}^{(2)}[\\pi ] } f_p(\\pi)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    to compute the path integral above , we need to know the precise form of the @xmath72 functions which depends on the geometry of the extra dimensions . for the simplest case of torus compactification ,",
    "the effective action becomes : @xmath73 in other words , the effect of branon quantum fluctuations amounts to introducing the kk mode dependent couplings @xmath74 which are given for toroidal compactification by @xmath75\\right)\\ ] ] where we have introduce and ultraviolet cutoff @xmath76 in order to regularize the divergent integrals .",
    "thus the coupling of sm matter to higher kk modes is exponentially suppressed .",
    "this result was first obtained in @xcite for massless branons by using an argument based on normal ordering . in any case",
    "this coupling suppression has very interesting consequences from the phenomenological point of view .",
    "it improves the unitarity behavior of the cross section for producing gravitons from sm particles and , in addition , it solves the problem of the divergences appearing even at the tree level when one considers the kk graviton tower propagators for dimension equal or larger than two .",
    "moreover whenever we have @xmath77 , kk gravitons decouple from the sm particles , so that at low energies the only brane - world related particles that must be taken into account are branons .    in order to study the effect of virtual branons on the sm particles ,",
    "it is useful to introduce the sm effective action @xmath78 $ ] obtained after integrating out the branon fields : @xmath79}=\\int [ d\\pi ] e^{is_{sm}[\\phi,\\pi]}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this effective action is in general a non - local and divergent functional of the standard model fields and in order to obtain finite results we have used a cut - off ( @xmath76 ) regularization procedure as before .",
    "the new local divergent terms are organized in powers of the fields so that , at the level of two - point functions , we have @xcite : @xmath80 where @xmath81 with @xmath82 the number of branon species .",
    "this term is proportional to the trace of the sm energy - momentum tensor and accordingly amounts to a renormalization of sm masses .",
    "to second order , we get : @xmath83 where @xmath84 .",
    "these counterterms introduce new interaction vertices which are not present in the sm lagrangian .",
    "the most relevant ones could be the four - fermion interactions or the fermion pair annihilation into two gauge bosons .",
    "we have used the data coming from hera , tevatron and lep on this kind of processes in order to set bounds on the parameter combination @xmath85 .",
    "the results are shown in table 1 , where it is also possible to find the prospects for the future colliders mentioned above .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      limits from virtual branon searches at colliders ( results at the @xmath86 c.l . )",
    "the indices @xmath87 denote the two - photon , @xmath43 and @xmath88 ( @xmath89 ) channels respectively .",
    "the first four analysis have been performed with real data , whereas the final four are estimations .",
    "the first two columns correspond to the center of mass energy and total luminosity , and the third one corresponds to the lower bound on @xmath90 .    as we have commented above",
    ", @xmath76 is the cutoff which limits the validity of the effective description of branon and sm dynamics .",
    "this new parameter appears when dealing with branon radiative corrections since the lagrangian in ( [ lag ] ) is not renormalizable .",
    "a one - loop calculation with the new effective four - fermion vertices coming from ( [ eff ] ) , is equivalent to a two - loop computation with the lagrangian in ( [ lag ] ) , and allows us to obtain the contribution of branons to the muon anomalous magnetic moment @xcite : @xmath91 we can observe that the correction has the right sign and that it is thus possible to improve the agreement with the experimental value .",
    "in fact , the difference between the experimental and the sm prediction @xcite measured at the @xmath92 level by the brookhaven @xmath93 collaboration is @xmath94 .",
    "thus , we can estimate the preferred parameter region for branon physics as : @xmath95 another limitation to the branon parameters could be obtained from electroweak precision measurements , which use to be very useful to constrain models of new physics .",
    "the so called oblique corrections ( the ones corresponding to the @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath64 two - point functions ) use to be described in terms of the @xmath98 or the @xmath99 and @xmath100 parameters .",
    "the experimental values obtained by lep are consistent with the sm prediction for a light higgs @xmath101 gev at 95 % c.l . in principle , it is necessary to know this parameter in order to put constraints on new physics , but one can calculate the disfavored regions of parameters in order to avoid fine tunings .",
    "we can estimate this area by performing a computation of the parameter @xmath102 , in a similar way as it was done for the first order correction coming from the kaluza - klein gravitons in the add models for rigid branes @xcite .",
    "the experimental value of @xmath103 obtained from lep is @xmath104 .",
    "the theoretical uncertainties are one order of magnitude smaller and therefore , we can estimate the constraints for the branon contribution at 95 % c.l . as @xmath105 with the result @xcite : @xmath106",
    "in this work we have reviewed the main phenomenological consequences of flexible brane worlds .",
    "the new effects can be described in a model - independent way by means of the low - energy effective action for branons which depends essentially on only two parameters : the brane tension scale @xmath41 and the branon mass @xmath47 .",
    "we have computed the limits on those parameters from lep and tevatron i data , and the prospects for detection in future colliders .    we have shown that branons are natural candidates for dark matter both as thermal and non - thermal relics in different regions of the parameter space .",
    "we have obtained the cosmological limits from wmap observations and also studied the prospects for detection of branons in the galactic halo from direct or indirect searches experiments .",
    "finally , we have considered additional constraints on branon physics from virtual effects , and those coming from electroweak precision observables .",
    "the new two - loop diagrams involving branons are shown to give a non - vanishing contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment , which could explain the observed difference between the sm prediction and the measurements of the brookhaven @xmath93 collaboration .",
