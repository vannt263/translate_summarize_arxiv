    "a solid majority of observed galaxies have disk - dominant morphology ; despite wide variance in methods of sampling and classification , roughly 70% of galaxy - sized dark matter halos in the universe host late - type systems @xcite .",
    "moreover , @xcite find that about one - third of all local disk galaxies have no observable pressure - supported component ( whether a  classical \" bulge formed by the central starburst associated with a merger event , or a  pseudobulge \" having arisen from the secular transport of angular momentum towards the galactic center ) , and another one - third host systems with only pseudobulges , a conclusion supported by spheroid - disk decomposition of large galaxy samples @xcite .",
    "the vast majority of disk stars in the milky way reside in the thin disk component , with an exponential scale height of @xmath5  pc ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) and",
    "a total velocity dispersion of @xmath6 km s@xmath7 @xcite . whether the scale height of the galactic disk is typical for galaxies of its size is a topic of vital interest .",
    "unfortunately , firm measurements for a statistical sample of galaxies have been limited by dust obscuration , which present a problem even in k - band imaging @xcite .    aside from the considerable challenges associated with forming disk galaxies in @xmath1cdm cosmologies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , hierarchical models must also self - consistently maintain thin , rotationally - supported systems against the constant barrage of merging subhalos .",
    "though the former endeavor has enjoyed some recent advances @xcite , the survival of disk galaxies during the often - violent mass accretion history of their dark host remains a concern @xcite and has been the target of numerous studies aimed at quantifying the resilience of galactic disks to satellite accretion events @xcite .",
    "both numerical simulations @xcite and purely analytic calculations @xcite indicate that mass delivery into dark matter halos of mass @xmath8 is dominated by the accretion of objects with mass @xmath9 .",
    "@xcite find that @xmath10 of @xmath11 galaxy - sized halos have accreted a system of mass @xmath2 into their virial radii in the last 10 gyr , with associated disk impacts within the last 8 gyr .",
    "@xcite also find that less massive accretions are virtually ubiquitous , and that the merger fraction falls off quickly for satellites larger than @xmath12 .",
    "overall , these results suggest that @xmath13 satellite accretion events represent the primary concern for disk survival in @xmath1cdm . along these lines ,",
    "recent analytic work by @xcite suggests that orbital energy deposition via merger is less destructive to a disk than was often previously surmised @xcite , claiming that the galaxy could have undergone @xmath14 independent mergers of this kind since @xmath15 while maintaining a thin disk .",
    "recently , @xcite utilized dissipationless @xmath4-body simulations to investigate the response of thin galactic disks subject to a @xmath1cdm - motivated satellite accretion history .",
    "these authors showed that the thin disk component survives , though it is strongly perturbed by the violent gravitational encounters with substructure .",
    "however , @xcite focused on infalling systems with masses in the range @xmath16 , ignoring the most massive accretion events expected over a galaxy s lifetime . in this letter",
    ", we expand upon this initiative by investigating the morphological and dynamical evolution of initially - thin galaxy - type disks during cosmologically common @xmath13 accretion events involving two - component ( stars and dark matter ) satellites of mass @xmath2 .    working in a similar mass regime",
    ", @xcite simulated the formation of thick disks via the infall of satellite galaxies with virial masses @xmath17 that of the host , using both a @xmath18 galactic primary system and a scaled version at @xmath19 in order to show that realistic thick disks result from these impacts .",
    "though our preparation is similar , our goals and techniques are different .",
    "we aim to determine whether _ any _ thin , dynamically cold component can survive such an event , and conservatively use a primary disk that is as massive as the milky way disk _",
    "today_.    past investigations into the stability of galactic disks against the infall of satellites have often suffered from the necessities of numerical limitations or from analytic axioms later deemed incompatible with standard cosmological models ; for example , the modeling of one or more structural components as rigid potentials @xcite , the initialization of a disk much thicker than the old , thin stellar disk of the galaxy @xcite , the infall of satellites with only a concentrated baryonic component @xcite , and the imposition of subhalo infalls with orbital parameters inconsistent with @xmath1cdm cosmological models @xcite .",
    "analytic arguments , meanwhile , have historically been forced to assume simplifications such as the local deposition of a satellite s orbital energy @xcite , or the absence of global heating modes @xcite which are analytically shown to dominate disk heating by @xcite , although the latter authors employ a rigid satellite model and perfectly radial polar orbits for their simulated experimental tests .",
    "fortunately , advances both in computational power and in our understanding of @xmath1cdm expectations allow us to address these concerns directly .",
    "our contribution improves upon earlier studies in several important respects .",
    "first and foremost , we examine the response of galactic disks to accretion events that represent the primary concern for disk survival in @xmath1cdm cosmologies .",
    "secondly , we employ galaxy and satellite models that are constructed in equilibrium from fully self - consistent distribution functions and which have the resolution in force and mass to study the heating of a disk that is as thin as the old thin stellar disk of the milky way ( @xmath20  pc ) ; in synergy with the high mass and force resolution we adopt , this quality allows us to construct equilibrium @xmath4-body models of disk galaxies that are as thin as the _ old _ , thin stellar disk of the galaxy .",
    "lastly , the masses , density structure , stellar content , and orbital configurations of our infalling satellites are directly motivated by the prevailing @xmath1cdm paradigm of structure formation .",
    "all simulations are performed using the multi - stepping , parallel , tree @xmath4-body code pkdgrav @xcite , in which we set the gravitational softening length to @xmath21 100 pc and 50 pc for dark matter and stellar particles , respectively .",
    "we construct @xmath4-body realizations of primary disk galaxies and satellites using the method of @xcite .",
    "this technique produces self - consistent , multi - component galaxy models that are ideal for studying complex dynamical processes associated with the intrinsic fragility of galactic disks such as gravitational interactions with infalling subhalos .",
    "we explore two initial models for the primary galaxy in our satellite - disk encounter simulations : _ galaxy 1 _ ( hereafter g1 ) , a milky - way - analog system drawn from the set of self - consistent equilibrium models that best fit galactic observational parameters as produced by @xcite ; and _ galaxy 2 _ ( hereafter g2 ) , an identical system save for the absence of a central bulge , i.e. , the two models have stellar disks and dark halos with equivalent _ initial _ properties . in each case the dark matter halo of the primary galaxy was populated by @xmath22 particles following the ( * ? ?",
    "* hereafter nfw ) density profile with scale radius @xmath23 kpc , and the bulge in g1 ( comprised of @xmath24 particles ) contained a stellar mass @xmath25 following a srsic profile with effective radius @xmath26 kpc and index @xmath27 .",
    "the stellar disks , comprised of @xmath28 particles each , contained a mass @xmath29 following an exponential distribution in cylindrical radius with scale length @xmath30 kpc , while the vertical distribution of stars was described by a sech@xmath31 function with @xmath32 kpc being the vertical scale height .",
    "we note that the choice of numerical and physical parameters minimize secular evolution ( e.g. , strong bar formation , artificial heating through interactions with massive halo particles ) on the timescales of relevance to our investigation , which could interfere with the interpretation of our results . in the left panel of figure  [ fig : maps ]",
    ", we show the edge - on surface brightness map for both primary galaxy models , having assumed a stellar mass - to - light ratio @xmath33 .",
    "the satellite galaxy in each case was initialized with @xmath34 dark particles representing a mass @xmath35 within the virial radius of a halo which is well - fit by an nfw profile with a concentration @xmath36 at @xmath37 .",
    "we populate this satellite with a stellar mass @xmath38 , roughly corresponding to the upper-@xmath39 limit derived by @xcite for @xmath40 at our subhalo s virial mass , and we distribute these @xmath41 stellar particles in a central spheroid with srsic index @xmath42 according to the distribution of shape parameters versus dwarf elliptical galaxy magnitudes found by @xcite in their survey of virgo cluster members .",
    "our initial subhalo velocity vectors are motivated by cosmological investigations of substructure accretions , where the distributions of radial and tangential velocity components ( @xmath43 and @xmath44 ) peak respectively at 90% and 60% of the virial velocity of the satellite s host halo @xcite . in our case",
    "this corresponds to an initial subhalo velocity with @xmath45 km / s and @xmath46 km / s .",
    "we initiate the infall of each simulation s subhalo at a relatively large radius of approximately @xmath47 kpc to ensure that the disk does not suffer substantial perturbations due to the sudden presence of the satellite s potential well .",
    "we simulate an array of orbital inclinations ( @xmath48 , defining @xmath49 as the angle between the angular momentum axes of the disk and the orbit ) in order to assess the consequence of this parameter on the evolution of the galactic disk . in the polar infall ( @xmath50 )",
    ", we eliminate the tangential velocity component of the subhalo , sending the satellite on a direct - impact trajectory into the center of the primary galaxy ; this case is somewhat unrealistic , but provides an interesting experimental benchmark .",
    "all but one of the non - polar subhalo orbits are initialized as prograde with respect to the primary galaxy s rotation ; we also simulate a retrograde orbit for g1 with @xmath51 in order to investigate whether the heating effects are reduced ( as conjectured by * ? ? ?",
    "all simulations were evolved for a total of 5 gyr , after which the subhalo has fully coalesced into the center of the host halo and the stellar disk has relaxed into stability ; although there are certainly remnant features in the outer disk and halo that will continue to phase - mix and virialize on a much longer timescale , our investigations indicate that the disk - evolution process has reached a quasi - steady state by this point in the encounter s evolution .",

    "edge - on surface brightness profiles for remnants of the @xmath52 and 90@xmath53 impacts are shown in the middle and left panels of figure 1 , where the upper and lower renderings correspond to primary cases g1 and g2 , respectively ( with and without initial bulge ) .",
    "it is clear from these images that the resultant disks are considerably thicker than the initial case .",
    "we note that while the stars in the accreted satellite end up in the final disk remnant ( c.f .",
    "villalobos & helmi 2008 ) , primary disk stars dominate these images , even high above the plane .",
    "figure  [ fig : diskheight ] shows the minor - axis surface brightness profiles for the g1 simulations using @xmath33 .",
    "the left panel shows a vertical slice at a projected radius of @xmath54 kpc and the right panel shows a similar slice at radius @xmath55 .",
    "black solid lines show the initial disk and different color / line types represent the remnants as indicated .",
    "clearly , the resultant disks are dramatically thicker than the initial galaxy model in each case . in order to conservatively compare our disks to the milky way",
    ", we allow for thick _ and _ thin components by fitting a double - sech@xmath31 profile at @xmath56 .",
    "the fitted scale heights are shown in table  [ finalscaleheights ] and compared directly in figure  [ fig : scaleheight ] to the galactic values obtained by @xcite .",
    "profiles that fall by one mag / arcsec@xmath31 at the same height as the exponential fits .",
    "this multiplicative factor is more appropriate for thin - disk comparisons near the peak of the profile than the widely - used factor of 2 that matches exponential and sech@xmath31 profiles at large heights above the disk plane . ]",
    "though we initially employ a disk that is thicker ( @xmath57 kpc ) and therefore conservatively more robust to accretion events ( kazantzidis et al .",
    "2009 , in preparation ) than the galactic value of @xmath58 kpc from @xcite , the final systems all have thin - disk components with @xmath59 larger by a factor of @xmath60 than the milky way . moreover , the low - surface - brightness thick component in our remnant disks is also considerably thicker than the galactic thick disk , with scale heights so large ( @xmath61 kpc ) that this material would likely be considered a stellar halo component .",
    "a second relevant measure of disk survival is the stellar velocity dispersion ; we therefore compare the velocity ellipsoid of our final disks to that observed in the solar neighborhood by the geneva - copenhagen survey ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also @xcite ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : sigma ] , we show these values for velocity dispersion in each coordinate , where the indicated range spans the stellar population age , and the point is placed at the median age @xmath62 gyr according to @xcite for this local sample . shown also are the corresponding dispersion components for our initial and final stellar disks measured within an 0.3-kpc box centered on the disk plane at @xmath63kpc . as summarized in table 2 , each of our simulated merger remnants",
    "are substantially enhanced in all three components of velocity dispersion ( @xmath64 corresponding to @xmath65 ) .",
    "the total dispersion @xmath66 increases by a factor of @xmath67 compared to that of the initial disk .",
    "using fully self - consistent @xmath4-body simulations of satellite - disk interactions we have quantitatively demonstrated for the first time that cosmologically common accretion events of mass ratio @xmath13 do not preserve thin , dynamically cold stellar disks like the old , thin stellar disk of the milky way .",
    "this has potentially serious ramifications for models of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "it is possible that our benchmark case of the milky way is not representative , and that the galaxy sits within a rare halo that has not experienced in the last @xmath68 gyr a disk impact associated with a significant accretion event , as posited in the observationally - motivated suggestion of @xcite , in which the galaxy is shown to have remarkably low angular momentum and stellar mass compared to local spiral galaxies in host halos of similar mass .",
    "future investigations may help quantify the range of thin - disk scale heights in the local universe .",
    "otherwise , the addition of gas physics may play a role in explaining the apparent discrepancy .",
    "gas can cool and reform a thin disk , and its presence may stabilize the stellar disk ( e.g. ,   * ? ? ?",
    "the regrowth of the massive thin disk _ after _ a satellite accretion may cause heated stars to contract and lose kinetic energy .",
    "accurate treatment of the various aspects of hydrodynamics will therefore play a crucial role in the capacity of simulated galaxy evolution to reproduce thin disks such as those that dominate observed galaxy catalogs .    in a recent paper @xcite",
    "have argued that disk heating is less effective than previously thought and that the expected merger histories of @xmath1cdm  halos are compatible with the high thin - disk fraction seen in the universe .",
    "it is important , therefore , to investigate this point of disagreement .",
    "their result , a reshaping of the arguments presented in @xcite ( updated to reflect the more realistically radialized orbits of a @xmath1cdm cosmology ) , relied primarily on an analytic formula , normalized to simulations with much lower mass and force resolution than those explored here , to map the ratio ( @xmath69 ) to a disk heating parameter @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the median scale height of the resultant disk and @xmath72 is the radius where the height is measured ( and must be within a factor of two of the disk half - mass radius @xmath73 ) . for the @xmath13 mass - ratio accretion events we explore here , the @xcite formula predicts a disk thickening of @xmath74 .",
    "our simulations typically exhibit significantly more heating ; at @xmath75 we measure @xmath76 and , because of the impact - induced flaring , we measure even larger values @xmath77 at @xmath78 .",
    "it is perhaps not surprising that our results disagree with first - order analytic expectations .",
    "in addition to direct heating , the resultant disk structure is affected by global modes such as bending and density waves excited in the disk as the interaction occurs @xcite , and not included in the simple analytic scalings is a dependence on the orbital inclination of the encounter that is likely associated with resonant coupling .",
    "finally , though @xcite normalized their results to numerical simulations , those initial disks were significantly thicker than the galactic - type disk we have simulated , and were therefore more robust to tidal perturbations .",
    "direct numerical experiments involving satellite - disk encounters indicate that mass - ratio , orbital inclination , initial disk scale height , and relative dark matter fraction are all crucial in determining the degree to which galactic disks are perturbed by infalling subhalos ( figures  [ fig : scaleheight ] ,  [ fig : sigma ] , and kazantzidis et al .",
    "2009 , in preparation ) .",
    "more detailed analysis is forthcoming of the morphological and dynamical effects experienced by our disks ; among other concerns , we defer for future work the issues of stellar - halo / thick - disk distinguishability and the reinforcement of central bulges by accreted stars .",
