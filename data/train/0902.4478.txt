    "the motivation for the present work arose from the analysis of fluctuations in magnetically confined plasma during parameter scans in the h-1 flexible heliac @xcite .",
    "the h-1 heliac is a three field - period helical axis stellarator @xcite with major radius @xmath1 m , minor radius @xmath2 m and a finely tunable magnetic geometry .",
    "experimental scans through plasma configurations via the geometric parameter @xmath3 , which controls the rotational transform @xmath4 ( twist of the magnetic field lines ) and shear @xmath5(radial derivative of rotational transform ) , have produced diverse spectra of magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) activity .",
    "the mhd activity is recorded via two toroidally separated poloidal arrays of mirnov coils ( induction solenoids ) which sample @xmath6 locally . in the example dataset",
    "presented here , 28 mirnov coils are used for 92 distinct plasma configurations , resulting in more than 100,000 short time fourier spectra .",
    "the data mining process used to reduce this dataset is described in the following sections . in section",
    "[ sec : preprocessing ] we explain the preprocessing stage , which includes filtering and mapping into a high dimensional phase space . in section [ sec : clustering ] the clustering algorithm for distinguishing classes of fluctuations is described , followed by a demonstration of a visualisation procedure .",
    "a discussion of some important aspects of the procedure follows in section [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "we assume that each set of timeseries data can be represented as a @xmath7 matrix : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the inverse of the sampling frequency , @xmath10 is the number of channels and @xmath11 is the number of samples . in our example",
    "dataset , the signal amplitudes depend on the plasma - coil distance which is a function of the plasma shape ( magnetic configuration ) controlled by @xmath3 . to reduce any configurational bias on @xmath12 we normalise each channel to its variance .    to achieve time resolution @xmath13 , we split @xmath12 into short time segments @xmath14 with shape @xmath15 , where @xmath16 .",
    "we also assume there are an arbitrary number of @xmath12 relating to the same system , e.g. : an experiment repeated under different conditions . at this stage",
    "there is no need to distinguish between the @xmath14 from different @xmath12 , although we implicitly retain sufficient information to map the @xmath14 back to their original parameter sets .",
    "each @xmath14 is represented by a singular value decomposition ( svd ) @xcite @xmath17 where the columns of @xmath18 and @xmath19 contain the spatial ( topo ) and temporal ( chrono ) singular vectors respectively , @xmath20 denotes the conjugate transpose of @xmath19 , and the diagonal elements of @xmath21 are the @xmath22 non - negative singular values .",
    "the set of topos ( chronos ) are an orthonormal basis of @xmath23 .",
    "the convention is for the singular values to be sorted in decreasing monotonic order meaning that @xmath21 is independent of the ordering of the channels within @xmath14 . shown in figure [ fig : svdexample ] are singular values from a typical h1 mirnov dataset . from the chronos power spectra",
    "we see that there are two dominant modes , each with two singular values suggesting they are both travelling waves , as discussed below .",
    "we also see that the variance - normalisation of each channel degrades the signal to noise ratio of the system , which can also be described in terms of the normalised entropy .",
    "we calculate the normalised entropy @xmath24 of the singular values @xmath25 in @xmath21 : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the dimensionless energy : @xmath28 the low entropy case ( @xmath29 ) occurs when the system is well ordered . to some extent",
    "the scalar quantity @xmath24 can be used as a measure of how physically interesting the signals in @xmath14 are without any further investigation into the structure of @xmath14 , though care must be taken with this interpretation .",
    "a standing wave in a system with no noise has only one non - zero singular value @xmath30 giving @xmath31 , whereas a travelling wave requires two singular values so @xmath32 .",
    "are shown .",
    "@xmath33 denote the chronos from the normalised singular value @xmath34 .",
    "there are two distinct modes , one at @xmath35khz described by sv0 and sv1 ; the other , weaker , signal is at @xmath36khz and is described by sv2 and sv3 .",
    "the data is from h1 shot # 58122 at @xmath37ms . ]",
    "recognising that a travelling wave structure consists of a pair of singular values which naturally belong together we group similar singular values , defining a _ fluctuation structure _ @xmath38 as a subset of singular values which have chronos with similar power spectra .",
    "we measure the similarity between two chronos @xmath39 and @xmath40 with the normalised average of the cross - power spectrum @xmath41 : @xmath42 where @xmath43 , @xmath44 is the fourier transform , and @xmath45 represents the spectral average .",
    "when allocating singular values to fluctuation structures , the observation : @xmath46 suggests that we should not simply seek to require @xmath47 for each pair of singular values @xmath48 within a structure , instead we follow the process in algorithm 1 . in",
    "so doing we therefore require that each constituent singular vector has sufficient @xmath49 with the dominant singular vector of the structure .",
    "define a new fluctuation structure as an empty set of singular values : @xmath50 denote the largest unallocated singular value by @xmath51 allocate @xmath52 to fluctuation structure @xmath53    various possible fluctuation structures for the dataset of figure [ fig : svdexample ] are shown in figure [ fig : gammaenergy ] as a function of the threshold value @xmath54 . at @xmath55 , all singular values are grouped together as a single fluctuation structure , while at @xmath56 each fluctuation structure contains one singular value .",
    "the key features are the two fluctuation structures @xmath57 and @xmath58 which coexist for @xmath59 . after application of such analysis to a suitably sized sample of short time segments ,",
    "a threshold of @xmath60 was found to be appropriate for our dataset .    .",
    "the dataset is the same as in figure [ fig : svdexample ] .",
    "we see that @xmath61 allows unrelated singular values to be included within a fluctuation structure , whereas with @xmath62 algorithm 1 will not recognise the similarity between @xmath63 and @xmath64 . ]",
    "filters are applied to the dataset in order to reduce its size and to remove noise .",
    "two values which can be used to quantify the quality of the data are the normalised energy @xmath65 and normalised entropy @xmath24 .",
    "the normalised energy @xmath65 of a fluctuation structure is defined as the sum of the normalised energies of its constituent singular values from equation [ eqn : pe ] .",
    "the nature of these thresholds is quite different ; @xmath24 thresholds will act upon the entire short time segments , whereas @xmath65 thresholds affect individual fluctuation structures .    using a normalised energy threshold value @xmath66",
    "allows filtering out of low energy noise .",
    "as seen in our example dataset ( figure [ fig : hp_with_p_int ] ) , there appears to be a clear distinction between higher energy fluctuations ( @xmath67 ) and lower energy noise ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "the use of @xmath24 thresholds is not always appropriate , especially if spectra are present with several distinct fluctuations ; in such cases if the dataset needs to be reduced in size it is preferable to simply use a random subset of the data .",
    "entropy filtering is generally more useful when a significant number of @xmath14 contain only noise .",
    "an alternative to using a hard @xmath65 threshold uses an energy threshold defined as a fraction of the possible range of normalised energy for a given singular value , before constructing fluctuation structures .",
    "this method is more sensitive to modes which have reduced @xmath27 due to the coexistence of other modes .",
    "the @xmath69 largest singular value in a given short time segment has , by definition , a maximal normalised energy of @xmath70 .",
    "we then apply a factor @xmath71 , where @xmath72 , and , starting with the smallest singular value , retain singular values with @xmath73 .",
    "any point retained brings in all larger singular values from the same time segment , trumping the @xmath73 condition for lower @xmath74 . the requirement for bringing in larger singular values",
    "is easily understood by considering the case of a mode having two singular values of almost equal energy , it is possible for the lower energy value to exceed the threshold with the higher value below the threshold .",
    "we regard each fluctuation structure as a point in the space @xmath76^{n_c}$ ] , an @xmath10dimensional torus of length @xmath77 which we will call @xmath78-space . in this application @xmath79 represents the electrical phase of the reconstructed fluctuation structure at the positions of the coils .",
    "fluctuation structures which are close in @xmath78-space can be considered the same type .",
    "this interpretation arises from the expectation that the possible waves have various phase velocities and mode numbers due to the periodic boundary conditions of the physical plasma torus in which they propagate .",
    "it is also applicable to the more general case where waves are spatially localised within the system and do not have well defined mode numbers .    for each fluctuation structure",
    "@xmath80 we take the inverse svd to get @xmath81 : @xmath82 where the elements of @xmath21 not in @xmath80 are set to zero to form @xmath83 .",
    "the rows of the matrix @xmath81 contain the timeseries relating to @xmath80 for each channel .",
    "in general , the power spectra of the topos in @xmath80 are peaked around a single frequency @xmath84 .",
    "the phase differences @xmath85 between channels @xmath86 and @xmath87 evaluated at @xmath88 are used to define the coordinates in @xmath78-space . using phase differences between each pair of channels would result in a @xmath89-dimensional space ; instead we use the @xmath90dimensional space of only nearest neighbour channels . note that in our example dataset the actual phase difference between channels depends on @xmath3 so we map the phase differences to a coordinate system which is independent of @xmath3 , namely the @xmath3-averaged magnetic angles of the mirnov coils",

    "the left panel shows @xmath65 and @xmath24 for the fluctuation structures .",
    "the middle panel shows the number of fluctuation structures @xmath91 within @xmath92 .",
    "the right panel shows @xmath93 , which is effectively the density of normalised energy ; while this is not physically meaningful because the normalisation factor is dependent on short time segment , it is a useful guide to the energy distribution among fluctuation structures . ]      as an overview of the preprocessed dataset , figure [ fig : kappafreq ] shows the fluctuation structures with energy @xmath94 mapped to the magnetic geometry parameter @xmath3 ; the radial location of low - order rational magnetic surfaces , @xmath95 , are also shown .",
    "these rational surfaces are important as fluctuations with toroidal and poloidal mode numbers @xmath74 and @xmath96 respectively can resonate with the twisted field lines .",
    "the main features of the fluctuation spectra are the resonances about @xmath97 and @xmath98 , related to the @xmath99 and @xmath100 surfaces respectively .",
    "we expect that any automated process used to locate distinct types of fluctuations would identify these features , and hopefully find some less obvious features .",
    "indeed in section [ sec : discussion ] it can be seen that these two features are the first to be distinguished by the following clustering algorithm .    ,",
    "marker size and colour are proportion to the normalised energy of the fluctuation structure . in the lower panel ,",
    "the average minor radial @xmath101 locations of low order rational magnetic surfaces are shown . ]",
    "we aim to discover any underlying lower - dimensional model of the dataset ; that is , groups of fluctuation structures which are similar throughout some range of short time segments . as discussed in section [ sec : mappingfs ] , we assume that a class of fluctuations is localised in the @xmath10-dimensional @xmath75-space .",
    "for example , it is simple to understand such localisation in terms of a simple cylindrical geometry with equidistant poloidal measurements , where each mode with poloidal mode number @xmath96 will be located at @xmath102 in each dimension .",
    "however , we assume a generalised case in which the fluctuation may have arbitrary , including localised , structure .    many different types of clustering algorithms exist ; here we use the expectation maximisation ( em ) algorithm which is a method for estimating the most likely values of latent variables in a probabilistic model@xcite . here",
    "we assume that each type of fluctuation can be described by a @xmath10-dimensional gaussian distribution in @xmath75 space .",
    "the latent variables are the mean @xmath103 and standard deviation @xmath104 for each cluster @xmath105 , where @xmath106 and @xmath107 is the number of clusters . given the initial conditions , in the form of random initial @xmath103 and @xmath104 values for a prescribed number of clusters , the em algorithm consists of two steps which repeat until a convergence criterion is met .",
    "firstly , the expectation step assigns to each datapoint a probability , or expectation value , of belonging to each cluster which is calculated with the gaussian distribution function .",
    "secondly , @xmath103 and @xmath104 are recalculated using the new expectation values as weight factors",
    ".    the 10-fold cross - validated log - likelihood ratio is used as a measure of how well the cluster assignments fit the data .",
    "the cross - validation process involves partitioning the dataset into random subsamples and comparing results from each subset to avoid oversensitivity to outliers in the data .",
    "the likelihood is the conditional probability of obtaining the cluster means and standard deviations given the observed data . because the em algorithm can only guarantee a local maximum in likelihood we use a monte carlo approach , with multiple repetitions with different randomised initial conditions for each @xmath107 .",
    "the identification of the correct number of clusters , or of those which are important , is a task that is by no means trivial to automate .",
    "we have found inspection of a dendrogram , or _ cluster tree _ , mapping to be a practical method for identifying the important clusters .",
    "the cluster tree displays clusters for each @xmath107 below some maximum value @xmath108 , with all clusters for a given @xmath107 forming a single tree level .",
    "each child cluster is mapped to the cluster on the parent level with which it has the largest fraction of common datapoints .",
    "cluster branches which do not fork over a significant range of @xmath107 are deemed to be well defined , and the point where well defined clusters start to break up suggests that @xmath107 is too high .",
    "while this procedure is clearly a subjective one , it is effective and does not depend on the type of clustering algorithm used .",
    "the cluster tree for our example dataset is shown in figures [ fig : eg_cluster_tree ] .",
    "each cluster has been defined only by its phase structure @xmath79 and mapped back to @xmath3 and frequency @xmath109 .",
    "the base of the tree ( @xmath110 ) shows all the data within a single cluster ( em : a ) ; as we climb up the tree different classes of fluctuation are isolated .",
    "for example , the branch starting at cluster em : b contains fluctuations with toroidal mode number @xmath111 and poloidal mode number @xmath112 which occur at configurations near the @xmath113 resonance ( @xmath114 ) . similarly , the branch containing cluster em : c is due to the @xmath100 resonance near @xmath115 .",
    "other clusters include fluctuations which occur at higher order resonances , as well as low frequency @xmath116 modes ( cluster em : o branch ) and weakly defined residual clusters ( em : k and em : l ) which would be resolved at a higher level of the tree than is shown here .    shown in figure [ fig : poloidalphase ] are poloidal phase - angle plots for a single poloidal mirnov array .",
    "the centre line corresponds to the cumulative mean phase of the coil pairs .",
    "the lines above and below are the cumulative cluster standard deviations of the coil pairs , where @xmath117 for @xmath118 . here",
    ", the magnetic angles have been evaluated for a flux surface at @xmath119 m to better represent the broad radial structure expected for these modes .",
    "the data mining algorithm presented here is potentially useful in numerous other domains where spatio - temporal data is used .",
    "however , there is a limitation to the nature of the fluctuations amenable to this analysis due to the svd .",
    "the svd is not effective in distinguishing different modes coexisting with the same frequency or spatial structure because the modes would share a chrono or topo , whereas the svd requires orthogonal components to distinguish modes .",
    "the assumption that such coexisting modes are not present is also important in assigning a single frequency @xmath84 to a fluctuation structure , i.e. : two modes with the same spatial structure will also share chronos , but only one frequency would be recorded .",
    "the em clustering method described here relies on the assumption that clusters can be described by a gaussian distribution . to check if the imposed gaussian distributions significantly influence the cluster outcomes , we have also used the agglomerative hierarchical ( ah ) clustering algorithm @xcite which does not make such an assumption .",
    "the initial condition for ah clustering is that each fluctuation structure defines a cluster . using a suitable metric the two closest clusters",
    "are combined , iterating the process until we have @xmath110 gives a ( prohibitively large ) cluster tree .",
    "compression of the ah cluster tree can be achieved by filtering out clusters with small populations , allowing for a visualisation similar to the em cluster tree in figure [ fig : eg_cluster_tree ] ; a set of ah clusters which are essentially equivalent to the @xmath120 level of the em cluster tree are also shown in figure [ fig : eg_cluster_tree ] .",
    "the clusters resulting from the em and ah methods have been found to be essentially the same apart from the weakly defined clusters ( em : k , l ) and the ` remainder ' ( ah : rem ) , a quantitative comparison between populations of em and ah clusters in figure [ fig : eg_cluster_tree ] is shown in table [ arr : em_ah_matrix_tgt10ms ] .",

    "the scalability of the clustering stage depends on the algorithm used , for the em case we have @xmath123 , which gives @xmath121 for constant @xmath107 .",
    "the ah clustering algorithm is less desirable as it has complexity @xmath124 due to distance calculation between each pair of fluctuation structures .",
    "we have implemented the preprocessing and visualisation stages using the python language with the scipy and matplotlib libraries @xcite .",
    "the preprocessing of our dataset , 4600 s arrays ( @xmath125 by @xmath126 ) , takes around 2 hours using a @xmath127ghz intel pentium m processor .",
    "the results are stored in mysql tables ; a table of fluctuation structure properties excluding @xmath75-space mapping is around @xmath128 mb in size , with the @xmath129 rows of the @xmath75 mapping table taking around @xmath130 mb , using optimal data types . for clustering",
    ", we have used the em algorithm from the weka suite of data mining tools @xcite which runs at about @xmath131 cpu seconds using @xmath132ghz amd opteron processors . for each @xmath107 ,",
    "100 randomised initial conditions were used ; the results with maximal log - likelihood are selected as the best clusters .",
    "the weka algorithm does not operate with toroidal data , so we map the @xmath133space from the @xmath10-dimensional torus to a @xmath134-dimensional cube @xmath135^{2n_c}$ ] by taking the @xmath136 and @xmath137 components . for the present work",
    ", no specific efforts were made to optimize the clustering process ; more efficient clustering routines exist , including , for example , genetic algorithms for faster convergence .    the physical nature of the fluctuations in our example dataset is not yet completely understood .",
    "the dependence of spectra on plasma density @xmath74 and @xmath4 suggests a dispersion relation similar to that of the global alfvn eigenmode ( gae ) @xcite .",
    "however , the observed frequencies are smaller than the expected gae frequencies by a factor of around @xmath138 @xcite ; an experimental campaign is presently being undertaken in order to resolve this difference .",
    "we have presented a highly automated data mining process for the characterisation of fluctuations in multichannel timeseries data .",
    "the manual interaction is restricted to two tasks : the selection of a cross - power threshold @xmath54 and the choice of appropriate filter parameters .",
    "the former requires initial consideration of threshold effectiveness on a small subset of data , while the latter is an operation applied to the dataset as a whole .",
    "given an appropriate choice of clustering algorithm , the data mining process scales well , with complexity @xmath121 .",
    "we have used the procedure here with magnetic fluctuation data from configuration scans in the h-1 heliac , identifying different modes in parameter space .",
