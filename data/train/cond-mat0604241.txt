    "mean - field theories with self - consistency equations have played a central role in the development of our microscopic understanding on quantum many - particle systems , especially on broken - symmetry phases .",
    "one of the most outstanding examples is undoubtedly the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) theory of superconductivity,@xcite which may be regarded now as the hartree - fock theory in the nambu space.@xcite in some notable cases like the bcs theory , mean - field theories have brought remarkable quantitative descriptions of experiments .",
    "at least , each mean - field theory have provided a basic starting point for later developments , as the weiss@xcite and the stoner@xcite theories for localized and itinerant ferromagnets , respectively .",
    "hence there is every need for a mean - field theory of every quantum system .",
    "however , there has been no established mean - field theory for bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) .    over the last sixty years",
    ", the field theory has manifested itself as one of the most powerful microscopic approaches to quantum many - particle systems .",
    "it was first applied to bose particles in the celebrated work of bogoliubov,@xcite followed by intensive theoretical investigations in later years.@xcite however , it has brought a rather poor description of condensed bose particles at finite temperatures .",
    "for example , we still do not have a complete agreement on the bose - einstein condensation temperature @xmath11 of the homogeneous weakly interacting bose gas under constant density @xmath5,@xcite not to mention its thermodynamic properties over @xmath12 ; see refs .   and for a review on the @xmath11 calculations",
    "this situation is partly due to the absence of a well - established renormalized perturbation theory for bose systems corresponding to the luttinger - ward theory on fermi liquids.@xcite indeed , important formal results on bose systems have often been obtained with the bare perturbation theory , as in the case of the hugenholtz - pines theorem.@xcite however , the bare perturbation expansion itself is not very suitable for practical calculations due to the infrared divergences inherent in bose systems . on the other hand",
    ", we still do not have a systematic approximation scheme of how to renormalize the condensate wave function and the quasiparticle green s function self - consistently without losing the physical essentials of condensed bose particles .",
    "the self - consistent wick decomposition procedure has proved to be quite powerful for most quantum many - particle systems at finite temperatures and might be used also for bose particles . the corresponding mean - field theory for condensed bose systems",
    "is known now as the girardeau - arnowitt theory@xcite or the hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) theory.@xcite however , it predicts an energy gap in the excitation spectrum , in contradiction to the hugenholtz - pines theorem of declaring a gapless excitation .",
    "thus , it has become customary to introduce a further approximation to the hfb theory , now generally called the `` popov '' approximation,@xcite of completely ignoring the anomalous quasiparticle pair correlation to recover a gapless excitation .",
    "when it is adopted to describe dynamics , however , the same approximation does not satisfy various conservation laws as required .",
    "also , it is not clear whether it is permissible or not to neglect the pair correlation completely .",
    "recently , proukakis _",
    "et al_.  @xcite have presented an improved gapless theory with finite pair correlation .",
    "however , it still does not satisfy the conservation laws .",
    "thus , there has been no mean - field theory for condensed bose systems that simultaneously carries the important properties of the exact theory pointed out by hohenberg and martin:@xcite `` conserving '' and `` gapless . ''",
    "on the basis of these observations , we have recently formulated a new mean - field theory for bec with the desired conserving gapless character.@xcite we here present a detailed description of the theory with several new results . as first shown by baym for normal fermi liquids@xcite and pointed out by hohenberg and martin for condensed bose systems,@xcite",
    "various conservation laws are automatically satisfied in the `` @xmath13 derivative approximations '' where the irreducible self - energy @xmath14 is obtained as a derivative of some functional @xmath15 $ ] with respect to the renormalized green s function @xmath1 .",
    "this relationship between @xmath14 and @xmath1 holds exactly for fermi systems in equilibrium , as shown by luttinger and ward.@xcite indeed , @xmath13 was first introduced by luttinger and ward as part of the exact thermodynamic functional @xmath16 $ ] .",
    "it was later taken up by baym@xcite to present a criterion for obtaining approximate dynamical equations with conservation laws .",
    "it thus follows that dynamical equations obtained from a luttinger - ward functional naturally obey the conservation laws .",
    "we hence ask the heuristic question here : can we construct a mean - field luttinger - ward thermodynamic functional for bec that also satisfies the hugenholtz - pines theorem ?",
    "this is indeed possible as will be shown below .",
    "the predictions of the resulting mean - field theory on the homogeneous weakly interacting bose gas will be presented later with an expression for @xmath17 ; this application hopefully will provide a deeper insight into the superfluidity and phase transition of still mysterious @xmath18he.@xcite it should be noted that the same idea has been adopted more recently by ivanov , riek , and knoll@xcite ( irk ) in a different context of the @xmath19 model to present an apparently different thermodynamic functional .",
    "it will be shown , however , that their functional yields exactly the same equilibrium thermodynamic properties on weakly interacting bose gases as the present one .",
    "we finally provide three comments on terminology to remove possible confusions in advance .",
    "first , gardiner@xcite and castin and dum@xcite have presented an alternative description of bec , which was called by gardiner@xcite as `` particle - number conserving bogoliubov method . ''",
    "however , his terminology is completely different from the present `` conserving '' and we call their formulations as `` number - fixed '' descriptions of bec . indeed , his terminology is connected more closely with the equilibrium thermodynamics to denote the fact that the particle number @xmath20 is chosen as an independent variable instead of the chemical potential @xmath21 .",
    "the two descriptions of using @xmath20 and @xmath21 are equivalent in the thermodynamic limit except the fluctuation in the particle number .",
    "it is worth pointing out that a `` number - fixed '' theory does not necessarily provide `` conserving '' dynamical equations in the present sense .",
    "second , the term `` gapless '' is relevant here to the single - particle excitation .",
    "indeed , the collective excitation has another story and is gapless even in the girardeau - arnowitt theory , as already shown by takano.@xcite third , it has been pointed out by yukalov@xcite that the word `` popov '' may not be suitable for the approximation of setting the anomalous pair amplitude equal to zero in the hfb theory .",
    "indeed , this approximation was introduced by shohno@xcite already in 1964 and used later by reatto and straley.@xcite we can also find the same approximation later in the work of baym and grinstein on the @xmath22 model.@xcite we will call it as the `` shohno '' approximation instead of `` popov '' following reatto and straley.@xcite    this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii presents a mean - field free - energy functional for general non - uniform systems and derives a closed set of equations to determine the thermodynamic equilibrium .",
