    "of all the diverse steps of the star formation process , the prestellar stage is supposed to be the most quiescent phase .",
    "starless cores are nearly isothermal , have more or less regular shapes , and lack prominent kinematic features , like disks and outflows . among those cores ,",
    "bok globules are especially attractive for studies , as they are relatively isolated from a confusing surrounding material and , thus , represent ` clean ' examples of the prestellar chemical and dynamical evolution . numerous embedded and isolated starless cores have been subjects of chemical and kinematical studies during recent years . as we generally want to know if these cores are going to become stars eventually or , in other words , if they are not only starless but really prestellar , these studies are mainly directed toward the search for infall signatures .",
    "a commonly used collapse indicator is the characteristic blue - red line asymmetry of optically thick lines @xcite .",
    "usually , the central spectrum of a core is utilized to demonstrate that this asymmetry is present .    however , if one wants to investigate the kinematics in more detail , it is necessary to observe and to analyze spectra at locations offset from the center of a core .",
    "1d spectral cuts or 2d spectral maps are employed in various ways .",
    "spectral maps for several molecules have allowed @xcite to detect an extended infall in the now famous l1544 prestellar core .",
    "this study has later been followed by @xcite , who have used n@xmath12h@xmath0 spectral maps to investigate the infall in the very center of the core .",
    "mapping surveys for infall motions in a number of starless cores have been carried out by @xcite in lines of hco@xmath0 and by @xcite in lines of cs , co , and n@xmath12h@xmath0 .",
    "another goal of investigating spectral maps is the study of rotation of starless cores , where both red and blue asymmetric line profiles are present .",
    "e.g. , @xcite have studied the rotation in fifteen starless bok globules based on co maps , while @xcite have used hco@xmath0 spectral maps , obtained by @xcite , to determine the average rotation speed ( as well as the shape and the infall speed ) for the l1544 core .",
    "@xcite assumed that the core collapses from the initial rigid rotation state so that its total angular momentum remains constant .",
    "the spatial separation of red and blue asymmetric hco@xmath0 line profiles in the maps of the l1689b prestellar core has been reproduced with a 3d molecular line radiation transfer model by @xcite .",
    "they showed that the asymmetry in this core can be explained under the assumption of solid - body rotation in the core center . at a later evolutionary stage ,",
    "the rotation and infall profiles for the very young protostar iram  04191 have been determined by @xcite from cs spectral maps .",
    "a more comprehensive analysis of spectral maps is also possible .",
    "@xcite interpreted the alternating asymmetry pattern in cs spectral lines observed in b68 as a signature of simultaneous inward and outward motions having both radial and non - radial modes . @xcite performed a similar study of the l1498 and 1517b prestellar cores . using n@xmath12h@xmath0 and nh@xmath13 spectral maps they investigated velocity gradients across the core faces and found them indicative of a velocity pattern more complicated than just infall or rotation .",
    "they suggested that this pattern is associated with asymmetric gas motions resulting from residual core collapse .",
    "these results indicate clearly that , given the overall quest for infall in starless cores , a great care must be taken to avoid confusion between infall and other bulk motions .",
    "they also stress that detailed kinematic information on starless cores is necessary to draw any conclusion about their dynamical and evolutionary state .",
    "the spectral maps are not the only ingredient needed for an analysis of the starless core kinematics . to serve this purpose they have to be complemented by some knowledge on the core chemical composition .",
    "the uniform abundances of tracer molecules over the core are now confidently rejected both on observational ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and theoretical @xcite grounds .",
    "it is now customary to reproduce observations with some simplified representation of a radial abundance profile ( like a step function , for example ) .",
    "however , @xcite showed that simple empirical distributions may not be good indicators of the real chemical structure in collapsing cores .",
    "but if they would be , these simple distributions do not contain information about the dynamical and chemical history of the core .",
    "@xcite argued that only multiple line - of - sight observations coupled to detailed chemical models are able to shed light on prestellar evolution .",
    "this is the approach we adopt here , utilizing detailed spectral maps in a number of transitions for the cb17 core .",
    "this core is located at the south - east edge of a small isolated , and slightly elongated globule at a distance of about 300  pc .",
    "several authors have studied its chemical composition , but the most extensive investigation has been performed by turner and co - authors @xcite . they argued that the chemical composition of this core is in many respects unusual , with overabundant hco@xmath0 , n@xmath12h@xmath0 , hc@xmath13n , and some other species . however , it must be noted that their study has been focused on small translucent clouds . when compared to other dense cores , the cb17 core shows typical column densities of n@xmath12h@xmath0 @xcite and ammonia @xcite .",
    "using molecular line maps , we study in this paper abundances of co , hco@xmath0 , and cs as a function of distance from the core center .",
    "we choose a detailed chemical model to compute the time - dependent abundances at a number of locations within the core , assuming its spherical symmetry .",
    "both static and dynamically evolving configurations are considered .",
    "these abundances are then used to simulate the spectral maps that are directly compared to the observed line profiles .    the attempt to reproduce the observed state of the core as an outcome of the time- and depth - dependent chemical model",
    "is hampered by the presence of many unknown or poorly known parameters . at first sight",
    ", it may seem they can be adjusted almost arbitrarily to get the best agreement with observations . however , this is not exactly the case when muliple lines of sight are analyzed .",
    "the most important parameters for the chemical model are the probability @xmath4 for species to stick to dust grains and the intensity @xmath14 of the uv  field that illuminates the core , as they control abundances in the inner and outer regions of a core , respectively .",
    "two remarks should be made about these parameters .",
    "first , the sticking probability @xmath4 represents an effective value which is valid as long as there are no desorption mechanisms other than those considered in the paper ( thermal desorption , cosmic ray desorption , photodesorption ) . in the case that some powerful evaporation mechanism is missing in the model",
    ", the best - fit @xmath4 value would be higher than that quoted in the abstract .",
    "second , rates of photoreactions can be different from the rates used in the model if the spectral properties of the uv field in the core vicinity differ significantly from the average interstellar field .",
    "we consider a range of these parameters and demostrate that their values can be significantly constrained if a comparison with observations is not limited to just a central spectrum .",
    "using a static model , we find the value of @xmath14 that allows to reproduce the observations most reasonably .",
    "this value is then used as an input for the dynamical model . instead of fixing a certain contraction law",
    ", we consider a range of _ ad hoc _ solutions to check if the dynamical history of a core leaves some observable imprint on its chemical structure and emergent line profiles . with the dynamical model we estimate the sticking probability , the age of the core , the infall velocity , and the rotation velocity . in particular",
    ", we show that the asymmetry of the line profiles can be used to relax the ambiguity between the sticking probability and the core age .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in   2 we describe the chemical model and the formalism that is used to simulate the core dynamical evolution .",
    "the radiation transfer model , the criterion for the comparison with observations , and the used observational data are also presented in   2 .",
    "results of the chemical modeling for the static core model are given in ",
    "the dynamical models with and without rotation are presented in   4 .",
    "our results are discussed in   5 and summarized in",
    "in general , we expect that the dynamical evolution of a prestellar core is related to its chemical evolution via the time - dependent density , extinction etc .",
    "thus , we want to address the question if simulations of the chemical evolution are a good tool to get insights into the dynamical history of the core . for that",
    ", we consider a model of a collapsing and rotating cloud , which provides us with the time - dependent density and velocity fields .",
    "this model is combined with an appropriate chemical model in order to find the representaion of the core that provides the best agreement with the observed spectral maps .",
    "a straightforward way is to parameterize the problem and then to use some criterion that quantifies the difference between the observed and theoretical spectra . given the large number of parameters , we split the problem in three parts .    in a first step ,",
    "we investigate the ` chemical ' parameters with a static configuration in which the core has zero regular velocity , and the density distribution stays constant with time and is equal to the observed current state ( see   [ statmod ] ) . ignoring the dynamical evolution ,",
    "this model represents a convenient way to study purely ` chemical ' factors which must be taken into account , when analyzing molecular line spectra .",
    "specifically , the static model is used to constrain the intensity @xmath14 of the uv field in the vicinity of the core .    in a second step ,",
    "the best - fit @xmath14 value is used in a 1d collapse model , in which a phenomenological way is adopted to describe a time - dependent density structure .",
    "this technique is by no means hydrodynamical in nature .",
    "however , it allows to probe a wider range of collapse regimes than more physical approaches taken by , e.g. , @xcite or @xcite . at this step",
    "we consider only the central spectrum as it is not affected by rotation .",
    "this analysis permits the selection of a collapse mode that is the best in reproducing the central line asymmetry .    in a third step ,",
    "the best - fit dynamical model is used as an input for the model with both collapse and rotation . with this model",
    "we determine the rotation velocity and the position angle .",
    "a flow chart of these steps is presented in figure  [ flchart ] .        in the following ,",
    "we describe both the static and non - static models in detail , together with the adopted models of the chemical evolution and the line radiation transfer .",
    "a criterion is presented that is used to compare modeled and observed spectral line maps . for this comparison ,",
    "we consider the optically thin transitions c@xmath2s(2 - 1 ) , h@xmath3co@xmath0(1 - 0 ) , and c@xmath1o(2 - 1 ) as well as the optically thick transitions cs(2 - 1 ) , hco@xmath0(1 - 0 ) , for which most complete spectral maps are available .",
    "as we have one transition per isotopomer , hereafter we omit the transition designation",
    ".    observations of various molecular emission lines towards cb17 for isotopes and transitions of co , cs , and hco@xmath0 were performed in june 1993 and october 1996 using the iram 30-m telescope",
    ". final calibration and data reduction were done with the class software , which is part of the gildas package . since different nominal center positions as well as @xmath15",
    "were used in different years , and some of the maps were done with a smaller spatial sampling for the central part of the dense core than for the outer regions , all spectra of a given line were combined and resampled on a regular spatial and frequency grid using a gaussian beam of hpbw and channel width listed in table  [ tbl-2 ] . the reference position ( 0,0 ) for all data and maps in this paper",
    "is ra=04:00:32.90 , dec=56:47:52.0 ( b1950 ) .",
    "these observations represent part of an extensive study of the cb17 core in many molecules and transitions which will be described in full detail in another paper ( launhardt et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    ".spectral line parameters at peak position ( -1,+8 ) [ tbl-2 ] [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     in general , all the modeled maps do reproduce the spatial distributions of line intensities , except the c@xmath1o(2 - 1 ) intensity , which is approximately 1.52 times greater than that observed .",
    "the c@xmath1o overabundance is present in the static model as well and seems to follow from the adopted relatively low @xmath4 value which is supposed to provide the best agreement for cs lines .",
    "upper panels in figure  [ chispfig ] indicate that regardless of uv intensity values @xmath16 are preferred from the point of view of the c@xmath1o abundance",
    ". some further adjustment of the co abundance can be made with a variation in the cosmic ray ionization rate . however , there is a more natural explanation . in our study",
    "we assume that the c@xmath17o / c@xmath1o ratio is constant and equal to 490 which is just the @xmath17o/@xmath1o ratio . due to the chemical fractionation the ratio c@xmath17o",
    "/ c@xmath1o can vary by a factor of a few @xcite .",
    "specifically , the isotope - selective photodestruction of co molecules may decrease the abundance of the isotopomer with the less abundant isotope @xcite .",
    "importantly , the fractionation apparently affects the c@xmath17o / c@xmath1o ratio stronger than the @xmath18co/@xmath3co ratio @xcite , which would explain why we have the intensity disagreement in the c@xmath1o lines , but not in the h@xmath3co@xmath0 lines .",
    "this paper represents an attempt to develop a technique that allows to get as much information as possible from the spectral maps of a starless core .",
    "the technique is outlined in figure  [ flchart ] . as an example",
    ", we used the cb17 core for which we have detailed observational data .",
    "this core appears to be quite young , having a chemical age of about 2  myr .",
    "it is tempting to put it into an evolutionary sequence with other starless cores . taking the central density as an indicator of the dynamical evolution , we have to assume that cb17 is quite evolved as it is almost as dense as l1544 . from the point of view of",
    "the central depletion cb17 appears to be less evolved .",
    "there is some depletion in its center , which is indicated by high sp values for models with @xmath19 . in best - fit static models ( e.g. , @xmath20  myr , @xmath21 )",
    "the co molecule is depleted by a factor of 40 in the core center , and the cs molecule is depleted by a similar factor",
    ". however , this depletion is not very obvious in the cs column density distribution and is not seen at all in the co column density distribution .",
    "this explains why the central holes are not seen in the observed maps of optically thin transitions of c@xmath2s and c@xmath1o . within the classification scheme suggested by @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "the cb17 core is _ evolved dynamically _ and _ moderately evolved chemically_.    within the framework of the adopted dynamical formalism we notice that ages greater than @xmath22  myr and infall speeds of the order of 0.05  km s@xmath6 are required .",
    "this implies @xmath23 ( the kinematic difference between the considered @xmath24 values of 0.5 , 1.0 , and 1.5 is less significant ) . in this collapse",
    "regime the central density first stays almost constant and then undergoes a stage of a very fast growth .",
    "this conclusion is further illustrated by the comparison of the derived chemical age , @xmath25  myrs , to the cb17 free - fall timescale , @xmath26 .",
    "for the assumed initial density of @xmath27h@xmath28  @xmath29 , @xmath30  myrs which is five times smaller than @xmath31 .",
    "so , formally we can conclude that the core has evolved more or less quasi - statically for @xmath32 years , then quickly lost stability and started to collapse .",
    "it seems reasonable just from mass conservation considerations that this is the appropriate scenario for a dense , collapsing , and chemically mature core .",
    "the scenario is similar to that favored by @xcite and considered by @xcite .",
    "the quasi - static evolution of the starless core can result from the magnetic field support being gradually lost due to the ambipolar diffusion . on",
    "the other hand , @xcite and @xcite showed that quasi - static evolution of prestellar cores can be explained by the assumption that the initial condition for contraction represent a destabilized bonnor - ebert sphere .",
    "the estimated cb17 age of 2  myr may have implications for current theories of the star formation .",
    "for example , it is greater than the typical lifetime of dense cores found in gravoturbulent simulations @xcite and the observationally estimated lifetimes of submillimeter cores studied by @xcite .",
    "so , one may ask how solid this estimate is . it must be noted from the static model that even if the core has spent the entire lifetime at constant central density of @xmath27h@xmath33  @xmath29 , its chemical age is not less than 1  myr . to make a more sounded estimate , which takes into account the density variations",
    ", we need to rely on our dynamical models .",
    "it is seen from table  [ tabdynpar ] that , based on sp(c@xmath2s ) values , we can put `` error bars '' to the age estimate , so that it is @xmath34  myr .",
    "but it must be kept in mind that this estimate is dependent on the adopted initial conditions .",
    "therefore , it is of vital importance to constrain these conditions via models of the very early stages of prestellar core formation and evolution .",
    "also , the dynamical history of cb17 can be refined with the same analysis applied to a more complicated dynamical model , which we plan to do in a forthcoming study .",
    "alternating asymmetry pattern in the cb17 core , i.e. , changing blue - to - red asymmetry of optically thick lines and shifts of optically thin lines , indicate that the cb17 core rotates with an estimated azimuthal velocity of about 0.1  km s@xmath6 .",
    "more precisely , the model core rotates differentially with a maximum rotation velocity of 0.13 km s@xmath6 at 7000  au from the core center .",
    "the corresponding angular momentum of the core can be estimated as @xmath35 because of our assumption that the core is observed edge - on , this is the minimum angular momentum the core can have .",
    "its value corresponds to the specific angular momentum of @xmath36  @xmath37 s@xmath6 , which is too high for a single star and somewhat higher that a corresponding value for a star with a disk ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , it is close to specific angular momenta of binary t tau stars @xcite .",
    "so , it seems that cb17 is going to fragment into at least two prestellar cores .",
    "a possible drawback in using phenomenological descriptions is the possibility that the resulting model may be characterized by a combination of parameters that are mutually incompatible , like infall in a model where the thermal pressure exceeds the gravitational pressure . in order to check",
    "if our best - fit 2d model ( table  [ tabdynrotpar ] ) is physically consistent , we computed the gravitational force , the centrifugal force , and the pressure gradient as functions of radius .",
    "the analysis confirms our conclusion that the core is marginally gravitationally unstable as the gravitational force exceeds ( in absolute value ) the sum of forces , which counteract the collapse , by about 50% . in the inner part of the core",
    "the critical rotation velocity that would provide enough centrifugal support against collapse is only slightly higher that the velocity inferred from our study .",
    "this agrees with the very low infall velocity and demonstrates that in the inner parts of prestellar cores the rotation can be an important factor of core dynamics .",
    "the derived kinematic structure of the cb17 core corresponds to energy ratios @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 .",
    "our conclusions are affected to a certain degree by the choice of the probe molecules .",
    "all the lines we consider actually trace more the envelope of the core than its central region .",
    "even optically thin lines of c@xmath1o , h@xmath3co@xmath0 , and c@xmath2s are not good probes of the very center of the core because these species are depleted there",
    ". deuterated and n - bearing species are more promising tracers of the inner core ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "inspection of our chemical results shows that cyanopolyynes are especially sensitive not only to the age of an object , but also to the collapse regime .",
    "however , the analysis of cyanopolyyne lines with the proposed technique is not straightforward , as it requires a more complicated approach to the radiation transfer modeling .",
    "another possible limitation of our model is the neglect of uv heating .",
    "cb17 and other similar globules are often cometary shaped , suggestive of some outflow from the heated surface .",
    "thus , uv irradiation affects not only the chemical , but also the thermal and the kinematic structure of the core .",
    "this is a promising topic for a more sophisticated dynamical model .    in this paper",
    ", we applied the ` global ' sp criterion , which provides an estimate for the overall agreement between theoretical and observed spectra . however , as mentioned earlier , there are different features of real spectra that can be analyzed separately .",
    "for example , the depth of the self - absorption dip of optically thick lines is a good indicator of the uv field strength , while a good measure of the core rotation is given by relative shifts of optically thin lines . in the latter case",
    "the right thing to do is to compare the line center positions and not the overall profile shapes .",
    "the optically thin line intensities are sensitive to the molecule column density , the blue - red asymmetry depends on the infall speed , and so forth . in this sense",
    "the global criterion is not the best choice as it has equally bad ( large ) values for a line which is wider than the observed one ( easily adjusted with @xmath38 ; non - critical ) as well as for a line which is shifted relative to the observed one ( indicative of the wrong rotation model and/or the @xmath39 velocity ; critical ) . on the other hand ,",
    "when applied with care , a sp - type criterion provides a useful global error control .",
    "the global criterion is a good starting point and must be refined in a later analysis . on the other hand ,",
    "sometimes it can be complemented with more refined criteria that allow to study certain aspect of the model in detail or just to save the computational effort .",
    "in this paper , we present a chemo - dynamical pilot study of the isolated bok globule cb17 ( l1389 ) based on the spectral maps of cs(2 - 1 ) , c@xmath2s(2 - 1 ) , hco@xmath0(1 - 0 ) , h@xmath3co@xmath0(1 - 0 ) , and c@xmath1o(2 - 1 ) lines . a phenomenological model of a prestellar core evolution combined with time - dependent chemistry and a radiative transfer simulation of molecular lines",
    "is used to reconstruct the chemical and kinematical structure of this core as well as to study the influence of various physical factors on molecular line profiles .",
    "the main conclusions of the paper are :    1 .   we present a promising approach that allows to derive the chemical and kinematic structure of a prestellar core from its spectral maps .",
    "we analyze both optically thick and optically thin lines , center and off - center positions , various species and transitions etc .",
    "we show that even when this detailed information is available , it is not trivial to construct a consistent core model .",
    "2 .   among the considered molecules , cs and its isotopomer c@xmath2s turned out to be most sensitive species to variations in model parameters and can be used to reconstruct the dynamical history of prestellar cores .",
    "as the effects of the age and sticking probability ( @xmath4 ) are quite similar for this molecule , it is desirable to have more qualitative information on the @xmath4 value .",
    "uv irradiation is an important factor affecting the chemistry and , correspondingly , line profiles in prestellar cores even when the strength of uv field is much smaller than the average interstellar value . the attenuated uv field ( @xmath40 )",
    "is needed to explain distributions of intensities and self - absorption features of the observed cb17 spectral maps .",
    "optically thick lines tracing the envelope are mostly sensitive to the uv field .",
    "the chemical age of the core is about 2  myr .",
    "all the considered species ( co , hco@xmath0 , and cs ) are depleted in the inner core , but the degree of depletion is still not high enough to show up in the integrated intensity maps .",
    "this allows to classify this core as evolved dynamically and moderately evolved chemically .",
    "the best - fit sticking probability value for the core is @xmath41 .",
    "this is an effective value that may be higher if we miss some important desorption mechanism .",
    "5 .   the changing asymmetry pattern of the optically thick line profiles over the cloud surface as well as shifts of the optically thin lines are both indicative of a complex kinematical structure of the core .",
    "we argue that the observed maps are reasonably well reproduced by a model with slow infall ( 0.05 km s@xmath6 ) , differential rotation ( 0.1 km s@xmath6 ) , and microturbulence ( 0.1 km s@xmath6 ) . from the derived angular momentum ,",
    "we conclude that cb17 is likely to fragment and to form a binary ( multiple ) star .",
    "6 .   while being artificial in nature , our phenomenological approach allows to reveal crucial parameters that must be considered in attempts to compare observations with results of more sophisticated physical models based on combined mhd , chemical and radiative transfer simulations .",
