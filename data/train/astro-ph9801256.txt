    "the global value of the hubble constant @xmath0 is determined by investigating a hubble flow of a large number of galaxies distributed in a volume larger than the scale of inhomogeneous galaxy distribution in the universe ( @xmath7mpc , @xmath8kms@xmath2mpc@xmath2 ) .",
    "ichikawa & fukugita ( 1992 , hereafter if92 ) determined the global @xmath0 by applying the tully - fisher ( tf ) relation ( tully & fisher 1977 ) to the arecibo hi 21 cm sample ( @xcite ) .",
    "the sample extends in the area of 950 square - degrees in the region of pisces - perseus ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) and includes all the field and cluster galaxies complete down to @xmath11mag originated from cgcg ( zwicky et al .",
    "1961 - 68 ) .",
    "because of the large area and the deep limiting magnitude , the sample if92 used contains about 400 spirals at @xmath1kms@xmath2 .",
    "this large sample enabled them to examine an effect of biases in the tf analysis .    in this paper",
    ", we re - determine @xmath0 using the arecibo hi sample .",
    "the differences from the study of if92 are as follows .",
    "first , the imaging data were extracted from our photographic plate material via modern image reduction techniques .",
    "if92 used magnitudes and axial ratios which were transformed into a homogeneous system of rc2 ( de vaucouleurs , de vaucouleurs & corwin 1976 ) from cgcg , ugc ( nilson 1973 ) , and the arecibo catalog .",
    "second , we use a new set of local calibrators for tf calibration .",
    "their distances are all calibrated with cepheid observations .",
    "third , our tf analysis uses a technique of maximum likelihood method .",
    "fourth , our tf analysis is also applied to @xmath4-band ccd data of `` w91pp '' in the mark iii  catalog ( willick et al .",
    "the sample was originated from ugc and hence complete down to @xmath12mag , shallower than ours by 1mag .",
    "nevertheless , the data allow us to carry out a useful comparison with our result because the @xmath4-band tf relation is tighter than that of @xmath5-band . finally , we discuss , based on our result of the global @xmath0 , the bulk motion of galaxies in the region which has been studies by many authors ( willick 1990 , han and mould 1992 , courteau et al .",
    "1993 , hudson et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "our adoption of photographic data may deserve a comment .",
    "motivation of the present study is to determine @xmath0 in the pisces - perseus  region where a bulk motion of galaxies has been attracted much attention ( willick 1991 ; han and mould 1992 ; courteau et al .",
    "1993 ; hudson et al .",
    "the bulk motion has been usually computed using relative distances of galaxies with respect to a reference point of the hubble flow . in this procedure , the motion is derived independently from @xmath0 . in this paper , on the other hand , we attempt to determine the global @xmath0 and then discuss the bulk flow using the absolute value of @xmath0 .    to achieve the goal of our study",
    ", our galaxy sample should fulfill three conditions .",
    "first , it should be large in terms of the spatial volume so that the global @xmath0 is determined unaffected by the bulk flow .",
    "the volume is required to be larger than the coherent scale of the flow ( @xmath13kms@xmath2 ) .",
    "second , our sample should be also large in terms of the number of galaxies and should not be sparse so that we can evaluate the effect of a bias correctly .",
    "third , it is of course highly desired that photometry data are homogeneous so as to eliminate systematic errors which creep in a data set taken from different compilations . considering these conditions , we carried out photographic observations and obtained homogeneous photometry data for the pisces - perseus  region .",
    "the galaxy sample is a magnitude limited one containing all the cgcg / ugc galaxies , and is distributed up to @xmath14kms@xmath2 .",
    "the sample is therefore larger than a pisces - perseus  field sample `` w91pp '' in the mark iii  catalog ( willick et al .",
    "1997 ) . a recent study of @xmath0 by giovanelli et al . ( 1997a ) covered the entire sky using 24 clusters .",
    "although the pisces - perseus  region was included in their research , their sample in the region is limited to five clusters including about 150 galaxies .",
    "further , the accuracy of our photographic photometry is as good as 0.13mag ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is worth stressing that careful photographic photometry do achieve 0.1 - 0.2mag accuracy ( e.g. , kodaira et al .",
    "1990 ; yasuda , okamura and fukugita 1995 ) .",
    "thus , our photographic observations offer the photometry data which are most suitable for our study .",
    "outline of this paper is as follows .",
    "the data used for the present analysis are described in  [ sec : data ] .",
    "the maximum - likelihood method of the tf analysis is presented in  [ sec : a new method of the analysis ] .",
    "calibration of the tf relation is given in ",
    "[ sec : the tully - fisher relation ] .",
    "reliability of the present method is examined by monte - carlo simulations in  [ sec : monte - carlo simulations ] .",
    "the method is applied to our @xmath5-band sample and the unbiased estimate of the global @xmath0 is determined in  [ sec : result ] .",

    "[ sec : analysis with willick s r - band sample ] .",
    "we discuss the present result in  [ sec : discussions ] .",
    "observations and data reduction are briefly described here .",
    "details will be given in a forthcoming paper .",
    "photographic observations of the region of pisces - perseus(@xmath9 and @xmath10 ) were carried out in @xmath5 ( kodak iia - o emulsion plus schott gg385 glass filter ) using the 105 cm schmidt telescope at the kiso observatory , the university of tokyo .",
    "most of the observations were conducted in 1991 and in 1992 and we obtained thirty - eight plates .",
    "we measured and reduced all the 1524 cgcg and ugc galaxies in the region .",
    "these 1524 galaxies are referred to as the photometry sample .",
    "the galaxies were scanned with a pds2020 microdensitometer at the kiso observatory .",
    "we then reduced the images in a conventional manner for schmidt plate data ( e.g. , kodaira et al . 1990 ) using the software packages iraf and spiral ( ichikawa et al .",
    "1987 ; hamabe and ichikawa 1991 ) .",
    "ccd observations were also carried out in @xmath5 and in @xmath15 for seventy spirals selected from the photometry sample to calibrate the photographic data .",
    "the ccd data were calibrated with photometric standard stars ( landolt 1992 ) of various colors observed at various zenith distances to correct atmospheric extinction and to transform our photographic @xmath5-band system to the johnson s . for seven plates where no ccd observation was available ,",
    "the flux calibration was made with photoelectric aperture photometry data of longo and de vaucouleurs ( 1983 ) .",
    "the flux calibration of the photographic data using the ccd and the photoelectric aperture photometry data followed the conventional method of kodaira et al .",
    "aperture magnitudes were measured with a series of concentric circular apertures throughout the present study .",
    "total magnitudes @xmath16 were obtained by a sliding fit of aperture - magnitude curve ( hereafter a growth curve ) to their templates given in rc3 ( de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "isophotal magnitudes @xmath17 and major - to - minor axial ratios @xmath18 were measured at the isophote of 25magarcsec@xmath19 in the surface brightness .",
    "internal errors were 0.13mag for @xmath16 and 0.06dex for @xmath20 ( @xcite ) .",
    "spiral galaxies are selected from the photometry sample and used for the present tf analysis .",
    "the procedure of the selection is described in  [ sec : data sample selection ] .",
    "we examine external consistency by comparing our data with those in rc3 ( n=79 ) and cornell et al .",
    "( 1987 ) ( n=8 ) .",
    "all overlapping systems were rejected from the comparisons .",
    "we find possible errors in @xmath16 of rc3 for pgc5473 ( cgcg502 - 87 , ugc1045 ) and in @xmath16 of rc3 and in @xmath17 of cornell et al .",
    "( 1987 ) for pgc3133 ( watanabe 1996 ) .",
    "these galaxies are further rejected .",
    "the comparisons are presented in fig.[fig : btrc3_vs_bt ] and fig.[fig : b25cornell_vs_b25 ] . from a regression analysis for rc3 data ,",
    "we obtain @xmath21mag ( @xmath22mag ) and @xmath23 ( @xmath24dex ) .",
    "if we assume that the half of @xmath22mag is ascribed to the error in rc3 , our @xmath16 is supposed to be as accurate as @xmath25mag .",
    "this is compatible with our internal error of 0.13mag for @xmath16 .",
    "rms errors of @xmath16 between rc3 data and ours are 0.17mag ( n=46 ) for galaxies calibrated with our ccd observation while 0.14mag ( n=32 ) for those calibrated with the aperture photometry data by longo and de vaucouleurs ( 1983 ) . the difference between these two values is insignificant , and we do not think the calibration by the aperture photometry data is poorer than that by the ccd data . a regression analysis for cornell s data leads to @xmath26mag ( @xmath27mag ) and @xmath28 ( @xmath29dex ) .",
    "these good agreements with their ccd data demonstrate reliability of our photographic photometry data .",
    "hi 21 cm data are taken from the arecibo hi catalog ( @xcite ) , where line - profile widths are defined at the 50% level of the line mean intensity .",
    "the line widths @xmath30 and heliocentric recession velocities @xmath31 both have an accuracy of about @xmath32kms@xmath2 .    in earlier tf calibration",
    ", the 21 cm line - profile width has been defined with two schemes .",
    "one refers to the width @xmath30 as used in the arecibo catalog , while the other adopted a width @xmath33 measured at the 20% level of the line peak intensity .",
    "we adopt the latter definition @xmath33 because most of the earlier tf calibrations have been made with this scheme ( e.g. , aaronson et al .",
    "1986 , bottinelli et al .",
    "1987 , pierce and tully 1988 , willick 1990 , pierce & tully 1992 , if92 ) . adopting this schemes allows us to compare our tf calibration easily with those of the previous studies .",
    "we convert @xmath30 to @xmath33 using an empirical formula given by willick ( 1991 ) ;    @xmath34    the relation has a dispersion of @xmath35dex . the uncertainty caused by this dispersion is less than 0.1mag which is negligible",
    "compared with the intrinsic dispersion of the tf relation , @xmath36mag .",
    "we determine the global @xmath0 with reference to a rest frame of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation .",
    "the heliocentric velocity @xmath31 is accordingly transformed to @xmath37 measured in the frame using cmb dipole anisotropy attributed to the solar motion of @xmath38kms@xmath2toward @xmath39 relative to the cmb radiation field ( smoot et al .",
    "let @xmath40 and @xmath41 be the galactic longitude and latitude of a particular galaxy .",
    "then , the transformation is expressed as @xmath42 where @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 , respectively .",
    "the arecibo catalog mainly refers to ugc for galaxy morphological types . for galaxies for which the type was not available in ugc , authors of the arecibo catalog determined the type from visual inspection of galaxy images on palomar schmidt plates or on palomar sky survey prints .",
    "we take their morphological type with a notation @xmath46 .        the observed magnitude @xmath16 is corrected for galactic and internal extinction and k - dimming .",
    "the galactic extinction @xmath47 is taken from a machine - readable extinction map made by david burstein ( hereafter referred to as bh ) .",
    "the internal extinction @xmath48 and the k - dimming @xmath49 are both evaluated following a prescription given in rc3",
    ". corrected magnitude @xmath50 is then given by @xmath51 .",
    "there are various schemes used for evaluation of @xmath47 ( e.g. , bh , rc2 , rsa [ sandage and tammann 1981 ] ) and @xmath48 ( e.g. , rc3 , rc2 , rsa , bothun et al . [ 1985 ] ) .",
    "systematic offset among these different schemes will be taken into account as a source of an error for @xmath0([sec : result global value ] ) .",
    "the line - profile width @xmath33 is corrected for a projection and a cosmological broadening effects with    @xmath52    where inclination @xmath53 of a spiral is estimated from @xmath18 via a formula    @xmath54    dependence of the intrinsic major - to - minor axial ratio @xmath55 on a galaxy type was investigated by some authors ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "we find that adopting a low value of @xmath58 or introducing its type dependence results in an insignificant change in @xmath0 by @xmath59kms@xmath2mpc@xmath2  in our analysis .",
    "giovanelli et al .",
    "( 1997b ) proposed a different formula for the correction of the line - profile width @xmath60 .",
    "a similar formula could be worked out for @xmath61 .",
    "however , we did not pursue this way .",
    "the ratio of their observed width w to the corrected width @xmath62 is almost constant ; the mean of @xmath63 is 1.07 with a scatter of only 0.07 .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that the ratio would be nearly constant in case such a revision is made for @xmath61 .",
    "further , such a revision would change @xmath61 of local calibrators as well as sample galaxies .",
    "then , the effect of such a revision is likely to be canceled out .",
    "we select sample galaxies for our tf analysis according to selection criteria as follows ; 1 ) morphological type sa - sd , i.e. , @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "this criterion is adopted to exclude s0 and very late - type spirals unsuitable for the tf analysis .",
    "galaxies classified to @xmath66 are all regarded as sb in the present analysis .",
    "2 ) inclination @xmath67 . for galaxies with @xmath68 , an uncertainty of the tf magnitude caused by an error of @xmath69 ( watanabe 1996 ) combined with a slope of 6.14 for our tf calibration (  [ sec : the tully - fisher relation calibration ] ) exceeds 0.4mag , which is no more negligible compared with the intrinsic dispersion of the tf relation .",
    "3 ) recession velocity @xmath70kms@xmath2 .",
    "this criterion is adopted to avoid disturbance by a local peculiar velocity field with amplitude of several hundreds kms@xmath2 .",

    "[ sec : the tully - fisher relation calibration ] , the lower and the upper boundaries are originated from the range of @xmath72 for the local calibrators we adopted .",
    "these criteria reduced the photometry sample to 449 galaxies ( table [ tbl : sample selection for the tf analysis ] ) .",
    "these are hereafter referred to as the spiral sample .",
    "the tf analysis is carried out using 441 galaxies among them (  [ sec : result ] ) .",
    "the eight galaxies are discarded from the analysis because of their large deviation in the tf magnitude ; this is discussed in  [ sec : the tully - fisher relation consistency between the local calibrators and the tf sample ] . a wedge diagram for the spiral sample",
    "is shown in fig.[fig : cz_plot_449 ] , which illustrates that the sample covers a spatial volume up to @xmath73kms@xmath2 .",

    "the number ratio of the spiral sample to the photometry sample is almost constant over @xmath74mag .",
    "the spiral sample is therefore supposed to be a fair subset of the photometry sample .",
    "if we obtain a tf distance @xmath75 using @xmath50 and a tf magnitude @xmath76 as @xmath77 , the most straightforward estimate of @xmath0 may be a ratio @xmath78 .",
    "we hereafter call it as the hubble ratio . for our spiral sample , however , a sample average of the hubble ratios is not a correct estimate of the true global @xmath0 .",
    "it is subject to a systematic error because the sample galaxies are biased toward intrinsically bright ones .",
    "this bias is originated from the facts that the intrinsic dispersion @xmath79 of the tf relation is non - zero and that the spiral sample is a magnitude - limited sample .",
    "consequently , a systematic error occurs in the sample average of the hubble ratio . in this paper",
    ", we refer to this bias as a _ sampling incompleteness _ bias .",
    "we also take the _ malmquist _ bias ( malmquist 1922 ) into account in the present analysis .",
    "the malmquist bias is caused by a non - zero intrinsic dispersion of the tf relation combined with a conical shape of an observed volume for a unit solid angle .",
    "a detailed review for the two biases is found in strauss and willick ( 1995 ) .",
    "note that an error caused by the malmquist bias is independent of a limiting magnitude , while an error caused by the sampling incompleteness bias depends basically on the limiting magnitude .    to determine a global @xmath0 which is not affected by such systematic errors",
    ", we use a maximum likelihood method in the tf analysis .",
    "a similar technique was used by han and mould ( 1990 ) for an analysis of a local supercluster velocity field .",
    "the likelihood function is computed using a probability distribution of @xmath61 rather than @xmath16 since it is less affected by the sample incompleteness ( e.g. , schechter 1980 ; freudling et al .",
    "1995 , and references therein ) .",
    "this is equivalent to the `` inverse method '' discussed by strauss and willick ( 1995 ) .",
    "let us consider a probability @xmath80 that the @xmath53-th spiral galaxy has a line - profile width @xmath81 under the condition that it has a true absolute magnitude @xmath82 , an inclination @xmath83 , and a redshift @xmath84 .",
    "note that @xmath82 is an unknown parameter .",
    "an intrinsic line - profile width @xmath85 is obtained from @xmath81 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 with equations ( [ eqn : w0 calculation ] ) and ( [ eqn : r to sini ] ) .",
    "a tf magnitude @xmath86 corresponding to @xmath85 is then obtained by the tf relation ,    @xmath87    on the other hand , the hubble s law gives an estimate for @xmath82 , i.e. ,    @xmath88    where @xmath89 is given in unit of kms@xmath2 .",
    "the additional term @xmath90 is a correction for a systematic error caused by the malmquist bias .",
    "if galaxies are uniformly distributed in space , the systematic error is @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is a random distance error expressed in term of a distance modulus . in the present analysis , the measure of the distance",
    "is @xmath37 ( equation ( [ eqn : mabs_de ] ) ) .",
    "accordingly , the random distance error comes from a random error @xmath93 , which is evaluated as a square root of a quadratic sum of a line - of - sight component of a random peculiar velocity of galaxies @xmath94 and an observational error of the recession velocity @xmath95 ,    @xmath96^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\ , .",

    "( 1993 ) and mathewson and ford ( 1994 ) , but they managed to circumvent the effect by comparing the peculiar velocity with that of a control field . as we have no such control data , we simply restrict ourselves to the range of @xmath248kms@xmath2  for the current discussion on the peculiar motion .    in the @xmath5-band ( @xmath214kms@xmath2mpc@xmath2 ) we find a mean negative bulk flow of @xmath249kms@xmath2 , while a flow with a smaller amplitude @xmath250kms@xmath2  is obtained in @xmath4 ( @xmath251kms@xmath2mpc@xmath2 ) .",
    "if we change @xmath37 of each galaxies in @xmath248kms@xmath2  to @xmath252 and then re - calculate @xmath0 , we obtain @xmath253kms@xmath2mpc@xmath2 .",
    "this value is significantly larger than @xmath214kms@xmath2mpc@xmath2 .",
    "this naive correction of @xmath37 for @xmath254 is probably invalid , however , since it substantially reduces the likelihood .",
    "the ratio of the likelihood for @xmath214kms@xmath2mpc@xmath2to that for @xmath253kms@xmath2mpc@xmath2  is @xmath255 , which indicates less than 0.001% probability for the corrected @xmath37 being well fitted with the hubble flow . a 95% probability interval of @xmath254 inferred from the likelihood ratio is @xmath256kms@xmath2 , each of the boundary corresponding to @xmath183 and @xmath257kms@xmath2mpc@xmath2 , respectively .",
    "the inconsistency between the 95% probability interval and @xmath258kms@xmath2may be caused by the large uncertainty of the @xmath5-band tf distances due to a large @xmath179 .",
    "it also implies that the current @xmath5-band tf analysis is not suitable for deducing accurate peculiar motions for individual galaxies .    in @xmath4-band ,",
    "on the other hand , correction of @xmath37 for @xmath259kms@xmath2  leads to @xmath198kms@xmath2mpc@xmath2  which is not significantly different from @xmath251kms@xmath2mpc@xmath2 .",
    "further , a 95% probability interval of @xmath260 inferred from the likelihood ratio is @xmath261kms@xmath2 , which is consistent with the mean negative bulk flow @xmath259kms@xmath2 .",
    "boundaries of the 95% probability interval of @xmath260 corresponds to @xmath183 and @xmath262kms@xmath2mpc@xmath2 , respectively .",
    "this consistent result is convincing for the existence of the negative bulk flow .",
    "the range of @xmath263 is consistent with those of the earlier results ( table.[tbl : comparison ] ) .",
    "we consider that the @xmath4-band tf analysis for the peculiar motions seems more reliable than that in @xmath5-band .",
    "our result @xmath264kms@xmath2mpc@xmath2  is also consistent with negative bulk flows which were obtained in the previous studies _ independently from an absolute value of @xmath0_.",
    "we perform an unbiased estimate of the global @xmath0 using a tf relation with a maximum likelihood method .",
    "we use a homogeneous , magnitude - limited sample of 441 galaxies ( @xmath265mag ) distributed up to @xmath14kms@xmath2  in the pisces - perseus  region .",
    "the reliability of the method was examined by the monte - carlo simulation , and it was shown that the method works satisfactorily in deriving an unbiased @xmath0 for the present sample .",
    "the results of the present analysis are summarized as follows .    1 .",
    "we obtain @xmath266kms@xmath2mpc@xmath2  for the unbiased estimate of the global value of the hubble constant .",
    "the first and second error terms represent the internal and external errors , respectively .",
    "all the known sources of systematic errors are taken into account in the estimate of the external error . the same analysis with the @xmath4-band tf sample of 271 galaxies",
    "gives @xmath267kms@xmath2mpc@xmath2 , which is consistent with @xmath268 .",
    "these @xmath0 s are in good agreement with if92 if we allow for the difference of the tf calibration .",
    "we also find a good agreement for these @xmath0 s with those obtained via cepheid observations for local universe ( freedman 1998 ) , the tully - fisher relation ( giovanelli et al .",
    "1997a ) and supernovae ( riess , press and kirshner 1995 , hamuy et al .",
    "1996 ) applied to a spatial volume larger than @xmath269kms@xmath2 .",
    "2 .   a bulk motion in the pisces - perseus  region",
    "is briefly investigated using our @xmath0 .",
    "analysis of the @xmath4-band data compiled by willick et al .",
    "( 1997 ) gives a negative motion of @xmath270kms@xmath2  between the range @xmath248kms@xmath2 .",
    "the amplitude of @xmath263 is consistent with the 95% probability interval @xmath261kms@xmath2  inferred from the likelihood ratio .",
    "the interval is consistent with the bulk flows obtained by willick ( 1990 ) , han and mould ( 1992 ) , courteau et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , and hudson et al .",
    "analysis of the @xmath5-band data does not give a meaningful result because of a larger intrinsic dispersion of the tf relation .",

    "<S> the tully - fisher ( tf ) relation is applied to a magnitude - limited sample of 441 spirals selected from the arecibo 21 cm catalog . </S>",
    "<S> we improve the photometry data of the previous tf study by ichikawa and fukugita ( 1992 ) by using our original surface photometry data and local calibrators which are newly made available in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> the photometry data were calibrated with ccd observations and we achieve 0.13mag for a photometric internal error . </S>",
    "<S> we use a maximum likelihood method for the tf analysis . </S>",
    "<S> monte - carlo simulations demonstrate that our method reproduces a given @xmath0 at the 95% confidence level . by applying the method to our sample galaxies , </S>",
    "<S> we obtain the unbiased global hubble constant @xmath3kms@xmath2mpc@xmath2  ; the first and the second terms represent the internal random error and the external uppermost and lowermost systematic errors , respectively . we also find a good agreement for our @xmath0 with those recently obtained via cepheid observation in the local universe and the tf relation and supernovae applied to a spatial volume comparable with or larger than ours . </S>",
    "<S> hubble velocities of the spirals inferred from our @xmath0 show no significant systematic difference from those given in the mark iiicatalog . the same analysis for @xmath0 </S>",

    "<S> we obtain a global @xmath0 which is consistent with that obtained from the @xmath5-band analysis . </S>",
    "<S> a bulk motion in the pisces - perseus region is briefly discussed , based on our calibration of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath5-band intrinsic tf scatter is too large to allow any determination of bulk motion . </S>",
    "<S> however , our @xmath4-band tf analysis supports the notion of a coherent streaming motion of the pisces - perseus ridge with @xmath6kms@xmath2   with respect to the cmb , in agreement with most modern studies .    </S>",
