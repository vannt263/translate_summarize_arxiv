    "as an alternative to the partial wave ( pw ) decomposition a so called three - dimensional ( 3d ) technique has been developed for the nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) system .",
    "it has been successfully applied to nn scattering and the deuteron in refs .   and , respectively for the bonn - b@xcite and the av18@xcite realistic potential models . the basic idea in 3d approach",
    "is to take the momentum states , as part of the basis states , without expanding them into the angular momentum states .",
    "thus , all angular momentum states are taken into account .",
    "it is then very important especially for higher energy region , while in pw calculations adding more higher angular momentum states may at some point become not feasible , for instance , due to restriction on computer resources . for lower energy regions still the 3d technique appears as a good alternative .",
    "in this work we derived a 3d formulation for scattering of spin-@xmath0 and spin-@xmath1 particles . the work will then be very useful , for example , for kaon - nucleon ( kn ) investigation .",
    "the formulation described in section  [ formulation ] is simpler than that for nn scattering , since our system consists of a pair of nonidentical particles with the total spin being @xmath0 .",
    "there is no antisymmetrizing like in ref .  .",
    "finally by means of symmetry relations we get only a single lippmann - schwinger equation . in section  [ example ]",
    "we show some calculations for a simple spin - orbit interaction based on the malfliet - tjon@xcite potential .",
    "we summarize in section  [ summary ] .",
    "the momentum - helicity basis states are eigenstates to the parity operator @xmath2 and the helicity operator @xmath3 , and are defined as @xmath4 with @xmath5 @xmath6 the relative momentum , @xmath7 and @xmath8 the helicity eigenstate and eigenvalue for spin @xmath0 , @xmath9 the parity eigenvalue , the subscript @xmath10 the parity eigenstate label .",
    "the momentum - helicity basis states in eq .",
    "( [ mhbs ] ) has the normalization as @xmath11\\ ] ] and the completeness relation as @xmath12      the potential @xmath13 matrix elements and the t - matrix elements in the momentum - helicity basis are defined as @xmath14 the potential matrix elements obey the following symmetry relations : @xmath15 and similarly the t - matrix elements . since the basis states are eigenstates to the helicity operator , it would be convenient if the potential in momentum representation is expressed , in general , as @xmath16 where @xmath17 are spin - independent functions .",
    "any spin - dependent potential can be expressed in the form given in eq .",
    "( [ genpot ] ) .",
    "it follows that for @xmath18 the azimuthal dependence of the potential matrix elements can be separated as @xmath19 the relation in eq .",
    "( [ azimuth ] ) applies also to @xmath20 .",
    "the symmetry relations in eqs .",
    "( [ stme1 ] ) & ( [ stme2 ] ) together with the relation in eq .",
    "( [ azimuth ] ) , all for both the potential and the t - matrix elements , lead to the following uncoupled integral equation : @xmath21 which we just call the lippmann - schwinger ( ls ) equation for @xmath22 , with @xmath23 being the reduced mass of the system and @xmath24    for @xmath22 there are symmetry relations given as @xmath25 these symmetry relations in ( [ symt1 ] ) , ( [ symt2 ] ) , ( [ symt3 ] ) reduce the number of equations to be solved . for each parity state",
    "we need to solve the ls equation given in eq .",
    "( [ lse ] ) only for , say , @xmath26 .",
    "we show here just as an example some calculations for a simple spin - orbit potential given as @xmath27 with @xmath28 being the angular momentum operator , @xmath29 , the radial functions @xmath30 and @xmath31 of the type of the malfliet - tjon@xcite potential : @xmath32 @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 .",
    "the mass of particle 1 acting as the projectile is of nucleon mass and that of particle 2 acting as the target is of kaon mass",
    ". it would certainly be much more interesting if we could test our work on kn scattering . but to do that we need a kn interaction in operator form , which is unfortunately not yet available .",
    "figure [ observ ] shows the spin averaged differential cross section for various projectile s laboratory energies from a few mev up to 1 gev .",
    "we want to stress out that the algebraic and numerical effort in 3d approach is the same for all different energies .",
    "we have developed a 3d technique for scattering of spin-@xmath0 and spin-@xmath1 particles .",
    "it will be very useful for investigation on , for example , kn system , given a kn interaction in operator form .",
    "the technique shows to be a good alternative to the pw technique , especially for higher energy region , where pw calculations may become not feasible . as an example",
    "some calculations based on a simple spin - orbit potential are performed .",
