    "the classical model of galaxy formation , the monolithic collapse model @xcite , proposes that galaxies form in a single massive collapse at high redshift and that subsequent evolution is purely passive .",
    "this model has been overtaken by the current dominant model of galaxy formation , the hierarchical merging model @xcite , which proposes that galaxies are built up through mergers : small objects form first and undergo a series of mergers that build up more massive objects .",
    "a third scenario , the revised monolithic collapse model ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , proposes that galaxies form in a number of rapid mergers at high redshift before evolving passively .",
    "galaxy clusters originate from the most extreme density fluctuations , where galaxy formation and evolution is expected to proceed at an accelerated rate .",
    "moreover , the stellar populations of galaxies moving into a cluster environment are expected to be modified via interactions with other galaxies and the dense intra - cluster medium .",
    "these interactions can be roughly divided into two broad classes : local processes including mergers @xcite and tidal interactions @xcite ; and global processes including ram pressure stripping @xcite , interactions with the cluster tidal field @xcite , harassment @xcite , and strangulation @xcite .",
    "local processes are more efficient in galaxy groups , where relative velocities are lower , while global processes are more efficient in clusters where the frequency of interaction is higher .",
    "correlations are therefore expected between galaxy observables and environment @xcite , and have been found for galaxy morphology @xcite , colour @xcite , srsic index @xcite , star - formation rate @xcite , and spectral type @xcite . however , in a comprehensive study of the dependence of galaxy observables on environment within the sdss , @xcite suggest that the structural properties of galaxies are less dependent on environment than their masses and star - formation histories .    to add to this debate , fundamental plane studies have found no differences between field galaxies more massive than @xmath4 and their counterparts in clusters at the same redshift @xcite , while less massive galaxies were found to be younger in the field @xcite .",
    "this might imply that star formation in field galaxies occurs first in the most massive galaxies then progressively in less massive galaxies , and that mass rather than environment governs the overall growth .",
    "the lick system of absorption - line indices @xcite and associated models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , from which the stellar population parameters ( spps ) age , metallicity ( [ z / h ] ) , and @xmath2-element abundance ratio ( @xmath5}$ ] ) can be estimated , provide an excellent method with which to study the role of mass and environment in determining galaxy properties .",
    "the line - strengths of early - type galaxies are found to be correlated with velocity dispersion ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "lick indices that are more sensitive to [ z / h ] effects , e.g.  mg__b _ _ , are positively correlated @xcite while those indices more sensitive to age effects , e.g.  @xmath7 , are negatively correlated @xcite .",
    "although both elements are sensitive to [ z / h ] , the slope of the correlation between mg and velocity dispersion is found to be much steeper than that of fe @xcite .",
    "these index@xmath6 correlations suggest that the spps should also be correlated with velocity dispersion .",
    "given the difference in the slopes of the mg@xmath6 and fe@xmath6 relations , a correlation between @xmath5}$ ] and velocity dispersion was expected and has been confirmed @xcite . if the @xmath2-element enhancement is due to the timescale of star formation , and velocity dispersion is a proxy for mass , then this correlation indicates that more massive galaxies form their stars on shorter timescales than less massive galaxies .",
    "the [ z / h ] of a galaxy is also found to correlate with velocity dispersion @xcite , with massive galaxies being more metal - rich .",
    "such a relation is a natural consequence of galactic wind models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which show that the larger gravitational potential of massive galaxies allows them to better retain their heavy elements .    whether a correlation exists between age and velocity dispersion is still uncertain .",
    "early studies found no significant correlation @xcite , but recent studies have detected a weak but significant correlation having large scatter @xcite , with more massive galaxies being older .",
    "this trend , which would indicate that more massive galaxies formed their stellar content earlier , is in agreement with the concept of down - sizing @xcite and the latest semi - analytic models of galaxy formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "early - type galaxies in low - density environments exhibit small differences to those in clusters : at a given luminosity , the early - type galaxies in low - density regions are @xmath8 gyr younger and @xmath9 dex more metal - rich than those in clusters @xcite . in conflict with the above results , @xcite , using a large sample of early - type galaxies from the sdss , found evidence that galaxies in low - density environments were less metal - rich than those in high - density environments .",
    "intriguingly , there appears to be no environmental dependence of @xmath5}$ ] @xcite , indicating that star formation in galaxies of a given mass occurs on the same timescale whether they are located in high - density or low - density environments .    while it appears that the stellar populations of galaxies change from low - density environments to high - density environments ,",
    "the density threshold at which this change occurs is uncertain .",
    "studies of the star - formation rate of galaxies in and around clusters @xcite find an increase in the star - formation rate with increasing distance from the cluster centre , converging to the mean field rate at distances greater than @xmath10 .",
    "the critical projected density at which suppression of star - formation begins is uncertain but the environmental influences on galaxy properties are believed not to be restricted to cluster cores , being effective in all groups where the density exceeds the critical value .",
    "the observed low rates of star formation well beyond the virialised cluster rule out physical processes associated with extreme environments ( such as ram pressure stripping of disk gas ) being completely responsible for the variations in galaxy properties with environment .",
    "this paper is the second in a series of papers aimed at studying the effects of environment and mass on the stellar populations of early - type galaxies .",

    "observations of galaxies from four clusters ( a930 , a1139 , a3558 and coma ) of varying richness and morphology were made with 2df during the nights of 1921 april 2002 .",
    "observations of galaxies from the same four clusters and the structures around them were made with 6df during the nights of 68 march 2003 .",
    "the 6df sample contained some galaxies in common with the 2df sample , but mostly consisted of galaxies in the outer regions of each cluster . in two of the fields ( a1139 and a930 ) ,",
    "the observations were offset from the cluster centre , allowing galaxies with cluster - centric distances of up to @xmath16 @xmath17 mpc to be studied .",
    "the set - up of the two instruments can be found in paper i.    a brief discussion of the way galaxies were classified as early types or not is warranted here .",
    "this was done spectroscopically with galaxies that showed signs of h@xmath2 ( ew@xmath18  ) or [ oiii]@xmath195007  ( ew@xmath20  ) emission being classified as star forming .",
    "we chose to classify a galaxy by its spectrum because comparisons to ssp models are ( almost ) meaningless in galaxies with significant emission . in - fill of the @xmath7 absorption feature by nebular emission results in weaker @xmath7 line - strengths and incorrectly older ages . some methods used to correct for this",
    "nebular in - fill ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have proved unsatisfactory , while others @xcite can only correct for relatively weak emission . for these reasons we eliminated all galaxies with signs of emission from our sample of early types .",
    "it must be noted that , in doing so , it is possible that we exclude from our stellar population analysis early - type galaxies that have had star formation triggered by the cluster environment .    other methods of classifying galaxies are not problem - free . classifying by morphology is highly subjective and samples selected by colour - magnitude cuts still contain contamination by galaxies that would have been morphologically classified as late types .",
    "more importantly , these methods do not eliminate all emission - line galaxies , up to 30% of red sequence galaxies can show signs of liner emission @xcite , and so the interpretation of a stellar population analysis for these galaxies would be difficult .",
    "however , the absence of emission lines does not guarantee that a galaxy has not had significant star formation in its recent past and so it is possible that our sample of early types contains a small number of post - starburst galaxies .",
    "the intrinsic scatters in the line strength@xmath6 ( section [ index sigma ] ) and stellar population parameter@xmath6 relations ( section [ low clus rels ] ) are comparable to published results implying that if our sample contains recently star - forming galaxies then it is in no greater number than previous samples .    the basic reduction steps , such as bias subtraction , spectrum extraction , flat - fielding , wavelength calibration , fibre throughput determination and correction , and sky subtraction , were performed with the purpose - built data reduction packages 2dfdr @xcite and 6dfdr @xcite .",
    "redshifts were measured using the program runz @xcite while the iraf task fxcor was used to measure velocity dispersions .",
    "line - strengths were measured and transformed to the lick system closely following procedures outlined in a number of papers ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the spectra were broadened to the lick resolution ( @xmath21 9   fwhm ) , and the line - strengths were measured using the program indexf @xcite .    a number of corrections were then applied to the measured line - strengths to fully calibrate them to the lick system .",
    "these corrections include a velocity dispersion correction to account for the change in line - strength caused by velocity broadening , an aperture correction to account for the different linear sizes subtended by the different fibres at different redshifts , and , finally , applying any offsets that may arise due to the fact that the lick spectra were not flux calibrated .",
    "this resulted in the measurement of the line - strength indices c@xmath224668 , @xmath7 , @xmath23 , [ oiii]@xmath24 , [ oiii]@xmath22 , fe5015 , mg@xmath24 , mg@xmath22 , mg__b _ _ , fe5270 , fe5335 and fe5406 of the stellar populations within the inner @xmath25 kpc of each galaxy .    the age , [ z / h ] , and @xmath5}$ ] of a galaxy were obtained by comparing our measured line - strengths to the models of @xcite and accepting the combination of spps of the model with the smallest @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "we interpolate the models logarithmically in steps of 0.02 dex in age and [ z / h ] , and 0.01 dex in @xmath5}$ ] .",
    "errors on the parameters were estimated by using the constant @xmath26 boundaries as confidence limits ( see * ? ? ? * ) .    in summary , we measured velocity dispersions , redshifts , and line - strengths for a total of 416 galaxies : 158 of these are early - type galaxies from coma , a1139 , a3558 , or a930 that are located within the abell radius ( i.e.  at a projected radial distance @xmath27 @xmath17 mpc ) and comprise our cluster sample ; 87 are early - type galaxies from the outskirts of these clusters at projected radial distances @xmath28 @xmath17 mpc and comprise the cluster - outskirts sample ; 168 galaxies",
    "were deemed to be star - forming , and make up the emission - line sample ; the 3 remaining galaxies lacked the information necessary to classify them as either an early - type or emission - line galaxy .",

    "however , to conclusively detect any differences in the age and [ z / h ] distributions , a two - sample 2d ks test is required , due to the correlated errors between age and [ z / h ] . for the @xmath5}$ ]",
    "distributions a two - sample 1d ks test is sufficient .",
    "the results of these tests are that the joint distributions of age and [ z / h ] , and the distributions of @xmath5}$ ] in each of the four clusters are consistent with each other .",
    "looking at the combined distributions of the cluster sample ( 142 galaxies in total ) , we find that the median [ z / h ] is @xmath29 dex , the median age is @xmath30 gyr , and the median @xmath5}$ ] is @xmath31 dex .",
    "the errors on these median values were determined the same way as for the clusters individually .",
    "these median values are shown as dotted lines in the marginal distributions in figure [ gal params all ] .",
    "there are some galaxies that have line - strengths that fall outside the ranges predicted by the stellar population models , in that there are six galaxies with age=15 gyr , four with [ z / h]=0.59 dex , and two with @xmath5}$]=0.19 dex .",
    "two galaxies have more than one parameter on the edge of the models and so in total there are 10 such galaxies .",
    "these galaxies are assigned the combination of spps that most nearly fits the combination of line - strengths , as mentioned in paper i. it is hard to determine the origin of this difference between the data and the models , which could be due to errors in the stellar population models ( it should be noted that the models provide no estimate of systematic uncertainties ) , or due to errors in the observations or data reduction ; only a small percentage of galaxies are affected , with @xmath32 of galaxies having self - consistent model parameter fits .    for the galaxies with age=15 gyr , it is possible that some of these galaxies are affected by nebular @xmath7 emission , despite the fact that care was taken in eliminating such galaxies .",
    "as was noted in paper i , it is possible for galaxies to have @xmath7 in emission and no detectable [ oiii]@xmath195007  @xcite . if this @xmath7 emission is undetectable , because it is swamped by @xmath7 absorption , and there is no [ oiii]@xmath195007  emission , then such a galaxy will not be classified as an emission - line galaxy and will not be excluded from the cluster sample .",
    "it is also evident that there appears to be an anti - correlation between [ z / h ] and age , in the sense that younger galaxies are more metal - rich .",
    "this might in principle be due to the non - orthogonal nature of the [ z / h]-age grids produced by the stellar population models , which mean that the errors on these two quantities are correlated .",
    "the effect is that an increase in a [ z / h]-sensitive index results not only in a increase in [ z / h ] but also in a decrease in age ; correspondingly , an increase in an age - sensitive index results in a decrease in age and an increase in [ z / h ] . due to the irregular shape of the grid ,",
    "this effect varies with location over the grid .    that a degree of anti - correlation between age and [ z / h ] is introduced by the correlated errors is not disputed ; however , whether this accounts for the anti - correlation entirely is still contentious @xcite .",
    "some studies find that there exists a moderate anti - correlation over and above that introduced by the errors ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) while others find that no correlation exists once the errors are taken into account ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "to determine whether the anti - correlation between age and [ z / h ] is real or not , we perform a simple test which involves comparing the degree of anti - correlation in the observed joint age[z / h ] distribution with those obtained by monte carlo simulations .    due to the need for an automated process to convert spps to line - strengths ( and vice versa )",
    "it is not feasible to use the method of spp estimation that makes use of all available indices .",
    "therefore , for this exercise , we rely on only three indices @xmath7 , mg__b _ _  and fe5335 .",
    "combinations of these three indices are commonly used in line - diagnostic diagrams to estimate ssps . with this combination of indices ,",
    "the age distribution is approximately exponential and both the [ z / h ] and @xmath5}$ ] distributions are approximately gaussian ( see figure [ gal params all res ] ) .",
    "we start by generating a sample of galaxies with age , [ z / h ] , and @xmath5}$ ] estimates ( parameter triples ) ; the [ z / h ] and @xmath5}$ ] were drawn from the distributions defined by the medians of the observed values and their intrinsic scatters and the age was drawn from an exponential distribution ( see section [ scatter ] for details on how the intrinsic scatters and the @xmath3-folding of the exponential age distribution were determined ) .",
    "these parameter triples are then converted to @xmath7 , mg__b _ _ , and fe5335 index values ( index triples ) , which are then perturbed using the observed indices error distributions .",
    "these perturbed index triples are then converted back to parameter triples and the spearman rank correlation statistic @xmath33 is calculated for age and [ z / h ] .",
    "this procedure is carried out 10,000 times . from these monte carlo simulations",
    "we determine the probability of obtaining by chance a correlation greater than that found for the observed data , and we find that there exists a real anti - correlation between age and [ z / h ] ( over and above the error - induced correlation ) that is significant at the @xmath34 level .",
    "the distributions of spps in the cluster - outskirts sample ( red crosses ) are compared to those from the clusters ( black circles ) in figure [ gal params env ] . for the sake of clarity ,",
    "only the errors for the cluster - outskirts sample are shown .",
    "the dashed lines in the marginal distributions are the median galaxy parameters for the cluster - outskirts sample and the dotted lines are for the cluster sample .",
    "the galaxies in the cluster - outskirts sample have a median [ z / h ] of @xmath35 dex , a median age of @xmath36 gyr , and median @xmath5}$ ] of @xmath37 dex . compared to the combined cluster sample",
    "we detect no difference in the median values for the galaxy parameters , although the errors are substantial .",
    "looking at the distributions we see that there is very little difference between the galaxies in this sample and those in the clusters , an assessment that is confirmed by ks testing ( a two - sample 2d ks test in the case of the age and [ z / h ] distributions and a two - sample 1d ks test for the @xmath5}$ ] distributions ) .    the fact that the @xmath5}$ ] distributions are the same in the clusters and their outskirts is intriguing , given that the cores of galaxy clusters are thought to result from regions of high over - density where the process of star formation occurs rapidly @xcite .",

    "although , given the size of our errors it is not surprising that we do not detect such a small difference .",

    "we would like to point out that a fit ( using the unrestricted set of indices ) was only accepted if @xmath7 was used and at least two other indices .",
    "see paper i for more details .",
    "we show the results of comparing the two sets of estimates in figure [ percent ] .",
    "for [ z / h ] and @xmath5}$ ] the agreement between the two sets of estimates is quite good , although there is an offset of 0.05 dex in @xmath5}$ ] in the sense that the unrestricted set of indices gives larger values of @xmath5}$ ] .",
    "there is also an offset of 1.3 gyr between the two age estimates ( but in the opposite sense to that of the @xmath5}$ ] offset ) and there is some scatter that increases with age .",
    "this is due to the fact that , in index space , the distance between lines of constant age decreases with increasing age so that small shifts in index strengths can lead to large changes in age estimates . according to a spearman rank correlation test",
    "the two datasets are consistent .",
    "this implies that the two ways of measuring the stellar population parameters rank the objects in the same order and that there should be no effect on our results .",
    "in part , the spread in the spp distributions found for the cluster sample is due to a combination of our observational errors and the correlations with velocity dispersion . to determine the amount of intrinsic scatter in the distributions , over and above that caused by the observational errors",
    ", we ran a series of numerical simulations .",
    "the method used was as follows .    due to the need to create a large number of models containing a large number of galaxies , which need to have their spps converted to line - strengths ( and vice versa ) , it is not feasible to estimate spps using all available indices",
    ". therefore , for this exercise , we rely on the three indices used earlier in investigating the anti - correlation between age and [ z / h ] , i.e. @xmath7 , mg__b _ _  and fe5335 .    with this combination of indices , galaxies in the cluster sample have an age distribution that is approximately exponential and [ z / h ] and @xmath5}$ ] have distributions that are approximately gaussian ( see figure [ gal params all res ] ) .",
    "therefore , we began by selecting a range of @xmath3-foldings for the exponential age distribution ( @xmath57 , 0.15 , 0.30 , 0.55 , 0.90 , 1.60 , 2.80 , 5.00 , 8.50 , 15.00 gyr ) , and ranges of gaussian scatters in [ z / h ] ( @xmath58}=0.03 $ ] , 0.05 , 0.08 , 0.12 , 0.20 , 0.30 , 0.50 , 0.80 , 1.25 , 2.00 dex ) , and @xmath5}$ ] ( @xmath59}=0.03 $ ] , 0.04 , 0.07 , 0.10 , 0.15 , 0.20 , 0.30 , 0.45 , 0.70 , 1.00 dex ) . each range was chosen to be approximately evenly spaced logarithmically so as to have better resolution at small values .",
    "the medians of the cluster [ z / h ] and @xmath5}$ ] distributions were used as the means of their gaussian distributions , and the exponential age distribution was truncated at 5 gyr ( because the models are less reliable at young ages ) and at 14 gyr ( the age of the universe ) .",
    "a model was generated for each combination of @xmath60 , @xmath58}$ ] , and @xmath59}$ ] consisting of 10,000 mock galaxies with ages , [ z / h ] , and @xmath5}$ ] ( parameter triples ) drawn randomly from the specified distributions . if any of the mock galaxies had a [ z / h ] or @xmath5}$ ] that fell outside the extent of the models gyr , @xmath61}\\le 0.67 $ ] dex , and @xmath62}\\le 0.5 $ ] dex .",
    "] then they were assigned the closest value from the models ; this was not necessary for the ages since they were truncated at the values stated above .",
    "these parameter triples were converted , via the @xcite  models , to the corresponding @xmath7 , mg__b _ _ , and fe5335 index values ( index triples ) .",
    "this was achieved as follows .",
    "the models were divided up into cells defined by two adjacent values of each spp , and for each mock galaxy the cell in which it fell was determined .",
    "each cell is also defined by eight values of @xmath7 , mg__b _ _ , and fe5335 , corresponding to their values at the eight vertices of the cubical cell .",
    "the index triple corresponding to the parameter triple is then calculated by taking the mean of each of these eight index values weighted by the distance in parameter space of the mock galaxy from each corner of the cell .",
    "these index triples were then perturbed by randomly drawing errors from an observed galaxy s index error distributions . in doing this",
    "we cycled through the observed galaxies so that each observed galaxy had an approximately equal number of mock galaxies perturbed by its index error distributions .",
    "the perturbed index triples were converted back to parameter triples .    to ascertain how well the models fit the data a likelihood statistic was used .",
    "the spp space was divided up into bins and the probability of each bin containing a galaxy was calculated .",
    "the age bins were 0.5 gyr in width and ranged from 0 and 15 gyr , the [ z / h ] bins were 0.125 dex in width and ranged from @xmath63 to 0.7125 dex , and the @xmath5}$ ] bins were 0.025 dex in width and ranged from 0.0 to 0.5 dex .",
    "this resulted in 30 age bins , 24 [ z / h ] bins , and 20 @xmath5}$ ] bins . before the likelihood statistic was calculated ,",
    "the model was lightly smoothed to minimise the number of bins with zero probabilities ; a 3d gaussian , with @xmath64 bins for all dimensions , was used as the smoothing kernel , and bins within 3@xmath6 , in each dimension , were used in calculating the value of the bin probability in the smoothed model ( i.e.  two bins either side in each dimension were used ) .",
    "the likelihood statistic is obtained by determining which bins the observed galaxies lie in and summing the logarithm of the bin probabilities .",
    "monte carlo simulations were used to estimate the probability of obtaining a likelihood statistic larger than the observed one by chance .",
    "there are 103 galaxies with measurements of the indices required to estimate the spps in the cluster sample , so we simulate 103 galaxies in an identical manner to the model and calculate the maximum likelihood statistic .",
    "this is done 10,000 times .",
    "the fraction of simulations with likelihood statistics larger than the observed value are recorded and 3d confidence contours are generated .",
    "these 3d confidence contours are shown in figure [ 3d contour ] , which presents the likelihood of our dataset being represented by a model with the specified @xmath3-folding of the exponential distribution of ages and specified rms scatters in the gaussian distributions of [ z / h ] and @xmath5}$ ] . while figure [ 3d contour ] provides an overall picture of the acceptable scatters in the spps , more detailed information can be revealed by taking slices through the 3d confidence contours .",
    "figure [ contour slices ] shows slices taken parallel to the age-[z / h ] plane at values of @xmath5}$ ] corresponding to those used in generating the models .",
    "these simulations provide us with a great deal of information regarding the intrinsic scatter in each of the spps .",
    "firstly , it is difficult to constrain the @xmath3-folding of the exponential age distribution .",
    "this is due to small uncertainties in line - strengths translating to large changes in the age estimate combined with relatively large observational errors in the @xmath7 index .",
    "although models with small values of @xmath3-folding are not ruled out , we find that our data is most consistent with the model having @xmath65 myr . secondly , small scatters in [ z / h ] ( @xmath58}<0.1 $ ] dex ) are strongly ruled out , as are large scatters ( @xmath58}>2.0 $ ] dex ) .",
    "we find the model with @xmath58 } = 0.3 $ ] dex is the most consistent with our data .",
    "finally , large scatters in @xmath5}$ ] ( @xmath66}}>0.3 $ ] dex ) are also strongly ruled out .",
    "models with low scatters in @xmath5}$ ] are not ruled out , but we find that the most consistent model is that with @xmath66 } } = 0.07 $ ] dex .",
    "the model that gives the maximum likelihood ( i.e.  @xmath67 myr , @xmath58}\\sim 0.3 $ ] dex , and @xmath66 } } = 0.07 $ ] dex ) is marked by a cross in figure [ contour slices ] .    since the spps were found to be correlated with velocity dispersion , and since the galaxies in the cluster sample have a range of velocity dispersions , it is understandable that we should detect an intrinsic scatter in the spp distributions .",
    "the degree to which the intrinsic scatter in the parameter distributions is attributable to trends with velocity dispersion can be estimated by comparing the scatter expected given the velocity dispersion distribution in the cluster and the intrinsic scatter about the parameter@xmath6 relations .",
    "we use the parameter@xmath6 relations to convert the galaxies velocity dispersions into parameter values .",
    "the scatter in these values is then calculated ; the intrinsic scatter about the relation ( as found in section [ low clus rels ] ) is then added in quadrature to the scatter due to the relation with velocity dispersion , and the result is compared to that obtained from the simulations described above .",
    "we do this only for [ z / h ] and @xmath5}$ ] , which were found to have approximately gaussian distributions .",
    "the scatter expected in [ z / h ] on this basis is 0.21 dex which is comparable to the intrinsic scatter of @xmath58}\\sim 0.3 $ ] dex estimated above .",
    "the expected scatter in @xmath5}$ ] is 0.06 dex which is very close to the estimated intrinsic scatter @xmath66 } } \\sim 0.07 $ ] dex .",
    "it appears then that the intrinsic scatter in both the [ z / h ] and @xmath5}$ ] distributions can almost entirely be accounted for by the parameter@xmath6 relation and the intrinsic scatter about it .    for [ z / h ] ,",
    "the scatter due to the correlation is 0.16 dex while the intrinsic scatter about the relation is 0.13 dex ; thus , most of the intrinsic scatter in the [ z / h ] distribution comes from the correlation with velocity dispersion . for @xmath5}$ ] , the scatter due to the correlation is 0.03 dex while the intrinsic scatter about the relation is 0.05 dex ; thus most of the intrinsic scatter in the @xmath5}$ ] distribution comes from the intrinsic scatter about the @xmath5}$]@xmath6 relation .",
    "the process by which galaxies form and the factors with the greatest influence on their evolution are unresolved issues . in models of galaxy formation based on hierarchical merging in a @xmath68cdm universe ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) the merger history of an early - type galaxy can fall anywhere between two extremes : mergers could occur early - on and rapidly with subsequent passive evolution ",
    "the revised monolithic collapse scenario ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) ; or the galaxy could experience a more prolonged history of mergers  the extended merging scenario ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the environment of a galaxy and its mass are the two most influential factors on galaxy evolution but their effects need to be to disentangled to gain an insight into the relative importance of each .    for cluster galaxies , the numerical simulations performed here show that the intrinsic scatters in [ z / h ] and @xmath5}$ ] , and the @xmath3-folding of the exponential distribution of ages , are all quite small , as would be expected from a rapid formation at high redshift followed by passive evolution .",
    "additionally , positive correlations are found between all three of the spps and velocity dispersion .",
    "the correlations found for both [ z / h ] and @xmath5}$ ] confirm well - known trends @xcite .",
    "however the correlation found for age is not widely recognised ; some authors find age and velocity dispersion to be positively correlated @xcite while others find they are not correlated at all @xcite .",
    "not only do we find that age is positively correlated , but also that it is the most significantly correlated out of the three spps , being significant at the @xmath69 level .",
    "these correlations are qualitatively consistent with more recent semi - analytic models @xcite .",
    "these models incorporate feedback from agn @xcite , which heats the available gas , preventing further star formation in massive galaxies and bringing the predicted scaling relations into agreement with those observed .",
    "there is a level of homogeneity to early - type cluster galaxies evidenced in the similarity of their line - strength and spp distributions and the consistency of the correlations between these quantities and velocity dispersion that is found between the clusters studied here . that this homogeneity is maintained amongst clusters of varying richness and morphology indicates that differences in the cluster environment have relatively little effect on the stellar populations of early - type galaxies .",
    "the dominant factor appears to be mass .",
    "while mass plays a large role in determining the spps in early - type galaxies , it does not do so completely .",
    "the size of the role played varies ; while [ z / h ] is almost entirely a function of velocity dispersion , @xmath5}$ ] is less so .",
    "the intrinsic scatters in [ z / h ] and @xmath5}$ ] in the cluster galaxies were found to be almost entirely accounted for by the scatter produced by the correlations with velocity dispersion and the intrinsic scatter about these relations .",
    "galaxies in low - density environments are observed to be , on average , @xmath70 gyr younger than galaxies in clusters @xcite .",
    "the situation is not so clear with regards to differences in [ z / h ] and @xmath5}$ ] .",
    "recent models predict that galaxies in denser environments are older and more metal - rich than isolated galaxies @xcite .",
    "we do not find significant differences in the line - strength distributions or the spp distributions between the cluster - outskirts sample and the cluster sample .",
    "however , the size of our spp errors make it difficult to detect the small differences in age reported by other authors and any difference may be masked by the 1.3 gyr offset to older ages found for galaxies that their parameters estimated from fewer indices ; such galaxies are found predominantly in the cluster - outskirts sample .",
    "we do find that the tight correlations with velocity dispersion of both the line - strengths and spps that are found in clusters are weaker in the cluster outskirts , suggesting that the modes of formation in the cluster outskirts are more varied than those in the cluster cores .",
    "similar results were found by @xcite who conclude that the formation and evolution of early - type galaxies are relatively insensitive to environment and are instead driven by self - regulation processes and their intrinsic properties such as mass .",
    "however , our result that the spp trends with velocity dispersion are weaker in the cluster - outskirts than in the clusters is in conflict with these results ( see also * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "the dip in ages found near the cluster virial radius ( see figure [ gal params r ] ) suggests that movement into the cluster environment may induce a burst of star formation and , combined with the down - sizing evident in figure [ param sig ] , that this burst may occur preferentially in lower mass galaxies ( similar to the rejuvenated population from @xcite ) .",
    "presumably , our two samples ( cluster and cluster - outskirts ) are combined in their single high - density sample , which may result in the masking of this trend .",
    "our results are broadly consistent with the results of @xcite who find a variation of the spps with cluster radius .",
    "@xcite find that environment becomes more of an influence moving to less massive galaxies ( see also * ? ? ?",
    ".    our results can be best explained by the revised monolithic collapse model , but is also consistent with the extended merging model if the mergers are dissipationless ( see * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite have a model of elliptical galaxy formation that implements a detailed treatment of chemical evolution , and they find that the correlation between @xmath5}$ ] and velocity dispersion is much less steep than that observed .",
    "@xcite find that agn quenching can help to improve the agreement , but this worsens their mass - metallicity relation compared to observations .",
    "they suggest that both relations can be reproduced provided the formation of all spheroids happens quasi - monolithically , i.e. the formation of the stars occurs in sub - units and that this star formation and the assembly of the sub - units into an elliptical galaxy occur at the same time and in the same place .",
    "the star - formation rates in galaxies are found to increase with increasing distance from the cluster centre , and to converge to the mean field rate at distances greater than @xmath71 times the virial radius ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also @xcite ) .",
    "we find evidence that there is a dip in the mean ages of galaxies just inside the cluster virial radius , possibly due to secondary star formation that reduces the luminosity - weighted mean age . this could be evidence that in - falling galaxies , upon reaching the virial radius of a cluster , undergo a burst of star formation triggered by the dense intra - cluster medium .",
    "if such a burst only amounted to a small fraction of the galaxy s total mass then its effect on the integrated light would be short - lived and the galaxy would rapidly return to appearing old and red .",
    "similar to the findings of @xcite , we find that this decrease in age actually begins at @xmath42 , suggesting that the influence of the cluster environment extends to large distances .",
    "whereas the result of @xcite was based mainly on late - type galaxies , the remarkable thing about this result is that it applies to early - type galaxies .",
    "there are two sources of bias that we must check have not influenced the above results : the number of indices used to derive the spps and and the aperture corrections .",
    "it is possible that the lack of correlations with velocity dispersion for the spps in the cluster - outskirts sample is due to the fact that , on average , fewer indices were used to estimate them than those in the cluster sample .",
    "this results in larger spp errors and might potentially explain the lack of correlations with velocity dispersion .",
    "however , as we show in section [ clus out rels ] , using only three indices to estimate the spps does not significantly alter their distributions compared to those derived from an unrestricted set of indices .",
    "it is also possible that mass segregation within the cluster could cause the weakening of the line - strengths in the cluster outskirts , if that is where less massive galaxies are preferentially found .",
    "this is a result of the same aperture correction being applied to a galaxy irrespective of how massive it is and despite the fact that the line - strengths being corrected were measured within differing effective radii .",
    "we find that our two samples ( cluster and cluster - outskirts ) have a similar shape to their magnitude distributions but that the galaxies in the cluster - outskirts are on average @xmath72mag brighter , due to the facts that there are more galaxies in the cluster sample and that we target the brightest galaxies .",
    "so the correlation of weak line - strengths for less massive galaxies can not be the reason for the weakening of the trends with velocity dispersion in the cluster - outskirts galaxies .",
    "we see no reason , therefore , not to believe that the weakening of the relations in the cluster - outskirts is real .",
    "the overall picture that emerges from this study is as follows .",
    "early - type galaxies in clusters form a homogeneous class of objects that form in a process similar to a revised monolithic collapse and whose stellar populations are largely determined by their velocity dispersion ( mass ) and are relatively unaffected ( at least differentially ) by the cluster environment .",
    "the more massive they are the older and more metal - rich they are , and the shorter their star - formation timescales .",
    "the stellar populations of early - type galaxies in the outskirts of clusters , in contrast , appear less influenced by mass because , due to the varying environments they formed and evolved in , their evolutionary histories are more varied and this causes the correlations with mass to be less significant .",
    "a galaxy , especially a less massive one , that is falling into a cluster will , upon nearing the virial radius , undergo a burst of star formation .",
    "once these stars have faded and ceased dominating the integrated light the galaxy will appear indistinguishable from those in the cluster core .",
    "in summary , we have measured velocity dispersions , redshifts and absorption - line strengths for a magnitude - limited ( @xmath73 ) sample of galaxies drawn from four clusters ( coma , a1139 , a3558 , and a930 at @xmath74 ) and their surrounds ( extending to @xmath75 ) . using the fully - calibrated absorption - line indices coupled with the stellar population models of @xcite , we have estimated ages , [ z / h ] , and @xmath5}$ ] for 219 galaxies .",
    "we have used these data to investigate the effects of mass and environment on the stellar populations of early - type galaxies and our results can be summarised as follows .    1 .   for galaxies in the cluster sample ,",
    "all indices are positively correlated with velocity dispersion , with the exceptions of @xmath7 and @xmath23 , which are negatively correlated , and fe5406 , which is uncorrelated .",
    "2 .   only mg__b _ _  and",
    "@xmath23 are correlated with velocity dispersion in the cluster - outskirts sample .",
    "the slopes of these two relations are consistent with those found for the cluster sample .",
    "the cluster cores are relatively free from young galaxies and from galaxies that have experienced recent star formation .",
    "these galaxies are more commonly found outside @xmath76 .",
    "the stellar populations in clusters form a homogeneous population . despite the fact that our sample was drawn from four clusters spanning the ranges of bautz - morgan classifications and abell richness classes , the line - strength@xmath6 relations , parameter-@xmath6 relations , and spp distributions are consistent between clusters .",
    "there is no difference between the line - strength distributions and spp distributions in the clusters and their outskirts .",
    "the spps in clusters are correlated with velocity dispersion , suggesting that more massive galaxies are older , have shorter star - formation timescales , and are more metal - rich .",
    "these correlations are found to be weaker in the cluster outskirts .",
    "7 .   for galaxies in the cluster sample ,",
    "the @xmath3-folding time of the age distribution is 900 myr , the intrinsic scatter in the [ z / h ] distribution is 0.3 dex , and the intrinsic scatter in the @xmath5}$ ] distribution is 0.07 dex .",
    "these latter two intrinsic scatters can almost entirely be accounted for by the correlations with velocity dispersion and the scatter about the relations .",
    "we conclude , therefore , that the mass of a galaxy plays a major role in determining its stellar populations .",
    "further high quality observations of galaxies at higher redshifts will allow the development of a consistent model of early - type galaxy formation at all masses and in all environments . + the authors thank the anonymous referee for a careful reading of the paper and for the many helpful suggestions that improved it considerably .",

    "<S> the degree of influence that environment and mass have on the stellar populations of early - type galaxies is uncertain . </S>",
    "<S> in this paper we present the results of a spectroscopic analysis of the stellar populations of early - type galaxies aimed at addressing this question . </S>",
    "<S> the sample of galaxies is drawn from four clusters , with @xmath0 , and their surrounding structure extending to @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the distributions of the absorption - line strengths and the stellar population parameters age , metallicity and @xmath2-element abundance ratio do not differ significantly between the clusters and their outskirts , but the tight correlations found between these quantities and velocity dispersion within the clusters are weaker in their outskirts . </S>",
    "<S> all three stellar population parameters of cluster galaxies are positively correlated with velocity dispersion . </S>",
    "<S> galaxies in clusters form a homogeneous class of objects that have similar distributions of line - strengths and stellar population parameters , and follow similar scaling relations regardless of cluster richness or morphology . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate the intrinsic scatter of the gaussian distribution of metallicities to be 0.3 dex , while that of the @xmath2-element abundance ratio is 0.07 dex . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath3-folding time of the exponential distribution of galaxy ages is estimated to be 900 myr . </S>",
    "<S> the intrinsic scatters of the metallicity and @xmath2-element abundance ratio distributions can almost entirely be accounted for by the correlations with velocity dispersion and the intrinsic scatter about these relations . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that a galaxies mass plays the major role in determining its stellar population .    </S>",
