    "we consider ngc 2023 to represent the conditions in a prototypical giant molecular cloud , as @xcite have claimed that the pdr position observed is probably embedded in the molecular cloud , therefore the hco@xmath3/hoc@xmath3 ratio would be biased toward the typical cloud unaffected by uv radiation .",
    "the hco@xmath3/hco ratios show the same trend than the hco@xmath3/hoc@xmath3 ratios .",
    "the hco@xmath3/hco ratios are factors of 4 - 8 ( _ _ los__+0.693 ) and @xmath45 - 10 ( _ _ los__@xmath00.11 ) higher than the hco@xmath3/hco ratio of 1 - 2 in typical galactic pdrs . however , it is not clear why the hco@xmath3/hco ratios show smaller differences between both gc sources and galaxies . in our comparison ,",
    "the pdrs ngc 7023 and ngc 2023 show the highest hco@xmath3/hco ratios , which are biased because both sources were observed toward positions where the hco@xmath3 emission arises from the shielded molecular clouds @xcite .",
    "the difference found in the hco@xmath3/hoc@xmath3 and hco@xmath3/hco ratios between our sample of typical pdrs and _",

    "it has been claimed that the hoc@xmath3 and hco abundances might increase in regions illuminated by x - rays .",
    "@xcite argued that xdr chemistry could provide an explanation for the different abundances of hco@xmath3 and hoc@xmath3 measured in the circumnuclear disk of the agn ngc 1068 , which also shows strong fe k@xmath7 ( 6.4 kev ) line like in _ _ los__+0.693 .",
    "however they found hco@xmath3/hoc@xmath3 ratios of @xmath140 - 100 and the hco@xmath3/hco ratio of 3 in the cnd of ngc 1068 which are similar to those found in our sample of typical pdrs .",
    "therefore xdr chemistry seems unlikely to explain the large hco@xmath3/hoc@xmath3 and hco@xmath3/hco ratios observed in the gc _",

    "the pdr model predicts hco@xmath3/hoc@xmath3 ratios of @xmath1100 , which agree with those derived in ngc 7023 and the orion bar @xcite . for an x - ray flux of 1.6 erg @xmath53 s@xmath8 , and a density of 10@xmath65 @xmath63 , appropriate to _ _",

    "this result is consistent with the lack of x - ray emission in _ _ los__@xmath00.11 ( see fig .  [ fig10 ] ) .",
    "the derived hco / hoc@xmath3 ratio of @xmath163 derived in _ _",

    "these results also support the hnco / cs diagnostic diagram proposed by @xcite to establish the dominant chemistry and the heating mechanism working in molecular clouds since by using this diagram they found that the chemistry and likely the heating of both gc sources are mainly dominated by shocks .",
    "we have used the mopra telescope to carry out a 3 mm spectral line survey in the selected frequency ranges of @xmath177 - 93 ghz and @xmath1105 - 113 ghz of two lines of sight , _ _ los__+0.693 and _ _ los__@xmath00.11 , toward the sgr b2 and sgr a complexes in the galactic center .",
    "the main conclusions of our study are the following :    * we have detected 38 molecular species and 25 isotopologues in _ _ los__+0.693 and 34 molecular species and 18 isotopologues in _ _ los__@xmath00.11 .",

    "although _ _ los__+0.693 and _ _ los__@xmath00.11 are separated by more than @xmath1120 pc within the gc , @xmath180% of molecular species detected in both gc sources reveal similar abundances within a factor of 2 and similar excitation conditions .",

    "the derived @xmath71c/@xmath54c , @xmath48o/@xmath92o and @xmath93si/@xmath94si ratios averaged over both gc sources agree within uncertainties with the `` canonical '' values for the gc .",
