    "there is significant interest in the physics of heavy quarkonia stimulated by discoveries of narrow peaks in the spectrum .",
    "such peaks may indicate existence of new hadrons .",
    "a recent review of the experimental situation and of the various theoretical models can be found , for example , in  @xcite .",
    "while the quark model provides a remarkably accurate description of the heavy quarkonium spectrum , these new peaks , also referred to as the xyz states , appear at masses that do not , in a natural way , derive from the quark model  @xcite .",
    "several of these peaks have been observed in invariant mass distributions of meson pairs that contain one heavy quarkonium , _",
    "e.g. _ the @xmath2 or the @xmath3 , and one light meson . the possibility that these new hadrons are therefore multi - quark bound states has been explored , for example in @xcite .",
    "the peaks appear near thresholds for production of meson pairs with open flavor , _",
    "e.g. _ @xmath4 or @xmath5 , and for this reason it has also been suggested that binding between the two flavored mesons may be responsible for generating some of the xyz s",
    "it should be recognized , however , that distinction between multi - quark and hadron bound states is complicated  @xcite and in any case requires sophisticated amplitude analysis and precise data @xcite .",
    "it has also been suggested  @xcite and studied in  @xcite that coupling to nearby open channels may produce peaks even without presence of new hadrons . in the mathematical language of amplitude analysis the analogous statement would be that threshold cusp may be enhanced not only by a nearby pole but by a carefully arranged set of branch points , also referred to as anomalous thresholds .",
    "amplitude poles correspond to physical particles ( stable or unstable ) while cuts represent the effect of `` forces '' , _",
    "i.e. _ exchanges of known particles in the crossed - channels . if the xyz peaks were due to the latter it could potentially weaken the case for new hadrons . to address this issue",
    "it is therefore important to perform a systematic analysis of the `` forces '' and the associated singularities .",
    "we consider a decay of a heavy object of mass @xmath6 , hereafter referred to as the @xmath6 particle , to a quasi stable heavy state of mass @xmath7 and a pair of degenerate , light mesons of mass @xmath8 .",
    "we are interested in the energy dependence of the low spin partial waves , in particular the @xmath9-waves , in the @xmath10 channel . in this section",
    "we discuss a generic case and in the section that follows we consider threshold behavior in @xmath11 and @xmath12 production from @xmath13  @xcite and @xmath14 @xcite decays , respectively .",
    "the reaction of interest is @xmath15 with @xmath16 referring to the 4-vectors . ignoring spin , the reaction amplitude",
    ", @xmath17 is a scalar function of two independent lorentz invariant mandelstam variables , which we choose as , @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "they correspond to the invariant mass squared of the @xmath20 pair and momentum transfer squared between the two heavy mesons , respectively .",
    "the amplitude in the kinematics of the decay region , @xmath21 , @xmath22 can be obtained by analytical continuation in @xmath23 of the amplitude describing the @xmath24-channel scattering process , @xmath25 .",
    "it is the @xmath23-channel singularities of the latter that are responsible for anomalous singularities of the @xmath24-channel partial waves .",
    "similar analysis applies to the @xmath26-channel where @xmath27 .",
    "bose symmetry requires the amplitude to be @xmath28 symmetric .",
    "the @xmath24-channel partial waves , @xmath29 , describe production of the @xmath10 system in a state of fixed angular momentum , @xmath30 .",
    "ignoring spin of the external particles , partial waves are the coefficients in expansion of @xmath17 in a series of legendre polynomials , @xmath31 the argument of the rotational functions , @xmath32 , is the cosine of the scattering angle in the center of mass frame of the @xmath24-channel . when considered as complex functions of the invariant mass squared , @xmath24 , the partial waves @xmath29 have branch points at all @xmath24-channel production thresholds .",
    "the cuts associated with these branch points are located on the positive real @xmath24 axis and unitarity determines the discontinuity across the cuts .",
    "these cuts are referred to as the right hand cuts . through the partial wave projection , @xmath33 threshold singularities of @xmath17 in the @xmath23 and the @xmath26 channel",
    "also lead to branch points in the complex @xmath24 plane .",
    "the associated cuts are generically referred to as the left hand cuts , even though , as it will be the case here , they do nt always lie on the negative real @xmath24-axis . in the following we consider only the @xmath9-waves ( @xmath34 ) and drop the angular momentum subscript on the partial waves .",
    "higher partial waves are suppressed at thresholds due to the angular momentum barrier factors .    in the cases considered here ,",
    "@xmath35 is of the order of several gev and there are several open channels contributing to the right hand side discontinuity .",
    "as long as their thresholds are far from the region of interest they will not lead to rapid variations in @xmath24 .",
    "it is therefore sufficient to focus on the channels , which open near the xyz production thresholds . for simplicity",
    "we assume that the relevant channel consists of two identical mesons with mass @xmath36 . in the cases considered in the following section",
    "these will correspond to the @xmath5 or the @xmath37 state . here , for simplicity , we ignore the mass difference between the pseudoscalar and vector mesons .",
    "we assume that masses satisfy the following relation , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , _",
    "i.e. _ we take mass of the decaying / produced quarkonium to be slightly above / below the open flavor threshold .",
    "the mass of the light particle , @xmath8 is much smaller compared to masses of the other mesons that all contain heavy quarks , @xmath40 , so in the following we take @xmath41 . for @xmath42",
    "the amplitude has a slightly different analytical structure .",
    "the difference , however , does not affect the behavior near the @xmath43 threshold .",
    "the contribution of the @xmath43 channel to the discontinuity of the @xmath44 @xmath9-wave amplitude , is given by    @xmath45    here @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the @xmath9-wave projections of the amplitudes @xmath48 and @xmath49 describing the reactions , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , respectively .",
    "the phase space factor @xmath52 is given by @xmath53 .",
    "it should be noted that amplitude discontinuity , @xmath54 is in general a complex function of @xmath24 and not equal to @xmath55 , as sometimes assumed  @xcite .",
    "this has important consequences when considering phase of the amplitude , which is often used to discriminate between resonant and non - resonant behaviors .",
    "we reconstruct @xmath56 from its discontinuity approximated by eq .",
    "( [ dis ] ) since , in the region of interest , the difference between @xmath57 and the true discontinuity is expected to be a smooth function of @xmath24 , @xmath58 where @xmath59 . if @xmath56 is to have a strong dependence on @xmath24 , the numerator under the integral has to vary rapidly with @xmath24 .",
    "rapid variations are determined by nearby singularities . as discussed above , if direct channel bound states are excluded , the only physically allowed singularities of partial waves are branch points .",
    "thus in order for the integral in eq .",
    "( [ unit ] ) to develop a singularity the branch points of the numerator have to either appear at the endpoint of the integration region or pinch the integration contour .",
    "we note here , that in @xcite the amplitudes @xmath46 and @xmath47 were chosen proportional to an exponential , @xmath60 with @xmath61 .",
    "such behavior was motivated by a quark model .",
    "non - relativistic quark model calculations often involve gaussian wave functions and",
    "one could imagine that a calculation , in which the scattering amplitude is derived from a diagram involving quark exchanges between interacting mesons , would produce energy dependence that falls off exponentially .",
    "such a model , at best , is valid for non - relativistic relative momenta and has incorrect crossing - properties that prevents it from being used in a dispersive analysis .",
    "a dispersive analysis requires that the amplitudes vanish at infinity in all directions in the complex @xmath24-plane or , in the worst case , grow polynomially .",
    "instead , the amplitudes in @xcite have an essential singularity at infinity .",
    "such a singularity is unphysical , it violates causality , which requires the amplitudes to be polynomially bound . if a proper lorentz covariant quark model was constructed the quark exchange mechanism would correspond to @xmath26-channel exchanges that do not overlap with exchanges of normal , _",
    "i.e. _ quark - antiquark , mesons .",
    "such `` forces '' lead to @xmath24-channel partial wave amplitude singularities located far to the left from @xmath24-channel unitary cuts and as such do not produce enhancements in the @xmath24-channel physical region .",
    "for example the form @xmath60 might be replaced by @xmath62 .",
    "the latter vanishes in all directions at infinity and with @xmath63 it is often used to approximate singularities located far away to the left from the physical region . when such a form factor is used in eq .",
    "( [ unit ] ) ( in place of the @xmath64 and @xmath65 ) it results in a normal , not enhanced threshold cusp .    in the following",
    "we show that @xmath56 develops a pinch singularity through @xmath47 but not for through @xmath46 .",
    "since @xmath47 is the @xmath24 channel , s - wave projection of the @xmath66 amplitude @xmath67 we use the @xmath23-channel dispersion relation to write , @xmath68 where @xmath69 here @xmath70 is the @xmath23-channel discontinuity of @xmath71 at fixed-@xmath24 and @xmath72 is the location of the lowest mass singularity .",
    "the lowest mass that can be exchanged in the @xmath23-channel is the pseudoscalar or vector ( here , for simplicity , assumed degenerate and stable ) open flavor , _",
    "e.g. _ @xmath73 or @xmath74 , meson . in this case",
    "@xmath75 ( ignoring spin of the exchanged particle ) and the constant @xmath76 is given by the product of couplings of the exchanged meson to the @xmath77 and @xmath78 meson pairs .",
    "for larger @xmath79 unitarity in the @xmath23-channel , relates the discontinuity @xmath80 to the product of amplitudes @xmath81 and @xmath82 representing the interaction between the external meson pairs @xmath77 and @xmath78 , and intermediate states containing , besides the heavy meson , other hadrons , _",
    "e.g. _ @xmath83 light mesons , @xmath84",
    ". it will be shown below that the relevant singularities of @xmath47 originate from a small interval in @xmath79 that corresponds to @xmath23-channel intermediate states containing a few particles .",
    "complicated @xmath23-channel intermediate states are therefore not relevant when looking for sources of threshold cusp enhancement .",

    "<S> we discuss analytical properties of partial waves derived from projection of a 4-legged amplitude with crossed - channel exchanges in the kinematic region of the direct channel that corresponds to the xyz peaks in charmonium and bottomonium . </S>",
    "<S> we show that in general partial waves can develop anomalous branch points in the vicinity of the direct channel physical region . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this effect only occurs if masses of resonances in the crossed channel are in a specific , narrow range . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate the size of threshold enhancements originating from these anomalous singularities in reactions where the @xmath0 and the @xmath1 peaks have been observed . </S>"
