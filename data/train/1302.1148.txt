    "this high mutational input suggests that the short - term effective population size of _ d.  melanogaster _ is greater than @xmath2 and conventional genetic drift should be negligible .",
    "possible forces that accelerate coalescence and reduce diversity are _ purifying _ and _ positive _ selection .",

    "hill - roberston interference has been intensively studied in two locus models @xcite where the effect is quite intuitive : two linked beneficial mutations arising in different individuals compete and the probability that both mutations fix increases with the recombination rate between the loci .",

    "the common aspect of all these models is the source of stochastic fluctuations : random associations with backgrounds of different fitness .",
    "in contrast to genetic drift , such associations persist for many generations , which amplifies their effect . in analogy to genetic drift , the fluctuations in allele frequencies through linked selection have been termed _ genetic draft _ @xcite . the ( census )",
    "population size determines how readily adaptive mutations and combinations thereof are discovered but has little influence on coalescent properties and genetic diversity .",

    "in fact , many features are qualitatively different .",
    "negligible drift does not imply that selection is efficient and only beneficial mutations matter . on the contrary",
    ", deleterious mutations can reach high frequency through linkage to favorable backgrounds and the dynamics of genotype frequencies in the population remains very stochastic .",
    "genealogies of samples from populations governed by draft do not follow the standard binary coalescent process .",
    "instead coalescent processes allowing for multiple mergers seem to be appropriate approximations which capture the large and anomalous fluctuations associated with selection .",

    "one central prediction of clonal interference is that the rate of adaptation increases only slowly with the population size @xmath0 and the beneficial mutation rate @xmath18 .",

    "generically , one finds that the rate of adaptation is @xmath20 , where @xmath21 depends on the properties of @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "clonal interference theory places all the emphasis on the mutation with the largest effect and ignores variation in genetic background or equivalently the possibility that multiple mutations accumulate in one lineage .",
    "it is therefore expected to work if the distribution of effect sizes has a long tail allowing for mutations of widely different sizes .",

    "the second term accounts for mutations that move individuals from @xmath27 to @xmath23 at rate @xmath8 . integrating this equation over the fitness @xmath23 yields fisher s `` fundamental theorem of natural selection '' , which states that the rate of increase in mean fitness is @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the variance in fitness and @xmath30 is the average mutation load a genome accumulates in one generation .",
    "a steadily moving mean fitness @xmath31 suggests a traveling wave solution of the form @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the fitness relative to the mean .",

    "most population samples consists of individual from the center of the fitness distribution , while their distant ancestors were among the fittest .",
    "in large populations , most coalescence happens in the high fitness nose and the time until ancestral lineages  arrive \" in the nose corresponds to long terminal branches ( compare panel c ) .",
    "how genealogies depend on selection can be studied using simulations , see http://webdav.tuebingen.mpg.de/interference/coalescence.html[online supplement ] . ]",
    "the rapid coalescence of multiple lineages is unexpected in the standard neutral coalescent ( a merger of @xmath69 lineages occurs with probability @xmath70 ) . in coalescence induced by a selective sweep ,",
    "however , multiple mergers are common and dramatically change the statistical properties of genealogies .",
    "a burst of coalescence corresponds to a portion of the tree with almost star - like shape @xcite .",
    "alleles that arose before the burst are common , those after the burst rare .",
    "this causes a relative increase of rare alleles , as well as alleles very close to fixation @xcite .    the degree to which linked selective sweeps reduce genetic diversity",
    "depends primarily on the rate of sweeps per map length @xcite . in accord with this expectation , it is found that diversity increases with recombination rate and decreases with the density of functional sites @xcite .",
    "in addition to occasional selective sweeps , genetic diversity and the degree of adaptation can be strongly affected by a large number of weakly selected sites , e.g.  weakly deleterious mutations , that generate a broad fitness distribution @xcite .",
    "soft sweeps refer to events when a selective sweep originates from multiple genomic backgrounds @xcite , either because the favored allele arose independently multiple times or because it has been segregating for a long time prior to a environmental change .",
    "soft sweeps have recently been observed in pesticide resistance of drosophila @xcite and are a common phenomenon in viruses with high mutation rates .    a genealogy of individuals sampled after a soft sweep is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : coalescence]b .",
    "the majority of the individuals trace back to one of two or more ancestral haplotypes on which the selected mutation arose .",
    "hence coalescence is again dominated by multiple merger events , except that several of those events happen almost simultaneously .",
    "this type of coalescent process has been described in @xcite .    despite dramatic effects on genealogies",
    ", soft sweeps can be difficult to detect by standard methods that scan for selective sweeps .",
    "those methods use local reductions in genetic diversity , which can be modest if the population traces back to several ancestral haplotypes . the number of ancestral haplotypes in a sample after a soft sweep depends on the product of @xmath0 , the per - site mutations rate @xmath71 , and selection against the allele before the sweep @xcite . to detect soft sweeps",
    ", methods are required that explicitly search for signatures of rapid coalescence into several lineages in linkage disequilibrium or haplotype patterns @xcite .",
    "individual selective sweeps have an intuitive effect on genetic diversity , but what do genealogies look like when many mutations are competing in asexual or facultatively sexual populations ?",
    "it has recently been argued that the genealogies of populations in many models of rapid adaptation are well described by coalescent processes with multiple mergers @xcite .",
    "this was first discovered by @xcite , who studied a model where a population expands its range .",
    "the genealogies of individuals at the front are described by the bolthausen - sznitman coalescent , a special case of coalescent processes with multiple mergers . recently",
    ", it has been shown that a similar coalescent process emerges in models of adaptation in panmictic populations @xcite .",
    "[ fig : coalescence]c shows a tree sampled from a model of a rapidly adapting population .",
    "a typical sample from a rapidly adapting population will consist of individuals from the center of the fitness distribution .",
    "their ancestors tend to be among the fittest in the population @xcite .",
    "substantial coalescence happens only once the ancestral lineages have reached the high fitness tip , resulting in long terminal branches of the trees .",
    "once in the tip , coalescence is driven by the competition of lineages against each other and happens in bursts whenever one lineage gets ahead of everybody else .",
    "these bursts correspond to the event that a large fraction of the population descends from one particular individual .",
    "these coalescent events have approximately the same statistics as neutral coalescent processes with very broad but non - heritable offspring distributions @xcite .    in the case of rapidly adapting asexual populations ,",
    "the effective distribution of the number @xmath72 of offspring is given by @xmath73 which gives rise to the bolthausen - sznitman coalescent .",
    "this type of distribution seems to be universal to populations in which individual lineages are amplified while they diversify and is found in facultatively sexual populations @xcite , asexual populations adapting by small steps , as well as populations in a dynamic balance between deleterious and beneficial mutations .",
    "asymptotic features of the site frequency spectrum can be derived analytically @xcite .",
    "one finds that the frequency spectrum diverges as @xmath74 at low frequencies corresponding to many singletons .",
    "furthermore , neutral alleles close to fixation are common with @xmath75 diverging again as @xmath76 .",
    "this relative excess of rare and very common alleles is a consequence multiple mergers which produce star - like sub - trees and the very asymmetric branching at nodes deep in the tree ( compare fig .",
    "[ fig : coalescence]c ) .",
    "the time scale of coalescence , and with it the level of genetic diversity , is mostly determined by the strength of selection and only weakly increases with population size .",
    "essentially , the average time to a common ancestor of two randomly chosen individuals is given by the time it takes until the fittest individuals dominate the population .",
    "in most models , this time depends only logarithmically on the population size @xmath0 .",
    "background selection refers to the effect of purifying selection on linked loci , which is particularly important if linked regions are long .",
    "if deleterious mutations incur a fitness decrement of @xmath12 and arise with genome wide rate @xmath77 , a sufficiently large population settles in a state where the number of mutations in individuals follows a poisson distribution with mean @xmath78 @xcite .",
    "individuals loaded with many mutations are selected against , but continually produced by de novo mutations .",
    "all individuals in the population ultimately descent from individuals carrying least deleterious mutations . within this model",
    ", the least loaded class has size @xmath79 and coalescence in this class is accelerated by @xmath80 compared to a neutrally evolving population of size @xmath0 @xcite . for large ratios @xmath81 ,",
    "the poisson distribution of background fitness spans a large number of fitness classes and this heterogeneity substantially reduces the efficacy of selection @xcite .",
    "the effect of background selection is best appreciated in a genealogical picture .",
    "genetic backgrounds sampled from the population tend to come from the center of the distribution . since the deleterious mutations they carry were accumulated in the recent past , lineages `` shed '' mutations as we trace them back in time until they arrive in the mutation free class akin to fig .  [",
    "fig : coalescence]d .",
    "this resulting genealogical process , a fitness class coalescent , has been described in @xcite . a recent study on the genetic diversity of whale lice",
    "@xcite suggests that purifying selection and frequent deleterious mutations can severely distort genealogies .",
    "@xcite present methods for the analysis of sequence samples under purifying selection .",
    "the fitness class coalescent is appropriate as long as muller s ratchet does not yet click .",
    "more generally , fixation of deleterious mutations , adaptation , and environmental change will balance approximately .",
    "it has been shown that a small fraction of beneficial mutations can be sufficient to halt muller s ratchet @xcite . in this dynamic balance between frequent deleterious and rare beneficial mutations ,",
    "the genealogies tend to be similar to genealogies under rapid adaptation discussed above .",
    "contradicting neutral theory , genetic diversity correlates only weakly with population size @xcite , suggesting that linked selection or genetic draft are more important than conventional genetic drift .",
    "draft is most severe in asexual populations , for which models predict that the fitness differences rather than the population size determine the level of neutral diversity . as outcrossing becomes more frequent , the strength of draft decreases and diversity increases . with increasing coalescence times",
    ", selection becomes more efficient as there is more time to differentiate deleterious from beneficial alleles . in",
    "obligately sexual populations , most interference is restricted to tightly linked loci and the number of sweeps per map length and generation determines genetic diversity .",
    "since interference slows adaptation , one expects that adaptation can select for higher recombination rates @xcite . indeed , positive selection results in indirect selection on recombination modifiers @xcite .",
    "changing frequencies of outcrossing have been observed in evolution experiments @xcite .",
    "however , the evolution of recombination and outcrossing rates in rapidly adapting populations remains poorly understood , both theoretically and empirically .",
    "the traveling wave models discussed above assume a large number of polymorphisms with similar effects on fitness and a smooth fitness distribution , which are drastic idealizations .",
    "more typically , one finds a handful of polymorphisms with a distribution of effects @xcite .",
    "simulations indicate , however , that statistical properties of genealogies are rather robust regarding model assumptions as long as draft dominates over drift @xcite .",
    "appropriate genealogical models are prerequisite for demographic inference . if , for example , a neutral coalescent model is used to infer the population size history of a rapidly adapting population , one would conclude that the population has been expanding .",
    "incidentally , this is inferred in most cases .",
    "some progress towards incorporating the effect of purifying selection into estimates from reconstructed genealogies has been made recently @xcite .",
    "alternative genealogical models accounting for selection should be included into popular analysis programs such as beast @xcite .",
    "it is still common to assign an `` effective '' size , @xmath3 , to various populations . in most cases , @xmath3 is a proxy for genetic diversity , which depends on the time to the most recent common ancestor . with the realization that coalescence times depend on linked selection and genetic draft , rather than the population size and genetic drift ,",
    "the term should be avoided and replaced by @xmath82 , the time scale of coalescence .",
    "defining @xmath3 suggests that the neutral model is valid as long as @xmath3 is used instead of @xmath0 .",
    "we have seen multiple times that drift and draft are of rather different natures and that this difference can not be captured by a simple rescaling .",
    "each quantity then requires its own private @xmath3 , rendering the concept essentially useless .",
    "some quantities like site frequency spectra are qualitatively different and no @xmath3 maps them to a neutral model .",
    "the ( census ) population size is nevertheless important in discovering beneficial mutations .",
    "for this reason , large populations are expect to respond more quickly to environmental change as we are painfully aware in the case of antibiotic resistance of pathogens .",
    "large populations might therefore track phenotypic optima more closely resulting in beneficial mutations with smaller effect , which in turn might explain their greater diversity .",
    "the majority of models discussed assume a time invariant fitness landscape .",
    "this assumption reflects our ignorance regarding the degree and timescale of environmental fluctuations ( for work on selection in time - dependent fitness landscapes , see @xcite ) .",
    "time - variable selection pressures , combined with spatial variation , could potentially have strong effects .",
    "similarly , frequency - dependent selection and more generally the interaction of evolution with ecology are important avenues for future work .",
    "the challenge consists of choosing useful models that are tractable , appropriate , and predictive .",
