    "graphene , a free - standing flat single layer of carbon atoms , has attracted considerable attention since its experimental discovery  @xcite due to its unique electronic properties .",
    "the conduction and the valence bands in graphene touch each other at zero energy at two inequivalent points , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , in the momentum space .",
    "close to those points charge carriers have a linear isotropic energy spectrum @xmath4  @xcite and behave like relativistic massless dirac particles in @xmath5 dimensions , with the fermi velocity @xmath6  m / s playing the role of the speed of light  @xcite .",
    "this remarkable feature makes graphene different from all other known two - dimensional systems with their usual quadratic dispersion law of charged quasiparticles . for the undoped graphene at zero temperature the valence band",
    "is completely filled ( ` dirac sea ' ) and the conduction band is empty , which corresponds to a zero value of the chemical potential ( fermi energy ) @xmath7 .",
    "the latter can be made non - zero and regulated experimentally by the applied external electric field  @xcite    one of the most important fundamental quantities for understanding physical properties of graphene is the dynamical polarization function @xmath8 which describes the screening of the coulomb potential due to many - body effects and determines the collective excitation modes .",
    "this function for graphene at finite chemical potential and @xmath9 has been calculated in the one - loop approximation in  @xcite .",
    "later , in  @xcite and  @xcite it was obtained for the arbitrary frequency , and the results were used , in particular , to find the dispersion of the plasmon mode within the random phase approximation ( rpa ) .    the present paper deals with the more general case , when a finite gap @xmath10 between the conduction and the valence band exists in graphene , and the charge carriers behave analogously to relativistic massive dirac particles , with the dispersion relation @xmath11 .",
    "such a gap is observed in experiments with graphene placed on the silicon carbide  @xcite or graphite  @xcite substrate ( with the band gap @xmath10 of about 0.26  ev or 10  mev , respectively ) , and is commonly attributed to the sublattice symmetry breaking due to the commensurate perturbation from the substrate . moreover , even in the absence of any substrate , there should still remain a small gap ( @xmath12  mev ) originating from the spin - orbit interaction  @xcite .",
    "the gap can also be generated dynamically by applying an external magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "the dispersion of a plasmon mode for graphene with the finite spin - orbit fermionic gap has been obtained numerically in  @xcite .",
    "our aim is to explore in more detail the influence of the gap on the plasmon dispersion and the static charge screening . in this work",
    "we restrict ourselves to the case of zero temperature and calculate analytically the dynamical polarization function for gapped graphene .",
    "next we find the screened coulomb potential at large distances and the spectrum of plasmons for different values of the dimensionless parameter @xmath13 by solving the dispersion equation with the obtained polarization function .",
    "the low - energy hamiltonian of graphene can be written in a dirac - like form  @xcite , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a four - component wavefunction of charged quasiparticles , the components of which refer to the @xmath16 and @xmath17 sublattices and to two inequivalent valleys in momentum space ( around @xmath2 and @xmath3 points ) .",
    "pauli matrices @xmath18 and @xmath19 act on sublattice and valley components , respectively ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 are unit matrices ) , @xmath22 is a spin index , gamma matrices are defined as @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 is the dirac conjugated spinor .",
    "interaction with a substrate of a certain type may break the sublattice symmetry . in this case",
    "the hamiltonian  ( [ hamiltonian ] ) acquires an additional term @xmath27 which is equivalent to the usual dirac mass term ( in the current representation of @xmath28-matrices ) , and the energy gap @xmath10 opens between the valence and the conduction band .",
    "another gap is driven by a spin - orbit interaction which adds the term @xmath29 to the hamiltonian .",
    "the screening of an instantaneous bare coulomb interaction @xmath30 due to many - body effects is determined by the retarded polarization function @xmath8 or , equivalently , by the dielectric function @xmath31 , resulting in @xmath32 where @xmath33 is an effective background dielectric constant , the average of that of the substrate and that of the vacuum .",
    "note that @xmath8 is defined here in the same way as in  @xcite , which differs from the polarization function used in  @xcite by a factor of @xmath34 .",
    "we consider clean graphene , i.e. the effect of scattering of charge carriers on impurities is not taken into account .",
    "the polarization function is proportional ( with a factor of @xmath35 ) to the time component of the vacuum polarization tensor in a three - dimensional quantum electrodynamics ( qed@xmath36 ) , where @xmath37 is the ` speed of light ' and @xmath38 is a fermion mass .",
    "we calculate @xmath8 analytically in the one - loop approximation .",
    "the exact results are given in the appendix by the equation  ( [ pizeromu ] ) for the case @xmath39 and by the equations  ( [ repi])([impi ] ) for @xmath40 . in what follows",
    "it is assumed that @xmath41 and @xmath42 , taking into account that the polarization function depends only on the absolute value of @xmath7 and @xmath43 .    at small energies and momenta @xmath44 and @xmath40",
    "it is easy to obtain from  ( [ repi ] ) and  ( [ impi ] ) @xmath45 here @xmath46 is the number of fermions in qed@xmath36 ( in the case of graphene @xmath47 due to the spin degeneracy ) .    in the absence of a band gap",

    "this expression is an analytic function of @xmath50 without singularities in the whole upper complex half - plane .",

    ", @xmath58 is the same as in gapless graphene  @xcite @xmath59 and decays under the same @xmath1 law as in an ordinary non - relativistic two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg )  @xcite .",
    "the second contribution is oscillatory ( friedel oscillations ) and comes from the non - analyticity of the polarization function  ( [ pizerofrequency ] ) at @xmath60 where its derivative is discontinuous ( for @xmath61 ) .",
    "these oscillations @xmath62 decay as @xmath0 as in a 2deg  @xcite and slower than in gapless graphene where they obey the @xmath1 law  @xcite .",
    "the reason for this difference is that at @xmath63 the polarization function at @xmath60 has a discontinuity only in the second derivative , in contrast to the case of the gapped graphene and 2deg .    at @xmath64 ,",
    "the static limit of  ( [ pizeromu ] ) reads @xmath65 ( compare with equation ( 14 ) in  @xcite ) , and the induced charge density  ( [ inddensity ] ) at large distances , which is determined by the long - wavelength behaviour of  ( [ pizerofreqmu ] ) , @xmath66 decays as @xmath1  @xcite , @xmath67 the potential at large distances for this case @xmath68 in the main order remains screened only by the substrate .",

    "we solve  ( [ complexeqn ] ) numerically , using analytical continuation of  ( [ repi])([impi ] ) from the real @xmath50 axis into the lower complex half - plane .",
    "when the damping of the collective mode is weak , the approximate equation @xmath82 is often solved  @xcite instead of  ( [ complexeqn ] ) and the decay rate , which is assumed to be small , is determined from another equation , @xmath83 the numerical solutions of equations  ( [ complexeqn ] ) ( for the frequency and the damping rate ) and  ( [ realeqn ] ) together with the approximate analytical solution  ( [ dispsmallk ] ) are plotted in fig .",

    "the gap dependence of the plasmon spectrum described above is also shown in fig .",

    "indeed , the dispersion equation  ( [ dispeqn ] ) can be satisfied only when @xmath92 , and it can be shown from  ( [ repi0 ] ) that @xmath93 in the region where @xmath94 is real ( however , for the gapless case this conclusion was shown to be an artefact of the rpa approximation  @xcite , and the ladder corrections to polarization function lead to the existence of the undamped plasmon mode even at @xmath95 ) .    in those regions where the solutions of equations  ( [ complexeqn ] ) and  ( [ realeqn ] ) are close to each other , the decay rate given by  ( [ dampingrate ] ) is small and does not differ significantly from @xmath28 obtained from  ( [ complexeqn ] ) .",
    "when the solutions move away from each other , it turns out that the expression  ( [ dampingrate ] ) is not small , and the approximate equations  ( [ realeqn ] ) and  ( [ dampingrate ] ) are not valid .",
    "in particular , the lower branch which appears for @xmath61 and lies fully in the intraband spe region ( figs .  [ figure1](b)-(e ) ) is merely an artefact of this approximation .",

    "[ figure1](c ) was obtained for the case of zero temperature .",
    "we have calculated analytically the one - loop polarization function in the presence of a finite gap in the spectrum of dirac quasiparticles .",
    "the result is expressed in terms of elementary functions and is valid for arbitrary wavevector , frequency , doping , and gap .",
    "the obtained expression is employed to calculate the static screening of coulomb potential and the spectrum of plasmons within the rpa approximation .",
    "the oscillating part of the screened potential decays slower than in the gapless graphene , while the non - oscillating part is the same .",
    "it turns out that collective plasmon modes are present only at @xmath96 , i.e. when the fermi level lies outside the gap . at long wavelengths",
    "the plasmon dispersion shows the usual square root dependence for 2d systems . at non - zero gap ,",
