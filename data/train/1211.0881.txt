    "light - matter coupling is an area of research emerging at the boundary between condensed matter physics and optics which has both fundamental and applied dimensions .",
    "the possibility of reaching the regime of strong coupling , for which confined cavity photons and matter excitations are strongly mixed , is of particular interest.@xcite in this situation a new type of elementary excitations , known as polaritons , appear in the system . having a hybrid nature , they combine the properties of both light and matter .",
    "several geometries have been proposed for the realization of the strong coupling regime .",
    "the interaction of a cavity photon mode with a two - level system which mimics optical transitions in an individual atom or single quantum dot ( qd ) is the origin of cavity quantum electrodynamics ( cavity qed).@xcite one should note that the achievement of strong coupling in such a system is a non - trivial task due to a rather small light - matter interaction constant .",
    "however , recent advances in nanotechnology have led to the possibility of creating high - finesse optical cavities and have resulted in the observation of rabi doublets and mollow triplets in the emission spectrum of individual qds.@xcite moreover , the strong coupling of a single photon to a superconducting qubit , which has a two - level structure as well , has been demonstrated in a radio - wave superconducting cavity.@xcite    to increase light - matter coupling , quantum wells ( qws ) can be used instead of individual qds . in this case , coupling occurs between a two - dimensional ( 2d ) qw exciton , associated with a sharp absorption peak slightly below the bandgap energy , and a photonic mode of a planar cavity tuned in resonance with it .",
    "observed for the first time two decades ago,@xcite exciton - polariton physics is now experiencing increased interest connected to the possible realization of polariton lasing with an extremely low threshold,@xcite and the achievement of bose - einstein condensates@xcite ( becs ) , and superfluid states @xcite for temperatures much higher than for atomic systems@xcite and cold excitons in solids.@xcite this is a consequence of the small effective mass of polaritons which allows a pronounced manifestation of quantum collective phenomena for a critical temperature around 20 k in cdte structures @xcite and even at room temperatures in wide - band - gap materials with large exciton binding energy and strong light - matter interaction ( gan , zno).@xcite additionally , polaritons have been proposed as basic ingredients for spinoptronic devices@xcite and all - optical logical elements and integrated circuits.@xcite    while most attention in the field of exciton polaritons is drawn to two - dimensional structures , the strong light - matter interaction of excitons in one - dimensional nanowires with a confined cavity mode has also been studied.@xcite their properties were shown to be improved over the exciton - polaritons analogs in the quantum wells due to their larger exciton binding energy.@xcite however , the physics of light matter coupling remains essentially the same .",
    "another system where strong light - matter coupling was experimentally achieved is the intersubband transitions in quantum wells .",
    "it was shown by dini and co - workers@xcite that the absorption of intersubband resonance placed into a cavity reveals the characteristic anti - crossing behavior .",
    "the attractive peculiarity of such a system in comparison to those based on conventional interband exciton - polaritons is a non - vanishing ratio of the rabi frequency to the transition energy , which enables an exploration of the ultra - strong - coupling regime.@xcite in addition , unlike interband transitions in a 2d system , strong electron - hole interactions and the formation of excitons are not necessary for obtaining the strong coupling regime,@xcite although they play a certain role in structures with highly doped qws , where the formation of intersubband plasmon - polaritons@xcite and fermi edge polaritons @xcite can be observed .    for any experimental geometry , the main condition which must be satisfied to drive",
    "the system into strong coupling is the presence of a narrow resonance in its photoabsorption spectrum .",
    "mathematically , this condition reads @xmath0 where @xmath1 denotes the light - matter coupling strength , @xmath2 is the corresponding rabi frequency ( the light - matter interaction constant ) , @xmath3 is the damping constant of the cavity mode and @xmath4 is the width of the absorption resonance.@xcite in 2d interband absorption this condition requires strong exciton - hole attraction resulting in the formation of an exciton .",
    "however , in the 1d case this is not strictly speaking necessary , since the behavior of the density of states @xmath5 in 2d and 1d is qualitatively different . in the former case ,",
    "the density of states is constant , while in the latter it diverges around the points @xmath6 at which the energy as a function of the momentum @xmath7 reaches its minimum , @xmath8 this peculiarity , known as a van hove singularity , makes the optical properties of 1d nanostructures different from those of the bulk and 2d cases and leads to the resonant character of photoabsorption even without any excitonic effects .    in this article",
    "we analyze the possibility of the realization of the strong - coupling regime between a cavity photon and the interband transition of a one - dimensional nanowire driven by the presence of the van hove singularity in the 1d density of states .",
    "we consider the case of the cavity mode tuned to the interband transition , while the 1d exciton is detuned far from the resonance and thus does not affect the properties of the system in the frequency range we consider .",
    "the demonstrated spectrum of the elementary excitation reveals anti - crossing behavior characteristic of the formation of polaritonic modes for realistic cavity quality factors .",
    "we show that this effect is robust against both finite temperature and interaction corrections .",

    "finally , we should note that semiconductor quantum wires can be replaced by carbon nanotubes , which are commonly synthesized in bundles@xcite or can be arranged in well - aligned arrays.@xcite in general , excitonic effects are very important in semiconducting carbon nanotubes , as the presence of strongly bound dark excitons results in luminescence suppression.@xcite however , tuning the cavity mode to the nanotube s van hove singularity should significantly improve light - matter coupling .",
    "in quasi - metallic nanotubes with small curvature - induced band gaps and in metallic ( armchair ) nanotubes with magnetic - field - induced gaps , excitonic effects can be neglected;@xcite so that our theory of van hove polaritons becomes directly applicable .",
    "narrow - gap carbon nanotubes have recently attracted significant attention as promising candidates for terahertz applications.@xcite metallic nanotubes with magnetic - field - induced gaps are of a particular interest , since their spectra can be easily tuned by an external magnetic field . their similarity to a two - level system is further enhanced by the fast decrease of the dipole transition matrix element away from the field - induced band gap.@xcite another system , for which the developed theory is highly relevant is a bulk semiconductor with van hove singularities resulting from quasi - one - dimensional motion along a quantizing magnetic field .",
    "carbon nanotubes in microcavities in both the optical and terahertz frequency ranges as well as bulk materials with magnetic - field - induced van hove singularities are subjects of our future work .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied the light - matter coupling of a microcavity photon and an interband transition in a 1d nanowire . due to the resonant character of the absorption spectrum provided by the van hove singularity of the 1d density of states , the achievement of the strong coupling regime becomes possible even in the absence of excitonic effects .",
    "we have calculated the dispersions of the resulting polariton modes and the absorption spectra of the coupled wire - cavity system for realistic values of parameters .",
    "we have examined the influence of coulomb corrections and have shown that 1d van hove polaritons are robust against temperature changes and can exist even at room temperature .",
