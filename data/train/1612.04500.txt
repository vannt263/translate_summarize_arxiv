    "<S> producing and maintaining entanglement reside at the heart of the optimal construction of quantum operations and are fundamental issues in the realization of universal quantum computation . </S>",
    "<S> we here introduce a setup of spin qubits that allows for geometric implementation of entangling gates between the register qubits with any arbitrary entangling power . </S>",
    "<S> we show this by demonstrating a circuit through a spin chain , which performs universal non - adiabatic holonomic two - qubit entanglers . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed gates are all electric and geometric , which would help to realize fast and robust entangling gates on spin qubits . </S>",
    "<S> this family of entangling gates contains gates that are as efficient as cnot gate in quantum algorithms . </S>"
