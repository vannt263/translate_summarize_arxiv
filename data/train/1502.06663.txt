    "light curves of gravitational microlensing events are characterized by a smooth , symmetric , and non - repeating shape @xcite .",
    "however , they often exhibit deviations from the standard form .",
    "the causes of the deviations include the binarity of either lensing objects ( binary - lens events : * ? ? ? * ) or lensed source stars ( binary - source events : * ? ? ?",
    "deviations can also arise due to higher - order effects caused by the finite size of a source star ( finite - source effect : * ? ? ? * ) and the positional changes of the observer ( parallax effect : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , lens ( lens - orbital effect : * ? ? ?",

    "is important because it provides useful information about the lenses and lensed stars . by analyzing the light curve of a binary - lens event",
    ", one can obtain information about the mass ratio between the lens components .",
    "analyzing the light curve of a binary - source event yields the flux ratio between the binary - source components .",
    "if finite - source and parallax effects are simultaneously detected , one can uniquely determine the physical parameters of the lens including the mass and distance to the lens @xcite .",
    "however , interpretation of anomalous lensing events is difficult due to various reasons .",
    "one important reason is the degeneracy problem where lensing solutions based on different interpretations result in a similar anomaly pattern .",
    "for example , it is known that binary - lens and binary - source solutions can often result in a similar anomaly pattern @xcite . even if an anomaly is identified to be caused by a binary lens ,",
    "@xmath0 distributions in the space of the lensing parameters are usually complex due to the nonlinear dependence of lensing magnifications on the parameters and thus there often exist multiple local minima resulting in similar anomaly patterns .    for the correct interpretation of lensing event by resolving the degeneracy problem ,",
    "dense and continuous coverage of lensing light curves is important .",
    "good coverage data are also important in extracting extra information about lenses and lensed stars by detecting subtle deviations caused by higher - order effects . in order to obtain correct interpretations of events and maximize information about lens systems , therefore , it is important to test all possible causes of anomalies based on all available data .",

    "see more details in section 4 .",
    "data sets used for the analyses were processed using the photometry codes developed by the individual groups .",
    "since the individual data sets were obtained by using different telescopes , it is needed to readjust their error bars .",

    "the other term @xmath10 is a scaling factor used to make @xmath0 per degree of freedom ( dof ) becomes unity .",
    "this process is needed to ensure that each data set is fairly weighted according to its error bars .",
    "light curves of binary - lens events are generally characterized by distinct sharp spikes occurring at the moments of caustic crossings . for events with such features ( ogle-2006-blg-215 , ogle-2006-blg-238 ,",
    "ogle-2006-blg-450 , and ogle-2008-blg-513 ) , we conduct binary - lens analyses . on the other hand , light curves of binary - lens events without caustic crossings",
    "do not exhibit such features and the resulting anomalies can often be imitated by those of binary - source events . for such events ( ogle-2007-blg-159 , ogle-2007-blg-491 , ogle-2008-blg-143 , and ogle-2008-blg-210 ) , we conduct both binary - source and binary - lens analyses .    in the analyses , we consider higher - order effects .",
    "the first such an effect is caused by the finite size of the source star .",
    "for binary - lens events , this effect is important for caustic - crossing parts of the light curve where lensing magnifications vary abruptly with a small change of the source position and thus differential magnification on the surface of the source star becomes important . among the analyzed binary - lens events , caustic crossings were resolved by the ogle data for only one event ( ogle-2006-blg-215 ) , while caustics were resolved with combined data for all caustic - crossing events .",
    "we also consider the effects caused by the parallactic motion of the earth and the orbital motion of lenses .",
    "these effects are important for long time - scale events where the duration of the event is equivalent to the orbital period of the earth and lenses .",
    "modeling lensing events requires parameters that describe observed light curves .",
    "the light curve of a single - lens event is described by 3 parameters .",
    "they are the time of the closest approach of the source to the reference position of the lens , @xmath11 , the lens - source separation at that moment , @xmath12 ( impact parameter ) , and the event time scale , @xmath13 , which is defined as the time for the source to cross the einstein radius of the lens .",
    "the einstein radius is related to the physical parameters of the lens system by @xmath14 where @xmath15 , _ m _ is the total mass of the lens , @xmath16 is the relative source - lens parallax , and @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the distances to the lens and source , respectively .",
    "the einstein radius is used as a length scale in describing lensing phenomenon and @xmath12 is normalized by @xmath19 .",
    "the light curve of a binary - source event corresponds to the linear sum of the fluxes from the two single - source events involved with the individual source stars .",
    "then , describing the light curve requires two values of @xmath11 ( @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) and @xmath12 ( @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) but a single time scale because it is related only to the lens .",
    "one additional parameter is the flux ratio @xmath24 between the source components .    in order to model a binary - lens event ,",
    "additional parameters are needed to describe the lens binarity .",
    "they are the projected separation @xmath25 and the mass ratio @xmath26 between the lens components .",
    "we note that the separation is normalized by @xmath19 . due to the lens binarity ,",
    "positions around the lens are no longer radially symmetric .",
    "then , one needs an additional parameter @xmath27 designating the angle between the source trajectory and the line connecting the binary lens components ( source trajectory angle ) .",
