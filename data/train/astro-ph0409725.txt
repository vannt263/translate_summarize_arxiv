    "abundance determinations of stars in galactic globular clusters can provide valuable information about important astrophysical processes such as stellar evolution , stellar structure , galactic chemical evolution and the formation of the milky way .",
    "surface stellar abundances of c , n , o , and often na , mg , and al are found to be variable among red giants within a globular cluster .",
    "the physical process responsible for these star - to - star element variations is still uncertain ( see the reviews of kraft 1994 and pinsonneault 1997 , as well as cohen , briley & stetson 2002 and ventura _ et al . _  2001 ) .    in order to study the origin of the star - to - star abundance variations",
    ", we started a program to determine chemical abundances of the nearer galactic globular cluster stars .",
    "in previous papers in this series , we studied a sample of 25 stars in m71 , the nearest globular cluster reachable from the northern hemisphere @xcite , followed by a similar sized sample in m5 , the nearest intermediate metallicity globular cluster accessible from a northern hemisphere site @xcite .",
    "our sample in each cluster includes stars over a large range in luminosity , in order to study in a consistent manner red giants , horizontal branch stars , and stars at the main sequence turnoff .",
    "we measured the iron abundance and the abundance ratios for @xmath520 elements with respect to fe in each case , using high dispersion ( r=@xmath2=35,000 ) optical spectra obtained with hires at the keck observatory .",
    "we found that the [ fe / h ]  abundances is given by @xmath6 on a scale where @xmath7 h atoms . then [ x / h ] = log@xmath8[n(x)/n(h ) ] @xmath9 log@xmath8[n(x)/n(h ) ] , and similarly for [ x / fe ] . ] from both fe i and fe ii lines agree with each other and with earlier determinations and that the [ fe / h ]  obtained from fe i and fe ii lines is constant within the rather small uncertainties over the full range in effective temperature ( @xmath3 ) and luminosity @xcite .",
    "we also found that the neutron capture , the iron peak and the @xmath10element abundance ratios show no trend with @xmath3 , and low scatter around the mean between the top of the rgb and near the main sequence turnoff in each cluster .",
    "we detected an anti - correlation between o and na abundances in our sample of members of m71 which extends to the main sequence .",
    "we observed a statistically significant correlation in m5 between al and na abundances extending to @xmath11 , fainter than the luminosity of the rgb bump in m5 .",
    "we merged our data with data compiled from the literature for the na  o anticorrelation seen among globular cluster stars to find that the slope of this relation is the same for all clusters studied to date , but the amplitude of the effect varies from cluster to cluster .    in the present paper , we study a sample of stars in m3 and in m13 , globular clusters of even lower metallicity than m5 , again covering a wide range in luminosity .",
    "there are many photometric studies of these two clusters as they are the classic second parameter pair , having similar abundances yet very different horizontal branch morphologies .",
    "those which were utilized in the present work are noted in  [ section_photometry ] .",
    "the most important characteristic of the globular cluster m13 as compared to m71 and m5 is that m13 is well known to show unusually large star - to - star differences in abundance of al , mg , na and o among its red giants ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ". a study of c and n variations among a large sample of m13 stars from the tip of the red giant branch to the main sequence turnoff is given in @xcite ; large star - to - star differences in c and n abundances were found .",
    "m3 , on the other hand , resembles m5 and m71 in being relatively inactive in this regard , although its metallicity is quite close to that of m13 .",
    "m3 and m13 have been the subject of several previous high dispersion analyses , beginning with that of @xcite .",
    "@xcite have recently presented a high dispersion study of 28 red giants in m3 to confirm the lower level of star - to - star variations in this cluster in contrast to m13 ; they compare their results with the older work of their group on both m3 and m13 , see , e.g. @xcite .",
    "m3 is more distant than m5 or m71 , and we made no effort to reach the main sequence turnoff in this cluster , although our sample reaches far down the rgb . for m13 , which is at a distance comparable to that of m5",
    ", we reach close to the main sequence turnoff .",
    "to the maximum extent possible , the observing strategy , the atomic data and the analysis procedures used here are identical to those developed in our earlier papers on m71 and on m5 ( cohen , behr & briley 2001 ; ramrez _ et al . _  2001",
    "; ramrez & cohen 2002 ; ramrez & cohen 2003 )      stars were chosen to span the range from the tip of the red giant branch to the base of the subgiant branch in m13 and to well below the rgb bump in m3 . both of these clusters lie far from the galactic plane , hence field star contamination is minimal .",
    "the photometric database of @xcite and @xcite , which is described in considerable detail in @xcite , was used to verify that the selected stars lie on the cluster locus in various color - magnitude diagrams .",
    "this database , in the form available at the time , only included small sections of the solid angle required to fully cover each of these two clusters .",
    "pairs were selected in m3 for which both stars lie below the luminosity of the rgb bump and appear , based on their broad band colors , to be members . a separation of less than 9 arcsec was required .",
    "only reasonably isolated stars were selected . to this we added a sample of bright giants ,",
    "most of which were selected to span the full range in na and/or o abundances from @xcite . throughout this paper ,",
    "the star names are from @xcite for the brightest stars in m3 , from @xcite for the two bright stars near the center of m3 not included in the former work , or , for the stars previously not cataloged , are assigned based on the object s j2000 coordinates , so that a star with ra , dec of 13 rm rs.s + 28 dm ds is identified in this paper with the name crmrss_dmds . for m13 , the primary source of star identifications is @xcite ( see also * ? ? ? * ) . for the m13 stars",
    "not previously cataloged , names are assigned based on the object s j2000 coordinates , so that a star with ra , dec of 16 rm rs.s + 36 dm ds is identified in this paper with the name crmrss_dmds .",
    "our sample in m3 totals 13 stars , including 5 on the rgb well below the luminosity of the hb and one rhb star .",
    "figure  [ figure_m3cmd ] shows the sample in m3 superposed on a color - magnitude diagram of this globular cluster .",
    "eight pairs of stars were selected for observation in m13 using criteria similar to those used for the m3 pairs .",
    "two of the 16 stars turned out not to be members of m13 , and two others are horizontal branch stars too hot to analyze .",
    "these members of m13 reach to v=17.9 mag .",
    "in addition , 13 bright giants were observed , chosen to have previous observations of [ c / fe ] and of [ n / fe ] from @xcite or from @xcite .",
    "this sample include stars covering the full range of na , mg and al abundances found in m13 by @xcite .",
    "figure  [ figure_m13cmd ] shows the sample in m13 superposed on a color - magnitude diagram of this globular cluster .    our sample in m13 totals 25 stars reaching from the tip of the rgb to almost the main sequence turnoff , plus two hot hb stars which we have not attempted to analyze .",
    "all spectra were obtained with hires @xcite at the keck observatory . in may 2001 , we observed with an instrumental configuration similar to that used in our earlier globular cluster work . the wavelength range from 5500 to 7800    was covered with gaps between the orders due to the undersized hires detector .",
    "we wanted to include key lines of critical elements , specifically the 6300 , 6363 [ oi ] lines , the 7770 o triplet , the na doublet at 6154 , 6160 , and the 6696 , 6698  al i lines .",
    "however , it was impossible to create a single instrumental configuration which included all the desired spectral features in the wavelength range 6000 to 8000  , and a single compromise configuration had to be adopted .",
    "in particular , although the 6696 , 6698  al i doublet is the most useful feature of that element in this spectral region , we could not get it to fit into a single hires setting together with the o lines . a 1.1 arcsec wide slit , corresponding to a spectral resolution of 34,000 , was used .",
    "a maximum slit length of 14 arc sec can be used with this instrumental configuration without orders overlapping .",
    "however , we found that covering beyond 7000   , while highly desirable to reach the o  i triplet , added little else of interest in the spectra of these low metallicity stars .",
    "thus for the june 2003 observations ( the spring 2002 run being totally lost to weather ) , we shifted the instrument configuration toward the blue , covering the range 4650 to 7010   , again with small gaps between the orders .",
    "the maximum slit length without orders overlapping at the blue end of the spectrum is then reduced to 7 arcsec .",
    "we call these two instrument configurations the `` yellow '' and the `` red '' configurations .",
    "since an image rotator for hires is available ( built under the leadership of david tytler ) , if we can find pairs of program stars with suitable separations , they can be observed together on a single exposure .",
    "pairs were pre - selected as described above to contain two members of the fainter m3 stars . in may 2001 ,",
    "three ( 6 ) pairs of m3 ( m13 ) stars were observed with hires using the `` red '' setting .",
    "one of the six stars in the m3 pairs turned out to be a red horizontal branch star . in june 2003 ,",
    "two of the pairs in m3 as well as seven bright giants were reobserved at higher snr using the `` yellow '' setting ; the third pair was too far apart for this hires configuration .",
    "for m13 , two of the pairs were reobserved in june or august 2003 , as were two new pairs as well as several bright giants with the `` yellow '' hires configuration .",
    "the desired minimum snr was 75 over a 4 pixel resolution element for a wavelength near the center of the hires detector .",
    "this is calculated strictly from the counts in the object spectrum , and excludes noise from cosmic ray hits , sky subtraction , flattening problems , etc . since the nights were relatively dark , sky subtraction is not an issue except at the specific wavelengths corresponding to strong night sky emission lines , such as the na d doublet .",
    "this snr goal was achieved for most of the stars reported here ; see table  [ table_sample_m13 ] for details regarding the faintest stars in the m13 sample .",
    "note that for a fixed snr in the continuum , for a star of a given luminosity , the lower metallicity of these clusters leads to weaker absorption lines , making it difficult to maintain the desired precision of the analysis .",
    "it is this which led to the repeat spectra with the `` yellow '' hires configuration .",
    "the magnitude of the cluster radial velocity is large for both m3 and m13 , and the cluster abundances are low .",
    "it was easy to tell after one integration whether or not a star is a member of the cluster .",
    "approximate measurements of the radial velocity were made on line , and if a star was determined to be a non - member , the observations were terminated .",
    "very few non - members turned up in this way . if the probable non - member was the second component in a pair , an attempt was made to switch to another position angle to pick up a different second star , when a possible candidate that was bright enough was available within the maximum allowed separation .",
    "these data were reduced using a combination of figaro scripts and the software package makee .",
    "table  [ table_sample ] gives details of the hires exposures for each star , with the total exposure time for each object .",
    "all long integrations were broken up into separate exposures , each 1200 sec long , to optimize cosmic ray removal .",
    "the last column of the table gives the heliocentric radial velocity for each star , measured from the hires spectra ; see @xcite for the details of the procedure used to determine @xmath12 . based on their measured @xmath12 ,",
    "the 13 stars of our sample are all members of m3 .",
    "they have a mean @xmath12 of @xmath13 km  s@xmath14 , which agrees exactly with the value of @xcite .",
    "the velocity dispersion of our sample in m3 is @xmath15 = 4.7@xmath161 km  s@xmath14 , which when the instrumental contribution is removed is about 4.4 km  s@xmath14 .",
    "this is comparable to the value of 5.6  km  s@xmath14obtained by @xcite and by @xcite .",
    "for the 27 stars in m13 in our sample , the mean @xmath12 is @xmath17 km  s@xmath14 , with @xmath18 km  s@xmath14 .",
    "this is identical to the velocity dispersion obtained by @xcite from a sample of more than 130 bright giants .",
    "based on their hires spectra , stars c41262_2248 ( v=15.6 ) and c40560_2847 are not members of m13 .",
    "the search for absorption features present in our hires data and the measurement of their equivalent width ( @xmath19 ) was done automatically with a fortran code , ewdet , developed for our globular cluster project .",
    "details of this code and its features are described in @xcite . because m3 and m13 are considerably more metal poor than m5 or m71 , the determination of the continuum level was easier , and the equivalent widths measured",
    "automatically should be more reliable .",
    "the initial list of unblended atomic lines and their atomic parameters was adopted from our work on m5 , where it was created by inspection of the spectra of m5 stars , as well as the online solar spectrum taken with the fts at the national solar observatory of @xcite and the set of solar line identifications of @xcite .",
    "the list of lines identified and measured by ewdet was then correlated , taking the radial velocity into account , to the template list of suitable unblended lines to specifically identify the various atomic lines .",
    "the automatic identifications were accepted as valid for lines with @xmath19  @xmath20 m .",
    "they were checked by hand for all lines with smaller @xmath19  and for all the rare earths .",
    "the equivalent widths of the o i lines were measured by hand , since they were generally very weak .",
    "the resulting @xmath19  for @xmath5320 lines in the spectra of the 13 stars in m3 are listed in table  [ table_eqw_m3 ] .",
    "@xmath19  for the 25 stars in m13 are listed in tables  [ table_eqw_m13_1 ] and table  [ table_eqw_m13_2 ] . note that lines with @xmath19@xmath21  mare not generally tabulated and are not used unless there are no other available lines of that species .",
    "the provenance of the @xmath22 values and damping constants we adopt in our analysis of m3 and m13 stars is discussed below . in general ,",
    "the atomic data and the analysis procedures used here are identical to those developed in our recent paper on m5 @xcite .",
    "transition probabilities for the fe i lines were obtained from several laboratory experiments , including studies of fe i absorption lines produced by iron vapor in a carbon tube furnace @xcite ( oxford group ) , measurement of radiative lifetimes of fe i transitions by laser induced fluorescence @xcite , fe i emission line spectroscopy from a low current arc @xcite , and emission lines of fe i from a shock tube @xcite .",
    "we also considered solar @xmath22 values from @xcite when needed .",
    "the fe i @xmath22 values obtained by the different experiments were placed into a common scale with respect to the results from @xcite ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the @xmath22 values for our fe ii lines were taken from the solar analysis of @xcite , @xcite , and from the semi - empirical calculations of @xcite .",
    "for fe i and fe ii @xmath22 values , we used the same priority order for the @xmath22 values from different experiments as in @xcite .",
    "transition probabilities for the lines of atomic species other than iron were obtained from the nist atomic spectra database ( nist standard reference database # 78 , see @xcite ) when possible .",
    "nearly 80% of the lines selected as suitable from the hires spectra have transition probabilities from the nist database . for the remaining lines the @xmath22 values come from the inverted solar analysis of @xcite , with the exception of la  ii , nd  ii and eu  ii lines , for which we have updated our values to those of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "six elements show hyperfine structure splitting ( sc ii , v i , mn i , co i , cu i , and ba ii ) .",
    "the corresponding hyperfine structure constants were taken from @xcite .",
    "for ba  ii , we adopt the hfs from @xcite .",
    "we use the laboratory spectroscopy of @xcite and @xcite to calculate the hfs patterns for la  ii and for eu  ii .",
    "we use the damping constants of @xcite which were calculated based on the theory of anstee , barklem & omara @xcite when available .",
    "if there is no entry in their database , as in our earlier work , the damping constants were set to twice that of the unsld approximation for van der waals broadening following @xcite .",
    "the regime in which we are operating is so metal poor that we can not in general attempt to calculate solar abundances corresponding to our particular choices of atomic data because the lines seen in these metal poor globular cluster stars are far too strong in the sun .",
    "we must therefore rely on the accuracy of the @xmath22 values for each element across the large relevant range of line strength and wavelength .",
    "we adopt the solar abundances of @xcite for most elements . for ti and for sr",
    ", we adopt the slightly modified values given in @xcite .",
    "for the special cases of la  ii , nd  ii and eu  ii we use the results found by the respective recent laboratory studies cited above . for mg ,",
    "we adopt the slightly updated value suggested by @xcite , ignoring the small suggested non - lte and granulation corrections , since we do not implement such in our analyses .",
    "there is considerable controversy regarding the abundances of the cno elements in the sun , with the recent results of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite being considerably ( @xmath50.2 dex ) lower than those of @xcite and somewhat lower than those of @xcite .",
    "we have derived an inverse solar o abundance for our particular choice of atomic data and of model atmospheres using both the forbidden doublet at 6300,6363    and the triplet at 7770   .",
    "the equivalent widths of these lines in the sun were measured from the solar atlas of @xcite , and checked in the mcdonald observatory solar spectrum used by @xcite .",
    "corrections for the contribution of the ni  i line for the 6300    line @xcite and the cn lines for the 6363    line @xcite were made .",
    "we adopted the o abundance from [ oi ] ; after applying a non - lte correction interpolated from the calculations of @xcite , the o abundance from the triplet lines is only 0.05 dex smaller than derived from the forbidden lines .",
    "we adopt log@xmath23(fe ) = 7.45 dex for iron following the revisions in the solar photospheric abundances suggested by @xcite and by @xcite .",
    "this value is somewhat lower than that given by @xcite and considerably lower than that recommended by @xcite .",
    "some papers in the literature use the @xcite value and some older ones use 7.67 dex , the value recommended by @xcite . in such cases , their values of [ fe / h ] will be 0.1 to 0.2 dex smaller than ours while their abundance ratios [ x / fe ] the same amount larger than ours .",
    "table  [ table_sun ] gives the solar abundances used here .",
    "we follow the philosophy developed in our earlier work on globular cluster stars and described in @xcite .",
    "@xmath3  is derived by comparing reddening - corrected broad band colors with the predictions of grids of model atmospheres .",
    "we utilize here the grid of predicted broad band colors and bolometric corrections of @xcite based on the marcs stellar atmosphere code of @xcite . in @xcite",
    "we demonstrated that the kurucz and marcs predicted colors are essentially identical , at least for the specific colors used here .",
    "we adopt current values from the on - line database of @xcite for the distances of 10.4 ( 7.5 ) kpc for m3 ( m13 ) with a reddening of e(b  v ) = 0.01 ( 0.02 ) mag .",
    "the relative extinction in various passbands is taken from @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "based on the earlier high dispersion analyses of @xcite and @xcite , we adopt as an initial guess [ fe / h ] = @xmath91.5 dex for these two globular clusters .",
    "our primary source for optical photometry is the bvi database of stetson @xcite .",
    "all the bright giants in m3 except vz  1000 and vz  1397 , which are too close to the center of this cluster , are included there .",
    "all components of the pairs except v-30 + v-31 , which are too far from the center of m3 , are included as well .",
    "photometry for the missing stars was obtained from @xcite , @xcite , @xcite or @xcite , with preference given to the most recent study .    for m13 , we used ( in order of preference ) the optical photometry of @xcite , @xcite @xcite , and stetson @xcite .",
    "after a small adjustment in the zero point of the ( uncalibrated ) photometry of @xcite , the agreement between the various datasets is reasonable .",
    "the area in m13 covered by the work of @xcite , @xcite and by @xcite does not overlap with our stars , nor does that of the ir photometry of @xcite and of @xcite .",
    "we only used v and i magnitudes from these sources , combining them with j and k photometry from 2mass @xcite .",
    "this worked extremely well for the bright giants , with a scatter in deduced @xmath3  from v - i , v - j and v - k of under 40  k. the fainter stars in our sample ( i.e. the pairs ) show much larger scatter in their deduced @xmath3  from the various colors .",
    "these stars are too crowded ( and in some cases rather faint ) for 2mass , which uses an aperture size of 2 arcsec .",
    "this problem is more serious in m13 , as our sample reaches fainter there than in m3 ; a large fraction of the pairs observed in m13 had no entry or only a single entry in the 2mass database .",
    "to get around this problem , in april , 2004 we observed the fields of the fainter stars in our samples in both m3 and m13 with the wide field infrared camera @xcite at the 5-m hale telescope for the purpose of establishing reliable j , k magnitudes for the fainter stars in our sample .",
    "the 2mass colors of nearby isolated somewhat brighter stars were used to calibrate our wirc photometry .",
    "this new infrared photometry for only the pairs in m3 and m13 is listed in table  [ table_irphot ] .",
    "the agreement with 2mass is very good for the brighter , wider pairs .    with improved infrared photometry in hand , the observed broad band colors v - i",
    ", v - j and v - k for each program star from the sources listed above , corrected for extinction , were used to determine @xmath3 .",

    "we assume a random photometric error of 0.02 mag applies to @xmath24 from @xcite .",
    "following @xcite , this translates into a total uncertainty in @xmath3  of 75 k for giants rising to 150 k for main sequence stars using only @xmath24 .",
    "the errors in @xmath3  deduced from v - j or v - k are about a factor of two smaller .",
    "we have slightly smoothed the @xmath3  for the fainter stars in our sample by small amounts to ensure that stars at the approximately same evolutionary stage have approximately the same stellar parameters .",
    "once an initial guess at @xmath3  has been established from a broad band color , it is possible with minimal assumptions to evaluate log(@xmath25 )  using observational data .",
    "the adopted distance modulus for the cluster , initial guess at @xmath3  for the star , and an assumed stellar mass ( we adopt 0.8 @xmath26for the stars in m3 and in m13 ) are combined with the known interstellar absorption , the bolometric corrections predicted by the model atmosphere grid , as well as a broad band observed @xmath27 mag to calculate log(@xmath25 ) .",

    "the correlations among the elements showing such star - to - star variations suggest that cn and , especially for m13 , on burning , as well namg burning are required .",

    "our main contributions are twofold .",
    "we have confirmed with quite high precision that the sum of c+n+o is constant near the tip of the giant branch as shown by @xcite but we extend this down to the bump in the luminosity function .",
    "second we have demonstrated that the correlations and anti - correlations among these light elements extend with the same amplitude seen on the upper rgb ( but not with the extreme ratios characteristic of the tip of the rgb in m13 ) to the faintest luminosities probed , which for our sample in m13 , is near the main sequence turnoff .",
    "the range of luminosities for our sample in each of these two gcs reaches well below their rgb bump , which is at v = 15.45 for m3 and at v=14.75 for m13 @xcite , and is where the first dredge up is believed to begin .",
    "stars less luminous than this can not have mixed significantly according to current theory ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "this behavior demonstrates yet again that intrinsic nuclear processes within these low mass , and in some cases relatively unevolved , stars is not capable of explaining the observed phenomena . in this context , we note the work of @xcite on metal - poor field stars , which do not show these phenomena , but rather a much more orderly and smaller amplitude change in abundance ratios with luminosity .",
    "thus these phenomena seem restricted to globular clusters , where the stellar density is high , and the gas density presumably was also quite high in the past .",
    "since internal nucleosynthesis has been ruled out , some form of external pollution onto the low mass stars we currently see in gcs is required . this could be from a companion agb star or from mass loss into the ism of the cluster itself by higher mass stars presumably in the agb phase , followed by accretion as the low mass star passes through the denser regions near the cluster core , or by incomplete mixing of the cluster ism prior to the formation of the generation of stars we see today .",
    "the problems with this general type of mechanism have been discussed at length by many , see , e.g. @xcite , and basically involve whether enough mass can be accreted , whether with the additional accreted material the observed abundance ratios can be reproduced ( see , e.g. * ? ? ? * for a discussion regarding massive agb stars ) , and over what mass zones and how deeply down from the surface does the accreting star mix and hence dilute the accreted material .",
    "all this exotic behavior ceases with si , whose abundance appears to be constant , with a small range consistent with the observational and modeling uncertainties .",
    "the regime from si through the fe - peak is characterized by no detectable star - to - star variations , and by strong over - depletion of the odd atomic number elements , expected for fe - peak nuclei from considerations of explosive nucleosynthesis @xcite .",
    "( recall that among the lightest elements , the odd atomic numbers show large enhancements in [ x / fe ] . )",
    "the heaviest elements are not well sampled by our data . however , the [ ba / eu ] ratio is @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) dex in m3 ( m13 ) , which value is intermediate between the solar ratio and that of the pure @xmath60-process , presumably reflecting the increased dominance of the @xmath60-process contribution at low metallicities .",
    "the heaviest elements also show the first signs of star - to - star variations again , not surprising since their abundances @xmath37/h are so low that any small addition of material could raise [ x / fe ] .",
    "in particular , m13 i5 shows strong excesses of y and of ba , presumably from a @xmath4-process event , but we need , and have already obtained , better spectra with more complete wavelength coverage to verify this . ignoring @xmath61 cen cen in discussing star - to - star variations among globular clusters for the rest of this paper as it has been known for more than 20 years to have a wide range of heavy element abundance ( see , e.g. the latest such work , * ? ? ? * ) and has been repeatedly suggested recently as the remnant of the nucleus of an accreted dwarf galaxy .",

    "there are at least 10 more galactic gcs which have been observed at keck or at the vlt within the past two years with analyses in progress , so a significant fraction of the total galactic population of gcs has been covered .",
    "this strict selection of gc analyses guarantees the maximum possible accuracy of the abundance ratios , without of course guaranteeing consistency between the various analyses .",
    "although the first author has been associated with seven of the 13 , we have not tried to homogenize the details of the procedures adopted by other groups .    to characterize the behavior of the metal - poor halo field stars , we adopt abundance ratios from recent large surveys of such by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and by @xcite .",
    "no effort has been made to homogenize these analyses either , but since they were carried out over the course of more than a decade , we have corrected for the difference in the solar fe abundance adopted by each .    for both the field star surveys and the gcs , we have looked at the differences between the transition probabilities used for each of these analyses , and set them to the same absolute scale .",
    "such differences are small for most species , but are large ( up to 0.2 dex ) for ca  i , with substantial scatter in the difference from line to line .",
    "when one examines the resulting relations between [ x / h ] and [ fe / h ] for the galactic globular clusters and for the halo field stars , one is struck by the similarity for many elements of the trends between the two systems , present in spite of completely independent analyses on very different samples ( the halo stars being mostly dwarfs , while the gc samples focus on giants in many cases ) .",
    "two typical cases are illustrated ; for ti ( figure  [ figure_ti_all ] ) and for ba ( figure  [ figure_ba_all ] ) , as for most elements , the relations of abundance ratio with metallicity of the gcs and of the halo field are indistinguishable .",
    "the most credible difference we notice is shown by the @xmath62-elements mg and ca ( we show that of [ ca / fe ] versus [ fe / h ] in figure  [ figure_ca_all ] ) . the most metal poor gc appears to be deficient in mg and in ca at [ fe / h ] @xmath63 dex by @xmath50.3 dex as compared to the field . one explanation for this could be that the luminous giants usually analyzed in the gcs are slightly depleted in mg , an element which shows modest star - to - star variations in gcs , or perhaps non - lte effects in mg are playing a role .",
    "the notoriously uncertain mg @xmath22 values could also be relevant if the same lines are not used by all the groups , and there are also problems in the @xmath22 values for ca  i at the level of @xmath50.2 dex which may not have been completely removed .",
    "this difference in behavior between the gcs and the halo field is at present smaller than 2@xmath15 and involves just the most metal poor gc .",
    "we await publication of analyses for more of the most metal deficient halo gcs to confirm the reality of this potential difference .",
    "we have carried a detailed abundance analysis for 21 elements in a sample of 25 stars with a wide range in luminosity from luminous giants to stars near the main sequence turnoff in the globular cluster m13 ( [ fe / h ] @xmath0 dex ) and in a sample of 13 stars distributed from the tip to the base of the rgb in the globular cluster m3 ( [ fe / h]@xmath64 dex ) .",
    "the analyzed spectra , obtained with hires at the keck observatory , are of high dispersion ( r=@xmath2=35,000 ) .",
    "most elements , including fe , but excluding the elements lighter than si , show no trend in abundance ratio [ x / fe ] with @xmath3 , and scatter around the mean between the top of the rgb and near the main sequence turnoff consistent with observational uncertainties .",
    "this suggests that at this metallicity , non - lte effects and gravitationally induced heavy element diffusion are not important for this set of elements over the range of stellar parameters spanned by our sample .",
    "the elements lighter than si that have been studied in detail , i.e. c and n ( by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , o , na , mg , and al ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) all show strong star - to - star variations and correlations among each other .",
    "we have detected an anti - correlation between o and na abundances , observed previously only among the most luminous rgb stars in both of these clusters .",
    "we find these anti - correlations to persist in both m3 and in m13 over the full range of luminosity of our samples , i.e. in the case of m13 to near the main sequence turnoff .",
    "m13 shows a larger range in both o and na abundance than does m3 at all luminosities , in particular having a few stars at its rgb tip with very strongly depleted o.    we detect a correlation between mg abundance and o abundance among the stars in the m13 sample , but no credible star - to - star variation in [ mg / fe ] within the m3 sample .",
    "we also find a decrease in the mean mg abundance as one moves towards lower luminosity , which we tentatively suggest is due to ignoring non - lte effects in mg .",
    "although cn burning must be occurring in both m3 and in m13 , and on burning is required for m13 , we have confirmed with quite high precision that the sum of c+n+o is constant , log[@xmath23(c+n+o ) ] = @xmath54 dex with a relatively small @xmath15 of @xmath55 dex , previously shown near the tip of the giant branch by @xcite for luminous giants , but we extend this down to the bump in the luminosity function .",
    "the same holds true for a smaller sample in m3 , with somewhat larger variance .",
    "we have shown that these star - to - star abundance variations among the light elements continue well below the rgb bump in both m3 and m13 .",
    "the low luminosity at which these phenomena are now detected in m3 and m13 , and from our previous work , in m71 and in m5 @xcite , as in other published analyses ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has effectively ruled out the possibility of generating the spreads through internal nucleosynthesis and mixing within the stars we observe today .",
    "instead some form of external pollution involving a previous generation of stars , combined with binaries or accretion of gas from the cluster ism , must be involved .",
    "but as discussed most recently by @xcite , the details do not fit ( yet ) .",
    "star i5 in m13 has large excesses of y and of ba , with no strong enhancement of eu , suggesting an @xmath4-process event contributed to its heavy element abundances .",
    "this is the first star we have found in the present long term effort that shows any credible deviation from the cluster mean for any heavy element .",
    "the mean abundance ratios we derive for m3 and for m13 are identical to within the errors .",
    "they show the typical pattern of scatter among the light elements , with the odd atomic number elements appearing enhanced , then no star - to - star variations among the fe - peak elements , where the odd atomic number elements are excessively depleted .",
    "the mean [ eu / ba ] ratio is essentially the same in both clusters ; it is intermediate between the solar ratio and that of the @xmath60-process , suggesting the additional @xmath60-process contribution characteristic of metal - poor populations .",
    "it does not appear possible to explain the significant differences in horizontal branch characteristics of m3 and m13 , the classic second parameter pair , through differences in abundances ( unless he is the culprit ) , since we have shown that these two clusters have essentially identical values of [ fe / h ] and of mean [ x / fe ] , for all elements studied here .",
    "the abundance ratios for 13 galactic globular clusters with recent detailed abundance analyses , obtained by combining our samples with published data , are compared to those of published large surveys of metal - poor halo field stars . for most elements ,",
    "the agreement is very good , suggesting a common chemical history for the halo field and for the galactic globular clusters .",
    "we see yet again that the abundances of the fe - peak elements in m3 and in m13 , which are rather massive globular clusters ( @xmath65 ) are single valued , with extremely narrow peaks .",
    "it is ironic that such intense theoretical and observational effort has in recent years focused on the correlations and anti - correlations among the light elements c , n , o , na , mg and al in globular clusters , and the mixing and nuclear processes that might produce these , and so little has focused on the amazingly narrow range of abundances of the fe - peak elements characteristic of the galactic globular clusters .",
    "the entire keck / hires user communities owes a huge debt to jerry nelson , gerry smith , steve vogt , and many other people who have worked to make the keck telescope and hires a reality and to operate and maintain the keck observatory .",
    "we are grateful to the w. m. keck foundation for the vision to fund the construction of the w. m. keck observatory .",

    "<S> we have carried out a detailed abundance analysis for 21 elements in a sample of 25 stars with a wide range in luminosity from luminous giants to stars near the main sequence turnoff in the globular cluster m13 ( [ fe / h ] @xmath0 dex ) and in a sample of 13 stars distributed from the tip to the base of the rgb in the globular cluster m3 ( [ fe / h ] @xmath1 dex ) . </S>",
    "<S> the analyzed spectra , obtained with hires at the keck observatory , are of high dispersion ( r=@xmath2=35,000 ) . </S>",
    "<S> most elements , including fe , show no trend with @xmath3 , and low scatter around the mean between the top of the rgb and near the main sequence turnoff , suggesting that at this metallicity , non - lte effects and gravitationally induced heavy element diffusion are not important for this set of elements over the range of stellar parameters spanned by our sample .    </S>",
    "<S> we have detected an anti - correlation between o and na abundances , observed previously among the most luminous rgb stars in both of these clusters , in both m3 and in m13 over the full range of luminosity of our samples , i.e. in the case of m13 to near the main sequence turnoff . </S>",
    "<S> m13 shows a larger range in both o and na abundance than does m3 at all luminosities , in particular having a few stars at its rgb tip with unusually strongly depleted o.    we detect a correlation between mg abundance and o abundance among the stars in the m13 sample . </S>",
    "<S> we also find a decrease in the mean mg abundance as one moves towards lower luminosity , which we tentatively suggest is due to our ignoring non - lte effects in mg .    </S>",
    "<S> although cn burning must be occurring in both m3 and in m13 , and on burning is required for m13 , we combine our new o abundances with published c and n abundances to confirm with quite high precision that the sum of c+n+o is constant near the tip of the giant branch , and we extend this down to the bump in the luminosity function . </S>",
    "<S> the same holds true for a smaller sample in m3 , with somewhat larger variance .    </S>",
    "<S> star i5 in m13 has large excesses of y and of ba , with no strong enhancement of eu , suggesting an @xmath4-process event contributed to its heavy element abundances .    </S>",
    "<S> the mean abundance ratios for m3 and for m13 are identical to within the errors . </S>",
    "<S> they show the typical pattern for metal - poor globular clusters of scatter among the light elements , with the odd atomic number elements appearing in the mean enhanced . </S>",
    "<S> the fe - peak elements , where the odd atomic number elements are excessively depleted , do not show any detectable star - to - star variations in either cluster .    </S>",
    "<S> the abundance ratios for 13 galactic globular clusters with recent detailed abundance analyses , obtained by combining our samples with published data , are compared to those of published large surveys of metal - poor halo field stars . for most elements , </S>",
    "<S> the agreement is very good , suggesting a common chemical history for the halo field and cluster stars . </S>"
