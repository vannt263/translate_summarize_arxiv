    "until recently the @xmath0mno@xmath1 perovskites ( @xmath0=rare earth , y , sc ) have been object of research mainly as parent materials of mixed valence manganites exhibiting colossal magnetoresistivity ( cmr).@xcite in the past few years , however , there is an increased interest in the complex relationships among the lattice distortions , magnetism , dielectric and transport properties of undoped @xmath0mno@xmath1 .",
    "@xcite in particular , it has been found that with decreasing radius ( @xmath2 ) of @xmath0 ( @xmath0=la to eu ) the transition temperature t@xmath10 to a - type antiferromagnetic ( a - afm ) structure also decreases . with further decrease of @xmath2 ( @xmath0=gd to ho ) the magnetic structure below t@xmath10",
    "changes from a - afm to incommensurate antiferromagnetic one(ic - afm ) with sine - wave ordering of the mn moments with temperature - dependent wave vector @xmath11 along the @xmath12-axis ( in @xmath13 notations ) . at t@xmath14@xmath15t@xmath10 an",
    "incommensurate - to - commensurate ( ic - cm ) transition takes place and @xmath16 locks at a value @xmath17.@xcite a transition to commensurate e - type antiferromagnetic structure ( e - afm , @xmath18 ) has been observed below t@xmath19 only for homno@xmath1 .",
    "@xcite for tbmno@xmath1 and dymno@xmath1 it was found that the ic - cm transition is accompanied by a ferroelectric transition , associated with lattice modulation in the cm phase.@xcite .",
    "large magnetodielectric effects have also been reported for orthorhombic homno@xmath1 , and ymno@xmath1.@xcite    although the role of lattice distortions in the interplay of magnetic , dielectric and transport properties of @xmath0mno@xmath1 perovskites is widely recognized , there are relatively few studies on the variations of these distortions with @xmath0.@xcite raman spectroscopy can provide significant additional information on the distortions and their variations with both @xmath0 and temperature .",
    "the raman active modes in @xmath0mno@xmath1 ( @xmath20 ) are activated exclusively due to the deviations from ideal perovskite structure and in principle the activation of each raman line can with definite certainty be assigned to the value of one or two types of basic distortion ( rotations of mno@xmath9 octahedra around [ 101 ] or [ 010 ] directions , jahn - teller distortion , or shift of @xmath0 atoms).@xcite the first assignment of the raman lines in the spectra of @xmath0mno@xmath1 to definite atomic vibrations has been done by comparison of experimentally obtained raman phonon frequencies of lamno@xmath1 and ymno@xmath1 with those predicted by lattice dynamical calculations ( ldc ) .",
    "@xcite although for most of the experimentally observed raman lines the frequencies have been in good agreement with those predicted by ldc , some uncertainties about the phonon line assignment remained .",
    "indeed , some raman lines of same symmetry have close frequencies and due to the approximations of the ldc model one reasonably expects some difference between measured and calculated values .",
    "the assignment of the two @xmath21 raman lines between 450 and 520  @xmath22 , where are the @xmath21 modes corresponding to anti - stretching(as ) and bendings(b ) of mno@xmath9 octahedra , has been challenged by martin - carron et al.@xcite in a raman study of several @xmath0mno@xmath1 perovskites ( @xmath0=la , pr , nd , tb , ho , er , y ) . based on the fact that the mn - o distances exhibit only small changes within the @xmath0mno@xmath1 series , they assigned the as band observed near 480 - 490  @xmath22 to the anti - stretching mode , while the b band which shifts from @xmath23  @xmath22 in lamno@xmath1 to @xmath24  @xmath22 in ermno@xmath1 has been assigned to bending mode(s ) .",
    "an obvious problem of this re - assignment is the `` crossing '' of the as and b modes , which are of the same a@xmath25 symmetry .    in this work we present results of a detailed study of polarized raman spectra of @xmath0mno@xmath1 ( @xmath0=la , pr , nd , sm , eu , gd , tb , dy , ho , y ) at room temperature .",
    "the comparison of variations with @xmath0 of phonon frequencies and relative intensities of most pronounced @xmath21 and @xmath26 modes shows that some corrections of previous phonon mode assignment are needed .",
    "the strong mixing and spectral weight transfer between @xmath21 anti - stretching ( as ) and bending ( b ) modes in the 500  @xmath22 region , most clearly observed for @xmath0=eu , gd and tb , correlates with changes of magnetic structure .",
    "similar distortion - dependent mode mixing is observed for the rotational @xmath5 and o1(@xmath6 ) [ @xmath7 modes .",
    "prmno@xmath1 , ndmno@xmath1 and smmno@xmath1 samples were grown by the floating zone method described in ref.@xcite .",
    "single crystals of dymno@xmath1 of average sizes @xmath27  mm@xmath28 were prepared following a procedure to be described elsewhere @xcite .",

    "gd , tb the precursor powders were heated at 1130 - 1160@xmath29 in o@xmath30 for 24 hours .",
    "although the samples ( except for dymno@xmath1 ) were polycrystalline , the size of the constituting microcrystals was larger than the laser spot .",

    "are fixed [ @xmath0 - 1,mn-3,o1 - 1 ] , while the remaining 7 variable coordinates can be considered as the lattice degrees of freedom producing the above mentioned lattice distortion .",
    "these distortions give rise to 24 ( @xmath20 ) raman - allowed phonon modes , which in turn can be assigned to their distortions of origin ( [ 010]- , [ 101]-rotation , jt , or @xmath0-shift ) . with decreasing @xmath2 the distortions increase and most of the bond lengths shorten , which reasonably results in twofold effect : enhanced raman intensity and hardening of raman frequencies .    at first sight",
    "the [ 010 ] and [ 101 ] rotations can directly be obtained from the o2-mn - o2 and o1-mn - o1 angles , which practically have equal values.@xcite as shown by abrashev et al.@xcite , however , even in the case of equal o - mn - o angles , the [ 010 ] and [ 101 ] rotation angles will be different .",
    "they are related to the deviations ( @xmath57 , @xmath58-atomic index ) of @xmath13 atomic coordinates from those in a hypothetical undistorted perovskite structure as @xmath59 } = \\arctan(2|x_{o2}-z_{o2}|)\\ ] ] @xmath60 } = \\arctan(2^{5/2}|y_{o2}| ) \\approx \\arctan(2^{3/2}|z_{o1}|)\\ ] ]    the so defined atomic deviations can also be used to describe the other two basic distortions , namely , the jt distortion , characterized by the relative difference @xmath61 of the two pairs of mn - o2 distances , and the shift @xmath62 of the @xmath0-atoms in @xmath6-direction from their positions in an undistorted perovskite . in the case of small distortions : @xmath63 @xmath64    the variations of the basic distortions , calculated using the available data for atomic positions in @xmath0mno@xmath1@xcite are given in table  ii .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      the frequency of a mode involving mainly stretching vibrations of o2 atoms in the @xmath65 planes is determined by the mn - o2 distances .",
    "the short and long mn - o2 bond lengths vary with @xmath2 within 0.5% and 1.1% , respectively@xcite and therefore one expects that @xmath66 will change by no more than 1.5% . as illustrated in figure 3 , this is exactly the case for the @xmath33 mode at 606 - 617  @xmath22 , which has been assigned to the in - phase o2 stretching.@xcite .",
    "the minimum of @xmath33 frequency near r = nd , sm reflects the fact that for these @xmath0 s the averaged mn - o distance has a maximum .",
    "based on the same bond - length considerations , one could expect that the raman line of @xmath21 symmetry at 490 - 495  @xmath22 , corresponding to the in - phase anti - stretching vibrations of o2 in the @xmath65 plane,@xcite would behave in a similar way and its frequency would remain nearly constant through the whole @xmath0mno@xmath1 series . as seen from fig.4 , this is obviously not the case .",
    "the data of figs .  1 and 4 clearly show a classic example for mixing of modes of same symmetries and close frequencies . for large @xmath2 ( @xmath0=la , pr , nd ) the lines at 490 - 492 and 445 - 465  @xmath22 can be considered as pure stretching(@xmath3 ) and bending(@xmath4 ) modes , respectively . with decreasing @xmath2 the @xmath4 frequency increases and approaches that of @xmath3 , resulting in strong mode mixing evidenced by mode repulsion and transfer of intensity .",
    "the mixing is most strongly pronounced for @xmath0=sm to tb where the two modes are of comparable intensities and involve both stretching and bending atomic motions . with further decrease of @xmath2 ( @xmath0=dy ,",
    "ho , y ) the modes become less mixed but now the higher mode is dominated by mno@xmath9 bending [ @xmath4-type ] motions and the lower one is @xmath3-type .",
    "two phonon modes of same symmetries and close frequencies can be considered as coupled quantum oscillators . in a good approximation their frequencies",
    "are given by @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the mode frequencies without coupling and @xmath70 is the coupling constant .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that without coupling the @xmath3 and @xmath4 mode frequencies would depend on @xmath2 in the same way as the @xmath33 and @xmath71 modes , respectively , as both modes of the @xmath3-@xmath33 ( stretching ) and @xmath4-@xmath42 ( bending ) pairs are activated by the same basic distortion and have similar shape .",
    "therefore , as shown with dash lines in fig.4 , the @xmath72 dependence for the uncoupled @xmath3 mode can be approximated by scaling the experimental @xmath26 values , whereas that of uncoupled @xmath4 mode [ @xmath73 , like in the case of @xmath42 , can be approximated by a linear dependence . at the crossing point",

    "the higher of these modes is @xmath84-like in lamno@xmath1 , but @xmath5-like in ymno@xmath1 . assuming that the higher mode remains @xmath5-like in other compounds with small @xmath2 ( homno@xmath1 , dymno@xmath1 ,",
    "tbmno@xmath1 , gdmno@xmath1 ) , one finds that the frequency vs @xmath85}$ ] dependence for the partly mixed @xmath5 mode ( shown with empty squares ) is practically the same as that for the pure @xmath8 mode .",
    "interestingly , the frequencies of [ 111]- rotational modes of structurally different rhombohedral lamno@xmath1 and laalo@xmath1 fit to these dependences , which is an indication for a quite general relationship between the angle of rotation and frequency of the rotational `` soft '' modes in perovskitelike compounds , independent on the direction of the rotational axis .    }",

    "it follows from fig.2 , table  i and table  ii that in the case of pure @xmath0-shift mode [ @xmath43 ] , despite of strongly increasing @xmath0-shift distortion between @xmath0=la and y , the corresponding increase of mode frequency is relatively modest ( see table  ii ) .",
    "it is plausible to expect similar dependence on @xmath2 for the @xmath84 mode , which explains the above discussed observation that the frequency vs @xmath2 dependence of the mixed @xmath88 modes is governed mainly by their rotational [ @xmath5 ] component .",
    "the comparative study of polarized raman spectra of orthorhombic @xmath0mno@xmath1 series ( @xmath0=la , pr , nd , sm , eu , gd , tb , dy , ho , y ) shows that the variations of lattice distortions with @xmath2 affect significantly both the phonon frequencies and the shape of some raman phonon modes .",
    "the strong mixing of phonon modes involving in - plane and out - of - plane oxygen motions may become a clue for understanding the change with @xmath2 of magnetic ordering at low temperatures .",
    "the established proportionality between the frequency of a rotational mode and the angle of corresponding rotational distortion may be used for material characterization .",
