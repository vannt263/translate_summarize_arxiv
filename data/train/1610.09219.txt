    "high - spin @xmath0 fields , both massive and massless , always have counted to the main topics in field theories . in particle physics",
    "such fields describe hadron resonances whose spins vary from @xmath3 to @xmath4 for baryons , and from zero to six for mesons @xcite . at hadron colliders ,",
    "intermediate high spin resonances can be produced which subsequently decay in a pair of photons , a process of high interest in the literature @xcite . in gravity",
    ", high - spin bosons can couple to the metric tensor and cause its deformation @xcite , and are besides this fundamental to the physics of rotating black holes @xcite .",
    "also gravitational interactions between high - spin fermions are of interest @xcite .",
    "the traditional approaches to high - spin fields have been developed between 1939 and 1964 ( see @xcite for a recent review , and @xcite for a standard textbook ) by fierz and pauli ( fp ) @xcite , rarita and schwinger @xcite , bargmann and wigner ( bw ) @xcite , joos @xcite and weinberg @xcite . in the next section we briefly highlight these four methods , comment on their problems , and report in section 3 on a new approach , suggested in @xcite-@xcite , before closing with a brief summary .",
    "the methods for high - spin description are distinct through the type of the representation spaces ( reps ) used to embed the spin of interest .",
    "below we list various possibilities to describe spin-@xmath5 .",
    "particles of spins , @xmath6 , have been so far frequently described in terms of @xmath7 representation spaces of multiple spins and alternating parities , corresponding to the totally symmetric @xmath8 lorentz tensors of rank-@xmath5 , @xmath9 for bosons ( fierz - pauli framework @xcite ) , or , the totally symmetric rank-@xmath10 lorentz tensors with dirac spinor components , @xmath11 , @xmath12,\\ ] ] for fermions ( rarita - schwinger ( rs ) framework @xcite ) , respectively .",
    "the particles have been associated with the degrees of freedom ( d.o.f . ) of the highest spins in the spaces under discussion , while the remaining degrees of freedom , corresponding to lower spins , had to be projected out by properly chosen auxiliary conditions for the sake of ensuring the correct number of physical d.o.f . required by spin-@xmath5 .",
    "the wave equations in the fierz - pauli approach to high - spin- @xmath5 bosons read , @xmath13 while the rarita - schwinger approach to spin-@xmath5 fermions is cast as , @xmath14      alternatively , it has been considered that spin-@xmath5 particles can also be described in terms of single - spin valued representation spaces of the even number of @xmath16 components , @xmath17 , \\label{wj - spinors } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] a scheme known as the joos - weinberg framework @xcite , @xcite . differently from the rs approach , the @xmath16-component wave function , * column*@xmath18 , occasionally termed to as `` bi - vector '' ,",
    "satisfies one sole differential equation , which is however of a high - order , @xmath19_{ab}\\partial^{\\mu_1}\\partial^{\\mu_2 } ...   \\partial^{\\mu_{2j}}-m^{2j}\\delta_{ab}\\right)\\psi^{(j)}_b(x)&=&0 .",

    "the complete sets of such matrices have been extensively studied in the literature for the purpose of constructing all the possible field bi - linears needed in the definitions of the generalized currents , both transitional and diagonal @xcite .",
    "though well elaborated , the weinberg - joos formalism has attracted comparatively less attention than the linear rarita - schwinger framework not only because of the difficult to tackle high order of the differential equations and the high dimensionality of the generalized dirac matrices .",
    "in addition , bi - vectors as a rule can not be equipped neither with lorentz , nor with dirac indexes , a reason for which their couplings to spinorial , vectorial etc targets have to be described through uncomfortable rectangular matrices .",
    "another option for spin-@xmath5 description is provided by the totally symmetric product , of @xmath23 copies of a dirac spinor , @xmath24 , where @xmath25 , and @xmath26 are the right and left - handed weyl ",
    " der - waerden two - component spinors corresponding to the two nonequivalent fundamental @xmath2 representation spaces , also known as `` spinor '' ( @xmath27 ) , and `` co - spinor '' ( @xmath28 , @xmath29_1 \\otimes ... \\otimes \\left [ \\left(\\frac{1}{2 } , 0 \\right)\\oplus \\left(0,\\frac{1}{2 } \\right)\\right]_n,\\ ] ] where @xmath30 , a scheme known as the bargmann - wigner method @xcite .",
    "the bargmann - wigner rank-@xmath31 spinor satisfies also a high - order differential equation which reads , @xmath32 all four schemes are known to be plagued by serious inconsistencies , which are however of distinct kinds .",
    "the fierz - pauli and the rarita - schwinger fields have multiple redundant components which are eliminated by the auxiliary conditions solely at the free - particle level . upon couplings to external fields , the auxiliary conditions no longer serve their purpose , in consequence of which the wave fronts of the ( classical ) coupled solutions can propagate acausally ( velo - zwanziger problem @xcite ) . a further inconsistency has been revealed by johnson and sudarshan @xcite who showed that the equal time anti - commutators between spin-@xmath33 fields , minimally coupled to the electromagnetic field , are not positive definite .",
    "in addition , the attempts to construct lagrangians within these methods are becoming increasingly involved due to difficulties of incorporating the auxiliary conditions at the interaction level , a reason for which it is common to pursue alternative , though not fully covariant methods in data evaluations . specifically in hadron collisions , where the calculations of the cross sections are carried out within the preferred center of mass frame , it is common to account for the contributions of intermediate states of high - spin-@xmath34 to processes as , say , diphoton production , by parametrizing the corresponding polarized decay amplitude by a single constant and factorizing a rotational @xmath35 wigner function , @xmath36 , that encodes the angular dependence of the amplitude . specifically in @xcite ,",
    "the absence of high - spin lagrangians has been compensated by suggesting effective lagrangians that may be used to simulate some particular intermediate resonances of both low and high spins , through monte carlo generators .",
    "+ on the other side , the joos - weinberg and the bargmann - wigner frameworks refer to a single wave equation without any need for auxiliary conditions , but they are of the order twice the particle s spin .",
    "differential equations of the order higher than 2 are as a rule difficult to tackle because they lead to higher - order field theories which suffer severe inconsistencies such as ghost solutions of the bad type , kinetic terms of wrong signs , states of negative norms , violation of unitarity etc .",
    "furthermore , particles in such theories can propagate non - locally .",
    "all the experimentally verified fundamental theories in modern physics are based on lagrangians of second order in the momenta . only in effective theories with over integrated fields , high order lagrangians may appear .",
    "one of the reasons behind the problems caused by high order differential equations is the so ostrogradskian instability @xcite which , at the level of , say , classical mechanics , for concreteness , predicts phase spaces of unstable orbits , and needs a special effort to be handled @xcite . in the light of the above discussion",
    ", it is desirable to search for a method which would allow for a consistent description of any spin ,    * by one sole wave equation of maximally second order in the derivatives , and derivable from a lagrangian , * within lorentz- , or , weyl - van - der - waerden tensor - spinor bases .",
    "such a formalism for spin-@xmath5 in single - spin @xmath1 reps has been designed in refs .",
    "@xcite,@xcite , @xcite , and is briefly highlighted below .",
    "the first goal of the references @xcite , @xcite , @xcite has been to describe the pure spin @xmath1 states , be it through lorentz , or through weyl - van - der - waerden spinor - tensors , this for the sake of constructing by simple index contractions vertexes which involve interactions of high - spins with gauge fields , such as the photon , and/or spinorial targets , such as the proton , and thus avoid the introduction of the cumbersome index - matching rectangular matrices , typical for the joos - weinberg formalism . in order to illustrate the essentials of the method",

    "such an elimination can indeed be realized by the aid of momentum independent projectors constructed from the invariants of the spin - lorentz group , a result due to @xcite,@xcite .",

    "it has been shown in @xcite that within this scheme , one reproduces the precise electromagnetic multipole moments obtained within the canonical joos - weinberg method , where the field is described by an eight component `` bi - vector '' @xcite .",
    "it has been furthermore checked that also the properties of the remaining two sectors , known from elsewhere , are correctly reproduced , as it should be .",
    "moreover , in @xcite the proof that the wave equation in ( [ master32 ] ) is free from the velo - zwanziger problem has been delivered by demonstrating that the wave fronts of its ( classical ) solutions propagate always causally within an electromagnetic environment .",
    "the above presentation should leave it clear that the scheme does not restrict to product spaces of the type given in ( [ prdct_spcs ] ) but extends to any product spaces containing the pure spin @xmath75 of interest .",
    "in particular , it applies to bases constructed as direct products of four - vectors , or , to general weyl - van - der - waerden tensor - spinors , as used in the bargmann - wigner framework @xcite .",
    "moreover , the scheme also extends to high- spins carried by two - spin valued representation spaces of the type , @xmath76 , @xcite , in which case the second order wave equation is not obtained from the mass shell - condition alone but from combining it by another covariant projector , @xmath77 , which projects besides on the mass shell , also on the highest of the two spin degrees of freedom . here",
    ", @xmath78 is the squared pauli - lubanski operator , the second casimir invariant of the algebra of inhomogeneous spin - lorentz group .",
    "such a projector technique has first been employed by aurilia and umezawa in @xcite at the free particle level , and independently , almost 40 years later by @xcite at the interacting level . in the latter work",
    "the second order differential equation following from @xmath79 has been extended by the most general terms allowed by relativity and containing @xmath80 , @xmath81 commutators .",
    "these terms , identically vanishing at the free particle level , provide upon gauging essential contributions proportional to the electromagnetic field strength tensor , @xmath82 and guarantee that the resulting wave equation is free from the velo - zwanziger problem for a @xmath83 factor taking the value of @xmath84 .",
    "however , the solutions to second order equations , be them to the representation unspecific klein - gordon , and proca types , or to the representation specific equation in ( [ master32 ] ) , describe arbitrary mixing of spin-@xmath5 particles of opposite parities .",
    "this arbitrariness can be removed by the aid of the second casimir invariant @xmath58 in ( [ cas2 ] ) , the subject of the next subsection .      in parallel to ( [ general_l_proj ] ) , also the @xmath58 invariant of the spin - lorentz group algebra can be employed in the construction of projector operators within any @xmath85 representations space .",

    "then the two equations , @xmath94 with @xmath95 , uniquely fix the chiral components of the representation space under consideration .",
    "the chiral components are defined by the symmetric and anti - symmetric combinations of wave functions of positive and negative parity states , a reason for which the parity states spanning the representation space of interest can be recovered without ambiguities from the chiral states .",

    ", we , similarly to the fierz - pauli method , approximated the kinematics through the mass - shell condition alone , and kept the reference frame specification of the reps ( encoded by the boost ) solely at the wave - function level ( generated in any frame by construction ) , while dropping it from the wave equation .",
