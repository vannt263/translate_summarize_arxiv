    "an important and intriguing challenge in wormhole physics is the quest to find a realistic matter source that will support these exotic spacetimes .",
    "traversable wormholes are supported by a null energy condition violating stress energy tensor , denoted as _",
    "exotic matter _ @xcite .",
    "several candidates have been proposed in the literature , such as scalar fields @xcite ; wormhole solutions in semi - classical gravity ( see ref . @xcite and references therein ) ; solutions in brans - dicke theory @xcite ; solutions in higher dimensions , for instance in einstein - gauss - bonnet theory @xcite , wormholes on the brane @xcite ; etc ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for more details and references ) .",
    "more recently , it has been argued that traversable wormholes may be supported by several equations of state responsible for the late time accelerated expansion of the universe , namely , phantom energy @xcite , the generalized chaplygin gas @xcite , and the van der waals quintessence fluid @xcite . despite the fact that , in a cosmological context , these equations of state represent homogeneous fluids , inhomogeneities may arise through gravitational instabilities .",
    "therefore , it seems that traversable wormholes may possibly originate from density fluctuations in the cosmological background .",
    "in fact , it has been shown recently that quantum fluctuations may self sustain phantom wormholes with an equation of state varying with the radial coordinate @xcite .    moving on to braneworld cosmology ,",
    "the latter is an interesting scenario based on the idea that our universe is a @xmath0brane embedded in a five - dimensional bulk . in the context of braneworld wormholes , a class of static and spherically symmetric solutions , with @xmath3 , where @xmath2 is the four dimensional ricci scalar , was considered in ref .",
    "the authors also consider a vacuum brane , so that the wormhole is supported by bulk weyl effects . in this work , we generalize to non - vacuum branes with non - exotic matter , and with @xmath1 .",
    "in fact , in addition to wormholes , several static and spherically symmetric spacetimes on the brane have been analyzed to some extent in the literature , for instance , stars on the brane @xcite , black holes @xcite and constraints from solar system experiments were also found @xcite . in this work , in addition to analyzing the wormhole case of @xmath1 , we impose that the stress energy tensor confined on the brane , threading the wormhole satisfies the nec .",
    "we also show that the local high - energy bulk effects and nonlocal corrections from the weyl curvature in the bulk could leave a nec violating signature on the brane .",
    "this argument is supported by the fact that negative energy densities are induced by gravitational waves or black strings in the bulk @xcite .",
    "thus , it seems that braneworld gravity provides a natural scenario for the existence of traversable wormholes .    in this work",
    ", we shall follow the formalism outlined in ref .",
    "the five - dimensional einstein equation in the bulk takes the form @xmath4 if the bulk is empty , i.e. , @xmath5 , the induced field equations on the brane @xcite , are given by @xmath6 with @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the gravitational coupling constants , @xmath10 and @xmath11 the cosmological constants on the brane and in the bulk , respectively ; @xmath12 is the tension on the brane .",
    "@xmath13 is the stress energy tensor confined on the brane , so @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the unit normal to the brane .",

    "the second correction term , @xmath19 , is the projection of the 5-dimensional weyl tensor , @xmath20 , onto the brane , and is defined as @xmath21 , and encompasses nonlocal bulk effects .",
    "the only general known property of this nonlocal term is that it is traceless , i.e. , @xmath22 .",
    "taking into account the traceless property of the projected 5-dimensional weyl tensor , then eq .",
    "( [ inducedefe2 ] ) implies @xmath23    this paper is outlined in the following manner : in section [ sec : field ] , we outline the effective field equations governing braneworld wormholes , and provide two general strategies for finding specific solutions . in section [ sec : solutions ] , we further explore specific solutions , and finally , in section [ sec : conclusion ] , we conclude .",
    "consider a static and spherically symmetric wormhole metric given in the following form @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are arbitrary functions of the radial coordinate , @xmath27 , denoted as the redshift function , and the form function , respectively @xcite . the radial coordinate has a range that increases from a minimum value at @xmath28 , corresponding to the wormhole throat , and extends to infinity .    to be a wormhole solution , several properties need to be imposed @xcite , namely : the throat is located at @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "a flaring out condition of the throat is imposed , i.e. , @xmath31 , which reduces to @xmath32 at the throat .",
    "the condition @xmath33 is also imposed . to be traversable",
    ", one must demand that there are no horizons present , which are identified as the surfaces with @xmath34 , so that @xmath25 must be finite everywhere .",
    "note that the field equation on the brane can take the form @xmath35 with the total effective stress energy tensor , @xmath36 , being given by @xmath37 with @xmath38 .",
    "we have considered , for simplicity , that the cosmological constant on the brane is zero .",
    "note that the quadratic term , i.e. , @xmath39 , is the high energy correction term . from the following approximations @xmath40 , one readily verifies that @xmath16 is dominant for @xmath41 , and negligible in the regime @xmath42 , where @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "in general relativity , the flaring out condition implies that the wormhole should be threaded with matter violating the null energy condition ( nec ) .",
    "note that the nec is given by @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is _ any _ null vector .",
    "now , an important feature of wormholes on the brane , governed by the induced field equations on the brane , eq .",
    "( [ inducedefe2 ] ) , is that it is the total effective stress energy tensor that should violate the nec . in particular",
    ", the stress energy tensor confined on the brane , @xmath13 , could perfectly satisfy the nec .",
    "therefore , the nec violation arises from a combination of the local bulk effects , through the quadratic term in the stress energy tensor , @xmath16 , and the nonlocal effects from the bulk , @xmath19 .",

    "\\label{ricciscalar2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the imposition of the flaring out condition implies that the effective total stress energy tensor violates the nec , i.e. , @xmath57 .",
    "now , considering a radial null vector , @xmath58 , the latter inequality takes the form @xmath59 . from the following relationship",
    "@xmath60 the nec violation , @xmath59 , provides the following generic restriction @xmath61 in order to obtain wormhole solutions .",
    "in particular , considering the low energy regime , @xmath62 , one may neglect the quadratic term components , and the inequality ( [ genericnec ] ) reduces to @xmath63 .",
    "if the weyl components are zero , then one recovers the usual general relativistic nec violation . for high energies , @xmath64 , the quadratic term dominates , and the inequality ( [ genericnec ] ) takes the form @xmath65",
    "thus , in addition to nonlocal corrections from the weyl curvature in the bulk ( as in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , local high - energy bulk effects imprints a nec violating signature on the brane .",
    "it is also possible to consider a zero weyl curvature term , and generalize the stress energy tensor to incorporate an anisotropic pressure contribution on the brane",
    ". this latter consideration would generalize standard general relativistic wormholes with the inclusion of a high - energy contribution .",
    "it seems that braneworld gravity provides a natural scenario for the existence of traversable wormholes . in summary , by choosing @xmath13 , this fixes @xmath16 .",
    "therefore , one needs to find @xmath19 which produces a wormhole violating the nec at all energies .",
    "however , the question of what 5-dimensional geometry produces this @xmath19 is much more difficult to answer , and shall not be explored here .",
    "now , one may adopt several strategies to find solutions of wormholes on the brane .",

    "the latter may be defined , for instance , evaluating the pressure at the throat , so that @xmath77 .",

    "the projected weyl tensor components provide the following relationships @xmath94 note that the traceless nature of the weyl term is obeyed , @xmath95 , as expected",

    "( [ rho : dust ] ) provides the vacuum @xmath97 , where @xmath98 with @xmath99 .",
    "this is a case analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite . now , considering the positive sign , so that @xmath100 , and the projected weyl tensor components reduce to @xmath101 note that this corresponds to a non - asymptotically flat solution , which , in this context , does not have a correspondence in general relativity .",
    "as we are imposing an isotropic pressure nec non - violating distribution of matter on the brane , one may generalize the latter dust solution .",
    "as an example , consider the following linear equation of state , @xmath102 .",
    "in addition to this , we shall assume that the energy conditions are satisfied .",
    "in particular , the weak energy condition ( wec ) , which states that for a diagonal stress energy tensor , we have @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "the strong energy condition ( sec ) states that @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "the latter conditions then impose the following inequalities : @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "now , eq . ( [ ricciscalar2 ] ) provides the following relationship @xmath109 where @xmath110 from the imposition of the sec , considered above , we verify that @xmath111 . specifying the functions @xmath26 and @xmath25 , and using eq .",

    "now , as the energy density is positive , @xmath91 , one needs to analyze two cases : @xmath115 for the positive sign , if @xmath116 , then the imposition of the above generic condition suffices ; if @xmath117 , then one needs to impose @xmath118 .",

    "in this work , we have adopted the viewpoint of a braneworld observer , by considering a general class of wormholes with @xmath140 , where @xmath2 is the four dimensional ricci scalar .",
    "in addition , two strategies were outlined in order to construct general solutions and specific cases were further explored .",
    "first , the specific case of dust , with a positive energy density was considered , and several general physical properties and characteristics were analyzed .",
    "second , a linear equation of state of the stress energy tensor components on the brane was analyzed , and finally , an asymptotically flat wormhole spacetime was found .",
    "now , a fundamental ingredient of traversable wormholes is the violation of the null energy condition ( nec ) .",
    "however , in the context of braneworlds , it is the effective total stress energy tensor that violates the nec . therefore , we have imposed that the stress energy tensor confined on the brane , threading the wormhole , satisfied the nec , and it was shown that in addition to the nonlocal corrections of the weyl curvature in the bulk ( as considered in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , local high - energy bulk effects , could leave a nec violating signature on the brane , thus providing a natural scenario for the existence of traversable wormholes .",
    "the question of what 5-dimensional geometry produces this nec imprint is much more difficult , and was not explored here .",
    "it is also important to emphasize another advantage of the analysis outlined in this paper , in generalizing the work of ref .",
    "@xcite , namely , it is possible to consider a zero weyl curvature term , and generalize the stress energy tensor to incorporate an anisotropic pressure contribution on the brane .",
    "this latter consideration would also extend and generalize standard general relativistic wormholes with the inclusion of a high - energy contribution .",
    "however , a few remarks are in order , namely , one may basically consider two strategies of obtaining solutions on the brane .",
    "first , the bulk spacetime may be given , by solving the full 5-dimensional equations , and the geometry of the embedded brane is then deduced .",
    "second , due to the complexity of the 5-dimensional equations , one may follow the strategy outlined in this paper , by considering the intrinsic geometry on the brane , which encompasses the imprint from the bulk , and consequently evolve the metric off the brane . in principle , the second procedure may provide a well - determined set of equations , with the brane setting the boundary data . however , determining the bulk geometry proves to be an extremely difficult endeavor .",
    "nevertheless , the behavior of the bulk should be analyzed , and found to be non - singular to inspire any physical meaning in the models considered .",
    "work along these lines is in progress .",
