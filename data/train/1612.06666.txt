    "p - i - n _ junction shed with light in order to excite charge carriers between valence and conduction bands .",
    "the carriers are then drained by the contacts by a drift electric field , giving rise to a net electric current  @xcite . however , to a single band gap cell , the detailed balance determines the current generation to be fundamentally limited by the absorption of photons with energies greater than the cell s band gap  @xcite . to overcome such limit ,",
    "intermediate bands solar cells has been proposed  @xcite .",
    "a set of electronic states , called intermediate band , is introduced within the semiconductor band gap .",
    "this affords new pathways to the carriers  @xcite , allowing additional carrier generation due to the extension of the spectral response in the energy range bellow the host - semiconductor band gap  @xcite .",
    "consequently , the addition of the intermediate band increases the light - to - current conversion efficiency of the solar cell .",
    "an additional condition to ensure such an efficiency enhancement , is that intermediate band needs to be radiatively connected to the valence band but electrically isolated from the other bands  @xcite .    the use of the localized subbands of quantum wells , embedded into the intrinsic region of _",
    "p - i - n _ solar cells , are promising candidates to be used as the intermediate bands  @xcite .",
    "they has been suggested to effectively enhance solar cell efficiencies  @xcite .",
    "however , extracting carriers from localized states often requires inelastic processes , as multiphoton excitation  @xcite .",
    "that becomes a new problem due to the low carrier lifetime into the intermediate subbands regarding to the interband recombination process  @xcite .",
    "hence , structures with ratchet states has been proposed  @xcite .",
    "the ratchet are states optically- and electrically - coupled to conduction band and decoupled from the valence band , acting as scattering channels for electrons excited into the intermediate band .",
    "the coupling between intermediate band and ratchet states , allows for excited electrons to increase their lifetimes within the intermediate band .",
    "this might increases the multiphoton transition probability and , consequently , the solar cell efficiency  @xcite .",
    "the use of quantum cascade - like scattering to work as the ratchet transport dynamics has been theoretically  @xcite and experimentally  @xcite proposed .",
    "it showed to be feasible and promising for increasing the cell s efficiency . in such approach ,",
    "the energy difference between the intermediate and hatchet states are set to be in resonance with the host - semiconductor lo - phonon energy , allowing for a phonon - assisted scattering .",
    "this spatially shift the optically generated electron - hole pair , decreasing the recombination probability , and also increases the electron s lifetime within the intermediate band .",
    "however there still has a lack of information about the transport dynamics within the excitation / scattering / excitation process .",
    "obviously , studies of this kind of structures must rely on their quantum properties , once we are dealing with quantum devices .",
    "therefore the analyses of such a systems under the quantum mechanics perspective is fundamental , once we consider the quantum well subbands as the basis of the cell s operation  @xcite .    in",
    "what follows , we propose an _",
    "p - i - n _ layered structure with two coupled quantum wells embedded into the intrinsic semiconductor region , to be implemented as an intermediate band solar cell with ratchet state .",
    "the transport dynamics is based on the quantum cascade - like scattering at the intermediate band .",
    "we analyze the current response of the cell by means of a rates model using the recombination and generation rates , directly obtained through the system eigenfunctions . we find a direct correlation between the scattering rate to the ratchet state and the recombination rates , rising the solar cell current .",
    "however , we observe conditions that even having the scattering to the ratchet states , the resulting current could result in a decrease of the net current .",
    "as discussed earlier , the major problem of using quantum well subbands as intermediate bands is the lowest excitation time for the electron at the intermediate band regarding to its recombination ( back to valence band ) time . allowing such an electron to relax into a ratchet state might increase its lifetime and , consequently , the two - photon process efficiency  @xcite .    .",

    "the intention was to use the rqw subband as the intermediate band and the lqw s excited subband as the ratchet state .",
    "being the latter an excited state , the selection rules for interband transition uncouple it for the valence band ground state  @xcite , as required  @xcite .",

    "this gives rise to a built - in potential , @xmath11  ev , by the depletion of the potential profile at intrinsic region .",
    "then a drift field is established , responsible for extracting photogenerated carriers towards the drain ( @xmath8 ) contact  @xcite . in order to restore the thermal equilibrium ,",

    "potentialprofile](c ) at the forward bias condition .",
    "it was considered for the levels occupation the equilibrium with the quasi - fermi levels established by the contacts . at forward bias condition",
    ", we do not we expect optical generation of current , since the conduction band states , at thermal equilibrium , are kept fulled . under such a bias condition ,",
    "current is expected only in the presence of inelastic scattering processes ( common to a @xmath12 diode )  @xcite , not considered in the present model .",

    "in the solar cell , the electrons excited both from valence and intermediate band , towards conduction band , should be extracted from quantum wells regions by the drain contact , restoring the thermal equilibrium .",

    "it would enhances the carriers lifetime at the intermediate band , increasing the cell s efficiency .     between the lqw e rqw .",
    "the inset shows the profile of liquid current for @xmath89  ghz . ]    in the  [ fig : til3d ] , we presented the liquid current , given by the  [ eqliqdcur ] , as a function of the transition rate @xmath90 and the cell s potential .",
    "the potential was varied from backward to forward biases relative to the built - in potential , uniformly spread through the cell s intrinsic region ( see  [ fig : potentialprofile ] ( b ) and ( c ) ) . for @xmath90",
    "greater than 1 ghz , we observed an effective enhancement of the liquid current , with a pronounced peak close to the built - in potential value , for potentials between 3 to 4 ev .",
    "peak intensity increases with increasing wells coupling rate until saturates for @xmath90 greater than 500 ghz .",
    "such a behavior was understood as follows .    as given by  [ eqgvilr ] ,",
    "the interband generation rate ( @xmath91 ) , and the interband recombination rate ( @xmath92 ) are determined by a conjunction of three factors - the @xmath65 step function , the fermi distributions , and the overlap between valence and intermediate subbands eigenfunctions  @xcite .",
    "therefore , due to the step function , low energetic photons ( regarding to the bands separation ) are unable to excite electrons from valence to intermediate subband .",
    "the excitation of electrons by higher energetic photons is conditioned by the external bias applied to the cell ( which controls the quasi - fermi levels ) , and by the overlap between the valence and intermediate band eigenstates ( which decreases with increasing the energy separation from each other ) .    for backward bias condition , encompassing",
    "the built - in potential condition , the hole subbands are considered to be kept filled through the equilibrium within the injection contact , while the electron subbands are considered to be kept empty by the drain ( see the quasi - fermi levels in the  [ fig : potentialprofile](b ) ) .",
    "instead , for the forward bias condition , the electron subbands are kept filled while the hole subbands are kept empty ( see the quasi - fermi levels in the  [ fig : potentialprofile](c ) ) . in the latter condition ,",
    "the current through the cell is non - null only in the presence of inelastic scattering processes  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the quasi - fermi levels , determined by the potential applied to the cell , is a fundamental factor for determining both the generation and the recombination rates . that is directly reflected in the behavior of the cell s current , as discussed next .",
    "as noted , the liquid current is non - null only for backward bias , as expected by the levels occupations . analyzing  [ eqliqdcur ] in details , the first term inside the square - brackets , related to the transitions into the lqw , presents a step - like shape being close to unit for potentials lesser than @xmath93  ev , and null elsewhere .",
    "the second term , related to the transitions into the rqw , presents the same step - like fashion whose intensity is close to unit for potentials lesser than @xmath94  ev , and null elsewhere .",
    "therefore , the subtraction between such a terms determines the peak width .",
    "the peak edges are given by the intensities relationship between the generation and recombination processes at the lqw and rqw regions .",
    "the step - like profile , discussed above , is mainly due to the step - like shape of the recombination rates @xmath95 and @xmath92 . even though the intensities of the recombination rates are three to four orders of magnitude lower then the generation ones , the last are peaked functions with maxima for specific biases , null elsewhere .",
    "for such a biases , both the first and the second terms inside the square - brackets of the  [ eqliqdcur ] are close to the unit , since the dominant terms are the generations rates . however , for biases greater than 3  ev ( 4  ev ) , @xmath92 ( @xmath95 ) is the dominant rate , becoming the square - brackets term null .",
    "consequently , the liquid current is non - null only in that specific potential range .",
    "then the inclusion of the lqw and its relationship with the rqw determines the presence of an enhancement in the cell s current .",
    "the peak width in the liquid current is , therefore , controlled by subbands occupation of both wells , which determines the recombination rates cutoffs with the potential .",
    "so , the liquid current peak could in principle be enlarged by increasing the energy separation between the rqw state ( intermediate band ) and the ground state of the lqw , responsible to uncouple the ratchet state to the valence band .",
    "the saturation , which determines the liquid current peak intensity , is mainly drive by the first term at the right - hand side of  [ eqliqdcur ] .",
    "it takes into account the relationship between both the rqw recombination ( @xmath92 ) and generation ( @xmath96 ) rates , regarding to the transition rate between the wells ( @xmath90 ) itself .",
    "once more the recombination rate @xmath92 , with the same step - like shape and maximum intensity of around 100  ghz , is responsible for controls the liquid current intensity . increasing @xmath92 decreases the electrons concentration at the intermediate band and , consequently , the probability of such electrons to be scattered to the lqw , within rate @xmath90 .",
    "therefore , for @xmath90 lesser than such a recombination rate , we expected a lay back in the cell s current as observed .",
    "our results has been shown a clear enhancement in the generation of current by the intermediate band solar cell , within the excited state of the lqw acting as a quantum ratchet state .",
    "this is in consonance with noda and coworkers  @xcite , who developed a thermodynamical model and concluded the use of intermediate band solar cells , adding the ratchet state is expected to always enhance solar cell s efficiency beyond the shockley - quiesser limit  @xcite .",
    "they also showed that the inclusion of the intermediate band by itself is not a determining condition for increasing efficiency .",
    "the work provided conditions where the intermediate band solar cells could be less efficient than singled junction ones . according to them",
    ", an intermediate band solar cell will always be more efficient then a singled junction one , and overcome the shockley - queisser limit , only when adding ratchet states .",
    "however , we observed that even introducing the quantum ratchet state , such a behavior can be changed .",
    "as discussed earlier , the liquid current behavior is a consequence of the relationship of several generation and transition processes .",
    "[ fig : ril ] , presents the liquid current behavior , for @xmath97  ghz and a backward potential of @xmath98  ev , as a function of the intersubband recombination rate @xmath80 .",
    "we can observe the change in the liquid current signal , which becomes negative for higher @xmath80 , indicating that increasing such a rate can be harmful to the liquid current for specific conditions .",
    "independently of how effective is the coupling between the intermediate band and the ratchet state , regarding of @xmath90 rate , our model shows there are conditions in which the introduction of the ratchet states is not a guarantee of increasing cell s current . allowing electrons to be scattered into the ratchet state",
    "should increase their lifetime into the intermediate band , but the relationship between the recombination and the scattering rates can both increase or decrease the solar cell current , depending on the other rates involved in the cell s dynamics .",
    ", for @xmath99  ghz and @xmath98  ev .",
    "we can observe a current s signal change around @xmath100  ghz . ]",
    "in summary , we have demonstrated the possibility of using the subbands of quantum wells as the intermediate band and ratchet state of an intermediate band solar cell with ratchet state , using a quantum cascade like approach .",
    "the cell was considered to be a double quantum well structure within gaalas and gaas layers sandwiched between heavily doped gaas contacts .",
    "the system s eigenfunctions were numerically simulated by solving the time - dependent schrdinger equation .",
    "the recombination and generation rates , used in a semiclassical rates model , were obtained by means of the fermi golden rule , within the simulated eigenstates . with allowing electron to scattering inside the ratchet state , as a lo - phonon assisted scattering , we have shown an effective increase in the cell s current for specific values of electrical potential , close to the built - in potential of the cell . agreeing with other works , the inclusion of the ratchet state increases the solar cell current , by increasing the electron s lifetime into the intermediate band . however , the addition of the ratchet state is not the unique condition determining the cell s efficiency .",
    "the recombination and generation dynamics plays a fundamental role , and we can achieve situations in which the solar cell current is decreased even with the inclusion of the ratchet state .",

    "<S> the localized conduction subband of the right - hand side quantum well is thought as the intermediated band , while the excited conduction subband of the right - hand side quantum well , coupled to right - rand side one , is thought to acts as the ratchet state . </S>",
    "<S> the photo - excited electron in the intermediate band can tunnel out the thin barrier separating the wells and accumulate into ratchet subband . </S>",
    "<S> this might raise the electron probability of being hit by a second photon and exiting out to the continuum , increasing solar cell current . </S>",
    "<S> is presented a temporal rate model for describing the charge transport properties of the cell . </S>",
    "<S> calculations are carried out by solving the time - dependent schrdinger equation applying the time evolution operator within a pertinent choice of the non - commuting kinetic and potential operators . </S>",
    "<S> the efficiency in the generation of current is analyzed directly by studying the occupation of the subbands wells in the p - i - n junction , taking into account the injection and draining dynamic provided by the electrical contacts connected to the cell . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , the efficiency in the generation of current was found to be directly correlated to the relationship between optical generation and recombination rates regarding to the scattering to the ratchet state rate . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that a good coupling between the intermediate band and the additional band is a key point to be analyzed when developing an efficient solar cell . </S>"
