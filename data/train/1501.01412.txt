    "the general properties of this stochastic system , and its application to population genetics in fluctuating environment were discussed by horsthemke and lefeve @xcite .",
    "the behavior of this system is markedly different from its mean field , deterministic approximation .",
    "indeed , the equation for @xmath10 , the mean number of individuals in one state , is : @xmath11 and has a stable stationary solution @xmath12 .",
    "however , for small values of @xmath7 ,",
    "_ i.e. _ @xmath13 , the system is observed most of time in one the two boundary states @xmath14 or @xmath15 , and seldom in states close to @xmath16 .",
    "the bistability of the system is caused solely by the noise and can not be captured by the mean field equation ( [ eq : mean ] ) .",
    "the reason behind the bistability is the following : in the absence of spontaneous switching ( @xmath17 ) , the states @xmath14 ( all individuals in configuration @xmath1 ) and @xmath15 ( all individuals in configuration @xmath0 ) are absorbing : @xmath18 .",
    "eventually , the system will end up in one of these two states and remain there .",
    "when @xmath19 , these states cease to be absorbing . however , the mean residence time @xmath20 in these states is @xmath21 ( where @xmath22 ) while the residence time in other states is @xmath23 .",
    "therefore , in the regime @xmath24 , the system is observed mostly in the boundary states .    in their article , biancalani et al .",
    "computed @xmath25 , the mean switching time ( the mean first passage time ) from state @xmath14 to state @xmath15 , and show that the observation of this quantity can lead to the measure of the parameter @xmath7 of this stochastic system . for this computation , they expanded the master equation of the stochastic system in powers of @xmath26 and neglected terms of @xmath27 to obtain the forward and backward fokker - plank equation , from which the mean switching time can be obtained ( @xcite , equation ( 4 ) and supplementary materials , equations ( 4 ) and ( 11 ) ) .",
    "this approximation is fragile , specially for small @xmath4 where the noise is strong .",
    "in particular , to compute @xmath25 , they have used two different approximations , one of which is valid for @xmath28 and the other for @xmath29 , and there is no clear criterion for their overlap . in this article , we compute the exact expression for @xmath25 without any approximation , which is valid for all values of @xmath7 .",

    "the continuous limit is however fragile when @xmath44 , and the first solution obtained by biancalani et al .",
