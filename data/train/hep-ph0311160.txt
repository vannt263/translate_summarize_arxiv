    "the field content of ueds are the zero mode standard model fields and their kk excitations , which includes both chiralities for any fermion .",
    "since fermions are generally non - chiral in five dimensions , boundary conditions at the fixed points of the orbifold may be chosen so that the appropriate chiral zero mode fields are present and the unobserved chiral modes appear for @xmath12 .",
    "the extra dimension is wrapped on a circle of radius @xmath13 , with the points @xmath7 of the extra dimension identified .",
    "equivalently , the extra dimension is a line segment with fixed points of the @xmath14 at the boundaries @xmath15 so that the fields propagate on @xmath16 $ ] .",
    "the fields are either even or odd under the @xmath14 and this parity fixes the stability of the first order kk modes implying a lightest kaluza - klein particle ( lkp ) . of course , if there are fields confined to the fixed points their interactions are not parity restricted and they can mediate transitions beween any kk levels .",
    "the effective 4d lagrangian is specified by integration over the orbifold with the usual kk masses @xmath17 from the @xmath18 terms , excluding electroweak symmetry breaking effects and yukawa couplings .",
    "the details are given , for example , in ref .",
    "we limit the discussion to the zeroth and first mode kk spectrum for the remainder of the paper for the sake of relevance and simplicity .",
    "let @xmath19 denote the lepton doublets and singlets , @xmath20 the quark doublets and singlets and @xmath21 the photon and gluon .",
    "we note that there are , for example , two first mode electrons corresponding to the singlet and doublet states . including",
    "yukawas introduces additional mixing between the singlets and the doublets within a level but the mass splitting is typically small with the exception of the top quark states .",
    "the singlet / doublet mass matrix is as follows :    @xmath22    in the above , @xmath23 refers to the mass of the corresponding sm state . for the photon and z the usual mass matrix",
    "is slightly modified :    @xmath24    most states have negligible corrections from their original @xmath25 mass so that all the fermion masses are almost degenerate with the exception of the top quark .",
    "the photon is the lkp and there is insufficient phase space ( @xmath26 ) for the 1st mode singlet electrons and muons to decay to the minimal final states of a zero mode electron ( muon ) and the lkp photon .",
    "since this holds for all @xmath27 values , charged relics are a generic prediction of ueds assuming the boundary terms are absent .",
    "we consider their production by cosmic rays in a later section .",
    "the degeneracies can be broken by nonperturbative operators which break the kk parity eliminating the lkp or perturbatively through local operators at the fixed points which renormalize the couplings .",
    "we do not consider operators which break the kk parity and forthwith discuss perturbative affects .",
    "in this section we will consider both bulk and boundary loop corrections to the masses of the kk states .",
    "we limit the analysis to the loop corrections calculated in ref .  @xcite . for the orbifold",
    "there are bulk loop corrections which alter the masses of each gauge field independent of kk level :    @xmath28    there are also boundary corrections from the orbifold construction which require infinite renormalization ( @xcite ) and the introduction of an explicit ultraviolet cutoff ( @xmath29 ) :    @xmath30    @xmath31    for the fermion corrections the sum is over the relevant gauge fields and the proportionality constants are order one .    with these corrections to the masses of the kk",
    "states we can examine the first mode mass spectrum of all the standard model kk states as the parameters @xmath32 and @xmath29 are varied . for most of the parameter space , the kk photon is the lightest mode .",
    "however , it is possible that the first mode singlet electron is the lkp or it is the next - to - lightest state and the near - degeneracy with the first mode photon prevents the decay from occuring .",
    "there is also the possibility of a near - degeneracy which allows the decay to proceed but with a sufficiently long lifetime that the state appears stable from a collider perspective .",
    "we are interested in finding the regions of parameter space which predict either a charged lkp or a long - lived charged state which appears to be stable since it decays outside the detector .",
    "= 3.2 in    generally there are three possibilities in this mued scenario depending on the mass spectrum for the 1st mode states : a lepton , or leptons are the lkp ; the photon is the lkp but the lepton - photon mass splitting is less than the sm lepton mass ; the photon is the lkp and the lepton - photon mass splitting is larger than the sm lepton mass . for the last case",
    "the decays are prompt and the phenomenology has been considered in some detail @xcite . for the case where the lkp is a lepton we will examine the implied constraints on the compactification scale from cosmic rays .",
    "if the kk lepton - photon mass splitting is less than the sm lepton mass we determine the lifetime of the kk lepton as a function of the mass splitting and classify the state as long - lived if the lifetime exceeds @xmath33 seconds .    for the long - lived states , the usual decay @xmath34 is absent kinematically .",
    "the decay can proceed via a virtual sm lepton and virtual sm w with four final states .",
    "for example , @xmath35 . in this case",
    ", the kk muon lifetime is greater than the lifetime of the sm muon ( @xmath36 ) which satisfies our criteria for a massive lepton escaping the detector so that no further calculations are necessary to determine the maximum mass splitting necessary for stable 1st mode leptons .",
    "the analysis proceeds similarly for the taus , where in this case the lifetime is sufficiently long if the 1st mode photon - tau mass difference is of the order of the sm muon mass or smaller .",
    "we examine the parameter space associated with these long - lived states .    in figure 1",
    "we determine the minimum value of the compactification scale consistent with no stable kk leptons ( solid line ) , and no long - lived muons and taus ( dashed - line ) as a function of @xmath37 .",
    "more simply stated , below the dashed line there are long - lived leptons ; below the solid line the leptons are stable .",
    "the absence of charged lkps in the low @xmath37 region is due to large negative bulk contributions to the @xmath38 field , while the boundary corrections fall off with log @xmath37 .",
    "direct bounds on the mass of heavy singly charged leptons are @xmath39 @xcite and we find mueds predict stable leptons up to @xmath40 .",
    "we consider bounds on the compactification scale from cosmic ray production for the stable kk leptons in the next section .",
    "these bounds are also applicable to the more general case in which the localized boundary terms are arbitrary and there is the possibility of a charged lkp for all values of @xmath25 .",
    "we present a quick summary of cosmic ray production of stable kk leptons and estimate the bounds derivable from null results in searches for anomalously heavy water .",
    "the details can be found in ref .",
    "we compute the qcd constituent cross sections for the kk gluons and quarks using the squared matrix elements of ref .",
    "the qcd cross sections are higher than the direct qed cross sections by a factor of @xmath41 so we neglect direct production of the lepton lkp",
    ". since we are interested in the regime where the lkp is a lepton , the kk quarks and gluons will decay into a minimum of one positively charged lkp in the final decay products .",
    "these will bind an electron becoming chemically indistinguishable from hydrogen , except its mass @xmath42 rather than @xmath43 ; the hydrogen typically forms heavy water @xcite ( assuming only half the anomalously heavy hydrogen molecules form heavy water changes the final bound by less than @xmath44 ) .",
    "smith et .",
    "@xcite has searched for these anomalously heavy water molecules and we indicate the bounds on the compactification scale from these searches in figure 2 . the dependence on @xmath29 is from converting the bound on the gluon and quark masses to the lkp mass for a given value of @xmath27 . for @xmath45 we find that @xmath46 and for @xmath47 .",
    "this appears to rule out the regions of parameter space found in the previous section predicting charged lkps .",
    "there is the possibility that non - perturbative effects alter the coefficients of the boundary terms such that a lepton is the lkp or it remains stable by kinematics .",
    "these corrections do not need to be large .",
    "the corrections to the masses of the singlet leptons in the minimal model were @xmath48 .",
    "it is easy to see that any appreciable negative corrections ( 1 percent or more ) to the masses of the fermions from unknown uv effects at the fixed points will easily push their masses below the 1st mode photon implying charged relics in the theory . in these cases the cosmic ray calculations suggest @xmath0 , comparable to electroweak precision bounds .",
    "in extra dimensional theories the level one kk states are typically degenerate in mass at tree level .",
    "if the compactification scenario introduces a discrete parity which prevents the decay of the lightest first mode states then there exists the possibility of stable charged kk states .",
    "the corrections to the tree level masses are of primary importance in determining the decay pattern for the states in the theory and depend on both loop effects and non - perturbative effects . in this paper",
    "we have considered an @xmath8 model in which all the standard model fields propagate and place bounds from cosmic ray production assuming the lkp is electrically charged . whether the lkp is charged or not depends on the unknown behavior of the theory above the cutoff .",
    "we consider a minimal model with only radiative corrections at the boundary of the @xmath8 orbifold which alters the mass spectrum and find that the model avoids charged relics above @xmath49 and long - lived leptons above @xmath50 . if there are additional corrections to the boundary operators and these corrections",
    "imply electrically charged lkps then cosmic rays place a lower bound on the compactification scale of @xmath51 independent of the cosmology of these models .",
