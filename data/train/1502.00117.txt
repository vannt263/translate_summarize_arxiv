    "modelling the dynamical coupling of electrons and nuclei beyond the born - oppenheimer ( bo ) , or adiabatic , regime is currently among the most challenging problems in the fields of theoretical chemistry and condensed matter physics . within the bo framework",
    ", molecular systems are visualized as a set of nuclei moving on a single potential energy surface that represents the effect of the electrons in a given eigenstate .",
    "many interesting phenomena , however , such as vision  @xcite , charge separation in organic photovoltaic materials  @xcite or joule heating in molecular junctions  @xcite , occur in non - adiabatic conditions . in these situations , solving exactly the time - dependent schrdinger equation ( tdse ) for the coupled system of electrons and nuclear is not feasible , as the computational cost scales exponentially with the number of degrees of freedom .",
    "however , since the full quantum treatment requires to represent the problem in terms of adiabatic states and transitions among them in regions of strong non - adiabatic coupling , wave packet propagation techniques have been developed , retaining the quantum character of the nuclear dynamics  @xcite . and",
    "these techniques are presently the state of the art in quantum dynamics computational methods , proving the benchmark for approximate methods . in fact",
    ", for large systems , the dimensionality of the problem does not allow to employ a quantum mechanical description , thus the only feasible approach is to combine a classical description for the nuclei ( or ions ) with a quantum treatment of a few other essential degrees of freedom , e.g. electrons or protons . in this context , the question of how to model the coupling between the quantum and classical subsystems still remains open , despite the fact that several schemes  @xcite have been proposed in the literature trying to settle this issue .    in recent work",
    ", we have addressed this problem in the context of the exact factorization of the electron - nuclear wave function  @xcite .",
    "in such a treatment of quantum dynamics , the solution of the tdse is written as a single product of a nuclear wave function and an electronic factor , that parametrically depends on the nuclear configuration .",
    "several advantages of this reformulation have been pointed out .",
    "first of all , it has been shown  @xcite that the nuclear wave function evolves according to a modified tdse where a time - dependent vector potential and a time - dependent scalar potential represent the effect of the electrons on the nuclei , beyond the adiabatic regime .",
    "when a classical treatment of the nuclear degrees of freedom is introduced , the coupling to the electrons is exactly represented by the force determined from the gradient of the time - dependent potentials  @xcite . on the other hand , the electronic factor evolves according to a ( less standard ) evolution equation , coupled to the nuclear tdse , where the effect of the nuclei is represented by an _ electron - nuclear coupling operator _ explicitly depending on the nuclear wave function .",
    "the analysis of the time - dependent potentials and of the classical nuclear force has been the subject of previous work .",
    "we have been able to analyze a simple model system to pinpoint some relevant features  @xcite of the potentials that should be accounted for when developing approximations . based on these observations , starting from the exact formulation ,",
    "we have proposed  @xcite a novel mixed quantum - classical algorithm to solve the coupled electronic and nuclear evolution equations in a fully approximated way .",
    "the classical limit is considered as the lowest - order , in a @xmath0-expansion , of the nuclear wave function in the complex - phase representation  @xcite .    in the present paper , the focus",
    "is directed towards the analysis of the _ electron - nuclear coupling operator _ that , in the electronic equation , mediates the coupling to the nuclei and that depends explicitly on ( the gradient of ) the nuclear wave function .",
    "it is fundamental to be able to correctly approximate such term , as it is responsible to induce electronic non - adiabatic transitions  @xcite and decoherence  @xcite .",
    "when a classical description of the nuclei is adopted , the concept of wave function is somehow lost and problems arise when approximating this operator . if a distribution of trajectories  @xcite is used to mimic the evolution of the nuclear wave function , its modulus and phase can not be smooth functions of space .",
    "the numerical error thus introduced affects the calculations , but it can be cured if refined approximations are considered .",
    "the goal of this paper is to describe a procedure to avoid the above issue and to test its efficiency against exact calculations for a simple model system .",
    "therefore , we propose here ( i ) to employ a representation of the nuclear density in terms of evolving frozen gaussians ( fgs )  @xcite , rather than trajectories , following the scheme presented in ref .",
    "@xcite and ( ii ) to estimate the phase of the nuclear wave function adopting such a fgs picture , based on a simplified form of the semiclassical herman - kluk  @xcite propagation scheme within the initial value representation ( ivr ) theory  @xcite .",
    "the model system for non - adiabatic charge transfer of ref .",
    "@xcite allows for an exact numerical solution of the full quantum mechanical problem , thus providing a benchmark to any approximation that will be considered .",
    "starting from these results , we will compute the exact time - dependent scalar potential , also referred to as time - dependent potential energy surface ( tdpes ) , in a gauge where the vector potential can be set to zero .",
    "the effect of the electrons is then fully accounted for by this tdpes , that is adopted to evolve the fgs . since the electronic part of the problem is solved exactly , the only source of error will be in this semiclassical approximation .",
    "it is worth stressing that this procedure does not result in the development of a new algorithm , but is a test of the performance of the fgs approximation of the nuclear motion .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",

    "<S> in the context of the exact factorization of the electron - nuclear wave function , the coupling between electrons and nuclei beyond the adiabatic regime is encoded ( i ) in the time - dependent vector and scalar potentials and ( ii ) in the electron - nuclear coupling operator . the former appear in the schrdinger - like equation that drives the evolution of the nuclear degrees of freedom , whereas the latter is responsible for inducing non - adiabatic effects in the electronic evolution equation . as we have devoted previous studies to the analysis of the vector and scalar potentials , in this paper we focus on the properties of the electron - nuclear coupling operator , with the aim of describing a numerical procedure to approximate it within a semiclassical treatment of the nuclear dynamics . </S>"
