    "there exists a widespread belief that future technologies will employ typical quantum features of microscopic systems , like entanglement or superpositions of quantum states .",
    "the most prominent examples are the rapid development of quantum information theory and computation theory @xcite , including realizing high - speed quantum computation , and high - security quantum communication .",
    "both quantum computation and quantum information are the study of information processing tasks that can be accomplished in quantum mechanical systems . in quantum physics ,",
    "a system composed of two or more quantum subsystems can be in a state that has no classical counterpart .",
    "it is in a superposition of two or more quantum states with a precise phase of the whole system .",
    "this property is quantum coherence , which can show entanglement .",
    "control of quantum coherence and entanglement is of great importance @xcite .",
    "the control of closed quantum systems is well established @xcite .",
    "efforts to extend these studies to open quantum systems @xcite , where the systems of interest interact with their surrounding environments , are now underway .",
    "the aim of dynamical control in open quantum systems is to suppress effects of the environment in order to preserve the quantum properties , including quantum coherence and entanglement , etc .",
    "the zeno effect has been used to achieve certain level of control on quantum systems , inhibiting the decay of excited states due to many repeated measurements .",
    "this form of quantum control has been studied in several works , including @xcite .",
    "superconducting qubits @xcite have also been studied as ways to control and interact with naturally formed quantum two - level systems in superconducting circuits .",
    "the two - level systems naturally occurring in josephson junctions constitute a major obstacle for the operation of superconducting phase qubits .",
    "since these two - level systems can possess remarkably long decoherence times , references @xcite showed that such two - level systems can themselves be used as qubits , allowing for a well controlled initialization , universal sets of quantum gates , and readout .",
    "thus , a single current - biased josephson junction can be considered as a multi - qubit register .",
    "it can be coupled to other junctions to allow the application of quantum gates to an arbitrary pair of qubits in the system .",
    "these results @xcite indicate an alternative way to control qubits coupled to naturally formed quantum two - level systems , for improved superconducting quantum information processing . indeed , these predictions have been found experimentally in @xcite .",
    "more recently , reference @xcite applies quantum control techniques to control a large spin chain by only acting on two qubits at one of its ends , thereby implementing universal quantum computation by a combination of quantum gates on the latter and swap operations across the chain .",
    "they @xcite show that the control sequences can be computed and implemented efficiently .",
    "moreover , they discuss the application of these ideas to physical systems such as superconducting qubits in which full control of long chains is challenging .",
    "considerable experimental and theoretical attentions have been paid in this field , especially using superconducting quantum circuits .",
    "reference @xcite analyzes the optical selection rules of the microwave - assisted transitions in a flux qubit superconducting quantum circuit .",
    "they @xcite show that the parities of the states relevant to the superconducting phase in the charge qubit can be controlled via the external magnetic flux .",
    "for certain values of the flux , the selection rules are the same as the ones for the electric - dipole transitions in usual atoms . in other cases ,",
    "the symmetry of the potential of the artificial  atom \" is broken , a so - called @xmath0-type  cyclic \" three - level atom is formed , where one- and two - photon processes can coexist . they also study how the population of the three states can be selectively transferred by adiabatically controlling the electromagnetic field pulses .",
    "different from @xmath0-type atoms , the adiabatic population transfer in that three - level atom can be controlled not only by the amplitudes but also controlled by the phases of the pluses .",
    "thus , they achieved a pulse - phase - sensitive adiabatic manipulation of quantum states in this three - level artificial atom .",
    "usually , only the amplitude was considered for adiabatic control .",
    "this example of control on quantum circuits has been recently studied experimentally @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "a novel approach was proposed to coherently transfer populations between selected quantum states in one and two qubit systems by using controllable stark - chirped rapid adiabatic passages ( scraps ) ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "these time - insensitive evolution transfers , assisted by easily implementable single - qubit phase - shift operations , could offer an attractive approach to implement high - fidelity single - qubit not operations for quantum computing .",
    "specifically , this proposal could be conveniently demonstrated by existing josephson phase qubits .",
    "however , a quantum system can never be isolated from the surrounding environment completely @xcite . as a result ,",
    "a randomization of the phase of the quantum system takes place , and the initial quantum state ends up in a classical state .",
    "thus , it is an important subject to analyze the quantum decay induced by the unavoidable interaction with the environment .",
    "population transfer control is an important problem with application to various quantum systems , and many results are obtained with closed - loop learning control and quantum optimal control for large transfer time , respectively .",
    "the scrap - based quantum gates proposed in @xcite evolve in the closed quantum system , in which the surrounding environment effect was not considered .",
    "recently , j. h. schnfeldt , j. twamley and s. rebi considered the closed system population transfer control in stark - shift - chirped rapid adiabatic - passage ( scrap ) technology @xcite .",
    "their main result is that by the gradient ascent pulse engineering algorithm the average fidelity of population transfer over a wide range of detunings for both the ground to excited state detuning and the ground to target state detuning can be improved . in this paper , we make use of general optimal control theory to transfer the quantum population for quantum computing in markovian open , dissipative quantum systems .    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we introduce the controlled spin - boson model . the lindblad type master equation for driven open quantum systems with the noise and dissipation effects are presented in this section . in sec .",

    "usually , identifying the nature of interactions in a quantum system is essential in understanding it .",
    "acquiring information on the hamiltonian can be difficult for many - body systems because it generally requires access to all parts of the system .",
    "reference @xcite showed that if the coupling topology is known , the hamiltonian identification is indeed possible indirectly even though only a small gateway to the system is used .",
    "surprisingly , even a degenerate hamiltonian can be estimated by applying an extra field to the gateway .",
    "this information can then be used for achieving a better control of the quantum system .    under the adiabatic approximation ,",

    "recent work @xcite has optimized the control law for closed system population transfer by using a gradient ascent pulse engineering algorithm .",
    "they shows that the optimized pulses perform at a higher fidelity than the standard gaussian pulses for a wide range of detunings ( i.e. , large inhomogeneous broadening ) .",
    "the theory of optimal control was introduced in the theory of automatic control in the 1960s for electrical engineering applications .",

    "moreover , the cost functional will vary from one experimental trial to another , and must be thought of as a random variable depending on the measurement output .",
    "the strategy is then to minimize this cost functional while satisfying the constraints of the underlying dynamic equations governing the evolution of quantum states , e.g. , the master equation and the initial state condition .",

    "smaller population transfer were observed in fig.(6 ) ( @xmath109 ) and fig.(7 ) ( @xmath110 ) .",

    "the persistence of quantum coherence is relied on in quantum computer , quantum cryptography , quantum teleportation , and it is also fundamental in understanding the quantum world for the interpretation that the emergence of the classical world from the quantum world can be seen as a decoherence process due to the interaction between system and environment . from ( [ free evolution ] ) , one can easily conclude the decoherence factor    [ 1]$ ] without control.,title=\"fig : \" ]    [ 1]$ ] with optimal control.,title=\"fig : \" ]    @xmath113    decaying exponentially to @xmath104 with rate @xmath114 .",

    "( 9 ) we find that these optimal controls can also prolong the decoherence time and satisfy the controlled quantum logic gate operations , especially in low temperature regime .",
    "in the present work , we have studied the controlled population transfer between selected quantum states in the markovian open quantum system , which can generate universal logic gates for quantum computing .",
    "we use the optimal control method to control the population transfer .",
    "our numerical results indicate that the occupation dynamics behaves differently for the different environmental condition .",
    "the result can be summed up in three rules : ( i ) the external control field plays an important role in population transfer .",
    "( ii ) the smaller the @xmath93 ( temperature ) the better the control performance , especially when @xmath112 the completely population transfer can be achieved .",
    "( iii ) when temperature is high enough the transfer is uncontrollable .",
    "solid state qubits offer remarkable advantages due to their scalability and controllability .",
    "therefore , optimal control of population transfer perhaps provides an attractive approach to generate universal logic gates .",
    "we hope such optimal control techniques to experimentally implement quantum elementary logic gates in quantum computing networks in the near future .    in this paper , we restrict the discussions to markovian open quantum systems and show the validity of our optimal control strategy to the population transfer , and we analyze corresponding decoherence behavior and we find that these controls can prolong the decoherence time and satisfy the controlled quantum logic gate operation in low temperature regime . to make the model more realistic in the experiments and reduce the low temperature constraints it is worth extending the scope to non - markovian open quantum systems where the seemingly lost information can return to the system at a later time , which is our further work .",
