    "accretion discs are responsible for some of the most energetic and spectacular phenomena in many classes of astrophysical objects , including protostars , white dwarfs ( cataclysmic variables and intermediate polars ) , neutron stars ( binary x - ray pulsars ) , and black holes ( both stellar mass x - ray transients and supermassive active galactic nuclei ) .",
    "gravitational potential energy liberated by the accretion process gives rise to exceptional luminosity excesses and can drive powerful jets and outflows .",
    "accretion onto the central object can occur only as quickly as angular momentum can be transported away from the system .",
    "furthermore , the accretion of disc material , which has high specific angular momentum , spins up the central object , if the object rotates at less than the break - up rate .",
    "it is therefore surprising that the central objects ( hereafter ` stars ' ) are often observed to spin far below their break - up rates , in spite of long - lived accretion .",
    "why does this happen ?",
    "there is good evidence that accretion onto magnetized stars occurs along closed magnetospheric field lines that connect the star to the inner edge of the disc .",
    "for instance , theoretical models of this sort have been successful in explaining numerous observed features in accreting protostars ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , intermediate polars ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , and x - ray pulsars ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in some cases , there is even direct evidence that the stars are magnetized , namely for accreting protostars @xcite , intermediate polars @xcite , and x - ray pulsars @xcite .",
    "magnetic fields can also be effective at transferring angular momentum away from the star , possibly explaining the observed rotation rates .",
    "torques on the star that are exerted by magnetic field lines anchored to the star and that are also connected to the disc have been calculated by several authors ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter ac96 ) ; @xcite ) . under certain circumstances ,",
    "this torque can counteract the angular momentum deposited by accretion , leading to a net spin - down of the star ( possibly explaining spin - down episodes observed in x - ray pulsars ; @xcite ; @xcite ) or giving rise to an equilibrium state , in which the net torque on the star is zero ( possibly explaining the slow spin of some accreting protostars ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter k91 ) ) . in this equilibrium state ,",
    "the spin rate of the central object depends on the accretion rate in the disc , and so a system is then considered to be ` disc locked . '",
    "since these models for the magnetic star - disc interaction show that accreting stars can spin more slowly than the break - up rate , there is a general perception that the presence of an accretion disc in any system leads to slow rotation rates .",
    "this idea of disc locking has been applied to a variety of problems . as an example , in systems where the moment of inertia of the star is changing ( e.g. , during contraction ) , some authors have assumed that disc - locking keeps the star at a constant spin rate ( e.g. , as applied to protostars by @xcite ; and suggested for stellar collision products by @xcite ) .",
    "there is a nagging problem with this physical picture , however , because the magnetic torque calculations discussed above ( with the exception of @xcite ) assume that the stellar magnetic field remains largely closed and that field lines connect to a large portion of the disc .",
    "this assumption is questionable because closed magnetic structures tend to open when enough energy is added to them , and these systems possess a natural source of energy in the form of gravitational potential energy that is released during disc accretion .",
    "this energy release can drive outflows and twist field lines , thereby adding energy to the magnetic field .",
    "thus , the general surplus of energy in accreting systems suggests that associated magnetic fields should be dominated by open , rather than closed , topologies .",
    "how are low spin rates achieved in this case ?    in this paper , we generalize the star - disc interaction model to include the effect of varying field topology ( i.e. , connectedness ) .",
    "we consider the mechanical energy that is added to the field via differential rotation between the star and disc as the only mechanism responsible for opening the field ( though our formulation is easily adaptable for other mechanisms ) .",
    "the time - dependent behavior of a dipole stellar field attached to a rotating , conducting disc has been studied , using an analytic approach , by several authors ( e.g. , @xcite ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter ukl ) ) . they have shown that , as the differential twist angle between the star and disc @xmath2 monotonically increases , the torque exerted by field lines first reaches a maximum value , then decreases .",
    "this occurs because azimuthal twisting of the dipole field lines generates an azimuthal component to the field , and the magnetic pressure associated with this component acts to inflate the field , which then balloons outward at an angle of @xmath3 from the rotation axis , causally disconnecting the star and disc ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "typically , this inflation or opening of the field occurs when a critical differential rotation angle of @xmath4 has been reached , and the amount of flux that opens depends on the strength of the magnetic coupling of the field to the disc ( ukl ) .",
    "this analytic work on the field opening has been corroborated by time - dependent , numerical magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the stellar dipole - disc interaction @xcite .",
    "our primary goal in this paper is to determine the effect of the topology of the magnetic field on the torques in the steady - state , star - disc interaction model . in a previous paper @xcite",
    ", we gave a brief outline of this theory and showed that a more open ( i.e. , less connected ) field topology results in a spin - down torque on the star that is less than for the closed field assumption .",
    "consequently , the equilibrium state ( with a net zero torque ) features a faster spin than predicted by previous models , which calls into question the general belief that accretion discs necessarily lead to slow rotation .",
    "the present paper contains a more detailed presentation of the theory and our assumptions , and we consider all possible spin states of the system ( not just the equilibrium state ) .",
    "we also extend our analysis to show that there are at least three different modes in which a magnetic star - disc system can operate .",
    "our analysis is applicable to all classes of magnetized objects that accrete from keplerian discs .",
    "however , since an abundance of observational data exists for accreting protostars , in particular for classical t tauri stars ( ctts s ) , we adopt a set of fiducial parameters that are appropriate for these systems and discuss various aspects of the model in this context .",
    "section [ sec_stardisc ] contains a formulation of the general model .",
    "the special case of a disc locked system is the topic of section [ sec_equilib ] .",
    "the final section (  [ sec_discussion ] ) contains a summary of our results and includes a list of problems with using the disc - locking scenario to explain ctts spins , plus a discussion of three possible configurations of the general system .",
    "magnetic , star - disc interaction models in the literature differ in their various assumptions , adopted parameter values , and in the introduction of ` fudge factors , ' but they are quite similar on the whole ( for a review , see * ? ? ?",
    "we formulate a general model that builds upon this previous work ( mostly following ac96 ) , by including the effect of varying magnetic field topology , via the introduction of the physical parameters @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( defined below ) .    according to the usual model assumptions ,",
    "a rotating star is surrounded by a thin , keplerian accretion disc .",
    "the angular momentum vector of the disc is aligned with that of the star , which rotates as a solid body and at a rate that is some fraction of break - up speed , defined by @xmath7 where @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 are the angular rotation rate , radius , and mass of the star , respectively .",
    "note that @xmath11 is always within the range from zero to one @xcite , in which the star is actually spun down by accretion toward @xmath12 , even without any magnetic torques .",
    "however , we only consider cases with @xmath13 in this paper , since this characterizes the spin of observed protostellar systems . ] .",
    "the disc rotates at a different angular rate than the star at all radii , except at the singular corotation radius given by @xmath14 for @xmath15 , the disc rotates faster than the star , while for @xmath16 , the angular rotation rate of the star is greater than that of the disc .",
    "the disc is assumed to be in a steady - state wherein the mass accretion rate @xmath17 is constant in time and at all radii . in a real disc from which winds are launched",
    ", @xmath17 may have a weak radial dependence , but we assume this has a negligible effect on the model .",
    "a rotation - axis - aligned dipole magnetic field , anchored into the stellar surface , also connects to the disc .",
    "the field is strong enough to truncate the disc at some inner location @xmath18 from where disc material is subsequently channeled along magnetic field lines as it accretes onto the star . in general",
    ", the disc may have its own magnetic field ( either generated in a disc dynamo or carried in by the disc from larger scales ) .",
    "we do not specifically include this field in the model , though it may be responsible for angular momentum transport in the disc ( providing @xmath17 ) and may also aid in the connection of the stellar field to the disc . within the disc ,",
    "the kinetic energy of the gas is much greater than the magnetic energy of the stellar field , but the region above the star and disc ( the corona ) is filled with low density material , and so the corona is magnetically dominated .    in this configuration ,",
    "the magnetic field connects the star and disc by conveying torques between the two .",
    "torques are conveyed on an alfvn wave crossing time , which is much shorter than the keplerian orbital time .",
    "everywhere that the magnetic field connects the star to the disc , exept at @xmath19 , the magnetic field is twisted azimuthally by differential rotation between the two . inside @xmath19",
    "the field is twisted such that field lines ` lead ' the stellar rotation , so torques from field lines threading the region @xmath15 act to spin up the star ( and spin down the disc ) .",
    "conversely , torques from field lines threading @xmath20 act to spin the star down ( and spin the disc up ) .",
    "the accretion of disc matter onto the star also deposits angular momentum onto the star .     to @xmath21 , reaching beyond @xmath19 in this case .",
    "the stellar field dominates the accretion flow onto the star ( arrow ) .",
    "[ fig_cartoon ] ]    in order for disc material to accrete , @xmath18 must be less than @xmath19 so that accreting material loses angular momentum to the star as it falls inward . in order for the star with @xmath22 to feel any spin down torques from the disc ,",
    "the stellar field must connect to the disc beyond @xmath19 . under this condition , the field that connects outside @xmath19 transfers angular momentum from the star to the disc . to maintain a steady accretion rate",
    ", the disc must then transport this excess angular momentum outward , resulting in an altered disc structure @xcite .",
    "we will define @xmath21 as the outermost radial extent of the magnetic connection , and the usual assumption is that @xmath23 .",
    "figure [ fig_cartoon ] illustrates the basic picture , and shows the locations of @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath21 for a possible configuration of the star - disc interaction model .",
    "the assumption of a dipole field refers to the poloidal component of the field , @xmath24 , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the cylindrical @xmath27 and @xmath28 components of the magnetic field , and the closed field only exists in the region interior to @xmath21 .",
    "the dipole field is used for simplicity and because it has the weakest radial dependence ( @xmath29 along the equator ) of any natural magnetic multipole . in reality",
    ", the twisting of dipole field lines alters the poloidal field , but this perturbation should be slight in the region where the magnetic field remains closed ( as justified by the work cited in ",
    "[ sec_intro ] , e.g. , ukl , and see also @xcite ) .    for discussion throughout this paper , it is often instructive to use physical units , especially for comparison with observations . for this purpose",
    ", we adopt a set of observationally determined ` fiducial parameters ' that are appropriate for ctts s ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the stellar magnetic field strength at the equator",
    ". however , our formulation of the problem is applicable to any magnetic star - disc system .",
    "the torque exerted by magnetic field lines threading an annulus of the disc of radial width @xmath32 is given by ( e.g. , ac96 ) @xmath33 where @xmath34 here , @xmath35 is the dipole moment and @xmath36 is the azimuthal component of the magnetic field .",
    "the radial component , @xmath25 , is assumed to be negligible within the disc , the torque has been vertically integrated through the disc , and @xmath36 refers to the value at the disc surface . here , and throughout this paper , we choose the sign of the torque to be relative to the star such that a positive torque spins the star up , and consequently spins the disc down ( and vice versa for a negative torque ) .",
    "the differential magnetic torque of equation [ eqn_dtmag ] depends not only on @xmath35 , but also @xmath37 , which is the ` twist , as discussed by ukl , though @xmath2 and @xmath37 are intimately related . ] , ' or pitch angle , of the field .",
    "the total ( integrated ) magnetic torque will also depend on the size and radial location of the magnetically connected region in the disc . while @xmath35 is a constant parameter of the system ,",
    "the radial dependence of @xmath37 depends on the physical coupling of the magnetic field to the disc .    in general , the coupling is not perfect .",
    "magnetic forces act to resist the twisting of the field , and so the field will ` slip ' backward through the disc at some rate @xmath38 proportional to @xmath37 .",
    "the exact slipping rate depends upon which physical mechanism is at work . in the literature ,",
    "there are generally three mechanisms discussed ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : 1 ) magnetic reconnection in the disc , 2 ) reconnection outside the disc , and 3 ) turbulent diffusion of the magnetic field through the disc .",
    "we adopt the latter mechanism , but we further discuss the other two , below .",
    "the magnetic field slips azimuthally at a speed ( e.g. , @xcite ; ukl ) @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the turbulent magnetic diffusivity , @xmath41 is the local disc scale height , @xmath42 is the keplerian orbital speed , and we have introduced the dimensionless ` diffusion parameter ' @xmath43 .",
    "the variable @xmath5 simply parametrizes the coupling of the stellar magnetic field to the disc such that @xmath44 corresponds to weak coupling , and @xmath45 to strong coupling .    generally , @xmath5 is a scale factor that compares @xmath38 to @xmath42 , and we have chosen this generic formulation so that the system behavior is largely independent of any particular disc model  as long as the disc obeys keplerian rotation and provides a steady accretion rate . however ,",
    "if we temporarily consider a standard @xmath46-disc @xcite , we may rewrite our diffusivity parameter @xmath5 in a more physically revealing way : @xmath47 where @xmath46 has its usual meaning and @xmath48 is the turbulent prandtl number , equal to the turbulent viscosity divided by @xmath49 .",
    "the disc turbulence is likely to be driven by the magneto - rotational instability ( mri ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which follows the general behavior of an @xmath46-disc .",
    "since both @xmath46 and @xmath50 typically have weak radial dependences , and the value of @xmath48 is unknown , we assume that @xmath5 is constant in the region of the disc connected to the stellar field .    the value of @xmath5 is not well constrained ( ac96 used @xmath51 ) , but extreme @xmath46-disc parameters give an upper limit of @xmath52 . for a more reasonable estimate , note that a thin disc usually means @xmath53 , and @xmath46 is typically in the range of 0.001 to 0.1 @xcite .",
    "so , assuming @xmath48 is of order unity , @xmath54 .",
    "we get a similar estimate using equation [ eqn_vd ] and reasonable guesses for ctts disc parameters , @xmath55 however , given the uncertainties and possible variation among different systems , and to assess the effect of the coupling of the field to the disc , we retain @xmath5 as a free parameter .    )",

    "the dotted lines indicate critical radii for a field - opening twist of @xmath56 ( chosen for illustrative purposes ) .",

    "thus the magnetic field will quickly achieve a steady - state configuration in which @xmath38 equals the local differential rotation rate ( e.g. , ukl ) , which gives @xmath59.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the solid line in figure [ fig_gamma ] shows the quantity @xmath60 as a function of radius ( normalized to @xmath19 ) along the surface of the disc .",
    "the magnetic twist is zero at @xmath19 , and is oppositely directed on either side of @xmath19 .",
    "also , at a given radius , the twist will be larger for smaller values of @xmath5 ( and vice versa ) .",
    "we have assumed that the field coupling is determined by turbulent diffusion , and when @xmath5 is constant , we find that @xmath61 ( eq .  [ eqn_gamma ] , for @xmath62 ) . other coupling mechanisms ( as discussed above ) result in a different radial dependence of @xmath37 .",
    "for example , @xcite showed that if the twist is limited by reconnection in the disc , @xmath63 ( for @xmath62 ) , while for reconnection outside the disc , @xmath37 approaches a constant value ( for @xmath62 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "@xcite and ac96 , assumed @xmath37 was limited by reconnection in the stellar corona , and they used the same formulation as equation [ eqn_gamma ] ( with @xmath51 ) . in any case , note that the radial dependence of the differential magnetic torque is dominated by the falloff of the dipole magnetic field ( which results in the @xmath64 dependence of eq .",
    "[ eqn_dtmag ] ) .",
    "therefore , the choice of magnetic coupling mechansim will not much influence our results ( ac96 ) .",
    "similarly , a small radial dependence of @xmath5 ( which we take as constant ) will not introduce a large error .      as discussed in section [ sec_intro ] , several authors have shown that dipole field lines will transition from a closed to an open topology when a critical differential rotation angle of @xmath65 has been reached .",
    "this corresponds to a critical field twist of @xmath66 .",
    "since the twisting of field lines does not significantly alter the poloidal configuration of the field lines that remain closed , and as an approximation , we will assume that the opening of field lines is only important for the determination of the size of the connected region ( i.e. , to determine @xmath21 ) .",
    "thus , we include the effect of field line opening in the steady - state torque theory in the following manner : we will use equation [ eqn_gamma ] only where @xmath67 and assume that the field will be open everywhere else ( a similar approach was used by @xcite and justified by the work of ukl ) .",
    "in other words , wherever equation [ eqn_gamma ] predicts @xmath68 , the magnetic connection is assumed to be severed , so the star and disc are causally diconnected , such that no torques can be conveyed between the two .",
    "the size of the connected region in a keplerian disc is then limited to a finite radial extent near @xmath19 , where the differential rotation between the star and disc is the smallest .",
    "will field lines , once opened by differential rotation , remain open ?",
    "it has been suggested that such field lines could reconnect in the current sheet formed during the opening @xcite . in order for this to be important",
    ", the time - scale for reconnection should be comparable to or shorter than that for field line opening .",
    "it is not clear whether this is the case in these systems @xcite , but even if it is , there are other considerations . first , due to the topology of the field , reconnection must initially occur between open field lines at the smallest radii ( connecting to the lowest latitude on the star ) .",
    "it is possible that , if reconnection does occur , only a small amount of flux will be able to reconnect before this newly connected field again begins to open ( as in the simulations of * ? ? ?",
    "* and see @xcite ) .",
    "in this case , the size of the connected region ( in a time - averaged sense ) will be only slightly larger than if the reconnection were never to occur .",
    "second , the configuration of the opened field is favorable to launch magnetocentrifugal flows from the disc @xcite .",
    "we ignore such outflows in our model , but in a real system , they could help to maintain an open magnetic field configuration .",
    "thus we conclude that , once the field has opened , reconnection along the current sheet is unlikely to significantly affect the size of the connected region .",
    "it is instructive to look at the maximum possible spin - down torque in this system .",
    "regardless of any disc model or any magnetic coupling physics , the largest possible magnetic torque on a star that connects to a disc via a dipole magnetic field occurs when the field is maximally twisted ( @xmath69 ) at all radii along the surface of the disc .",
    "spin - down torques on the star only occur along field lines threading the disc outside @xmath19 .",
    "also , the accretion of mass from a keplerian disc always adds angular momentum to the star .",
    "therefore , the largest net spin - down torque on the star occurs when the disc is truncated exactly at the corotation radius ( @xmath70 ) , the field threads the disc to @xmath71 , and the disc does not accrete ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "one then integrates equation [ eqn_dtmag ] from @xmath19 to @xmath73 to get @xmath74 this is the absolute maximum spin - down torque that a star can undergo from a disc that exists in the equatorial plane and to which the star is connected via a dipole magnetic field .",
    "it is even independent of the rotation profile of the disc , except that angular rotation rate of the disc is slower than the star outside some radius @xmath19 .",
    "it is also independent of the angular momentum transport mechanism within the disc .    to achieve this maximal torque",
    "requires that a ) the field twist has no radial dependence and b ) the twist is very nearly equal to the maximum allowed value of @xmath6 .",
    "if the coupling of the field to a keplerian disc is determined by turbulent diffusion , a constant @xmath37 can only be achieved in the unlikely event that @xmath49 decreases with radius to exactly counteract the increase in differential rotation rate .",
    "alternatively , reconnection in the stellar or disc corona may also lead to a constant @xmath37 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* but see discussion in  [ sub_maxtwist ] ) .",
    "however , in either case , it is not clear why the value of the constant twist would necessarily be near the maximal value @xmath6 ( instead of , e.g. , @xmath75 ) .",
    "though this torque may not be very realistic , it is similar in strength to the spin - down torque used in previous models ( e.g. , it is the equivalent to the solution of ac96 , for @xmath76 ) .      to derive a more realistic magnetic torque ,",
    "we adopt equation [ eqn_gamma ] for the radial dependence of @xmath37 .",
    "following @xcite , we assume that this equation is only valid where @xmath77 , and that the field is open everywhere else .",
    "thus , equation [ eqn_gamma ] predicts that the outer radius of the magnetically connected region in the disc is @xmath78 there is a corresponding location insided @xmath19 at which the twist formally exceeds the critical value , given by @xmath79 the dotted lines in figure [ fig_gamma ] indicate these radii for @xmath80 , in which case @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "it is evident that the field topology is a function of @xmath83 such that more diffusion in the disc allows for a larger connected region .",
    "note that , if @xmath84 , the field can remain connected to the disc at any @xmath15 ( since @xmath57 is then not defined ) .",

    "* ) , is equivalent to @xmath85the field is allowed to twist to arbitrarily large values without opening . in order to consider the effect of varying topology ( i.e. , where the field is open beyond some finite @xmath21 ) , we adopt a value of @xmath76 ( as justified by , e.g. , ukl ) .",
    "however , we will retain @xmath6 as a parameter in all of our formulae for a comparison between the two cases ( @xmath85 and @xmath76 ) and so that different values of @xmath6 may be considered by the reader .",

    "however , for the more likely value of @xmath163 ( dotted lines in fig .",
    "[ fig_fequil ] ) , the predicted spin period is an order of magnitude lower than the ` standard prediction , ' which can not be reconciled by observational errors .",
    "it is important to determine how quickly the star will spin up or down to reach the equilibrium state . rather than fully solving the time - dependent problem , which should also include the spin - up due to the contraction of the protostar ( e.g. , * ?",
    "* ) , one typically estimates a characteristic spin - down time using the angular momentum of the star , @xmath209 , divided by the net torque on the star . to be more precise , and for arbitrary spin rates",

    "assuming solid body rotation of the star , the characteristic time to reach spin equilibrium is then @xmath210 which corresponds to a spin - up ( down ) time for a star currently spinning slower ( faster ) than @xmath194 .",
    "if @xmath211 is long compared to the time - scale for other system parameters to change ( e.g. , compared to the lifetime of the disc ) , the star is unlikely to ever be in a spin equilibrium state .",

    "the vertical dotted lines indicate the equilibrium spin rate , for each case . [ fig_sdtimes ] ]    figure [ fig_sdtimes ] shows @xmath211 for the adopted fiducial parameters , as a function of the spin rate fraction @xmath11 and for different values of @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "it is evident from the figure that @xmath211 generally decreases for increasing @xmath11 , since faster spin means @xmath19 is closer to the star so the magnetic torque will be stronger ( whether it spins the star up or down ) .",
    "there is an exception to this when the star spins much slower than @xmath216 .",
    "for example , for the case with @xmath217 = ( 0.01 , 1 ) , when @xmath218 , @xmath211 decreases with decreasing @xmath11 .",
    "this can be understood , since then @xmath180 decreases rapidly with decreasing @xmath11 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_rtrstar ] ) , leading to much stronger magnetic spin - up torques .",
    "note also that the cases with @xmath219 = ( 0.01 , 1 ) and ( 0.1 , 1 ) are in state 1 for @xmath220 and 0.033 , respectively , in which @xmath167 .    for the ` standard ' prediction with @xmath217 = ( 1 , @xmath73 ) , @xmath211 is always less than @xmath221 years , which is much shorter than the expected disc lifetime of more than @xmath222 years @xcite .",
    "however , when one considers the effect of a more open field topology ( @xmath76 ) , the magnetic torques is reduced , and so @xmath211 is longer and increases when @xmath5 decreases . for the likely case with @xmath217 = ( 0.01 , 1 ) , @xmath223 years .",
    "this is still relatively short compared to the expected disc lifetime .",
    "therefore , we agree with previous authors ( e.g. , k91 ; ac96 ) that systems such as those considered above should exist near their equilibrium spin states throughout most of their accretion lifetimes , but only if @xmath224 . however , the effect of a more open field topology is that the equilibrium spin rate is much faster than previously predicted .",
    "we note in passing that the characteristic time @xmath211 we have calculated here is significantly shorter than recently calculated by @xcite .",
    "hartmann s estimate assumes that the upper limit to the spin - down torque on the star is equal to @xmath225 .",
    "however , as discussed in section [ sub_torques ] , this is the torque necessary to provide a steady accretion rate of @xmath17 through the radius @xmath21 . in order for the disc to exert a spin - down torque on the star ( via the magnetic connection ) , it must provide a torque _ in addition to _",
    "@xmath226 , requiring the disc to have a different structure than in the absence of a stellar field ( see * ? ? ?",
    "it is not yet clear to what extent the disc can be restructured ( before accretion will cease ) , and so hartmann s estimate does not represent a true limit .",
    "we extended the standard picture of the interaction of magnetized star with a steady - state accretion disc .",
    "our more comprehensive formulation of this problem allows us to determine the location of the disc truncation radius @xmath18 and calculate the torque on the star for a system with arbitrary values of @xmath17 , @xmath8 , @xmath10 , @xmath9 , @xmath31 , and @xmath5 , which parametrizes the coupling of the magnetic field to the disc .",
    "we consider only two sources for the torques : ( a ) torque from the angular momentum deposited by accretion of disc material from @xmath18 , and ( b ) torques exerted by field lines connecting the star to the disc over the region from @xmath18 to @xmath21 .",
    "our model resembles several previous studies ( e.g. , ac96 ) , except that we have now determined the dependence of the torques on the magnetic coupling to the disc .",
    "specifically , the differential rotation between the star and disc results in a largely open topology ( e.g. , ukl ) , so the size of the region of the disc that is magnetically connected to the star is smaller ( i.e. , @xmath21 is smaller ) .",
    "thus , when one considers this effect , the magnetic spin - down torque on the star is less than if one assumes the field remains everywhere closed .",
    "the strongest spin - down torque occurs for intermediate magnetic field coupling ( @xmath51 ) , in which case the spin - down torque is a factor of four less than for the closed field assumption . for strong magnetic coupling ( @xmath160 ) ,",
    "as expected near the inner edge of an accretion disc , @xmath21 is very close to @xmath19 , and the spin - down torque then is proportional to @xmath5 . for the likely value of @xmath207",
    ", the spin - down torque is 100 times less than for the closed field assumption !",
    "furthermore , the possibility that field lines may open inside @xmath19 characterizes a new mode ( state 1 ) in the system , in which the star feels no spin - down torques from field lines connected to the disc .",
    "three possible system states are summarized in section [ sub_3states ] .",
    "we also considered the disc - locked state of the system , in which the net torque on the star is zero .",
    "a more open field topology leads to an equilibrium state that has a higher stellar spin rate .",
    "the time for a given system to reach spin equilibrium is also longer when the field is more open .",
    "these results apply to any system in which accretion occurs onto a magnetized central object . in the general case ,",
    "not all of the system parameters are observationally known .",
    "thus , one often assumes that a particular system is disc - locked , and then ` tunes ' the unknown system parameter(s ) to satisfy equation [ eqn_spineq ] .",
    "we found that , equation [ eqn_spineq ] contains the function @xmath192 , which is plotted in figure [ fig_cbg ] ( solid line ) , as a function of @xmath5 .",
    "it is evident , that when the coupling of the field to the disc is strong ( @xmath159 ) or weak ( @xmath44 ) , the ` tunable ' system parameters will be significantly different than for the usual assumption that @xmath227 is a constant near unity",
    ". in particular , systems that are thought to be disc - locked will require a larger @xmath35 , larger @xmath194 , smaller @xmath10 , or smaller @xmath17 than calculated using previous formulations of equation [ eqn_spineq ] .",
    "in the next section , we discuss the implications of these results , and recent results from the literature , for disc - locking in ctts s .",
    "observational support for disc locking in ctts s is still controversial ( in particualar , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so we have taken another look at the problem from a theoretical standpoint .",
    "we find that spin - down torques on a ctts are significantly reduced for strong coupling of the stellar field to the disc ( small @xmath5 ) , resulting in equilibrium spin periods as low as a few days or less , for a wide range of system parameters ( see fig .  [ fig_fequil ] ) .",
    "small values of @xmath5 are likely for ctts s ( see  [ sec_twist ] ) , although @xmath5 is a highly uncertain parameter to calculate from first principles and may even vary from system to system .",
    "also , as discussed in section [ sub_tmaxtwist ] , there may exist special circumstances that allow the field to remain connected , but whether these circumstances can exist in ctts systems remains to be shown .",
    "therefore , while our analysis of the problem ( in  [ sec_equilib ] ) does not completely rule out the possibility for disc locking in all systems ( particularly for fast rotators ) , it significantly reduces the likelyhood that disc - locking can explain the existence of accreting stars spinning at @xmath228% ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) of break - up speed .",
    "there are several other issues in recent literature that , when combined with our analysis , cast additional doubt on the applicability of disc - locking to the slow rotators .",
    "the most notable observational challenge to the disc - locking model is the apparent lack of strong dipole fields on ctts s ( first suggested by * ? ? ?",
    "it is generally accepted that ctts s have field strengths of a few kiloguass .",
    "this was predicted by k91 , and subsequent observations @xcite have indeed found a _",
    "mean _ field on the surface of the central stars of typically 2 kg .",
    "thus far in our analysis , we have adopted a field strength of 2 kg to represent a typical ctts system and guide our discussion . however ,",
    "stringent measurements of the mean _ line of sight _ field have been carried out for three ctts s , bp tau @xcite , tw hya @xcite , and t tau @xcite , and all measurements give an upper limit of roughly 200 g for the strength of the dipole component of the stellar magnetic field .",
    "the measured mean fields of 2 kg thus represent a field that is disordered or characterized by multipoles of higher order than a dipole @xcite .",
    "such high order fields , even if very strong on the stellar surface , decrease in strength too quickly with increasing radius to exert significant spin - down torques , especially for slow rotators in which @xmath19 is at several stellar radii . furthermore , a 200 g dipole field can not exert a significant spin - down torque on a ctts , even if the field connects to the disc everywhere outside @xmath19 .",
    "this is evident , for example , in the upper right panel of figure [ fig_fequil ] , which indicates that the equilibrium spin period for a star with such a field is less than one day .",
    "for the cases with @xmath76 and @xmath229 , there is no equilibrium possible , since the magnetic spin - down torques are not strong enough to counteract the angular momentum added by accretion , even for maximal stellar spin ( @xmath12 ) . also",
    ", the time to reach equilibrium ( for cases in which equilibrium is possible ; as discussed in  [ sub_time ] ) increases by an order of magnitude when @xmath31 = 200 g , compared to 2 kg .",
    "second is the issue pointed out by @xcite and discussed in section [ sub_rteq ] that stars in their disc - locked state must have @xmath230 , for a wide range of possible assumptions in the model .",
    "interestingly , @xcite concluded that , for their ctts sample , the typical value of @xmath180 was in the range of 0.6 to 0.8 , well below the disc - locked value .",
    "if true , these stars can not be disc - locked , since the sum of the accretion torque and the torque carried by field lines connected to the disc will be positive ( spinning the stars up ; see  [ sub_tmag ] and [ sub_rteq ] ) .",
    "thus , these stars can only be in spin equilibrium if they feel significant spin - down torques _",
    "other than _ those from field lines connecting them to their discs .",
    "this conclusion does not depend on whether or not the stellar field can open , since the calculation of @xmath18 in equilibrium also does not .",
    "finally , ctts s may drive stellar winds @xcite , and outflows from the disc are known to explain several aspects of observed protostellar outflows ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "ionized winds escape from regions with open magnetic field lines , or they can themselves open the field ( e.g. , as in the solar wind ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , disconnecting the star and disc .",
    "@xcite concluded that ctts s winds should open all stellar field lines beyond roughly 3 @xmath9 .",
    "furthermore , a recent measurement of rotation in the jet from the ctts dg tau ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and see @xcite ) suggests that the low velocity component ( @xmath231 km s@xmath1 ) originates in the disc from as close as 0.3 au from the star @xcite .",
    "this is likely an upper limit @xcite , and the more tightly collimated , high velocity component ( @xmath232 km s@xmath1 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) must then originate from well within this radius in the disc @xcite .",
    "theoretical disc - wind models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) predict jet speeds of the order of the keplerian velocity from where the wind is launched , and observed protostellar jets typically travel with speeds of a few hundred km s@xmath1 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "considering a star with @xmath233 and @xmath234 , and assuming @xmath235 km s@xmath1 at the launch point , this requires the disc winds to originate from near @xmath236 .",
    "these ionized disc winds prevent the star from being magnetically connected to the disc beyond the innermost location of the wind launching point ( effectively giving an upper limit to @xmath21 ) , and these winds carry angular momentum from the disc , not from the star . as calculated in this paper , a reduced size of the connected region leads to a reduced spin - down torque on the star , regardless of the cause of the field opening .",
    "protostellar outflows thus provide an independent and stringent constraint on disc - locking models .",
    "we conclude that spin - down torques exerted by field lines connecting the star to the disc outside @xmath19 are likely to be much weaker than usually assumed .",
    "therefore , the existence of slowly rotating ( @xmath237 , or perhaps higher ) ctts s probably can not be explained by a disc - locking scenario .",
    "either these stars are all in the process of spinning up , or the stars feel torques other than those related to a magnetic connnection to the accretion disc . given that the typical spin - up times for these systems are short ( see  [ sub_time ] ) , the latter possibility appears the most likely .",
    "we identified three possible configurations of the system , determined by the location of @xmath18 , relative to the two key radii @xmath57 ( eq.[eqn_rin ] ) and @xmath19 .",
    "there are two accreting configurations , which we call states 1 and 2 , and one non - accreting configuration , state 3 . here",
    ", we summarize the conditions that determine and characterize each state .    figure [ fig_states ] illustrates the basic magnetic configuration of the three states , which may even represent an evolutionary sequence for a system with ( e.g. ) an evolving @xmath17 ( see  [ sub_states ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig_rteq_rcor ] shows the location of @xmath182 ( curved , dashed line ) for various values of @xmath238 , and the horizontal dashed line represents the location of @xmath19 .",
    "for a system with a given value of @xmath83 and for which @xmath18 is determined , the figure indicates which state the system will be in and whether the star should be spinning up or down .      this state is a direct consequence of the opening of field lines via the differential rotation between the star and disc .",
    "when @xmath18 is sufficiently less than @xmath19 ( i.e. , when @xmath87 ) , the magnetic field becomes highly twisted there , opening the field inside @xmath19 and resulting in a highly open field topology .",
    "note that state 1 , in this context , is only possible for @xmath240 , since otherwise @xmath57 is undefined ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_rteq_rcor ] and discussion in  [ sub_rinrout ] ) .",
    "as illustrated in the top panel of figure [ fig_states ] and discussed in section [ sub_rt ] , the stellar field in state 1 connects only to a very small , innermost region of the disc near @xmath18 , and all exterior field lines are open .",
    "the size of the small connected region is likely to be determined by dissipative processes within the disc , but we do not attempt to calculate this here .",
    "the location of @xmath18 is determined by equation [ eqn_rt2 ] ( and see fig .",
    "[ fig_rtrstar ] ) , and accretion onto the star occurs from there .",
    "a star in this state will always feel a net positive torque from the disc , since no field connects outside @xmath19 .",
    "specifically , the star is spun up by the accretion torque ( @xmath165 ; eq .",
    "[ eqn_tacc ] ) , and equation [ eqn_tmag ] for the magnetic torque is not applicable .",
    "in fact , since @xmath18 increases with stellar field strength , and since @xmath241 , the presence of a stellar field actually _ increases _ the spin up torque on the star , relative to non - magnetic accretion . in any case",
    ", a system in state 1 can not be in spin equilibrium , unless it receives torques other than those considered in this paper .",
    "is state 1 a likely , or even common , configuration for accreting systems ?",
    "figure [ fig_rteq_rcor ] indicates that , when the magnetic coupling to the disc is strong , the range of possible values of @xmath18 for which a system can be in state 2 is significantly reduced .",
    "for example , if @xmath242 , any system with @xmath243 should be in state 1 .",
    "the specific conditions under which any given system will be in state 1 is given by equation [ eqn_trans ] .",
    "for illustrative purposes , we can solve this equation ( and using eq.[eqn_psi ] ) for the mass accretion rate .",
    "assuming @xmath244 , @xmath207 , and @xmath245 , and using the fiducial ctts values ( see discussion above  [ sec_twist ] ) , one finds that a system should be in state 1 if @xmath246 this threshold value of @xmath17 is an order of magnitude larger than the fiducual value , suggesting that ctts slow rotators will most commonly exist in state 2 .",
    "however , equation [ eqn_mtrans ] assumes a magnetic field strength of 2 kg , and as discussed in section [ sub_problems ] , the stars likely have surface dipole field strengths of less than 200 g. this consideration decreases the threshold value of @xmath17 by at least two orders of magnitude , suggesting that typical ctts systems may exist in state 1 .",
    "we can also look at this from the standpoint of stellar spin , using equation [ eqn_trans ] , which indicates that a system with the adopted fiducial parameters ( but with @xmath247 g ) will be in state 1 if it spins more slowly than 26% of break - up speed .",
    "( as discussed in section [ sub_rt ] , this also corresponds an upper limit of @xmath248 . )",
    "thus , if the dipole fields are indeed weak , it is more likely that slow rotators , and even some fast rotators , will be in state 1 .",
    "furthermore , the conclusion of @xcite , that @xmath180 typically ranges from 0.6 to 0.8 , suggests that ctts s will be in state 1 , as long as @xmath188 ( see  [ sub_rteq ] ) .",
    "we have thus far considered the opening of field lines via the differential rotation , so the existence of state 1 requires that @xmath83 is significantly less than unity .",
    "given the large uncertainty in the value of @xmath5 in real systems , it is still not clear whether or not state 1 should be common . from the standpoint of torques on the star ,",
    "the most important feature of state 1 is that the stellar field never connects to the disc outside @xmath19 .",
    "thus , for the following discussion , we will generalize the definition of state 1 to include any magnetic configuration in which the star does not connect outside @xmath19 .",
    "state 1 is characterized by a large amount of open stellar field , so it is natural to consider the effects of a stellar wind in the magnetically open region . as discussed in section [ sub_problems ] , a wind can even be responsible for opening the field ( which does not depend on our parameters @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) . thus , if a wind ( or any other process ) keeps the stellar field open beyond some radius @xmath88 , and if @xmath239 , the system will be in state 1 .",
    "for example , @xcite concluded that stellar winds from ctts s could result in @xmath249 .",
    "if true , this means that any system rotating more slowly than 19% of break - up speed will have @xmath239 ( eq .  [ eqn_f ] ) and be in state 1 .    there is empirical evidence for systems in state 1 from some numerical simulations of the star - disc interaction , which usually represent systems with @xmath160 . in the simulations of @xcite and @xcite , as an example , after the initial state , the stellar field never connects to the disc outside @xmath19 , even immediately following reconnection events .",
    "these authors report that the only significant spin - down torques on the star come from the open field regions ( though a stellar wind was not properly included ) , rather than along field lines connecting the stars to their discs ( but also see * ? ? ?",
    "it seems that state 1 is a likely configuration for accreting stars , particularly among slow rotators .",
    "since , in this state , the net torque from the interaction with the accretion disc only acts to spin up the star , stars with long - lived accretion phases must somehow rid themselves of this excess angular momentum .",
    "stellar winds can exert spin - down torques on the star , and if these torques are significant ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the equilibrium spin rate may be simply determined by a balance between this torque and @xmath165 .",
    "in this situation , state 1 could actually represent the expected configuration for accreting systems in spin equilibrium .",
    "in this state , the stellar field connects to a finite region of the disc between @xmath18 and @xmath21 , as illustrated in the middle panel of figure [ fig_states ] .",
    "this represents the typical configuration in many star - disc interaction models , except that the determination of @xmath21 varies between models .",
    "the location of @xmath18 is determined by equation [ eqn_rt ] ( and see fig .  [ fig_rtrstar ] ) , and accretion onto the star occurs from there .",
    "the star is spun up by the accretion torque ( eq .  [ eqn_tacc ] ) and magnetic torques ( eq .  [ eqn_tmag ] ) from field lines connected to the region of the disc between @xmath18 and @xmath19 and spun down by magnetic torques from field lines connected between @xmath19 and @xmath21 .",
    "therefore , a system can exist in an equilibrium , disc - locked state , in state 2 , in which the net torque on the star is zero , and the spin rate of the star then correlates with accretion parameters ( see  [ sec_equilib ] ) .",
    "when one considers that the differential rotation determines @xmath21 ( via eq .",
    "[ eqn_rout ] ) , both @xmath194 and @xmath181 are larger for smaller @xmath5 .",
    "also , as shown in figure [ fig_rteq_rcor ] , the range of ( non - equilibrium ) values of @xmath18 that exist in state 2 becomes narrower as @xmath5 decreases .",
    "for the strong coupling case of @xmath242 , a system can only be in state 2 if @xmath250 .",
    "so for strong coupling , it is unlikely that a given system will exist in state 2 , unless it is very near its disc - locked state , which then requires a fast stellar spin .",
    "another intriguing effect of a largely open field topology is that , in order for a system to be disc - locked , the differential magnetic torque in the disc @xmath104 must be stronger ( compared to the completely closed assumption ) in order to make up for the decreased size of the connected region ( compare figs .",
    "[ fig_dtorques ] and [ fig_dtorques2 ] ) . when the connected region is very small ( i.e. , for small @xmath5 )",
    ", @xmath104 is very large , which ought to have a significant effect on the disc structure there",

    "also , since the disc does not extend inside @xmath19 , the star feels no spin - up torques , only spin - down torques , and so it can not exist in spin equilibrium @xcite .",
    "a possible magnetic field configuration of this state is illustrated in the bottom panel of figure [ fig_states ] .",
    "it is not yet clear under which conditions a system will be in this state , though the relative values of differential torques ( or stresses ) in the disc are certainly important .",
    "some authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the general question of what conditions govern a system in state 3 , to our knowledge , remains an unanswered astrophysical problem .",

    "in addition to magnetic torques , outflows and/or radiation from the star may be important @xcite . understanding this state is probably relevant to understanding the transition from classical to weak - line t tauri phases , and",
    "it may even have further implications for gas giant planet formation / migration @xcite and for the ultimate dissipation of the gas disc .",
    "we have considered that the opening of magnetic field lines expected from differential rotation in the star - disc interaction results in a largely open field topology .",
    "this significantly alters the torque that a star receives from its accretion disc , compared to previous models that assume a closed field .",
    "our main conclusions from this work are the following :    1 .",
    "this more open field topology resuts in a weaker spin - down torque felt by the star from the disc (  [ sec_open ] ) .",
    "the strongest possible torque occurs for intermediate magnetic coupling to the disc . stronger coupling , as expected near the inner edge of the disc , results in a spin - down torque that is more than an order of magnitude below the torque found for the closed field assumption .",
    "2 .   in the disc - locked , spin equilibrium state , this results in a stellar spin rate that is much faster than predicted by previous models (  [ sub_spineq ] ) .",
    "3 .   we have identified and discussed three possible magnetic field configurations in magnetic star - disc systems (  [ sub_3states ] ) .",
    "the three configurations could represent , for example , an evolutionary sequence for a system with a gradually decreasing mass accretion rate ( or , e.g. , a gradually increasing stellar spin rate ) .",

    ", the star feels no spin - down torques from the disc .",

    "state 2 is the typical configuration assumed in star - disc interaction models . for strong magnetic coupling in the disc , or",
    "if stellar or disc winds are important , we find that a system can only be in state 2 under special circumstances .",
    "in particular , the accretion rate must be lower than for state 1 .",
    "state 3 likely represents the non - accreting , weak - line t tauri phase .",

    "<S> we formulate a general , steady - state model for the torque on a magnetized star from a surrounding accretion disc . for the first time </S>",
    "<S> , we include the opening of dipolar magnetic field lines due to the differential rotation between the star and disc , so the magnetic topology then depends on the strength of the magnetic coupling to the disc . </S>",
    "<S> this coupling is determined by the effective slip rate of magnetic field lines that penetrate the diffusive disc . </S>",
    "<S> stronger coupling ( i.e. , lower slip rate ) leads to a more open topology and thus to a weaker magnetic torque on the star from the disc . in the expected strong coupling regime </S>",
    "<S> , we find that the spin - down torque on the star is more than an order of magnitude smaller than calculated by previous models . </S>",
    "<S> we also use our general approach to examine the equilibrium ( ` disc - locked ' ) state , in which the net torque on the star is zero . in this state , we show that the stellar spin rate is roughly an order of magnitude faster than predicted by previous models . </S>",
    "<S> this challenges the idea that slowly - rotating , accreting protostars are disc locked . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , when the field is sufficiently open ( e.g. , for mass accretion rates @xmath0 yr@xmath1 , for typical accreting protostars ) , the star will receive no magnetic spin - down torque from the disc at all . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore conclude that protostars must experience a spin - down torque from a source that has not yet been considered in the star - disc torque models  possibly from a stellar wind along the open field lines .    </S>",
