    "thus consistency between the radiation observed in minkowski space and the zero energy radiation in rindler space is established by the existence of a non - trivial zero energy sector which in turn requires a symmetry which guarantees the degeneracy . seen from this point of view it may not come as a surprise that the symmetry under appropriately generalized scale transformations persists @xcite for massive particles and guarantees consistency between rindler and minkowski space formulations also in this case . while negligible for small separations of the two sources , the imaginary contribution dominates the force at large distances for scalar particle and photon exchange .",
    "as the real part , also the imaginary part of the gravitational interaction is divergent .",
    "the counterpart of this divergence of the static graviton propagator in rindler space is the divergence of the energy momentum tensor of the `` eternally '' , uniformly accelerated mass point in minkowski space .",
    "this divergence indicates that the implicit assumption of a negligible backreaction on the gravitational field is invalid .",
    "the weakening of the interaction for scalar particle and photon exchange as well as the appearance of a non - trivial imaginary contribution point to instability of matter in rindler space .",
    "we have confirmed this instability in a calculation of the rate of ionization of hydrogen atoms at rest as a function of the distance from the horizon or equivalently of the tolman temperature .",
    "similar arguments point to the instability of nuclear matter which will set in at significantly smaller distances to the horizon . in this hierarchy of instability one may also expect , at still smaller distances , instability of the phases of matter determined by the dynamics of quantum fields . within the context of a self - interacting scalar field we have shown that the strength of the fluctuations increases when approaching the horizon and we have determined the distance where the fluctuations and the mean field generated by symmetry breaking contribute equally to the energy density . at still",
    "smaller distances , most likely the expectation value of the scalar field becomes irrelevant for the dynamics .",
    "using parameters of the standard model , the corresponding tolman temperature has been found to be of the same order of magnitude as the temperature of the electroweak phase transition .",
    "of interest in this context is the issue of a possible confinement - deconfinement transition when approaching the horizon . as in minkowski space ,",
    "this issue most likely has to be settled in numerical simulations .",
    "the strong force will have to be determined in calculations of the polyakov loop correlation functions on a lattice in rindler space with imaginary time .",
    "as in the electrostatic case the interaction energy determined in this way will be a real quantity .",
    "whether confinement in rindler space implies a vanishing imaginary contribution to the force or the imaginary part can be reconstructed , on the basis of the numerically determined spectrum and correlation functions , has to be clarified .",
