    "the study of the gromov - hausdorff convergence of riemannian manifolds has been a significant branch in differential geometry . in the study of convergence or collapsing of riemannian manifolds ,",
    "one usually considers a curvature bound of riemannian manifolds .",
    "our main concern is the study of the collapsing phenomena of riemannian manifolds under a uniform lower bound on the sectional curvature @xmath1 .",
    "when the absolute value @xmath2 is uniformly bounded , cheeger , fukaya and gromov @xcite developed a general theory of collapsing , where the collapsing phenomena were described in terms of the generalized group actions by nilpotent groups , called @xmath3-structures .",
    "it should be noted that these actions are not permitted to have fixed points .",
    "now if we turn attention to the case when @xmath1 has only a uniform lower bound , we recognize several kinds of different collapsing phenomena in this new situation :    * _ any _ effective action on a compact manifold by a compact connected lie group of positive dimension causes a collapsing under a lower curvature bound ( @xcite ) ; * there is a phenomenon of curvature - concentration , for instance in the convergence of surfaces to a singular surface with conical singularities , under a lower curvature bound .",
    "thus the study of collapsing of riemannian manifolds under a lower curvature bound will enable us to understand a wider class of collapsing phenomena than the case of absolute bound on @xmath1 .    in spite of several studies of collapsing or convergence under a lower sectional curvature bound ,",
    "the general collapsing structure is still unclear . recently in @xcite , we have classified all the collapsing phenomena of @xmath4-manifolds under a lower curvature bound . in the present paper , we discuss and determine the collapsing of @xmath0-manifolds under a lower curvature bound . note that @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and arbitrary connected sum of them all admit nontrivial @xmath8-actions , and therefore can collapse under @xmath9 while no simply connected closed @xmath0-manifold can collapse under @xmath10 because of nonzero euler characteristics ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "for a given @xmath11 , let @xmath12 denote the family of closed orientable riemannian @xmath0-manifolds @xmath13 with a lower sectional curvature bound @xmath9 and an upper diameter bound @xmath14 . since @xmath12 is precompact(@xcite ) , it is quite natural to consider an infinite sequence @xmath15 in @xmath12 converging to a compact metric space @xmath16 with respect to the gromov - hausdorff distance .",
    "now it is well - known that @xmath16 has the structure of alexandrov space with curvature @xmath17 and of dimension @xmath18 .",
    "it is a quite important problem to reproduce the topology of @xmath15 for sufficiently large @xmath19 by using the information on the singularities of @xmath16 .",
    "this enables us to understand the elements of a small neighborhood of @xmath16 in @xmath12 and therefore to describe the structure of @xmath12 itself because of the precompactness .    in the case of @xmath20 or @xmath21 , we know some answers for this problem ( @xcite , @xcite ) . in this paper",
    ", we discuss the cases of @xmath22 .",
    "our results can be simply stated as follows :    [ thm : general ] suppose @xmath22 .",
    "then @xmath15 has a singular fibre structure over @xmath16 in a generalized sense .",
    "here the fibre type is constant along each strata of a stratification of @xmath16 , but may change when the strata changes . in particular , @xmath15 is a fibre bundle over @xmath16 if @xmath16 has no _ essential singular points_.    to state our results more precisely and more explicitly , let us describe the collapsing structure in each case of the dimension of @xmath16 .",
    "we begin with the case of @xmath23 .",
    "[ thm : dim3 ] suppose that @xmath15 collapses to a three - dimensional compact alexandrov space @xmath24 under @xmath9 .",
    "then there exists a locally smooth , local @xmath8-action @xmath25 on @xmath15 such that the orbit space @xmath26 is homeomorphic to @xmath24 .",
    "[ rem : dim3infom ] in theorem [ thm : dim3 ] , one can obtain the information on the slice representations of the isotropy groups at the fixed points or the exceptional orbits of @xmath25 from the information on the singularities of the corresponding singular points of @xmath16 as described below .",
    "see theorems [ thm : patch ] and [ thm : patchwbdy ] for details :    1 .",
    "we have a bijection @xmath27 of the fixed point set @xmath28 to the union of @xmath29 and a subset of @xmath30 , where @xmath30 , the set of _ extremal points _ of @xmath31 , denotes the set of points @xmath32 of @xmath31 whose spaces of directions , @xmath33 , have diameters @xmath34 .",
    "the singular locus @xmath35 of @xmath25 is a quasigeodesic consisting of essential singular points of @xmath24 .",
    "[ rem : dim3mfd ] in a course of the proof of theorem [ thm : dim3 ] , we prove that the limit space @xmath24 is a topological manifold ( proposition [ prop : topmfd ] ) .    in @xcite ,",

    ", we obtain    [ cor : sum ] under the hypothesis of theorem [ thm : dim3 ] , suppose that @xmath15 is simply connected .",
    "then @xmath15 is homeomorphic to the connected sum @xmath36 where @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 have a definite upper bound in terms of the number of the extremal points of @xmath31 and the number , say @xmath40 , of the connected components of @xmath41 @xmath42    actually @xmath15 is diffeomorphic to the connected sum ( see remark [ rem : conn - sum ] ) .",
    "now we turn to the case of @xmath43 .",
    "first we consider the case when @xmath44 has no boundary . by definition ,",
    "a closed @xmath0-manifold is a seifert @xmath45-bundle over @xmath44 if there exists a surjective continuous map @xmath46 such that any point @xmath47 has a neighborhood @xmath48 admitting the following commutative diagram @xmath49 @xmath50 where @xmath51 denotes a free diagonal @xmath52-quotient ; the @xmath52-action is free on the @xmath45-factor and by rotation on the @xmath53-factor , @xmath32 corresponds to the @xmath52-fixed point of @xmath53 in the above diagram , and @xmath54 is a positive integer called the multiplicity of the torus fibre @xmath55 .",

    "next we consider the case when the compact alexandrov surface @xmath44 has nonempty boundary . in this case",
    ", we have a decomposition of @xmath15 into two parts : one is a part of @xmath15 near a compact domain of @xmath60 approximating @xmath60 which is either an @xmath56-bundle or a seifert @xmath45-bundle ( theorem [ thm : dim2nobdy ] ) .",
    "the other is a part of @xmath15 near @xmath61 , on which we can define a singular fibre structure as indicated in the theorem below .",
    "[ thm : dim2wbdy ] suppose that @xmath15 collapses to a two - dimensional compact alexandrov space @xmath44 with boundary under @xmath9 .",
    "then @xmath15 is homeomorphic to a singular fibre space @xmath62 over @xmath44 .    as a particular consequence of theorem [ thm : dim2wbdy ]",
    ", there is a continuous surjective map @xmath63 such that @xmath64 restricted to @xmath60 is either an @xmath56-bundle or a seifert @xmath45-bundle and @xmath64 restricted to @xmath61 is a singular fibration whose fibres are ones of a point , @xmath8 , @xmath56 , the real projective plane @xmath65 and the klein bottle @xmath66 .",
    "the fiber types of @xmath67 may change at extremal points @xmath68 .",
    "( see theorem [ thm : dim2wbdy - break ] for details ) .",
    "finally we assume @xmath69 .",

    "more precisely ,    [ thm : circle ] suppose that @xmath15 collapses to a circle under @xmath9 .",
    "then @xmath15 fibers over @xmath8 with fibre finitely covered by @xmath70 , @xmath71 , a nilmanifold or a homotopy @xmath4-sphere .",
    "thus the essential case here is the case when @xmath16 is isometric to a closed interval :    [ thm : dim1 ] suppose that @xmath15 collapses to a one - dimensional closed interval under @xmath9",
    ". then @xmath15 is homeomorphic to a gluing @xmath72 along their boundaries , where each of @xmath73 and @xmath74 is either a disk bundle over @xmath75-dimensional closed manifold @xmath76 with @xmath77 , or a gluing of two disk - bundles over @xmath78-dimensional closed manifolds @xmath79 , @xmath80 , with @xmath81 , where @xmath76 and @xmath79 have nonnegative euler numbers , and if @xmath82 , @xmath83 is one of the closed 3-manifolds appearing as the fibre types in theorem [ thm : circle ] .",

    "it is crucial to understand the topology of a small ( but of a fixed radius ) metric ball in a collapsed @xmath0-manifold which is very close to a singular point of the limit space . as the important first step , we establish the rescaling technique in dimension @xmath0 which makes it possible to pursue the topology of the metric ball . under the rescaling of metrics",
    ", we obtain a new limit space , a complete noncompact alexandrov space with nonnegative curvature and with dimension larger than that of the original limit space .",
    "this reduces the problem to the study of collapsing or convergence to a higher dimensional spaces ( with nonnegative curvature ) .",
    "the second step is to analyze the new limit space in several aspects . among them , we especially need to establish the generalized soul theorem ( theorem [ thm : soul ] ) for @xmath0-dimensional complete open alexandrov spaces with nonnegative curvature . in the third step ,",
    "we actually determine the structure of collapsing to the new limit space , and obtain the topology of the small metric ball using an inductive procedure . using this topological information",

    "a similar strategy was used in @xcite .",

    "it follows that @xmath4016 is a topological submersion and hence is a locally trivial bundle map by @xcite .",
    "the proof for @xmath4050 is similar and hence omitted .",
    "since @xmath4073 is a locally trivial fibre bundle , the conclusion ( 1 ) follows from the generalized margulis lemma of @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath222 is also an almost lipschitz submersion .",
    "therefore by the parametrized versions of theorem 0.5 in @xcite and theorem [ thm : dim1 ] in the present paper , we can get the conclusions ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) respectively .",
    "note that in the present case , we can prove the rescaling theorem corresponding to theorem [ thm : rescal ] by using the ( generalized ) argument of lemma [ lem : split - rescal ] .",
    "the actual proofs of ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) are done by contradiction , and the details are omitted .",
