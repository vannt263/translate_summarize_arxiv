    "much work has been devoted to the computation of analytical solutions of the schrdinger equation for the early years of quantum mechanics , especially when the hamiltonian of the problem admits bound states .",
    "indeed , it is often useful in physics to have a guess about the behavior of the eigenenergies of a system in terms of the various parameters of the hamiltonian",
    ". this can be particularly relevant when one tries to fit the parameters of a model to some experimental data .",
    "there are many methods allowing to find approximate analytical solutions of the schrdinger equation for bound state problems : wkb method , variational method , etc .",
    "( see @xcite for example ) . in previous works @xcite ,",
    "we have proposed and extensively studied a new method to compute the eigenenergies and wave functions of a given hamiltonian admitting bound states .",
    "this method is based on auxiliary fields ( also known as einbein fields @xcite ) and can lead to analytical approximate results .",
    "its general principle will be recalled in section  [ grmeth ] . up to now",
    ", the auxiliary field method ( afm ) has been mainly applied in the case of central potentials of the form @xmath1 .",
    "we have shown , in particular , that the qualitative features of the exact energy spectra are well reproduced and that the analytical formulae can be greatly improved by a comparison with a numerical resolution of the problem .",
    "then they become very accurate @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we intend to apply the afm to find approximate analytical formulae for central potentials of exponential form , that is @xmath2 .",
    "we thus start with the following hamiltonian @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are both positive and nonzero real parameters .",
    "it is interesting to define the new variables @xmath6 and to work with the dimensionless hamiltonian @xmath7 instead of @xmath8 .",
    "indeed , one has then @xmath9 with @xmath10 the rewriting of the problem under this particular form emphasizes the fact that the dimensionless parameter @xmath11 given by ( [ gdef ] ) contains all the relevant information of @xmath8 .",
    "only the eigenenergies @xmath12 of  ( [ hdef ] ) have thus to be computed ; the  physical \" eigenenergies will then be given by @xmath13 , a relation which expresses the scaling properties of the schrdinger equation .",
    "we first show in section  [ expp ] that the pure exponential potential ( @xmath14 ) can be analytically solved using the afm provided that the energy spectrum of the schrdinger equation with a linearly rising potential is analytically known .",
    "the pure exponential potential is common in hadronic physics for example , when a screened confining potential is considered @xcite .",
    "then , we show that some general results can be obtained for @xmath15 in section  [ genp ] , and write an explicit energy formula for the yukawa potential ( @xmath16 ) in section  [ yuka ] .",
    "the importance of this potential in theoretical physics is such that it also deserves a specific study .",
    "we then present improved energy formulae for the pure exponential and the yukawa potentials in section  [ impfore ] .",
    "an interesting feature of exponential potentials is that they all admit a _",
    "finite _ number of bound states that depends on the dimensionless parameter @xmath11 , ruling the potential depth , and defined by ( [ gdef ] ) .",
    "there exists thus  critical heights \" : potential depths beyond which new bound states appear .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for detailed explanations about how to compute critical heights in a given potential .",
    "accurate formulae giving these critical heights are given for the pure exponential and the yukawa potentials .",
    "finally , we sum up our results in section  [ conclu ] .",
    "the definition and the properties of the lambert function , that will frequently appear in our calculations , are given in [ lambprop ] .",
    "additional analytical approximations for the energy levels and some critical heights for the yukawa potential are given in [ envyuk ] and [ gyuk ] respectively .",
    "we recall here the main points of the method that we presented in @xcite .",
    "the problem is to find an analytical approximate solution of the eigenequation @xmath17 , @xmath8 being a hamiltonian of standard radial form @xmath18    the procedure is the following .",
    "let us assume that @xmath19 admits bound states with an analytical spectrum , @xmath20 being a real parameter .",
    "we thus know the solution of @xmath21 let us define the function @xmath22 and the operator @xmath23 from the relation @xmath24 the spectrum of the following hamiltonian @xmath25-\\nu\\ , p\\left[i(\\nu)\\right],\\ ] ] is then analytically known provided that @xmath20  the auxiliary field  is assumed to be a real parameter . using ( [ analy ] ) , we have indeed @xmath26-\\nu\\ , p\\left[i(\\nu)\\right].\\ ] ] the physical spectrum is finally given by the eigenstates @xmath27 and the eigenenergies @xmath28 , with @xmath29 minimizing the total energy  ( [ en1 ] ) , _ i.e. _ satisfying @xmath30    this method can be justified as follows .",
    "the arbitrary potential @xmath31 is replaced by @xmath32-\\nu\\ , p\\left[i(\\nu)\\right]$ ] , a function of the auxiliary field @xmath20 and of an analytically solvable potential @xmath33 .",
    "the key point is that the auxiliary field should rigorously be eliminated as an operator from hamiltonian  ( [ htdef ] ) . when doing this , one is led to @xmath34 , and to @xmath35 .",
    "this means that hamiltonians  ( [ inco ] ) and ( [ htdef ] ) are equivalent up to an elimination of the auxiliary field as an operator , the auxiliary field being then defined by ( [ rdef ] ) .",
    "the afm would consequently lead to the exact results if the real number @xmath20 were replaced by the operator @xmath23 . as we use the real number @xmath20 in order to have analytical solutions ,",
    "the results are approximate .",
    "one has then @xmath36 , with @xmath23 and @xmath29 given by ( [ rdef ] ) and ( [ enmin ] ) respectively @xcite .",
    "our method can consequently be regarded as a ",
    "mean field approximation \" with respect to a particular auxiliary field which is introduced to simplify the calculations .",
    "let us notice that the method we have presented is not variational , and that it is exact when @xmath37 , with trivially @xmath38 .",
    "the main technical problem is the determination of analytical solutions for ( [ rdef ] ) and ( [ enmin ] ) .",
    "such a task has already been fulfilled in a satisfactory way for many interesting and nontrivial potentials @xcite .",
    "as we will see in the latter , it can also be achieved for the yukawa and the pure exponential potentials .",
    "we have shown in @xcite that the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian @xmath39 can be written under the form @xmath40 where @xmath41 depends on the radial @xmath42 and orbital @xmath43 quantum numbers , as well as on @xmath44 _ a priori_. an interesting feature of the afm is that the functional form of ( [ eq : eigenerplpot ] ) does not depend on the chosen potential @xmath33 , provided that this potential is of power - law form ( typically one can choose @xmath45 or @xmath46 ) @xcite .",
    "@xmath41 depends only on the particular form of @xmath33 : one logically obtains @xmath47 or @xmath48 according to the choice @xmath49 or @xmath46 . since the form of @xmath41 is an artifact of the afm , it can be modified to better fit the exact results . in particular , we have shown that , for any physical values of @xmath44 ( @xmath50 ) , a good form for @xmath41 is given by @xmath51 simple expressions for the functions @xmath52 and @xmath53 have been proposed in @xcite in order to give an approximation as precise as @xmath54 for the most interesting ( the lowest ) values of the quantum numbers @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "for example , @xmath55 leads to very accurate energy formulae @xcite .",
    "finally , it is worth mentioning that the energy formula  ( [ eq : eigenerplpot ] ) together with ( [ eq : grandnl ] ) and ( [ bcdef ] ) gives the exact result in the following important cases :    * the harmonic oscillator , for which @xmath56 ; * the coulomb potential , for which @xmath57 .",
    "as we have analytical and accurate energy formulae for any power - law potential at our disposal , we will assume in this work that @xmath58 is a good starting point to apply the afm .",
    "setting @xmath59 , we have shown in @xcite that the energy spectrum of hamiltonian @xmath60 is given by @xmath61 the optimal value @xmath29 being determined from the equation @xmath62 coming from the relation latexmath:[\\[\\label{eq : jnufrompl }    only on the potential @xmath31 and not on a particular eigenstate , while @xmath29 depends both on the potential ( through the @xmath64 function ) and on the state under consideration ( through @xmath41 ) .",
    "equations  ( [ eq : enu0frompl])-([eq : jnufrompl ] ) are general results of the afm , that will be used intensively in this work .    we have shown in @xcite that replacing the power @xmath44 by @xmath65 does not change the functional form of @xmath66 but substitutes simply the number @xmath41 by @xmath67 .",
    "the afm can not say what is the optimal value for the power of @xmath33 .",
    "it is necessary to resort to a numerical analysis .",
    "moreover it was also shown in @xcite that the approximate eigenvalues are ruled by the correct scaling laws .",
    "the schrdinger equation with pure exponential potential corresponds to the hamiltonian  ( [ hdef ] ) in which @xmath14 , _ i.e. _ @xmath68 the negative eigenenergies @xmath12 of such a hamiltonian can be analytically computed for @xmath69 only .",
    "but even in this case , the expression of @xmath12 is not very tractable since it is formally defined by the relation @xcite @xmath70 where @xmath71 is a bessel function of the first kind .",
    "consequently , it is of interest to find an analytical energy formula for the energy levels of the pure exponential potential that is of simpler use than ( [ enexa ] ) for @xmath69 and , above all , that remains valid for arbitrary @xmath42 and @xmath43 quantum numbers .    equations  ( [ eq : enu0frompl])-([eq : jnufrompl ] ) can be particularised in the present case .",
    "obviously one has to set @xmath72 and @xmath73 , while a particularly convenient choice is @xmath74 .",
    "a quick calculation leads to @xmath75 and to the energy formula @xmath76 where @xmath29 satisfies the equation @xmath77 ^ 3=2n^2.\\ ] ] notice that , in principle , @xmath78 in this last equality . but , as mentioned above , another choice @xmath67 with an arbitrary value of @xmath65 is _ a priori _ possible .",
    "it is worth noting that , from ( [ rdef ] ) , we have @xmath79 and thus @xmath80 $ ] .    by defining @xmath81 we can recast ( [ eqpar1 ] ) into the form @xmath82 @xmath83 $ ] by definition , and the function @xmath84 is such that @xmath85 , with a maximum in @xmath86 .",
    "it means that ( [ eqelim ] ) has no solution if @xmath87 ; the solution of ( [ eqelim ] ) turns out to be @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the principal branch of the lambert function , whose main properties are given in [ lambprop ] .",
    "the choice of @xmath89 ensures that the total energy has the correct limit for small @xmath5 ( see below ) .",
    "equation  ( [ enexp ] ) now becomes @xmath90,\\ ] ] and the energy , rewritten in physical units , is finally given by @xmath91,\\quad { \\rm with}\\quad z=\\frac{1}{3}\\left(\\frac{n^2 \\beta^2}{m \\alpha}\\right)^{1/3}.\\ ] ] the limit @xmath92 is interesting .",
    "indeed , @xmath93 in this case : the potential is nearly a linear confining one . recalling that @xmath94 for the pure exponential potential",
    ", it can be checked that , at small @xmath5 , @xmath95^{2/3}+o(\\beta^{4/3}).\\ ] ] this last formula is exactly the one which is expected in the case of a linear potential [ see ( [ eq : eigenerplpot ] ) for @xmath96 and @xmath97 .    for computational reasons , the lambert function may be uneasy to deal with .",
    "we mention that we can use the approximate expression @xmath98\\approx\\frac{\\rme^{-3z}}{100}\\left[100 - 150\\ , z - 580\\ , z^2 + 524\\ , z^3\\right]\\ ] ] which leads to an absolute error below 0.008 for @xmath99 .",
    "we finally point out that the energy spectrum of potentials like @xmath100 are trivially obtained by adding a constant term to formula ( [ enfinal ] ) .",
    "such potentials are of interest in hadronic physics when one considers a screened confining potential to take into account possible string - breaking effects @xcite .",
    "let us consider first the afm framework . by definition ,",
    "the critical heights @xmath101 of the exponential are such that @xmath102 , with @xmath103 given by ( [ epsnu0 ] ) . according to this last equation",
    ", one finds that the energy vanishes for @xmath104 , a value which is lower than @xmath105 as required by ( [ eqelim ] ) .",
    "equivalently , one can say that the critical heights are given by @xmath106 they are such that , if @xmath107 , the potential admits a bound state with the given quantum numbers @xmath108 , @xmath109 .",
    "it is remarkable that our approximation scheme , based on the linear potential @xmath110 for which an infinite number of bound states is present , is able to predict that only a finite number of bound states will be present in the pure exponential potential .",
    "this is another test of the ability of the afm to analytically reproduce the qualitative features of a given eigenvalue problem .",
    "let us note that the afm does not give any information about the optimal power - law potential to determine the form of the number @xmath111 .",
    "equation  ( [ enexa ] ) can also lead to a determination of the exact ( as coming from the schrdinger equation ) critical heights @xmath112 ; let us denote them as @xmath113 .",
    "indeed these critical heights are such that they correspond to a energy level @xmath114 .",
    "we are thus led to the equation @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the @xmath117 zero of the bessel function @xmath118 . at large @xmath42 ,",
    "these are given by @xmath119 @xcite , leading to the asymptotic expression @xmath120 this result is qualitatively similar to ( [ gc1 ] ) , stating that @xmath121 .",
    "we can try to use formula  ( [ gcbess ] ) to improve the result  ( [ gc1 ] ) . assuming that @xmath122 with no constraint on parameters @xmath123 and @xmath124 ( contrary to what is expected from ( [ eq : grandnl ] ) ) , it is easy to see that formulae  ( [ gc1 ] ) and ( [ gcbess ] ) coincide for @xmath112 with @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "we can then try a new relation to compute the critical heights @xmath127 this formula is in good agreement with exact results : for @xmath128 $ ] and @xmath129 $ ] , the minimal , maximal and mean relative errors are respectively 0.03% , 8.7% and 3.5% .",
    "it is not possible to obtain so good agreement by choosing @xmath123 and @xmath124 values coming from ( [ bcdef ] ) .",
    "some exact @xmath130 values are given in table  [ tab2 ] ; they are computed numerically by solving the schrdinger equation with a vanishing energy .    @ccccc @xmath42 & @xmath69 & 1 & 2 & 3 + 0 & 1.446 & 7.049 & 16.313 & 29.258 + 1 & 7.618 & 16.921 & 29.880 & 46.518 + 2 & 18.722 & 31.526 & 48.077 & 68.346",

    "unfortunately , the analytical asymptotic expression of @xmath132 is not known , and an improvement of formula  ( [ gc1b ] ) must rely on numerical arguments , in particular using the numerical values of @xmath130 , as given in table  [ tab2 ] .",
    "moreover , a good overall fit formula needs to reproduce correctly not only the behaviour in terms of @xmath42 or @xmath43 separately , but must try to get the good behaviour in terms of @xmath42 and @xmath43 simultaneously . since we want to stick as much as possible to the philosophy of afm , we maintain the quadratic form @xmath133 and just add in the expression of @xmath134 a term proportional to @xmath135 .",
    "thus , we propose a new expression for the critical heights which reads @xmath136 the improvement as compared to ( [ gc1b ] ) is very appreciable since , in this case , the minimal , maximal and mean relative errors are respectively 0.005% , 4.5% and 1.1% .    using ( [ gc1 ] ) , one can write @xmath137 this makes clear the dependence on the critical heights @xmath138 for formula  ( [ epsnu0 ] ) .",
    "it is then easy to see that @xmath139 when @xmath140 .",
    "in order to compute analytically the spectrum of hamiltonian  ( [ hdef ] ) for arbitrary values of @xmath65 , it is of interest to use the general result  ( [ eq : eigenerplpot ] ) , and consequently to choose @xmath141 .",

    "in the first case , the function @xmath143 is monotonically decreasing while in the two last cases , it presents a maximum .",
    "the inversion of ( [ eqs ] ) can be achieved thanks to the lambert function since @xmath143 is of the form  ( [ resol ] ) .",
    "one finds @xmath156 where one must be careful in the choice of either @xmath89 or @xmath157 , that will depend on the particular value of @xmath65 .",
    "nevertheless , as both branches of the lambert function share the same properties , it is possible to go a step further in our computations by using the generic solution  ( [ ilsol ] ) .",
    "let us first define @xmath158 where @xmath159 _ a priori_. but let us recall that another choice is possible as mentioned previously .",
    "then , a rewriting of ( [ eq : enu0frompl])-([eq : jnufrompl ] ) with @xmath160 , @xmath73 , and @xmath161 leads to @xmath162,\\ ] ] where @xmath163 is a solution of @xmath164^{\\lambda+2}=y_\\lambda.\\ ] ]    when the function @xmath165^{\\lambda+2}$ ] has a maximum , it is located at @xmath166 notice that @xmath167 would also be a possible value for @xmath168 , but the choice  ( [ xsdef ] ) ensures that @xmath169 is located in the domain of @xmath163 .",
    "one finds the constraint @xmath170    as for the exponential potential , ( [ elneg ] ) vanishes for particular values of @xmath171 , and thus critical heights appear .",
    "it can be checked that @xmath172 is equal to zero when @xmath173 , which is lower than @xmath174 as demanded by ( [ gmdef ] ) .",

    "the case @xmath16 will be studied in the next section .    as a general result , ( [ gcneg ] )",
    "states that @xmath177 for any exponential potential .",
    "interestingly , it has previously been observed that the critical heights of an arbitrary exponential potential can be very accurately fitted by a biquadratic form in @xmath42 and @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "our results can be seen as a demonstration of this empirical observation . however , the accuracy of the fitted form in @xcite is a supplementary argument showing that the explicit form of @xmath111 can not be computed within the afm : only @xmath178 can be assumed , the coefficients @xmath123 and @xmath124 having to be determined by another procedure in order to improve the analytical formulae that we have obtained .",
    "equations  ( [ elneg ] ) and ( [ x0choice ] ) formally define the analytical energy formula we are looking for . finding a general solution of ( [ x0choice ] ) is a complicated problem that can not be solved analytically .",
    "moreover , the yukawa potential is , to our knowledge , the only potential of common use with @xmath15 . before making a full treatment of the case @xmath16 in the next section , we can nevertheless make some comment about the limit where @xmath5 goes to zero ( @xmath179 and @xmath180 )",
    "in this limit , @xmath181 , and we should recover ( [ eq : eigenerplpot ] ) for @xmath182 and @xmath183 . the nontrivial solution of ( [ x0choice ] ) for @xmath184 and @xmath182 is @xmath185 .",
    "it can then be checked that @xmath186 this is the expected result for the energy spectrum of the potential @xmath187 .",
