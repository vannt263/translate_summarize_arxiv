    "the accretion disk models have been developed much in the past several decades .",
    "many disk models have been proposed and some of them are widely adopted in astrophysical studies nowadays , including but not restricted to shakura - sunyaev disk ( ssd ; see shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) , advection dominated accretion flow ( adaf ; see narayan & yi 1994 ; abramowicz et al .",
    "1995 ) , and slim disk ( abramowicz et al . 1988 ) .",
    "however , the outflow structure of accretion disks still remains an open problem .",
    "the equations that describe the hydrodynamic processes are the navier - stokes equations , which are quite difficult to solve in the case of accretion disks which involve viscosity and radiation . therefore , in most works , some kind of simplification , such as one - zone or polytropic distribution and hydrostatic equilibrium , are usually applied in the vertical direction , and the vertical variation ( @xmath4 dependence in cylindrical coordinates ) of the velocity field is usually neglected . in this way the equations are changed to a set of ordinary differential equations ( odes ) in the radial direction , which can be solved numerically . however , by taking these assumptions , one can not get a clear picture of the vertical structure of accretion flows ; the velocity is always radially inward and no mass will cross the disk surface , displaying no outflow structure . among the exceptions is a work done by narayan & yi in 1995(hereafter ny95 ) , which used self - similar assumptions in the radial direction and solved the structure along the @xmath1 direction in spherical coordinates ( @xmath0 ) . however , in their work they assumed @xmath5 and thus can not get a proper velocity field , and their solutions compose of only pure inflow .",
    "they argued that the bernoulli parameter is positive in their solutions so that a bipolar outflow is expected to develop near the vertical axis .",
    "blandford & begelman ( 1999 , hereafter bb99 ) relaxed the mass conservation assumption and assumed that the mass inflow rate varies with radius , and obtained solutions with outflow called adiabatic inflow - outflow solutions ( adios ) .",
    "their solutions are one - dimensional self - similar solutions that are height - averaged and they also applied the bernoulli parameter to argue the presence of outflow .",
    "however , abramowicz et al.(2000 ) pointed out that the positive bernoulli function ( instead of bernoulli parameter , which is defined in convenience of self - similar assumptions ) is not sufficient for outflow ( also see the simulation works done by stone et al .",
    "1999 and yuan & bu 2010 ) .",
    "blandford & begelman ( 2004 ) furthered their work and presented some self - similar two - dimensional solutions of radiatively inefficient accretion flows with outflow .",
    "they assumed hydrostatic equilibrium in the vertical direction and that convection dominates the heat transport , which may only be applicable in certain cases .",
    "xu & chen ( 1997 , hereafter xc97 ) relaxed @xmath5 and obtained two types of solutions with outflow : accretion and ejection solutions .",
    "however their solutions require the net accretion rate to be 0 , which is not realistic .",
    "xue & wang(2005 , hereafter xw05 ) followed ny95 and solved the disk structure along the @xmath1 direction considering @xmath6 .",
    "they arbitrarily set a disk surface , at which @xmath7 , and the sound speed on the surface for their calculation .",
    "their solutions display a field of inflow near the equatorial plane with wind blowing out of the upper boundary , however the boundary is set as an input parameter rather than being calculated , and they only investigated several cases of adafs . in ",
    "3.2 we will see that according to our calculation , their assumption does nt hold for accretion flows with large @xmath2 value .",
    "sadowski et al.(2010 ) abandoned the self - similar assumptions and solved the accretion disk structure in the radial and vertical direction simultaneously .",
    "because the navier - stokes equations for accretion disks can not be decoupled intrinsically , they adopted other assumptions , e.g. the disk is not geometrically thick , to derive the equations . as in their work they did nt consider @xmath8 while @xmath9 and @xmath10 were supposed not to vary vertically , they were not able to study outflows . in summary , in the analytical model study , the vertical or @xmath1-direction structure of accretion disks and outflows can still not be dealt with satisfactorily , and many improvements are still needed to be made .    on the other hand , observationally there are more and more evidences for outflows in accretion systems , such as sgr a*(marrone et al .",
    "2006 ; xie & yuan 2008 ) , soft x - ray transients(loeb et al . 2001 ) and quasars with blueshifted absorption lines(e.g . ,",
    "pg1115 + 80 ; chartas et al . 2003 ) .",
    "many numerical simulation works have also discovered outflows in their results ( e.g. stone et al . , 1999 ;",
    "igumenshchev & abramowicz , 2000 ; okuda et al . 2005",
    "; ohsuga et al.2005 ; ohsuga & mineshige 2007 ; ohsuga et al .",
    "the common existence of outflows in these works inspire us to investigate the vertical structure of accretion flows explicitly , to find solutions which can deal with @xmath6 and positive @xmath9 to get a clear velocity field , and with more reasonable boundary conditions . as a first step",
    ", we followed the work done by ny95 and xw05 , using self - similar assumptions in the radial direction and solving the odes along the @xmath1 direction in spherical coordinates ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "we used the @xmath2 viscosity prescription and assumed that the @xmath11 component of the viscosity stress tensor is dominant . by neglecting other components of the viscosity stress tensor , the necessary number of boundary conditions is reduced and we will only need the boundary conditions in the equatorial plane , which is obatined by symmetry and is thus quite physical . as we did nt set other arbitrary restrictions to @xmath9 and @xmath6 other than the self - similar assumptions , we can get a velocity field containing positive @xmath9 , to discuss the flow structure with possible outflows .",
    "these assumptions are applicable to different kinds of accretion disk models , ranging through ssd , adaf and slim disk , so we also did many calculations with different sets of parameters ( which is very difficult to do in a numerical simulation work as it would be too time - consuming ) , trying to find the flow structure dependence on the parameters , in order to understand the inflow / outflow mechanism more physically",
    ". these results can also be helpful to future numerical simulation works when they set the input parameters .",
    "it should be noted that there is another branch of researches which investigate accretion flows with an outflow ( usually wind ) plus accretion disk model . in these researches ,",
    "the configuration of the outflow and accretion disk is usually preset , and the calculations are focused on either the outflow or the accretion disk while the influence of the other part is simplified or parameterized ( e.g. fukue , 1989 ; takahara et al . , 1989 ; kusunose , 1991 ; bb99 ; misra & taam , 2001 ; fukue , 2004 ; xie & yuan , 2008 ) .",
    "recently there are also several works done in this way which deal with the outflow and the accretion disk simultaneously ( kawabata & mineshige , 2009 ; dotan & shaviv , 2010 ) . compared with our work , in these studies",
    "the accretion disk is usually height - integrated and the configuration of the accretion flow is assumed rather than being calculated , while in our work we solve the full hydrodynamic equations to get the configuration of the accretion flow .",
    "our work focuses on studying the general structure of disks , outflows and the physical mechanism behind them , and the results can be complementary to one another .",
    "in  2 we present the basic equations and assumptions we used in our calculations . in ",
    "3.1 we discuss our numerical methods and present solutions corresponding to typical parameters of ssd , adaf and slim disk . in  3.2 we show the disk structure dependence on different parameters and discuss their physical meanings .",
    "4 we present our summary and discussion .",
    "we consider the hydrodynamic equations of an accretion flow in the spherical coordinates ( @xmath0 ) . the flow is assumed to be steady(@xmath12 ) and axisymmetric(@xmath13 ) .",
    "thus the continuity equation can be written as @xmath14 we assume that for the accretion flow , only the @xmath11-component of the viscous tensor , @xmath15 , is dominant . and",
    "we use the newtonian gravitational potential , @xmath16 .",
    "then the equations of motion can be written as(kato et al .",
    "2008 , also see appendix a of xw05 ) @xmath17    @xmath18    @xmath19    in our calculation , we adopt the @xmath2 prescription of viscosity @xmath20 and @xmath21 is the total pressure .",
    "the shearing box radiation magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) simulations done by hirose et al .",
    "( 2009 ) found that the vertically integrated stress is approximately proportional to the vertically averaged total thermal ( gas plus radiation ) pressure . in our work , however , we also apply this relation locally .",
    "following ny95 , we use the advective factor , @xmath22 , i.e. a fraction @xmath3 of the dissipated energy is advected as stored entropy and a fraction @xmath23 is lost due to radiation . in our calculation",
    "we assume that @xmath3 is constant in the accretion flow , so the energy equation can be written as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the internal energy of the material and can be expressed as(kato et al .",
    "2008 ) @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the heat capacity ratio and is considered to be a constant input parameter in our calculation .",
    "we adopt the self - similar assumptions in the radial direction , therefore we seek a solution of the form @xmath28 this set of self - similar solutions is similar to that of ny95 and is actually identical to that of xw05 . compared with those works , here we use the total pressure @xmath21 in equation ( 11 ) instead of the sound speed @xmath29 , which is proportional to @xmath30 . as stated in ny95 , the only length scale in the problem is @xmath31 and the only frequency is @xmath32 , thus all velocities must scale with radius as @xmath33 . in ny95 , narayan and",
    "yi set @xmath34 , which implies @xmath5 according to the continuity equation , thus they intrinsically set no outflow for the accretion disk .",
    "here we relax this parameter @xmath35 following bb99 and xw05 , to allow outflows from the disk .",
    "if we substitute equations ( 7)-(11 ) into equations ( 1)-(4 ) , the @xmath31 components can be eliminated , leaving only the dimensionless fuctions @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , the variable @xmath1 and some constants which are set as input parameters .",
    "the energy equation ( equation ( 5 ) ) is somewhat more complex . as the internal energy depends differently on gas pressure and radiation pressure ,",
    "we discuss the energy equation more carefully here .",
    "first , one may notice that only the total pressure @xmath21 appears in equations ( 1)-(4 ) .",
    "this is not hard to understand as the dynamical processes do nt recognize whether the pressure is from gas or radiation . @xmath41 and @xmath42 do affect the energy equation in a different way , and to describe this effect , we define the gas pressure ratio @xmath43 , @xmath44 there is one particular case that when @xmath45 , no matter what the value of @xmath43 is , the solution remains the same , as in this case equation ( 6 ) becomes @xmath46 ; if the accretion flow is radiation pressure dominated ( @xmath47 ) , then equation ( 6 ) also becomes @xmath46 , and the flow structure wo nt depend on @xmath27 ; if the accretion flow is gas pressure dominated , then equation ( 6 ) becomes @xmath48 , and the result will depend on the value of @xmath27 . for a general case , equation ( 6 ) can be written as @xmath49p.\\ ] ] physically @xmath43 is a value between 0 and 1 , so @xmath50 is always between @xmath51 and @xmath52",
    ". then we can expect that a general solution should be somewhere between two extreme cases : the gas pressure dominated case and the radiation pressure dominated case .",
    "for these two extreme cases , we can calculate the exact solutions of the problem , as equation ( 6 ) will be simplified to forms without @xmath43 .",
    "these two cases also provide the typical solutions we emphasize in  3.1 .",
    "however we also want to know how the solutions change from the gas pressure dominated case to the radiation pressure dominated case . for",
    "the accretion flows in which both gas pressure and radiation pressure are important , we have to assume the gas pressure ratio @xmath43 to be constant to solve the problem . solving",
    "the problem with variant @xmath43 is beyond the capability of this self - similar treatment , and we re planning to do that in our next work .",
    "as we already mentioned , the radiation pressure dominated case has the same result as that of the gas pressure dominated case with @xmath45 , so the question eventually becomes examining how the solution changes according to @xmath27 for the gas pressure dominated case .",
    "we define an equivalent @xmath27 here @xmath53 so that equation ( 6 ) becomes @xmath54 and this @xmath55 represents the equivalent @xmath27 that the accretion flow would have if the flow is treated as gas pressure dominated ( even @xmath56 ) .",
    "we can see that if the flow is radiation pressure dominated ( @xmath57 ) , then no matter what the value of @xmath27 is , @xmath55 is always 4/3 .",
    "here we treat @xmath27 as a constant , and for any specific case , we can get a constant @xmath55 and all the situations can be treated as a gas pressure dominated flow with @xmath55 as an input parameter .",
    "usually @xmath27 is taken as a value between 7/5(the value for diatomic ideal gas ) and 5/3(the value for monatomic ideal gas ) , so that @xmath55 ranges between 4/3 and 5/3 .    with equations ( 7)-(11 ) and ( 15 ) , the equations ( 1)-(5 ) can be reduced to a set of five odes :    @xmath58=0,\\ ] ]    @xmath59=0,\\ ] ]    @xmath60=0,\\ ] ]    @xmath61=0,\\ ] ]    @xmath62 - 2\\gamma_\\mathrm{equ }      v_\\theta(\\theta)\\frac{d\\rho(\\theta)}{d\\theta}\\right\\}=0,\\ ] ]    with 5 dimensionless fuctions @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , the variable @xmath1 and four input parameters ( @xmath2,@xmath3,@xmath55,@xmath35 ) .",
    "this set of odes can be numerically solved with proper boundary conditions .",
    "we assume the structure of the disk is symmetric to the equatorial plane , and thus we have @xmath63 in which only four conditions are independent .",
    "for the last boundary condition we set @xmath64 , which can be normalized by a scale factor if the effective accretion rate at a certain radius is set ( ny95 , xw05 , etc . ) .",
    "these boundary conditions are enough for our calculations and we did nt introduce other arbitrary boundary conditions .",
    "we obtained numerical solutions of equations ( 16)-(20 ) with different sets of input parameters ( @xmath2,@xmath3,@xmath55,@xmath35 ) .",
    "some typical solutions are shown in figures 1 - 4 .",
    "the calculation starts from the equatorial plane ( @xmath65 ) towards the vertical axis ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "generally the mass density @xmath67 and total pressure @xmath21 will decrease as @xmath1 decreases , and at certain inclination they will get very close to 0 as shown in the figures .",
    "we take this as the upper boundary of the flow structure .",
    "if we continue the calculation through this inclination , it will encounter numerical errors .",
    "we think the reason is that we ca nt describe the flow near the vertical axis with a simple self - similar solution in the radial direction .",
    "this effect is also to be expected .",
    "if we describe the upper boundary ( minimum @xmath1 ) that we reach in our calculation as @xmath68 , then the effective accretion rate @xmath69 across a sphere at radius @xmath31 within the region calculated by us is @xmath70 which is a function of @xmath31 unless @xmath34 . in equation",
    "( 22 ) ( and subsequently in this paper ) negative values of @xmath69 represent inflow while positive values represent outflow .",
    "if we describe the accretion rate in the region between the vertical axis and the inclination @xmath68 as @xmath71 , then according to the steady nature of the flow , we have @xmath72 in which @xmath73 represents the total accretion rate across any sphere at a reasonable radius centered by the central accretor and should be a constant for a steady accretion flow .",
    "if the solution does nt end at an upper boundary , and instead can describe the entire flow structure in the whole space , then @xmath74 and @xmath75 , which should be a constant . according to equation ( 22 ) , this can only happen in the following two cases : ( 1 ) @xmath34 which enforces @xmath69 not to change with radius @xmath31 ; ( 2 ) when @xmath76 , the integration term in equation ( 22 ) must be 0 , in which case @xmath77 and is a constant along radius @xmath31 .",
    "the first case was discussed in ny95 . because @xmath34 , @xmath78 is independent of @xmath31 , and the continuity equation ( 1 ) shows that @xmath5 , resulting in a solution in which the flow is always radial ( with rotation ) .",
    "the second case was discussed in xc97 , and the fact that @xmath79 requires that the outflow rate exactly equals the inflow rate at any radius .",
    "however this is unrealistic for an accretion flow , which is also discussed in xw05 .",
    "the reason is that , when material is accreted in the form of an accretion flow , gravitational energy is released and part of it is changed to internal energy via viscous friction .",
    "the restriction that outflow rate equals inflow rate requires that the internal energy released from gravitational energy should be fully returned to gravitational energy , which violates the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "therefore , the inflow rate must be larger than the outflow rate at a certain radius , in order to compensate for the increase in entropy in the hydrodynamic process .",
    "as we have mentioned before , there are many observations of accretion systems with outflows , and they can be neither of the two cases mentioned above ( case ( 1 ) has no outflow while case ( 2 ) violates the second law of thermodynamics ) .",
    "so the self - similar solutions for an accretion disk with outflow have to be truncated at some inclination .",
    "it should be noted that this effect has already been discussed in xw05 , though they assumed that the self - similar solution is only valid for the inflow part .",
    "our solutions , however , show that at least part of the outflow ( with @xmath80 ) can be described with self - similar assumptions .    from the above analysis",
    ", we can also see that @xmath35 is a very important parameter .",
    "when @xmath34 , the entire flow structure can be described by the same set of self - similar solutions , however this kind of solutions have no outflow .",
    "when @xmath81 , self - similar solutions can only describe part of the entire flow structure . according to equation ( 22 ) , when @xmath82 , the effective accretion rate @xmath69 decreases as @xmath31 decreases , implying that material is lost due to outflows .",
    "this kind of solutions contain outflows , which is also consistent with the results of many numerical simulation works ( e.g. okuda et al .",
    "2005 ; ohsuga et al.2005 ;",
    "ohsuga & mineshige 2007 ; ohsuga et al .",
    "2009 ) . on the other hand , when @xmath83 , the solutions have an effective accretion rate @xmath69 that increases towards the central accretor , which implies that there must be matter injection into the accretion flow from high latitudes .",
    "this kind of matter injection is not likely to happen in real cases .",
    "so we would like to investigate solutions with @xmath84 .",
    "solutions with @xmath34 have been examined in ny95 , and they are only for adafs , while solutions with @xmath82 in our work is applicable to a much wider range of accretion disk types .",
    "so in this subsection , we take @xmath85 to calculate the typical solutions . in this way",
    "we can observe how the solutions differ from those of @xmath34 when @xmath35 does nt change much .",
    "we also calculated how the solutions change with different @xmath35 , which will be discussed in detail in  3.2 .",
    "the result shows that , when other parameters are the same , for a large range of @xmath35 with @xmath82 the solutions display similar structures qualitatively .    the value of the viscosity parameter @xmath2 can be inferred both from observations and from mhd simulations of magneto - rotational instability ( mri ) . as reviewed by king et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , the value of @xmath2 for ionized disks given by numerical simulations is @xmath86 , while that obtained through observations is @xmath87 . however , the observational determinations of @xmath2 are strongly model - dependent and it still remains an open question what the value of @xmath2 should be for hot , ionized disks . in this subsection",
    "we take @xmath88 , which is a typical value used in theoretical models of accretion disks .",
    "we also discussed how the solutions would change with different @xmath2 in  3.2 .    among the most popular analytical disk models",
    "are the ssd , adaf and slim disk models , so here we show the solutions with input parameter corresponding to them respectively . for accretion flows composed mostly of fully ionized hydrogen , the material can be regarded as monatomic ideal gas , of which @xmath89 , and that is the value we take here ( accretion flows composed of unionized @xmath90 would have @xmath91 .",
    "we did nt discuss this situation here , but some relative results can be found in  3.2 ) .",
    "figures 1 & 2 are both for the ssd model which has little advection ( @xmath92 ) , while figure 1 is for the gas pressure dominated region and figure 2 for the radiation pressure dominated region .",
    "the adaf model is treated as advection dominated(@xmath93 ) , and gas pressure dominated ( @xmath94 , so that @xmath95 ) , as shown in figure 3 .",
    "the slim disk model is treated as advection dominated(@xmath93 ) , and radiation pressure dominated ( @xmath57 , so that @xmath96 ) , as shown in figure 4 .",
    "the other two parameters are all set as @xmath88 and @xmath85 . in each figure , we show the function curves of @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath36 and the mach numbers of @xmath9 and @xmath6 , in which the adiabatic sound speed is calculated as @xmath97 as shown in equations ( 7 - 11 ) , all the velocities scale with @xmath98 . the density @xmath36 is scaled to 1 in the equatorial plane and it can be determined in a real case once the accretion rate at a certain radius is given .",
    "the pressure @xmath21 is also scaled , and it satisfies the relation that @xmath99 .",
    "so once we get the actual density @xmath67 at a certain radius , we can calculate the corresponding pressure @xmath21 easily .",
    "the mach number curves for @xmath9 first decreases with @xmath1 , reaching 0 at some inclination , and then increases . that is because it changes sign along @xmath1 and we use absolute values in calculating the mach numbers .",
    "there are several common features among figures 1 - 4 .",
    "the value of @xmath6 is always non - positive .",
    "the value of @xmath9 is always negative close to the equatorial plane , and becomes positive at smaller inclinations . in each of these figures",
    ", there exists a certain inclination @xmath100 at which @xmath101 .",
    "this @xmath100 has similar meaning with the @xmath100 in xw05 , except that it is obtained through calculation rather than being preset as an input parameter in xw05 . in the region",
    "@xmath102 , @xmath37 is negative , meaning that the accretion flow is moving towards the central accretor as inflow .",
    "so this region corresponds to the normal accretion disk part in basic models and we call it the inflow region in this paper . in the region",
    "@xmath103 , @xmath37 is positive and the accretion flow is moving away from the central accretor , and we call this region the outflow region .",
    "the region between the upper boundary and the vertical axis contains the outflow which blows out of the upper boundary in the form of wind as shown in figure 5 , and we call this region the wind region , to distinguish it from the outflow region .",
    "it should be noted that our solutions actually can not describe the structure of the wind region .",
    "however , it is natural to suppose that the flow structure in the wind region with @xmath104 is also outflow , and the outflow region ( @xmath103 ) can either be regarded as a transition region between inflow and outflow , or as part of the outflow which can still be described with the self - similar assumptions .",
    "the physical properties shown in figures 1 & 2 agree quite well with the ssd model .",
    "the rotation is very close to being keplerian ; the radial velocity is much smaller than the azimuthal velocity ; and the disk is geometrically thin . however , as mentioned above , our calculation shows that even in the ssd case , there exists outflow in the accretion disk .",
    "as shown in figures 5(a ) & 5(b ) , this outflow is in the form of wind blowing out from the disk surface .",
    "both @xmath9 and @xmath6 are subsonic in the ssd cases .",
    "the advection dominated solutions , as shown in figures 3 & 4 , are geometrically much thicker than the solutions with low advection , and are able to describe the structure of the majority of the space , except only a small region near the vertical axis .",
    "the rotation is sub - keplerian and the radial velocity can be comparable with the azimuthal velocity .",
    "both the adaf and the slim disk case show strong outflows compared with the ssd cases , which can be seen more clearly in figure 5 .",
    "@xmath6 keeps to be subsonic for both cases .",
    "however , for the slim disk case ( figure 4 ) , @xmath9 becomes supersonic near the vertical axis , displaying a stronger outflow than the other three typical solutions .",
    "outflow is the result of the competition among the pressure gradient , the centrifugal force and the gravitational force . as we have mentioned before , the key feature of the outflow in our work is positive @xmath9 , so we would like to investigate the properties of these forces along the radial direction .",
    "the radial components of the pressure gradient , the centrifugal force and the gravitational force can be written respectively as @xmath105 in which @xmath106 we plot the values of @xmath107 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 for the four typical solutions in figure 6 .",
    "the dotted lines correspond to the gravitational force which is scaled as 1 ; the dashed lines correspond to the radial component of the centrifugal force ; the dot - dashed lines correspond to the radial component of the pressure gradient ; and the solid lines correspond to the sum of the radial components of the centrifugal force and the pressure gradient , which drives the outflow .",
    "figure 6(a ) shows the properties of gas pressure dominated ssds , while figure 6(b ) shows the properties of radiation pressure dominated ssds .",
    "it can be seen that for both of the ssd cases , the influence of pressure gradient is very small , and almost in the entire range of the solution , the gravitational force is balanced with the sum of the centrifugal force and the pressure gradient in the radial direction .",
    "this is consistent with the ssd model in which both the advection and the pressure gradient are small enough to be neglected .",
    "therefore these two solutions have similar accretion flow structure and only some quantitative differences exist between each other .    on the other hand , for the advection dominated cases , such as the adaf case ( figure 6(c ) ) and the slim disk case ( figure 6(d ) ) , the pressure gradient plays a more important role than the centrifugal force and drives a significant outflow as @xmath1 decreases .",
    "the slim disk case has qualitative differences from the other three cases . in both ssd cases and the adaf case ,",
    "the radial component of pressure gradient starts decreasing at smaller inclination angle , and to balance this effect , the disk rotates faster as @xmath1 decreases to increase the centrifugal force , as shown in figures 1 - 3 .",
    "however in the slim disk case , the radial component of the pressure gradient keeps increasing as @xmath1 decreases .",
    "it not only drives a much stronger outflow than the other three cases , but also reduces the required centripetal force to keep the disk rotating .",
    "thus the disk rotates slower as @xmath1 decreases , as shown in figure 4 .    as a comparison with ny95",
    ", we also present here a solution with parameters @xmath88 , @xmath34 , @xmath110 and @xmath93 in figure 7 .",
    "this set of parameters corresponds to @xmath111 in ny95 . in this case",
    ", the accretion flow does nt contain outflow and the three components of velocity and the sound speed remain constant in the structure .",
    "the curves of @xmath36 and @xmath37 do nt agree well with ny95 , however this is because ny95 also sets the boundary conditions on the vertical axis and the values of @xmath36 and @xmath37 are limited by these boundary conditions .",
    "our solution only uses the boundary conditions in the equatorial plane , and can still reach the vertical axis in this case and has a reasonable distribution of physical properties , which further proves the applicability of our method .      in this section",
    "we show how the solutions change according to different input parameters respectively , and discuss their physical meanings .",
    "as shown in  3.1 , the whole space is generally divided into three regions : an inflow region , an outflow region and a wind region . as the accretion flow is symmetrical both axially and under reflection in the equatorial plane",
    ", we only need to investigate the flow structure in a quadrant of the @xmath112 plane . in this case , the inflow region starts from the equatorial plane ( @xmath65 ) to the inclination @xmath113 where @xmath101 ; the outflow region starts from the inclination @xmath113 to the upper boundary of the flow structure at @xmath114 , and beyond that is the wind region ( @xmath115 ) in which the motion of the matter does nt satisfy the self - similar assumptions .",
    "here we use @xmath100 and @xmath68 as indicators of the disk size in @xmath1-direction , which directly reflects the size of the inflow region and the whole inflow / outflow region , respectively . in the figures showing how the properties of solutions change according to input parameters ,",

    "1 ) solution dependence on \\alpha `    the dependence of @xmath100 and @xmath68 on @xmath2 is shown in figure 8 .",
    "first we can clearly see that over a large range of @xmath2 , the advection dominated solutions have both larger inflow region and larger inflow / outflow region . that s because in these solutions most of the viscous heating is stored in the accretion flow as internal energy , resulting in larger pressure at given density and thus larger size of the whole inflow / outflow region .    for solutions with the same advective factor @xmath3",
    ", gas pressure dominated solutions generally have larger inflow region .",
    "the inflow region lasts from the equatorial plane to the inclination @xmath100 where @xmath9 reaches 0 , so its size depends on the behavior of @xmath9 . in the equatorial plane , the reflection symmetry gives equation ( 21 ) , and when it is substituted into equations ( 17 ) , ( 19 ) & ( 20 ) , we can get @xmath116 equation ( 30 ) describes the hydrodynamical balance in the radial direction among the pressure gradient , the centrifugal force and the gravitational force , which determines the acceleration of @xmath9 ( the term @xmath117 represents the acceleration of @xmath9 under the self - similar assumptions ) .",
    "equation ( 31 ) describes how the viscosity affects the angular momentum transfer rate in the equatorial plane .",
    "equation ( 32 ) describes the energy mechanism of the accretion flow that a fraction @xmath3 of the dissipated energy is advected as stored entropy .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath9 is generally negative in the equatorial plane , so the absolute value of @xmath9 can be written as ( according to equation ( 32 ) ) @xmath118.\\ ] ] if @xmath119 remains the same , then in the range of parameters we study in this paper , @xmath120 increases with @xmath55 .",
    "however @xmath119 also changes with input parameters , and the exact value of @xmath121 should be calculated via equations ( 30)-(32 ) .",
    "figure 10 shows the profile of @xmath121 vs @xmath55 when other parameters are taken as @xmath85 and @xmath88 .",
    "it can be seen that for both the advection dominated solutions and the solutions with little advection , @xmath120 increases with @xmath55 . with a larger value of @xmath9 in the equatorial plane ,",
    "the accretion flow is inclined to undergo a larger range of @xmath1 to change @xmath9 to 0 , resulting in a larger inflow region .",
    "for the two ssd cases , as their flow structures are quite similar , larger values of @xmath9 in the equatorial plane give the gas pressure dominated solution set @xmath122 larger inflow regions than @xmath123 .",
    "for the advection - dominated cases , not only the equatorial value of @xmath9 is smaller in the slim disk case than that in the adaf case , but its radial direction pressure gradient also increases as @xmath1 decreases , giving a larger outward acceleration to @xmath9 , thus the gas pressure dominated solutions @xmath124 have larger inflow regions than the radiation pressure dominated solutions @xmath125 .",
    "the solution set @xmath125 , which corresponds to the slim disk model , has a large outflow size over a broad range of @xmath2 , displaying a large outflow area .",
    "the solutions corresponding to the ssd model , @xmath122 and @xmath123 , have very small outflow regions , and their outflows are mainly in the form of wind blowing out of the disk surface instead of escaping in the outflow region .",
    "the solution set @xmath124 , which corresponds to the adaf model , has a moderate outflow region with small @xmath2 .",
    "however as @xmath2 increases , this outflow region quickly disappears and the outflow takes the form of wind blowing out of the upper surface .",
    "the velocity field displayed in figure 5 is an example for @xmath88 .",
    "@xmath2 is connected with both the viscous heating and the angular momentum transport of the accretion flow .",
    "larger @xmath2 will increase the viscous heating for a fixed surface density .",
    "but at the same time it also increases the angular momentum transfer rate , thus increasing @xmath9 and decreasing surface density , which decreases the total viscous heating rate . therefore the dependence of the viscous heating rate on @xmath2 , is somewhat complex .",
    "viscous heating represents how much gravitational energy is converted to internal energy . but some of it is lost due to radiation and eventually there is only an @xmath3 fraction of the viscous heating which is converted to internal energy .",
    "the increase in the internal energy will raise the temperature and subsequently the pressure , thus increasing the size of the accretion flow .",
    "however , for the ssd cases shown in @xmath122 & @xmath123 , @xmath3 is very small , thus the energy converted to internal energy is negligible and the disk structure is dominated dynamically by the gravity and the rotation of the material , rather than the pressure gradient . as a result , the sizes of accretion flows change very little with different @xmath2 for @xmath122 & @xmath123 .    on the other hand ,",
    "for the advection dominated solutions @xmath124 & @xmath125 , a large fraction of the gravitational energy is eventually stored as internal energy , so that the pressure gradient plays a more important role in determining the flow structure as mentioned in  3.1 . therefore the sizes of accretion flows are closely connected with @xmath2 . in figure 8",
    "we can see that for @xmath124 & @xmath125 , when @xmath2 is very small , the viscous process is not quite effective , therefore both the inflow region size and the outflow region size are small ( it s easy to understand if we consider the situation @xmath126 , in which case no accretion flow will be formed ) . from this small value , along with the increasing of @xmath2 , the viscous process starts to take effect and the whole inflow / outflow region size starts to increase , until it reaches a maximum size at @xmath127 for line @xmath128 and @xmath129 for line @xmath130(the exact value of @xmath2 for maximum size also depends on other parameters ) . from then on , the larger values of @xmath9 starts to dominate the total effect and the corresponding accretion flow size starts to decrease .",
    "this property can also be seen in the top left panel of figure 17 , which displays the ratio of the outflow rate to the inflow rate .",
    "it should be noted that , in figure 8 , the size change based on @xmath2 is different between the whole inflow / outflow region and the pure inflow region .",
    "the size of the whole inflow / outflow region decreases after a peak at a certain @xmath2 while the size of the pure inflow region keeps increasing . for solution sets @xmath122 , @xmath124 and @xmath125 ,",
    "this difference is enough to generate a critical @xmath131 respectively , at which the outflow region totally disappears .",
    "so for @xmath132 , the accretion flow that we can resolve with self - similar assumptions is composed of pure inflow and we did nt find a surface at which @xmath133 .",
    "that s why we say that the assumption used in xw05 may not be true for large @xmath2 .",
    "kluzniak and kita ( 2000 ) also found this critical @xmath2 which was calculated to be @xmath134 by them . in our work , however , @xmath131 depends on other parameters and can change significantly , as shown in figure 8 ( @xmath135 for @xmath122 , @xmath136 for @xmath124 and @xmath137 for @xmath125 ) . for @xmath123 ,",
    "this @xmath131 is above 1 and it s not displayed .",

    "we can see that in the solutions corresponding to the ssd model , i.e. figures 9(a ) & 9(b ) , @xmath9 is almost proportional to @xmath2 .",
    "that is because when alpha increases , so does the angular momentum transfer rate . for the ssd case , the accretion flow structure",
    "is mostly determined by gravity and rotation as discussed in  3.1 , and the rotation is quasi - keplerian , so the increase in angular momentum transfer rate increases @xmath9 almost proportionally .",
    "a special case in the equatorial plane is shown by equation ( 31 ) , in which when @xmath10 is keplerian , the value of @xmath9 is proportional to @xmath2 . for the adaf and the slim disk cases , because pressure gradient plays an important role in the accretion flow structure , @xmath9 is generally not proportional to @xmath2 , but still positively correlated with @xmath2 as shown in figure 9(c ) & 9(d ) .",
    "we can also see that some lines in figure 9 do nt contain positive @xmath9 . that s because the @xmath2 values for these solutions are greater than the critical value @xmath131 mentioned above .",
    "` 2 ) solution dependence on n `    the parameter @xmath35 describes how the density changes along the radius in our self - similar assumptions . as discussed in  3.1 , when @xmath34 , the entire flow structure can be described by the same set of self - similar solutions , but does nt contain outflow ; when @xmath82 , the solution contains outflow but the self - similar assumptions can not be applied to the region near the vertical axis ; solutions with @xmath83 are unlikely to happen in real cases .",
    "the dependence of @xmath100 and @xmath68 on @xmath35 is shown in figure 11 .",
    "figures 12 & 13 display the @xmath9 and @xmath6 distributions along the @xmath1-direction for solutions with different @xmath35 .",
    "we can see that solutions all achieve a maximum size at @xmath34 for both the whole inflow / outflow region and the inflow only region .",
    "this is because when @xmath34 the entire space can be described by the same set of self - similar equations as discussed in  3.1 . in this case ,",
    "@xmath5 and mass is conserved on the streamlines pointing exactly at the central accretor , thus no outflow is required . before reaching the maximum value at @xmath34 , the flow size is positively correlated with @xmath35 as a general trend .",
    "as @xmath35 decreases , according to equation ( 22 ) @xmath69 decreases faster inwards , which means a larger mass loss rate into the area beyond @xmath68 , resulting in the increase in the size of the wind region and the decrease in the size of the whole inflow / outflow region in figure 11 , and the increase in @xmath6 in figure 13 .    in figure 11 line @xmath138 has 2 peaks . according to equation ( 25 ) ,",
    "the radial pressure gradient is proportional to @xmath139 , so when @xmath140 does nt change much , the radial pressure gradient increases with @xmath35 . in advection - dominated solutions @xmath141 & @xmath142 ,",
    "the radial pressure gradient is more important than centrifugal force in accelerating @xmath9 , so for larger @xmath35 which is inclined to have larger radial pressure gradient , one would expect to see faster increase in @xmath9 and stronger outflow in the outflow region .",
    "these features of @xmath9 can be seen in figure 12 .",
    "the radial pressure gradient is dominant in the slim disk case as mentioned in  3.1 , so the acceleration of @xmath9 increases significantly with increasing @xmath35 in the slim disk case , which can be seen in figure 12(d ) with a much steeper profile of @xmath9 when @xmath85 .",
    "this increased outflow velocity in the outflow region can cause a steeper density drop along @xmath1 direction towards the upper boundary and therefore make the outflow region become smaller , creating a valley in line @xmath138 around @xmath143 .",
    "the top right panel in figure 17 shows how the ratio of the outflow rate to the inflow rate changes depending on @xmath35 .",
    "we can see that when @xmath35 becomes small enough , the ratio changes very little with @xmath35 . in this range of @xmath35 , the size of different regions also does nt change much in figure 10 , and the flow structure is similar to each other .    for @xmath95 , we can not get a reasonable set of equatorial values for physical properties when @xmath35 is larger than 3/2 . for @xmath96 , i.e. solutions @xmath144 and @xmath142 , we can still get reasonable values of equatorial physical properties when @xmath35 is larger than 3/2 , so that we can calculate solutions with @xmath83 in this case .",
    "solutions with @xmath83 have an effective accretion rate @xmath69 that increases towards the central accretor , which implies that there must be matter injection into the accretion flow from high latitudes . this kind of matter injection is not likely to happen in real cases , so we wo nt pay more attention to the solutions with @xmath83 here . solutions with @xmath34 and @xmath82",
    "both exist and have quite different structure .",
    "however , as in ny95 , solutions with @xmath34 are only for adafs , while solutions with @xmath82 in our work is applicable to a much wider range of accretion disks . in this sense",
    ", we believe that outflows should be common in various accretion disks .    `",
    "3 ) solution dependence on f `    the dependence of @xmath100 and @xmath68 on @xmath3 is shown in figure 14 .",
    "it has already been discussed that as the advective factor @xmath3 increases , the size of the whole inflow / outflow region also increases , which is shown more clearly here in figure 14 .",
    "the gas pressure dominated solutions have larger inflow region in agreement with figures 8 & 11 , and the reason has been discussed in  3.2.1 .    as @xmath3 increases , the size of the outflow region increases faster for radiation pressure dominated flows , displaying a larger outflow size for solutions corresponding to the slim disk model .",
    "the reason is that , as @xmath3 increases , a larger fraction of viscous heating is converted to internal energy instead of being lost via radiation , raising the temperature of the accretion flow .",
    "the gas pressure is proportional to @xmath145 while the radiation pressure is proportional to @xmath146 , so in the radiation pressure dominated solutions , @xmath21 increases faster as @xmath3 increases .",
    "the increased pressure inflates the outflow region and causes a stronger outflow . on the other hand ,",
    "as @xmath3 gets close to 1 , eventually the outflow velocity at small inclination becomes so large , that it will instead reduce the size of the outflow region because the material lost in the outflow region is limited .",
    "as shown in the bottom left panel of figure 17 , at a certain @xmath147 , the fraction of material lost in the outflow region reaches an upper limit , and with larger @xmath3 , this fraction almost remains unchanged . in this range of @xmath3 ,",
    "the larger outflow velocity will instead shrink the size of the outflow region .",
    "this causes line @xmath148 in figure 14 to reach a peak of @xmath149 at @xmath147 ( corresponding to figure 17(c ) ) , and to start decreasing as @xmath3 becomes larger .    `",
    "4 ) solution dependence on \\gamma_\\mathrm{equ } ( and consequently \\beta ) `    the dependence of @xmath100 and @xmath68 on @xmath55 is shown in figure 15 .",
    "the top axis displays the corresponding values of @xmath43 when @xmath27 takes the value of 5/3 .",
    "if the intrinsic heat capacity ratio is not 5/3 ( e.g. when dealing with proto - stellar accretion disks with unionized gas ) , the corresponding @xmath43 in figure 15 may not be correct , but one can still calculate the correct @xmath43 with @xmath55 and @xmath27 according to equation ( 14 ) .",
    "figure 16 displays the @xmath9 and @xmath6 distributions along the @xmath1-direction for solutions with different @xmath55 .",
    "the bottom right panel of figure 17 shows how the ratio of the outflow rate to the inflow rate changes depending on @xmath55 ( and consequently @xmath43 ) .",
    "in figure 15 , the size of the pure inflow region generally increases with @xmath55 ( and consequently @xmath43 ) .",
    "as shown in figure 10 & 16 and discussed in  3.2.1 , solutions with larger @xmath55 ( and consequently larger gas pressure ratio @xmath43 ) have larger values of @xmath9 in the equatorial plane . this effect combined with the acceleration properties of @xmath9 ,",
    "causes solutions with larger @xmath55 ( and consequently larger @xmath43 ) to have larger inflow region . for solutions with low advection , as the outflow region is very small , the size of the whole inflow / outflow region also displays similar profile with increasing @xmath55 ( and consequently @xmath43 ) .",
    "that s why lines @xmath150 , @xmath151 and @xmath152 all have positive slope in figure 15 .    in figure 17(d ) , there exists a transition point for the advection dominated solutions , and for solutions with @xmath153 ( corresponding to @xmath154 ) , the ratio of the outflow rate to the inflow rate keeps being large . as discussed before , for the advection dominated cases , radiation pressure dominated solutions have larger pressure gradient , shown as steeper velocity profiles in figure 16 , which drives stronger outflow . as shown in figure 17(d ) , the outflow to inflow ratio increases as @xmath55 decreases from 5/3 ( which indicates the decreasing of gas pressure ratio @xmath43 from 1 ) .",
    "however , the outflow rate can not exceed the inflow rate and eventually the increase will cease , reaching a transition point at @xmath155 ( corresponding to @xmath156 ) . for @xmath153 ( corresponding to @xmath157 ) , the outflow to inflow ratio remains almost unchanged .",
    "further decrease in @xmath55 will continue to increase the outflow velocity , while the fraction of the inflow lost in the outflow region is almost unchanged , so the size of the outflow region will shrink .",
    "this feature can be also seen in figure 15 , which shows that the size of the outflow region for advection dominated solutions first increases with decreasing @xmath55 , reaching an upper limit at @xmath155 ( corresponding to @xmath156 ) , and decreases with decreasing @xmath55 after that .",
    "it should be noted that , this transition value of @xmath55 depends on other input parameters , and this value of @xmath158 corresponds to @xmath88 , @xmath85 and @xmath93 . for the solutions with low advection , the ratio of the outflow rate to the inflow rate do nt change much and are always very small as shown in figure 17(d ) .    `",
    "5 ) bends in solutions `    we have shown the solution dependence on different input parameters",
    ". the solutions sometimes show bends which we would like to discuss more specifically here .",
    "the bend about @xmath2 is closely connected with the energy mechanism . as discussed in",
    " 3.2.1 , the dependence of viscous heating on @xmath2 is somewhat complex .",
    "it has a peak at a certain value of @xmath2 ( which depends on other input parameters ) , and decreases on both sides . for the advection",
    "dominated solutions @xmath124 & @xmath125 , most of the viscous heating is stored as internal energy in the accretion flow , which raises the temperature and subsequently the pressure , thus increasing the size of the accretion flow . on the other hand , the increase in @xmath2 also increases the absolute value of @xmath9 of the inflow near the equatorial plane , in which case more work needs to be done to drive an outflow , decreasing the outflow region as @xmath2 increases .",
    "so naturally the size of the whole inflow / outflow region also has a peak at some value of @xmath2 .",
    "as @xmath2 increases from a very small value , at first the increase in viscous heating dominates the total effect , and the size of the accretion flow increases , until it reaches a maximum value ; from then on , the increase in @xmath9 starts to dominate the total effect , which makes the outflow more difficult to produce and also reduces viscous heating when @xmath2 becomes large enough , thus shrinking the size of the whole accretion flow . to show the energy profile for solutions with different @xmath2 , here we calculate the @xmath1-averaged bernoulli function @xmath159 .",
    "the bernoulli function represents the specific total energy in the accretion flow .",
    "a positive value of the bernoulli function is only a necessary , not a sufficient , condition for outflow formation ( abramowicz et al . 2000 ) .",
    "however , as our solutions have already showed outflow structure in the velocity fields , a larger value of the bernoulli function indicates that the accretion flow is more likely to contain stronger outflow .",
    "locally the bernoulli function can be written as @xmath160,\\ ] ] in which @xmath161 is the specific enthalpy , @xmath162 is the velocity ( all three components included ) and @xmath163 is the gravitational potential .",
    "so the @xmath1-averaged bernoulli function can be written as @xmath164 \\sin\\theta d\\theta }      { \\int_{\\theta_\\mathrm{b}}^{90\\textordmasculine } \\rho(\\theta)\\cdot \\sin\\theta      d\\theta}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] figure 18 displays how the @xmath1-averaged bernoulli function @xmath159 changes with variant @xmath2 for the advection dominated cases .",
    "it can be seen that the positions of the peaks agree quite well with the bends of line @xmath128 and line @xmath130 in figure 8 .",
    "figure 19 displays the velocity fields of solutions around the bend for variant @xmath2 .",
    "the values of @xmath2 are chosen so that the solutions on both sides of the peaks have similar upper boundaries ( @xmath165 ) .",
    "it can be seen that the velocities in the outflow region are more aligned to the @xmath1 direction in the right panel of each row than those in the left panel . that s because larger @xmath2 increases the angular momentum transfer rate , thus increases the absolute value of @xmath9 near the equatorial plane where most of the material is accreted .",
    "the value of @xmath9 is negative in the equatorial plane and changes gradually to positive values in the outflow region under the effect of pressure gradient and centrifugal force .",
    "the absolute value of @xmath9 in the equatorial plane in the right panel of each row is significantly larger than that in the left panel , so when pressure gradient does nt differ much , the positive values of @xmath9 in the outflow region will be smaller for larger @xmath2 and the velocities will be more aligned to the @xmath1 direction . the solutions corresponding to slim disks ( the second row ) show velocities more aligned to the radial direction in the outflow region than those corresponding to adafs ( the first row ) , due to larger pressure gradient and thus larger values of @xmath9 in the outflow region .",
    "the bends in solution dependence on @xmath35 , @xmath3 and @xmath55 have different physical mechanism from that on @xmath2 .",
    "it has been mentioned that , as @xmath35 increases , @xmath3 increases or @xmath55 decreases , the pressure gradient increases and drives stronger outflow .",
    "however , the outflow rate can not exceed the inflow rate . at seen in figure 17 , the ratio of the outflow rate to the inflow rate for lines @xmath142 , @xmath166 and @xmath152 will eventually reach an upper limit at certain values of corresponding parameters . for",
    "solution sets @xmath166 and @xmath152 , further increase in @xmath3 or further decrease in @xmath55 will continue to increase the radial outflow velocity , while the outflow rate in the outflow region is almost unchanged , so the size of the outflow region will shrink . for the solution dependence on @xmath35 ,",
    "the bend near @xmath167 has similar physical reason as the bends for @xmath3 and @xmath55 .",
    "however , the size of the accretion flow has another peak at @xmath34 , where the flow is always radial ( with rotation ) and no outflow is needed .",
    "so line @xmath142 in figure 17 starts to drop as @xmath35 gets close to 3/2 and line @xmath138 in figure 11 gets to another peak at @xmath34 .",
    "figure 20 displays the velocity fields of solutions around the bend for variant @xmath35 , @xmath3 and @xmath55 .",
    "it can be seen that , as @xmath35 increases ( the first row ) , @xmath3 increases ( the second row ) or @xmath55 decreases ( the third row ) , the flow patterns display similar evolvement for these parameters : at first both the accretion flow size and the radial outflow velocity increase ; after the corresponding parameter gets past the respective value at the transition point ( the middle panels in all three rows of figure 20 ) , the radial outflow velocity continues to increase while the size of the accretion flow decreases .",
    "the velocities in the outflow regions become more aligned to the radial direction from left to right in all three rows , due to increased radial outflow velocities .",

    "with the self - similar assumptions along the radial direction and boundary conditions obtained from the reflection symmetry in the equatorial plane , we are able to solve the navier - stokes equations along the @xmath1 direction explicitly , and the velocity field is obtained .",
    "the result shows that outflows are common in all kinds of accretion disk models , which is consistent with some numerical simulation works ( e.g. ohsuga et al.2005 ; ohsuga & mineshige 2007 ; ohsuga et al .",
    "generally the accretion flow consists of three different regions : an inflow region near the equatorial plane which contains the largest portion of mass , an outflow region above the inflow region in which the matter starts escaping the central accretor in the @xmath31-direction , and a wind region which contains the material blowing out from the boundary of the outflow region .",
    "the structure of the inflow and the outflow region can be resolved in our solutions , while the wind region does nt obey the self - similar assumptions and can not be resolved by our calculation .",
    "the inflow region and the wind region are essential to form a steady accretion flow structure .",
    "the outflow region is missing in the cases with large viscosity parameter @xmath132 .",
    "the critical value @xmath131 depends on other parameters and is @xmath136 for adafs , @xmath137 for slim disks and @xmath135 for gas pressure dominated ssds when @xmath85 .    to compare with the popular analytical models",
    ", we calculated solutions with parameters corresponding to the ssd , the adaf and the slim disk models .",
    "the solutions corresponding to the ssd model have relatively thin , quasi - keplerian disks with very small outflow regions , and the outflows mostly take the form of wind from the disk surface .",
    "the solutions corresponding to the adaf and slim disk models have thick , sub - keplerian disks .",
    "the solution corresponding to the adaf model has a moderate outflow region which shrinks quickly with the increase of @xmath2 , and the outflow mainly takes the form of wind .",
    "however as the upper boundary of the outflow region is close to the vertical axis , eventually the outflow may take the form of bipolar jets , though we can not actually resolve the explicit structure around the vertical axis .",
    "the solutions corresponding to the slim disk model has a large outflow region in which most of the outflow takes place , and near the upper boundary of the outflow region , the material escapes with supersonic velocity .",
    "our calculation displays very small outflow regions for input parameters corresponding to the ssd model , and for these solutions the inflow region has similar structure with the one - dimensional ssd model .",
    "however the accretion rate inside the disk may not be conserved along the radius due to mass lost via wind . for the adaf and the slim disk cases",
    ", our result displays an outflow region too large to be neglected , and we think it s necessary to consider the explicit structure in the @xmath1 or @xmath4 direction to get more realistic results than the traditional analytical models .",
    "it was proposed in several works ( gu & lu , 2007 ; jiao et al .",
    "2009 ) that the slim disk model has an upper limit of accretion rates , above which outflows seem to be inevitable . later in another paper ( jiao & lu 2009 ) , one - dimensional steady transonic global solutions for slim disks with presumed amount of outflows were calculated , and in this case the proposed upper limit of accretion rates for slim disks can be exceeded . another paper written by takeuchi et al .",
    "( 2009 ) used the outflow data from two - dimensional radiation - hydrodynamic ( rhd ) simulations to construct an one - dimensional steady solution , and the result shows that the emergent spectra do not sensitively depend on the amount of mass outflow .",
    "however , these models are still one - dimensional models and they only incorporated the mass loss effect of outflow into their models , so the results still remain debatable .",
    "we think that two - dimensional solutions considering the hydrodynamical processes and radiative transfer along both the radial and the @xmath1 direction are required to examine the topic , which we are planning to do in our future work .",
    "we also investigated the dependence of the accretion flow structure on different input parameters respectively . @xmath3 and @xmath55 ( consequently @xmath43 ) both have some transition values as discussed in  3.2.3 and  3.2.4 , at which the outflow region reaches a maximum size .",
    "generally when @xmath168 and @xmath169 ( for intrinsic @xmath89 ) , the accretion flow will have a large outflow region and strong outflow , as the aforementioned solutions corresponding to the slim disk model .",
    "however , in what conditions the transition happens depends on other input parameters and it wo nt happen in case of large @xmath2 due to the existence of the critical value @xmath131 .",
    "solutions with @xmath34 do nt contain outflow and they correspond to the solutions in ny95 , which is only applicable to adafs .",
    "solutions with @xmath82 have the aforementioned three - region ( or two - region for @xmath132 ) structure .",
    "solutions with @xmath83 are not likely to happen in real cases .    finally , we would like to mention some caveats in our work .",
    "the solutions obtained in this paper are steady solutions , and thus it is not guaranteed that they are stable solutions .",
    "these solutions do not cover the whole space , so for the unresolved region near the axis , we know nothing about the detailed structure other than that it contains the material blowing out of the upper boundary in the form of wind .",
    "our work is based on the simple @xmath170 prescription of viscosity , which is not bad according to recent mhd simulation works(hirose et al .",
    "2009 ; ohsuga et al .",
    "2009 ) , especially when the flow is steady . however , it may be necessary to consider other components of the viscous stress tensor for solutions with large @xmath9 .",
    "we also used the advective factor @xmath3 to simplify the energy equation , and assumed @xmath3 to be a constant .",
    "realistically @xmath3 should vary with both @xmath1 and @xmath31 , which could be improved by considering the details of radiative transfer .",
    "we used newtonian gravitational potential in our work , and it needs to be corrected when applied to study the structure close to the innermost stable circular orbit . in our calculation",
    "we did nt consider the effects of convection ( e.g. stone et al .",
    "1999 ; igumenshchev & abramowicz 2000 ; yuan & bu 2010 ) or magnetic field ( e.g. blandford & payne 1982 ; naso & miller 2010 ) , which may be important in studying the accretion flow and the generation of outflows . finally , it is necessary to abandon the self - similar assumptions if we want to investigate the disk and outflow structure more quantitatively and precisely .",
    "these caveats will be improved in our future work .",
