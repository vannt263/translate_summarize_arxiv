    "radio interferometric imaging studies of h@xmath5o maser emission have directly demonstrated that , in at least a few cases , type-2 active galactic nuclei ( agns ) contain thin , nearly edge - on , warped accretion disks , with large columns of molecular gas inside @xmath10  pc . examples include ngc  4258 ( miyoshi et al .",
    "1995 ) , ngc  1068 @xcite , and the circinus galaxy @xcite . in these systems , the maser emission is likely stimulated by irradiation and heating of relatively cold gas by hard x - rays ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "because the structure of the maser emission can be readily resolved in velocity and angle , it has been possible to use it to map dense ( @xmath11 @xmath12 ) , warm ( @xmath13k ) accretion - disk gas @xcite .",
    "the h@xmath5o source in the low luminosity ( @xmath14 ) agn of ngc4258 ( m106 ) is remarkable because the disk is extremely well described by a relatively simple dynamical model @xcite .",
    "the maser emission has been mapped from radii of 0.14pc to 0.28pc around a @xmath15m@xmath16 central mass .",
    "maser positions , line - of - sight velocities and accelerations , and proper motions are all measurable , and they fit a simple geometrically thin , slightly warped , keplerian disk model to high accuracy @xcite .",
    "the knowledge of these quantities presents strong constraints for hard x - ray studies aimed at understanding processes related to the central engine : emission mechanisms and surrounding disk structure .",
    "the structure and energetics of type-2 agns , in fact , are still not well understood mainly because x - ray spectra are complex superpositions of components due to several processes ( compact and extended emission , absorption , scattering , and reflection with different ionization states ) and most astronomical wavebands currently can not resolve structures @xmath17  pc in size .",
    "many agn models postulate that all agn are intrinsically the same and orientation plus obscuration effects regulate their classification ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , the actual nature of the obscuring material is still very much under debate , and several locations and structures have been proposed .",
    "these include a geometrically thick structure , galactic dust @xcite , a geometrically thin absorber confined to radii comparable to the broad - line regions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or an outflow ( elvis  et al .  2000 ) .    in the case of 258",
    "the explanation for the unusually low luminosity is also an unsettled question : is it the result of a low accretion rate or radiatively inefficient accretion ?",
    "@xcite suggested the former .",
    "other authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have modeled the global spectral energy distribution of 258  with advection - dominated , radiatively inefficient accretion flows ( adaf ) . @xcite",
    "have suggested an alternative model in which outflow from the adaf powers the jet in 258 , the emission from which dominates the continuum from radio to x - ray wavebands . in each case",
    "the hard x - ray continuum is expected to arise from a different location ( a corona above the disk , hot plasma centered on the central engine , or the base of a jet ) .    while early soft ( @xmath18 kev ) x - ray observations detected emission from 258  ( fabbiano , kim , & trinchieri 1992 ; pietsch  et al .",
    "1994 ) , only  x - ray observations in the hard band ( 210  kev ) allowed @xcite to model for the first time the spectrum of the central x - ray source of 258  as an absorbed power law , weak fe k@xmath8 line , and optically thin soft thermal component .",
    "@xcite report on later  observations and temporal variability on time scales of years in the absorbing column ( 30% ) and in the 510  kev flux ( a factor of two ) .",
    "observations with the @xmath19-sax pds detected an extension of the power - law component to 70  kev with no significant reflection component : 258  is one of the only five seyfert 2 galaxies , among a total of 31 , for which model fits to the  data are not improved by the addition of a reflection component ( risaliti 2002 ) ;   mecs observations detected a factor of two variations in count rate ( 310  kev ) on time scales @xmath20  ks @xcite , though @xcite did not report variability over 200  ks for a later epoch .",
    "observations of ngc  4258 with  and  have been the first to separate the central compact emission component from the bulk of the extended soft emission that originates in well - known nonstellar spiral arms on kpc scales ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the first  and  spectra are in agreement with  and  spectra , except that fe k@xmath8 emission is not detected , which has raised doubts about the original detections .",
    "nonetheless , the line emission is presumed to be closely associated with the central engine , and non - detection may be indicative of variability in line equivalent width of a factor of two on time scales of 12 years .",
    "time variability and narrow line - width would argue in favor of an association between the line emission and accretion - disk material @xcite at radii between @xmath21 and @xmath22  pc , either by reflection of light from a variable central source or by variation in disk structure @xcite .",
    "variability on shorter time scales ( @xmath23  ks ) has been claimed by @xcite in the possible detection of weak absorption features at 6.4 and 6.9  kev , which presumably would be caused by disk or outflow material at radii @xmath24  pc .",
    "we report in this paper the monitoring of ngc  4258 at five epochs with  ( including the epoch reported by pietsch & read 2002 ) and four epochs with @xcite that are publically available . in total , the and  monitoring covers 2.2 years , 2000.2 to 2002.4 .",
    "the primary goal of the program was characterization of time variability in the absorbing column that might be related to substructure of the accretion disk traced by maser emission .",
    "we present a time series of spectral models for ngc  4258 , where we have minimized sources of systematic uncertainty by reprocessing and reanalyzing all existing   and  datasets using a consistent set of models and techniques , as well as the most recent calibration databases .",
    "we describe the  and  datasets , their calibration , and the spectral fitting in section  2 .",
    "we discuss our findings in section  3 .",
    "ut dates are used through this paper .",
    "ngc  4258 was observed four times from 2001 may to 2002 may as part of an  go program .",
    "table 1 lists the observation log for the epic instrument including the useful exposure times before and after filtering for high background times following the procedure outlined below . for completeness and consistency in analysis",
    ", we have included the first  observation of 258 , obtained in 2000 december @xcite .",
    "all epic pn and mos observations were taken in prime full window mode with a medium filter .",
    "the entire data analysis was accomplished with a combination of tasks in the  and  data analysis software systems ( science analysis software - sas - versions 20030110_1802/20040318_1831 and  interactive analysis of observations - ciao - versions 3.0.1/3.0.2 ) .",
    "we generated calibrated epic event files using the _ epproc _ and _ emproc _ routines and filtered the final event list to include only `` good '' events , with patterns 04 ( singles and doubles ) for the pn camera and 012 for the mos cameras .",
    "we also rejected bad times due to high background flares ( figure  [ f : lightcurve0 ] ) through a comparison of the source and background light curves for each observation .",
    "ratios of source and background count rates were calculated for each 100  s time - bin , and we eliminated all time intervals with source - to - background count ratios lower than 5 .",
    "useful integration times were reduced as shown in table 1 .",
    "the observation most affected by overall high background levels as well as strong flares was on 2001 dec .",
    "17 ( figure  [ f : lightcurve0 ] ) .",
    "we compared the expected and observed distributions of event grades calculated with the sas routine _",
    "epatplot _ to quantify the effects of event pile - up , which were not detectable .",
    "spectra were extracted using the sas routine _",
    "especget _ excluding events near the edge of the ccds and near bad pixels which may have incorrect energies .",
    "we chose a circular source extraction region of 300 pixel radius ( or 15 ) which covers about 80% of the psf and a background extraction region of 1200 pixel radius ( 60 ) lying @xmath25  from the source on the same chip as the source region .",
    "we binned the spectral pulse - invariant ( pi ) channels by a factor of 10 in all spectra to obtain uniform binning while increasing the statistics in each individual bin ( figures  26 ) .",
    "the most recent response matrices ( version of 2003 - 01 - 29 ) for each instrument observing mode and observation date were obtained from the  calibration archive and used in the spectral fitting . the same source and background extraction regions were used for deriving the light curves ( figure 1 ) for the pn and mos cameras .",
    "all light curves were extracted over the entire energy range ( nominally 0.215 kev ) taking into account an average dead - time correction calculated from the _ livetime _ and _ ontime _ keywords recorded in the data .",
    "average count rates for all observations are listed in table 1 .",
    "we note in passing that we also checked the  rgs spectra which , however , provided no additional constraints to the spectral modeling because of the extremely poor signal - to - noise ratio in the covered waveband ( @xmath18 kev ) .",
    "the  acis - s camera observed 258  four times from 2000 march to 2001 may ( table 2 ) with useful exposure times ranging from @xmath26 to @xmath27 ks , as described by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the 2000 april 17 ( 13  ks ) and 2001 may 29 ( 20  ks ) observations were optimized to study the faint `` anomalous arms '' of 258 . as a result , both suffer from significant photon pile - up in the nuclear region , of order 2030% .",
    "detailed modeling was needed to account for this effect when fitting spectra ( see @xmath28 ) .",
    "we re - analyzed all  data to ensure that the most recent calibrations were used and that the analysis techniques were consistent with those used for the  data .",
    "we reprocessed the data using the  calibration database ( caldb ) versions 2.23 and 2.26 and ciao software version 3.0.1 and 3.0.2 . in the data preparation phase we checked for background flares ( none present in any of the data sets ) and defined extraction regions : a 2  radius source region on the nucleus and a 10radius background region about 2  from the nucleus .",
    "responses were derived from the latest calibration data available in caldb 2.26 and included the effects due to a reduction of the low - energy quantum efficiency of the acis instrument . as in the analysis ,",
    "extracted spectra were binned by a factor of 10 in spectral pi channels ( figures  7 , 8 , 11 , 12 ) . in some cases we verified the results by also binning to @xmath29 counts per bin for comparison .",
    "we used version 3.0.2 of _ sherpa _ ( freeman , doe , & siemiginowska 2001 ) to fit models to our spectra iteratively , widening the energy interval being fit and adding model components as required to improve the significance of the spectral fit ( figures 28 , 11 , 12 ) .    for the  data we started by fitting the 210 kev energy range with a simple power - law model , absorbed by both intrinsic absorption and galactic absorption ( @xmath30 ) , the latter fixed at the value @xmath31 @xmath1 ( murphy et al .",
    "we verified that the background is negligible for all observations , so we neither subtracted it nor modeled it during the spectral fitting .",
    "we then extended the energy range to 0.3  kev , adding a thermal plasma component ( the `` mekal '' model : mewe , gronenschild , & vad den oord 1985 ; mewe , lemen , & van den oord 1986 ; kaastra 1992 ; liedahl , osterheld , & goldstein 1995 ) with elemental abundances as a fixed fraction of the cosmic values ( anders & grevess 1989 ) , and a soft power - law component , both absorbed by the galactic @xmath30 .",
    "the best - fit values for all the free parameters in the models are listed in table 2 , together with model - derived fluxes and luminosities in various energy ranges , assuming a distance of 7.2 mpc ( herrnstein et al .",
    "1999 ) so 1  = 35 pc .    in order to assess the quality of the fit we used the @xmath32 statistic proposed by kearns ,",
    "primini , & alexander ( 1995 ) and implemented in _ sherpa _",
    "( so - called `` chi primini '' statistic ) which is appropriate for non - background - subtracted data .",
    "this statistic can be used even when the number of counts in each bin is small ( @xmath33 ) and it is not biased ( see , e.g. , freeman 2001 ) .",
    "spectral fits obtained with a bremsstrahlung component instead of a soft power - law component work equally well at soft energies and neither has a significant influence on the best - fit parameters for the direct agn component ( both in term of slope and absorption ) .",
    "these soft components may reflect some integrated galactic contribution , such as from the x - ray binary population .",
    "the thermal plasma component is needed to account for the strong iron l complex detected at @xmath22 kev .    for the  observations the background was also negligible , so we neither subtracted it nor modeled it .",
    "however , in any case , we note that background subtraction is not recommended ( davis 2001 ) for data to which pile - up models will be applied .",
    "we again started the analysis by fitting a simple absorbed power - law model in the 210 kev energy range .",
    "we then added two model components to extend the fit to 0.5 kev .",
    "finally , for the two longest  observations , we added a pile - up model to the fit ( see below ) .",
    "the `` chi primini '' statistic was used for the two shortest  observations , while the `` chi dvar '' statistic ( a @xmath32 statistic with variance computed from the observed counts data ) was preferred for the two longest piled - up  observations for computer efficiency reasons .",
    "inspection of the residuals to the best fits to  and  data did not reveal the presence of statistically significant emission or absorption lines in any of the spectra . to calculate upper limits to fe k@xmath8 emission line equivalent widths , we added a gaussian component to the 210 kev power - law model ( table  2 ) , fixing the line energy ( @xmath34 ) at 6.4  kev and obtaining upper limits to the equivalent widths ( @xmath35 ) using the estimated upper bound of the uncertainty in line normalization ( 90% confidence ) . in one case ( the 2001 june 17  observation )",
    "a line can be fit , if @xmath34 is allowed to vary ( table 2 ) ; however , the fit is only improved at @xmath36 level by the addition of the gaussian model component ( reduced @xmath32=1.05 for 159 degrees of freedom without a line , reduced @xmath32=1.02 for 156 degrees of freedom with a line ) , which we therefore do not classify as a detection .",
    "as noted earlier , two of the  observations ( on 2000 april 17 and 2001 may 28 ) were strongly affected by photon pile - up .",
    "we accounted for this at the spectral fitting level by including the model by davis ( 2001 ) , as implemented in _",
    "sherpa _ , in our overall spectral fit . following the instructions for using the model for  data",
    "we    \\(i ) re - included all events that the automated pipeline classifies as `` afterglow '' events before performing the spectral extraction ,    \\(ii ) verified the constancy of the source during the observation ,    \\(iii ) extracted the spectra from a 2  radius source region around the nucleus , and    \\(iv ) did not subtract the background in the fitting process .",
    "the davis ( 2001 ) pile - up model is described by various parameters , two of which are generally the most crucial : @xmath8 ( which represents the probability of getting a `` good '' event grade  essentially a non - background event  when two photons pile together ) , and @xmath37 ( the fraction of flux falling into the pile - up region ) . to investigate systematic errors that may result from the details of how pile - up is modeled",
    ", we processed each pile - up epoch in three ways : with @xmath8 and @xmath37 free to vary , @xmath8 free and @xmath37 fixed , and @xmath8 and @xmath37 both fixed .",
    "the results of the fits are reported in table 3 .",
    "for both epochs the three pile - up corrected models are statistically consistent within the 90% errors and the global pile - up fraction ( i.e. the estimated percentage of observed counts containing two or more photons piled together ) is not significantly affected by the choice of @xmath8 and @xmath37 parameters . however , we note a systematic bias in parameters when either @xmath8 or @xmath37 are held fixed ( e.g. , we obtain a steeper photon index , @xmath38 ) .",
    "we also note better agreement with the non - piled - up  epochs , and lower reduced @xmath32 , when @xmath8 and @xmath37 are allowed to vary during the fit . for this reason we adopt `` unfrozen '' models and from a comparison of parameters listed in table  2",
    "suggest that the systematic uncertainties in @xmath39 , @xmath38 , and @xmath30 are on the order of 20% , 20% , and 10% .",
    "( hard absorbed flux is not significantly affected . )",
    "differences between our best - fit parameters and those of @xcite are probably in part related to the treatment of pile - up .      in table  2",
    "we report a cumulative record of spectral parameters from the literature and obtained by us in processing new and archival  and  datasets .",
    "care in comparison of results obtained with different instruments is warranted because of different angular and energy resolutions , energy coverage , and cross - calibration effects ( see , e.g. , marshall  et al .",
    "2001 on -  cross - calibration ) .",
    "for example , analysis of  data ( extraction radius 3  in the 210 kev band ) has delivered the steepest @xmath38 , and  was effectively the only mission sensitive to emission above @xmath23  kev .",
    "analyses of  data consistently provide the shallow estimates of @xmath38 and low estimates of @xmath40 ( for epochs free of pile - up and epochs where pile - up parameters are free to vary ; see , e.g. , figure  [ f : confidence ] ) .",
    "this may in part be a consequence of angular resolution  in other words , a small extraction radius ( 2  or @xmath41  pc ) better isolates the central engine from surrounding soft nuclear emission .",
    "(  supports the next smallest extraction radius , 15  or @xmath42  pc . ) on the other hand , hard and soft components can be disentangled in analysis of somewhat lower angular resolution data ( e.g. , ) if the source model is accurate . in that case",
    ", the limited effective collecting area of  above @xmath43  kev may be a more significant factor , as it reduces constraints on the hard portion of the spectrum and increases correlations between fit parameters ( such as @xmath40 and @xmath38 ) .",
    "in contrast ,  count rates are higher , provide better constraint on the hard portion of the spectrum , and probably provide more robust parameter estimates ( for this galaxy ) .",
    "we have added four new epochs to the monitoring record of hard x - ray emission from 258 which now extends to 9 years .",
    "the five  observations by themselves provide a much needed time - series of 0.310  kev spectra with high count rate and spectral resolutions that are unaffected by serious instrumental systematics , such as pile - up . the time separations between epochs span 0.12 to 1.5 years . taken together , the time series of  and  epochs spans 2.2 years with a minimum separation of 0.05 years ( 3 weeks ) .",
    "the source models fit to the  data are on average consistent with the range of models fit to data from other satellites .",
    "for the five  epochs , we obtain an absorbing column @xmath44@xmath45  @xmath1 , absorption - corrected luminosity @xmath46@xmath47  ergs s@xmath48 ( 210  kev ) or @xmath49@xmath50  ergs s@xmath48 ( 510  kev ) , photon index @xmath511.7 , and thermal plasma temperature @xmath520.6  kev ( table  2 ) .",
    "the characteristics of the soft emission component do not in general display substantial range , and the  results are statistically consistent with estimates reported elsewhere .",
    "count rates and estimates of absorbed flux ( @xmath53 ) obtained just with  ( 210  kev and 510  kev ) demonstrate intensity variations of 1030% on time scales as short as six months ( figures  [ f : lightcurve0 ] , [ f : trends ] ; table  2 ) .",
    "however , comparing  and  data that are unaffected by pile - up , we observe a @xmath54 decrease in hard ( 510  kev ) absorbed flux between epochs separated by 19  days ( 2001 may 29 and 2001 jun 17 ) .",
    "count rates estimated by @xcite also appear to indicate variation between two epochs separated by @xmath10  month ( 2000 march 8 and 2000 april 17 ) . however ,",
    "interpretation of this comparison requires caution because of systematic uncertainty associated with pile - up modeling applied to the later epoch ( see @xmath28 ) .",
    "evidence of more rapid variability has been reported , but the contributions of systematics can be difficult to assess , such as pile - up ( in  data ) , background variability , or the presence of other variable sources in the extraction region .",
    "for example , @xcite report  light - curve variations of 1020% on time scales of @xmath10 hour and 100% on time scales on the order of half a day , but without background subtraction and for an extraction region of 3  ( which includes , for example , the soft companion discovered by  @xmath55  to the southwest of the nucleus ; pietsch & read 2002 ) . in contrast , on time scales of @xmath56  hours , we observe with  no variability appearing in background - subtracted light curves for both the pn and mos instruments ( figure  [ f : lightcurve0 ] ) .",
    "similarly , @xcite observe no variability with  on scales up to @xmath57  days .",
    "we also detect variability in unabsorbed luminosity ( @xmath58 ) with  ( figure  [ f : trends ] ) . in the @xmath10  year prior to the last epoch , @xmath58 ( 210  kev ) dropped @xmath59 to @xmath60  erg s@xmath48 , possibly as part of a long - term decline by approximately a factor of two from the peak detected by  on 2000 march 8 .",
    "this large variation is comparable in magnitude to what has been seen for , , and early  epochs ( figure  [ f : trends ] ) , when @xmath58(210  kev ) varied by factors of @xmath61 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "we exclude the possibility that cross - correlation in the modeling causes these variations , referring to figure  [ f : trends ] and the absence of any correlation between estimates of @xmath58 and @xmath40 .",
    "( we recall that @xmath40 and @xmath62 appear to be somewhat correlated among models for  data ( see @xmath63 ) , but emphasize that over a wide range , variations in @xmath58 do not appear to be correlated with changes in either @xmath40 or @xmath62 . )",
    "although there is no one - to - one correspondence , we note that two of the lowest estimates of @xmath58 are associated with the two largest estimates of @xmath40 . within the @xmath64  months",
    "prior to the last  epoch , @xmath40 increased @xmath65 , returning to a high level [ ( @xmath66  @xmath1 ] not reported since the first  observations in 1993 . in both cases , @xmath58(510  kev ) is @xmath68  ergs  s@xmath48 .",
    "we speculate that reductions in @xmath58 might affect the ionization state of the absorber , resulting in increased columns in some cases , though we acknowledge that 258  is a weak source , and it is difficult to establish a connection .",
    "if true , then a change in ionization would suggest that the absorber is not entirely neutral .",
    "258  is an unusual target to model because the central mass , geometry , and dynamics of surrounding dense material are accurately known from modeling of radio interferometry data of the maser emission .",
    "the best - fit warped disk model , which is derived from observed maser positions and doppler velocities , is highly inclined . in particular , the warp of the disk brings it across the line of sight to the dynamical center at a radius of 0.29 pc , where its angle to the line of sight is about @xmath69 , just beyond the outer limit of the known maser emission @xcite , and thus placing high - density gas ( @xmath70  @xmath12 ; elitzur 1992 ) between us and the central engine .    to interpret the time variability in the absorption column density",
    ", we assume that inhomogeneities in the disk move across our line of sight as the disk rotates and that these are responsible for observed changes in absorption .",
    "the discussion that follows depends rather critically on the view that the maser emission is a good tracer of the disk  i.e. , that its emission defines the mid - plane of the disk , and that the disk changes from molecular to atomic beyond a radius of about 0.28 pc , as described by @xcite . for these assumptions ,",
    "the mass accretion rate is about @xmath71 solar masses per year .",
    "we estimate the physical size of the inhomogeneities in the disk from the variability time scale of the absorption column density . the rotation speed of the disk at a radius of 0.29 pc is about @xmath72  760 km  s@xmath48 for a central mass of 3.9 @xmath73  m@xmath16 .",
    "hence the length scale ( @xmath74 ) associated with the observed time - variability scale ( @xmath75 ) of 5 months is @xmath76 , or about @xmath77 cm . for the standard thin accretion disk ( e.g. , frank , king , & raine 1992 ) ,",
    "the scale height ( h ) obeys the relation @xmath78 .",
    "if the gas is atomic at the line - of - sight crossing radius , then the temperature is expected to be about 8000  k and @xmath79 km  s@xmath48 , according to the model of @xcite .",
    "hence , h = @xmath80 cm and @xmath81 . if the gas at the crossing radius were molecular , and at the preferred maser temperature of about 800  k , the sound speed would be about 2.3 km  s@xmath48 , and the scale height would then be about @xmath82 cm , close to @xmath74 .",
    "however , if the gas were atomic , then the mass accretion rate , which scales as @xmath83 , would have to be about @xmath84 m@xmath85 .",
    "this would move the atomic transition radius into the maser region , and also make the density at the inner radius of maser emission unacceptably low .",
    "we note that the time scale of bright maser flares is about 2 months @xcite . at the radius of the flare maser , 0.17 pc ,",
    "the rotation speed is about 970 km  s@xmath48 , the scale for density fluctuations is @xmath86 cm , and the scale height is @xmath87  cm .",
    "hence , here also the turbulence scale length is somewhat smaller than the local scale height .",
    "advective accretion models have been proposed for 258  ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) which require much larger accretion rates and much thicker disks , and for which the masers are relegated to a thin surface skin .",
    "the difficulty with these models is the much more massive disk required .",
    "the gross model geometry of the disk would not change , still crossing the line of sight to the center at the same radius .",
    "however , the column density would be much greater at the crossing radius than determined by the x - ray observations .",
    "three other reservoirs for absorbing gas are also conceivable : an edge - on molecular torus at much larger radii than the `` maser disk '' ( as is often assumed in the agn unification paradigm ) , an outflow ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and an extension of the disk to much smaller radii .",
    "we argue against the presence of a massive torus because the co distribution in 258  is not centrally peaked ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "we argue against outflow because 258is a low - luminosity agn and the possibility of it driving a massive outflow seems remote .",
    "in addition , radio and optical imaging show a well - collimated flow @xcite that lies well away from the line of sight to the central engine .",
    "the possibility of absorption arising in a disk - like structure at small radii ( @xmath88  pc ) exists , but is unlikely given the three - dimensional geometry of the maser disk .",
    "we note that the disk inclination is @xmath89 at a radius of 0.14  pc . for an @xmath90 warping mode ,",
    "the inclination is more face - on at smaller radii ( down to @xmath91 ) .",
    "hence , disk material at small radii can not lie along the line of sight to the central engine unless the disk is significantly thickened ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "if the absorbing material is neutral and cold , this raises the question of what process provides vertical support .",
    "the problem of support is mitigated if the disk is very hot , but the x - ray spectrum of 258  does not show signs of very hot gas .",
    "we do not detect fe k@xmath8 line emission in any of the  epochs or in any of the  epochs . the observation on 2001",
    "may 6 puts a stringent 90% upper limit to the equivalent width of @xmath93 ev . in light of the last detection of the line with  at epoch 1999",
    "may 15 ( table  2 ) , @xcite and @xcite concluded the line is variable , fading on a time scale of @xmath94 months . the apparent disappearance , which now extends through may 2002 , is difficult to explain , assuming the earlier detections with  ( at multiple epochs ) were robust .",
    "the accretion disk is the most prominent reservoir of cold material known in close proximity to the central engine . assuming that the line originates in the disk , its weakness is consistent with the inferred relatively low column density of the disk ( @xmath95  @xmath1 ) , which enables transmission of incident hard x - rays ( i.e. , 6.4  kev ) virtually unattenuated . as a result",
    ", reflection should be negligible ( see also fiore et al .",
    "2001 ) , and @xcite have argued that at such low column densities , equivalent widths for line fluorescence should be @xmath96  ev .",
    "the weakness of the line is also consistent with the disk subtending a small solid angle ( @xmath97 ) as seen from the source of hard x - ray continuum near the disk center .",
    "this would be the case if 258  were to host an advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) .",
    "@xcite measured the angular structure of radio continuum emission in the vicinity of the disk center , and showed that any adaf must be compact , @xmath98 schwarzschild radii .",
    "no cold material would extend toward the center , and as a result the disk solid angle would be small .",
    "although the presence of an adaf could explain the weakness of fe line emission , our earlier argument that a large mass accretion rate and thick disk are inconsistent with the observed x - ray absorbing column remains valid .",
    "in addition , we note that @xcite suggest that adafs should be accompanied by massive winds ( thus depleting the accretion flow ) , and @xcite argue that such winds are inconsistent with the broadband spectral energy distribution of 258 . in place of an adaf as the source of hard x - ray continuum emission , a disk corona remains a possibility .",
    "although in this case the disk could extend inward far enough that it would subtend a large solid angle ( @xmath99 ) , the relative ( optical ) thinness of the disk alone could explain the weakness of any fe k@xmath8 emission .",
    "it also remains possible that the line emission arises from scattering , fluorescence , or reflection by material that lies away from the disk , but apart from the well - collimated radio synchrotron jet @xcite , none is known .",
    "past time variability of the line is more difficult to explain : light travel time arguments applied to the fading suggest that the line - emitting region is @xmath100  pc in size , corresponding to the approximate outer diameter of the maser disk .",
    "the changes in the line may be the result of changes in the disk across its surface area or changes in the central illumination .",
    "however , if both x - ray and radio ( maser ) line emission are the result of irradiation of the disk surface , then it is notable that the brightness and velocity extent of h@xmath5o maser emission have not changed substantially since monitoring began in 1992 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this would suggest that the disk ( at 0.140.28  pc radii ) and its source of illumination have remained relatively unchanged over the period that the fe line has faded .",
    "however , considering the fact that both maser emission and fe line emission may be influenced by other effects ( e.g. , propagation along the disk , gas heating and cooling rates ) , coordinated   x - ray and radio monitoring over time scales of @xmath101  day to @xmath43  months is needed to more firmly detect the line and to test proposed emission and variability mechanisms .",
    "time - variable fe line absorption ( at 6.4 and 6.9 kev ) has been reported from a study of one ( 2000 april 28 ) of the observations by young & wilson ( 2004 ) . in our analysis",
    "we find no evidence of absorption lines , neither in the nor in the  spectra . because our findings differ from what was previously reported , we tested our results by retracing , to the best of our knowledge , these authors data - analysis steps .",
    "we repeated the analysis using several binning schemes for the extracted spectra ( including a minimum of 15 counts per bin as used by the previous authors ) , we inspected the data split in two equal time intervals , and we applied pile - up models with various choices of parameters .",
    "figures 8 to 10 illustrate our results : no significant absorption feature can be inferred from our data and best - fit models .",
    "we can only speculate about possible origins for the discrepancy : differences in calibration , or slight differences in the data preparation , treatment of the background , or the modeling of pile - up .",
    "we note that the 2000 april 28 epoch is the one most affected by photon pile - up at a level of @xmath102 ( see table 3 and  2.3.1 ) .",
    "in this paper we have analyzed x - ray ( 0.310  kev ) observations of 258   obtained with the  and  observatories over @xmath57 years . including earlier observations by  and , we present for the first time a new nine - year time - series of models fit to the x - ray data from 258 .",
    "\\(1 ) the  and  spectra of 258  data are well fit by a model consisting of several components : a partially absorbed , hard ( @xmath103 kev ) power law , a soft thermal plasma , and a soft power law .",
    "the soft emission , some of which arises @xmath104  pc from the central engine , does not vary appreciably from observation to observation .",
    "\\(2 ) from  data , which are free of systematics such as pile - up , we observe long - term time variability in the source count rate and absorbed flux over time scales of @xmath43 months .",
    "no evidence for variability , however , is detected within our individual @xmath56  hour integrations .",
    "\\(4 ) changes in @xmath40 and @xmath53 are not correlated , which indicates intrinsic variability of the central engine that is in one case 30% over 19  days ( 510  kev ) .",
    "we note that two of the largest estimates of unabsorbed luminosity are associated with the lowest estimates of @xmath40 , and we speculate that reductions in @xmath58 might affect the ionization state of the absorber .",
    "\\(5 ) the geometry and orientation of the accretion disk in 258  is well known from interferometric mapping of maser emission that arises in the accretion disk .",
    "we infer that the disk is somewhat inhomogeneous , based on observed time variability in @xmath40 and an assumption that the absorbing gas lies in the disk . using the rotation curve of the disk",
    ", we estimate that the absorbing gas may lie at the same radius as where the disk is ( independently ) believed to cross our line of sight to the central engine ( because the disk is warped ) and that the inhomogeneities are @xmath6  cm in size .",
    "\\(6 ) we do not detect fe k@xmath8 line emission in any of the   or  epochs , thus extending the `` disappearance '' of the line from the last   detection in 1999 may to 2002 may .",
    "the inferred line emission region is comparable in size to the maser disk .",
    "if the line arises from the disk ( e.g. , by fluorescence ) , then it is difficult to understand the variability because the maser emission has not changed substantially .",
    "our inference that the accretion disk is inhomogeneous at radii of @xmath106  pc raises the question of what mechanism is responsible .",
    "assessment of the toomre q - parameter at this radius suggests that self - gravity is unimportant except at the highest possible densities supportive of maser action ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "magnetic fields may play a role in confining inhomogeneities , but the field strength and configuration are not known @xcite .",
    "while the confinement mechanism is not determined , we note that detection of inhomogeneities in the disk empirically supports techniques to estimate a distance to 258  from maser proper motions and centripetal accelerations , because these rely on the apparent maser dynamics tracking the rotation of disk material ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
