    "the idea that an excitonic phase appears  under certain circumstances  at the semiconductor - semimetal transition dates back about half a century  @xcite",
    ". the formation of excitons is driven by the coulomb attraction between conduction - band electrons and valence - band holes . provided a large enough number of sufficiently long - lived excitons",
    "was created , a subsequent spontaneous condensation of these composite bose quasiparticles may set in .",
    "the excitonic instability is expected to happen , when semimetals with very small band overlap or semiconductors with very small band gap are cooled to extremely low temperatures  @xcite .",
    "the excitonic condensate typifies a macroscopic phase - coherent , insulating state , which separates the semimetal from the semiconductor ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : pd ] ) .",
    "surprisingly , to date , there is no free of doubt realization of the excitonic insulator ( ei ) state in nature .",
    "nowadays experiments report data , however , which strongly support the theoretical predictions of the ei phase . along this line",
    ", experiments on coupled quantum - well structures , e.g. , have shown unusual properties which were inferred as indications of excitonic condensation  @xcite . temperature dependent angle - resolved photoelectron spectroscopy ( arpes ) on @xmath2@xmath3 transition - metal dichalcogenides are in favor of the ei scenario as driving force for the observed charge - density - wave transition  @xcite .",
    "x - ray photoemission spectroscopy and arpes on quasi one - dimensional ( 1d ) @xmath4 reveal that the ground state can be viewed as ei state between the ni @xmath5se @xmath6 hole and the ta @xmath7 electron  @xcite .",
    "further real - system candidates for the ei state are pressure - sensitive rare - earth chalcogenides , such as mixed - valence @xmath8 . for this compounds electrical and thermal ( transport ) measurements",
    "indicate exciton condensation , at temperatures below 20  k in the pressure range between 5 and 11 kbar  @xcite .    also from the theoretical side the existence of the ei is still controversial .",
    "most of the early mean - field approaches work with an effective - mass mott - wannier - type exciton model and exploit the analogy to the bcs theory of superconductivity  @xcite ( for a more recent calculation of the phase diagram see refs .  ) . here",
    "the major problem is that the excitonic phases ( excitonic gas , ei ) turn out to be unstable against a metallic electron - hole liquid  @xcite . at present , falicov - kimball - type models seem to be the most promising candidates for realizing collective exciton phases .",
    "this particularly holds for the extended falicov - kimball model ( efkm ) , which includes a direct @xmath0-@xmath0 electron hopping term , that  having again the tm[se , te ] system in mind  is certainly more realistic than entirely localized @xmath0 electrons . by means of unbiased constrained path",
    "monte carlo ( cpmc ) simulations the efkm has been proven to exhibit critical excitonic correlations ( an ei ground state ) in case of 1d ( 2d )  @xcite .",
    "subsequent hartree - fock calculations yield the ground - state phase diagram of the 2d efkm in excellent agreement with the cpmc data  @xcite , supporting the applicability of such mean - field approaches also in the 3d situation  @xcite . for the 3d efkm ,",
    "the existence of the ei phase was corroborated by more sophisticated slave - boson approaches  @xcite .",
    "assuming that @xmath0-@xmath1 electron coherence may lead to an ei phase in the efkm , the properties of the excitonic state should be explored in more detail . in this regard , the anticipated ` bcs - bec crossover ' scenario  @xcite ,",
    "connecting the physics of bcs superconductivity with that of bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) , is of vital importance . calculating the frenkel - type exciton propagator within a random phase approximation scheme",
    ", the existence of excitonic bound - states has been established for the efkm also above @xmath9 , on the semiconductor side of the semiconductor - semimetal transition  @xcite .",
    "no bound - states were found on the semi - metallic side .",
    "accordingly the condensation process should differ by its nature : while ` exciton ' formation and condensation simultaneously take place on the semi - metallic ( bcs ) side , preformed excitons will condense on the semiconducting ( bec ) side as the temperature is lowered ( cf .",
    "[ fig : pd ] ) .",
    "looking at the ei order parameter @xmath10 only , it seems difficult to examine the bcs - bec crossover .",
    "the gap equation for @xmath10 will of course not discriminate between both regimes .",
    "photoemission spectroscopy , on the other hand , will directly probe the elementary excitations and energy dispersion and therefore provides extremely useful information about the bcs - bec crossover .",
    "this has been shown quite recently in the context of ultracold ( atomic ) fermi gases  @xcite . in this work",
    ", we will follow this perspective and examine the ei phase in terms of the efkm particularly with regard to a bcs - bec crossover . to this end",
    ", we analyze the equilibrium and spectral properties of the model at zero temperature , using the so - called projective renormalization method ( prm )  @xcite .",
    "this technique has already been successively applied to a great variety of many - body problems  @xcite . here",
    "we calculate and discuss the photoemission spectra of the efkm in order to probe the signatures of the excitonic condensate . the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  ii introduces the efkm .",
    "the theoretical approach is outlined in sec .",
    "iii , where the general concept of the prm is resumed in sec .",
    "iii .  a and explicit expressions for the renormalization differential equations , particle number expectation values , correlation functions and single - particle spectral functions are given in sec .",
    "b. section iv presents the corresponding numerical results .",
    "our main conclusions can be found in sec .",
    "the hamiltonian for the efkm is written @xmath11 where @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) and @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) are the creation ( annihilation ) operators in momentum ( @xmath16- ) space of spinless @xmath1- and @xmath0-electrons , respectively , and @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the corresponding occupation numbers in real space .",
    "the fourier - transformed fermionic operators are defined via @xmath19 , where @xmath20 , and the @xmath21-fermion dispersion is @xmath22 with on - site energy @xmath23 . in eq .",
    ", @xmath24 denotes the chemical potential . in the tight - binding limit , on a d - dimensional hypercubic lattice",
    ", we have @xmath25 .",
    "the sign of @xmath26 determines whether we deal with a direct ( @xmath27 ) or indirect ( @xmath28 ) band - gap situation .",
    "usually , the @xmath1-electrons are considered to be ` light ' and their hopping integral is taken to be the unit of energy ( @xmath29 ) , while the @xmath0-electrons are ` heavy ' , i.e. , @xmath30 . for @xmath31 ( dispersionless @xmath0 band ) , the local @xmath0-electron number is strictly conserved  @xcite . the third term in the hamiltonian   represents the coulomb interaction between @xmath1 and @xmath0 electrons at the same lattice site .",
    "hence , if the @xmath1 and @xmath0 bands are degenerate , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , the efkm reduces to the standard hubbard model .    in order to address the formation of the ei state in the efkm",
    ", we look for a non - vanishing excitonic expectation value @xmath34 , indicating a kind of spontaneous symmetry breaking due the pairing of @xmath1 electrons ( @xmath35 ) with @xmath0 holes ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "this is quite similar to the problem of electronic ferroelectricity , where @xmath37 causes electrical polarizability without an interband transition driving field , provided the @xmath1 and @xmath0 states have different parity  @xcite .",
    "thereby , depending on the sign of @xmath38 ( direct or indirect gap ) , ferro- or antiferroelectric phases may exist .",
    "to proceed , we introduce two - particle interaction operators in momentum space , @xmath39 and rewrite the efkm hamiltonian   in a normal - ordered form  @xcite : @xmath40 where @xmath41 with @xmath42 , plays the role of the ei order parameter .",
    "note that choosing the normal - ordered representation of operators , the symmetry of the hamiltonian is explicitly broken , and iterating the self - consistency equation derived below will readily give ( meta- ) stable solutions  @xcite . in the hamiltonian  ,",
    "the on - site energies were shifted by a hartree term , @xmath43 where @xmath44 are the particle number densities of @xmath1 or @xmath0 electrons for a system with @xmath45 lattice sites . in what follows ,",
    "we consider the half - filled band case , i.e. , we fix the total electron density @xmath46 .",
    "the prm was recently developed with the aim to diagonalize many - particle systems  @xcite .",
    "one of the main advantages of the method is to find broken symmetry solutions of phase transitions  @xcite .",
    "for example , in ref .",
    "the method was successfully applied to the @xmath47 model in order to study superconducting @xmath48-wave solutions for cuprates .",
    "the prm starts from the decomposition of a given many - particle hamiltonian into an ` unperturbed ' part @xmath49 and into a ` perturbation ' @xmath50 , where the unperturbed part @xmath49 should be solvable .",
    "suppose all diagonal matrix elements of @xmath50 between eigenvectors of @xmath49 vanish , the part @xmath50 accounts for all transitions between the eigenstates of @xmath49 with nonzero transition energies .",
    "then , the first goal of the prm is to transform the initial hamiltonian into an effective hamiltonian @xmath51 which contains no longer transition operators with energies larger than some chosen cutoff @xmath52 .",
    "thereby , the hamiltonian @xmath51 is formally obtained by applying a unitary transformation @xmath53 the transformed hamiltonian @xmath51 , which has the same eigenspectrum as the original hamiltonian @xmath54 , can again be decomposed into two parts @xmath55 due to construction , all matrix elements @xmath56 of @xmath57 with energy differences @xmath58 should vanish , i.e.  @xmath59 , where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the new renormalized eigenvalues and eigenstates of @xmath62 .",
    "note that neither @xmath61 nor @xmath63 have to be low - energy eigenstates of @xmath62 . to ensure hermiticity of @xmath64 , the generator @xmath65 of the unitary transformation has to satisfy @xmath66 .",
    "a crucial idea for the elimination procedure in the prm is to introduce generalized projection operators @xmath67 and @xmath68 . here",
    "@xmath67 is defined by @xmath69 applied on any operator variable @xmath70 of the hilbert space of the system .",
    "note that in expression  ( [ g5 ] ) only states @xmath61 and @xmath63 satisfying @xmath71 contribute to the transition matrix .",
    "thus , @xmath67 projects on the low energy transitions of @xmath70 , whereas the orthogonal complement @xmath72 projects on the high - energy transitions of @xmath73 . to find an appropriate generator @xmath65 for the unitary transformation from @xmath54 to @xmath74 , the obvious relation @xmath75 has to be fulfilled .    in the original version of the prm  @xcite",
    ", the elimination procedure is performed step - wise .",
    "suppose @xmath76 is the largest transition energy of the original hamiltonian @xmath54 , in the first elimination step all transitions in an energy shell of width @xmath77 between @xmath76 and @xmath78 will be removed .",
    "the subsequent steps remove , roughly speaking , all transitions in the next shell of width @xmath77 between @xmath78 and @xmath79 , and so on . the unitary transformation for the intermediate step from a cutoff @xmath52 to the new cutoff @xmath80 reads @xmath81 here",
    ", the generator @xmath82 has to fulfill the requirement @xmath83 in analogy to  ( [ g81 ] ) .",
    "thus @xmath84 has no matrix elements that connect eigenstates of @xmath85 with energy differences larger than @xmath80 .    by help of eqs .   and",
    ", the generator @xmath82 can easily be constructed in perturbation theory with respect to @xmath86 . up to first order it reads @xmath87 here , @xmath88 is the liouville superoperator of the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath89 , which is defined by the commutator of @xmath89 with any operator @xmath70 on which @xmath88 is applied , i.e.  @xmath90 $ ] .",
    "note , however , that the generator @xmath82 is not completely fixed by eqs .   and  .",
    "in fact , only the part @xmath91 is determined by equation .",
    "the part @xmath92 with only low - energy transitions can still be chosen arbitrarily and was set identical to zero in eq .  .",
    "any physical quantities , which is evaluated in the framework of the prm , is independent of a particular choice of @xmath92  @xcite .",
    "this freedom can be used to derive a continuous version of the method .",
    "thereby , the low excitation part @xmath92 is chosen proportional to @xmath77 , which allows to derive differential equations for the @xmath52-dependence of the parameter values in the hamiltonian during the renormalization procedure .",
    "as in the discrete version  @xcite , also in the continuous version the elimination starts from the original model and proceeds until @xmath93 . at this point",
    ", all transitions operators from @xmath94 have been used up and the final hamiltonian is diagonal or at least quasi - diagonal which allows to evaluate expectation values .",
    "note that the parameters of the renormalized hamiltonian depend on the parameter values of the original model @xmath54 .    to evaluate expectation values of operators @xmath95 , formed with the full hamiltonian",
    ", we have to apply the unitary transformation to @xmath95 as well , @xmath96 where we define @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 .",
    "thus additional renormalization equations are required for @xmath100 .        in order to derive the renormalization equations for the parameters of the hamiltonian , we first decompose the original hamiltonian @xmath54 into two parts @xmath101 where @xmath102 and @xmath103 note again that the perturbation @xmath94 only contains the fluctuating operator part of the coulomb repulsion @xmath104 . following the ideas of the prm approach , we make the following _ ansatz _ for the renormalized hamiltonian @xmath74 after all transitions with energies larger than @xmath52 are integrated out : @xmath105 with @xmath106 here , @xmath107 projects on all low - energy transitions with respect to the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath108 which are smaller than @xmath52 .",
    "due to renormalization all prefactors in eqs .",
    "( [ h0l ] ) , may now depend on the wave vector @xmath109 and on the energy cutoff @xmath52 .",
    "the quantity @xmath110 is an energy shift which enters during the renormalization procedure . in order to evaluate the action of the superoperator @xmath107 on the interaction operator in @xmath111 one has to decompose the fluctuation operators @xmath112 into eigenmodes of @xmath89",
    "obviously , the diagonalization of @xmath89 requires an additional unitary transformation .",
    "however , for the values of @xmath113 , used in the numerical evaluation below , the mixing parameter @xmath114 in eq .   turns out to be always small compared to the energy difference @xmath115 .",
    "this follows from the hartree shifts of the one - particle energies in eq .  .",
    "thus , using as approximation @xmath116 and @xmath117 , we can conclude @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the approximate excitation energy of @xmath112 , i.e. @xmath120 the @xmath121-function in eq",
    ".   ensures that only transitions with excitation energies smaller than @xmath52 remain in @xmath122 .    by integrating out all transitions between the cutoff @xmath76 of the original model and @xmath93 , all parameters of the original model",
    "will become renormalized . to find their @xmath52-dependence , we derive renormalization equations for the parameters @xmath123 , and @xmath124 .",
    "the initial parameter values are determined by the original model ( @xmath125 ) : @xmath126 note that the energy shift @xmath110 in @xmath127 has no effect on expectation values and will be left out in what follows .",
    "next we have to construct the generator @xmath128 of transformation .",
    "using relation , the high transition energy part reads in lowest order perturbation theory according to eqs .",
    "@xmath129 where we have defined @xmath130 . here",
    "the product of the two @xmath121-function assures that only excitations between @xmath131 and @xmath52 are eliminated by the unitary transformation .",
    "as mentioned before , in the present approach we prefer to use a continuous version of the prm approach which is based on the choice of the orthogonal complement part @xmath132 of the generator .",
    "thereby , @xmath132 is chosen proportional to @xmath77 , which means that @xmath133 can be neglected in the limit @xmath134  @xcite . with @xmath135 ,",
    "the following operator form for the generator can be used @xmath136 where the operators are taken over from expression . note that the two @xmath121-functions guarantee that expression corresponds to the generator part with low energy excitations only . for the coefficients @xmath137",
    "we make the following _ ansatz _ : @xmath138 which is an appropriate choice in the continuous version of the prm  @xcite .",
    "the constant @xmath139 in ( [ alpha ] ) denotes an energy constant to ensure that the parameter @xmath140 has the correct dimension of an inverse energy . at first glance",
    ", one might expect that @xmath141 diverges at @xmath142 .",
    "instead it vanishes exponentially at this point which follows from the renormalization equation for @xmath124 , given below .",

    "so the question whether @xmath217 remains open . that the appearance of the ei phase is intimately connected with the build - up of @xmath0-@xmath1 electron coherence and a non - integral @xmath0-electron valence is demonstrated by the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : df ] , depicting @xmath218 ( cf . also the discussion of fig .",
    "[ fig : nk ] below ) .",
    "the physical picture developed so far does not change if the @xmath0-electron band approaches the @xmath1-electron band from above .",
    "that is our results are one and the same changing the sign of @xmath214 .",
    "we note that in a rather small region around @xmath219 ( symmetric band case ) , a charge - density - wave state is assumed to be the true ground state , i.e. , the ei phase becomes metastable .",
    "focussing on the characterization of the ei phase we will not address this issue here .",
    "next we investigate the renormalization of the 1d band structure .",
    "figure  [ fig : ek ] displays the @xmath205-dependence of the quasiparticle energies @xmath220 in the ei phase , where open and filled symbols correspond to bands having predominantly @xmath1- and @xmath0-electron character , respectively .",
    "there are two features of importance .",
    "first , the band structure is clearly gapful in the ei phase .",
    "hence , for the half - filled band case , the system is insulating .",
    "the gap originates from @xmath1-@xmath0 electron hybridization , induced by the attractive coulomb interaction .",
    "second , the lower and upper quasiparticle bands are narrowed as a result of the electronic correlations . while the maximum of the lower ( at @xmath207 completely occupied ) band",
    "is displaced to larger @xmath205-values as @xmath113 increases , the minimum of the upper ( at @xmath207 empty ) band moves to smaller @xmath205 , accompanied by a flattening of the ` @xmath0-band ' near @xmath221 . at very large",
    "@xmath113 ( not depicted ) , the gap is kept ( but different in nature ) , because of the extreme hartree shift , leading to a @xmath1-@xmath0 band - splitting . except of contributions from the band narrowing",
    ", the hartree shift to the quasiparticle energies is roughly given by the sum of @xmath222 and @xmath223 ( compare eqs .",
    "( [ hartreeshift ] ) , ( [ qpe_c ] ) , ( [ qpe_f ] ) ) .",
    "another quantity of interest is the occupation number of fermionic states carrying momentum @xmath205 .",
    "for free fermions , at @xmath207 , all states up to the fermi energy , @xmath224 , are occupied , so that the momentum distribution function , @xmath225 , has a discontinuity at the corresponding fermi momentum , @xmath226 , where @xmath227 jumps from one to zero . in an interacting fermi liquid",
    "there is still a discontinuity , but the jump is less than one . in 1d , normally luttinger - liquid behavior emerges , with an essential power - law singularity at @xmath226 . for the insulating state , however , @xmath227 is given by a smooth curve .",
    "this holds , e.g. , for the charge - density - wave ground states of 1d @xmath228 and holstein - type models  @xcite , and should also be valid for the ei phase in the 1d efkm .",
    "indeed , the momentum distribution functions of @xmath1 and @xmath0 electrons , @xmath229 , depicted in fig .  [ fig : nk ] confirm this picture .",
    "we see that @xmath230 ( @xmath231 ) monotonously increases ( decreases ) as @xmath205 varies from @xmath221 to @xmath232 . as expected , the drop ( upturn ) near ` @xmath226 ' softens at larger interactions strengths .",
    "we have also included in fig .",
    "[ fig : nk ] the variation of @xmath233 .",
    "this expectation value enters into the equation for the order parameter  . in some sense",
    ", it can be taken as a measure of the range in @xmath205-space , where @xmath1-electrons and @xmath0-holes are involved in the exciton formation and condensation process . having a @xmath113-driven bcs - bec crossover scenario in the ei phase of the efkm in mind  @xcite",
    ", the broadening of the distribution of @xmath234 with increasing @xmath113 might indicate the condensation of a more local two - body bec - like bound - state out of a bcs - like cooper - pair state .",
    "note that in the bec - like state the fermi surface plays no role .",
    "in this section , we present first results for the photoemission ( pe ) spectra in the ei phase of the efkm .",
    "the calculated single - particle spectral functions , associated with the emission ( pe ) or injection ( inverse pe ) of an electron with wave vector @xmath205 , directly measure the occupied and unoccupied densities of single - particle states , and therefore are well suited to investigate pairing gaps as well .",
    "note that the arpes spectral functions @xmath235 fulfill at @xmath207 the frequency sum rule @xmath236 where @xmath237 is given by eqs .   and",
    "( cf . fig .",
    "[ fig : nk ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : awcfef10 ] displays the zero - temperature , wave - vector and energy resolved single - particle spectral functions , @xmath238 [ see eqs .  , ] , for a bare band structure parameterized by @xmath239 ( @xmath240 ) , @xmath209 ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "for weak coulomb attraction , @xmath241 ( upper panels ) we are still in the semi - metallic phase , and consistently @xmath242 and @xmath243 follow the nearly unrenormalized @xmath1- and @xmath0-band dispersions , respectively .",
    "concomitantly , we find a more or less uniform distribution of the spectral weight and negligible incoherent contributions ( see right - hand panels for @xmath242 and @xmath243 ) . when entering the ei phase by increasing @xmath113 to @xmath244 , a gap feature develops at the fermi energy ( fermi momentum ) , but away from that the spectra still show the main characteristics of the semi - metallic state ( cf . both middle panels ) .",
    "at a still larger value @xmath245 , the gap broadens .",
    "most notably , however , is a significant redistribution of the spectral weight from the coherent to the incoherent part of @xmath238 , with pronounced absorption maxima at @xmath246 .",
    "of particular importance is a considerable admixture of @xmath1-electron contributions to the @xmath0-electron spectrum in an interval between @xmath221 and @xmath247 .",
    "the resulting double peak structure around the fermi level can be considered as an almost @xmath205-independent bound object of @xmath1 electrons and @xmath0 holes .",
    "+   +    if we change the location of the @xmath0-band by lowering the position of the @xmath0-electron level , we can achieve that the band structure becomes gapful due to the hartree shift  , even for moderate values of @xmath113 ( assuming @xmath248 ) .",
    "for example , at @xmath249 and @xmath209 , a @xmath1-@xmath0 band - splitting ( positive hartree gap @xmath250 , cf .",
    "[ fig : pd ] ) occurs already at @xmath251 .",
    "such a situation comes closer to the tm[se , te ] system  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : awcfef17 ] shows the pe spectra calculated for these parameter values .",
    "compared to the case @xmath239 , for @xmath244 the gap is clearly a bit more shaped , but the main features of the spectrum stay the same . here",
    "we are in the bcs - regime , where pairing fluctuations are expected to be small . for @xmath252",
    ", we enter the bec - regime , where preformed pairs acquire quantum coherence ( many - body character ) during the condensation process . since @xmath253 the gap persists .",
    "the distinct incoherent contributions , showing up in the @xmath238 spectra at high energies , are related to the dissociation of two - particle bound - states ( excitons ) .",
    "+     +    to visualize more clearly the spectral weight and line - shape of the various absorption signals , we provide in fig .",
    "[ fig : inawcfef17 ] a color - map intensity - plot of the single - particle spectral functions depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : awcfef17 ] . particularly from the @xmath243 data",
    ", it appears that the bcs - bec crossover is again marked by a notable admixture of @xmath1-electron - like contributions leading to new peak - line structures in the spectrum ( cf .",
    "right - hand panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : inawcfef17 ] ) .",
    "to summarize , we adapted a continuous version of the projective renormalization method to the extended falicov - kimball model to examine the possible existence of a collective excitonic insulator phase at the semimetal - semiconductor transition .",
    "thereby the prm approach allows us to derive analytical expressions for the ei order parameter and various other physical quantities characterizing the ground - state and spectral properties of the model .",
    "the self - consistent evaluation of the renormalization equations yields a stable ei solution for the one - dimensional efkm , at half - filling and zero temperature .",
    "it therefore confirms previous , straight numerical data by constrained path integral monte carlo .",
    "in particular , the phase boundary between the excitonic and band insulator agrees even quantitatively with the cpmc results .",
    "thus , increasing the coulomb attraction between @xmath1-band electrons and @xmath0-band holes , the appearance of a semimetal - ei transition seems to be settled for the 1d efkm .",
    "moreover , we present novel results for the single - particle @xmath1- and @xmath0-electron spectral function of the efkm .",
    "the calculated photoemission spectra are in evidence of a bcs - bec crossover of the excitonic condensate , triggered by the coulomb interaction .",
    "thereby the character of the electron - hole pairs changes from the many - body bound state associated with the cooper - type instability ( weak - to - intermediate coupling bcs - side ) to the two - body ( tightly - bound exciton ) bound - state ( intermediate - to - strong coupling bec side ) , where fermi surface effects are negligible .",
    "hallmark of the bcs - bec crossover in the quasiparticle spectra is a substantial spectral weight transfer from the coherent to the incoherent part of the spectrum .",
    "a more thorough analysis of the pairing fluctuations , which are expected to be strongly enhanced in the bcs - bec transition region , e.g. by calculating the dynamical pair - susceptibilities within the prm approach , would be a worthwhile goal of forthcoming studies ."
