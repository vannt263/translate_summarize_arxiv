    "while random linear network coding @xcite has proved to be a powerful tool for disseminating information in networks , it is highly susceptible to errors caused by various sources , such as noise , malicious or malfunctioning nodes , or insufficient min - cut .",
    "if received packets are linearly combined at random to deduce the transmitted message , even a single error in one erroneous packet could render the entire transmission useless .",
    "thus , error control for random linear network coding is critical and has received growing attention recently .",
    "error control schemes proposed for random linear network coding assume two types of transmission models : some @xcite depend on and take advantage of the underlying network topology or the particular linear network coding operations performed at various network nodes ; others @xcite assume that the transmitter and receiver have no knowledge of such channel transfer characteristics .",
    "the contrast is similar to that between coherent and noncoherent communication systems .",
    "error control for noncoherent random linear network coding was first considered in @xcite . motivated by the property that random linear network coding is vector - space preserving , an operator channel that captures the essence of the noncoherent transmission model was defined in @xcite . similar to codes defined in complex grassmannians for noncoherent multiple - antenna channels , codes defined in grassmannians over a finite field @xcite play a significant role in error control for noncoherent random linear network coding .",
    "we refer to these codes as constant - dimension codes ( cdcs ) henceforth .",
    "these codes can use either the subspace metric @xcite or the injection metric @xcite .",
    "the standard advocated approach to random linear network coding ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) involves transmission of packet headers used to record the particular linear combination of the components of the message present in each received packet . from coding theoretic",
    "perspective , the set of subspaces generated by the standard approach may be viewed as a * suboptimal * cdc with minimum injection distance @xmath0 in a grassmannian , because the whole grassmannian forms a cdc with minimum injection distance @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "hence , studying random linear network coding from coding theoretic perspective results in better error control schemes .",
    "general studies of subspace codes started only recently ( see , for example , @xcite ) . on the other hand , there is a steady stream of works related to codes in grassmannians .",
    "for example , delsarte @xcite proved that a grassmannian endowed with the injection distance forms an association scheme , and derived its parameters .",
    "the nonexistence of perfect codes in grassmannians was proved in @xcite . in @xcite , it was shown that steiner structures yield diameter - perfect codes in grassmannians ; properties and constructions of these structures were studied in @xcite ; in @xcite , it was shown that steiner structures result in optimal cdcs .",
    "related work on certain intersecting families and on byte - correcting codes can be found in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "an application of codes in grassmannians to linear authentication schemes was considered in @xcite . in @xcite , a singleton bound for cdcs and a family of codes that are * nearly * singleton - bound - achieving",
    "are proposed , a recursive construction of cdcs which outperform the codes in @xcite was given in @xcite , while a class of codes with even greater cardinality was given in @xcite . despite the * asymptotic optimality * of the singleton bound and the codes proposed in @xcite , neither is optimal in finite cases : upper bounds tighter than the singleton bound exist and can be achieved in some special cases @xcite .",
    "thus , two research problems about cdcs remain open : the * maximal cardinality * of a cdc with * finite * dimension and minimum distance is yet to be determined , and it is not clear how to construct an optimal code that achieves the maximal cardinality .    in this paper , we introduce a novel approach to solving the two aforementioned problems .",
    "namely , we aim to solve these problems via constant - rank codes ( crcs ) , which are the counterparts in rank metric codes of constant hamming weight codes .",
    "there are several reasons for our approach .",
    "first , it is difficult to solve the two problems above directly based on cdcs since projective spaces lack a natural group structure @xcite .",
    "also , the rank metric is very similar to the hamming metric in many aspects , and hence familiar results from the hamming space can be readily adapted .",
    "furthermore , existing results for rank metric codes in the literature are more extensive than those for cdcs .",
    "finally , the rank metric has been shown relevant to error control for both noncoherent @xcite and coherent @xcite random linear network coding .",
    "based on our approach , this paper makes two main contributions .",
    "our first main contribution is that we establish a connection between crcs and cdcs . via this connection",
    ", we show that optimal cdcs correspond to optimal crcs over matrices with sufficiently many rows .",
    "this connection converts the aforementioned open research problems about cdcs into research problems about crcs , thereby allowing us to take advantage of existing results on rank metric codes in general to tackle such problems . despite previous works on rank",
    "metric codes , constant - rank codes per se unfortunately have received little attention in the literature .",
    "our second main contribution is our investigation of crcs . in particular , we derive upper and lower bounds on the maximum cardinality of a crc , propose explicit constructions of optimal or asymptotically optimal crcs , and establish asymptotic bounds on the maximum rate of crcs .",
    "our investigation of crcs not only is important for our construction of cdcs , but also serves as a powerful tool to study cdcs and rank metric codes .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : preliminaries ] reviews some necessary background . in section  [ sec : connection ] , we determine the connection between optimal crcs and optimal cdcs . in section  [ sec : constant_rank ] , we study the maximum cardinality of crcs , and present our results on the asymptotic behavior of the maximum rate of a crc .",
    "error correction codes with the rank metric @xcite have been receiving steady attention in the literature due to their applications in storage systems @xcite , public - key cryptosystems @xcite , space - time coding @xcite , and network coding @xcite .",
    "below we review some important properties of rank metric codes established in @xcite .    for all @xmath1 , it is easily verified that @xmath2 is a metric over @xmath3 , referred to as the _ rank metric _ henceforth .",
    "please note that the rank metric for the vector representation of rank metric codes is defined differently @xcite .",
    "since the connection between the matrix representation of rank metric codes and cdcs is more natural , we consider the matrix representation of rank metric codes henceforth .",
    "we denote the number of matrices of rank @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) in @xmath3 as @xmath6 @xcite , where @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 for @xmath10 . the term @xmath11 is often referred to as a gaussian binomial  @xcite , and satisfies @xmath12 for all @xmath13 , where @xmath14 @xcite .",

    "a rank metric code is a subset of @xmath3 , and its _ minimum rank distance _",
    ", denoted as @xmath21 , is simply the minimum rank distance over all possible pairs of distinct codewords .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that the minimum rank distance of a code of cardinality @xmath22 in @xmath3 satisfies @xmath23 in this paper , we refer to this bound as the singleton bound for rank metric codes and codes that attain the equality as maximum rank distance ( mrd ) codes .",

    "in contrast , none of previously proposed constructions lead to optimal cdcs for all parameter values .",
    "for example , the construction based on liftings of rank metric codes @xcite leads to suboptimal cdcs ( though sometimes they may be nearly optimal ) . this is because cdcs of dimension @xmath4 based on liftings of rank metric codes have the highest possible covering radius @xmath4 @xcite , which implies there",

    "the construction based on steiner structures @xcite and that based on computational techniques @xcite lead to optimal cdcs , but are applicable to special cases only .",

    "[ th : a = as ] , optimal crcs lead to optimal cdcs provided that @xmath144 , and hence the parameter @xmath36 may vary anywhere above the lower bound @xmath159 . on the other hand , the constructions in the literature use fixed dimensions and do not introduce any new parameter .",
    "for instance , in order to obtain a cdc in @xmath39 by lifting a rank metric code , the original code must be in @xmath160 .",
