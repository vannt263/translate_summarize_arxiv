    "however , larger samples are required to conclude whether the origin of sne iax is homogeneous .",
    "c      we precisely calculated the rise time of a sn iax for the first time ( see  3.2 ) .",
    "@xcite reported a rise time of @xmath117 days for sn 2005hk using a quadratic fit to the first two photometric points .",
    "we used the same method to calculate the rise time of sn 2012z .",
    "figure [ rtcmp ] shows the rise time and @xmath4m@xmath118(@xmath6 ) of these two sne iax and other sne ia . @xcite",
    "measured the rise times of sne ia directly .",
    "the rise times calculated using template - fitting methods are also plotted .",
    "the rise times for sne ia were @xmath119 days , and the rise time of sn 2012z was @xmath14 days , which is significantly faster than any other sne ia , including those calculated using template - fitting extrapolation methods @xcite .",
    "the quadratic fit of the light curves to sne iax has been problematic , because of a paucity of data during the rising phase .",
    "the rise times of individual sne iax have been discussed using various methods .",
    "@xcite calculated the rise time of sn 2008 ha as @xmath010 days using a scaling method based on the light curves of sn 2005hk .",
    "@xcite also used a scaling method to calculate the rise time of sn 2009ku , and reported the rise time as @xmath120 days .",
    "@xcite inferred the rise time of sn 2007qd as @xmath121 days using the previous upper limit magnitudes prior to its discovery .",
    "@xcite reported that the rise time of sn 2008ge should be between 9 and 27 days based on its spectral evolution .",
    "these indicate that the rise times of sne ia exhibit a variety , which may reflect the diversity of the @xmath15ni distributions in the outer layer @xcite .",
    "the short rise time of sn 2012z suggests that the mixing of the ejecta produces the extended @xmath15ni distributions @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the nir light curves exhibit no secondary maxima ( see  3.1 ) .",
    "this indicates that ejecta mixing likely occurred @xcite .",
    "the homogeniety of the nir light curves implies that mixing is a common property shared by sne iax .",
    "thus , the theoretical models must simultaneously describe the homogeneous nir light curves and the diverse rise times .",
    "it is noted that the opacity can also affect the rise time .",
    "lower effective opacity results in the faster rise of the light curves . as mentioned in  3.5 .",
    "a lower luminosity may give a lower opacity of the ejecta , and the effective opacity for sn 2012z may be lower than that in normal sne ia @xcite .",
    "the variety of rise times may result in an over- or under- estimate of the @xmath15ni masses . to determine the rise time with improved accuracy , a high - cadence survey of the sn discoveries at nearby galaxies is required .      in this section",
    "we discuss the nature of the possible companion star .",
    "the rising curves were satisfactorily fitted using a quadratic function ( see  3.3 ) .",
    "however , ejecta - companion interaction models predict bright shock luminosity during the rising phase , especially for the bluer bands @xcite , yet such signatures were not observed in our measurements .",
    "the existence of a giant companion is , therefore , not supported ; however , we note that the strength of this signal is expected to be dependent on the viewing direction .",
    "the environments around sne iax are similar to those of core collapse sne iip @xcite . for sn 2012z",
    ", the age of the progenitor has been estimated to be @xmath122 myr @xcite .",
    "recently binary evolution studies @xcite have shown that the delay times for explosions are as less than 100 myr for wd + he binary systems .",
    "we found that the h  ii region existed at the projected distance of @xmath123pc to sn 2012z , indicating a young population as also inferred by the low metallicity .",
    "this is consistent with the compact blue source in the pre - explosion image @xcite .",
    "the upper limit of the progenitor radius was calculated following @xcite .",
    "shock breakout is expected when the early phase when the ejecta bursts through a progenitor , and the deposited energy is released during the early phase @xcite .",
    "this emission becomes more luminous when the progenitor has a larger radius . in the extreme case ,",
    "the upper limit of luminosity for sn 2011fe was given on just 0.2 days after the explosion @xcite .",
    "its progenitor radius has been reported as limited to at most 0.02@xmath124 @xcite . for sn 2012z ,",
    "the luminosity was obtained at 2.0 days following the explosion @xcite .",
    "to eliminate uncertainties in the models , we scaled the upper limit of the luminosity of sn 2011fe @xcite to that of sn 2012z ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for details ) .",
    "we assumed the kinetic energy was @xmath125 and the mass of the ejecta was @xmath126 ( see  3.5 and figure [ qbl ] ) .",
    "note that the normalized density profile of the progenitor as well as the opacity were assumed to be the same as those of sn 2011fe .",
    "we obtained an upper limit for the radius of sn 2012z as @xmath02.0 @xmath124 .",
    "this ruled out an extended progenitor star like a red giant @xcite .",
    "scenarios with wd progenitors ( both single degenerate and double degenerate ) were therefore supperted .",
    "c      the emission lines during the late epoch were 68 times broader than those of sn 2005hk , whereas the early - phase properties were similar .",
    "the artificially broadened line profiles of sn 2005hk matched with those of sn 2012z , as shown in figure [ spcl ] @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the temperature and density of inner ejecta of sn 2012z were similar to those of sn 2005hk ; however , the velocity and thus spatial extent of the emission region were larger for sn 2012z .",
    "in contrast to the large difference in the late - phase spectra , the early - phase spectra and the light curves of sn 2005hk and sn 2012z were similar .",
    "thus , we speculate that the ejecta of sn 2005hk and sn 2012z had a similar structure in the outer layer , whereas the ejecta of sn 2012z had a more extended inner core .    c      here , we compare the observed properties of sn 2012z with the characteristic features predicted by the following explosion models : pure deflagration , failed deflagration , double detonation , pulsating delayed detonation , and core collapse .",
    "table 7 lists a summary of these comparisons .",
    "a pure deflagration model @xcite has been suggested for sne iax @xcite .",
    "the light curves and spectral evolutions have been synthesized via radiative transfer calculations @xcite based on three - dimensional deflagrations models .",
    "the small amount of ejected @xmath15ni and the slow expansion are consistent with those of sne iax .",
    "there was also no secondary maximum in the theoretical nir light curves , which is interpreted as a mixing within the ejecta @xcite ; this is consistent with the observations .",
    "however , the rise time predicted by the model was significantly longer than our calculated rise time @xcite .",
    "the luminosity of sne 2008 ha and 2010ae may be too faint to compare to the predictions from such explosion models .    a failed deflagration model has also been suggested for sne iax @xcite .",
    "@xcite indicated that part of the ejecta is bound due to the small input energy .",
    "the mass of the compact remnant has been predicted to be @xmath127 .",
    "the small ejected mass is qualitatively consistent with our estimate of the ejecta mass of sn 2012z , which is potentially smaller than the chandrasekhar limiting mass .",
    "the predicted mass in this particular model is smaller than our estimate , but we note there are uncertainties both in models and observationally derived ejecta mass .",
    "@xcite constructed synthetic spectra using their models ; the blue continuum , highly excited features , and low velocities of the elements in the spectra were similar to the spectra of sne 2005hk and 2012z .",
    "the form of the light curve and the absolute luminosities were also well reproduced @xcite .",
    "@xcite reported that the rise time in their models was @xmath011 days , which is consistent with that of sn 2012z .",
    "a compact remnant may also be consistent with the red source of sn 2008 ha detected 1500 days after the explosion using hst archival images @xcite .",
    "detection of possible he donors in the pre - explosion image @xcite may indicate a double - detonation scenario , triggered by he accretion due to a companion star @xcite .",
    "although our spectra do not exhibit any he  i emission lines , a few sne iax do @xcite . however , the expected rise time , expansion velocity , and absolute luminosity are quite different from our data @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the detected pre - sn point source was not a he donor , or challenges a theoretical model that an he accretion results in the double - detonation .",
    "@xcite compared their observations of sn 2012z with the pulsational delayed detonation ( pdd ) model , in which a detonation is triggered following a failed deflagration @xcite .",
    "@xcite reported that the decline of the line velocity in ca  ii h&k and the flat - topped line profile of [ fe  ii ] @xmath361.64 @xmath128 m during the late phase supports the pdd model .",
    "the rapid rise and the low luminosity can also be reproduced by the pdd model @xcite .",
    "the higher luminosity should follow the later maximum in the nir bands .",
    "such effect may explain the single peak in the @xmath32 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 bands @xcite .",
    "the pdd may be another attractive scenarios in these aspects .",
    "finally , we compare our observations with the behavior predicted by a core collapse scenario .",
    "@xcite reported that the wide range of absolute luminosities observed in sne iax could be reproduced by this model .",
    "the rapid rise may also be explained ; however , the quasi - bolometric light curves and the si  ii velocity favor @xmath126 and @xmath129 erg  s@xmath16 , which can not be reproduced by a core collapse scenario .",
    "table 7 lists a summary of these comparisons .",
    "the failed deflagration model is the most favored scenario to describe the observed properties of sn 2012z , as well as other sne iax .",
    "however , as discussed in  4.2 , sne iax exhibit varied rise times ; it follows that the @xmath15ni distributions in the outer part of the ejecta may also be diverse among sne iax .",
    "more comprehensive explosion models are required to describe both the diversity and homogeneity .",
    "we have carried out optical and near - infrared observations of the sn iax 2012z from immediately after the explosion to @xmath77 d. we have described long - duration observations of the @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27-band light curves of a sn iax for the first time .",
    "our findings are summarized as follows .",
    "* there were no secondary maxima in the @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 bands .",
    "the nir light curves and color evolutions of sn 2012z were very similar to those of other sne iax . * the @xmath25 and @xmath26-band absolute magnitudes were @xmath2 mag and @xmath9@xmath116 mag , and the rate of decline of the @xmath6-band light curve was @xmath4 @xmath5(@xmath6)@xmath7 mag .",
    "these are very similar to those of the bright sn iax 2005hk ; however , sn 2012z was more luminous than the faint sne iax 2008 ha and 2010ae .",
    "* the rise time was calculated to be @xmath14 days , which is significantly shorter than @xmath117 days for sn 2005hk .",
    "the rise times of sne iax may exhibit significant diversity . *",
    "the explosion site was characterized by low metallicity and a moderate star - forming environment ; this is consistent with the binary evolution models of an he star .",
    "however , the popular explosion scenario for such a system ( i.e. , double detonation ) is not compatible to the observed sn properties .",
    "the rapid rise indicates that @xmath15ni was present in the outer layer .",
    "the single peak of the nir light curves also suggests mixing of iron - peak elements throughout the ejecta .",
    "these properties may be also explained by the opacity effect .",
    "the rise indicates that the progenitor was more compact than a red giant .    comparing our observations with the theoretical models",
    ", the most probable scenario appears to be the failed deflagration model , although pdd model @xcite is not excluded .",
    "the large diversity of the rise times observed in sne iax requires a more comprehensive theoretical analysis .",
    "the observations indicate that they may originate from a homogeneous population .",
    "there appears to be a diverse range of rise times , however , and bright sne iax samples are required to further investigate this .",
    "a high - cadence survey of nearby galaxies is therefore encouraged .",
