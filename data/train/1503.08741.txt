    "the tunneling of conduction electrons into local charge traps is a prevalent phenomena in solid state physics .",
    "traps can be realized by artificial structures such as quantum dots,@xcite or by natural `` unwanted '' defects such as dangling bonds @xcite and bound states in metal / oxide interfaces .",
    "@xcite it has long been recognized that trap fluctuation causes charge noise in electronic devices , with the signature of individual traps being observed with a lorentzian @xmath1 noise spectral density in small structures @xcite and an ensemble of them causing @xmath0 noise in large structures .",
    "@xcite here we address the fundamental question of how the electron _ spin _ alters trap noise",
    ".    one of the greatest developments of interacting electron physics was the discovery that a local trap interacting with a fermi sea gives rise to the kondo effect , the formation of a many - body singlet with conduction electron spins screening out the local trap spin .",
    "@xcite the signatures of the kondo effect in transport phenomena are well studied , but key issues related to dynamics have only been addressed recently with the emergence of modern numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) algorithms . @xcite it is particularly interesting to find out whether trap noise will impact devices that are sensitive to _ magnetic fluctuations as opposed to charge _ , e.g. spin - based or spintronic devices , @xcite in the same way that it affects conventional charge - based devices .",
    "recent measurements of intrinsic magnetic flux noise in superconducting quantum interference devices do indeed confirm that trap spin fluctuation is the dominant source of noise.@xcite moreover , novel developments in spin noise spectroscopy @xcite open several possibilities for the detection of correlated spin fluctuations in quantum dot systems .",
    "given these interesting prospects , the question that we address here is the qualitative difference between pure charge / spin noise of a `` kondo trap '' interacting with a fermi sea , which we define as a local charge trap in the kondo regime . the interplay of kondo physics and noise has been mostly explored in the context of transport through quantum - dot systems , with the kondo trap right inside the transport path . in this case trap charge and spin fluctuation",
    "are intertwined in a non - trivial way .",
    "calculations of the shot noise and current noise in different set - ups such as single @xcite and double quantum dots@xcite in the kondo regime have been reported .",
    "much less studied is the role of the kondo state in _ spin _ noise .",
    "the case of spin - current noise was considered in refs . and , and",
    "qualitative differences between spin - current and charge - current noise were found to exist .    in this article , we show that focusing on _ pure spin / charge trap noise _",
    "( i.e. , finite frequency trap occupation noise ) allows for a different perspective on the problem of kondo trap dynamics : it enables a clear separation between the contributions of single - particle excitations and the many - particle processes connected with the formation of the kondo singlet state .",
    "moreover , considering pure spin ( charge ) trap noise is important for describing transport experiments with traps outside the transport channel . in this case ,",
    "trap fluctuations produce bias magnetic ( electric ) noise that in turn may dominate the spin - current ( charge - current ) noise .",
    "our article is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : model ]",
    "we outline our model for pure spin / charge trap noise , and establish its connection to the usual spin / charge susceptibilities .",
    "we demonstrate six exact results : four sum rules and two shiba relations . in section  [ sec : hf ] we describe our hartree - fock ( hf ) or mean - field approximation , that mainly accounts for single - particle processes . in section  [ sec : nrg ] we present our non - perturbative nrg calculations , which account for single - particle and many - particle processes on the same footing .",
    "the nrg results show that finite - frequency spin / charge noise have quite distinct behaviors and are dominated by completely different processes . in section  [ sec : analyticspin ] we use nrg and the sum rules to obtain an analytic approximation to spin noise in the kondo regime , and in section  [ sec : disorder ] we use this analytic approximation to study the interplay between disorder and kondo correlations in an ensemble of kondo traps .",
    "we show that , in the presence of disorder , the spin noise displays a temperature - dependent @xmath0 noise that is qualitatively distinct from the temperature - independent charge @xmath0 noise .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : conclusion ] presents our concluding remarks , with a discussion of the impact of our results in the effort to detect kondo correlations in spin noise spectroscopy experiments , and our prediction of qualitatively different @xmath0 noise impacting spin - based and charge - based devices .",
