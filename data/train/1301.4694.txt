    "the discovery of the higgs - like particle ( @xmath9 ) by atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite collaborations is a great triumph of particle physics .",

    "the experimental data have shown that the diphoton decay rate is about @xmath10 times larger than the sm prediction , while the measurements in other channels including @xmath11 and @xmath12 agree with the sm higgs properties . due to the fact that the higgs particle is electric neutral , its coupling to diphoton must be induced by some charged particles running in the loops , while in the sm , the w - boson and top - quark loops give the dominant contributions  @xcite . if the enhancement in the diphoton channel persists , it clearly indicates  @xcite that there must be some additional new charged particles which couple to the higgs and mediate this decay process .",
    "based on the electroweak ( ew ) @xmath13 gauge symmetry , these new particles should also contribute to the @xmath14 channel and generically lead to a shift in the @xmath6 decay width from the sm expectation . as pointed out in refs .",

    "some similar scenarios have already been explored in refs .",
    "however , the formulae for the scalar contributions to the @xmath6 decay width used in the literature  @xcite are not consistent with each other .",
    "moreover , they can not be reduced to the corresponding rates for @xmath16 by taking the limit of @xmath4 and making the charge replacement . as a result , these numerical predictions for the @xmath6 decay width may not be reliable . clearly , it is timely important to re - calculate the scalar contributions to the decay .",
