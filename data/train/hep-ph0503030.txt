    "neutrino telescopes have great potential for probing physics beyond the standard model when new particles are created by high energy cosmic neutrino passing through the earth . a recent proposal @xcite showed that the detection of two nearly parallel charged particle tracks from a pair of metastable staus , which are produced as secondary particles in very high energy neutrino - nucleon interactions , may provide a unique way of probing the supersymmetry ( susy ) breaking scale in weak scale supersymmetry models .",
    "ultrahigh energy neutrinos from astrophysical sources travel undeflected to the earth .",

    "( lsp ) and stau is the next lightest supersymmetric particle ( nlsp ) , heavier slepton and squarks instantly decay into the stau nlsp @xcite .",
    "the high energy stau would then travel a long distance , typically more than tens to @xmath4 kilometers , before it decays into the gravitino lsp .",
    "the superparticle pair production rate , however , is very small in comparison to the standard model charged - current cross section .",
    "thus production of staus from downward neutrinos is negligible compared to showers from production through the standard model processes .",
    "however , the observability of the stau produced via upward going neutrinos could be enhanced . the small stau production cross section",
    "are compensated by the enlarged effective volume of an instrumented region due to the very long lifetime of the stau and its relatively slow energy loss in the water , ice or rock surrounding the detector @xcite .",
    "the potential for neutrino telescopes to discover stau production in neutrino - nucleon interactions in earth depends in part on the stau lifetime and range . in order to refine estimates of the signal from metastable staus",
    ", it is crucial to determine the energy loss of the high energy stau as it traverses the earth .",
