    "experiments on spinodal decomposition in polymer blends show that the coarsening process may sometimes slow dramatically or even cease before reaching equilibrium @xcite - @xcite . in these systems , spinodal decomposition",
    " which is the process by which a thermodynamically unstable mixture demixes to a stable , phase - separated equilibrium state @xcite - @xcite  proceeds normally for some time following a quench to the unstable region ( @xmath0 ) , and then stops .",
    "a break - up of the characteristic , interconnected pattern is observed to precede this pinning phenomenon .",
    "the nonequilibrium , microphase - separated blend has been observed to remain in this pinned state over an appreciable time scale where little domain growth occurs .",
    "the eventual breakup of the evolving morphology into separated droplets is a natural consequence of the asymmetric composition in an off - critical blend @xcite ; nevertheless , it may also occur in near - critical blends due to other forces ( e.g. gravity ) .",
    "polymer blends in which pinning has recently been observed for off - critical composition include x-7g / poly(ethylene teraphthalate ) ( a liquid crystalline polymer / homopolymer blend ) @xcite , poly(styrene - ran - butadiene)/polybutadiene @xcite , poly(styrene - ran - butadiene)/polyisoprene @xcite , and polybutadiene / polyisoprene @xcite .",
    "the specific mechanism responsible for pinning in these blends is poorly understood , and is currently a topic of considerable discussion . while there is general agreement that growth stops soon after the breakup into separated `` droplets '' or `` clusters '' ( a so - called `` percolation - to - cluster transition '' @xcite ) , the mechanism that prevents further coarsening of disconnected domains remains to be clarified .",
    "one intriguing scenario points to an entropic barrier as the reason for the observed arrested growth of off - critical phase separating blends .",
    "kotnis and muthukumar ( km ) @xcite have suggested that due to the connectivity of the chains and the reduced conformational entropy near domain interfaces @xcite , the usual evaporation - condensation mechanism of coarsening @xcite observed in small - molecule mixtures is suppressed in polymer blends , and instead coarsening occurs via parallel transport of chains along the interface @xcite .",
    "consequently , km postulate that if the concentration of the minority - rich phase becomes smaller than the percolation threshold , the parallel coarsening mechanism will be inhibited and the clusters will `` freeze '' after an initial growth period .",
    "hashimoto and coworkers have instead postulated that the enthalpy of mixing , rather than the entropy , provides the barrier to further coarsening following the percolation - to - cluster transition @xcite .",
    "they argue that the increase in enthalpy of mixing suffered upon removing a chain of species @xmath1 and degree of polymerization @xmath2 from the surface of an @xmath1-rich domain is @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the flory interaction parameter , @xmath5 is boltzmann s constant , and @xmath6 is temperature . in the strong segregation limit @xmath7 , and",
    "thus evaporation of the chain from the domain surface , which would occur with a boltzmann probability proportional to @xmath8 , is highly unfavorable .",
    "thus , when the parallel transport mechanism is eliminated by the breakup into droplets , coarsening ceases .    in this paper , we re - explore the kinetics of spinodal decomposition in off - critical polymer blends described by the flory - huggins - de gennes ( fhdg ) free energy functional , through numerical simulations of the cahn - hilliard ( ch ) equation . in sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] , we discuss the ch - fhdg equation and the origin of the concentration - dependent square gradient coefficient that has been proposed by km to cause pinning in off - critical blends .",

    "whereas in small molecule mixtures the square gradient coefficient is enthalpic ( arising from short range interactions between molecules ) and independent of the local concentration @xcite , de gennes proposed that the connectivity of polymer molecules in inhomogeneous blends manifests itself through an additional , concentration - dependent contribution to the square gradient coefficient @xmath20 @xcite .",

    "the interfacial width is much larger than the chain dimensions @xcite , so that the length scales of interest are larger than @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) , and thus the debye function may be approximated by @xmath29 . the square gradient coefficient in eq .  [ eq : kappa ]",
    "is then obtained from the coefficient of the @xmath30 term in the taylor expansion of the inverse structure factor , which is related to the free energy functional by @xcite @xmath31 , where the r.h.s .",
    "is evaluated in q - space .    because of the approximations made in the calculation of the square gradient expression , the flory - huggins - de gennes free energy functional describes the physics of blends in the weak segregation limit , and on length scales much larger than the average chain dimension @xcite . in strongly - segregating blends ( @xmath7 )",
    "for which @xmath4 is small but @xmath32 , eq .  2.2 with a different prefactor in the @xmath12-dependent part is typically used @xcite .    the local part of the free energy ( eq .",
    "[ eq : fh ] ) has the same ginzburg - landau type of double - well structure as small molecules or ising - like systems @xcite .",
    "thus , the only difference between the free energy functionals for the simplest small molecule and polymeric systems arises from the chain connectivity , which is expressed in the fhdg functional through the reduction of the entropic part of the local term , and by the @xmath12-dependent part of the square - gradient coefficient .",
    "km proposed that the entropic contribution to the nonlocal part of the free energy , namely the concentration - dependent square - gradient coefficient , provides the barrier to coarsening which , when combined with the percolation - to - cluster transition , causes pinning of the off - critical phase - separating blend . in the next section",
    ", we re - examine the numerical solution of the time evolution of the ch - fhdg equation for both critical and off - critical blends .",
    "specifically , we show that for this model pinning is _ not observed _ in the continuum limit , regardless of the blend composition , although a dynamical exponent slightly smaller than @xmath33 is found .",
    "the theoretical description of spinodal decomposition in binary blends is based on the cahn - hilliard - cook equation for the time evolution of the concentration , originally derived for small molecule systems @xcite : @xmath34 in this equation , @xmath35 is the mobility , @xmath36 is the coarse - grained free energy functional , and @xmath37 is thermal noise . for polymers , the free energy functional",

    "[ eq : chfhdg1 ] we have neglected the thermal noise term . since we are interested in the presence or absence of pinning due to the fhdg free energy functional alone , and since it has been shown that the presence of thermal noise in the analogue of this equation for small molecule systems does not influence the scaling function or the growth exponent during coarsening@xcite , we will neglect noise in our simulations@xcite .",
    "[ eq : chfhdg1 ] can be rescaled so that it depends on dimensionless space and time variables . the transformation , valid only in the unstable region , is the following @xcite : @xmath46 where @xmath47 gives the spinodal curve and @xmath48 is the average value of concentration .",

    "at early times following the quench , the uniform concentration is unstable with respect to the long wavelength fluctuations arising from the initial condition , and the two components begin to spatially separate .",
    "domains rich in one or the other component form , and then coarsen so as to remove interfaces and minimize the free energy . in small - molecule mixtures described by , e.g. , the ginzburg - landau free energy functional , these domains coarsen until phase separation is complete regardless of the relative composition and the presence of thermal noise . our goal in this paper is to determine if the same is true for the fhdg free energy functional @xcite .    in the late stages of decomposition , the system can be characterized by the evolution of the typical size of growing domains . the scaling hypothesis @xcite states that this length @xmath51 ( as calculated from , e.g. , the inverse of the peak position of the structure factor , the inverse of the first moment of the structure factor , the position of the first zero in the pair correlation function , etc . ) evolves in time according to @xmath52 the choice of one particular definition of @xmath51 is dictated only by convenience .",

    ", the late stage behavior is the same for both critical and off - critical quenches , even after the blend undergoes the percolation - to - cluster transition .",

    "the values of @xmath65 can be computed from the slopes of the curves in fig .",
    "[ n=64 ] and are reported in table  [ tab1 ] . in all cases",
    "@xmath65 is found to be greater than @xmath90 and smaller than @xmath33 .",
    "we believe that the latter is the true asymptotic value for this free energy functional ; the small systematic error may be attributed to the crossover from the preasymptotic regime and , possibly , to the numerical slowing down given by a still oversized mesh size ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] ) . increased accuracy might be obtained by using an even smaller value for @xmath55 , but this implies a suitable reduction in the value of @xmath59 , and as a result , a prohibitively large computation time .",
    "the critical relevance of the mesh size to the late stage behavior of the system is also evident from fig .",
    "[ comparison ] , where a `` pinned '' state obtained with @xmath74 is `` depinned '' by reducing the mesh size to @xmath91 .",
    "the absence of pinning for small mesh sizes in our simulations even for off - critical quenches clearly shows that what is observed for @xmath74 is not a physical effect but only an artifact of the discretization . by integrating eq .",
    "[ eq : chfhdg2 ] via a discretization scheme , we are actually changing the model under consideration : the solution of the discrete model exactly reproduces that of the continuum equation only in the limit where @xmath92 and @xmath55 approach zero .",
    "for this reason one must always confirm that the numerical results are independent of the values of the discretization variables .",
    "in particular , it was recently shown that an oversized mesh size can cause a non - physical freezing of interfacial motion for systems with non - conserved order parameter@xcite .",
    "`` spurious pinning '' was already noted by rogers et al .",
    "@xcite in a conserved order parameter system , who showed that for the cahn - hilliard equation with the ginzburg - landau free energy functional , a mesh size @xmath93 causes an unphysical decrease in the effective growth exponent .    in general",
    ", the solution of the discrete model should reproduce the behavior of the continuum equation if @xmath55 is much less than the smallest physical length modeled in the system . in the case under investigation",
    ", we are studying a polymer blend in the weak segregation limit ( @xmath94 ) .",
    "the smallest physical length that must be resolved is the interfacial width , which during the late stages of phase separation is of the order of the correlation length @xmath95 @xcite : @xmath96 which is close to unity in rescaled units .",
    "choosing @xmath74 implies that we are resolving the system at a length _ equal _ to the correlation length .",
    "the spatial derivatives at the interfaces are consequently computed inaccurately with this mesh size , thereby producing unphysical results .",
    "this picture is confirmed by fig .",
    "[ profile ] showing that when @xmath74 the interface appears only one mesh size wide .",
    "when @xmath97 the interface is smoother , and larger than the mesh size ; hence no pinning occurs .",
    "this effect also explains the low estimates of @xmath65 for critical quenches when @xmath98  the sharpness of the interface unphysically slows down the evolution of the solution , even if it is not sufficient to pin it .",
    "possibly also the results for @xmath97 are slightly biased by this effect .",
    "it is possible to understand the origin of this problem in another way by looking directly at the equation of motion .",
    "consider for simplicity a one - dimensional small molecule system ( i.e. the square - gradient coefficient @xmath99 and the mobility @xmath44 are constant ) , where the concentration profile goes from one bulk value ( @xmath100 ) at site @xmath101 to the other ( @xmath102 ) at site @xmath103 , through an interface .",
    "for the domain size to grow , the interface must move , and thus @xmath104 must change from @xmath100 to @xmath102 . the driving force for this change",
    "is the square gradient term in the free energy , which yields a laplacian in the functional derivative of @xmath43 .",
    "this force must overcome the double well potential given by the local term in the free energy expression , as stated by the cahn - hilliard equation : @xmath105 in the discrete version of this equation , the local part does not depend on @xmath55 , while the laplacian is given by : @xmath106.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] when we increase @xmath55 the denominator grows indefinitely , while the numerator is bounded above by @xmath107 .",
    "then , increasing @xmath55 _ decreases _ the value of the laplacian term , while the local term is unchanged . for @xmath55",
    "large enough the laplacian can not overcome the local term , the solution stops evolving , and the system artificially `` pins '' .",
    "in summary , we have shown that both critical and off - critical polymer blends described by the flory - huggins - de gennes free energy functional undergo spinodal decomposition via the cahn - hilliard equation without pinning of the domain growth as observed in some experiments . even in the absence of thermal noise@xcite",
    ", the solution of the discretized equation of motion shows coarsening without evidence of pinning , regardless of the relative concentration of the blend components .",
    "we have also shown that previous solutions of the ch - fhdg equation that exhibited pinning were artifacts of an oversized mesh size used in the discretization and numerical integration of the equation of motion , and _ not _ a result of the concentration - dependence of the square gradient coefficient as previously suggested @xcite .",
    "this suggests the fhdg free energy functional alone , as written in eq .",
    "[ eq : fhdg ] is not sufficient to describe the physics responsible for pinning in real blends .",
    "evidently , a model able to describe the arrested growth observed in experiments must include additional physical ingredients .",
    "one should consider that experimental blends which exhibit pinning often contain components which are not simple homopolymers ; such is the case with hashimoto s random copolymer / homopolymer blends , as well as with hasegawa s liquid - crystalline polymer / homopolymer blend , in which the liquid - crystalline component is anistropic at the quench temperatures at which pinning was observed .",
    "these blends may not be describable by the simple flory - huggins - de gennes expression , and consequently we should not expect the ch - fhdg equation to mimic their behavior during spinodal decomposition .",
    "it is also important to note that a significant fraction of homopolymer blends never exhibit pinning , regardless of the relative composition .",
    "however , for those that do , it is possible that either the mobility , or free energy functional , or both , must be appropriately modified .",
    "the simplified expression for mobility ( eq .",
    "[ eq : mob ] ) used in the ch - fhdg equation , which was originally derived only for the special case of a perfectly symmetric blend @xcite , may neglect important contributions to mobility arising from the connectivity within the polymer chains .    with respect to possible free energy modifications , it is well known that interfacial growth can be slowed or stopped by decreasing the interfacial tension .",
    "this can be achieved by , e.g. using surfactants in the case of small molecules@xcite , diblock copolymers in the case of polymers@xcite , or impurities in the case of alloys@xcite .",
    "if the experimental blends contain even a small number of impurities , or specific interaction regions that act as impurities @xcite , these impurities could arrest the demixing process and cause pinning .",
    "finally , the fhdg free energy functional in eq .",
    "[ eq : fhdg ] describes incompressible blends ; real blends are in fact compressible .",
    "a coupling of concentration fluctuations and density fluctuations may be responsible for pinning in blends @xcite , in which case a reformulation of the free energy functional as well as the addition of a second order parameter field is necessary .",
