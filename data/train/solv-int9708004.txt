    "one of the important problems in optical fiber soliton communication is to achieve as high of a bit rate as possible . in order to do this , one needs to be able to pack the solitons into as short of a space as possible .",
    "however , if the solitons are too close together , then their mutual ( linear and nonlinear ) interactions can cause them to collide and/or separate , thereby corrupting the signal . the current solution of this problem is simply to require each soliton to be sufficiently far apart from all others ( usually 6 or so soliton widths ) so that such interactions can be totally neglected .",
    "however , at the same time , it was predicted @xcite and experimentally confirmed @xcite that for certain values of relative soliton parameters , this separation can be reduced , and at the same time , still maintain signal integrity .",
    "our main purpose here is to analytically and numerically detail the soliton parameter regime , inside of which , signal integrity can be maintained . in particular , we are interested to determine how one may use this inter - soliton interaction for _ stabilizing _ a soliton train .",
    "any optical communication signal will be composed of `` random '' combinations of @xmath12 s and @xmath13 s .",
    "such a signal can also be viewed as being composed of a random collection of @xmath0-soliton trains , with varying widths of @xmath12 s between them .",
    "thus it is then adequate for us to simply analyze the stability of individual @xmath0-soliton trains , for @xmath14 .",
    "this we will do and will study a nonperiodic and finite train ( chain ) of soliton pulses by both analytical and numerical methods using and developing the ideas in @xcite .",
    "the basic model and description of @xmath0-soliton trains in optical fibers is provided by the nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation and its perturbed version : @xmath15 .\\ ] ] this equation describes a variety of wave interactions , including solitons in nonlinear fiber optics @xcite and spatial solitons in nonlinear refractive media@xcite .",
    "the inverse scattering method @xcite allows one to solve exactly eq .",
    "( [ eq : pnlse ] ) when @xmath16=0 $ ] and to calculate explicitly its @xmath17-soliton solutions .",
    "however for our purposes , this method is impractical for two reasons .",
    "first , there will be important physical problems in this system in need of addressing where @xmath16 $ ] will be nonzero , for which no explicit solutions are known .",
    "second , an approximate method can serve much better than an exact approach since the @xmath17-soliton trains that we need to study are rather special and can only be approximated by @xmath0-soliton solutions .",
    "such trains are actually sums of @xmath13-soliton pulses , which are spaced almost equally , have almost equal amplitudes , and move with essentially the same velocity . more specifically , they are the solutions to eq .",
    "( [ eq : pnlse ] ) with @xmath16=0 $ ] satisfying the following initial conditions : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the 1-soliton solution of the nls given by :    [ eq:1s ] @xmath20 @xmath21",
    "@xmath22 @xmath23    here by @xmath24 , @xmath25 we have denoted the phase and position respectively of the @xmath26-th soliton , @xmath27 is soliton s amplitude while @xmath28 is its velocity .",
    "the quantities @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 all denote the initial values at @xmath33 .    an effective method for studying the interaction of such trains of soliton pulses",
    "was first proposed by karpman and solovev ( ks ) , for the simplest non - trivial case of a 2-soliton interaction@xcite .",
    "further developments and analysis for different physically important perturbations can be found in @xcite and the references therein . for alternative approaches see e.g. @xcite ; for a review see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the ks method is based on the adiabatic approximation .",
    "it is valid for any collection of well separated solitons , such that their mutual interactions will lead to a slow deformation in the soliton parameters .",
    "these conditions are met provided the soliton parameters satisfy :    [ eq : ks ] @xmath34 @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the average initial amplitude and velocity .",
    "how fast adjacent solitons will interact can be measured by a control parameter , @xmath37 , which is a measure of both the overlap between the neighboring solitons and also the strength of their interaction .",
    "this is given by @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the average initial pulse separation .",
    "gorshkov @xcite and arnold @xcite , have conjectured that an infinite train of out - of - phase soliton pulses , with equal amplitudes and velocities could be described by the real toda chain : @xmath40 where @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are real functions related to the soliton positions .",
    "this system will be referred to as the real toda chain ( rtc ) .",
    "the next step towards the physically more realistic case with finite number of solitons was proposed in @xcite . in it",
    "the rtc was shown to describe the propagation of @xmath17 equal amplitudes out - of - phase solitons numerically .    recently in refs .",
    "@xcite , the karpman ",
    "solovev method was extended to @xmath17-soliton pulses , and then with additional approximations , was reduced to the complex toda chain equations ( ctc ) ( [ eq : ctc ] ) with @xmath17 sites .",
    "the corresponding system of equations is ( [ eq : ctc ] ) , but with @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "meanwhile , the complex valued functions @xmath46 are related to the soliton parameters by : @xmath47    with this , the problem of determining the evolution of an nls @xmath0-soliton train has been reduced to the problem of solving the ctc for @xmath0 sites . since",
    "( [ eq : ctc ] ) is also integrable , then we may use the special techniques valid for integrable lattices ( and chains ) to study this problem .",
    "it has already been shown that one may determine the asymptotic behavior of asymptotically separating @xmath48-soliton trains , simply by analyzing the eigenvalues of a certain matrix @xcite .",
    "our main results , briefly reported in @xcite are the following :    \\(i ) we show by analyzing the exact analytic solutions of ctc , that it has several qualitatively different classes of asymptotic regimes .",
    "besides the asymptotically free motion ( which is the only possibility for the rtc ) , ctc allows also for : ( a )  bound state regime when all the @xmath17 particles move quasi - equidistantly ; ( b )  all possible intermediate regimes when one ( or several ) group(s ) of particles form bound state(s ) and the rest of them go into free motion asymptotics .",
    "in addition to these relatively stable regimes of motion there are also less stable regions in the space of soliton parameters , where one regime switches into another one . there",
    "one can find ( c )  singular solutions , which tend to infinity for finite values of @xmath49 , and ( d )  various types of degenerate solutions when two or more of the eigenvalues become equal .",
    "\\(ii ) we show , by comparing the predictions from the ctc model with the numerical solutions of the nls , that regimes of type ( a ) and ( b ) indeed take place in the soliton interactions and are very well described by the ctc model .",
    "our analytic approach allows us to predict the set of initial parameters , for which each of the asymptotic regimes takes place .",
    "we put special stress on the bound state and quasi - equidistant regimes ( a ) since such solutions would be optimum in long distance fiber optics communications .",
    "as in@xcite , one can generalize the rtc @xcite to the complex ctc case .",
    "we list the four most important points concerning this below :    s1 )  the ctc lax representation is the same as for the rtc :    [ eq : lax ] @xmath50,\\ ] ] @xmath51 @xmath52    here the matrices @xmath53 , and @xmath54 whenever one of the indices becomes 0 or @xmath55 ; the other notations in are as follows :    [ eq : k.5 ]",
    "@xmath56 @xmath57    s2 )  the integrals of motion in involution are provided by the eigenvalues , @xmath58 , of @xmath59 .",
    "s3 )  the solutions of both the ctc and the rtc are determined by the scattering data for @xmath60 . when the spectrum of @xmath61 is nondegenerate , i.e. @xmath62 for @xmath63 , then this scattering data consists of @xmath64 . here",
    "@xmath65 are the first components of the corresponding eigenvectors @xmath66 of @xmath61 : @xmath67 which are uniquely determined ( up to an overall sign ) by the normalization condition @xmath68 [ see @xcite ] .",
    "this scattering data uniquely determines both @xmath61 and the solution of the ctc .",
    "s4 )  lastly , the eigenvalues of @xmath69 uniquely determine the asymptotic behavior of the solutions of the ctc ; these eigenvalues can be calculated directly from the initial conditions .",
    "we will extensively use this fact for the description of the different classes of asymptotic behavior .",
    "in addition to the dynamical variables becoming complex valued , there are other , important differences between the rtc and ctc , and their spectra . for the rtc , one has that@xcite both the eigenvalues , @xmath70 , and the coefficients , @xmath65 , are always real - valued .",
    "moreover , one can prove that @xmath62 for @xmath63 , i.e. no two eigenvalues can be exactly the same . as a direct consequence of this , it follows that the only possible asymptotic behavior in the rtc is an asymptotically separating , free motion of the solitons .",
    "this situation is different for the ctc .",
    "in addition to all dynamical variables being possibly complex , the eigenvalues can also become complex , @xmath71 , as well as the coefficients , @xmath65 , as given above .",
    "furthermore , one could now have multiple eigenvalues .",
    "however , the collection of eigenvalues , @xmath70 , still determines the asymptotic behavior of the solitons .",
    "in particular , it is @xmath72 that determines the asymptotic velocity of any soliton . for simplicity , here we shall always take @xmath73 for @xmath63 .",
    "( however , this condition does not necessarily mean that @xmath74 . )",
    "we also may assume that the @xmath75 s are ordered as : @xmath76 .",
    "once this is done , then in any train of solitons , there are three possible general configurations :    d1 )  @xmath77 for @xmath63 .",
    "since the asymptotic velocities are all different , one has the well known asymptotically separating , free solitons .",
    "d2 )  @xmath78 . in this case",
    ", all @xmath17 solitons will move with the same mean asymptotic velocity , and therefore will form a  bound state \" .",
    "the key question now will be the nature of the internal motions in such a bound state .",
    "in particular , one would want any two adjacent solitons to move quasi - equidistantly .",
    "d3 )  one may have also a variety of intermediate situations when only one group ( or several groups ) of particles move with the same mean asymptotic velocity ; then they would form one ( or several ) bound state(s ) and the rest of the particles will have free asymptotic motion .",
    "obviously the cases d2 ) and d3 ) have no analogies in the rtc and are qualitatively different from d1 ) .",
    "the same is also true for the special degenerate cases , where two or more of the @xmath70 s may become equal .",
    "these cases will be considered elsewhere .",
    "another type of solutions of the ctc which should be dealt with separately are the singular solutions .",
    "they appear in a special non - euclidean formulation of the rtc @xcite ; they can be obtained from ctc by taking one or several of the @xmath79 s purely imaginary and the others  real - valued functions of @xmath49 .    in order to avoid complicated and long formulas",
    ", we will skip most of the technical details and will limit ourselves with the simplest nontrivial cases : @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "we also assume without loss of generality that @xmath82 .",
    "the general solution of @xmath80 ctc can always be chosen so that @xmath83 ( the center - of - mass is at rest and at the origin of the coordinate system )",
    ". then ( see also @xcite ) : @xmath84 where @xmath85 . from formula ( [ eq : k.2 ] ) we get : @xmath86 where @xmath87 and @xmath88 are respectively the distance between the solitons and their phase difference . from ( [ eq : k.2 ] ) , ( [ eq : lax ] ) and ( [ eq : k.5 ] ) , we find the following expression for @xmath61 , in terms of the initial soliton parameters : @xmath89 where @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 .    for simplicity , from now on , we will consider only those trains where the solitons have vanishing initial velocities : @xmath93 in some moving coordinate system . then solving the characteristic equation for @xmath61 , we find :    [ eq : zeta ] @xmath94 @xmath95    when @xmath96 is complex in general , with a nonzero imaginary part , then by the above , @xmath97 will be nonzero and the two solitons will always asymptotically separate .",
    "however , when @xmath96 is real , then it is possible for a bound state of two solitons to form .",
    "this requires the relative phase between the solitons , @xmath98 , to be either @xmath12 or @xmath99 .",
    "if it is zero , then @xmath97 is always zero , regardless of the size of any amplitude variations .",
    "if it is @xmath99 , then @xmath97 will again be zero , provided that @xmath100 , where @xmath101 and @xmath102 is a critical value for amplitude variations in a @xmath103-soliton train .",
    "this means that if two adjacent solitons have a sufficiently large initial difference in their amplitudes of @xmath104 , and if the phase difference is @xmath99 , then these two solitons will _ never _ asymptotically separate . in other words , a slight variation in the amplitudes can _ stabilize _ and prevent two solitons from asymptotically separating . obviously , in this case the distance , @xmath105 ( @xmath41 ) , between the solitons will be periodic in @xmath106 with period : @xmath107 where the signs plus and minus correspond to @xmath108 and @xmath109 respectively .",
    "most importantly , this motion is then bounded , and optimally its range should be significantly smaller than the initial spacing between the solitons .",
    "define @xmath110 where @xmath111 and @xmath112 are the maximal and minimal values of @xmath113 .",
    "when @xmath114 , we will call such motion  quasi - equidistant \" . for such motion ,",
    "the solitons will not asymptotically separate , but instead will slowly oscillate with some small amplitude .    for @xmath80 from the explicit form of the solution , we can easily recover ( see also @xcite ) :    [ eq : r - mm ] @xmath115 @xmath116 therefore @xmath117 equals to : @xmath118    where @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "let us look at our two cases . for @xmath108 ,",
    "one obtains @xmath121 and : @xmath122 note that for even moderate values of @xmath39 , almost any small , nonzero value of @xmath123 prevents the singularity in the ctc model ; taking @xmath124 appropriately large ( say @xmath125 for @xmath126 , see table  iv ) leads to a quasi - equidistant motion .    for @xmath127",
    "analogously we find @xmath128 and : @xmath129 note that in this case , the quasi - equidistant regime holds only for @xmath130 .",
    "the value @xmath131 is a critical point , at which the quasi - equidistant regime switches over into the asymptotically separating regime .",
    "thus the motion will be quasi - equidistant if @xmath132 . both formulas ( [ eq : r - d0 ] ) , ( [ eq : r - d1 ] )",
    "show that an increase in @xmath133 diminishes the oscillations of @xmath134 .",
    "another way to diminish @xmath135 for fixed @xmath136 and @xmath137 is to increase the average amplitude @xmath138 ; this would diminish @xmath139 and as a consequence , also @xmath135 .    from here on , we will need to refer frequently to various sets of initial conditions for the @xmath17-soliton trains ; for clarity and brevity we will denote them by quadruples @xmath140 , where @xmath17 is the number of pulses , @xmath141 is the distance between neighboring pulses . in most of our runs ,",
    "listed in the tables , the pulses are initially equidistant ( i.e. @xmath142 ) , the initial phases are chosen to be of the form @xmath143 and the amplitudes are either equal ( @xmath144 ) or @xmath145 and such that the average amplitude equals @xmath146 .",
    "the initial velocities , @xmath147 , in all of our runs are zero .",
    "we assume that @xmath148 , i.e. the center of mass is fixed at the origin .",
    "this is compatible with @xmath149 .",
    "our analysis below is not exhaustive since we will consider only the particular physically important submanifold of soliton parameters @xmath150 , which is restricted by : a )  zero initial velocities of the solitons ; b )  initially equidistant solitons @xmath151 . condition a ) means that the diagonal elements in @xmath61 are purely imaginary @xmath152 ; from b ) there follows that @xmath153 for @xmath154 .",
    "it is clear that the initial soliton parameters determine @xmath61 , but the regimes of propagation are determined by the eigenvalues of @xmath61 .",
    "thus we consider various possible combinations of the latter .    *",
    "( i ) asymptotically free propagation .",
    "* choose @xmath155 , @xmath156 - generic .",
    "then we have :    [ eq : xa ] @xmath157 @xmath158 @xmath159 where @xmath160 @xmath161    obviously case ( i ) corresponds to asymptotically free motion of the pulses ; their velocities are determined by @xmath72 .",
    "this case was investigated in @xcite for @xmath162 type trains .",
    "we note that for this type of initial conditions the ctc reduces to the rtc , for which the asymptotically free regime is the only possible one .    *",
    "( ii ) three - soliton bound state . *",
    "choose @xmath163 and @xmath164 , @xmath165 .",
    "then we find the following periodic solutions of the ctc :    [ eq : c ] @xmath166 @xmath167 @xmath168 where @xmath169 @xmath170 @xmath171 @xmath172 and the signs plus and minus correspond to @xmath108 and @xmath109 respectively . obviously , if @xmath173 the trajectories of all three particles oscillate and the distance between them remains bounded .",
    "the corresponding period of the oscillations in @xmath106 is equal to @xmath174    thus we conclude that this case corresponds to a bound state of all three particles .",
    "the same property is shared also by the more complicated solution for which @xmath175 take generic values constrained only by @xmath176 . as we mentioned",
    "this solution of ctc will be periodic only if the ratio @xmath177 is a rational number .",
    "in the symmetrical case , i.e. for @xmath178 , @xmath179 , we can consider @xmath180 like in ( [ eq : ak ] ) and find that @xmath181 .",
    "the quasi - equidistant regime requires again @xmath182 .    from the explicit form of the solution we find :    [ eq : r - mm3 ] @xmath183 @xmath184 and consequently @xmath185    in terms of the soliton parameters we have : @xmath186 where @xmath187 .",
    "in particular , for @xmath108 one gets @xmath121 and : @xmath188 for @xmath127 analogously we get @xmath128 and : @xmath189 these formulas are very similar to the ones for the @xmath190 case ; note however that the value of @xmath191 is different from the one of @xmath192 . note also that the symmetrical case is a special one and takes place only when @xmath193 .",
    "if this is not the case , then the three soliton bound state can not be effectively reduced to the two - soliton one .",
    "like in the @xmath80 case , the motion will be quasi - equidistant if @xmath194 . both formulas ( [ eq : r - d03 ] ) , ( [ eq : r - d13 ] )",
    "show that an increase in @xmath133 diminishes @xmath195 .",
    "another way to diminish @xmath135 for fixed @xmath136 and @xmath141 is to increase the average amplitude @xmath196 ; this would diminish @xmath197 and as consequence , @xmath198 would also .",
    "these conclusions are illustrated on fig .",
    "1 where we have plotted the four functions defined by : @xmath199 for @xmath200 , @xmath201 and @xmath26 and @xmath202 take values @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "as one can easily see , for @xmath203 , @xmath117 is always less than @xmath204 .",
    "thus with an amplitude variation of just more than @xmath205 , it is possible to have a bound state with a rather low value of @xmath206 .",
    "the singular behavior of @xmath207 for @xmath208 corresponds to a singular solution of the ctc ; the numeric solution of the nls shows that the solitons do not collide , but come rather close to each other for the values of @xmath106 where the ctc solution develop singularities .",
    "we will return to this question in section  iii below .    on the other hand the singularity of @xmath209 for @xmath210 corresponds to the fact that at this critical point the quasi - equidistant regime switches over into the free motion regime .",
    "indeed , as we will see below , for @xmath211 we have regime ( i ) and the distance between the solitons grows infinitely , while for @xmath212 we get regime ( ii ) and a possible quasi - equidistant behavior .    *",
    "( iii ) mixed regime .",
    "* choose @xmath213 , @xmath214 .",

    "they both move with the same mean velocity and the distance between them is bounded ( as long as @xmath220 ) and is asymptotically a periodic function of time .    in the particular case",
    "when @xmath221 , we get a singular solution . indeed ,",

    "let us now describe the particular choices of the soliton parameters , which lead to the regimes described above .",

    "then it is possible to choose the parameters @xmath70 and @xmath65 in such a way that the corresponding solution of the ctc will describe @xmath17-particle bound state ; if , in addition , all the ratios @xmath292 are rational , the corresponding solution will be periodic in time .",
    "one may also find the conditions under which this solution will develop singularities for finite @xmath49 ( like @xmath293 or @xmath294 above ) .    obviously",
    ", there exist also all intermediary types of asymptotic .",
    "for example , if we have @xmath295 then we will get in the asymptotic an @xmath296-particle bound state and all the other particles will have free - motion asymptotic .",

    "the quantity showing how well the solution of the ctc fits the nls solution is given by the root mean square :    @xmath297    by @xmath298 above we have denoted the number of experimental points @xmath299 , at which the numerical values are calculated .    in the case of regime ( iii )",
    "we have also compared the mean values of the asymptotic velocities of the solitons calculated from nls and ctc .",
    "* @xmath1 . *",

    "it is realized when the two eigenvalues of @xmath69 are equal .",
    "this happens when @xmath300 and @xmath301 .",
    "this case is very difficult for observing numerically , however our data show that the value of @xmath302 is quite well predicted by ctc .    *",

    "it is known that the @xmath0-soliton solution of ( [ eq : pnlse ] ) is always analytic , i.e. does not possess any singularities .",
    "our numerical checks show that such sets of initial conditions correspond to solitons colliding ( for small @xmath305 ) or coming very close to each other ( for @xmath306 ) . in the regions , where this happens , the adiabatic approximation is no longer valid and the ctc does not match with the numeric solutions . for @xmath80",
    "our numerical calculations show that the first coalescence takes place at @xmath307 and the next ones tend to repeat periodically with period very close to @xmath308 ( [ eq : t2 ] ) .",
    "similar behavior is also found for @xmath309 with @xmath310 replaced by @xmath311 .",
    "for @xmath312 the picture quickly becomes rather complicated .",
    "our conclusion is that for such initial conditions the quasi - equidistant propagation of the solitons is maintained for a restricted period of @xmath313 .",
    "* @xmath314 .",
    "* numerical data for * regime ( i ) * for @xmath315 and @xmath316 close to @xmath253 was given in @xcite . in table",
    "ii we have collected data from runs for a variety of values for @xmath317 . from it",
    "we see a very good agreement between ctc and nls when @xmath318 is far from @xmath319 ; this value is critical for a transition from regime ( i ) to regime ( ii ) . in the vicinity of @xmath320",
    "the agreement is not too good , see case @xmath321 .",

    "the values of @xmath324 collected in table  iv for are rather low , especially for @xmath325 and @xmath326 and again we may call such propagation quasi - equidistant .    as in the @xmath1 case , the increasing of @xmath327 and @xmath39 leads to better agreement between nls and ctc ( see table  iii ) , and also leads to lower value of @xmath328 ( see table  iv ) .",
    "another fact illustrated in these tables is the better agreement for @xmath329 than for @xmath330 .",
    "* regime ( iii)*. this type of regime is only available when @xmath331 . in this case two of the solitons form ( nearly ) bound state and the third one has free propagation . examples of initial conditions leading to such type of regime are * iii.a ) * , * iii.b ) * and * iii.c)*. in table  v we show the quantity @xmath332 as a criterion of agreement between nls and ctc .",
    "the soliton parameters for these runs correspond to the case * iii.c ) * and regime ( iii ) must take place for all values of @xmath333 and @xmath253 .    another possibility to compare ctc and nls",
    "is given in table  vi where we show the mean values of the asymptotic velocities of each soliton .",
    "we see that ctc always shows that two of the solitons form a bound state .",
    "this is not always what nls shows , however the asymptotic values of the velocities of 2-nd and 3-rd solitons are quite close , so that we could consider it as a `` quasi - bound '' state .    if @xmath334 and @xmath301 then all eigenvalues of @xmath69 are equal and thus a degenerated case is realized .",
    "it is again very difficult to observe it numerically .",
    "the ctc gives logarithmically growing distance between solitons i.e. unbound state .",
    "* @xmath335*. the cases listed above can also be extended to larger number of solitons showing the same type of regimes ; of course now there are more mixed regimes possible . to analyze them one should solve the characteristic polynomial of @xmath69 and determine the soliton parameters , for which two or more of the @xmath336 s are different ( regime ( i ) ) or equal ( regimes ( iii ) and ( ii ) ) .",
    "more details about them will be published elsewhere .",
    "cases when the spectrum of @xmath59 becomes degenerate , i.e. when two ( or more ) of the eigenvalues @xmath70 become equal , deserve special attention and further investigations .    here",
    "we concentrate only on regime ( ii ) as the one which might be important in long range fiber optics communications . in tables",
    "iii and iv we compare ctc and nls for soliton trains @xmath337 with @xmath338 and @xmath339 , and @xmath80 to @xmath340 .",
    "the results listed in the table iv are from run lengths equal to @xmath341 in dimensionless units ; for regime ( ii ) we find periodic behavior with periods much less than @xmath342 and small amplitudes of oscillations given by @xmath206 . on several occasions",
    ", we extended the runs to lengths of @xmath343 and @xmath344 , the same type of behavior and the same results for @xmath206 .",
    "thus we conclude that these sets of initial parameters lead to a very stable behavior . indeed , taking the amplitudes of the solitons to",
    "be increasing by the same amount of @xmath136 we find for @xmath345 and @xmath346 , an equidistant behavior with error @xmath347 .    regime ( ii ) is characteristic also for such trains with @xmath348 .",
    "however in such cases where one has to consider soliton trains with large number of solitons , a configuration with continually increasing amplitudes becomes impractical .",
    "therefore we explore other possibilities for sets of initial soliton amplitudes .",
    "in fact , the first step towards the solution of this problem was to use a soliton train of in - phase solitons with alternating amplitudes @xmath349 and @xmath350 in @xcite and verified experimentally by @xcite .",
    "in @xcite the run length was equal to 141 .",
    "this idea was experimentally verified in @xcite where 20  gbit / s single channel soliton transmission over 11  500  km using alternating amplitude solitons was reported .",
    "to check this idea we made a series of runs of @xmath17 in - phase soliton trains with alternating amplitudes and @xmath81 to 8 , see table  vii .",
    "what we find is that the quasi - equidistant propagation takes place for @xmath351 with @xmath352 . for larger values of @xmath106 ,",
    "some of the solitons come rather close to each other .",
    "ctc also predicts the same type of behavior but with a larger value for @xmath353 . this is the reason why , in table  vii , the numerical data from nls shows non equidistant propagation for a run length of 300 .",
    "we extended some of these runs to lengths of 660 and 996 .",
    "the results for @xmath81 show a structure close to a periodic one with a period of about @xmath354 .",
    "so if the goal is to achieve a quasi - equidistant propagation to lengths @xmath355 then such configurations can be used . as an illustration of this fact , we have provided fig .  2 where a train of 8 solitons with alternating amplitudes is shown .",
    "we see , that in the regions where the solitons tend to coalesce , the match between ctc and nls is on a qualitative level .    as one can see from figs .  2 - 5 , there are two distinct time scales in these figures . first , there are the oscillations with periods on the order of 10 or so .",
    "but at the same time , one notes that there is in general a much longer time scale , one that is on the order of 250 or larger .",
    "it is the motions on this longer time scale that violate the equidistant propagation , see fig .  2 .",
    "note that in fig .  4 , when one can set the initial values so that the very long periodic motion is absent , then one has a very stable and equidistant motion .",
    "for larger run lengths , other configurations must be used , see also @xcite .    the next possibility which we explored was a `` saw - like '' configuration for the soliton amplitudes with three and four different amplitudes .",
    "the results are collected in table  viii for @xmath356 to 8 .",
    "we see that configurations with only three different amplitudes show basically the same behavior as the alternating amplitudes case ; the value of @xmath357 here is slightly larger , and again in the regions where the solitons tend to coalesce the match between ctc and nls is only qualitative , see fig .  3 .",
    "finally , for `` saw - like '' configurations of the amplitudes with four different amplitudes we get a substantially different picture .",
    "it seems that here the value of @xmath358 is much larger than in the previous two cases .",
    "the ctc model shows a quasi - equidistant behavior with the same small values of @xmath206 like in the last column of table  viii to run lengths of 12000 .",
    "the numeric solution of nls shows an excellent match with ctc to lengths of 1200 , see fig .",
    "a method for the description of the asymptotic behavior of the @xmath48-soliton pulse trains of the nls equation is proposed , based on the ctc model for the soliton interaction .",
    "it describes correctly several qualitatively different classes of asymptotic regimes .",
    "several sets of soliton parameters have been described for which the propagation is quasi - equidistant .",
    "such behavior with a conveniently low value for @xmath206 can be achieved by : a )  taking soliton trains with @xmath136 large enough .",
    "increasing @xmath359 too much may lead to violation of the condition ( [ eq : ksc ] ) of the adiabatic approximation .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , this nevertheless leads to a better agreement between the ctc and the nls ; b )  increasing the value @xmath138 of the average amplitude ; and c )  increasing the distance @xmath39 between the neighboring solitons .",
    "the critical values of the soliton parameters , for which one regime switches over to another one have been evaluated .",
    "we find that near these critical values , the match between ctc and nls becomes worse , as one would expect .",
    "these results have a natural generalization also for @xmath360 soliton trains .",
    "the ctc - model provides one with a tool for constructing sets of initial data for the @xmath17-soliton trains which will possess a given asymptotic trait , which is also determined by the eigenvalues @xmath361 of @xmath61 .",
    "the monotonically increasing amplitudes can not be used in case one wants to send trains with larger number of solitons .",
    "that is why we investigated also other possibilities for amplitudes for which the propagation is quasi - equidistant : alternating and `` saw - like '' configurations with three and four different values for @xmath362 .",
    "we find that the alternating amplitudes configuration and the `` saw - like '' one with three different amplitudes may provide quasi - equidistant propagation up to run lengths on the order of about 230 or 300 correspondingly .",
    "the `` saw - like '' configurations with four different amplitudes show quasi - equidistant behavior to even much larger run lengths .",
