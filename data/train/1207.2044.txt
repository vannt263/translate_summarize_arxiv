    "the edgeworth - kuiper belt objects , usually called trans - neptunian objects ( tnos ) orkuiper belt objects ( kbos ) , are known to be wellpreserved fossil remnants of our solar system formation . since the discovery of the first tno ( after pluto ) in 1992 by @xcite , various observational approaches to study the physical properties of tnos have been performed , including spectroscopic , photometric and binarity studies .",
    "our own approach to study these objects is to detect the periodic variation of their brightness as a function of time , resulting from their rotation @xcite .",
    "we analyse their rotational periods , surfaces , shapes and internal structures studying their light curves .",
    "less than 5 per cent of the known tnos have well - determined rotational periods .",
    "moreover , @xcite and @xcite pointed out that the sample of studied objects is highly biased towards bright objects , large variability amplitudes and short rotational periods . only 10 per cent of the rotational periods published",
    "are larger than 10 h. the majority of light curve amplitudes and rotational periods are published with large uncertainties or , sometimes , they are just estimations or limiting values .",
    "the sample of studied tnos is essentially composed of bright ( visual magnitude @xmath1022 mag ) and large objects .",
    "we can enumerate various reasons in order to explain some of these biases .",
    "first , we must point out observational limitations",
    ". a reliable study of tno rotational properties requires a lot of observational time on a medium to large telescope .",
    "this causes a bias towards brighter objects , but also short period and large amplitude.another class of limitations is due to reduction problems .",
    "a reliable photometric study needs effective data reduction . determining low - amplitude light curves and/or detecting long rotation periods are very time consuming and require a lot of observation time .",
    "furthermore , 24-h aliases frequently complicate the analysis of time - series photometry .    to help debias the sample of studied objects , longer term monitoring is needed .",
    "this kind of observations is based on the coordination of observational runs with various telescopes all around the world .",
    "using telescopes with similar characteristics in different continents allows us to observe a target ` continuously ' . in other words , if we can monitor our targets during a long time , we can detect long rotation periods and minimize the 24-h - aliases effect . in 2009 july",
    ", we carried out our first coordinated campaign between spain and chile .",
    "part of this work presents results based on this coordinated campaign for tnos .",
    "another part of this work is dedicated to our programme on light curves of tnos , started in 2001 . in this work ,",
    "we report our newest results based on observations carried out between 2008 and 2010 .",
    "this paper is divided into six sections .",
    "section 2 will describe the observations and the data set analysed here .",
    "section 3 will describe our reduction techniques used in order to derive periods and photometric ranges . in section 4",
    ", we will give , for each target , a summary of our main results .",
    "in section 5 , we will discuss our results altogether .",
    "section 6 is dedicated to the conclusion of this work .",
    "we present two different approaches to study the luminosity variability of tnos .",
    "we analysed data obtained from the coordinated campaign and data from our regular programme on light curves of kbos .      in 2009",
    "july , we carried out our first coordinated campaign involving europe and south america .",
    "typically , an observational night of july in europe starts around 22 h ut and finishes at 5 h ut , whereas an observational night in south america starts around 0 h ut and finishes at 10 h ut . under perfect conditions and if the target is visible in both sites during the entire night , we have five extra hours of observational time . by using this approach , we have a continuous time coverage of about 15 h , thereby addressing some of the biases against long periods and the issue of the 24-h aliases .",
    "we carefully coordinated the observations , to match exactly the field of view of both telescopes , during the campaign .    in europe",
    ", we used the telescopio nazionale galileo ( tng ) , located at the roque de los muchachos observatory ( la palma , canary islands , spain ) .",
    "images were obtained using the device optimized for the low resolution instrument ( dolores or lrs ) .",
    "this device has a camera and a spectrograph installed at the nasmyth b focus of the telescope .",
    "we observed in imaging mode with the r johnson filter and a 2@xmath122 binning mode .",
    "the camera is equipped with a 2048x2048 ccd with a pixel size of 13.5@xmath13 .",
    "the field of view is 8.6@xmath14@xmath128.6@xmath14 with a 0.252@xmath15/pix scale ( pixel scale for a 1@xmath121 binning ) .    in south america",
    ", we used the new technology telescope ( ntt ) , located at la silla observatory ( chile ) , equipped with the eso faint spectograph and camera ( version 2 ) or efosc2 mounted at the nasmyth b focus of the telescope .",
    "we observed in imaging mode with the r bessel filter and a 2@xmath122 binning mode .",
    "the camera is equipped with a 2048@xmath122048 ccd with a pixel size of 15x15@xmath13 ( pixel scale for a 1@xmath121 binning ) .",
    "the field of view is 5.2@xmath14@xmath125.2@xmath14 .      usually , we studied short - term variability thanks to our program on lightcurves of kbos at the sierra nevada observatory ( osn ) 1.5  m telescope .",
    "we present observations carried out at that telescope , at the 2.2  m and the 3.5  m centro astronomico hispano aleman ( caha ) telescopes at calar alto observatory ( almeria , spain ) and at the 82  cm telescope of the instituto de astrofsica de canarias ( iac-80 telescope ) located at the teide observatory ( tenerife , canary islands , spain ) .",
    "the osn observations were carried out by means of a 2k@xmath122k ccd , with a total field of view of 7.8@xmath14@xmath127.8@xmath14 .",
    "we used a 2@xmath122 binning mode , which changes the image scale to 0.46@xmath15/pixel ( pixel scale for a 2@xmath122 binning ) .",
    "for our caha observations , we used the calar alto faint object spectrograph ( cafos ) at the 2.2  m telescope and the large area imager for calar alto ( laica ) at the 3.5  m telescope .",
    "cafos is equipped with a 2048@xmath122048 pixel ccd and image scale is 0.53\" / pixel ( pixel scale for a 1@xmath121 binning ) .",
    "laica is equipped with a 2@xmath122 mosaic of 4k@xmath124k ccds and its total field of view is 44.36@xmath14@xmath1244.36@xmath14 and the pixel scale is 0.225@xmath15/pixel .",
    "we also present here a few observations carried out at the iac-80 telescope .",
    "it is equipped with a 2k@xmath122k ccd camera with a 13.5@xmath1213.5  @xmath13/pixel size ( pixel scale for a 1@xmath121 binning ) , installed at the cassegrain primary focus .",
    "its total field of view is 10.6@xmath14@xmath1210.6@xmath14 .",
    "exposure times were chosen by considering two main factors .",
    "on one hand , it had to be long enough to achieve a signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) sufficient to study the observed object ( s / n@xmath1620 ) .",
    "on the other hand , the exposure time had to be short enough to avoid elongated images of the target ( when the telescope was tracked at sidereal speed ) or elongated field stars ( if the telescope was tracked at the tno rate of motion ) .",
    "we always chose to track the telescope at sidereal speed .",
    "the drift rates of tnos are typically low , @xmath172@xmath15/h , so exposure times around 300600 s were typically used .    the osn , calar alto and iac-80 observations reported in this work were performed without a filter in order to maximize the s / n . the main goal of our study is short - term variability via relative photometry .",
    "therefore , the use of unfiltered images without absolute calibration is not a problem for our work .",
    "the r bessel and r johnson filters were used during our observations at the ntt and tng , respectively .",
    "these filters were chosen to maximize the s / n on tnos while minimizing the fringing that appears at longer wavelengths on images from these instruments .",
    "the targets of our regular programme are typically brighter than 21 mag in v. during our coordinated campaign , we also had the opportunity to use 4 m class telescopes to observe fainter objects and select targets with visual magnitudes between 21 and 22.5 mag .",
    "relevant geometric information about the observed objects on the dates of observations , the number of images and filters used is summarized in table 1",
    "during most observing nights , a series of biases and flat - fields were obtained to correct the instrumental signature from the images .",
    "we thus created a median bias and a median flat - field frame for each night of observation .",
    "care was taken not to use bias or flat - field frames that might be affected by observational or acquisition problems .",
    "the median flat - fields were assembled from twilight dithered images and the results were inspected for possible residuals from very bright saturated stars .",
    "the flat - field exposure times were always long enough to ensure that no shutter effect was present , so that a gradient or an artefact of some sort could be present in the corrected images .",
    "each target image was bias subtracted and flat - fielded using the median bias and median flat - field of the observation night .",
    "if daily information about bias and/or flat - field was not available , we used the median bias and median flat - field of a former or subsequent night .",
    "relative photometry using between 6 and 25 field stars was carried out by means of daophot routines @xcite .",
    "care was taken not to introduce spurious results due to faint background stars or galaxies in the aperture .",
    "no cosmic ray removal algorithms were used .",
    "we rejected images in which the target is affected by a cosmic ray hit or by a nearby star.we used common reduction software for photometry data reduction of all the images adjusting the details of the parameters to the specificity of each data set .",
    "the choice of the aperture radius is important .",
    "we had to choose an aperture as small as possible to obtain the highest s / n by minimizing the contribution from the sky , but large enough to include most of the flux of the tno .",
    "typically , we repeated the measurement using a set of apertures with radii around the full width at half - maximum , and also adaptable aperture radius ( aperture radius is varying according to the seeing conditions of each image , and so , the aperture radius is different for each image ) .",
    "then , we have to consider two factors in order to choose the best data reduction : the aperture size and the reference stars used .",
    "for all apertures used , we chose the results giving the lowest scatter in the photometry of both targets and stars .",
    "several sets of reference stars were used to establish the relative photometry of all the targets . in many cases ,",
    "several stars had to be rejected from the analysis because they showed some variability .",
    "finally , the set that gave the lowest scatter was used for the final result .",
    "the final photometry of our targets was computed by taking the median of all the light curves obtained with respect to each reference star . by applying this technique ,",
    "spurious results were eliminated and the dispersion of photometry was improved .    during the observational campaigns , we tried to stick to the same field of view , and therefore to the same reference stars , for each observed target . in some cases , due to the drift of the observed object , the field changed completely or partially .",
    "if the field changed completely , we used different reference stars for two or three subsets of nights in the entire run .",
    "if the field changed partially , we tried to keep the greatest number of common reference stars during the whole campaign . in the case of our coordinated campaign using two telescopes",
    ", we tried to observe the same field of view with both telescopes for any given target . in this way",
    ", we can use the same reference stars and do a better job in image processing and analysis .",
    "when we combined data from several observing runs , we normalized the photometry data to their average because we did not have absolute photometry allowing us to link runs . by normalizing over the averages of several runs",
    ", we assume that a similar number of data points are in the upper and lower part of the curves . this may not be so if runs were only two or three nights long , which is not usually the case .",
    "we wish to emphasize that we normalized to the average of each run and not the average of each night      we computed approximate r magnitudes for a few images per object per observational run .",
    "namely , we computed approximate magnitudes for the osn data of 2004  nt@xmath3 and for all observations of 2002  tc@xmath6 , 2002  tx@xmath2 , 2004  xa@xmath4 , and 2005  uq@xmath5 . in order to obtain approximate r - magnitudes , we used usno - b1 stars in the field of view as photometric references . since the usno - b1 magnitudes are not standard bvri magnitudes and since we also did not use bvri filters , we derived very approximate magnitudes , with typical uncertainties of @xmath170.4  mag .    during our observations at the tng and at the ntt ,",
    "the r johnson and the r bessel filters were used , respectively .",
    "we are able to report an absolute photometry of all the data carried out during the coordinated campaign .    for absolute photometry , each image was reduced using standard techniques of calibration , as presented in this section ( bias subtraction and flat - field correction ) . during each night of observations ,",
    "landolt standard stars @xcite were observed at different air masses in order to calculate the calibration parameters such as photometric zero - point and first - order extinction coefficients .",
    "tnos are very faint objects , so the choice of the aperture in order to calculate the flux , or magnitude , is important . in fact , the aperture must be big enough to collect all the flux of the target without introducing the contaminating flux of the background .",
    "we computed their fluxes using a small aperture and corrected for the flux loss by means of the aperture correction @xcite .",
    "we used between 5 and 15 stars in each field of view in order to compute the aperture correction for each object . the object aperture radius varied between 3 and 5 pixels , depending on the brightness of the target and on the night conditions .",
    "we chose the aperture that gave the highest s / n for each object by computing the growth curve of some stars @xcite .",
    "+      the final time - series photometry of each target was inspected for periodicities by means of the lomb technique @xcite as implemented in @xcite , but we also checked results by means of several other time series analysis techniques , such as phase dispersion minimization ( pdm ) , and clean technique @xcite .",
    "@xcite method and its improvement described in @xcite was also used ( hereafter called pravec - harris method ) .    as mentioned before",
    ", the reference stars were also inspected for short - term variability and we can thus be confident that no error has been introduced by the choice of reference stars . finally , in order to measure the amplitudes of short - term variability , we performed fourier fits to the data to determine the peak - to - peak amplitudes ( or full amplitudes ) .",
    "in this section , we present our short - term variability results summarized in table 2 . the lomb periodograms and lightcurves for all objects",
    "are provided in figure 1 to figure 21 .",
    "we plotted all lightcurves over two periods .",
    "times for zero phase , without light time correction , are reported in table  2 .",
    "for each lightcurves , a fourier series is used to fit the photometric data .",
    "error bars for the measurements are not shown on the plots for clarity but one - sigma error bars on the relative magnitudes are reported in the online version of table 3 .",
    "absolute magnitudes are also provided in the online version of table 3 .",
    "the following subsections are dedicated to the short - term variability of our targets .",
    "we organized our results according to the gladman dynamical classification @xcite .",
    "the time base ( time coverage between the first and the last image of the object ) of the 2009 data from the ntt is around 10.2 h split in two nights .",
    "the time base of our 2010 data is shorter ; 2.3 h in three nights of observations . for our 2009 data set ,",
    "the lomb periodogram , pdm and clean techniques suggested a rotational period of around 5.8 h. the pravec ",
    "harris technique inferred a double rotational period around 11.6 h. our 2010 data set is clearly too short for a period search .",
    "the lomb periodogram ( fig .",
    "1 ) of our two data sets showed three groups of peaks : the first one , with the highest confidence level , suggested a rotational period of around 5.84 h , the second one around 4.61 h and the last one around 7.25 h. the clean technique confirmed a periodic signature at 5.84@xmath180.34  h. however , pdm presented a single - peaked period of 7.21@xmath180.39  h , and the pravec - harris technique a period around 14.4@xmath180.6  h and a possible rotational period of 5.84@xmath180.34  h. the best - fitting lightcurve is obtained for a period of 5.84  h ( fig .",
    "2 ) because the alternative fits show more scatter .",
    "the amplitude of the lightcurve is large , 0.49@xmath180.03  mag assuming a 5.84  h periodicity . assuming that large amplitudes ( @xmath160.15  mag ) are mainly due to shape effects",
    ", we must consider the double - peaked lightcurve ( see section 5 ) .",
    "then , if 5.84  h is our preferred photometric period , a preferred rotational period of 11.68  h ( 2@xmath125.84 ) is deduced .    to our knowledge ,",
    "a previous study of this target , based on 13 images obtained in around 5  h of observations , was done by @xcite who suggested a rotational period of 12.2@xmath184.3  h and an amplitude of 0.66@xmath180.38  mag .",
    "we conclude , in agreement with @xcite , that 2001  qy@xmath0 has a moderately long rotational period and a very high amplitude .",
    "we must point out that 2001  qy@xmath0 has a satellite .",
    "this system is an asynchronous binary system because the primary has a much smaller rotational period than the orbital one .",
    "both components of the system are not resolved in our data , so , we are measuring the magnitude of the pair .",
    "the satellite has a long orbital period : 138.11@xmath180.02  days and it is orbiting at a distance of 9960@xmath1830  km from the primary @xcite . the magnitude difference between 2001  qy@xmath0 and",
    "its satellite is 0.42@xmath180.07 @xcite . due to the orbital and physical characteristics of the system , the satellite contribution to the lightcurve is negligible .",
    "we observed this target along @xmath1710  h during three nights at the ntt and 0.2  h at the tng .",
    "the lomb peridogram ( fig .",
    "3 ) shows a peak with a high confidence level at 4.29  h ( 5.59  cycles / day ) and two aliases , with a lower confidence level , at 5.25  h ( 4.57  cycles / day ) and at 3.69  h ( 6.49  cycles / day ) .",
    "all the techniques used confirmed a photometric rotational period of 4.29  h or 5.25  h with a similar confidence level . assuming that the lightcurve is essentially due to the shape of the target",
    ", we must consider the double peaked one : the rotational period of 2002  kw@xmath1 should be 8.58  h or 10.5  h. our preferred period is 8.58  h , corresponding to an amplitude of 0.21@xmath180.03  mag ( fig .",
    "4 ) . however , also a lightcurve fit assuming a rotational period of 10.5  h with an amplitude of 0.26@xmath180.03  mag is possible .",
    "the 2003 data set is already published in @xcite in which we concluded that the rotational period of this object should be 8.14@xmath180.02  h. @xcite published a rotational period of 7.89@xmath180.03 and @xcite presented a 8.12  h or a 12.1  h single - peaked rotational lightcurve .    in fig .",

    "we note a peak with a high confidence level at 4.08  h ( 5.89  cycles / day ) . all used techniques confirmed this period , except pravec - harris method which favored a double peaked period at 8.15  h ( 2.94  cycles / day ) .",
    "a double peaked lightcurve seems to be the best option and it is presented in fig .",

    "in fact , during the first two nights , we managed to coordinate observations from the canary islands and chile , observing this body on the first night during 2.2  h at the tng , and around 4  h at the ntt , allowing us to study close to a half - period on one single coordinated night .",
    "finally , with less than 50 images in 4 nights , we could reliably estimate the moderately long rotational period for this object .",
    "detection and reliable estimations of long rotational periods were one of the goals of this coordinated campaign .",
    "we would have probably needed many more images and detection of this long periodicity would have probably been difficult without a coordinated campaign .",
    "thus we consider our first coordinated campaign as a successful beginning .    as a general feature of our results ,",
    "we report that the average amplitude of our sample is 0.13  mag .",
    "we note that in our 10 objects sample , only 2 have amplitudes larger than 0.15  mag . @xcite and @xcite suggested a threshold of 0.15  mag in order to distinguish among lightcurve variations due to albedo or due to the shape of the target because the best fits to maxwellian distributions were obtained with that assumption .",
    "low amplitudes can be explained by albedo heterogeneity on the surface of a maclaurin spheroid , while large amplitudes of variability are probably due to the shape of an elongated jacobi body . according to this assumption",
    ", we introduce the criterion to consider that a high lightcurve amplitude of a large object may be attributed to a non spherical shape ( typically a triaxial ellipsoid ) . in this case , we prefer the double peaked lightcurve to represent a complete rotation of the object",
    ". we must point out that to distinguish between shape and albedo contribution in a lightcurve is not trivial at all . in table 2",
    ", we indicate the rotational periods obtained from data reduction ( preferred photometric period ) and the preferred rotational period assuming our criterion .",
    "for example , in the case of 2001  qy@xmath0 , our data analysis suggests a rotational period of 5.84  h , but given an amplitude larger than 0.15  mag , the amplitude variation is probably due to the shape of the object and we prefer the double peaked period , 11.68  h ( 2@xmath125.84  h ) as true rotational period of the object .    in fig .",
    "22 , we plot the lightcurve peak - to - peak amplitude versus the absolute magnitude of results shown in this work and already published in @xcite . as shown in fig .",
    "22 , the majority of studied objects present a low amplitude , typically @xmath10  0.15  mag . in fact , except some cases like 2001  qy@xmath0 , most tnos have a low amplitude .",
    "we found an average amplitude of 0.09  mag , 0.11  mag , 0.12  mag and 0.10  mag for , respectively , the scattered / detached , the resonant , the classical and the centaur groups .",
    "so , there is not a dynamical group with a higher / smaller amplitude in our database .",
    "we must point out that the lack of long rotational periods , previously mentioned in @xcite seems to be confirmed by this new work .",
    "in fact , except 2005  tb@xmath8 and probably 2001  qy@xmath0 , all our targets present a rotational period @xmath1010  h.    assuming tnos in general as triaxial ellipsoids , with axes a@xmath16b@xmath16c ( rotating along c ) , the lightcurve amplitude , @xmath19 , varies as a function of the observational angle @xmath20 ( the angle between the rotation axis and the line of sight ) according to @xcite : @xmath21 we computed a lower limit for the object elongation ( a / b ) , assuming an equatorial view ( @xmath20 = 90@xmath11 ) @xmath22 according to @xcite study of figures of equilibrium for fluid bodies , we can estimate lower limits for densities from rotational periods and the elongation of objects .",
    "that is to say , assuming that a given tno is a triaxial ellipsoid in hydrostatic equilibrium ( a jacobi ellipsoid ) , we can compute a lower density limit .",
    "this study is summarized in fig .",
    "23 which is an update of fig .",
    "7 of @xcite . in our sample",
    ", only two bodies have a high amplitude lightcurve ( @xmath160.15  mag ) and can be assumed to be jacobi ellipsoids : 2001  qy@xmath0 and 2002  kw@xmath1 .",
    "2001  qy@xmath0 has a very low density if it is in hydrostatic equilibrium and 2002  kw@xmath1 seems to have a density between 0.5 and 1  g @xmath23 . using equation 1 ,",
    "we compute the lower limit for the densities of these two bodies , assuming a viewing angle of 60@xmath11 .. ] the results are reported in table 2 .",
    "most of our targets have low - amplitude lightcurves , probably due to albedo effects .",
    "so , they are probably maclaurin spheroids and the study on lower limit densities can not be applied .",
    "in fact , most of observed objects are far from the theoretical curves for acceptable values for the density which indicates that those objects are likely maclaurin spheroids or are not in hydrostatic equilibrium ( fig .",
    "+ tnos densities are an important physical characteristic . unfortunately , their estimation is complicated and usually obtained just for binary and multiple systems .",
    "the range of published densities varies from around 1  g @xmath23 for varuna @xcite to 4.2@xmath181.3  g  @xmath23 for quaoar @xcite ( however , a recent stellar occultation by quaoar indicates that quaoar density is probably much smaller than published one @xcite ) .",

    "we can derive the geometric albedo , p@xmath36 , that is given by the equation : @xmath37 c@xmath36 is a constant depending on the wavelength @xcite , and h is the absolute magnitude .",

    "+ assuming spherical shapes and densities between 500 and 2000  kg@xmath28m@xmath29 , @xcite published an albedo range of 0.13 - 0.32 .",
    "they also reported a primary radius ranging from 64 to 100  km ( values obtained assuming spherical shapes and densities between 500 and 2000  kg@xmath28m@xmath29 ) .",
    "due to the facts that 2001  qy@xmath0 has a low inclination ( 1.5@xmath11 , according to the minor planet center ( mpc ) database ) and a high albedo , @xcite concluded that this body belongs to a more excited class of small tnos @xcite .",

    "both studies , ( @xcite and our estimation ) are preliminary , but _ herschel space observatory _ key program  tno s are cool ! \" estimated the albedo and the size of this binary object @xcite .",
    "various models can be enumerated in order to explain the formation of binary or multiple systems .",
    "models based on gravitational capture have already been presented @xcite , as well as models based on low velocity collision between kuiper belt objects @xcite or the gravitational collapse model @xcite .",
    "recently , the possibility of rotational fission in the kuiper belt has been considered in @xcite .",
    "+ we computed the specific angular momentum of 2001  qy@xmath0 system using the formula published in @xcite and the scaled spin rate according to @xcite .",
    "the specific angular momentum of this binary is 1.61@xmath180.13 and its scaled spin rate is 0.61@xmath180.01 ( specific angular momentum and scaled spin rate are adimensional values ) .",
    "those values seem to indicate that the 2001  qy@xmath0 binary system was not formed by rotational fission .",
    "in fact , the high value of the specific angular momentum and the scaled spin rate of this system do not fall into the ",
    "high size ratio binaries \" region indicated in the fig . 1 of @xcite .",
    "so , we can probably discard a possible rotational fission origin for this binary .",
    "we can not favor any other formation scenario ; this system could have been formed by capture and/or collision , or gravitational collapse .",
    "the last part of this section is dedicated to two examples of solar phase curves .",
