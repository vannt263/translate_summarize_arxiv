    "<S> we generalize the scattering theory of quantum shot noise to include the full spin - density matrix of electrons injected from a spin - filtering or ferromagnetic electrode into a quantum - coherent nanostructure governed by various spin - dependent interactions . </S>",
    "<S> this formalism yields the spin - resolved shot noise power for different experimental measurement setups  with ferromagnetic source and ferromagnetic or normal drain electrodes  whose evaluation for the diffusive multichannel quantum wires with the rashba ( so ) spin - orbit coupling shows how spin decoherence and dephasing lead to substantial enhancement of charge current fluctuations ( characterized by fano factors @xmath0 ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , these processes and the corresponding shot noise increase are suppressed in narrow wires , so that charge transport experiments measuring the fano factor @xmath1 in a ferromagnet / so - coupled - wire / paramagnet setup also quantify the degree of phase - coherence of transported spin  we predict a one - to - one correspondence between the magnitude of the spin polarization vector and @xmath1 . </S>"
