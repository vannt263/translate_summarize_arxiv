    "a gamma ray burst ( grb ) afterglow is produced by the interaction of the grb jet with the circumburst medium in which it is immersed . an afterglow spectrum is composed of a series of power laws separated by breaks @xcite , and is produced when electrons in the circumburst medium spiral around the tangled and compressed magnetic field lines present at the shock boundary between the jet and the circumburst medium . in this manner , the kinetic energy of the jet is gradually converted into radiation and particle energy @xcite .",
    "the properties of the jet- including its initial kinetic energy , mass , and half - opening angle- only partially determine the temporal evolution of the afterglow . because the afterglow luminosity is dependent upon the density of the circumburst medium , the nature of that medium ( i.e. , whether it is wind - like or a uniform density ism ) plays a crucial role in determining the temporal evolution as well @xcite .",
    "analytical models of relativistic jets in power law mediums ( @xmath0 , with @xmath1 for a uniform density and @xmath2 for a wind ) have yielded light curves that are in reasonable agreement with observations @xcite .",
    "semi - analytic models developed by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite have been used to estimate parameters of the grb 030329 radio afterglow , including the isotropic equivalent energy @xmath3 , the electron spectral index @xmath4 , the electron and magnetic field energy fractions ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively ) , and the jet half - opening angle @xmath7 , using broadband radio observations over the course of the first year .",

    "the broadband afterglow is modelled using a method developed in @xcite .",
    "at a redshift of @xmath11 @xcite , the gamma - ray burst grb 030329 is one of the closest grbs detected to date . assuming a @xmath12 cosmology with @xmath13 km s@xmath14 mpc@xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 , grb 030329 is located at an angular distance of @xmath17 mpc , with 1.0 mas corresponding to 2.85 pc .",
    "the burst was first detected on march 29th , 2003 at 11:37 utc by the high energy transient explore 2 ( _ hete-2 _ ) satellite , and was subsequently localized in the optical by @xcite . the grb 030329 radio afterglow was ( and still is ) the most luminous afterglow to ever have been observed , achieving a maximum flux density of @xmath18 mjy at @xmath19 ghz one week after the burst .",
    "the relative proximity of the burst to the earth , coupled with its extremely high luminosity , made it possible for the radio afterglow to be directly resolved by the very long baseline array ( vlba ) and the global vlbi array at @xmath20 ghz @xcite .",
    "additionally , the @xmath20 ghz radio afterglow was detected by the vla for 8.3 years .",
    "grb 030329 has therefore provided a unique opportunity to study the evolution of both the luminosity and the physical size of a grb afterglow",
    "we compare our model to observations of the grb 030329 radio afterglow luminosity .",
    "in addition to previously published data , we include late - period @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 ghz observations , taken from the nrao data archive , that were made between 621 and 3018 days after the burst ( see table [ vlaobservations ] ) .",

    "the evolution of the jet is identical to the case where the grb outflow is isotropic until @xmath75 , when the center of the jet comes into causal contact with its edge . for a jet with half - opening angle @xmath76 ,",

    "we find that the best fit of a uniform density model to the broadband radio afterglow predicts values for the burst parameters that are similar to the values that are obtained when a stellar wind density profile is assumed .",
    "the goodness of fit @xmath108 of the model that assumes a uniform density medium , however , is better by a factor of @xmath205 than the goodness of fit of the wind model , suggesting that a uniform medium is preferred over a stellar wind .",
    "this is in agreement with previous work @xcite , but runs contrary to what is expected if grbs have stellar progenitors .    the best - fit wind and uniform density models were fitted to the observed average apparent afterglow lateral expansion rate and are both in good agreement with the data .",
    "the uniform density model agrees nicely with our estimate of @xmath103 , while the wind model does not , again suggesting that the circumburst medium is more characteristic of a uniform ism than a stellar wind .",
    "the ability to determine the initial lorentz factor of a grb jet provides a powerful constraint on models of the burst evolution .",
    "the initial lorentz factor of the burst determines the time @xmath93 when the jet transitions to non - relativistic expansion as well as the jet s initial lateral expansion rate . by fitting the afterglow expansion history to determine @xmath204 , we limit the parameter space from which we can build a model of the broadband afterglow . in the case of grb 030329 ,",
    "this means that no stellar wind environment remains that can be used as a suitable model of the circumburst medium . in order to determine the initial lorentz factor , however , we must have enough observations of the afterglow image size to determine @xmath93",
    "the grb 030329 afterglow is currently the only gamma ray burst afterglow to have been directly resolved . in the future ,",
    "more luminous , low - redshift bursts will need to be imaged with vlbi so that combined afterglow and lateral expansion evolution fitting can be applied beyond the case of grb 030329 .",

    "<S> we perform calorimetry on the bright gamma ray burst ( grb ) 030329 by fitting simultaneously the broadband radio afterglow and the observed afterglow image size to a semi - analytic magnetohydrodynamical ( mhd ) and afterglow emission model . </S>",
    "<S> our semi - analytic method is valid in both the relativistic and non - relativistic regimes , and incorporates a model of the interstellar scintillation that substantially effects the broadband afterglow below 10 ghz . </S>",
    "<S> the model is fitted to archival measurements of the afterglow flux from 1 day to 8.3 years after the burst . </S>",
    "<S> values for the initial burst parameters are determined and the nature of the circumburst medium is explored . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , direct measurements of the lateral expansion rate of the radio afterglow image size allow us to estimate the initial lorentz factor of the jet . </S>"
