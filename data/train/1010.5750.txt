    "the hydrophobic effect is presumed to be an important driving force in biology and nanoscale self - assembly.@xcite because of its collective nature and its length - scale dependence,@xcite and because of its nonlocal dependence on solute surface moeities,@xcite modeling the hydrophobic effect remains a challenge . to treat it theoretically , one could track the explicit position of possibly tens of thousands of water molecules around solutes of interest,@xcite but the computational cost of this approach limits its applications . alternatively , at significantly reduced cost , one could replace explicit waters by an implicit solvent model , as is done in the generalized born and surface area ( gbsa ) approach.@xcite in this paper , building on previous efforts,@xcite we propose a coarse - grained model intermediate in detail between these two extremes , one that retains most of the computational advantage of implicit solvent models and overcomes two of their significant conceptual flaws : their incorrect scaling behavior and their neglect of rare but large solvent density fluctuations that play pivotal roles in the dynamics of assembly .    solvation free energies@xcite of solutes with sub - nanometer features , exactly the size prevalent in biological regimes , do not in general@xmath0cal / mol / @xmath1/nm@xmath2 range,@xcite in contrast to the water - air surface tension of about  @xmath3/nm@xmath2 and the water - oil surface tension of about  @xmath4 nm@xmath2 : see ref .  .",

    "numerous studies of hydrophobicity@xcite have shown that rare solvent motions and dewetting transitions in confining environments play a critical role in solute assembly and function .",

    "the gbsa model,@xcite widely used in biological settings , captures the effect of electrostatics with reasonable accuracy , but its treatment of the hydrophobic effect is less adequate,@xcite for the reasons discussed above .",
    "interesting examples of solutes for which hydrophobicity is essential , and for which gbsa is unsuitable , include large classes of proteins , such as those involved in transmembrane protein recognition and insertion,@xcite and versatile chaperones.@xcite it is these kinds of solutes for which our approach may eventually prove most useful .",
