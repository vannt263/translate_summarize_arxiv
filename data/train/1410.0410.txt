    "the phenomenon of neutrino oscillations has been found to be the leading description of neutrino flavor transitions . in the last decades ,",
    "a vast amount of neutrino oscillation experiments have been performed and these experiments have been able to pin down the fundamental neutrino oscillation parameters to a good accuracy",
    ". however , despite the success of this description and due to the increasing precision of these experiments , there might be room for subleading new physics effects known as non - standard neutrino interactions ( nsis ) @xcite . basically , nsis give rise to dimension - six and higher - order operators , which lead to effective nsi parameters , and they arise in all modern extensions of the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "it is important to note that both experimental and phenomenological bounds have been determined on such nsi parameters . in principle",
    ", nsis can affect both production and detection processes and propagation in matter .    in this work",
    ", we will be interested in atmospheric neutrinos and therefore we will consider the matter nsi parameters @xmath0 , @xmath5 , and @xmath4 phenomenologically , which are important for neutrino oscillations in the @xmath6-@xmath7 sector .",
    "this means that we will set the other matter nsi parameters to zero , i.e.  @xmath8 for @xmath9 .",
    "using the so - called two - flavor hybrid model and atmospheric neutrino data from the super - kamiokande i and ii experiments , the following experimental bounds have been obtain at 90  % confidence level ( c.l . )",
    "@xcite @xmath10 in addition , accelerator neutrino data from the minos experiment have set the bound @xmath11 at 90  % c.l .",
    "@xcite , which is less restrictive compared with the super - kamiokande bound on the same parameter .",
    "note that the corresponding model - independent phenomenological bounds on three matter nsi parameters for earth matter are given by @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 @xcite , where the last two bounds translate into a bound for @xmath1 , which is less stringent than the above - mentioned experimental bound .",
    "this is particularly true for the bound on @xmath15 .",
    "the main reason is that the model - independent phenomenological bound on @xmath15 comes from the one - loop contribution to the invisible @xmath16-decay width at lep , and is relatively lower compared to the bounds on other matter nsi parameters , since they are constrained by data from the charged lepton sector as well . on the other hand , the super - kamiokande bounds on the matter nsi parameters are indirect bounds coming from the role of the matter nsi parameters in neutrino oscillations and this is not necessarily poor for @xmath15 .",
    "therefore , the experimental bounds found by the super - kamiokande collaboration are the most stringent bounds on the three matter nsi parameters in the @xmath6-@xmath7 sector , which we will refer to in the rest of this work .    outside the experimental collaborations , the role of matter nsi parameters in atmospheric neutrino experiments has been considered in a number of publications ( see refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in particular , constraints on @xmath0 and @xmath1 were obtained from an analysis of the data from icecube-79 and deepcore @xcite . in order to further investigate the discussed bounds on nsis",
    ", we will use pingu @xcite , which is a proposed upgrade of the icecube experiment at the south pole .",
    "pingu will be a huge experiment that will observe atmospheric neutrinos and probe high energies .",
    "it has been designed to measure the neutrino mass hierarchy , but it should also be able to reveal effects of nsis . in this work , we will therefore use pingu to predict bounds on the nsi parameters . the neutrino oscillation probabilities and predicted muon event rates from atmospheric neutrinos at pingu in the energy range between 1  gev and 20  gev have been discussed in ref .",
    "the impact of nsi parameters on the muon neutrino survival probability is known to grow with the increase of the neutrino energy .",
    "therefore , we expect better constraints at higher energies . however , the atmospheric neutrino fluxes go down as about @xmath17 , and thus reducing the statistical significance of the data at higher energies .",
    "pingu being a multi - megaton class ice detector will have better statistics . therefore , in this work , we extend the previous study performed in ref .  @xcite by increasing the energy range up to 100  gev . however , in the previous study all matter nsi parameters were considered ( except for @xmath5 ) , whereas here we focus on the matter nsi parameters @xmath0 and @xmath4 .",
    "we consider detector effective volume and resolution functions as quoted in the pingu letter of intent @xcite and include systematic uncertainties in the atmospheric neutrino fluxes in our analysis .",
    "we determine improved upper bounds on some nsi parameters using three years of running of the pingu atmospheric neutrino experiment as described in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "this work is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : differences ] , we discuss in detail the differences between standard and non - standard neutrino oscillation probabilities that are crucial for the understanding of the importance of nsis .",
    "we focus on the analytical form of the @xmath18 survival probability and its corresponding matter nsi parameters @xmath0 , @xmath5 , and @xmath4 .",
    "then , in section  [ sec : events ] , we compute the difference in the number of muon events from atmospheric neutrinos with and without nsi parameters . next , in section  [",
    "sec : analysis ] , we perform a statistical analysis for the proposed pingu experiment and determine improved upper bounds on the nsi parameters @xmath0 and @xmath4",
    ". finally , in section  [ sec : s&c ] , we summarize our results and draw our conclusions .",
    "in the case of three - flavor neutrino oscillations in matter , the expressions for ordinary neutrino oscillation probabilities are lengthy , and including nsis , the expressions become even lengthier . in the standard framework ,",
    "the neutrino oscillation probabilities are functions of eight parameters ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 ; @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 ) ( where @xmath19 is the neutrino baseline length and @xmath20 is the neutrino energy ) , whereas for matter nsis , they will be depending on six additional parameters . in general , differences between standard and non - standard neutrino oscillation probabilities will therefore depend on 14 parameters , i.e.  we have @xmath27    expanding the @xmath18 survival probability difference @xmath28 to zeroth order in the parameter ratio @xmath29 and the mixing parameter @xmath30 as well as to first order in the nsi parameters , one obtains @xcite @xmath31 \\nonumber\\\\ & + & ( |\\varepsilon_{\\mu\\mu}| - |\\varepsilon_{\\tau\\tau}| ) a \\sin^2 ( 2\\theta_{23 } ) \\cos(2\\theta_{13 } ) \\left [ \\delta \\sin(\\delta)/2 - 2 \\sin^2 ( \\delta/2)\\right ] \\",

    "the fit is performed by marginalizing over the standard oscillation parameters @xmath26 , @xmath132 , and @xmath133 , with priors imposed on them as described in the text .",
    "the black dots denote the points at which the `` data '' were considered .",
    "the allowed area for a given data set is unique and exists around the ( black ) point where the data were considered .",
    "normal neutrino mass hierarchy was assumed to be true for all four cases .",

    "[ fig : cont ] , we display the 90  % ( red ) , 95  % ( orange ) , and 99  % ( yellow ) c.l .",
    "contours in the @xmath0-@xmath4 plane , which are expected from three years of running of pingu .",
    "the four patches in this figure correspond to four different data sets considered for the assumed true values of the nsi parameters @xmath143 that equal to @xmath144 , @xmath145 , @xmath146 , and @xmath147 .",
    "these are shown by black dots in the figure .",
    "in addition , we have assumed normal neutrino mass hierarchy for all cases .",
    "the fit is marginalized over the standard oscillation parameters @xmath26 , @xmath132 , and @xmath133 .",
    "the allowed area for a given data set is unique and exists around the ( black ) point where the data were considered .",
    "note that the shape of the contours changes as we change the assumed allowed set of true values for @xmath143 .",
    "the allowed range of @xmath4 decreases as the true value of @xmath4 increases , irrespective of the true value of @xmath0 .",
    "the change is less marked on the allowed range of @xmath0 .",
    "however , one still obtains a larger allowed range for @xmath0 if the nsi parameters were non - zero compared to the case when there are no nsis .",
    "this figure shows more expected allowed ranges for @xmath0 and @xmath4 at any given c.l .",
    "than fig .",
    "[ fig : diff1 ] for two reasons .",
    "firstly , both @xmath0 and @xmath4 are varying in the fit , and secondly , the definition of c.l .  chosen in this figure corresponds to a two - parameter fit ( @xmath148 , 5.99 , and 4.61 for 99  % c.l .",
    ", 95  % c.l . , and 90  % c.l . ,",
    "respectively ) .",
    "the shape of the contour suggests that in atmospheric neutrino experiments like pingu , there is very little correlation between the nsi parameters @xmath0 and @xmath4 .",
    "we have checked that no new features arise in the allowed c.l .",
    "contours when inverted hierarchy is assumed to be the true hierarchy .",
    "hence , we do not explicitly show the corresponding contours for the inverted mass hierarchy .",
    "in this work , we have investigated the impact of the nsi parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 on the pingu atmospheric neutrino experiment , which is a planned extension of the already operational icecube ( and deepcore ) experiment(s ) that has been successfully observing very high energy neutrinos in the 10  gev to a few pev energy range .",
    "this experiment has already collected a large body of data on very high energy neutrinos , including the ones coming from the earth s atmosphere .",
    "the pingu proposal plans to reduce the energy threshold of the detector to less than 5 gev by placing more strings carrying the optical modules in a small region of the detector .",
    "this lower energy threshold would enable the observation of earth matter effects for atmospheric neutrinos in the ( 510 )  gev range , thereby leading to the determination of the neutrino mass hierarchy . with a multi - megaton effective volume",
    ", pingu could determine the neutrino mass hierarchy to a very high statistical significance within a short time .",
    "prospects of looking for nsis at pingu has been discussed in the literature before . in this work",
    ", we have further extended these studies by looking at the bounds on nsi parameters from pingu in the ( 2100 )  gev range .",
    "we have presented approximate analytical formulas giving the difference in the muon neutrino survival probability @xmath28 in the presence of the nsi parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 and plotted them in the @xmath58-@xmath149 plane .",
    "the probability difference @xmath28 was given for the three - flavor case and the so - called two - flavor hybrid model .",
    "a comparison of these approximate results against the exact @xmath28 calculated numerically revealed that the approximate three - flavor formula failed to reproduce the correct @xmath28 , especially at higher energies and for values of @xmath1 close to the upper bound from super - kamiokande . on the other hand ,",
    "the hybrid model agreed reasonably well with the exact numerical results , modulo the small difference at low energies coming from the fact that a step - function earth matter density profile was used for the former , while the prem profile was used for the latter .",
    "the impact of the nsi parameters was observed to be largest at @xmath150  gev .",
    "we showed the impact of @xmath0 and @xmath4 ( setting @xmath151 ) on @xmath28 separately .",
    "we also showed the impact of changing the sign of @xmath0 and @xmath4 on @xmath28 as well as the impact of the neutrino mass hierarchy .",
    "we have calculated the events due to atmospheric neutrinos at pingu and plotted the difference between the number of events given by standard oscillations and oscillations in presence of nsi parameters in the @xmath104-@xmath149 plane .",
    "the event plots followed the trend expected from the probability plots , modulo the smearing out of the energy and zenith angle fluctuations due to the finite energy and zenith angle resolution of the detector incorporated in our calculations .",
    "next , we have performed an estimate of the sensitivity of pingu to nsi parameters by defining a @xmath116 function , taking into account the systematic uncertainties in the atmospheric neutrino fluxes . in the case",
    "that there were no nsis in the neutrino sector , with three years of data , pingu should be able to constrain the nsi parameters at the 90  % c.l .",
    "to @xmath138 for normal ( inverted ) neutrino mass hierarchy , after marginalizing the @xmath116 function over the projected uncertainties of the standard neutrino oscillation parameters .",
    "finally , we have showed the expected c.l .  allowed contours in the @xmath0-@xmath4 plane with three years of pingu data if the nsis exist in nature .",
    "the contour also implies that there is basically no correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath4 .",
