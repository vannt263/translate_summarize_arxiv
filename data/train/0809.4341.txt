    "a cnot gate operation has been experimentally demonstrated for inductively coupled flux qubits @xcite with rather weak coupling .    in this study",
    "we obtain the hamiltonian for coupled three - josephson - junction qubits under a microwave field in weak microwave amplitude limit , consistent with usual experimental situations .",

    "these noises appear in the fluxoid quantization condition , @xmath111 let us first discuss the noises in the left qubit . combining the fluctuation of static flux @xmath112 into that of the microwave field @xmath110 , the net effect of both noises is expressed as a random fluctuation @xmath113 in the microwave field @xmath114 . as a result , the magnetic field of microwave in the diagonal terms of eq .",
    "( [ twot ] ) is rewritten as @xmath115 . since the diagonal term @xmath115 does not change the energy gaps @xmath62 and @xmath116 in eqs .",
    "( [ omega0 ] ) and ( [ omega1 ] ) , the fluctuation @xmath113 has no effect on the operations .",
    "hence the fluctuations of both the static and microwave fields threading the left qubit loop are negligible .",
    "on the other hand , the fluctuations of fluxes threading the right qubit may cause the decoherence in the qubit states . let us discuss the terms with @xmath86 and @xmath90 in eq .",
    "( [ twot ] ) separately . for the @xmath86 terms in eq .",
    "( [ twot ] ) the fluctuation of microwave flux , @xmath110 , can be combined into the fluctuation of static flux , @xmath117 , in the fluxoid quantization condition for right qubit in eq .",
    "( [ bcfluc ] ) .",
    "since the degeneracy point is optimally biased with respect to the static flux @xmath69 , the first order fluctuation effect of both @xmath118 and @xmath110 on qubit state dephasing will vanish at this point .    for the terms with @xmath90",
    "the net fluctuation can be given by @xmath119 in the diagonal and off - diagonal terms . since @xmath120 and thus @xmath121 for",
    "a sufficiently strong coupling , the off - diagonal term with @xmath90 will not appear .",
    "thus the fluctuation @xmath122 in the off - diagonal terms hardly gives rise to dissipation of qubit states for a sufficiently strong coupling , but the fluctuations in the diagonal terms may cause dephasing .",
    "for practical quantum computing , the quantum operations should be manipulated by a switchable coupling . to discuss this , in the model of fig .",
    "[ pc ] , we introduce two dc - squids in the connecting loop of the phase coupled qubits . here the external fluxes @xmath123 and @xmath124 vary from zero to 0.5 .",
    "when the fluxes threading the dc - squid loops are set as @xmath125 ( switch on ) , a dc - squid can be simplified as a single josephson junction with the josephson coupling energy @xmath126 .",
    "the design of fig .",
    "[ pc ] is similar to that in a previous study @xcite .",
    "the difference is just the direction of pseudo - spin of the right qubit .",
    "the present design is symmetric so that it may be more appropriate for real experiments .",
    "the current flowing in the connecting loop @xmath127 also gives rise to magnetic moments in the dc - squid loops .",
    "@xmath127 depends on the two - qubit states such as @xmath128 for the states , @xmath54 and @xmath129 , respectively and otherwise @xmath130 @xcite .",
    "here we set @xmath131 then the josephson energy of the connecting loop @xmath132 $ ] has an additional oscillating term , @xmath133 where we used the fluxoid quantization conditions for the dc - squid loops and the connecting loop , @xmath134 is the area of the dc - squids , and @xmath135 .    as a consequence ,",
    "the connecting loop energy of coupled states becomes @xmath136 where @xmath137 and @xmath138 .",
    "@xmath139 can be interpreted as the magnetic moment of the control loops .",
    "this magnetic moment arises by the interaction between the magnetic flux and the flowing current via the fluxoid quantization conditions of the dc - squid loops . if we include these terms in the hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ twoh ] ) , the net effect is just the shift of magnetic moments , @xmath140 remaining the physics qualitatively the same .",
    "the microwave field threading the dc - squid loops also generates noises .",
    "the noise from the microwave field can be introduced as a fluctuation of magnetic field @xmath141 as before .",
    "@xmath142 can be combined with the previous fluctuations @xmath143 through the relation of eq .",
    "( [ mc ] ) , which does not generate qualitatively different effect . the static flux @xmath144 controls the coupling between two qubits ; when @xmath145 , the coupling is switched on ( off ) .",
    "the static flux @xmath144 also generates noises in the dc - squid loops , but the switch - on ( off ) point , @xmath145 , is an optimal point with respect to @xmath144 @xcite .",
    "for a direct comparison of cnot gate operation performance as the coupling strength varies , the fidelity and concurrence @xcite oscillations are plotted as a function of time in figs . [ fidel](a ) and ( b ) . the fidelity is calculated by the definition @xmath146 where @xmath147 is the matrix for the perfect cnot operation and @xmath148 is the truth table amplitude at time @xmath149 @xcite . at @xmath150 , @xmath151 is the @xmath152 identity matrix and the fidelity has a finite value @xmath153 .",
    "the cnot operation changes an initial product state into a maximally entangled state .",
    "thus the maximal entanglement as well as the maximal fidelity corresponds to the perfect cnot gate operation .",
    "figure [ fidel ] shows that the deviations of the fidelity and concurrence oscillations diminish as the coupling strength increases .    at the end of two - qubit operations",
    "the phase - coupling is switched off with @xmath154 .",
    "since the magnetic dc pulse for switching - off has a finite rising time , the phase of qubit state evolves during the time , but this phase evolution is controllable by manipulating other parameters . the states of qubits can be detected by shifting the magnetic pulse adiabatically @xcite . at the degeneracy point in fig . [ level ] , the averaged current of qubit states vanishes .",
    "thus , one can apply a finite dc magnetic pulse to shift the qubits slightly away from the degeneracy point to detect the qubit current states .    in summary",
    ", we study the operation of two coupled flux qubits under a microwave irradiation .",
    "the flux qubits interact with the threading microwave field by the fluxoid quantization condition and can be treated as magnetic moments for a weak magnetic field threading the qubit loop . by using the coupled qubit hamiltonian",
    "we show that for a strong coupling the microwave - driven cnot gate can be realized with a high fidelity .",
