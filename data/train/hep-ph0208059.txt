    "the zeus collaboration has published data on leading neutron production in neutral current @xmath0 collisions at hera@xcite .",
    "the data have been anticipated because of the light they cast on the structure of the pion and nucleon .",
    "in @xcite the zeus collaboration uses an _ effective flux method_@xcite to determine the photon - pion total cross section at high w , and the deep inelastic structure function of the pion , @xmath1 . in this note",
    ", the method is described ; its assumptions and inherent difficulties are discussed ; and the problem of error is confronted .",
    "implications of the zeus data are examined critically for the role of meson exchange in the production of leading neutrons and for the structure of the pion .",
    "leading baryons are those produced with small transverse momentum , @xmath2 , and carrying a large fraction @xmath3 , of the incoming proton s energy .",
    "they are thought to represent the conserved baryon current because the squared 4-momentum transfer , @xmath4 , between the incoming proton and outgoing baryon is small(@xcite , fig .  1 ) .",
    "the production data for leading baryons can be understood in terms of meson exchanges .",
    "consider the specific case @xmath5 .",
    "the cross section for the production of a leading neutron is given by a sum over all possible meson exchanges between the photon and proton which lead to an outgoing neutron at the proton vertex(@xcite , fig .",
    "1 ) : @xmath6 where @xmath7 , or @xmath8 meson ; @xmath9 is the total @xmath10 cross section ; @xmath11 is the splitting function for @xmath12 via @xmath13 exchange ; and @xmath14 is a form factor which accounts for rescattering of the neutron ( absorption ) due to the finite size of the projectile .",
    "projectiles other than the photon , and produced baryons other than the neutron are treated similarly .",
    "for example , in the reaction @xmath15 the @xmath16 and @xmath17 mesons , and the pomeron @xmath18 also contribute .",
    "there are complications .",
    "the direct production of baryons which decay , such as @xmath19 , leads to the indirect production of nucleons ; there can be two - meson exchange , and different exchanges can interfere ; the form factor , @xmath20 , can depend on @xmath3 and perhaps on the exchanged meson @xmath13 .",
    "the simple factorization assumed in eqn .",
    "[ exchange ] is only an approximation .",
    "in hadro - production experiments ( projectile=@xmath21 ) leading neutron production is believed to be dominated by pion exchange .",
    "the spectrum of leading neutrons in @xmath22 collisions at fermilab and the isr is fairly well represented by a single term ( one - meson - exchange ) of the form @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the mass of the pion , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 is the measured , on - mass - shell , @xmath27 total cross section .",
    "the splitting function @xmath28 is very close to that expected from pure one - pion exchange .",
    "the result is simple , but surprising .",
    "note in eqn .",
    "[ feff ] the absence of    * an absorptive factor @xmath29 ; * an off - mass - shell correction , that is , a @xmath4 dependence to @xmath30 ; * contributions from @xmath31 and @xmath8 exchange , and @xmath32 production .",
    "the self - consistency of the meson exchange picture requires the presence of such ` backgrounds ' .",
    "in addition , the value , 14.5 , of the @xmath33 coupling constant is larger than recent estimates@xcite which suggest that @xmath34 lies in the range ( 13.514.1 ) .    the zeus collaboration has reviewed ( see @xcite ,  10.1 ) the expected backgrounds to one - pion exchange which are known both from experimental measurements ( eg .  @xmath32 production ) and from theoretical calculations ( eg .  absorption ) .",
    "the effects are large , roughly 20 - 30% , apparently confounding the experimental observation embodied in eqns .  [ ope ] and",
    "[ feff ] ; however ,    * @xmath31 , @xmath8 exchange and @xmath32 production _ increase _",
    "neutron production , while absorptive effects _ decrease _ neutron production * absorption preferentially removes @xmath31 and @xmath8 compared to @xmath35 exchange because @xmath29 decreases with increasing @xmath4 and the contribution of the higher mass mesons increases relative to the pion at high  @xmath4 .",
    "the conclusion to draw is that simple one - pion exchange agrees well with the hadro - production data because of a fortuitous near cancellation of absorptive effects and background contributions .",
    "the large value of the effective coupling constant ( 14.5 ) implies that the cancellation is not perfect , and that there is a residual @xmath36% contribution to the normalization .",
    "@xmath37 is not the true pion flux , but rather an effective pion flux in the presence of competing and ` compensating ' processes .",
    "the effective flux of pions in the proton ( effective splitting function ) can be defined by experiment as the deconvolution of the measured semi - inclusive differential cross section for @xmath38 and the measured @xmath27 total cross section , @xmath39 where deconvolution is written as division . by construction and",
    "definition @xmath37 corrects one - pion exchange in @xmath40 collisions for @xmath31 and @xmath8 exchange , @xmath32 production , rescattering and off - mass - shell effects , etc . from eqn .",
    "[ exchange ] it is seen that a ` model ' for @xmath37 is @xmath41 it is important to emphasize : experiments find that a convenient parameterization of @xmath37 is given by eqn .",
    "because of the universal behavior of hadronic cross sections @xmath37 is also expected to work for @xmath42 and @xmath43 collisions .",
    "it has been proposed@xcite to measure the structure function of the pion @xmath44 at hera using virtual @xmath45 collisions assuming pion exchange dominates the interaction @xmath46 , just as it does in hadro - production .",
    "a vital consistency check for any extraction of @xmath44 using the electro - production of leading neutrons is the demonstration that the photo - production of leading neutrons is in accord with the hadro - production measurements .",
    "the importance of the photo - production data arises because :    * @xmath47 is the single relevant leptonic variable ( @xmath48 ) . *",
    "the @xmath47 dependence of measured hadronic cross sections closely follows a simple universal behavior ; at high @xmath47 the hadronic total cross sections behave as a power law @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is a constant independent of the projectile and target . *",
    "the photo - production ( @xmath51 gev@xmath52 ) and transition region ( @xmath53 gev@xmath52 ) data from hera are in good agreement with vector dominance in which the photon behaves like an exchanged vector meson and the collision is hadronic@xcite .",
    "in contrast to photo - production , the situation in electro - production is less well understood .",
    "the additional degree of freedom quantified by @xmath54 adds complication .",
    "rescattering , background composition and levels , and factorization properties can vary with @xmath54 .",
    "moreover , in deep inelastic scattering ( @xmath55 gev@xmath52 ) the chief interest lies in measuring the @xmath47 ( that is @xmath56 , @xmath57 at low @xmath56 ) dependence of the cross section . in summary ,",
    "a prerequisite for a believable determination of @xmath44 using high @xmath54 electro - production data is a consistent determination of @xmath58 using photo - production data .    a standard technique for determining @xmath59 involves fitting the observed differential cross section for @xmath60 while simultaneously correcting for background exchanges , delta production , absorption , and off - mass - shell effects@xcite .",
    "this procedure has the important advantage of providing an estimate of the size of the contributing sub - processes and giving a transparent estimate of the error .",
    "it has the disadvantage that there is a large number of effects to be accounted for , with a corresponding large degree of freedom .",
    "the parameters must be guessed , fit , or fixed by experiment .",
    "the effective flux is used instead to directly determine @xmath59 without determining the individual sub - processes .",
    "this has the advantages of simplicity and directness , but the disadvantage that no information is obtained about the relative importance of the various processes which contribute .",
    "the error is difficult to estimate ( see  [ discussion ] ) because the amount of pion exchange present is not unambiguously determined .",
    "if pion exchange does not contribute , the result , although well defined , is meaningless .",
    "the arguments which follow ( in  [ sigpi ] and  [ f2pi ] ) give the essence of what obtains from the zeus measurement .",
    "the @xmath61 total cross section is obtained from the photo - production data using @xmath62 where the variable @xmath4 has been integrated out in the numerator .",
    "substitution for @xmath37 from its definition in eqn .",
    "[ definition ] shows that @xmath59 can be determined from ( double ) ratios @xmath63 of measured quantities .",
    "the zeus collaboration has observed that the relative rate of neutron production in photo - production at hera is _ half _ that of @xmath40 collisions .",
    "it follows from eqn .",
    "[ double ] that @xmath64 is half @xmath65 .",
    "therefore , as zeus deduces directly , @xmath66 rather than two - thirds as expected from regge factorization or the counting of valence quarks ( the additive quark model ) .    an important consistency check , which the zeus collaboration has performed ( @xcite , fig .",
    "6 & 8) , is that the neutron energy and angular distributions are described by @xmath37 .",
    "the double ratio ( eqn .  [ double ] ) is robust for hadro- and photo - production ; however , for electro - production , absorptive rescattering decreases as @xmath54 increases , as discussed in @xcite and @xcite ( see also @xcite , fig .",
    "9 ) . at low @xmath54 ( @xmath68 gev@xmath52 ) ,",
    "@xmath44 and @xmath69 are related by @xmath70 which , in analogy with @xmath31 dominance in @xmath43 interactions@xcite , can be written as @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the mass of the @xmath31 meson .",
    "equations  [ php ] and  [ bpc ] connect the photo - production @xmath61 cross section to the transition region @xmath73 cross section ; together with the corresponding equations for @xmath74 interactions , @xmath75 obtains . in the kinematic region",
    "@xmath76 gev@xmath52 the ratio of neutron production ( i.e. tagged divided by all ) increases . to maintain eqn .",
    "[ ratio ] an absorptive correction needs to be applied .",
    "rescattering decreases , and the effective flux must increase correspondingly in order to maintain consistency between photo - production , the transition region , and deep inelastic scattering .",
    "the zeus data require for deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) @xmath77 .",
    "the measurements show that 2.5% of deep inelastic scattering events , independent of @xmath56 and @xmath54 , have a leading neutron with @xmath78 and @xmath79 gev ( @xcite , fig .",
    "the constancy of the ratio of neutron production in dis as a function of @xmath56 and @xmath54 implies that @xmath80 with a constant of proportionality @xmath81 given by @xmath82 where the integration is over the @xmath3 and @xmath83 range covered by the zeus measurement . because @xmath84 with @xmath85@xcite @xmath86",
    "for the determination of @xmath44 the effective flux method requires little theoretical input .",
    "only the general concepts of meson exchange theory are needed .",
    "the data , hadro - production , photo - production and electro - production , determine everything .",
    "note especially that    * one - pion - exchange is not assumed .",
    "it is only assumed that pion exchange dominates neutron production . *",
    "the contribution of backgrounds is not neglected .",
    "the method accounts for @xmath31 and @xmath8 exchange and for indirect neutron production through @xmath32 production and decay .",
    "* the exact composition and relative contribution of the backgrounds is unimportant . *",
    "absorptive effects are measured . *",
    "the consistency of the photo - production ( @xmath87 gev@xmath52 ) , transition region ( @xmath88 gev@xmath52 ) , and dis ( @xmath89 gev@xmath52 ) analyses requires and defines an absorptive correction .",
    "if absorption approximately compensates for background exchanges in hadro- and photo - production , as the data suggest , then the 30% rise in neutron ratio between photo - production and dis is a measure of the relative contribution of the backgrounds .",
    "the effective flux gives a normalization of @xmath90 which differs by a factor of two from that expected by regge factorization or valence quark counting .",
    "the disagreement follows directly from the experimental observation that the relative rate of neutrons in photo - production is half that observed in hadro - production .",
    "can @xmath37 , which is determined by @xmath40 collisions , be wrong by a factor of two when used for photo - production ?",
    "background exchanges and absorptive effects are of the same magnitude , but contribute with opposite signs .",
    "the zeus leading neutron data show that the relative size of absorptive effects is approximately 20 - 30% .",
    "background processes must contribute at approximately this level , in agreement with estimates from phenomenological studies ( reviewed in@xcite ,  10.1 ) .",
    "with this in mind , a conservative estimate for the error on using @xmath37 for photo - production is obtained by assuming that pion exchange contributes @xmath91% and that the backgrounds change by @xmath92% on moving from @xmath40 to @xmath43 collisions .",
    "the change in @xmath37 is then @xmath93% .",
    "suppose that the low neutron rate is not due to a small photon - pion cross section , but rather due to changes in absorption or backgrounds .",
    "then absorption must increase or backgrounds decrease strongly in the photon - proton system compared to the proton - proton system .    if the meson exchange picture underestimates the normalization of @xmath59 by a factor of two , the theory is wrong , misapplied , or there is a significant missing ingredient .",
    "then one can not extract with any confidence the @xmath56 and @xmath54 behavior of @xmath44 .",
    "if the photo - production result is disbelieved , the zeus data can be taken as evidence that meson exchange plays _ little _ role in the production of leading nucleons at hera .",
    "one then argues that the zeus measurement is merely a reflection of @xmath94 , arising because of factorization ( limiting fragmentation ) at the proton vertex and baryon conservation .    on the other hand",
    ", the experimental evidence for the meson exchange picture is good ( see references in @xcite ) .",
    "one can accept the picture and the normalization of @xmath59 and @xmath44 implied by the zeus data . in this case",
    "some conjectures can be make :    * the @xmath56 dependence of @xmath95 for all hadrons is similar at low @xmath56 and is determined mainly by the qcd evolution equations , only weakly by the valence structure of the hadron . *",
    "the number of partons at low @xmath56 in the pion is 1/3 that of the proton ; since the charged radius of the pion is 2/3 the proton s , the _ volume _ density of partons in the pion is approximately the same as in the proton .",
    "* there is a large probability for the proton to be found in a meson - nucleon or meson - delta fock state ( the nucleon within the nucleon ) ; the proton is a loosely bound meson - nucleon system composed of infinitely bound partons . * the quark - antiquark sea of a hadron",
    "is generated mainly by valence - valence interactions ( three for the proton and one for the pion ) , and not by self interactions .",
    "moreover , there is a significant violation of the quark counting rules and regge factorization .",
    "in the context of the meson exchange picture of leading baryon production , the leading neutron data from zeus , taken together with the hadro - production data from fermilab and the isr , make a statement about the normalization of @xmath59 . with the assumption that the @xmath56 and @xmath54 dependence of the difference between pion exchange and the backgrounds is weak , @xmath44 can be extracted from the data .",
    "the normalization is the firmer of the determinations .",
    "if the normalization fixed by the photo - production data is incorrect , then an extraction of @xmath44 is doubtful since the self - consistency of the picture is questionable . in particular ,",
    "the @xmath56 and @xmath54 dependence extracted from the data is questionable because the high @xmath54 region is less well understood than photo - production , both experimentally and phenomenologically .",
    "if the determination of @xmath44 using the effective flux method is correct , then the zeus data have important implications for the structure of the nucleon and the pion .",
    "i thank the zeus collaboration for many useful discussions and for its efforts in publishing the inclusive leading neutron data .",
    "i thank john martin and malcolm derrick for helpful comments ."
