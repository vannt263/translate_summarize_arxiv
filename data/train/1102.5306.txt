    "at a fields institute workshop in 2000 , dimitris achlioptas suggested a class of variants of the classical random graph process , defining a random sequence @xmath5 of graphs on a fixed vertex set of size  @xmath0 , usually explained in terms of the actions of a hypothetical purposeful agent : start at step @xmath6 with the empty graph . at step @xmath7 ,",
    "two potential edges @xmath8 and @xmath9 are chosen independently and uniformly at random from all @xmath10 possible edges [ or from those edges not present in @xmath11 .",
    "the agent must select one of these edges , setting @xmath12 for @xmath13 or @xmath9 .",
    "any possible strategy , or `` rule , '' for the agent gives rise to a  random graph process .",
    "such processes are known as `` achlioptas processes.''=-1    if the agent always chooses the first edge , then ( ignoring the minor effect of repeated edges ) this is , of course , the classical random graph process , studied implicitly by erds and rnyi and formalized by bollobs . in this case , as is well known , there is a phase transition around @xmath14 .",
    "more precisely , writing @xmath15 for the number of vertices in the ( a , if there is a  tie ) largest component of a graph  @xmath16 , erds and rnyi  @xcite showed that there is a function @xmath17 such that for any fixed @xmath18 , whenever @xmath19 satisfies @xmath20 as @xmath21 , then @xmath22 , where @xmath23 denotes convergence in probability .",
    "moreover , @xmath24 for @xmath25 , @xmath26 for @xmath27 and @xmath28 ( the solution to a simple equation ) is continuous at @xmath29 with right - derivative @xmath30 at this point .",
    "achlioptas originally asked whether the agent could shift the critical point of this phase transition by following an appropriate edge - selection rule .",
    "one natural rule to try is the `` product rule '' : of the given potential edges , pick the one minimizing the product of the sizes of the components of its endvertices .",
    "this rule was suggested by bollobs as the most likely to delay the critical point .",
    "bohman and frieze  @xcite quickly showed , using a much simpler rule , that the transition could indeed be shifted , but more complicated rules such as the product rule remained resistant to analysis . by 2004 at the latest ( see  @xcite ) , extensive simulations of dsouza and others strongly suggested that the product rule in particular shows much more interesting behavior than simply a slightly shifted critical point ; it exhibits a phenomenon known as `` explosive percolation . ''    as usual , we say that an event @xmath31 ( formally a sequence of events @xmath32 ) holds _ with high probability _",
    "( _ whp _ ) if @xmath33 as @xmath21 .",
    "explosive percolation is said to occur if there is a critical @xmath34 and a positive @xmath35 such that for any fixed @xmath36 , whp @xmath37 jumps from @xmath3 to at least @xmath4 in fewer than @xmath38 steps around @xmath39 .",
    "recently , achlioptas , dsouza and spencer  @xcite presented `` conclusive numerical evidence '' for the conjecture that the product rule exhibits explosive percolation , suggesting indeed that the largest component grows from size at most @xmath40 to size at least @xmath41 in at most @xmath42 steps .",
    "bohman  @xcite describes this explosive percolation conjecture as an important and intriguing mathematical question .    our main result disproves this conjecture .",
    "the result applies to all achlioptas processes as defined at the start of the section ( including the product rule ) and , in fact , to a more general class of processes ( @xmath43-vertex rules ) defined in section  [ secproof ] .",
    "a  form of this result first appeared in  @xcite , with more restrictive assumptions , and without full technical details .",

    "let @xmath55 denote the number of vertices of a graph @xmath16 in components with @xmath56 vertices , so @xmath55 is @xmath56 times the number of @xmath56-vertex components .",

    "in fact , we obtain much more ; whp there is no time at which there are `` many '' vertices in `` large '' components but not in the single largest component . for the precise definition of a `` merging '' rule",

    "indeed , the maximum size of the second largest component throughout the evolution of the process is whp @xmath3 ; this can be read out of the original results of erds and rnyi  @xcite or ( more easily ) the more precise results of bollobs  @xcite .",
    "`` no two giants '' conjecture ( personal communication ) states that this should also hold for achlioptas processes .",
    "theorem  [ thgu ] proves this conjecture for the larger class of merging @xmath43-vertex rules ; indeed , it readily implies that , with high probability , the second largest component has size at most @xmath71 . allowing @xmath68 to vary with @xmath0 as noted above",
    ", the bound we obtain is of the form @xmath72 .    before turning to the proofs of theorems  [ th1 ] and  [ thgu ] ,",
    "let us discuss some related questions of convergence .",
    "we say that the rule @xmath44 is _ locally convergent _ if there exist functions @xmath73 $ ] such that , for each fixed @xmath74 and @xmath18 , we have @xmath75 as @xmath21 .",

    "theorem  [ th1 ] clearly implies that if a rule @xmath44 is globally convergent , then the limiting function @xmath78 is continuous at the critical point @xmath80 . using theorem  [ thgu ] , it is not hard to establish continuity elsewhere for merging rules ; see theorem  [ thcont ] and corollary  [ corcont ] in section  [ secedge ] .",
    "unfortunately , we can not show that the product rule _ is _ globally convergent .",
    "however , as we shall see in section  [ secconv ] , theorem  [ thgu ] implies the following result .",
    "[ thlg ] let @xmath44 be a merging @xmath43-vertex rule for some @xmath45 .",
    "if @xmath44 is locally convergent , then @xmath44 is globally convergent , and the limiting function  @xmath81 is continuous and satisfies @xmath82 .",
    "the conditional result above is , of course , rather unsatisfactory .",
    "however , for many achlioptas processes , local convergence is well known ; global convergence had not previously been established for any nontrivial rule . in particular , theorem  [ thlg ] settles two conjectures of spencer and wormald  @xcite concerning so - called `` bounded size achlioptas processes '' ( see section  [ size ] ) .",
    "recently , in a paper in the physics literature , da costa , dorogovtsev , goltsev and mendes  @xcite announced a version of theorem 1 .",
    "however , their actual analysis concerned only one specific rule ( not the product rule , though they claim that `` clearly '' the product rule is less likely to have a discontinuous transition ) . more importantly ,",
    "even the `` analytic '' part of it is heuristic , and of a type that seems to us very hard ( if at all possible ) to make precise .",
    "crucially , the starting point for their analysis is not only to assume convergence , but also to assume that the phase transition is continuous ! from this , and some further assumptions , by solving approximations to certain equations they deduce certain `` self - consistent behavior , '' which apparently justifies the assumption of continuity .",
    "the argument ( which is considerably more involved than the simple proof presented here ) is certainly very interesting , and the conclusion is ( as we now know ) correct , but it seems to be very far from a mathematical proof .    in the next section we prove theorem  [ th1 ] . in section  [ secedge ] , restricting the class of rules slightly , we prove theorem  [ thgu ] and deduce that jumps in @xmath37 are also impossible after a giant component first emerges .",
    "next , in section  [ secconv ] , we prove theorem  [ thlg ]",

    "the agent is presented with the random list ( set ) @xmath84 of vertices , and , unless two or more are already in the same component , must add one or more edges between them , according to any deterministic or random rule that depends only on the history . in the original examples of achlioptas",
    ", the rule always adds either the edge @xmath97 or the edge @xmath98 .",
    "note that ( for now ) no connection between the algorithms used for different @xmath0 ( or indeed at different steps @xmath7 ) is assumed .",
    "the arguments that follow are robust to small changes in the definition , since they can be written to rely only on deterministic properties of @xmath99 , plus bounds on the probabilities of certain events at each step .",

    "this covers variations such as picking an @xmath43-tuple of _ distinct _ vertices , or picking ( the ends of ) @xmath105 randomly selected ( distinct ) edges not already present in @xmath90 .    the proof of theorem  [ th1 ] is based on two observations , which we first present in heuristic form .",

    "we have probability at least @xmath112 of choosing only vertices in @xmath110 , and if no component has order more than @xmath113 , it is likely that all these vertices are in different components , so the rule is _ forced _ to join two components meeting  @xmath110 .",

    "it is not quite stated correctly , although this does not seem to be why the heuristic fails . )",
    "observation 2 : components of order @xmath56 have a half - life that may be bounded in terms of @xmath56 ; in an individual step , such a component disappears ( by joining another component ) with probability at most @xmath115 . assuming ( which we shall not assume in the actual proof ) that the rule @xmath44 is locally convergent , it follows easily that for all @xmath116 , @xmath117 and @xmath56 we have @xmath118 .",
