    "obviously , the ordering of the agents , i.e. , @xmath7 , is preserved over time .",
    "we say that a hk system has converged at time @xmath8 if @xmath9 holds for all agents and all time steps @xmath10 . for the convergence time ,",
    "i.e. , the smallest time @xmath8 such that the system has converged at @xmath8 , an upper bound of @xmath11 was proven @xcite .",
    "it is conjectured that the worst - case scenario is given by the initial positions @xmath12  _ equidistant configuration _ for later reference  and needs roughly @xmath13 time steps @xcite .",

    "there is also the possibility that different clusters arise , as e.g.  for @xmath15 .",
    "we define the weight of @xmath16 at time @xmath17 as @xmath18 and the the weight of agent @xmath3 at time @xmath17 as @xmath19 . with this , we say that a hk system has reached consensus at time @xmath17 if the weight of agent @xmath20 equals @xmath0 .",
    "whenever we have @xmath21 , we have @xmath22 for all @xmath23 , i.e. , no consensus is possible . by @xmath24",
    "we denote the earliest time @xmath17 such that a given hk system @xmath25 has reached consensus or we have @xmath21 for at least one index @xmath3 . with this let @xmath26 denote the maximum of @xmath24 over all configurations consisting of @xmath0 agents .",
