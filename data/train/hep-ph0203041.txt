    "flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) induced b - meson rare decays provide a unique testing ground for standard model ( sm ) improved by qcd corrections via operator product expansion ( for a review and complete set of references see @xcite ) .",
    "studies of rare b decays can give precise information about various fundamental parameters of sm like cabbibo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix elements , leptonic decay constants etc .",
    "in addition to this , rare b decays can also give information about various extensions of sm like two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) @xcite , minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) @xcite etc .",
    "after the first observation of the penguin induced decay and the corresponding exclusive decay channel @xmath2 by cleo @xcite , rare decays have begun to play an important role in particle physics phenomenology .    among the rare b decays , ( @xmath3 )",
    "are of special interest due to their relative cleanliness and sensitivity to new physics .",
    "they have been extensively studied within sm @xcite and beyond @xcite . in the mode , one can study many experimentally accessible quantities associated with final state leptons and photon lepton pair invariant mass spectrum , lepton pair forward backward asymmetry , photon energy distribution and various polarization asymmetries ( like longitudinal , transverse and normal ) .",
    "the final state leptons in the radiative decay mode , apart from having longitudinal polarization , can have two more components of polarization ( is the component of the polarization lying in the decay plane and is the one that is normal to the decay plane ) @xcite . both and remain non - trivial for @xmath4 and @xmath5 channel since they are proportional to the lepton mass , .",
    "the different components of the polarization , , involve different combinations of wilson coefficients and hence contain independent information .",
    "for this reason confronting the polarization results with experiments are important investigations of the structure of sm and for establishing new physics beyond it .",
    "the radiative process has been extensively studied in 2hdm and susy by various people @xcite and the importance of the neutral higgs bosons ( nhbs ) has been emphasized in the decay mode with @xmath6 and @xmath7 pairs in the final state . in this work",
    "we study various polarization asymmetries associated with final state lepton ( considering lepton to be either muon or tau ) with special focus on the nhb effects .",
    "decay is induced by the pure leptonic decay which suffers from helicity suppression for light leptons ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "but in radiative mode ( ) this helicity suppression is overcome because the lepton pair by itself does not carry the available four momentum .",
    "for this reason , one can expect to have a relatively large branching ratio compared to non - radiative mode despite an extra factor of @xmath9 . in mssm ,",
    "the situation for pure dileptonic modes ( ) becomes different specially if @xmath10 and is large @xcite .",
    "this is because in mssm the scalar and pseudoscalar higgs coupling to the leptons is proportional to @xmath11 and thus can be large for @xmath12 and for large .",
    "the effect of nhbs has been studied in great detail in various leptonic decay modes @xcite .",
    "the effect of nhbs on radiative mode has also been studied in 2hdm @xcite and susy @xcite . here",
    "we will focus on the nhb effects on various polarization asymmetries within the framework of mssm .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we first present the leading order ( lo ) qcd corrected effective hamiltonian for the quark level process including nhb effects leading to the corresponding matrix element and dileptonic invariant mass distribution . in section 3 ,",
    "all the three polarization asymmetries associated with the final state lepton are calculated .",
    "section 4 contains discussion of the numerical analysis of the polarization asymmetries and their dependence on various parameters of the theory , focusing again mainly on nhb effects in the large regime .",
    "the exclusive decay can be obtained from the inclusive decay and further from . to do",
    "this photon has to be attached to any charged internal or external line in the feynman diagrams for .",
    "as pointed out by eilam @xcite , contributions coming from attachment of photon to any charged internal line will be suppressed by a factor of @xmath13 in wilson coefficient and hence can be safely neglected .",
    "so we only consider the cases when the photon is hooked to initial quark lines and final lepton lines .",
    "to start off , the effective hamiltonian relevant for is @xcite : _ eff & = & v_tbv_ts^ * \\ {   -2   7eff    |s i_p^(1+_5 ) b   | ^  +   9eff  |s_(1-_5 ) b  |^. + & & .",

    "the wilson coefficients @xmath18 and @xmath19 are given in @xcite .",
    "wilson coefficients @xmath20 and @xmath21 are given in @xcite .",
    "in addition to the short distance corrections included in the wilson coefficients , there are some long distance effects also , associated with real @xmath22 resonances in the intermediate states .",
    "this is taken into account by using the prescription given in @xcite , namely by using the breit - wigner form of resonances that add on to @xmath23 : c_9^(res )  =    _ v _ v = j/, , ..  ; [ eq:2 ] there are six known resonances in @xmath22 system that can contribute .",

    "we now compute the lepton polarization asymmetries from the four fermi interaction defined in the matrix element eqn.([eq:3 ] ) and eqn.([eq:4 ] ) . for this we need to calculate the polarized rates corresponding to different lepton polarizations .",

    "although mssm is the simplest ( and the one having the least number of parameters ) susy model , it still has a very large number of parameters making it rather difficult to do any meaningfull phenomenology in such a large parameter space .",
    "many choices are available to reduce such large number of parameters .",
    "the most favorite among them is the supergravity ( sugra ) model . in this model , universality of all the masses and couplings is assumed at the gut scale .",
    "the minimal sugra ( msugra ) model has only five parameters ( in addition to sm parameters ) to deal with .",
    "they are : @xmath49 ( the unified mass of all the scalars ) , @xmath50 ( unified mass of all the gauginos ) , ( ratio of vacuum expectation values of the two higgs doublets ) , @xmath51 ( the universal trilinear coupling constant ) and finally , @xmath52 is that @xmath6 enters the chargino mass matrix with positive sign ] .    it has been well emphasized in many works @xcite that it is not necessary to have a common mass for all the scalars at the gut scale . to have required suppression in @xmath53 mixing , it is sufficient to have common masses of all the squarks at the gut scale .",
    "so the condition of universality of all scalar masses at the gut is not a very strict one in sugra .",
    "thus we also explore a more relaxed kind of msugra model where the condition of universality of all the scalar masses at the gut scale is relaxed with the assumption that universal squark and higgs masses are different . for the higgs sector",
    "we take the pseudo - scalar higgs mass ( @xmath54 ) to be a parameter . over the whole mssm parameter space we have imposed a 95 % cl bound @xcite , consistant with cleo and aleph",

    "now we try to analyse the behavior of the polarization asymmetries on the parameters of the models chosen ( msugra , and sugra ) . for this analysis",
    "we consider the polarization asymmetries at dilepton invariant mass ( @xmath57 ) away from the resonances ( the @xmath58 ) resonances ( we choose @xmath59 for our analysis ) .",
    "the main focus of the analysis is nhb effects on polarization asymmetries .",
    "these effects crucially depend on and pseudoscalar higgs mass ( @xmath54 ) .    in msugra model the higgs mass ( at electroweak scale )",
    "depends crucially on the universal mass of the scalars and . to illustrate this crucial behaviour ,",
    "we have plotted various polarization asymmetries as a function of for different values of unified scalar mass ( @xmath49 ) in figs .",
    "( [ fig : longtb ] , [ fig : normtb ] , [ fig : transtb ] ) . as can be seen from these figures , shows large deviations from the sm values and over a significant portion of the allowed region , even shows a sign flip , provided is sufficiently large .",
    "similar behaviour is also there for . on the other hand , the predictions for do nt differ substantially from sm results but the msugra predictions can change by more than 50 % with an appreciable increase in .    for sugra model we have plotted ( figs .",
    "( [ fig : longma ] , [ fig : normma ] , [ fig : transma ] ) ) the polarization asymmetries as a function of pseudoscalar higgs mass ( @xmath54 ) for various values of . in sugra we expect more variation of all the polarization asymmetries as compared to their sm values because here we have higgs mass ( pseudo - scalar higgs mass ) as an additional parameter along with . as we can see from figure([fig : longma ] ) the variation of is more substantial in sugra model .",
    "in fact for fairly large region of sugra parameter space , can be opposite in sign as compared to sm case .",
    "can vary upto five in magnitude when compared with the sm value over the large region of allowed parameter space and for the parameter space we have taken into consideration , the predicted value of in sugra is opposite in sign to the sm value .",
    "again does not show as much deviation as observed for and but the variation can still be upto an order in certain region .    summarizing the results of the numerical analysis :",
    "1 .   from figures ( [ fig :",
    "longs],[fig : transs ] ) it is clear that the longitudinal and transverse polarization asymmetries ( , ) can have substantial deviation from their respective standard model values over the whole region of dilepton invariant mass ( @xmath57 ) , while figure([fig : norms ] ) indicates deviation for from sm values for a limited region of the dilepton invariant mass .",
    "as we have pointed out earlier @xcite that for the inclusive process @xmath60 there is not much deviation from sm results in msugra model .",
    "but in radiative dileptonic decay mode , msugra predictions also show large deviations ( at least of and ) from sm results , making it possible to use polarization asymmetries to test msugra model .",
    "this is mainly because in the bremmstrahlung part of the matrix elment ( @xmath61 ) , the wilson coefficient @xmath21 adds on to @xmath19 via the combination @xmath62 which effectively increases the sm value of @xmath19 .",
    "this does nt happen for the process @xmath63 and this numerically is the reason for the scalar exchanges affecting the process more than the semi - leptonic one .",
    "3 .   from figs .",
    "( [ fig : longtb ] , [ fig : normtb ] , [ fig : transtb ] ) we can see that the polarization asymmetries show a general enhancement with increase in and they decrease as the universal scalar mass ( @xmath49 ) is increased .",
    "this is expected because the higgs boson mass increases with @xmath49 and thus the contributions of scalar ( @xmath20 ) and pseudoscalar ( @xmath21 ) type interactions decrease .",
    "as can be seen from the structure of the analytical expressions for various polarization asymmetries ( eqn.([eq:14 ] , [ eq:15 ] , [ eq:16 ] ) , they are all different analytic functions of various wilson coefficients and hence contain independent information . these asymmetries , hence , can also be used for accurate determination of various wilson coefficients .    in conclusion",
    ", we can say that the observation of the polarization asymmetries can be a very useful probe for finding out the new physics effects and testing the structure of the effective hamiltonian .",
