    "the poisson sigma model ( p@xmath3 m ) is a topological field theory defined in terms of a functional on the space of maps from the tangent bundle of a two dimensional oriented surface @xmath4 to the cotangent bundle of a given poisson manifold @xmath5 . when the source surface is the unit disk it has been shown in the celebrated paper @xcite that kontsevich s star product on @xmath6 @xcite can be obtained from feynman s expansions of certain green functions , assuming particularly simple boundary conditions .",
    "the same authors have extended the previous calculations with the p@xmath3 m with boundary conditions such that the base map @xmath7 maps the boundary of the unit disk to a coisotropic submanifold of @xmath6 @xcite : it turns out that the coisotropic submanifolds of a poisson manifold label the possible boundary conditions of the p@xmath3 m and its quantization is related to the deformation quantization of the coisotropic submanifold itself . in @xcite it has been shown that even non coisotropic branes are allowed at quantum level ; when the brane is defined by the so called second class constraint , then the perturbative quantization of the p@xmath3 m yields kontsevich s star product associated now to the dirac bracket defined on the brane . in @xcite a unifying approach is proposed with the introduction of pre - poisson submanifolds : given a pre - poisson submanifold @xmath8 of a poisson manifold @xmath6 , then it is always possible to find a presymplectic submanifold @xmath9 of @xmath6 containing @xmath8 as coisotropic submanifold . in this note",
