    "the unification of the standard model ( sm ) gauge groups into a larger group , like in @xmath2 grand unified theories ( guts ) @xcite , is an attractive possibility of a new physics beyond the sm .",
    "one of the important check points of guts is the gauge coupling unification which predicts that the gauge coupling constants of the sm become equal at the unification scale up to threshold corrections .",
    "it is well known that , in the sm , there is no strong indication of the unification of the gauge coupling constants . in supersymmetric ( susy ) models ,",
    "on the other hand , the situation changes because of the existence of the superparticles as well as up- and down - type higgses .",
    "in particular , with the renormalization group equations ( rges ) of the minimal susy sm ( mssm ) , three gauge coupling constants more - or - less meet at the gut scale @xmath4 if the mass scale of the superparticles is @xmath5 @xcite .    in simple gut models based on @xmath2 ,",
    "quarks and leptons are embedded into full multiplets of @xmath2 . in particular , the right - handed down - type quarks and the left - handed lepton doublets are embedded into the anti - fundamental representations of @xmath2 , resulting in the unification of the down - type and charged lepton yukawa coupling constants . in particular , the unification of the yukawa coupling constants of @xmath0-quark and @xmath1-lepton is an interesting check point of ( susy ) guts .",
    "indeed , the @xmath0-@xmath1 unification based on susy guts has been extensively studied in many literatures @xcite .",
    "the renormalization group behaviors of the coupling constants are sensitive to the existence of new particles .",
    "if full multiplets of @xmath2 are added at a single scale , the unification of the gauge coupling constants is unaffected ( at least at the one - loop level ) , although the values of the gauge coupling constants depend on the particle content .",
    "contrary to the gauge coupling unification , the unification of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 yukawa coupling constants is expected to be significantly affected by new particles , because the renormalization group runnings of yukawa coupling constants are strongly dependent on the behaviors of the gauge coupling constants .",
    "importantly , there are various candidates of such new particles , like new fermions ( as well as their superpartners ) to realize peccei - quinn symmetry @xcite , extra chiral superfields in gauge mediation models @xcite , and so on . in addition",
    ", existence of extra matters at the mass scale of the superparticles is required if there exists a non - anomalous discrete @xmath6-symmetry @xcite .",
    "thus , their effects on the renormalization group runnings of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 yukawa coupling constants are of great interest in particular from the point of view of the yukawa unification based on susy guts .    in this paper , we study the @xmath0-@xmath1 unification in susy models with extra matters which have gauge quantum numbers under the sm gauge group .",
    "we will see that the existence of the extra matters may significantly affect the renormalization group running of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 yukawa coupling constants , and hence modify the @xmath0-@xmath1 unification . as we will discuss",
    ", the ratio of the @xmath0 to @xmath1 yukawa coupling constants may become very close to @xmath7 if the extra matters have yukawa couplings with mssm particles even though in a large fraction of the parameter space of the mssm , the yukawa coupling constant of @xmath0 becomes sizably smaller than that of @xmath1 at the gut scale .",
