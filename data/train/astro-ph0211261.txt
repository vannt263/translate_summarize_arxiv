    "the data discussed were taken during the later stages of the arecibo upgrade in 1997 and 1998 .",
    "these data were taken with the 430-mhz line feed in drift - scan mode , where sources transit the 430-mhz beam in roughly 42 seconds . moving the telescope",
    "once a day allowed successive declination strips to be surveyed .",
    "drift - scan surveys such as this have been very successful at discovering millisecond pulsars , with both the ` planet pulsar ' b1257 + 12 ( wolszczan 1992 ) and the relativistic binary pulsar b1534 + 12 ( wolszczan 1991 ) discovered in this mode .",
    "the data discussed here were taken with the penn state pulsar machine ( pspm ) with 8 mhz of bandwidth , 128 frequency channels and 80  @xmath0s sampling .",
    "our 8-sigma sensitivity is approximately 1 mjy for low - dm , long - period pulsars . in total ,",
    "130,000 overlapping beams ( or roughly 2700 deg@xmath1 ) of data were collected by our collaboration in this mode .",
    "these data are being processed on the 182-node cobra cluster at jodrell bank .",
    "this first step of the search processing is dedispersion over a range of trial dispersion measures .",
    "we search to dms twice those predicted by the taylor & cordes ( 1993 ) model for galactic electron density , to allow for any uncertainties in the model or unmodeled clumps of higher electron density .",
    "we mitigate the effects of rfi by inspecting the ffts of the 0-dm time series of all the beams on a tape ( typically 126 beams ) .",
    "all events with intensities greater than 6 sigma are recorded and any spectral bins which occur 6 times or more are excised . to search for periodicities , an fft of each dedispersed time series",
    "is taken , with summing of up to 16 harmonics .",
    "the threshold signal - to - noise for the periodicity search is 8 .",
    "we also search all dedispersed time series for isolated pulses above a signal - to - noise threshold of 4 .",
    "each dedispersed time series is smoothed successive times to increase sensitivity to broadened pulses .",
    "roughly 70% of all of the data , or roughly 1900 deg@xmath2 , has been processed thus far . in figure  1 , we show the sky coverage of the processed data .    in the data processed thus far ,",
    "we have re - detected 31 known pulsars and discovered 10 new pulsars .",
    "four of the 31 known pulsars and one of the 10 new pulsars are millisecond pulsars .",
    "roughly half of all pulsars were detected in both the periodicity and single - pulse searches .",
    "two known pulsars , j1918 + 1444 ( p = 1.18 s ) and j1915 + 0738 ( p = 1.54 s ) were detected as strong sources in the single - pulse search but were not detected in the periodicity search .",
    "this illustrates the importance of performing both types of search analyses , especially for pulsars with long periods and for short integration times .    including the data reported here , drift - scan searches done with arecibo over the upgrade period ( foster et al .",

    "detection rates of of one pulsar per 36 @xmath3 47 deg@xmath2 and one millisecond pulsar per 250 @xmath3 700 deg@xmath2 have been achieved in these searches .    in table 1",
    ", we list the new pulsars discovered in our data along with their periods , dispersion measures and detected signal - to - noises .",
    "timing observations have not yet been scheduled for these pulsars , so period derivatives are not available for most of them . preliminary timing data for psr  j0610 + 21 indicate that it is an isolated pulsar with a period derivative of @xmath4 and inferred age and magnetic field of 2  myr and @xmath5  gauss , respectively .",
    "timing residuals are shown in figure  2 .",
    "this pulsar is in a fairly unique place in the @xmath6 diagram and has parameters similar to psr  b1259@xmath363 , the pulsar - be star binary system .",
