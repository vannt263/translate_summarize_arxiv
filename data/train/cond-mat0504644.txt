    "the pressure dependence of the curie temperature provides important information on a ferromagnetic system and is an object of intensive studies both experimental @xcite and theoretical .",
    "@xcite the key question here is the character of the variation of various magnetic properties with decreasing distances between magnetic atoms . in an early work ,",
    "castellitz @xcite proposed an empirical rule ( interaction curve ) that describes the dependence of the curie temperature of the mn - containing ferromagnetic alloys with 4 - 5 valence electrons per molecule on the ratio @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the nearest - neighbor mn - mn distance and @xmath4 is the radius of the atomic mn 3d shell .",
    "the curve is supposed to represent the curie temperatures of various systems at ambient pressure as well as the pressure dependence of t@xmath1 of a given system .",
    "the function is not monotonous and has a maximum at the @xmath2 value of about 3.6 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_interactioncurve ] ) . according to the interaction curve",
    ", one can expect @xmath5 for alloys with @xmath6 ( e.g. , ni@xmath0mnsn and cu@xmath0mnin ) . on the other hand , the systems with @xmath7 ( e.g. ,",
    "nias - type mnas , mnsb and mnbi ) are expected to have negative pressure dependence of the curie temperature .",
    "these predictions are in agreement with experiment .",
    "@xcite    recently kanomata _ et al .",
    "_ suggested a generalization of the interaction curve to the case of 6 - 7 valence electrons per chemical formula .",
    "@xcite these systems form a new branch of the dependence of the curie temperature on the mn - mn distance ( fig .",
    "[ fig_interactioncurve ] ) .",
    "the available experimental values of the pressure derivative of the curie temperature , @xmath8 , for heusler alloys are consistent with those expected from the interaction curve.@xcite    early experiments on the pressure dependence of the curie temperature of heusler alloys have been performed in a low pressure region ( less than 0.5 gpa ) .",
    "recently gavriliuk _ _ et al.__@xcite have studied structural and magnetic properties of ni@xmath0mnsn in the pressure interval up to 10.8 gpa .",
    "the authors have found an increasing linear dependence of the curie temperature on applied pressure .",
    "the mssbaurer spectroscopy revealed partial interchange of the mn and ni atoms .",
    "the purpose of the present work is a first - principles study of the electronic structure , exchange interactions and curie temperature in ni@xmath0mnsn as a function of pressure .",
    "the main attention is devoted to the interval of the interatomic mn ",
    "mn distances from @xmath9 to @xmath10 that corresponds to the available experimental variation of this parameter .",
    "these values of the mn  mn distance are far above the value of @xmath11 that , according to interaction curve , separates the regions of positive and negative pressure gradients of the curie temperature for this group of systems . to verify the appearance of the non - monotonous behavior we extended the calculation to smaller values of the lattice constant corresponding to larger applied pressures .",
    "we compare empirical and calculated dependencies .",
    "the influence of the mn - ni atomic interchange on the magnetism of the system is also studied .",

    "@xcite a dense brillouin zone ( bz ) sampling @xmath12 is used . to establish the relation between the lattice parameters and applied pressure we use the following expression obtained experimentally in ref .",
    "@xmath13 where @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 is the volume of the unit cell at the ambient pressure .",
    "the radii of all atomic spheres are chosen equal .",
    "we describe the interatomic exchange interactions in terms of the classical heisenberg hamiltonian @xmath17 in eq.([eq : hamiltonian2 ] ) , the indices @xmath18 and @xmath19 number different sublattices and @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the lattice vectors specifying the atoms within sublattices , @xmath22 is the unit vector pointing in the direction of the magnetic moment at site @xmath23 .",
    "the systems considered contain three 3d atoms in the unit cell with positions shown in fig.[fig_lattice ] .",
    "we employ the frozen ",
    "magnon approach @xcite to calculate interatomic heisenberg exchange parameters .",
    "the calculations involve few steps . in the first step ,",
    "the exchange parameters between the atoms of a given sublattice @xmath18 are computed .",
    "the calculation is based on the evaluation of the energy of the frozen  magnon configurations defined by the following atomic polar and azimuthal angles @xmath24 the constant phase @xmath25 is always chosen equal to zero .",
    "the magnetic moments of all other sublattices are kept parallel to the z axis . within the heisenberg model  ( [ eq : hamiltonian2 ] )",
    "the energy of such configuration takes the form @xcite @xmath26 where @xmath27 does not depend on * q * and the fourier transform @xmath28 is defined by @xmath29    in the case of @xmath30 the sum in eq .",

    "the determination of the exchange interactions between the atoms of two different sublattices @xmath18 and @xmath19 is discussed in ref . .",
    "the curie temperature is estimated within the mean  field approximation for a multi  sublattice material by solving the system of coupled equations @xcite @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the average @xmath41 component of @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "eq.([eq_system ] ) can be represented in the form of eigenvalue matrix problem @xmath44 where @xmath45 , @xmath46 is a unit matrix and @xmath47 is the vector of @xmath48 .",

    "[ fig_exchange ] ) and resulting curie temperature ( table [ lattice - swap ] ) are very similar to the case without mn  ni interchange .",
    "however , the situation is different at applied pressure of 16 gpa .",
    "both mn - mn and mn - ni@xmath50 nearest - neighbor exchange parameters increase substantially .",
    "the remaining exchange parameters show small pressure dependencies .",
    "the interaction of the mn moment with the moment of the second ni atom is slightly reduced .",
    "the substantial increase of the leading exchange parameters with pressure results in considerable change of the curie temperature from 400 k at ambient pressure to 562 k at 16 gpa . assuming a linear variation of t@xmath1 with pressure we estimate the pressure derivative , @xmath51 , as 12.5 k / gpa .",
    "this value of @xmath51 exceeds strongly the corresponding value for the system without mn  ni atomic interchange .",
    "since the number of the swaped mn and ni atoms in our model is much larger than in the samples measured the calculated @xmath51 can not be directly compared with the experimental pressure derivative .",
    "important , however , that the mn  ni atomic interchange increases the pressure derivative of t@xmath1 that gives an explanation for the low value of the theoretical pressure derivative in the case of the system without swapping . a detailed study of the influence of the inter ",
    "sublattice atomic interchange on the electron properties of the heusler systems is an interesting extension of the present study .",
    "in conclusion , we have systematically studied the pressure dependence of exchange interactions and curie temperature in full heusler alloy ni@xmath0mnsn within the parameter ",
    "free density functional theory .",
    "we show that the character of the pressure dependence of the exchange interactions is a consequence of the complex interplay of competing trends in the electronic properties of the system . in agreement with experiment ,",
