    "<S> we present theoretical and experimental results on spatial quantum correlations induced by multiple scattering of nonclassical light . </S>",
    "<S> a continuous mode quantum theory is derived that enables determining the spatial quantum correlation function from the fluctuations of the total transmittance and reflectance . utilizing frequency - resolved quantum noise measurements , we observe that the strength of the spatial quantum correlation function can be controlled by changing the quantum state of an incident bright squeezed - light source . </S>",
    "<S> our results are found to be in excellent agreement with the developed theory and form a basis for future research on , e.g. , quantum interference of multiple quantum states in a multiple scattering medium . </S>"
