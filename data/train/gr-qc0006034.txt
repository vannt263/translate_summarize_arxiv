    "self - similar solutions of einstein s equations have been extensively studied in general relativity ( see  @xcite for the recent review and vast bibliography of this subject ) .",
    "they are interesting for several reasons .",
    "first , under the assumption of self - similarity einstein s equations simplify considerably and sometimes ( in spherical symmetry , for instance ) reduce to a system of ordinary differential equations .",
    "this enables one to study them using dynamical systems methods and in some cases it is even possible to find explicit solutions .",
    "second , self - similar solutions exhibit a well - defined singular behaviour at the blow - up .",
    "this makes them relevant in the studies of singularity formation ; in fact , most of the examples of naked singularities in the literature involve self - similar solutions .",
    "third , in some situations solutions of the cauchy problem starting from generic initial data evolve asymptotically to self - similar form , in other words , self - similar solutions can play the role of attractors . finally , the recent surge of interest in self - similar solutions is due to the fact that they appear as critical solutions at the threshold for black hole formation in gravitational collapse .",
    "such reasons motivated also this paper which , in a sense , is an extension of  @xcite where self - similar wave maps from minkowski spacetime into the 3-sphere were studied . it was proved in  @xcite that there exists a countable family of regular ( by regularity we mean analyticity below the cauchy horizon of the singularity ) css solutions , labeled by a nonnegative integer @xmath1 ( a nodal number ) .",
    "it was also shown that the @xmath1th solution has exactly @xmath1 unstable modes .",
    "the role of these solutions in the dynamical evolution was investigated in  @xcite where it was shown that : ( i ) the @xmath2 solution determines a universal asymptotics of singularity formation , ( ii ) the @xmath3 solution appears as a critical solution at the threshold for singularity formation ( see also  @xcite ) . here , we generalize  @xcite by turning on gravity , that is , we consider wave maps with the 3-sphere as the target and a domain manifold which is not minkowski but a spacetime satisfying the einstein equations with the @xmath0 sigma field as the source",
    ". the coupling of gravity is parametrized by a dimensionless coupling constant @xmath4 ( so that @xmath5 corresponds to gravity being turned off ) .",
    "since the coupling does not break scale invariance , it is natural to ask if the @xmath5 css solutions constructed in  @xcite , persist for nonzero @xmath4 . a positive answer to this question is the main result of our paper .",
    "more precisely , we show that the @xmath1th css solution which is analytic within the past light cone of the singularity ( in what follows we will refer to the past and future light cones of the singularity as to the past and future self - similarity horizons ( ssh ) ) , persists up to @xmath6 . however , this solution is regular ( that is , analytic up to the future ssh ) only for @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is an increasing sequence bounded above by @xmath9 . for @xmath10 , the past ssh of the @xmath1th solution",
    "is surrounded by a spacelike apparent horizon beyond which the solution can not be smoothly continued .",
    "although we have not studied linear stability , it seems plausible that the stability properties of solutions for small @xmath4 are the same as for @xmath5 . assuming this , the @xmath2 solution ( for @xmath11 ) is a generic naked singularity , while the @xmath3 solution ( for @xmath12 ) is a codimension - one naked singularity and the candidate for a critical solution .",
    "the css solutions constructed here should be relevant for the character of type ii critical collapse in the model which is currently being investigated by husa , lechner , prrer , thornburg , and aichelburg ( hlpta ) .",
    "their first report of progress  @xcite shows discretely self - similar ( dss ) behaviour at the threshold for black hole formation for @xmath13 and indicates that dss disappears for small @xmath4 .",
    "it is natural to expect that for @xmath14 the @xmath3 css solution takes over as a critical solution .",
    "preliminary results of hlpta seem to confirm this expectation  @xcite .",
    "a mechanism of the dss / css changeover is not yet understood , however .",
    "we anticipate that the standard type ii css critical behaviour will be observed only in the range @xmath15 .",
    "for @xmath16 we expect qualitatively the same behaviour as in the flat spacetime , where the @xmath3 solution sits at the threshold for the @xmath2 naked singularity formation .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section  2",
    "we define the model and derive the field equations . in section",
    "3 we construct a countable family of css solutions which are analytic between the center and the past ssh .",
    "an extension of these solutions beyond the past ssh is determined in section  4 . in section  5",
    "we speculate about the role of regular css solutions in the dynamical evolution .",
    "let @xmath17 be a map from a spacetime @xmath18 into a riemannian manifold @xmath19 .",
    "wave maps coupled to gravity are defined as extrema of the action @xmath20 with the lagrangian density @xmath21 here @xmath22 is newton s constant and @xmath23 is the wave map coupling constant . remarkably , in the `` physical '' case of @xmath24 dimensional spacetime ( to which our paper is confined ) , the coupling of gravity does not break scale invariance but introduces the dimensionless coupling constant @xmath25 .",
    "the field equations derived from ( 1 ) are the wave map equation @xmath26 where @xmath27 are the christoffel symbols of the target metric @xmath28 and @xmath29 is the dalembertian associated with the metric @xmath30 , and the einstein equations @xmath31 with the stress - energy tensor @xmath32 the target manifold is taken as the three - sphere @xmath33 with the standard metric in polar coordinates @xmath34 @xmath35 for the domain manifold we assume spherical symmetry and use schwarzschild coordinates @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are functions of @xmath39 .",
    "next , we assume that the wave maps are corotational , that is @xmath40 eq.(3 ) reduces then to the single semilinear wave equation @xmath41 where @xmath42 and the einstein equations are @xmath43 these equations are invariant under dilations @xmath44 so it is natural to look for continuously self - similar ( css ) solutions , that is solutions which are left invariant by the action of the homothetic killing vector @xmath45 . to study such solutions",
    "it is convenient to use similarity variables @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "then @xmath48 , so css solutions do not depend on @xmath49 . assuming this and using an auxiliary function @xmath50 , we reduce eqs.(8 - 12 ) to the system of ordinary differential equations ( where prime is @xmath51 ) @xmath52",
    "@xmath53 the combination of ( 14 ) and ( 16 ) yields the constraint @xmath54 in what follows , we will be solving eqs.(13 - 15 ) . the constraint ( 17 ) , which is the first integral of these equations ,",
    "could be used to eliminate @xmath38 from ( 13 ) but we find more convenient not to do so .",
    "the system ( 13 - 15 ) has a fixed singularity at the center @xmath55 and moving singularities at points where @xmath56 and/or @xmath57 . in terms of the similarity",
    "coordinate @xmath58 , the metric ( 6 ) takes the form @xmath59 hence the hypersurfaces @xmath60 are null ( provided that @xmath61 ) .",
    "after  @xcite we will refer to these characteristic hypersurfaces as to the self - similarity horizons ( ssh ) .",
    "the first @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the locus of the past light cone of the singularity at the origin @xmath64 and we will call it the past ssh .",
    "we use the remaining coordinate freedom to locate it at @xmath65 , that is @xmath66 . in the next section",
    "we will analyze the system ( 13 - 15 ) below the past ssh , that is for @xmath67 .",
    "expanding about @xmath68 , we get a one - parameter family of solutions of eqs.(13 - 15 ) @xmath69 we shoot these initial data towards @xmath55 and adjust the parameter @xmath70 so that the solution satisfies the regularity condition at the center , @xmath71 we find numerically that for each @xmath72 , there is an infinite sequence @xmath73 , @xmath74 , such that the corresponding solutions @xmath75 satisfy the boundary conditions ( 19 ) and ( 20 ) .",
    "the index @xmath1 denotes the number of solutions of the equation @xmath76 on the interval @xmath77 . in the limit @xmath78",
    ", the @xmath1th solution tends uniformly to the corresponding @xmath5 solution . in the limit @xmath79",
    ", the parameters @xmath80 diverge to infinity indicating that regular solutions disappear for @xmath81 .",
    "fig .  1 shows how the shooting parameters @xmath82 depend on @xmath4 for @xmath2 and @xmath3 . in fig .  2 we plot the @xmath2 and @xmath3 solutions for @xmath83 .    to summarize",
    ", we claim that for each @xmath72 there exists a countable family of css solutions which are analytic at the center and at the past ssh .",
    "the structure of these solutions is basically the same as for @xmath5 .",
    "qualitatively new things happen beyond the past ssh and now we turn our attention to this much more interesting region .",
    "for @xmath5 it was easy to show that all solutions starting at @xmath68 with initial values ( 19 ) remain regular for all @xmath84 .",
    "as we shall see below this is still true for @xmath85 provided that @xmath70 is sufficiently small ( note , however , that the metric function @xmath86 is monotone decreasing , so @xmath87 , which means that the geometry is not asymptotically flat but conical ) .",
    "however , if @xmath70 is large , the function @xmath88 is not monotone increasing for all @xmath84 and a `` sonic point '' develops for some finite @xmath89 , that is @xmath90 .",
    "we stress that this `` sonic point '' is not a ssh but an apparent horizon because @xmath91 as follows easily from ( 14 ) and ( 15 ) .",
    "these two kinds of behaviour are illustrated in fig .",
    "note that @xmath92 corresponds to the hypersurface @xmath93 so in order to analyze the global behaviour of solutions ( for @xmath94 ) we need to go `` beyond @xmath92 '' . to this end",
    "we define a new coordinate @xmath95 by @xmath96 we also define an auxiliary function @xmath97 . in these new variables , the past ssh where @xmath98 is at @xmath99 , while the future ssh ( which nota bene is a cauchy horizon )",
    "is located at some @xmath100 where @xmath101 .    in terms of @xmath95 and @xmath102 ,",
    "eqs.(13 - 15 ) become autonomous ( where now prime is @xmath103 ) @xmath104 the constraint ( 17 ) becomes @xmath105 from ( 19 ) the initial conditions at @xmath99 are @xmath106 we already know from the previous section that for each @xmath72 there is an infinite sequence @xmath73 determining solutions which are regular for all @xmath107 ( note that @xmath55 corresponds to @xmath108 ) .",
    "although these solutions are completely fixed at the past ssh by the requirement of analyticity at the center , in order to understand their behaviour for @xmath109 it is helpful to drop this requirement temporarily and consider solutions that start from generic initial conditions ( 26 ) .",
    "of course , such solutions in general are not analytic at the center .",
    "we first shall show that if @xmath70 is sufficiently small , then the solution remains regular up to the future ssh . to see this ,",
    "let @xmath110 . then ,",
    "in the limit @xmath111 , eqs.(22 - 24 ) reduce to @xmath112 with the initial conditions @xmath113 the limiting equations ( 27 ) and ( 28 ) are solved by @xmath114 and @xmath115 . substituting these solutions into ( 29 )",
    "we get the equation @xmath116 whose solution is given by the hypergeometric function @xmath117 $ ] .",
    "since solutions of eqs.(22 - 24 ) are continuous in @xmath70 and @xmath95 , by uniform continuity on compact intervals , the solutions with sufficiently small @xmath70 will tend to @xmath118 .",
    "asymptotic analysis at the future ssh , @xmath119 , yields the following leading order behaviour ( where @xmath120 ) @xmath121 where @xmath122 , @xmath123 , and @xmath124 is a free parameter .",
    "thus , a solution that is analytic at the past ssh , generically will be only @xmath125 at the future ssh is an integer multiple of @xmath126 , then the singular log terms in ( 32 ) are absent and the solution is smooth at the future ssh .",
    "one can show that this happens for discrete values of @xmath70 , which means that there exist solutions which are analytic _ both _ at the past and the future ssh .",
    "of course , for generic @xmath4 these solutions are singular at the center . ] .",
    "nevertheless , we checked that with the asymptotic behaviour ( 32 ) all curvature invariants remain finite as @xmath127 .",
    "we interpret this somewhat surprising fact as an indication that the singularity at the origin is naked .",
    "next , we shall show that solutions with large @xmath70 develop a `` sonic point '' for some finite @xmath128 , that is , @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "this time , we define the variables @xmath131 then , in the limit @xmath132 , eqs.(22 - 24 ) reduce to ( where now prime is @xmath133 ) @xmath134 with the initial conditions @xmath135 it follows from ( 36 ) and ( 37 ) that , in the limit @xmath136 , @xmath137 . plugging this into ( 34 ) and ( 35 ) , and using ( 37 ) , we get the limiting solution @xmath138 this solution develops a `` sonic point '' at @xmath139 . again , by uniform continuity on compact intervals , we conclude that for solutions of eqs.(22 - 24 ) with large @xmath70 ( and nonzero @xmath4 ) , the function @xmath140 attains a minimum and then tends to @xmath141 at some @xmath142 , while the function @xmath143 drops to zero at @xmath144 .",
    "the leading order behaviour at the apparent horizon at @xmath144 is @xmath145 where the positive parameters @xmath146 are constrained by the relationship @xmath147 .",
    "substituting this asymptotic behaviour into the metric ( 18 ) , one can readily verify that the hypersurface @xmath148 is spacelike .",
    "thus , solutions which start from the past ssh with initial conditions ( 26 ) , tend in finite `` time '' to @xmath118 if @xmath70 is small , or to @xmath149 if @xmath70 is large . in what follows",
    ", we will refer to these two behaviours as to type a and type b solutions , respectively .",
    "the solutions of type a obviously form an open set and we believe ( but have no proof yet ) that the same is true for the solutions of type b. if so , there must exist solutions which are not of type a or b , call them type c solutions . by definition ,",
    "type c solutions remain in the strip @xmath150 which implies that they exist for all @xmath95 ( because one can easily show that solutions can go singular only if @xmath151 ) .",
    "our numerical analysis of the structure of types a , b , and c can be summarized as follows ( @xmath152 ) the transition between types a and b occurs not at a single point but in a narrow interval @xmath153 . we suspect that this interval , which can be thought of as the boundary between the basins of attractions of type a and b behaviours , has a fractal structure",
    "this intriguing fact , suggesting perhaps a chaotic behaviour , is under investigation and will be described elsewhere . ] . for a given @xmath4 ,",
    "there exists a critical value @xmath154 such that solutions with @xmath155 are of type a , solutions with @xmath156 are of type b , and the solution with @xmath157 is of type c. thus , we have a bistable behaviour with two generic final states a and b , and the separatrix c. although the precisely critical initial condition @xmath157 can not be prepared numerically , in order to figure out a behaviour of the type c solution it is sufficient ( due to continuous dependence of solutions on initial conditions ) to determine the flow of nearly critical initial conditions @xmath158 . as is shown in fig .  3 ,",
    "before the marginally critical type a and b solutions tend to @xmath159 , they exhibit a long transient almost periodic behaviour .",
    "this leads us to conjecture that the type c solution is asymptotically periodic .",
    "the periodic intermediate attractor is clearly seen on the @xmath160 plane .",
    "the complete discussion of periodic solutions would take us too far afield , so we postpone it to the subsequent paper . here",
    ", let us only point out that the behaviour of css solutions outside the past ssh resembles some aspects of the dss type ii critical behaviour at the threshold for black hole formation .",
    "actually , it can be interpreted as a poor ode version of this phenomenon .",
    "the type a and b solutions are the analogues of dispersive and black - hole solutions , respectively .",
    "the type c solution is the analogue of the critical evolution which tends asymptotically to the critical periodic solution ( which is the analogue of the choptuon ) .",
    "we even have the analogue of the black - hole - mass scaling .",
    "namely , let @xmath161 be the unstable eigenvalue ( that is @xmath162 ) around the periodic solution .",
    "then the distance of a nearly critical flow ( corresponding to @xmath163 ) from the separatrix c is proportional to @xmath164 , which means that the length of the transient periodic phase is proportional to @xmath165 .",
    "the locus of the future ssh @xmath119 ( for the marginally critical type a solutions ) and the locus of an apparent horizon @xmath144 ( for the marginally critical type b solutions ) scale in the same manner ( see fig .  4 ) .",
    "this leading order scaling law is decorated in the next order by periodic wiggles with period @xmath166 .",
    "the origin of these wiggles is basically the same as in the case of black - hole mass scaling in the type ii dss critical collapse  @xcite . in passing ,",
    "we remark that the periodic solutions are nonperturbative in @xmath4  in the limit @xmath167 , the period and the amplitude of oscillations go to zero .",
    "now , we return to the countable family of css solutions constructed in section  3 and finally determine their extension beyond the past ssh .",
    "as follows from the above discussion , for a given @xmath4 , the behaviour of the @xmath1th solution outside the past ssh depends on whether @xmath82 is smaller or larger than @xmath168 : the solutions with @xmath169 are of type a ( and therefore regular in our terminology ) , while the solutions with @xmath170 are of type b. the function @xmath154 is monotone decreasing and @xmath171 as @xmath172 , while the functions @xmath80 are monotone increasing , hence we obtain an infinite sequence @xmath8 defined by the intersections @xmath173 ( see fig .  1 ) . since @xmath174 and @xmath175 as @xmath176 , the sequence @xmath8 is increasing and bounded above by @xmath9 .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the @xmath1th css solution from section 3 is regular iff @xmath7",
    ". the first two values of @xmath177 are @xmath178 and @xmath179 .",
    "the role of the css solutions considered in this paper in the dynamical evolution depends crucially on their stability with respect to small perturbations .",
    "although we have not performed the stability analysis , it seems plausible that for sufficiently small @xmath4 the stability properties are the same as for @xmath5 , that is the @xmath1th solution has exactly @xmath1 unstable modes .",
    "speculations that follow are based on this assumption .",
    "we expect that for @xmath16 the situation is qualitatively the same as in the flat spacetime , that is the @xmath2 solution determines the universal asymptotics of a naked singularity formation and the @xmath3 solution sits at the threshold of this process . for @xmath180",
    "the singularity of the @xmath2 solution is covered by a horizon so generic naked singularities presumably disappear ",
    "nota bene this could be interpreted as a gravitational desingularization phenomenon . in the range",
    "@xmath181 we expect the type ii threshold behaviour with the @xmath3 css critical solution .",
    "what happens for @xmath182 ?",
    "since the @xmath3 solution is not regular , it can not be a bona fide critical solution ( it can still appear as a local intermediate attractor , though ) .",
    "hlpta showed in  @xcite that for large values of @xmath4 the critical behaviour is dss and the echoing period @xmath183 increases rapidly as @xmath4 tends to @xmath184 from above ( see fig .  4 in  @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , they noticed small deviations from exact dss at this smallest @xmath4 value for which they observed dss critical collapse .",
    "these facts led them to conjecture that a critical solution ceases to be dss for still smaller values of @xmath4 .",
    "this conjecture fits nicely with our conjecture that a critical solution ceases to be css for @xmath185 .",
    "taken together , these conjectures suggest that the transition from css to dss critical behaviour is not sharp but rather has a crossover character .",
    "hlpta are currently running the computer simulations of the critical behaviour for the coupling constants @xmath186 , so the above speculations should be verified ( or falsified ) soon .",
    "hopefully , the numerical phenomenology will also help understand a yet unknown mechanism of the css / dss changeover .",
