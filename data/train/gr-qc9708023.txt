    "one expects to see the diffusive , localization properties of classical waves similar to electrons moving in the presence of impurities @xcite .",
    "wave propagation in curved spacetime is an important topic both in general relativity @xcite and in semiclassical gravity theory @xcite .",
    "classical scalar , electromagnetic and gravitational waves in friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe probe into the state of the universe and manifest in basic cosmological processes such as structure and defect formation , while that in the schwarzschild and kerr spacetimes depict high energy astrophysical processes in black holes .",
    "the second - quantized version in terms of quantum fields gives rise to cosmological particle creation @xcite and hawking radiation @xcite which are important processes in the early universe and black holes collapse .",
    "recent progress in studying planck energy processes , especially the backreaction effect of quantum fields in curved spacetime , underscores the importance of including fluctuations in particle creation @xcite and the associated energy momentum tensor of quantum fields @xcite , and fluctuations and dissipation in the dynamics of spacetime @xcite .",
    "the program devoted to quantum matter field and classical background spacetime with metric fluctuations mentioned above is rather involved , because it requires the calculation of four point functions @xcite and demands a self - consistent solution @xcite . in this paper , as a useful parallel , we attempt to address an easier problem , that of wave propagation in a stochastic spacetime . it is designed to highlight the effect of fluctuations in a background metric , while not demanding an explanation of their source , or their mutual influence .",
    "stochastic components in the metric can be induced by primordial gravitational waves , topological defects in the sub - planckian scale , or intrisic metric fluctuations of background spacetimes at the planck scale .",
    "their detection and analysis can provide valuable information about the state of the early universe and black holes .",
    "as distinct from the self - consistent treatment which is necessary for planck scale processes , wave propagation in curved spacetimes with metric stochasticity is a test - field treatment .",

    "we employ a useful observation to link up with the more familiar subject of wave propagation in random media studied extensively in condensed matter and mesoscopic physics @xcite .",
    "we first show the formal equivalence of the wave equations in curved spacetimes with wave propagation in a media in flat space and identify how the metric components appear in the permittivity function ( or refractive index ) of the media @xcite .",
    "then we introduce metric fluctuations as a stochastic component in the permittivity function and study wave propagation in a curved spacetime with metric stochasticity as if it were in a random media . in a spherically symmetric spacetime",
    "the wave equation for the radial part can be written in the form of a schrdinger equation in one dimension .",
    "the effect of the curvature of spacetime appears in the potential term in the equation .",
    "once the wave equation is reduced to the parametric form with a stochastic component , the familiar methods used in quantum field theory in curved spacetime and insights accumulated in mesoscopic physics can work in each other s advantage .",
    "we analyse in detail the cases with time - independent and time - dependent metric stochasticity and find that localization of electromagnetic waves occurs in a metric with time - independent fluctuations . in cases where there are time - dependent randomness in the metric , exponential instability in the particle production rate occurs .",
    "these are new effects due exclusively to the presence of metric fluctuations in the background spacetimes .",
    "for the schwarzschild metric , time - independent randomness outside the horizon will decrease the total luminosity of hawking radiation due to multiple scattering of waves .",
    "if the randomness reaches the horizon , it contributes to the fluctuations of hawking temperature .",
    "time - dependent stochasticity is a more complicated matter which requires a self - consistent analysis of the interaction between spacetime and the waves or fields as encoded in the fluctuation - dissipation relations @xcite .",

    "2 we study wave propagation in curved spacetime where the metric has a stochastic component .",
    "we use the friedmann - robertson - walker universe as an example to show that if the stochastic component of the metric is independent of time , and for a sufficiently smooth randomness the maxwell equation has the same form as a conformally coupled scalar wave equation . if the randomness appears only in the radial direction , the radial wave equation has the same form as an one dimensional schrdinger equation in a random potential .",
    "because the electromagnetic wave equation is conformally invariant , it bears the same form as in flat space . with a stochastic metric component",
    "we see that wave localizes in space . in sec . 4 , we study the case of time - dependent ( but space - independent ) stochasticity in the metric , and show that parametric amplification takes place giving rise to cosmological particle creation .",
    "however , because of the metric fluctuations the rate of this amplification increases exponentially in time .",
    "the fluctuations in the particle creation rate is also discussed . in sec . 5 , we study wave propagation in a schwarzschild spacetime with time - independent fluctuations .",

    "<S> we study novel effects associated with electromagnetic wave propagation in a robertson - walker universe and the schwarzschild spacetime with a small amount of metric stochasticity . we find that localization of electromagnetic waves occurs in a robertson - walker universe with time - independent metric stochasticity , while time - dependent metric stochasticity induces exponential instability in the particle production rate . for the schwarzschild metric , time - independent randomness can decrease the total luminosity of hawking radiation due to multiple scattering of waves outside the black hole and gives rise to event horizon fluctuations and thus fluctuations in the hawking temperature .    </S>",
