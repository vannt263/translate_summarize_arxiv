    "[ fig : bands]c ) , two electron pockets appear , at the @xmath11 and @xmath8 points in different principal valleys ( and in the corresponding equivalent points in the sbz ) .",
    "a more quantitative analysis of the dependence of the plasmon frequency on chemical potential is therefore necessary .",
    "this consideration is based on the fact that a pocket with parabolic dispersion  as in the case of the bottom of the second conduction miniband at the @xmath11 point in one principal valley , fig .",
    "[ fig : bands]c)is expected to generate a standard 2deg - type plasmon  @xcite , while a pocket located around a linear band crossing  as in the case of the dirac crossing between the first and second conduction minibands at the @xmath8 point in the other principal valley  is expected to generate a dp  @xcite .",
    "the frequency of these two kinds of plasmons scales differently with the carrier density @xmath7 in the pocket , i.e.  @xmath150 in the 2deg case and @xmath151 in the dp case .",
    "we therefore need to calculate the carrier density in each pocket as a function of the chemical potential @xmath6 , which is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : density ] at @xmath152 , and use this information in the analytical long - wavelength formulas for the plasmon dispersions reported in the main text .",
    "each formula has a single fitting parameter : the effective mass in the case of a parabolic - type dispersion and the fermi velocity in the case of a linear dispersion .",
    "we reiterate that , in the explored range of parameter space , no evidence for anisotropies in the plasmon dispersion has emerged  this explains why a single parameter is sufficient to well fit the numerical data extracted from the sharp peaks in the loss function .",
