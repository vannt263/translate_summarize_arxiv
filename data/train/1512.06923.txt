    "the enriques surfaces of type @xmath4 or @xmath5 form an irreducible one dimensional family , and each of the remaining types consists of a unique enriques surface .",

    "the classification problem of enriques surfaces with a finite group of automorphisms is still open .",
    "especially the case of characteristic 2 is most interesting . in the paper @xcite , bombieri and mumford classified enriques surfaces in characteristic 2 into three classes , namely , singular , classical and supersingular enriques surfaces . as in the case of characteristic @xmath9 , an enriques surface @xmath10 in characteristic 2 has a canonical double cover @xmath11 , which is a separable @xmath12-cover , a purely inseparable @xmath13- or @xmath14-cover according to @xmath10 being singular , classical or supersingular .",
