    "a pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) is a region of particles accelerated in a shock formed by the interaction between the pulsar s particle / magnetic flux and ambient matter such as a supernova remnant ( snr ) or the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "it has been theorized that the shock , called a termination shock , can accelerate particles to @xmath5 , which are believed to contribute to the cosmic ray spectrum from low energies up to the ` knee ' at @xmath5 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in a pwn , the shock - accelerated particles propagate downstream and emit synchrotron photons under the effects of the magnetic fields in that region @xcite .",
    "the electrons in the hard tail of the energy distribution produce x - rays , and thus the detection of synchrotron x - rays indirectly proves the existence of high energy electrons .",
    "therefore , x - ray emitting pwne are particularly interesting for studying particle shock acceleration , and for studying the interaction of high energy particles with their environments ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) .    since the accelerated particles in young pwne",
    "lose their energy primarily via synchrotron radiation at a rate proportional to @xmath6 , the energy distribution of the particles softens with distance from the shock , an effect called ` synchrotron burn - off ' .",
    "as the particle spectrum softens , the emitted photon spectrum is expected to soften as well .",
    "details of the softening depend on the physical environment and the particle flow in the pwne ; these have been modeled using particle advection ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and/or diffusion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , the advection models predict the radial profile of the photon index to be flat out to the pwn edge and then to soften rapidly , while diffusion models predict a gradual spectral softening with radius .",
    "the particle spectrum can be inferred from the photon spectrum as they are directly related .",
    "therefore , spatially resolved spectra or energy resolved images can be compared to model prediction to infer the particle flow properties and the physical environments in pwne .",

    "we have presented the first hard x - ray images of msh  15@xmath05_2 _ above @xmath28  kev .",

    "we find a possible spectral break at @xmath34 in the spectrum of entire pwn . from the spatially resolved spectral analysis",
    ", we found that the spectral index varies sinusoidally in the azimuth direction from @xmath22 in the north to 1.6 in the south at a distance of @xmath35 ( 1.5 pc ) from the pulsar and monotonically increases with distance from 1.6 to 2.5 ( fig .",

    "the _ nustar _ images in the hard band ( @xmath17  kev , figs .",
    "[ fig : image]e  h ) show that the source shrinks with energy in the 2-d projection on the sky , which is attributed to the synchrotron burn - off effect . while the effect has been shown for this source in a previous study of azimuthally integrated spectra @xcite",
    ", this is the first time it is shown with a 2-d imaging analysis over a broad x - ray band . in particular , we found that the burn - off effect is stronger in the northern direction than in the jet direction ( fig .  [",
    "fig : comp ] ) .",
    "although it is very difficult to build a full 2-d model that can reproduce the measured images , matching overall morphological changes in energy may give us important clues to understand particle outflow in the pwn .",
    "the change of the size with energy can be used for inferring properties of the particle flow in the pwn using theoretical models @xcite .",
    "for example , the results of @xcite can be rewritten in a form appropriate for sources whose spectral break @xmath39 between radio and x - ray power laws , and size index @xmath40 can both be measured : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the index of an assumed power - law function for a quantity @xmath43 ( @xmath44 or @xmath45 for mass density and magnetic - field strength , respectively ) , @xmath46 is the energy index of the radio spectrum , and @xmath47 is a confinement parameter ( e.g. , @xmath48 for conical jets , * ? ? ? * ) . for the values we derive for msh 15@xmath05_2 _ of @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 ( section  [ sec : imageana ] ) , the formula gives @xmath52 this condition requires either that the mass in the flow is not constant ( for instance , due to mass evaporated from thermal gas filaments joining the outflow ; * ? ? ? * ) , or that magnetic flux is not conserved ( for instance , due to turbulent amplification or reconnection ) : either @xmath53 or @xmath54 , or both , must be positive",
    ". various combinations of gradients can reproduce our results .",
    "for instance , a conical flow @xmath55 requires @xmath56 , approximately met if density is constant and magnetic field rises as radius  or vice versa .",
    "a confined flow with @xmath57 ( roughly parabolic ) would have @xmath58 , which could be satisfied with both constant density and constant magnetic field , or with one dropping as fast as the other increases .",
    "we find that the integrated spectrum of the entire nebula measured with _",
    "nustar _ is a simple power law with photon index 2.06 ( table  [ ta : spec ] ) .",
    "this is similar to values previously reported based on _ bepposax _ and _ integral _ data ( @xmath59 , @xmath60 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "chandra_-measured parameters for a single power - law model above 2  kev imply a harder spectrum than that measured with _ nustar _",
    "( see table  [ ta : spec ] ) , which is also seen in the spectra extracted for other inner regions ( e.g. , figs .",
    "[ fig : azvar ] and [ fig : radvar ] ) .",
    "we note that our _ chandra _ spectral fit results are consistent with that measured previously with _ bepposax _",
    "( @xmath61 in the 1.610  kev band for a 4@xmath22 aperture , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "since the large aperture include many subregions with different spectral parameters , we expect to see a harder spectrum at high energies if the spectra of the subregions are simple power laws in the 0.520  kev . however , the 320  kev _ nustar _ spectra are much softer than the _",
    "spectra , which is the opposite to what is expected from a sum of simple power - law spectra .",
    "we find that contamination of the pulsar and the backgrounds can explain only @xmath62 of the photon index discrepancy of the _ nustar _ and _ chandra _ measurements , while the measured difference is 0.15 .",
    "the correction for the pulsar , the rcw  89 contamination and the background variation in the data seem not to explain the discrepancy between the _ nustar _ and the _ chandra _ results .",
    "we find that the discrepancy between the _ nustar _ and the _ chandra _ measurements is likely to be caused , at least in part , by imperfect cross calibration of the instruments .",
    "however , if the break is real , it implies a break in the energy distribution of the shock accelerated electrons at @xmath2200  tev ( having the peak synchrotron power at 6  kev ) for a magnetic field strength of 10  @xmath10 g , assuming synchrotron emission ( e.g. , equation 5 in tc12 ) .",
    "we note that a spectral break in the x - ray band has recently been reported for g21.5@xmath00.9 @xcite and the crab nebula @xcite and may be common to other young pwne as well .",
    "if true , this has important implications on the particle acceleration mechanism in pwne .",
    "sensitive broadband x - ray observations of other pwne will be helpful .",
    "using the broadband x - ray data obtained with _ nustar _ and _",
    "chandra _ , we find an azimuthal variation of the spectral index . for the pwn  3c  58 , @xcite suggested a possible azimuthal variation of the spectral hardness based on a scenario where current flows out from the pulsar s pole and returns in the equator @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite did not find an obvious azimuthal variation in the pwn  3c  58 within @xmath63 pc for a distance 3.2 kpc we find for msh  15@xmath05_2 _ at @xmath19=1.54.5 pc .",
    "furthermore , we find the azimuthal spectral variation in msh  15@xmath05_2 _ is likely sinusoidal and different from that of the flux .",
    "this azimuthal spectral variation of the emission may hint at a large scale current flow , however , it could also be due to azimuthal diffusion of jet particles in msh  15@xmath05_2_.    a radial change of the spectral index of msh  15@xmath05_2 _ was reported by @xcite . while they integrated the spectrum over the full azimuthal angle , we measured the profiles for the northern and the jet directions separately because the two regions are different .",
    "we found that significant softening with radius is seen in both directions , more significantly in the northern region .",
    "interestingly , the radial profile of the photon index ( rate of spectral steepening ) flattens with radius as is also seen in 3c  58 @xcite .",
    "an outflow model considering both diffusion and advection was developed by @xcite ( tc12 hereafter ) , where they calculated the change of the spectral index with distance from the central pulsar with an assumed electron injection spectrum and diffusion coefficient , and were able to reproduce the radial variation of the spectral index for three compact pwne , the crab nebula , g21.5@xmath00.9 , and 3c  58 .",
    "the model has been applied to pwne where the particle escape times ( the times for particles to diffuse a distance @xmath19 in the bohm limit ) , are longer than their ages ( equation 2 in tc12 ) : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the radius of the pwn , @xmath66 is the energy of synchrotron emitting particles , and @xmath67 is the magnetic - field strength in the pwn .",
    "using the size @xmath68 , @xmath69 100600 tev @xcite , and an estimation of the magnetic - field strength of 817  @xmath70 @xcite , we find that @xmath71 is 50007000 yr , greater than the spin - down estimated age of @xmath72 yr . since the photon spectrum we are using in this work corresponds to a smaller @xmath66 , @xmath71 can be larger than the above estimation . however , we note that there have been suggestions that the true age of the pwn is @xmath73 yr based on the association with rcw  89 , larger than the spin - down estimation ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "if so , there may be particles escaping the pwn and the particle spectrum in the outer parts of the pwn becomes steeper , which may be the case for old ( @xmath74 ) pwne . for young pwne ,",
    "tc12 uses a reflecting boundary condition at the outer edge of the pwn .",
    "we note that the tc12 model is for spherically symmetric pwne and may not be optimal for msh  15@xmath05_2_. however , the azimuthal variation in the northern nebula is not large ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : azvar ] ) , and thus the model may provide a reasonable description of the source in that region .    in this model , the angular size of the ` flat ' region where the radial profile of the spectral index is flat can be used to estimate the diffusion coefficient ( equation 14 of tc12 ) .",
    "this is calculated using the following equations : @xmath75^{1/4 } -1\\right)\\ ] ] and @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the angular size of the region that has a flat photon index profile , @xmath78 is the angular size of the pwn , @xmath79 is the photon frequency , and @xmath80 is the diffusion coefficient .",
    "we find that photon index profile steepens more slowly beyond @xmath81 and @xmath82 in the northern and the jet regions , respectively .",
    "note that the radial profile of the spectral index in the northern nebula shows a flat region between @xmath83@xmath84 although the profile seems not to show any flat region in the southern nebula .",
    "we use the value for the northern nebula for the size of the flat region of tc12 . assuming the size of the source is @xmath85 and using the above formulae with @xmath86  hz ( 1  kev )",
    ", we estimated the diffusion coefficient to be 413@xmath87 for @xmath67=817 @xmath10 g , which is slightly larger than that estimated for 3c  58 by numerical modeling ( @xmath88 , tc12 ) .    using the diffusion coefficient we estimated above , we calculate the critical particle energy @xmath89 for which the diffusion distance is equal to the size of the pwn ( see table  3 of tc12 ) and where the electron distribution has a break @xcite , using formulae given by tc12 : @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "for msh  15@xmath05_2 _ , we find @xmath92 to be 130190 tev for @xmath67=817 @xmath10 g .",
    "it is interesting to note that this is similar to the maximum electron energies inferred from broadband sed modeling ( 130 or 250 tev ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and that inferred from the possible spectral break at 6  kev we measured in section  [ sec : totspec ] .",
    "we note that the spectrum in the jet direction is significantly softer in the innermost j1 region compared to that in the farther j2 region .",
    "such behavior is not expected in simple advection and/or diffusion models , since the synchrotron emitting particle spectrum only softens with distance .",
    "this simple picture may not be appropriate in the regions where the particle flow may be more complicated due to magnetic hoop stress as suggested for this source by @xcite .",
    "the authors found a ring - like structure with @xmath9310@xmath3 using _ chandra _ data and interpreted the structure as the termination shock for this pwn .",
    "based on the morphology , the authors further suggested that the shock accelerated particles are diverted and squeezed towards the poloidal direction right below the ring due to magnetic hoop stress ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we also find that the jet structure becomes narrower to @xmath94 and then broader .",
    "furthermore , the spectral hardness turn - over , non - monotonic variation of the spectral index ( see fig .  [ fig : radvar ] ) , happens near the location where the jet is narrowest , which might be occurring because of the compression of the magnetic fields and particles .",
    "we presented 2-d maps of the spectral parameters .",
    "the maps visualize the properties of the source very well , and can be compared with 3-d pwn models .",
    "we showed that the 2-d map of @xmath4 has a shell - like structure .",
    "the density is low near the central pulsar , increasing out to @xmath95 ( see also figs .",
    "[ fig : azvar ] and [ fig : radvar ] ) .",
    "we note that the fit value of @xmath4 could in principle be degenerate with other spectral parameters .",
    "however , we do not find clear evidence of correlation between @xmath4 and photon index or flux from our analysis ( see section  [ sec:2dmap ] ) , and using a constant @xmath4 degrades the fit significantly .",
    "a higher column density is observed in the south and the east directions ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:2dmap ] ) .",
    "if the material responsible for @xmath4 was produced by the supernova , one would expect the pulsar to have a kick in the opposite direction of the material , towards the north - east direction , which is consistent with the direction of the kick velocity for psr  b1509@xmath058 estimated by @xcite based on 2800 days of timing .",
    "however , @xcite found no evidence of proper motion using 28 years of timing data",
    ". nevertheless , we do not see any enhanced emission in the shell - like structure , which makes the supernova ejecta scenario less plausible .",
    "alternatively , the structure may be an interstellar bubble produced by the stellar wind of the supernova progenitor ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the wind model ,",
    "the size of the bubble is given by a simple formula : @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the mass loss rate of the progenitor in units of @xmath98 , @xmath99 is the speed of the wind in units of @xmath100 , @xmath101 is the number density ( @xmath102 ) of the interstellar medium , and @xmath103 is the time in units of @xmath104 .",
    "the radius of the ring structure we observe is @xmath25 pc , much smaller than the calculated value for a typical o6 star .",
    "however , the value can vary significantly for different input parameters , and due to spatial non - uniformity of the interstellar medium or radiative loss ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the asymmetric shell structure may be explained by outbursts of massive stars .",
    "the massive star progenitors of core - collapse supernovae undergo a variety of instabilities that drive episodic mass loss : e.g. , pulsations driven by bumps in the continuum opacity @xcite and explosive shell burning @xcite .",
    "these outbursts occur up until the collapse of the star and are believed to have large asymmetries .",
    "an outburst a few thousand years prior to collapse could explain the features we observe at 5 pc in the remnant .    if , as suggested above , the shell - like structure at r@xmath23@xmath22 was formed by the stellar wind , the structure would have to avoid being swept up or destroyed by the sn ejecta .",
    "if the supernova ejecta did not fill a full spherical shell , a part of the wind - produced shell can be left over . in this case ,",
    "density of the shell is expected to be higher in the direction where the supernova ejecta were less dense .",
    "we see such a trend when comparing our @xmath4 map with the radio image of the snr ( figs .  2 and 3 of * ?",
    "* ) ; there are more ejecta in the northern region than in the southern region .",
    "we have estimated the mass of hydrogen contained in the observed shell - like structure .",
    "using the measured radial profile of @xmath4 shown in figure  [ fig : radvar]d , the excess mass compared to the central region is @xmath2460@xmath105 , large compared to the @xmath212@xmath105 one would estimate for a sphere with @xmath106 for typical interstellar density of @xmath107 .",
    "furthermore , the large amount of material in the structure should produce hi emission , which we do not see in the 20 cm map ( fig .  4 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . this may be because the radio continuum emission was not subtracted in the radio map and/or because the x - ray measurement is sensitive only to foreground material while the radio observations are sensitive to both foreground and background structures .",
    "we note that we can not unambiguously rule out the possibility of a constant @xmath4 over the field ; the observed @xmath4 being an artifact of a more complex underlying continuum .",
    "thus , it is very difficult to clearly interpret the structure using x - ray observations only .",
    "nevertheless , if the shell - like structure in the @xmath4 map is intrinsic to the source , it may support the idea of the existence of an underdense region around the supernova progenitor , which was suggested to explain the discrepancy between the pulsar s characteristic age of @xmath21700 yr @xcite and the snr age of @xmath10810000 yr based on the rcw  89 association @xcite .",
    "this requires further confirmation by observations in other bands .",
    "we have presented energy - resolved images of the pwn msh  15@xmath05_2 _ in the hard x - ray band ( @xmath109 ) for the first time .",
    "the images in different x - ray bands shrink with energy as a result of the synchrotron burn - off effect . on small scales ( @xmath11050@xmath3 ) , we show that the size shrinkage with energy can be explained with a particle advection model . using this model ,",
    "we discuss properties of the wind outflow in the jet direction .",
    "we find that the combined _ nustar_/_chandra _ spectrum of the entire pwn requires a break at 6  kev , which may be due to cross - calibration effects .",
    "however , if the spectral break is intrinsic to the source , it implies a break in the shock accelerated electron distribution .",
    "we measured the spectral index profiles on large scales ( @xmath935@xmath22 ) in the northern and jet directions .",
    "the spectrum softens with radius in both directions , an effect we interpret with a combined diffusion / advection model ; further numerical simulations with the model are required for more accurate interpretation .",
    "we find an interesting sinusoidal variation of the spectral hardness in the azimuthal direction which may have implications for the particle diffusion in the pwn .",
    "such a variation has not been seen in other pwne , though it has been predicted in pulsar current flow models @xcite .",
    "we find a spectral hardness turn - over in the jet direction at a distance of @xmath235@xmath3 from the pulsar .",
    "finally , we presented 2-d maps of spectral parameters of the source , and find that the @xmath4 map shows an interesting shell - like structure which implies high particle density .",
    "however , this feature could result from a complex underlying continuum , and so requires further confirmation .",
