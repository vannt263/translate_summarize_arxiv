    "in any theory of quantum gravity , classical space - time is likely to arise only as an approximate concept .",
    "this problem is especially obvious in canonical quantum gravity . in particular , there is no notion of time in quantum gravity .",
    "hence , it may seem like the causal structure of the classical metric is absent in the quantum theory as well .",
    "however , we can incorporate the causal structure at the fundamental level in a theory of quantum gravity . in a path - integral formulation of quantum gravity",
    ", we express the transition amplitude from one quantum three - geometry to another as a sum of histories .",
    "causality can be included by limiting the sum to only those histories which have a well - defined causal structure .",
    "this has been suggested as early as @xcite by teitelboim .",
    "there has been further work in this direction in mini - superspace models @xcite .",
    "similar ideas have also been explored in the work on causal evolution of spin networks @xcite and in two space - time dimensions @xcite . in this paper , we explore some of these ideas more concretely in the context of loop quantum gravity .",
    "we shall construct a formal power series expansion of teitelboim s causal propagator in canonical ( loop ) quantum gravity .",
    "we show that each term in the power series has a fixed causal structure which suggests that each of the terms may admit an interpretation as a quantum lorentzian space - time .",
    "we then define a more general object  a `` causal spin foam ''  which incorporates the key features which allow us to do so .",
    "causal spin foams are an extension of spin foam models which have been introduced in the quantization of euclidean gravity @xcite .",
    "these are space - time models which have a close connection with the loop approach to canonical quantum gravity .",
    "we shall also relate causal spin foams to the work on causal evolution of spin networks which was proposed as a model for lorentzian quantum gravity .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized in the following manner .",
    "we begin with a brief introduction to spin networks and canonical loop quantum gravity , spelling out the main ideas that we use later .",
    "then , in section 3 , we give the details of the construction of the propagator . following that , we give the general definition of a causal spin foam and",
    "show how the causal evolution model relates to it .",
    "finally , we end the paper with a discussion of some open and interesting issues .",
    "canonical general relativity ( gr ) can be written as a theory of a real su(2 ) connection @xmath0 over a compact three - manifold @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the conjugate variable to the connection is the densitized triad @xmath2 which takes values in the lie algebra ( 2 ) . using these variables , the constraints of gr are three gauss constraints which impose su(2 ) invariance , three diffeomorphism constraints which impose diffeomorphism invariance on @xmath1 , and the hamiltonian constraint , which is the generator of coordinate time evolution .",
    "a review with the details of and references for the construction of the quantum theory can be found in @xcite . in this section",
    ", we present a brief summary of the key results we shall use in this paper .      the kinematical hilbert space of su(2 ) invariant states , @xmath3 , has a convenient orthonormal basis called the spin network basis @xcite . a spin network state is constructed as follows :",
    "consider an oriented , closed graph @xmath4 which is embedded in the spatial manifold @xmath1 .",
    "to each edge of @xmath4 assign a representation @xmath5 of su(2 ) and to each node of the graph , assign an intertwiner @xmath6 such that @xmath7 a spin network is then defined by the triplet @xmath8 . a spin network state is then defined as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the holonomy of the connection @xmath11 along the edge @xmath12 in the representation @xmath5 of su(2 ) . the inner product between two spin network states @xmath13 and @xmath14 is given by @xmath15    in this basis , geometric operators such as area and volume are diagonal and have discrete spectra ( this has been discussed by a number of authors .",
    "see for example references @xcite ) .",
    "spin network states can thus be thought of as describing discrete three - geometries .",
    "the group of spatial diffeomorphisms acts on the states in @xmath3 in a natural fashion .",
    "the action of a finite diffeomorphism @xmath16 on a spin network state for example is given by @xmath17 this simply means that the action of the diffeomorphism is to send the state to one which is based on the shifted graph .",
    "the space of solutions of the diffeomorphism constraint of the theory , @xmath18 , is defined by @xmath19-knot states which are diffeomorphism equivalence classes of spin networks .",
    "@xmath18 is a subset of the algebraic dual of @xmath20 , so every @xmath19-knot state acts on spin networks @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the diffeomorphism equivalence class to which @xmath23 belongs .",
    "we can use this to define an inner product on diffeomorphism invariant states : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a representative of the diffeomorphism equivalence class defined by @xmath26 .",
    "the hamiltonian constraint is the least understood piece of the dynamics of canonical gr .",
    "one of the reasons for this is that it has no obvious geometrical interpretation like the gauss and diffeomorphism constraints .",
    "the smeared hamiltonian @xmath27 = \\int d^3x\\ , n(x , t)hat{h}(x),\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is the lapse function and @xmath29 is the hamiltonian constraint , can be thought as the generator of coordinate evolution in canonical gravity .",
    "many versions of the hamiltonian constraint operator ( hco ) have been proposed @xcite .",
    "we describe here only the features of the operator defined in @xcite which we shall need in the next section .",
    "however , the results we derive there can easily be adapted to any other regularization of the hco .",
    "the lorentzian hco can be written as a sum of two operators @xmath30=\\hat{c}_e[n ] + \\hat{t}[n]\\ ] ] where @xmath31 $ ] is the hco for the euclidean version of the theory .",
    "the action of the euclidean hco can be described graphically as follows  the operator acts on the nodes of the spin network state . for every pair of edges at a node",
    ", it adds a new edge between them and changes the spins of the edges at the node .",
    "the precise location of the new edge is unimportant .",
    "the graphical action of the second term @xmath32 $ ] is less well understood , but it can heuristically be thought of adding two non - intersecting edges at every node .",
    "these new edges can either be added between the same pair of edges or between two different pairs of edges at the node .",
    "figure [ hamfig ] shows the graphical actions of both the terms .",
    "the non - symmetric operator defined in @xcite only creates new edges .",
    "we take here the symmetrized version @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath33 = \\hat{h}_e[n ] + \\hat{t}^s[n]$ ] of the operator which both adds and removes edges .",
    "we have denoted by @xmath34 $ ] and @xmath35 $ ] , the symmetric versions of @xmath31 $ ] and @xmath32 $ ] respectively .",
    "the matrix elements of the symmetric hco are given by @xmath36\\ket{s } & = & \\bra{s'}\\hat{c}[n]\\ket{s } +      \\overline{\\bra{s'}\\hat{c}[n]\\ket{s}}\\nonumber \\\\      & = & \\bra{s'}\\hat{c}_e[n]\\ket{s}+\\overline{\\bra{s'}\\hat{c}_e[n]\\ket{s } }      + \\bra{s'}\\hat{t}[n]\\ket{s } + \\overline{\\bra{s'}\\hat{t}[n]\\ket{s}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the action of @xmath31 $ ] can be written using the notation of @xcite as follows : @xmath37\\ket{s } = a^\\beta_i(s ) \\ket{s^\\beta_i;i , n}\\ ] ] where the index @xmath38 runs over the nodes of the spin network @xmath23 .",
    "and @xmath39 runs over pairs of edges at every node and over a sign ( @xmath40 ) for each of those edges .",
    "there is an implied summation over both @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the object on the right hand side is defined by @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the value of the lapse function at the point @xmath43 which the position of the @xmath38th node in the spin network @xmath44 .",
    "it is important to note that this is the only non - diffeomorphism invariant part in the definition of the hamiltonian constraint .",
    "there is a regularization choice to be made about the positions of the new vertices @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 which are created by the action of the operator .",
    "we choose that all of these are distinct from the position of initial point @xmath43 .",
    "this is a arbitrary choice , but is the most general one that can be made . in an analogous fashion , we can write the action of the second term in eq .",
    "( [ ham ] ) as @xmath48\\ket{s } = b^{\\beta\\beta'}_i(s ) \\ket{s^{\\beta\\beta'}_i;i , n}\\ ] ] where once again the indices @xmath39 and @xmath49 run over pairs of edges at every node and over a sign ( @xmath40 ) for each of those edges .",
    "the coefficients @xmath11 and @xmath50 are functions only of the spins of the edges and can be calculated explicitly . an interesting point to note",
    "is that with the above regularization , the states which result from the actions of the two pieces of the hco are in based on different graphs .",
    "combined with the inner product defined in eq.([diffip ] ) , this implies that there do not exist states @xmath23 and @xmath26 such that both the terms of the hco have non - zero matrix elements between them .",
    "we want to study the dynamics of quantum gravity in a sum over histories approach .",
    "the key object in this formalism is the transition amplitude from one three - geometry to another which is given by a path integral which sums over all histories ( or four - geometries in the case of gr ) which connect the two given three - geometries .",
    "as we have already seen , in canonical gr , the spatial or three - geometry is described by ( diffeomorphism invariant ) @xmath19-knot states . in other words ,",
    "given an initial @xmath19-knot states @xmath26 and a final one @xmath23 we would like to calculate : @xmath51 = \\sum_\\mathrm{quantum\\ 4-geometries\\ g } a_\\mathrm{g},\\ ] ] where the sum is over all ( suitably defined ) quantum four - geometries ( histories ) which interpolate between the initial and final states and @xmath52 is the amplitude for each history .",
    "since the transition amplitude is composed of many histories , we can consider the history to be a more elementary concept than the amplitude .",
    "each history can be thought of as a quantum four - geometry , hence , it is reasonable that causality should be incorporated into each history before we calculate the transition amplitude by performing the sum over histories .",
    "then , each history should have an interpretation as a quantum lorentzian space - time with a well defined causal structure . in the rest of the section",
    ", we will see how some of these formal notions can be made more precise .",
    "the finite evolution operator which propagates a state from an initial spatial hypersurface @xmath53 a time @xmath54 to the final spatial hypersurface @xmath55 at time @xmath56 is got by exponentiating the smeared hamiltonian constraint of eq .",
    "( [ ham - evol ] ) and integrating over the lapse function , @xmath57 \\exp(-i\\int dt \\int d^3x\\ , n(x , t)h(x)),\\ ] ] where @xmath58 $ ] is the ( formal ) measure over the lapse . in our calculations",
    ", we use the normalized measure on scalar functions which was constructed in @xcite .",
    "the key properties of this measure are that it is well defined for cylindrical functions of the lapse ( i.e. functions which depend only on the value of the lapse at a finite number of points ) and that it is invariant under the action of spatial diffeomorphisms .",
    "the matrix elements of @xmath59 between two three - geometries define the transition amplitudes between them .",
    "we can rewrite eq .",
    "( [ prop ] ) in the simpler form @xmath60 \\exp(-i\\int d^3x\\ , t(x)h(x)),\\ ] ] where @xmath61 is proper time elapsed between the initial and final spatial slices and is given by @xmath62 in @xcite , the requirement that causality be incorporated into the propagator is imposed by demanding that we include in the path integral only those histories in which @xmath55 lies to the complete future of @xmath53 .",
    "this can be incorporated into the propagator directly by restricting the range of integration over @xmath61 to only positive proper times .",
    "we call the propagator evaluated with this restriction , the _",
    "causal propagator_.    before we present the details of the operator @xmath59 , we would like to discuss the restriction on the proper time in some more detail . recall that in the canonical decomposition of classical gr , the choice @xmath63 is not allowed since it leads to a degenerate space - time metric .",
    "thus , assuming that the lapse is a continuous function , it must either be positive everywhere or negative everywhere .",
    "in other words , the range of @xmath61 is divided into two disjoint classes , @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "the crucial assumption is that the transition amplitude corresponds to integration over only one of these .",
    "this is motivated by the case of the relativistic point particle where a similar restriction leads to the feynman propagator @xcite .",
    "the particular choice of positive proper time is a matter of convention .",
    "since we are free to calculate the propagator in any gauge , let us now fix the gauge using the proper time gauge conditions @xcite .",
    "in particular , these require @xmath66 . with this condition",
    ", we have @xmath67 .",
    "the causal propagator can then be written as @xmath68 \\exp(-i\\int d^3x n(x)h(x)).\\ ] ] notice that in this form , the causal propagator is formally similar to the projector over physical states as defined in @xcite .",
    "however , in that case , the range of integration over @xmath69 is unrestricted .",
    "we would like to emphasize that while the projector can be defined purely at the level of canonical gravity , the propagator is a path - integral .",
    "we shall explore the similarities and differences between the two operators in greater detail in a future work .",
    "for the present , we exploit the computational techniques developed in @xcite to evaluate the causal propagator .",
    "we wish to calculate transition amplitude which is the matrix element of @xmath59 between two @xmath19-knot states , namely @xmath70 .",
    "let us start by limiting the range of integration of @xmath71 such that @xmath72 this can be thought of putting an infra - red regulator .",
    "the propagator is then recovered by taking the limit @xmath73 .",
    "we denote by @xmath74 the propagator where the upper limit of integration for @xmath69 is @xmath75 .",
    "thus , we have @xmath76 \\bra{s } \\exp(-i\\int d^3x      n(x)h(x))\\ket{s'}.\\ ] ] following @xcite , we note that the above expression is formally three - diffeomorphism invariant and we can introduce an extra integration of the diffeomorphism group : @xmath77 \\int_{0<n(x)<t }      [ dn ] \\bra{u(\\phi)s } e^{-i\\hat{h}[n]}\\ket{s'},\\ ] ] where @xmath78 is the finite diffeomorphism corresponding to @xmath16 , @xmath79 is the normalization factor introduced in the integration over diff and @xmath44 belongs to the diffeomorphism equivalence class of @xmath23 .",
    "the integration over the diffeomorphism group is needed later to take care of the non - diffeomorphism invariant parts of the action of the hco .",

    "it is just the product of the values of the lapse at a finite number of points .",
    "the functional integral over @xmath71 can be performed in a simple fashion using the normalized measure on scalar functions constructed in @xcite .",
    "it can simply be replaced by a finite number of ordinary integrals over the values of @xmath71 at the points where the operator acted . since the measure is diffeomorphism invariant , the integral over diff",
    "can be performed trivially as well .",
    "thus , each term in the formal power series can then be calculated and is finite .",
    "in fact , each term in the power series has the general form @xmath84 where @xmath85 is a shorthand for the @xmath19-knot state generated after @xmath86 actions of the hco ( that is , either @xmath34 $ ] or @xmath35 $ ] ) , @xmath87 is the product of the numerical coefficients for each action and @xmath88 is the remaining integral over the lapse . to evaluate @xmath6",
    ", we need to specify the limits of integration for the integrals .",
    "teitelboim s original proposal is to perform the integration for all positive lapses .",
    "however , a nave integration following @xcite ignores the causal structure induced by multiple actions of the constraint operator .",
    "we show how this should be taken into account in evaluating the propagator .",
    "intuitively , the idea is as follows : any time there are two or more actions of the hco , there is a possibility that a particular action takes place at a vertex which was created or affected by a previous action .",
    "thus , viewed from a space - time point of view , it lies to the causal future of the other action .",
    "this fact must be reflected in the propagator amplitude .",
    "to do this more precisely , let us now look at the second order ( @xmath89 ) term of the propagator in more detail .",

    "( [ quad ] ) , but the same considerations apply to all the four terms .",
    "let the first action of the euclidean hco take place at a node @xmath43 of the spin network @xmath26 .",
    "let us suppose that the action is the addition of an edge .",
    "let @xmath45 be the position of the node after the action and let @xmath46 and @xmath47 be the positions of the nodes where the edge was added .",
    "there are two distinct possibilities for the second action of the hamiltonian .",
    "it can either act at one of the three nodes @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 and @xmath47 , but this can be traced back to the choice of the volume operator in that reference . choosing a different volume operator fixes this issue . ] or it can act at some other node of the spin network .",
    "let us study these two possibilities in more detail .",
    "if the second action takes place at a node which is one of @xmath45 , @xmath46 or @xmath47 , then in a sense , it is to the future of the first one .",
    "otherwise , it is causally unrelated to the first action and they commute .",
    "thus , there is a partial order between the two actions of the hamiltonian .",
    "we would like to identify this partial order with a discrete notion of causality .",
    "this is motivated by the fact that in standard quantum field theory , operators at spatially separated points commute , whereas ones at causally related points do not . since , we do not have a background metric to define the causal structure , we suggest that _ the commutativity of the actions of the hco should define causality_. in other words , non - commuting actions correspond to causally related points whereas commuting actions correspond to space - like separated points",
    ".    a nave functional integration over positive lapses does not capture this feature .",
    "if we are to follow teitelboim s basic idea of incorporating causality in each history , then we must further modify the propagator to include this discrete causality .",
    "this is our key observation .",
    "let us now look at one particular way of achieving this .",
    "the scheme we propose is the following : since the points @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 lie to the future of @xmath43 ( we denote this by @xmath91 ) , the domain of integration for the proper time should reflect this .",
    "this can be understood as follows : suppose the second action takes place at @xmath45 .",
    "the domain of integration of @xmath92 can be split into two parts @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "the first integral vanishes because the node at @xmath45 does not exist for @xmath95 .",
    "thus , the only contribution is from the second integral .",
    "that is , the domain of integration can be restricted to such that proper time at the second action is greater than that at the first action if the second action takes place at one of the nodes created by the first action . in the proper - time gauge",
    ", this translates to a condition on the domain of integration of the lapse .",
    "intuitively , we can think of the points @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 as having been created by the action of the constraint operator at @xmath43 and thus being in future of this action in every history in this class .",
    "on the other hand , if the second action takes place at some other node @xmath96 which is not a product of the first action then there is no limitation on the domain of integration over the lapses  we integrate over strictly positive lapses at both @xmath43 and @xmath96 .",
    "this can be thought of as the analogue of time - ordering in the absence of a background space - time metric .",
    "we can now calculate the functional integrals over @xmath69 for the two cases .",

    "we have used a diagrammatic notation to indicate the causal relations : two unrelated vertices are denoted by disjoint points , whereas a causal relation is indicated by drawing an arrow from the past point to the future point .",

    "namely , each vertex where the action takes place can have at most one vertex to immediate past .",
    "this means that causal diagrams such as   can not appear among the terms of the power series .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that the action of the hco is always localized at one vertex and can be regarded as a manifestation of the ultra - local character of the hco @xcite .",
    "we shall return to this issue briefly in the next section .",
    "this completes our calculation of the causal propagator except for the limit @xmath116 . for any finite value of @xmath75 ,",
    "each term in the power series is finite .",
    "since the causal propagator is essentially a time - ordered exponential , it is clear that the limit @xmath116 should be divergent .",
    "we should point out that this is an infra - red divergence which may be regulated by adding a small imaginary piece to the hco analogous to the case of the feynman propagator .",
    "we shall not attempt to take this limit here , but we will discuss it some more at the end of the paper .",
    "a very powerful way of keeping track of the terms in the power series expansion in terms of branched two - surfaces was introduced in @xcite .",
    "we use the same basic ideas , but also incorporate the causal structure which we discussed in the previous subsection .    each term in the power series for @xmath117 is a sequence of @xmath19-knots @xmath118 with local causal relations between the nodes of successive spin networks in the sequence corresponding to the action of the hamiltonian constraint .",
    "we can represent this sequence by a branched , colored two - surface @xmath119 as follows :    1 .",
    "construct the finite two surface generated by taking the topological product of the graph for the initial spin network with an interval .",
    "2 .   represent the first action of the hamiltonian constraint by a branching of the world - line of the node where the action took place .",
    "3 .   patch this onto a two surface generated by a finite piece of the `` world - sheet '' of the graph of the next spin network .",
    "4 .   repeat the above steps for all the remaining @xmath19-knots in the sequence .",
    "there is a natural local causal structure built into this surface because of the partial order in the various actions of the hamiltonian constraint .",
    "the two - surface can be sliced by `` equal - time slices '' which are simply the spin networks of the sequence .",
    "the faces in the two - surface carry su(2 ) spin labels and the lines carry intertwiners .",
    "the vertices or branching points of the two surface correspond to the action of the hco .",
    "thus , the dynamics can be thought of as being localized at the vertices .",
    "these can be thought of as being analogous to vertices in feynman diagrams .",
    "we refer to each of these two - surfaces as a _ causal spin foam_.    each causal spin foam can be assigned the amplitude @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the numerical coefficient for the action of the hco which takes @xmath122 to @xmath123 and @xmath124 is the number of operator actions in the causal future of the vertex @xmath125 .",
    "the transition amplitude ( [ trans - amp ] ) can be then written as a sum over causal spin foams as follows : @xmath126 thus , the final form of the sum over histories can be expressed as a sum over branched , colored two - surfaces .",
    "besides the topological information , these two - surfaces have one additional property , namely , the causal relations between their vertices . based on the formal expression ( [ formal - prop ] )",
    ", we can identify these two - surfaces as being quantum , lorentzian four - geometries . in the next section",
    ", we give a general definition for causal spin foams , and discuss some of their properties .",
    "we can generalize the results of the previous section in a natural way . instead of considering two - surfaces which are generated by the action of the hamiltonian constraint , we consider more general branched , colored two - surfaces and prescribe amplitudes for all possible branchings in them .",
    "this can be thought of as an inverse prescription of the quantum hamiltonian constraint .",
    "for example , we can modify the ultra - local nature of the hco by allowing more general causal structures in the branched surfaces .",
    "the requirement that the theory have the right classical limit , viz .",
    "classical general relativity , will then choose the correct set of amplitudes .",
    "we shall now try to define the basic structure which enables us to start addressing some of these problems .",
    "many of the ideas in this section are closely based on @xcite .    from now on",
    ", we shall consider only piecewise - linear ( pl ) two - surfaces .",
    "the advantage of doing so is that we can formulate the entire theory in a purely combinatorial fashion without reference to a background manifold .",
    "we begin by giving an intuitive discussion of what properties that these surfaces should satisfy .",
    "firstly , they should relate to spin networks in a natural way .",
    "this means that they interpolate between an initial spin network to a final one .",
    "also , the notion of causality which arose in the previous section should be incorporated in these two - surfaces .",
    "this causality should also give us a prescription for `` slicing '' a two - surface and getting a spin network .",
    "we now make these notions more precise .",
    "consider a oriented two - dimensional cellular complex @xmath127 .",
    "it consists of a collection of point ( 0-cells ) , edges ( 1-cells ) and faces ( 2-cells ) .",
    "let @xmath128 denote the set of vertices of the complex , @xmath129 the set of edges and @xmath130 the set of faces . since , we have an oriented complex , for every edge @xmath131 , there exist maps @xmath19 and @xmath132 that map @xmath12 to its source and target in @xmath128 .",
    "next , we need to include causality .",
    "this is done by imposing be a partial order @xmath107 among the elements of @xmath128 .",
    "that is , for all @xmath133 : @xmath134 these properties state that the order on the set is transitive and reflexive .",
    "such sets are referred to as causal sets in the physics literature @xcite .",
    "further , since each term we consider has a finite number of vertices , the vertex set satisfies the local finiteness requirements that are usually imposed on causal sets . in particular , the partial order @xmath107 gives us relations between any two vertices which are joined by an edge .",
    "we shall call an edge `` causal '' if we have the condition @xmath135 otherwise we shall call it `` acausal '' or``space - like '' .",
    "we adopt the convention that the orientation of a causal edge is always future - directed , that is , @xmath136 .    only faces which have at least one causal edge are non - empty ( i.e. , belong to the foam ) .",
    "this corresponds to the intuitive notion that the `` world - sheet '' of the edges of the spin networks should be causal surfaces .",
    "also , every space - like edge can belong to at most two faces of @xmath127 .",
    "this is because the dynamics defined by the action of the hco is localized at vertices .",
    "we would like to retain this feature .",
    "further , we assign to every face @xmath137 in @xmath127 which has at least one causal edge , a representation @xmath138 of su(2 ) and to every edge which belongs to at least two faces we shall assign an intertwiner @xmath139 which defines the map @xmath140 a face is considered to be incoming if the orientation it induces on the edge agrees with the intrinsic orientation of the edge and considered outgoing otherwise .",
    "this in particular means that the faces which meet at space - like edges have the same spin and the intertwiner associated with such an edge is identity .",
    "the causal spin foam @xmath141 is then defined as the object @xmath142 .",
    "we started by requiring that a causal spin foam give us an history between some initial and some final spin network .",
    "this translates into a requirement on the boundary of @xmath141 .",
    "the boundary of @xmath127 consists of all edges @xmath143 which lie in only one face and the vertices that form the endpoints of these .",
    "since the foam is supposed to be the interpolation between two spatial spin networks , we need to specify further properties of the boundary @xmath144 of @xmath127 such that this is satisfied .",
    "it is sufficient to require that the set of vertices @xmath145 which belong to the boundary of @xmath127 consists of two disjoint sets @xmath146 and @xmath147 such that for any @xmath148 there is some @xmath149 such that @xmath150 and that there are no causal relations between any two elements of each of the sets @xmath146 and @xmath147 .",
    "@xmath146 is then the set of vertices of the graph @xmath151 on which the initial spin network is based .",
    "the edges @xmath143 are labeled by the same representation of the group as the face they border , while the vertices in @xmath152 are labeled by the intertwiners which labeled the edges which end on them .",
    "hence , a causal spin foam @xmath141 can be regarded as a mapping from an initial spin network to a final one .",
    "intermediate spin networks should correspond to spatial slices of the foam .",
    "any acausal , connected , closed subset of the 1-skeleton of @xmath127 ( i.e. the set of all 0-cells and 1-cells which belong to @xmath127 ) can be chosen as a graph on which a spin network is based .",
    "since all space - like edges have at most two faces incident on them , we assign the representation @xmath153 associated with either of those faces to the edge .",
    "generically , we can also assign the intertwiner of the causal edge passing through every vertex to the vertex itself .",
    "thus , in general , this will give us a spin network .",
    "we can not slice through vertices where more than two causal edges meet as there is no unambiguous definition of the intertwiner for these vertices .",
    "slicing to the past and future of these vertices gives us different spin networks .",
    "thus these are the `` feynman vertices '' of the theory where the dynamics is effectively localized .",
    "this completes our characterization of a causal spin foam . to summarize the key points",
    ", we give a definition :    a causal spin foam @xmath154 is a map from a spin network @xmath155 to a spin network @xmath156 such that    1 .",
    "@xmath127 is an oriented two - dimensional cellular complex ; 2 .",
    "@xmath107 is a partial order on the vertex set @xmath128 ; 3 .",
    "an edge of @xmath127 is called causal if its endpoints are related by @xmath107 , otherwise it called acausal ; 4 .",
    "every face @xmath157 has at least one causal edge ; 5 .",
    "every face of @xmath127 is labeled by a representation @xmath138 of su(2 ) ; 6 .",
    "every edge of @xmath127 is labeled by an intertwining tensor @xmath158 such that @xmath159 7 .",
    "the boundary of @xmath127 , @xmath160 and for every vertex @xmath161 such that @xmath162 and @xmath163 are acausal sets ; 8 .   the spins @xmath164 and intertwiners @xmath165 of @xmath123 agree with those on the faces and edges of @xmath166 which intersect the boundary .",
    "dynamics can be considered as the assignment of amplitudes @xmath167 to each foam . in particular , this amplitude can be written as @xmath168 where the amplitude assigned to each vertex is a local quantity , that is , it depends only upon the spins and intertwiners in the neighborhood of the vertex . based on the result for the previous section",
    ", this amplitude should also contain a factor which depends upon the causal structure of the vertex .",
    "a specification of the amplitude @xmath169 for all possible vertices in the theory can be regarded as being equivalent to giving the definition of the hco .    in the next section ,",
    "we give an example of a specific causal spin foam model which does not arise from any hamiltonian constraint .",
    "the causal evolution model @xcite can be viewed as causal spin foam model .",
    "we shall start by giving a brief review of our understanding of the essential features of this model .",
    "start with a ( abstract ) three - dimensional simplicial complex @xmath170 in which every face is labeled by a spin @xmath153 ( representation of su(2 ) ) and every tetrahedron is labeled by an intertwiner which defines the map from @xmath171 to the trivial representation .",
    "this is supposed to correspond to a spatial slice .",
    "the dual one - skeleton of the complex @xmath170 is a four - valent spin network ( the model restricts to spin networks based on four - valent graphs ) . now",
    "the amplitude between an initial state ( @xmath172 and a final state ( @xmath173 ) can be written as @xmath174 where we consider all the four - dimensional simplicial complexes @xmath175 which have as their boundaries @xmath176 .",
    "each four - simplex in @xmath175 consists of 5 tetrahedra and 10 faces .",
    "the causal evolution model further specifies that the 4-simplex has a particular causal structure , that is , @xmath86 of the tetrahedra lie in the past of the remaining @xmath177 .",
    "thus , the amplitude @xmath178 which corresponds to every 4-simplex is a function in the space @xmath179 which reflects this causal structure .",
    "the contact with spin networks was made in the case of the three - simplex by looking at the dual one - skeleton of @xmath170 .",
    "we may expect that the causal spin foam may be recovered by considering the dual two - skeleton of the four - complex .",
    "let us consider one four - simplex in the interior of a particular @xmath175 .",
    "the dual two - skeleton can be constructed by assigning a 0-cell to the 4-simplex itself , a 1-cell to every tetrahedron in the 4-simplex and a 2-cell to every face of the 4-simplex . by assigning the labels of every element in the simplex to its dual element",
    ", we can generate a 2-dimensional cellular complex whose faces are labeled by spins and whose edges are labeled by intertwiners .",
    "the only things that remains to be checked is that every face in the dual two - skeleton has a time like edge in its boundary . to verify this",
    ", we observe that the edges in the dual 1-skeleton correspond to joining the centers of neighboring 4-simplices . since , these 4-simplices have causal relations between them , the dual edges are obviously causal .",
    "( in the language of causal evolution , there is an order in which we placed the 4-simplices to generate @xmath175 and this is identified as a causal order ) .",
    "there is certain amount of subtlety associated with taking the duals of the three - complexes that form the boundary .",
    "the way to define this is to first construct the dual one - skeleton of the boundary 3-complex by associating an edge to every face in it .",
    "next , construct the duals for these faces in the four - dimensional sense , considering only the parts of these surfaces which are inside the four - complex .",
    "these will then be bounded by the one - skeleton of the boundary .",
    "thus , the boundary of the dual two - skeleton is in fact the union of the graphs on which the initial and final spin networks are based .",
    "thus , the causal evolution model satisfies all the conditions in definition 1 .",
    "in fact , the causal evolution model can be viewed as a causal spin foam model in which only two - surfaces which are dual 2-skeletons of a 4-complex and the causal structures which are local to each 4-simplex are included in the sum over histories .",
    "it is worth noting that the causal evolution model also gives a method for constructing ( a limited class of ) causal spin foams .",
    "in this paper , we have shown two main results .",
    "we have constructed the causal propagator in canonical quantum gravity as a formal power series .",
    "this was made possible by the use of spin network states and the existence of a diffeomorphism invariant measure for the lapse function .",
    "we found that it was necessary to modify the original proposal in @xcite to include the discrete causality that was introduced by multiple actions of the hco .",
    "in fact , we used the non - commutativity of the hco to define a causal structure .",
    "this was our first key result .",
    "the other key result is that the power series for the propagator can be represented as a sum over colored , branched two - surfaces which we call causal spin foams .",
    "we gave a general definition for a causal spin foam and showed that the causal evolution model @xcite can be regarded as a causal spin foam model .",
    "we shall conclude this paper with a discussion of some of the open issues that remain to be understood .",
    "these are listed below in no particular order .    *",
    "the propagator which we have considered is motivated by studying the feynman propagator for the point particle . however , the role that it plays in quantum gravity is not completely understood .",
    "in particular , its relation to the projector onto physical states needs to be clarified .",
    "* we have presented a particular concrete proposal to incorporate the causal structure which results from the multiple actions of the hco .",
    "the four - diffeomorphism invariance of this proposal deserves to be better understood .",
    "in particular , we have suggested , that the non - commutativity of the hco defines the causal structure of the quantum space - time .",
    "this should be studied in greater detail by coupling the gravity to matter fields and verifying that our definition of causality is consistent with that in usual quantum field theory .",
    "+ also , we have concentrated on the range on integration for the lapse .",
    "the dependence on the measure chosen for the lapse is unclear .",
    "we should emphasize though , that the discrete causal structure will determine the range of integration for the lapse , once the measure is chosen . *",
    "the limit @xmath116 needs further study .",
    "there are two different avenues which can be explored in this regard .",
    "as we suggested , it may be possible to regulate this in a fashion analogous to the case of the feynman propagator for the relativistic point particle .",
    "another proposal is that this limit should only be taken in physically relevant quantities where it may make sense @xcite . * the details of the calculation in section 3",
    "depend on a particular regularization of the hco .",
    "however , given any other regularizations of the operator , we can repeat the calculation for them .",
    "however , we would like to point out that we gave an example of a model which can be viewed as an inverse definition of the constraint operator . the causal spin foam models and the hamiltonian constraint should be viewed as two sides of the same problem  a better understanding of one will help in the study of the other . *",
    "the appearance of causal spin foams in the path integral for lorentzian quantum gravity indicates that they may be thought of as quantum lorentzian space - times .",
    "this aspect needs to studied in greater detail .",
    "in particular , the relation of this work to @xcite , where the authors try to construct a spin foam model for lorentzian gravity based on the representation theory of the lorentz group , requires further investigation .",
    "it is interesting to note that in three dimensions , a path integral model based on the group so(2,1 ) can be constructed in which each term has a consistent causal structure @xcite . *",
    "a related issue , which arises in a natural fashion , is the choice of causal spin foams that should be included in the sum over histories",
    ". it may be that it is sufficient to limit the sum to a subset of all causal spin foams ( for example , the ones which arise in the causal evolution model ) .",
    "it may even turn out that this question is irrelevant in the classical limit  i.e. , there may be more than one class of models for which classical gr is recovered .",
    "further work is needed before this question can be answered in a definite way .",
    "this work adds to the understanding of the role that causality plays in the dynamics of quantum gravity .",
    "however , many issues are still unclear and further work needs to be done before answers to physical questions can be extracted .",
