    "sgrs and axps share many characteristics such as long spin periods ( 2 - 12 s ) and large spin - down rates that imply very high surface dipole magnetic fields of @xmath7  g. they are all persistent x - ray emitters with luminosities significantly larger than those expected from rotational energy losses ; instead the magnetar x - ray emission is attributed to the decay of their powerful magnetic fields and sub - surface heating @xcite .",
    "magnetars enter active episodes during which they emit short ( 0.1s ) bursts of hard x-/soft @xmath8rays with luminosities ranging from @xmath9 to 10@xmath10  erg  s@xmath1 ; very rarely , they emit giant flares ( gfs ) that last several minutes with luminosities @xmath11  erg  s@xmath1 .",

    "response matrices were generated using the task _ rmfgen_. these responses were spatially averaged using a psf model for point - like sources and a flat uniform flux distribution for extended sources .",
    "background events for point - like sources were extracted from a source - free region with the same size as the source on the same ccd .",
    "we followed the same procedure for the background extraction of extended sources since they only cover a small region in the sky with a size of 2 - 3  ( see section  [ spa - ana ] ) .    for point - like sources the background spectrum",
    "was directly subtracted from the source spectrum .",
    "such a method corrects for both the instrumental and the cosmic x - ray background simultaneously .",
    "since our extended sources are not very large ( see section  [ spa - ana ] ) one can expect that same method would work reasonably well for their spectra .",
    "however , to ensure that the background contribution is accurately accounted for , we also tried a more rigorous background - estimate procedure , where we first modeled the background spectrum and then included the background contribution as an additional model component while fitting the source spectrum .",
    "we used the extended science analysis software ( esas ) package for the purpose of background modeling .",
    "first , the instrumental background is extracted from the ccds where our extended emission lies , using the filter - wheel closed data , i.e. , derived from observations where the filter wheel is in the closed position .",

    "the absorption in the power - law was frozen to the galactic value towards , @xmath34",
    "@xmath28 , and the photon index of the power - law was frozen to 1.5 assuming unresolved agn contribution ( e.g. , distant quasars and/or nearby low luminosity agn , @xcite ) .",

    "the best fit parameters to our extended sources spectra using the two background - estimation methods , i.e. , directly or through modeling , were in very good agreement within the error bars at the 1 sigma level ( table  1 ) . hence , in the following the background for extended sources was estimated directly , as usually done for point - like sources .",

    "the rms values of the psf fit to our radial profiles are 0.10 and 0.35 for obs .  1 and obs .  2 , respectively , indicating that a psf alone is not sufficient to explain the observed source radial profiles , and that an excess emission is present . indeed ,",
    "extended emission is clearly visible in both observations , starting at around 15  and 25  for obs .  1 and obs .  2 , respectively . the extent of this emission is larger and more obvious in obs .  2 , stretching out to @xmath40150 . the emission in obs .  1",

    ", by collapsing the counts in the x ( east - west ) and y ( south - north ) directions , in a rectangular region of @xmath42 pixels around the sgr , excluding any point sources in the field .",
    "since our source lies very close to the pn ccd gap , we used an exposure - map corrected image for this analysis to correct for these ccd gaps , which also corrects for bad pixels . the background level , shown as a black solid line in figure  [ extent ] , is the mean value of the total counts in two regions taken at rectangular areas away from the source in both directions .",

    "we can only conjecture that the twisted magnetic field model by @xcite could lead to reconnection , facilitating the production of the required electron population distribution .",
    "we can estimate the termination shock radius @xmath119 depending on our assumptions about the energy flux provided by the magnetar . in quiescence , the balance of pressures @xmath120 , where @xmath121 is the solid angle in which the wind ( including the poynting flux ) is blowing ( @xmath122 for an isotropic wind ) , and @xmath123 is the ambient pressure ( this equation assumes that the magnetar s speed is essentially subsonic ) . for the @xmath124 erg s@xmath1 ,",

    "the size of an x - ray pwn is typically a factor of a few times larger than @xmath119 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which is still much smaller than the observed size of @xmath130 . therefore , not only the unrealistically high `` efficiency '' @xmath131 , but also the large size support the hypothesis that the observed asymmetrical nebula ( region b ) could not be produced by the magnetar in quiescence via rotation - powered wind .",
    "when a magnetar is in an active state , the pressure of its wind ( ejected particles and magnetic fields ) is much higher than that in quiescence . in this state",
    ", the energy loss rate , @xmath132 , can be much higher than @xmath100 .",

    "using @xmath136 instead of @xmath100 , we obtain @xmath137 cm , which corresponds to the angular shock radius of @xmath325  @xmath138 , and a factor of a few larger size of the x - ray nebula , comparable with the observed nebula radius of @xmath130 .",
    "this allows one to assume that the detected nebula was created in a burst ( or a series of bursts ) , which is in line with our first assumption in section 4.1 , that likely the magnetar experienced a bursting episode before obs .",
    "1 , which was not directly detected .",
    "we can in principle connect the nebula size ( and even the softness of the spectrum ) with synchrotron cooling .",
    "first of all , it is worth noting that the magnetic field at the shock ( if there is a shock ) does _ not _ depend on the neutron star surface magnetic field ",
    "it is determined by the balance of the wind pressure and the ambient pressure and depends on the latter and the magnetization parameter @xmath44 ( i.e. , the ratio of the electromagnetic energy flux to the kinetic energy flux ) : @xmath139^{1/2 } \\sim 50 [ p_{-10}\\sigma/(1+\\sigma)]^{1/2}$ ] @xmath140 g , upstream of the shock , and it can be a factor of 3 higher immediately downstream of the shock @xcite .",
    "this , in particular , means that the softness of the nebula spectrum is not due to a higher magnetic field in the nebula .",
    "the magnetization parameter @xmath44 is , unfortunately , quite uncertain for the putative magnetar winds .",
    "it is believed to be @xmath141 for pwne ( e.g. , @xmath142 for the crab ) , but it may be higher in magnetars . therefore , the actual value of the magnetic field in the shocked magnetar flow remains uncertain ; it might be as low as a few @xmath140 g ( for small @xmath44 and low - pressure ambient medium ) or as high as a few mg ( for large @xmath44 and high - pressure medium ) .",
    "therefore , we will simply scale the field as @xmath143 g.    the synchrotron cooling time for an electron with lorentz factor @xmath144 can be estimated as @xmath145 s , where for synchrotron emission in the x - ray band we used @xmath146 ) .",
    "the shocked wind flows from the magnetar with mildly relativistic velocities ( e.g. , @xmath147 for an isotropic outflow  see @xcite ) . multiplying @xmath148 by the flow velocity , we obtain a distance from the magnetar where the x - ray synchrotron radiation still can be observed : @xmath149 cm , which corresponds to an angular distance of @xmath150 , quite close to the observed size for @xmath151 @xmath140 g .",
    "thus , the observed size can be explained by the synchrotron cooling of the outflowing electrons in a reasonable magnetic field .",
    "the cooling time also determines the lifetime of the putative mwn after the end of the magnetar activity period .",
    "for instance , for @xmath151 @xmath140 g , @xmath152 years , which means that the mwn can be observable in x - rays around quiescent ( even undetectable ) magnetars if these were in an active state years ago ; it would also explain the detection of the mwn in obs .  1 .",
    "finally , we would like to discuss some other possibilities for the origin of the extended x - ray emission around .",
    "the source lies in the center of a crowded field filled with many other high energy sources .",
    "it lies almost at the center of the extended tev source hess  j1834@xmath15087 @xcite , and within the snr w41 ( k+12 ) and a dense gmc @xcite .",
    "the high absorbing column density toward  is most likely related to the gmc , which in turn is causing the scattering halo emission .",
    "an anisotropic dust distribution within the gmc could cause an asymmetrical halo emission , leading to region a and region b emanating from the same region and having the same physical origin . to test this hypothesis we extracted the spectrum of region  a+region  b during obs .  2 and fit it with an absorbed power - law .",
    "we find a hydrogen column density @xmath153  @xmath28 , consistent with the point source absorbing column , and a power - law photon index @xmath154 , harder than the point source spectrum , indicating that a halo interpretation for region  a+region  b is unlikely .",
    "hence , the nature of these two regions is indeed different as indicated by their different spectral properties ( section  [ sec : spec ] ) .",
    "moreover , the detection of region  b during obs .  1 , when the source was in quiescence , poses a challenge to such an interpretation . another possibility for the region b",
    "emission could be some contribution from the snr w41 , in the form of either thermal emission from shocked gas or non - thermal synchrotron emission ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) .",
    "however , the fluxes of both region  a and region  b varied with the source flux , implying a tight connection between the two and the sgr .",
    "deeper high - resolution multiwavelength observations would be of great value to better understand the physical properties and emission processes of the  putative mwn , and would help shed light on the connections between the many point - like and extended sources existing in this crowded field .",
