    "the change in the superconducting transition temperature @xmath6 in yttrium from @xmath10 mk at ambient pressure @xcite to around @xmath11 k at @xmath12 gpa @xcite , concurrent with the change in its crystal structure @xcite , underscores the intricate relationship between pressure - induced @xmath1 charge transfer , dynamical response of the lattice and its coupling to fermi electrons .",
    "the experiment on yttrium follows the recent observation of superconductivity in compressed lithium at a @xmath6 of @xmath11 k @xcite , bringing into focus the pressure - induced changes in the electron - phonon interactions in elemental metals , especially the alkali and the early - transition metals @xcite .",
    "experimentally , yttrium follows the equilibrium structure sequence hcp@xmath13sm - type@xmath13dhcp@xmath13trigonal as the pressure is increased from ambient to @xmath14 gpa at room temperature @xcite .",
    "it is expected that yttrium will stabilize in a body - centered cubic structure at pressures above @xmath15 gpa @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the superconducting transition temperature @xmath6 changes from @xmath10 mk at ambient pressure @xcite to around @xmath16 k at @xmath17 gpa @xcite , and then to @xmath18 k at @xmath19 gpa @xcite . a further increase in pressure to @xmath12 gpa results in a @xmath20 k. surprisingly , it seems possible that for pressures greater than @xmath12 gpa , yttrium could superconduct with a @xmath6 higher than that of @xmath11 k.    in an effort to understand the pressure - induced changes in the superconducting properties of yttrium _ vis - a - vis _ the changes in its stable crystal structure , we have studied , using density - functional based methods , ( i ) the electronic structure , ( ii ) the phonon density of states , ( iii ) the electron - phonon interaction , and ( iv ) the solutions of the isotropic eliashberg gap equation for hcp and dhcp yttrium at ambient pressure and at around @xmath14 gpa .",
    "we have calculated the electronic structure of hcp and dhcp yttrium using full - potential , linear muffin - tin orbital ( lmto ) method @xcite as well as the plane - wave pseudopotential method using quantum - espresso package @xcite .",
    "using the linear response code based on the lmto method , we have calculated the phonon dos , @xmath21 , and the eliashberg function , @xmath22 , for hcp and dhcp yttrium .",
    "subsequently , we have numerically solved the isotropic eliashberg gap equation @xcite for a range of @xmath23 to obtain the corresponding superconducting transition temperature @xmath24 after the completion of the present work , we have come across the work of yin _",
    "et al_. @xcite , which uses the _",
    "hypothetical _ fcc structure to describe the effects of pressure in yttrium .    based on our calculations , described below",
    ", we find that as one goes from hcp yttrium to dhcp yttrium , there is ( i ) a substantial charge - transfer from @xmath1 with extensive modifications of the _ d_-band , ( ii ) a stiffening of phonon modes with the electron - phonon coupling over the entire frequency range , ( iii ) an increase in electron - phonon coupling constant @xmath3 from @xmath4 to @xmath5 , leading to a change in the superconducting transition temperature @xmath6 from @xmath7 k to @xmath8 k for @xmath25 consistent with experiment .",
    "the density - functional theory provides a reliable framework for implementing from first - principles the migdal - eliashberg approach for calculating the superconducting properties of metals .",
    "such an approach has been implemented using the full - potential lmto method @xcite .    in general ,",
    "the phonon density of states is given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the @xmath28-th phonon mode associated with the atomic displacements .",
    "using the electron - phonon matrix elements @xmath29 , which can be interpreted as the scattering of electron in state @xmath30 to state @xmath31 due to perturbation arising out of the phonon mode @xmath27 , we can calculate the phonon line width @xmath32    @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the electronic density of states at the fermi energy .",
    "now , we can combine the electronic density of states , phonon spectrum and the electron - phonon matrix elements to obtain the eliashberg function @xmath22 defined as    @xmath35 finally , the eliashberg functions can be used to solve the isotropic gap equation @xcite@xmath36 to obtain the superconducting properties such as the superconducting transition temperature @xmath24 the function @xmath37 used in the gap equation is defined by @xmath38 and @xmath39 with @xmath40 representing the sign of @xmath41 the electron - phonon coupling @xmath42 is given by @xmath43    before describing our results , we provide some of the computational details of the present calculations .",
    "the self - consistent electronic structures of hcp and dhcp yttrium in @xmath44 crystal structure , having two and four yttrium atoms in the respective primitive cells , were calculated using the pwscf code of the quantum - espresso package and the full - potential , lmto method .",
