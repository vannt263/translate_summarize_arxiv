    "graphene nanoribbons are strips of graphene several nanometers wide and of arbitrary length .",
    "their unique electronic structure and transport properties that arise from the linear , massless dirac - like spectrum of the underlying honeycomb lattice of graphene are attracting a great deal of interest at the present time.@xcite in experimental studies of graphene nanoribbons the electronic charge density in the ribbon is usually varied by the application of a variable voltage to a gate electrode located near the ribbon.@xcite if , due to the application of the gate voltage , there is a net charge on the ribbon , the electronic charge density in the ribbon ceases to be uniform , and there is a strong redistribution of the charge towards the edges of the ribbon . this charge redistribution and its effects on the electronic structure and transport",
    "have been examined theoretically by several authors for ribbons of uniform width separated from the gate electrode by a dielectric film.@xcite it has been predicted that the charge redistribution results in a @xmath1 charge singularity@xcite at the edge of the ribbon ( here @xmath2 is the coordinate normal to the ribbon boundary ) and modification of the electron dispersion relation.@xcite electron transport in graphene nanoribbons with constrictions ( gncs ) is also attracting theoretical@xcite and experimental@xcite attention at the present time .",
    "however , the effects of charge redistribution in gncs have not as yet been discussed in the literature . in this paper",
    "we explore this topic theoretically .    the present theory accounts for the effects of the coulomb repulsion that gives rise to the charge redistribution within the self - consistent hartree approximation that has been used previously to study charge redistribution in uniform ribbons.@xcite we consider infinite ribbons with armchair edges and v - shaped or cosine shaped constrictions and treat the effects of electron - electron interactions at the hartree level throughout these entire structures .",
    "the ribbons that we consider are suspended above a dielectric layer which covers a gate electrode as in a recent experiment.@xcite we treat the effects of the dielectric and gate within an image charge model .",
    "we describe the charged nanoribbon by fixing the chemical potential , and obtaining a self - consistent solution where all electronic states with lower energies than the fermi energy are filled . from this calculation",
    "we obtain the hartree electronic energy bands and charge densities , and compute the conductance .",
    "our model considers only @xmath3-orbitals of the graphene within the tight - binding approximation .",
    "the structures studied below include more than 10000 carbon atoms inside the computational area .",
    "we find that strong charge accumulation along the constriction boundary occurs or does not occur depending on the type of constriction that is considered . as more electron subbands become populated the lowest subbands gradually localize near the graphene boundary .",
    "we find that , in the hartree model , electrons in the first subband of the ribbon are transmitted almost perfectly through the constriction with little intersubband scattering , except at the small fermi energies where they can be resonantly reflected by a constiction having zizgag edges . by contrast , in the non - interacting electron model strong intersubband scattering occurs at the constriction .",
    "depending on the type of constriction conductance quantization is predicted to be more or less pronounced in the hartree approximation than in the non - interacting approximation , a finding that may be relevant to recent experimental observations .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : our model and method of solution are described in section [ model ] .",
    "our numerical results are presented in section [ results ] .",
    "we summarize our main conclusions in section [ summary ] .",
    "we consider a graphene nanoribbon ( gn ) suspended in a way similar to that in the experimental setup of tombros etal.@xcite the gn is separated from the back gate by layers of a dielectric and air , see fig .",
    "for the dielectric material we choose sio@xmath4 with relative permittivity @xmath5 .",
    "the nr is attached at its two ends to semiinfinite leads represented by ideal ribbons having the same width @xmath6 as the nr .",
    "four different types of devices are considered in the following : an ideal uniform ribbon , and ribbons having v - shaped armchair and zigzag and constrictions or constrictions with cosine profiles imposed on one side .",
    "we disregard any defects other than the atomic steps at the boundary of the cosine - shaped constriction in the present study .",
    "the host configuration is taken as armchair as are the edge configurations of the semiinfinite leads .",
    "as representative devices we consider gns of width @xmath7 nm and length @xmath8 nm , fig .",
    "there are 92 carbon atoms in the cross - section making the ribbon semiconducting .",
    "the constrictions , if imposed , are v - shaped or cosine - shaped trenches 5 nm deep inside the ribbon thus leaving half of the width @xmath6 of the ribbon in the narrowest part of the constriction for electron propagation .",
    "the length @xmath9 is taken long enough to include part of the leads near the constriction and therefore to treat the leads accurately . because for the v - shaped constrictions we consider atomically ideal boundaries , the apex angles of these constrictions are 60 and 120 degrees for armchair and zigzag cases , respectively .",
    "the sio@xmath4 and air layers are both 50 nm thick .",
    "thus the back gate is 100 nm from the nanoribbon .",
    "we performed simulations for different ribbon widths for these constriction geometries and all of the results showed similar features .    the system shown in fig .",
    "1 is described by the hamiltonian @xmath10 where @xmath11 ev is the matrix element between nearest - neighbor atoms ; @xmath12 is the hartree potential at atom @xmath13 which results from the coulomb interaction with the uncompensated charge density @xmath14 in the system ( including the image charges ) . in coordinate space",
    "the hartree potential can be written as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the @xmath17 electron or image charge placed at distance @xmath18 from the graphene layer .",
    "the image charges included in the model keep the back - gate electrode at zero potential.@xcite the potential due to a charge density @xmath19 located a distance @xmath20 above a dielectric ( with dielectric constant @xmath21 and thickness @xmath22 ) that is over a metal gate , as shown in fig .",

    "the first row ( @xmath24 ) describes the direct coulomb interaction between electrons in the graphene layer . because the contributions from the image charges decrease",

    "the semi - infinite leads themselves begin far enough from the constriction to ensure that the total self - consistent potential and the electron density do not change appreciably along the leads , i.e. , the electron density and the potential in the leads are not affected by the internal region .",
    "thus the leads can be considered as uniform graphene ribbons .",
    "starting from the hamiltonian eq . , we evaluate the green s function numerically using the technique described by xu et al.@xcite . the green s function in the real - space representation , @xmath29 ,",

    "[ density ] has been used previously in ref . .",
    "in general at non - zero temperatures the lower limit of integration in eq . [ density ] is @xmath39 .",
    "however , in the present work the ldos is zero in a range of energies of width much larger than @xmath40 below the charge neutrality point @xmath41 and therefore eq . [ density ] is a good approximation .",
    "the position of the charge neutrality point @xmath41 at a given fermi energy is determined numerically from solution of the schrodinger equation @xmath42 with @xmath43 being the hamiltonian and the wave function @xmath44 obeying the bloch theorem @xmath45 where @xmath25 is the bloch wave vector and @xmath46 is the bloch wave function at coordinate @xmath47 ; @xmath48 is unit cell length of the armchair ribbon.@xcite having calculated the bloch states and constructed the band diagram one can readily obtain the number of the bloch states @xmath49 for a given fermi energy that in turn serves as a basis for analysis of transport properties of gncs.@xcite because the projections of the two dirac points in the armchair ribbon coincide at @xmath24 we solve at zero wave vector and find @xmath41 from eigenvalues @xmath50 .",
    "the integration path in goes along the real axis and a fine integration grid is used to capture the locations of the subband edges and quasibound states if any are present .    since the hartree potential @xmath51 given by eq .",
    "depends on the electron density @xmath34 which is a solution of the schrdinger equation with the hamiltonian , these equations need to be solved iteratively .",
    "the iteration process is executed until the convergence criterion @xmath52 is met , where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the input and output average values of the electron density at the @xmath47-th iteration . in the cases where a constriction is present in the gn the above computation proceeds in two stages . at the first stage , self - consistency",

    "we define @xmath61 as the chemical potential difference between the metallic gate and the ribbon , necessary to accommodate extra carriers in the graphene and remove them from the metallic gate .",

    "the conductance values for the two models for the same values of the fermi energy are very close to each other . in both cases",
    "the conductance increases by the quantum @xmath0 each time a new subband opens for propagation .",

    "[ fig:2](b ) ; @xmath41 increases monotonically with increasing fermi energy because the electron density on the ribbon increases .",
    "the slope change is caused by the additional contribution to the electrostatic potential on the ribbon due to the charges populating a new subband . assuming a parabolic dispersion near the subband edge yields an @xmath65 divergence of the dos that leads to an additional electron density @xmath66 where e is measured from the subband edge .",

    "however , the results of the hartree calculation show only first two conductance plateaus to be well defined . the transition between these plateaus appears sharper than that predicted by the non - interacting calculation . in order to understand the reason for the better quantization for the first few conductance steps in the hartree approach let s inspect the electron concentration distributions and transmission coefficients for @xmath69 shown in fig .",

    "[ fig:4](a ) .",
    "note that @xmath73 for all of the conductance steps in the hartree theory .",

    "@xmath70 for the non - interacting approach shows a fairly uniform distribution over all states , see inset in fig . [",
    "fig:4](b ) .",
    "to understand this phenomenon , let s consider the square moduli of the wave functions shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] .",
    "the first state in the hartree approach transmits nearly perfectly because of its localization near the straight bottom boundary .",
    "by contrast , the second state is mostly localized near the top boundary , where the constriction is located and transmission is therefore blocked .",
    "note that localization develops gradually as @xmath36 increases and the first and second states propagating along opposite boundaries reveal very similar dispersion for the uniform ribbon for @xmath74 , see fig .",
    "[ fig:2](d ) .",
    "these two states become mostly trapped within triangular wells at the straight ribbon boundaries .",
    "it is also worth noting that this phenomenon holds true for all of the constriction shapes studied below .",
    "it does not occur in the non - interacting electron model because of the absence of change accumulation near the boundaries .",
    "in general , we find electron interactions to favor intra - subband scattering whereas in the non - interacting approximation inter - subband scattering predominates .",
    "the conductance step degradation in the hartree model for @xmath75 in fig .",
    "[ fig:4](c ) is related to the overall poor transmittance of the highest states , where the charge accumulation along the ribbon s edges but not in the constriction itself is further increased .",
    "when this happens the constriction becomes a more effective obstacle to electron propagation through the ribbon in the hartree theory than in the non - interacting electron approximation .     for a gn with",
    "an armchair constriction calculated within the non - interacting and hartree approximations , left and right columns , respectively .",
    "the fermi energy is @xmath69 , see the arrow in fig . [",
    "fig:4](c ) .",
    "the corresponding partial transmission probabilities for the @xmath13th - state are shown in the insets in fig . [ fig:4](a),(b ) . ]     in the hartree approximation .",
    "concentrations equal to or greater than 8@xmath76 m@xmath77 are colored yellow . the dashed rectangle bounds region with the electron concentration plotted on a different scale .",
    "the inset in ( a ) shows the partial transmission probabilities @xmath70 in the hartree model .",
    "( b ) the conductance as a function of the fermi energy for a gn with a zigzag constriction .",
    "the labels and meaning of the shading are the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig:4](c ) . ]",
    "the conductance as a function of @xmath36 and a representative electron concentration distribution @xmath67 for a zigzag constriction are shown in figures [ fig:5](b ) and ( a ) .",
    "the charge density along the zigzag constriction edge is strongly enhanced by values up to an order of magnitude larger than for the armchair constriction ; see the density scales in the inset in fig .",
    "[ fig:5](a ) .",
    "one reason for this is the electron localization at zigzag edges previously predicted in both non - interacting and interacting electron theories ; see , for example , refs . .",
    "this is a topological property of zigzag - terminated ribbons .",
    "another reason is the effect of electron interactions that increases the charge density along the edge further .",
    "the electrons occupy only one graphene sublattice along the zigzag edge while they occupy both sublattices along the armchair edge .",
    "we find the crossover between these charge occupations to occur over a distance of about 10 carbon atoms at the armchair - to - zigzag junction .",
    "the partial transmission for the first subband is @xmath73 similarly to the case of the armchair constriction although it is suppressed at @xmath78 and @xmath79 due to resonant backscattering by strongly localized states at the zigzag edge .",
    "it is worth noting that in modulated ribbons consisting of periodically repeated identical constrictions stop - bands form at these energies .",
    "these stop - bands , where the number of propagating bloch states @xmath49 ( the grey shading in fig . [ fig:5](b ) ) in the periodic structure is zero , are similar to those predicted in edge - corrugated graphene ribbons.@xcite however , here the stop - bands form due to electron interactions .",
    "the mismatch between the electronic structures of the armchair host and zigzag constriction also contributes to less pronounced conductance quantization being seen in fig . [",
    "fig:5](b ) for the zigzag constriction than in fig .",
    "[ fig:4](c ) for the armchair constriction .",
    "but for a gn with a constriction having a cosine profile . ]",
    "figure [ fig:6 ] shows a representative electron concentration distribution @xmath67 and the conductance for a constriction with a cosine profile .",
    "we found strong accumulation of the charge density along the boundary of the constriction itself , similar to that for the zigzag constriction .",
    "note that even though the overall shape of the cosine constriction is smooth there are multiple pieces of the zigzag terminated edges connected to each other by atomic steps along the constriction boundary .",
    "the conductance dip at @xmath80 is correlated to the absence of propagating bloch states at this energy in the corresponding modulated ribbon with periodically repeated constrictions , as is the case for the similar features in fig .",
    "6(b ) for the zigzag constriction . interestingly , although in fig . [ fig:6](b ) only hints of conductance plateaus can be seen in the results for the non - interacting electron model ( red solid curve ) , a very pronounced first conductance plateau is found when electron interactions are included in the hartree model ( dots ) , although only hints of higher plateaus can be discerned in this case as well .",
    "we find the first conductance plateau to remain robust for gncs with the cosine shape of length 7 - 16 nm ( not shown ) .",
    "it may be relevant that in their experimental study of a constriction with an overall smooth profile ( albeit for a much larger structure than those studied here ) tombros _ et al._@xcite observed a very pronounced first integer conductance plateau @xmath81 but only very weak higher plateaus or only hints of higher plateaus .",
    "in such a scenario , a well defined first plateau may be caused by the lowest state being adiabatically transmitted along one of the graphene boundaries in an asymmetric constriction with curvature of one boundary being much smaller than that of the other . because no image of the constriction on which the transport measurements were carried out was presented@xcite ,",
    "the degree of asymmetry is not known .",
    "note also that the experimental device in ref .",
    "was fabricated by current annealing that substantially reduces edge disorder at both boundaries .",
    "in conclusion , we have presented a self - consistent model of electron quantum transport in graphene ribbons and constrictions .",
    "the latter are represented as trenches of depth 5 nm and length range 7 - 17 nm and having different shapes .",
    "the model is based on the green s function formalism and accounts for electron - electron interaction within the hartree approach .",
    "the hartree model predicts several features not found in the non - interacting model .",
    "the electron charge density gradually accumulates along straight boundaries of uniform ribbons as the fermi energy increases .",
    "however , accumulation at the constriction depends strongly on the details of the constriction geometry .",
    "there is little if any charge accumulation along a v - shaped armchair constriction boundary but strong accumulation along a v - shaped zigzag boundary or a boundary with an overall smooth cosine profile . for each of these constriction types imposed on a ribbon with armchair boundaries , except near isolated reflection resonances ,",
    "we find almost perfect transmission of electrons in the first subband ( with little inter - subband scattering ) and almost perfect reflection of electrons in the second subband of the ribbon in the hartree model . by contrast , we find the constriction to induce strong intersubband scattering of electrons for every subband in the non - interacting electron model . for the constriction with the cosine profile ,",
    "the first integer conductance plateau is much more pronounced in the hartree model than in the non - interacting model , a finding that may be relevant to the recent experiment of tombros _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "the transport properties of two lowest subbands are the result of by electron localization near the opposite boundaries of the ribbon .",
    "an analogy can be drawn between perfect transmission along a uniform graphene boundary and the edge state transport in the quantum hall effect , where both are immune to defects in interior of a device .",
