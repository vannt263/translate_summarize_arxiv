    "recently , in ref @xcite a method of multiloop integrals evaluation based on @xmath0 recurrence relations @xcite and @xmath0-analyticity was suggested ( dra method ) . in this contribution",
    "we give a brief review of this method .",
    "we also provide a simple method of derivation of the dimensional recurrence relation well - suited for automatization .",
    "the dra method has been described in detail in ref .",
    "it consists of the following steps :    1 .",
    "make sure all master integrals in subtopologies are known .",
    "if it is not so , start from calculating them .",
    "2 .   pass to a suitable master integral @xmath1 .",
    "it is convenient to choose a master integral which is finite in the basic stripe . for this purpose ,",
    "e.g. , increase powers of some massive propagators .",
    "3 .   construct the dimensional recurrence relation for this master integral .",
    "the general form of this recurrence is @xmath2 where @xmath3 is some rational function and @xmath4 is a non - homogeneous part constructed of the master integrals of subtopologies in @xmath0 dimensions .",
    "4 .   find a general solution of this recurrence relation @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a specific solution of the inhomogeneous equation , @xmath7 is the solution of the homogeneous equation , and @xmath8 is arbitrary periodic function .",
    "fix the singularities of @xmath9 by analysing the analytical properties of the master integrals and summing factor @xmath10 .",
    "if needed , fix the remaining constants from the value of the integral at some space - time dimension @xmath0 .",
    "step 5 is the key point of the dra approach . in order to perform this step",
    "one needs to determine the position and order of the poles of @xmath11 on suitable vertical stripe of width @xmath12 in the complex plane of @xmath0 ( _ basic stripe _ ) .",
    "this information can be extracted from the parametric representation of the integral , either manually or ( semi-)automatically using the ` fiesta ` code @xcite . in general , the number and the order of poles essentially depend on the choice of the master integral @xmath1 , the summing factor @xmath10 , and the basic stripe .",
    "the proper choice may essentially simplify the last step of the approach .    before we proceed to the example of the application of the dra method",
    ", we would like to derive formulas convenient for the automatic derivation of the dimensional recurrence relation .",
    "the original derivation of the dimensional recurrence relation @xcite is based on the parametric representation . for the integral without numerator which can be represented by some graph",
    "the final formula has the form of some sum over the graph trees . for the automatic calculation it may be desirable to have the possibility to obtain the dimensional recurrence relation without any reference to the graph and/or to the parametric representation . in this section",
    "we obtain the corresponding formulas using the baikov s approach which consists of the `` changing of integration variables '' from loop momenta to scalar products ( or denominators ) @xcite .",
    "we briefly review the derivation of the corresponding transformation keeping also @xmath0-dependent factors omitted in the original derivation of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "assume that we are interested in the calculation of the @xmath13-loop integral depending on @xmath14 linearly independent external momenta @xmath15 .",
    "there are @xmath16 scalar products depending on the loop momenta @xmath17 : @xmath18 where @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 .",
    "the loop integral has the form@xmath22 where the scalar functions @xmath23 are linear polynomials with respect to @xmath24 .",
    "the functions @xmath23 are assumed to be linearly independent and to form a complete basis in the sense that any non - zero linear combination of them depends on the loop momenta , and any @xmath25 can be expressed in terms of @xmath23 .    the integral @xmath26 can be considered as a function of @xmath27 integer variables .",
    "it is convenient @xcite to introduce the operators @xmath28 which act on such functions as @xmath29    let us first transform the innermost integral @xmath30 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : j ] ) .",
    "the integrand @xmath31 depends on @xmath32 via the scalar products @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "writing @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the projection of @xmath32 on the hyperplane spanned by @xmath37 , we obtain @xmath38}\\nonumber\\\\ &   \\times\\frac{ds_{12}\\ldots ds_{1k}}{\\pi^{(k-1)/2}\\sqrt{\\mu^{k-1}v(q_{2},\\ldots q_{k})}}\\,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 is a gram determinant constructed on the vectors @xmath40 and @xmath41 for the euclidean / pseudoeuclidean case , respectively .",
    "note that @xmath42 is a @xmath43-degree polynomial of @xmath23 .    repeating the same transformation for @xmath44",

    "the complexity of this reduction strongly depends on the integrals appearing in the right - hand side . the lowering dimensional recurrence relation ( [ eq : lowering ] ) contains integrals with indices shifted by at most @xmath21 in comparison with the integral in the left - hand aside .",

    "the parametric representation of the loop integral was used . for the integral",
    "given by some graph , the result is expressed in terms of the trees of this graph .",
