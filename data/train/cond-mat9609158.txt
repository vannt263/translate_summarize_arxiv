    "the doped rare earth manganites @xmath4mno@xmath2 ( @xmath5 is a rare earth such as la and @xmath6 is a divalent element such as sr or ca ) due to their peculiar correlation between magnetism and conductivity have been extensively studied during 1950s and 60s @xcite .",
    "the most throughly investigated was the la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 system .",
    "undoped ( @xmath7=0 ) , lamno@xmath2 is an antiferromagnetic insulator . upon doping with sr ,",
    "this perovskite oxide becomes a ferromagnetic metal ; the connection between metallicity and ferromagnetism was well explained by the double exchange hopping mechanism @xcite .",
    "the discovery of colossal magnetoresistance phenomena in samples with sr dopant densities in the 0.2@xmath80.4 regime @xcite brought a revival of the interest to these sytems .",
    "the mn@xmath9 ion in the hole - undoped compound lamno@xmath2 has the high - spin @xmath10 electron configuration @xmath11 .",
    "the @xmath12 orbitals hybridize with o2p orbitals much more weakly than the @xmath13 orbitals and can be regarded as forming the localized spin ( @xmath14=3/2 ) .",
    "in contrast to that , @xmath13 orbitals , which have lobes directed to the neighboring oxygen atoms , hybridize strongly with o2p producing in the result rather broad bands .",
    "the strong exchange interaction with @xmath15 subshell leads to the splitting of the @xmath13 band into unoccupied @xmath16 and half - occupied @xmath17 subbands .",
    "the half filled @xmath17 subband is a typical example of the jahn - teller system , and , indeed , lamno@xmath2 has an orthorombic crystal structure @xcite with distorted ( elongated ) mno@xmath18 octahedra .",
    "this cooperative jahn - teller effect is usually considered responsible for the opening of the gap in the half - filled @xmath17 band and an insulator ground state of lamno@xmath2 .",
    "the orthorombic crystal structure of lamno@xmath2 ( @xmath19 space group ) can be described as a perovskite with two types of distortion from a cubic structure : 1)tilting ( rotation ) of the mno@xmath18 octahedra , so that mn - o - mn angles become less than 180@xmath20 , and 2)jahn - teller distortion of the octahedra , with one long mn - o bond and two short bonds . with doping by sr",
    "the orhtorombicity ( the deviation of the values of the lattice parameters @xmath21 and @xmath22 from @xmath23 ) becomes smaller and for @xmath24 the stable crystal structure at room temperature becomes rombohedral , where only tilting of oxygen octahedra is present but all three mn - o bonds are equal . around the same value of the doping @xmath7 , la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 becomes metallic .    for sr doping with 0.2@xmath80.4",
    ", la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 is a ferromagnetic metal at low temperatures .",
    "however , as the temperature increases and approaches the curie temperature @xmath25 a sudden increase of the resistivity is observed @xcite . as the temperature dependence of",
    "the resistivity @xmath26 has typically semiconducting behavior ( @xmath27 ) above t@xmath28 , this increase in resistivity at around @xmath25 is usually desribed as a metal - insulator transition .",
    "the colossal magnetoresistance effect happens when the temperature is close to @xmath25 : the external magnetic field leads to suppression of the resistivity increase or to shifting the metal - insulator transition to higher temperatures resulting in a very large negative value of @xmath29/\\rho(0)$ ] .",
    "the crucial point in the understanding of the effect of the colossal magnetoresistance is the nature of the metal - insulator transition with the temperature variation across @xmath25 .",
    "it was shown @xcite that the double exchange mechanism alone is not enough to explain such transition .",
    "_ @xcite suggested local jahn - teller distortions ( jahn - teller polarons ) as a main mechanism causing localization .",
    "their idea is that a @xmath30 ratio ( @xmath31 is self - trapping jahn - teller polaron energy and @xmath32 is effective band width ) is close to the critical value in la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 and as @xmath32 decreases with destroying the ferromagnetic order above @xmath25 ( the effective hopping takes the maximum value for a parallel spin alignment ) , this ratio becomes larger than the critical value to result in polaron localization .",
    "varma @xcite argues that lamno@xmath2 is not an insulator due to the jahn - teller distortion but is a mott insulator and the jahn - teller distortion occurs parasitically .",
    "he explains localisation of the holes in the paramagnetic phase by spin polaron mechanism .    by replacing la with other trivalent ions with smaller ionic radius ,",
    "the mn - o - mn bond angle becomes smaller and the @xmath13 band width @xmath32 is reduced to enhance the tendency to the carrier localization and lattice distortion .",
    "variety of dramatic phenomena have been observed in ( pr , nd , sm)(sr , ca)mno@xmath2 systems . as one of such examples , we study pr@xmath3ca@xmath3mno@xmath2 in the present paper .",
    "this system has a very peculiar phase diagram @xcite . at low temperature",
    ", it is an antiferromagenetic insulator with a charge ordering of mn@xmath33 and mn@xmath34 accompanied by an orbital ordering : the orbital ordering and spin ordering is of ce - type . between @xmath35 ( @xmath36 k ) and @xmath37 ( @xmath38 k )",
    ", there is no long - range magnetic ordering but the system remains to be insulating because of the persisitence of the charge ordering . above @xmath39 , it is a paramagnetic insulator .    the local spin density approximation ( lsda)@xcite was used by several groups for theoretical investigation of the electronic structure of la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "those calculations have confirmed the importance of the jahn - teller distortion for correct description by the lsda of the insulating antiferromagnetic ground state of the undoped lamno@xmath2 , because the calculations with an undistorted cubic perovskite crystal structure produce a half - filled metallic @xmath17 band . however in order to address the charge and orbital order observed in doped manganites it is necessary to go beyond lsda by including the intra d - shell coulomb interaction ( lsda+u method @xcite ) .",
    "recently such an approach was used for treating the charge ordering in magnetite fe@xmath2o@xmath40 , where lsda gives a metallic uniform solution .",
    "the lsda+u calculation gave a charge ordered insulator as the ground state of this compound @xcite .",
    "in this paper we describe the results of the electronic structure calculation for pr@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 for @xmath41 and 0.5 in the lsda+u approximation .",
    "the problem of the charge ordering can not be treated properly by the standard lsda because of the non - vanishing self - interaction .",
    "in contrast to the hartree - fock approximation , where the self - interaction is explicitly excluded for every orbital , in the lsda it is canceled to a good approximation in the total energy , but rather poorly in the local one - electron potentials , which are orbital - independent . the spurious self - interaction present in the lsda leads to an increase in the coulomb interaction when the distribution of the electron charge deviates from the uniform one .",
    "this effect can be illustrated in the following way .",
    "if we consider the system having less than one electron per site in the partially filled electronic subshell ( for example @xmath13-electrons in la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 ) then the potential which this electron feels at some site must not depend on the orbital occupancy of this particular site , as the electron does not interact with itself .",
    "however , as the lsda potential is a functional of the electron density only , increasing the electron density at one site and decreasing it at another one , with a formation of the charge ordering , will lead to an increase of the potential at the first site and a decrease at the second one . as a result , in the self - consistency loops",
    ", the charge distribution will return to the uniform density . in order to cure this deficiency ,",
    "it is necessary to remove the self - interaction .",
    "the lsda+u method @xcite is one of the practical methods to solve the self - interaction problem .",
    "let us introduce the d - orbitals occupation matrix defined by :    @xmath42    where @xmath43 are the elements of the green function matrix ( @xmath44 : index of atom site , @xmath45 : main and orbital quantum numbers ( for example 3@xmath46 ) , @xmath47 : index of a particular @xmath46-orbital and @xmath48 : spin projection index ) . in terms of the elements of this occupation matrix @xmath49",
    ", the lsda+u functional @xcite is defined as follows :    @xmath50=e^{lsda}[\\rho ^\\sigma ( { \\bf r)}]+e^u[\\{n^\\sigma \\}]-e_{dc}[\\{n^\\sigma \\}]\\ ] ]    where @xmath51 is the charge density for spin-@xmath52 electrons and @xmath53 $ ] is the standard lsda ( local spin - density approximation ) functional .",
    "@xmath54 $ ] is the hartree - fock type electron - electron interaction energy given by @xmath55=\\frac 12\\sum_{\\{m\\},\\sigma } \\{\\langle m , m^{\\prime \\prime } \\mid v_{ee}\\mid m^{\\prime } , m^{\\prime \\prime \\prime } \\rangle n_{mm^{\\prime } } ^\\sigma n_{m^{\\prime \\prime } m^{\\prime \\prime \\prime } } ^{-\\sigma } \\\\ \\\\ -(\\langle m , m^{\\prime \\prime } \\mid v_{ee}\\mid m^{\\prime } , m^{\\prime \\prime \\prime } \\rangle -\\langle m , m^{\\prime \\prime } \\mid v_{ee}\\mid m^{\\prime \\prime \\prime } , m^{\\prime } \\rangle ) n_{mm^{\\prime } } ^\\sigma n_{m^{\\prime \\prime } m^{\\prime \\prime \\prime } } ^\\sigma \\ } , \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath56 is the screened coulomb interaction among the @xmath45 electrons .",
    "finally , the last term in eq.([u1 ] ) corrects for double counting and is given by    @xmath57=\\frac 12un(n-1)-\\frac 12j[n^{\\uparrow } ( n^{\\uparrow } -1)+n^{\\downarrow } ( n^{\\downarrow } -1)],\\ ] ]    were @xmath58 and @xmath59 @xmath60 and @xmath61 are screened coulomb and exchange parameters @xcite .",
    "in addition to the usual lsda potential , the variation of the functional ( [ u1 ] ) gives an effective single - particle potential to be used in the single - particle hamiltonian :    @xmath62    @xmath63    the matrix elements of the screened coulomb interaction @xmath56 can be expressed in terms of complex spherical harmonics and effective slater integrals @xmath64@xcite as @xmath65 where @xmath66 and    @xmath67    for d - electrons one needs @xmath68 and @xmath69 and these can be linked to the coulomb- and stoner parameters @xmath60 and @xmath61 obtained by the lsda - supercell procedures @xcite via @xmath70 and @xmath71 with the ratio @xmath72 being to a good accuracy a constant @xmath73 for the 3d elements @xcite .",
    "the lsda+u approximation was realized in the framework of the linear muffin - tin orbital method in the atomic sphere approximation ( lmto - asa)@xcite .",
    "the values of @xmath60=7.9 ev and @xmath61=0.9 ev were used as obtained from the constrained lsda supercell calculations .",
    "as a first step the electronic structure of the undoped prmno@xmath2 was calculated .",
    "this compound has practically the same properties as lamno@xmath2 .",
    "the only difference is that due to the smaller ionic radius of pr ion compared with that of la ion , the tilting of the oxygen octahedra in orthorombic @xmath19 crystal structure is stronger , resulting in smaller effective @xmath74 hopping between mn atoms and narrower band width",
    ".    the crystal structure of the doped pr@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 does not show transition to the rombohedral symmetry , as it is the case for la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 , preserving the orthorombic @xmath19 space group@xcite .",
    "however the values of the lattice parameters @xmath23,@xmath21 and @xmath22 for @xmath7=0.5 are so close that it can be called a pseudocubic structure . in this structure",
    "only the tilting of the oxygen octahedra is present , but octahedra themselves are not jahn - teller distorted as in the undoped crystal structure . in order to study effects of the orbital polarization purely due to the intrashell d - d coulomb interaction without any influence of the jahn - teller lattice distortion the calculation for the undoped prmno@xmath2",
    "was performed with the crystal structure parameters corresponding to pr@xmath3ca@xmath3mno@xmath2 .",
    "kugel and khomskii @xcite demonstrated for a wide range of jahn - teller magnetic compounds that the exchange mechanism ( caused by an interplay between on - site coulomb interaction @xmath60 and intersite hopping @xmath75 ) by itself , without taking janh - teller distortions into consideration , is able to give a correct picture of the spin and orbital ordering . in this case the change in the lattice structure ( the structural transition ) is a secondary effect .",
    "one may say that the system shows the `` jahn - teller ordering '' without the `` jahn - teller interaction '' .",
    "actually an exchange mechanism acts jointly with the jahn - teller and the quadrupole mechanisms .",
    "it is quite difficult to determine just which mechanism will be predominant in each specific case due to complexity of the real compound .",
    "one of the possible ways to answer this question in the frame of _ ab - initio _ band structure calculations is to use a crystal structure excluding distortions caused by the jahn - teller interaction .",
    "such kind of approach was used for the cooperative jahn - teller system kcuf@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "it also has the perovskite crystal structure , but there is no tilting of the cuf@xmath18 octahedra and all cu - f - cu angles are equal to 180@xmath20 .",
    "divalent copper ion in this compound has a @xmath76 configuration ( @xmath77 ) known to be a jahn - teller ion , and , indeed , the jahn - teller distortion is observed in the form of the elongated cuf@xmath18 octahedra with long axes alternatively along @xmath23 and @xmath21 axes in the @xmath78-plane .",
    "kugel and khomskii @xcite showed that a simple hubbard model type calculation in a mean - field approximation without taking into account the electron - phonon interaction could predict the orbital ordering ( alternating @xmath79 and @xmath80 cu3d - orbitals for electrons or @xmath81 and @xmath82 orbitals for holes ) corresponding to the symmetry of the experimentally observed lattice distortions .",
    "the lsda+u functional ( eq.[u1 ] ) has a definite important improvement upon the lsda : explicit cancellation of the self - interaction and the proper description of the lowering of coulomb interaction energy with development of the orbital polarization .",
    "the functional ( eq.[u1 ] ) is also rotationally invariant ( the total energy does not change with the unitary transformation of the d - orbital basis set @xmath83 ) , meaning that if the local coordinate system ( and , correspodingly d - orbital basis set @xmath83 ) was chosen inappropriately for describing the resulting orbital polarisation , the unitary transformation which diagonalizes the non - diagonal occupation matrix @xmath84 ( eq.[occ ] ) will give a proper orbital basis set .    the lsda+u calculation for kcuf@xmath2 @xcite in _ cubic _ perovskite crystal structure gave results fully confirming kugel - khomskii s prediction - alternating @xmath79 and @xmath80 orbital order .",
    "moreover , it was not just the lowest total energy configuration among many possible stationary configurations as in the model calculation @xcite , but the _ only one stable solution_. the lattice relaxation to minimize the total energy is in good agreement with experimental data .",
    "note that the standard lsda did not show the lattice instability with respect to the jahn - teller distortion in kcuf@xmath2 .",
    "we would like to emphasize that the orbital polarization caused by the d - d coulomb interactions practically did not change with the lattice distortion @xcite .",
    "the use of the crystal structure parameters corresponding to pr@xmath3ca@xmath3mno@xmath2 ( with undistorted oxygen octahedra ) for prmno@xmath2 may correspond to the use of the cubic perovskite crystal structure for kcuf@xmath2 .",
    "however , for prmno@xmath2 , we have to take into account the tilting of mno@xmath18 octahedra ( present in pr@xmath3ca@xmath3mno@xmath2 structure ) , which is essential for the proper description of the reduction in the effective @xmath74 hopping due to the bending of the mn - o - mn bond . the lsda+u calculation with the experimental a - type antiferromagnetic spin alignment resulted in a non - diagonal occupation matrix for spin density ( for the @xmath85 subspace ( @xmath86 and @xmath87 orbitals ) of one particular mn atom ) : @xmath88 the diagonalization of this matrix gives two new @xmath17 orbitals : @xmath89 with occupancy 0.71 and @xmath90 with occupancy 0.18 . for the second type of mn atom @xmath91 and @xmath92",
    "orbitals can be obtained by transposition of @xmath7 and @xmath93 .",
    "the resulting orbital order can be presented graphically by plotting the angle distribution of the @xmath13-electron spin density : @xmath94 as a mn@xmath9 ion has formally only one electron in partially filled @xmath17 subshell , the @xmath13-spin density must correspond to the density of this electron ( fig.1 ) .",
    "the plot of fig.1 and the form of the @xmath91 and @xmath92 orbitals diagonalizing the spin density occupation matrix show that the orbital order obtained in our lsda+u calculations for prmno@xmath2 is of the same symmetry as the one in kcuf@xmath2 . the `` parasitical '' lattice distortion , which one could expect from such orbital ordering : elongation of mno@xmath18 octahedra in the direction of the lobes of @xmath91 orbitals ,",
    "will reproduce the experimentally observed jahn - teller lattice distortion .",
    "the orbital polarization is far from being 100% , the difference in the occupancy of @xmath91 and @xmath92 orbitals is only 0.53 .",
    "the reason for this is the strong hybridization of @xmath17-orbitals with oxygen 2p - orbitals . in fig.2 , the total and partial densities of states ( dos ) for prmno@xmath2",
    "are shown ( for @xmath13-electrons dos projected on @xmath91 and @xmath92 orbitals are also presented ) .",
    "the electronic structure obtained in our lsda+u calculation is semiconducting with a band gap of 0.5 ev .",
    "note that the standard lsda needs the jahn - teller distorted crystal structure to reproduce the non - metallic ground state .",
    "the @xmath17-band is split by this gap into two subbands : the occupied one with the predominantly @xmath91 character , and the empty one with the @xmath92 character .",
    "however there is significant admixture of @xmath92 in the occupied subband and @xmath91 in the empty one .    after checking that our calculation scheme gives a proper orbital order in the undoped prmno@xmath2 , we applyed it to pr@xmath3ca@xmath3mno@xmath2 .",
    "in order to treat the experimentally observed ce - type of antiferromagnetism it was necessary to quadruple the @xmath19-type unit cell and the supercell had 16 formula units .",
    "the distribution of the pr and ca atoms in the lattice was chosen according to a model where all pr ions have only ca as their nearst neighbores in the lanthanide sublattice .",
    "we did not impose any symmetry restrictions in our calculation , the integration in the reciprocal space being performed for the whole brillouin zone , and the self - consistency iteration was started from a uniform distribution of @xmath13-electrons over both @xmath13-orbitals of all mn atoms .",
    "the result of the self - consistent calculation was a charge and orbital ordered insulator .",
    "the @xmath13-electron spin - density - plot calculated by eq.[f1 ] is presented in fig.3 .",
    "this is in a striking agreement with the orbital order derived in @xcite from the neutron diffraction mesuarements ( fig.4 ) .",
    "the unexpected result is that the total number of d - electrons at all types of mn sites are nearly equal ( 4.99 and 5.01 ) , so that formally mn@xmath34 ions ( in the fig.3 the ones with symmetric in - plane density distribution ) and mn@xmath33 ions ( the ones with the density strongly anisotropic ) have nearly the same number of 3d - electrons .",
    "however the difference in the magnetic moment values is more pronounced : 3.34@xmath95 for mn@xmath34 and 3.44 @xmath95 for mn@xmath33 .",
    "the results of our lsda+u calculations for pr@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 demonstrate that taking into account the coulomb interaction inside the d - shell of mn together with the intersite hopping is enough to reproduce not only the orbital order present in the undoped manganites , but also the localization and ordering of the holes in the doped materials .",
    "naturally the lattice relaxation ( jahn - teller and polaron lattice distortions ) will significantly renormalize the total energies , gap values , charge disproportion and magnetic moments .",
    "however it seems that the symmetry of the ordered state can be obtained without explicitly including the electron - lattice interactions .",
    "this is in clear contrast to the standard lsda where energy band splitting and orbital polarization appear only as results of the jahn - teller crystal structure distortion .",
