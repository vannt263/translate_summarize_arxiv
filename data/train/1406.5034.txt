    "quantum mechanics is one in a large class of theories which are consistent with relativity in the sense that they do not allow signals to be sent faster than the speed of light .",
    "many of these theories exhibit strong non - local correlations between distant particles that can not be explained by the properties of the individual particles alone .",
    "surprisingly , quantum mechanics is not the most non - local among them , which raises the question about the physical principle that singles out quantum mechanics and sets the limit on the possible strength of correlations in nature .    here",
    "we experimentally address this fundamental question by testing the principle of information causality in the classical , quantum and post - quantum regime .",
    "while the no - signaling principle limits the speed with which distant parties can communicate , information causality states that the accessible information can not be more than the information content of a communicated message , no matter what other shared resources are used .",
    "both classical and quantum mechanics satisfy this principle , while it is violated by most post - quantum theories  @xcite .",
    "we experimentally emulate correlations of various strengths from classical to almost maximally non - local and demonstrate a violation of the principle of information causality in the case where the simulated correlations are beyond the quantum regime .",
    "apparent super - quantum correlations are , in our approach , a consequence of the non - unitary evolution of quantum states when subjected to polarization - dependent loss with post - selection  @xcite . for moderate loss , we find that initially entangled states can result in super - quantum correlations , while unentangled states still appear classical . for higher loss on the other hand",
    "we observe super - quantum correlations even for classical input states .",

    "each box has a single input and output and the correlation between them is only restricted by the no - signaling principle .",
    "this means that the local outcome only depends on the local input , such that alice can not learn anything about bob s input from only her output .",
    "a typical quantum example of such a resource is a pair of entangled particles , shared between alice and bob , where inputs correspond to measurement settings and outputs to measurement outcomes . since the work of john bell  and numerous subsequent confirming experiments  it is now widely accepted that these particles exhibit non - local correlations , which have no classical explanation . under the no - signaling constraint alone , however , there are even stronger non - local correlations than quantum entanglement  @xcite .",
    "the maximum that is compatible with relativity is achieved by the so - called popescu - rohrlich ( pr)-box  @xcite , characterized by perfect correlations of the form @xmath0 , between alice s and bob s inputs @xmath1 and @xmath2 and outputs @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively .",

    "this experimentally testable reformulation of bell s inequality is satisfied by any correlation that can be described by a local hidden variable model .",

    "they are , however , linearly related and the difference is a simple rescaling of @xmath17 .    despite being a simple consequence of the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics ,",
    "it is unclear what the physical motivation is for this seemingly sub - optimal limit on the strength of quantum correlations .",
    "in fact even the algebraic maximum @xmath18 can be achieved ( by the pr - box ) without violating the no - signaling principle .",
    "this principle is physically motivated by the fact that , according to special relativity , faster - than - light information transfer would allow information to be sent backwards in time and thus violate causality . nevertheless",
    ", it does not explain why super - quantum correlations such as the pr - box are incompatible with quantum mechanics and seem not to exist in nature . a possible explanation is offered by the principle of information causality  a generalization of no - signaling  which states that there can not be more information available than was transmitted  @xcite .",
    "this can be understood on the basis of the following elementary information - theoretic protocol : bob tries to gain information from a set of data that is only known to alice .",
    "the parties are allowed to use an arbitrary amount of shared no - signaling resources , but may not communicate more than @xmath19 classical bits . in this case , the information causality principle states that the amount of information accessible to bob should be limited to @xmath19 classical bits  @xcite .     and",

    "similarly for weaker correlations , bob has more information available than contained in alice s message for all nesting levels as soon as the correlation strength surpasses @xmath75 .",
    "the fact that this value is significantly higher than tsirelson s bound of @xmath76 emphasizes that the quantity @xmath77 only recovers this bound in the asymptotic limit @xmath78 .",

    "the principle of information causality can not be probed using the depolarization approach , since it would result in isotropic correlations and information causality would not be violated .",
    "in contrast to the full set of no - signaling correlations , and the set of classical correlations , which both have the form of a well - characterized polytope , much less is known about the quantum set  @xcite .",
    "understanding the set of quantum correlations theoretically and characterizing it experimentally should thus be a primary aim from a practical as well as a fundamental perspective .",
    "information causality , which has been proposed as a physical principle to reconstruct the set of quantum correlations , has already proven successful in recovering the famous tsirelson bound .",
    "this limit of quantum correlations , however , is only one extremal point on the continuous boundary and there exist correlations below it , which nevertheless do not admit a quantum description  @xcite .",
    "information causality also rules out such correlations for some 2-dimensional slices of the full ( 8-dimensional ) no - signaling polytope , while it does not for other slices  @xcite .",

    "hence , a failure of these requirements could be interpreted as allowing for the generation of non - local correlations via local transformations .",
    "similar consequences might also arise from the violation of alternatives to information causality , which are more or less successful in recovering part of the quantum boundary .",
    "examples include the principles of local orthogonality  @xcite , the requirement that the theory has a suitable classical limit  @xcite or that certain communication  @xcite or computational tasks  @xcite are non - trivial .",
    "our method of simulating super - quantum correlations could be adapted to explore some of these alternative principles as well .",
    "of particular interest , however , would be a test of information causality in the multipartite case , since most of the above principles are formulated in the bipartite setting , which is bound to fail in recovering the full quantum boundary due to the existence of multipartite super - quantum correlations , which obey every bipartite principle  @xcite . while there are studies of information causality for higher - dimensional systems , which strengthen its position as a physical principle that determines quantum correlations  @xcite , a suitable generalization to the multipartite case is still an open problem .",
    "as highlighted by our experiment , special focus has to be put on anisotropic regions of the no - signaling polytope .",
    "specifically we find that the introduced figures of merit are not valid in a single instance of the protocol and have to be averaged over all possible datasets or estimated from the depolarized , isotropic data .",
    "this subtle , but very important detail is clearly highlighted by our experimental results , where we show how even a small amount of imbalance can result in a violation of the principle by quantum states for a specific choice of parameters , while obeying the principle on average .",
    "examining the results of a chsh - inequality test make it clear where our data crosses the boundary of the quantum set . in our investigation",
    "we focused on the scenario of a fixed maximally entangled state @xmath90 in situations with different amounts of loss , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : results ] .",
    "we further considered the state @xmath91 , which resembles the state @xmath90 after full decoherence as might happen during propagation between alice and bob .",
    "this allows for an intuitive comparison between the entangled and unentangled case .",
    "the tested inequality has the form of a chsh - inequality with measurements in the yz - plane of the bloch sphere . for the lossless case @xmath92 , alice s and bob s measurements",
    "can be viewed as the application of appropriate basis - rotations ( around the x - axis ) followed by projective measurements in the @xmath56-basis .",
    "these rotations can also be seen as phase - gates in the diagonal polarization basis @xmath93 . in the case where polarization dependent loss is present ,",
    "these phase - gates become non - unitary .",
    "they act as the identity on the state @xmath94 and impose a phase on the non - orthogonal state @xmath95 , where @xmath96 . the precise relation between @xmath63 and the degree of loss",

    "@xcite . as non - unitary operations",
    "can only be performed non - deterministically , postselection on success is required , which results in the observation of apparent super - quantum correlations .",

    "@xcite to symmetrize the simulated correlations , while preserving their possible anisotropy .",

    "this observation even holds when optimizing the separable state for maximal chsh - value , for each degree of loss  @xcite .",
    "note , however , that these results were obtained using the same measurements for both separable and entangled states , whereas arbitrary hidden variable theories would allow arbitrary measurements .     for both the entangled state @xmath97 ( blue circles ) and the separable state @xmath98 ( red squares ) , together with the theoretical predictions ( blue and red lines , respectively ) for these states , versus the amount of polarization - dependent loss as parametrized by @xmath63 .",
