    "a central task of modern cosmology is to determine what the universe made of .",
    "a number of observations suggest that the bulk of the matter in the universe is not luminous @xcite .",
    "direct searches for baryonic matter in the form of massive compact halo objects ( machos ) can not account for the matter that seems necessary to explain these observations @xcite .",
    "an alternative explanation is that weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) exist copiously in the halo of our galaxy but only rarely interact with ordinary matter @xcite .",
    "candidate wimps from particle theory include the axion and the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) in supersymmetric theories with r - parity conservation .",
    "numerous experiments have been set up in attempts to directly detect wimps @xcite .",
    "the two which are sensitive to the smallest spin independent cross sections are the cdms ge experiment @xcite and the dama nai experiment @xcite .",
    "recently , dama reported the presence of a signal consistent with a wimp at better than @xmath3 . when interpreted as a standard wimp with spin independent interactions , cdms rules out nearly all of the dama @xmath4 preferred region at @xmath5 confidence and all of it at @xmath6 confidence .",
    "attempts to reconcile these experiments using spin dependent interactions have been shown to be in gross conflict with indirect detection experiments and previous direct searches @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we will show that a simple modification to the properties of the dark matter particle can change the kinematics of the scattering sufficiently to reconcile the two experiments .",
    "in particular , we explore the possibility of inelastic dark matter : relic particles that can not scatter elastically off of nuclei .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : we begin by comparing the details of the two experiments and give a naive argument why inelastic dark matter can reconcile them . in section two",
    "we explicitly calculate the event rate at cdms and dama taking into account the inelasticity of the scattering . in section three",
    "we use this calculation to study what differences can arise relative to the elastic case and to examine whether there are regions of parameter space that give a signal at dama but a null result at cdms . in section four",
    "we discuss how inelastic dark matter could arise from a massive complex scalar split into two approximately degenerate real scalars , or from a dirac fermion split into two approximately degenerate majorana fermions .",
    "we also present a specific model , featuring a real component of the sneutrino as the dark matter , in which the mass splitting required to reconcile dama and cdms arises naturally . in section five",
    "we discuss direct detection possibilities at future experiments .",
    "if we are to understand the dama signal as evidence of dark matter , but simultaneously accept the null result of cdms , we must reconsider some basic element of the wimp hypothesis . before we address such a modification",
    ", we should understand the differences between the dama and cdms experiments .",
    "the dama experiment utilizes a set of nai crystals at the gran sasso national laboratory of infn to search for wimps .",
    "the basic premise of the experiment is that if wimps are present in the galaxy , as the galaxy rotates we feel a `` wind '' of wimps which will scatter elastically off of the target nuclei . as the earth moves in its orbit about the sun ,",
    "the flux and velocity distribution ( as seen by a terrestrial observer ) vary . rather than attempt to directly discriminate signal events against background , the dama experiment seeks to measure this modulation .",
    "there are two basic controls to this experiment .",
    "first , the signal phase must coincide with the earth s motion in the solar system , which moves maximally with the galactic rotation on june 2 , and maximally against on december 2 .",
    "the second requirement is that the signal must lie dominantly in the lowest energy bins - a characteristic signal of wimp scattering .",
    "in contrast , cdms uses a smaller ge target , but has excellent background rejection capable of distinguishing nuclear recoils from electron scatterings for scattering energies greater than @xmath7 . as a consequence",
    "their limits are comparable to those that would have been expected from a null dama result .",
    "exclusion plots are typically given in the @xmath8 plane , where @xmath9 is the mass of the candidate and @xmath10 is the scattering cross section per nucleon .",
    "implicit is the assumption that there are no great modifications in the scattering process between the two experiments .    however ,",
    "if the dark matter can not scatter elastically , then kinematical effects substantially distinguish the experiments .",
    "consider two states , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , with @xmath12 only slightly heavier than @xmath11 , such that @xmath11 can only scatter by transitioning to @xmath12 .",
    "it is a simple kinematical constraint that @xmath13 can only scatter inelastically off of a nucleus with mass @xmath14 if @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the mass splitting between @xmath13 and @xmath17 .",
    "the possibility of evading direct detection by having a large enough splitting @xmath16 was pointed out in @xcite . here",
    "we focus on the fact the constraint of equation ( [ eq : constraint ] ) becomes increasingly severe as @xmath14 is decreased .",
    "since iodine has an atomic number of 127 , while germanium has an atomic number of 73 , we have the prospect of a situation where particles will scatter at dama but not at cdms . for @xmath18 ( a typical dark matter particle velocity ) , and @xmath19 ,",
    "the limits are @xmath20 for cdms and @xmath21 for dama .",
    "if the mass splitting @xmath16 were @xmath22 , such a particle would be visible to dama but not cdms .    of course",
    ", in the halo of the galaxy there is a distribution of velocities , so the calculation is not as simple as we have just illustrated . in the full calculation",
    ", we will find that the values of @xmath16 relevant for reconciling the experiments are somewhat larger than 15 kev , and that the window for @xmath16 has a size @xmath23 kev rather than @xmath24 kev .",
    "in this section we review the standard calculation of event rates at direct detection experiments @xcite .",
    "the differential rate per unit detector mass is given by @xmath25 here @xmath26 is the recoil energy of the target nucleus , @xmath27 is the number of target nuclei per unit mass , @xmath28 is the local density of dark matter particles of mass @xmath29 , @xmath30 is the differential cross section for relic - nucleus scattering , and @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the relic speed and speed distribution function in the detector rest frame .",
    "we take @xmath33 gev/@xmath34 .",
    "because we are interested in spin - independent scattering , the differential cross section may be written @xmath35 where @xmath14 is the nucleus mass , @xmath36 is the reduced mass of the relic - nucleon system , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the relative coupling strengths to neutrons and protons , and @xmath10 is the relic - neutron cross section at zero momentum transfer , in the elastic @xmath39 limit .",
    "we use the helm form factor @xcite @xmath40 with @xmath41 , @xmath42 fm , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 .",
    "we assume a standard maxwell - boltzman distribution for the relic velocities in the galactic rest frame , with a root - mean - squared velocity @xmath45 , where we take @xmath46 km / s to be the rotational speed of the local standard of rest ( lsr ) . in our calculation",
    "we take the escape velocity to infinity for simplicity , when one really should take @xmath47 km / s . by doing",
    "so we overestimate the signal for large values of the mass splitting @xmath16 . for a 100 gev relic",
    ", this is a 10% effect at cdms for @xmath48 kev and a factor of two effect for @xmath49 kev . because iodine is heavier than germanium",
    ", the effect is far milder at dama , roughly 10% at @xmath49 kev .",
    "the earth s speed relative to the galactic rest frame is @xmath50 here @xmath51",
    "km / s , @xmath52 km / s , @xmath53/year , @xmath54 june 2nd , and @xmath55 . defining the dimensionless variables @xmath56 and @xmath57 , performing the velocity integration in ( [ eq : rate1 ] ) , and applying ( [ eq : cs1 ] ) , one obtains @xmath58 for the dama detector , one should take into account there being two species of target nuclei with different quenching factors .",
    "often one considers the case where @xmath59 ( so that the rate is proportional to @xmath60 ) , and presents results in the @xmath29 - @xmath61 plane . below we will be particularly interested in models in which the scattering is dominated by vector interactions arising from @xmath62 boson exchange , giving @xmath63 ( and yielding a rate that is instead nearly proportional to @xmath64 ) . in all of our calculations",
    "we take this value for @xmath65 .",
    "the differential rate of equation ( [ eq : rate2 ] ) depends on the mass splitting parameter @xmath16 through @xmath66 , which is given by @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the reduced mass of the relic - nucleus system .",
    "a non - zero @xmath16 increases the minimum relic speed required to produce a given nuclear recoil energy . in the following section we explore potential consequences for direct detection signals arising due to this modification",
    "before we study whether there are regions of parameter space that are consistent with both dama and cdms , it is worthwhile to investigate the differences arising when compared with the elastic case .",
    "we have seen that for a given velocity of dark matter particle , it might be that only dama is be able to detect the particle , and not cdms .",
    "given the distribution of relic velocities , we can now determine what effect the inelasticity has on the full signal integrated over all velocities . the simplest quantity to consider is the level at which the signal bins for cdms and @xmath69 for dama .",
    "] is suppressed when compared with the elastic case .",
    "we plot these suppressions for cdms and dama in figure [ fig : relsupp ] .",
    "we can easily see that our basic intuition is borne out .",
    "the greater the splitting between @xmath11 and @xmath12 , the greater the suppression for cdms compared to that of dama . since the cdms excluded region only just covers the dama preferred region , even a factor of a few can dramatically improve the consistency of the experiments .",
    "however , the relative suppression is not the only relevant quantity because dama is not sensitive to the total flux , but rather to the modulation of the flux . because of the inelasticity",
    ", dama only sees those particles on the high tail of the maxwellian distribution .",
    "consequently , a small modulation in the average velocity can lead to much higher modulation for a given signal when compared with the elastic case .",
    "this effect is demonstrated in figure [ fig : relmod ] .",
    "the combination of these two effects results in dama having significant regions of sensitivity that are inaccessible to the existing ge experiments .",
    "the dama signal can be decomposed into background , unmodulated signal and modulated signal as @xmath70 where @xmath71 indexes the energy bin of each piece of the total measured events @xmath68 . recently ,",
    "the dama collaboration published its best fit values of @xmath72 and @xmath73 for the energy bins @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "it is tempting to fit the inelastic scattering case to these values , but to do so would be misleading .",
    "these best fit values are derived assuming the energy spectrum and relative size of the modulated piece to be given by the known relations for an elastically scattering wimp .",
    "we have already seen in figure [ fig : relmod ] that the standard wimp and inelastic wimp cases can lead to very different predictions for the relative size of the modulated piece , so any fit to the published best - fit values would not be rigorous .",
    "another , potentially more significant reason that we can not use the standard wimp @xmath73 values comes from changes in the energy spectrum of the events .",
    "because the scattering is inelastic , the total number of events may not rise exponentially at low energy .",
    "in other cases , the spectra will be nearly identical .",
    "as examples we compare in figure [ fig : modspectrum ] the expected wimp spectrum of the modulation signal to the spectrum in the inelastic wimp scenario for two values of @xmath16 .",
    "the potential differences revealed in figure [ fig : modspectrum ] make it possible to fit only to the model independent data recently published .",
    "we will discuss the details of this fit shortly .",
    "these spectrum differences carry over to germanium experiments .",
    "as we show in figure [ fig : cdmsspec ] , the changes can again be significant , and can again alter the interpretation of the experimental data .",
    "for instance , in the elastic case one expects an exponential rise in the number of relic scattering events for lower energies .",
    "were cdms to see many events in the @xmath78 bin , but essentially an absence of events below @xmath79 , this would be inconsistent with an elastic dark matter signal , but not with an inelastic dark matter signal .",
    "again , we do not perform a rigorous fit to the cdms data as this would require an ability to accurately simulate the correlation of multiple scatterers with single scatterers , which we lack .    for the purposes of generating allowed regions",
    ", we will thus use the following limits : for dama , we will use the published model independent modulation in the @xmath80 bins of @xmath81 @xcite and consider the three sigma region to be allowed .",
    "dama claims not to have modulation in the higher energy bins .",
    "although the measured modulation for energies above @xmath82 is not published , we will take an upper limit of @xmath83 , which we consider quite reasonable given the errors on the best fit values for the higher energy bins .",
    "for cdms , we will require a predicted mean of fewer than six total events , consistent with the published limits @xcite .",
    "dama has also reported null results arising from a pulse shape analysis ( psa ) of a portion of their nai data @xcite and of data from an experiment with xe @xmath84 @xcite .",
    "using the pulse shape , they can discriminate signal from background , and place a limit on the total number of events .",
    "both of these studies affect the elastic wimp preferred region for dama .",
    "extracting rate limits from tables and plots of @xcite and @xcite , we find the xe studies have the dominant impact on our allowed regions . for the xe experiment we require the signal to be less than @xmath85 @xmath86 for the @xmath87 bin , @xmath88 @xmath86 for the @xmath89 bin , @xmath90 @xmath91 for the @xmath92 bin , and @xmath93 @xmath86 for the @xmath94 bin , consistent with published limits @xcite .",
    "we show the allowed regions subject to these constraints for various values of @xmath9 in figure [ fig : regions ] . as expected , there are broad regions that fit the dama data and which are not excluded by cdms .",
    "it is important to note that our qualitative results are not very sensitive to the details of the criteria used to determine what signals are consistent with experiment .",
    "the general features of figure [ fig : regions ] remain essentially intact even if we are more conservative in our estimates of the allowed counts at cdms , or of the accuracy of the measured modulation at dama .    as an explicit example , let us consider the point @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "here the modulation is quite consistent with the dama best fit point , but cdms has only an expected signal of @xmath98 events , and the xe pulse shape analysis constraints are evaded .",
    "a comparison between the inelastic point and the dama best fit values for the elastic case is given in table [ tb : splits ] .",
    "@xmath99 & @xmath100 @xmath101 & @xmath102 & @xmath103 @xmath104 & @xmath105 & @xmath106 @xmath107 & @xmath108 & @xmath109    [ tb : specpoint ]      unlike the ordinary wimp scenario , the only inelastic wimps that scatter in existing experiments are those on the high end of the maxwell - boltzman velocity distribution . as such ,",
    "there is greater uncertainty in the precise values of @xmath10 that fit the data than for an ordinary wimp .",
    "in particular , there is significant uncertainty in the dispersion velocity @xmath110 and in the local halo velocity @xmath111 .",
    "although these uncertainties are @xmath112 , the effects can be amplified because of the presence of the exponential in the distribution .",
    "we have investigated these effects and found that the preferred cross sections can can shift by as much as a factor of three for @xmath113 and a factor of seven for @xmath114 .",
    "likewise the local density @xmath28 is uncertain to a factor of approximately two , and moreover , the presence of substructure in the halo of the galaxy can lead to amplifications of the local density relative to the average halo density by a factor of three or more @xcite .",
    "finally , we must restate that we have assumed a maxwell - boltzmann distribution , which arises in the isothermal sphere model of dark matter .",
    "changes to the velocity profile of the dark matter can have significant effects on the modulation for standard wimps @xcite , and inelastic dark matter potentially is even more sensitive to these changes .",
    "such uncertainties are difficult to quanitify and we do not discuss them further .    altogether these uncertainties can amount to a change in the preferred @xmath10 values , but we should emphasize that the sizes of the regions of parameter space that yield consistency between dama and cdms do not change dramatically .",
    "up to this point , we have considered inelastic dark matter as an interesting phenomenological possibility , but have not addressed how such particles might arise in a reasonable model .",
    "one possibility is that the relic particle is a real scalar , so that its vector coupling to nuclei is forbidden by bose symmetry .",
    "consider a complex scalar @xmath115 coupled to an abelian gauge field @xmath116 .",
    "its vector interaction comes from @xmath117 that is , the real scalars @xmath118 and @xmath119 couple to each other , but neither couples to itself .",
    "these real scalars are degenerate if the only mass term is @xmath120 , but introducing a small additional mass term @xmath121 , splits this degeneracy violates gauge invariance , and can only arise once the gauge symmetry of the theory has been broken . ] . if @xmath122 is roughly @xmath123 gev , and we want a splitting @xmath124 kev , then we require @xmath125 . in the model of section [",
    "subsection : model ] , which features a real component of a sneutrino as the dark matter , this scale for @xmath126 arises naturally .    before discussing this model",
    ", we note that the inelastic dark matter could instead be fermionic . consider a dirac fermion @xmath127 that has vector and axial - vector couplings to quarks : @xmath128 assuming for simplicity that the various @xmath129 s are of comparable size , the largest contribution to the low - energy scattering of @xmath130 off of nuclei will come from the vector - vector piece , which will yield an amplitude that scales roughly as the number of nucleons .",
    "the axial - axial piece yields a smaller spin - dependent contribution that lacks this enhancement , while the vector - axial pieces vanish in the extreme non - relativistic limit .",
    "now suppose that in addition to a dirac mass @xmath124 gev for @xmath130 , the lagrangian also contains a very small majorana mass term @xmath131 , with @xmath132 kev .",
    "then the majorana fermion mass eigenstates are @xmath133 the vector current essentially couples @xmath134 to @xmath135 , with only a small additional piece @xmath136 coupling each mass eigenstate to itself : @xmath137 because @xmath138 , we ignore the second term , and find that the only way for @xmath134 to scatter coherently off of nuclei is to make a transition into the heavier @xmath135 state .",
    "this inelastic process will dominate relative to the elastic , spin dependent scattering provided that the coherence enhancement , which gives a factor @xmath139 in the cross section , overcomes than the suppression due to the inelasticity . in this case",
    ", the rate can depend sensitively on the mass of the target nucleus , as desired .",
    "interestingly enough , a suitable candidate for inelastic dark matter has already been discussed in the literature . in supersymmetric theories with lepton number violation ,",
    "the lsp can be a real component of the sneutrino @xcite : a lagrangian term @xmath140 lifts the degeneracy between the sneutrino s odd and even cp eigenstates @xmath141 and @xmath142 .",
    "this splitting prevents elastic scattering of the lightest state , @xmath141 , off of nuclei through @xmath62 exchange .",
    "there is still the challenge of achieving a cosmologically interesting relic abundance - for an ordinary @xmath143 gev sneutrino @xmath144 comes out too small . in @xcite , this problem was resolved by taking the mass splitting between @xmath141 and @xmath142 to be large enough to prevent coannihilation via an s - channel @xmath62 in the early universe , @xmath145 gev , leading to a radiatively generated neutrino neutrino mass @xmath146 5 mev .",
    "different approaches were taken in the models of @xcite .",
    "these models feature standard model singlet scalars @xmath147 that are kept light by a global symmetry @xcite in analogue to the giudice - masiero solution to the @xmath68 problem @xcite , or by a gauged b - l symmetry @xcite .",
    "the singlet states mix with ordinary sneutrinos through weak scale @xmath148 terms , so that the gauge interactions of the mass eigenstates are suppressed by mixing angles .",
    "this suppression allows for an interesting relic abundance even for values of @xmath16 too small to prevent coannihilation between @xmath141 and @xmath142 .    for concreteness we will specialize to the model of @xcite .",

    "note that because the scattering off of nuclei is suppressed both by the inelasticity of the reaction and by a @xmath173 factor , the ability to obtain a large enough signal at dama depends crucially on the fact that ordinary sneutrinos give a signal roughly three orders of magnitude above present bounds .",
    "we also calculate the relic abundance as a function of @xmath171 and @xmath174 using standard methods .",

    "first , the capture rate in the sun is sensitive to the parameters @xmath188 , @xmath179 and @xmath16 .",
    "second , if the captured sneutrinos annihilate directly into neutrinos , the flavor of the lightest sneutrino determines what flavor of neutrino is produced , and details of the neutrino masses and mixings impact the flavor of the neutrino detected at the earth .",
    "third , cosmological uncertainties mentioned in section [ subsection : cosmun ] can change the preferred region of @xmath10 and thus the capture rate .",
    "finally , relatively minor extensions to the model of section [ subsection : model ] can also complicate matters . as a consequence of these various sources of uncertainty , indirect techniques do not rule out inelastic sneutrino dark matter .",
    "however , they do impose strong constraints , as broad regions of parameter space lead to signals above experimental bounds .",
    "moreover , indirect detection experiments offer the strong possibility of detection if the bound on the muon flux improves considerably @xcite .",
    "one might expect that the same inelasticity that suppresses the signal at cdms should be even more effective in suppressing the capture rate by the sun , which is mainly composed of relatively light nuclei .",
    "in fact , this is typically not the case . because particles passing through the sun are unusually energetic ( the escape velocity at the surface of the sun is much larger than the average velocity of a halo particle ) , the inelasticity is _ less _ relevant in the sun than at direct detection experiments .    in what follows ,",
    "we have followed @xcite in calculating solar capture rates and the induced muon flux , but have modified the approach to approximate the suppression of the capture rate due to the inelasticity ( see appendix ) .",
    "this suppression depends on the mass of the nucleus .",
    "for example , for @xmath48 kev and @xmath189 gev , we find a factor @xmath190 suppression for scattering off of oxygen in the sun , and a factor @xmath191 suppression for scattering off of iron .",
    "we will separately consider first , the case in which the sneutrinos can not annihilate into w s , and second , the case in which they can . for @xmath192 , sneutrinos in the sun",
    "typically annihilate dominantly to neutrinos via t - channel neutralino exchange .",
    "if we neglect cosmological uncertainties , we find that for values of @xmath171 , @xmath16 and @xmath179 that lead to interesting relic abundances and consistency with cdms and dama , the flux of neutrinos produced is quite large .",
    "if these are all muon flavor , we would expect a flux of upward - going muons of at least @xmath193 , in conflict with experimental results .",
    "on the other hand , if the sneutrinos annihilate into electron neutrinos that do not oscillate into muon neutrinos , bounds from direct detection are evaded entirely .",
    "if this is the case , only direct detection experiments will be able to yield a positive signal .",
    "finally , we note that there are specific parameter choices for which the dominant annihilation of sneutrinos in the sun is through s - channel higgs to @xmath194 .",
    "we find that this allows the flux of upward - going muons to be as small as a factor of @xmath191 above current limits for parameters that yield an acceptable abundance and acceptable direct detection signals",
    ".    with cosmological uncertainties included , more scenarios are allowed . relatively small variations in @xmath110 can accomodate factors of two , such as if the dominant annihilation is into @xmath195 .",
    "direct annihilation into muon neutrinos would require a more specious conspiracy of errors .",
    "for instance , if the solar system were presently in an anomalously high density region of the galaxy arising from substructure , and if @xmath110 were @xmath4 above the value we have used , experiments could accomodate as much as one - third of the neutrinos produced being muon flavored .",
    "this seems quite unlikely , but is , at least in principle , still allowed",
    ".    however , for these lighter sneutrinos , if indirect detection experiments improve by an order of magnitude , they will be able to probe almost all of the parameter space , even accounting for a broad class of cosmological uncertainties , and situations where there is annihilation to @xmath195 .    for heavier sneutrinos ( @xmath196 ) , the dominant annihilation processes in the sun",
    "can easily be s - channel higgs exchange to w s and z s . in this case",
    "we find that it is possible to reduce the expected signal at direct - detection experiments to a factor of @xmath197 above current limits for parameters consistent with dama , cdms , and @xmath198 .",
    "these heavier sneutrinos are less affected by cosmological uncertainties , but these uncertainties still make it impossible to rule out this scenario .",
    "future improvements in indirect detection could rule out this region of parameter space , especially as the experimental signal is less sensitive to the flavor of the lightest sneutrino than for the case of @xmath199 .",
    "of course , this discussion applies only to the model of section [ subsection : model ] , and one can consider modifications to the model that suppress the indirect detection signal .",
    "the premise of the model is that light standard model singlets are natural . given this , if we add to that model another standard model singlet @xmath200 , with the same r - charge as the right handed neutrino @xmath153 , but opposite r - parity , we expect a superpotential interaction @xmath201",
    ". then through t - channel @xmath200 exchange , @xmath161 s can annihilate to right - handed neutrinos .",
    "if these decay dominantly into muons or electrons ( rather than tau s ) and off - shell w s , we find that it is possible to bring the flux of upward going muons induced by the w decay products down to current limits . ] .",
    "future indirect experiments would still likely be able to see the decay products of these right handed neutrinos .",
    "this is just one example of a modification to the model which diminishes the signal , and there may be others , but such uncertainty is difficult to quantify . while indirect experiments offer a good opportunity to test specific models and regions of parameter space , there is an excellent likelihood that upcoming direct detection experiments will be able to determine whether inelastic dark matter is the resolution of the conflict between dama and cdms .",
    "in the inelastic dark matter scenario , the boundaries of the dama preferred region are not far from the current limits from cdms .",
    "planned experiments should be able to cover the existing dama region .",
    "most important are planned improvements to germanium experiments , and the cresst experiment , which will use the heavy element tungsten .",
    "cdms will soon be moving to the soudan mine , and should be able to improve its limits by at least two orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "the genius ge experiment @xcite should go well below that , likely allowing both to test much of the preferred regions discussed in section [ sec : sigs ] .",
    "there is a caveat in this statement : in generating the plots of figure [ fig : regions ] , we neglected to include the effect of a finite galactic escape velocity .",
    "this was a harmless simplification for our purposes there , because the effects at dama due to the finite galactic escape velocity are relatively minor .",
    "the effects can be much larger at cdms .",
    "recall that the requirement for scattering is @xmath202 this constraint is particularly stringent for light candidates .",
    "for instance , with @xmath114 and @xmath203 equation ( [ eq : redundant ] ) tells us that only for @xmath204 can one hope to obtain any signal at all at a germanium detector ( recall that the highest velocity of particles incident on the earth is @xmath205 ) .",
    "thus , the higher @xmath16 regions may not be testable at cdms .    for heavier candidates ,",
    "the finite galactic escape velocity is not especially important , even at cdms . with a galactic escape velocity of @xmath206 , and @xmath113 ,",
    "the cutoff for @xmath16 is @xmath207 . on the other hand ,",
    "the galactic escape velocity is not a particularly well known quantity , and if instead we take @xmath208 , the cutoff for @xmath16 is only @xmath209 .",
    "these uncertainties make the cresst experiment @xcite , using tungsten , especially significant .",
    "because tungsten ( @xmath210 ) is heavier than iodine ( @xmath211 ) , given adequate exposure time , cresst should cover the dama preferred region , irrespective of cosmological uncertainties .",
    "a very real possibility is that both germanium and tungsten experiments _ will _ have signals , which , when interepreted as elastic scatterings , would be inconsistent with one another .",
    "the most striking possibility of all is a spectrum deformation at the germanium detectors , as discussed in section [ sec : sigs ] . if cdms were to see an excess of events in the @xmath212 region , but no excess below @xmath213 , it would be a compelling signature of this scenario .",
    "if in fact the majority of the matter of the universe is non - baryonic , the attempt to determine its nature is one of the most exciting endeavors of modern cosmology .",
    "existing dark matter searches have already begun to probe interesting regions of parameter space for candidate particles such as neutralinos and axions .",
    "the positive result from the dama experiment is difficult to a understand in terms of these candidates , as it is in seeming conflict with constraints arising from the cdms experiment .",
    "we have seen that this conflict vanishes if we allow for the possibility that the dark matter particle can only scatter inelastically .",
    "we have shown that the sneutrino , when mixed with a singlet scalar with weak lepton number violation , is a viable candidate for inelastic dark matter .",
    "the regions of parameter space which give an interesting relic sneutrino abundance overlap with the regions which give a positive dama signal .",
    "indirect detection experiments tightly constrain models of sneutrino dark matter , but do not rule them out .    even absent a particular model ,",
    "we find it interesting that such a simple modification of the dark matter s properties can give remarkably different predictions , including the suppression of a signal at cdms .",
    "we consider these results sufficiently interesting as to warrant an analysis of the full dama data set should the raw data become available .    0.3 in    * acknowledgments * 0.15 in we",
    "thank l. hall , w. haxton , c. hogan , and t. quinn for useful discussions , and h. murayama and a. nelson for reviewing the paper and providing valuable comments .",
    "here we describe how we approximate the suppression of the rate of relic capture by the sun due to the inelasticity of the scattering . ignoring nuclear form factors , the scattering probability for a given relative velocity @xmath214",
    "is equally distributed between the minimum and maximum nuclear recoil energies @xmath215 and @xmath216 ( these parameters depend on the nucleus mass , the relic mass @xmath122 , @xmath214 , and @xmath16 ) . ordinarily , the low - energy scattering cross section is independent of @xmath214 , but in the inelastic case there is an additional phase space factor @xmath217 , where @xmath68 is the reduced mass . capture only occurs when @xmath218 holds . here",
    "@xmath219 is the ( position - dependent ) escape velocity , which we approximate as @xcite @xmath220 where @xmath221 km / s , @xmath222 km / s , and @xmath223 is the mass contained within the radius @xmath224 .",
    "the capture rate off of a given species of nuclei is then proportional to @xmath225 where @xmath226 is the mass density of the species and @xmath227 is the rotational speed of the local standard of rest .",
    "we calculate this factor ( which does not account for form factor suppressions ) in the elastic ( @xmath228 ) and inelastic cases to estimate the suppression coming from the inelasticity .",
    "we then obtain capture rates by multiplying this suppression with the rate obtained for the elastic case using the formulae of @xcite ( which do include form factor suppressions ) .      v.  trimble , ann .",
