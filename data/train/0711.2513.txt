    "dvali , gabadadze and porrati proposed a brane world model embedded in the minkowski 5d dimension  @xcite , which has been taken as an alternative theory to explain cosmic acceleration .",
    "there are two distinct branches of this model : one is the self - accelerating branch ( hereafter sdgp ) and the other is the normal branch ( hereafter ndgp ) .",
    "deffayet discovered the accelerated phase in sdgp without cosmological constant  @xcite , which has been tested geometrically by many authors  @xcite .",
    "the detectability will be enhanced by the structure formation test  @xcite .",
    "the distinct evolution of perturbed gravitational potential of sdgp has been studied by many authors at scales in quasi - static limit  @xcite and scales at nearly horizon size  @xcite .",
    "sdgp strengthens the integrated sach - wolfe ( hereafter isw ) effect , and leaves a detectable signature on cmb power spectra and isw - galaxy cross - correlation  @xcite .",
    "there is no cosmic acceleration induced spontaneously in ndgp without introducing cosmological constant .",
    "but it s attracting features are that ndgp has a spectrum leading to the stability in quantum level  @xcite , and that the effective equation of state @xmath0 crosses @xmath2 without phantom dark energy .",
    "ndgp has been tested by many authors geometrically as a natural theory crossing @xmath2 line below  @xcite . but",
    "no detailed study has been done to show how to formulate the large scale structure formation of ndgp in order to improve the detectability .",
    "we study the large scale structure formation of ndgp by using the scaling method developed by sawicki , song and hu  @xcite . on - brane equations of motion are not in the closed form without the information of the gradient crossing the bulk direction .",
    "off - brane equation of motion should be coupled in order to supply this gradient of perturbations at the location of brane .",
