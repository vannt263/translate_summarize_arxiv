    "the disagreement with the conventionally accepted rg values of the critical exponents has been widely discussed in  @xcite , providing arguments that very sensitive numerical tests confirm our theoretical predictions .",

    "namely , as in the case of @xmath679 , any insertion of a resummed @xmath266point cumulant block with @xmath266 outer zero  vector lines gives a constant factor @xmath694 at @xmath227 .",

    "the latter means that quantity @xmath697 vanishes ( at @xmath129 ) in the thermodynamic limit @xmath227 .",
    "however , if it would not vanish , then it would produce a contribution to the derivative @xmath696 which is by a factor @xmath237 larger than the ordinary terms @xmath713 .",
    "it means that not only the leading behavior , but also the corrections to finite ",
    "size scaling in  ( a8 ) and  ( a9 ) could play some role . at @xmath73",
    "these corrections are exponentially small , as consistent with the known exponential decay of the real  space correlation functions in ising model below @xmath15 .",
    "the latter is true also at @xmath17 for the longitudinal component of the correlation functions at finite values of the amplitude @xmath223 of the symmetry ",
    "breaking term in  ( [ eq : h1 ] ) , since in this case hamiltonian  ( [ eq : h1 ] ) looses the rotational symmetry and , therefore , belongs to the ising universality class . since @xmath223 is a continuous parameter , the exponential decay of correlations",
    "will be observed at large enough distances @xmath714 for any arbitrarily small , but finite value of @xmath223 .",
    "it means that the corrections are exponentially small in our limit @xmath38 , where @xmath419 is the linear size of the system .",
    "there is no any contradiction with the power  like decay of correlations we found at @xmath17 , since this decay refers to the limit where @xmath110 and , simultaneously , @xmath715 hold ( i.  e. , we find the thermodynamic limit at any given nonzero wave vector ) .",
    "thus , we finally arrive to the conclusion that corrections to  ( a8 ) and  ( a9 ) are exponentially small in @xmath716 and , therefore , @xmath717 holds at @xmath129 with a high enough accuracy , i.  e. , quantities @xmath694 can be treated as pure constants providing no extra contributions due to their variations . as discussed before , it means that the inserted zero  vector  cumulants merely renormalize by constant factors the `` normal '' terms in the diagram expansion of @xmath679 and @xmath696 .",
    "since our analysis is not based on specific values of expansion coefficients , this renormalization can not affect our qualitative conclusions .",
    "it means that the general scaling form of @xmath679 and @xmath696 is correctly predicted by the simplified analysis which ignores the zero  vector  cumulant insertions .",
    "our foregoing consideration of @xmath91 is restricted to @xmath94 due to a technical reason that the relation to cumulant correlation functions with a certain physical meaning is known only for this case . since @xmath269 is a continuous parameter , we believe that the above discussed properties remain true for all values of interest , i.  e. , @xmath718 $ ] .",
    "we can use the alternative method to find quantity @xmath90 , as proposed in sec .",
    "[ sec : alternative ] .",
    "it is straightforward to check in each specific case we considered in our paper that eq .",
    "( [ eq : altern ] ) provides the same scaling properties of @xmath90 at @xmath129 as the equations  ( [ eq : dast ] ) and  ( [ eq : r ] ) . regarding the `` normal '' terms , it is easy to verify ( like in secs .",
    "[ sec : leading ]  [ sec : correc ] and in sec .",
    "[ sec : low1 ] ) that in the most nontrivial case of @xmath17 at @xmath5 below @xmath15 , as well as at @xmath244 in the case of @xmath73 , the main contribution comes from all diagrams of eq .",
    "( [ eq : altern ] ) in which the waved lines have nonzero wave vectors and each second solid line with @xmath39 has fixed wave vector @xmath226 ( i.  e. , there are no integrations in the case of @xmath73 ) , counting the pair of outer lines as one line .",
    "this peculiarity does not refer to the case @xmath11 , where all the partial contributions with @xmath311 , @xmath233 , @xmath234 , etc .",

    "the two different modifications of our method obviously give consistent corrections to scaling : they have the same origin . the alternative approach [ eq .",

    "as before , the zero  vector  cumulant insertions merely renormalize by constant factors the `` normal '' terms .",
