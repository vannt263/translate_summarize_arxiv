    "the cxb was discovered almost half a century ago @xcite , and is now understood to be dominated by the integrated emission from gas being heated and accreted onto smbhs at the centers of active galaxies .",

    "deep extra - galactic surveys have now resolved a significant fraction ( @xmath370% ) of the background light at @xmath7 10 kev into discrete sources @xcite , with the resolved fraction decreasing with the increasing energy bands .",
    "the exact fraction also depends on the absolute normalization of the cxb spectrum whose dispersion reaches @xmath330% at low energies ( @xmath7 10 kev ) and @xmath310% above 10 kev among different studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the general strategy is to invoke the sed of a type-1 agn along with a varying hi column density @xcite , consistent with the unified scheme for agn @xcite where seyfert-2 galaxies are obscured variants of seyfert-1 galaxies and exhibit harder x - ray spectra . today",
    "cxb models not only reproduce the cxb spectrum ( 1 - 100 kev ) but also the x - ray number counts , redshift distributions , and spectral properties in both soft and hard bands ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". it is generally accepted that the majority of x - ray agn activity occurs in the obscured phase and that the evolution of x - ray agn is luminosity dependent , with the density of seyfert - like agn peaking around @xmath2=1 and quasars peaking at @xmath2=2 - 3 . however , there are still important uncertainties in the derived parameters , such as the type-1/type-2 agn ratio and its variation with luminosity and redshift , and the amount of compton - thick objects .",
    "such difficulties are at least partly caused by the fact that the current x - ray surveys at @xmath7 10 kev are not sensitive to heavily - extinguished agn , especially compton - thick objects , and overall number counts remain limited .",
    "the cirb was first directly measured in the 1990s by cobe ( for a review , see * ? ? ?",
    "the energy of cirb is comparable to the cosmic uv / optical energy @xcite , while the ratio in the local universe is only one third @xcite .",
    "this implies an increase in dusty sources with increasing redshift .",
    "the slope of the cirb in the far - ir / submm range is flatter than that of local starburst galaxies , which provides further evidence for the strong evolution of ir sources whose peak emission is redshifted toward longer wavelength , flattening the cirb spectrum at the longer wavelength .",
    "unlike the cxb model where the hi column density is considered to be the main factor driving the variation of the sed , the cirb model typically varies the sed mainly as a function of ir luminosity .",
    "they either adopt a fixed sed at a given luminosity @xcite , or further consider the scatter of the sed at a given luminosity @xcite , or assume different ir populations that exhibit different seds and occupy different luminosity ranges @xcite .",
    "the smbh radiation , with typically a much warmer ir sed compared to that of star formation regions is energetically important in mid - ir surveys : the contribution of agn to the mid - ir background reaches noticeable fractions , e.g. 10 - 20% in the 1 - 20 @xmath15 m range by @xcite or 2 - 10% in the 3 - 24 @xmath15 m by @xcite ; classifications ( agn vs star - formation dominated ) of 24 @xmath15 m sources indicate that the fraction of objects whose mid - ir emission is dominated by agn ranges from @xmath340% at f@xmath33 @xmath1 5 mjy and drops down with decreasing fluxes but remains around 10% down to the faintest end f@xmath33 @xmath3 0.08 mjy @xcite .",
    "however , the 24 @xmath15 m number counts can be reproduced equally well by models with agn @xcite and without agn @xcite , reflecting the limitation of the cirb synthesis models in decomposing smbh and star - formation emission .",
    "models without agn can re - produce the effect of agn in the mid - ir simply by modifying the star - formation mid - ir sed or by adjusting the slope of lfs and their redshift evolution .",
    "our model has four basic components , each of which contains a few components .",
    "the four components are a luminosity function defined in the total ir band ( 8 - 1000 @xmath15 m ) , the smbh energy fraction in the total ir band , the luminosity - dependent sed for the star - forming component , and the type-1 smbh sed extinguished by a hi column density .",
    "the first component describes the number density of galaxies at a given redshift and total ir luminosity , while the second one decomposes this luminosity into star - formation and smbh total ir emission .",
    "the last two then generate star - formation and smbh emission at any observed band from their corresponding total ir luminosities .",
    "the general rule for setting the total number of free parameters is that the model starts with the minimum set of free parameters and additional ones are added if the reduced @xmath0 decreases by about 0.5 . the goal is to fit model predictions to number counts , redshift distributions and local lfs data , which offers hundreds of data points .",
    "as discussed in the following of this section , we will run a total of four variants of the model to reflect current uncertainties on the star - forming and smbh seds .",
    "we represent the galaxy total ir lf as a double power - law distribution with ten free parameters : @xmath34\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we adopt a simple independent luminosity and density evolution ( ilde ) .",
    "the evolution is described as a polynominal function of redshift : @xmath35 @xmath36 where @xmath37 . for this component of the model , there are ten free parameters including four in the luminosity evolution ( @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 & @xmath41 ) , four in the density evolution ( @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 & @xmath45 ) and two slopes ( @xmath46 & @xmath47 ) .",

    "for the formula of the smbh energy fraction , we assume a bounded gaussian distribution for the logarithm of the smbh energy fraction in the total ir band @xmath50 , as motivated by works of @xcite : @xmath51 @xmath52 where the boundary of log@xmath53 is set to have the minimum and maximum at -6.0 and 0.0 , respectively ( for details , see   [ numerical_approach ] ) .",
    "this gaussian distribution is assumed to be redshift and luminosity dependent .",

    "the advantage of ulirgs compared to lower luminosity objects is that the smbh contributions are important so that the distribution of the smbh energy fraction can be derived to a high accuracy . for a sample of 74 ulirgs , we derived the smbh ir luminosity from the observed 6.2 @xmath15 m equivalent width and 6.0 @xmath15 m continuum luminosity as measured by @xcite : @xmath61\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath62 is the observed 6.2 @xmath15 m equivalent width",

    "note that the aromatic feature ew relies on the method to measure it , e.g. , sometimes the wing emission of the feature is included through extrapolating the analytic profile .",
    "as long as the same method is adopted , the smbh energy fraction from the above equation should not differ significantly .",
    "the @xmath66 is then corrected to the total smbh ir luminosity by a factor of 1.6 using our own smbh sed .",
    "combined with the measured total ir luminosity , the final distribution of the smbh energy fraction is shown in figure  [ ew_1jyulirgs ] .",

    "the fit with a gaussian gives log@xmath67=-1.21 .",
    "the median luminosity of this sample gives log@xmath68=12.3 .",
    "note that the above values do not depend significantly on the adopted @xmath69 since @xmath62 is small in the majority of the objects .",
    "however , we did not use the above distribution to fix @xmath70 but set it as a free parameter , because the width measured in figure  [ ew_1jyulirgs ] is broadened by the intrinsic scatter in @xmath71 and luminosity correction @xmath72 .",
    "we notice that the median fraction derived here is significantly lower than the energy fraction of roughly 35 - 40% as derived by @xcite .",
    "the main reason is that their numbers are given in the bolometric band while ours are integrated from 8 - 1000 @xmath15 m .",
    "while the emission is similar between these two bands for ulirgs , a factor of @xmath3 5 needs to be applied for the smbh radiation .",

    "such similar behaviors at both soft and hard bands imply that if the model is forced to replace compton - thick objects with compton - thin type-2 agn in one band , the result in the other band would not significantly violate the observation .",
    "however , at 24 @xmath15 m , the compton - thick contribution is noticeable over a flux range as large as four orders of magnitude , which is quite similar to that of the compton - thin type-2 agn .",
    "the relative ratio between the two populations is not a strong function of the flux density , with a value roughly around 1:3 .",
    "this means , if the model is forced to replace compton - thick agn with compton - thin agn at 24 @xmath15 m , the result in x - ray bands would significantly over - produce objects at the high flux end but under - produce at the faint flux end .",
    "this argument was verified by running a test model without a compton - thick agn population and the expected behavior was observed in the model output .      as shown in figure  [ lf_tir ] , the predicted total ir lfs are consistent with the observations over redshift and luminosity ranges where the data are available .",
    "for comparison , we converted the observed lfs at given filters to the total ir lfs using the reference variant .",
    "we first modelled the number density @xmath200(filter , @xmath2 , @xmath201 ) at the same filter , redshift bin ( @xmath202 ) and luminosity bin ( @xmath201@xmath203 ) as the observed ones ( @xmath204(filter , @xmath2 , @xmath201 ) ) .",
    "the @xmath201 is then corrected to the total ir luminosity with luminosity corrections based on the probability - weighted average of all model seds within @xmath202 and @xmath201@xmath203 .",
    "this @xmath200/@xmath205 is taken as the difference of the observed and modelled lfs in the total ir band .",
    "for the local lfs , the iras data offer the largest dynamical range and are thus the best dataset to test the validity of the model s lf .",
    "the 12 and 25 @xmath15 m lfs are used to fit the model and the result is discussed in   [ fit_result_local_lf ] .",
    "here we further compared our model to the total ir lf based on iras 60 @xmath15 m selected sources @xcite , and found a good match between the two ( figure  [ lf_tir ] ) .",
    "consistency is excellent with other works of significantly smaller fields that cover the whole ir / submm wavelength range . above @xmath2 @xmath1 0.1 up to @xmath2",
    "@xmath3 3 , current deep surveys are able to probe objects up to one order of magnitude below the break luminosity as shown in figure  [ lf_tir ] . at short wavelengths @xcite",
    ", no significant difference is found between the model and data up to @xmath2@xmath32.5 .",
    "some deviations at the faint end are most likely caused by incompleteness corrections particularly associated with 1/@xmath206 method @xcite . at rest - frame 250 @xmath15 m ,",
    "the model is consistent with that of @xcite but the result of @xcite is systematically higher at 0.1@xmath2070 .",
    "the total ir lf of @xcite is systematically above our modelled lf ; their work may over - estimate the total ir luminosity due to k - corrections ( also see * ? ? ?",
    "our model hypothesizes no evolution in either the faint or bright end slopes of the total ir lf . as shown in figure  [ lf_tir ] , the fixed bright end slope matches the available data up to @xmath2@xmath33 . for the faint end slope",
    ", we did not see deviations from the data up to @xmath2@xmath31 above that the available data are quite limited to justify . with fixed faint and bright end slopes ,",
    "the total ir lf as predicted by our model requires evolution in both luminosity and density .",
    "although the detail relies on the evolution formula adopted , we found in general that the break luminosity ( log@xmath208 ) increases with redshift but the break density ( log@xmath209 ) decreases with redshift .",
    "as shown in figure  [ irlf_par_evl ] , for the evolution formula given in equations [ eq_evl_lstar ] and [ eq_evl_denstar ] , the break luminosity increases rapidly until @xmath2=2 and then gradually reaches the peak at @xmath2=4 , while the break density shows a gradual increase until z=0.4 and then monotonically decreases with redshift . to test the redshift out to",
    "which luminosity or density evolution is required , we have carried out several test runs of the model by modifying the evolution formula to force no evolution above redshifts of z=0.5 , 1.0 , 1.5 , 2.0 , 2.5 & 3.0 . if adopting @xmath210/d.o.f=1 as an indicator of significant worse fit , we found that the no - evolution scenario can be ruled out below @xmath2 @xmath3 2.5 .",
    "above @xmath2@xmath33 , the fit result could not differentiate evolution vs. no evolution , which is not surprising since the current constraint on the @xmath2 @xmath1 @xmath211 infrared and x - ray populations is still of low statistical significance as shown in figure  [ red_dist ] . to evaluate the degeneracy between the luminosity and density evolution",
    ", we carried out test runs which halted density or luminosity evolution at selected redshifts .",
    "the result shows that the data are not able to break the degeneracy at @xmath2 @xmath97 1.5 , which is consistent with figure  [ lf_tir ] showing that above @xmath2 @xmath3 1.5 the observed lf does not extend significantly below the break luminosity .",
    "however , no matter which evolution formula is adopted , the robust result is that the break luminosity always increases with redshift , while the break density overall decreases with redshift .",
    "our result of the positive luminosity evolution is consistent with different literature studies while the negative trend in the density is not always favored .",
    "we note our result of negative density evolution is inconsistent with studies in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , but consistent with ones in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we have constructed a joint model of the x - ray and ir extragalactic background to account simultaneously for both x - ray and ir survey data .",
    "the main conclusions are the following :    \\(1 ) the model successfully fits the deep survey data with the scenario that individual galaxies are experiencing both star formation and smbh accretion activities .",
    "the model with 19 free parameters generates number counts , redshift distributions and local luminosity functions consistent with 617 data - points over six decades of electromagnetic frequencies .",
    "the best - reduced @xmath0 reaches 2.7 - 2.9 , with at least 0.75 contributed by cosmic variance , photo - z errors or limitations of the data sets .",
    "\\(2 ) the unique output of this model , compared to previous ones for either pure x - ray or ir data , is to constrain the smbh energy fraction in the total ir band .",
    "the best - fit requires the smbh energy fraction to increase with the ir luminosity but decrease with the redshift back to @xmath2@xmath31.5 .",
    "the derived trend is statistically significant as shown by the significantly increased best - fit @xmath0/d.o.f .",
    ", i.e. , @xmath155@xmath0/d.o.f @xmath1 1.0 , for best fits where the smbh fraction has either no luminosity or no redshift dependence .",
    "an independent test comparing the model s predictions to the observed aromatic feature equivalent width distributions agrees with this result .",
    "\\(3 ) the second important output of the model is the distribution of the hi column density obscuring the agn , especially the compton - thick fraction",
    ". a run of the model with no compton - thick agn shows an increase in the @xmath0/d.o.f . by @xmath31.0 .",
    "the best - fit parameters indicate that the compton - thick agn fraction decreases with the smbh luminosity but increases with the redshift , while the type-1 agn fraction has the inverse trend .",
    "\\(4 ) the third output is the total ir luminosity function .",
    "the best - fit parameters indicate that the break luminosity rises monotonically with redshift while the break density has an overall inverse trend .",
    "the above result is statistically important out to @xmath2 @xmath3 1.5 , above which the degeneracy between the two parameters can not be resolved with available data .",
