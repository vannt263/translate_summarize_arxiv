    "it was shown that quantum effects render the cooper pair pump inaccurate in case of arrays with small junctions thus explaining the failure to demonstrate accurate pumping in the first ( and so far the only ) reported experiment of pumping of cooper pairs.@xcite    in this article , using renormalisation methods , we generalise the results derived in ref . 4 for an unbiased array of josephson junctions with gate voltages when only cooper pair tunnelling and charging effects are taken into account .",
    "we consider the supercurrent , the higher order corrections for the pumping inaccuracy in case of homogeneous arrays , inhomogeneity of the array , and nonideal pumping sequences .",
    "using three experimentally motivated and determinable parameters we are able to derive an expression for the pumping inaccuracy which can be directly compared against experimental results .",
    "it should be stressed , though , that the model is simple and neglects many , possibly important features such as quasiparticle tunnelling , the coupling to the electromagnetic environment and the dissipative effects induced by a non - zero bias voltage . on the other hand , without these simplifications",
    "the problem could not be solved at the moment .",
    "the efficiency of the renormalisation methods in case of cooper pair pumps is explained by the considerable symmetries of the model hamiltonian .",

    "renormalisation methods may be applied most effectively in case of `` few - state dominant '' systems . in such systems some of basis states",
    "are separated from all the others by an energy @xmath5 which is large as compared to the coupling between any two states in the system .",
    "thus certain eigenstates of the full system can be approximated by the eigenstates of the `` few - state dominant '' part only .",

    "the eigenstates @xmath39 are not orthogonal in @xmath16-space because they correspond to different effective hamiltonians , but if they are reexpanded to the full space the orthogonality can be regained . however , the requirements for `` few - state dominance '' ensure that the important advantage of orthogonality can be used in exchange for only a small loss in accuracy . in the `` average '' choice renormalisation ,",
    "valid for `` few - state dominant '' systems , we use the average eigenenergy @xmath40 in place of individual eigenvalues .",
    "thus the evaluation the diagonal matrix elements @xmath41 suffices up until the final step of the iteration when @xmath32 has to be diagonalised .",

    "we refer to these cases as `` individual-0 '' and `` average-0 '' choices .",

    "the full problem is projected onto a smaller space while in diagonalisation the problem is truncated by discarding all basis states outside the restricted basis .",
