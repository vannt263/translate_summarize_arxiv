    "the largest difference occurs near 100mev , where our flux is about a factor of two larger than that of mori .",

    "when simultaneously fitting radio , x - ray and gamma - ray observations of supernova remnants , the degeneracy of certain fit parameters (  [ sec : sync ] ) and the variety of emission mechanisms in the gamma - ray band may make it difficult to determine a unique set of fit parameters unless additional constraints are available .    based on reasonably general principles , a number of constraints can sometimes be imposed .",
    "for example :    1 .   when the magnetic field associated with the synchrotron emission is generated primarily by cosmic - ray streaming @xcite , the energy density in cosmic - rays should set an upper limit on the magnetic energy density .",
    "the corresponding upper limit on the magnetic field strength is @xmath311 where @xmath312 and @xmath313 are the energy density in cosmic - ray electrons and protons respectively .",

    "the most important difference is that the normalization derived using srcut  overestimates the radio flux at 1ghz by an amount dependent upon the spectral index as shown in figure [ fig : srcut ] .",
    "the spectral index from srcut  tends to be a few percent too steep and the break frequency tends to be a few percent too low but , in practice , such differences may be detectable only with very high quality data .",
