    "the conventional on - shell mass renormalization prescription has been present for a long time .",
    "it renormalizes the real part of particle s inverse propagator to zero at physical mass point . for boson",
    "the on - shell mass renormalization condition is @xcite m^2-m_0 ^ 2+re(m^2)=0 , where @xmath0 is the bare mass and @xmath1 is the boson s diagonal self energy ( for vector boson it is the transverse diagonal self energy ) . but recently people proposed a new mass renormalization prescription which renormalizes both the real and the imaginary parts of the particle s inverse propagator to zero at the ( complex ) pole of the particle s propagator , i.e. @xcite |s - m_0 ^ 2+(|s)=0 , where @xmath2 is the pole of the particle s propagator . written @xmath3 , @xmath4 is defined as the physical mass of the particle @xcite . putting the expression of @xmath2 into eq.(2 ) one has @xcite m_2 ^",
    "2-m_0 ^ 2+re(|s)=0 , m_2_2=im(|s ) . by expanding eqs.(3 ) at @xmath5 one",
    "readily has ( see eq.(1 ) ) @xcite m - m_2=_2im^(m_2 ^ 2)/2+o(g^6 ) , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 is a generic coupling constant . for unstable boson the r.h.s . of eq.(4",
    ") is gauge dependent @xcite .",
    "so a. sirlin et al .",
    "claim that the on - shell mass definition @xmath8 of unstable particles is gauge dependent , since the pole mass definition @xmath4 is gauge independent @xcite .",
    "but the conclusion that the pole mass definition @xmath4 is gauge independent has been proposed for not very long time . we still need to search new and stricter proofs to prove this conclusion . in this paper",
    "we will discuss if the pole mass definition is gauge independent and investigate the difference of physical result between the on - shell and pole mass renormalization prescriptions .",
    "the arrangement of this paper is as follows : firstly we discuss the gauge dependencies of the counterterms of gauge boson w and z s mass and the sine of the weak mixing angle under the on - shell and pole mass renormalization prescriptions ; then we discuss the gauge dependence of the two - loop - level cross section of the physical process @xmath9 under the two mass renormalization prescriptions ; lastly we give the conclusion .",
    "the gauge invariance of lagrangian always requires the bare physical parameters are gauge independent .",
    "the natural deduction of this conclusion is the counterterms of physical parameters should also be gauge independent @xcite , since the bare physical parameter can be divided into physical parameter and the corresponding counterterm , and the physical parameter is of course gauge independent .",
    "this criterion could be used to judge which mass renormalization prescription is reasonable , in other words which mass definition is gauge independent . in the following",
    "we will discuss the gauge dependence of the counterterms of gauge boson w and z s mass and the sine of the weak mixing angle under the on - shell and pole mass renormalization prescriptions .",
    "for convenience we only discuss the dependence of w gauge parameter @xmath10 in the @xmath11 gauge , and we only introduce physical parameter s counterterms ( i.e. we do nt introduce field renormalization constants ) .",
    "the computer program packages _ feynarts _ and _ feyncalc _ @xcite have been used in the following calculations . here",
    "we note there are some early two - loop - level calculations about the massive gauge boson s self energies in ref.@xcite .    from eqs.(1,3 )",
    "one has for massive gauge boson @xcite m^2&=&re^t(m^2 ) , + m_2 ^ 2&=&re^t(m_2 ^ 2)+m_2_2im^t(m_2 ^ 2)+o(g^6 ) , where @xmath12 denotes the transverse self energy of the gauge boson .",
    "the one - loop - level mass counterterms of w and z have been proven gauge independent @xcite .",
    "so we only need to discuss the two - loop - level case .",
    "firstly @xmath8 and @xmath4 should be regarded as equal quantities , since both of them are regarded as the physical mass of the same particle .",
    "therefore we find the two - loop - level difference of the two mass counterterm is @xmath13 .",
    "every part of this term contains gauge - parameter - dependent heaviside functions ( which come from the one - loop - level @xmath14 @xcite ) .",
    "so in order to discuss the difference of the gauge dependence of the two mass counterterms we only need to calculate the gauge dependence of the singularities of the two - loop - level @xmath15 , because only the singularities of @xmath15 in @xmath15 contain heaviside functions . in other words for our purpose we only need to discuss the gauge dependence of the part which contains heaviside functions of the two mass counterterms .",
    "the two - loop - level self energies can be classified into two kinds : one kind contains one - loop - level counterterms , the other kind does nt contain any counterterm . since except for ckm matrix elements",
    "@xcite all of the one - loop - level counterterms of physical parameters are real numbers and do nt contain heaviside function @xcite , the first kind self energy does nt contribute to the singularities of the real part of the self energy , because except the one - loop - level counterterm the left part of this kind self energy is an one - loop - level self energy which real part does nt contain singularities .",
    "here we do nt need to worry about the problem that the ckm matrix elements and their counterterms are complex numbers , because the total contribution of them to the real part of the gauge boson s self energy is real number ( the correctness of this conclusion can be see from the following calculations ) .",
    "so we only need to calculate the contributions of the second kind self energy .    according to the _ cutting rules",
    "_ @xcite the second kind self energy can be classified into three kinds : one kind does nt contain singularity , the second kind contains singularities , but its singularities do nt contribute to the real part of the self energy , the third kind contains singularities and its singularities contribute to the real part of the self energy .",
    "the topologies of the three kind self energies are shown in fig.1 , fig.2 and fig.3 .",
    "+     +     +    here we note the middle propagator ( denoted by broken line ) in the one - particle - reducible diagrams of fig.(1 - 3 ) is different from the external - line particles .",
    "the tadpole diagrams are also included in fig.(1 - 3 ) , because we do nt introduce the tadpole counterterm @xcite .",
    "obviously we only need to calculate the contribution of the singularities of fig.3 to the real part of the gauge boson s self energy .",
    "in fig.3 we also draw the possible cuts / singularities of the first four topologies which contribute to the real part of the gauge boson s self energy ( the arrow on the inner line denotes the corresponding propagator is cut @xcite ) .",
    "the possible cuts of the left two topologies which contribute to the real part of the gauge boson s self energy are shown in fig.4 and fig.5 .",
    "+     +      in the standard model of particle physics the first topology of fig.3 does nt contribute to w transverse self energy , so we do nt need to calculate its contribution . for the second topology of fig.3",
    "there are 39 feynman diagrams in the standard model , but none of them satisfies the corresponding cutting condition .",
    "the case of the third topology of fig.3 is same as the case of the second topology .",
    "for the 4th topology of fig.3 there are two w self energy diagrams as shown in fig.6 which satisfy the corresponding cutting condition .     +    using the cutting rules we obtain the gauge - parameter - dependent contribution of the cuts of fig.6 to the real part of w transverse self energy : re^t_ww(m_w^2)|__w - cut=(1-_w)^3 ( _ w^5 - 3_w^4 - 6_w^3 - 46_w^2 + 165_w+465 ) , where @xmath16 is w transverse self energy , @xmath17 and @xmath10 is w s mass and gauge parameter , @xmath18 is the fine structure constant , @xmath19 is the heaviside function , and the subscript @xmath20 denotes the @xmath10-dependent contribution from the cuts / singularities . in the follows we restrict ourselves to @xmath21 @xcite .",

    "so we will judge the reasonableness of the two renormalization prescriptions from the gauge independence of physical result .",
    "for example we calculate the gauge dependence of the two - loop - level cross section of the physical process @xmath29 under the two mass renormalization prescriptions .",

    "this will not affect our conclusion .",
    "under this consideration only the diagrams containing the two - loop - level counterterms @xmath28 and @xmath33 as shown in fig.14 need to be calculated .",
    "+    this is because : 1 ) all of the one - loop - level physical parameter s counterterms and the two - loop - level counterterms of the lepton masses and electron charge do nt contain the heaviside functions @xmath30 $ ] , @xmath31 $ ] and @xmath32 $ ] ; 2 ) the energy of the incoming particle of this process is order of muon energy which does nt reach the threshold of the singularities containing the heaviside functions @xmath30 $ ] , @xmath31 $ ] and @xmath32 $ ] , thus all of loop momentum integrals of the feynman diagrams do nt contribute to these heaviside functions .",
    "we can easily get the contribution of fig.14 to the physical amplitude @xmath34 ( _ e^-|_e ) & & s_w+ + & & m_e m_(2m_w^2-m_e^2 - 2 q_2q_3)f_1-m_w^4 f_2 , where @xmath35 and @xmath36 is the mass of electron and muon , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the momentums of electron and the anti electron neutrino , and f_1=|u(q_1)_r u(p)|u(q_2)_l(q_3 ) , f_2=|u(q_1)^_l u(p ) |u(q_2)__l(q_3 ) , where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the momentums of muon and muon neutrino , and @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the left- and right- handed helicity operators .",

    "eq.(30 ) implies the on - shell mass renormalization prescription makes the cross section of the physical process @xmath9 gauge dependent .",
