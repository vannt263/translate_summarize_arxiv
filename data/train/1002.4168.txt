    "numerical relativity has reached high sophistication levels to advance in the study of realistic solutions to the einstein equations .",
    "particularly , to simulate gravitational radiation from collapsing sources @xcite and binary black hole mergers @xcite .",
    "almost all the investigations have been done in the adm @xmath0 formulation @xcite , although the characteristic formulation offers a myriad of valuable advantages @xcite .",
    "this work is motivated by the possibility of simulating gravitational radiation from axisymmetric matter sources , as part of a longer project @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we met that purpose beginning with the most simplified and concomitant problem under spherical symmetry , that is , the self  gravitating massless scalar field . in the same vein we deal with the problem of matter coupled to radiation which eventually will lead us to get gravitational signals from bounded sources .",
    "as far as we can see , this problem stands alone as an important one in the field . here",
    "we report a study in the aforementioned direction , limiting ourselves to spherical symmetry to follow the evolution of a massless scalar field interacting with a perfect fluid distribution of matter .",
    "this model problem offers a number of advantageous computational and geometrical features .",
    "it is well known that the scalar field mimics gravitational radiation and it has been used to study the global properties of the spacetime , black hole threshold and radiative signals @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .    the framework for computing a complete spacetime within the characteristic approach has been laid out by tamburino and winicour @xcite and explicitly in @xcite , where is explored the production of gravitational waves for axially symmetric distribution of matter ( for a complete review see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "some years later , fundamental studies in 1d and 3d @xcite , @xcite , @xcite were followed by a 3d code able to treat matter by bishop et al .",
    "@xcite . a relatively simpler system is a spherically symmetric distribution of a perfect fluid coupled with scalar radiation @xcite . for other symmetries other than spherical",
    ", the mathematical problem has a very similar structure @xcite . in these contexts",
    "we can take full advantage of the characteristic approach to treat matter and radiation .",
    "the first example of the use of characteristic numerical relativity for the study of dynamical neutron star spacetime , collapse and radiative signals was reported in @xcite .",
    "few investigations consider the scalar field interaction with fluid stellar distributions @xcite ,",
    "@xcite .    we have recently discovered an unexpected unity in the treatment of matter in numerical relativity @xcite , using explicit bondian observers @xcite .",
    "these observers offer an eulerian ( noncomoving ) description ( global ) with the spirit of lagrangian observers ( local and comoving ) . following this line",
    "also we reported a disclosure of a central equation of state ( ceos ) , which is unique for all evolutions ; it emerges as a conserved quantity from the field equations @xcite .",
    "authors commonly refer to the scalar field as a model of matter distribution that simplifies the treatment of the hydrodynamic issues .",
    "this approach has been useful to study non linear physics and asymptotic behaviors , especially for central regions @xcite .",
    "scalar field models have been extended to realistic situations such as gravitational radiation @xcite .",
    "however , cases where the scalar field is coupled with radiation require a different approach due to both the confinement effect of matter and the dispersive nature of radiation .",
    "when a scalar field is coupled to matter it can be easily interpreted as an anisotropic fluid if we use bondian frames explicitly .",
    "we develop a numerical framework to deal with matter coupled to scalar radiation .",
    "we perform a detailed study of the central world line at @xmath1 , leading to a conformally flat spacetime in that region .",
    "we assume that the radial dependence of the geometrical and physical variables keep the same dependence as the static variables near the coordinate  origin .",
    "we formulate in this work the characteristic evolution in terms of bondian observers @xcite .",
    "the eulerian formulations of numerical relativity @xcite , @xcite actually use bondian observers in the mathematical treatment of matter .",
    "we also match the interior solution with the exterior one in a clear and precise treatment of the boundary distribution of matter without the use of artificial atmosphere .",
    "infinity is treated as usual in literature .    in what follows",
    "we write the field equations for bondian observers when matter is coupled to scalar radiation , which makes the fluid manifestly anisotropic .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the regularization and matching . in section 4",
    "we show how the scheme works by means of numerical test models .",
    "finally we summarize with some remarks in section 5 .",

    "it clearly connects the surface with the center of the distribution by means of @xmath113 .",
    "in this model , a polytrope with a vacuum schwarzschild exterior as a background , the scalar field is scattered off and radiated to infinity .",
    "figure [ fig : poly_cons ] shows the energy conservation in this case .",
    "it should be stressed here that the scalar field gradient of the initial datum has to be zero at @xmath91 and the scalar field itself partially immersed in the distribution .      for a schwarzschild ",
    "schwarzschild background an expected feature is showed when an initial compact support scalar field ( b ) is evolved . in this case",

    "the old point of view of bondian observers are mistakenly considered as eulerian in numerical relativity for the mathematical treatment of matter @xcite .",
    "although we only explored toy models , we believe they deserve future attention at least as initial conditions . the partially immersed scalar field in the fluid is hidden .",
    "this mixture constitutes a fixed and well behaved background to evolve a cloned scalar field .",
    "the face value of model a is its usefulness as a playground to study asymptotic and matching regions .",
    "it is striking how the matching leads us to a connection between the mass distribution and the amplitude of the initial scalar field , and how the limit mass of @xmath94 does not depend apparently upon the initial data . the energy conservation and the newman ",
    "penrose constant tests give confidence on the possible physical consequences of this simple model .",
    "the other two models represent simple tests which are in agreement with expectations .",
    "we stress that this paper does not develop a general code , it just reports how bondian observers are plausible in numerical relativity .",
    "numerics is simplified to show how these observers are consistent with previous results .",
    "the underlaying problem , gravitational radiation coupled to matter , is in fact difficult .",
    "we show that even in the spherical case we have to consider special regions , center and boundary surface carefully as well .",
    "we are currently developing a general code based on section 3 , which considers regularization and matching regions in a clearer manner .",
    "the most simple axisymmetric case from the bondian point of view is out of scope of the present investigation .",
    "there is a unique geometrical way to define bondian observers in the absence of spherical symmetry : i ) choose a tetrad to get the local minkowskian frame ; ii ) make a double lorentz boost to go to the frame comoving with the fluid . in this sense",
    "could be interesting to revise results from @xcite to consider gravitational radiation considering explicitly bondian frames and regularization on special regions such as the axis of symmetry and boundary surface .",
    "an advanced study of incompressible  like fluids and polytropic matter indicates the relevance of central equation of state at the center of the star .",
    "this motivated us to prepare a hydrodynamic solver which will be reported elsewhere for an adiabatic situation .",
    "a more general study of matter coupled to radiation within this framework is in progress .",
