    "f. wong @xcite was the first to perform detailed studies : within the pure ldm he showed that for a fissibility parameter @xmath5 spherical nuclear bubbles have a lower energy than compact spherical nuclei but are not stable against fission .",

    "@xcite investigated the effect of an ideal dilute classical gas of nucleons at finite temperature inside the bubble and claimed that the pressure exerted by this gas on the layer of nuclear matter could stabilize spherical bubbles against deformation . as the authors pointed out , this mechanism may also be of relevance for the existence of  mesoscopic bubbles  .    in what follows",
    "we investigate the effects of the shell structure for spherical bubbles in a large range of neutron ( @xmath1 ) and proton ( @xmath2 ) numbers considerably extending them beyond the known nuclear species .",
    "the present paper is an extension of our study presented in ref .",
    "we use phenomenological shell model potentials and apply the strutinsky method to evaluate the shell correction energy @xmath8 .",
    "the motivation of this work is to find the magic neutron and proton numbers and to obtain an estimate of the magnitude of the shell energy .",
    "this simple approach is expected to be sufficiently realistic to establish the importance of shell effects in nuclear bubbles and to lead to a  first assessment of the stability of such systems .    surely , a  reliable investigation of the existence of nuclear bubbles with an appreciable life - time versus fission and other decay channels requires careful and technically difficult hartree - fock ( hf ) or hartree - bogoliubov ( hb ) calculations .",

    "the spin - orbit potential for a bubble nucleus is smaller than for an ordinary compact nucleus because the contributions arising from the inner and outer surface have a  different sign .",

    "this simple assumption turned out to be empirically very successful for the nilsson potential .",

    "the effect of a finite potential @xmath62 in the interior region @xmath41 is qualitatively the same for the two potentials ( 2.11 ) and ( 2.12 ) .",

    "the details of this procedure are presented in appendix a3 .",
    "we still have to state how the  shape parameters  of the shell model potentials are to be chosen : since we use the strutinsky method representing the total binding energy of the nucleus as a sum of the liquid drop ( ld ) energy @xmath65 and the shell correction energy @xmath66 , the shape parameters of the shell model potential must be chosen in accordance with the ones of the liquid drop . when calculating the energy as a function of the nuclear shape , the multipole moments ( of low order ) calculated with the shell - model wavefunction must agree with the ones calculated with the ld - density . for the case of spherical bubble nuclei , the ms deviation from the central sphere of radius @xmath67 must be the same when calculated with the shell - model wave function and with the ld - density @xmath68 where @xmath69 we restrict our consideration to bubble nuclei with a negligible nuclear density inside of the smaller radius @xmath10 of the ld - distribution .",

    "we also studied the effects of a  finite negative constant potential in the interior region for the case of the square well .",

    "a  nice feature of the shifted infinite square well is that its eigenvalues scale with @xmath204 .",
    "we have used the unit @xmath205 mev . consequently , from the spectrum given in fig .",
    "7 one can infer the eigenvalues for arbitrary nucleon number @xmath4 .",

    "apart from @xmath209 the angular momentum @xmath20 is represented by the letters in alphabetical order ( @xmath210 .",
    "the following physical features of the spectrum should be noted : for @xmath211 , the single particle energies @xmath212 decrease as a  function of @xmath184 , for @xmath213 , they increase as a  function of @xmath184 with a  steepness which becomes drastically larger with @xmath58 . the dependence on @xmath58",
    "is produced by the requirement of a vanishing wavefunction at the limits of the well .",
    "as @xmath184 increases , the diameter @xmath214 diminishes and , consequently , the energy difference between successive radial modes increases .",
    "the strong dependence of the difference between successive eigenvalues of the same orbital angular momentum @xmath20 but different radial modes can be understood in the following simple approximation : if we replace the centrifugal term @xmath215 in the radial schrdinger equation by its value at the center @xmath216 of the bubble layer , the eigenfunctions @xmath217 become trigonometric functions which are either  even  or ",
    "odd  with respect to the reflection @xmath218 . in this approximation",
    "the eigenenergies have the form @xmath219 @xmath220 one can easily check that this relation explains qualitatively the behaviour of the eigenvalues as a  function of the hole fraction @xmath184 .",

    "let us stress that the approximation ( 3.15 ) is crude and can not replace the determination of the true unperturbed eigenvalues by a  numerical solution of the eqs .",
    "( 2.7 ) .    in fig .",
    "7 we plotted the energy levels including the spin - orbit interaction @xmath225 an unusual feature is that the levels with @xmath226 lie below the levels with @xmath227 .",
    "furthermore , the spin - orbit splitting , i.e. the energy difference @xmath228 is much smaller than in the case of ordinary nuclei with the same @xmath20 .",
    "the reason for both these phenomena is difference of the density distributions : since the spin - orbit term depends on the gradient of the density ( see eq .",
    "( 2.29),(2.30 ) ) , its main contribution originates from the nuclear surface .",
    "the outer surface contributes with the same sign , but the inner with the opposite sign as compared to ordinary nuclei . for spherical bubble nuclei the spin - orbit potential",
    "can be written in the form ( 2.31 ) .",
    "the factor @xmath229 in the expression weighs the inner surface more than the outer one so that the sign change becomes understandable .",
    "the infinite square well model is , of course , not realistic especially for bubble nuclei with a  small value of @xmath184 . in the case of bubbles with a  small hole fraction , we can not expect the hole to be empty .",
    "it will rather be filled with a  reduced nucleon density and thus the change at the inner surface from the density in the layer to the reduced density in the hole region will be much smoother than in the case of the infinite square well . in this case , the contribution of the outer surface may become more important than the one of the inner surface in spite of the weight factor @xmath229 and thus the usual order of spin - orbit splitting ensues .    in the fig .",
    "8 we show the level scheme as a  function of the parameter @xmath184 for the shifted oscillator . the oscillator is more suitable than the infinite square well ( i ) for small @xmath184-values , where the inner region is expected to contain a reduced density of nucleons , and ( ii ) for bubbles with a  thin layer , i.e. with a  diameter @xmath230 which becomes smaller than about 4  fm . as one can infer from ( 3.16.1 ) this happens for large values of @xmath184 and at the same time not too large values of @xmath4 .",

    "contrary to the case of the infinite square well , there are also cases of  normal  order of the spin - orbit splitting ( see for instance the pairs @xmath232 and @xmath233 ) for the harmonic oscillator potential .    the following general trends can be stated :    * for increasing hole fraction @xmath184 , the contributions of the inner and outer surface region to the total spin - orbit term tend to become more equal .",
    "since the two regions contribute with opposite sign , the spin - orbit splitting tends to decrease with increasing @xmath184 .",
    "this is seen in fig . 7 and 8 , i.e. for both the potentials . *",
    "the centrifugal potential has the tendency of shifting the single particle density to larger values of @xmath184 . for given hole fraction @xmath184 , this effect increases with @xmath20 and for given @xmath20 , the effect decreases with @xmath184 .",
    "this shift of the s.p .",

    "in fact one can observe in fig .",
    "8 that for large enough @xmath20 and small @xmath184 the  normal  spin - orbit splitting prevails . the effect is more pronounced for the oscillator than for the square - well .    in fig . 9 and fig .",

    ":    * the density distribution extends from the inner surface down to @xmath236 contrary to the case of the infinite square well of fig .",
    "consequently , the weight of the inner contribution to the spin - orbit splitting increases as compared to the infinite square well .",
    "this is seen by the fact that the splitting in the unusual order tends to be larger in fig . 9 and 10 as compared to fig",
    ". 7 . * for energies far below the step ,",
    "the results are very similar to the ones of the infinite square well . * for energies above the step , the changes are of course very large the general tendency being a  compression of the spectrum at energies above the step .",

    ", the maximal shell effect is expected to occur at a different value of the hole parameter @xmath184 .",
    "furthermore , the approximate effect of the rotation is to increase the total energy by the rotational energy of a rigidly rotating bubble .",

    "we have not yet taken into account pairing in bubble nuclei . for nuclei away from shell  closures we expect the pairing energy to be generally larger than for ordinary nuclei , because the density of levels in the vicinity of the fermi energy is larger due to the high degeneracy of single particle states of large angular momentum .",
    "the pairing energy matters only if at least one sort of nucleons forms a closed shell , because otherwise bubble configurations are unstable .",
