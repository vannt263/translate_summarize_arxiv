    "the atlas and cms experiments at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) have reported the discovery of a new boson compatible with the standard model ( sm ) higgs in july 2012 @xcite , and updated results of the measurements of the higgs couplings with more precision have been recently released @xcite and @xcite .",
    "all the results are compatible with the predictions for a sm higgs boson with a mass of about 126 gev .",
    "this discovery is especially important in the context of new physics models , and in particular supersymmetry ( susy ) , where the higgs mass and decay rates can be related to the susy parameters .    in this paper , we consider specific scenarios in which anomaly mediation supersymmetry breaking mechanisms are assumed . in particular , we discuss the implications of @xmath2 physics data , lhc higgs measurements and cold dark matter relic abundance .",
    "we discuss different possibilities , such as minimal anomaly mediation ( mamsb ) @xcite , hypercharged anomaly mediation ( hc - amsb ) @xcite and mixed moduli - anomaly mediation ( mm - amsb ) @xcite .",
    "anomaly mediation models in relation with dark matter and cosmology were also discussed in @xcite .",
    "anomaly mediation supersymmetry breaking ( amsb ) models are based on the fact that the conformal anomaly gives a general and model independent contribution to gaugino masses which is always present and which can be the dominant contribution when there is no direct tree level coupling which transfers the susy breaking from the hidden sector to the observable sector .",
    "this contrasts with the msugra mechanism which is based on the existence of specific tree - level terms .",
    "these models are theoretically very appealing as based on existing forces ( gravity ) and on well motivated string theory ideas .",
    "a well - known problem however in the amsb scenario is the presence of tachyonic sleptons .",
    "this problem can be solved assuming the presence of an intermediate threshold scale .",
    "different supersymmetry breaking scenarios can be obtained starting from this framework , such as mamsb , hc - amsb and mm - amsb , which we briefly review in the following .",
    "it is quite remarkable that present data from different sectors and in particular the recent lhc results for the higgs boson are able to partially constrain the parameter space of these models .",
    "we discuss in the following the implications of such data and the interplay with other constraints coming principally from @xmath2-physics and dark matter relic abundance .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in section [ sec : models ] we discuss briefly the theoretical framework of the different anomaly mediated supersymmetry breaking set - ups . in section [ sec : constraints ] the implications of the flavour physics and relic density constraints are presented , as well as the higgs mass constraints and the possibilities to obtain branching ratios for the light cp - even higgs in agreement with the present results at the lhc for the parameter spaces of the different amsb models .",
    "conclusions are given in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the minimal amsb ( mamsb ) scenario can be described both from a higher - dimensional spacetime point of view @xcite , where the susy breaking occurs on a separate brane and is communicated to the visible sector via super - weyl anomaly , or from a four dimensional perspective @xcite , where a model - independent contribution to the gaugino mass is obtained from the conformal anomaly . in models without singlets",
    "this mechanism is the dominant one in the gaugino mass .",
    "the soft susy breaking terms can be calculated in terms of a single parameter , the gravitino mass @xmath3 .",
    "nonetheless , as an attempt to avoid the tachyonic slepton problem , it is assumed that the scalar particles have a universal mass @xmath4 at the gut scale , which leads to positive amsb soft susy breaking terms .",
    "the mamsb model possesses only four parameters : @xmath5 the soft susy breaking gaugino mass terms are related to @xmath3 by @xcite : @xmath6 where @xmath7 , @xmath8 are the coupling constants and @xmath9 the corresponding @xmath10 functions . the soft susy breaking sfermion mass terms and fermion trilinear couplings are given by : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the @xmath10 function corresponding to the yukawa coupling @xmath13 and @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the wave function renormalisation constant .      a substitute approach to solve",
    "the tachyonic lepton problem is the hypercharge anomaly mediated supersymmetry breaking ( hc - amsb ) scenario @xcite . in this model , the mssm",
    "is bound to a d - brane and a geometrically separated hidden sector generates a hypercharge gaugino mass @xcite .",
    "therefore , the tachyon problem can be solved by an increase in the slepton masses which results from an additional contribution to the gaugino mass @xmath16 .",
    "we parametrise the hc - amsb symmetry breaking using a dimensionless quantity @xmath17 which determines the hypercharge contribution relative to the soft bino mass term in amsb .",
    "the hc - amsb scenario has also four parameters : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the additional hypercharge contribution to @xmath16 .",
    "the anomaly mediation and hypercharge mediation have a common theoretical set - up , and the two types of mediation are able to compensate the phenomenological shortcomings of each other , giving rise to a realistic and well motivated model .",
    "indeed the minimal amsb model predicts a negative mass squared for the sleptons ( and prefers heavy squarks ) while the pure hypercharge mediation suffers from negative squared masses for stops and sbottoms ( and prefers heavy sleptons ) .",
    "combining the hypercharge and anomaly mediation set - ups gives rise to a phenomenologically viable spectra in a sizeable range of the parameter space of the model .    in the hc - amsb model ,",
    "the soft susy breaking terms are identical to the amsb ones , apart from the bino and fermion mass terms @xcite : @xmath20    at the two loop level , the other gaugino masses , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , receive a contribution from the bino mass term  @xcite .",
    "the mixed modulus anomaly mediated susy breaking ( mm - amsb ) scenario @xcite can be used as a third possibility to solve the tachyon problem .",
    "it is based on type - iib superstrings with stabilised moduli @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the moduli fields which describe the extra dimensions and the weyl anomaly have comparable contributions to the susy breaking in the observable sector .",
    "the spatial extra dimensions are compactified with flux which brings to a minimum in the potential of moduli and represents a starting point to find the fundamental state which leads to mssm at low energy @xcite .",
    "the soft susy breaking terms receive contributions of comparable magnitude from both anomaly and modulus , which can increase the slepton masses and solve the tachyon problem .",
    "the mm - amsb scenario has four parameters : @xmath23 where @xmath17 parametrises the relative contributions of modulus mediation and anomaly mediation to the soft breaking terms .",
    "a large @xmath17 corresponds to a mediation from the moduli , and a small @xmath17 to a mediation from the anomaly . indeed in the limit where @xmath24 0 , we obtain pure amsb soft susy breaking terms with a negative squared mass for the sleptons . for intermediate values of @xmath17 which are more interesting for our studies , the problem of tachyonic sleptons is absent @xcite .",
    "the mass scale of supersymmetry breaking parameters is given by the gravitino mass @xmath3 .",
    "the soft susy parameters are given by @xcite @xmath25 with @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the quadratic casimir and coupling of the @xmath29 gauge group corresponding to the sfermion .",
    "in order to study the different amsb scenarios , we used isajet 7.82 @xcite to generate the susy spectra , compute the flavour observables and relic density with superiso relic v3.2 @xcite , and we calculate the higgs branching fractions and decay widths with hdecay 5.11 @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we disregard the case of negative @xmath30 since it is disfavoured by the muon anomalous magnetic moment constraint , when assuming that supersymmetric contributions fill the gap between the measurements and the sm predictions ( typically squarks are assumed heavy to explain the higgs boson mass and lhc bounds , while sleptons , neutralinos and charginos may be light to be consistent with the @xmath31 muon results , see @xcite for a recent analysis ) .",
    "also , we impose the condition on the susy breaking scale @xmath32 tev as a typical scale to limit fine - tuning .",
    "it is well known that flavour physics observables provide important indirect constraints on the mssm as they are sensitive to the susy parameters through virtual corrections .",
    "similar considerations apply also in the case of the models under study .",
    "we first consider the inclusive branching ratio of @xmath33 .",
    "this decay has been thoroughly studied in the literature as its sm contributions only appear at loop level .",
    "the theoretical uncertainties as well as the experimental errors are also very well under control .",
    "the @xmath33 branching ratio is particularly constraining in the large @xmath34 region where it receives large corrections from the susy loops .",
    "we use the following interval at 95% c.l .",
    ": @xmath35 which is obtained using the latest experimental world average from heavy flavor averaging group ( hfag ) of @xmath36 @xcite , after taking into account the theoretical and experimental errors @xcite .",
    "another important observable in constraining susy parameters is the branching ratio of @xmath37 , which is also a loop level observable and suffers from helicity suppression in the sm . in susy",
    "it can receive extremely large enhancements by several orders of magnitude at large @xmath34 .",
    "the first evidence for this decay has been reported by the lhcb collaboration very recently @xcite .",
    "we use the following 95% c.l .",
    "interval which includes 10% theoretical error  @xcite : @xmath38 where untag denotes the untagged branching fraction , which can be derived from the cp - averaged branching fraction and directly compared to the experimental measurement @xcite .",
    "the purely leptonic decay of @xmath39 on the other hand is sensitive to supersymmetry through the exchange of a charged higgs boson already at tree level , which does not suffer from the helicity suppression of the sm contribution with the exchange of a @xmath40 boson",
    ". this decay can therefore provide stringent constraints .",
    "the combination of the most recent belle and babar results gives @xmath41 @xcite which , including the theoretical errors , leads to the following allowed interval : @xmath42 we used @xmath43 mev @xcite and @xmath44 @xcite for the calculation of this branching ratio .",
    "other flavour observables could be added to this list , however we have just included the most stringent ones for this analysis .",
    "a more complete analysis including all flavour information requires in principle a global fit to all observables , similar to the ones performed to test the standard model .",
    "this however goes beyond the scope of this preliminary screening of the extensions of amsb models discussed here .",
    "the wmap data @xcite provide precise observations of the cold dark matter density in the universe .",
    "we use them to impose constraints on the amsb parameter spaces by computing the relic density with superiso relic .",
    "we consider the wmap interval at 95% c.l .",
    "increased by 10% of theoretical error @xcite to account for the uncertainties in the calculation of the relic density : @xmath45    however the relic density constraint can be falsified in alternative cosmological model @xcite or if dark matter is composed by more than one species ( with _ e.g _ moduli @xcite , axions or axinos @xcite ) and we therefore also consider a loose interval : @xmath46 in which we relaxed the lower bound .",
    "in addition to these bounds , we impose the neutralino to be the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) to avoid the cosmological problems related to charged or not - so - weakly - interacting relics .",
    "the discovery of a higgs - like particle at the lhc provides important information on the mssm  @xcite . in the following , we associate the newly discovered boson to the lightest cp - even higgs  @xmath47 .",
    "the higgs mass value close to 126 gev brings constraints on the parameter space of supersymmetric models which enter the radiative corrections .",
    "the leading part of these corrections arises from the top / stop loops : @xmath48 \\ ; , \\;\\ ; \\;\\;\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 and @xmath50 is the stop mixing parameter .",
    "this correction is maximised for @xmath51 , which is referred to as  maximal mixing \" scenario , and minimised for @xmath52 in the  minimal mixing \" scenario .",
    "the  typical mixing \" scenario corresponds to the intermediate values of @xmath53 .    in the figures ,",
    "the constraint on the higgs boson mass will be taken at the two sigma level , @xmath54 gev .",
    "the extra information provided by the measurements of higgs branching ratios , provides extra useful constraints .",
    ".experimental average for the higgs mass and rates  @xcite .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      as we already showed in @xcite , the mm - amsb has the advantage of providing solutions consistent with the tight relic density constraint .",
    "we confront here this model to the latest higgs constraints . to study this scenario ,",
    "we vary the parameters in the following ranges : @xmath55\\\\ & & m_{3/2 } \\in [ 0,500]\\;{\\rm tev}\\nonumber\\\\   & & \\tan\\beta \\in [ 1,55]\\;,\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using flat scans generating more than 1 million points .    in fig .",
    "[ mh0_mmamsb ] , we plot the light higgs mass as functions of @xmath34 and @xmath56 . as for the hc - amsb scenario , the higgs mass can reach 126 gev , in a region corresponding to typical and maximal mixing regimes in the stop sector . in this scenario ,",
    "both the sfermion masses and trilinear couplings are modified by the modulus mediation .",
    "we note that imposing the lower bound of the relic density constraint makes apparent two distinct regions of compatibility : a large one with @xmath57 and @xmath58 corresponding to a typical mixing , and a narrow strip around @xmath59 and @xmath60 corresponding to a maximal mixing . in fig .",
    "[ tanb_mmamsb ] we consider the effects of the constraints in the @xmath61 and @xmath62 parameter planes .",
    "we see clearly the difference between the two regions highlighted in fig .",
    "[ mh0_mmamsb ] : the low @xmath34 region has positive values of @xmath17 typically around 6 , while the @xmath59 strip corresponds to negative @xmath17 and small @xmath3 . in terms of physical spectra , in both scenarios the neutralino is relatively heavy ( @xmath63 gev ) .",
    "the negative @xmath17 region corresponds to higgs resonances , with a bino - like neutralino 1 mass approximately half the @xmath64 and @xmath65 higgs masses , while the positive @xmath17 region has stau and stop masses close to the neutralino mass , resulting in important co - annihilations , and the neutralino 1 is a mixed bino - wino state .    in fig .",
    "[ br_tanb_mmamsb2 ] , we consider the @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 signal strengths of the higgs as a function of @xmath34 . in comparison with the other amsb scenarios , we find for the mm - amsb model a situation similar to the one of the hc - amsb model , where the higgs mass constraint is satisfied , the signal strength for the decay of the higgs boson to two photons is consistent with the preferred dark matter region of the parameter space within two sigmas .",
    "anomaly mediation and its extensions including hypercharge and moduli for supersymmetry breaking are attractive models from the theoretical point of view . the well - known shortcomings of these models have been largely discussed and corrected in the literature .",
    "however detailed phenomenological implications of the recent dark matter , higgs , flavour and collider data were not yet considered . in this paper",
    "we have discussed these limits , taking into account the most important recent flavour and higgs search results , together with the dark matter constraints in order to establish , which among these models are still compatible with data .",
    "the minimal amsb model is consistent with the loose relic density dark matter constraints , but consistency is only marginal at the two - sigma level , especially due to the higgs mass constraint .",
    "we consider therefore this minimal scenario much less attractive , once the phenomenological constraints are imposed .",
    "concerning the hc - amsb model , it is consistent with the loose relic density dark matter constraints and with the higgs mass value .",
    "relaxing the neutralino lsp requirement and the relic density constraints allows for points with increased @xmath67 in the region of light stau masses .",
    "this scenario with light staus has been thoroughly studied in the literature , however in the hc - amsb scenario it corresponds to a region in which the stau is the lsp , making it inconsistent with cosmology .",
    "contrary to the mamsb and the hc - amsb , the mm - amsb model provides solutions compatible with flavour , collider data and the full relic density constraint .",
    "therefore , the mm- and , to a lesser extent , the hc - amsb model , are still attractive solutions of supersymmetry breaking which are consistent with present data .",
    "future improvements in the precision of the higgs mass measurements may easily rule out the minimal amsb model if the present central value is confirmed .",
    "the mm- and hc - amsb models will be still consistent in that case , but further constraints can be obtained from more precise determinations of the signal strength in the measured decay channels .",
    "in particular for the @xmath67 signal strength , atlas and cms have currently quite different central values , as indicated after table [ tab : input ] . at present",
    "the average of the two values can be just used as a rough guideline .",
    "this shows the importance of present and future lhc data , in combination with flavour and dark matter constraints to suggest the path to be followed in the investigation of physics beyond the standard model .",

    "<S> anomaly mediation models are well motivated supersymmetry breaking scenarios which appear as alternatives to the minimal supergravity paradigm . </S>",
    "<S> these models are quite compelling from the theoretical point of view and it is therefore important to test if they are also viable models for phenomenology . </S>",
    "<S> we perform a study of these models in the light of all standard flavour , collider and dark matter constraints , including also the recent higgs boson measurements for the mass and signal strengths in the different decay channels . </S>",
    "<S> the minimal anomaly mediated supersymmetry breaking ( amsb ) scenario can satisfy in part of its parameter space the dark matter requirement but is only marginally consistent with the current higgs boson mass value . </S>",
    "<S> the hypercharge - amsb and mixed moduli - amsb scenarios can better describe present data from dark matter , flavour , low energy physics and are consistent with the measured mass of the higgs boson . </S>",
    "<S> the inclusion of the preferred signal strengths for the higgs boson decay channels shows that for @xmath0 the hypercharge - amsb and mixed moduli - amsb models can be consistent with the present higgs boson data . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast the minimal amsb has a narrower allowed range in @xmath1 . these different amsb scenarios , while consistent with present higgs boson measurements , can be further tested by future more precise data in the higgs sector . </S>"
