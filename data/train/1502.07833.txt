    "the well - known raychaudhuri equation has played a prominent role in many applications of the general theory of relativity .",
    "its application in investigations of space - time singularities is a classic example of this , see @xcite for reviews of this equation .",
    "a related problem is the study of focusing and defocusing of geodesics , which is of particular interest in cosmology @xcite .",
    "the interest in the raychaudhuri equation is not limited to the framework of general relativity , and several generalized equations have been obtained in other theories of gravity @xcite and in mathematical physics @xcite .",
    "recent applications of the equation include those presented in @xcite .    on the other hand , trajectories of particles moving in curved space can deviate from the geodesics of the background as a result of non - gravitational interactions with other objects .",
    "then , the study of geodesic focusing gets replaced by the study of focusing or defocusing of world - lines and the raychaudhuri equation gets modifications accordingly .",
    "this idea has been used in several situations , e.g. , in @xcite where the gravitational collapse of a magnetized medium is studied , and in @xcite where the same problem was considered for a charged medium .",
    "an interesting example of non - geodesic motion is the motion of particles with internal structures . in the simplest situation ,",
    "the case of spinning particles , where the particle has an internal angular momentum , the particle path is influenced by the coupling between its spin and the background curvature . in the so - called pole - dipole approximation , this is described by the mathisson - papapetrou - dixon ( mpd ) equations @xcite , which we will briefly review in the next section .",
    "these equations have been used to study the trajectories of spinning particles in different space - time backgrounds @xcite .",
    "the equation is also of interest within the context of extended theories of gravity @xcite .",
    "a generalization of the geodesic deviation equation for spinning particles was presented in @xcite .",
    "the idea of including spin in the raychaudhuri equation has been considered in @xcite for a spinning fluid . here , we are interested in obtaining extended versions of the raychaudhuri equation for spinning particles .",
    "such generalized equations would be of importance in investigating the focusing of spinning particle world - lines .",
    "the standard technique of obtaining the raychaudhuri equation in which the expansion , the shear , and the vorticity tensors are constructed out of a normalized time - like four - velocity ( for massive particles ) , does not work here , because the mpd equations do not guarantee the existence of such a four - vector @xcite . here , we utilize the method developed recently in @xcite , by which the above - mentioned construction may be made for a non - normalized vector .    in the following sections , we first review the equations of motion of spinning particles in the so - called pole - dipole approximation . we then obtain versions of the raychaudhuri equation associated with different physically meaningful vectors relevant to spinning particles , i.e. , the spin , the momentum , and the velocity vectors .",
    "then we investigate the applications of these generalized raychaudhuri equations by considering a congruence of spinning particle world - lines confined to the equatorial plane of the kerr space - time which provides a rather rare exmaple of exact solutions to the equations of motion .",
    "we obtain the explicit expressions for the expansion scalar associated with spin , momentum , and velocity vectors . in the last section ,",
    "we discuss the results .",
    "by setting @xmath0 and @xmath1 , to represent the particle spin tensor , momentum four - vector , and velocity respectively , one can write the mpd equations in the following form @xcite @xmath2 in the above set of equations , @xmath3 is the curvature tensor , and over - dots stand for covariant differentiation @xmath4 . to complete the equations of motion ; we supplement them by the so - called tulczyjew condition @xmath5 under these equations , the mass and spin of the particle are conserved , i.e. , @xmath6 the above equations result in the following relation for the velocity @xcite @xmath7 which can be simplified by choosing specific gauges , say , @xmath8 for which the instantaneous zero - momentum and the zero - velocity frames are simultaneous @xcite . by defining @xmath9 , one can show that @xmath10 is orthogonal to @xmath11 and can be interpreted as the particle 3-velocity with respect to the zero - momentum observer whose 4-velocity is @xmath11 , @xcite . according to eq .",
    "( [ eq11 ] ) , the velocity squared @xmath12 is not constant , and in fact , it can be space - like or null in some situations @xcite . in the above gauge , we rewrite eq .",
    "( [ eq11 ] ) in the following form @xmath13 with @xmath14 it is also convenient to represent the particle spin with the spin four - vector @xmath15 defined by @xmath16 in which @xmath17 is the alternating symbol .",
    "for a congruence of time - like world - lines with unit tangent @xmath18 , the raychaudhuri equation is given by @xmath19 where an over - dot means @xmath20 ( @xmath21 being the covariant derivative ) , @xmath22 is the expansion tensor , @xmath23 , @xmath24 is the shear tensor , @xmath25 is the vorticity ( rotation ) tensor , and @xmath26 when the congruence is geodesic , the last term in the right - hand side of the above equation disappears , and one is left with the standard text - book form of the equation .    now , considering a congruence of spinning particle world - lines , the above equation may be generalized in different ways by taking various relevant objects @xmath27 , and @xmath15 into account .",
    "the simplest situation we face with , is the one in which @xmath28 in ( [ m2 ] ) is replaced by @xmath11 .",
    "this results in @xmath29 this is the raychaudhuri equation for a time - like congruence corresponding to the world - lines of zero - momentum observers with 4-velocity @xmath11 . by using eqs .",
    "( [ e5 ] ) and ( [ eq3b ] ) , this can also be rewritten in the following form @xmath30 which can be used to calculate the rate of change of @xmath31 along @xmath1 .",
    "the last term in this equation shows the explicit dependence on spin .",
    "there are also implicit spin dependences through @xmath1 and @xmath32",
    ". expressed in terms of the normalized time - like vector @xmath11 and the non - normalized vector @xmath1 , this may also be considered as a physical example of the equation constructed in section vi of ref .",
    "@xcite .    regarding the velocity vector field @xmath1 , which is non - normalized here",
    ", one can not use the standard raychaudhuri equation .",
    "however , it can be described via a generalized raychaudhuri equation introduced in ref .",
    "( @xcite ) . in a slightly recast shape",
    ", it can be written in the following form @xmath33 it is also possible to establish a useful relationship between @xmath34 and @xmath35 by using eq .",
    "( [ e5 ] ) .",
    "it reads @xmath36 where @xmath37 .    on the other hand , getting back to eq .",
    "( [ eq11 ] ) , one can argue that those points in which @xmath1 becomes null or space - like correspond to situations where pole - dipole approximation ( upon which the equations of motion are based , see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) is not valid .",
    "thus , considering the limits of validity of the pole - dipole approximation , one can define the unit time - like vector @xmath38 in which the condition @xmath39 is assumed . by inserting this back into eq .",
    "( [ m2 ] ) , another version of the raychaudhuri equation may be obtained .",
    "still , another version of the raychaudhuri equation may be obtained by taking the unit space - like vector @xmath40 into account .",
    "this can be obtained by using @xmath41 instead of the projection tensor defined by eq .",
    "( [ m2a ] ) . inserting this and replacing @xmath28 by @xmath42 in eq .",
    "( [ eq11 ] ) then results in the desired equation .",
    "however , as discussed in ref .",
    "( @xcite ) , this would be a formal generalization without the usual meaning of the raychaudhuri equation .",
    "an interesting point is that @xmath42 is orthogonal to the time - like hypersurfaces spanned by @xmath28 and the resulting equation may be re - expressed in terms the extrinsic curvature of these hypersurfaces via the technique introduced in ref .",
    "one of the main applications of the raychaudhuri equation is in the study of space - time singularities .",
    "a powerful tool in this regard is an offspring of this equation , the so - called focusing theorem . in its simplest form",
    ", it sates that in a vorticity - free space - time ( i.e. @xmath43 ) , the geodesics focus provided the null and strong energy conditions hold @xcite .",
    "this is easily seen from the following equation @xmath44 in which the right - hand side is negative .    in the same manner ,",
    "one can obtain a similar relation for focusing of spinning particles by dropping @xmath45 in eq .",
    "( [ x1 ] ) .",
    "however , due to the presence of spin dependent terms , there is no guarantee that the right - hand side of the resulted equation is always negative . to proceed further ,",
    "here we consider a solution of the equations of motion ( [ eq3a])-([eq4 ] ) which was introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite and is among the very few known exact solutions .",
    "it describes the motion of spinning particles in the equatorial plane of the kerr black hole . in terms of the coordinates used in ref .",
    "@xcite , the metric is given by @xmath46 where @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 are the mass and the specific angular momentum of the source .",
    "the explicit form of the solution is given in terms of the null tetrad @xmath50 ( due to kinnersley @xcite ) by @xmath51 where @xmath52 with @xmath53 , and @xmath54 .",
    "the constant @xmath55 should satisfy @xmath56 , and @xmath57 . for @xmath58 , the momentum @xmath59 and the velocity @xmath1",
    "are confined to the equatorial plane and @xmath15 is perpendicular to it .",
    "( [ eq11 ] ) , we can obtain the following expressions for the components of @xmath1 for @xmath58 @xmath60 there is also a solution with @xmath61 .",
    "it is interesting to note that @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 above are independent of @xmath65 .",
    "now , we first insert the unit space - like vector @xmath66 into eq .",
    "( [ m2 ] ) . for @xmath58",
    ", we obtain @xmath67 and the equation reduces to @xmath68 and the generalized raychaudhuri equation is reduced to an equation for the acceleration - like quantity @xmath69 in this case .    for unit time - like vector @xmath70 , one can insert the relevant quantities in eq .",
    "( [ eq11a ] ) to show that the raychaudhuri equation is satisfied .",
    "in particular , we have @xmath71 and @xmath72 for the special case where @xmath73 , this gets simplified and we obtain the lhs as @xmath74 in which @xmath75 .",
    "now , the expression inside the first parenthesis is negative and hence the congruence is convergent whenever @xmath76 is larger than @xmath77 .",
    "we can also insert eq .",
    "( [ d3c ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ abr1 ] ) to check that it holds .",
    "finally , one can examine the raychaudhuri equation for @xmath78 .",
    "the resulting expressions are algebraically complicated .",

    "such a system provides at the same time normalized space - like and time - like vectors corresponding to the spin and momentum vector fields , and non - normalized vector corresponding to the velocity . at the formal level , this can be considered as a physical manifestation of the formalism introduced recently in the literature @xcite . from the other side ,",
    "i.e. , the spinning particle dynamics , these extended equations might be helpful in a better understanding of the motion of spinning particles .",
    "even though the complicated behavior of some terms in the right - hand sides of these generalized equations prevents us to deduce general focusing theorems , they still might be used in particular situations to study the focusing or de - focusing of world - lines .",
    "we have also considered the motion of spinning particles in the equatorial plane of the kerr space - time by computing the evolution of the expansion - like parameters associated with different congruences mentioned above .",
    "the existence of several congruences expanding in different manners in a single physical system is an intersting phenomena by itself .",
    "the above equations may also be obtained for spinning particles described by other known supplementary conditions .",
