    "it must be noticed that for rotating ( @xmath164 ) spacetimes , the circular string behaviour is qualitatively different from the non - rotating ( @xmath59 ) spacetimes . for large @xmath165 both in the 2 + 1 bh - ads as well as in the 3 + 1 ordinary kerr - ads spacetimes , non - collapsing circular string solutions exist .",
    "the potential @xmath166 for @xmath54 and no collapse into @xmath10 is possible .",
    "the dynamics of circular strings in curved spacetimes is determined by the string tension , which tends to contract the string , and by the local gravity ( which may be attractive or repulsive ) . in all the previous backgrounds ,",
    "the local gravity is attractive ( i.e. @xmath167 ) , and it acts together with the string tension in the sense of contraction .",
    "but in spacetimes with regions in which repulsion ( i.e. @xmath168 ) dominates , the strings can expand with unbounded radius ( unstable strings @xcite ) .",
    "it may also happen that the string tension and the local gravity be of the same order , i.e. the two opposite effects can balance , and the string is stationary .",

    "a summary of our results and conclusions is presented in tables i and ii .",
    "in this section we give a short introduction to the black hole anti de sitter ( bh - ads ) solution of @xmath198 dimensional einstein theory , recently found by baados et .",
    "there are now several ways to obtain this solution [ 20 - 22 ] .",
    "a simple way is to take as the starting point a line element in the form : @xmath199 where @xmath200 is an arbitrary function of @xmath52 .",
    "the non - vanishing components of the einstein tensor , @xmath201 , take the form : @xmath202 the only vacuum solution to the einstein equations is @xmath203 , corresponding to flat spacetime , as is well - known in 3 dimensions .",
    "however , if we introduce a cosmological constant : @xmath204 the solution to the einstein equations becomes non - trivial : @xmath205 where @xmath206 is an arbitrary constant .",
    "usually @xmath206 is scaled to @xmath207 , and then a positive @xmath208 represents de sitter space , while a negative @xmath208 represents anti de sitter space . on the other hand , since the constant @xmath206 is completely arbitrary , we may as well take a negative @xmath206 and then we also find solutions in the form : @xmath209 where @xmath210 is a constant .",
    "this is in fact the simplest example of the @xmath198 bh - ads solutions of ref.@xcite .",
    "this particular solution , where @xmath211 is identified with @xmath212 , is a black hole spacetime with mass @xmath213 and angular momentum @xmath59 .",
    "there is a horizon at @xmath214 and asymptotically it approaches anti de sitter space with @xmath215 .",
    "a two - parameter family ( mass @xmath2 and angular momentum @xmath3 ) of black holes is obtained by periodically identifying a linear combination of @xmath216 and @xmath211 .",
    "this leads to the solution ( the details can be found in refs.@xcite ) : @xmath217 with two horizons ( provided @xmath218 ) : @xmath219 and a static limit : @xmath220 defining an ergosphere , as for ordinary kerr black holes .",
    "the riemann tensor , corresponding to the line element ( 2.6 ) , is given by : @xmath221 so that the curvature is constant : @xmath222 the geometry of the solution ( 2.6 ) , near @xmath10 in particular , is discussed in detail in refs.[23 , 25 ] .",
    "we close this section with a few remarks on the relevance of this solution in string theory @xcite .",

    "it is easy to show that the metric ( 2.6 ) is a solution to the equations of motion corresponding to the action ( 2.11 ) , when supplemented by @xcite : @xmath228 following horowitz and welch @xcite the connection to the wzwn @xmath229-model approach is most easily established by dualizing the solution ( 2.6),(2.12 ) on the cyclic coordinate @xmath211 .",
    "according to the well - known procedure @xcite , the dual solution to ( 2.6),(2.12 ) is then given by @xcite : @xmath230 @xmath231 that after diagonalization of the metric becomes : @xmath18 @xmath19 where : @xmath232 @xmath233 the metric of ( 2.14 ) is exactly the black string solution in 3 dimensions of horne and horowitz @xcite , obtained by gauging the wzwn @xmath229-model of the group @xmath15 .",
    "notice that the spacetime ( 2.13 ) is stationary and axially symmetric , and that it has the same non - vanishing components of the metric tensor as the original spacetime ( 2.6 ) .",
    "this will be important when we consider circular strings in section 5 .",
    "another interesting observation is that the duality transformation does not change the two horizons ( 2.7 ) , while the static limit is changed to @xmath234 .",
    "one of the main purposes of the present paper is to consider the classical propagation of a bosonic test string in the @xmath198 bh - ads spacetime ( the spacetime is taken as a fixed background and no backreactions of the strings are included ) .",
    "the point particle geodesics were recently investigated in ref.@xcite .",
    "the string equations of motion are highly non - linear coupled partial differential equations , so we will restrict ourselves by considering two different approaches . in this section",

    "notice however that in both approaches we have only made the comparison for non - rotating spacetimes .",

    "the string tension will always try to contract the circular string , while the local gravity can be either attractive or repulsive . for the spacetimes ( 5.1 ) and ( 5.3 ) the local gravity is proportional to the derivative of @xmath200 .",

    "so in these cases both the string tension and the local gravity work in the direction of contraction of the circular string , and therefore all strings collapse to @xmath10 .",
    "the above argument also suggests that we can find qualitatively different circular string motions by considering spacetimes with regions of negative local gravity ( repulsion ) . in such spacetimes",
    "we can expect to find regions where the string tension is dominating , regions where the negative local gravity is dominating and regions where the two opposite effects are of the same order , being a natural balance ensuring the existence of stationary circular strings ( such a solution actually exists in de sitter space @xcite ) .",
    "we have already seen that in the rotating @xmath544",
    "@xmath198 dimensional bh - ads spacetime we can have string solutions qualitatively different from the @xmath59 solutions , namely non - collapsing circular strings ( provided @xmath444 ) .",

    "the potential ( 4.46 ) goes to minus infinity @xmath548 for @xmath169 and unbounded expanding circular strings are found [ 6 , 8 ] .",
    "these solutions and the other types of circular string solutions in de sitter space were discussed in great detail in ref.@xcite , so we shall not say too much about it here .",
    "one of the most important results in de sitter space is the existence of multi - string solutions [ 6 - 8 ] .",
    "it turns out that for certain ranges of the integration constant @xmath270 ( which is called @xmath549 in ref.@xcite ) the internal world - sheet time @xmath31 is a multi ( finite or infinite ) valued function of the cosmic time .",
    "this means that one single world - sheet , where @xmath31 runs from @xmath411 to @xmath550 , can describe finitely or infinitely many different and independent strings in de sitter space .",
    "it is an interesting question whether this feature is also present in other curved backgrounds .",
    "let us now consider briefly two other curved spacetimes in which we find circular string solutions with unbounded @xmath176 and multi - string solutions .",
    "schwarzschild de sitter space is in the form of eq .",
