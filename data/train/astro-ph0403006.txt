    "recent observations of an accelerating universe @xcite imply the existence of dark energy characterized by a negative pressure to density ratio , also known as the eos parameter @xmath1 . there have been discussions of the cosmological constant , the dark energy evolving according to a specific eos parameter @xcite , and the dark energy consisting of a dynamical cosmic scalar field , the quintessence @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the cosmological constant , the quintessence component in @xmath0 model has kinematic behavior and can develop perturbations .",
    "it has important features of time - evoluting eos parameter and scale - dependent effective sound speed @xcite .",
    "one significant issue is the sensitivity to initial perturbation conditions , which attracts much attention .    for some @xmath0 models",
    ", the quintessence potentials can be approximated with constant eos parameter , and the perturbations evolutions are insensitive to the initial quintessence perturbations , with minor effect on observations @xcite . for exponential potential",
    "@xmath2 @xcite , although quintessence perturbations may stay non - zero at some time for different background attractor solutions , they die out in matter - dominant time for physically reasonable models @xcite , which shows the insensitivity again . for the tracking",
    "quintessence models @xcite , large - scale non - adiabatic perturbations can grow or stay constant before entering tracker regime , but have to get suppressed afterwards @xcite . however , the first - order matrix formulation developed latter @xcite applies to general quintessence potential cases on all linear scales and indicates the possibility of non - vanishing entropy perturbations .",
    "recently some other @xmath0 models with special quintessence potentials , such as linear @xmath3 @xcite and supergravity @xmath3 @xcite , lead to special background evolutions .",
    "so it will be interesting to see the perturbations behavior and their sensitivity to initial conditions in these models , as well as their effects on cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite and baryon mass power spectrum @xcite in the universe .    in this paper",
    ", we describe the universe by a simple @xmath0 model with the conformal - newtonian metric in section 2 .",
    "the cosmological perturbations are solved for constant @xmath1 cases in section 3 , for linear-@xmath3 cases in section 4 , and for supergravity-@xmath3 cases in section 5 .",
    "the results are analyzed by the matrix formulation and their effects on cosmological observations are discussed in section 6 .",
    "here we consider the uniform matter and quintessence field background with small perturbations in a perturbed flat frw metric . focusing on scalar perturbations , we can use the flat conformal - newtonian metric for the gauge invariant approach @xcite : @xmath4\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is the conformal time and @xmath6 is the gravitational potential .",
    "we define @xmath7 , @xmath8 as the `` hubble parameter '' in the conformal - newtonian version , @xmath9 as today s conformal time , and @xmath10 as the normalized scale factor . for the quintessence scalar field , we assume the standard lagrangian @xmath11 and decompose the quintessence field as uniform background with small spatial perturbations : @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , where @xmath15 means global spatial average .",
    "we assume that the quintessence part and matter part only interact with each other gravitationally .",
    "so the wave equation of the quintessence field @xmath16 gives its background and perturbative components : @xmath17 the energy - momentum tensor of this quintessence field is @xmath18 .",
    "for the matter part , we assume its energy - momentum tensor has the form of the perfect fluid : @xmath19 , where @xmath20 $ ] is the 4-velocity of the fluid , @xmath21 is its 3-velocity , @xmath22 $ ] , and @xmath23 .",

    "due to the convenient conformal - newtonian metric , the matter perturbation @xmath28 drops out and can be found later via eq.([matteremc.4 ] ) .",

    "\\label{qequationconstantw.1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this formulation , any function @xmath3 is equivalently described by the corresponding eos parameter @xmath44 , which can be much more easily specified and compared with other dark energy models .",
    "one simple example would be @xmath48 , which has the exponential - like potential @xmath3 shown in figure  [ constantw_v_figure ] .     for constant-@xmath1 cases .",
    "the curved line is for @xmath49 .",
    "the scalar field rolls from top - left corner down to the today s value indicated by the dot .",
    "the horizontal line is for @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) . ]    in this special case , eq.([eos2 ] , [ q_0redefinition ] , [ qequationconstantw.0 ] ) give the solution for the quintessence field background : @xmath52 then the previous closed system of @xmath29 , @xmath53 , @xmath39 and @xmath38 can be reduced to a system of @xmath29 , @xmath39 and @xmath54 in @xmath31-space : @xmath55 , \\label{closedsystem.1 } \\\\ & & \\phi^{\\prime\\prime } + 3\\mathcal{h } \\phi^{\\prime } +   ( 2\\mathcal{h}^{\\prime } + \\mathcal{h}^2 ) \\phi =   \\frac{3}{2 } ( h_0 a_0)^2 ( 1+w ) \\omega_q \\left [ -\\frac{\\phi}{\\bar{a}^{1 + 3w } }   + \\frac{\\delta \\psi^{\\prime}}{\\bar{a}^{(1 + 3w)/2 } }   + \\frac{3}{2 } \\mathcal{h } ( 1-w ) \\frac{\\delta \\psi}{\\bar{a}^{(1 + 3w)/2 } } \\right ] ,   \\label{closedsystem.2 } \\\\ & & \\delta \\psi^{\\prime\\prime } + 2\\mathcal{h } \\delta \\psi^{\\prime } + \\left\\ { k^2 - \\frac{3}{2 } ( 1-w ) \\left [ \\frac{a^{\\prime\\prime}}{a }   - \\mathcal{h}^2 ( \\frac{7}{2 } + \\frac{3w}{2 } ) \\right ] \\right\\ } \\delta \\psi   - 4 \\frac{\\phi^{\\prime}}{\\bar{a}^{(1 + 3w)2 } }   - 3\\mathcal{h } ( 1-w ) \\frac{\\phi}{\\bar{a}^{(1 + 3w)/2 } } = 0 , \\label{closedsystem.3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the density parameters defined as usual . if @xmath50 , the quintessence perturbations vanish in eq.([closedsystem.2 ] ) and only its background contributes .",
    "this special case thus reduces to the @xmath51 model . at early times",
    ", this model can be well approximated by the flat @xmath58 model ( einstein - desitter space ) .",
    "then eq.([closedsystem.1 ] ) gives @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and eq.([closedsystem.2 ] ) gives @xmath39 independent of time for the growing modes of matter perturbations @xmath61 , as usual . at later times , the quintessence part begins to become important and the solution of @xmath62 from eq.([closedsystem.1 ] ) will deviate from @xmath63 more and more as time goes on .",
    "so the coefficient @xmath64 in eq.([closedsystem.2 ] ) is not zero any more and makes @xmath39 decay .",
    "this is what causes the isw effect in low-@xmath65 multipoles of the cmb power spectrum .",
    "recent cosmological observation of the accelerating universe requires @xmath66 .",
    "the @xmath67 cases would correspond to negative kinetic term in the standard quintessence lagrangian or other more complicated models , which we wo nt discuss here .",
    "so from now on we just consider @xmath68 in all our @xmath0 models .",
    "the initial conditions are @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 for modes outside horizon , based on inflation theory @xcite .",
    "for the same reason , @xmath72 .",
    "because in eq.([closedsystem.3 ] ) the restoring term ( @xmath73 ) is bigger than the damping term ( @xmath74 ) which is bigger than the driving term ( @xmath75 ) at early times , @xmath76 with any initial value which is not too big ( @xmath77 ) will oscillate and get damped quickly without affecting the @xmath39 evolution before the last - scattering epoch .",
    "so the primary effects on the cmb wo nt get modified much and are insensitive to the initial condition on the quintessence perturbations .",
    "this is one important result within many @xmath0 models @xcite .",
    "here we can see that it is mainly due to the huge @xmath43 , i.e. , the huge quintessence mass at early times .",
    "for now we just take the smooth initial condition @xmath78 for convenience .",
    "let us look at the behavior of this system at various spatial scales .    at small scales ( @xmath79 ) , by eq.([closedsystem.3 ] ) the growth of @xmath76 is strongly suppressed and stays negligible compared with @xmath39 . the effective sound speed of the quintessence perturbations approaches 1 ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "then we can drop the @xmath54 terms in the above system and the evolution of @xmath39 only comes from background effect without a dependence on @xmath31 in this region : @xmath81 this system behaves like the @xmath51 model with a different eos parameter @xmath1 and the additional @xmath82 term .",
    "if @xmath1 is bigger the dark energy takes over dominance earlier and @xmath83 deviates from @xmath63 earlier too , which makes @xmath39 decay more . in addition , the negative @xmath82 brings down @xmath39 more .",
    "so compared with the @xmath51 model , small - scale quintessence perturbations in the @xmath0 model do not grow and only the background effect contributes , which drags down the gravitational potential more and corresponds to a bigger isw effect .    at scales comparable to or larger than horizon size ( @xmath84 ) , the quintessence perturbations @xmath54 can grow to the order of the gravitational potential @xmath39 by eq.([closedsystem.3 ] ) with smaller effective sound speed ( @xmath85 ) .",
    "then it will back - react on the @xmath39 evolution via eq.([closedsystem.2 ] ) .",
    "because of the positive coefficient , the quintessence perturbations tend to raise the gravitationally potential @xmath39 to make it decay less .",
    "this is different from the @xmath79 case , and agrees with the result of a phenomenological approach @xcite .",
    "thus in this @xmath0 model the evolution of perturbations and gravitational potential depends on scale .    with definition on horizon scale @xmath86 , numerical calculation gives @xmath87 and @xmath88 once we specify the parameters @xmath31 and @xmath1 .",
    "corresponding to the assumptions we made before for this linearized system , we only consider @xmath89 . for @xmath90 and @xmath91 , the time evolution @xmath87 is shown compared with the @xmath50 case in figure  [ constantw_phi_figure ] .     for the constant-@xmath1 case .",
    "the three thin lines correspond to @xmath92 from top to bottom for the @xmath90 case .",
    "the thick line is the scale - independent @xmath50 case ( @xmath51 ) . ]",
    "linear scalar field potential was looked by andrei @xcite in inflation theory long ago .",
    "recently it is reviewed by dimopoulos and thomas @xcite as a quintessence field within a quantum mechanically stable action . due to the large z - moduli of the wave function factor ,",
    "the higher order potential derivatives @xmath93 can be neglected and only the linear term remains . after shifting the origin and considering the symmetry of @xmath94 , the typical @xmath3 can be written as : @xmath95 this linear potential may eventually lead to negative total energy density and result in a rapid crunch .",
    "let us consider the closed system defined in @xmath962 to study the behavior of both background and perturbations for this model in detail .",
    "in order of magnitude , eq.([qequation.0 ] ) gives @xmath97 and eq.([eos2 ] ) gives @xmath98 for @xmath99 .",
    "combining these two , we will have @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "so this simple analysis sets the range of magnitude for the quintessence field quantities .",
    "now we can redefine the quintessence field for later convenience : @xmath102 the closed system of equations can then be rewritten as : @xmath103 where the perturbation equations are in @xmath31-space . for the background ,",
    "we take the initial condition as @xmath104 and @xmath105 based on inflation theory .",
    "the @xmath106 value is chosen by requiring that today s quintessence energy density fits the observation , @xmath107 , or equivalently , @xmath108 .",
    "then this describes an initially static field rolling down a potential slope .",
    "its effective eos parameter evolves from -1 to some value @xmath109 today .",
    "different slope values @xmath110 correspond to different @xmath106 and eos parameter @xmath44 , but the same energy density @xmath111 today .",
    "the correspondence is listed in table  [ v - w_table ] .",
    "the detail has been worked out in the `` doomsday '' model @xcite . for the @xmath112 case ,",
    "the potential @xmath3 is shown in figure  [ linearv_v_figure ] .",
    ".[v - w_table]quintessence potential slope and starting position corresponding to @xmath113 [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     this potential is unbounded from below and the theory is unstable . since the potential can remain positive for @xmath114 for a time longer than the present age of the universe",
    "before it finally collapses , this model is sufficient to describe the background evolution of the universe .",
    "however , the tachyon mass makes the quintessence instability develop and affect the gravitational potential , and thus the system becomes sensitive to the initial conditions at large scales ( @xmath115 ) .",
    "this puts more constraints on the initial quintessence conditions and this supergravity model itself . for the smooth initial condition @xmath116",
    ", this model has a similar scale - dependent perturbation evolution as the linear-@xmath3 model in last section .",
    "for @xmath117 and @xmath91 , the time evolution @xmath87 is shown in figure  [ sugrav_phi_figure ] .",
    "for the supergravity-@xmath3 case , with @xmath117 and smooth initial condition .",
    "the three curves correspond to @xmath91 from top to bottom . ]",
    "in another viewpoint , we can apply the first - order matrix formulation in @xcite to analyze the different quintessence perturbation behaviors in above @xmath0 models . at large scales ( @xmath118 ) , the relative entropy perturbation @xmath119 and intrinsic entropy perturbation @xmath120 @xcite have coupled evolution equation @xmath121 where @xmath122 means the perfect fluid component , @xmath123 , and @xmath124 . for most of the time in our @xmath0 models",
    ", @xmath58 dominates and have @xmath125 , @xmath126 , and @xmath127 .",
    "then the eigenvalues are @xmath128 $ ] . for the constant @xmath1 case",
    ", @xmath129 leads to @xmath130 , corresponding to decaying entropy perturbations . while for the linear @xmath3 case , @xmath131 leads to @xmath132 , corresponding to at least one growing entropy perturbation mode .",
    "this fits our previous analysis well .    in all @xmath0 models that we studied above",
    ", the quintessence perturbations have the common characteristic feature of scale dependence . at small scales the perturbations",
    "do not grow and the gravitational potential decays more only due to background effects ; at large scales the perturbations grow and sustain the gravitational potential . on the other hand , because of the different quintessence potentials , the three @xmath0 models have different sensitivity to the initial conditions on quintessence perturbations .",
    "the constant-@xmath1 model has a large quintessence mass at early times and damps perturbations fast so that it is insensitive to initial conditions at all scales . in this model",
    "the quintessence has no effect before the last - scattering time .",
    "in contrast , the linear-@xmath3 model and supergravity-@xmath3 model have zero and tachyon quintessence mass respectively , and their perturbations remain near their initial value ( @xmath133 ) at large scales .",
    "since the eos parameter @xmath1 in these two models approaches -1 at early times , their dark energy dominates only very recently , like the @xmath51 model .",
    "so the total back - reaction of dark energy perturbations ( background times relative perturbations ) on other perturbations remains negligible before the last - scattering time , when the universe evolves like @xmath134 , @xmath135 , @xmath136 , @xmath137 , and @xmath138 .",
    "so they do not change the primary cmb anisotropies either .",
    "but later when the dark energy background become dominant , this back - reaction of dark energy perturbations will affect other perturbations drastically , depending on how smooth the initial perturbations are .    for smooth initial conditions in all models",
    "the dark energy has no primary cmb effect except that its background contributes to the distance to the last - scattering surface .",
    "but later on both the dark energy background and perturbations will contribute to the change of the gravitational potential , which may lead to a considerable secondary cmb effect such as the isw effect @xcite .",
    "for the scale - invariant primordial spectrum @xmath139 , the large - scale cmb power spectrum due to the sw effect is : @xmath140 ^ 2 \\ ; , \\label{isw_k}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath141 is the spherical bessel function and @xmath142 is the evolution factor of the gravitational potential defined as @xmath143 .",
    "the integral over the @xmath144 term corresponds to the primary sw effect on the last - scattering surface , and the integral over the remaining terms corresponds to the isw effect .",
    "the flat @xmath58 model gives @xmath145 and only the primary sw effect , with @xmath146 .",
    "the flat @xmath51 model has no dark energy perturbations and gives a scale - independent evolution factor @xmath147 which leads to a positive isw effect in the low-@xmath65 cmb power spectrum @xcite , rising at the lower-@xmath65 ( @xmath148 ) end . for the flat @xmath0 model",
    ", the bigger eos parameter @xmath1 @xmath149 brings out the dark energy earlier and decreases the gravitational potential more , corresponding to a bigger @xmath150 value for all scales and affecting the magnitude of the cmb power spectrum .",
    "the quintessence perturbations grow differently at different scales and give a @xmath31-dependent @xmath151 , which is bigger at small scales than at large scales with the transition around the horizon size .",
    "this means that the lower-@xmath65 ( @xmath148 ) multipoles will get suppressed relative to the higher-@xmath65 ones such that the whole low-@xmath65 spectrum will get flattened .",
    "these two effects can be seen by numerical calculation for the standard @xmath51 model , constant-@xmath1 @xmath0 model with @xmath90 , and linear-@xmath3 @xmath0 model with @xmath112 in figure  [ isw_figure ] .",
    "this is done with eq.([isw_k ] ) approximately for illustrative purpose .",
    "exact results should refer to more accurate numerical work like the cmb - fast code . for non - smooth initial conditions ,",
    "the perturbation evolution can be seen in table  [ linearv_initial_value_dependence_table ] and table  [ sugrav_initial_value_dependence_table ] , and corresponds to very unusual cosmological scenarios which we will not discuss further .",
    "cmb power spectrum due to the sachs - wolfe effect in various @xmath0 models with the smooth initial condition .",
    "the solid line is for the @xmath51 model , the dash line for the constant-@xmath1 @xmath0 model with @xmath152 , and the dot line for the linear-@xmath3 @xmath0 model with @xmath112 . ]",
    "the scale dependence and sensitivity to initial perturbations can also be tested in other ways .",
    "the cmb results give the primordial @xmath153 spectrum , while the gravitational lensing and other large - scale observations yield @xmath153 information at low redshift .",
    "the ratio of these two , the evolution of gravitational potential , can be directly compared with the theoretical plot on different scales shown above for various @xmath0 models .",
    "furthermore , since the matter density perturbation is related to the gravitational potential by eq.([matteremc.4 ] ) , the evolution of gravitational potential can also be inferred from the measurement of the visible matter density spectrum ( by sdss , etc . ) , and checked with @xmath0 predictions .    by considering the dark energy perturbations in these @xmath0 models",
    ", we see that they all have a scale dependence which is different from the @xmath154 model , and they have different sensitivity to initial conditions .",
    "these properties make the dark energy perturbations an effective way to test these models .",
    "more precise cosmological observations in the future will give better constraints on these @xmath0 models .",
