    "the construction of the low - energy baryon state model is a long - standing task , and perhaps the first realistic solution of this problem was proposed by skyrme @xcite . within the skyrme approach baryon treated as a topological soliton of non - linear chiral meson field and the topological number of such soliton",
    "is associated with the baryon number .",
    "this idea was very popular in the eighties due to the intense interest to the solitonic physics at that time .",
    "the skyrme model is well studied and gives us the quite good description of the many low - energy nuclear physics phenomena .    on the other hand , from the dis experiments we know , that the baryon consists of the charged constituents ( so called constituent quarks ) , but the experiments with spin of proton showed that only twenty percents of the baryon spin can be associated with the charged constituents @xcite !",
    "therefore , the realistic model for low - energy baryon state should describe the quark constituents as well as the chiral degrees of freedom of the meson cloud around them .    but how to combine these two opposite points of view on the baryon into the framework of a one model ? in order to find the model with such dualistic properties , the so - called `` two - phase '' models were proposed .",
    "the simplest realization of the two - phase idea is the well - known chiral bag model ( chbm ) @xcite . in this model",
    ", the constituent quarks are placed inside a spherical region ( so - called `` bag '' ) , subject to the confining boundary conditions , and meson cloud lives outside . as a rule , the exterior pion field are skyrmionic but the quark part is necessary in this model for the self - consistency of the model , as will as for the phenomenological point of view .",
    "typical lagrangian of the two - phase model consists of the three parts @xmath0 where heaviside s @xmath1 function cuts out the internal region for quark part of the lagrangian @xmath2 , inverse @xmath3 function cuts out the external region for meson field with the lagrangian @xmath4 .",
    "the crucial point of this model steams from the fact that the kinematic consequence of the confinement boundary conditions for fermions in the bag is the non - zero axial current across the boundary . for self - consistency of the model",
    ", these two regions should be joined by the requirement of continuity of the axial current on the boundary . in order to guarantee such continuity ,",
    "the boundary term @xmath5 must be introduced .",
    "chiral bag model is used very widely in the phenomenology of elementary particle physics @xcite but on the other hand this model has serious methodological disadvantages .",
    "first of all , as one can easily see in ( [ 1.0 ] ) , this lagrangian depends directly on the geometry of the confinement region @xmath6 . in the case of the chiral bag model ,",
    "@xmath6 is a sphere .",
    "but it would be very interesting to find a theory where the form of the confinement region is generated dynamically , rather than is chosen `` by hand '' , as in the case of the chbm .",
    "moreover , the geometry dependence of the lagrangian ( [ 1.0 ] ) directly violates the lorenz covariance of the theory , and thus there is no a way for connection such complicated and non - invariant construction with qcd .",
    "another kind of methodological difficulties appears from skyrme part of the skyrme model @xcite .",
    "the point is that the simplest realization of the non - linear meson field ( so - called weinberg s prototype theory ) @xmath7 has no soliton solution and any non - trivial static solutions of this theory have infinite self - energy .",
    "but on the other hand , the theory ( [ 1.1 ] ) correctly describes the behavior of the meson field at large distance from the source ( the proton or neutron ) . in order to regularize the singular self - energy of the prototype theory , skyrme proposed to modify slightly the theory @xcite by means of the additional term @xmath8 ^ 2/e$ ] ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . such term in the lagrangian of the meson field leads to generation of the soliton solutions ( skyrmions ) , and now is treated as the leading order of the expansion of the effective meson theory in strong limit ( by analogy with the chiral perturbation theory lagrangian defined as series ) .",
    "but unfortunately such analogy is not so good for the soliton paradigm of baryons .",
    "basing on the renormalization group approach , one can show that the coefficients of such expansion depended strongly on the energy scale of the process , and in the strong regime ( near the nucleon ) the highest terms of the expansion become more and more essential @xcite .",
    "this fact is connected with the nonrenormalizable nature of chiral field theory and this situation is similar with quantum gravity .    an additional point to emphasize",
    "is that the skyrme regularization procedure does not solve the problem of singular solutions of chiral field theory , because skyrme model has a lot of another singular solutions along with soliton sector .    in order to construct a suitable candidate for",
    "the role of the chiral effective theory , let us consider a very illuminative historical analogy with the problem of singular self - energy of electron . before the era of quantum electrodynamics , born and infeld @xcite proposed the non - linear covariant action for the electro - magnetic fields with very attractive features .",
    "firstly , in the framework of the bi theory , the problem of singular self - energy of electron can be solved . in this theory",
    "the electron is a stable finite energy solution of the bi field equation with electric charge .",
    "second , the bi action has the scale parameter @xmath9 . using expansion in this parameter ,",
    "one reduces the bi action to the usual maxwell form in the low - energy limit . indeed , using the analogy with the relativistic particle action ,",
    "let us consider the action in the born - infeld form @xmath10    it can be shown that the solution for the electrostatic spherically symmetrical potential @xmath11 reads    @xmath12    in fig .",
    "2 the coulomb solution and the relevant soliton of bi electrodynamics are presented . comparing fig.1 and fig .",
    "2 , one finds that the situations with the singular salfenergy in these two theories ( singular selfenergy of the coulomb potential and singular selfenergy of the solutions of the prototype lagrangian ( [ 1.1 ] ) ) are very similar and in our paper we apply the very similar procedure for the chiral prototype lagrangian ( [ 1.1 ] ) .",
    "let us consider the lagrangian @xmath13 where @xmath9 is the mass dimensional scale parameter of our model .",
    "it can be easily shown that the expansion of the lagrangian ( [ 2.1 ] ) gives us the prototype theory as the leading order theory in the parameter @xmath9 . the theory ( [ 2.1 ] ) is the direct analogue of the born - infeld action for chiral fields .",
    "our theory contains only the second - order derivative terms .",
    "thus the dynamics of this theory can be studied in detail .",
    "now we consider the spherically symmetrical field configuration @xmath14 the energy of such configuration is the functional @xmath15 = 8 \\pi f^2_\\pi \\beta^2 \\int\\limits_0^\\infty \\bigl ( 1 - r \\bigr ) r^2 dr , \\label{2.5}\\ ] ] where @xmath16    using the variation principle , we get the equation of motion @xmath17 and for amplitude @xmath18 we obtain @xmath19 @xmath20    the next aim of our investigation is finding the solutions of equation ( [ 2.4 ] ) .",
    "this equation is a very complicated nonlinear differential equation . in order to solve it ,",
    "only numerical or approximation methods seem applicable .",
    "the crucial point of such analysis is that the leading derivative term in this equation contains the factor @xmath21    due to this factor , equation ( [ 2.4 ] ) has a singular region ( singular surface ) with singular behavior of solutions .",
    "one can find an equation on such surface by using the standard singular perturbation theory techniques @xcite .",
    "let @xmath22 belong to such singular surface",
    ". then @xmath23 equations ( [ 2.61 ] ) have only two solutions : whether @xmath24 or @xmath25    topological solitons of chbi theory correspond to the possibility ( [ 2.63 ] ) were studied in @xcite . in our paper",
    "we consider the more interesting possibility ( [ 2.62 ] )    using the standard singular perturbation theory procedure @xcite , one obtains the asymptotic behavior near the singular surface ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 ) @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a constant .",
    "of course , the derivative @xmath30 at the point @xmath31 is zero .    to guarantee the finiteness of the energy of our solutions",
    ", we should choose the following asymptotic at infinity ( @xmath32 ) @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a constant .",
    "notice that equation ( [ 2.4 ] ) has very useful symmetries .",
    "first of all , this equation is symmetrical with respect to the changes @xmath35 and @xmath36 .    the numerical investigation of the solutions of equation ( [ 2.4 ] ) which have the asymptotics ( [ 2.62 ] )",
    "( @xmath37 ) at infinity is presented in fig.3 .",
    "most of these solutions can be evaluated only for @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is determined by @xmath40 . but",
    "among this set of solutions there are solutions with @xmath41 .",
    "such solutions have the asymptotics @xcite @xmath42 at origin ( @xmath43 is a constant ) , and these are the topological solitons of the chbi theory .",
    "solitons with @xmath44 and @xmath45 are presented in fig.4 .",
    "the scale parameter @xmath46 is preliminarily defined from the hypothesis that the soliton with @xmath47 is a nucleon .",
    "now we would like to draw the attention to another class of solutions .",
    "these solutions are defined everywhere , except the small ( @xmath48 0.2 fm ) spherical region about the origin .",
    "these solutions look like a  bubble `` of vacuum in the chiral fields and are of the interest for the chiral bag model of baryons @xcite . in the internal region ( @xmath49 )",
    ", the only vacuum configuration can exist . from the mathematical point of view ,",
    "such ' ' step - like  solutions with jump of @xmath18 at @xmath31 are a generalized solutions @xcite .    to clarify the physical nature of this `` step - like  generalized solutions , let us consider the projection of the left - hand chiral current on the outward normal of the singular surface . as we pointed out in the introduction , a non - zero chiral current across the boundary the kinematic is the consequence of the confinement boundary conditions for the fermions in the bag",
    "according to our proposition , the singular surface of ' ' step - like  solutions is a confinement boundary surface for constituent quarks . for",
    "the self - consistency of our `` two - phase '' picture , let us check is it possible to compensate the non - zero quark chiral current on the confinement surface by the non - zero chiral current of chbi \" step - like  configuration that appear due to the defect on the singular surface .",
    "the projection the chiral current on the outward normal of the singular surface for the spherically symmetrical configuration ( [ 2.2 ] ) reads @xmath50 where the coefficient @xmath29 from the asymptotic ( [ 2.64 ] ) is a function of @xmath51 and can be evaluated numerically .    the crucial point for such analysis steams from the fact that @xmath52 has the singularity at @xmath53 and @xmath41 , or @xmath54 .",
    "this implies that the soliton solutions of the chbi theory are solutions with point - like singular chiral source and the `` bag''-like solutions are the solutions with the some distribution of the chiral current on the confinement surface .",
    "it is possible to show that for any internal constituent quark configuration with confinement inside some volume @xmath6 the solution of chbi theory @xmath55 could be defined which compensate the non - zero quark s chiral current across the surface @xmath56 @xmath57 equation ( [ 2.72 ] ) can be considered as a condition on coefficient @xmath58 , and plays the role of the self - consistency condition between quark and chiral phases .    in conclusion of this section",
    ", it would be interesting to point out that the condition ( [ 2.72 ] ) is not jast an artifact of the spherical symmetry of our task .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the asymptotics ( [ 2.64 ] ) but , as easy to see , such asymptotics can depended only on local characteristics of surface @xmath59 .",
    "it means that the asimptotics of the field configuration along the normal in the leading order depends only on the curvature radius of the confinement surface at this point and equation ( [ 2.72 ] ) can be used for any other geometry of @xmath56 .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study of `` bag''-like generalized solutions of the born - infeld theory for chiral fields .",
    "these solutions were firstly proposed in our work @xcite . for simplicity ,",
    "in this work we restricted ourselves by the spherically symmetrical configuration ( [ 2.2 ] ) , but , of course , the chbi theory has solutions with another geometry of the singular surface .",
    "physically the critical behavior in the chbi theory appears when the chiral field strength of the prototype field theory approaches the value of the squarred f effective coupling constant ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "this is a very physical idea . today we know that there are many theories which have the low - energy limit in the form of the born - infeld action @xcite .",
    "the chiral born - infeld theory is a good candidate on the role of the effective chiral theory and the model for the chiral cloud of the baryons . in this model",
    "one can find not only spherical `` bags '' , it is possible to also study the `` string''-like , toroidal or `` * * y**-sign''-like solutions , or some another geometry .",
    "the geometry of confinement surface depends directly on the model of color confinement and it would be very interesting to use , for example , the lattice qcd simulations for the color degrees of freedom in combination with our model for external chiral field .    in conclusions",
    "i would like to point out that there are many interconnections between lattice qcd at strong coupling limit and chbi theory .",
    "it is possible to prove such low - energy chiral limit of qcd using the lattice regularization of qcd .",
    "all this questions should be the topics for future works .",
