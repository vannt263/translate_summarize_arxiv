    "fluctuation - dissipation  ( fd ) relations in non - equilibrium systems have been the subject of considerable attention recently @xcite . in this context , granular matter serves as a perfect example of a non - equilibrium system .",
    "such systems consist of macroscopic grains undergoing inelastic collisions . in a _ cooling state _",
    ", no energy is injected into the system , and the total kinetic energy decreases steadily , approaching a trivial steady - state where all grains are at rest .",
    "if energy is constantly supplied to the system a _ non - equilibrium steady - state _ ( ness ) is reached .",
    "this paper focuses on the frequency - dependent fd relations in this ness .",
    "if the density of grains is low , the system is known as a granular gas @xcite . in this case ,",
    "spatial correlations are small , and mean - field models , in which particles collide without regard to their positions , may provide good approximations of the system at hand . in such models ,",
    "interactions are governed by a stochastic collision rule , with some interaction rate .",
    "two such models are studied in this paper , differing in their collision rules .",
    "the simpler of the two is the _",
    "inelastic maxwell model _ @xcite , in which the collision rate is taken to be constant for each pair of particles in the system . in the second ,",
    "more realistic model , which we refer to as the _ mean - field granular gas _ ( mfgg ) , the collision rate of each pair of particles is proportional to the particles relative velocity .",
    "the fd theorem @xcite connects the linear response of an equilibrium system to its correlations .",
    "stated in the frequency ( @xmath0 ) domain , it relates the response function to a weak harmonic force to the fourier - laplace transform of the auto - correlation function of the observable conjugate to that force .",
    "the theorem states that , remarkably , the two functions have _ exactly _ the same frequency - dependence , and moreover , that their ratio is equal to the temperature of the system .",
    "since the full frequency - dependent functions are not always easy to compute , their @xmath1 limit is often calculated ; the connection between fluctuation and response in this limit is known as the einstein relation .    in a ness , the response to a weak perturbation from the steady - state and the corresponding auto - correlation may be similarly defined . since granular gases are out of equilibrium",
    ", however , the fd relation is not expected to generally hold , and the two functions may have different frequency dependencies . if we nevertheless define a fd temperature @xmath2 as the ratio of the correlation and response functions @xcite , we would expect this quantity to depend on frequency .",
    "this having been said , there is evidence that the fd relation may nonetheless closely hold for driven granular gases .",
    "molecular dynamics simulations of 2d granular gases  @xcite indicate that @xmath2 is approximately frequency - independent , and moreover , is close to the average kinetic energy per particle , known as the granular temperature @xmath3 .",
    "einstein relations were calculated for the mfgg model , yielding a value for @xmath2 different from @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "numerically , however , this deviation was small , and consistent with direct monte - carlo simulations @xcite that observed no violation of the fd relation ( dependence of @xmath2 on @xmath0 ) to within their accuracy .",
    "experiments on air fluidized particles have shown that at low densities the effective temperature measured from the einstein relations is close to the granular temperature @xcite . for the 1d maxwell model with a gaussian thermostat ,",
    "the einstein relation was calculated @xcite and yielded @xmath4 .",
    "additional transport coefficients , calculated in @xcite , verify the einstein relation in the maxwell model .",
    "subsequently , we showed that the full frequency - dependent fd relation holds exactly for the maxwell model , driven by either a gaussian or a stochastic thermostat @xcite .",
    "this result was recently shown to also hold in 2d with a gaussian thermostat @xcite .",
    "fluctuation - dissipation relations in denser systems , in which correlations play a role , are discussed e.g. in @xcite .",
    "time dependent fd relations in other systems are studied in @xcite .",
    "in @xcite we also discussed a simple model of a granular gas @xcite , for which the fd relations were calculated analytically .",
    "it was shown that in measurements where correlations between different degrees of freedom appear , the fd relation is violated . in @xcite",
    "the role of correlations was studied in simulations of granular fluids , and was shown to affect the violation of the fd relation . however",
    ", fd violation has not yet been observed in simulations of dilute granular gases , due to their limited accuracy . in this paper",
    "we provide theoretical reasoning for why fd relations should be only slightly violated even in the dilute limit .",
    "we first show that the frequency dependent fd relation holds in the maxwell model in any dimension and with both customarily used thermostats .",
    "we then show that the frequency - dependent fd relation is violated in the mfgg , where collision rates depend on velocity .",
    "quantitatively , the violation is expected to be small , in accordance with previous simulation results .",
    "the green - kubo ( gk ) formulation  @xcite employs the frequency - dependent autocorrelation function , defined as the fourier - laplace transform of the velocity autocorrelation function , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the system dimension .",
    "vectorial quantities are written in boldface font ( e.g. @xmath7 for the velocity ) .",
    "note that @xmath8 reduces to the diffusion coefficient in the zero frequency limit .",
    "the frequency dependent mobility is calculated by applying a weak periodic force @xmath9 to a single particle @xmath10 and measuring the amplitude @xmath11 of its resulting velocity , averaged over the steady - state : @xmath12 .",
    "then @xmath13 and @xmath14 are directed along the same direction , and the mobility @xmath15 is defined so that @xmath16 equivalently , if some general time - dependent force @xmath17 is applied to particle @xmath10 , and @xmath18 is its resulting average velocity , @xmath19 may be defined so that @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the fourier transforms of @xmath17 and @xmath18 respectively . note that both @xmath8 and @xmath15 are complex .    in thermodynamic equilibrium the fd theorem , or kubo formula , guaranties that @xmath23 , where the temperature is measured in units of energy , and boltzmann s constant is set to one .",
    "the einstein relation is obtained by taking the @xmath1 limit , thereby connecting the mobility with respect to a constant force and the long time diffusion coefficient .    for a ness one may use the fluctuation @xmath8 and the response @xmath15 to define an effective fd temperature @xcite : @xmath24 @xmath25 scales fluctuations in the system and in general depends on the measurement frequency @xmath0 . in this context , the fd theorem states that in equilibrium @xmath26 is independent of @xmath0 and is equal to the system s temperature .",
    "in this section we show that in the maxwell model , where the collision rate @xmath27 is velocity independent , the frequency dependent gk relations hold exactly with @xmath4 , where @xmath3 , known as the granular temperature , is defined as @xmath28 ( taking particles of unit mass ) . in  @xcite the einstein relations for the 1d maxwell model with a gaussian thermostat were shown to give @xmath29 ( the thermostats are defined below ) . in @xcite",
    "we showed that for both gaussian and stochastic thermostats , in the 1d maxwell model @xmath30 , independent of frequency .",
    "for clarity of presentation , before turning to higher dimensions and to the more realistic mfgg model , we first present the derivation of this result in more detail .    in the 1d inelastic maxwell model",

    "the particles are coupled to a thermostat , which can be of two types .",
