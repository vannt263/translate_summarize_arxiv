    "the notion that molecules and other atomic aggregates possess well - defined shapes , arguably the most basic paradigm of chemistry , is rooted in the classical structural theory @xcite . in the quantum - mechanical framework , this notion is _ put in _ on the basis of the topography of a born - oppenheimer ( bo ) potential energy surface ( pes ) @xcite .    in atomic physics , the success of the independent - particle central - field model led , for a long time , to the view that atoms are essentially spherical @xcite .",
    "however , the discovery that the intrashell supermultiplets in the double - excitation spectra of he can be empirically assigned to collective rotational - like and bendinglike motions of the electrons @xcite , analogous to the rovibrational motions of a nonrigid linear @xmath5 molecule , challenged this view @xcite .",
    "afterwards , it was found that more complex atoms can have nonspherical shapes even in their ground states @xcite .",
    "an analogous situation , referred to as  crystallization \" , arises in  artificial atoms \" , which are mesoscopic systems constituted by electrons confined in semiconductor quantum dots @xcite .    in nuclear physics",
    ", it was early recognized that nuclei can deviate from the spherical shape @xcite .",
    "moreover , the concept of a bo pes was introduced , in analogy with the molecular case , albeit in the limited context of the empirical liquid drop model , with the roles of the adiabatic degrees of freedom played by the parameters that specify the surface deformation @xcite .    without recourse to the bo approximation , for any collection of particles , elements of structure",
    "can still be extracted from the patterns in suitably defined probability densities obtained from all - particle wavefunctions .",
    "for example , such densities reveal that in some states of few - valence - electron atoms @xcite and other few - body systems @xcite the correlations can induce such a collective behavior of the particles that the system acquires a moleculelike shape . nevertheless , this probability - based notion of  quantum structure \" is not as far reaching as the bo - pes - based notion of classical structure commonly employed in the molecular sciences @xcite .",
    "hence , it is highly desirable to generalize the concept of pes , starting from the quantum - mechanical hamiltonian , to any assembly of particles , since this would allow the transfer of chemical - like notions , e.g. , bond length , bond angle , and transition state , together with the conceptual and technical apparatus of quantum chemistry and molecular spectroscopy , e.g. , the franck - condon principle , to other realms , thereby providing a unified treatment of atoms in molecules @xcite , electrons in atoms @xcite , quasiparticles in nanostructures @xcite , nucleons in nuclei @xcite , and even quarks in baryons @xcite . at first sight",
    ", this program might seem to be hampered by the fact that an adiabatic separation of degrees of freedom , the basic tenet of the bo approximation @xcite , is not always possible .",
    "however , in this paper we rigorously prove that such generalization is indeed feasible , by introducing an exact and unique marginal - conditional factorization ( mcf ) of the wavefunction @xcite .    as a prototype ,",
    "we show how to define a _",
    "_ pes ( napes ) for the radial motions of the electrons in @xmath0 states of two - electron atoms , which amounts to formulating an _ exact _ central - field model for these states . for the case of the ground state of he , the topography of this surface allows us to extract a classical molecularlike interpretation of the structure of the atom .",
    "in addition , we analyze the contributions of the different aspects of the electron correlation to this topography .",
    "furthermore , we show that this napes provides a convenient conceptual framework for addressing issues of correlation - induced symmetry breaking and quantum phase transition .",
    "for the @xmath0 states of two - electron atoms , the internal schrdinger equation , @xmath6 determines the nonrelativistic energy , @xmath7 @xcite . considering the center of mass located at the nucleus ,",
    "the internal coordinates @xmath8 , with @xmath9 being the electron - nucleus distances and @xmath3 being the interelectronic distance , determine the shape and size of the electron - nucleus - electron triangle .",
    "such coordinates are independent , except that they are constrained by the triangle condition @xmath10 .",
    "the volume element of this configuration space is @xmath11 . in atomic units ,",
    "the fixed - nucleus hamiltonian is given by @xmath12 evidently , in this coordinate system there appear kinetic couplings , i.e. , terms containing derivatives with respect to @xmath3 , besides the original coulomb potential coupling , @xmath13 .",
    "we wish to construct a pes for the radial degrees of freedom , @xmath9 , which we will accomplish by averaging over the @xmath3 variable , in the following way .",
    "the internal distribution function is given by @xmath14 according to bayes rule , this function can be factorized as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the marginal distribution function for finding the electrons at @xmath4 irrespective of @xmath3 , and @xmath17 is the conditional distribution function for finding the electrons at @xmath3 provided that they are found at @xmath4 .",
    "( here and henceforth , when we speak of the probability of finding the electrons at a point , we actually mean in an infinitesimal neighborhood around that point . )",
    "the normalization of @xmath18 , @xmath19 automatically implies the normalization of @xmath20 , @xmath21 and the _ local _ normalization of @xmath17 , @xmath22 following hunter @xcite , we introduce the mcf of the internal eigenfunction @xmath23 by defining marginal and conditional _ amplitudes _",
    "@xcite @xmath24 @xmath25 such that @xmath26 @xmath27 [ from eq .",

    "thus , given the exchange symmetry of @xmath35 , this phase can be chosen to set the exchange symmetries of @xmath36 and @xmath37 , in the following way : noting that @xmath38 is always symmetric , for singlet states , where @xmath35 must be symmetric , @xmath39 can be chosen as symmetric ( antisymmetric ) to make both @xmath36 and @xmath37 symmetric ( antisymmetric ) ; for triplet states , where @xmath35 must be antisymmetric , @xmath39 can be chosen as symmetric ( antisymmetric ) to make @xmath36 symmetric ( antisymmetric ) and @xmath37 antisymmetric ( symmetric ) .",
    "fourth , the local normalization of @xmath37 ( eq . ( [ eq : normchi ] ) ) guarantees it to be nontrivial and unique , within the phase @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "fifth , @xmath37 is not _ globally _ normalizable despite the fact that @xmath35 is , since @xmath40 , with @xmath41 the volume of the @xmath42 subspace @xcite . finally , if @xmath43 had a node at , say , @xmath44 then @xmath45 would have to vanish at all @xmath3 [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : defpsi ] ) ] . moreover , for @xmath46 to remain finite as @xmath47 , @xmath31 would have to approach zero faster than @xmath48 at all @xmath3 in this limit [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : defchi ] ) ] , which is impossible .",
    "this constitutes a proof that marginal amplitudes must be nodeless , alternative to the one presented by hunter @xcite .",
    "we derive the equations that govern @xmath36 and @xmath37 from the variational principle , as follows .",
    "first , we set up the constrained functional @xcite @xmath49&\\equiv&\\int_0^{\\infty}dr_1r_1\\int_0^{\\infty}dr_2r_2\\left\\langle\\phi|\\hat{h}|\\phi\\right\\rangle\\nonumber\\\\ & -&\\int_0^{\\infty}dr_1r_1\\int_0^{\\infty}dr_2r_2\\lambda(r_1,r_2)\\left(\\left\\langle \\chi|\\chi\\right\\rangle-1\\right)\\nonumber\\\\ & -&\\epsilon\\left(\\int_0^{\\infty}dr_1r_1\\int_0^{\\infty}dr_2r_2|\\psi|^2 - 1\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the first term is the expectation value of the energy , the second term ensures the local normalization of @xmath46 at every point of the @xmath42 subspace , and the third term ensures the normalization of @xmath43 , with @xmath50 and @xmath51 being lagrange multipliers .",
    "then , we impose the extremization condition @xmath52 , which yields , after a convenient rearrangement , @xmath53 @xmath54 where @xmath55 @xmath56 here , the notation @xmath57 indicates that this operator contains @xmath43 and acts also on the @xmath9 variables . the fact that in eq .",
    "( [ eq : coneq ] ) @xmath1 and @xmath2 play the roles of parameters can be made more explicit by rewriting its left - hand side as @xmath58 , which means that @xmath1 and @xmath2 are fixed only after the operator has acted on @xmath37 .",
    "equations ( [ eq : mareq ] ) and ( [ eq : coneq ] ) constitute a pair of _ exact _ coupled pseudoeigenvalue equations with the following characteristics .",
    "first , since the operators on their left - hand sides are hermitian the eigenvalues @xmath51 and @xmath59 are real .",

    "third , the presence of the logarithmic derivatives of @xmath36 in the second term at the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : defomega ] ) makes them nonlinear , which implies that their solution requires an iterative self - consistent scheme .",
    "( for mathematical caveats about this kind of problem , see ref .",
    "@xcite . ) finally , the eigenvalue @xmath59 and the lagrange multiplier @xmath50 are related by @xmath60 consequently , by substituting eq . ( [ eq : defu ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eq : mareq ] ) and taking into account eq .",
    "( [ eq : normpsi ] ) we see that @xmath61 .",
    "furthermore , with some additional manipulation we obtain that @xmath62 .",
    "therefore , @xmath63 can be interpreted as a local energy , i.e. , the energy of the system when the electrons are positioned at @xmath4 .    in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mareq ] ) @xmath64 , as given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : t0 ] ) , represents the kinetic energy of two electrons in a central field . on the other hand , according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : coneq ] ) @xmath65 , so this function carries all the information about the electron - nucleus attractions , electron - electron repulsion , and kinetic couplings , averaged over @xmath3 .",
    "hence , in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mareq ] ) @xmath59 plays the role of an effective radial potential that , nonetheless , correlates the electrons fully .",
    "consequently , eq . ( [ eq : mareq ] ) constitutes an _ exact _ central - field model for @xmath0 states .",
    "in addition , since this is a schrdinger equation for @xmath66 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : qmardist ] ) ) , we observe that the energy is a functional of the marginal distribution function , which from now on we will call the radial distribution .",
    "equations ( [ eq : mareq ] ) and ( [ eq : coneq ] ) are arranged in a form analogous to hunter s nonadiabatic electronic - nuclear separation @xcite , which , in turn , is a sort of exact version of the bo approximation . thus , @xmath3 and @xmath9 are the analogs of the electronic and the nuclear coordinates , respectively , and @xmath67 , @xmath64 and @xmath68 are the analogs of the clamped - nuclei hamiltonian ( with the electron - nucleus attractions included ) , the nuclear kinetic energy operator , and the molecular napes .",
    "consequently , we will refer to our @xmath59 as the _ atomic _ napes . by the same token , @xmath37 and @xmath36",
    "are analogous to the electronic and the vibrational eigenfunctions .",
    "nevertheless , it must be kept in mind that , due to the uniqueness of the mcf , there can be only one marginal (  vibrational \" ) eigenfunction , with energy @xmath7 , associated with this atomic napes , in contrast with the molecular bo case , where the pes can sustain several vibrational states with different energies .",
    "we applied the foregoing formalism to the ground state of he .",
    "the solution to the nonlinear system of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : mareq ] ) and ( [ eq : coneq ] ) is a difficult problem @xcite that lies beyond the scope of this work . since our main goal is to learn about the topography of the atomic napes and its dependence upon the interparticle correlations , we employed these equations for the purposes of analysis only . therefore , we extracted approximate marginal and conditional amplitudes , using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : defpsi ] ) and ( [ eq : defchi ] ) , choosing @xmath69 , from variationally optimized trial functions , and then evaluated approximate atomic napes s by @xmath70 , in accordance with eq .",
    "( [ eq : coneq ] ) .    in order of increasing account of the coulomb correlation ,",
    "the optimized trial functions selected were @xmath71 with @xmath72 , @xmath73 ; @xmath74 with @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 ; and @xmath78,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 .",
    "expression ( [ eq : ke ] ) is the familiar kellner uncorrelated function , whereas expressions ( [ eq : li ] ) and ( [ eq : hy ] ) are of the hylleraas type , with linear and quadratic polynomial correlation factors , respectively @xcite . for these trial functions the expectation values of the energy turn out to be @xmath86 hartree , respectively @xcite , which increasingly approach the reported  exact \" energy @xcite",
    "of course , much better trial functions than ( [ eq : hy ] ) can be devised @xcite , but this level of approximation suffices for our largely qualitative analysis .    before presenting the results , we must qualitatively compare the spatial behavior of the functions ( [ eq : ke])-([eq : hy ] ) .",
    "first , we recall that , strictly , the correlation factor in a trial function should go to a constant as @xmath87 ( which can occur only when @xmath88 and/or @xmath89 ) , because in this limit the electrons are uncorrelated . hence , the only function that fulfills this condition is ( [ eq : ke ] ) . in fact , the correlation factors of functions ( [ eq : li ] ) and ( [ eq : hy ] ) diverge in this limit .",
    "( however , the full trial functions remain well behaved because the exponential factor damps the divergence . )",
    "thus , in regions of large @xmath1 and/or large @xmath2 the uncorrelated function ( [ eq : ke ] ) actually provides a much better approximation to the exact wavefunction .",
    "on the other hand , close to the nucleus the correlated functions ( [ eq : li ] ) and ( [ eq : hy ] ) provide better approximations .",
    "very close to the nucleus , function ( [ eq : hy ] ) should provide a better approximation than function ( [ eq : li ] ) , but at sufficiently long distance from the nucleus the situation should reverse , since the divergence of ( [ eq : hy ] ) is stronger .",
    "hence , we will confine our comparison of the napes s extracted from these functions to a region relatively close to the nucleus , which is where the electron correlation plays an important role , anyway .",
    "second , the correlation factor of function ( [ eq : hy ] ) also has corrections in @xmath1 and @xmath2 , which ( [ eq : li ] ) does not have .",
    "therefore , due to the interplay of these characteristics , at a particular point @xmath4 it is difficult to predict which napes will be more accurate , although , evidently , the one evaluated with function ( [ eq : hy ] ) should be more accurate overall , since it provides the best energy .",
    "trial functions with polynomial correlation factors , in spite of their wrong asymptotic behaviors , are advantageous to us because they permit analytical evaluations of @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath68 .",
    "for this task , we employed _ mathematica 10.3.1 _ @xcite .",
    "however , we do not provide the expressions here , since some of them are too formidable . as a check",
    ", we also reevaluated the energies by means of the expression @xmath90 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : mareq ] ) ) , which had to be performed numerically , employing the same software ; the values obtained turned out to be the same as the ones reported above .",

    "all quantities are given in atomic units .",
    "the innermost contour has a value of @xmath91 hartree and contour values increase outwards in intervals of 0.5 . ]",
    "figure [ fig : fig-1_salas ] displays the approximate atomic napes evaluated with the trial function ( [ eq : hy ] ) . several features stand out .",
    "first , @xmath68 has negative values everywhere , except for the steep repulsive walls at small @xmath1 or @xmath2 .",
    "second , it contains a ridge along @xmath92 , which asymptotically goes to zero very slowly .",
    "( strictly speaking , exactly at @xmath92 the value of @xmath68 is undetermined , an artifact of the approximate @xmath35 employed .",
    "we obtained these values by a simple interpolation .",
    "the same observation applies to the napes that will be obtained later from the trial function ( [ eq : li ] ) ) .",
    "third , this ridge separates two basins with minima of @xmath93 hartree positioned at @xmath94 bohr , and asymptotic values of @xmath95 hartree .",
    "fourth , there is a saddle point of @xmath96 hartree positioned at @xmath97 bohr , which , along the minimum - energy path , lies at the top of a barrier of height @xmath98 hartree located in between the two minima .",
    "a classical molecularlike interpretation of this topography is as follows .",
    "the atomic napes is associative , as it should since we are dealing with a bound state .",
    "the minima correspond to two versions of the same equilibrium structure , with the two electrons on respective  bohrian \" orbits of radii 0.26 and 0.43 bohr .",
    "these versions are interconvertible by a degenerate rearrangement through the saddle point @xcite , the latter corresponding to a transition structure with the two electrons on the same ( unstable ) orbit of radius 0.32 bohr .",
    "the stable orbits can perform highly anharmonic  breathing \" motions , which are analogous to molecular bond stretching modes . since the spatial part of the eigenfunction is symmetric under permutation of @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : hy ] ) ) , these breathings occur in phase , analogously to a molecular symmetric stretching mode .",

    "figure [ fig : fig-2_salas ] shows the results .",
    "( we chose the size of the region exhibited in accordance with the effective range of the radial distribution , as discussed below . )",
    "we see that the three surfaces are very similar , which means that the topography of the napes is not very sensitive to the degree of correlation in the wavefunction . as the electron correlation in the trial function increases ,",
    "the only trend we can discern is that the basins become more anharmonic , which implies that the amplitudes of the breathings of the orbits get larger .",

    "to assess the roles of the coulomb interactions in shaping the topography of the atomic napes , first we calculated surfaces with the electron - nucleus attractions , @xmath100 , removed from @xmath67 [ see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : defomega ] ) and ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) ] , for the three trial functions . as observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig-3_salas ] , the wells disappear , i.e. , the basins become valleys , and , consequently , @xmath68 becomes dissociative .",
    "moreover , as the degree of correlation carried by the trial function increases , the maximum on the ridge slightly shifts towards shorter distance from the nucleus .",
    "then , we calculated surfaces with both @xmath100 and @xmath13 removed from @xmath67 , which means that the only couplings remaining are the kinetic ones .",
    "now , in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig-4_salas ] we see that the ridge disappears and a single shallow well remains , whose bottom corresponds to an equilibrium configuration with both electrons on the same orbit of radius @xmath101 0.9 bohr .",
    "furthermore , as the degree of correlation increases , such well becomes more anharmonic .",
    "thus , the kinetic couplings play a small stabilizing role in the atom , since this surface is associative , and contribute to the anharmonicity of the basins present in the napes ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig-2_salas ] ) .",
    "naturally , the electron - nucleus attractions play the major stabilizing role , manifested by the presence of the deep wells in the napes ( see fig . [",

    "fig : fig-2_salas ] and [ fig : fig-3_salas ] ) .",

    "fig : fig-6_salas ] and [ fig : fig-8_salas ] ) , provide a convenient framework for discussing issues of electron correlation , symmetry breaking , and quantum phase transition .",
    "three alternative mcf s can be defined , which allow one to focus on complementary aspects .",
    "first , the mcf @xmath139 yields the napes @xmath140 , which is useful for analyzing the spatial behavior of the coulomb hole @xcite .",
    "in addition , such napes , together with the marginal distribution @xmath141 , should also provide a more complete picture of the correlation - induced symmetry breaking underlying the quantum phase transitions that have been observed in coulomb three - body systems @xcite .",
    "second , from the mcf @xmath142 the density @xmath143 used extensively in an _ ad hoc _ way by berry and coworkers @xcite can be obtained simply as @xmath144 followed by the transformation @xmath145 . in this case , an atomic nonadiabatic potential energy _ curve _",
    "( napec ) @xmath146 can also be extracted @xcite .",
    "finally , the mcf @xmath147 generates the napec @xmath148 , which can be used to generalize the molecular - orbital - like method of feagin and briggs , initially devised for the classification of doubly excited states of he @xcite , to cases where the @xmath3 coordinate can not be treated as adiabatic , as in the ground and singly excited states of this atom and other three - particle systems @xcite .",
    "further insight can be gained by working with the hyperspherical coordinates @xmath149 , @xmath150 @xcite , instead of the hylleraas coordinates @xmath9 . in particular , the mcf @xmath151 produces the napec @xmath152 , whose adiabatic counterpart has been extensively used for the classification of states of coulomb three - particle systems @xcite .",
    "( we would like to clarify that what is often called the  potential surface \" in this connection is not a pes in the sense used in this paper , but rather the sum of all the coulomb potentials appearing in the hamiltonian expressed in hyperspherical or jacobi coordinates . )",
    "ludea and coworkers @xcite have discovered that the topologies of non - bo one - particle nuclear and electron densities for few - body systems depend upon the reference points selected for the definitions of these quantities .",
    "this non - uniqueness weakens the notion that elements of molecular structure can be extracted from the patterns exhibited by the densities @xcite . here",
    ", the mcf can come to the rescue since one can define a density for any particle by marginalizing the variables associated with the other particles , and , as we have seen , marginal distributions are uniquely defined .",
    "all these constitute topics for future research .",
    "we must emphasize that the implementation of this methodology does not rely on finding solutions of coupled marginal and conditional equations , such as ( [ eq : mareq ] ) and ( [ eq : coneq ] ) , which appears to be a very difficult nonlinear problem @xcite .",
    "instead , these equations are used for extracting and analyzing information contained in wavefunctions that can be generated by other , more practical means , such as the variational trial functions ( [ eq : ke])([eq : hy ] ) .",
    "thus , the extension of this methodology to more complex systems seems quite feasible .",
    "one of the issues we plan to address in the near future is whether atoms with more than two valence electrons in their ground states possess well - defined geometrical shapes or behave analogously to fluxional molecules @xcite .    in conclusion",
    ", we believe we have taken a first step in developing a research program aimed at unifying the treatment of atoms , molecules , and other collections of quantum particles , where the concept of pes , with the associated notion of geometrical shape , in the sense employed in the molecular sciences , can play a key role ."
