    "the _ capella _  system ( @xmath0 aurigae = hr 1708 = hd 34029 ) , consisting principally of two nearby cool giant stars ( g1  iii + g8  iii ) forming a spectroscopic binary , has long been a popular object because it is a bright target at virtually all energies . in the far ultraviolet ( 9001200 ) , _ capella _",

    "four individual telescopes cover the wavelength range 9051187  and they are denoted by the coatings on their optical elements : lif1 , lif2 , sic1 and sic2 .",
    "spectra from each channel are imaged onto two detector segments , labelled a and b so that the eight individual spectra are termed lif1a , lif1b , sic1a , etc .",
    "three apertures are available for observing : in order of decreasing size these are the lwrs , the mdrs and the hirs . for the two smaller apertures , there is a risk of losing the target in the aperture during the observation , but they have the advantage of lower airglow contamination compared to the lwrs and so are preferred for , e.g. , the study of the hydrogen lyman series lines .    within a single spectrum ,",
    "the relative wavelength calibration is good to 510  km / s , but the absolute wavelength calibration of _ fuse _  is not well determined as there is no onboard calibration lamp .",
    "the wavelength scale can be fixed , however , by making use of interstellar absorption lines which have a velocity known from other methods . for emission line sources such as cool stars",
    ", the lack of a continuum means that such absorption lines are not common .",
    "the two most commonly observed are 977.020  and 1036.337  which are superimposed upon the corresponding stellar emission lines .",
    "they potentially allow the wavelength scale to be set for all channels except lif2a and lif1b .",

    "the _ capella _",
    "spectrum is strikingly similar to the solar spectrum both in terms of the relative strengths of the stronger lines and the strengths of the numerous weaker features .",
    "the central differences lie in the broader line profiles and the presence of @xmath6974 ( discussed later ) in _ capella_. some lines are proportionately weaker or stronger in the _ capella _ spectrum , for example the lines at 922924  are stronger which may indicate abundance anomalies in the g8 giant as suggested in linsky et al .",
    "the broader lines found in _",
    "capella _ are due both to the combined emission from the two giants and the intrinsically larger broadening of the g1 lines .",
    "we draw attention to the recombination continuum extending below @xmath8  to @xmath9  which is seen clearly in both spectra .",
    "several absorption lines can be seen superimposed on this continuum and these , together with the interstellar absorption lines , will be discussed in a later paper ( s.  redfield et al . , in preparation ) .",

    "the drop in the @xmath6977 flux in the second lwrs observation ( sect .",

    "capella_. this reduction in the observed strength of the 1175.711  line compared to the optically thin case has been observed in solar spectra taken near the limb which indicate that the @xmath61175.711/@xmath61174.933 ratio can fall to 50% of the optically thin value ( doyle & mcwhirter 1980 ) .",
    "further work is required to model radiative transfer in the lines .",
    "the ly@xmath0 line of _ capella _  has been extensively studied in the past from _ copernicus _ , _ iue _ , and ghrs data .",
    "a key feature is that the red peak of the line is stronger than the blue peak at all orbital phases ( ayres  1993 ) , suggesting that there is an outflow leading to preferential weakening of the blue wing of the line ( dupree  1975 ; ayres  1993 ) .",

    "( the thermal width of the line is expected to be 79 kms@xmath7  which becomes 82 kms@xmath7  when broadened by the instrumental profile taken as 20 kms@xmath7 . )",
    "this narrow width indicates that the emission originates principally from only one of the two giants . if the nearby @xmath6977 interstellar line ( expected at a heliocentric radial velocity of @xmath1@xmath22  kms@xmath7 , linsky et al .",

    "these values are in reasonable agreement with the _ fuse_measurements ( table  1 ) , although the @xmath130% difference for the @xmath61032 line is larger than the expected absolute flux accuracy of both instruments ( @xmath110% ) .",
