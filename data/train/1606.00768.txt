    "two - dimensional electron gases ( 2degs ) occuring at surfaces of semiconductors have been studied since many years due to their rich phenomenology and extreme technological relevance @xcite .",
    "the 2degs arise following subsurface confinement of conduction electrons caused by an electric field . a characteristic quasi-2d surface electronic structure ( a set of 2d subbands )",
    "is then observed .",
    "depending on the semiconductor doping the phenomenon may take the form of the charge accumulation or the charge inversion layer .",
    "a few crystals host native charge accumulation / inversion layers at their surfaces , notably inas , cdo , inn , in@xmath0o@xmath1 , and srtio@xmath1 . in many other cases the layers can be intentionally engineered , using adsorbates .",
    "analogous phenomena are found at many interfaces @xcite .",
    "theoretical modeling of the 2degs builds upon the assumption that the surface electrostatic potential is screened by a degenerate electron gas residing in a subsurface potential well .",
    "this is formulated as a 1d self - consistent poisson - schrdinger problem .",
    "the problem has been solved iteratively @xcite and also using the modified thomas - fermi approximation ( mtfa ) @xcite .",
    "these two strategies have been found equivalent @xcite .",
    "however , angle - resolved photoelectron spectroscopy ( arpes ) experimental tests of the 2deg band structure have shown that the subband energies are not described well by the models @xcite .",
    "it has been then proposed that taking into account many - body interactions could resolve the problem @xcite . however , these interactions are known to be negligible @xcite at least in some of the problematic 2deg systems .",
    "thus today , nearly 50 years after the first experimental evidence of 2deg @xcite , there is still no complete understanding of the 2deg systems .    in the present paper",
    "we revisit the problem by combining experimental and theoretical studies .",
    "experimental arpes results and theoretical calculations within the schemes mentioned above @xcite , are brought into harmony after considering adequate boundary conditions for the 2deg wave functions at the surface .",
    "these boundary conditions are traced back to the nontrivial potential interpolation between the crystal and vacuum",
    "we focus on inas , as it is probably the best studied material showing native accumulation layers  @xcite , having as well a large technical application potential @xcite . the band bending at inas surface",
    "depends on its orientation and reconstruction as well as on adsorbates @xcite .",
    "we use sulfur treatment on the ( 001 ) surface in order to control the bending @xcite .",
    "our samples are nominally undoped , n - type inas(001 ) wafers with a donor concentration of @xmath2 @xmath3 .",
    "sputtering of the surfaces is avoided , as it produces many electrically active defects in the subsurface region @xcite .",
    "the samples are treated with a hcl - ipa solution in 5n nitrogen atmosphere , rinsed by ipa , blown dry , and transferred to ultra - high vacuum without being exposed to atmospheric air , then annealed to prepare in and as terminated surfaces @xcite .",
    "a s@xmath4 beam is generated using an electrochemical cell @xcite .",
    "the s - adsorbed surfaces are annealed in steps to increasingly higher temperature and their reconstructions are monitored using leed .",
    "most of arpes studies are done using he i@xmath5 radiation , at 80 k. variable photon - energy arpes spectra are acquired at ape beamline at elettra storage ring in trieste ( italy ) .",
    "we study a few differently reconstructed surfaces , prepared with s adsorption on both in and as - terminated inas(001 ) .",
    "little is known about their atomic structures @xcite but it is not crucial for our discussion , as only values of the total band bending explicitly enter the model under consideration .",
    "a very important observation is that , due to the relatively low processing temperatures @xcite , the doping density in the subsurface region remains unchanged for all samples studied and equals that of the bulk .",
    "thus unnecessary complications such as uncertain @xmath6 ( see below for the definition ) and unbound - charge screening effects are eliminated on the experimental level .",
