    "an additional benefit here is that since the mechanical damping rate @xmath55 is small , the cooperativity of the system can reach a much larger value ( in the strong coupling limit , @xmath165 can reach @xmath166 ) . thus the entanglement can easily reach @xmath167 ( as shown in fig .",

    ", the two - cavities - plus - mechanics scheme in the main text requires one to optically damp the mechanical damping @xmath55 to a large value .",
    "while the above features are extremely attractive , the downside of this scheme comes when one considers the non - resonant , counter - rotating terms . for the setup discussed in the main text ( two cavities , one mechanical resonator ) ,",
    "the counter - rotating terms only lead to a very small heating of the coupled @xmath49 mode , much like standard optomechanical cavity cooling ( c.f .",

    "there are two sets of non - resonant , counter - rotating terms .",
    "the first are diagonal terms `` , where , e.g. , the cavity drive at @xmath169 induces stokes scattering with mechanical resonator 1 . in our rotating frame , these take the form : @xmath170we also have non - resonant off - diagonal '' terms where now , e.g. , the cavity drive at @xmath171 induces both stokes and anti - stokes scattering involving mechanical resonator @xmath11 .",

    "if one wants a large squeeze parameter @xmath66 , one will need to be extremely far into the good - cavity limit to suppress the deleterious effects of the non - resonant terms .    to estimate",
    "how far one needs to be in the good cavity limit in this 2-mechanical resonator setup , note that the terms in @xmath182 that contain @xmath183 , @xmath184 ( and their hermitian conjugates ) will cause negative damping of the @xmath61 modes .",

    "this is the central idea lying in previous works of dissipation generated entanglement ( see . e.g. ref [ 21 - 22 ] in the main text ) .",
    "however , in our setup , one of the bogoliubov modes @xmath47 is decoupled from the intermediate mode ( cf .",

    "<S> thus , while even vacuum noise tends to heat @xmath49 , @xmath47 to an exponentially - large effective temperature , the optomechanical interaction of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : hintbog ] ) can be used to cool @xmath49 . using the inequality of duan et al . </S>",

    "<S> nonetheless , we find that simply cooling @xmath49 _ is _ sufficient to generate a steady state with significant entanglement ( @xmath77 in the large @xmath66 limit ) ; this is despite the fact that the resulting state has negligible overlap with a two - mode squeezed vacuum ( see epaps  @xcite ) .    to rigorously quantify the cavity - cavity entanglement </S>",

    "<S> the solid lines correspond to different choices of the damping ratio @xmath79 as indicated ; increasing @xmath79 increases the amount that one can cool the delocalized @xmath49 mode , and hence enhances entanglement . for large @xmath78 , these curves asymptote to the value in eq .  </S>",

    "<S> ( [ eq : hint ] ) . in particular , if @xmath27 is fixed , the amount of stationary entanglement is a _ non - monotonic function _ of the entangling - interaction strength @xmath26 ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : figure2 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the dissipative entanglement mechanism discussed here directly explains this behaviour , as increasing @xmath26 has two opposing effects : it not only increases @xmath66 and the delocalization of the bogoliubov modes ( enhancing entanglement ) , but also increases the effective temperature of these modes . </S>",
    "<S> this latter effect is due both to an increase in the effective temperature of the cavity vacuum noise ( c.f .  </S>",
    "<S> eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ n00f ] ) ) , and to a suppression of the cavity - cooling effect ( as the effective coupling @xmath81 decreases with increasing @xmath26 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the maximum entanglement is achieved by carefully balancing the opposing tendencies described above ; without this optimization , the entanglement will remain small . for fixed couplings </S>",
    "<S> @xmath82 , one can optimize the entanglement as a function of the mechanical damping @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> the maximum occurs at a _ non - zero _ dissipation strength , which at zero mechanical temperature and in the good - cavity limit is simply given by @xmath83 . </S>",
    "<S> this value simply minimizes the occupancy of @xmath49 , and corresponds to a simple impedance matching condition ( i.e.  the rate with which the @xmath49 mode and mechanics exchange energy matches the rate at which the mechanics and its bath exchange energy ) .    </S>",
    "<S> more relevant to experiment is to consider @xmath53 and @xmath55 fixed , and optimize the entanglement over coupling strength . </S>",
    "<S> focusing on the most interesting regime where the cooperativity @xmath84 , and considering the good - cavity limit and zero temperature ( the mechanical resonator is also cooled to vacuum by the 3rd cavity mode ) , we find that for fixed @xmath26 , the optimal @xmath27 is given by @xmath85 note that for large @xmath78 , this optimal value can easily correspond to a strong interaction @xmath86 . </S>",

    "<S> the amount of entanglement here increases monotonically from @xmath92 ( the maximum possible with a coherent coupling ) as this cooling factor is increased .    </S>",
    "<S> the behaviour of the stationary entanglement versus coupling strength is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : figure2 ] , where we have used parameters similar to those achieved in recent state - of - the - art experiments on microwave - circuit optomechanical systems @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that a @xmath93 mechanical resonator is first cavity cooled to near its ground state , with a final damping rate of @xmath94 ( which is predominantly due to the cold optical damping used for the cooling ) . </S>",
    "<S> by then optimally tuning the couplings to the target modes @xmath82 to optimize the dissipative entanglement mechanism ( while keeping them @xmath95 ) , one can obtain a relatively large @xmath96 . </S>",
    "<S> this exceeds by an order - of - magnitude the intra - cavity entanglement obtained in previous studies of the same system @xcite , as well as the the maximum of @xmath92 possible with a coherent two - mode squeezing interaction . </S>",
    "<S> if this entanglement was used for a teleportation experiment , the maximum possible fidelity would be @xmath97  @xcite ; this reduces the error by a factor of three compared to what would be possible with @xmath80 . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : figure2 ] also shows that large values of @xmath32 are possible even when @xmath98 and @xmath99 .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : figure3 ] we show how the stationary entanglement grows to dramatically large values with @xmath78 for an optimized choice of @xmath27 . while the parameters needed for such @xmath32 may be out of reach in current - generation optomechanics experiments , they may be more feasible by implementing a superconducting circuit realization of our scheme @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> _ conclusions _ we have presented a general method for the dissipative generation of entanglement in a three - mode optomechanical system . the entanglement generated here could be verified by measuring the covariance matrix of the two target cavity modes using homodyne techniques ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , one could directly use the cavity output spectra at resonance to measure the occupancy of the @xmath49 mode ; verifying that it violates the duan inequality of eq .  </S>",
