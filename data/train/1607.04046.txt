    "the standard model ( sm ) of elementary particle physics , which is based on the gauge group @xmath5 is very successful in explaining the fundamental interactions of nature . with the recent discovery of higgs at lhc",
    ", the sm seems to be complete .",
    "however , it has certain limitations .",
    "for example , the muon @xmath1 anomaly , which is a discrepancy between the observation and sm measurement with more than @xmath6 confidence level  @xcite .",
    "similarly , it does not explain sub - ev masses of active neutrinos as confirmed by long baseline oscillation experiments  @xcite .",
    "moreover , it does not accommodate any particle candidate of dark matter ( dm ) whose existence is strongly supported by galaxy rotation curve , gravitational lensing and large scale structure of the universe  @xcite . in fact , the dm constitutes about @xmath7 of the total energy budget of the universe as precisely measured by the satellite experiments wmap  @xcite and planck  @xcite .    at present lhc",
    "is the main energy frontier and is trying to probe many aspects of physics beyond the sm . an attractive way of probing new physics is to search for a @xmath8-gauge boson which will indicate an existence of @xmath9 symmetry . within the sm , we have accidental global symmetries @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the baryon number , and @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the total lepton number .",
    "note that @xmath10 and @xmath12 are anomalous and can not be gauged without adding any ad hoc fermions to the sm .",
    "however , the differences between any two lepton flavours , i.e. , @xmath14 , with @xmath15 , are anomaly free and can be gauged without any addition of extra fermions to the sm . among these extensions",
    "the most discussed one is the gauged @xmath16  @xcitethe interactions of corresponding gauge boson @xmath8 are restricted to only @xmath17 and @xmath18 families of leptons and therefore it significantly contribute to muon @xmath1 anomaly , which is a discrepancy between the observation and sm measurement with more than @xmath6 confidence level .",
    "moreover , @xmath8 does not have any coupling with the electron family .",
    "therefore , it can easily avoid the lep bound : @xmath19 tev  @xcite .",
    "so , in this scenario a @xmath8- mass can vary from a few mev to tev which can in principle be probed at lhc and at future energy frontiers .    in this paper",
    "we revisit the gauged @xmath0 model in light of muon @xmath1 anomaly , neutrino mass and dm phenomenology .",
    "we augment the sm by including three right handed neutrinos : @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , which are singlets under the sm gauge group , and a vector like colorless neutral fermion @xmath23 .",
    "we also add an extra sm singlet scalar @xmath24 .",
    "all these particles except @xmath20 , are charged under @xmath0 , though singlet under the sm gauge group .",
    "when @xmath24 acquires a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) , the @xmath0 breaks to a remnant @xmath25 symmetry under which @xmath23 is odd while all other particles are even . as a result @xmath23 serves as a candidate of dm .",
    "the smallness of neutrino mass is also explained in a type - i see - saw framework with the presence of right handed neutrinos @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 whose masses are generated from the vev of scalar field @xmath24 .    in this model",
    "the relic abundance of dm ( @xmath23 ) is obtained via its annihilation to muon and tauon family of leptons through the exchange of @xmath0 gauge boson @xmath8 .",
    "we show that the relic density crucially depends on @xmath0 gauge boson mass @xmath26 and its coupling @xmath27 .",
    "in particular , we find that the observed relic density requires @xmath28 for @xmath29 mev .",
    "however , if @xmath30 then we get an over abundance of dm , while these couplings are compatible with the observed muon @xmath1 anomaly .",
    "we resolve this conflict by adding an extra singlet scalar @xmath31 doubly charged under @xmath0 , which can drain out the large dm abundance via the annihilation process : @xmath32 . as a result",
    ", the parameter space of the model satisfying muon @xmath1 anomaly can be reconciled with the observed relic abundance of dm .",
    "we further show that the acceptable region of parameter space for observed relic density and muon @xmath1 anomaly is strongly constrained by null detection of dm at xenon-100  @xcite and lux  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the compatibility of the present framework with indirect detection signals of dm is also checked . in particular , we confront the acceptable parameter space with the latest positron data from pamela  @xcite , fermi - lat  @xcite and ams-02  @xcite .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows . in section - ii",
    ", we describe in details the different aspects of the model .",
    "section - iii is devoted to show the allowed parameter space from muon @xmath1 anomaly . in section - iv",
    ", we estimate the neutrino mass within the allowed parameter space .",
    "section v , vi and vii are devoted to obtain constraints on model parameters from the relic density , direct and indirect search of dm . in section - viii",
    ", we lay the conclusions with some outlook .",
    "we consider the gauge extension of the sm with extra @xmath0 symmetry ( from now on referred to as `` gauged @xmath0 model '' ) where difference between muon and tau lepton numbers is defined as a local gauge symmetry  @xcite .",
    "the advantage of considering the gauged @xmath0 model is that the theory is free from any gauge anomaly without introduction of additional fermions .",
    "we break the gauge symmetry @xmath0 to a residual discrete symmetry @xmath25 and explore the possibility of having non - zero neutrino mass and a viable candidate of dm .",
    "the spontaneous symmetry breaking of gauged @xmath0 model is given by : @xmath33 where @xmath34    at first , the spontaneous symmetry breaking of @xmath35 is achieved by assigning non - zero vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) to complex scalar field @xmath24 and @xmath31 .",
    "the subsequent stage of symmetry breaking @xmath36 is obtained with the sm higgs @xmath37 providing masses to known charged fermions .",
    "the complete spectrum of the gauged @xmath0 model in light of dm and neutrino mass is provided in tablei where the respective quantum numbers are presented under @xmath38 . to the usual quarks and leptons ,",
    "we have introduced additional neutral fermions @xmath39 for light neutrino mass generation via seesaw mechanism and a vector like dirac fermion @xmath23 for the candidate of dm , being odd under the residual discrete symmetry @xmath25 .",
    "we note that except @xmath23 all other particles are even under the @xmath25 symmetry .",
    "[ tab : sm ]    .particle content of the minimal @xmath40 gauge extension of the sm and their transformation under the sm gauge group . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we discussed a gauged @xmath41 extension of the sm in light of the non - zero neutrino mass , dm and the observed muon @xmath1 anomaly which is a more than @xmath2 discrepancy between the experimental measurement and the sm prediction .",
    "in adition to that , three right handed neutrinos @xmath39 and a dirac fermion @xmath23 were introduced which are charged under @xmath41 symmetry except @xmath20 which is a complete singlet fermion .",
    "the @xmath41 was allowed to break to a survival @xmath25 symmetry at a tev scale by giving vev to a sm singlet scalar @xmath24 which bears an unit @xmath42 charge .",
    "the vev of @xmath24 gave masses not only to the additional gauge boson @xmath43 , but also to the right handed neutrinos : @xmath39 .",
    "as a result , below electroweak symmetry breaking , the light neutrinos acquired masses through the type - i seesaw mechanism . under the survival @xmath25 symmetry , @xmath23 was chosen to be odd while rest of the particles were even .",
    "thus @xmath23 became an excellent candidate of dm .",
    "we obtained the relic abundance of dm via its annihilation to muon and tauon families of leptons through the exchange of @xmath43 gauge boson .",
    "it is found that for @xmath43 mass greater than 100 mev and its coupling to leptons : @xmath44 correct relic abundance can be obtained . on the other hand , the muon @xmath1 anomaly required smaller values of the gauge coupling @xmath45 for @xmath43 mass greater than 100 mev ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : mz_copling ] ) .",
    "so the two problems could not be solved simultaneously .",
    "therefore , we introduced an additional scalar @xmath31 which is doubly charged under @xmath41 but singlet under the sm gauge group . in presence of @xmath31 ,",
    "the dm dominantly annihilates to @xmath31 fields . as a result we found a large region of parameter space in which the constraints from muon @xmath1 anomaly and relic abundance of dm could be satisfied simultaneously .",
    "the hitherto null detection of dm at direct search experiments , such as lux , also give strong constraints on the model parameters as discussed in fig .",
    "[ fig : mz_copling ] .",
    "we found that for @xmath43 mass greater than 100 mev we need the corresponding gauge coupling : @xmath46 .",
    "in fact such values of @xmath45 hardly agree with muon @xmath1 constraint .",
    "however , in presence of @xmath31 we can allow small values of the gauge coupling @xmath45 which can satisfy muon @xmath1 anomaly while direct detection limit can be satisfied through @xmath47 mixing diagram .",
    "the annihilation of dm to only muon and tauon families of leptons dictates its nature to be leptophilic .",
    "so , the observed positron flux by pamela , fermi - lat and recently by ams-02 in the cosmic ray shower with suppressed anti - proton flux could be explained in our model .",
    "we showed in fig .",
    "[ ams2 ] that the constraints from muon @xmath1 anomaly and ams-02 positron excess can be satisfied simultaneously in our model .",
