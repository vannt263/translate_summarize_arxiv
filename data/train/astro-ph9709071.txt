    "5c is rather uncertain due to the difficult determination of the profile .",
    "the fwhm s of he ii and of the @xmath34640 blend seem to decrease beginning on may 1991 .",
    "anyway , the lack of spectroscopic observations after may 19 , 1991 does not allow us to fully confirm this trend .",
    "this fact would indicate that during the decline the emission region moves inward in the disk , that is , towards larger keplerian velocity radii .",
    "however we note that x  ray novae may present opposite behaviours .",
    "some objects , like v518 per ( shrader et al . 1994 ) and gro j1655 - 40 ( bianchini et al . 1997 ) , show emission lines with decreasing widths with the time ; some other ones , like gu mus ( this work ) , v404 cyg ( gotthelf et al . 1992 ) and v616 mon ( whelan et al . 1977 ) show emission lines which become larger and larger during the decline .    to investigate this point we plot in fig .",

    "the errors on log(_l@xmath67 _ ) are mainly due to the uncertainty on the distance of the objects ( see table 5 ) , while those affecting fwhm ratios are originated by the signal  to  noise ratio of the spectra . the long  dashed line represents the weighted least ",

    "6 suggests a peak luminosity @xmath14@xmath69 erg s@xmath23 for the case fwhm@xmath65/fwhm@xmath66=1 .",
    "this value of the luminosity approximately represents the eddington luminosity of sxts .",
    "we note that the behaviour of the sub ",
    "eddington objects would typically represent the one it is expected from the outburst caused by an enhancement of mass transfer from the secondary .",
    "actually , former disk instability event has only triggered the mass transfer paroxism .",
    "in fact , during the early outburst the disk becomes smaller because of the very large flow of low angular momentum material from the x  ray heated secondary ; so we may observe larger emission lines . during the decline the disk relaxes and the emission region will expand again towards lower keplerian velocities as it was suggested for gro j1655 - 40 by bianchini et al .",
    "( 1997 ) .    for super ",
    "eddington objects , like gu mus , accretion from the inner regions of the disk should be inhibited and the disk itself might be partially disrupted .",
    "more likely , we might argue that at super  eddington accretion luminosities the disk turns its structure into a ` geometrically thick ' one ( see e.g. frank et al .",
    "1992 ) , in which only the outer cooler regions can be seen at almost all inclinations . in this case , at light maximum the line emitting region is placed at quite large radii , thus producing narrower emission lines than during the decline , when a ` standard ' disk is formed again .",
