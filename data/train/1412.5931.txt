    "the mechanisms generating these patterns of correlated activity , also called resting - state functional networks are largely unknown .",
    "it has been suggested that they reflect a complex interplay between brain structural connections and the dynamics of interacting neuronal units @xcite .",
    "theoretical models of the large - scale brain resting - state activity have explored the range of conditions that might govern intrinsic brain processes and contribute to the generation of correlated fluctuations between segregated brain areas @xcite .",
    "particular attention has been paid to the properties of the network dynamics that enable the emergence of a metastable state , which represents the network s tendency to switch between synchronized and desynchronized states and thus , explore different network configurations @xcite .",
    "one approach to observe metastable network states in brain dynamics is to consider self - sustained oscillatory local neural dynamics and neural signal transmission delays in the interactions between network elements @xcite .",
    "similarly , the coupling strength and signal transmission delays in the interactions between noise - driven neural oscillators , enable generation of the spatio - temporal correlated low - frequency ( @xmath0 0.1 hz ) fluctuations in the dynamics of the resting brain @xcite .",
    "other important ingredients of the large - scale brain dynamics models are complex brain network interactions expressed usually in the form of the connectivity matrix .",

    "we combine these approaches to investigate properties of the network dynamics that underlie patterns of spatio - temporal correlations of resting - state functional networks .",
    "in addition , we consider the contribution of the long - distance functional interactions i.e. those that are not supported by direct neural paths between the interacting brain areas . in our previous work @xcite , we have shown that the long - distance functional correlations may emerge from relay - like interactions between neural oscillators that share large parts of their individual network neighborhoods . here",

    "our approach is similar to those of ghosh and colleagues @xcite , however , different in the two main model ingredients : ( i ) we use a connectivity matrix derived from diffusion weighted brain imaging data , and ( ii ) we take into account functionally realistic network interactions that are also supported by physical ( structural ) connections .",

    "the matrix entries represent pairwise temporal correlation coefficients between rois mean bold time series estimated from the total scanning time ( 7.5 minutes ) .    to derive the coupling topology for the network model used in the simulations , we combined structural and functional connectivity matrices in the following way .",
    "given the statistical nature of fc and acp entries we first applied a binarization method to extract only statistically significant connections . by doing that we also took into account the conditions that allow comparisons between brain structural and functional networks @xcite .",
    "binarization is done by applying thresholds @xmath1 and @xmath2 for the fc and acp matrix , respectively .",
    "if matrix values are greater than or equal to the threshold values , then the corresponding element of the adjacency matrix is set to 1 ; otherwise it is set to 0 . for the fc matrix , we have used thresholds in the interval @xmath3 $ ] , and for the acp matrix only one value @xmath4 ( see fig .",
