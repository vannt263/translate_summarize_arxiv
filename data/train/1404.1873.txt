    "the long - standing goal of studying the production in high energy heavy ion collisions of @xmath4 bound states , known collectively as charmonium , has been to use the modification of their yield as a direct signal of deconfinement in the quark gluon plasma ( qgp )  @xcite .",
    "practically , the study of charmonium has been confined to the two lowest mass vector meson states , the strongly bound and the much more weakly bound . in pursuit of this goal , the production of has been studied at center of mass energies of = 17.3gev in  @xcite ,  @xcite , and  @xcite collisions ; at = 19.4gev in collisions  @xcite ; at = 200gev in  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite and  @xcite collisions ; and at = 2.767tev in  @xcite ,  @xcite and  @xcite collisions .",
    "only one heavy ion on heavy ion collision system has asymmetric masses , at 19.4gev , and that measurement was made at only one rapidity ( 0@xmath5@xmath6@xmath51 ) .",
    "the studies of collisions at these and other energies were motivated by the need to understand cold nuclear matter ( cnm ) effects  @xcite .",
    "these are effects that modify production in a nuclear target in the absence of a qgp , and they are found to be very significant at all of these energies  @xcite .",
    "cnm effects often considered include nuclear modification of the parton distributions in nuclei ( npdfs ) , break up of the precursor @xmath4 state in the cold nucleus , nuclear transverse momentum broadening in traversing the cold nucleus , and initial state parton energy loss  @xcite .",
    "it has been hoped that cnm effects and hot matter effects can be factorized , so that cnm effects can be measured in collisions and accounted for when analyzing heavy ion collision data to extract hot matter effects .",
    "this has not yet been clearly established .",
    "the recent observation of what appears to be collective flow in @xcite and @xcite collisions has called into question whether cnm effects are really isolated from hot matter effects in collisions .",
    "evidence that production is not modified by hot matter effects in collisions comes from the observation  @xcite that break up cross sections fitted to shadowing corrected data from collisions at mid and backward rapidity scale with time spent in the nucleus across a broad range of collision energies .",
    "this observed scaling would presumably be broken if production was modified by different hot matter effects at different collision energies .",
    "however unexpectedly strong suppression of the has been observed in both  @xcite and @xmath7@xmath2pb  @xcite collisions , and so far this is unexplained . since feed down from decays contributes only 10% to the yield",
    ", it is possible that the weakly bound is sensitive to hot matter effects in collisions while the inclusive yield is not .",
    "there are additional data from collisions at lower collision energies @xcite . taken together with the data sets mentioned above , they cover a broad range of rapidities and values . to try to shed some light on the nature of cnm effects on production",
    ", these data have been described using models containing gluon shadowing / antishadowing plus break up of the charmonia precursor state by collisions with nucleons  @xcite and/or models of energy loss in cold nuclear matter  @xcite or gluon saturation models  @xcite .",
    "a broad picture now seems to have emerged .",
    "the precursor to the fully formed charmonium is a @xmath4 state , formed primarily by gluon fusion , that becomes color neutral and expands to the final size of the meson on a time scale of a few tenths of a fm/@xmath8 .",
    "when the proper time ( in the @xmath4 frame ) spent in the target nucleus is comparable with the charmonium formation time ( which occurs at lower energies and at midrapidity , and at higher energies only at backward rapidities ) , the modification is well described by shadowing plus break up by nucleons   @xcite .",
    "when the time spent in the target nucleus is shorter than this ( which occurs at higher energies , and at lower energies only at forward rapidity ) , the data are well described by models of shadowing plus energy loss or gluon saturation  @xcite .",
    "thus at rhic energy ( = 200gev ) cold nuclear matter effects are believed to result from a variety of different mechanisms , and the mixture depends very strongly on rapidity .",
    "hot matter effects and cnm effects are present together in heavy ion collisions , and both are important . in collisions at rhic , for example , the addition of hot matter effects increases the suppression of the by a factor of roughly two over what would be expected if only cnm effects were present  @xcite .",
    "moreover , in asymmetric mass collisions such as cu+au the distribution of final state energy is a function of rapidity @xcite , as reflected in the particle production .",
    "thus hot matter effects will likely not be symmetric in rapidity .",
    "cold nuclear matter effects will also be asymmetric in rapidity .",
    "first , the parton distribution functions are more strongly modified in the heavier au nucleus .",
    "forward rapidity ( cu - going ) production probes gluons at low bjorken-@xmath3 ( _ i.e. _ low momentum fraction ) in the au nucleus , while in cu the gluons at high bjorken-@xmath3 are probed .",
    "this is reversed for the backward rapidity ( au - going ) .",
    "second , energy loss and breakup effects will be different in nuclei of different mass . in the case where the charmonium is emitted at forward rapidity",
    "it has a large rapidity relative to the au nucleus , which it crosses in a very short proper time . at the same time",
    ", the rapidity relative to the cu nucleus is much smaller , and the crossing time is much larger . because the different time scales lead to different mechanisms ,",
    "energy loss effects will depend on the interaction between the charmonium precursor state and the au nucleus , while breakup effects will depend on the interaction between the precursor and the cu nucleus .",
    "for charmonium emitted at backward rapidity , this will be reversed .",
    "thus the asymmetry in mass between cu and au will lead to asymmetric energy loss and breakup contributions at forward and backward rapidity .",
    "forward versus backward rapidity production in asymmetric mass collisions will therefore contain different contributions from both hot matter effects and cnm effects .",
    "there are also simple geometric models separating core - corona contributions that would be useful to confront with data in central cu+au  @xcite .",
    "the comparison of , and modifications across rapidities may provide key insight on the balance of cold and hot nuclear matter effects , and whether they are truly factorizable .    a heavy ion collision system with asymmetric masses , ,",
    "was studied experimentally for the first time at rhic in the 2012 run . in this paper",

    "the phenix detector recorded events at @xmath9=200gev during the 2012 data - taking period at the relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven national laboratory .",
    "the detector is shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : detector ] .",
    "global event information is obtained from the beam - beam counters ( bbc ) , which comprise two arrays of 64 quartz erenkov counters that measure charged particles within the pseudorapidity range ( @xmath10@xmath5@xmath11@xmath5@xmath12 ) .",
    "the bbc provides the primary level-1 trigger for minimum bias events , requiring two or more hits on each side of the interaction point and a fast reconstructed event vertex located along the beam direction within @xmath1330 cm of the nominal center of the phenix acceptance . for this analysis ,",
    "20.7 billion ( @xmath14=4.3nb@xmath15 ) sampled minimum bias events were used within @xmath1330 cm .",
    "the corresponding n+n integrated luminosity used is 53pb@xmath15 .    for the data set used in this analysis the primary level-1 trigger from the bbc",
    "is required to be in coincidence with an additional level-1 trigger , requiring two muon candidates to penetrate fully through the muon identifier .",
    "the trigger logic for a muon candidate requires a road of fired iarocci tubes in at least four planes , including the most downstream plane relative to the collision point .",
    "muons at forward rapidities are reconstructed in this analysis using the south and north ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : detector ] ) muon spectrometers .",
    "the muon spectrometers comprise four sub - components : a steel absorber , a magnet ( one per spectrometer ) , a muon tracker ( mutr ) , and a muon identifier ( muid ) .",
    "a detailed description of the muon detectors is given in  @xcite . in 2010",
    ", an additional 36.2 cm of steel absorbers ( @xmath16=2.3 ) were added to help increase the relative yield of muons compared to hadronic background .",
    "this additional material decreases the efficiency of the low-@xmath17 muons which punch through all muon arm materials by @xmath1830%40% .",
    "the minimum momentum for a muon to reach the outermost muid plane is 3  gev/@xmath8 .",
    "three sets of cathode strip chambers ( mutr ) , inside the muon magnet , follow the absorber material which are used to measure the momentum of tracks within the detector volume .",
    "the final component ( muid ) comprises alternating steel absorbers and iarocci tubes , which further reduce the number of hadronic tracks which punch through the initial layers of absorber material and masquerade as muons .",
    "the events are sorted into centrality classes using the combined charge from both bbc counters .",
    "the number of participating nucleons ( ) and number of binary collisions ( ) in each centrality class is obtained from a monte carlo glauber calculation  @xcite folded with a negative binomial distribution that is fitted to the measured bbc charge distribution in the charge range where the bbc trigger is fully efficient . for peripheral events where the minimum bias trigger is not fully efficient",
    ", the efficiency is obtained from a comparison of the measured bbc charge distribution to the negative binomial distribution .",
    "the minimum bias trigger is determined to fire on 93%@xmath133% of the inelastic cross section .",

    "the condition of a minimum internucleon distance was removed such that nucleons are allowed to overlap in the initial nucleon distribution .",

    ", we use a simple glauber model that combines gluon modifications as a function of bjorken @xmath3 and @xmath39 , taken from the eps09 shadowing parametrization @xcite , and a single effective @xmath4 break up cross section ( 4 mb ) that approximately reproduces the nuclear modification observed in phenix data across all rapidities   @xcite .",
    "it should be emphasized that this simple model uses a constant effective @xmath4 cross section to account for nonshadowing effects at all rapidities , while in fact both breakup and energy loss contributions are expected to be rapidity dependent .",
    "thus the calculation reflects only the expected difference in shadowing between forward and backward rapidity in .",

    "[ fig : ratio ] indicates that the size of the expected shadowing difference is comparable with the effect seen in the data , and has the same sign .",
    "hot matter effects are expected to be greater at backward rapidity in collisions , where the particle multiplicity should be about 20% higher in the au - going direction than in the cu - going direction  @xcite .",
    "increased suppression due to higher energy density at backward rapidity would lead to an increase in the ratio shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio ] . increased recombination effects may also occur at higher energy density ( see for example  @xcite ) , increasing the yield and tending to decrease the ratio shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio ] .    the new rapidity dependent data presented here form part of a large data set at rhic energies that includes , , and collision data .",
    "these nuclear modification data result from a varied mix of energy densities and cold nuclear matter effects , providing a broad range of conditions with which to confront models of production .",
    "we have measured the centrality dependence of production in asymmetric cu+au collisions .",
    "we find the centrality evolution of the nuclear modification ( ) at backward rapidity to be similar to that measured in au@xmath2au collisions at the same number of participants , while at forward rapidity ( the cu - going direction ) it is significantly smaller . at backward rapidity , in the most central 10% collisions , = 0.271@xmath130.012@xmath130.042 . at forward rapidity",
    "the suppression is on average about 20% stronger in the centrality range 0%40% , while for the most peripheral collisions the ratio is consistent with unity within systematic uncertainties .    the difference between forward ( cu - going ) and backward ( au - going ) modification is found to be comparable in magnitude and of the same sign as the expected difference from shadowing effects .",
