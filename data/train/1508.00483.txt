    "the attractive coulomb interaction between conduction band electrons and valence band holes plays a crucial role in forming the bosonic electron - hole ( e - h ) bound pairs @xcite ( excitons ) .",
    "the bose - einstein condensation of the excitons represents a very interesting subject in solid state physics .",
    "mostly , the e - h systems are realized in photoexcited semiconducting materials and the properties of such systems strongly depend on the e - h density , temperature of the system , pressure , and other important physical quantities .",
    "there is a number of works , both experimental and theoretical , where all those effects are investigated intensively .",
    "@xcite low density system of excitons behaves like the usual bose gas , and , at cryogenic temperatures , the bec transition can be expected .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , the high density system of bound e - h pairs behaves like the system of usual cooper pairs in superconductors .",
    "@xcite in this limit we have the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) state of e - h pairs .",
    "@xcite despite many experimental investigations to observe the coherent exciton condensates @xcite there is not yet definitive evidence for such states .",
    "therefore , an expected bcs - bec crossover represents actually a fascinating problem typical to the excitonic systems.@xcite especially , it is interesting from the viewpoint of the difference from the similar crossover in superconductors or trapped atomic fermi gases .",
    "@xcite the transition to the e - h pair condensed phase , in the limit of weak - coupling , is related to the relative motion between electrons and holes,@xcite implying the bcs regime and is in contrast to the case of strong - coupling regime , when the bec state is related to the motion of the center of mass of excitons . @xcite in the whole bcs - bec transition region , the e - h mass difference leads to a large suppression of the bec transition temperature , which is proved to not be same as the temperature of excitonic pair ( ep ) formation , and hence the excitonic insulator ( ei ) phase .",
    "@xcite recently , it is shown theoretically that the excitonic insulator and the excitonic condensate are not exactly the same states of the matter.@xcite the author in refs . and shows from general considerations that in the low density limit of the excitonic pairs , the critical temperature of excitonic condensation should be much smaller than the temperature of ep formation , in contrast to the previous treatments , @xcite where the ei state is ad hoc associated with the bec state of excitons as the same .",
    "similarly , in ref .",
    "it is shown that the ei state is an excitonium state , where incoherent e - h bound pairs are formed and , furthermore , at the lower temperatures , the bec of excitons appears in consequence of the reconfiguration and coherent condensation of the preformed excitonic pairs .",
    "obviously , in the low density limit , the gas of free excitons undergoes the bec phase transition at the very low temperatures , and in general the bec temperature transition line is not coinciding with that of ep formation .",
    "the bose condensation of excitonic pairs is possible only when the macroscopic phase coherence is attended by the system .",
    "@xcite however , the experimental evidence of the existence of two distinct transition temperatures , for the general case of a three dimensional ( 3d ) bulk system , is yet lacking in the literature .",
    "in fact , the question , whether a true , `` coherent '' bec transition is present in the system of excitons , ( in the case of high exciton density limit ) is still ambiguous .",
    "the experimental proof of it , is a very cumbersome problem , because of dominant role of quantum fluctuations at low temperatures @xmath0 ( with @xmath1 being the binding energy of a mott - wannier exciton ) , when very large zero - point oscillations are present .",
    "the continuing growing interest , to the problem of the coherent excitonic condensates motivates us to calculate excitonic spectral functions and density of states , as a direct probe mechanism , to compare the results with the high - resolution studies of angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) @xcite , and with spectral weight measurements on the excitonic materials at the very low temperatures .",
    "the general strategy of our calculations is based on the effective actions method .",
    "first , we transform the initial total action of the system to a gauge invariant form , by applying the u(1 ) gauge transformation to the fermion operators . as a result",
    ", the electron appears in the theory like a composite object of that of the fermion with the attached u(1 ) phase-``flux - tube '' .",
    "the electron factorization in terms of two variables has an unprecedented impact on the whole theory .",
    "then we integrate out the phase variables and we get the effective fermionic action in the theory and we derive a set of self - consistent equations for the ei state . furthermore , we discuss shortly the results of the quantum rotor model obtained after the integration of fermionic degrees of freedom .",
    "the path - integral formalism elaborated here permits to calculate the correlation functions in the system and , as a result , we obtain the expressions of normal ( both incoherent and coherent ) and anomalous excitonic spectral functions , and shapes of density of states ( dos ) corresponding .",
    "a special attention is payed , when calculating the bosonic phase - stiffness dos function , which is negative .",
    "furthermore , it is crucial for calculation of the coherent normal and anomalous excitonic dos functions .",
    "namely , considering the expressions of the bosonic and fermionic dos functions , we calculate the total , phase coherent dos functions , as convolutions from bosonic and fermionic counterparts .",
    "for the incoherent partial normal fermionic dos functions at @xmath2 we obtain a hybridization - gap in the excitation spectra as a direct consequence of the presence of the hartree - type gap in the single - particle energy scales .",
    "for the case of coherent normal and anomalous excitonic dos functions , this hybridization - gap is absent totally for all frequency modes and for all values of the coulomb interaction .",
    "this is due of strong coherence effects in the strongly correlated fermion system at low temperatures and at low densities . for the anomalous excitonic dos function",
    ", we found that the hybridization - gap is absent for the case of small and intermediate values of the coulomb interaction parameter , but there is a finite constant small gap that is opening in the strong coupling regime , signaling the passage to the sc ( bec ) side of the sc - sm phase transition ( the bcs - bec crossover ) .    the paper is organized as follows : the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : section_2 ] we introduce the model hamiltonian and we discuss the main calculation schemes . in section [ sec : section_3 ] , we describe the ei state , with a short discussion about important energy scales in the system . in section",
    "[ sec : section_4 ] we present the analytical calculation of spectral functions and dos functions of the system in consideration . at the end of the section [ sec : section_4 ]",
    "we show the results of numerical evaluations for calculated dos functions .",

    "the on - site ( local ) coulomb interaction @xmath18 in the last term of the hamiltonian in eq.([equation_1 ] ) plays the coupling role between two bands . as we will see later on",
    ", the strength of the local coulomb interaction will tune the semi - metal ( sm)- semiconductor ( sc ) transition in the system .",

    "naturally , we adjust the chemical potentials @xmath22 and @xmath23 in order to maintain the number of electrons in @xmath6 and @xmath7 orbitals separately .",
