    "the laser interferometer space antenna ( lisa ) is a joint nasa ",
    "esa deep - space mission to be launched after 2012 , aimed at detecting and studying gravitational waves ( gws ) with frequencies between @xmath0 and @xmath1 hz @xcite .",
    "lisa will provide access to gw sources that are outside the reach of ground - based interferometric gw detectors @xcite , such as the binaries of compact stellar objects in our galaxy , the mergers of massive and supermassive black holes , and the gravitational captures of compact objects by the supermassive black holes at the center of galaxies @xcite .",
    "lisa consists of three widely separated spacecraft , flying around the sun in a quasi - equilateral triangular configuration and exchanging phase - coherent laser signals .",
    "lisa relies on picometer interferometry to measure gws as modulations in the distance between the spacecraft .",
    "the greatest challenge to achieving this measurement is the phase noise of the lisa lasers , which is larger than the gw - induced response by many orders of magnitude , and which can not be removed by conventional phase - matching interferometry because the lisa armlengths are grossly unequal , and changing continuously . _",
    "time delay interferometry _ ( tdi ) , developed by j. w. armstrong , f. b. estabrook , m. tinto , and others @xcite , is the lisa - specific technique that will be used to combine the laser - noise  laden one - way phase measurements performed between the three spacecraft into virtual interferometric observables where laser noise is reduced by several orders of magnitude .",
    "tdi was initially developed using _",
    "ad hoc _ algebraic reasoning for the case of a stationary lisa configuration with unequal but constant armlengths ( _ first - generation _ tdi , see @xcite ) .",
    "it was later modified to work also in the case of a rotating lisa constellation ( _ modified _ tdi , see @xcite ) and of linearly changing armlengths ( _ second - generation _ tdi , see @xcite ) .",
    "first - generation and modified tdi were given a rigorous mathematical foundation in the theory of algebraic syzygies on moduli @xcite , providing tools to generate all possible tdi observables , and to determine which observables are optimally sensitive to gws @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , this algebraic treatment can not be extended easily to second - generation tdi , which is the version that must be used in practice .    in this paper ,",
    "i give a new derivation of first - generation , modified , and second - generation tdi , using a _ geometric _ approach that emphasizes the physical interpretation of tdi observables as synthesized interferometric measurements @xcite , extending it to all known observables .",
    "what is more , this geometric approach to tdi ( in short , _ geometric tdi _ ) allows the exhaustive enumeration of all tdi observables of any length , and it leads to alternative , improved forms of the standard tdi observables , characterized by better gw sensitivity at high frequencies in realistic noise conditions , by lesser demands on the measurement system , and by reduced susceptibility to gaps and glitches .    more specifically , all tdi observables display nulls in their noise and gw responses at frequency multiples of the inverse arm - crossing light times . because these zeros occur at the same frequencies and with the same orders for noise and gws , the _ ideal _ gw sensitivity after successful laser - noise suppression is finite , and comparable to the sensitivity at nearby frequencies .",
    "the _ actual _ sensitivity , however , is likely to be degraded , either because noise _ leaks _ into the nulls from the sides @xcite , or because the measurement system has insufficient dynamical range to resolve the tiny signals within the nulls .",
    "this problem is mitigated with the alternative observables , which have half as many response - function nulls as the standard forms .",
    "in addition , because the alternative observables are , as it were , folded versions of their standard forms , they have a smaller temporal footprint : that is , they are written as sums of one - way phase measurements that span a shorter time period .",
    "this property can be advantageous in the presence of instrumental gaps or glitches , which would then contaminate a smaller portion of the data set ; a reduced temporal footprint means also that a shorter continuous set of phase data needs to be collected before tdi observables can begin to be assembled .    ,",

    "how is lisa an interferometer other than by name ?",
    "the loosest dictionary definition of `` interferometer '' ( something like `` a device that combines the signals radiating from a common source , and received at different locations , or at the same location after traveling different paths '' ) does not seem to apply to lisa , whose tdi gw observables are combinations of the phase - difference measurements between as many as six laser sources .",
    "in fact , interferometry is not needed , strictly speaking , to measure gws , but only to remove the otherwise deafening phase noise produced by the lisa lasers .",
    "the basic principle of gw measurement employed by lisa is noninterferometric , as we can see from the idealized experimental setup of a _ time - transport link _ between two ideal clocks ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : gedank ] ) .",
    "consider a plane gw propagating across the minkowski background geometry , and written in the transverse - traceless gauge @xcite .",
    "the wave is traveling along the @xmath3 direction , and has `` @xmath4 '' polarization along the @xmath5 and @xmath6 directions .",
    "we can then write the spacetime metric as @xmath7 , where @xmath8.\\ ] ] consider also two ideal clocks 1 and 2 , marking their proper times @xmath9 and @xmath10 , and sitting at constant spatial coordinates @xmath11 and @xmath12 in the tt frame . in this gauge ,",
    "constant - coordinate worldlines are geodesics , so the effect of the gws is not to exert forces ( as it were ) on test particles , but to modulate the distance between them . by way of light signals ,",
    "clock 1 is continuously sending its time @xmath9 to clock 2 , where @xmath9 is compared with the local time @xmath10 , yielding the difference @xmath13 here @xmath14 is the tt coordinate time and @xmath15 is the time of flight between the two clocks , as experienced by the laser pulse that arrives at clock 2 at time @xmath14 .",
    "we are assuming that the two clocks have been synchronized so that in the absence of gws they both mark the coordinate time @xmath14 .",
    "to first order in @xmath16 , @xmath15 is @xmath17 the @xmath3 coordinate dependence of the gw does not appear in eq . because the two clocks sit on the same constant-@xmath3 wavefronts .",
    "if the rates of the two clocks remain synchronized ( @xmath18 ) , then the time derivative @xmath19 is directly proportional to difference of the gw strains at the events of pulse reception and emission , @xmath20.\\ ] ] _ this is our gw observable .",
    "_ in the fourier domain , the ( power ) response function of @xmath21 to gws is @xmath22 .",
    "thus @xmath21 is insensitive to gws of frequencies @xmath23 or @xmath24 ( with integer @xmath25 ) .",
    "expression is the basic building block used to derive the lisa response to gw waves , as well as the doppler response used in spacecraft - tracking gw searches @xcite , and the timing - residual response used in pulsar - timing searches @xcite .    to relate this idealized experimental setup to lisa",
    ", we replace the ideal clocks with the lisa lasers , and obtain proper time by dividing the lasers phase by their frequency .",
    "each of the three lisa spacecraft contains two optical benches oriented facing the other two spacecraft ; on each bench , the appropriately named _",
    "phasemeters _ compare the phase of the incoming lasers against the local reference laser . as written , eq .",
    "involves a comparison of laser _ frequencies _ : we choose to develop our arguments in terms of these , since it is more convenient to deal with instrumental responses that are directly proportional to the physical observable of interest ( the gw strain ) rather than to its time integral .",
    "generalizing eq . to arbitrary plane - gw and spacecraft geometries , and adopting a lisa - specific language , we come to the estabrook  wahlquist two - pulse response @xcite @xmath26}{1 - \\hat{n}^m_{12}(t ) k_m}:\\ ] ] with this indexing , eq",

    ", it is customary to label the lisa arms by the index of the _ opposite _ spacecraft .",
    "we shall do so in this paper , using primed and unprimed indices to denote the _ oriented _ lisa arms ( with orientation following the direction of laser transmission ) according to the convention @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "we shall then denote by @xmath40 the propagation time experienced by a laser pulse traveling along the oriented arm @xmath41 .",
    "we shall also find it useful , at times , to augment the @xmath42 phase - measurement notation with a middle index , corresponding to the oriented arm traversed by the laser pulse being measured .",

    "we subtract the @xmath42 measurements , represented graphically by arrows , when they share the same event of emission or reception ( i.e. , when their arrowtails or arrowheads meet ) , and we add them when the receiving spacecraft of one measurement is the emitting spacecraft of the other ( i.e. , when arrowtail follows arrowhead ) .",
    "_ in all of these combinations , the laser - frequency noise @xmath46 generated at time @xmath14 on spacecraft 1 is canceled out _ by entering twice with opposite signs ; however , gws are not canceled ( not even at time @xmath14 ) , because they come into eq .   with different @xmath47-dependent projection factors .",
    "the combinations of fig.[fig : tdipaths ] do still contain frequency noise from lasers 2 and 3 , and from times other than @xmath14 ; it is however a simple leap to cancel even those by arranging together more measurements .",
    "we then formulate a    * geometric tdi principle * : to obtain a laser - noise - canceling gw observable , line up arrows ( i.e. , @xmath42 measurements ) head to head , tail to tail , or head to tail , creating a closed loop that cancels laser noise at all pulse emission and reception events . if no arrowhead or arrowtail is left unpaired , the closed loop represents a linear combination of delayed @xmath42 measurements that completely cancel the three laser noises @xmath43 .    remarkably , it is usually possible to interpret each closed - loop combination as the interferometric measurement performed by comparing the phases of laser beams that follow the paths marked by the arrows .",
    "let us see an example .",
    "the arrows of fig .",
    "[ fig : michelson ] ( left panel ) reproduce the paths followed by light in an equal - arm michelson interferometer ; operating in analogy with fig .",

    "by contrast , the head - to - head difference of two such double arrows simulates a photodetector : it reproduces the difference of the phase shifts accumulated along the two paths .",
    "all in all , eq . shows that the combination of four ( one - way ) @xmath42 measurements can _ synthesize _ the phase - difference output of a michelson interferometer , as emphasized by tinto and armstrong @xcite , and shown graphically by shaddock @xcite and summers @xcite .",

    "right._for unequal armlengths , laser - phase  noise cancellation can be recovered by having both interfering beams travel along each arm once , building up the same light - travel time .",
