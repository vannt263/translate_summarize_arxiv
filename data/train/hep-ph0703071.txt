    "<S> we use qcd sum rules to study the possible existence of @xmath0 mesons , assumed to be a state with @xmath1 . for definiteness , we work with a current with an axial heavy diquark and a scalar light antidiquark , at leading order in @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the contributions of condensates up to dimension eight . </S>",
    "<S> for the @xmath3-quark , we predict @xmath4 , which is below the @xmath5 threshold . for the @xmath6-quark </S>",
    "<S> , we predict @xmath7 , in agreement with quark model predictions .    </S>",
    "<S> the general idea of possible stable heavy tetraquarks has been first suggested by jaffe @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the case of a tetraquark @xmath8 with quantum numbers @xmath9 and @xmath10 which , following ref.@xcite , we call @xmath11 , is especially interesting . as already noted previously @xcite , the @xmath12 and @xmath13 states can not decay strongly or electromagnetically into two @xmath14 or two @xmath15 mesons in the @xmath16 wave due to angular momentum conservation nor in @xmath17 wave due to parity conservation . </S>",
    "<S> if their masses are below the @xmath18 and @xmath19 thresholds , these decays are also forbidden . moreover , in the large @xmath20 limit , the light degrees of freedom can not resolve the closely bound @xmath21 system . </S>",
    "<S> this results in bound states similar to the @xmath22 states , with @xmath21 playing the role of the heavy antiquark @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the stability of @xmath22 implies that @xmath8 is also safe from decaying through @xmath23 . as a result , @xmath11 is stable with respect to strong interactions and must decay weakly .    </S>",
    "<S> there are some predictions for the masses of the @xmath11 states . in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the authors use a color - magnetic interaction , with flavor symmetry breaking corrections , to study heavy tetraquarks . </S>",
    "<S> they assume that the belle resonance , @xmath24 , is a @xmath25 tetraquark , and use its mass as input to determine the mass of other tetraquark states . </S>",
    "<S> they get @xmath26 and @xmath27 . in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the authors use one - gluon exchange potentials and two different spatial configurations to study the mesons @xmath13 and @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> they get @xmath28 and @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> there are also calculations using expansion in the harmonic oscillator basis @xcite , and variational method @xcite .    in this work we use qcd sum rules ( qcdsr ) </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , to study the two - point functions of the state @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> there are several reasons , why it is interesting to investigate this channel . </S>",
    "<S> first of all , having two heavy quarks , it is an explicit exotic state . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental observation would already prove the existence of the tetraquark state without any theoretical extrapolation . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , from a technical point of view , this means that there are no contributions from the disconnected diagrams , which are technically very difficulty to estimate in qcd sum rules or in lattice gauge theory calculation .    in previous calculations , </S>",
    "<S> the qcdsr approach was used to study the light scalar mesons @xcite the @xmath30 meson @xcite and the @xmath24 meson @xcite , considered as four - quark states and a good agreement with the experimental masses was obtained . </S>",
    "<S> however , the tests were not decisive as the usual quark  antiquark assignments also provide predictions consistent with data @xcite .    considering @xmath11 as an axial diquark - antidiquark state , a possible current describing such state is given by : j_=i[q_a^tc_q_b][|u_a_5 c|d_b^t ] , [ field ] where @xmath31 are color indices , @xmath32 is the charge conjugation matrix and @xmath33 denotes the heavy quark .    in general </S>",
    "<S> , one should consider all possible combinations of different @xmath34 four - quark operators , as was done in @xcite for the @xmath35 light mesons . </S>",
    "<S> however , the current in eq.([field ] ) well represents the most attractive configuration expected with two heavy quarks . </S>",
    "<S> this is so because the most attractive light antidiquark is expected to be the in the color triplet , flavor anti - symmetric and spin 0 channel @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is also expected quite naturally from the color magnetic interaction , which can be phenomenologically parameterized as , @xmath36 here , @xmath37 are the mass , color and spin of the constituent quark @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> eq.([color - magnetic ] ) favors the anti - diquark to be in the color triplet and spin 0 channel . </S>",
    "<S> the flavor anti - symmetric condition then follows from requiring anti - symmetric wave function of the anti - diquark . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , since the anti - diquark is in the color triplet state the remaining @xmath21 should be in the color anti - triplet spin 1 state . </S>",
    "<S> although the spin 1 configuration is repulsive , its strength is much smaller than that for the light diquark due to the heavy charm quark mass . </S>",
    "<S> therefore a constituent quark picture for @xmath11 would be a light anti - diquark in color triplet , flavor anti - symmetric and spin 0 ( @xmath39 $ ] ) combined with a heavy diquark of spin 1 ( @xmath40 $ ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the simplest choice for the current to have a non zero overlap with such a @xmath11 configuration is given in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ field ] ) . while a similar configuration @xmath41 is also possible @xcite , we believe that the repulsion in the strange diquark with spin 1 will be larger and hence energetically less favorable . </S>",
    "<S> as discussed above , since the quantum number is @xmath42 , the decay into @xmath43 or @xmath44 would be forbidden and the allowed decay into @xmath19 or @xmath5 would have a smaller phase space , and the tetraquark state might have a small width , or may even be bound .    the qcdsr is constructed from the two - point correlation function _ </S>",
    "<S> ( q)=id^4x  e^iq.x0 |t[j_(x)j^_(0 ) ]    is not conserved , the two functions , @xmath45 and @xmath46 , appearing in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 2po ] ) are independent and have respectively the quantum numbers of the spin 1 and 0 mesons .    the calculation of the phenomenological side proceeds by inserting intermediate states for the meson @xmath11 . parametrizing the coupling of the axial vector meson @xmath34 , to the current , @xmath47 , in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ field ] ) in terms of the meson decay constant @xmath48 and the meson mass @xmath49 as : [ eq : decay ] 0 | j_|t_qq = f_t m_t^4 _  , the phenomenological side of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 2po ] ) can be written as _ </S>",
    "<S> ^phen(q^2)=2f_t^2m_t^8m_t^2-q^2(-g_+ q_q_m_t^2 ) + , where the lorentz structure @xmath50 gets contributions only from the @xmath34 state . </S>",
    "<S> the dots denote higher axial - vector resonance contributions that will be parametrized , as usual , through the introduction of a continuum threshold parameter @xmath51 @xcite .    on the ope side </S>",
    "<S> , we work at leading order in @xmath2 and consider the contributions of condensates up to dimension eight . to keep the charm quark mass finite </S>",
    "<S> , we use the momentum - space expression for the charm quark propagator . </S>",
    "<S> we follow ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and calculate the light quark part of the correlation function in the coordinate - space , which is then fourier transformed to the momentum space in @xmath15 dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting light - quark part is combined with the charm quark part before it is dimensionally regularized at @xmath52 .    </S>",
    "<S> the correlation function , @xmath45 , in the ope side can be written as a dispersion relation : _ </S>",
    "<S> 1^ope(q^2)=_4m_q^2^ds ( s)s - q^2 , where the spectral density is given by the imaginary part of the correlation function : @xmath53 $ ] . after making a borel transform of both sides , and transferring the continuum contribution to the ope side </S>",
    "<S> , the sum rule for the axial vector meson @xmath11 up to dimension - eight condensates can be written as : 2f_t^2m_t^8e^-m_t^2/m^2=_4m_q^2^s_0ds   e^-s / m^2  ( s ) + _ 1^mix(m^2 ) , where ( s)=^pert(s)+^(s)+^g^2(s ) + ^mix(s)+^^2(s)+^mix(s ) , with [ eq : pert ] & & ^pert(s)=12 ^ 9 ^6_^ d^3 _ ^1-d^3(1 - - ) ^3 + & & , + & & ^(s)=0 , + & & ^g^2(s)=-2 ^ 10 ^ 6 \\{-14_^ d(1- ) ( m_q^2-(1-)s)^2 . </S>",

    "<S> the contribution of dimension - six condensates @xmath57 is neglected , since it is assumed to be suppressed by the loop factor @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> we have included , for completeness , a part of the dimension-8 condensate contributions . </S>",
    "<S> we should note that a complete evaluation of these contributions require more involved analysis including a non - trivial choice of the factorization assumption basis @xcite & & ^mix(s)=-2 ^ 6 ^ 2 , + & & _ </S>",
    "<S> 1^mix(m^2)=-m_q^22 ^ 53 ^ 2_0 ^ 1 d. [ dim8 ] in order to extract the mass @xmath49 without worrying about the value of the decay constant @xmath48 , we take the derivative of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ sr ] ) with respect to @xmath59 , divide the result by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ sr ] ) and obtain : m_t^2=_4 m_q^2^s_0ds  e^-s / m^2  s  ( s)_4 m_q^2^s_0ds  e^-s / m^2  ( s ) . </S>",
    "<S> this quantity has the advantage to be less sensitive to the perturbative radiative corrections than the individual moments . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we expect that our results obtained to leading order in @xmath2 will be quite accurate .    in the numerical analysis of the sum rules , </S>",
    "<S> the values used for the quark masses and condensates are ( see e.g. @xcite ) : @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 with @xmath64 , @xmath65 .    </S>",
    "<S> we start with the double charmed meson @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> we evaluate the sum rules in the range @xmath66 for @xmath51 in the range : @xmath67 gev .    comparing the relative contribution of each term in eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : pert ] ) to ( [ dim8 ] ) , to the right hand side of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ sr ] ) we obtain a quite good ope convergence ( the perturbative contribution is at least 50% of the total ) for @xmath68 gev@xmath69 , as can be seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figconvtcc ] . </S>",
    "<S> this analysis allows us to determine the lower limit constraint for @xmath70 in the sum rules window . </S>",
    "<S> this figure also shows that , although there is a change of sign between dimension - six and dimension - eight condensates contributions , the contribution of the latter is very small , where , we have assumed , in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figconvtcc ] to fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figmxb ] , the validity of the vacuum saturation for these condensates . </S>",
    "<S> the relatively small contribution of the dimension - eight condensates may justify the validity of our approximation , unlike in the case of the 5-quark current correlator , as noticed in @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we get an upper limit constraint for @xmath70 by imposing the rigorous constraint that the qcd continuum contribution should be smaller than the pole contribution . </S>",
    "<S> the maximum value of @xmath70 for which this constraint is satisfied depends on the value of @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison between pole and continuum contributions for @xmath71 gev is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figpvc ] . </S>",
    "<S> the same analysis for the other values of the continuum threshold gives @xmath72 gev@xmath69 for @xmath73 and @xmath74 gev@xmath69 for @xmath75 .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figmx ] , we show the @xmath13 meson mass obtained from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ m2 ] ) , in the relevant sum rules window , with the upper and lower validity limits indicated . from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figmx ] we see that the results are reasonably stable as a function of @xmath70 . in our numerical analysis </S>",
    "<S> , we shall then consider the range of @xmath70 values from 2.5 @xmath76 until the one allowed by the sum rule window criteria as can be deduced from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figmx ] for each value of @xmath51 .    </S>",
    "<S> we found that our results are not very sensitive to the value of the charm quark mass , neither to the value of the condensates . </S>",
    "<S> the most important source of uncertainty is the value of the continuum threshod and the borel interval . using the qcd parameters given above , </S>",
    "<S> the qcdsr predictions for the @xmath13 mesons mass is : m_t_cc = ( 4.00.2 )  , in a very good agreement with the predictions in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> one can also evaluate the decay constant , defined in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : decay ] ) , to leading order in @xmath2 : [ fx ] f_t_cc=(5.950.65)10 ^ -5  gev  , which can be more affected by radiative corrections than @xmath77 . in the case of the double - beauty meson @xmath12 , using consistently the perturbative @xmath78-mass @xmath79 , and the continuum threshold in the range @xmath80 , we find a good ope convergence for @xmath81 . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that the pole contribution is bigger than the continuum contribution for @xmath82 for @xmath83 , and for @xmath84 for @xmath85 .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figmxb ] we show the @xmath12 meson mass obtained from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ m2 ] ) , in the relevant sum rules window , with the upper and lower validity limits indicated . from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figmxb ] we see that the results are very stable as a function of @xmath70 in the allowed region . </S>",
    "<S> taking into account the variation of @xmath70 and varying @xmath51 and @xmath86 in the regions indicated above , we arrive at the prediction : m_t_bb= ( 10.20.3 )  , also in a very good agreement with the results in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . for completeness </S>",
    "<S> , we predict the corresponding value of the decay constant to leading order in @xmath2 : [ fxb ] f_t_bb= ( 10.42.8)10 ^ -6  gev  .    </S>",
    "<S> we have presented a qcdsr analysis of the two - point functions of the double heavy - quark axial meson , @xmath11 , considered as a four quark state . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the sum rules results for the masses of @xmath13 and @xmath12 are compatible with the results in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an improvement of this result needs an accurate determination of running masses @xmath87 and @xmath86 of the @xmath88-scheme and the inclusion of radiative corrections .    </S>",
    "<S> our results show that while the @xmath13 mass is bigger than the @xmath89 threshold at about 3.875 gev , the @xmath12 mass is appreciably below the @xmath90 threshold at about @xmath91gev . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , our results indicate that the @xmath12 meson should be stable with respect to strong interactions and must decay weakly . </S>",
    "<S> our result also confirms the naive expectation that the exotic states with heavy quarks tend to be more stable than the corresponding light states@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we present in eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fx ] ) , and ( [ fxb ] ) predictions for the decay constants of the @xmath13 and @xmath12 .    </S>",
    "<S> different choices of the four - quark operators have been systematically presented for the @xmath35 light mesons in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> though some combinations can provide a faster convergence of the ope , we do not expect that the choice of the operators will affect much our results , where , in our analysis , the ope has a good convergence . </S>"
