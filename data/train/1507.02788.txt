    "supernova remnant ( snr ) g332.5 - 5.6 was identified as an snr candidate by @xcite based on the morphology at 4.85 ghz and the lack of 60 @xmath8 m emission . @xcite and @xcite both analyzed the 1.4 and 2.4 ghz radio continuum data from australia telescope compact array and obtained an average radio spectral index of @xmath9 = -0.7 @xmath7 0.2 and @xmath9 = -0.6 @xmath7 0.1 respectively .",
    "@xcite analyzed the optical spectra of g332.5 - 5.6 and gave average ratios of [ nii]/h@xmath9 = 2.42 , [ sii]/h@xmath9 = 2.10 and [ sii]6717/6731 = 1.23 which are all well within the typical values of snrs .",
    "due to these evidences , the authors confirmed g332.5 - 5.6 as an snr .",
    "+ snr g332.5 - 5.6 has an angular size of about 30@xmath10 at radio wavebands with three main structures : two straight and nearly parallel outer filaments at northeast and southwest , an extended radio emission region at center with small angular internal substructures ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "g332.5 - 5.6 shows highly linear polarization of 0.3 - 0.5 at 2.4 ghz .",
    "@xcite mentioned that the high polarization might be artificial , because the q / u intensity images might have more small scale structures than the total intensity image and the lack of short baselines excludes more total intensity emission than q / u intensity emission .",
    "_ rosat _ pspc observation reveals strong x - ray emission from the center of the remnant , which has similar morphology with the central radio emission . besides a small bright point - like source in the northeastern filament ,",
    "the extended x - ray emission in the two outer filaments is weak ( see figure 7 of @xcite and figure 17 of @xcite ) .",
    "the central x - ray emission can be well fitted by the thermal raymond - smith model with a temperature of about 0.25 kev ( @xcite ) .",
    "neither a radio nor a x - ray pulsar is found in the vicinity of snr g332.5 - 5.6 .",
    "it seems that the central x - ray emission is not from a nonthermal pulsar wind nebular ( pwn ) but from cloud evaporation or thermal conduction ( @xcite ) .",
    "+ h@xmath9 filaments are detected mainly in the central region and match well with the radio structure ( @xcite ) .",
    "the spectra diagnosis of [ sii]6717/6731 suggests an average electron density of about 240 @xmath11 .",
    "the h@xmath12/h@xmath9 flux ratio indicates a reddening of @xmath13 = 0.27 towards g332.5 - 5.6 .",
    "these facts indicate the blast at the center of snr g332.5 - 5.6 is propagated into a cool and dense environment .",

    "x - ray imaging spectrometer ( xis ) observations of snr g332.5 - 5.6 to determine its basic parameters , e.g. shock velocity , age , evolutionary state and elemental abundances .",
    "we also re - estimate its distance and discuss the origin of its central x - ray emission .",
    "the central region of snr g332.5 - 5.6 was observed by the xis on board of _ suzaku _ , starting on 2007 august 18 at 16:39:41 and ending on 2007 august 19 at 20:57:24 ( observation i d 502066010 , pi : reynold s. ) .",

    "+ data reduction is performed using heasoft version 6.15 .",
    "we reprocess and screen the data with the command aepipeline by applying the up - to - date calibration file and then obtain an effective exposure time of 70.15 ks , 70.15 ks and 70.16 ks for xis0 , xis1 and xis3 respectively .",
    "xselect version 2.4c is employed to extract images and spectra .",

    "the northwestern part of g332.5 - 5.6 marked by the white curves in figures [ fig1](c ) and ( d ) is contaminated by stray light from a low mass x - ray binary 4u 1636 - 536 which is bright and about 50@xmath10 away from the g332.5 - 5.6 .",

    "then the snr and the background spectra are binned to a minimum of 25 counts per bin to achieve a signal to noise ratio of 5 .",
    "+ since we do not care for the real ingredient of off - snr , the nxb - subtracted xis0+xis3 and xis1 off - snr spectra are fitted phenomenologically and simultaneously with the model phabs*(vnei+powerlaw ) within 0.4 kev to 4.0 kev .",
    "the fitting is showed in figure [ fig3 ] with the reduced @xmath15 ( dof ) = 1.15 ( 198 ) .",

    "we first try to fit the spectra with single collisional ionization equilibrium ( cie ) models , vapec and vmekal .",
    "after several tests , we find that none of them can give acceptable fitting to the spectra ( both cie models have reduced @xmath15 @xmath16 1.43 and can not describe the spectra well in energy lower than 0.6 kev . ) . thus we then turn to the non - equilibrium ionization ( nei ) model , vnei , which is characterized by a constant temperature t and single ionization timescale @xmath17 with flexible elemental abundances .",
    "the ionization timescale is defined as @xmath17 = n@xmath18 t , where n@xmath18 is the post - shock electron density and t is the time since the passage of the shock .",
