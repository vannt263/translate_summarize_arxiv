    "brane - world models consider the four dimensional universe as a hyper - surface in a high dimensional bulk . in this scenario kaluza and",
    "klein tried to unify the electromagnetic and gravitational fields , using a compact extra dimension @xcite . since then , the property of fields and particles in the presence of compact extra dimensions has been studied and much is known on this subject today @xcite .",
    "the four dimensional world is obtained by expanding the extra dimensional dependence of the field in fourier modes , where each one is characterized by the integer @xmath1 .",
    "for example , a massless gauge field in five dimensions can generate a four dimensional one simply by considering the zero mode @xmath2 . from the action viewpoint ,",
    "the integral over the extra dimension is always finite since it is compact .",
    "therefore , it trivially gets a massless gauge invariant effective action . by the same reasoning",
    ", the extra dimensional dependence on the massive modes can also be integrated in the action , giving the tower of massive fields in four dimensions said before .",
    "gauge invariance can be used to fix the fifth component of the five dimensional gauge field to zero and therefore free fields are trivially obtained in four dimensions .    an alternative approach to compactification",
    "was proposed by randall and sundrum as a way to solve the hierarchy problem @xcite . in brane scenarios with extended extra dimension",
    "the four dimensional zero mode is not trivially obtained .",
    "since the extra dimension is infinity , the field must to be trapped in the membrane in order to recover the four dimensional physics .",
    "the pathway is to solve an effective schrdinger - like equation for the mass modes and verifying its square integrability .",
    "it is well know that in anti - de sitter bulk , as in randall - sundrum model ( rs ) , the gravity and the scalar fields are confined to the membrane @xcite .",
    "however , due to its conformal invariance the vector field is not localized , which is a serious problem for a realistic model .",
    "many solution has been proposed to solve this problem .",
    "for example , some authors introduced a dilaton coupling @xcite , and others like in @xcite proposed that a strongly coupled gauge theory in five dimensions can generate a massless photon in the brane .",
    "most of these models introduces other fields or nonlinearities to the gauge field @xcite .    in the pursue for a model without introducing new degrees of freedom , a topological mass term in the bulk has been used .",
    "but they were not able to generate a massless photon in the brane @xcite .",
    "however , it was shown by ghoroku et al that the addition of a mass term and a boundary mass term could solve the problem @xcite .",
    "this result was generalized to include @xmath0form fields @xcite , and more recently it was shown that the ghoroku model can be generated by coupling the mass term with the ricci scalar , this mechanism was called `` geometrical localization '' @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the same mechanism was proven to work for @xmath0forms and elko spinors @xcite .",
    "a similar mechanism , with a geometrical coupling in field strength , shows to be efficient to trap the zero mode of yang - mills field in ref .",
    "it is important to mention that a different coupling between gravity and the gauge field in rs scenarios has first been considered in ref .",
    "@xcite but localization was not fully obtained .",
    "after the work of rs several recent results have been developed based on the idea of thick membranes and its implications for brane - world physics @xcite .",
    "the advantage of these models is that the singularity generated by the brane is eliminated . in this scenario",
    "a transfer matrix method has been proposed to analyze resonances @xcite . in this direction",
    "the geometrical localization mechanism has provided analytical solutions for any smooth version of the rs scenario and for any @xmath0form @xcite ( for further analytic solutions see @xcite ) . when considering resonances with delta - like branes one needs to modify the transfer matrix procedure to consider a delta - like singularity in @xmath3 @xcite .    as showed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the geometric coupling traps the zero mode of all @xmath0form fields in branes with asymptotic randall - sundrum behavior , while for reduced @xmath4form only in special cases the zero mode are localized .",
    "it is also shown that the massive modes are non - localized . in this work",
    "we use the transfer matrix method to analyze the existence of unstable massive modes on the brane .",
    "we compute the transmission coefficient for some @xmath0forms in rs scenarios , in brane scenario generated by a domain - wall and generated by a kink in some number of bulk dimensions .",
    "this detailed numerical study provides some hints about the structure of resonances in the geometrical localization model .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii the geometrical localization mechanism is reviewed in order to obtain the effective potential of the schrdinger s equation for the @xmath0form and the reduced @xmath4 form . in the third section using this potential for rs scenario the transmission coefficient for some @xmath0forms and for some dimensions is calculated . in section four an specific smooth scenario generated by thick domain - walls",
    "is used to compute the transmission coefficient again considering different @xmath0forms and dimensions of the spacetime .",
