    "it is of great importance to understand structures of the pion and kaon , since they are regarded as the pesudo - goldstone bosons arising from the spontaneous breakdown of chiral symmetry ( sb@xmath0s ) .",
    "though there are many theoretical frameworks to study the pion and kaon such as chiral perturbation theory , qcd sum rules , and lattice qcd , the instanton - vacuum approach  ( see , for example , recent reviews  @xcite ) has certain virtues : first , it can be directly related to nonperturbative qcd , realizing well the mechanism of the sb@xmath0s with the quark zero modes .",
    "second , it has only two parameters : the average instanton size @xmath1 and average inter - instanton distance @xmath2 .",
    "thus , there is basically no free parameter in this approach .",
