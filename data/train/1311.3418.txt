    "<S> usually the charge and the energy of stable q - balls vary in a wide range or are even unbounded . in the present paper </S>",
    "<S> we study an interesting possibility that this range is parametrically small . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the spectra of stable q - balls look similar to the one of free particles .    among the variety of non - topological solitons ( see @xcite for review ) q - balls @xcite and their properties were thoroughly examined , in particular , due to the interest encouraged by cosmology ( see , for example , @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the main soliton characteristics , the energy @xmath0 and the charge @xmath1 , are functions of the parameter @xmath2 ( the standard q - ball solution in a scalar field theory with global @xmath3 invariance has the form @xmath4 ) , which results in the possibility of different forms of @xmath5 dependence for different scalar field potentials .    of course , the most interesting q - ball solutions are stable solutions . in general , there are three types of the q - ball stability :    1 .   the first type is the quantum mechanical stability , i.e. , the stability with respect to decay into free particles . if @xmath6 for a q - ball of charge @xmath1 , where @xmath7 is the mass of a free particle in the theory under consideration ( without loss of generality , from here on we suppose that @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) , then such a q - ball is quantum mechanically stable . </S>",
    "<S> 2 .   </S>",
    "<S> the second type is the stability against fission . </S>",
    "<S> q - balls are stable against decay into q - balls with smaller charges if @xmath10 ( a simple justification of this fact in the general case can be found in @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> 3 .   </S>",
    "<S> the third type is the classical stability , i.e. , the stability with respect to small perturbations of the scalar field . </S>",
    "<S> the stability criterion proposed in @xcite implies that a q - ball is classically stable if @xmath11 .    </S>",
    "<S> below we will consider only those q - ball solutions which satisfy all the three stability criteria , presented above . </S>",
    "<S> we will call them  absolutely stable \" q - balls . </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted that since the equality @xmath12 always holds for q - balls , the latter leads to @xmath13 thus , the criterion of stability against fission and the criterion of classical stability coincide , i.e. , classically stable q - balls are stable against fission .    </S>",
    "<S> note that our definition of the absolute stability ( at least in the absence of fermions ) differs from the one of papers @xcite , where the stability with respect to decay into free particles is supposed to be the strongest criterion , which q - balls should satisfy , and such q - balls are called absolutely stable in these papers . </S>",
    "<S> our definition is different because , as we will see below , the stability with respect to decay into free particles does not imply the classical stability in the general case .    </S>",
    "<S> as it was noted above , the @xmath5 dependencies may have rather different forms in models with different potentials . as the first example one can recall the model presented in the well - known paper @xcite . the @xmath5 dependence in this model </S>",
    "<S> consists of two branches , one of which ( the lower one ) is classically stable . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , there exists @xmath14 such that for @xmath15 the inequality @xmath6 holds for the lower branch ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3(a ) in @xcite ) . thus , q - balls with @xmath15 from the lower branch of the @xmath5 dependence are absolutely stable . </S>",
    "<S> an analogous form of the @xmath5 dependence is inherent to other models , see , for example , @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> another type of q - balls is the one with only one branch . as an example one may consider the model with @xmath16 potential studied in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath5 dependence in this model consists of only one branch with @xmath17 , and all q - balls in such a model are even classically unstable ( this was also shown explicitly in @xcite ) .    an interesting model with a logarithmic unbounded scalar field potential </S>",
    "<S> was proposed in @xcite and thoroughly examined in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath5 dependence in this model also consists of two branches , one of which is classically stable ( again it is the lower branch ) . </S>",
    "<S> the charge of the q - balls from the stable branch varies from @xmath18 to @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> an analogous @xmath5 behavior has the model with a simple polynomial potential discussed in @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> in all the examples presented above the spectra of stable q - balls ( if they exist ) either have no upper limit , or have an upper limit , but start from zero . in any case , the charge and the energy of such q - balls vary in a wide range or are even unbounded . </S>",
    "<S> there arises a question : is it possible to make this range parametrically small ?    to answer this question , we recall that in some models there is another form of the @xmath5 dependence . </S>",
    "<S> it consists of three branches , one of which ,  the  lowest \" branch , contains q - balls which are classically stable . </S>",
    "<S> an important feature of this branch is that there exist both a lower bound on the charge @xmath20 and an upper bound @xmath21 such that q - balls with @xmath22 are classically stable . </S>",
    "<S> such an @xmath5 dependence arises in the models with piecewise parabolic potentials examined in @xcite ( these scalar field potentials were originally proposed in @xcite ) , and in the model with a polynomial potential discussed in @xcite . below we will focus on examination of such an @xmath5 dependence with three branches .    in order to find out whether it is possible that the range of charges , where the absolutely stable q - balls exist , can be made small </S>",
    "<S> , it is better to have an analytically solvable model . </S>",
    "<S> the models discussed in @xcite are analytically solvable ( the model of @xcite provides a very simple analytic q - ball solution , which is very useful for examining perturbations above the q - ball solution explicitly ) , but the scalar field potentials utilized in these models contain breaks , which is rather unphysical and demands an additional regularization of the potentials . below we will propose a model with a continuous and differentiable potential , admitting the existence of a simple analytic q - ball solution and providing the @xmath5 dependence with three branches , one of which corresponds to classically stable q - balls </S>",
    "<S> . we will calculate @xmath23 and @xmath21 in this model and answer the question posed above .    </S>",
    "<S> we consider the globally @xmath3 invariant scalar field theory with a piecewise potential of the form @xmath24 where @xmath25 , @xmath26 is the heaviside step function with the convention @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> the form of this scalar field potential for different values of the dimensionless parameter @xmath28 is presented in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ v ] .    ): </S>",
    "<S> @xmath29 , @xmath30 ( left plot ) ; @xmath31 ( middle plot ) ; @xmath32 , @xmath33 ( right plot).,width=624 ]    we will be looking for a solution to the corresponding equation of motion of the standard form @xmath34 where @xmath35 . without loss of generality </S>",
    "<S> , we suppose that @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> the monotonic solution for @xmath37 such that @xmath38 and @xmath39 can be easily found and has the form @xmath40 where the matching radius @xmath41 is such that @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath43 we have @xmath44 , whereas for @xmath45 we have @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> it is evident that if @xmath32 , then @xmath47 ; if @xmath31 , then @xmath48 ; otherwise @xmath49 .    </S>",
    "<S> the continuity of @xmath50 and of its first derivative leads to the following equation for @xmath51 : @xmath52 this equation can be easily solved numerically for a given @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> note that equation ( [ defr ] ) is valid only for q - ball solutions without nodes . </S>",
    "<S> for such a solution and for a given @xmath2 one should take the first ( smallest ) root of ( [ defr ] ) satisfying the condition @xmath53 .    </S>",
    "<S> the q - ball charge and energy can also be easily calculated and have the form @xmath54,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath55,\\label{energyorig}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have used eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ defr ] ) in the derivation .    </S>",
    "<S> now let us examine the @xmath5 dependence for different values of the model parameters , i.e. , for @xmath32 , @xmath31 and @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> it is not difficult to show that the charge ( [ chargeorig ] ) and the energy ( [ energyorig ] ) can be represented as @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 depend only on @xmath59 and @xmath28 and do not depend on @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> so , below we will not specify the values of @xmath60 and @xmath7 while examining the main properties of q - balls in our model : the @xmath5 dependencies can be examined by considering the dimensionless quantities @xmath57 and @xmath58 for different choices of @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> such a simplification is possible only because of the simple form of the scalar field potential , which appears to be very useful for calculations .    </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding plots are presented in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eqf1 ]  and  [ eqf2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> we see that the @xmath5 diagrams for the cases @xmath32 and @xmath31 resemble those in the models discussed in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> all four cases , presented in figs .  [ eqf1 ]  and  [ eqf2 ] , also exist in the model discussed in @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath61 ( left plot ) and for @xmath31 ( right plot ) . </S>",
    "<S> the dashed line corresponds to free scalar particles of mass @xmath7.,width=529 ]    . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath62 ( left plot ) and @xmath63 ( right plot ) . the dashed line corresponds to free scalar particles of mass @xmath7.,width=529 ]    it should be noted that , though @xmath2 is bounded from above , @xmath64 , in the limit @xmath65 the charge and the energy tend to infinity in all four cases , presented in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eqf1 ]  and  [ eqf2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> this happens because the factor @xmath66 in the exponent of ( [ backgr2 ] ) tends to zero for @xmath65 , whereas @xmath67 ; so the scalar field falls off not exponentially , but as @xmath68 in this limit . </S>",
    "<S> the latter leads to infinite charge and energy of the q - ball for @xmath65 . due to the large size of the q - ball core </S>",
    "<S> , such q - balls were called `` q - clouds '' in @xcite .    as it was noted above </S>",
    "<S> , we will be interested in the last case @xmath29 . as it can be seen from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eqf2 ] , there are two phases : the first phase contains three branches on the @xmath5 diagram , whereas the other phase contains only one branch ( the latter case is similar to the one of the model with @xmath16 potential studied in @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the transition between the phases occurs at @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> one also sees from the left plot in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eqf2 ] that the most part of the lowest stable branch lies under the @xmath70 line corresponding to free particles , which means that the range of charges of absolutely stable q - balls is rather large . </S>",
    "<S> note that the part of the upper classically unstable branch ( which starts from @xmath71 ) on the left plot in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eqf2 ] also lies under the @xmath70 line corresponding to free particles , which means that the stability with respect to decay into free particles indeed does not imply the classical stability in the general case .    </S>",
    "<S> we would like to note that the existence of a locally maximal charge in the phase with three branches ( see fig .  [ eqf2 ] ) seems to be a consequence of the turnover of the scalar field potential . </S>",
    "<S> we think that this is a rather general property , which is inherent to other models of q - balls . </S>",
    "<S> although we can not prove it in a rigorous way , we do not know exceptions from this rule . </S>",
    "<S> meanwhile , the opposite is not correct  the existence of the turnover of the scalar field potential does not guarantee the existence of a locally maximal charge , which is confirmed by the existence of the phase without maximal charge for @xmath72 in our case and by the examples of other models ( see , for example , @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> we also stress that the maximal value of @xmath50 ( which is simply @xmath73 ) of the q - ball with locally maximal charge is not connected with the point of the maximum of the scalar field potential for @xmath74 . indeed , </S>",
    "<S> the scalar field potential is maximal at @xmath75 ; whereas the value of @xmath73 decreases monotonically ( this can be checked numerically ) from @xmath76 to @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> so , if @xmath78 ( see , for example , left plot in fig .  [ eqf2 ] ) , then @xmath79 : the maximum of the absolute value of the q - ball scalar field is larger than the point of the maximum of the scalar field potential for any @xmath80 , i.e. , for any q - ball . </S>",
    "<S> an interesting observation in the opposite case @xmath81 is that q - balls with @xmath65 lie on the unstable branch , whereas @xmath82 in this case . </S>",
    "<S> these examples demonstrate that there is no ( at least obvious ) connection between the maximal absolute value of the q - ball scalar field , the point of the maximum of the scalar field potential and the q - ball stability .    . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath83 ( a ) ; @xmath84 ( b ) ; @xmath85 ( c ) ; @xmath86 ( d ) . the dashed line stands for free particles of mass @xmath7.,width=604 ]    </S>",
    "<S> now let us check what happens when we change the parameter @xmath87 . </S>",
    "<S> the result is presented in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eqf3 ] . </S>",
    "<S> we see that the larger @xmath88 is , the smaller the  triangle \" in the corresponding @xmath5 diagram is . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the larger @xmath89 is , the smaller part of this  triangle \" turns out to lie under the @xmath70 line corresponding to free particles . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath90 the  triangle \" touches the free particles line by the upper cusp , whereas for @xmath91 all the classically stable q - balls are quantum mechanically unstable . for @xmath92 </S>",
    "<S> the  triangle \" disappears and there is no classically stable branch in the @xmath5 dependence at all .    </S>",
    "<S> the observations presented above indicate that there exist such values of the parameters that absolutely stable q - balls can exist only in a very narrow range of charges ( and , consequently , energies ) . as an example , let us take @xmath93 . </S>",
    "<S> the upper right part of the  triangle \" , including the cusp , is presented in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eqf4 ] .    . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath94 . the dashed line stands for free particles of mass @xmath7.,width=604 ]    </S>",
    "<S> the lower branch in this figure is the stable one . </S>",
    "<S> the values of @xmath95 and @xmath96 , corresponding to the dots on the plot , are the following : @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 . </S>",
    "<S> the ranges of the charges and the energies , for which the absolutely stable q - balls can exist , are @xmath101 these ranges are much smaller than the absolute values of the charges and the energies respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> the closer ( from below ) @xmath88 to @xmath102 is , the smaller @xmath103 and @xmath104 are . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath105 the @xmath5 dependence of the absolutely stable q - balls is similar to the one in the limiting case @xmath106 : @xmath107 where @xmath108 . </S>",
    "<S> but it looks exactly like the @xmath5 dependence of free particles at rest ! </S>",
    "<S> the only difference is that the charge of free particles @xmath109 , whereas for q - balls we have in the limiting case @xmath110 . of course , analogous anti - q - balls ( i.e. , q - balls with @xmath111 and @xmath112 ) also exist and possess the same properties .    </S>",
    "<S> we think that the existence of such particle - like q - balls should be inherent not only to the model presented above , but to other models providing an @xmath5 dependence with three branches ( namely , to models with scalar field potential admitting the existence of a true vacuum at @xmath113 or at least having a negative slope after some nonzero value of the scalar field modulus ) , like those in @xcite . in such models </S>",
    "<S> there is a possibility to tune the charge of a stable q - ball to a nearly determined value , i.e. , it is possible to have absolutely stable q - balls with the ranges of charges and energies much smaller than the absolute values of charges and energies themselves . </S>",
    "<S> the spectra of such q - balls are very similar to the spectrum of free particles of the theory and q - balls behave like clusters of free particles , which looks very intriguing . </S>"
