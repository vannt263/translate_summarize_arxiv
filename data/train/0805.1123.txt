    "quantum information science makes use of the entanglement between well - defined two dimensional qubits or d - dimensional qudits to perform tasks that could not be performed by a corresponding classical system . in optical implementations of quantum information technologies ,",
    "a commonly used source of entanglement is the generation of photon pairs by spontaneous parametric down - conversion ( spdc ) @xcite .    in many applications ,",
    "photon polarization is used to define a qubit , since it provides a natural two level system that is comparatively easy to control by using birefringent optical elements .",
    "however , photon pairs produced by spdc are also entangled in their spatial and temporal degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "since these degrees of freedom are naturally continuous , it is necessary to introduce additional constraints in order to define a qubit or qudit system .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that it is fairly easy to extend the method to higher dimensions , a possibility that may simplify some quantum information processes @xcite .",
    "one widely used method of defining spatial qudits by discretizing the transversal degrees of freedom is the selection of angular momentum eigenstates corresponding to photons in gauss - laguerre modes @xcite .",
    "however , it is in principle not necessary to base the selection of modes on symmetries , since the spatial entanglement applies to arbitrary selections of orthogonal modes .",
    "it is therefore possible to define qudits by simply selecting a sufficiently narrow spatial `` pixel '' for each basis state of the qudit @xcite . alternatively , it is possible to concentrate on only one spatial dimension .",
    "as was demonstrated by neves and co - workers , entangled spatial qudits can then be obtained by using the familiar slit arrays used in basic demonstrations of optical interference @xcite .",
    "an interesting and important aspect of the use of multi - slits to define spatial qudits is the fact that the photons continue to propagate in continuous free space after their wavefunction has been projected into a two dimensional hilbert space @xcite .",
    "this means that the spatial qudits continue to exist in the infinite dimensional hilbert space of transverse position and momentum .",
    "specifically , the only directly observable physical property of the qudits is their transverse position , so that the measurement and control of the qudit states has to be based on the evolution of their spatial wavefunction .",
    "it is therefore of great interest to explore the possibilities of preparing and characterizing different multi - slit qudit states using their propagation in space .    in this paper",
    ", we present a thorough investigation of the entanglement between a pair of double - slit qubits based on measurements of their correlated spatial patterns .",
    "in particular , we show that measurements performed between the focal and image planes of a lens simultaneously provide which - path information that distinguishes between the slits and interference information that identifies the quantum coherence between the slits .",
    "it is therefore possible to scan the whole surface of the qubit bloch sphere by varying the detector position in this intermediate plane .",
    "we can use this method to prepare arbitrary superposition states , and to perform quantum tomography of the states thus prepared by scanning only a single transverse pattern .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec2 ] , we present the experimental setup and report the results of quantum tomography performed by measuring count rates corresponding to eigenstates of the pauli operators in the image and focal planes . in section [ sec3 ] , we analyze the effects of a measurement between the focal and image planes on the spatial qubit and show how it can be used for qubit preparation and for single - scan tomography . in section [ sec4 ] , we present the experimental results of single - scan tomography for conditional states prepared by measurements in the other arm and reconstruct the density matrix of the entangled state once more from these results . the results are compared with those from the pauli operator measurements , and possible experimental problems are discussed .",
    "section [ sec5 ] concludes the paper .",
    "in this work , we use double - slits to define the spatial qubits .",
    "it is convenient to express the qubit states in the @xmath0 basis corresponding to photons passing through the left or right slits as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : concept ] .     definition of the entangled qubits . the slits in each arm a ,",
    "b define the basis states @xmath0 corresponding to the slit a photon passes through . ]    in this basis , the entangled state ideally generated by our setup is given by @xmath1 where the suffixes a and b denote two photons found in different arms of our setup . in this section , we explain the setup in detail and present an experimental confirmation of the entanglement of our source by quantum tomography .",
    "figure [ fig : expsys ] shows our experimental setup .",
    "experimental setup .",
    "note that basis states in the b arm are exchanged due to the reflection at the pbs .",
    "the detector system is composed of the parts shown in the inset . ]",
    "the entangled photons were generated in type ii spdc by a 405 nm pump beam from a 45 mw cw laser incident on a 5 mm - thick @xmath2-barium borate ( bbo ) crystal .",
    "the bbo crystal was placed in the collinear condition .",
    "the photons were separated into two different directions by a polarizing beam splitter ( pbs ) . in each arm , a double - slit was placed in the focal plane of a lens in order to select a pair of transverse momenta of the photons . the slit width was 40@xmath3 m and the distance between the slits was 150@xmath3 m .",
    "a lens of focal length @xmath4 mm was placed at a distance of @xmath5 from the double - slit .",
    "a detector system was placed in a plane at a distance of @xmath6 from the lens .",
    "the detector system consists of a single slit with a width of 40@xmath3 m , a band pass filter ( 810 nm , band width of 10 nm ) , an objective lens to couple the photons into a multimode fiber , and a photon detector ( perkin - elmer spcm - aqr-14 ) as shown in the inset of fig . [ fig : expsys ] .",
    "the coincidence counts between the detectors in the two arms were recorded .",
    "the spatial qubits can be characterized in terms of the pauli operators , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 . in the @xmath0 basis",
    ", they are @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 .",
    "to measure @xmath9 , we have to distinguish the two slits .",
    "since the image of the double - slit appears in the image plane at a distance of @xmath13 from the lens ( fig .",
    "[ fig : slit_2f_lens](a ) ) , we can do this by placing the detectors at the positions corresponding to each slit in the image plane .",
    "measurements of pauli operators .",
    "( a ) @xmath9 can be measured in the image plane .",
    "( b ) any linear combination of @xmath7 and @xmath8 can be measured in the focal plane .",
    "( c ) detectors in the image plane and the focal plane measure the states on the poles and the equator of the bloch sphere . ]    to measure @xmath7 and @xmath8 , we have to obtain the phase information of the interference pattern of the double slits . since the interference patterns are observed in the focal plane at a distance of @xmath14 from the lens ( fig .",
    "[ fig : slit_2f_lens](b ) ) , we can do this by placing the detectors at appropriate positions in the focal plane .",
    "e. g. for a photon in the state @xmath15 , an interference pattern appears as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : slit_2f_lens](b ) .",
    "the @xmath7 operator averages can then be estimated from the difference between the count rates at the center and at the first node of this interference pattern .",
    "these two detector positions thus correspond to projective measurements of the @xmath7 eigenstates , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "likewise , a measurement of the @xmath8 eigenstates can be realized by placing the detectors at the positions corresponding to @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "we can therefore realize the pauli operator measurements by detecting photons at each of the six positions in the two planes corresponding to the eigenstates of @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : slit_2f_lens](c ) .",
    "coincidence count rates as a function of scanning detector position . the dots and squares show the experimental data and the solid curves are guides for the eyes .",
    "the detector positions at 0 and 135@xmath3 m correspond to a @xmath7 measurement in the scanning arm a. the positions @xmath1967@xmath3 m correspond to a @xmath8 measurement in the scanning arm a. ( a)interference correlation .",

    "a , the detector position @xmath22 was scanned in either the focal plane or the image plane .",
    "first , the scanning detector was placed in the focal plane .",
    "when the fixed detector was placed at the appropriate position for a measurement of a @xmath7 or @xmath8 eigenstate , a conditional interference pattern was observed . as the fixed detector position was moved , the interference pattern changed its phase without losing visibility .",
    "the interference patterns for the four eigenstates of @xmath7 or @xmath8 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : expresults1](a ) and ( b ) . when the fixed detector was set at a position corresponding to a @xmath9 eigenstate , the interference pattern disappeared as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : expresults1](c ) , that is , we see no correlation between @xmath9 and @xmath7/@xmath8 .",
    "next , the scanning detector was placed in the image plane .",

    "the density matrix can be reconstructed by using the data extracted from the correlation experiments and listed in table [ tbl : a1](a ) .",
    "specifically , the data for the @xmath7 measurement in the scanning arm a was obtained from the scanning detector positions at 0 or 135@xmath3 m from the center in fig .",

    "specifically , the reconstruction of @xmath29 from @xmath28 and the reconstruction of @xmath26 from @xmath30 are related by a set of reconstruction operators @xmath31 with @xmath32 since we have chosen 6 measurement points in b , we have sufficient information to reconstruct the complete two qubit density matrix @xmath26 from the conditional density matrices @xmath24 .",

    ", the agreement with the theoretical prediction 1 is not as good as that of the pauli operator measurements described in section [ sec2 ]",
    ". it should therefore be possible to improve the experiment by identifying the sources of the additional errors . since there are some discrepancies between the experimental data and the theoretical fit in fig .",
    "[ fig : conditinalscanningdata ] , one problem may be that the experimental parameters used in the theory need to be adjusted .",
    "moreover , the visibilities may be underestimated by the fit as indicated by data points above and below the maxima and minima of the interference patterns .",
    "an increase in the spatial resolution of the measurement might solve this problem .",
    "the main merit of our method is that we can see both the which - path and the interference information in a single scan .",
    "our experimental results clearly confirm that the coincidence count distribution contains all the data necessary to reconstruct the density matrix .",
    "this kind of single scan tomography thus provides a direct characterization of spatial qudits in terms of their actual physical properties in space .",
    "we have presented a thorough experimental investigation of the entanglement between a pair of spatial qubits generated by passing down - converted photon pairs through double - slits .",
    "pauli operator measurements indicate that we have achieved a fidelity of @xmath36 for the maximally entangled two qubit states . we have then explored the possibility of accessing arbitrary superposition states by measurements between the focal and image planes .",
    "we can use the entanglement to prepare arbitrary states in arm a by measurements in arm b. the results have been verified by single scan tomography , where we identified each density matrix element with its distinct pattern in the measurement distribution . fidelities between 0.841 and 0.912 have been obtained for the conditionally prepared states . by combining the conditional results , we obtained a two qubit density matrix with a fidelity of 0.824 .",
    "the decrease in the fidelity compared to the pauli operator measurements suggests that further experimental improvements may be possible .",
    "the method introduced here allows us to access the full hilbert space of the spatial qubits .",
    "it may therefore have applications in the realization of quantum information protocols using double - slit qubits .",
    "moreover , the extension of our method to @xmath37-slit qudits is straightforward , opening the way to quantum operations in higher dimensional hilbert spaces .",
