    "physical models often involve phenomenological parameters or auxiliary fields characterizing the background spacetime or the background media . in most cases , dynamics of the model depend smoothly ( continuously and differentiably ) on the values of the background parameter .",
    "a non - smooth functional dependence is a rather rare phenomenon , but if it exists , it usually represents a keystone issue of the model .",
    "the examples of such non - smooth behavior are well known in solid state physics as phase transitions at critical points .",
    "another similar issue is the scalar higgs model of spontaneous symmetry breaking .    in this paper",
    ", we present a simple phenomenological model of an electromagnetic medium that allows wave propagation only for a sufficiently big value of the medium parameter . for zero values of the parameter ,",
    "our medium is the ordinary sr ( or even gr ) vacuum with the standard dispersion relation @xmath0 .",
    "however even infinitesimally small variations of the parameter modify the dispersion relation in such a way that it does not have real solutions , i.e. , the medium becomes to be completely opaque . for higher values of the parameter",
    ", the dispersion relation is modified once more and once again it has real solutions .",
    "it is well known that the dispersion relation can be treated as an effective metric in the phase space . in our model ,",
    "the vacuum lorentz metric is spontaneously transformed into the euclidean one and returns to be lorentzian for a sufficiently big value of the parameter .",
    "we consider the standard electromagnetic system of two antisymmetric fields @xmath1 and @xmath2 that obey the vacuum maxwell system @xmath3}=0\\,,\\qquad h^{ij}{}_{,j}=0\\,.\\ ] ] the fields are assumed to be related by the local linear constitutive relation , @xcite,@xcite , @xmath4 due to this definition , the constitutive tensor obeys the symmetries @xmath5 the electromagnetic model ( [ max ] ) with the local linear response ( [ cons ] ) is intensively studied recently , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and especially in @xcite .    by using the young diagram technique ,",
    "a fourth rank tensor with the symmetries ( [ sym ] ) is uniquely irreducible decomposed into the sum of three independent pieces .",
    "@xmath6 the first term here is the principal part . in the simplest pure maxwell case",
    "it is expressed by the metric tensor of gr @xmath7 in the flat minkowski spacetime with the metric @xmath8 , it reads @xmath9 in quantum field description , this term is related to the photon .",
    "the third term in ( [ decomp ] ) is completely skew symmetric .",
    "consequently , it can be written as @xmath10 the pseudo - scalar @xmath11 represents the axion copartner of the photon .",
    "it influences the wave propagation such that birefringence occurs @xcite , @xcite .",
    "in fact , this effect is absent in the geometric optics description and corresponds to the higher order approximation , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we turn now to the second part of ( [ decomp ] ) , that is expressed as @xmath12 this tensor has 15 independent components , so it may be represented by a traceless matrix @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this matrix reads @xmath13 the traceless condition @xmath14 follows straightforwardly from ( [ skewon - matr ] ) .    in order to describe the influence of the skewon on the wave propagation , it is convenient to introduce a covector @xmath15 consider a medium described by a vacuum principal part ( [ princ - part - m ] ) and a generic skewon .",
    "the dispersion relation for such a medium takes the form , @xcite , @xcite , @xmath16 here the scalar product @xmath17 and the squares of the covectors @xmath18 and @xmath19 are calculated by the use of the metric tensor .",
    "it can be easily checked that eq.([disp ] ) is invariant under the gauge transformation @xmath20 with an arbitrary real parameter @xmath21 .",
    "this parameter can even be an arbitrary function of @xmath22 and of the medium parameters @xmath23 . with this gauge freedom",
    ", we can apply the lorenz - type gauge condition @xmath24 and obtain the dispersion relation in an even more simple form @xmath25 this expression yields a characteristic fact @xcite : the solutions @xmath26 of the dispersion relation , if they exist , are non - timelike , that is , spacelike or null , @xmath27    we will proceed now with the form ( [ disp ] ) and with the skewon covector expressed as in ( [ skewon - cov ] ) .",
    "we can rewrite the dispersion relation as @xmath28 consequently , the real solutions exist only if @xmath29 our crucial observation that the first term here is quartic in the skewon parameters @xmath30 while the second term is only quadratic . under these circumstances , the first term can be small for for sufficiently small skewon parameters and the inequality ( [ ineq ] ) breaks down . for higher values , the first term becomes to be essential and the inequality is reinstated .",
    "we now present a model where this possibility is realized , indeed . consider a symmetric traceless matrix with two nonzero entries @xmath31 we denote the components of the wave covector as @xmath32 .",
    "the skewon covector has two nonzero components @xmath33 consequently , @xmath34 hence the inequality ( [ ineq ] ) takes the form @xmath35 observe that for every choice of the wave covector this expression is of the form @xmath36 with positive coefficients @xmath37 .",

    "3 , the corresponding finsler metric tensors are of the lorentz signature type .    we construct a model of the electromagnetic vacuum with a skewon field that has the following features :    * there is a gap for values of the parameters near zero , where the wave propagation is forbidden .",
