    "observations of distant qsos ( becker et al .  2001 ; fan et al .",
    "2002 ) and the cosmic microwave background ( kogut et al .  2003 ) together suggest that the universe was re - ionized somewhere between @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "searching for the sources of re - ionizing photons is currently an intense observational effort .",
    "most searches naturally concentrate on luminous systems , i.e.  qsos and luminous galaxies , at @xmath11 as these should be easier to detect than less luminous and more distant objects .",
    "however qsos likely produced insufficient photons to accomplish re - ionization alone ( fan et al .  2001 ; barger et al .",
    "2003 ) , and the same may be true of luminous ( @xmath12 ) galaxies based on small samples from the _ hubble space telescope _ ultra deep field ( hereafter _ hst _ udf ; bouwens et al .  2004 ; bunker et al .",
    "2004 ; yan et al .",
    "this raises the important possibilities that re - ionization either occurred much earlier , or that the bulk of the re - ionizing photons were emitted by sub - luminous galaxies , i.e.  @xmath13 .",
    "the udf studies operate close to the detection threshold of the deepest optical / near - infrared imaging available .",
    "it is therefore difficult to envisage substantial progress in the detection of more remote and/or less luminous galaxies via deep imaging of `` blank fields '' with the current generation of telescopes . with the advent of the _ james webb space telescope _",
    "still some years ahead , the magnifying power of massive galaxy cluster lenses is therefore a much needed boost for the discovery power of _ hst _ and large ground - based telescopes .",
    "indeed , the galaxy redshift record has been broken on several occasions with the help of the gravitational magnification of distant galaxies by foreground galaxy clusters ( mellier et al .",
    "1991 ; franx et al .  1997 ; hu et al .  2002 ; kneib et al .",
    "the faint end of the luminosity function of lyman-@xmath14 emitters at @xmath15 has also been constrained with the help of gravitational lensing ( santos et al .",
    "2004 ; ellis et al.2001 ) .",
    "extension of these techniques to @xmath7 is therefore an important element of observational studies of cosmic re - ionization .",
    "pell et al .  ( 2004  hereafter p04 ) reported a gravitationally magnified ( @xmath16 ) galaxy at @xmath1 ( hereafter # 1916 , following p04 s nomenclature ) behind the foreground galaxy cluster a1835 ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "this interpretation is based on non - detection in optical imaging from the ground ( @xmath17 limits in a @xmath18 diameter aperture : @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) and space ( @xmath17 limit in a @xmath22 diameter aperture : @xmath23 ) , and the shape of the continuum at @xmath24 ( using a @xmath25 aperture : @xmath26 , @xmath27 ) which is reminiscent of the lyman - break selection technique ( steidel et al .",
    "p04 corroborated the putative lyman - break redshifted to @xmath28 with an emission line at @xmath29 with integrated flux of @xmath30 , which they interpret as lyman-@xmath14 .",
    "lower redshift interpretations of the line ( [ oii ] at @xmath31 ; [ oiii ] at @xmath32 ; h@xmath14 at @xmath33 ) were discarded by p04 largely on the basis of the low probability of solutions at @xmath34 when fitting synthetic spectral energy distributions ( seds ) to their photometric data .",
    "the most likely of these lower - redshift solutions ( @xmath31 ) was further excluded on the basis of the dust extinction required to fit the photometric data ( @xmath35 ) , and the absence of doublet structure in the observed emission line .",
    "based solely on the photometry ( optical non - detection , red @xmath36 and blue @xmath37 colors ) the @xmath1 interpretation of # 1916 is plausible .",
    "however p04 s preference for this solution over the lower redshift alternatives was controversial from the outset .",
    "for example , the emission line does not have the characteristic p - cygni profile of lyman-@xmath14 , and the different photometric apertures adopted in the optical ( @xmath18  smaller than the ground - based seeing disc ) and near - infrared ( @xmath25  @xmath38 the seeing disk ) may suppress the likelihood of lower - redshift solutions when fitting synthetic seds .",
    "bremer et al .  have also suggested that # 1916 may either not exist , or be intrinsically variable , based on their non - detection in the @xmath5-band with niri on gemini - north , @xmath39 , in contrast to p04 s @xmath40 detection of @xmath41 with isaac on vlt",
    ". the spectroscopic identification of # 1916 is also in doubt .",
    "weatherley et al .",
    "( 2004 ) re - analyzed p04 s spectroscopic data and failed to detect the emission line at @xmath29 , citing spurious positive flux arising from variable hot pixels in the isaac array as the likely source of the discrepancy .",
    "a1835 has been used previously as a gravitational telescope , for example targeting sub - millimeter galaxies ( hereafter smgs ; e.g.smail et al .",
    "2002 ) and galaxies with extremely red optical / near - infrared colors ( smith et al .",

    "2004 ) , # 1916 is plausibly at a similar redshift to smmj14011@xmath420252 , and may also be obscured by dust .",
    "further circumstantial evidence for a lower redshift interpretation of # 1916 comes from richard et al .",
    "( 2003 ) who used the same spectroscopic data as presented by p04 to discover a strongly reddened star - forming galaxy at @xmath32 .",

    "for example , if # 1916 does indeed lie at @xmath87 (  [ intro ] ) , then lyman-@xmath14 may be detectable at @xmath88 .",

    "on the red side the spectral dispersion was 1.86 / pixel with a pixel scale of @xmath89/pixel and on the blue side the spectral dispersion was 1.09 / pixel with a pixel scale of @xmath90/pixel .",

    "the data were de - biased , flat - fielded , sky - subtracted , extracted and calibrated in a standard manner within iraf .",
    "no flux at observed optical wavelengths has yet been detected at the position of # 1916 ( p04 ; lehnert et al .",
    "2004 ;  [ hubble ] ) .",
    "we therefore did not expect to detect any continuum emission , and concentrated instead on searching for faint emission lines of large equivalent width .",
    "visual inspection of the reduced 2d data revealed neither continuum nor line emission . to estimate the sensitivity limit",
    "we extracted a 1d trace from the center of the slit corresponding to the full width of the seeing disk , and estimated the @xmath17 detection limit per 5-a spectral resolution element to be @xmath92 at @xmath93 ",

    "we obtain a @xmath17 sensitivity limit in that aperture of @xmath99 ( table  [ table : imaging ] ) .",
    "deep near - infrared imaging of a1835 was obtained by p04 with the isaac @xmath100 hawaii rockwell array on eso s 8-m vlt in february 2003 .",
    "we reduced independently the @xmath5- and @xmath6-band data using standard iraf tasks , paying careful attention to rejection of cosmetic defects in the isaac array , including bad pixels , and to conserving the noise properties of the data .",

    "( )    flat - fielding and sky - subtraction were combined into a single step using a median of the eight frames temporally adjacent to each science frame .",
    "we refer to this step as `` flat - fielding '' , and to the rolling temporal median frames as `` sky - flats '' .",
    "flat - fielding was performed twice .",
    "first on the dark - subtracted frames which were then registered and averaged to produce a first - pass reduced frame .",
    "this frame was then used to mask out flux from identified sources from the individual dark - subtracted frames , and these masked frames were then used to construct the sky - flats in a second - pass reduction . this approach minimizes the loss of flux from objects with angular extents comparable with the size of the dither pattern .",
    "this is important when searching for faint objects along lines - of - sight through the crowded cores of rich galaxy clusters because the light from bright cluster galaxies effectively form a spatially varying background against which the faint sources are detected .",
    "the goal of the second - pass flat - field is to conserve this `` background '' .",
    "independent bad pixel masks were made by sigma - clipping both the darks and the sky - flats .",
    "the former identifies @xmath101 pixels ( @xmath102 of the total array ) as static , i.e.  `` bad '' , and the latter identifies the same @xmath101 pixels plus an additional @xmath103 pixels ( a further @xmath104 of the total array ) as bad .",
    "the latter mask was adopted as the fiducial bad pixel mask .",
    "detector bias residuals were removed by subtracting the median along rows in individual flat - fielded frames after masking identified sources , in a manner similar to that described by labb et al .",
    "( 2003 ) .",
    "the individual frames were integer pixel aligned .",
    "this has the important benefit of minimizing pixel - to - pixel correlations in the noise properties of each frame and thus the final stacked frame .",
    "calculation of the background noise is therefore simplified relative to a reduction scheme based on sub - integer pixel alignment of the individual frames .",
    "no frames were rejected when making the final combination of the reduced , aligned frames .",
    "two versions of the final stacked frame were made : a straight average and a weighted average  the weight of an individual frame was proportional to @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is the fwhm of the seeing disk , and rms is the root mean square per pixel of the noise in each frame .",
    "the weighted version of the final frame has slightly better image quality than the straight average .",
    "we therefore adopt it for the analysis described below .",

    "here we discuss the two shortest wavelength , more sensitive , observations .",
    "twelve and eighteen 200-second exposures were accumulated at @xmath78 and @xmath80 respectively , using the small - step cycling dither pattern . the basic calibrated data ( bcd )",
    "were combined using custom routines to produce the final stacked frame with a pixel scale of @xmath112 .",
    "we re - binned the data back to the original pixel scale of @xmath113 to eliminate correlations in the background noise .    visual inspection of the final frames again indicates that there is no flux at the position of # 1916 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : nir ] ) . to quantify this non - detection we follow the same procedure as p04 , as described in  [ hubble ] .",
    "we used @xmath114 diameter apertures , i.e.  @xmath38 the seeing disk of the irac observations to obtain @xmath17 sensitivity limits of : @xmath115 and @xmath116 respectively .",
    "the objective of this section is to answer the three questions posed in  [ intro ] : ( i ) is # 1916 at @xmath8 ? ; ( ii ) is # 1916 intrinsically variable ? ; ( iii ) does # 1916 exist ?",
    "preliminary inspection of the data in  [ data ] indicates that no flux is detected at the position of # 1916 at any wavelength to date . combining this with bremer et al.s more sensitive non - detection of @xmath117 ,",
    "it is tempting to leap to the third question and reply `` no '' .",
    "we adopt a more conservative approach .",
    "this test concentrates on the optical data because the detection of any flux shortward of the putative lyman limit of a galaxy at @xmath118 would immediately discount that interpretation .",
    "the red observed optical / near - infrared spectral energy distribution described by p04 could then be naturally explained by a dusty galaxy at @xmath8 , perhaps associated with the smgs that lie within @xmath119 ( @xmath120 in projection at @xmath8 ) of # 1916 ( ivison et al .",
    "2000 ; smail et al .",

    ". however these non - detections are consistent with all of the following : @xmath1 , extreme dust obscuration at @xmath8 , an intrinsically variable source , and non - existence .",
    "the result of this test is therefore inconclusive .",
    "the objective of this section is to test bremer et al.s ( 2004 ) proposal that # 1916 is intrinsically variable .",
    "if p04 s photometry ( @xmath41 and @xmath121 ) is reproducible using our independent reduction of their near - infrared data , then the variable hypothesis would be supported . if not",
    ", then the idea that # 1916 does not exist would gain credibility (  [ q3 ] ) .",
    "we attempt to reproduce p04 s analysis using sextractor ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) .",
    "sextractor was configured to locate all sources with at least 7 pixels that are @xmath122 per pixel above the background ",
    "i.e.  a signal - to - noise ratio of @xmath123 per resolution element , based on the @xmath5-band seeing disk of @xmath124 (  [ isaac ] ) and the @xmath125 scale of the isaac pixels .",
    "we also smoothed the data with a gaussian filter that matched the fwhm of the observed point sources , i.e.  a gaussian of fwhm@xmath126 pixels . in this configuration sextractor failed to detect a source at the position of # 1916 .",
    "we therefore experimented with different smoothing schemes , both increasing and decreasing the full width of the gaussian filter .",
    "a `` detection '' was only possible with the smallest available filter ",
    "fwhm@xmath127 pixels , i.e.  half the width of the seeing disk  yielding @xmath128 .",
    "experimentation with block filters produced similar results in that a `` detection '' was not possible with any of the standard sextractor block filters : @xmath129 , @xmath130 , @xmath131 pixels .",
    "we also analyzed the @xmath6-band data in exactly the same manner and failed to detect anything at the position of # 1916 with any gaussian or block filter .",
    "the @xmath5-band segmentation map produced when smoothing with the fwhm@xmath127 pixel gaussian reveals that the `` detection '' is very elongated , with a width of @xmath132 pixels and a length of @xmath133 pixels .",
    "the orientation of these pixels is consistent with the orientation of # 1916 reported by p04 .",
    "it is important to stress that the motivation for filtering data with a kernel that matches the resolution element of the data is to suppress false detections .",
    "the collection of pixels identified by sextractor at the position of # 1916 was only `` detectable '' with a smoothing kernel that has a linear scale half that of the resolution element of the data .",
    "it is therefore instructive to consider how many such @xmath134 blobs exist within the isaac data . in a single @xmath25 diameter aperture (",
    "i.e.  matching that used for the photometry described above ) placed randomly in these @xmath5-band data , there is a @xmath135 chance of detecting a @xmath136 noise fluctuation ",
    "i.e.  a spurious detection",
    ". however the isaac array ( @xmath137 , each pixel @xmath138 ) contains of order @xmath139 independent photometric apertures of @xmath25 diameter .",
    "the @xmath5-band frame therefore contains @xmath140 noise fluctuations of @xmath136 significance .    sadly , the only reasonable conclusion to draw from this analysis is that # 1916 is not detected in our independent reduction of p04 s data .",
    "we therefore place @xmath17 limits on the flux at this position of : @xmath141 and @xmath142 (  [ isaac ] ) . the only wavelength at which two directly comparable observations are available is in the @xmath5-band .",
    "combining our non - detection with that of bremer et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , we conclude that there is no evidence for variability of # 1916 , and that ( if it exists ) its @xmath5-band flux is fainter than @xmath143 at @xmath17 significance ( bremer et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "the results of the preceding two sections were derived from non - detection of # 1916 across the broadest wavelength range to date : @xmath144 .",
    "we now combine all of these non - detections to address the question of whether # 1916 exists .",
    "the data force us to conclude that there is no statistically sound evidence that # 1916 exists .",
    "the balance of probability is that # 1916 was a false detection in p04 s discovery observations .",
    "new observational data yielding statistically sound detections are required before p04 s claim that # 1916 is the most distant galaxy yet discovered may be resurrected .",
    "we consider this unlikely , but we hope to be surprised by pell et al.s forthcoming _",
    "hst _ observations .",
    "we first discuss possible reasons for the difference between our non - detection of # 1916 and p04 s @xmath145 near - infrared detections .",
    "we single out two data reduction steps (  [ isaac ] ) for discussion  the efficiency of bad pixel rejection and the conservation of noise properties .",
    "the efficiency with which bad pixels are identified can affect estimates of the signal coming from faint sources  if some bad pixels are not identified , they could enhance the flux detected by sextractor . in ",
    "[ isaac ] we used two different methods to identify bad pixels , finding a small but potentially important difference between the two methods . to assess the impact of reduced efficiency of bad pixel identification we made a mask image that contained the 12,373 bad pixels identified only in the bad pixel mask generated from the sky - flats .",
    "we then made one copy of the mask per science frame and integer - pixel shifted them to match the observed dither pattern .",
    "finally we took the weighted average of these aligned mask frames and summed the pixel counts in a @xmath25 diameter aperture centered on # 1916 . from this",
    "we concluded that 7 bad pixels that are only identified in our `` sky - flat '' bad pixel maps fall within the final photometric aperture .",
    "we estimate that if not identified and excluded from the analysis , these pixels could increase the flux estimates by several tenths of a magnitude .",
    "the approach to re - sampling ( or not ) the individual frames during the data reduction process , especially the alignment of individual frames affects the noise properties of the final stacked frame .",
    "if the individual frames are re - sampled , for example by sub - integer pixel aligning them immediately prior to producing the final stacked frame , then the noise in the stacked frame is correlated .",
    "such pixel - to - pixel correlations are generally absent from integer - pixel aligned data , thus simplifying the noise properties of the final frame .",
    "neither sub - integer nor integer pixel alignment is intrinsically correct .",
    "the relevant issue is correct measurement of the noise in each case  this is critical to assess accurately the statistical significance of sources detected close to the sensitivity limit of the data .",
    "specifically , if the pixel - to - pixel correlations in sub - integer pixel aligned data are not included in the error analysis , then the noise is under - estimated and the statistical significance of the detection over - estimated ( casertano et al .",
    "we integer pixel aligned the individual frames in  [ isaac ] in order to simplify the error analysis .",
    "we now estimate by how much we would have under - estimated the noise if we had sub - integer pixel aligned the individual frames and then ignored the pixel - to - pixel correlations when calculating noise level .",
    "this is achieved by simply sub - integer aligning the individual frames and re - combining them using a weighted average . ignoring any resulting pixel - to - pixel correlations ,",
    "we obtain a @xmath17 threshold of @xmath146 , which is slightly fainter than our threshold of @xmath109 .    in summary , it is plausible that the difference between our near - infrared non - detection and p04 s detection of # 1916 using the same raw data can at least in part be explained by the efficiency of bad pixel identification and treatment of correlated noise .",
    "we now discuss the implications of our results for future work , focusing on the feasibility of searches for gravitationally magnified stellar systems at @xmath7 using ground - based near - infrared data .",
    "we begin by noting that , had their photometry been reliable , p04 s original @xmath1 interpretation of # 1916 was plausible , based solely on the photometric data .",
    "we therefore adopt p04 s optical and near - infrared photometry as being representative of what may be expected from similar future experiments ",
    "i.e.  optical non - detections in several filters based on a few hours of observations with a 4-m class telescope , a non - detection in a single red optical filter with _ hst _ , @xmath145 detections in two near - infrared filters , and possibly observations with _ spitzer_/irac .",
    "specifically , we investigate the degeneracy between @xmath7 interpretations of such datasets with lower redshift alternatives , and how such degeneracies might be broken .",
    "we use version  1.1 of hyper - z ( bolzonella et al .",
    "2000 ) to fit standard bruzual & charlot ( 1993 ) single stellar population models ( burst , e , sa , sc , i m ) to the photometric data .",

    "1998 ) , and use madau s ( 1995 ) prescription for absorption by the inter - galactic medium . in each case described below , if we fit the models to all available photometric information across the full redshift range ( @xmath149 ) , then we obtain @xmath150 ( all @xmath151 values are quoted per degree of freedom ) for all redshifts beyond @xmath152 .",
    "this is because the models are defined to have zero flux short - ward of the lyman limit ( @xmath153 ) . at @xmath154",
    ", the models also have negligible flux short - ward of lyman-@xmath14 ( @xmath155 ) due to the lyman forests and gunn peterson absorption .",
    "these two spectral features are progressively redshifted long - ward of the observed optical filters at high redshift , rendering the shorter wavelength detection limits irrelevant to the fits .",
    "the goodness of fit is therefore systematically over - estimated at high redshift if all photometric information is included in the fit across the full redshift range .",
    "we therefore fit the models to the data in a series of redshift chunks  only the photometric information that lies longward of red - shifted lyman-@xmath14 is considered in each redshift chunk .",
    "the results described below are insensitive to whether the lyman limit is substituted for lyman-@xmath14 .",
    "first , we fit the models to p04 s @xmath156-band ground - based photometry ( i.e.  the @xmath157-band detection limits and the @xmath158-band detections listed in column 4 of table  [ table : imaging ] ) .",
    "note that p04 used different sized apertures for the near - infrared ( @xmath25 ) and optical ( @xmath18 ) photometry respectively .",
    "we find two acceptable solutions : @xmath87 and @xmath118 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : photoz ] ) , neither of which require any dust - obscuration within # 1916 , the latter having the lower formal @xmath151 value .",
    "we also scale p04 s ground - based optical non - detections to that appropriate for a consistent photometric aperture of three times the seeing disk at all wavelengths ( @xmath159 , @xmath160 , @xmath161 ) .",
    "this marginally improves the goodness of fit of the @xmath87 solution , and is otherwise indistinguishable from the original fit .",
    "we retain the matched photometric apertures for the remainder of this analysis .    to improve the discrimination between low- and high - redshift solutions , we add the sensitive _ hst_/wfpc2 detection threshold of @xmath162 ( table  [ table : imaging ] ) to the photometric constraints . we fit the synthetic seds to the combined @xmath163 dataset .",
    "the goodness of fit of the @xmath164 solution is marginally worse relative to the @xmath156-band analysis , because the most stringent optical non - detection comes from the @xmath68-band .",
    "however , in general , the @xmath151 as a function of redshift is indistinguishable between this fit and the @xmath156-band fits .",
    "this is probably because the @xmath151 is dominated by the non - detections in six out of the eight observed filters . to test this we re - fit the models , limiting the data to just the @xmath165-bands , i.e.  the most sensitive non - detection ( @xmath68 ) , the reddest non - detection ( @xmath73 ) and the two detections ( @xmath158 )",
    ". the impact of the sensitive detection limit from the _ hst _ data is now clearly evident in the new @xmath151 distribution , as shown in fig .",

    "we also show that inefficient bad - pixel rejection and issues relating to the calculation of the background noise can broadly account for the differences between p04 s near - infrared photometry and our own using the same data .",
    "the balance of probability is therefore that # 1916 was a false detection in p04 s analysis . from a broader perspective ,",
