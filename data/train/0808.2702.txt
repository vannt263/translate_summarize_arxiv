    "however , whether the matter can be qualified as the lattice qcd predicted quark - gluon plasma @xcite is still a matter of debate .",
    "@xmath0 suppression is long recognized as an important tool to identify the possible phase transition to quark - gluon plasma .",
    "matsui and satz @xcite , predicted that in presence of quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) , binding of a @xmath10 pair into a @xmath0 meson will be hindered , leading to the so called @xmath0 suppression in heavy ion collisions @xcite .",

    "@xmath0 s are suppressed in d+au , au+au and cu+cu collisions .",
    "suppression in d+au collisions is due to a number of cold nuclear matter ( cnm ) effects , e.g. gluon shadowing , gluon energy loss , @xmath0-nucleon inelastic collision .",
    "@xmath0 suppression in hot nuclear matter is measured in au+au and cu+cu collisions . in au+au",
    "/ cu+cu collisions , suppression increases with centrality of the collisions and in very peripheral collisions , suppression is consistent with cnm effects .",
    "also @xmath0 s are more suppressed in forward rapidity than at mid rapidity .",
    "measurements also indicate that models @xcite , which predict for @xmath0 enhancement in rhic energy collisions , are not consistent with experiments .",
    "on the other hand , phenomenological threshold model @xcite , which mimic the melting of @xmath0 s in a qgp medium , successfully explain the suppression in au+au collisions but not in cu+cu collisions @xcite .",

    "phenix data were analysed in the comover model .",
    "it was claimed that the comover model , including recombination , is consistent with the centrality dependence of @xmath0 suppression both in au+au and cu+cu collisions @xcite .",

    "briefly , it is assumed that in high energy nuclear collisions , a deconfined phase ( qgp ) is produced , which expands , cools , undergoes 1st order phase transition to hadronic fluid at the critical temperature ( @xmath13=164 mev ) and then further cools to freeze - out at temperature @xmath22=130 mev . assuming longitudinal boost - invariance , the space - time evolution of the fluid is obtained by solving the energy - momentum conservation equation @xmath23 @xcite .",

    "@xmath0 s are assumed to be produced in initial nn collisions .",

    "we have used the equation of state eos - q @xcite , incorporating 1st order phase transition with critical temperature @xmath13=164 mev .    to obtain the survival probability of @xmath0 s in an expanding medium , we proceed as follows : at the initial time @xmath34 , we randomly distribute a fixed number of @xmath0 s in the transverse plane .",
