    ", quantum nonlocality can be naturally expressed in terms of cooperative two - player one - round game with imperfect information , which is a game played by two players and a referee as follows .",
    "the players are kept in separate rooms so that they can not communicate with each other .",
    "the referee chooses a pair of questions according to some probability distribution , and sends one question to each player .",
    "each player replies with an answer to the referee , and the referee declares whether the two players jointly win or jointly lose according to the questions and the answers .",
    "the players know the protocol used by the referee including the probability distribution of the pair of questions and how the referee determines the final outcome of the game , but none of the players knows the question sent to the other player .",
    "the aim of the players is to win the game with as high probability as possible , and the maximum winning probability is called the _ value _ of the game . in this framework ,",
    "a bell inequality is an inequality stating an upper bound of the value of a game of this kind when provers are not allowed to perform any quantum operations , and the violation of a bell inequality means that the game value increases when provers are allowed to share a quantum state before the game starts .",
    "the complexity of finding or approximating the value of a game has been one of the most fundamental problems in computational complexity theory . the computational model based on cooperative multi - player games",
    "is called multi - prover interactive proof systems and were introduced by ben - or , goldwasser , kilian and wigderson  @xcite for a cryptographic purpose .",
    "it turned out that this computational model is extremely powerful : multi - prover interactive proof systems exactly characterize @xmath3  @xcite , even in the most restricted settings with two provers , one round and an exponentially small one - sided error  @xcite .",
    "in other words , given the description of a cooperative game , approximating the best strategy even in a very weak sense is notoriously difficult .",
    "these results were built on top of techniques developed in studies on ( single - prover ) interactive proof systems  @xcite as well as multi - prover interactive proof systems with weaker properties  @xcite .",
    "it is noteworthy that the powerfulness of multi - prover one - round interactive proof systems has led to a successful study of probabilistically checkable proof systems  @xcite , which play a central role in proving @xmath4-hardness of many approximation problems via the celebrated pcp theorem  @xcite .",
    "cleve , hyer , toner and watrous  @xcite connected the computational complexity theory and the quantum nonlocality and raised the question on the complexity of approximating the value of a cooperative game with imperfect information in the case where the players are allowed to share quantum states or , in terms of interactive proof systems , the computational power of multi - prover interactive proof systems with entangled provers . kobayashi and matsumoto  @xcite considered another quantum variation of multi - prover interactive proof systems where the verifier can also use quantum information and",
    "can exchange quantum messages with provers , which is a multi - prover analogue of quantum interactive proof systems  @xcite . in @xcite , it was shown that allowing the provers to share at most polynomially many qubits does not increase the power of multi - prover interactive proof systems beyond @xmath3 ( even if the verifier is quantum ) .",
    "although studied intensively  @xcite , the power of multi - prover interactive proof systems with provers allowed to share arbitrary quantum states has been still largely unknown .",
    "the notion of no - signaling strategies was first studied in physics in the context of bell inequalities by khalfin and tsirelson  @xcite and rastall  @xcite , and it has gained much attention after reintroduced by popescu and rohrlich  @xcite . the acceptance probability of the optimal no - signaling provers is often useful as an upper bound of the acceptance probability of entangled provers ( and even commuting - operator provers based on the notion of commuting - operator behaviors ; see  @xcite ) because no - signaling strategies have a simple mathematical characterization .",
    "toner  @xcite uses no - signaling provers to give the maximum acceptance probability of entangled provers in a certain game .",
    "extreme points of the set of no - signaling strategies are also studied  @xcite .",
    "kempe , kobayashi , matsumoto , toner and vidick  @xcite prove , among other results , that every language in @xmath0 has a two - prover one - round interactive proof system which has one - sided error @xmath5 even if honest provers are unentangled and dishonest provers are allowed to have prior entanglement of any size ( the proof is in @xcite ) .",
    "ito , kobayashi and matsumoto  @xcite improve their result to an exponentially small one - sided error by considering no - signaling provers ; more specifically , they prove that the soundness of the protocol in @xcite actually holds against arbitrary no - signaling provers , then use the parallel repetition theorem for no - signaling provers  @xcite .",
    "we note that the soundness analysis of @xcite is somewhat simpler than that of @xcite .    repeating the protocol of @xcite parallelly as is done in @xcite results in the protocol identical to the one used by cai , condon and lipton  @xcite to prove that every language in @xmath0 has a two - prover one - round interactive proof system with an exponentially small one - sided error in the classical world .",
    "therefore , an implication of @xcite is that the protocol in @xcite has an unexpected strong soundness property : the protocol remains to have an exponentially small error even if we allow the two provers to behave arbitrarily as long as they are no - signaling .    given that the soundness analysis of protocols against no - signaling provers is perhaps easier than that against entangled provers , it is tempting to try to extend the result of @xcite to a class of languages larger than @xmath0 .",
    "for example , is it possible to construct a two - prover one - round interactive proof system for @xmath3 which is sound against no - signaling provers ?",
    "the answer is no unless @xmath6 because two - prover one - round interactive proof systems with no - signaling provers can recognize at most @xmath7 as pointed out by preda  @xcite .",
    "then what about @xmath7 ?",
    "let @xmath2 be the class of languages having a two - prover one - round interactive proof system with no - signaling provers with bounded two - sided error .",
    "the abovementioned result in @xcite implies @xmath8 .",
    "preda  @xcite shows @xmath9 .",
    "our main result is :    [ theorem : mipns - in - pspace ] @xmath10 .",
    "an immediate corollary obtained by combining theorem  [ theorem : mipns - in - pspace ] with the abovementioned result in @xcite is the following exact characterization of the class  @xmath2 :    @xmath1 , and this is achievable with exponentially small one - sided error , even if honest provers are restricted to be unentangled .",
    "this puts the proof system of @xcite in a rather special position : while other two - prover one - round interactive proof systems  @xcite work with the whole @xmath3 , the one in @xcite attains the best achievable by two - prover one - round interactive proof systems with two - sided bounded error that are sound against no - signaling provers , and at the same time , it achieves an exponentially small one - sided error .    at a lower level ,",
    "our result is actually a parallel algorithm to approximately decide can be converted to an algorithm to approximate @xmath11 within an additive error in a standard way .",

    "<S> in two - prover one - round interactive proof systems , no - signaling provers are those who are allowed to use arbitrary strategies , not limited to local operations , as long as their strategies can not be used for communication between them . </S>",
    "<S> study of multi - prover interactive proof systems with no - signaling provers is motivated by study of those with provers sharing quantum states . </S>",
    "<S> the relation between them is that no - signaling strategies include all the strategies realizable by provers sharing arbitrary entangled quantum states , and more .    </S>",
    "<S> this paper shows that two - prover one - round interactive proof systems with no - signaling provers only accept languages in @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> combined with the protocol for @xmath0 by ito , kobayashi and matsumoto ( ccc 2009 ) , this implies @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the class of languages having a two - prover one - round interactive proof system with no - signaling provers . </S>",
    "<S> this is proved by constructing a fast parallel algorithm which approximates within an additive error the maximum value of a two - player one - round game achievable by cooperative no - signaling players . </S>",
    "<S> the algorithm uses the fast parallel algorithm for the mixed packing and covering problem by young ( focs 2001 ) . </S>"
