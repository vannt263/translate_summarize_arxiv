    "at a temperature of 340k and ambient pressure , stoichiometric @xmath7 undergoes a metal - insulator transition , which is accompanied by a structural transition from a high - temperature rutile phase to a low - temperature monoclinic phase @xcite . since its discovery more than fourty years ago",
    ", this transition has been attracting considerable interest for fundamental reasons , and for possible applications @xcite . the latter result from the abrupt change in the resistivity over several orders of magnitude , as well as from the fact that the transition occurs near room temperature @xcite . despite this strong motivation , our understanding of the origin of the phase transition is still far from complete .",
    "several models have been proposed ranging from peierls- @xcite to mott - hubbard - type @xcite scenarios .",
    "they stress , to a different degree , the role of lattice instabilities , electron - phonon interaction and electron - electron correlations .",
    "so far , neither of these approaches has been successful in explaining the broad range of phenomena occurring in vanadium dioxide . in particular , a complete and generally accepted picture of the physics of this material has not yet been developed .",
    "more generally , a comprehensive understanding of the rutile - related transition - metal dioxides is not available .",

    "interestingly , the distortions of the rutile structure found at the phase transitions of @xmath7 and @xmath9 are very similar for all the transition - metal dioxides which display such deviations , i.e.  for @xmath7 , @xmath9 , @xmath8 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25-@xmath26 @xcite .",
    "they are characterized by two distinct modes , namely a pairing of the metal atoms along characteristic chains parallel to the tetragonal @xmath27 axis , and a lateral zigzag - like displacement @xcite .",

    "the unit cell is twice as large as that of the rutile structure .",
    "@xmath9 is an exception : below the transition temperature this compound has a body - centered tetragonal lattice with a unit cell , which comprises 16 rutile cells @xcite . due to the strong metal - metal bonding within the chains parallel to the rutile @xmath27 axis , which causes the aforementioned pairing ,",
    "the above six dioxides have the smallest ratios of the symmetrized lattice constants @xmath28 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : intro1 ] ) .",
    "the structural similarities of the six compounds mentioned above are in contrast to their completely different electronic properties : while the @xmath10 compounds @xmath7 and @xmath9 undergo a metal - insulator transition , their four @xmath12 and @xmath13 neighbours like all other @xmath21 and @xmath22 compounds listed in tab .",
    "[ tab : intro1 ] remain metallic at all temperatures .",
    "an explanation for this diversity is still lacking . the different trends in the structural and electronic properties within the transition - metal dioxides at the beginning of the @xmath6 series led goodenough to rule out the jahn - teller effect as a major source for the crystal structure characteristics @xcite .",
    "mechanisms based on fermi surface nesting could be excluded due to the change in @xmath6 electron occupation . a comprehensive theory , explaining both the structural similarities of all the above transition - metal dioxides and the diversity in their electronic properties on an equal footing , is still missing .",
    "the discovery of two additional insulating low - temperature phases of @xmath7 led to further complications .",
    "these phases , denoted @xmath29 and @xmath1 , appear on doping or applying uniaxial pressure .",

    "their crystallographic distortions and magnetic properties add to the wealth of phenomena observed in vanadium dioxide , and demonstrate even more our lack in understanding .",

    "the purpose of this work is twofold .",
    "first , by investigating a large class of related compounds within the same theoretical approach , we are able to develop a more comprehensive understanding of the relevant mechanisms .",
    "second , our density functional calculations benefit from the fact that they do not depend on adjustable parameters . hence , despite possible limitations arising from the local density approximation , they establish a reference , which can be directly compared to experimental data .",
    "finally , our results can be used as the starting point for more elaborate treatments , as e.g.  the lda+dmft approach , which only recently has proven very successful in modelling the symmetry conserving metal - insulator transition of @xmath30 @xcite .",

    "the important role of the lattice degrees of freedom for the stabilization of the different phases of @xmath7 has been deduced from several experiments , which revealed striking differences between the metallic and the insulating state .",
    "together with the symmetry change at the metal - insulator transition these findings were taken as evidence for strong electron - phonon coupling and a lattice softening at the transition @xcite .",
    "of course , this became most obvious from the fact that crystals could even break at the transition @xcite .",
    "furthermore , x - ray measurements revealed large thermal displacements in the rutile phase of both stoichiometric and cr - doped @xmath7 , which exceed the values measured in the respective low - temperature phases as well as in the neighbouring rutile compounds @xmath18 and @xmath19 considerably @xcite . rao _",
    "et al . _  observed a large anisotropy of the thermal expansion in the rutile phase ( @xmath32 ) @xcite , which causes a strong temperature dependence of the electric field gradient at the vanadium site @xcite .",
    "in addition , an anisotropic change of the lattice constants at the phase transition was reported @xcite : while the rutile @xmath27 axis increases by @xmath33% the @xmath34 axis decreases by @xmath35% . at the same time , the volume changes discontinuously by -0.044% and the thermal expansion coefficient drops by a factor of three @xcite .",
    "ultrasonic microscopy revealed a strong elastic anisotropy in the metallic phase , which disappears almost completely in the insulating state @xcite .",
    "x - ray diffuse scattering measurements performed just above the metal - insulator transition by terauchi and cohen @xcite indicated a lattice instability at the tetragonal r - point with a wave vector parallel to @xmath36-r and a polarization vector parallel to the @xmath27 axis .",
    "this result confirmed the symmetry analysis by brews , who showed the rutile - to - monoclinic transition to be compatible with a phonon instability at the r - point @xcite .",
    "indeed , using a shell model to calculate the phonon dispersion of several rutile - type compounds , gervais and kress found a phonon softening at the tetragonal r - point for @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the analysis of the eigenvectors of the r - point soft mode resulted in a displacement pattern of the metal atoms equivalent to that of the monoclinic phase @xcite .",
    "finally , an oxygen isotope effect was observed for the transition temperature @xcite .",

    "which is only twice as large parallel to the rutile @xmath27 axis as compared to its in - plane value @xcite , has been attributed to the existence of at least two different bands near the fermi energy and a rather complex fermi surface @xcite . the same conclusion was drawn from optical , seebeck coefficient and magnetization measurements @xcite . for the insulating phase",
    ", photoemission studies revealed a sharpening and downshift of the occupied v @xmath17 bands @xcite relative to the metallic phase .",
    "xas measurements showed a splitting of the lowest unoccupied @xmath17 state @xcite .",

    "theoretical approaches to the insulating ground state of @xmath7 as well as to the metal - insulator transition range from phenomenological models to first principles studies . in a survey over oxides with",
    "octahedrally coordinated transition metals , goodenough pointed out the important role of direct cation - cation interactions , which add to and often supersede the cation - anion - cation interactions @xcite .",
    "if strong enough , the cation - cation interactions may give rise to a covalent - type bonding at low temperatures .",
    "this bonding would go along with a displacement of the metal atom away from the center of symmetry of the anion interstice as well as with a spin pairing of the bonding electrons . in the case of @xmath7",
    ", the latter would explain the observed curie - weiss behaviour above @xmath41 and the small temperature - independent van vleck susceptibility below @xmath41 @xcite . since those @xmath6 electrons , which are responsible for the metal - metal bonding , do not contribute to metallic conductivity",
    ", the phase transition may be from the metallic to the semiconducting state @xcite .",

    "the number of excited carriers adler and brooks demonstrated that a system with a half - filled conduction band will lower its total energy and enter an insulating state by developing either antiferromagnetic order or a crystalline distortion @xcite .",
    "lateron , goodenough presented a schematic energy band diagram for both the metallic and the insulating phase @xcite . using electrostatic considerations for the effective ionic charges he placed the oxygen @xmath37 levels well below the vanadium @xmath17 states .",
    "the latter are subject to octahedral crystal field splitting into lower @xmath42 and higher @xmath43 levels .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath42 states , which are located near the fermi energy , are split into a @xmath3 state , which is directed along the rutile @xmath27 axis , and the remaining @xmath44 states , see fig .",

    "in contrast , the @xmath44 bands move to higher energies due to the antiferroelectric zigzag - type displacement of the vanadium atoms . as a result",
    ", a band gap opens between the bonding @xmath3 band and the other @xmath42 bands . according to shin _",
    "et al . _",
    "the @xmath3 band splitting amounts to @xmath45ev , while the @xmath44 bands raise by @xmath46ev @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , in proposing this scheme goodenough questioned the covalent - type bonding arising from metal - metal pairing as the major source of the phase transition .",
    "instead , he suggested that the metal - insulator transition results predominantly from the increased @xmath5@xmath6 overlap coming with the antiferroelectric distortion of the @xmath47 octahedra @xcite .",
    "it would lower and raise the bonding and antibonding @xmath48 and @xmath44 levels .",
    "the @xmath3 states would be split as a consequence of the symmetry change .",
    "eventually this would open the optical band gap . using the general band scheme sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : intro2 ] , hearn performed numerical calculations for one - dimensional vanadium chains and demonstrated the validity of the scenario outlined by goodenough @xcite .",
    "a mechanism differing from the molecular orbital picture of goodenough was proposed by zylbersztejn and mott .",
    "these authors attributed the coupled metal - insulator and structural transition to the presence of strong electron - electron correlations especially in the @xmath3 band rather than to electron - lattice interaction @xcite . however , as zylbersztejn and mott argue , these correlations are efficiently screened by the @xmath44 bands in the metallic phase . in the insulating phase , the screening of the @xmath3 electrons is diminished since the @xmath44 bands experience energetical upshift due to the antiferroelectric displacement of the v atoms . as a consequence ,",
    "the narrow @xmath3 bands at the fermi energy are susceptible to strong coulomb correlations and undergo a mott transition .",
    "this opens the optical band gap .",
    "lateron , paquet and leroux - hugon presented a band model for @xmath7 , which aimed at incorporating both the electron - electron interactions and the electron - lattice coupling on an equal footing @xcite .",
    "to do so , the authors started from a tight - binding representation for the @xmath3 and @xmath44 bands .",
    "in addition , they included hubbard - type interactions for both bands as well as a contribution due to the phonons . using experimentally derived parameters paquet and",
    "leroux - hugon concluded that the metal - insulator transition is primarily driven by electron - electron correlations .",
    "however , these correlations would be strongly renormalized by the lattice distortion and the electrostatic interaction between the @xmath3 and the @xmath44 electrons .",
    "first principles studies for rutile @xmath7 range from calculations using semiempirical or overlapping free atom potentials @xcite to self - consistent state - of - the - art investigations @xcite .",
    "work on the insulating and monoclinic ( @xmath0 ) phase includes a semiempirical calculation @xcite , the molecular dynamics study by wentzcovitch _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , state - of - the - art investigations using the lda and lda+u @xcite , and a recent model gw calculation @xcite .",
    "most of these calculations confirmed the general molecular - orbital scheme sketched by goodenough .",
    "they found the same order of bands for the metallic phase and related the change in electronic structure occurring at the phase transition to the simultaneous symmetry - lowering distortions of the crystal structure . from a maximum in the generalized susceptibility occurring at the tetragonal r - point , which could be traced back exclusively to the @xmath3 bands , gupta _ et al .",
    "_  concluded that the phase transition could be due to formation of a charge - density wave accompanied by a periodic lattice distortion leading to the monoclinic @xmath0 structure @xcite .",
    "support for the predominant influence of the lattice degrees of freedom on the transition came from first principles molecular dynamics calculations by wentzcovitch _",
    "their variable cell shape approach allowed for simultaneously relaxing the atomic positions and the primitive translations . as a result , starting from different intermediate structures these authors obtained the monoclinic @xmath0 structure as the most stable one .",
    "in addition , a slightly metastable rutile structure was found , which was about 54 mev per f.u .",
    "higher in energy as compared to the @xmath0 structure .",
    "calculated crystal structure parameters for both cells were in good agreement with the experimental data ( see sec .",
    "[ cryst ] ) .",
    "however , the band structure obtained for monoclinic @xmath7 contrasted the experimental finding of an 0.6ev wide insulating gap @xcite . instead , semimetallic behaviour with a band overlap of 0.04ev was found @xcite .",
    "this result was attributed to the typical failure of the local density approximation to correctly reproduce measured optical band gaps .",
    "the situation is thus not unlike that in small band gap semiconductors as ge , where use of the local density approximation likewise leads to a metallic ground state .",
    "et al . _",
    "suspected that , by further strengthening the v ",
    "v bonds , the gap should eventually open and , hence , @xmath7 could be regarded as a band insulator .",
    "this was interpreted as assertion of the energy band scheme by goodenough @xcite .",
    "more recent studies using the local density approximation confirmed the results presented by wentzcovitch _",
    "et al . _  in",
    "that they also found semimetallic rather than semiconducting behaviour @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , a recent lda+u approach and a quasiparticle band structure calculation as based on a model gw scheme produced the correct optical band gap @xcite .    despite the huge amount of theoretical investigations there still remain fundamental questions .",
    "first of all , none of the previous studies has presented a detailed analysis of the band structure or the density of states in terms of the orbitals discussed by goodenough .",
    "for this reason , the molecular orbital considerations as well as the more recent model approaches lack a profound justification .",
    "in addition , most of the previous studies , including those of goodenough as well as zylbersztejn and mott , emphasize the role of the @xmath44 bands for the transition . yet , as will be discussed in more detail in sec .",
    "[ cryst ] , the role of the zigzag - like displacement of the metal atoms for the metal - insulator transition is still unclear .",
    "this is related to the different response of the surrounding oxygen atoms . in @xmath7 ,",
    "the oxygen atoms stay essentially at their original positions and the vanadium atom shifts lead to an an increased metal - oxygen bonding .",
    "this causes an energetical upshift of the @xmath44 bands .",
    "in contrast , in @xmath8 the metal atom displacements are to a large part compensated by the accompanying shift of the oxygen octahedron . as a consequence , the zigzag - like displacement of the metal atoms does not lead to an increased metal - oxygen bonding . as a consequence , it does not generally act as an antiferroelectric mode .",
    "hence , the zigzag - like displacement can not be regarded as a common origin for the destabilization of the rutile structure .",
    "the understanding of @xmath7 and the metal - insulator transition is even more complicated due to the presence of two additional phases of this material .",
    "they appear on application of uniaxial stress or on doping of @xmath7 with small amounts of cr , fe , al , or ga of the order of few percent @xcite .",
    "the phase diagram of cr doped @xmath7 as given by pouget and launois @xcite is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : phasdg ] .     according to pouget and launois @xcite .",
    "the distortion patterns of the metallic chains are given in the insets ( open circles in the t phase refer to the positions of the @xmath1 phase).,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    this phase diagram differs slightly from that given by other authors , which fact has been attributed to differences in sample preparation and stoichiometry @xcite .",
    "lateron , a similar phase diagram was reported for @xmath50 by ghedira _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite . according to fig .",
    "[ fig : phasdg ] , cr - doped @xmath7 enters , on cooling , the monoclinic @xmath1 phase in a first order metal - insulator transition @xcite . on further lowering of the temperature , transition to the triclinic t phase occurs , which , for chromium concentrations smaller than 0.015 , is followed by a first order transition to the monoclinic @xmath0 phase @xcite . according to x - ray measurements by marezio _",
    "_ , each of the three low - temperature phases shows a particular distortion pattern of the atomic arrangement especially of the characteristic vanadium chains @xcite .",
    "whereas in the @xmath0 phase both the metal - metal pairing and the zigzag - type lateral displacement are observed on each chain , in the @xmath1 phase only half of the chains dimerize and the zigzag - type deviations are reserved to the other half of the chains . finally , the t phase is intermediate , as those chains , which in the @xmath1 phase dimerize , gradually start to tilt , whereas the zigzag chains start to dimerize until distortions in both chains are identical and eventually the @xmath0 phase is reached .",
    "hence , the t and @xmath0 phases can be regarded as superpositions of two @xmath1-type displacements with unequal and equal weights , respectively .",
    "the role of the latter displacement pattern as the `` fundamental '' one may be understood from the symmetry considerations presented by pouget _",
    "et al . _  as well as by paquet and leroux - hugon @xcite .",
    "according to these ideas the pairing on one chain is intimately connected with the zigzag - type displacement on the neighbouring chains : if the vanadium atoms pair on one chain , the atoms on the neighbouring chains , which from the outset are vertically displaced by half the rutile @xmath27 axis , move off the chain axis towards the apical oxygen atom whose v neighbours of the first sublattice have pulled apart .",
    "for this reason , the zigzag - like displacement may be viewed as being coupled to the metal - metal pairing along the rutile @xmath27 axis .",
    "@xmath51-nmr measurements by pouget _",
    "_  confirmed the x - ray experiments performed by marezio _",
    "et al._. they revealed a positive knight shift for the @xmath0 phase of @xmath52 , which is similar to that of pure @xmath7 .",
    "in contrast , both a positive and a negative knight shift were observed in the @xmath1 phase indicating two different types of vanadium atoms @xcite . whereas the positive knight shift again points to paired v sites the negative knight shift gives evidence for @xmath53 atoms with localized @xmath17 electrons . finally , as dhaenens _ et al . _  found from esr data , the chromium atoms enter as substitutional @xmath54 ions on the zigzag - type chains @xcite .",
    "magnetic susceptibility curves taken by pouget _",
    "_  for @xmath52 showed a striking similarity to corresponding data for fe - doped @xmath7 as measured by kosuge @xcite .",
    "they could be decomposed into a van vleck contribution for the paired vanadium chains , a curie - weiss term representing the @xmath54 spins and an almost constant residual term . using a model by bonner and fisher @xcite , pouget _ et al .",
    "_  were able to attribute the latter contribution to noninteracting spin-@xmath55 linear heisenberg chains , formed by the equispaced vanadium atoms , with an exchange constant of the order of room temperature @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 to t transition was thus viewed as a bonding or dimerization transition of a linear heisenberg chain .",
    "this interpretation was confirmed by the observed decrease of the magnetic susceptibility at the transition , which is accompanied by an increase of the electrical conductivity by a factor of two @xcite . from the existence of well localized @xmath17 electrons at the @xmath53 sites ,",
    "pouget _ et al .",
    "_  concluded that the results should be interpreted in terms of a mott - hubbard - type picture . in doing so , they attributed the insulating gap to electronic correlations @xcite .",
    "lateron , pouget _ et al .",
    "_  demonstrated that both the @xmath1 and t phase could be likewise stabilized by applying uniaxial stress along either the @xmath56 $ ] or the @xmath57 $ ] direction in stoichiometric @xmath7 samples @xcite .",
    "such uniaxial stress can be viewed as suppressing the zigzag - type displacements on those chains , which have their tilting along the direction of the applied stress , while the respective other chains are not affected . however , from the above symmetry considerations it follows that , as a consequence of the reduced tilt on one half of the chains , the pairing on the other chains will be also reduced .",
    "additional nmr and epr data revealed that the local symmetries as well as the magnetic properties of the two vanadium sites are identical in pure @xmath7 under uniaxial stress and in @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "as pouget _ et al .",
    "_  pointed out , the critical uniaxial stress for appearance of the @xmath1 phase is so small that the free energies of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 phases in pure @xmath7 must be extremely close at temperatures just below the metal - insulator transition @xcite .",
    "the same conclusion was drawn by pouget _",
    "et al . _  for doped @xmath7",
    "these authors pointed to the fact that , although the @xmath1 and t phases involve substantial changes in the vanadium atom positions , they could be stabilized by impurity concentrations as low as 0.2% @xcite . according to pouget _ et al . _  the @xmath1 and the t phase thus must be interpreted as alternative phases of pure @xmath7 whose free energies are only slightly higher than that of the @xmath0 phase of the pure material @xcite .",
    "as a consequence , the @xmath1 phase was regarded as a metastable modification of the @xmath0 phase .",
    "in contrast , the t phase appears as a transitional state , which displays characteristics of both monoclinic phases .",
    "the discovery of the @xmath1 phase with its two different types of vanadium chains was difficult to reconcile with all those theoretical approaches , which had explained the insulating ground state as originating from crystal structure distortions with a predominant influence of either the pairing or the zigzag - type displacement .",
    "furthermore , from the presence of localized @xmath17 electrons on the zigzag chains and the antiferromagnetic ordering of the local moments within non - interacting linear heisenberg chains many authors concluded that band theory were unable to correctly describe the physics of the @xmath1 and , hence , also of the @xmath0 phase .",
    "instead , electronic correlations were regarded as essential and localized models called for @xcite . yet ,",
    "an explanation of the physics of @xmath7 purely in terms of a mott - hubbard - type picture might be difficult in view of the complex structural changes at the metal - insulator transitions , which lead to the same crystal structures as those of the neighbouring metallic transition - metal dioxides .",
    "although , as rice _",
    "_  have pointed out again only recently @xcite , discussion of the monoclinic @xmath1 phase of @xmath7 is essential for a comprehensive understanding of the physics underlying the metal - insulator transition , state - of - the - art first principles calculations for this phase did not seem to exist . in order to close this gap we included an investigation of the monoclinic @xmath1 phase in the present study @xcite .",
    "again , our aim is to provide an as broad as possible picture of the physics of the rutile - type transition metal oxides using a well defined first principles approach .    to be specific ,",
    "since the low - temperature @xmath0 and @xmath1 phases involve characteristic but still relative small deviations from the rutile phase we follow the lines of our work on @xmath8 and @xmath9 and start out investigating the rutile structure @xcite .",
    "the results will then serve as a reference for the subsequent investigation of the low - temperature phases .",

    "in contrast , the metal atom pairing leads to two short and two long equatorial v  o bond lengths of 1.86 , 1.89 , 2.03 , and 2.06 .",
    "iii ) there is a lattice strain which causes deviations of the ratios @xmath97 from unity .    despite the many similarities of the monoclinic structures of @xmath8 and",
    "@xmath7 a more detailed analysis of the crystal structure data reveals striking differences between both compounds .",
    "they regard the zigzag - like in - plane displacements of the metal atoms and the distortions of the surrounding oxygen octahedra : i ) in @xmath8 the in - plane shift makes an angle of @xmath98 with the local @xmath68 axis . in contrast , the vanadium atoms , in addition to dimerizing along the rutile @xmath27 axis , experience in - plane shifts , which are parallel to the local @xmath68 axis , hence , parallel to the @xmath99 direction .",
    "ii ) even more striking is the different response of the oxygen sublattice to the displacements of the metal atoms . in @xmath7",
    "the oxygen atoms do not follow the metal atom shifts and stay almost at their original positions .",
    "in contrast , the oxygen atoms in @xmath8 , while hardly moving parallel to the rutile @xmath27 axis , follow the lateral displacements of the molybdenum atoms to a large degree .",
    "hence , in @xmath7 the lateral displacement of the vanadium atoms causes a shift _ relative _ to the rather fixed oxygen octahedra such that the @xmath5@xmath6-like metal - oxygen bonding is affected .",
    "this is different in @xmath8 , where the molybdenum atom displacements are compensated to a large degree by the simultaneous shift of the surrounding oxygen atoms . in other words ,",
    "the zigzag - type in - plane displacement of the metal atoms does not automatically lead to an ( anti)ferroelectric distortion of the whole octahedron , but may still be compensated by a corresponding displacement of the surrounding oxygen cage .",
    "nevertheless , according to the symmetry considerations pointed out e.g.  by paquet and leroux - hugon , the zigzag - type shift is still coupled to the vertical metal - metal pairing , the previous observation and especially the different behaviour of the two dioxides has strong implications for our understanding of the whole class of materials . as has been discussed in sec .  [ survey ] , the lateral zigzag - like displacement of the metal atoms could lead to energetical upshift of the @xmath44 bands .",
    "however , if compensated by accompanying oxygen displacements , this antiferroelectric mode is deactivated and the @xmath44 bands stay at their original position .",
    "this has indeed been observed in our calculations for @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "we are thus led to the conclusion that the antiferroelectric mode can not explain the tendency of the transition - metal dioxides to form distorted variants of the rutile structure . for the same reason",
    ", this mode must be excluded as the driving force for the metal - insulator transition , which is intimately connected to the destabilization of rutile .",
