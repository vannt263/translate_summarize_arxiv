    "the recent developments in non - perturbative string theory have provided new tools to investigate non - perturbative features of field theory .",
    "many supersymmetric gauge theories can be studied as effective field theories on branes . in this picture , the non - perturbative features of the supersymmetric gauge theories are tightly related to those of string theory .",
    "a bps state of string theory has a correspondence to a bps state of the effective field theory on the brane .",
    "the 3 + 1 dimensional @xmath0 @xmath2 supersymmetric yang - mills ( sym ) theory broken spontaneously to @xmath3 can be studied as an effective field theory on @xmath4 parallel d3-branes @xcite .",
    "since a d3-brane is an invariant object under the @xmath5 duality transformation of iib string theory , the @xmath5 duality implies the @xmath5 duality symmetry @xcite of the @xmath0 sym theory .",
    "a fundamental string between different d3-branes corresponds to a w - boson of the sym theory , which is a bps state preserving @xmath6 of the supersymmetries on the d3-branes . by performing the @xmath5 duality transformation on the configurations",
    ", a @xmath7 string should correspond to a bps state of the field theory with electric charge @xmath8 and magnetic charge @xmath9 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are relatively prime integers .",
    "the state with @xmath10 and @xmath11 is a monopole , while states with @xmath12 and @xmath11 are dyons .",
    "their field configurations are explicitly known in the form of the prasad - sommerfield solution @xcite .",
    "it is a difficult question whether the other dyon states exist as well in the field theory . in the simplest case of @xmath13 with @xmath14 ,",
    "the existence was shown by the quantization of the collective modes of the two monopole solutions @xcite .",
    "recently , bps configurations of iib strings with 3-string junctions have been attracting attentions .",
    "it was conjectured originally in @xcite that a 3-string junction would exist under both the conditions that the forces from the three strings should balance and that the @xmath7 charges of the three strings should conserve at the junction .",
    "the bps feature of the 3-string junction has been shown recently by several authors in both the string picture @xcite and the m - theory picture @xcite .",
    "the relations to the bps states of field theory have been discussed in several contexts @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the u - dual of the hanany - witten effect @xcite implies the existence of a certain series of 3-string junctions , and they were used in the description of the exceptional lie groups @xcite . on the other hand , requiring only the above two conditions of 3-string junction , more bps string states were observed than those expected in field theory @xcite .",
    "the selection rule of proper bps string states has not been established yet .",
    "thus it would be interesting to show explicitly the existence of the field theory bps states corresponding to some bps string states with 3-string junctions in a simple context .",
    "since a iib string with any @xmath7 charge can end on a d3-brane , there would be a bps state of @xmath0 sym theory corresponding to a 3-string junction connecting three different d3-branes .",
    "these bps states preserve only @xmath15 of the d3-brane world volume supersymmetry , and hence these states are different from the bps states mentioned above .",
    "an evidence for the existence of such bps states in @xmath0 sym theory was recently obtained in @xcite .",
    "the author argued that such a bps state has non - parallel electric and magnetic charges in the world volume theory , and showed that , under the assumption of bps saturation , the mass of such a state agrees with the mass obtained from the iib string picture .    in this paper",
    ", we find spherically symmetric regular solutions to the bogomolnyi equations in the cases of non - parallel electric and magnetic charges .",
    "our general solution corresponds to the three - pronged strings carrying charges @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 take arbitrary real values .",
    "since we are interested in the 3-string junction , let us consider the simplest case of three d3-brane system , and hence the 3 + 1 dimensional @xmath0 sym system with gauge group @xmath1 . among the six scalar fields describing the transverse coordinates of the d3-branes , we keep only the two , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , corresponding to the two dimensional plane on which the three - pronged strings lie .",

    "we have put the yang - mills coupling constant equal to one , and shall consider the case of vanishing vacuum theta angle .",

    "note that eq .",
    "( [ eq : theta ] ) is an automatic consequence of the two equations ( [ eq : dx = b+e ] ) and ( [ eq : dy = b+e ] ) and need not be imposed separately .",
    "suppose that we have a static solution @xmath35 to the equations ( [ eq : dx = b+e])([eq : dflat ] ) and ( [ eq : de=0 ] ) , and that their asymptotic ( @xmath36 ) forms are , after a suitable gauge transformation , given ( locally ) as follows : @xmath37 with @xmath38 .",
    "this solution represents a configuration of three d3-branes @xmath39 at transverse coordinates",
    "@xmath40 from which a string with magnetic and electric charges @xmath41 are emerging in the direction @xmath42 .",
    "this is because the eigenvalues of the scalars @xmath43 are interpreted as the transverse coordinates of the d3-branes and the `` tube - like '' part of the d3-brane surface ( corresponding to small @xmath44 ) can be regarded as a string @xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : tube ] ) .    of course , @xmath42 are not arbitrary but should be determined in terms of other parameters of the solution . in fact , this relation can be obtained by the analysis in the asymptotic region without concretely solving the differential equations : multiplying eqs .",
    "( [ eq : dx = b+e ] ) and ( [ eq : dy = b+e ] ) with either @xmath45 or @xmath46 , we obtain a gauge invariant equation @xmath47 and three others . plugging the asymptotic expressions ( [ eq : asx])([eq : asb ] ) into these equations and comparing the @xmath48 terms , here , we have to assume that the @xmath49 terms are missing from @xmath46 and @xmath45",
    ". this assumption will prove valid in the concrete solutions given later .",
    "] we get the known relation between the directions of the strings and their charges @xcite : @xmath50    the above observations in the asymptotic region lead to the standard picture of the 3-string junction ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:3jun ] ) : we can show that the three straight lines starting at @xmath40 in the direction @xmath42 meet at a common point .",
    "hence , these straight lines can be regarded as iib strings forming a junction .",
    "in fact , the force balance relation , @xmath51 , holds by taking @xmath52 as the string tension .",
    "furthermore , the sum of the masses of the three strings , @xmath53 , with @xmath54 being the length of the @xmath19-th straight line , coincides with the bps bound ( [ eq : bpsbound ] ) of the sym hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "however , we shall see that the configurations of the 3-string junctions obtained from the eigenvalues of the scalars @xmath43 of the classical solutions of sym constructed below have more complicated structures than the above string picture .",
    "since the angle @xmath27 can be absorbed by the rotation in the @xmath43 plane , we restrict ourselves to the case with @xmath55 .",
    "then , equations to be solved are @xmath56 as well as ( [ eq : d0x=0 ] ) , ( [ eq : dflat ] ) and ( [ eq : de=0 ] ) .",

    "( [ eq : r0 ] ) implies the followings : first , since both the scalars @xmath21 and @xmath22 representing the d3-brane transverse coordinates vanish at @xmath96 , the three d3-brane surface meet at the origin @xmath107 of the transverse plane .",
    "second , among the three d3-branes , the branes 1 and 3 are `` smoothly '' connected at the origin ( namely , they have a common tangent at the junction ) , while the brane 2 meets with the other two with an angle .",
    "next let us consider eq .",
    "( [ eq : diff ] ) near @xmath108 . since both the quantities @xmath109 and @xmath110 which appear in eq .",
    "( [ eq : diff ] ) decay exponentially as @xmath36 , the leading behavior of @xmath21 is in fact given by ( [ eq : asx ] ) , and the next order terms are exponentially dumping ones .",
    "the other scalar @xmath22 behaves in a similar manner at infinity .",
    "this fact , together with the formulas @xmath111 and @xmath112 on the @xmath74-axis , which are consequence of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : dx = e ] ) , ( [ eq : dy = b ] ) and ( [ eq : dx2 ] ) , implies the validity of the assumption we made in deriving eq .",
    "( [ eq:(u , v ) ] ) : the @xmath113 terms are missing from @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "though it seems difficult to solve analytically the differential equation ( [ eq : diff ] ) for arbitrary @xmath116 , exact solutions are obtained for the following special values of @xmath116 : @xmath117 with @xmath118 being a real and positive constant .",

    "these solutions are consistent with ( [ eq : solnpr0 ] ) by the identifications @xmath124 and @xmath125 .    from eq .",
    "( [ eq : solution ] ) , we can read off the following values for the locations of the d3-branes and the electric and magnetic charges of the strings : @xmath126    in particular , for @xmath127 , the three charges are @xmath128 , @xmath129 and @xmath130 . in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] , we plot the trajectories of the d3-brane coordinates in course of changing @xmath131 by the solid lines .",
    "in course of decreasing @xmath131 , the d3-branes approach the origin of @xmath132 and meet there at @xmath133 , where the gauge symmetry is restored .",
    "the trajectory of the brane @xmath134 is just a straight line .",
    "this is a general feature of our exact solutions and comes from the boundary condition @xmath135 .",
    "we obtain a bending trajectory of @xmath134 for a general case of @xmath136 , in which we solved the equations only numerically .",
    "the branes @xmath137 and @xmath138 connect smoothly to each other at the origin , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec:3.1 ] .",
    "noticing the fact that the brane @xmath134 has no magnetic charge by the electric and magnetic charges of the brane @xmath139 . ] while the branes @xmath137 and @xmath138 have non - zero magnetic charges , this might come from our technical preference that we describe the bps states by the classical treatment of the sym theory , i.e.  electrically .",
    "then the interpretation of the trajectories might be that the branes @xmath137 and @xmath138 are the two parts of one very heavy smooth magnetic object pulled and bent by the light electric brane @xmath134 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] , we also draw three dashed straight lines tangent to the d3-brane trajectories at @xmath140 .",
    "they meet at one point . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] , this configuration agrees with the three - pronged strings in the iib string picture .",
    "we have obtained bps saturated spherically symmetric regular configurations in @xmath0 @xmath1 sym theory carrying non - parallel electric and magnetic charges @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 take arbitrary real values . regarding the @xmath0 sym theory as an effective field theory on parallel d3-branes ,",
    "the solutions correspond to 3-string junctions connecting three different d3-branes . assuming the quantization of the electric charges @xmath19 and @xmath20 and the @xmath5 duality symmetry , our solutions imply , in general , the existence of the junctions of the three iib strings carrying the two - form charges @xmath7 , @xmath141 and @xmath142 , respectively , where @xmath143 are integers satisfying @xmath144 .    as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] , the asymptotic behavior at @xmath145 of our solutions leads to the configuration of three - pronged strings in the iib string picture , i.e. three straight strings meet at one point and their forces balance .",
    "this would be a non - trivial consistency check of our approach .",
    "on the other hand , the behavior of our solution at finite @xmath131 is quite different from the above iib string picture .",
    "the trajectories of the d3-branes bend non - trivially , and the two magnetically charged d3-branes connect smoothly to each other . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec:3.2 ] , this might be due to the fact that we did not treat the problem in an @xmath5 invariant way , but obtained the bps configurations by the classical treatment of the sym theory , i.e.  electrically .",
    "another difference between our solutions and the iib string picture is the number of degrees of freedom .",
    "now let us count the number of degrees of freedom of a 3-string junction in the string picture .",
    "as for the charges , the three magnetic charges are fixed to ( [ eq : g ] ) from the beginning , but we have the freedom of two electric charges ( the other electric charge is determined by the charge conservation ) .",
    "then , since the string tensions are determined by the charges , the relative directions of the three strings are determined by the force balance condition .",
    "we have the freedom to choose the lengths of each string .",
    "we should not count the freedom of rotating or shifting parallelly the 3-string junction in the two - dimensional plane , because we fixed these degrees of freedom in solving the equations .",
    "we absorbed the angle @xmath27 in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] , and the center of the three d3-branes are fixed by the tracelessness of the adjoint scalar fields .",
    "thus we have in total five degrees of freedom in the string picture .",
    "this does not agree with four , the number of degrees of freedom of our solutions obtained in sec .",
    "[ sec:3.1 ] .",
    "this difference might again come from the limitation of the electric description of the 3-string junction .",
    "since electrically charged objects are the fundamental degrees of freedom themselves in the electric description , the introduction of a bare electric charge would necessarily cause the problem of singularities in the solutions .",
    "nevertheless , in our solutions , we have one d3-brane ( @xmath134 in fig .  [ fig:3 ] ) which is charged only electrically .",
    "however , we may have the possibility that , if we had the freedom to introduce a bare electric charge , the number of the degrees of freedom would increase from four to five .    in fact , the difficulty of a bare electric charge appears in a different way in our construction of the solutions .",
    "we took the maximal embedding of @xmath13 to @xmath1 in this paper .",
    "because of this , the magnetic charge is 2 and not 1 . taking the minimal embedding of @xmath13 does not work .",
    "it turns out that , to obtain non - parallel electric and magnetic charges , we have a singularity at the origin , which is the bare source of the electric field .",
    "we tried another way to introduce a unit magnetic charge . in the degenerate case of @xmath146 ,",
    "the magnetic charges of the d3-branes become @xmath147 @xcite . but in this case the asymptotic behavior at @xmath145 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : diff ] ) changes from the non - degenerate cases , and the solutions regular at @xmath133 diverge at @xmath148 ( @xmath149 ) except the case of parallel electric and magnetic charges .",
    "thus we could not introduce one unit of magnetic charge in our solutions .",
    "since the monopole solutions for the general @xmath2 case are also known , it would be an interesting extension to find bps saturated solutions carrying non - parallel electric and magnetic charges for general @xmath2 and compare them with the string picture .",
