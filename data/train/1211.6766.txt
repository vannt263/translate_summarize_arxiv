    "can be reformulated as a global resilient statement with an additional constraint : if one deletes fewer than @xmath16 edges from the complete bipartite graph @xmath17 while preserving hamiltonicity , then the resulting graph is always bipancyclic .    in this paper",
    ", we study bipancyclicity of random bipartite graphs in the context of global resilience by extending theorem 1 .",

    "it suffices to show that , conditioned on the above two events , every hamiltonian subgraph @xmath292 with more than @xmath106 edges contains a @xmath9-cycle .",
    "fix such a subgraph @xmath4 and an allowable labeling of the vertices such that @xmath111 is a hamilton cycle in @xmath4 , and set @xmath293 .",
    "based on our above observation , we only need to show that for some @xmath113 $ ] , the graph @xmath4 contains two edges @xmath248 and @xmath249 which form a close crossing .",
    "denote by @xmath294 the set of directions that are @xmath260-good in @xmath11 .",
    "hence , @xmath295 by our condition .",
    "let @xmath49 be the number of close crossings between pairs of edges in @xmath11 which came from @xmath241 and @xmath280 satisfying @xmath296 . in the following , we assume @xmath297 ( if @xmath8 is odd , it clearly holds ; if @xmath8 is even , the proof is similar and we leave it to the reader ) . under this assumption",
    ", we have @xmath298 .",
    "so , the number of pairs @xmath299 is at least @xmath300 .",
    "fix any such pair of them . by the definition of @xmath301 and @xmath9",
    ", we obtain that @xmath302 . from lemma 5 ( ii ) , ( iii ) and ( [ 6 ] ) we know that each of the at least @xmath303 edges in @xmath304 forms a close crossing with every edge from some two disjoint sets @xmath305 of size @xmath256 each .",
    "recall that @xmath306 . by ( [ 5 ] ) , the graph @xmath11 contains at least @xmath307 edges in each such set @xmath305 .",
    "consequently , we obtain @xmath308 it follows from lemma 5 ( i ) that each edge @xmath248 forms close crossings with at most @xmath284 edges from @xmath309 , and these edges are covered by some sets @xmath310 .",
    "therefore , by using ( [ 5 ] ) , every edge in a @xmath260-good direction @xmath35 forms at most @xmath311 close crossings with edges in a @xmath260-good direction @xmath312 .",
    "let @xmath313 be the number of crossings in @xmath11 that are counted by @xmath49 but not contained in @xmath4 .",
    "we have @xmath314 by our definitions , we have @xmath315 .",
    "hence , we derive @xmath316 by ( [ 7 ] ) and ( [ 8 ] ) . in other words , @xmath4 contains two edges from @xmath241 and @xmath280 that form a close crossing .",
