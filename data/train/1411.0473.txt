    "in the recent years , our society has experienced the rise of new ways to communicate and relate among each other through digital devices .",
    "the increasingly affordability of technology , together with the solutions brought , have turn mobile and internet devices as one of the fastest growing markets worldwide @xcite . specially in third world countries where the expanding projections of technological solutions double those found in the industrialized world @xcite .",
    "such technological revolution has given as a result , a massive amount of data provided by humans , as they interact with their digital devices on daily basis .",
    "the nowadays challenge is to turn these unstructured data into valuable information for policy makers to take better and more intelligent decisions @xcite .    at the moment",
    ", traditional surveys have given important insights to our societal understanding .",
    "however , their cost in time and human efforts , makes it impossible for them to scale up and bring information of the structure of the social system behind their observation .",
    "traditionally , the discovery of structural properties of social networks have been limited to the necessity of mapping a large amount of interactions between people . in this sense , online social networks , such as twitter or facebook ,",
    "have become an ideal source of information to collect human - to - human interactions and unveil the social structures that people constitute , which opens an opportunity for researchers to characterize and model human behavior @xcite .",
    "these web applications are used on daily basis by people to post opinions , propagate news and exchange information . as a result , several commercial , political and social organizations are increasingly exploiting this communication tool to advertise products , organize campaigns and disseminate updates on their respective fields .",
    "twitter , with over 200 million users , is the ideal tool to quickly propagate short text messages .",
    "it is an open debate that the data taken from twitter are not necessarily representative samples of the outside world , as they are constrained to the population that participates in the online conversations @xcite .",
    "however , a social contextualization of the data , combined with a suitable computational and mathematical treatment , may provide important insights into how people behave .",
    "in fact , the activity performed by users on twitter has brought information enough to understand a wide variety of phenomena , like the prediction of stock market variations @xcite , the management of natural disasters @xcite , the understanding of epidemical diseases @xcite and the characterization of electoral processes @xcite .",
    "the deeply understanding of these social processes is crucial to design better strategies and get optimal outcomes from the network potential .",
    "recent studies have revealed that most of the information posted on twitter is hardly propagated through the network , as 71% of the messages do not travel any farther than the authors time - line @xcite . among other factors ,",
    "this spreading inertia has been attributed to the fact that the novelty of the posted information decays quite rapidly , which stretches the effective time to attract the collective attention @xcite , in addition to the fact that most of the people on twitter behave passively @xcite . however , in this context , there are people who do influence the rest of users and are able to get their messages spread through the network , in a wide variety of proportions .",
    "the keys to success when propagating information on twitter have been reported to be a combination of several factors , such as the popularity of the source , the posting frequency , as well as the novelty and resonance of the message content @xcite .",
    "in fact , the largest retweets cascades on twitter , were found to be seeded by previously popular users , whose messages contained positive feelings @xcite . however , the efforts of each user to gain influence and get their information spread on the network is a subject that has not yet been explained . in the sense , that although users may gain enough influence to transfer information on the network , this influence is not necessarily archived with the same efficiency , in terms of the amount of efforts that had to be employed for this matter .    in this work",
    "we address the question of which factors , like the individual behavior or the underlying substratum , determine the users efficiency to have their messages spread through the network .",
    "more specifically , we propose a measure to characterize the user efficiency to influence the emergence and growth of retweets cascades , by means of the relationship between the activity employed by the users and the emergent collective response to such activity , measured in terms of the number of retransmissions gained . on this basis , we propose a model to understand the emergence of the user efficiency distribution , based on independent cascades taking place on networks @xcite , biasing the probability of retransmission among nodes , in order to decay as we move farther from the message source , as we see in the empirical data .",
    "the results indicate that some regular users may gain a similar amount of retransmissions as the popular ones , but far less efficiently , as they must employ a much larger amount of activity .",
    "furthermore , we have seen that the emergent distribution of users according to their efficiency , is strongly conditioned to the underlying network where information is being propagated . as a matter of fact",
    ", it actually represents a reflection of the dynamical rules behind the spreading process .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , we introduce the system of our study in section [ secsystem ] , as well as the datasets that we have built and analyzed .",
    "then in sections [ empiricalstudy ] , [ eff ] and [ universality ] we focus on the empirical measurements that lead us to state the dynamical rules of the propagation process . after this , in section [ model ] we propose a simple model to verify the dynamical processes reported .",
    "finally , we discuss the effects of the underlying topology and initial user activity behavior in the emergent dynamical patterns , which we found to be universal on twitter conversations .",
    "the system under study is based on human activity taking place around specific topics of conversation on twitter . in this section",
    "we give some background on the user interaction mechanisms provided by twitter , as well as describe the datasets that we have built and analyzed .",
    "twitter is a microblogging service where people are able to post and exchange text messages limited by @xmath0 characters either from personal computers or mobile devices .",
    "there are several mechanism for users to interact on twitter .",
    "the first of these is the ability to follow and be followed by other persons .",
    "this is a passive mechanism that allows users to receive all the messages posted by those who follow , as well as to deliver their own messages to their own followers . in this sense",
    ", it establishes the twitter followers network , where the users are connected among each other , through links that determine the explicit ways where messages are delivered .",
    "previous studies have reported complex properties in this network @xcite , like degree distribution with power law behavior , small mean distance between nodes and modular structure . however , it has been observed that individuals do not actively interact with all of the declared contacts , but only with a small fraction of them @xcite . among these active mechanisms to interact , the _ retweet _ ( or retransmission ) is the most popular one to propagate the received messages throughout the network . by retweeting a message ,",
    "users deliver specific information to their own followers , at the same time that endorse ideas and gain visibility in the network @xcite .",
    "the study of the retweets cascades has served to characterize user profiles @xcite , measure influence @xcite and propose spreading models @xcite . at last , all messages on twitter , may be identified using keywords called _",
    "this mechanism organize conversations and individuals use it to exchange ideas on specific subjects .",
    "recently , the statistical analysis of the hashtags usage has let prediction on social relations @xcite and collective attention @xcite .      using the twitter search api version 1.0 , we have built several datasets from public access messages .",
    "this api provides data from a temporal index of recent tweets , posted within a lapse of a week from the time the query is made .",
    "the limitations of this api are not specified as a relative volume of messages , nor a fixed number of queries , but instead a combination of the queries complexity and frequency .",
    "the datasets were built querying for messages with specific keywords related to topics of conversation that captured a significant part of the collective attention .",
    "their sizes vary from @xmath1 to more than @xmath2 messages or participants , as may be seen in table [ ht ] .",
    "first , we considered an online venezuelan political protest as a case study .",
    "this event took place exclusively on twitter on dec .",
    "16th , 2010 .",
    "two days before the protest , the convoker asked his followers to post messages identified with the hashtag # sosinternetve , who responded massively and the conversation propagated becoming trending topic .",
    "we collected up to 421,602 messages , identified with the protest hashtag , which were posted by 77,706 users , between dec .",
    "14 - 19 , 2010 ( two days before and after the protest ) . in our previous work @xcite",
    ", we found that some influential users acted as information producers , providing messages that are received by the passive large majority of information consumers .",
    "besides , we found that users are organized in a community structure around hubs of different nature , like politicians , humorists or mass media accounts .",
    "second , in order to generalize results , other datasets were also built around other conversation topics of different nature such as sports , news , protests and political campaigns .",
    "the first of these datasets is related to a political scandal that took place on the spanish parliament on 2012 due to some unappropriated comments from a congresswoman that echoed loudly on the social networks .",
    "this dataset was built by downloading the hashtag _ # andreafabra _ , which corresponds to this persons name , from july 12th , 2012 , to july 23th , 2012 .",
    "the second dataset concerns a conversation about a venezuelan baseball team .",
    "it was built by downloading the messages that contained the teams name _ leones _ during a 3 weeks period from dec .",
    "22th , 2010 , to jan .",
    "12th , 2011 .",
    "moreover , we have built another dataset concerning the 2011 arab spring , by downloading the messages that contained the keyword ( and hashtag ) _ egypt _ during a 5 week period , from jan .",
    "12th , 2011 , to feb .",
    "17th , 2011 . during this period",
    "the former egyptian president was overthrown by the social revolts .",
    "besides , two datasets concerning the american 2012 elections were built by respectively gathering all the messages that contained the word _ gingrich _ during a week period from feb .",
    "29th , 2012 , to mar .",
    "3rd , 2012 , as well as the word _ obama _ during the first televised debate from oct .",
    "3th , 2012 , to oct .",
    "5th , 2012 . finally , the last of these datasets is related to the 2011 spanish electoral process .",
    "it has been built with all the messages that contained the keyword ( and hashtag ) _",
    "20n _ , which was used by all parties in reference to the election day on nov .",

    ".properties of the studied datasets and their resulting user efficiency distribution properties . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      +",
    "at this point it has been shown a significant heterogeneity in the users behavioral patterns , in terms of the activity distribution ( number of messages posted ) and the attention received ( number of followers and retweets gained ) . however , the way these measures are correlated , and their relation to the user efficiency to spread information remains unanswered .    in table",
    "[ netcorr ] , the pearson coefficient between the users number of followers @xmath3 ( measured as the @xmath4 in the followers network ) , retweets gained by user @xmath5 and activity @xmath6 , are presented .",
    "it can be noticed that there is no correlation between the number of followers and activity employed ( @xmath7 ) , which means that the amount of messages posted is independent of the user position in the followers network .",
    "however , there is a strong correlation between the number of followers and the retransmissions gained ( @xmath8 ) , which means that the most retransmitted users tend to be the most followed ones as well . besides , there is a positive correlation between the number of retransmissions and activity employed ( @xmath9 ) , which indicates that the chances of being retransmitted increase with every message posted for all users .    in fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] , we present a scatter plot of the retweets gained by user as a function of its activity and colored by the user @xmath4 in the followers network . it can be clearly noticed that the most retransmitted users are also the most followed ones ( red dots ) , independently of their activity . however , some less followed users ( green or yellow dots ) may also gain a significant amount of retransmissions , but by means of a considerable increase in their own activity .",
    "these users are located around the straight line of slope 1 , and their retransmissions gained are proportional to their activity . finally , some not so followed users ( blue dots in fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] below the dashed line ) , who are vast majority of the population , needed to post an enormous amount of messages to gain , if any , a few retransmission at most .    the fact that not all the participants must employ the same amount of effort , to accomplish the same level of retransmissions , implies that users have an individual efficiency to get their messages spread by others .",
    "this _ user efficiency _ , @xmath10 , may be understood as the ratio between the collective response to the individual efforts .",
    "it is a metric of influence in the network , quantified as the amount of retransmissions gained by user with each message posted , defined according to the following expression :    @xmath11    where @xmath12 is the number of retweets gained by user @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is the amount of messages posted or retweeted by the user @xmath13 .",
    "those users whose @xmath15 get more retweets than the number of messages posted and therefore are more efficient to spread their information in the network and consequently gain more influence , in comparison to those users whose @xmath16 , that employed larger efforts to obtain similar outcomes .    .",
    "the distributions correspond to the # sosinternetve dataset.,title=\"fig:\",width=384 ] +    in fig .",
    "[ figure3b ] , we present a scatter plot of the users degree in the followers network , @xmath4 and @xmath17 , colored by their efficiency @xmath10 . it may be noticed , that the users who present an efficiency @xmath15 ( green , yellow , orange and red dots ) are mostly located below the dashed line of slope one , which means that their audiences ( @xmath4 ) are larger than their sources of information ( @xmath17 ) , which implies a certain level of popularity in the network . specially , those whose @xmath18 ( orange and red dots ) , who may be followed by more than @xmath1 users , but they only follow less than @xmath19 users .",
    "meanwhile , the users who present a low efficiency ( blue dots ) , tend to receive messages from much more sources than the size of their audiences ( @xmath20 ) , and also have a smaller amount of followers .",
    "this means that these users hear more information from the network , than what they are actually listened",
    ".    however , the mean efficiency value seems to be close to 1 ( @xmath21 ) , as shown in the user efficiency @xmath10 distribution presented in fig .",
    "[ campanalog]a , which means that in average most of the users who got retweeted , gained as many retransmissions as the amount of messages posted . besides",
    ", the users whose @xmath18 , represent a minority part of the population , as clearly shown in the @xmath10 complementary cumulative distribution in fig .",
    "[ campanalog]b .",
    "it can be noticed that less than 2% of the retweeted population gained more than 10 retransmissions by message sent ( dashed line in fig .",
    "[ campanalog]b ) , 0.2% gained over 100 retransmissions by message sent ( dotted line in fig . [ campanalog]b ) and just one user gained over 1000 retransmissions with a single post .    in order to further understand the @xmath10 distribution , we have superimposed in fig .",
    "[ campanalog]a - b the correspondent lognormal curve , with the mean and variance taken from the empirical observations ( see table [ ht ] ) .",
    "it is known that lognormal distributions arise from multiplicative growing processes , like branching processes , as they may be explained by the central limit theorem , in the logarithmic scale @xcite .",
    "an example of these processes are found in viral marketing campaigns @xcite , where the number of leaves grow multiplicative as the branches split like the cascades shown in section [ activityr ] .",
    "it can be noticed that the initial part of the distribution fits quite well the lognormal curve , but right after its maximum the distribution changes the scaling behavior , apparently to a power law , which we have also superimposed in fig .",
    "[ campanalog]a with a dashed line .",
    "this means that there is a higher concentration of users who gain a larger amount of retransmissions by message posted , than what is expected for a lognormal distribution .",
    "these highly efficient users correspond to the hubs of the followers network as can be appreciated in fig .",
    "[ campanalog]c , where we have plotted the quantile - quantile plot of the @xmath10 distribution in comparison to the lognormal distribution , filtered by the number of followers .",
    "if @xmath10 would follow a lognormal distribution , all the points would appear in a straight line , which actually happens for the users who present less than 1000 followers .",
    "but , as we consider the most followed users , the curve begins to change its behavior , suggesting that the underlying network topology is responsible for such deviation .",
    "this point would be further analyzed in section [ results ] .    in summary , we have seen two kind of users who may gain a significant amount of retransmissions .",
    "one of them , are the highly connected users in the followers network , which have no need to follow other people , and with a high efficiency , gain a much larger amount of retweets than their own messages .",
    "while , there are other not so well connected users , who may also gain a lot of retweets , but in a less efficient way , since they need to post much more messages than the highly efficient ones .",
    "the black solid line represents the lognormal fit , the black dashed line represents a power law fit and the red dots correspond to the measured distributions.,title=\"fig:\",width=384 ] +    in order to identify whether this distribution is constrained to the present case study or rather represents a consequence of an universal feature of the interaction mechanism , we have calculated the user efficiency ( @xmath10 ) for other conversations on twitter .",
    "specifically , we performed the analysis over six different datasets described in section [ secsystem ] and whose features may be found in table [ ht ] . all of them belong to different contexts and their sizes include several order of magnitude in terms of the number of posted messages and participant users .",
    "the results of the emergent @xmath10 distributions from these datasets are presented in fig .",
    "[ riaall ] , plotted in ascendant order according to their size ( from a to f ) .",
    "it can be noticed that the lognormal distribution emerges , even when the smallest datasets are considered ( fig .",
    "[ riaall]a - b ) .",
    "however , as the size of the dataset increases , the effects of the presence of highly efficient users is more evident in the distributions , which present a very similar shape as the one found for the # sosinternetve conversation ( fig .",
    "[ campanalog]a ) .",
    "given the fact that the size of the datasets cover from four to six orders of magnitude and correspond to topics of different nature , it is remarkable that the resulting distributions present a very similar shape .",
    "this ubiquity of the resulting patterns , strongly suggests the existence of an universal behavior in the relation between the individual efforts , managed by the user , and the collective reaction to such efforts , which is an emergent property of the underlying network .",
    "so we open the following question : what factors cause the emergence of such distribution ? in the next section we will propose a model to explain the emergence of the observed distribution .",
    "in order to model the propagation of retweets that took place on the # sosinternetve conversation , we propose a spreading mechanism based on independent cascades @xcite taking place on the followers network . in this model , nodes are activated in analogy to having posted a message , allowing their neighbors to also activate , like having retransmitted the received message , following the cascade schema shown in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] .",
    "each message may trigger an independent cascade regardlessly of the authors previous activations . besides",
    ", nodes may belong and participate in several cascades at the same time .    in the context of a given cascade ,",
    "when a node @xmath13 has been activated , it has a single chance to activate each of its neighbors ( followers ) , @xmath22 , located at @xmath23 layers away from the message source .",
    "thus the spreading probability depends on such distance @xmath23 . in the sense that , the probability of a node @xmath22 to retransmit a message at @xmath23 layers away from the source , is given according to the probability of the cascade to grow vertically and have a depth of at least @xmath23 layers , @xmath24 , and the probability to grow inside the layer @xmath23 , given by @xmath25 .",
    "the user activity @xmath14 is given as the result of all the messages posted by @xmath13 : as a source in layer @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) plus all the retweets made by @xmath13 at @xmath23 steps farther from the message source ( @xmath28 ) , in the following way :    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is the maximum cascade depth allowed .",
    "on one hand , @xmath27 is an independent random variable with density distribution @xmath31 , and represents the initial conditions for the spreading process . on the other hand , @xmath28 is not independent and it rather represents a consequence of the propagation of other nodes activity . among other factors ,",
    "this quantity depends on the amount of messages received by @xmath13 , which is proportional to the amount of people who @xmath13 follows on the underlying followers network ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "from this perspective , we define the retransmissions gained by user @xmath13 in the following way :    @xmath33    where @xmath34 represents the retweets gained by the node @xmath13 due to its given activations at the layer @xmath23 in all the cascades .",
    "this means that a node @xmath13 may gain retransmissions either from the messages originally posted by it ( @xmath35 ) , as well as from messages retweeted by @xmath13 at @xmath23 layers away from the source ( @xmath34 ) . on this basis , the value of @xmath34 depends on the number @xmath13s followers , as well as the followers of followers , and so on , until reaching the maximum depth considered for a possible node activation , given by @xmath30 .",
    "hence the sum upper limit in eq .",
    "[ eqri ] is one layer before this value . in order to simulate the model",
    ", we must define the underlying network where the propagation process would take place , as well as the initial user activity distribution @xmath36 .",
    "then the messages are spread taking into account the probability of a cascade to reach @xmath23 layers @xmath24 and the retransmission rate in a given layer @xmath25 .",
    "finally after all the initial activations are performed and the triggered cascades extinct , we calculate the efficiency @xmath10 for each user according to eq .",
    "[ nu ] , as well as the correspondent density distribution .",
    "+     has been considered.,title=\"fig:\",width=384 ] +     where @xmath37 $ ] has been considered.,title=\"fig:\",width=384 ] +    we applied the model to two followers networks from the considered datasets .",
    "one of these networks corresponds to the present case study _",
    "# sosinternetve _ and the other one is constructed from the _ # 20n _ dataset ( see fig . [",
    "riaall]d ) .",
    "the results of the user efficiency and retweets distribution are shown at the top and bottom panel in fig .",
    "[ figure8a ] respectively .",
    "these results correspond to the average value of 50 model realizations . in both cases ,",
    "the system has been initially excited using an heterogeneous user activity distribution in the form : @xmath38 , and the spreading probabilities were taken from the cascade s characterization , given in fig . [ caracterizacioncadena ] .",
    "it can be noticed that the resulting efficiency distributions in fig .",
    "[ figure8a]a and c ( blue crosses ) present a very good agreement with the empirical data ( open circles ) in both cases .",
    "in fact , the distributions also presents the different scaling behavior at the right side of the curve . besides , the resulting retweets distributions in fig .",
    "[ figure8a]b and d ( blue crosses ) , are also in very good agreement with the empirical data ( open circles ) .",
    "these results show that the distributions analyzed are a reflection of the dynamical process behind the message spreading , which happens on twitter by means of the retweets mechanism in independent cascades , where the probability of a cascade to grow decays as the message travels through the network , independently of the social context .",
    "after having validated the spreading mechanism , we are able to use the model to control the effect of the different factors that determine the user efficiency patterns , such as the heterogeneity of the underlying network topology and the characteristics of the individual user behavior ( activity distribution ) .    first , we analyze the effects of the heterogeneity of underlying network topology on the spreading process . for this matter we applied the model to two different kind of substrata : the followers networks , from the datasets _ # sosinternetve _ and _ # 20n _ , and their randomized versions .",
    "these randomized networks were built to avoid the presence of hubs and create homogeneous users profiles , by rewiring the edges so the degree distribution would follow a normal curve instead of a power law , but maintaining the average number of edges per node .",
    "the resulting @xmath10 distributions after having excited the system with the same heterogeneous @xmath36 are plotted by red x symbols in fig .",
    "[ figure8b]a andc respectively .",
    "it can be noticed that the distributions from these homogeneous networks present a different behavior than the ones obtained from the empirical observations and the modelled ones on the followers networks .",
    "there is a slightly lower density of the low efficient users , but more importantly , the highest values of the distribution are almost two orders below the empirical values , apparently following a lognormal behavior .",
    "however , the retweets distributions in fig .",
    "[ figure8b]b and d ( red x symbols ) still present power law behavior , due to the heterogeneity of @xmath36 , although the probabilities of retweet are lower . in both cases , this means that an homogeneous society would allow users to gain an extremely high amount of retweets , only by means of employing an enormous amount of initial activity as well , since the user efficiency is strongly limited to the available connections on the underlying network .",
    "second , to study the effects of the individual user behavior , given by the initial activity distribution , we also applied the model to both followers networks ( the case study _",
    "# sosinternetve _ and the _ # 20n _ dataset ) and their randomized versions , but in this case considering an homogeneous @xmath36 , in the form : @xmath39 where @xmath37 $ ] , instead of the heterogeneous one previously considered .",
    "the results of applying this homogeneous user behavior to the heterogeneous followers networks are presented by blue crosses in fig .",
    "[ figure8c ] .",
    "it can be noticed that the resulting user efficiency distributions in fig .",
    "[ figure8c]a and c , present the same behavior on the right side of the curve as the empirical observations ( open circles ) , even though the considered user behavior is radically different than the empirical one . besides , the retweets distribution ( fig .",
    "[ figure8c]b and d ) also coincide quite well with the empirical observations and hardly changes in comparison to the distributions obtained when users posted messages in a heterogeneous way . however , if we change the substrata to their randomized versions , the model results no longer reproduce the empirical behavior and all the distributions loose their heterogeneity ( red x symbols in fig .",
    "[ figure8c ] ) .",
    "this confirms that the emerging patterns are not dependent on the way users post original messages , but instead a consequence of their heterogeneous connections on the underlying network .    in the case of twitter",
    ", the followers network also represents the way that the collective attention is organized . on this basis",
    ", this model has shown that if this collective attention is distributed heterogeneously among the population , the way users post messages has no further effects in the efficiency distribution , nor the retweets distribution , since the high aggregation of users around the influential ones is what produces such large collective reactions . in turn , if users would pay attention to each other homogeneously , as the randomized version of the followers network , then the retweets gained by user would be a reflection of the frequency and amount of posted messages , and the efficiency to gain such retweets would be strongly limited by the properties of the underlying substratum . however , despite the fact that in an homogeneous society it would be more difficult to find extreme cases of high efficient users , the density of extremely low efficient users also decreases when the attention is shared homogeneously among the collective .",
    "therefore , this evidences that in order for some users to gain attention from the collective , others must loose it at the same time . +   + in summary , we have been able to model the efficiency of users to spread their opinions during twitter conversations , and found that the emergent patterns are remarkable influenced by the underlying network topology .",
    "we have shown an evidence of the _ robust but vulnerable _ property of complex networks . in the sense that complex networks appear to be robust for most of the external excitations , as most of people post messages that do not travel at all , but vulnerable for selected excitations , as the activity performed by the highly efficient users have a remarkable impact in the resulting patterns @xcite .",
    "this effect is also measured through the macroscopical property of the percentage of retweets on the overall posted messages . in the protest 47% of the messages were retweets , while our simulations gave @xmath40 for the followers network and @xmath41 for the randomized version .",
    "this additional 5% of retransmissions were only possible due to the complex organization of the network .",
    "while spreading processes have been largely studied across several disciplines , accurate models to explain empirical dynamical processes are still an open field . in this paper we have performed a quantitative analysis of the structural and dynamical patterns of the activity on twitter during an online political protest and generalized our results to other online conversations .",
    "we found that the activity is fed by a small group of very active users , while the large majority hardly participated .",
    "as part of this activity there are interactions that determine the collective attention , which we found to be dominated by a very small group of highly influential users . however ,",
    "if any , the rest of users gain influence in proportion to the activity they employ .",
    "although , for the large majority of users the efforts are usually higher than the results .",
    "we propose a way to measure this bonding between actions and reactions , as the ratio between the retransmissions gained and user activity , that we understand as the individual efficiency to have messages spread in the network and hence it can be considered as a measure to be influential in the information spreading process .",
    "we found this measure to be universal across several twitter conversations , as it is distributed following a lognormal distribution with a larger density of users at the higher orders , in all the studied cases .",
    "we propose a model to explain the nature of the efficiency distribution , based on biased independent cascades on the followers networks .",

    "more particularly , it revealed that the emergence of a small fraction of highly efficient users results from the heterogeneity of the underlying network , rather than the differences in the individual user behavior .",
    "in fact , we found that in an homogeneously organized society we would need a much larger population to find the same level of influence to diffuse information that we get by complex and heterogeneous organizing .",
    "we conclude that although individuals may have remarkable psychological and contextual differences , the dynamical patterns are due to simple and universal interaction mechanisms .",
