    "the consensus has been reached that the afterglow emission originates from a relativistic thin shell of baryonic matter propagating in the circumburst medium ( cbm ) and that its description can be obtained from the relativistic conservation laws of energy and momentum . in both our approach and in the other ones in the current literature ( see e.g. refs .  )",
    "such conservations laws are used .",
    "the main difference is that in the current literature an ultra - relativistic approximation , following the blandford & mckee self - similar solution,@xcite is widely adopted , leading to a simple constant - index power - law relations between the lorentz @xmath0 factor of the optically thin `` fireshell '' and its radius : @xmath1 with @xmath2 in the fully radiative case and @xmath3 in the adiabatic case.@xcite on the contrary , we use the exact solutions of the equations of motion of the fireshell.@xcite",
    "a detailed comparison between the equations used in the two approaches has been presented in refs .  .",
    "in particular , in ref .   it is shown that the regime represented in eq.([gr0 ] ) is reached only asymptotically when @xmath4 in the fully radiative regime and @xmath5 in the adiabatic regime , where @xmath6 the initial lorentz gamma factor of the optically thin fireshell .",
    "factor during the afterglow era is plotted versus the radial coordinate of the expanding optically thin fireshell in the fully radiative case ( solid line ) and in the adiabatic case ( dotted line ) starting from @xmath7 and the same initial conditions as grb 991216@xcite . in the lower panel",
    "are plotted the corresponding values of the `` effective '' power - law index @xmath8 ( see eq.([eff_a ] ) ) , which is clearly not constant , is highly varying and systematically lower than the constant values @xmath9 and @xmath10 purported in the current literature ( horizontal thin dotted lines ) . ]    in fig .",

    "there are plotted the exact solutions for the fireshell dynamics in the fully radiative and adiabatic cases . in the lower panel",
    "we plot the corresponding `` effective '' power - law index @xmath8 , defined as the index of the power - law tangent to the exact solution:@xcite @xmath11 such an `` effective '' power - law index of the exact solution smoothly varies from @xmath12 to a maximum value which is always smaller than @xmath9 or @xmath10 , in the fully radiative and adiabatic cases respectively , and finally decreases back to @xmath12 ( see fig .",

    "satellite@xcite , we have now for many grbs almost gapless multi - wavelength light curves from the beginning of the prompt emission ( which in our model coincides with the peak of the afterglow , see refs .  ) all the way to the latest afterglow phases . in the interpretation of such gapless data",
    "it is therefore crucial to use the exact solution for the fireshell dynamics ."
