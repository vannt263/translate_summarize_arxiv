    "high - energy cosmic - ray electrons can not propagate far from the sources , because the electrons lose rapidly energy with an energy loss rate of the square of energy through the synchrotron and inverse compton process .",
    "kobayashi et al . ( 2004 ) @xcite suggests that the energy spectrum of cosmic - ray electrons might have a structure in the energy region over several 100gev due to the discrete effect of local sources .",
    "this means that we can identify cosmic - ray electron sources from the electron spectrum over several 100gev together with anisotropies in arrival direction .",
    "in addition , there is a possibility that weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) annihilate directly into electron - positron pairs and produce mono - energetic electrons and positrons @xcite .",
    "although the propagation through the galaxy would broaden the line spectrum , the observed electron and positron spectrum could still have a distinctive feature .",
    "since there are no other known production mechanisms that would produce an electron and positron peak at energies of 100  gev - 10  tev , such a distinctive feature clearly indicates the existence of wimp dark matter in the galactic halo .",
    "thus , the observations of high - energy electrons bring us unique information about sources and propagation of cosmic rays , and enable us to search for wimp dark matter .",
    "although the cosmic - ray electrons have been observed with many kinds of detectors borne on balloons , most observations are limited below @xmath0100 gev . as an exceptional instance",
    ", the observation with the emulsion chambers ( ecc ) has achieved to detect electrons beyond 1tev by the large amount of exposures of @xmath1 days in total for 30 years @xcite .",
    "the difficulty of observation originates from that the electron flux itself is very small and decreases with energy much more rapidly than that of protons because of the electro - magnetic energy loss by radiation .",
    "the electron flux is estimated to be @xmath01% of protons around 10gev and less than @xmath00.2% of protons above 100  gev from the observed energy spectra with a power - law index of @xmath2 @xmath0 @xmath3 for electrons @xcite and @xmath4 for protons @xcite .",
    "therefore , for the electron observations above 100  gev , we need a long duration observation by a detector with an excellent capability of large geometrical factor and powerful background rejection .    in order to meet the requirements for the electron observation ,",
    "we have developed a highly granulated imaging calorimeter , the balloon - borne electron telescope with scintillating fibers ( bets ) , that preserves the superior qualities of both electronic detectors and emulsion chambers .",
    "we have successfully observed cosmic - ray electrons in the energy range from 10 to 100  gev at sanriku in japan @xcite .",
    "the bets was improved to observe atmospheric gamma rays at mountain and balloon altitudes for calibrating the atmospheric neutrino flux calculations @xcite .",
    "furthermore , for observing the electrons over 100gev by a long duration balloon experiment , we have achieved the development of an advanced detector , ppb - bets , flown by ppb in antarctica .",
    "the ppb has a capability to realize a flight for @xmath5 weeks in one round of the antarctica at an altitude of @xmath035  km .",
    "the ppb project is carried out by the inter - university collaboration with institute of space and astronautical science ( isas ) , jaxa and national institute of polar research ( nipr ) @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we describe the instrumentation of ppb - bets , the calibration of the detector with accelerator beams , the observations in antarctica , and the results of our experiments .",
    "the ppb - bets detector consists of 36 scintillating fiber belts , 9 plastic scintillators , and 14 lead plates with 9 radiation lengths ( r.l . ) in total .",
    "each fiber belt is composed of 280 fibers with a 1 mm square cross section for each .",
    "a schematic cross section of the detector is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : design ] .",
    "the area of the detector is 28  @xmath628  cm and the total thickness is 23 cm , including spacers inserted between sensitive layers .",
    "the scintillating fibers perform the function to detect the shower particles developing in lead plates and to fulfill a detailed imaging of the shower .",
    "scintillating fiber belts are set in right angle alternately to observe the projected shower profile in x and y directions .",
    "for the read - out of scintillation light in the fibers , we used an image - intensified ccd camera in each direction of x and y. the plastic scintillators were adopted for the instrument trigger and the energy measurement .",
    "thus ppb - bets is an instrument to observe the details of three dimensional shower development with a timing capability .",
    "the basic structure of ppb - bets is similar to the bets @xcite . in order to achieve the observation of electrons up to 1tev by using a long duration flight , however",
    ", the ppb - bets has been improved in comparison with the bets at several points presented in the following .",
    "the thickness of lead is increased from 7 to 9 r.l . to observe higher energy electrons , and the number of plastic scintillators",
    "is increased from 3 to 9 to detect accurately the shower development .",
    "the image - intensified ccd camera ( i.i .- ccd ) system for the read - out of scintillating fibers has newly been developed by using a better quality of ccd to detect 1tev electron showers without saturation of ccd signals at higher intensities of photon numbers .",
    "the total performance of detector was approved by the beam test using accelerators and by the monte - carlo simulations .",
    "monte - carlo simulations were carried out with several codes such as fluka2002 @xcite , geant3 @xcite , and epics @xcite , in which we could not find serious differences .",
    "the trigger rate in actual observation is critically important to know the data amount transmitted by telemetry , since we have no guarantee of the recovery of instrument .",
    "therefore , we carried out a test flight of the trigger system at sanriku in advance of the flight in antarctica",
    ". the trigger system is composed of the plastic scintillators and lead plates in same configuration of the ppb - bets .",
    "the flight has confirmed that the trigger system worked well and the rate observed was consistent with the expectation by the simulation .",
    "we made also a study on the detailed performance of detector at cern - sps by using the electron beams from 10gev to 200gev and proton beams from 150 to 350gev .",
    "the electron events developed purely in electro - magnetic process have similar and smooth shower developments .",
    "on the other hand , the proton events caused by nuclear interactions have the developments with much wider fluctuations and relatively smaller energy depositions .",
    "the detection efficiency of the shower trigger system was examined by adjusting the discrimination levels at each scintillator .      for the image - intensified ccd camera",
    ", it is required to observe shower images from a single track to a shower maximum without saturation .",
    "the ccd ( thx 7887a ) has @xmath7 pixels , and the signal - to - noise ratio is 70db that means 6.3 times larger dynamic range of ccd than the bets of 54db .",
    "since the pixel number increases by 16 times comparing to that used in bets , the dynamic range of ccd for the photon intensity in one fiber extends by two order of magnitude . extrapolating the data of the cern beam test to higher energies , we confirmed that the i.i .- ccd system has an enough dynamic range for the observation of one single track to 1tev electrons with linearity .",
    "the one ccd image is read out with a speed of @xmath8sec by using 12 bit adc of 40mhz .",
    "pile - up of events in ccd are taken place only by successive events within the timing of 10@xmath9sec , and the effect can be negligible small .",
    "the total data processing on - board take @xmath10sec for one event .",
    "since the instrument is not scheduled to be recovered , all of the observed data should be transfered by the iridium satellite phone line and the down link to the syowa station . to meet the telemetry rate of 2.4kbps by iridium",
    ", the image data can be compressed on - board with a run - length method and a huffman method . from the beam test",
    ", we obtained that the compressed image data size of one event is @xmath018kbyte for electrons at 100  gev and @xmath013kbyte for protons at 100  gev with the data compression rate of @xmath040% .",
    "as a ballooning technology of the long duration flight , we have developed the telemetry system with the iridium satellite phone system , power supply system by solar batteries , automatic level control system using cpu , and so on . since the detector weight should be saved for loading the heavy ballast , we used an un - pressurized vessel with a light shield , designing the instrument to meet the vacuum and heat conditions during the long duration flight .",
    "we examined the validity of the instrument by environmental tests as long as more than one week .",
    "we summarize the basic parameters of the ppb - bets instrument in table [ tab : parameters ] .",
    "the balloon was launched at the syowa station ( 69@xmath1100 latitude south , 35@xmath1135 longitude east ) in antarctica at 15:57 on january 4 , 2004 ( utc ) .",
    "the level flight was started at 18:00 on january 4 , and continued till 1:46 on january 17 , 2004 ( utc ) at altitudes of 33 - 37 km ( 35 km on average ) .",
    "the total duration of the exposure time is @xmath12  hr . the trajectory of the ppb - bets is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : trajectory ] .",
    "the balloon went round the antarctica at @xmath13 latitude south from east to west with a speed of @xmath14  km  h@xmath15 .",
    "power consumption of 70w in the instrument was normally supplied by the solar batteries .",
    "automatic level control system successfully operated as presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : altitude ] .",
    "the event trigger was executed by two modes , the high - energy ( he ) mode and low - energy ( le ) mode .",
    "the le mode corresponds to electron observation over 10gev , and was assigned for the observation during 10 hours just after launching .",
    "the data acquired by the le mode were directly transfered to the syowa station with a telemetry of 64kbps .",
    "the he mode , which corresponds to the electron observation over 100gev , was used through all the flight .",
    "the acquired data were further selected by the software trigger ( 2nd trigger ) on - board , and transmitted to our operation room at nipr in japan , via a receiving station in us , with an iridium satellite phone line at a rate of 2.4kbps .",
    "the commands from the operation room to the ppb - bets were also sent by the iridium line .",
    "the monitoring data were delivered to each institute via internet .",
    "the data transfer rates were @xmath16 events per hour ( 3hz ) for the le mode and @xmath17 events per hour ( 0.02hz ) for the he mode , respectively .",
    "the amount of data used for the current analysis is @xmath18 of the acquired data on - board because of the problem of data transfer system and ccd noise .",
    "for the event triggering the he mode , we adopted two main sets of discrimination levels of pulse heights in all these plastic scintillators .",
    "one set corresponds to the threshold energy of 100  gev and the other to 150  gev .",
    "the number of acquired events is @xmath19 for the 100  gev threshold and @xmath20 for the 150  gev threshold .",
    "there are also @xmath21 events for the other thresholds on the he mode . in this analysis",
    ", we used the two data sets of the 100  gev and 150  gev threshold without use of the other data including the le mode .",
    "figure  [ fig : ph_dist ] shows the pulse height ( converted to the number of minimum ionizing particle , mip ) distribution of the plastic scintillator at the depth of 7 r.l . for the two thresholds . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ph_dist ] , the observable minimum energy is shifted properly depending on each threshold , and the trigger system worked normally .",
    "the spectra in high - energy region are compared to a power - law spectrum with an index of @xmath4 .",
    "they are consistent with the spectral shape of the cosmic - ray protons , since the events triggered on - board are still dominated by the protons that are much more abundant than the electrons .      the plastic scintillators are used for the energy measurements of electrons . since the number of shower particles at the shower maximum is nearly proportional to the energy of incident electrons , we determined the electron energies by using the number of particles at the shower maximum in the transition curve with plastic scintillators .",
    "the transition curves of electro - magnetic shower are well represented by the following formula : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the pulse heights ( converted to mip ) of plastic scintillators at the depth of @xmath24  r.l .",
    ", @xmath25 is the normalization factor , @xmath26 is the zenith angle of the shower axis , and @xmath27 and @xmath28 are adjustable coefficients . in order to derive the number of particles at the shower maximum",
    ", we fitted this formula to the pulse heights of the six scintillators at depths of 3  r.l . to 9  r.l .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ene2mip ] , the relation of the number of particles at the shower maximum and the energies of electron beams at cern - sps is almost linear in the energy range of @xmath29  gev .",
    "the energy resolution is 12  % at 100  gev as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : eneres ] , and consistent with the simulations .",
    "it is important to determine accurately a shower axis , since it is crucial to determine the electron energy and the separation of electrons from background protons and gamma rays as mentioned later .    for the acquired events in the flight , we reconstructed the raw ccd images of showers to the fiber positions in detector space by using the positions of each fiber on the ccd image .",
    "the positions of each fiber were obtained in advance of the flight by observing cosmic - ray muon tracks at ground level .",
    "the relative displacement of the fiber positions during the flight was calibrated by using the led - illuminated fibers .",
    "examples of the reconstructed shower image observed in the flight are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : candidates ] .    from the reconstructed shower image , we determine the shower axis in the following . at first , below 3  r.l . in the detector",
    ", we derive centric positions of shower lateral spreads in each fiber layer . by fitting these centric positions with a linear least - squares method",
    "we determine a tentative shower axis , and trace back to the next upper layer . adding a new centric position in the upper layer by using only fiber signals near the tentative shower axis ( @xmath30 fibers ) , we fit the shower axis once again .",
    "this process is repeated up to the top layer of 0  r.l . , and",
    "the shower axis is determined .",
    "figure [ fig : beam_ang_res ] shows the angular resolution by the beam test , which ranges from 0.40 to 0.57 degree with electron energies of 10 to 200  gev . although they are considerably better than those of the bets of @xmath31 , they are worse than the simulated angular resolution of @xmath32 above 100  gev .",
    "it is caused by errors of the fiber positions in detector space .",
    "the electron selection from backgrounds has been carried out by the method used in bets as explained below . at first , proton backgrounds are reduced with the on - board trigger system .",
    "the discrimination levels are set with each scintillator .",
    "second , we selected the events whose shower axes pass through the top and bottom of the detector within a zenith angle of 30 degrees .",
    "this selection reduces the proton background events triggered on - board , which are incident from the side of the detector .",
    "third , we introduced the ratio of energy deposition within 5 mm from the shower axis to the total ( @xmath33 parameter ) as described in torii et al .",
    "( 2001 ) @xcite .",
    "a typical event of electron - induced shower presents a narrower lateral spread concentrated along the shower axis , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : candidates ] . on the contrary , that of proton - induced shower shows a wider lateral spread .",
    "we characterize this physical property by the @xmath33 parameter .",
    "the electron candidates were selected by the @xmath33 distribution under the condition that the @xmath33 values are greater than 0.75 @xcite .    as for the separation between electrons and gamma rays ,",
    "electrons could be identified by the presence of hits in the scintillating fibers at 0 r.l . along the shower axis .",
    "incident electrons leave signals on the fibers along the shower axis . on the other hand",
    ", incident gamma rays leave no signals except for the back - scattered particles .",
    "we judged electrons as the events whose distances are less than or equal to 5  mm .",
    "gamma - ray events are rejected by 90  % @xcite .    as a result ,",
    "the number of the electron candidates above 100  gev is 84 events among the @xmath34 analyzed events in the he mode .",
    "from the electron events , with the above selection and energy determination , we derived the cosmic - ray electron spectrum by using the following formula : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the number of electron candidates , @xmath37 the effective geometrical factor , @xmath38 the observed live time , @xmath39 the energy interval , @xmath40 the correction factor of the proton contamination in the @xmath33-cut with energy dependence , @xmath41 the correction factor of the gamma - ray contamination in the gamma - ray rejection with energy dependence , @xmath42 the correction of enhancement of flux due to the energy resolution , @xmath43 the flux of secondary ( atmospheric ) electrons at the observation level , and @xmath44 the correction factor of energy loss of primary electrons in the overlying atmosphere .    the effective geometrical factor , @xmath37 , is derived by monte - carlo simulations under the same condition of the experiment .",
    "figure  [ fig : somega ] shows the effective geometrical factor with electron energies for the 100  gev threshold and 150  gev threshold in the he mode .",
    "the uncertainty of the energy determination has the effect of enhancing the absolute flux of electrons , in particular , for a steep power - law spectrum .",

    ", we evaluated the electron numbers by correcting the proton contamination in the @xmath33 cut and the gamma - ray contamination in the gamma - ray rejection . since the power - law index of the primary proton spectrum is @xmath4 , which is much harder than that of the electrons , the contamination of protons increases with energy .",
    "atmospheric gamma rays are also produced by the interaction of primary protons with atmospheric nuclei .",
    "therefore , the index of gamma rays is the same with that of protons .",
    "this brings the same energy dependence for the contamination of gamma rays with the protons .",
    "hence , the correction factors are estimated to be @xmath55 for the proton contamination and @xmath56 for the gamma - ray contamination from the monte - carlo simulations .      in order to check on the event identification",

    "the combined spectrum of ppb - bets and bets can be represented by a single power - law function of @xmath61 in the energy range of 10  gev to 800  gev .",
    "the reduced chi - square value is 1.605 for 11 degrees of freedom .",
