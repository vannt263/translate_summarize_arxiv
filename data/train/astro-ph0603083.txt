    "supernovae of type ia ( sne  ia ) represent the thermonuclear explosion of carbon - oxygen white dwarfs , probably as they approach the chandrasekhar mass in a binary system . despite the importance of sne  ia as sites of iron - peak nucleosynthesis and their utility as cosmological standard candles , the actual progenitor systems and details of the explosion mechanism are still unknown ; see @xcite for a recent review of theoretical models and problems associated with them .",
    "what is clear from an observational point of view is that most sne  ia fall on a sequence between the peculiar sn 1991bg - like objects at one end and the peculiar sn 1991t - like objects at the other @xcite .",
    "the photometric sequence between these two endpoints @xcite is paralleled by a spectroscopic sequence @xcite .",
    "sn 1991bg @xcite was faint , red , had a rapidly declining light curve , and showed prominent lines of in its spectrum at maximum light while sn 1991 t @xcite was bright , blue , had a slowly declining light curve , and showed prominent lines in its spectrum .",
    "@xcite explained the variation in normal sne  ia between these two extrema as primarily a temperature effect , driven by the amount of radioactive @xmath2ni formed in the explosion .",
    "most objects are normal , but estimates of the peculiarity rate vary from 11% to 36% @xcite , depending on the definition of `` peculiar . ''    in recent years , some variants from this simple prescription for sn  ia diversity have been found @xcite , including the intriguing object sn  2002cx .",
    "@xcite showed that sn  2002cx  had lines in its pre - maximum - light spectrum like sn 1991 t , a low total luminosity comparable to sn 1991bg , the lowest photospheric velocities ever measured in an sn  ia at maximum light , an almost normal @xmath3-band light curve but a bizarre plateau - like light curve in @xmath4 and @xmath5 , peculiar color evolution , and unusually rapid spectral evolution .",
    "they concluded that no existing theoretical model could match the combination of features that sn  2002cx  exhibited .",
    "@xcite showed that the peculiarities persisted to very late times .",
    "the spectrum of sn  2002cx  nearly 300 days after explosion was dominated by a forest of narrow permitted lines , each with a velocity width of @xmath0700 km s@xmath1 .",
    "they also reported the detection of low - velocity intermediate - mass elements and possibly , with important consequences for sn  ia explosion models .",
    "in addition , @xcite presented spectra of several similar objects , including sn  2005hk , showing that sn  2002cx  was not unique and therefore a new subclass of sne  ia had been overlooked until recently .    in this paper , we present keck spectropolarimetric data of sn  2005hk , a peculiar sn  ia very similar to sn  2002cx , and an analysis of the total - flux spectrum .",

    "sn 2005hk in ugc 272 was discovered ( burket & li 2005 ) at an unfiltered magnitude of @xmath017.5 on 2005 october 30.25 ( ut dates are used throughout this paper ) by the lick observatory supernova search with the 0.76-m katzman automatic imaging telescope ( li et al .",

    "the low photospheric velocities and faint apparent magnitude led @xcite to classify sn  2005hk  as a member of an emerging subclass of sn  2002cx - like sne  ia .",
    "we observed sn  2005hk  on 2005 november 5.4 using the low resolution imaging spectrometer ( lris ; oke et al .",
    "1995 ) on the keck i 10-m telescope in spectropolarimetry mode ( lrisp ) .",
    "we obtained a total exposure time of 5677  s in the four waveplate positions ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "the unusual total exposure time was due to poor guiding during the first exposure of the set , which required us to abort and restart the waveplate rotation sequence .",
    "after the end of the sequence , a short ( 200  s ) exposure in the second waveplate position ( @xmath8 ) was taken to complement the aborted first exposure .",
    "these two shortened exposures did not substantially change the polarimetry if they were included in the reductions , so we have used them in the analysis below .",
    "our instrumental setup employed both the blue and red sides of lrisp , with the d560 dichroic splitting the incoming light beam .",
    "the combination of the 600/5000 grism on the blue side and the 400/8500 grating on the red allowed us to cover a wavelength range of @xmath9  .",
    "the 1.5-wide slit gave a spectral resolution of 6    and 9    on the blue and red halves of the spectrum , respectively .",
    "conditions were good and the seeing was about 0.9  during the sn  2005hk  observations .",
    "basic two - dimensional image processing was accomplished using iraf , along with optimal extraction and wavelength calibration of the one - dimensional spectra .",
    "our own idl procedures @xcite were used to flux - calibrate the spectra and correct for telluric absorption .",
    "the starting airmass was low ( 1.07 ) , but it climbed to 1.2 by the end of observations .",
    "the slit was oriented at a position angle ( p.a . ) of 130  to minimize contamination from the host galaxy in background regions along the slit .",
    "the parallactic angle over the course of the observations varied from 10  to 50 , so differential light loss due to atmospheric dispersion @xcite is visible in the individual spectra of the polarimetric sequence .",
    "we assumed the first complete observation had the correct spectral shape , as it was taken at the lowest airmass and the p.a .",
    "was closest to parallactic .",
    "the spectral shape of the combined flux spectrum was corrected to that of the first observation by means of a low - order spline fit to the ratio of the two .",
    "the spectropolarimetric reductions followed the basic procedure of @xcite , as implemented by @xcite .",
    "the polarimetric standard star hd 204827 @xcite was observed to determine the p.a .",
    "offset of the instrument from the sky reference frame .",
    "the blue ( red ) side flux - weighted average polarization angle over the wavelength range 3980@xmath104920   ( 5890@xmath107270  ) was set to the catalogued value of 58.2  ( 59.1 ) for the @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) band .",
    "the derived offsets agreed to within 0.5  with observations of the polarization standard hd 19820 @xcite .",
    "two null standards , bd + 32  3739 and hd 57702 @xcite , were also observed and showed polarizations of @xmath110.08% .",

    ") , and appears very similar .",
    "the most prominent features in the spectra of both objects are absorptions due to @xmath124404 , 5129 .",
    "these lines are one of the distinguishing characteristics of the peculiar sn  1991t - like class of objects , which are represented in figure  [ compfig ] by both the prototype , sn 1991 t @xcite , and the well - observed sn  1997br @xcite .",
    "one distinction is that the absorption minima in sn  2002cx  and sn  2005hk  are observed to fall near 4320    and 5030   , implying unusually low expansion velocities ( @xmath06000 km s@xmath1 ) for these sne  ia near maximum light @xcite .    normal sne  ia at this epoch also have prominent spectral features due to intermediate - mass elements ( , , , etc . ) , as marked in figure  [ compfig ] next to the spectrum of sn  1994d ( filippenko 1997 ) .",
    "these features are much weaker in the other objects , but are clearly stronger in sn  2005hk  than in sn  1991 t .",
    "they are also stronger in this spectrum of sn  2005hk  than in the lick spectrum from three days earlier presented by @xcite , indicating rapid spectral evolution , as was observed in sn  2002cx  at early times @xcite .",
    "we used the parameterized supernova spectrum - synthesis code synow   @xcite to investigate the sn  2005hk  spectrum more quantitatively .",
    "synow  uses several simplifying assumptions for computational ease , such as spherical symmetry , a blackbody - emitting photosphere , and a resonance - scattering line source function in the sobolev approximation .",
    "each ionic species is assumed to have an optical depth that declines exponentially with velocity above some photospheric velocity , @xmath13 , with an e - folding scale @xmath14 , and level populations in local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) at some excitation temperature ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "the strength of synow  is that of a fast line - identification tool , rather than ejecta abundance determinations or detailed spectral modeling of the full sn spectrum .    in the top panel of figure  [ synowfig ]",
    ", we present a fit using seven ions that we believe are present in sn  2005hk  with high confidence .",
    "the photospheric velocity used in the fit was 5000 km s@xmath1 and the ions were assumed to have @xmath16 km s@xmath1 , with no maximum velocity imposed .",
    "( however , and are mildly detached , @xmath17  km  s@xmath1 . ) the low - ionization species ( , , , , and ) were fit using an excitation temperature of 10,000  k , while a higher @xmath15 of 15,000  k was used for the doubly ionized species ( and ) . the higher value of @xmath15 was necessary to match the strength of the feature near 5900   .",
    "this synthetic spectrum fails to fit some of the features of sn  2005hk , particularly at bluer wavelengths , so we generated a second fit with four additional ions ( , , , and ) , whose presence we regard as possible , but not definite .",
    "this second synthetic spectrum is shown in the bottom panel of figure  [ synowfig ] .",
    "the additional ions are responsible for spectral features at desirable wavelengths , as well as a decrease in the amount of near - ultraviolet ( uv ) flux , as discussed below .",
    "a list of reference lines used in the fit and their optical depth can be found in table 1 .",
    "@xcite presented a synow  analysis of the sn  2002cx  spectra .",
    "of most relevance to us as a basis for comparison is the earliest spectrum they analyzed , from one day before maximum light .",
    "the best fit for sn  2002cx  has @xmath18 km s@xmath1 and @xmath19 km s@xmath1 .",
    "while the derived parameters imply a somewhat higher photospheric velocity in sn  2002cx , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are covariant and the two spectra show very similar absorption minima , except that in direct comparison it is evident that the minimum of the @xmath206355 line is at a lower velocity in sn  2005hk .",
    "the sn  2002cx  synow  fit used six species ( , , , , , and ) , all of which are present in our sn  2005hk  fit .",
    "the presence of is not certain in either fit , but @xmath203760 matches the absorption seen near 3680   in both objects .",
    "@xcite observed that this sn  2002cx  fit could provide an adequate model for the sn 1991t - like object sn 1997br @xcite if the photospheric velocity were increased , indicating the kinship between these two classes of supernovae .",
    "the sn  2005hk  fit has five species not used for sn  2002cx .",
    "two of the ions , and , have their strongest effects on the spectrum between 7500    and 9500   , so they could not have been detected at early times in sn  2002cx  because the available spectra do not extend as far to the infrared ( ir ) .",
    "the @xmath204481 line also makes a contribution in the blue , but it could have been overlooked in sn  2002cx .",
    "we also note that the and lines in the red part of the spectrum are stronger than the neighboring ca ir triplet , which is opposite of most sne  ia @xcite . by comparison ,",
    "the early spectra of sn 1991 t are rather featureless at these wavelengths .",
    "oxygen and magnesium are both products of incomplete carbon burning , so their presence could be a diagnostic of the explosion process",
    ". we can not be certain that the difference here between sn  2005hk  and sn 1991 t is solely due to differing composition as opposed to greater velocity smearing or higher temperatures and ionization levels , but more detailed study is warranted .",
    "in addition , and are used in the second synow  fit shown in figure  [ synowfig ] , but were not used in the sn  2002cx  fit . their presence helps to fit features in the uv that were not included in the spectral range of the early sn  2002cx  spectra . in particular , the flux minimum near 3300    is rather interesting . sn 1991 t showed a deep absorption trough near 3200    that was interpreted by @xcite to be the signature of , and hence of complete silicon burning in the outer envelope of that object .",
    "@xcite showed that while iron - peak elements are responsible for the uv opacity in sne  ia , an atmosphere consisting solely of iron would have a flux _",
    "peak _ here , while nickel and cobalt produce a minimum .",
    "the more detailed models of @xcite confirmed and extended this result . by varying the composition of the atmosphere",
    ", they found that deflagration products ( taken from the popular w7 model of @xcite ) were inadequate to fit the depth of this feature in sn 1991 t at early times and a substantial amount of @xmath2ni and its decay products was necessary .",
    "synow  is the wrong tool to use to determine abundances in sn  2005hk , but the identification of and in this spectrum is suggestive of the presence of completely burned material in the outer layers of sn  2005hk .",
    "the presence or absence of carbon in the spectrum is particularly interesting because of the implications for modeling the explosion of sn  2005hk",
    ". some three - dimensional simulations of sn  ia deflagrations have shown that a significant amount ( @xmath040% ) of the carbon and oxygen remains after explosion @xcite .",
    "one potential explanation for both the low luminosity and low expansion velocities of sne 2002cx and 2005hk is that the explosions were very inefficient and an anomalously large amount of fuel was left unburned . at the conditions expected in an early - time sn  ia atmosphere , through are the relevant ionization stages of carbon @xcite .",
    "features attributed to @xmath206580 and @xmath207235 have been identified in the pre - maximum spectra of several normal sne  ia ( e.g. , sn 1998aq , branch et al .",
    "2003 ) and has been identified in the near - ir spectra of the peculiar low - luminosity sn 1999by @xcite , though @xcite placed strict upper limits on the presence of in the pre - maximum near - ir spectra of three normal sne  ia .",
    "unfortunately , our spectra do not extend far enough to the near - ir to test for the presence of lines .    in the synow  fit presented in the bottom panel of figure  [ synowfig ] ,",
    "we have included because an absorption near 4564   is consistent with the strongest optical line of , the triplet at @xmath204647 , blueshifted by the photospheric velocity .",
    "a similar feature was tentatively identified as in an early spectrum of sn  1999aa by @xcite .",
    "we regard this detection as possible because we can not claim an identification based on a single spectral feature to be unambiguous , especially given the many as - yet unidentified lines .",
    "the synow  fit shown in figure  [ synowfig ] does show an additional feature just outside of our wavelength range at 9300  , which might be observable in other spectra or other sn  2002cx - like objects .",
    "sn  2005hk  has a weak emission feature at 7250   with a corresponding p - cygni absorption at 7100   that seems promising for @xmath207235 , but attempts to fit it using synow  failed .",
    "the synow  fits to @xmath207235 overpredict absorption due to @xmath206580 .",
    "the observed spectrum does have an absorption feature at the appropriate wavelength , but it is much too weak to match the model .",
    "lte models generically predict that @xmath206580 should be stronger than @xmath207235 because the lower levels of @xmath207235 are the upper levels for @xmath206580 . likewise , the synthetic spectra with predict an absorption due to the @xmath204745 multiplet which falls on an observed emission feature at 4662  .",
    "the two longer - wavelength features are either not due to or they are far out of lte , but in any case we can not identify with certainty . @xcite encountered similar difficulties with the identification of in the early spectra of the more normal sn  ia 1990n ( but see mazzali 2001 ) . the wavelength coincidence of features in the observed spectrum with the strongest expected lines of and is suggestive , but we can not claim a firm detection of any form of carbon at this time .",
    "one last unusual aspect of the sn  2005hk  spectrum is the presence of many low - amplitude , high - frequency spectral features , particularly at wavelengths less than @xmath06000   .",
    "see figure  [ nafig ] for a closer look at some of these features , which have amplitudes of a few percent of the continuum over scales of 2030   . despite the eleven species present in the synthetic spectrum , it does not reproduce this small - scale structure .",
    "@xcite noted the existence of many weak features in the pre - maximum spectra of sn  2002cx .",
    "they were also unable to fit these features with synow  and speculated that either non - lte level populations enhanced otherwise weak lines or clumpy velocity structure in the ejecta might be responsible .",
    "the sn  2005hk  spectrum shows many of the same features , plus others visible due to its higher signal - to - noise ratio , making clumps at sn  2002cx - specific velocities seem less likely . in addition , if the ejecta were strongly clumped , we might expect to see some polarimetric signature , as in sn  2004dt ( wang et al .",
    "2006 ; see below ) .",
    "we do not at this time have solid identifications for these features , but their confinement to wavelengths blueward of 6000   suggests an origin in iron - peak elements .",
    "it is conceivable that many of them are also present in other sne  ia , but are blended together in objects with higher expansion velocities .        before analyzing the polarimetry",
    ", we must correct the observations for the effects of interstellar polarization ( isp ) , both in our own galaxy and in ugc 272 .",
    "the expected galactic contribution to the isp is low , as the galactic latitude is high ( @xmath21 @xmath22 ) and the dust maps of @xcite predict a galactic reddening , @xmath23 , of only 0.023 mag . the polarization efficiency",
    "( @xmath24 / @xmath25 ) of galactic dust has been found to be typically 3% mag@xmath1 , with a maximum value of 9% mag@xmath1 ( serkowski et al .",
    "we observed two stars , hd 2158 and hd 2636 , to act as probes of the actual galactic isp . following the prescription of @xcite ,",
    "both stars are within 0.6  of sn  2005hk  and have spectroscopic parallaxes that place them more than 150  pc above the galactic plane and thus sample almost all of the galactic dust column along that line of sight . according to the discussion above",
    ", we expect a polarization of about 0.07% , with a maximum of 0.2% . the actual debiased , flux - weighted @xmath26-band polarizations we measure for hd 2158 and hd 2636 are 0.14% at @xmath27  @xmath28 2  and 0.25% at @xmath29  @xmath28 1 , respectively .",
    "lacking a reason to prefer one star over the other , we averaged the two together to form our estimate of the galactic contribution to the isp , and smoothed versions of @xmath30 and @xmath31 were subtracted from the observations of the supernova .",
    "this non - parametric procedure was followed because at this low polarization level we must allow for the potential effects of instrumental polarization which might cause the polarization to not follow the standard wavelength dependence of @xcite .",
    "the null standards , as noted above , had measured polarizations below 0.08% , but we have seen instrumental polarization artifacts at the 0.1% level with lrisp in the past , particularly on the blue side of the spectrograph @xcite . the probe stars were observed immediately after sn  2005hk  and with the slit at the same position angle , and thus should have similar amounts of instrumental polarization , if any .",
    "any uncertainties in the removal of galactic isp are folded into the estimation of the host - galaxy contribution to isp below .",
    "it is instructive at this point to examine the location of the sn  2005hkspectropolarimetric data points in the @xmath32 plane , as shown in figure  [ qufig ] .",
    "the data have been binned up to 100 observed per point for clarity , and noisy data at the ends of the spectrum are not plotted in this figure .",
    "the first important fact is that the overall polarization is low , less than 0.5% .",
    "the second is that the points do not lie randomly in the plane .",
    "the distribution of points is elongated in a direction which does not intersect or point to the origin .",
    "this clearly means that host isp can not be the sole source of polarization in sn  2005hk  @xcite .",
    "the effect of vector subtraction of a small value of isp is similar to changing the origin of the @xmath32 plane , as the wavelength dependence of isp is not strong @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the data points at shorter wavelengths are systematically located below those at longer ones , indicating a gradient in polarization percentage in this object .",
    "the contribution of dust in the host galaxy of sn  2005hk , ugc 272 , to the total isp is harder to determine than that of our galaxy .",
    "the magnitude of the expected polarization can be estimated as above from the reddening , and the reddening in turn can be estimated from the interstellar na  i  d @xmath125890 , 5896 absorption lines .",
    "absorption due to na  i  d can be seen in figure  [ nafig ] at the redshift of ugc 272 , with an equivalent width ( ew ) of @xmath00.35   .",
    "@xcite found a crude relationship between the reddening and the total equivalent width of na  i  d absorption , @xmath33  mag  @xmath1 @xmath34 ew(na  i  d ) .",
    "this , combined with the @xcite relationship for polarization efficiency , yields an estimate for the typical expected host isp of 0.26% .    @xcite have also derived a relationship for the reddening as a function of the ew of the d1 component of na  i absorption , but the two components of the host na  i  d absorption are not resolved in our spectrum .",
    "the sightlines in the @xcite study showed a variation in the ratio of ews for na  i d1:d2 of 1.1:1 to 2:1 . using these values as a bracket for the true value ,",
    "the range of expected polarizations is 0.180.24% for the @xcite relationship , consistent with that predicted using the @xcite relationship .",
    "the dotted circle shown in figure  [ qufig ] has a radius of 0.26% to show the magnitude of the expected host isp relative to the data , though dust with maximal polarization efficiency could show three times as much polarization .",
    "the na i d methods described above can only estimate the magnitude of host isp , but not the direction .",
    "fortunately , we can use the sn  2005hkpolarimetry itself to estimate the host isp .",
    "the optical spectrum of an sn  ia at blue wavelengths is expected to have almost no continuum polarization on theoretical grounds .",
    "opacity due to many overlapping spectral features from iron - peak elements should act to depolarize the continuum , even if the continuum is intrinsically polarized by electron scattering in an aspherical atmosphere @xcite .",
    "different authors in the literature have chosen different methods to take advantage of this assumption .",
    "@xcite used an isp that made the polarization at the ( arbitrary ) blue end of their spectra almost zero .",
    "@xcite and @xcite used the polarization at specific wavelengths of blue ( @xmath35  5000  ) emission features to define an isp under the assumption that the observed polarization of these emission features is entirely due to isp .",
    "we adopt a spectral window of 40004200     in the sn rest frame to measure our host isp .",
    "the exact endpoints of this window are arbitrary , but this region was chosen to avoid the strong and absorption lines at nearby wavelengths which could potentially show polarization features . our measured value for ( @xmath36,@xmath37 ) of ( 0.009% , @xmath38% ) has a formal uncertainty of 0.018% in each stokes parameter .",
    "this point is marked by a square in figure  [ qufig ] , and is consistent with our expectations from the reddening arguments above .",
    "we have adopted a @xcite law with @xmath39 to subtract this isp on the assumption that dust in ugc  272 resembles galactic dust .    as an aside",
    ", we note that it is possible to use these polarization measurements as a constraint on the reddening to sn  2005hk .",
    "one possible explanation for the low apparent luminosity of sn 2002cx - like objects is extinction , though this is hard to reconcile with the relatively blue early - time  color of sn  2002cx @xcite .",
    "we have adopted a host isp of 0.272% , which for standard dust polarization efficiencies corresponds to @xmath40=0.091  mag .",
    "if this is combined with the galactic contribution and @xmath41 of 3.1 is adopted , then we estimate a total extinction of @xmath42 mag , not nearly enough to conclude sn  2005hk  was an sn  ia of intrinsically normal luminosity ( phillips et al .",
    "2006 , in prep . ) .",
    "the continuum polarization of sne  ia can be understood as the result of electron scattering in an aspherical supernova atmosphere @xcite .",
    "if the projection of the supernova on the sky were circularly symmetric , the local polarization vectors would cancel each other when averaged over the unresolved object and no polarization would be measured .",
    "therefore , the continuum polarization level represents a meaningful measurement of the asphericity of the supernova .",
    "a number of authors have used the spectral region near 7000   to define a continuum polarization because of the relative lack of strong lines @xcite . here",
    "we choose the ( rest - frame ) wavelength range 70007500    to define a continuum region in sn  2005hk .",
    "the wavelengths were chosen to avoid the @xmath207774 absorption trough .",
    "we measure stokes parameters of ( 0.124% , 0.088% ) for this region prior to isp subtraction , and mark this point with a diamond in figure  [ qufig ] .",
    "after subtraction of our chosen isp , this continuum region has a polarization angle of 35.6  at a level of 0.36% , an entirely typical value for a normal sn  ia , as discussed below .",
    "the one - dimensional presentation of spectropolarimetric data is problematic because of the inherent two - dimensional nature of the measured stokes parameters .",
    "in addition , at low polarizations the formal polarization ( @xmath43 ) is statistically biased .",
    "one solution is to rotate the @xmath32 coordinate system by a convenient amount to new , rotated stokes parameters ( rsp ) chosen to align one stokes parameter ( called @xmath44 here ) with the axis of the system . in this new coordinate system",
    ", @xmath44 is an estimator of the total amount of polarization aligned with the axis of symmetry and @xmath45 can show deviations from a single axis of symmetry in the system .    for sn  2005hk ,",
    "we have chosen to rotate the stokes parameters by 35.6to align @xmath44 with our chosen red continuum window of 70007500   .",
    "these new rotated stokes parameters are presented in figure  [ spolfig ] and show a continuum polarization rising from zero near 4000    ( by construction for this choice of isp ) to @xmath00.4% at 9000   .",
    "the flatness of the @xmath46 curve and the lack of significant features in @xmath45 show that a single axis of symmetry dominates the continuum polarization .",
    "note that at very low polarization levels , such as seen at wavelengths less than 5000   in our data , the angle of polarization becomes ill - defined .",
    "no strong line features are seen in the polarimetry , but there does appear to be a weak polarization modulation at the @xmath205129 line . a 0.2% depression in @xmath44 indicates some depolarization and a smaller feature in @xmath45 may indicate a rotation of the axis of symmetry .",
    "other , smaller polarimetric features may also be present , but we caution against over - interpretation of weak ( @xmath110.1 % ) spectropolarimetric features .",
    "early attempts to measure broad - band polarization of sne  ia were unsuccessful , both due to the low intrinsic polarization levels and the difficulty of disentangling the effects of isp , so intrinsic polarization remained undetected until sn 1996x showed marginal evidence at the @xmath00.3% level @xcite . since then , intrinsic polarization has been detected in a number of sne  ia , both in the continuum and in line features @xcite .",
    "there are no published spectropolarimetric data for sn 1991t - like or sn  2002cx - like objects to act as a basis for comparison with sn  2005hk , but there are a few relevant measurements .",
    "sn  2004bv had an early - time spectrum that showed prominent lines like sn 1991 t @xcite , and @xcite obtained a single epoch of @xmath4-band imaging polarimetry two weeks after maximum light .",
    "they found a polarization of 0.11% @xmath28 0.02% , consistent with the polarization of the foreground stars in their field and therefore with low intrinsic supernova polarization . @xcite reported on maximum - light spectropolarimetry of the unique sn  ia 2000cx , which resembled the sn 1991t - like class of objects @xcite .",
    "they found a continuum polarization of @xmath00.5% , with a 0.3% modulation across the line , but most of the continuum polarization may be due to isp ( d. leonard , private com . ) .",
    "sne  ia with normal spectra and luminosities have shown continuum polarizations at the level of @xmath00.3% @xcite",
    ". two subluminous sne  ia , sn 1997dt and sn 1999by ( which resembled sn 1991bg ) , have shown somewhat higher continuum polarizations , up to 0.5% and 0.8% , respectively , with the exact values dependent on assumptions about isp and the limited wavelength range of the observations for these two objects @xcite .    in summary ,",
    "the magnitude of the continuum polarization in sn  2005hk  is entirely consistent with observations of other sne  ia .",
    "core - collapse supernovae , by contrast , show polarizations of up to a few percent ( e.g. , leonard & filippenko 2005 ) .",
    "current evidence seems to indicate that the core - collapse supernova explosion mechanism is fundamentally aspherical , and objects with lower polarization levels are those with extensive hydrogen envelopes that act to damp and hide asymmetries .",
    "the low polarization of thermonuclear supernovae indicates a more nearly spherical explosion mechanism .",
    "whatever unknown mechanisms are generating asphericities in the explosions of normal sne  ia , such as instabilities in the growth of a deflagration front ( e.g. , ghezzi et al . 2004 ) , are probably also responsible in sn  2005hk .",
    "the continuum polarization percentage in some other sne  ia varies with wavelength .",
    "the most striking example is the low - luminosity sn  1999by @xcite , whose polarization rises dramatically to the red , as it does to a lesser extent in sn  2005hk .",
    "thomson scattering is independent of wavelength , so the slope in polarization percentage is interpreted as a signature of the depolarizing effect of line opacity , which is stronger at uv and blue wavelengths than in the red @xcite .",
    "this result is dependent on the choice of isp , which has been driven by the expectation of low intrinsic polarization at blue wavelengths .",
    "sn  2001el provides a note of caution , as the isp derived from the polarization of blue emission features at early times @xcite does not agree with the polarization at late times @xcite when the intrinsic polarization should be low .",
    "we do not have multiple epochs of polarimetric data on sn  2005hk , so we can not use the late - time polarization to test our choice of isp .    a number of sne  ia have shown definite spectropolarimetric line features , but in sn  2005hk  they are weak . the strongest line features ( @xmath472.5% ) have been seen in those sne  ia that show high - velocity absorption at early times in the ca ir triplet and the lines .",
    "@xcite showed that partial obscuration of the photosphere by clumps of intermediate - mass elements at high velocity provides an adequate description of the polarimetric data for sn  2001el , perhaps due to a gravitationally confined detonation @xcite .",
    "@xcite preferred to explain the strong polarization features of sn  2004dt by clumpy protrusions of silicon into an oxygen - rich layer in the outer sn atmosphere , maybe as a result of turbulent burning processes during the explosion .",
    "sn  2005hk  does not show high - velocity absorptions and the and lines are weak , so these strong polarization modulations are not expected .",
    "we can at least conclude that the lack of strong polarization increases in the absorption troughs of sn  2005hk  limits the presence of inhomogeneous clumps above the photosphere .",
    "sne  ia lacking the high - velocity material show much smaller line polarization features , usually at the same level as the continuum polarization or less @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that , in general , strong absorption lines in sne  ia should be associated with polarization minima as most photons have been absorbed and reemitted in the line , destroying the directional information imprinted by electron scattering .",
    "the spectral features in sn  2005hk  may be just too weak to leave strong polarization signatures .",
    "for example , some of the strongest polarization features have been seen in other sne  ia in the @xmath206355 absorption line , but in sn  2005hk  the absorption depth is only @xmath012% of the continuum . in the simple aspherical toy models of @xcite , such a feature",
    "would only be expected to result in a polarization feature that was at most @xmath012% of the continuum polarization level .",
    "this model does not take into account optical depth effects , clumping , or multiple overlapping lines , but it may allow us to understand the lack of strong spectropolarimetric line features in sn  2005hk . for a continuum polarization of 0.4% , this model would predict a polarization modulation in the line that is undetectable at our current signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the strongest optical lines in sn  2005hk  are the blue lines and we do see evidence for depolarization by 0.2% and maybe an angle rotation in @xmath205129 .",
    "the polarization signatures in the blue may be expected to be small ( in the absence of clumping ) if all the weak overlapping iron - peak lines destroy polarization of the pseudo - continuum at blue wavelengths , so the additional opacity of strong lines has little additional depolarizing effect .",
    "although no pre - existing supernova model explains all the peculiarities of sn  2002cx , one new model that does address some of the issues and makes specific polarimetric predictions for both the continuum and lines is the ejecta hole model of @xcite .",
    "they followed up on the simulations of @xcite , who determined that the donor star to the exploding white dwarf of an sn  ia could leave a noticeable imprint on the ejecta in the form of a hole .",
    "the opening angle of the hole was 3040  for main sequence , sub - giant , or red giant donor stars .",
    "@xcite found that sightlines down the hole allow an observer to see more deeply into the ejecta .",
    "this has several effects on the observed spectrum , including increasing the prominence of higher - ionization species , weakening absorption lines , and lowering the observed photospheric velocity relative to more typical sightlines .",
    "these effects seem promising for sne 2002cx and 2005hk .",
    "unfortunately , they also found that objects viewed down a hole would be somewhat brighter than normal .",
    "kasen et al .",
    "avoided this difficulty by proposing that if sn 1991t - like objects are intrinsically normal sne  ia viewed down a hole , then sn  2002cx - like objects could be the analogues of the subluminous sn 1991bg - like class of objects , but viewed down an ejecta hole .",
    "one difficulty with this scenario is that the sn  2002cx - like objects have only been seen in late - type spiral galaxies @xcite , while the sn 1991bg - like objects are more common in early - type galaxies @xcite .    with that in mind",
    ", @xcite made specific spectropolarimetric predictions for the consequences of an ejecta hole .",
    "if the system were oriented such that our line of sight were aimed straight down the hole , then the projection onto the sky would be symmetrical and very little polarization should be expected .",
    "such an exact alignment would be quite rare and even small angular offsets from the axis of symmetry should produce measurable effects .",
    "they made a sample calculation of a polarization spectrum for a line of sight oriented 20  to the axis of their model hole ( opening half - angle of 40 ) and found that such an orientation gave very low continuum polarization ( @xmath00.1% , reflecting the fact that their model was symmetric apart from the hole ) with strong line polarization peaks ( @xmath01% level ) .",
    "we measure a somewhat higher continuum polarization and no strong line features , in apparent contradiction to the expectations of this model .",
    "we have presented single - epoch spectropolarimetry of sn  2005hk  and an analysis of the high signal - to - noise - ratio total - flux spectrum .",
    "the flux spectrum is very similar to that of the peculiar sn  ia 2002cx .",
    "both supernovae resemble the class of sn 1991t - like objects near maximum light in that they show prominent lines of and only weak lines of intermediate - mass elements like and that characterize the early spectra of normal sne  ia @xcite .",
    "in addition , sn  2005hk  shows low expansion velocities of @xmath06000 km s@xmath1 , similar to those of sn  2002cx .",
    "@xcite found that no existing theoretical model for sne  ia could reproduce all of the peculiarities of sn  2002cx .",
    "observations of sn  2005hk  provide additional constraints for models of this new subclass of sne  ia .",
    "we have presented a set of line identifications using synow .",
    "our synow  fit for sn  2005hk  is very similar to a previous analysis of sn  2002cx@xcite , but with five additional ionic species .",
    "four of these are due to our superior wavelength range and do not necessarily indicate spectral differences between the two objects . a detailed analysis of a time series of spectra",
    "could also clarify the identification of spectral features attributed to those species whose presence is less certain in our analysis of this individual spectrum . if all of our possible line identifications are correct , then we have identified the signatures of iron - peak elements , intermediate - mass elements , and maybe unburned carbon at similar velocities in the early spectra of sn  2005hk .",
    "our synow - based analysis is unsuitable for determining the actual relative abundances of these three groups of species , but a clear next step for future research is for detailed supernova spectrum synthesis codes to attempt to model the spectrum of sn  2005hk .    of particular interest",
    "is whether normal deflagration products ( e.g. , nomoto et al . 1984 ) can fit the sn  2005hk  spectrum for favorable values of the temperature , density , and ionization .",
    "@xcite found evidence for the large - scale mixing predicted in three - dimensional simulations of deflagrations @xcite in the presence of low - velocity intermediate - mass elements and possibly at late times in sn  2002cx .",
    "alternatively , our identification of and in sn  2005hk  might be evidence for freshly synthesized @xmath2ni and its decay products in the outer layers of the supernova , as was interpreted in sn 1991 t to be the sign of a detonation @xcite .",
    "the short half - life of @xmath2ni implies that nickel must have been present in larger quantities at earlier times for it to still be seen in the current spectrum , so the signatures of nickel should be looked for in any spectra of sn  2002cx - like objects obtained at very early epochs .",
    "a potential consequence is that radioactive material present in the outermost ejecta might not make a large contribution to the luminosity .",
    "one of the most perplexing mysteries of sn  2002cx  is how that object could have a spectrum dominated by iron at both early and late times and yet have such a low luminosity and small expansion velocities .",
    "the characteristic velocity scale ( and hence kinetic energy per unit mass ) of sne  ia near maximum light ( @xmath4810,000 km s@xmath1 ) is set by the energy release of the fusion of carbon and oxygen up to iron - peak or even just intermediate - mass elements .",
    "the presence of a large fraction of unburned material that adds inertial mass to the ejecta could solve this puzzle , but evidence of this raw material in the spectra is scarce .",
    "one argument against a large amount of unburned material is the rapid spectral evolution seen originally in sn  2002cx , and confirmed in sn  2005hk  by the stronger lines of intermediate - mass elements seen in this spectrum compared to the one from three days earlier @xcite .",
    "this may indicate that the outer ejecta have relatively low mass , though an analysis of the photometry and spectral evolution is needed to confirm this hypothesis .",
    "one line of evidence in favor of unburned material is the possible presence of weak lines in the late - time spectra of sn  2002cx .",
    "here we have looked for carbon in the early - time spectrum of sn  2005hk  and have obtained some potential evidence for .",
    "features suggestive of are also present , but we were unable to find a good fit , though more detailed handling of non - lte effects might allow a secure identification to be made .",
    "similar features seen in normal sne  ia have been identified as in the past @xcite .",
    "@xcite were able to show that the peculiar subluminous sn 1999by had unburned material above the photosphere at early times by detecting lines in the near - ir .",
    "near - ir spectroscopy of sn  2005hk  or another member of the class of sn 2002cx - like objects at early times would be very useful to see if they more closely resemble sn 1999by in this respect or the more normal sn  ia sample of @xcite , which lacked the lines .",
    "our spectropolarimetric data for sn  2005hk  are perhaps the least unusual aspect of the object .",
    "they show a low level of continuum polarization ( @xmath00.4% ) and evidence for only weak line features .",
    "therefore , the level of asphericity is quite normal for an sn  ia and models for the unusual aspects of the sn  2002cx - like class of objects that invoke large deviations from spherical symmetry can be rejected , such as the ejecta hole model of @xcite .",
    "the lack of strong line features in the spectropolarimetry may be related to the weakness of the and lines .",
    "if this is correct , sn 1991t - like objects observed in the future may only show weak polarimetric line features , unless clumping in the ejecta is important .",
    "lastly , a full identification of the weak spectral features might provide additional insight into the nature of sn  2005hk .",
