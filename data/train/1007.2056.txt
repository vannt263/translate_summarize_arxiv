    "in the last three decades the physics community has been fascinated by topological states of quantum matter , initiated by the discovery of the quantum hall effect ( qhe ) by von klitzing in 1981  @xcite .",
    "recently it has been discovered that a new class of materials , referred to as _",

    "these materials are two- or three - dimensional band insulators with a large spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) and exhibit the so - called quantum spin - hall ( qsh ) effect  @xcite . here",

    "the latter is characterized by the z@xmath0 topological invariant defined on a fibre bundle associated to the wave - functions over the first brillouin zone  @xcite .",
    "we show that spatial deformations | modifying the lattice topology | induce a change in the z@xmath0 invariant , thus leading to a topological phase transition from a qsh insulator to a ni .    specifically , we study the effect of adding an additional site to the unit cell of a honeycomb lattice ( hcl ) subjected to soi . while this lattice deformation preserves the relativistic behavior of the low - energy modes ,",
    "we show that the system undergoes a topological phase transition that changes its topological class , labeled by the z@xmath0 index , and its transport properties .",
    "the possibility to investigate this topological phase transition with ultra - cold atoms trapped in optical lattices is promising  @xcite . in this context ,",
    "cold - atom experiments are not only suitable for engineering the qsh phase  @xcite and to test its stability with respect to controllable disorder  @xcite , but also to induce lattice transformations .",

    "two of the latter ( generally called _ rim _ a and b ) are characterized by a coordination number 3 while one site ( referred to as _ hub _ h ) is connected to 6 nearest - neighbors  @xcite .",

    "the effects of the rashba - type soi on the transport properties of the hcl and @xmath6  lattice have been reported in refs .",

    "we start by analyzing the effect of finite soi on the energy spectrum of the infinite @xmath6  lattice . because of the unequal connectivity of rim and hub sites , the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : so ] )",
    "effectively induces hopping between rim sites of the same kind while this is cancelled for hub sites .",
    "the spectrum is obtained by exact diagonalization ( cf .",

    "[ sec : emd ] ) .    a direct way of visualizing the soi effects is to consider a finite piece of the lattice .",
    "the associated tb hamiltonian can then be diagonalized with periodic boundary conditions imposed along one of the spatial directions .",
    "the hcl with finite soi is characterized by the qsh phase : for each energy value within the bulk energy - gap exists a single time - reversed pair of eigenstates on each edge of the lattice ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : three]a ) | these form two kramers doublets , one on each edge .",
    "the conservation of trs prevents the mixing of this couple of states due to small external perturbations and scattering from disorder  @xcite .",
    "the qsh phase is intrinsic to the bulk energy spectrum and can be validated by topological constants .",
    "two important topological invariants are the @xmath35 index @xmath1  @xcite and the spin chern number @xmath36  @xcite . in the absence of spin - mixing perturbations",
    ", both are related by @xmath37 , where @xmath38 and @xmath39 represent the chern numbers associated to the individual spins . for the hcl",
    "it has been shown that @xmath2 therefore classifying it as a topological insulator .",

    "gapless edge states are also found for energies located within the gaps between the electron / hole band and the non - dispersive band , respectively ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : three]b ) .",
    "however , contrary to the hcl case , we find two distinct crossing points for these edge states . for each energy value inside",
    "the bulk gaps two couples of time - reversed kramers doublets are present , which therefore give rise to four pairs of states along the two edges . as a result , even if soi allow for edge states within the bulk energy gap , these are not protected against disorder by trs | a scattering potential can couple a left - mover into a right - mover and _ vice versa_. this is confirmed by the topological invariants ( cf .",
    "[ sec : z2 ] ) : we find that the @xmath35-index vanishes and that the spin chern number @xmath41 . for this reason the @xmath6  lattice is topologically trivial .",
    "a transition from the hcl to the @xmath6  lattice is accomplished by varying the hopping parameter between hub and rim b from 0 to @xmath8 .",
    "the remarkable result is that even for an infinitesimal coupling , the system is in the trivial insulating phase .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the different behavior of the hcl and the @xmath6  lattice with respect to the soi arises from the different topologies of the two systems .",
    "the @xmath6  lattice can be viewed as two nested hcls ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : one]b ) .",
    "this supports the conjecture that two coupled topological insulators behave as a topologically trivial insulator  @xcite .",
    "we can interpret the effect of lattice topology also from a different perspective .",
    "although both lattices allow for a description in terms of a relativistic hamiltonian  ( [ eq : diracweyl ] ) in the long - wavelength approximation , only the hcl that is associated with a pseudo - spin 1/2 is a topological insulator whereas the @xmath6  lattice with pseudo - spin 1 is not .",
    "nevertheless , the existence of other topological insulators associated with pseudo - spin 1  @xcite suggests that the key factor is not the dimension of the pseudo - spin but rather the _ total spin _ of the systems under consideration , c.f .",
    "[ tab : spin ] . in terms of the relativistic approximation  ( [ eq : diracweyl ] )",
    "the total spin is given by the combination of the valley - spin , accounting for the topology of the bravais lattice , the pseudo - spin , associated with the number of lattice sites in the unit cell , and the _ real _ fermion spin .",
    "in the case of the hcl we have to combine three half - integer spins resulting in a half - integer total spin . on the contrary , for the @xmath6  lattice we obtain an integer spin by combining two half - integer spins with an integer one .",
    "this conjecture is further supported by the fact that both the kagome lattice  @xcite and the lieb lattice  @xcite are non - trivial topological insulators , while the bilayer graphene is trivial  @xcite .",
    "several proposals for realizing optical lattices resembling the hcl and the @xmath6  lattice have been put forward recently .",
