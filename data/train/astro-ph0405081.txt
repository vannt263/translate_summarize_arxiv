    "galaxies in clusters reside in a special environment which is characterized by high galaxy densities , the presence of a hot intracluster medium ( icm ) and vast amounts of dark matter .",
    "this environment strongly influences the evolution of the cluster members superposed on the field galaxy evolution that arises from the hierarchical growth of objects and the declining star formation rates over cosmic epochs . besides tidal interactions ( including merging ) as known from the field , cluster galaxies are affected by clusterspecific phenomena related to the structure of the cluster ( like harassment ) or to the icm ( like ram - pressure stripping ) .",
    "these mechanisms can cause substantial distortions of the internal kinematics of disk galaxies leading to `` rotation curves '' ( rcs ) that no longer follow the universal form ( persic et al .",
    "rubin et al . ( 1999 ) , for example , classified half of their sample galaxies observed in the virgo cluster as kinematically disturbed ( asymmetric or even truncated curves ) . on the other hand , many cluster galaxies follow a tight tully  fisher relation ( tfr ) ( e.g. giovanelli et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "an important idea presently discussed came from the finding that local clusters are dominated by elliptical and lenticular galaxies while the distant ones show a high fraction of spiral and irregular galaxies ( dressler et al .",
    "1997 ) : field spirals might fall into clusters and experience a morphological transformation into s0 galaxies .",
    "related to this scenario it is not yet clear whether the halo of dark matter and , therefore , the total mass and the rc of a galaxy can also be affected by certain interaction phenomena .",
    "first results on the kinematics of galaxies in distant clusters were presented by metevier ( 2004 ) with 10 tf  galaxies in the cluster cl0024@xmath21654 ( @xmath3 ) and by milvang ",
    "jensen et al .  ( 2003 ) with 8 spirals in ms1054.40321 ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "while the first study sees a larger scatter of their sample galaxies in the tf diagram without evidence for an evolution of the zero point , the second one finds a trend towards brighter luminosities ( 0.51 @xmath5 mag ) with respect to field spirals of comparable redshifts .",
    "it is argued that either truncation of star formation or starbursts may cause an increased or decreased mass  to  light ratio , respectively .",
    "during 5 nights at the eso  vlt we gained spectra of galaxies within 7 clusters in the redshift range @xmath6 with fors1&2 .",
    "one of our goals was the derivation of spatially resolved rcs to analyse the internal kinematics of the galaxies and to construct the tfr ( tully and fisher 1977 ) of distant clusters .",
    "hst / wfpc2 images of the core regions were retrieved from the archive to complement our own ground  based imaging . here",
    "we present results of three of the clusters , cl041365  ( @xmath7 ) and ms100812  ( @xmath8 ) , cl0303@xmath217  ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "observations were made in 1999 and 2000 with fors mounted at the cassegrain focus of the vlt .",
    "we used grism 600r and get a spectral resolution of @xmath10 at a slitwidth of 1arcsec .",
    "the spatial scale was 0.2 arcsec / pixel with a dispersion of @xmath111.08  / pixel .",
    "the total integration time was set to @xmath122 hrs to meet our signal  to  noise requirements .",
    "seeing conditions ranged between 0.4 and 1.3 arcsec fwhm .",
    "two mos setups have been observed for each cluster , yielding 116 objects with apparent magnitudes in the range @xmath13 .",
    "a detailed description of the sample selection and data reduction including finding charts and data tables can be found in jger et al .",
    "( 2004 ) . for the derivation of position velocity diagrams we followed the way described in detail in bhm et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and ziegler et al.(2003 ) . here",
    "we only give some short remarks on this topic .",
    "all rcs were determined using either the [ oii]3727 , h@xmath14 or [ oiii]5007 emission line .",
    "gaussian fits have been applied stepping along the spatial axis with a median filter window of typically 0.6 arcsecs to enhance the s / n . since",
    "the apparent disk sizes of spirals at intermediate redshifts are only slightly larger than the slit width ( 1arcsec ) , the spectroscopy covers a substantial fraction of the two  dimensional velocity field .",
    "thus , the maximum rotation velocity @xmath15 ( the constant rotation in the outer part of a galaxy due to the dark matter halo ) can not be determined `` straightforwardly '' from the observed rotation . to tackle this problem",
    ", we simulated the spectroscopy of each galaxies velocity field with the respective inclination and position angle , also taking seeing and luminosity weighting into account .",
    "the simulated rotation curves which best reproduced the observed ones ( solid lines in fig.1 ) yielded the values of @xmath15 .",
    "redshifts and spectral types could be determined for 89 galaxies . from the 50 cluster members , 35 turned out to be late type galaxies .",
    "only 13 cluster galaxies exhibit a rotation curve of the universal form rising in the inner region and passing over into a flat part .",
    "the other members have peculiar kinematics or too low s / n . for 7 non  cluster galaxies @xmath16 could also be measured .",
    "only those rotation curves which show no strong perturbations are eligible for a determination of @xmath16 as needed for the tf diagram which is shown in fig.2 .",
    "@xmath16 could be measured for 7(ms100812 ) , 5(cl041365 ) , and 2(cl0303@xmath217 ) cluster members , respectively .",
    "luminosities were derived from total magnitudes ( measured with sextractor , see bertin & arnouts ( 1996 ) ) of @xmath17 ( ms100812 ) , @xmath18 ( cl041365 ) , and @xmath19 ( cl0303@xmath217 ) fors images corrected for galactic and intrinsic extinction , transformed to restframe johnson @xmath5 according to sed type , and calculated for a flat @xmath20 cosmology ( @xmath21kms@xmath22mpc@xmath22 ) .    within our tf diagram the distant cluster spirals",
    "are distributed similar to the fors deep field ( fdf ) spirals ( ziegler et al .",
    "2002 , bhm et al .",
    "2004 ) which have been observed with exactly the same instrument configuration and which represent a similar cosmic epoch ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "no significant deviation from the distant field tfr is visible and the cluster sample has not an increased scatter , but the low number of cluster members prohibits any quantitative statistical analysis .",
    "we can conclude that the mass  to  light ratios of the observed distant cluster spirals cover the same range as the distant field population indicating that no clusterspecific phenomenon dramatically changed the stellar populations .",
    "in particular , there was no starburst in the recent past of the examined cluster galaxies that would have significantly risen their luminosities .",
    "since we mostly selected bright galaxies , the cluster members occupy a region in the tf diagram where no significant luminosity evolution is visible with respect to the local tfr .    on the other hand , this conclusion is true only for those objects that enter the tf diagram and is not valid for the whole cluster sample . more than half of our cluster galaxies can not be used for a tf analysis due to their peculiar kinematics not following the `` rise  turnover ",
    "flat '' rc shape of large , isolated spirals .",
    "this is in contrast to the smaller fraction of peculiar curves in our sample of the fdf spirals .",
    "the objects with peculiar rcs may actually be subject to ongoing or recent interactions .",
    "indeed , a morphological classification of the cluster spirals in terms of their asymmetry indices ( abraham et al .",
    "1996 ) reveals that they have a slightly higher degree of asymmetry on the mean than the kinematically less disturbed ones . a correlation between morphological and kinematical disturbance hints to a common origin for both in `` strong '' interactions like close encounters with tidal effects , accretion events or even mergers .",
    "such processes most probably also influence the stellar populations of a galaxy changing its integrated luminosity as well .",
    "no trend is visible of the rc form with ( projected ) clustercentric distance ( cf .",
    "but since all observed galaxies are located within the virial radius , this is in compliance with dynamical models in which the galaxy population of a cluster is well - mixed within that region . in particular , we most probably do not have any new arrivals from the field in our sample . +"
