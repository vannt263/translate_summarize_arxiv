    "one such region , the scorpius - centaurus ( hereafter `` sco - cen '' ) association , with a distance of @xmath1120 - 150pc @xcite and 5 - 20myr age ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",

    "the young age of this association ensures that any planetary and brown dwarf companions will have elevated luminosity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , allowing access to planetary mass objects even with observations achieving modest relative contrasts .",
    "in addition to selecting young targets , observing stars more massive than solar ( `` intermediate mass stars '' , 2 - 5@xmath2 ) may also enhance the probability of detection of substellar objects .",
    "indeed , some studies suggest the fraction of super - jupiter companions may be higher for stars more massive than @xmath12@xmath2  @xcite , possibly due to initially more massive circumstellar disks ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or possibly to serve as a reservoir for the conserved initial angular momentum of the star forming cloud ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the relatively short main - sequence lifetimes of these intermediate mass stars implies young associations such as sco - cen should have a greater fraction of these stars compared to the local solar neighborhood , making sco - cen a particularly promising region to study young , intermediate mass stars .    to date , the only companions to sco - cen _ intermediate - mass _ stars lie at wide separations ( @xmath130 - 3200au , e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the @xmath1120150pc distance to sco - cen stars means that orbital separations of substellar companions to these stars located near the ice line ( 5 - 10au ) , where planet formation is thought to be most efficient ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "thus , sensitivity near , and within , the diffraction limit of large telescopes is needed to access smaller orbital separations for sco - cen stars @xcite .",
    "aperture masking interferometry ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "we first estimated the visual extinction for each of our targets by comparing the observed @xmath51 colors of our target stars with the @xmath51 colors for the corresponding spectral types tabulated by @xcite .",
    "as noted in table[targtable ] , the spectral types we assume come either from the hd catalog @xcite or from @xcite .",

    "we assume that our uncertainties in spectral type result in @xmath51 color uncertainties of 0.1 - 0.2 mag , while the uncertainties in the color versus spectral type relation do not exceed 0.05 mag .",
    "next , using this estimated and the observed @xmath51 color , we estimate a@xmath49  using the relation between a@xmath49  and @xmath52 from @xcite . using the spectral types and uncertainties , we adopt bc@xmath50  values from @xcite , where the uncertainty in bc@xmath50  is set by the uncertainty in the spectral type .",
    "we then combine @xmath48 mag , a@xmath49 , bc@xmath50 , and the distance modulus to calculate bolometric absolute magnitudes @xmath47 , and its uncertainty .",
    "next , we estimate @xmath53  and its uncertainty using the spt along with the tabulated values in @xcite .",
    "lastly , we use the @xmath53  and @xmath47 values calculated above to calculate the mass for each target star by calculating a two - dimensional surface , mass(@xmath53 , @xmath47 ) , and then marginalizing the probability distribution function of ( @xmath53 , @xmath47 ) to obtain 1@xmath54 confidence intervals .",
    "these masses are listed in table[targtable ]",
    ".    as table[targtable ] shows , all of the stars considered in this paper are members of either the upper centaurus lupus ( hereafter `` ucl '' ) or the upper scorpius ( hereafter `` u sco '' ) subgroups . rather than assign distances to each star that reflect the average distances of the sco - cen subgroups ( e.g.125@xmath915 pc and 145@xmath915 pc for ucl and u sco , respectively )",
    ", we use the individual hipparcos parallaxes recorded for these stars , since the individual parallax uncertainties associated with each target are comparable to the subgroup distance uncertainties ( @xmath110% ) . however , hip 78233 has a recorded hipparcos parallax inconsistent with the median u sco members , with large uncertainty ( 4.84@xmath91.37mas ) .",
    "so we assign to it a distance of 145@xmath915 pc , the median distance to u sco .",
    "while we have selected our targets partly based on their high probabilities of sco - cen membership as stated in @xcite , placement of the host stars on an hr diagram using the values calculated in table[targtable ] verifies all targets can be well fit between the 10 and 20 myr isochrones from @xcite .",
    "these ages are broadly consistent with the reported ages of ucl and u sco .",
    "some disagreement persists over the age of u sco , which ranges from 5 myr @xcite to as high as 11 myr @xcite .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . further , when placed on an hr diagram at least half of our targets ( hip71724 , hip78196 and hip79124 ) have positions in the hr diagram that are consistent with a 5myr isochrone . nonetheless , for overall consistency we report our derived masses using a 10 - 20 myr age range .",
    "all the data presented in this work were obtained at @xmath18-band wavelengths ( 3.76 @xmath55 m ) using the nirc2 infrared camera and ao system at the w. m. keck observatory using , as well as the eso very large telescope ( `` vlt '' ) naco ao system and infrared camera . an observing sequence consisted of observing a target star in two opposed quadrants of the infrared camera : nirc2 at keck , and conica at the vlt .",
    "a nine hole aperture mask is used at keck , and a seven hole mask was used at vlt , producing interferograms like that shown in figure 1 of @xcite . at both detector positions , we typically obtained 15 images ( 30 images total ) with an effective exposure time of 20s each .",
    "usually two to four such 30-image sequences of each target star were obtained .",
    "we did not explicitly observe calibrator stars for each of our target stars , as is common practice .",
    "rather , we use all of the stars in a given observing night as mutual calibrators .",
    "those with closure phase signals indicative of a companion are weighted lower in the list of calibrators than those without . in a single",
    "observing night , this method allows roughly twice the number of sco - cen targets to be observed . to use the closure phase quantity to search for companions , we follow the analysis outlined in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , briefly summarized here .",
    "the data are initially flatfielded , sky subtracted , aligned , and corrected for cosmic rays .",
    "the bispectrum , the complex triple product of visibilities defined by the three baselines formed from any three subapertures , is then calculated .",
    "the phase of this complex quantity is the closure phase .",
    "as discussed in @xcite and @xcite , the calibrated object closure - phase is found by subtracting a weighted average of the closure - phase for the calibrator stars .",
    "for the analysis in this paper , which is motivated by the search for point sources , the squared visibilities were not used as they were noisier than the closure - phases . each target",
    "was calibrated against all other stars to search for any deviations from single point - like sources .",
    "the root mean square ( rms ) calibrated closure - phase was found for each of these target - calibrator pairs , and all calibrations that resulted in an rms closure phase more than 1.5 times the minimum for each target over all calibrators were assigned a weight of zero . in practice , this meant that each target data set was calibrated by an average of the two or three calibrator data sets obtained closest in time .",
    "the lack of perfect closure phase calibration is still the dominant source of closure - phase noise in this analysis .",
    "in table[contrasttable ] we present the key properties of our newly detected companions , including the relative @xmath18-band contrast ratios , angular separations , position angles , absolute magnitudes for the detected companions , as well as confidence levels of each of the detected companions to these sco - cen baf stars . for masses less than 0.1@xmath2 , we convert these absolute magnitudes into physical masses for the dusty models @xcite corresponding to ages of 10 and 20 myr . for masses greater than 0.1@xmath2 ,",

    "also in the figure , we also show recent interferometric detections of companions with primarily stellar masses ( @xmath581@xmath2 ) taken from @xcite .",
    "in addition , the figure shows the directly imaged exoplanets orbiting the closer , young ( @xmath110 - 30 myr ) a - stars hr8799 , @xmath8pic , and hd95086b @xcite .",
    "our objects occupy a similar orbital range ( 10 to 30 au ) to these directly imaged exoplanets , but with larger masses . some works ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have suggested the peak of the companion distribution lies in this orbital range .",
    "three of our newly detected objects , hip73990b , hip73990c , and hip74865b , have mass ratios clearly below the hydrogen burning limit ( @xmath172@xmath59 ) , even assuming the older 20myr age .",
    "these are objects at 1030au that unambiguously occupy the so - called `` brown dwarf desert '' ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , an observationally determined dearth of brown dwarf objects traditionally categorized as having @xmath6@xmath380.1",
    ". any detection of objects in this mass range will be particularly important to inform theoretical and numerical models of multiple systems ( e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .    given the very small angular separations at which aperture masking interferometry performs ( @xmath380.25@xmath60 ) , the likelihood of contamination from background stars is negligible . for our survey ,",
    "the number of expected contaminants has been estimated based on the local surface density of stars in the vicinity of the targets in our sample .",
    "this density was estimated using both the 2mass survey and a star count algorithm that combines a spatial and luminosity model for the milky way ( for the thin / thick disk , halo , bulge and present - day mass function @xcite . nonetheless , to obtain the number of expected false detections in our broad survey of 140 stars , we extrapolate the false alarm rate from @xcite , which predicts 0.3 false detections for 60 sco - cen stars . with this rate in hand , for our survey of 140 stars",
    ", we would expect @xmath10.7 false detections .",
    "thus , the probability of identifying seven companions , as we have done in this work , would require a false alarm rate an order - of - magnitude greater than that of @xcite .",
    "such a circumstance is exceedingly unlikely , since the current study also focusses on the sco - cen region .",
    "thus , the conventional need to confirm common proper motion is much less urgent .",
    "nonetheless , we will continue to monitor these targets with the goal of fully characterizing the orbital motion of the companions , as well as establishing common proper motion with the host stars .    of the six stars targetted in this study",
    ", only hip 73990 has evidence for significant excess emission at 22@xmath55 m as measured by the nasa wise mission ( [ 3.6]-[22]@xmath55 m = 1.62 ) , suggesting the presence of a debris disk . at the same time",
    ", none of our six target stars have any statistically significant excess emission at 4.6@xmath55 m or 12@xmath55 m , which would suggest the presense of more optically thick , protoplanetary disks .",
    "hip73990 is also our only target with more than one detected companion .",
    "we devoted several additional post - processing tests to ensure the dual detections were not spurious ( e.g. optical `` ghosts '' in the field of view , a companion present around another mutual calibrator star , etc . ) . a thorough reprocessing of the data while varying the calibration scheme revealed",
    "that both detections were present irrespective of the number of mutual calibrators stars used .",
    "furthermore , the naco l27 camera and @xmath18-band filter have well characterized optical ghosts present in the focal plane",
    ". however , the position of these artifacts are fixed , and are easily excluded by a mask .",
    "nonetheless , as an additional check , we performed a data reduction using only those files with the interferograms in identical places on the focal plane .",
    "the detection of the companions were robust against these changes as well .",
    "lastly , we rule out the possibility that the closure phase signal could perhaps be caused by aliasing from a more distant source , since @xcite do not mention any detection of faint companions in their observations of this star using conventional ao imaging .",
    "in this work , we report the detection of seven companions to intermediate - mass stars of spectral types b , a , and f in the sco - cen association . with assumed ages of 10 - 20 myr , our newly detected objects are observed shortly after the epoch of formation , residing on orbital scales comparable to objects in our solar system ( @xmath110 - 30au ) .",

    "these three objects are all clearly below the hydrogen burning limit , even assuming an age of 20 myr .",
    "\\3 ) the infrared brightnesses presented here will further serve as luminosity measurements of very young objects against which evolutionary models can be compared , thereby constraining the initial entropy of forming low mass companions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "\\4 ) this study also begins to fill an important gap in our knowledge of the multiplicity of intermediate mass stars at young ages ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , but also to search for fainter companions at large separations using the latest generation of dedicated exoplanet imagers such as gpi and sphere",
    ". finally , as gaia parallaxes are derived for these objects , follow - up high resolution host star spectroscopy will be highly beneficial to better determine the host star physical properties , such as @xmath53 , @xmath62@xmath63 , and metallicity .",
