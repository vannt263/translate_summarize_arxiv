    "in quantum many - body systems , the number of degrees of freedom increases exponentially with the number of particles .",
    "this leads to difficulties for analysing their physics .",
    "one way to circumvent this difficulty is to assume random interactions , which are understood to be caused by inevitable impurities and disorder present in the physical system , and study typical properties of random many - body hamiltonians . this idea is developed in random matrix theory and provides a successful description of the complicated physics of heavy atoms , quantum chromodynamics , mesoscopic systems , quantum gravity , and quantum chaotic systems ( see e.g. ref .",
    "a study of random hamiltonians has recently been extended to quantum spin systems on a lattice  @xcite , where hamiltonians contain only local interactions and respect the local structure of the system .",
    "such random _ local _ hamiltonians were shown in refs .",
    "@xcite to have a distribution of eigenvalues different from that of random hamiltonians without local structure , which we call random _ global _ hamiltonians , implying that random local models are significantly distinct from global ones .",
    "the idea of randomisation was applied to a study of the typical properties of quantum states using the unitarily invariant ensemble of states , often called _",
    "random states_. it has been pointed out that random states play a basic role in the foundation of physics , from quantum statistical mechanics  @xcite to the black hole information paradox  @xcite . from the viewpoint of random hamiltonians ,",
    "random states are an ensemble of ground states of random global hamiltonians  @xcite , so that their properties are those typically observed in such _ global _ systems at _ zero _ temperature .",
    "it is then natural to ask whether they are still observed in systems with a _ local _ structure at _ finite _ temperature .",
    "in this letter , we extend a study of the unitarily invariant ensemble of states ( equivalently the ensemble of ground states of random global hamiltonians ) to the ensemble of thermal states of random global / local hamiltonians .",
    "we especially investigate the ensemble of thermal states in comparison with the unitarily invariant ensemble .",
    "to this end , we exploit the concept of a _ state @xmath0-design _ , an ensemble of states simulating , up to the order @xmath0 , statistical moments of random states  @xcite , and investigate whether or not a state @xmath0-design is approximately achievable in random global / local hamiltonian systems at finite temperature .",
    "this provides an insight into the validity of the foundation of physics using random states or a state @xmath0-design when the system respects a local structure and is at finite temperature .",
    "this also has importance in quantum information science since random states have a wide range of applications  @xcite , and their approximate generation is one of the central issues  @xcite .    for an ensemble of thermal states in random _ global _ hamiltonian systems ,",
    "we show that the ensemble monotonically approaches the unitarily invariant one with decreasing temperature and that a state @xmath0-design is approximately achieved at @xmath3 temperature .",
    "we then show that , for an ensemble of thermal states in random _ local _ hamiltonian systems , the ensemble is a state @xmath2-design at any temperature .",
    "we numerically study how close the ensemble is to higher designs and show that the ensemble quickly approaches the unitarily invariant one in a high - temperature regime , but converges to a non - uniform distribution at low temperature .",
    "we also give numerical evidence that these two regimes of the ensemble are separated by a singular point , indicating a phase transition of the ensemble at finite temperature .",
    "since the singularity is not observed for random _ global _ hamiltonians , this is an intrinsic characteristic of random _ local _ hamiltonians .",
    "let @xmath4 be a hilbert space of dimension @xmath5 .",
    "random states @xmath6 are an ensemble of pure states uniformly distributed in hilbert space with respect to the unitarily invariant measure .",
    "random states play a fundamental role in physics  @xcite , and are important resource in quantum information processing  @xcite , however , they can not be efficiently generated .",
    "hence , an ensemble of states , called an _ @xmath7-approximate state @xmath0-design _ @xmath8 has been studied  @xcite .",

    "since a state @xmath0-design converges to random states when @xmath22 , the distance between a given ensemble of states and a state @xmath0-design provides a measure of the uniformity of the ensemble .",
    "we define random hamiltonians using the gaussian unitary ensemble gue@xmath23 , which is an ensemble of @xmath24 hermitian matrices @xmath25 distributed according to the gaussian measure @xmath26 with density proportional to @xmath27 $ ]  @xcite .",
    "we call the gue the ensemble of _ random global hamiltonians _ since it has no local structures",
    ". an important feature of random global hamiltonians is that they are invariant under unitary conjugation , i.e. @xmath28 for any @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the unitary group of degree @xmath31 .",
    "hence , their ground states are random states .",
    "we also introduce the ensemble of _ random @xmath32-local hamiltonians _ : consider a system consisting of @xmath33 particles , where the dimension of each particle is @xmath34 .",
    "we denote by @xmath35 the corresponding hilbert space .",
    "a hamiltonian @xmath36 is called @xmath32-local if each term @xmath37 acts nontrivially on a set @xmath38 of at most @xmath32 particles .",
    "an ensemble of @xmath32-local hamiltonians @xmath39 is called _ random _ when each @xmath37 is independently chosen from @xmath40 .",
    "note that @xmath41=gue@xmath42 is the ensemble of random global hamiltonians .",
    "unlike random global hamiltonians , random @xmath32-local hamiltonians for @xmath43 do not have global unitary invariance and the ensemble of ground states differs from random states .    at finite temperature @xmath44",
    ", a state of a system at thermal equilibrium is given by a thermal state @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the inverse temperature and @xmath47 is the partition function .",
    "although a thermal state is in general not a pure state , we straightforwardly extend the definition of a @xmath0-design to a mixed state and define a distance between an ensemble of thermal states @xmath48 and a state @xmath0-design by @xmath49-\\mathbb{e}_{\\psi \\in \\upsilon } [ \\psi^{\\otimes t } ] \\|_1 $ ] .",
    "if an ensemble of thermal states satisfies @xmath50 for some @xmath51 , average properties of the system can be described by an @xmath7-approximate state @xmath0-design up to order @xmath0 .",

    "a possible interpretation of the distinctive temperature @xmath157 , combined with a fact that the expected density of states for the ensemble of random local hamiltonians is a gaussian  @xcite , is that the distribution of eigenstates with low energies intrinsically differs from those with intermediate energies . to explain this",

    "the @xmath178 point is understood as the point where this transition happens .",
    "the singularity of @xmath164 at @xmath178 then indicates that the distribution of intermediate eigenstates for @xmath179 is qualitatively different from that of low - energy eigenstates . since @xmath164 rapidly decrease with @xmath51 when @xmath158 , the distribution of intermediate eigenstates is likely to be similar to the unitarily invariant one .",
    "the situation is entirely different for the ensemble of random global hamiltonians , where no distinctive temperature is observed , for the following two reasons .",
    "first , there is no trade off between the density of states and the thermal population in @xmath172 since the density of states obeys the semi - circle law given by @xmath180  @xcite .",
    "this is negligible at any temperature compared to the thermal population that exponentially scales with @xmath38 .",
    "second , the ensemble of eigenstates of any eigenenergy is unitarily invariant , which is in sharp contrast to the distribution of eigenstates of random local hamiltonians .",
    "these results show that the distribution of thermal states in random @xmath32-local hamiltonian systems has a rich structure and is qualitatively different from that in global hamiltonian systems , even if @xmath181 .",
    "this is not only interesting from a theoretical point of view but also physically important since it means that most of the previously known results of random states , equivalently an ensemble of ground states in random global hamiltonian systems , related to physical situations  @xcite can not be directly applied to many - body systems with local interactions .",
    "in this letter we have investigated a distribution of thermal states in random global / local hamiltonian systems . for random global hamiltonians",
    ", we analytically showed that the ensemble of thermal states monotonically approaches the unitarily invariant one with decreasing temperature and achieves an @xmath7-approximate state @xmath0-design when the temperature is @xmath182 . on the other hand ,",
    "the ensemble of thermal states for random @xmath32-local hamiltonians achieves a state @xmath2-design but not higher designs .",
    "we then showed by studying a higher design that the ensemble is divided into two regimes of temperature , a regime where the ensemble quickly spreads toward the uniform one with decreasing temperature and a regime where the ensemble converges to a non - uniform one , which are likely to be separated by a singular point .",
    "these studies have revealed the similarities and the differences of random global / local hamiltonians from the viewpoint of the distribution of thermal states , and have opened a new approach to study random systems by connecting random matrix theory and quantum information science .",
    "it is desirable to analytically confirm the features numerically observed in this paper .",
    "proving the phase transition of the ensemble of thermal states is especially important .",
