    "since this paper is prepared for the proceedings of the nobel symposium on graphene we do not start with general explanations what graphene is and why it is important , it will be very well described in other presentations .",
    "we just refer to reviews @xcite .",
    "our particular subject is chiral , or klein ( as it was called in @xcite ) tunneling .",
    "this is one of the key phenomena determining peculiar electronic properties of graphene . in light of possible applications ,",
    "the klein tunneling protects high charge carrier mobility despite unavoidable inhomogeneities . at the same time , due to the klein tunneling graphene electronics can not copy the standard semiconductor one : if you make graphene transistor based on n - p - n junction just like for silicon , it will not be efficient since you will not be able to lock it .",
    "these two remarks illustrate the importance of the subject , the more detailed discussion is presented below .",
    "the paper consists of two pieces .",
    "the first one ( sections [ kleinparadox ]    [ kleinbi ] ) preserves the historical line of thoughts and presents the motivation of the problem , from @xcite to @xcite . in the second part ( sections [ sec::dimvar ]    [ sec : numerics ] ) we present a systematic semiclassical theory of the chiral tunneling , together with numerical results .",
    "soon after the discovery of the dirac equation , o. klein  @xcite noticed one of its strange properties which was afterwards called the `` klein paradox '' .",
    "klein considered the original four by four dirac equation , which governs the dynamics of a spin one half particle moving in three - dimensional space . to make a direct connection to the case of graphene without changing the essence of the paradox",
    ", we will consider a two by two matrix equation for a particle propagating in two - dimensional space : @xmath0 where @xmath1 and the hamiltonian @xmath2 here @xmath3 is the mass of the particle , @xmath4 is the speed of light and @xmath5 is the potential energy .    to demonstrate the essence of the paradox we consider normal incidence on a one - dimensional potential barrier , which means that @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "then equation  ( [ eq : statschrod ] ) takes the form @xmath8 to make the problem exactly solvable we use a step - wise potential @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a positive constant .",
    "we consider a general scattering problem with an incoming wave @xmath11 and a reflected wave @xmath12 for @xmath13 , @xmath14 and a transmitted wave @xmath15 for @xmath16 , @xmath17    the @xmath18-dependence of the solutions for @xmath13 can be written as @xmath19 , where the wave vector @xmath20 satisfies the relativistic dispersion relation @xmath21 as can be found by diagonalizing equation  ( [ eq : twoddirac ] ) with @xmath22 .",
    "alternatively the wave vector can be written as @xmath23 one easily sees that there are three distinct regimes , two of which are classically allowed , namely @xmath24 corresponding to electron states and @xmath25 corresponding to hole or positron states .",
    "there is also a classically forbidden region @xmath26 where the wave vector @xmath20 is imaginary and we have evanescent waves .",
    "in what follows we will assume that we are in the electron regime . by calculating eigenvectors of equation  ( [ eq : twoddirac ] )",
    "one obtains for the wavefunctions to the left of the barrier @xmath27 and @xmath28 where @xmath29    to the right of the barrier we have a new wave vector @xmath30 , which satisfies the relativistic dispersion relation @xmath31 , or @xmath32 consider a jump @xmath33 since in this case the paradox arises .",
    "the wave vector @xmath30 is real and we have a propagating wave on the right side of the barrier .",
    "note however that this particle belongs to the hole continuum rather than to the electron one . for smaller values of @xmath10 , there are either propagating electrons on both the left and the right side of the barrier , when @xmath34 , or evanescent waves on the right side of the barrier , when @xmath35 . solving the dirac equation  ( [ eq : twoddirac ] ) on the right side of the barrier , one obtains for the transmitted wave @xmath36 where @xmath37    from the continuity of the wavefunction at @xmath38 , @xmath39 we find @xmath40 for the considered case we have @xmath41 , so that @xmath42 and @xmath43 to treat reflection and transmission coefficients properly one has to look at the probability current density for the one - dimensional dirac equation @xmath44 which is a conserved quantity .",
    "when we look at the current density  ( [ eq : currdensity ] ) we see that it takes values @xmath45 for the incoming wave and @xmath46 for the reflected wave .",
    "therefore @xmath47 is nothing but the reflection coefficient and we come to the conclusion that the amplitude of the reflected wave is larger than the amplitude of the incident one .",
    "this strange effect that occurs when condition  ( [ eq : kleinhighpot ] ) is fulfilled was initially called the klein paradox . in our further discussion",
    "we will follow  @xcite and  @xcite . for a rather complete list of references see  @xcite .    first of all note that the current density  ( [ eq : currdensity ] ) on the right hand side equals @xmath48 , indicating that there is something wrong with the definition of the transmitted wave .",
    "what exactly is wrong was pointed out by pauli , who noticed that the group velocity for the case of equation  ( [ eq : kleinhighpot ] ) , @xmath49 is opposite to the direction of the wave vector @xmath30 .",
    "since the group velocity determines the direction of propagation , the transmitted wave  ( [ eq : kleintransmitted ] ) corresponds ( for positive @xmath30 ) to a particle moving to the left instead of to the right .",
    "therefore we should define our outgoing wave as @xmath50 which gives the currenty density @xmath51 .",
    "when we once again calculate @xmath52 from equation  ( [ eq : continuity ] ) , it is seen that @xmath53 which is always smaller than one .",
    "therefore the formal paradox disappears , see also  @xcite .",
    "the paradox reappears when we consider the problem from a different angle . instead of an infinitely broad barrier",
    "we will consider a finite barrier , @xmath54 the problem with the choice of the transmitted wave on the right side of the barrier has now disappeared , since it is simply @xmath55 . within",
    "the barrier one now has to consider both modes @xmath56 , representing the most general solution .",
    "reflection and transmission coefficients are then obtained from the continuity of the wave function at @xmath57 and @xmath58 , which gives after straightforward calculations ( see e.g.  @xcite and  @xcite ) @xmath59 there is no paradox in these expressions , since @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 as it should be . note that we have total transmission through the barrier when @xmath63 with integer @xmath64 .",
    "we can consider an infinitely broad barrier by letting @xmath65 go to infinity in the above expressions .",
    "as @xmath65 becomes very large while other parameters remain fixed the sine will oscillate very rapidly .",
    "we can then average over the fast oscillations and replace @xmath66 by its average value @xmath67 to obtain the expressions @xmath68 one may be surprised that the results  ( [ eq : kleinreflected ] ) and  ( [ eq : kleinreflected2 ] ) do not coincide .",
    "it is however well known from electromagnetic wave theory  @xcite that the reflection coefficients for the two situations should differ .    from the last result",
    "we see once again that the paradox has disappeared in its mathematical form , but has reappeared as physically counterintuitive behaviour . in non - relativistic quantum mechanics",
    "a particle can tunnel through a classically forbidden region @xmath69 , but the probability is exponentially small when the barrier is high and broad . in the semiclassical approximation the transmission through the barrier with turning points @xmath70 , which satisfy @xmath71 ,",
    "is given by @xmath72 where @xmath3 is the mass of the particle .",
    "for a relativistic particle incident on a sufficiently high barrier  ( [ eq : kleinhighpot ] ) the situation is dramatically different . in the limit",
    "@xmath73 the probability of penetration  ( [ eq : kleintransmitted2 ] ) is in general not small at all .",
    "even for an infinitely high barrier ( @xmath74 ) one has @xmath75 and @xmath76 this is of the order of one when @xmath77 is of the order of @xmath78 , while it is approximately equal to one in the ultrarelativistic limit @xmath79 this is the contemporary formulation of the klein paradox  @xcite ; quantum relativistic particles can tunnel with large enough probabilities through barriers of arbitrarily large height and width .",
    "the tunneling effect can be hand - wavingly explained with the help of the heisenberg uncertainty principle . since one can not know both momentum and position with an arbitrary accuracy at a given instant , one can not separate the total energy into a potential and a kinetic part .",
    "so the kinetic energy can be `` a bit '' negative . in the relativistic regime",
    "the restriction is much stronger  @xcite : one can not even know the coordinate with an accuracy higher than @xmath80",
    ". therefore relativistic quantum mechanics can not be mechanics , but can only be field theory  @xcite .",
    "this theory will always contain particles and antiparticles and to measure the coordinate better than @xmath81 one needs to apply such a high energy that particle - antiparticle pairs will be created .",
    "the original particle whose coordinate one wanted to measure will then be lost among the newly - born particles .",
    "a full field theoretic treatment of the problem was given in ref .",
    "the most important point is that although the problem of a high enough barrier looks like a static problem , this is actually not the case .",
    "one needs to study carefully how the state is reached and this involves positron emission by the growing barrier . for a more detailed discussion of the role of electron - positron pairs in the klein paradox , see  @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian for charge carriers in graphene near conical points @xmath82 and @xmath83 is given by the massless dirac hamiltonian @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the fermi velocity @xmath86 . to consider normal incidence on the one - dimensional potential barrier  ( [ eq : potentialbarrier ] ) in this case , we can simply put @xmath87 in our previous results . from equations  ( [ eq :",
    "defalpha ] ) and  ( [ eq : defbeta ] ) it is seen that @xmath88 .",
    "therefore we have @xmath89 and @xmath90 in equations  ( [ eq : kleinreflected2 ] ) and  ( [ eq : kleintransmitted2 ] ) , regardless of the height of the potential . this result",
    "is not related to the specific shape of the potential  @xcite .",
    "this property has an analog in two and three dimensions with @xmath91 or @xmath92 , namely that backscattering is forbidden .",
    "this was found long ago for scattering of ultrarelativistic particles in three dimensions ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "an important consequence of this property for carbon materials was noticed in  @xcite .",
    "absence of backscattering explains the existence of conducting channels in metallic carbon nanotubes , while in a non - relativistic one - dimensional system an arbitrarily small disorder leads to localization  @xcite .",
    "the consideration in  @xcite is very instructive since it explicitly shows the role of the berry phase and time - reversal symmetry , but it is also quite cumbersome .",
    "here we present a somewhat simplified scheme of this proof . to this aim",
    "we consider the equation for the @xmath93-matrix ( see e.g.  @xcite ) @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the operator corresponding to the scattering potential , @xmath96 is the green s function of the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath97 and @xmath98 is the electron energy , which is assumed to be larger than zero .",
    "if @xmath97 is the dirac hamiltonian for massless dirac fermions  ( [ eq : graphenehamiltonian ] ) , we have @xmath99\\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath100 with @xmath101 . the probability of backscattering can be found by iterating equation  ( [ eq : deftmatrix ] ) and is proportional to @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the contribution proportional to @xmath104 .",
    "we can always choose axes such that @xmath105 .",
    "in this case @xmath106 and @xmath107 have spinor structures @xmath108 and @xmath109 respectively . therefore",
    ", if @xmath110 is the two by two matrix @xmath111 one has @xmath112 now keeping in mind that @xmath85 is proportional to the identity matrix one can prove term by term that all contributions to @xmath113 and @xmath114 vanish by symmetry .",
    "actually this is because @xmath115 ; from the vectors @xmath116 and @xmath117 one can not construct anything with nonzero @xmath118 or @xmath119 components . strictly speaking",
    "this argument is only enough for an isotropic potential ; for a generic case one has to do a term by term analysis based on expansion  ( [ eq : tmatrixexpansion ] ) , see ref .",
    "@xcite . for two nonparallel vectors",
    "@xmath120 and @xmath121 one can construct a matrix with nonzero @xmath118 or @xmath119 components , since one of the vectors has a nonzero @xmath118 component , so that @xmath122 .",
    "when one thinks about electrons in quantum electrodynamics , it is not easy to create potential jumps larger than @xmath123 mev .",
    "similar phenomena take place in electric or gravitational fields ( @xcite ; see  @xcite for a detailed list of references ) , but the context is always quite exotic , such as collisions of ultraheavy ions or even black hole evaporation .",
    "there were no experimental data available which would require the klein paradox for their explanation .",
    "however shortly after the discovery of graphene it was realized that klein tunneling is one of the crucial phenomena for graphene physics and electronics  @xcite .",
    "soon after this theoretial prediction the effect was confirmed experimentally @xcite .",
    "considering possible applications , klein tunneling in graphene is rather bad news .",
    "if one copied the construction from a silicon transistor to graphene , it would be impossible to lock the transistor .",
    "one would need to open a gap in the spectrum to be able to lock it . at the same time it is good news as well : due to the klein paradox inhomogeneities in the electron density do not lead to localization and their effect on the electron mobility is not very essential  @xcite .",
    "let us now consider a massless dirac fermion incident on the potential barrier  ( [ eq : potentialbarrier ] ) with positive energy under an angle @xmath124 , as it was done first in  @xcite .",
    "of course , the potential can not be sharp on the atomic scale , since this would induce umklapp scattering between different valleys .",
    "therefore by a step - wise potential we mean that the electron wavelength @xmath125 is much larger than the typical spatial scale of the potential @xmath126 , which is in turn much larger than the size of the unit cell .    within this assumption",
    "the solution is each region is given by traveling waves proportional to @xmath127 , where @xmath128 and @xmath129 satisfy the dispersion relation @xmath130 as can be found from equation  ( [ eq : graphenehamiltonian ] ) .",
    "similarly to the original dirac equation we can distinguish three distinct regimes from this equation .",
    "for @xmath131 we have electrons and for @xmath132 we have holes , while the region @xmath133 is classically forbidden .",
    "as was done for the case of the massive dirac equation , we will now require that the potential @xmath10 in equation  ( [ eq : potentialbarrier ] ) satisfies @xmath134 so that we have hole states within the barrier .",
    "let us denote by @xmath20 the wave vector for @xmath135 and by @xmath30 the wave vector for @xmath136 .",
    "at the potential jump the momentum in the @xmath118 direction should be conserved , so that the new angle @xmath137 is related to the new wave vector @xmath30 by @xmath138 from equation  ( [ eq : graphenehamiltonian ] ) we see that the second component of the wavefunction is related to the first by @xmath139 so the solutions in the three regions are given by @xmath140 where we have introduced @xmath141 , @xmath142 , @xmath143 and @xmath144 .",
    "note that the reflected particle moves under the angle @xmath145 , assuming that the angle changes from @xmath146 to @xmath147 , so that we have the phase @xmath148 for the reflected wave .",
    "we can now determine the reflection coefficient @xmath52 , the transmission coefficient @xmath149 and the coefficients @xmath150 and @xmath151 as before , from the requirement that the wavefunction is continuous at @xmath152 .",
    "finally the result is given by @xmath153 - 2 i \\sin(2 q_x a ) } \\ ; .",
    "\\label{eq : graphenereflectionbarrier}\\ ] ] for the case under consideration we have @xmath154 , since the signs of @xmath98 and @xmath155 are opposite .",
    "the transmission probability can now easily be calculated as @xmath156 from equation  ( [ eq : graphenereflectionbarrier ] ) we immediately see that the reflection is zero for normal incidence , as we proved for a more general potential in the previous section .",
    "there are also additional angles , called `` magic angles '' , at which the reflection coefficient is zero and we have full transmission .",
    "they are given by the condition @xmath157 where @xmath64 is an integer .",
    "we can compare the behaviour of electrons in single layer graphene with the behaviour of normal electrons .",
    "when the potential barrier contains no electronic states , the transmission decays exponentially with increasing barrier width and height ,  @xcite , so that the barrier would reflect electrons completely .",
    "but since single layer graphene is gapless , it seems more appropriate to compare it to a gapless semiconductor with non - chiral charge carriers , a situation which can be realized in certain heterostructures  @xcite . for this case",
    "we find @xmath158 where @xmath128 and @xmath159 are the @xmath18-components of the wave vector outside and inside the barrier , respectively . as in the case of single layer graphene",
    "there are resonance conditions at which the barrier is transparent , given by @xmath160 , where @xmath64 is an integer .",
    "for normal incidence we see that the transmission coefficient is an oscillating function of the tunneling parameters and can exhibit any value between zero and one .",
    "this is in contrast to single layer graphene , where the transmission is always perfect .",
    "bilayer graphene consists of two layers of graphene on top of each other , the second layer being rotated by 120 degrees with respect to the first one . in this configuration",
    "the sublattices @xmath150 lie exactly on top of each other and the hopping parameter @xmath161 between them is approximately 0.4 ev  @xcite , while the in - plane hopping parameter @xmath162 is approximately an order of magnitude larger .",
    "when we consider only low energy excitations , @xmath163 , the effective hamiltonian is given by  @xcite @xmath164 where the effective mass @xmath165 , @xmath166 being the free electron mass  @xcite .",
    "there is also hopping between the @xmath151 sublattices of both layers , which is denoted by @xmath167 ev .",
    "when we include this parameter into the description an extra term is added to the hamiltonian , which corresponds to so - called trigonal warping .",
    "this effect is however only important for small wave vectors  @xcite , we will exclude it assuming that @xmath168 .",
    "let us consider an electron incident on the potential step  ( [ eq : potentialbarrier ] ) under an angle @xmath124 , as was done in  @xcite .",
    "since the potential is constant in the @xmath118-direction we can write the solution as @xmath169 inserting this into equation  ( [ eq : statschrod ] ) with the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : bilayergraphenehamiltonian ] ) , we obtain @xmath170 the solutions are therefore given by propagating waves @xmath171 and exponentially growing and decaying modes @xmath172 , @xmath173 the presence of evanescent modes is markedly different from both the schrdinger case and the dirac case .",
    "once again there are three regimes .",
    "there are electron states for @xmath174 and hole states for @xmath175 , while the region in between is classically forbidden . in what follows",
    "we assume that @xmath10 in equation  ( [ eq : potentialbarrier ] ) satisfies @xmath176 to find the spinors that are the solutions to equation  ( [ eq : bilayercstreduced ] ) we note that the components are related by @xmath177 as can be seen from the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : bilayergraphenehamiltonian ] ) .",
    "now let @xmath178 be the wave vector for the propagating modes in the region @xmath135 , while @xmath179 is the wave vector in the region @xmath136 .",
    "then the solution for @xmath180 is given by @xmath181 where @xmath182 , @xmath183 , @xmath184 , @xmath185 and finally @xmath186 .",
    "the amplitude @xmath187 is the amplitude for the incoming wave in this expression , while @xmath188 corresponds to the reflected wave .",
    "for @xmath189 we have the general solution @xmath190 where @xmath191 is the transmission coefficient . inside the barrier",
    "we need the most general solution with two propagating modes and two modes with real exponentials , @xmath192 where @xmath193 because the transverse momentum is conserved .",
    "furthermore @xmath144 , @xmath194 , @xmath195 and @xmath196 .",
    "now the coefficients @xmath197 , @xmath198 , @xmath199 and @xmath200 have to be found from the continuity of @xmath201 and the derivative @xmath202 at the points @xmath152 .",
    "when the problem is solved numerically , one sees that the transmission probability at normal incidence is exponentially small .",
    "similar to the case of single layer graphene , there are once again `` magic angles '' in the spectrum , at which there is total transmission .",
    "the existence of magic angles in bilayer graphene has the same consequences as in single layer graphene , meaning that we can not lock a conventional transistor made from bilayer graphene .    for the case of normal incidence @xmath203 we can also solve the problem analytically .",
    "the transmission coefficient is given by @xmath204 which is indeed exponentially small .",
    "when we let @xmath65 go to infinity , the transmission probability @xmath205 becomes zero at normal incidence .",
    "furthermore for a single n - p junction with @xmath206 the following analytical solution can be found for any @xmath124 @xmath207 which also gives @xmath208 at normal incidence , in contrast to the case of single layer graphene , where normally incident electrons are always transmitted .",
    "it is also different from the case of normal electrons , where the transmission is given by equation  ( [ eq : normalelectrontransmission ] ) .",
    "in sections [ sec::kleinsingle ] , [ kleinbi ] it was discussed that the wavefunctions @xmath209 of charge carriers in single layer and bilayer graphene in a one - dimensional geometry obey equations @xmath210\\psi=0 , \\label{eq::single - dim}\\ ] ] and @xmath211\\psi=0 , \\label{eq::bi - dim}\\ ] ] respectively . here @xmath126 is a characteristic scale of a potential change . in dimensionless variables ( [ eq::single - dim ] ) takes the form @xmath212\\psi=0 , \\label{eq::single - dimless}\\ ] ] where @xmath213 , @xmath214 , @xmath215 , @xmath216 , @xmath217 and @xmath218 .",
    "we denote some characteristic value of @xmath219 as @xmath220 .",
    "analogously , ( [ eq::bi - dim ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath221\\psi=0 , \\label{eq::bi - dimless}\\ ] ] with @xmath213 , @xmath214 , @xmath215 , @xmath216 , @xmath222 and @xmath223 .",
    "we denote some characteristic value of @xmath219 as @xmath224 .",
    "thus we can introduce dimensionless hamiltonians ( we omitted tildes ) : @xmath225 for a single layer and @xmath226 for a bilayer . in both cases",
    "there are two substantial parameters in the problem : @xmath227 and @xmath228 .",
    "charge carriers in single layer graphene are described by the hamiltonian ( [ eq::single - dimless2 ] ) .",
    "this hamiltonian describes simultaneously coupled electron and hole states . according to [ app::ad - ham ] , in adiabatic approximation ( [ eq::single - dimless2 ] )",
    "can be diagonalized up to any order of @xmath229 .",
    "the obtained scalar hamiltonians describe electrons and holes separately .",
    "the diagonalization is based on a series of unitary transformations of the original hamiltonian and traces back to the ideas of the foldy - wouthuysen transformation @xcite and the peierls substitution in blount s treatment @xcite .",
    "we use its variant @xcite .",
    "effective electron and hole hamiltonians @xmath230 and @xmath231 can be written as series with respect to the small parameter @xmath227 : @xmath232 to be precise we will assume that any function of @xmath233 and @xmath18 is defined in such a way that @xmath233 acts the first .",
