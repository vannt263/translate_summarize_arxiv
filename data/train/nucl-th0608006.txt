    "the impact parameter dependence of heavy ion @xmath0 pair production to all orders in @xmath1 is of direct relevance to experiments carried out at the bnl relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) and possible at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) . in the usual method of scattering theory , the impact parameter is formally integrated over to turn the momentum transfer of the amplitude into that of the cross section via a delta function@xcite .",
    "however a standard method of triggering measured events at rhic and lhc is with zero degree calorimeters , devices that respond to neutrons from coulomb dissociation of the beam ions@xcite .",
    "the physical process of a measured pair production event then also includes simultaneously the coulomb dissociation of the ion nucleus . assuming independence of the two processes ( pair production and coulomb dissociation ) the probability of an event is then the product of the probability of pair production times the probability of coulomb dissociation .",
    "predicted cross sections are then appropriately constructed from the integral of the product of the pair production probability times the dissociation probability .",
    "i will confine myself in this paper to evaluation of the impact parameter dependent probability for heavy ion production of @xmath0 pairs . combining the probability of the particular @xmath0 phase space acceptance of physical detectors with probability of coulomb dissociation",
    "will be left for future treatment .",
    "the impact parameter dependent calculation of heavy ion @xmath0 pair production to all orders in @xmath1 described in this paper is based on techniques previously developed . that development began with the realization that in an appropriate gauge@xcite ,",
    "the electromagnetic field of a relativistic heavy ion is to a very good approximation a delta function in the direction of motion of the heavy ion times the two dimensional solution of maxwell s equations in the transverse direction@xcite , and that an exact solution of the appropriate dirac equation could be obtained for excitation of bound - electron positron pairs exhibiting a reduction from perturbation theory of a little less than 10% for au + au at rhic @xcite .",
    "an analytical solution of the dirac equation was subsequently obtained@xcite for the analogous case of continuum @xmath0 pair production induced by the corresponding countermoving delta function potentials produced by heavy ions in an ultrarelativistic collider such as rhic .",
    "it was noted at the time@xcite that the exact solution appeared to agree with the perturbation theory result .",
    "several authors then argued @xcite that a correct regularization of the exact dirac equation amplitude should lead to a reduction of the total cross section for pair production from perturbation theory , the so called coulomb corrections .",
    "the first analysis was done in a weizsacker - williams approximation@xcite .",
    "subsequently , lee and milstein computed@xcite the total cross section for @xmath0 pairs using approximations to the exact amplitude that led to a higher order correction to the well known landau - lifshitz expression@xcite .",
    "one might also have noted that it is well known that photoproduction of @xmath0 pairs on a heavy target shows a negative ( coulomb ) correction proportional to @xmath3 that is well described by the bethe - maximon theory@xcite .",
    "in fact some years ago bertulanni and baur@xcite applied the structure of the bethe - maximon theory to obtain an impact dependent probability for heavy ion reactions with a negative coulomb correction .",
    "i will comment on their results and compare them with the results of the present work in section v.    in a previous paper i have tried to explicate the lee and milstein approximate results and argued their qualitative correctness@xcite .",
    "subsequently i undertook the full numerical calculation of electromagnetically induced ultrarelativistic heavy ion electron - positron pair production@xcite .",
    "that evaluation of the `` exact '' semi - classical total cross section for @xmath0 production with gold or lead ions showed reductions from perturbation theory of 28% for the cern super proton synchrotron ( sps ) case , 17% for rhic , and 11% for lhc .",
    "for large z no final momentum region was found in which there was no reduction or an insignificant reduction of the exact cross section from the perturbative cross section .    in the present paper",
    "i reformulate the approach used for my previous cross section calculations in order to calculate corresponding impact parameter dependent probabilities .",

    "although the usual method of evaluation , e.g. in perturbation theory , is via monte carlo , i have chosen to do the multi dimensional integral directly on meshes uniform on a logarithmic scale in each radial momentum dimension and on a logarithmic scale in impact parameter .",
    "it was computationally tedious but possible to carry out the calculations to some rough but significant accuracy without using monte carlo because the integrands are very smooth and smoothly goes to zero at both high end and low end of the momentum ranges and impact parameter range .",
    "apart from the fact that impact parameter dependence adds two more dimensions to calculations ( the magnitude of @xmath29 and the angle of the outgoing pair relative to @xmath29 ) , evaluation of the square of the pair production amplitude , eq .",

    "figure 4 shows the comparison of cross section contributions derived from the present calculations with those derived from the @xmath29 dependent probabilities of hencken , trautmann , and baur .",
    "the logarithmic derivative was chosen so that contributions to the integrated cross section go as the area under the curves on this natural log scale plot .",
    "no form factor was utilized in either calculation as its effect should be small for total cross section probabilities at these impact parameters .",
    "agreement is reasonably good , considering the large grids used in the present calculations .",
    "note that that for both sets of calculations the eikonal solution is less that perturbation theory for low impact parameters , and then crosses over to be greater than perturbation theory at about @xmath108 fm and larger .",
    "for small impact parameters there is fair agreement , but there is an incipient divergence between the curves for the present calculations and those of hencken , trautmann , and baur where the latter cut off .",
    "however , one of the authors had warned me not to trust their results far out in b too much because the fourier transform used was not as good there@xcite .    in figure 5",
    "one can observe the comparison of the exact calculation with perturbation theory and the eikonal .",
    "for all impact parameters the probability of pair production is smaller in the exact calculation than it is in perturbation theory .",
    "the small impact parameter agreement between the exact calculation and the eikonal extends the mechanism discussed in the @xmath38 case , the reduction from pertubation theory due to the similar rotating phase of @xmath109 for dominant large values of @xmath110 seen in fig .",

    ", a significant contribution comes in the region @xmath111 where the magnitude of @xmath23 is reduced from perturbation theory and the eikonal .",
    "this demonstrates how a correct physical cutoff process preserved the coulomb corrections at high @xmath29 and thus leads to coulomb corrections in the total cross section .",
    "the calculations can be integrated over impact parameter to compare with my previous calculations@xcite done not in the impact parameter representation . that the present integrated perturbation theory calculation of 34.6 kbn ( kilobarns ) is in such good agreement with my previous calculation of 34.6 kbn",
    "must be considered fortuitous , given the relatively crude nature of the impact parameter calculation .",
    "the present integrated exact calculation of 29.4 kbn is in fair agreement with my previous 28.6 kbn .",
    "the integrated eikonal calculation of 35.5 kbn should in principle be identical to the 34.6 kbn perturbation theory calculation , but like the present exact calculation is slightly larger than my previous published non impact parameter calculation .    at this point",
    "it is interesting to also compare the present results with two previous approximate analytical expressions for impact parameter dependence . in their classic physics reports article ,",
    "bertulani and baur@xcite presented an impact parameter formula that included a coulomb correction .",
    "figure 6 shows a comparison of the cross section contribution derived from their probability formula with the present results .",
    "bertulani and baur integrated over their stated range of validity , from @xmath112 to @xmath113 , to obtain a landau - lifshitz perturbative result with a coulomb correction . for symmetric heavy ions , the coulomb correction that they obtained was of the same form as the result later obtained by serbo et al.@xcite and by lee and milstein@xcite",
    "however , since bertulani and baur had postulated averaging the result of a coulomb correction for the target with one for the projectile , they obtained half of the more correct later result based on adding the lowest order coulomb correction for both target and projectile .",
    "the overall shapes of the bertulani and baur results differ from the present results , but their coulomb correction reduces the probability throughout the impact parameter range .    shortly after obtaining their above mentioned coulomb correction results for the total cross section@xcite lee , milstein , and serbo presented an analytical form for the the impact parameter dependence@xcite that differed substantially from that of bertulani and baur , especially in the intermediate range from @xmath112 to @xmath114 .",

    "the shape of the curve seems qualitatively more in agreement with present results . as in the case of bertulani and baur ,",
    "the treatment is considered valid for values of impact parameter larger than @xmath112 ( 386 fm ) , and in both cases integration of the contribution from their expression is in agreement with the leading @xmath115 term of landau and lifshitz@xcite .",
