    "quantum field theories with a nontrivial boundary have received recently a lot of attention , due to their applications in condensed matter , solid state physics and string theory ( d - branes ) .",
    "a problem of great interest is the renormalization group flow between different boundary fixed points of a cft that remains conformal in the bulk .",
    "many interesting results have been achieved , and flows have been studied for minimal models of virasoro algebra and for @xmath6 cft ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "numerical scaling functions for the flow of states interpolating two different boundary conditions can be systematically explored by use of the truncated conformal space approach @xcite .",
    "a beta function can be defined for the boundary deformations , much the same as for the bulk perturbations of conformal field theories @xcite .",
    "the conformal boundary conditions can thus play the role of ultraviolet ( uv ) and infrared ( ir ) points of the flow .",
    "one gets out of the uv point by perturbing with a relevant boundary operator and gets into an ir one attracted by irrelevant boundary operators .    among the possible boundary perturbations of a cft",
    "there are some that keep an infinite number of conservation laws .",
    "these are referred to as _",
    "integrable _ boundary perturbations . in this particular case experience suggest that there should be some exact method of investigation , based on transfer matrix and bethe ansatz techniques .",
    "one of the most celebrated of these methods is the thermodynamic bethe ansatz ( tba ) @xcite giving a set of non - linear coupled integral equations governing the scaling functions along the rg flow . in the following we",
    "illustrate how one can obtain tba equations from a lattice construction for the integrable boundary flows .    the simplest nontrivial example to consider is the second model in the virasoro minimal series , the tricritical ising model ( tim ) with central charge @xmath7 .",
    "it has interesting applications in solid state physics and statistical physics .",
    "its kac table is given here below :        we have drawn only half of the table , by taking into account the well known @xmath8 symmetry @xmath9 that reduces the independent chiral primaries to 6 in the tim .",
    "conformal boundary conditions for minimal models with diagonal modular invariant partition function of type @xmath10 are classified to be in one to one correspondence with chiral primary fields in the kac table .",
    "so there are 6 different conformal boundary conditions @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 for the tim @xmath14 .",
    "let us consider in the two - dimensional plane @xmath15 the tim defined on a strip of thickness @xmath16 , i.e in the region @xmath17 and @xmath18 , with non - trivial b.c .",
    "@xmath11 on the left ( @xmath19 ) and @xmath20 on the right ( @xmath21 ) edge respectively .",
    "this situation will be denoted @xmath22 . in the following we are interested in boundaries of type @xmath23 .",
    "we shall denote for short @xmath24 .",
    "for this particular class of boundary conditions the partition function simply reduces to one single character @xcite",
    "@xmath25 where @xmath26 denotes the character of the irreducible virasoro representation labeled by @xmath27 at central charge @xmath7 .    for each given boundary condition",
    "@xmath28 there is a set of boundary operators @xmath29 that live on the edge . if we want to keep the b.c .",
    "unchanged all along the edge , these operators must be restricted to the conformal families appearing in the ope fusion of the virasoro family @xmath27 with itself : @xmath30 .",
    "they are distinguished in terms of their conformal dimensions @xmath31 as relevant ( @xmath32 ) and irrelevant ( @xmath33 ) . of",
    "course only relevant perturbations break scale invariance at the boundary in such a way to get out of the fixed boundary point of a specific boundary condition and flow to another one .",
    "so if we want to consider possible relevant boundary perturbations of the tim , i.e. qft s described by the action@xmath34  where @xmath35 denotes the action of tim with boundary condition @xmath28  we have to restrict to the following possibilities    [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     actually there are two physically different flows for each `` pure '' perturbation ( i.e. containing only one operator @xmath36 or @xmath37 ) , flowing to two possibly different ir destinies .",
    "this is achieved by taking different signs in the coupling constant in the case of @xmath37 flows , and real or purely imaginary coupling constant in case of @xmath36 ones .",
    "the boundary condition @xmath38 can be perturbed by any linear combination of the fields @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the symbols @xmath41 represent other ways to denote the tim conformal boundary conditions present in the literature @xcite , and we report them here only to facilitate translations to the reader .    along the flow , going from uv to ir , the boundary entropy associated to each @xmath28@xmath42 decreases @xcite .",
    "therefore we expect to have flows only between boundary conditions where the starting conformal boundary entropy is higher than the final one .",
    "the possible conformal boundary conditions have been studied extensively by chim @xcite and the flows connecting them by affleck @xcite .",
    "the picture can be summarized as in fig .",
    "[ fig - flows ] .",
    "integrability can be investigated in a manner similar to the bulk perturbations and it turns out that the flows generated by pure @xmath40 and @xmath39 perturbations are integrable . instead , the flow starting at @xmath43 as a perturbation which is a linear combination of @xmath39 and @xmath40 is strongly suspected to be non - integrable .",

    "notice the @xmath8 symmetry of fig .",
    "[ fig - flows ] , which is strictly related to the supersymmetry of the tim .",
    "investigation of the supersymmetric aspects of the tim boundary flows is , however , out of the scope of the present talk .",
    "we deduce tba equations for the integrable flows from the functional relations for the transfer matrix of a lattice rsos realization of the model .",
    "we will focus , as an example , on the flow obtained by perturbing the @xmath44 boundary tim by the relevant boundary operator @xmath45@xmath46 this flow induces a map between virasoro characters @xmath47 of the theory , where @xmath48 is the modular parameter .",
    "the physical direction of the flow from the ultraviolet ( uv ) to the infrared ( ir ) is given by the relevant perturbations and is consistent with the @xmath49-theorem  @xcite .",
    "the approach outlined here , however , is quite general and should apply , for example , to all integrable boundary flows of minimal models .",
    "it is well known that the tim is obtained as the continuum scaling limit of the generalized hard square model of baxter  @xcite on the regime  iii / iv critical line , _ i.e. _ the @xmath0 rsos integrable lattice model of andrews - baxter - forrester  @xcite , with critical boltzmann weights    satisfying the yang - baxter equation .",
    "the indices @xmath50 take values on the @xmath0 dynkin diagrams , whose adjacency dictates which are the nonzero elements of the boltzmann weights .    in the presence of integrable boundaries , one must also introduce the so called boundary boltzmann weights , satisfying the boundary yang - baxter equations . their general form has been given in @xcite , for our purposes here we select    and    all these boltzmann weights are periodic under @xmath51 .",
    "the scaling energies of the tim are obtained  @xcite from the scaling limit of the eigenvalues of the commuting double - row transfer matrices @xmath52  @xcite        of the @xmath0 lattice model with @xmath53 faces in a row .",
    "integrability means @xmath54=0 $ ] , @xmath55 .",

    "the matrix @xmath59 satisfies the property@xmath60 where the matrix @xmath61 is the incidence matrix of the @xmath0 dynkin diagram . here",
    "the notation @xmath62 means the sub - matrix of @xmath63 for fixed @xmath64 boundary spins .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the _ normalized _ double row transfer matrix @xmath65 that satisfies the following functional equation:@xmath66    for the interested reader , the expression for the normalization factor @xmath67 is given in @xcite .",
    "even if the equation for @xmath68 looks boundary independent , the solutions are fixed by the behavior of the zeros , that are boundary dependent .",
    "the transfer matrix @xmath59 is entire and has only zeros ; @xmath69 has instead two complex conjugate poles ( coming from @xmath67 ) in the strip @xmath70 .",
    "we shall see that they will affect the boundary driving term in the tba equations we are going to deduce .    in a lattice of @xmath53 horizontal and @xmath71 vertical sites , with periodic boundary conditions on the vertical direction and @xmath64 boundary conditions on the horizontal one",
    ", the partition function of the tricritical hard square model can be written as@xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 are the bulk and surface contributions to the free energy respectively .",
    "@xmath75 is the universal conformal partition function , with modular parameter@xmath76 therefore the behavior of each transfer matrix eigenvalue is @xmath77 with @xmath78 a nonnegative integer .",
    "it is then logical to consider for the eigenvalues @xmath79 of @xmath69 , the decomposition for @xmath80@xmath81 where @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 .    in general",
    "the conformal partition function expands over characters of the @xmath7 virasoro algebra@xmath85 where @xmath86 are nonnegative integers describing the multiplicities of virasoro representations in the hilbert space .",
    "bauer and saleur @xcite used coulomb gas techniques to show that if one chooses the boundary conditions leading to the configuration depicted in fig.[cap : lattice ] the single character @xmath87 , i.e. the partition function of tim with @xmath28 boundary conditions , can be realized in the scaling limit @xmath80 .",
    "the configuration can be built by taking the boundary boltzmann weights described above , with @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",

    "however , these `` fields '' are irrelevant in the sense that they do not change the scaling energies if they are real and restricted to appropriate intervals  @xcite .",
    "explicitly , the cylinder partition functions obtained  @xcite from @xmath27 integrable boundaries with @xmath95 real are independent of @xmath93 and given by single virasoro characters @xmath96 the reason for this is that in the lattice model the fields @xmath97 and @xmath98 control the location of zeros of eigenvalues of @xmath59 on the real axis in the complex plane of the spectral parameter @xmath99 whereas only the zeros in the scaling regime , a distance @xmath100 out from the real axis , contribute in the scaling limit @xmath101 .",

    "we find that only one parameter at the time ( we call it @xmath103 ) is needed to induce the @xmath45 rg flows and is identified as the thermal boundary field : @xmath104    for the flow ( [ protoflow ] ) , following @xcite , we consider the @xmath105 boundary with the @xmath106 boundary on the right ( with no boundary field ) and the @xmath107 boundary on the left with boundary field @xmath97 .",
    "we scale @xmath97 as @xmath108 where @xmath1 is real . in terms of boundary weights",
    ", the @xmath109 boundary is reproduced in the limit @xmath110 whereas the @xmath107 boundary is reproduced in the limit @xmath111 .",
    "the scaling behavior of the @xmath0 lattice model at the boundary fixed points is described by the tba equations of obrien , pearce and warnaar  @xcite ( opw ) .",
    "we generalize their analysis to include the scaling boundary field  ( [ scaling - xi ] ) .",
    "the zeros of @xmath112 can be classified in two strips , the first given by @xmath113 and the second by @xmath114 we refer to them as strip i and ii respectively .",
    "each zero has to be accompanied by its complex conjugate , and there are only two zeros on the real axis depending on @xmath115 that do not play any role in the following .",
    "so we are led to consider only zeros in the upper half @xmath99 complex plane excluding the real axis . for @xmath53",
    "sufficiently large general considerations supported by numerical inspection allow to say that there exists    * @xmath116 1-strings at @xmath117 and @xmath118 2-strings at @xmath119with @xmath120 in strip i * @xmath121 1-strings at @xmath122 and @xmath123 2-strings at @xmath124 with @xmath120 in strip ii    the precise classification can be done in terms of the relative ordering ( with respect to their imaginary parts ) of the 1 and 2-strings .",
    "this can be achieved by giving the sequence of numbers @xmath125 of 2-strings with @xmath126 . in the case of @xmath127",
    "this must be supplemented @xcite by a parity of strings @xmath128 .",
    "because we order the zeros as @xmath129 the quantum numbers must satisfy @xmath130 moreover , in the second strip the largest quantum number must be less or equal the number of 2-strings of type 2 , @xmath131 the 2-strings in strip i are infinite in number at the scaling limit ( see below ) , and their quantum numbers are unbounded .",
    "we write this sequence as@xmath132 there are constraints on the numbers of strings , analyzed in detail in @xcite , depending on the specific @xmath28 condition    * for @xmath127 ( @xmath116 odd , @xmath121 even)@xmath133 * for @xmath134 ( @xmath116 odd , @xmath121 odd)@xmath135    in the scaling limit @xmath80 the number of 2-strings in strip i becomes infinite : @xmath136 , while the number of the other three types of roots ( 1-strings in both strips and 2-strings in strip ii ) remains of order @xmath137 .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that the pattern of zeros fixes the energies ( here @xmath138 and @xmath139 is the @xmath0 cartan matrix)@xmath140 @xmath141 out of these energy expressions it is possible to reconstruct the characters @xmath142 and @xmath143 .",
    "first consider the so called _ finitized characters _",
    "@xcite@xmath144 where @xmath145 is the largest eigenvalue of the double row transfer matrix with @xmath27 boundary conditions and @xmath53 sites .",
    "the limit @xmath80 of such objects can be shown to give the well known formulae for the tim characters ( for details see @xcite ) .",
    "once the characters have been related in such a strict way to the distribution of zeros in strips i and ii , it is also possible to see how they are mapped one another along the flow @xmath3 . for this purpose",
    "it is more convenient to consider the reverse flow @xmath146 from ir to uv .",
    "the counting of the total number of zeros in the upper @xmath99 plane for a @xmath134 configuration is @xmath53 , while for @xmath127 is @xmath147 .",
    "therefore one zero must disappear to infinity along this reverse flow ( or appear from infinity in the physical flow ) .",
    "we have found 3 mechanisms that seem to exhaust the possible ways for such a phenomenon to be realized @xcite    * a. the top 1-string in strip  2 flows to @xmath148 , decoupling from the system while @xmath116 , @xmath118 and @xmath123 remain unchanged .",
    "this mechanism applies in the ir when @xmath149 and produces frozen states in the uv with @xmath150 and @xmath151 .",
    "* b. the top 2-string in strip  1 and the top 1-string in strip  2 flow to @xmath148 and a 2-string comes in from @xmath148 in strip  2 becoming the top 2-string .",

    "for any @xmath169 we introduce the functions@xmath170 each one being analytic in the corresponding strip i or ii .    the recurrence relation for @xmath167 yields @xmath171 and an analogous formula for @xmath172 that we do not need in the following .",
