    "we demonstrate that the case of @xmath33 and x = cr stabilizes the fm ordering in the system with * p * pointing upwards .",
    "surprisingly , this is completely due to rather modest 5  % decrease of @xmath63 under * p * reversal , as shown in fig .  3 . with decreasing @xmath63 above cro@xmath3 , the fm order is developing in the system .",
    "more precisely , when the fe-(i+1 ) magnetic moment becomes larger ferromagnetism is stabilized in layer ( i+2 ) . in the case of x = ti , the interlayer separations @xmath64 and @xmath63 are almost the same upon the * p * reversal that prevents any crucial spin reorientation in the topmost fe ml .     relative contributions ( in % ) of each magnetic species of fe@xmath34/xo@xmath3/bto ( x = ti , cr ) to the magnetization change , @xmath100 , induced by polarization reversal .",
    "the contributions from the two fe-(i+2 ) and two fe-(i+1 ) atoms , one interfacial x and two o atoms were considered .",
    "the absolute values of @xmath100 are given ( in @xmath18 ) above each bar . ]",
    "in summary , we present an _ ab initio _ study of the effect of interfacial cr on the strength of magnetoelectric coupling seen at the interface of multiferroic fe@xmath0/cro@xmath3/batio@xmath1(001 ) , with the fe thickness @xmath22 monolayers .",
    "we predict that a cro@xmath3-terminated interface instead of tio@xmath3 may significantly enhance magnetoelectricity in the system .",
    "the most attractive scenario is , however , obtainded for the fe bilayer where the magnetic order changes from nearly zero-@xmath19 ferrimagnetic to ferromagnetic upon polarization reversal in ferroelectric batio@xmath1(001 ) .",
