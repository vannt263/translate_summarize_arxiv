    "the star lp  133 - 373 ( nltt  36188)r.a.(2000)@xmath3 , dec.(2000)@xmath4was originally listed in the @xcite catalog as a red star ( @xmath5 mag ) with a fainter ( @xmath6 mag ) white dwarf star ( lp  133 - 374 , nltt  36191 ) as a common - proper - motion companion separated by @xmath7 .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows a finder chart for these stars .",
    "lp133 - 373 was found to be a partially eclipsing binary during unfiltered ccd - based time series photometry of the field in an attempt to detect variability of the white dwarf @xcite .",
    "their original estimate of the binary period ( @xmath8 d ) corresponds to half the correct period ( @xmath9 d ) because the similarity of the stellar types yields nearly identical light curves for primary and secondary eclipses .",
    "this conclusion is supported by detailed light curve modeling and the splitting of emission and well as absorption lines near quadrature .",
    "light curve variations outside of eclipse indicate dark surface spots , which is consistent with the chromospheric activity observed in the spectra ( balmer and emissions ) .",
    "only a few eclipsing low - mass binaries in detached systems have been studied in detail . @xcite and @xcite report 9 such systems .",
    "other recent identifications were made by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "late - type m dwarf stars are prominent members of the class of eclipsing cataclysmic variables .",
    "however , the late - type star is often outshined by the white dwarf s accretion disk providing little or no mass , luminosity , or radius information crucial in understanding the physical and evolutionary nature of these stars",
    ". reviews of late - type mass - radius relations are given by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "we present in  2 new observations of the common proper - motion pair lp  133 - 373/374 , and , in particular , photometric and spectroscopic data confirming that lp  133 - 373 is itself an eclipsing late - type binary .",
    "detailed orbital and stellar properties of the binary lp  133 - 373 are derived in  3.1 and an analysis of the common proper - motion companion lp  133 - 374 is presented in  3.2 .",
    "we summarize and conclude in  4 .",
    "we recently reprocessed the original photometric measurements obtained by @xcite on 1994 april 2 at the kitt peak national observatory ( kpno ) 0.9 m telescope .",
    "see @xcite for more details .",
    "we re - measured the bvri colors for the red dwarf and white dwarf components , respectively : @xmath10 mag , @xmath11 mag , @xmath12 mag , @xmath13 mag , and @xmath14 mag , @xmath15 mag , @xmath16 mag , @xmath17 mag .",
    "the white dwarf colors were differentially determined with a field star and the red star s photometry was obtained with an aperture that excluded the white dwarf .",
    "the red dwarf data were obtained out of eclipse .",
    "the colors clearly show that the red star is approximately of dm4 - 5 spectral type in agreement with the spectra , which exhibit chromospheric activity and provide measurements of the tio5 bandheads indicating a dm4 classification ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) in agreement with previous classifications @xcite .",
    "our comparisons of the available colors with other dm stars in the literature @xcite also place it in the dm4 range , which we assume for our analysis .",
    "series of images of lp133 - 373 were taken with the 0.9 m telescope of the southeastern association for research in astronomy ( sara ) , which is also located at kpno .",
    "the initial eclipsing data were obtained in 2003 may using sara s ap7p ccd and no filters .",
    "differential light curves were produced from the 2003 through 2005 observing seasons using various comparison stars in the field .",
    "since the data were collected and reduced by several different observers using different comparison stars during this time and due to the unfiltered nature of the photometry , these light curves served only to establish the ephemeris .",
    "observations made on the ( ut ) nights of 2006 may 2 , 3 , 4 , 21 and 30 were taken with sara using the finger lakes ccd with johnson r and i filters .",
    "a consistent comparison was used along with a check star that was always in the field to get differential measurements .",
    "typical exposures were 30 seconds that yielded a @xmath1840 .",
    "these stars are shown in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "all new photometric data were reduced using standard procedures within iraf and measured with apertures a few arc seconds wide so as to exclude the white dwarf , which may have contributed less than one percent in r or i in some cases . however , we believe that observations in these pass bands for the white dwarf reported by @xcite are contaminated by lp133 - 373 ; therefore , we rely on the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) ugriz photometry for the white dwarf , which are @xmath19 mag , @xmath20 mag , @xmath21 mag , @xmath22 mag , @xmath23 mag .",
    "sloan data for the red dwarf were marked as saturated and could not be used .",
    "finally we obtained two micron all sky survey @xcite jhk photometry of the binary lp133 - 373 : @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 .",
    "the data are useful as an independent verification of the average m dwarf absolute luminosity .",
    "the start and end of the observations are hjd 2451322.699946 and hjd 2451322.704645 , respectively , and according to our ephemeris ( see  3.1 and table  [ tbl1 ] ) the data were obtained out of eclipse ( phase@xmath27 ) .",

    "we obtained a single exposure of 1200 s with both stars on the slit .",
    "the bl250 grating ( 158 lines mm@xmath52 ) and ti-2 ccd ( 15 @xmath53 pixel size , circa 1989 ) were used to obtain a spectral range of 3500 to 6200   with a dispersion of 3.45    pixel@xmath52 and a resolution of @xmath54  .",
    "the resulting signal - to - noise ratio reached 15 in the red dwarf spectrum near 4150  , and 5 throughout the white dwarf spectrum .",
    "the white dwarf spectrum appears featureless to the noise limit .",
    "the spectrum is also relatively red indicating a low effective temperature at which hydrogen balmer lines are expected to be weak .",
    "the white dwarf is tentatively classified as a dc .",
    "a da classification remains possible and would be confirmed with the acquisition of a high signal - to - noise ratio h@xmath55 spectrum .",
    "the red dwarf spectrum revealed emission lines characteristic of chromospherically active stars .",
    "we obtained two optical spectra of lp133 - 373 with exposure times of 1800 s on 2005 july 29 ut at the mayall 4 m telescope at kpno .",

    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows prominent emission lines of and h and k. the h and k and the balmer lines were split indicating a velocity separation between the two binary components of @xmath62 km s@xmath52 .",
    "further details are presented in the analysis section (  3.1 ) .",
    "lp  133 - 373 was observed using the dual imaging spectrograph ( dis ) attached to the 3.5 m telescope at the apache point observatory ( apo ) on 2006 september 30 02:31:24.7 ut and 02:47:16.0 ut ( mid - exposure times ) .",
    "the exposure time of each spectrum is 900 s. we used the 830.8 line mm@xmath52 grating to obtain a spectral range of 6440 to 8150   with a dispersion of 0.84   pixel@xmath52 in the red .",
    "we also used the 1200 line mm@xmath52 grating to obtain a spectral range of 3830 to 5030   with a dispersion of 0.62   pixel@xmath52 to obtain a spectrum in the blue .",
    "the slit was set for 1.5 \" resulting in a resolution of 2.1   in the red and 1.7   in the blue . for each spectrum ,",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio reached 5 near 4150   and 20 near h@xmath55 .",
    "previous spectra had been obtained at apo @xcite on 2001 february 4 09:59:13 ut ( mid - exposure ) but did not show double lines because the orbit was near conjunction ( phase@xmath63 ) .",
    "our more recent apo spectra ( 2006 september 30 ) taken nearly an hour after eclipse ( phase@xmath64 ) yields an h@xmath55 emission velocity @xmath65 km s@xmath52 which should closely match the systemic velocity but the expected line split ( @xmath66 km s@xmath52 ) at this time was not detected due to limited resolution ( @xmath67 km s@xmath52 ) .",
    "further details are presented in the analysis section (  3.1 ) .",
    "all new spectroscopic data were reduced using standard procedures within iraf .",
    "heliocentric corrections were applied to the wavelength scale of all spectra .",
    "to determine the binary parameters we followed four steps .",
    "first , we used the epoch of all seven eclipses , which include four eclipses observed using unfiltered ccd data taken during 2003 - 2005 and three eclipses observed using filtered photometry in 2006 may , and we determined the initial epoch of the primary mid - eclipse and the orbital period ( table  [ tbl1 ] ) . figure  [ fig3 ] shows the @xmath68 diagram for the epoch of all seven eclipses .",
    "significant deviations with respect to our ephemeris are evident .",
    "we attribute these deviations to the presence of surface spots with varying contrasts and locations .",
    "the epoch of primary eclipse is ( hjd ) @xmath69    in a second step , we used the ephemeris as a starting point for the binary star program phoebe @xcite and we performed detailed light curve modeling of our r and i data taken in 2006 may .",
    "we do not model unfiltered data .",
    "the program phoebe is based on the wilson - devinney ( wd ) program @xcite .",
    "the similarity in the primary and secondary eclipses led us to adopt a mass ratio of 1.0 , a circular orbit , and typical dm4 temperatures @xcite for each star of 3100 k.    the radial velocity measurements provide the only anchor in establishing the semi - major axis @xmath32 .",
    "radial velocities were determined from our 2005 july spectroscopy , which included measurements from h@xmath70 , h@xmath71 , h@xmath72 and k emission lines while excluding the very blended lines of h@xmath73 and h. the line centers were measured using iraf s routine for de - blending multiple profiles , in this case two profiles  one for each star .",
    "only 2 sets of heliocentric velocities were obtained at phase@xmath59 , @xmath74 km  s@xmath52 and @xmath75 km  s@xmath52 , and phase@xmath61 , @xmath76 km  s@xmath52 and @xmath77 km  s@xmath52 .",
    "the average velocity separation is @xmath78 km  s@xmath52 . a best fit to the velocities starting with the known period , a systemic velocity between the measured velocities @xmath79 -33 km  s@xmath52 ( which is close to the apo measurement of @xmath80 km s@xmath52 at phase 0.53 ) , and an inclination of 90@xmath81 yields a minimum total mass of the system @xmath820.67@xmath83 .",
    "we repeated the radial velocity analysis using the absorption line spectra .",
    "we adopted the spectrum of the dm3.5 star gliese 15b as a template for both component stars of lp  133 - 373 .",
    "the spectrum of gliese  15b was obtained at kpno on 2006 november 27 with the same instrumental set - up used on 2005 july .",
    "we established the zero - velocity scale using the radial velocity measurement of @xcite , @xmath84 km s@xmath52 .",
    "we shifted the two templates independently within a velocity range of @xmath85 to @xmath86 km s@xmath52 , and fitted the combined templates to the observed spectrum of lp  133 - 373 using a @xmath87 minimization technique .",
    "the best fits for the 2005 july spectra resulted in @xmath88 km s@xmath52 and @xmath89 km s@xmath52 ( phase@xmath59 ) , and @xmath90 km s@xmath52 and @xmath91 km  s@xmath52 ( phase@xmath61 ) , which corresponds to an average velocity separation of @xmath92 km  s@xmath52 .",
    "the velocity separation measurements using absorption and emission line spectra are essentially identical .",
    "we also measured the systemic velocity in the apo 2006 september spectrum ( @xmath93 km  s@xmath52 ) using resonance lines at @xmath94 and @xmath95  .",
    "we find that the mass ratio ( @xmath96 ) ranges from @xmath97 using the emission spectra to @xmath98 using the absorption spectra .",
    "although we adopted @xmath99 we will explore the effect of a varying mass ratio ( see below ) .",
    "next , in a third step , the inclination and potentials ( stellar radii ) were then iteratively adjusted within phoebe until both eclipse depths and widths matched the observed light curve .",
    "note that all solutions are based on a atmosphere of 3500 k ramped from a black body approximation at 1500 k , and on logarithmic limb darkening with coefficients by @xcite for temperatures of 3500 k since the coefficient values are not known below this temperature .",
    "table  [ tbl1 ] presents the simultaneous light / velocity solutions .    finally , in a last fourth step we introduced surface spots .",
    "initial fits were done with the light levels adjusted to match the eclipses .",
    "we subsequently scaled the model light curve to values outside of eclipse ( near phase 0.25 ) and spots were added to fit the complete light curve since a spot wave is clearly evident .",
    "light curve models were compared to the eclipse geometry implied by our @xmath100 , @xmath101 , and unfiltered photometry .",
    "the unfiltered comparisons are only for a check on the ephemeris since spot configurations are surely different between the 2003 and 2006 epochs .",
    "we fit our photometric data with model light curves using the spot parameters given in table  [ tbl2 ] .",
    "no satisfactory fit was possible without starspots , so cool spots were added one at a time , with typical temperature factors , @xmath102 , of about 0.80 .",
    "spots on the facing hemisphere of each star were needed .",
    "a similar effect on the light curves would occur if the spots were on the outer facing hemispheres but the models were best fit with the inner facing configuration .",
    "the spot parameters were refined with the differential corrections routine part of the wilson - devinney code .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] shows the light curve using parameters for the two spots given in table  [ tbl2 ] , and figure  [ fig5 ] shows the binary configuration at four phases ( @xmath103 ) and as seen along the line of sight .",
    "ccccc 1 & 0.70@xmath1040.17 & 0.00@xmath1040.04 & 0.40@xmath1040.02 & 0.72@xmath1040.06 + 2 & 0.55@xmath1040.07 & 5.30@xmath1040.06 & 0.45@xmath1040.03 & 0.78@xmath1040.05 +    we also examined the sensitivity of the solutions to our our assumption of a mass ratio @xmath105 . if we let the mass ratio reach @xmath106 and 1.1 , in both cases the separation increases from 5.1 to 5.15 @xmath107 corresponding to a slight increase in the total systemic mass from 0.68 to 0.69 @xmath83 and no significant effect on the inclination",
    "of course , by introducing a mass asymmetry , the predicted systemic velocity shifts from @xmath108 to @xmath109 km  s@xmath52 at @xmath106 and to @xmath110 km  s@xmath52 at @xmath111 .",
    "the solutions closely match the limits allowed by our systemic velocity measurement of @xmath80 km s@xmath52 , and , therefore , the actual mass ratio should be found within the range @xmath112 .",
    "tables  [ tbl3 ] and [ tbl4 ] present our photometry , where @xmath113 , @xmath114 refer to magnitude differences between lp133 - 373 and the comparison star shown in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "we computed the distance to the binary several ways .",
    "this allowed us to check the modeled binary luminosity for consistency and to find the luminosity of the white dwarf common proper motion component .",
    "two methods of determining luminosity for the binary from observable measurements were used .",
    "one method uses the v - i colors to obtain the absolute visual magnitude @xmath115 .",
    "the other method utilizes the tio5 band strength to get @xmath115 . the apparent magnitude ( @xmath116 )",
    "can then be used to compute a distance modulus .",
    "we assumed that the stars were identical enough to facilitate a simple distance correction .",
    "the inverse square law allows us to correct the distance computed for two identical stars by treating them as one and multiplying the result by @xmath117 .",
    "the empirical color magnitude diagram of nearby stars yields the following relationship for @xmath118 @xcite @xmath119 with @xmath120 . using our ( v - i)=2.843 we get an @xmath115=12.3 , which gives a distance of 40 pc for a single star of this color and observed @xmath121 .",
    "however , we correct this distance by a factor of @xmath117 and get the distance to the system as 56 pc .    a similar relationship exists for the tio5 band strength @xcite , @xmath122 with @xmath123 . using tio5@xmath124 @xcite we get @xmath125 and a distance of 30 pc , which when corrected for two stars becomes 42 pc .",
    "the phoebe light curve models compute bolometric magnitudes for both stars , which are similar ( @xmath126 ) .",
    "bolometric corrections for the visual bandpass can be computed and subtracted from the modeled @xmath127 to give @xmath115 using the following relation @xcite @xmath128 which gives us @xmath129 and therefore @xmath130 for a corrected distance of 55 pc .",
    "the model is consistent with the two independently determined distance estimates ranging from 42 to 56 pc .    in summary ,",
    "the distance estimates imply a modulus of @xmath131 adopting @xmath132 , the absolute magnitude @xmath133 for the pair or @xmath134 for each binary component assuming equal luminosity .",
    "the measured @xmath135 and our @xmath136 estimate for lp  133 - 373 are consistent with established relations for nearby stars @xcite .",
    "the main limitation to the usefulness of such relations is the intrinsic scatter found in color - luminosity measurements .",
    "note that the absolute jhk magnitudes of the nearby white dwarf companion ( see  3.2 ) are @xmath137 mag ; therefore , potential contamination of the infrared data by the white dwarf is insignificant .      to analyze the photometric and spectroscopic data of the white dwarf lp133 - 374",
    ", we calculated a set of synthetic sdss @xmath138 colors using a grid of pure - hydrogen models @xcite for @xmath139 to 84000 k and @xmath140 , 8.0 and 9.0 .",
    "we also calculated synthetic @xmath138 colors for black - body spectra with temperatures ranging from @xmath139 to 84000 k. figures  [ fig6 ] and [ fig7 ] show the observed @xmath141 versus @xmath142 and @xmath143 versus @xmath142 colors , respectively , compared to the synthetic colors for pure - hydrogen models and the black - body colors .",
    "note that kowalski & saumon ( 2006 ) recently established that the extended line wing of ly@xmath55 contributes significantly to the total opacity in the blue part of the optical spectrum .",
    "the additional opacity is due to perturbation of the hydrogen atom by neighboring h atoms and h@xmath144 molecules .",
    "an examination of figure 2 in kowalski & saumon ( 2006 ) suggests that the effect of this additional opacity on a 5800 k hydrogen - rich white dwarf corresponds to an increase of @xmath145 and 0.02 mag in the @xmath146 and @xmath147 bands , respectively .",
    "hence , the effect is mostly apparent in the @xmath148 color index and correspond , as observed , to a downward vertical shift in the @xmath148 versus @xmath149 diagram .",
    "the temperatures were derived by minimizing the @xmath87 between the observed photometry and the synthetic colors .",
    "the synthetic @xmath146 and @xmath147 magnitudes for hydrogen - rich models were corrected by @xmath150 and @xmath151 mag , respectively .",
    "the errors in temperatures were determined from considering the uncertainties in the observed colors only .",
    "therefore , the quoted errors do not take into account systematic errors in synthetic colors such as discussed above .",
    "the observed @xmath141 versus @xmath142 colors correspond to an effective temperature of @xmath152 k using the pure - hydrogen sequence , and @xmath153 k using the black - body colors .",
    "the observed @xmath143 versus @xmath142 colors correspond to an effective temperature of @xmath154 k using the pure - hydrogen sequence and @xmath155 k using black - body colors .",
    "we also fit the sdss _ ugriz _ photometry to synthetic _",
    "ugriz _ absolute magnitudes , and found that @xmath156 k when using the hydrogen - rich sequence ( assuming @xmath157 ) and @xmath158 k assuming a black - body .",
    "we also fit the available spectrum ( 3800 to 6190  ) to da spectra at @xmath157 and black - body spectra to obtain @xmath159 k and @xmath160 k , respectively .",
    "figure  [ fig8 ] shows the spectrum and _ ugriz _ photometry of lp133 - 374 compared to a hydrogen - rich spectrum at @xmath161 k and a blackbody spectrum at @xmath162 k.        we determined the possible range of mass values for the white dwarf assuming both hydrogen - rich atmospheres and helium - rich atmospheres ( using a black - body approximation ) .",
    "first , we calculated the absolute magnitude of the white dwarf based on the distance , and therefore if the system is between 42 and 56 pc , then the absolute magnitude ( @xmath163 ) of the white dwarf is between 15.68 and 15.06 .",
    "assuming the white dwarf is hydrogen - rich , then the mean of the temperatures determined above is @xmath164 k. the mass range can then be determined using the mass - radius relations of @xcite with a hydrogen envelope of @xmath165 and a metallicity of @xmath166 , where for a given temperature , the absolute magnitude is a function of the radius and therefore the mass .",
    "we determined a mass of @xmath167 with a cooling age ranging from @xmath168 to @xmath169 years .",
    "assuming the white dwarf is helium - rich , and using a black - body approximation for the energy distribution , then the mean of the temperatures determined using the different methods as discussed above is @xmath170 k. for the mass determinations in this case , we used the mass - radius relations of @xcite without a hydrogen envelope and with a metallicity of @xmath171 . therefore ,",
    "if lp133 - 374 is a helium - rich white dwarf with @xmath172 k , we can estimate the mass to be between 0.55 and @xmath173 and the cooling age to be between @xmath174 and @xmath169 years .",
    "the progenitor of a @xmath175 white dwarf is a early - type star of @xmath176 @xcite with a main - sequence life - time @xmath177 years .",
    "these ages imply a minimum age of @xmath178 years for the lp133 - 373/374 system .",
    "for a temperature range of 5000 - 5500 k , the corresponding 2mass absolute magnitude @xmath179 , or an apparent magnitude of @xmath180 , fainter than the limiting magnitude of the 2mass survey .",
    "we have modeled light and velocity curves of lp133 - 373 as an eclipsing binary with two similar dm type stars with spots .",
    "although the masses and radii of @xmath0 and @xmath1 make them appear marginally more massive and smaller than other stars of the same type tabulated by @xcite , a complete radial velocity study and additional light curves are required before we can reach a conclusion on this matter .",
    "the uncertainty in the mass ratio and the paucity of velocity data create a large uncertainty in the semi - major axis and ultimately in the individual masses .",
    "the role of spots also play a critical role in light curve modeling and the resulting fits .",
    "the 2006 may data set shows light curve variations suggesting that spot activity had significantly changed within a month .",
    "we intend on obtaining high - dispersion spectra of lp133 - 374 sampling a complete orbital period in the h@xmath55 region .",
    "new photometry , covering several complete orbital periods , would be helpful in constraining the geometry of the spots and the individual temperatures .",
    "the new data will provide better mass , luminosity , and radius information that is so important for understanding low mass stars .",
    "in addition , limb darkening of these cool stars is also important to the light curve models .",
    "a study of additional stars like these is needed to refine limb darkening models .    the white dwarf is tentatively classified as a dc spectral type , and a possible da type .",
    "it has a temperature of 5100 to 5500 k depending on the atmospheric abundance of hydrogen . adopting the distance of its common proper - motion companion lp133 - 373 ( 42 - 56 pc ) we constrain the radius , hence the mass of the white dwarf .",
    "the mass of the white dwarf is estimated to be @xmath181 .",
    "consequently , the minimum total age of the system is 3 gyr .",
    "the angular separation of 5@xmath182 between the white dwarf and the eclipsing binary corresponds to a projected separation of 210 - 280 au .",
    "this separation excludes the possibility of past interactions .",
    "new h@xmath55 spectroscopy will also help establish the spectral type of the white dwarf , and accurately determine its physical characteristics . in turn",
    ", this will be helpful in establishing the age of the triple system from the white dwarf cooling age .",
