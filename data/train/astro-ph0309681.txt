    "<S> constraints on possible lorentz symmetry violation ( lv ) of order @xmath0 for electrons and photons in the framework of effective field theory ( eft ) are discussed . using ( i ) the report of polarized mev emission from grb021206 and ( ii ) the absence of vacuum erenkov radiation from synchrotron electrons in the crab nebula , </S>",
    "<S> we improve previous bounds by @xmath1 and @xmath2 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that the lv parameters for positrons and electrons are different , discuss electron helicity decay , and investigate investigate how prior constraints are modified by the relations between lv parameters implied by eft .    </S>",
    "<S> the past few years have witnessed a rapid development of powerful constraints on some types of lorentz symmetry violation ( lv ) that have been suggested by quantum gravity scenarios . while no current suggestion of lv is firm enough to be considered a prediction , </S>",
    "<S> there is nevertheless great interest in the possibility of lv induced by planck scale physics since it offers the hope of an observational window into quantum gravity . to date </S>",
    "<S> no lv phenomena have been observed ( although the ultra high energy cosmic ray events detected by the akeno giant air shower array ( agasa ) , could possibly turn out to be harbingers of lv physics  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the absence of lv provides important constraints on viable quantum gravity theories . moreover , these constraints are interesting in their own right as they extend the domain where relativity has been tested far beyond its previous frontiers .    </S>",
    "<S> the primary purpose of this paper is to further strengthen the bounds on lv of order @xmath3 for photons and electrons , where @xmath4 gev is the planck energy , the presumed energy scale of quantum gravity . </S>",
    "<S> we use the reported observation  @xcite of polarized gamma rays from the gamma ray burst grb021206 to improve the birefringence constraint by ten orders of magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> [ the results of  @xcite have been challenged  @xcite and defended  @xcite . if the polarization turns out to be weaker , then the birefringence constraint from grb021206 is weakened ( or eliminated ) . </S>",
    "<S> ] by consideration of the vacuum erenkov process for the electrons producing the highest frequency synchrotron radiation from the crab nebula we improve on the old birefringence constraint by two orders of magnitude .    </S>",
    "<S> a secondary purpose is to revisit previous constraints in light of the effective field theory ( eft ) analysis of  @xcite , some of which are strengthened and some weakened or limited in applicability . </S>",
    "<S> we show that eft implies that the lv parameters for positrons are opposite ( in two senses ) compared to electrons , and we discuss a new lv process of  helicity decay \" , in which an electron of one helicity decays to a state with the opposite helicity . </S>",
    "<S> finally we pull together the strongest constraints to date and present them in a logarithmic plot that allows their nature and relative strength to be easily compared to previous work .    </S>",
    "<S> we adopt the framework of effective field theory as developed e.g.  in  @xcite , focusing on the electron - photon sector since this involves no other particles and there are many observations allowing a number of independent constraints to be combined . </S>",
    "<S> we assume rotational symmetry is preserved in a preferred frame , which is taken to coincide with that of the cosmic microwave background radiation , and consider only lv suppressed by one power of the ratio @xmath0 , which arises from mass dimension five operators in the lagrangian . </S>",
    "<S> ( we thus assume that lower mass dimension lv operators are suppressed by a symmetry or other mechanism , otherwise they would be expected to dominate  @xcite . )    under these assumptions the most general photon and electron dispersion relations are  @xcite e^2 & = & p^2 p^3/m  photons [ eq : disp - ph ] + e^2 & = & m^2 + p^2 + _ </S>",
    "<S> r , l p^3/m [ electrons ] where @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 are independent dimensionless parameters , and @xmath8 gev is factored out rather than the planck mass @xmath9 for computational convenience . </S>",
    "<S> we adopt units with @xmath10 and the low energy speed of light @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> the sign in the photon dispersion relation ( [ eq : disp - ph ] ) corresponds to the helicity ( i.e. right or left circular polarization ) , while the labels @xmath12 and @xmath13 in the electron dispersion relation ( [ electrons ] ) apply for positive and negative electron helicity respectively ( see below for more details ) . </S>",
    "<S> the bound @xmath14  @xcite is provided by measurements of spin - polarized torsion pendulum frequency  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> _ new birefringence constraint_. the dispersion relation ( [ eq : disp - ph ] ) implies that electromagnetic waves of opposite helicity have different phase velocities , which leads to a rotation of linear polarization direction through the angle ( t)=t/2=k^2 t/2 m [ rotation ] for a plane wave with wave - vector @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> observations of polarized radiation from distant sources can hence be used to place an upper bound on @xmath5 .    </S>",
    "<S> the best previous bound , @xmath16 , was obtained by gleiser and kozameh  @xcite , using the observed 10% polarization of ultraviolet light from a distant galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> ( see also @xcite for similar birefringence bounds in the context of different types of lorentz symmetry breaking . )    </S>",
    "<S> recently the prompt emission from the gamma ray burst grb021206 was observed using the rhessi detector  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a linear polarization of 80% @xmath17 20% was reported  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> [ this claim has been challenged  @xcite and defended  @xcite . ] during the five seconds of emission the intensity varied strongly on a timescale of small fractions of a second consistently across the spectral window 0.15 - 2 mev . </S>",
    "<S> the data  @xcite indicate a major contribution to the flux comes from photons significantly distributed over at least the energy range 0.1 - 0.5 mev .    </S>",
    "<S> the constraint arises from the fact that if the angle of polarization rotation ( [ rotation ] ) were to differ by more than @xmath18 over the range 0.1 - 0.3 mev ( and hence by more than @xmath19 over the range 0.1 - 0.5 mev ) , the instantaneous polarization at the detector would fluctuate sufficiently for the net polarization of the signal to be suppressed well below the observed value . </S>",
    "<S> ( a stronger constraint could clearly be obtained by taking into account more precisely the spectral characteristics of the signal and detector . ) </S>",
    "<S> the difference in rotation angles for wave - vectors @xmath20 and @xmath21 is = ( k_2 ^ 2-k_1 ^ 2 ) d/2 m , [ diffrotation ] where we have replaced the time @xmath22 by the distance @xmath23 from the source to the detector ( divided by the speed of light ) .    </S>",
    "<S> while the distance to grb021206 is unknown , it is well known that most cosmological bursts have redshifts in the range 1 - 2 corresponding to distances of greater than a gpc . using the distance distribution derived in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite we conservatively take the minimum distance to this burst as 0.5 gpc , corresponding to a redshift of @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> this then yields the constraint ||<5.010 ^ </S>",
    "<S> -15/d_0.5 . where @xmath25 is the distance to the burst in units of 0.5 gpc .    _ </S>",
    "<S> new erenkov - synchrotron constraint_. in a region of the lv parameter space there is an energy threshold for a free electron to emit a photon in a process called vacuum erenkov radiation . the threshold can occur either with emission of a soft photon or a hard photon depending on the parameters  @xcite . in the soft photon case </S>",
    "<S> the threshold is @xmath26 , from which it follows that the strength of the constraint on @xmath27 scales as the inverse cube of the electron energy , and that energies of order 10 tev for the electron are required in order to put constraints of order unity on the lv parameters  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> electrons of energy up to 50 tev are inferred via the observation of 50 tev gamma rays from the crab nebula which are explained by inverse compton ( ic ) scattering . </S>",
    "<S> since the erenkov rate is orders of magnitude higher than the ic scattering rate , the erenkov process must not occur for these electrons  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this yields a constraint on @xmath27 of order @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> neither photon helicity should be emitted , so the absolute value @xmath29 is bounded , which strengthens the ic erenkov constraint . on the other hand , it could be that only one electron helicity produces the ic photons and the other loses energy by vacuum erenkov radiation . </S>",
    "<S> hence we can infer only that at least one of @xmath6 and @xmath7 satisfies the bound .    </S>",
    "<S> a complementary constraint was derived in  @xcite by making use of the very high energy electrons that produce the highest frequency synchrotron radiation in the crab nebula . </S>",
    "<S> for negative values of @xmath27 the electron has a maximal group velocity less than the speed of light , hence there is a maximal synchrotron frequency that can be produced regardless of the electron energy  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> observations of the crab nebula reveal synchrotron radiation at least out to 100 mev ( requiring electrons of energy 1500 tev in the lorentz invariant case ) , which implies that at least one of the two parameters @xmath30 must be greater than @xmath31 ( this constraint is independent of the value of @xmath5 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we can not constrain both @xmath27 parameters in this way since it could be that all the crab synchrotron radiation is produced by electrons of one helicity . hence for the rest of this discussion let @xmath27 stand for whichever of the two @xmath27 s satisfies the synchrotron constraint .    </S>",
    "<S> this must be the same @xmath27 as satisfies the ic erenkov constraint discussed above , since otherwise the energy of these synchrotron electrons would be below 50 tev rather than the lorentz invariant value of 1500 tev . </S>",
    "<S> the crab spectrum is well accounted for with a single population of electrons responsible for both the synchrotron radiation and the ic @xmath32-rays . </S>",
    "<S> if there were enough extra electrons to produce the observed synchrotron flux with thirty times less energy per electron , then the electrons of the other helicity which would be producing the ic @xmath32-rays would be too numerous .    </S>",
    "<S> we now use the existence of these synchrotron producing electrons to improve on the vacuum erenkov constraint . for a given @xmath33 </S>",
    "<S> , some definite electron energy @xmath34 must be present to produce the observed synchrotron radiation . </S>",
    "<S> ( this is higher for negative @xmath27 and lower for positive @xmath27 than the lorentz invariant value  @xcite . ) </S>",
    "<S> values of @xmath29 for which the vacuum erenkov threshold is lower than @xmath35 for either photon helicity can therefore be excluded . </S>",
    "<S> ( this is always a hard photon threshold , since the soft photon threshold occurs when the electron group velocity reaches the low energy speed of light , whereas the velocity required to produce any finite synchrotron frequency is smaller than this . ) for negative @xmath27 , the erenkov process occurs only when @xmath36  @xcite , so the excluded parameters lie in the region @xmath37 </S>",
    "<S> .    _ implications of eft for prior constraints_.    photon time of flight.the lorentz violating dispersion relation ( [ eq : disp - ph ] ) implies that the group velocity of photons , @xmath38 , is energy dependent . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to an energy dependent dispersion in the arrival time at earth for photons originating in a distant event  @xcite , which was previously exploited for constraints  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the dispersion of the two polarizations is larger since the difference in group velocity is then @xmath39 rather than @xmath40 , but the time of flight constraint remains many orders of magnitude weaker than the birefringence one from polarization rotation . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : all ] we use the eft improvement of the constraint of  @xcite which yields @xmath41 .    </S>",
    "<S> photon decay and photon absorption.the constraints from photon decay @xmath42 and absorption @xmath43 must be reanalyzed to take into account the different dispersion for the two photon helicities , and the different parameters for the two electron helicities , but there is a further complication : both these processes involve positrons in addition to electrons . </S>",
    "<S> previous constraint derivations have assumed that these have the same dispersion , but that need not be the case  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we show below for the @xmath44 corrections that it is indeed not so . </S>",
    "<S> taking into account the above factors could not significantly improve the strength of the constraints ( which is mainly determined by the energy of the photons ) . </S>",
    "<S> we indicate here only what the helicity dependence of the photon dispersion implies , neglecting the important role of differing parameters for electrons and positrons and their helicity states .    the strongest limit on photon decay came from the highest energy photons known to propagate , which at the moment are the 50 tev photons observed from the crab nebula  @xcite . since their helicity is not measured , only those values of @xmath29 for which _ both _ helicities decay could be ruled out . </S>",
    "<S> the photon absorption constraint came from the fact that lv can shift the standard qed threshold for annihilation of multi - tev @xmath32-rays from nearby blazars such as mkn 501 with the ambient infrared extragalactic photons  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> lv depresses the rate of absorption of one photon helicity and increases it for the other . </S>",
    "<S> although the polarization of the @xmath32-rays is not measured , the possibility that one of the polarizations is essentially unabsorbed appears to be ruled out by the observations which show the predicted attenuation@xcite .    _ electron and positron dispersion_. the dirac equation in the lorentz violating eft including the dimension five operators can be written  @xcite as = 0 , [ dirac ] where @xmath45 is the unit timelike 4-vector that specifies the preferred frame . if we choose coordinates aligned with @xmath45 , so that @xmath46 , an electron or positron mode of energy @xmath47 and momentum @xmath48 in the @xmath49 direction contributes to the field operator via @xmath50 , where the upper sign here and below is for an electron and the lower for a positron , and @xmath51 is the spinor . </S>",
    "<S> inserting this in the deformed dirac equation ( [ dirac ] ) yields = 0 . </S>",
    "<S> [ diracep ] the helicity operator acting on @xmath51 is @xmath52  @xcite , where @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> this is hermitian and commutes with @xmath54 times the operator in ( [ diracep ] ) , which is also hermitian . </S>",
    "<S> hence helicity remains a good quantum number in the presence of this lorentz violation . </S>",
    "<S> assuming without loss of generality that @xmath55 , a spinor for helicity @xmath56 therefore satisfies @xmath57 , or equivalently @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> for helicity eigenstates therefore = 0 . </S>",
    "<S> this has the form of the standard dirac equation , with @xmath47 replaced by @xmath59 and @xmath48 replaced by @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> hence the dispersion relation is given by @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath62 this yields e^2 = p^2 + m^2 + 2(_1 + h_2)e^3/m . with the definitions @xmath63 and @xmath64 , the parameters in the dispersion relations for positive and negative helicity states respectively are thus @xmath6 and @xmath7 for electrons , and @xmath65 and @xmath66 for positrons .    _ </S>",
    "<S> possible new constraints from helicity decay_. if @xmath6 and @xmath67 are unequal , say @xmath68 , then a positive helicity electron can decay into a negative helicity electron and a photon , even when the lv parameters do not permit the vacuum erenkov effect . in this process , </S>",
    "<S> the large @xmath12 or small ( @xmath69 ) @xmath13 component of a positive helicity electron transitions to the small @xmath12 or large @xmath13 component of a negative helicity electron respectively . </S>",
    "<S> such  helicity decay \" has no threshold energy , so whether this process can be used to set constraints on @xmath30 is solely a matter of the decay rate . </S>",
    "<S> it can be shown ( assuming @xmath70 ) that for electrons of energy less than the transition energy @xmath71 , the lifetime of an electron susceptible to helicity decay is greater than @xmath72 . at the limit of the best current bound @xmath73 , </S>",
    "<S> the transition energy is approximately 10 tev and the lifetime for electrons below this energy is greater than @xmath74 seconds . </S>",
    "<S> this is long enough to preclude any terrestrial experiments from seeing the effect . </S>",
    "<S> the lifetime above the transition energy is instead bounded below by @xmath75 , which is @xmath76 seconds for energies just above 10 tev . </S>",
    "<S> the lifetime might therefore be short enough to provide new constraints .    </S>",
    "<S> such a constraint might come from the crab nebula . </S>",
    "<S> suppose that @xmath7 is below the synchrotron constraint ( i.e. @xmath77 ) , so that @xmath6 must satisfy both the synchrotron and erenkov constraints as explained above . </S>",
    "<S> then positive helicity electrons must have an energy of at least 50 tev to produce the observed synchrotron radiation . </S>",
    "<S> these must not decay to negative helicity electrons ( since those are unable to produce the synchrotron emission ) , which would require that the transition energy be greater than 50 tev if the decay rate is fast enough . </S>",
