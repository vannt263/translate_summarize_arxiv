    "not long afterwards , it was observed by lacey ( see @xcite ) that if @xmath29 for some @xmath30 and satisfies separation condition , then @xmath31 this version of the logarithmic lemma is strictly adjusted to the problems with arithmetic features . roughly speaking ,",
    "when applied to @xmath32 with @xmath33 equal to the least common multiple of all @xmath34 , we obtain a satisfactory bound as well , since @xmath35 .",

    "we are concerned with proving a two - parameter variant of bourgain s inequality for rational frequencies . from now on @xmath13 will be always a subset of @xmath38 , for some @xmath39 satisfying the following two parameter separation condition : for any @xmath40 , if @xmath5 then @xmath41 one of our main results is the following .",

    "moreover , the implied constant is independent of @xmath47 and the cardinality of the set @xmath13 .    our motivations to study the bound lie behind the ongoing project of the second author with jim wright where the authors study @xmath48 boundedness ( for @xmath49 ) of the following maximal function @xmath50 where @xmath51 is an integer - valued polynomial of two variables .",
    "theorem [ thm:1 ] turned out to be very useful there .",
    "in fact , since these sort of problems find applications in pointwise ergodic theory , we will be interested in bounding of for some variant of two - parameter oscillation seminorm rather than the supremum .",
    "let us recall that in the one - parameter case an oscillation seminorm @xmath52 for a sequence @xmath53 is defined by @xmath54 for any lacunary sequence @xmath55 .",
    "the seminorm @xmath52 is an important object when problems concerning pointwise convergence are considered . indeed , if @xmath56 is a sequence of functions such that @xmath57 is finite for every lacunary sequence @xmath55 , then the limit @xmath58 exists .",
    "thus , we immediately obtain almost everywhere convergence without relying on a ( possibly - unavailable ) density argument .",
    "moreover , the oscillation seminorm controls from above the supremum norm . indeed , for every @xmath59 we have @xmath60    in the two - parameter setting we would like to exploit the same kind of concepts .",
    "we shall study a variant of two - parameter oscillation seminorm inspired by the one introduced in @xcite .",
    "namely , given a lacunary sequence @xmath61 and a sequence @xmath62 an oscillation seminorm @xmath63 is defined by @xmath64 let us observe that the oscillation seminorm does not control the two - parameter supremum anymore .",
    "a good counterexample illustrating this is a sequence @xmath65 defined by @xmath66 indeed , @xmath67 is finite for every lacunary sequence @xmath68 whereas @xmath69 this shows a major difference between one- and multi - parameter settings .",
    "however , the oscillation seminorm still remains useful in pointwise convergence questions ( see section [ sec:2 ] for details ) .",
    "the second main result is the following .",
    "[ thm:2 ] for any lacunary sequence @xmath70 there is a constant @xmath71 such that for any finite set @xmath72 with @xmath39 satisfying , and all @xmath42 we have @xmath73 where @xmath74 and @xmath45 is the fourier transform operator on @xmath46 .",
    "the proofs of theorem [ thm:1 ] and theorem [ thm:2 ] consist of three steps .",
    "we shall analyze both : the supremum and the oscillation seminorm in four regions ; where the parameters are small , large and finally mixed . in the last case , by the symmetry it suffices to consider the region where the first parameter is small and the second is large .",
    "in the one parameter case the regime with small parameters was estimated with the aid of rademacher  menshov theorem , which asserts that there is an absolute constant @xmath71 such that for a given family of sets @xmath75 , for any @xmath76 and for any @xmath77 we have @xmath78 in our situation we are going to exploit the same sort of ideas , however the rademacher  menshov theorem must be adjusted to the two - parameter settings . due to independent parameters we can not hope for an analogous formulation with a nested family of sets .",
    "fortunately , it is still possible to prove a reasonable two - parameter counterpart of . in the supremum case ,",
    "theorem [ th:1 ] implies that there is a constant @xmath71 such that for all @xmath79 and for all @xmath80 we have @xmath81 the proof of theorem [ th:1 ] is a consequence of a numerical inequality ( see lemma [ lem:1 ] ) which is of independent interests . to the authors best knowledge it is the first multi - parameter version of the rademacher  menshov theorem .",
    "in the second case we analyze the region with large parameters and get a uniform bound with respect to the size of the family @xmath13 . here",
    "it is important that the frequencies are rational and the periodicity of the fourier characters will be used ( see theorem [ th:3 ] ) .",
    "this allows us to reduce the matters to suitable estimates corresponding to fejr kernels ( see theorem [ th:2 ] and theorem [ th:4 ] ) .",
    "then , in the oscillation case , the fefferman ",
    "stein vector - valued inequality for the hardy  littlewood maximal operator transfers our problem to one - parameter oscillation estimates of fejr kernels which complete the job .",
    "finally , in the mixed regime we need to combine the ideas from the first and second case . here",
    "we obtain the desired estimate with a logarithmic loss too .",
    "an interesting question remains open whether there is a chance to relax the assumption concerning rational frequencies in theorem [ thm:1 ] and theorem [ thm:2 ] .",
    "we have some partial results , in this directions , dealing with the case when @xmath42 is assumed to be a tensor function .      throughout the whole article ,",
    "unless otherwise stated , we will write @xmath82 ( @xmath83 ) if there is an absolute constant @xmath71 such that @xmath84 ( @xmath85 ) .",

    "but , unlike the one - parameter situation , it is not true that every convergent two - parameter sequence must be _",
    "bounded_. to see this it suffices to consider @xmath102 this is the main obstacle which prevents the two - parameter supremum norm from being controlled from above by the oscillation seminorm .",
