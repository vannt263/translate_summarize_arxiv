    "observations and modeling have demonstrated that flare energy is released in current sheets where magnetic reconnection occurs ( e.g. , recent review by @xcite ) . as a consequence , particles , including electrons and ions , can be accelerated and propagate upward along the open field lines or spiral downward along the closed field lines .",
    "the latter group of energetic particles can penetrate down to the chromosphere or even photosphere and generate flare footpoint emissions in hxr and visible continua , which is also known as white - light ( wl ) .",
    "it is hard to detect the wl signal during a flare because the flare emission is much weaker than the background of solar radiation .",
    "apparently , most wl emissions are identified in large flares , although they are believed to exist in all flares @xcite . during the era dominated by ground - based observations ,",
    "only about 120 wl flares were reported and most of them were above x2 class @xcite .",
    "@xcite systematically investigated all wlfs with hinode observations in the g - band at 4305   , and found that the cut - off visibility was reached for m1 flares . using the 1-meter ground - based telescope",
    ", @xcite detected the wl emission from a c2 flare .",
    "there are limitations on observing wl flares , such as the observing durations , spatial / temporal resolutions , limited field - of - view ( fov ) , dynamic range of detectors , choice of filters ( wavelengths ) and seeing conditions for ground - based observations .",
    "the newly launched space telescope , solar dynamics observatory ( sdo ) @xcite , provides full disk and imaging spectroscopy capabilities and hence increases the chance of catching wl flares .",
    "a substantial amount of work has been undertaken in an attempt to understand the energy transport and release processes .",
    "two fundamental questions need to be answered : 1 ) where does the wl emission originate ? and 2 ) what is the energy source of the wl emission ? in the literature ,",
    "two groups of models have been proposed to address these issues concerning wl flares .",
    "considering the fact that wl emission is always associated with hxr emission , the direct heating model , a straight forward model , assumes that the accelerated electrons reach the deeper atmosphere and deposit their energy by collision @xcite . according to @xcite , the photospheric column density exceeds some @xmath0 @xmath1 implying that only electrons with initial energy higher than 600 kev can contribute to the heating of the photosphere @xcite . however , there is no sufficient electron flux derived from hxr observations reaching the @xmath2 level .",
    "given the energetic difficulties associated with the direct heating model , some models involving secondary effects have been proposed , such as the chromospheric backwarming model @xcite and the h@xmath3 emission model @xcite .",
    "both direct and non - direct heating mechanisms can contribute to a single event .",
    "this idea has been demonstrated by the studies of core - halo structures by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a major flare could release energy exceeding 10@xmath4 erg @xcite .",
    "however , this may be a small amount of the total magnetic free energy stored in a huge and complex sunspot group . as an evidence , such a strong sunspot group can produce multiple flares during its life cycle .",
    "these flares , which originate in the same site are also known as homologous flares .",
    "the observations and analyses of homologous flares can be traced back to the time when the data were recorded in films . @xcite .",
    "presented an observation of a sequence of at least 10 flares occurring in one single active region during a 25-hour window . in the digital era ,",
    "examples of homologous flares can be found in many studies , ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "active region noaa 10486 produced the famous halloween events in 2003 , among which at least two flares occurred at the same location on 2003 october 29 and",
    "november 02 @xcite .    to further understand the energy transport and release processes",
    ", it is crucial to investigate the size and brightness of wl flare kernels @xcite .",
    "two conjugate ribbons are commonly observed for most flares in h@xmath5 or euv wavelengths . in radio and hxr observations , which are the the direct diagnostics of electron beams , footpoint sources are commonly detected except for a few special cases @xcite due to relative coarse resolution and non - focus imaging methods . with wl observations , the flare kernels ,",
    "if detected , are usually fully resolved as footpoint - like cores and ribbon - like halos @xcite .",
    "the characteristic size of the flare core could be as small as 0.7 in the near infrared and increases to 2  in g - band .",
    "this trend in principle resembles a converging flare loop and favors the direct heating model because other models do not predict such a converging variation @xcite . therefore",
    ", multi - wavelength observations in wl will provide a diagnosis of direct heating model .",
    "on the other hand , solar flares are not isolated events .",
    "they are always associated with other eruptive phenomena , such as filament eruptions , cmes , moreton waves and sometimes sunquakes .",
    "in fact , all of these phenomena are different manifestations of a single eruptive event @xcite . similar to wl flares , sunquakes are photospheric phenomena observed as propagating wavefronts .",
    "@xcite predicted the existence of sunquakes generated by energetic particles during the impulsive phase of flares .",
    "@xcite obtained the first observational evidence of sunquakes associated with an x - class flare on 1996 july 9 .",
    "further observations were reported by @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite and @xcite .",
    "previous observations have shown that the sunquake sources were cospatial with hxr or @xmath6-ray flare kernels @xcite , indicating a close relationship between sunquakes and energetic particles .",
    "@xcite found that many sunquakes coincide with wl flares .",
    "the authors believed that the back - warming mechanism is not only responsible for the wl flare emission , but also the energy source of sunquakes .",
    "besides the models related to electron beams , some other mechanisms can contribute to generate sunquakes as well .",
    "@xcite believe magnetic reconfiguration or perturbation of flux ropes @xcite can generate sunquakes .    in this paper",
    ", we present the study of a pair of homologous x - class wl flares in 2011 september , observed by the helioseismic and magnetic imager ( hmi ) @xcite onboard sdo .",
    "these flares occurred close to the disk center and are therefore good candidates for morphological studies .",
    "we perform a comprehensive investigation of the first flare ( hereafter flare i ) and a comparison to the second flare ( hereafter flare ii ) associated with a sunquake @xcite , focusing on the following two topics : 1 ) the basic flare information , such as the contrast enhancement and correlation between wl and hxr emission ; 2 ) the association with sunquakes .    the hmi / sdo observations and data reduction",
    "are discussed in  2 .",
    "detailed analysis is presented in  3 , followed by the summary and discussion in  4 .",
    "the primary data that we use for this study are images from sdo observations .",
    "there are two channels for wl observations available onboard sdo .",
    "the broad band observations centered at 4500    ( @xmath7 250   ) are provided by the atmospheric imaging assembly ( aia ) @xcite . however , this channel is operating in a guiding / alignment mode while providing very low cadence ( about one frame per hour ) , that is not useful for flare studies .",
    "the observations in visible light near 6173    presented in this study are based on the second channel , hmi / sdo observations .",
    "this instrument is an imaging spectrometer that takes images at six different spectral points at @xmath7 34  m , @xmath7 103  m  and @xmath7 172  m  around the fe i absorption line at 6173.34    ( referred as 6-point data hereafter ) .",
    "two types of calibrated data sets are analyzed , namely visible continuum and near real time ( nrt ) data . _",
    "the visible continuum images _ are actually _ derived _ from the 6-point data by fitting the line - profile of fe i 6173.34   . during the reconstruction process ,",
    "one set of 6-point data are integrated using a specific weighting function .",
    "consequently , artificial features may be introduced when generating difference images for flare studies @xcite . to avoid ambiguity , we select reference images at least four minutes before the flare and emphasize more on the qualitative analysis of the continuum emission . nevertheless , the hmi s continuum images are good proxies of wl usually obtained using broad band filters",
    ". we will use the words ` continuum ' and ` wl ' interchangeably hereafter .",
    "the image scale of the wl maps is 0.5  per pixel and the effective cadence is about @xmath8 seconds .",
    "the wl data is used for comparison with hxr emission and study of temporal evolution of the flares . _ the nrt data _ contains calibrated 6-point line profiles .",
    "different from wl data , it provides spectral information .",
    "hmi has two camera systems , the front one is used to produce the line - of - sight observables by scanning six wavelengths at two polarizations ( lcp and rcp ) . for each scan ,",
    "twelve images are obtained and are spatially aligned via a linearly interpolation with positive weightings @xcite .",
    "the side camera is used for retrieving the full stokes vectors .",
    "the nrt data investigated in this paper was taken by the front camera after spatial alignment provided by the hmi team .",
    "it is used for the multilayer analysis during the flare peak times .    as the direct diagnosis of electron beams ,",
    "rhessi @xcite hxr data is used to provide supplementary spatial / temporal information of the footpoints in flare i. rhessi detects hxr emission using nine rotating modulation collimators ( rmc ) .",
    "the rotation period is four seconds , which is basically the shortest time period to obtain an image .",
    "the spatial resolution depends on the choice of rmc combinations . by selecting the finest rmc # 1 ,",
    "one can achieve a spatial resolution of 2.2 @xcite .",
    "rmcs with larger numbers are thicker and able to absorb more hxr photons to get better statistics for imaging . in this study , rmc 1 - 7",
    "are selected for hxr imaging using clean method . in absence of rhessi during the second flare ,",
    "we use the time derivative of goes soft x - ray ( sxr ) light curve as the proxy of the hxr temporal variation .",
    "active region ( ar ) noaa 11283 produced two large flares from an identical location on september 6 and 7 , respectively . flare i on september 6 was classified as an x2.1 event . according to goes sxr record ,",
    "it was initiated around 22:12 ut and peaked at 22:20 ut . in the hxr , there were two consecutive peaks about three minutes apart . in the continuum ,",
    "we see two flare kernels which are typical for major flares . at the flare time , the active region was approximately located at n126@xmath9w290@xmath9 from the disk center .",
    "figure  [ f1 ] shows hmi continuum images with a fov ( 75   by 75 ) covering the sunspot group in ar 11283 .",
    "the upper - right panel was taken during the peak of the flare at 22:18:37 ut , on which the flare signal is not obvious in the raw data . by subtracting the reference image obtained before the flare ( upper - left panel ) , we see two flare kernels on the difference image ( lower - left panel ) . unlike the uv or h@xmath5 observations , the duration of continuum emission is much shorter . for this flare",
    ", the wl flare kernels can only be identified from five frames using the subtraction method .",
    "the light curve in wl is plotted together with the rhessi hxr and goes sxr light curves in figure  [ lc ] . in hxr",
    ", there are two major impulsive peaks three minutes apart . in the wl ,",
    "creating a light curve is more complicated .",
    "usually , the time sequence of difference images is obtained by subtracting a reference image . at this point ,",
    "the selection of reference images is crucial .",
    "for instance , a light curve with a pre - flare reference could differ significantly from a light curve with a post - flare reference due to some non - flare variations .",
    "in addition , selection of `` average light curve '' or `` maximum light curve '' is arbitrary , the former represents the variation of overall emission and the latter represents the time profile of core emission @xcite . to avoid any randomness of selecting reference and reduce the uncertainties involved in the alignments and normalization , we adopt a method of generating light curves by using the high order moments @xcite . in figure",
    "[ lc ] , the third order moment ( skewness ) , is used as a proxy of the intensity variation .",
    "we see one peak in the wl clearly but no fine structures due to the relatively low cadence ( 45 seconds ) comparing to hxr s four - second time resolution . nevertheless , the temporal correlation between wl and hxr is confirmed . to verify the spatial correlation between continuum and hxr sources , rhessi clean images",
    "are reconstructed using collimators 1 - 7 in an energy range of 50 - 100 kev .",
    "the time interval of each clean image is 30 seconds and overlaps with the hmi observing time .",
    "figure  [ wlhxr ] shows the continuum images with the hxr contours , from which we see that the source locations are almost identical .",
    "the slight off - set is probably due to the projection effect because the formation heights are different for hxr and wl emission@xmath10 ( estimated using equation 9 in @xcite ) .",
    "however the wl emission originates in the photosphere , where the column density reaches @xmath0@xmath10 @xcite . according to the val - f model @xcite , the height difference is at least 500 km . ] .",
    "we conclude that at hmi s resolution of @xmath11 per pixel , the hxr and wl sources occurred co - spatially and simultaneously .",
    "this result is expected as most of the previous observations have shown such a correlation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the wl emission reached its maximum at 19:19 ut .",
    "the strongest radiation came from the south kernel with a contrast enhancement of 24% , which is somehow lower than the previous observations by @xcite , in which the core enhancements were 45% in the green continuum at 5200   .",
    "note that @xcite observed an x10 flare which was much more energetic than this x2.1 flare .",
    "consequently , one would expect stronger electron flux penetrating down to the lower atmosphere and generating intensive emission in the continuum during that x10 flare .    during hxr and wl observations",
    ", we usually observe only one pair of the flare kernels , though exceptions are found in some special cases @xcite .",
    "this pair of conjugate footpoints could be the most intensive site of energy dissipation at a certain time .",
    "figure  [ size ] presents the flare kernels at the peak time in six spectral positions .",
    "the nrt spectral data is provided by the hmi team after proper alignment and normalization by their exposure time .",
    "both flare kernels are fitted by a two - dimensional gaussian function .",
    "similar to @xcite , the fwhm of the minor axis is calculated and defined as the ` size ' of each flare kernel . as we can see from table  [ kernelsize1 ] , there is an obvious trend by which the source size increases toward the line center for both the north and south kernels .",
    "such a wavelength - dependent size variation is consistent with the electron heating model as discussed by @xcite .",

    "the continuum emission obtained by hmi was well correlated with rhessi hxr observations in flare i. once again , this result confirms the close relationship between the wl emission and energetic electrons .",
    "the maximum intensity enhancements were 24% and 20% for the twin flares , which are moderate comparing with previous wl observations , ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the characteristic sizes of flare kernels were measured for both flares . at a certain time , for instance the flare maximum , the source size increased from the line wing to the line center .",
    "it is well known that the radiation from the line wing is formed lower than that from the line center .",
    "therefore , the wavelength - dependent size variation indicates that the flare kernels are smaller at lower atmosphere than those at higher layers .",
    "this result favors the direct heating model as discussed in @xcite",
    ".    \\4 . flares i and ii have similar properties in wl but flare i was not accompanied by a sunquake whereas flare ii was . in the literature , there are several models used to explain the physics of sunquakes : ( 1 ) earlier theories ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the electron beams can penetrate down to photosphere and generate sunquakes directly as predicted by @xcite .",
    "( 2 ) on the other hand , these electrons may affect photosphere through a secondary effect , such as back - warming effect or shock waves , and produce sunquakes @xcite .",
    "( 3 ) besides the electron - related models , there are some models that do not require electron beams to play an important role in producing sunquakes . @xcite analyzed the sunquake associated with an x2.2 flare on 2011 february 15 .",
    "the authors found that the sunquake sources are located far away from the flare center .",
    "the discovery suggests that the erupting flux ropes may have an effect on photosphere and generates sunquakes .",
    "( 4 ) based on private communications with dr .",
    "donea , we learned that sometimes pre - flare heating can create a favorable environment , such as appropriate temperature and density , for sunquakes . with this hypothesis ,",
    "a flare with pre - heating is more likely to be followed by a sunquake .",
    "( 5 ) another model that is not related to energetic particles is proposed by @xcite assuming that the magnetic reconfiguration may lead to a sunquake .    in summary ,",
    "we present two flares with similar pre - flare conditions and wl emission but only one flare is associated with the sunquake .",
    "we do not intend to distinguish a particular model from all the models discussed above .",
    "instead , we conclude that the particle precipitation may not be the only cause of the sunquake associated with flare ii .",
