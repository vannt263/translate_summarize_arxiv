    "the seiberg  witten invariants of a symplectic four  manifold can be calculated , according to taubes famous theorem @xcite , as gromov invariants enumerating embedded pseudo - holomorphic curves and their unramified coverings . in the presence of a _",
    "symplectic lefschetz fibration _ , the donaldson ",
    "smith invariants @xcite mediate between the gauge - theoretic and symplectic viewpoints .",
    "they are counts of pseudo - holomorphic multisections of the fibration , within a chosen homology class  more properly , of pseudo - holomorphic sections of an associated family of symmetric products of the non - singular fibres , appropriately compactified over the singular fibres .",
    "the motivating observation is that an embedded pseudo - holomorphic curve in the four  manifold , not having a fibre as a component , will have positive intersections with the fibres and so define a section of a family of symmetric products .    the equality of the donaldson  smith and gromov invariants , for fibrations of high degree , has been proved by usher @xcite . in the other direction ,",
    "the link between symmetric products and gauge theory arises from the fact that the dimensionally reduced seiberg ",
    "witten equations on a surface are the abelian vortex equations .",
    "the moduli space of solutions to these equations is a symmetric product of the surface ; in the ` adiabatic limit ' as the base of the fibration is expanded , solutions to the seiberg ",
    "witten equations approximate pseudo - holomorphic curves in the family of vortex moduli spaces @xcite .    in this paper and its sequel",
    "we extend the donaldson ",
    "smith construction in two directions .",
    "first , we generalise it to _ singular lefschetz fibrations _ in the sense of auroux , donaldson and katzarkov @xcite , objects which we shall refer to as ` broken fibrations ' .",
    "these are available on any four  manifold with @xmath1the point being that these are the manifolds which admit _ near - symplectic forms_. we construct an invariant of broken fibrations , the * lagrangian matching invariant * , which can be compared to the seiberg  witten invariant of the underlying manifold .",
    "we conjecture that equality holds .",
    "it still counts pseudo - holomorphic sections of the associated families of symmetric products , but these are now subject to certain lagrangian boundary conditions . much of this paper is concerned with the construction of these lagrangians , and with teasing out their properties .",
    "second , we show that the lagrangian matching invariant arises from a field theory : a @xmath2dimensional tqft coupled to singular surface - bundles . to a three",
    " manifold @xmath3 with a fibre bundle @xmath4 and a @xmath5structure @xmath6 ( subject to certain restrictions ) we assign a symplectic floer homology group @xmath7 , and when @xmath3 is the boundary of a broken fibration there is a relative lagrangian matching invariant in @xmath8 .    another use of our lagrangian boundary conditions is to define a floer homology group @xmath8 when @xmath9 is an @xmath0-valued morse function without local extrema .",
    "its euler characteristic is the turaev torsion .",
    "we shall explain the construction in a separate paper .",
    "the construction of lagrangian matching invariants was guided by taubes programme @xcite to obtain the seiberg ",
    "witten invariants of a near - symplectic four  manifold as generalised gromov invariants .",
    "however , making a rigorous comparison presents considerable challenges ( besides the matter of precisely defining the generalised gromov invariants ) ; there is no ` tautological correspondence ' in the sense of usher @xcite .",
    "it may be worth emphasising that , in contrast to taubes framework , the technical difficulties in the pseudo - holomorphic theory underlying our invariants from our moduli spaces are rather mild , at least if one does not aim for the greatest conceivable generality . rather , the difficulty in formulating these invariants was in finding good moduli spaces to consider .",
    "it seems to be typical of theories based on symmetric products that there are technical gains in the pseudo - holomorphic theory , and in manifest functoriality , but a loss in explicitness which can make computations hard .",
    "( a strength of heegaard floer homology is that it strikes an effective balance between these aspects . )",
    "the conjectural equality of lagrangian matching and seiberg  witten invariants has the flavour of an ` atiyah ",
    "floer ' conjecture . for a start",
    ", the lagrangian boundary conditions , which we construct by direct symplectic means , may well have a gauge - theoretic interpretation arising from the seiberg ",
    "witten equations on a three  manifold with boundary ( see remark [ gauge lags ] ) .",
    "it would be more interesting , though , to find a _",
    "( tqft ) reason for equality , in the vein of donaldson s argument in @xcite .",
    "there is a rather direct link with heegaard floer homology , and also with yi - jen lee s programme to relate it to monopole floer homology @xcite , which will be developed in a future article .",
    "as mentioned above , the lagrangian boundary conditions studied in the present paper , and used to define the lagrangian matching invariants in its sequel , can also be employed to define symplectic floer homology groups for a three  manifold with an @xmath0-valued morse function all of whose critical points have indefinite indices ( @xmath10 or @xmath11 ) .",
    "now , given a _ self  indexing _ morse function @xmath12 on @xmath13 , the connected sum @xmath14 carries such an @xmath0-valued morse function : one thinks of @xmath15 as the result of removing two balls in @xmath3 containing the maximum and minimum , and gluing back @xmath16\\times s^2 $ ] .",
    "one considers only those @xmath5structures @xmath6 on @xmath17 such that @xmath18 evaluates as @xmath11 on a 2sphere in the added handle .",
    "the lagrangian boundary conditions which we use to define our floer homologies then reduce ( up to smooth isotopy , and probably also up to hamiltonian isotopy ) to the heegaard tori @xmath19 , @xmath20 in @xmath21 , where @xmath22 .",
    "this viewpoint may give some insight into the cobordism maps in heegaard floer homology , which can be computed as lagrangian matching invariants for broken fibrations of a particular kind .",

    "for some @xmath113 , @xmath114 passes through the first isolated critical value , and @xmath115 changes by adding a 2-handle along @xmath76 ( with framing given by the fibre - framing minus 1 ) .",

    "these maps yield @xmath95 and @xmath122 , the second of which does not have even intersection form .",
    "a notion closely related to broken fibrations is that of ` broken pencils ' :    a * broken pencil * is a triple @xmath123 , where @xmath124 is a discrete subset , and @xmath125 a map whose critical points conform to the models in points ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) of definition [ bf ] , and satisfy the condition ( 3 ) .",

    "the fibres over one hemisphere are certainly connected . ) * auroux  donaldson ",
    "katzarkov s sequences of broken pencils seem not to be ` asymptotically unique ' .",
    "how are different sequences of pencils on the same manifold related ?",
    "a more elementary problem is to write down a set of ` moves ' which generate many broken fibrations starting from a given one .",
    "example [ klein ] can easily be adapted to give a procedure which increases by 1 the genus of the fibres of a given fibration over a small disc , and does not change the diffeomorphism - type .",
    "this provides one such move . * which smooth four  manifolds support broken pencils if we drop the cohomological condition ( 4 ) ?",
    "( all of them ? )",
    "a development relevant to the second and third questions has occured since the first version of this paper appeared : gay and kirby @xcite have produced _ achiral _ broken fibrations ( not usually satisfying condition ( 4 ) ) on arbitrary smooth closed four  manifolds .",
    "any embedded surface of self - intersection zero can be realised as a fibre , and its framing can apparently be chosen at will ; so , for example , both homotopy classes of maps @xmath138 are represented by achiral broken fibrations .",
