    "quantization is a phenomenon that changes our bright classical perspective into a bit uncertain and at first sight rather nonintuitive picture .",
    "this picture , however , is more rigorous than the classical one , possesses many fascinating features and has produced a lot of successful predictions .",
    "the subtle problem of transition from classical to quantal attracts attention from the early days of quantum mechanics . over the years",
    "various techniques and methods for solving this puzzle have been invented .",
    "our aim is not to trace back the complete ( hi)story of the milestone ideas in this field ( for the review we refer to @xcite ) .",
    "what we want to do is to give a concise exposition of the method we have developed .",
    "however , since we have generalized the original feynman s path integral approach , we will recapitulate this approach shortly in section [ 2 ] .",
    "the main goal of our paper is to obtain a functional integral formula for the quantum propagator which would not refer to lagrangian and/or hamiltonian function .",
    "quantum propagator is the probability amplitude @xmath3 for the transition of the system from the initial configuration @xmath4 to the final configuration @xmath5 .",
    "we will derive a closed expression for this quantity starting from the given set of classical dynamical equations of motion .",
    "the proposed method uses functional integration in the extended phase space , but instead of integration over path histories we introduce integration over stringy surfaces .",
    "this crucial element of our approach is explained in full detail in sections [ 3 ] and [ 4 ] and in appendices [ a ] and [ b ] .",
    "we also make sure that whenever the system under consideration becomes lagrangian , the stringy description reduces to the standard one with the feynman path integral .    in sections [ 4.1 ] and [ 4.2 ]",
    "some simple examples are scrutinized .",
    "it is well known that there are classical dynamical systems that can not be described within the traditional lagrangian or hamiltonian framework .",
    "the stringy approach enables us to quantize them straightforwardly . in section",
    "[ 4.1 ] the quantization of a weakly non - lagrangian system is performed .",
    "the transition amplitude is computed for a particle in a conservative field , whose motion is damped by a general @xmath0-power friction force @xmath6 .",
    "the stringy results for @xmath7 are compared with the results obtained in the approaches by caldirola - kanai @xcite , bateman @xcite and kostin @xcite .",
    "one can argue against the stringy quantization of dissipative systems that it is unable to describe decoherence phenomena .",
    "this is true , but the same objection can be raised against the generally accepted heuristic approaches by the authors cited above , as well as those by dekker @xcite , razavy @xcite , geicke @xcite and others , simply because their kinematical and dynamical prerequisites are different from the prerequisites of the particle - plus - environment quantum models .",
    "however , a possible argument for the stringy quantization is that the particle - plus - environment models are not able to handle satisfactorily the case with the friction force @xmath1 for the general power @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , they describe a rather different phenomenon , namely the quantum brownian motion for which the total force equals @xmath8 .    section [ 4.2 ] contains the analysis of a curious two - dimensional douglas system @xcite which is strongly non - lagrangian , i.e. not derivable from any sort of lagrangian or hamiltonian .",
    "this causes a fundamental problem for all conventional quantization methods , but can be dealt with in a rather transparent way in the stringy approach .    in section",
    "[ 5 ] conclusion , discussion and outlook are collected .",
    "the section also includes some comments on the relation between the stringy quantization and the caldeira - leggett model of quantum brownian motion @xcite , as well as the influence functional technique by feynman and vernon @xcite .",
    "some rather technical material is left to appendices .",
    "appendix [ a ] is devoted to the stringy variational principle , which plays an important role in the motivation of our approach . in appendix [ b ]",
    "computational details concerning the surface functional integral for quantum friction force systems are presented .",
    "historically the first attempt at quantization based on the dynamical equations of motion belongs to feynman , see @xcite .",
    "a similar problem was considered by wigner , yang @xmath9 feldman , nelson , okubo and others , see @xcite . among the recent investigations in this field",
    "let us mention the work of lyakhovich @xmath9 sharapov @xcite and gitman @xmath9 kupriyanov @xcite .",
    "they consider the same problem as us , but their strategy is different . in our opinion , their approach fits much better the context of gauge field dynamics .",
    "as ludwig faddeev noted during the edward witten s talk at the * * mathematical physics conference : from xx to xxi century * * , _ quantization is not a science , quantization is an art_. let us believe that the quantization method proposed here will fit the ludwig s dictum and will be meaningful enough to be considered artistic .",
    "according to feynman @xcite , the probability amplitude of the transition of the system from the space - time configuration @xmath4 to another space - time configuration @xmath5 is @xmath10 \\exp{\\bigl\\{\\frac{i}{\\hslash}\\int\\limits_{\\tilde{\\gamma}}\\hspace{-1mm}pdq - hdt\\bigr\\}}\\,.\\ ] ] here the integral is taken over all paths ( histories ) @xmath11 in the extended phase space , , the canonically conjugated momenta @xmath12 and the time coordinate @xmath13 ( the index @xmath14 runs from 1 to the number of degrees of freedom @xmath15 ) .",

    "satisfying the conditions @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the preexponential factor @xmath22 in the expression ( [ feynmani ] ) serves just the normalization . to fix it",
    "properly we impose two physical conditions on the transition amplitude .",
    "first we introduce an integral condition that ensures that the total probability is conserved ,    [ normalization ] @xmath23 this specifies the absolute value of @xmath24 .",
    "then we add a constraint that expresses the obvious fact that no evolution takes place if the final time @xmath25 approaches the initial time @xmath26 , @xmath27    this determines the phase of @xmath24 .    a miraculous consequence of the definition of the transition amplitude ( [ feynmani ] ) ( not an additional requirement ! )",
    "is that it satisfies the evolutionary chain rule , or chapman - kolmogorov equation , @xmath28 the infinitesimal version of this formula is the celebrated schrdinger equation .",
    "quantum states of the system are described by the square integrable functions with the standard hilbert space structure .",
    "physical observables are hermitian operators acting on such functions . given the state @xmath29 at the initial moment @xmath26 one is able to predict the state @xmath30 at any later moment @xmath31 according to the formula @xmath32 in what follows it is assumed that the above concept of states , observables and quantum evolution is valid for the stringy quantization of non - lagrangian systems as well . the only new element is a modified prescription for the evolutionary integral kernel @xmath3 .",
    "the same kinematical prerequisites can be found also in other phenomenological approaches @xcite-@xcite .",
    "a possible step beyond the theory summarized above consists in the elimination of the hamiltonian function @xmath33 from formula ( [ feynmani ] ) .",
    "the price to be paid is the replacement of the path integration by the surface functional integration .",
    "our aim is to construct the amplitude for the transition between @xmath4 and @xmath5 starting from the classical equations of motion ( and not from the hamiltonian function which provides them ) @xmath34 in the first set of equations , @xmath35 is the mass of the particle .",
    "we restricted ourselves to the simplest case of one particle , although it is trivial to generalize the theory to a system with an arbitrary number of particles .",
    "note also that if the particle is unconstrained and we make use of cartesian coordinates , the momenta @xmath36 defined in ( [ eq . ] ) reduce to @xmath12 .",
    "suppose that there exists a unique classical trajectory in the extended phase space @xmath37 , connecting the points @xmath4 and @xmath5",
    ". then we can assign to any other trajectory @xmath11 , which enters the path integral in ( [ feynmani ] ) , two auxiliary curves @xmath38 the curves are parameterized by the parameter @xmath39 $ ] and live in the momentum subsectors of the extended phase space with fixed @xmath4 and @xmath5 , see figure [ umbilic ] .",

    "one of them , denoted as @xmath45 , is drawn in the figure.,width=321,height=422 ]    using these definitions one can write and @xmath46 give trivially zero contributions to the contour integral , since on both @xmath43 s @xmath47 and @xmath48 . ]",
    "@xmath49 where @xmath44 is a contour in the extended phase space consisting of four curves @xmath42 , @xmath41 , @xmath50 , @xmath40 .",
    "the first integral on the right hand side is the classical action @xmath51 ( its equivalent for the non - lagrangian case will be specified later ) , while the second integral can be rewritten as @xmath52 where @xmath45 is a surface spanning the contour @xmath53 , i. e. a map from the parametric space @xmath54\\times[0,1]$ ] to the extended phase space , @xmath55 satisfying @xmath56 the surface @xmath45 can be viewed as a worldsheet of a string , therefore we will call the quantization method using such surfaces `` stringy . ''",
    "partial derivatives of the hamiltonian function entering the integral over @xmath45 can be eliminated with the help of the equations of motion ( [ eq . ] ) . by doing so ,",
    "one transforms ( [ loop ] ) into the following form : @xmath57 where the two - form @xmath58 is defined as @xmath59 this two - form is an object in the extended phase space and its structure can be read out from the underlying equations of motion .",
    "note that for non - potential forces the expression @xmath60 does not reduce to @xmath61 , so that the two - form @xmath58 is not closed .",
    "this becomes essential in the next subsection .",
    "it is obvious that for a given pair of histories @xmath62 there exist infinitely many @xmath45-surfaces such that @xmath63 .",
    "all of them form a set which we will call @xmath64 . and",

    "the @xmath72ection is simply the momentum forgetting map , or to put it in a more elevated way , the canonical projection from the cotangent bundle to the base manifold .",

    "some surfaces from @xmath82 are depicted in figure [ string ] . in ( [ feynmaniii ] ) , the undetermined constant @xmath84",

    "the two open surfaces belong to two different stringy classes @xmath64 , while the closed and the shrunk surface are both elements of the same stringy class @xmath86 .",
    "as the worldsheet @xmath45 varies , the front and rear boundary curves , denoted in the text @xmath87 and @xmath46 , vary as well.,width=321,height=422 ]",
    "in case the hamiltonian function @xmath33 is given , the formula ( [ feynmaniii ] ) for the propagator is equivalent to the feynman formula ( [ feynmani ] ) we have started with .",
    "the surface functional integral ( [ feynmaniii ] ) is however completely free of @xmath33 and requires just the knowledge of the classical equations of motion .",
    "this observation allows us to postulate ( [ feynmaniii ] ) as a quantization tool in situations in which one can not use the standard hamiltonian approach .",
    "we just have to relax the requirement of the closedness of the two - form @xmath58 , following from the definition of @xmath58 for hamiltonian systems .",
    "this relaxation is what is hidden behind the slightly provocative phrase _",
    "one more step beyond _ in the title of this subsection .",
    "the problematic part here is the definition of the classical action @xmath51 for non - lagrangian systems .",
    "later we will see that in some specific situations this quantity can be read out from the structure of the surface integral @xmath88\\exp{\\bigl\\{\\frac{i } { \\hslash}\\int\\limits_{\\sigma}\\omega\\bigr\\}}\\,.\\ ] ] another possibility which comes to mind is to use the integrating factor of the generally non - closed two - form @xmath58 .",
    "this means that one will look for a function @xmath89 on the extended phase space such that @xmath90 .",
    "if the structure of the dynamical equations allows for such a function ( i.e. the forces satisfy the helmholtz condition ) then we can define a local auxiliary hamiltonian @xmath91 such that @xmath92 . having @xmath91 we can define the auxiliary classical action @xmath93 . the alternative approach which tries to identify @xmath94 with @xmath93",
    "has , however , several substantial disadvantages .",
    "first of all , the procedure of finding @xmath95 ( and subsequently @xmath91 and @xmath93 ) is highly ambiguous .",
    "furthermore , @xmath93 lacks symmetries that were originally present in the equations of motion . because of these findings we do not follow this strategy hereinafter .    from the physical point of view the dynamical equations seem to be more fundamental than their compact but ambiguous precursors , hamiltonian and/or lagrangian function , see @xcite .",
    "since ( [ feynmaniii ] ) requires just the knowledge of the equations of motion , it determines the transition amplitude in a completely new way .",
    "our proposal for the transition amplitude has appeared here out of thin air . actually , we were rewriting ( [ feynmani ] ) in terms of stringy surfaces and then , when realizing that the integrated function can be written without any reference to the hamiltonian , we postulated formula ( [ feynmaniii ] ) to be valid in general . however , this is not the whole story .",
    "the stringy functional quantization can be motivated also by the stringy variational principle .",
    "having the dynamical equations and initial and final endpoints , one can form @xmath82 and @xmath58 . then using these objects",
    "one can introduce the stringy action functional @xmath96 this is a variational problem with varying boundaries , therefore the total variation has two terms .",
    "first one specifies the boundary and determines the initial equations of motion for @xmath83 .",
    "the second one specifies the bulk of the stationary world - sheet @xmath45 ( which turns out to be shrunk into @xmath83 itself ) .",
    "moreover , one immediately verifies that in the special case when @xmath97 , the stringy variational principle reduces ( up to an additive constant ) to the celebrated hamilton least action principle .",
    "of course , many subtleties were omitted here , but all of them can be found in @xcite , or in appendix [ a ] .",
    "thus , our variational principle enables us to perform the limit @xmath98 , in which we recover the original classical dynamics as required .",
    "to examine the functionality of the proposed quantization method let us first analyze the simplest friction force system .",
    "it consists of a particle with unit mass , moving in one dimension under the action of the conservative force @xmath99 and the friction force @xmath100 .. the universally applicable expression is @xmath1010.5 mm sgn@xmath102 . ] thus , @xmath103 in this example the surface functional integral can be calculated explicitly ( for more detail see @xcite , or appendix [ b ] ) . in the course of calculation , the surface functional integral in the extended phase space reduces to path integral in the configuration space , @xmath104\\exp{\\bigl\\{\\frac{i}{\\hslash } \\int\\limits_{\\sigma}\\omega\\bigr\\}}\\propto\\nonumber\\label{dissipative}\\\\ & & \\propto\\exp{\\bigl\\{-\\frac{i}{\\hslash}\\int\\limits_{t_0}^{t_1}\\bigl(\\tfrac{1}{2}\\dot{q}_{cl}^2-u(q_{cl})- \\kappa q_{cl}p^{a}_{cl}\\bigr)dt\\bigr\\}}\\times\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times\\int[\\mathscr{d}q]\\exp{\\bigl\\{\\frac{i}{\\hslash}\\int\\limits_{t_0}^{t_1}\\bigl(\\tfrac{1}{2}\\dot{q}^2-u(q)- \\kappa qp^{a}_{cl}\\bigr)dt\\bigr\\}}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this combined with the formula ( [ feynmaniii ] ) suggests that it will be convenient to define the classical action as in the subscript @xmath105 , as well as in the subscript @xmath106 introduced later , refers to the power in the expression for the friction force . ]",
    "@xmath107 when doing so , we obtain a controlled cancelation of @xmath108 with the preexponential factor arising from ( [ disi ] ) .",
    "the final probability amplitude then assumes a compact and reasonable form : @xmath109\\exp{\\bigl\\{\\frac{i}{\\hslash } \\hspace{-0.5mm}\\int\\limits_{t_0}^{t_1}\\hspace{-0.5mm}\\bigl(\\tfrac{1}{2}\\dot{q}^2-\\hspace{-0.2 mm } u(q)-\\hspace{-0.2mm}\\kappa qp^{a}_{cl}\\bigr)dt\\bigr\\}}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the preexponential factor @xmath110 can in principle be obtained by subjecting @xmath111 to the conditions ( [ normalization ] ) .",
    "let us explain why one should consider the propagator formula ( [ propagator ] ) reasonable",
    ". in the path integral above there appears an unconventional `` external source '' term @xmath112 .",
    "its appearance guarantees that the quantum dynamics governed by @xmath111 transforms into classical mechanics in the limit @xmath113 .",
    "this follows from the simple fact that the unique solution of the saddle point equation for the path integral ( [ propagator ] ) , @xmath114 which satisfies the given initial and final conditions @xmath115 and @xmath116 , is the classical trajectory @xmath117 .",
    "the external source term in ( [ propagator ] ) breaks the validity of the chapman - kolmogorov ( memoryless ) equation . )",
    "can be viewed as a sort of additional time - dependent potential , therefore one would expect that the chapman - kolmogorov equation ( [ ch - k ] ) will be satisfied . however",
    ", this argument is not applicable in the present situation .",
    "the point is that if we merge two paths _ kl _ and _ lm _ into a new path _ km _ , then the time - dependent potentials @xmath118 and @xmath119 differ , for a general position of @xmath120 , from the potential @xmath121 in the corresponding time ( sub)intervals , @xmath122 \\atop -\\kappa qp^a_{cl - lm}(t)\\ \\mbox{for}\\ t\\in[t_l , t_m]}\\ ] ] since this differs substantially from the standard case , the argument about the validity of the chapman - kolmogorov equation can not be used . ] from the physical point of view it is a desired phenomenon .",
    "the microscopic origin of friction is some environmental interaction .",
    "this , however , was not accounted for here explicitly .",
    "what has been considered is some effective ( macroscopic , phenomenological ) interaction emerging on the classical level only .",
    "microscopically the system is a part of a larger system and hence it should be affected by the memory effect .",
    "it is not difficult to compute @xmath111 for the general power @xmath0 and the potentials @xmath123 and @xmath124 . in both cases we can carry out the path integration in ( [ propagator ] ) explicitly to obtain @xmath125 where the non - lagrangian action @xmath126 is given by the expression ( [ a - action ] ) .",
    "an open problem is to determine the preexponential factor @xmath127 for all powers @xmath0 except for @xmath2 ( at least the author is incapable to do that ) .",
    "if @xmath128 , the preexponential factor is apparently dependent not only on the time difference @xmath129 , but also on the endpoint positions @xmath130 and @xmath131",
    ". this hypothesis is supported by the results obtained in @xcite , where the path integral for a non - conservative force quadratic in velocity is calculated . the normalization prefactor which appears there is explicitly dependent on the endpoints positions as well as on @xmath129 .    in what follows",
    "we will restrict ourself to the case when the power @xmath0 is equal to 1 .",
    "this simplified setup enables us to compare the stringy approach with the caldirola - kanai , bateman and kostin approaches .",

    "moreover , one immediately verifies that in the frictionless limit @xmath140 both transition amplitudes coincide with the free particle propagator .",
