    "the two - level atom has become over the years the basic building block with which one describes resonant and near - resonant radiative excitation of atoms and molecules  or any system that has discrete quantum states all75,sho90 .",
    "when the radiation emanates from a laser , and therefore retains temporal coherence , the relevant dynamics is governed by the time - dependent schrdinger equation . within the usual rotating - wave approximation ( rwa ) sho90 , the needed mathematics is that of two coupled linear ordinary differential equations for two complex - valued time - dependent probability amplitudes .",
    "the relative simplicity of these two equations has enabled researchers to find a variety of analytic solutions , descriptive both of steady radiation intensity and pulsed excitation by a variety of analytic forms for the pulses .",
    "in essence , one is able to map the physics of the two - level atom , under suitable conditions , onto the wealth of special functions studied by 19th century mathematicians .",
    "this basic two - state atom has an interesting extension , from a nondegenerate two - level system ( one with just two quantum states  ground and excited ) , to one with a degenerate ground level and a degenerate excited level .",
    "this situation occurs quite commonly for isolated atoms and molecules ; these can be taken to be in states of well defined angular momentum @xmath3 , for which rotational symmetry produces a degeneracy of @xmath4 magnetic sublevels . in rwa",
    "the degeneracies can also occur for more general multistate quantum systems , as we shall note .    for laser - induced transitions between states of angular momentum",
    ", one must consider the several magnetic sublevels , labeled by @xmath5 , that may occur as possible initial states .",
    "each of them has a possible laser - driven excitation route into excited magnetic sublevels . if the angular momenta of the ground level and the excited level are , respectively , @xmath3 and @xmath6 ( with @xmath7 or @xmath8 for electric - dipole transitions ) , and if all excited magnetic sublevels are linked with some ground level , then in general one must consider @xmath9 probability amplitudes , coupled to one another by radiative interactions",
    ".    for general polarization of the laser field selection rules restrict the change in magnetic quantum number to quantum states whose magnetic quantum numbers @xmath5  and @xmath10 differ by @xmath11 , 0 or + 1 . for an arbitrary choice of quantization axis , and elliptically polarized light",
    ", the excitation can take place via all of these linkages .",
    "however , when the polarization is more specialized , to linear or circular , then it is possible to choose a quantization axis such that these coupled equations become a set of @xmath4 pairs of independent two - state equations .",
    "the choice of quantization axis , together with the properties of the rotation matrix of angular momentum states , makes this possible . for such situations",
    "the mathematics is much simpler : one need only find a set of independent solutions to the nondegenerate two - state systems .    in 1983",
    "morris and shore showed @xcite that this coordinate transformation was a special case of a more general transformation that could produce , for any two degenerate sets of quantum states , an equivalent description involving only independent uncoupled pairs of equations .",
    "specifically , the morris - shore ( ms ) transformation reduces the coherent quantum dynamics of a coupled degenerate two - level system to a set of independent nondegenerate two - state systems and a number of uncoupled ( dark ) states .",
    "it prescribes a simple recipe , which only requires to find the eigenvalues and the eigenstates of a hermitean matrix , which is a product of interaction matrices .",
    "the eigenstates are the ms states ( i.e. the states representing the independent two - state systems and the dark states ) , and the eigenvalues are the ms interactions in the independent ms two - state systems .",
    "the ms  transformation requires that all initial interactions be constant , or share the same time dependence , and that all interactions are resonant , or equally detuned from the upper states , so that each pair of interactions are on two - photon resonance with the corresponding states ; the latter condition implies that the lower set of states is degenerate in rwa sense , and so is the upper set of states .",
    "the ms transformation has been used extensively in various excitation scenarios to handle seemingly complicated linkages .",
    "for instance , it has been used to derive exact analytic solutions that extend known two - state solutions to degenerate two - state systems @xcite .",
    "it has been used to design schemes for complete population transfer between degenerate states @xcite and for creation of coherent superpositions of states @xcite .",
    "the ms transformation has been also a crucial analytic method in creating recipes for efficient discrete quantum state tomography @xcite .",
    "there are many situations in which one is interested in transitions that link not just two states but a chain - like sequence of multilevel excitations .",
    "typically these form an @xmath0-level ladder linkage pattern , involving with each link a separate laser field .",
    "when such a system has degeneracy only from angular momentum , and when the pulses all share a common time - dependent envelope ( though not the same carrier frequencies ) , and when the polarizations are all linear or circular , then it is possible to choose the ( arbitrary ) quantization axis such that the entire excitation scheme can be reduced to @xmath4  sets of @xmath0  coupled equations , where @xmath3is the angular momentum of the initially populated level .",
    "it is natural to ask whether the ms transformation of two levels has a generalization to @xmath0-level ladders .",
    "we here answer this question affirmatively , with the proviso of certain conditions , and describe the procedure for finding the transformation .",
    "such a transformation allows one to use the well - known analytic solutions of the @xmath0-state ladder bia77,ebe77a , sho81b as an extension of the utilization of analytic two - state solutions .",

    "the matrix @xmath18 is a @xmath14-dimensional square diagonal matrix , which can be represented as a constant multiple of the @xmath14-dimensional unit matrix @xmath19 , @xmath20 .",
    "the absence of off - diagonal elements in @xmath18 reflects the absence of direct couplings between the @xmath15 states , while the common diagonal elements @xmath21 stand for the common detunings of all the @xmath15 states : by definition , @xmath22 is the difference between the bohr transition frequency and the laser carrier frequency .",

    "( [ ham ] ) , it is assumed that there are no relaxation processes during the interaction .",
    "although we shall discuss this hamiltonian within the framework of angular momentum degeneracy , the results are applicable much more generally , to linkage patterns between nondegenerate states , as will occur when there are several different laser frequencies , each resonant ( or near resonant ) with a particular transition .",
    "when such situations are eligible for description by a multilevel rwa @xcite , and when the carrier frequencies are such that at most two nonzero detunings occur in the rwa hamiltonian , then the ms transformation can be used .",
    "specifically , morris and shore have shown morris83 that any rwa - degenerate two - level system , in which all couplings share the same time dependence , can be reduced with a constant unitary transformation to an equivalent system comprising only independent two - state systems and uncoupled ( dark ) states , as shown in fig .",

    "one special example for conditions ( [ conditions.example ] ) is when the left- and right - polarized fields for the lower transition have the same intensity and the same phase ( @xmath202 ) , and the linearly - polarized field is shifted in phase by @xmath203 with respect to them ; then @xmath204 .",
    "no restrictions are imposed on the couplings of the upper transition in this case .    in another simple example ,",
    "the left- and right - polarized fields for the lower transition have the same intensity ( @xmath205 ) and the same applies for the upper transition ( @xmath206 ) , and all interactions are real .    :",
    "the ms decomposition produces two independent nondegenerate three - state systems and two uncoupled ( dark ) states in the @xmath207 set.,width=177 ]      if the commutation relation ( [ commutator ] ) is satisfied then the hamiltonian in the ms basis reads@xmath208 .",
    "\\label{h - example}\\]]by rearranging the states , it is readily seen that there are two independent three - state systems driven by hamiltonians of the form ( [ h3 ] ) ( @xmath209 ) , with ms couplings @xmath210 and @xmath211 given by eqs .",

    "the results for the three - level ms transformation are readily extended to @xmath0 degenerate levels . for each transition @xmath212 ( @xmath213 ) , described by an interaction matrix @xmath214 , time envelope @xmath215 of all fields in this transition , and common detuning @xmath216 , we form the matrices @xmath217 . the @xmath0-level mstransformation exists if @xmath218 = \\mathsf{o}\\text{\\textsf{\\ ( } } n=2,3, ...",
    ",n-1\\text{\\textsf{% ) . } }   \\label{commutation}\\]]the relations ( [ commutation ] ) imply that the interactions for any two adjacent transitions @xmath212 and @xmath219 must be such that , after the ms transformation , the resulting ms states of the common level of these two transitions are the same for the lower and upper transitions ; mathematically this is ensured by the commutation of @xmath220 and @xmath221 .    if conditions ( [ commutation ] ) are satisfied , the ms transformation will produce sets of independent nondegenerate @xmath0-state systems , @xmath222-state systems , and so on , and a number of uncoupled states , depending on the particular system .",
    "in this paper , we have presented an extension of the ms transformation to three and more degenerate levels . for two degenerate sets of states the ms transformation always exists , as long as the couplings have the same time dependence and the same detunings . for three sets of states , the ms transformation may or may not exist , depending of the commutation of products of interaction matrices .",
    "when applicable , the ms transformation reduces the coupled multistate dynamics into a set of independent three - state systems , a set of independent two - state systems , and a number of uncoupled ( dark ) states .",
    "the number of states in each set depends on the degeneracy of the three initial sets of states .",
    "these results readily extend to @xmath0 degenerate levels , with similar commutation conditions on the interactions .",
    "it is important that each set of states have the same rwa detuning , but this may differ from set to set .",
    "the couplings between the first and second set must have the same time dependence , and the same condition must apply between the second and third set ; the two time dependences , however , may be different , as in stirap @xcite .",
    "this condition extends to @xmath0 degenerate levels as well .",
    "it is also important that any time dependence of the interactions is factored out of the commutation condition ( [ commutation ] ) and therefore , for instance , different time dependence of the transition @xmath188 with respect to the transition @xmath189 is possible .",
    "however , within each degenerate transition ( @xmath188 , @xmath189 , @xmath150 ) the time dependence must be the same ; otherwise couplings appear between the ms states in each manifold , which create linkages between the independent ms subsystems and the ms decomposition does not occur .",
    "if all detunings are zero ( i.e. if all fields are on exact resonance with the respective transition frequency ) and all fields share the same time dependence , the degenerate @xmath0-level system is reducible to a degenerate two - level system ; then the original ms transformation decouples the interaction dynamics into a set of independent nondegenerate two - state systems and a set of dark states .    in the interesting special case of a three - level ladder with a single nondegenerate intermediate state",
    ", the ms transformation always exists , with no restrictions on the couplings ( apart from the identical time dependence ) .",
    "the ms transformation produces a single linked chain , together with additional uncoupled states .",
    "it is significant that the ms transformation , in producing a simplification of the original linkage pattern of interactions , introduces coherent superpositions of the original basis states . in this ms basis",
    "the dynamics appears very simple , and one can evaluate the conditions for producing complete population transfer , for example .",
    "such transitions correspond , in the original basis , to transitions between coherent superposition states . when the initial state is nondegenerate then only the intermediate and final states of the transitions involve superposition states . under such circumstances",
    "one can design pulse sequences that produce a specified superposition .",
