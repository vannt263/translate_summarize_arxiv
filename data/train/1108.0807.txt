    "this can lead to many very unusual transport properties of this material @xcite .",
    "one of examples is the unusual integer quantum hall effect in graphene .",
    "as found theoretically and confirmed experimentally @xcite there is no @xmath1 plateau , which is related to the dirac point in the electronic spectrum .",
    "the other very important property is that the landau splitting is very strong in graphene , which makes it possible to observe the quantum hall effect at room temperatures @xcite .",
    "recently , we proposed to use a periodic magnetic field for quantization of the electron energy spectrum of two - dimensional electron gas @xcite .",
    "our calculations demonstrated that periodically alternating field leads to an energy spectrum with a number of minibands separated by energy gaps .",
    "in such system , the anomalous hall effect ( ahe ) is nonzero , and it is quantized if the chemical potential is located within the gap .",
    "it was also suggested @xcite that the realization of such structure under periodic magnetic field can be easily achieved by using a lattice of magnetic nanorods @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that another possible way is to use the 2d skyrmion lattice @xcite , which have been recently observed in thin layers of helical magnets ( however , in this case the temperature should be rather low ) @xcite .",
    "graphene has obvious advantages to be used instead of semiconducting quantum well with two - dimensional electron spectrum .",
    "graphene is naturally two - dimensional , and the technology of graphene - based structures is much simpler .",
    "besides , one can expect much stronger effects related to the magnetic quantization due to the specific parameters of graphene .    in this work",
    "we calculate the electron energy spectrum and the chern numbers characterizing topological properties of the energy bands .",
    "the results are essentially different for graphene as compare to the 2d electron gas with parabolic energy spectrum .",
    "we find that the chern numbers of the bands corresponding to higher - in - energy excitations of electrons and holes are zero at sufficiently large field . on the contrary ,",
    "the low - energy bands of electrons and holes have nonzero chern numbers , which results in the quantized anomalous hall effect .",
    "we start with a generalized model , which includes the relativistic hamiltonian @xcite describing the electron energy spectrum near the dirac points @xmath2 in the brillouin zone of graphene ( fig .",
    "1a ) and an additional term leading to the gap @xmath3 where the components of vector @xmath4 are the pauli matrices acting in the space of graphene sublattices .",
    "introducing the gap parameter @xmath5 makes the a and b sites different in the crystal lattice of graphene .",
    "physically , it can be the case of different atoms in the honeycomb lattice like in two - dimensional boron nitride .",
    "the model with @xmath6 can be also realized for graphene in periodic electric and magnetic fields discussed in ref .",
    "[ ] . in the case of graphene we should put @xmath7 but for pedagogical reasons it is instructive to start from @xmath6 .",
    "the vector potential @xmath8 describes the effect of magnetic field .",
    "we assume that the graphene sheet is in the periodically alternating magnetic field in @xmath9 direction . in our analytical calculations",
    "we consider one - harmonic approach , @xmath10 , where the in - plane vectors @xmath11 can be viewed as basic vectors of the triangular lattice . in the numerical calculations we include more harmonics to make the consideration realistic , preserving the triangular symmetry of the field - imposed lattice .",
    "one can use the gauge in which the correspondent vector potential is also periodic , @xmath12 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the unit vector along axis @xmath9 perpendicular to the plane .",
    "we also assume that the period @xmath15 of alternating field is much much larger than the lattice constant of graphene @xmath16 .",
    "the large scale field - induced triangular lattice determines the corresponding small brillouin zone in the inverse space ( fig .",
    "1b ) , and we denote the symmetry points of this zone by @xmath17 , @xmath18 , etc .",
    "it should be stressed that these points are not related in any way to the symmetry points of the brillouin zone of graphene , which we denote like @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "let us assume @xmath5 very small and positive , @xmath21 . in the case of weak periodic field , the term with @xmath8 in ( 1 ) is a weak perturbation .",
    "we consider first the states related to the dirac point @xmath19 . for @xmath22 ,",

    "correspondingly , for the @xmath20 point the results are @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "these results can be understood using the symmetry of hamiltonian ( 1 ) .",
    "indeed , the transition from @xmath19 to @xmath20 with simultaneous reversion of the sign of @xmath5 is related to the symmetry under the unitary transformation ( rotation in sublattice space ) @xmath59 such transformation applied to the wavefunctions does not change the berry phase ( 6 ) .",
    "therefore , the corresponding chern numbers should be equal , @xmath60 besides , changing the sign of field ( i.e. , @xmath61 ) in ( 1 ) with simultaneous spatial inversion and reversion of the sign of @xmath5 is equivalent to the change of sign of hamiltonian @xmath62 which corresponds to the electron - hole symmetry .",
    "it can be also understood as a symmetry to the pseudotime inversion , @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the complex conjugation operator @xmath65 the complex conjugation operator acting on the wavefunctions changes the sign of the berry phase , and we obtain @xmath66 also , there is a symmetry with respect to @xmath67 transformation : @xmath68 leading to @xmath69 .    using these properties , we can analyze what happens when the parameter @xmath5 changes sign from negative to positive .",
    "it will helps us to determine properly the ahe for the case of @xmath7 .",
    "we start from relation between the chern numbers and ahe . for the contribution of points @xmath70 to the off - diagonal conductivity , in the case",
    "when the chemical potential @xmath71 is in the gap , one can use the standard formula @xcite @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the fermi - dirac distribution function , @xmath74 is the berry curvature , and @xmath75 is the gauge connection . the energy spectrum is shown in fig .  2 for different values of magnetic field ( the discussion is in sec .",
    "the sum over @xmath76 in eq .",
    "( 13 ) formally includes infinite number of energy bands with negative energies of electrons .",
    "however , one can show that in the model of eq .",
    "( 1 ) the contribution of all the bands with @xmath77 to the ahe is equal to zero .",
    "the reason is that if we take @xmath6 and the chemical potential @xmath78 than the sum of chern numbers for the @xmath19 and @xmath20 dirac points does not change with changing periodic field from @xmath79 to @xmath80 .",
    "indeed , any gradual variation of the field amplitude from @xmath81 to @xmath82 does not change the chern numbers because , as one can see from the band structure calculations , this does not produce any field - induced band crossings .",
    "this does not depend on the value and sign of @xmath5 and therefore is also valid in the limit of @xmath83 .",
    "since the sum of chern numbers and the resulting ahe at @xmath78 is invariant with respect to field inversion , then , due to the antisymmetry of ahe to the field , it should be zero .",
    "thus , in the vacuum state with @xmath78 there is no hall effect in graphene .",
    "if the chemical potential @xmath84 and is located somewhere within the gap , the ahe is not necessary zero and can be calculated from the following formula , which gives the quantized values of the hall conductivity @xmath85 here @xmath86 is the chern number of the @xmath76-th energy band , and the first sum in ( 14 ) runs over the occupied energy bands .    using the obtained results for the chern numbers we find that the contribution from the @xmath19 point changes ( in units of @xmath87 ) from @xmath88 to 0 when the parameter @xmath5 changes from negative to positive values .",
    "similarly , the contribution from the @xmath20 switches from 0 to @xmath88 when @xmath5 changes from @xmath55 to @xmath21 .",
    "the sum of contributions from both @xmath19 and @xmath20 is equal to @xmath88 for any sign of @xmath5 , and the sign of @xmath5 determines , which of the points @xmath19 or @xmath20 is contributing to the ahe .",
    "but in the point of @xmath7 , which corresponds to the gapless model of graphene , the contributions from @xmath19 and @xmath20 are _ exactly the same_. therefore , we come to conclusion that at @xmath7 each of these points gives the _ fractional _ value of quantized hall conductivity equal to @xmath89 .",
    "let us consider now the hamiltonian ( 1 ) with @xmath7 .",
    "it has the symmetry @xmath90 , which means that if @xmath91 is the eigenfunction of @xmath92 with energy @xmath93 then @xmath94 corresponds to the state with energy @xmath95 .",
    "the @xmath67 symmetry also means that the berry phase calculated for any positive @xmath96-band is exactly the same as for the @xmath97 band .    ) for different intensities of the field : ( a ) @xmath98 , ( b ) @xmath99 , ( c ) @xmath100 , ( d ) @xmath101 . ]    for any @xmath102-point including @xmath23 we use the unperturbed wave functions ( 3 ) .",
    "one can calculate the berry phase @xmath43 along the contour of fig .  1b , excluding the @xmath23 point and using @xmath103 where @xmath23 and @xmath104 correspond to the states with @xmath105 along the @xmath23-@xmath18 and @xmath23-@xmath17 lines , respectively .",
    "it gives us for the @xmath19 point and @xmath24 , @xmath106 .",
    "the contour around the brillouin zone gives us @xmath107 , where @xmath108 is the berry phase for a small contour around the @xmath109 point .",
    "the calculation gives @xmath110 . as a result",
    "we find the integer chern number @xmath57 .",
    "however , this chern number does not determine the hall conductivity corresponding to eq .",
    "( 14 ) because the contribution of @xmath108 should be excluded from consideration as it does not depend on the external field .",
    "thus , to calculate the ahe we should use the berry phase without enclosing @xmath23 point , and we finally find that the contribution to ahe from any of the @xmath19 or @xmath19 points is equal to @xmath89 in accordance with what we found before .     as a function of @xmath111 : ( a ) @xmath112 for @xmath21 , ( b ) @xmath112 for @xmath55 , ( c ) @xmath113 , ( d ) @xmath114 . ]    , ( b ) @xmath115 , ( c ) @xmath116 , ( d ) @xmath117 , where @xmath118 is the total number of electrons per elementary cell of graphene in periodic field.,width=283 ]",
    "using hamiltonian ( 1 ) we performed numerical calculations of the energy band structure for different intensity of the periodic field . in these calculations",
    "we used the real numerically calculated distribution of magnetic field created by the lattice of magnetic nanorods , not restricting ourselves to harmonic approximation .",
    "the results are presented in fig .  2 for different values of the dimensionless parameter of intensity of periodic field @xmath111 , defined as @xmath119 , where @xmath120 is the flux quantum .",
    "figure 2 demonstrates that the energy gap between the @xmath46 and @xmath121 bands appears at the field corresponding to @xmath122 .",
    "we also calculated numerically the chern numbers as a function of the field intensity .",
    "they are presented in fig .  3 for the first three bands .",
    "it turns out that the results of perturbation theory for the low - energy bands @xmath123 remains valid with increasing @xmath111 .",
    "figure 4 presents the hall conductivity per one spin and one valley as a function of concentration of electrons .",
    "the dashed line corresponds to the unfilled energy band , where an additional contribution from the fermi surface should be taken into account @xcite but we do not consider this case .",
    "the results of numerical calculations show that the first gap between the @xmath46 and @xmath121 bands appears at @xmath122 . in the case of iron nanorod lattice with a lattice parameter @xmath124",

    "one can also estimate the electron density @xmath76 corresponding to the insulating state when the chemical potential @xmath127 is located in the first gap .",
    "this state is characterized by one electron per elementary cell , @xmath128 , where @xmath129 and factor 4 takes into account degeneracy with respect to spin and valley in graphene . using the relation @xmath130 , where @xmath131  m / s is the electron velocity",

    "all necessary parameters are quite reachable for the technology of graphene",
    ".    one can estimate the characteristic energy @xmath133  mev for @xmath134  nm . from the band structure calculations we expect the gap to be of the order of @xmath135 .",
    "so , the gap is @xmath136  k. for the zeeman splitting in graphene we have @xmath137  k , so we expect that zeeman splitting is negligibly small for this choice of parameters .",
    "we found that the ahe related to a single dirac point in graphene is fractionally quantized , corresponding to quantum number @xmath89 .",
    "the quantization of ahe takes place if the chemical potential is located in the gap between the bands ( + 1 ) and ( + 2 ) , which can be easily achieved with the existing experimental technique .",
    "the fractional quantization is related to the dirac points , which is the monopole ( for the @xmath19 point ) or antimonopole ( for @xmath20 ) in the @xmath102 space , but the berry phase related to these points does not contribute to the ahe . correspondingly , the measured ahe in graphene with two nonequivalent dirac points and two spin orientations is integer for the same parameters , @xmath138 with @xmath139 .",
    "our consideration of the ahe is essentially based on the statement that in the clean case with @xmath78 the ahe is zero . in the above - studied model with @xmath6 , it is related to the invariance of hamiltonian and chern numbers of the filled bands with respect to the inversion of field , which contradicts to antisymmetry of ahe",

    "has the same periodicity as the honeycomb lattice , and the model includes additional next - neighbor hoppings .",
    "then the next - neighbor hopping integral in such a fast alternating field acquires nonzero phase factor , which leads to the brake of electron - hole symmetry . obviously , this model is not invariant with respect to the field inversion , @xmath140 . as a result , our arguments about vanishing of ahe in the ground state of graphene are not applicable to the model of ref .",
    ".,title=\"fig : \" ] .,title=\"fig : \" ]    to clarify this point we reconsider the haldane s model by calculating the hall conductivity as the berry phase of electrons in the lower subband along the path encompassing the brillouin zone of the honeycomb lattice .",

    "vector @xmath154 points up ( as shown in fig .",
