    "frank et al . ( 1987 ) explained the markedly different light curves of lmxb in terms of a model of varying inclination .",
    "sources having inclination angles between zero and @xmath0 will show no orbital related variability , sources with inclination of 65@xmath1 will exhibit x - ray dipping , and sources with inclinations of 80@xmath2 will be accretion disk corona ( adc ) sources .",
    "strong orbital - related variability is seen in the light curves of the dipping and adc sources , but not in the other sources which are viewed from above the orbital plane .",
    "the second type of classification is based on examining the behaviour of lmxb on x - ray colour - colour diagrams .",
    "hasinger et al .",
    "( 1989 ) first used the term `` z - track '' to describe the evolution on a colour - colour diagram of bright lmxb such as and , the sources clearly undergoing marked spectral changes as they moved along the horizontal , normal and flaring branches .",
    "the atoll sources were similarly recognised as having different colour - colour tracks ( hasinger & van der klis 1989 ) . associated with tracks in the z - track and atoll sources was correlated timing behaviour , especially of qpos ( e.g. van der klis 1995 ) .",
    "clearly , strong spectral changes take place during track movement , but these are not understood .",
    "a number of surveys of the spectra of the atoll and z - track sources have been made , including that based on _ exosat _ data ( white et al .",
    "schulz et al . (",
    "1989 ) classified a large number of sources in terms of colour - colour diagrams , and carried out spectral fitting using a blackbody plus cut - off power law model .",
    "a similar blackbody plus power law model was used by schulz ( 1999 ) in a _",
    "_ survey of lmxb .",
    "christian & swank ( 1997 ) produced a compilation of the properties of lmxb from the _ einstein _ solid state and monitor proportional counter detectors .",
    "there are considerable differences between the emission models that have been proposed for lmxb in general .",
    "a disk blackbody plus a comptonized blackbody model was proposed by mitsuda et al .",
    "a model also based on accretion disk blackbody emission was applied by czerny et al .",
    "( 1986 ) to _ einstein _ data .",
    "the generalised thermal model ( white et al . 1985 ) was used by white et al .",
    "( 1988 ) , with a blackbody added for high - luminosity sources which was not required for the lower luminosity burst sources , from which they concluded that spectral formation was dominated by comptonizaton in the inner accretion disk .",
    "more recently , a two - component model proposed by church and bauciska - church ( 1995 ) has been shown to explain spectral evolution in the dipping lmxb sources , consisting of point - source blackbody emission identified with the neutron star plus comptonized emission from an extended adc modelled by a cut - off power law ( church & bauciska - church 1993 , 1995 ; church et al .",

    "is more strongly constrained because of the requirement that a model fits not only the non - dip spectrum but also several levels of dipping .",
    "a major advantage of investigating spectral evolution in these sources is that dipping is characterised by the slow removal of comptonized emission , and measurement of dip ingress times proves that the comptonizing adc has radial extent typically 50,000 km ( church 2000 ) , which is strongly inconsistent with comptonization models involving a small region in the locality of the neutron star , allowing such models to be discounted .",

    "other authors have successfully applied two - component blackbody + comptonization models to z - track and atoll sources ( above , and e.g. hasinger et al .",
    "1990 , barret et al .",
    "however , these often ascribe emission regions to the blackbody and comptonized emission such as the accretion disk and a localised inner region respectively , e.g. barret et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , and so physically , these models differ radically from ours and are also inconsistent with our measured adc sizes .",
    "recently , the _ comptt _ implementation of the titarchuk ( 1994 ) comptonization model has been used ( together with a blackbody term ) to fit _",
    "data on lmxb sources ( e.g. int zand et al .",
    "it has been suggested that _",
    "comptt _ is preferable to the cut - off power law which may overestimate the spectrum at low energies because of lack of soft seed photons .",
    "however , it is easy to calculate the spectrum of the disk ( expressed as the photon number flux per kev ) integrated to a radius equal to our measured adc sizes , by combining the temperature gradient @xmath3 from standard thin disk theory with planck s equation .",
    "this shows that for typical lmxb luminosities , the integrated spectrum forms a broad peak between 0.001 and 0.1 kev , thus producing a huge sea of soft photons , so that the cut - off power law is perfectly good above @xmath40.1 kev .",
    "however , fitting the _ comptt _ model has produced high values of average @xmath5 for the seed photons , e.g. 1.02.0 kev ( guainazzi et al . 1998 ) which are @xmath6 than the above expected values and inconsistent with the assumption of titarchuk ( 1994 ) that the seed photons are very soft : @xmath5 @xmath7 @xmath8 ( the electron temperature ) .",

    "h = h _ is poor , as _ h _ = 110 km and _ h _ = 43 km .",
    "however the blackbody radius in this case is 33 km showing that the emission is from a sphere three times larger than the star .",
    "there is a clear implication that the accretion flow is so strong that a spherical cloud of matter around the star has formed which is responsible for the blackbody emission .",
    "if we compare _ h _ with the height of this sphere , i.e. @xmath158 = 33 km , there is much better agreement between these quantities , again suggesting that the height of the disk determines the height of the emission region . in fig .",
    "4 we plot triangles for gx5 - 1 and the other very bright source gx13 + 1 to show their expected positions at _ h _ = @xmath158 .",

    "4 ( right ) over about 3 orders of magnitude on each axis which is strong evidence for the significance of the agreement .",
    "appropriate errors are shown for all points derived from 90% confidence limits in spectra parameters .",
    "error in source distance will affect both _",
    "h _ and _ h _ ; adopting 10 km for the stellar radius will affect _ h _ , a value of 12 km reducing heights by 20% .",
    "it is also clear that we may introduce error by using the luminosity in the band 130 kev for calculating _",
    "h _ , but this range was chosen to avoid extrapolating _",
    "results too far above 10 kev . using our work on xb1916 - 053 from  ( church et al .",
    "1998a ) we have estimated possible errors .",
    "for this source , with @xmath15 = 80 kev , and the total luminosity would have been underestimated by 28% using the band 130 kev . for @xmath15 = 20 kev",
    ", the error falls to 8% and for @xmath15 = 10 kev , the error is 1% .",
    "thus there can be a further source of error in _",
    "h _ requiring points to be moved to the right by up to 30% . clearly , broadband spectral analysis is desirable for all sources in the survey .",
    "the implications of fig .",
    "4 will be discussed in the next section .",
    "we have shown that the two - component blackbody plus comptonization model gives a good description of the _ asca _ spectra of the atoll and z - track sources analysed in this survey .",
    "we thus now propose that this model suggested by us as a unifying model for the dipping sources ( church & bauciska - church 1995 ) gives a good description of lmxb in general .",
    "fitting results for the disk blackbody plus comptonization model were in 8 out of 13 cases unphysical having values of inner accretion disk radius substantially smaller than the neutron star radius making it unlikely that the blackbody emission originates in the disk .",
    "our previous results for the dipping sources in particular ( see sect .",
    "1 ) , prove that the comptonizing region is extended , indicating a flat , vertically shallow adc above the inner accretion disk .",
    "thus we do not expect significant comptonization of blackbody emission from the neutron star in such an adc since it is geometrically unlikely that blackbody photons will pass through this region .",
    "it is similarly unlikely that substantial comptonization of the neutron star emission takes place in the inner radiatively - supported disk as this would require long path lengths of photons through the disk .",
    "next , we have shown that use of the two - component model reveals a broad dependence of the blackbody luminosity on the total luminosity not previously known for lmxb in general , the blackbody luminosity falling more rapidly than the total luminosity as the mass accretion rate decreases .",
    "the major change in blackbody emission has been shown to result primarily from changes in the emitting area , not the temperature .",
    "assuming that the emission originates in an equatorial belt on the neutron star having radius @xmath410 km , we have shown that its height agrees well with the height of the radiatively - supported inner accretion disk .",
    "this agreement extends to the less luminous sources where the radiatively - supported disk does not achieve its equilibrium height , and there is good agreement between _ h _ and @xmath201 calculated at the position where @xmath185 = @xmath202 .",
    "possible explanations of the result that _",
    "h = h _ are of two types ; those in which the accretion disk height _ directly _ determines @xmath201 , and those in which it does not .",
    "the direct mechanism requires radial ( advective ) flow of material between the inner disk edge and the star .",
    "although there has been a very large amount of theoretical work on advective flow in black hole binaries ( e.g. abramowicz et al .",
    "1996 , and references therein ) , little work has been carried out for lmxb .",
    "it is not known whether the sonic point lies within the inner disk or within the star .",
    "however , popham & sunyaev ( 2000 ) show that the radial velocity increases by two orders of magnitude in the inner disk , but it is not known whether accretion flow can cross the gap between the inner disk edge and the star . resolving this question will require detailed two- or three - dimensional hydrodynamic modelling .",
    "inogamov & sunyaev ( 1999 ) have recently shown that accretion flow meeting the surface of the neutron star in the equatorial plane will spread over the surface of the star producing regions of enhanced x - ray brightness of vertical extent increasing with luminosity , as is the case in our observational result .",
    "the mechanism proposed is independent of the accretion disk height and so the _ h = h _ agreement would result from _ h _ being a measure of _",
    "l_. preliminary work shows encouraging agreement between the emitting height on the neutron star predicted by inogamov and sunyaev .",
    "a detailed comparison between the present results and this theory will be made in a further paper .",
    "the above results have a bearing on alternative models for lmxb .",
    "our results are very inconsistent with models in which the blackbody originates in the accretion disk , and the agreement of _ h = h _ is positive evidence for neutron star blackbody emission .",
    "additionally , we have used the timescales for dip ingress and egress in several observations of dipping sources ( church 2000 ) to obtain the radius of the extended comptonizing adc region : @xmath203 , typically @xmath204 cm .",
    "these measurements are supported by the fact that the comptonized emission component is gradually covered during dipping .",
    "thus the adc is 5,000 times larger than the neutron star , and this rules out models in which comptonization is supposed to take place in the neighbourhood of the neutron star .",
    "we clearly need to improve our knowledge of the emission parameters of some of the sources studied by obtaining broadband spectra extending to @xmath4100 kev , allowing the cut - off energy to be measured , which has not in general been possible in the present work .",
    "further investigation of both very bright sources and very weak sources will also be of interest .",
    "a complete description of the blackbody and comptonized emission in lmxb must be more complicated than given here .",
    "for example , during flaring , major changes take place on the neutron star and inner disk and this is investigated in work currently taking place ( bauciska - church et al .",
