    "one interesting question is when the following joint numerical range @xmath3 is convex .",
    "the first such result is due to dines @xcite in 1941 .",
    "it states that if @xmath4 are homogeneous quadratic functions then the set @xmath5 is convex . in 1971 , yakubovich @xcite used this basic result to prove the famous s - lemma , see @xcite for a survey .",
    "brickman @xcite proved in 1961 that if @xmath4 are homogeneous quadratic functions and @xmath6 then the set @xmath7 is convex .",
    "fradkov @xcite proved in 1973 that if matrices @xmath8 commute and @xmath9 are homogeneous , then @xmath10 is convex . in 1995 , it was showed by ramana and goldman @xcite that the identification of the convexity of @xmath10 is np - hard . in the same paper ,",
    "the quadratic maps , under which the image of every linear subspace is convex , was also investigated .",
    "based on brickman s result , polyak @xcite proved in 1998 that if @xmath6 and @xmath11 are homogeneous quadratic functions such that @xmath12 ( where notation @xmath13 means that @xmath14 is positive definite ) for some @xmath15 , then the set @xmath16 is convex . moreover , as shown in the same paper , when @xmath17 and there exists @xmath18 such that @xmath19 , the set @xmath5 is convex . in 2007 , beck @xcite showed that if @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , then @xmath10 is convex .",
    "however , if @xmath21 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are linearly independent , then @xmath25 is not convex . when @xmath26 , beck s result reduces to be a corollary of polyak s result .",
    "very recently , xia et al .",
    "@xcite used the new developed s - lemma with equality to establish the necessary and sufficient condition for the convexity of @xmath5 for @xmath27 and arbitrary @xmath28 .    more generally , polyak @xcite succeeded in proving a nonlinear image of a small ball in a hilbert space is convex , provided that the map is @xmath29 and the center of the ball is a regular point of the map .",
    "later , uderzo @xcite extended the result to a certain subclass of uniformly convex banach spaces .",
    "when focusing on quadratic transformations , polyak s result reads as follows :    [ thm:1 ] let @xmath30\\in \\bbb r^{n\\times m}$ ] and define @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the spectral norm of @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , denote the smallest and largest singular value and eigenvalue , respectively .    if @xmath38 , then the image @xmath39 is a convex set in @xmath40 .",
    "polyak @xcite used the following example to show his estimation @xmath41 is tight , where @xmath42 and @xmath43 actually , in this case , @xmath44 .",
    "it is trivially verified that @xmath45 is convex for @xmath46 and loses convexity for @xmath47 .    in this paper , we improve the above polyak s result for quadratic transformations ( i.e. , theorem [ thm:1 ] ) by strengthening the constant @xmath48 .",
    "then , theorem [ thm:1 ] is extended to the image of the ball of the same radius @xmath49 centered at any point @xmath50 satisfying @xmath51 .",
    "furthermore , we propose two new approaches for possible improvement of @xmath48 .    the paper is organized as follows . in section 1 , we improve and extend theorem [ thm:1 ] . in section 2 ,",
    "we discuss further possible improvements . in the final conclusion section ,",
