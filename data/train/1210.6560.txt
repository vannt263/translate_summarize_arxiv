    "in recent years the wavelet theory of periodic functions has been continuously refined .",
    "first , periodic wavelets were generated by periodization of wavelet functions on the real line ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "a wider and more natural approach providing a flexibility on a theoretical front and in applications is to study periodic wavelets directly using a periodic analog of a multiresolution analysis ( mra ) .",
    "the concept of periodic mra is introduced and discussed in @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "a unitary extension principle ( uep ) for constructing parseval wavelet frames is rewritten for periodic functions ( see theorem [ uep ] ) .",
    "the approach is developed further in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we focus on a property of good localization of both periodic wavelet functions and their fourier coefficients .",
    "the quantitative characteristic of this property is an uncertainty constant ( uc ) .",
    "originally , the concept of the uc was introduced for the real line case in 1927 ( see definition [ huc ] ) by heisenberg in @xcite .",
    "its periodic counterpart was introduced in 1985 by breitenberger in @xcite ( see definition [ uc ] ) .",
    "the smaller uc corresponds to the better localization . in both cases there",
    "exists a universal lower bound for the uc ( the uncertainty principle ) . in non - periodic setup the minimum is attained on the gaussian function .",
    "but there is no periodic function attending the lower bound .",
    "so , to find a sequence of periodic functions having an asymptotically minimal uc and some additional setup , for example a wavelet structure , is a natural concern .",
    "there is a connection between the heisenberg and the breitenberger ucs for wavelets . in @xcite",
    "it is proved that for periodic wavelets generated by periodization ( see the definition in section [ disc ] ) of a wavelet function on the real line the periodic uc tends to the real line uc of the original function as a parameter of periodization tends to infinity .",
    "it would be a possible way to construct an optimal periodic wavelet system using the periodization of a wavelet system on the real line .",
    "however , in @xcite and @xcite the following result is proven : if a real line function @xmath0 generates a wavelet bessel set and the frequency center @xmath1 ( see notation @xmath2 in definition [ huc ] ) , then the heisenberg uc is greater or equal to @xmath3 moreover , it is unknown if there exists a real line orthonormal wavelet basis or tight frame possessing the heisenberg uc less than @xmath4 this value is attained for a daubechies wavelet @xcite .",
    "the smallest possible value of the heisenberg uc for the family of the meyer wavelets equals to @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "it is well known @xcite that the heisenberg uc of the battle - lemarie and the daubechies wavelets tends to infinity as their orders grow .",
    "a set of real line orthogonal wavelet bases with the uniformly bounded heisenberg ucs as their orders ( smoothness ) grow is constructed in @xcite . on the other hand , there are examples of real line wavelet frames possessing asymptotically optimal uc such as nonorthogonal b - spline wavelets @xcite and their generalizations @xcite",
    ". however , these frames are not tight and we are looking for an orthogonal basis or tight frame .",
    "we will discuss a particular issue of periodization in section [ disc ] .",
    "some papers dealing with periodic ucs directly include @xcite .",
    "for the first time in @xcite periodic ucs uniformly bounded with respect to an mra parameter are computed for so - called trigonometric wavelets ( see also @xcite ) . in @xcite , it is shown that the ucs of uniformly local , regular , and stable periodic scaling functions and wavelets are uniformly bounded . in @xcite",
    "an example of an asymptotically optimal set of periodic functions @xmath6 is constructed , namely @xmath7 later , @xmath8 is used as a scaling function to generate a stationary interpolatory mra @xmath9 . for the corresponding wavelet functions",
    "@xmath10 the uc is optimal for a fixed space @xmath11 but the estimate is nonuniform with respect to @xmath12 namely @xmath13 nothing changes after orthogonalization : @xmath14@xmath15    the main contribution of this paper is theorem [ opt ] , where we construct a family of scaling sequences @xmath16 generating a family of wavelet sequences @xmath17 corresponding to a nonstationary periodic mra as it is defined in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . for a fixed level @xmath18 of the mra ( @xmath19 ) , similar to the construction in @xcite , the ucs of @xmath20 and @xmath21",
    "are asymptotically optimal , that is @xmath22 but now , for a fixed value of the parameter @xmath23 the scaling sequence has the asymptotically optimal uc , and the wavelet sequence has the smallest currently known value of the uc for the periodic wavelet frames setup , that is @xmath24 as it is indicated above , the functions constructed in @xcite do not have this property .",
    "this issue partly answers the question stated in @xcite whether there exists a translation - invariant basis of a wavelet space @xmath25 which is asymptotically optimal independent of the mra level @xmath26 in theorem [ opt ] we get an affirmative answer for the case of scaling functions corresponding to tight wavelet frames .",
    "the case of wavelet basis is an open problem and it is a task for future work . in this direction ,",
    "some useful properties of shifted gaussian are discussed in @xcite .",
    "we will consider the particular issue of wavelet sequences in section [ disc ] .",
    "let @xmath27 be the space of all @xmath28-periodic square - integrable complex - valued functions , with inner product @xmath29 given by @xmath30 for any @xmath31 and norm @xmath32 the fourier series of a function @xmath33 is defined by @xmath34 where its fourier coefficient is defined by @xmath35    let @xmath36 be a separable hilbert space . if there exist constants @xmath37 such that for any @xmath38 the following inequality holds @xmath39 then the sequence @xmath40 is called ` a frame ` for @xmath41 if @xmath42",
