    "the discovery of the higgs boson is a great triumph for the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "however , the sm higgs mass is quadratically sensitive to the cutoff scale @xmath2 ( usually taken as gut or planck scale ) via radiative corrections because of the lack of symmetry protection .",
    "this renders the sm with @xmath3 rather unnatural .",
    "a well known theory of solving such a naturalness problem is supersymmetry .    among various supersymmetric models , natural supersymmetry ( nsusy )",
    "is a well motivated framework @xcite , which consists of a small set of sparticles that closely relate to the naturalness , such as higgsinos , stop and gluino .",
    "this can be understood by the minimization of the higgs potential @xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the higgsino mass parameter in the superpotential and contributes to @xmath6 at tree level , @xmath7 is assumed in the last approximate equality , @xmath8 and @xmath9 denote the soft susy breaking masses of the higgs fields at weak scale , and @xmath10 and @xmath11 arise from the radiative corrections to the higgs potential . due to the large top yukawa couplings ,",
    "@xmath10 is dominated by the stop at 1-loop level , while the gluino contributes to @xmath10 via the corrections to the stop mass .",
    "other contributions from the first two generation squarks and sleptons to @xmath6 are negligible small",
    ". therefore , the requirement of getting the correct value of @xmath6 without fine - tuning will give upper bounds on the masses of higgsinos , stops and gluino @xcite .    with the recent @xmath12 dataset at the lhc run-2 , the stop and gluino masses",
    "are respectively excluded up to @xmath13 1 tev @xcite and 1.8 tev @xcite , while the electroweakinos below @xmath14 tev can also be covered for different decay channels @xcite .",
    "but these limits are obtained in the simplified models and sensitively depend on the assumptions of the nature of the lighest supersymmetric partner ( lsp ) , the branching ratios of heavier sparticles and the mass splitting between heavier sparticles and the lsp .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to examine the current lhc run-2 coverage of nsusy and assess the fine - tuning extent . in this work ,",
    "we utilize the recent results of the lhc run-2 inclusive sparticle searches and direct stop pair searches to constrain the stop mass in nsusy .",
    "we compare their sensitivities and find that they are complementary in probing nsusy .",
    "we will also evaluate the electroweak fine - tuning measure in the allowed parameter space of nsusy and comment on the prospect for covering the low fine - tuning parameter space of nsusy at hl - lhc .",
    "to address the lower mass limit of stop in nsusy , we can focus on a right - handed stop .",
    "this is because that the left - handed stop is linked with the left - handed sbottom by the @xmath51 symmetry .",
    "then , the left - handed sbottom decay channel @xmath52 can mimics the left - handed stop signals @xmath49 since @xmath44 and @xmath53 are higgsino - like and degenerate in nsusy .",
    "this enhances the lhc limit on a left - handed stop , which is stronger than the limit on a right - handed stop @xcite .",
    "now we examine the constraints on the nsusy scenario that consists of a right - handed stop and higgsinos .",
    "we scan the parameter space in the ranges @xmath54 the lower limit on the higgsino mass is motivated by the lep searches for electroweakinos .",
    "we require the stop mixing angle @xmath55 to obtain a right - handed stop @xmath56 . since the gluino contributes to the naturalness measure in eq .",
    "( [ ewnaturalness ] ) at 2-loop level , a low fine - tuning allows the gluino with a mass up to several tev , which is possibly beyond the reach of lhc .",
    "so we assume the gluino mass parameter @xmath57 tev in our scan .",
    "since the electroweak gauginos , heavy higgs bosons , the sleptons , the first two generations of squarks and the right - handed sbottom are not strongly related to the naturalness , we decouple their contributions by fixing @xmath58 tev at weak scale .    in our scan , we impose the following indirect constraints :    * * higgs mass * : we require that the lighter cp - even higgs boson be the sm - like higgs boson with a mass in the range of @xmath59 gev , which is calculated by the package @xcite . * * vacuum stability * : we impose the constraint of metastability of the vacuum state by requiring @xmath60 @xcite , because the large trilinear parameter @xmath22 can potentially lead to a global vacuum where charge and colour are broken @xcite . * * low - energy observables * : we require our samples to satisfy the bound of @xmath61 at 2@xmath62 range , which is implemented by the package of @xcite . * * dark matter detection * : we require the thermal relic density of the neutralino dark matter @xmath63 is below the 2@xmath62 upper limit of 2015 planck value @xcite tev can solely produce the correct relic density in the mssm @xcite . ] and the lux ws2014 - 16 @xcite . the results for the spin - independent neutralino - proton scattering cross section @xmath64",
    "is rescaled by a factor of @xmath65 .",
    "we use the package of @xcite to calculate @xmath63 and @xmath64 .    besides",
    ", the lhc run-2 experiments have covered a wide parameter space of the mssm .",
    "we list the relevant lhc experimental analyses for our scenario :    * from atlas , * * * stop * , 0 lepton + ( b)jets + @xmath66 , 13.3 fb@xmath67@xcite , * * * stop * , 1 lepton + ( b)jets + @xmath66 , stop , 13.3 fb@xmath67@xcite , * * * stop * , 2 leptons + ( b)jets + @xmath66 , stop , 13.3 fb@xmath67@xcite , * * * sbottom * , 2 b - tagged jets + @xmath66 , 3.2 fb@xmath67@xcite , * * * compressed spectrum * , 1 jet + @xmath66 , 3.2 fb@xmath67@xcite . * from cms , * * * inclusive * , 0 lepton + @xmath68 jets + @xmath66 + @xmath1 , 12.9 fb@xmath67@xcite * * * inclusive * , 0 lepton + @xmath68 jets + @xmath66 + @xmath69 , 12.9 fb@xmath67@xcite * * * inclusive * , 0 lepton + @xmath68 jets + @xmath66 + @xmath70 , 12.9 fb@xmath67@xcite * * * stop * , 0 lepton + ( b)jets + @xmath66 , 12.9 fb@xmath67@xcite , * * * stop * , 1 lepton + ( b)jets + @xmath66 , 12.9 fb@xmath67@xcite , * * * compressed spectrum * , 1 jet + soft lepton pair + @xmath66 , 12.9 fb@xmath67@xcite .    it should be mentioned that the higgsinos @xmath43 and @xmath71 have the small mass difference with the lsp @xmath72 in nsusy .",
    "then the decay products of @xmath43 and @xmath73 are too soft to be tagged at the lhc .",
    "so , the stop decays can be categorized into two topologies : @xmath74 and @xmath75 . among the current atlas searches for the stop",
    ", the all - hadronic final state channel has a better sensitivity than those with leptons in the high stop mass region ( @xmath76 gev ) because of the application of boosted top technique .",
    "similar results are obtained by the cms collaboration . with the decrease of the mass splitting @xmath77 , the sensitivity of the conventional stop searches for the energetic top quark in the final states become poor .",
    "in particular , if @xmath78 , the stop decay will be dominated by the four - body channel @xmath79 @xcite or the two - body loop channel @xmath80 @xcite . then , the decay products of the stop are usually very soft so that a high @xmath81 hard jet from the isr / fsr is needed to tag these compressed stop events , such as the atlas monojet analysis listed above .",
    "note that the very recent cms monojet with the soft lepton pair analysis of the compressed electroweakinos can exclude the wino - like chargino mass @xmath82 up to 175 gev for a mass difference of 7.5 gev with respect to the lsp .",
    "however , this limit is not applicable to our scenario because the cross section of the higgsino pair production is 1/4 of the wino pair . on the other hand ,",
    "both atlas and cms experiments have performed the inclusive susy searches for final states with ( generally untagged ) jets and a large amount of @xmath66 , which can also be used to derive limits on the parameter space in various simplified models . in our study",
    ", we reinterpret the recent cms analysis of @xmath83 .",
    "this strategy is built around the use of the kinematic variable @xmath1 , which is constructed from jet - based quantities to provide strong discriminating power between sources of genuine and misreconstructed @xmath84 .",
    "such a variable can highly suppress multijet background , and is suitable for early searches at 13 tev lhc .",
    "based on the above considerations , we use four lhc experimental analyses to constrain the parameter space of nsusy , which are listed in table [ table1 ] .",
    "lhc run-2 analyses used in our study . [",
    "cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table1 ]    in our monte carlo simulations , we use @xcite to generate the parton level signal events , which are showered and hadronized by the package @xcite .",
    "the detector simulation effects are implemented with the package @xcite .",
    "the jets are clustered with the anti-@xmath85 algorithm @xcite by the package @xcite .",
    "the cross section of the stop pair production at 13 tev lhc are calculated by package @xcite with the cteq6.6 m pdfs @xcite .",
    "we impose the atlas monojet constraint with @xcite .",
    "the atlas 1-lepton stop and the cms 0-lepton stop analyses are implemented within the checkmate framework @xcite .",
    "but as mentioned above , we only focus on the heavy stop mass range ( @xmath86 gev ) for the cms 0-lepton analyses because of the improved sensitivity by application of the top tagging technique . besides ,",
    "the higgsinos @xmath43 and @xmath44 are nearly degenerate in nsusy .",
    "the stop decay @xmath87 gives the same topology as the sbottom decay @xmath88 .",
    "so we can determine the exclusion limit on the stop by using the cross section upper limit of the sbottom pair production reported from the cms inclusive search with @xmath1 .     versus @xmath89 .",
    "all samples satisfy the constraints of the higgs mass , vacuum stability , @xmath90 and dark matter detections .",

    "[ result ] , we project the samples allowed by the higgs mass , vacuum stability , @xmath90 and dark matter detections on the plane of @xmath94 versus @xmath89 . to quantitatively evaluate the naturalness , we use the electroweak fine - tuning measure @xmath95 @xcite @xmath96 where @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 with @xmath102 labeling the various loop contributions to @xmath103 and @xmath104 . the one - loop stop contributions @xmath105 are given by  @xcite @xmath106 \\label{eq : sigtuu}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the form factor @xmath107 with the optimized scale @xmath108 , @xmath48 is the top quark yukawa coupling and @xmath109 , @xmath110 . in this figure",
    "the triangles , squares and bullets represent the samples that have the electroweak fine - tuning @xmath111 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 , respectively . in our parameter space",
    ", the low fine - tuning @xmath111 requires the higgsino mass @xmath112 gev and the stop mass @xmath113 tev .",
    "it can be seen that 70% of such a parameter space can be covered by the current lhc run-2 susy searches .",
    "a lighter stop mass ( @xmath114 ) requires a large trilinear parameter @xmath22 to satisfy the higgs mass constraint , which leads to a large value of @xmath95 is needed to raise higgs mass to 125 gev , which causes the little fine - tuning problem . in some extensions like nmssm @xcite , the higgs mass receives an additional tree - level term and thus can possibly avoid such a little fine - tuning problem . ]    besides , from fig .",
    "[ result ] it can be seen that the atlas monojet search produces a strong exclusion limit in the low stop mass region , which excludes the stop mass up to 320 gev for @xmath115 gev .",
    "this is because that when the stop mass is close to the lsp mass , the @xmath116-jets from the stop decay @xmath117 or @xmath118-jets from @xmath119 are too soft to be identified",
    ". then the monojet search is very sensitive in the low stop region .    in the moderate or heavy stop region ,",
    "the stop dominantly decays to @xmath120 and @xmath121 , which produce @xmath122 and @xmath123 signatures , respectively .",
    "the cms inclusive search with @xmath1 shows a better sensitivity than the 0/1-lepton stop searches in most parameter space .",
    "but we also note that the exclusion limit of the cms 0-lepton stop search is slightly stronger than the cms inclusive search because of the application of top tagging technique in atlas analysis .",
    "finally , we conclude that the stop mass can be excluded up to 765 ( 850 ) gev for @xmath124 ( @xmath125 ) gev by the current lhc run-2 experiments .",
    "such limits are much stronger than the lhc run-1 limits on nsusy , which excluded a stop below 600 gev @xcite .",
    "the future high luminosity lhc is expected to cover the stop and higgsino mass up to 1.5 tev and 0.6 tev , respectively @xcite . at that time , most of the nsusy parameter space with @xmath126 can be covered @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we examined the lower mass limit of the stop in natural supersymmetry ( nsusy ) by using the recent lhc-13 tev data .",
    "we recast the lhc susy inclusive search for @xmath127 events with @xmath1 variable , the direct stop pair searches ( 1-lepton channel and all - hadronic channel ) and the monojet analyses .",
    "we found that the inclusive susy analysis with @xmath1 is complementary to the direct stop pair analyses in probing nsusy .",
    "the current lhc data can exclude the stop up to 765 ( 860 ) gev for @xmath124 ( @xmath125 ) gev . while in the compressed region ( @xmath128 gev ) , the stop mass can be still light as 320 gev .",
    "about 70% of the nsusy parameter space with @xmath91 can be covered by the current lhc run-2 data .",
    "the future hl - lhc is expected to push the lower mass limits of the stop and higgsino up to 1.5 tev and 0.6 tev , respectively and cover most nsusy parameter space with @xmath126 .",
