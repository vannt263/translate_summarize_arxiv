    "residuals from the subtraction of extragalactic and galactic foregrounds and the correction of the distortion of the signal by the ionosphere will all contribute to the noise .",
    "we currently have little idea how large the noise due to these residuals will be .",
    "the intensity fluctuations in the 21 cm emission due to density fluctuations of the igm will also act as noise ( e.g. kohler et al . 2005 , mellema et al .",
    "2006 ) . for @xmath182",
    "hour integrations with the lofar core the fluctuations due to the igm surrounding the source limit the sensitivity on scales larger than @xmath42  arcminutes ( wyithe , loeb & barnes  2005 ) ; increasing the exposure time will not significantly decrease the minimum size of detectable hii regions .",
    "furthermore , the edge of an hii region surrounding a qso is not expected to be sharp ( see zaroubi & silk  2005 ) and the intrinsic shape will appear distorted due to light travel time effects ( see wyithe & loeb  2004b ; yu  2005 ) . the signal to noise ratios estimated here",
    "should thus be considered as ( probably rather optimistic ) upper limits .      in figure 5",
    "we show our predictions for the space density of hii regions as a function of size at @xmath2 in units of @xmath183 for each of the three models .",
    "the vertical and horizontal lines show the typical size of a lofar observing volume ( @xmath184  deg@xmath173 and @xmath185  mhz of bandwidth ) and our estimate for the @xmath179 detection threshold for the size .",
    "the effective recombination timescale for hydrogen gas at @xmath124  k is comparable to or somewhat shorter than the hubble time . as discussed by wyithe ,",
    "loeb & barnes  ( 2005 ) hii regions are thus expected to remain as fossils for some time after the qso turns off .",
    "we assume that the hii regions continue to expand with the hubble flow once the quasar turns off and there are no further recombinations , and count the number of fossil regions with physical radius r at @xmath24 by summing over the size distribution function at redshift intervals corresponding to the quasar lifetime .",
    "we assume that the quasars at @xmath33 are on average half way through their optically luminous lifetime .",
    "there are essentially no fossil hii regions in the case of @xmath186 since the qso luminosity grows exponentially on a timescale comparable to the quasar lifetime .",
    "note that for the other two models @xmath187 is @xmath188 times smaller than @xmath189 for the smallest hii regions ( corresponding to the faintest quasars , @xmath190 ) at @xmath98 due to the rapid evolution of the space density of qsos .",
    "@xmath191 asymptotes to one for large hii regions and high redshifts as expected .",
    "we show both the number of hii regions around active qsos ( black lines ) and the total number ( including fossil bubbles ) of hii regions ( grey lines ) . we have assumed that the igm is still neutral all the way down to @xmath33 .",
    "we will come back to this point below .    for the merger - driven model we predict @xmath192 detectable sources around active qsos per lofar field at @xmath98 .",
    "this number increases to @xmath193 if we include fossil hii regions around supermassive black holes which are no longer active .",
    "the numbers are similar to those reported by wyithe , loeb & barnes  ( 2005 ) for their similar model . in our merger driven model at least one detectable hii region per lofar field is predicted out to @xmath194 . due to the steep slope of the qlf at high luminosities , the numbers would decrease more rapidly with redshift if the effective minimum detectable radius is larger than we have estimated .    for our two passive evolution models the predictions are quite different .",
    "the model with the lower duty cycle offers a more optimistic picture than the merger driven model .",
    "the longer qso lifetime results in larger hii regions for the same qso luminosity .",
    "we predict @xmath195 detectable hii regions per lofar field at @xmath196 around active luminous qsos and detectable hii regions are present up to @xmath181 .",
    "the value of the maximum redshift depends sensitively on the duty cycle and could be  at least in principle",
    " much larger for smaller values of the duty cycle . this would , however , require the formation of very massive black holes at very high redshift which would be difficult in most formation scenarios .",
    "the passive evolution model with the higher value of the duty cycle depicts a much more pessimistic scenario .",
    "the predicted numbers at @xmath33 are similar to the other models , but the the presence of detectable hii regions does not extend much beyond @xmath33 .",
    "this is easily explained by the very recent growth of the @xmath33 supermassive black holes in this model .",
    "figure 6 shows the redshift evolution of detectable active and fossil hii regions with @xmath197  mpc .",
    "clearly the prospects for detecting hii regions depend sensitively on how bhs grow at high redshift .",
    "so far we have assumed that the igm is still neutral all the way down to @xmath33 .",
    "however the neutral fraction at redshift @xmath0 is uncertain and the universe may already be highly ionised at @xmath198 ( malhotra & rhoads  2005 , fan et al .",
    "a smaller but still significant neutral fraction would result in a larger hii region [ see equation  ( [ lum - rad ] ) ] , however the signal to noise ratio for the detection of a resolved hii regions scales with the square root of the neutral fraction ( @xmath199 ) ; sources in a partially neutral igm are more difficult to detect .",
    "for consistency we have calculated the volume filling factor of hydrogen ionised by the qsos in each of our models .",
    "we assume that our model extends to qsos as faint as @xmath200  l@xmath40 , include the contribution due to fossil regions and neglect recombinations .",
    "our filling factor should therefore represent an upper limit on the expected value .",
    "we find a filling factor of hii regions generated by the uv emission of active quasars in our models which is less than @xmath201 per cent at @xmath7 for the model with the low duty fraction and for the merger model and @xmath202 cent for the model with the large duty fraction .",
    "for each model the filling factor drops rapidly at higher redshift .",
    "note again that we have integrated down to rather faint quasars and that taking recombinations into account would also lower these values .",
    "our assumption that the hii regions generated by qsos are isolated may therefore be somewhat questionable at @xmath7 but should be reasonable at @xmath203 .",
    "not surprisingly the quasars in our models which are consistent with the rather low observed space density of qsos at @xmath204 alone are barely able to fully reionise hydrogen by @xmath204 .",
    "the quasars should also contribute to the ionisation of hydrogen with their x - ray emission . due to their long mean free path ,",
    "x - rays will lead to a more uniform ionisation which includes the low - density igm far away from the quasars ( e.g. madau et al .  2004 ,",
    "ricotti & ostriker  2004 ) . the efficiency with which an x - ray photon ionises hydrogen atoms in the igm depends on the average number of ionisations induced by secondary electrons , which is a function of the initial photon energy as well as the existing ionised gas fraction ( see shull & van  steenberg  1985 ) .",
    "we follow ricotti & ostriker and assume that each photon with energy @xmath205  kev results in 10 ionisations in a partially ionised igm . assuming again that our model extends to quasars as faint as @xmath200  l@xmath40 the mean ionised fraction at @xmath33 due to the x - ray emission of active qsos in our model is less than 1 percent for all models .",
    "another possibly relevant effect is the clustering of qsos .",
    "bright sources are sufficiently rare that clustering should not be important . for fainter sources overlap of clustered hii region could increase the sizes compared to our estimates in particular if fossil hii regions are taken into account .",
    "[ radius_evo ]",
    "we have investigated the prospects of using the 21 cm signature of the regions around supermassive black holes at @xmath2 to probe the growth history of these supermassive black holes and the ionisation history of their surrounding igm .",
    "we have presented three simple , physically motivated models for the high redshift growth history of supermassive black holes in which the growth is either simple eddington limited accretion or due to short - lived accretion phases triggered by the merger of galaxies .",
    "we have used a simple analytical model for the size of hii regions in order to generate predictions for the size distribution of hii regions for each of our model qlfs .",
    "our results show that models which are all consistent with the luminosity function of bright qsos at @xmath98 but differ in the growth history of the supermassive black holes give very different results for the predicted number of detectable hii regions .",
    "our estimates for the number of detectable hii regions at @xmath7 are promising , up to several hundred detectable sources per lofar field around active qsos and possibly many more fossil regions .",
    "however , the number of detectable hii regions depends sensitively on unknown details of smbh growth and the ionisation state of the igm .",
    "if the qlf evolves to @xmath206 as predicted in our merger - driven model , then isolated hii regions will be prominent features of the high redshift neutral hydrogen distribution providing reionisation was completed late ( @xmath207 ) .",
    "however if the smbh population is growing rapidly due to continuous accretion , or reionisation occurred much earlier than @xmath7 , then the detection of qso hii regions may prove elusive .",
    "the most optimistic picture emerges if supermassive black holes grow more slowly over an extended period of time as in our eddington limited accretion model with a smaller duty cycle ( @xmath208 ) . in this case",
    "detectable sources may be present to very large redshifts and the prospects for detection are good even if reionisation is completed relatively early .",
