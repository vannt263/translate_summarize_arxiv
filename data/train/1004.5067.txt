    "the concept of ` visibility ' has been studied for many years .",

    "more recently , the nature of the visible parts of fractals has been considered , with the question of the hausdorff dimension of the visible parts attracting particular interest @xcite .",
    "there are two ( related ) approaches : given a set @xmath11 one can consider the subset of @xmath0 that is visible from a point @xmath4 ( that is the subset of @xmath0 that may be joined to @xmath4 by a line segment intersecting @xmath0 at no other points ) .",
    "alternatively , the visible part may be considered with respect to a direction @xmath3 . in this case",
    "the visible set of @xmath0 is the subset of @xmath0 from which the half - line in direction @xmath3 does not intersect @xmath0 in any other points .",
    "we adopt the latter approach here .",
    "the relationship between the hausdorff dimension of @xmath0 and its visible subsets from various points or directions is of particular interest .",
    "it has been suggested that if @xmath0 has hausdorff dimension greater than 1 then the hausdorff dimension of the visible subset is 1 from almost all points and from almost all directions .",
    "this has been established for certain classes of set , and here we address this question for a class of self - similar subsets of the plane .    for a unit vector @xmath12",
    "we define @xmath13 to be the half - line from the origin in direction @xmath3 @xmath14 let @xmath15 be the linear subspace perpendicular to @xmath3 and @xmath16 be orthogonal projection onto @xmath17 .    for a compact",
    "@xmath11 the _ visible part _ of @xmath0 from direction @xmath3 is @xmath18    there are natural generalisations of visibility to higher dimensions but we do not discuss these here , see @xcite .",
    "the hausdorff dimensions of projections of sets are summarised in marstand s projection theorem , see @xcite .",

    "if @xmath22 then ( b ) implies that @xmath26 for almost all @xmath3 and in many cases there is equality here for almost all @xmath3 .",
    "thus one is tempted to make the following conjecture .",
    "[ vis conj ] if @xmath11 and @xmath5 then @xmath27 for lebesgue almost all @xmath3 .",
    "this has been verified for several classes of fractal .",
    "simple arguments , for example using rectifiability see @xcite , show that graphs of functions satisfy conjecture [ vis conj ] with the only exceptional direction being perpendicular to the @xmath4-axis .",
    "the conjecture holds for quasi - circles , see @xcite , and this paper also addresses certain connected self - similar sets for which the group generated by the rotational part of the similarity transformations is finite . in @xcite",
    "it is shown that if @xmath0 is the random set obtained from the fractal percolation process then the conjecture holds almost surely .",
    "for an upper dimension bound , the part of a compact connected set @xmath0 that is visible from a point @xmath4 has hausdorff dimension at most @xmath28 for almost all @xmath29 , see @xcite .    here",
    "we give another class of sets for which conjecture [ vis conj ] holds .",
    "we show that if a compact set @xmath0 is self - similar and satisfies the convex open set condition and if @xmath30 is an interval for all @xmath3 , then the hausdorff and box - counting dimensions of the visible part @xmath2 equal 1 for all @xmath3 .",
    "in particular , we allow the group generated by the rotational part of the similarity transformations to be infinite and we do not require @xmath0 to be connected ( although the projection condition is automatically satisfied when @xmath0 is connected ) .",
    "let @xmath31 be an iterated function system ( ifs ) consisting of contracting similarity transformations of @xmath1 .",
    "the well - known result of hutchinson , see @xcite , states that there exists a unique non - empty compact set @xmath0 satisfying @xmath32 the set @xmath0 is termed the _ attractor _ of the ifs and in our case , where the @xmath33 are similarity transformations , @xmath0 is termed _ self - similar_. we write @xmath34 for the convex hull of @xmath0 .",

    "we index sets in the construction of @xmath0 and the points in @xmath0 in the usual way .",
    "we write @xmath50 to denote the sequence space defined by @xmath51 and @xmath52 to denote the corresponding sequences of length @xmath53 @xmath54 and @xmath55 for the set of all finite sequences    for @xmath56 we write @xmath57 , so that @xmath58 are the @xmath53th - level sets in the usual construction of @xmath0 from the iterated images of @xmath34",

    "in particular , lemma [ tight ] means that once a point @xmath8 is ` obscured ' when viewed from direction @xmath3 by some set @xmath67 , it can never become ` visible ' at a later stage in the construction and hence can not belong to @xmath2 .",
    "we now introduce the notion of @xmath68-visibility to indicate which @xmath53th level sets are visible from direction @xmath3 .",

    "hence @xmath92 is @xmath83-visible .    for every line @xmath9 in the plane and @xmath93 let @xmath94 be the infinite strip centered on @xmath9 and of width @xmath95 .",
