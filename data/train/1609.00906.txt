    "stars with the extended convective envelopes demonstrate the high level of magnetic activity @xcite .",
    "it is commonly believed that the magnetic activity of these stars origins from the hydromagnetic turbulent dynamo action @xcite .",
    "extremely high magnetic activity was found on the fully - convective low - mass stars which belong to the m - dwarfs branch of the low main sequence of the hertzsprung - rawssel diagram .",
    "observations of the m - dwarfs indicated the rather strong large - scale magnetic field with strength of several kg @xcite .",
    "the magnetic topology of the m - dwarfs is likely depends on the mass and the rotation period of a star @xcite .",
    "observations indicate that the early type m - dwarfs with the moderate period of rotation about 4 - 5 days demonstrate the strong non - axisymmetric magnetic field with the dominant toroidal component @xcite .",
    "the extremely fast rotating early type m - dwarfs with period of rotation less than 1 day indicate the transition to the axisymmetric dynamo with the dominant poloidal component of the large - scale magnetic field .",
    "situation become complicated on the mid and late - type m - stars which have the masses less than @xmath4 as they could show either the strong axisymmetric dipole - kind large - scale magnetic field , or the low - strength non - axisymmetric magnetic field @xcite .",
    "thus we can conclude about three basic states of the dynamo on the fast rotating m - dwarfs , they are : the strong multipole magnetic field ( hereafter , sm ) , the strong dipole field ( hereafter sd ) and the weak multipole ( hereafter wm ) magnetic field . we follow notation suggested by @xcite .",
    "interesting that simultaneously with multiply states of the dynamo regimes , the dynamo generated total magnetic flux do not show the rotation - activity connection which is known among the solar type stars @xcite",
    ".    observed magnetic properties of the m - stars initiated the number of the theoretical studies employing the mean - field models ( see , @xcite ) and the direct numerical simulations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "using the results of the numerical simulations , @xcite suggests that the bi - stability of the magnetic topology on the late - type m - stars could result from two types of the convection regimes occurred in the fast rotating convective bodies @xcite .",
    "also , the direct numerical simulations show the differential rotation is important part of the dynamo in the fully convective stars .",
    "similar conclusions were suggested by @xcite after studying the linear dynamo regimes .",
    "current interpretation of the dynamo bi - stability given by @xcite suggests that the strength of the large - scale magnetic field is compatible with the nonlinear balance between the lorentz and coriolis force in case of the sd - type magnetism and it is established by the lorentz - inertia force balance in case of the wm magnetism .",
    "later , @xcite found that in the anelastic simulations the separation between the sd and wm magnetism is less profound than they as well as others ( e.g. , @xcite ) found with the boussinescue approximation .",
    "the origin of the strong multipolar magnetic field on the moderate rotating early m - stars is barely studied .",
    "results of the mean - field models and the numerical simulations suggest the dynamo on these stars could operate with help of the differential rotation . the linear analysis of @xcite",
    "show that the axisymmetric magnetic field modes have the smaller critical threshold of the dynamo instability than the non - axisymmetric ones .",
    "thus , the transition from axisymmetric to non - axisymmetric dynamo can occur only in the nonlinear regime .",
    "the paper we study the nonlinear dynamo models for a fully convective star . here",
    "we restrict ourselves to the same case of the star discussed earlier by @xcite , i.e. , the star of mass 0.3@xmath0 of 1gyr age and rotating with period of 10 days .",
    "we will address the axisymmetric and non - axisymmetric dynamo regimes with regards for the non - linear back reaction of the large - scale magnetic field on the @xmath3-effect and the large - scale flow .",
    "the solution of the dynamo problem is coupled with the solution of the mean angular momentum balance and the mean heat transport in the convective sphere .",
    "the main goal of the paper is to find the typical topology of the large - scale magnetic field in the nonlinear dynamo for the given rotation period and investigate the nonlinear effects on the dynamo .",
    "we consider a fully convective star of mass 0.3@xmath0 of 1gyr age and rotating with period of 10 days .",
    "the reference internal thermodynamic structure of the star was calculated using the mesa stellar evolution code , the version r7503 , @xcite .",
    "it is assumed that composition of the star is similar to the sun and the metallicity parameter is @xmath5 . in the reference model",
    "we neglect effects of stellar rotation on the hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "the convection parameters in the mesa code are determined by @xmath6 , where @xmath7is the pressure stratification scale .",
    "for the given parameters the star has the radius of @xmath8 , the luminosity of @xmath9 and the surface temperature of @xmath10k .",
    "current understanding of the internal structure of the fully convective stars is not complete .",
    "that s why the theoretical predictions for the stellar radius and the @xmath11 of the m - dwarfs are different from observation@xcite .",
    "the mean - field heat transport equation takes into account effects of the global rotation on the thermal equilibrium .",
    "it is calculated from the mean - field heat transport equation , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the source function , @xmath14 is axisymmetric mean flow , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the mean density and temperature , and @xmath17 is the mean entropy . in what follows ,",
    "the over - bar denote the axisymmetric component of the mean field and the angle brackets are used for the ensemble average of the field which could contain the large - scale non - axisymmetric modes contributions as well .",
    "we employ expression of the anisotropic convective flux suggested by @xcite ( hereafter kpr94 ) , @xmath18 where in the heat eddy - conductivity tensor @xmath19 we have to take into account both the global rotation and the large - scale magnetic field effects .",
    "the expression has the complicated form and it is unknown for the general case if both the coriolis and the lorenz forces are not small simultaneously .",
    "this corresponds to conditions in the considered m - star .",
    "the fast rotation regime and @xmath20 , holds in whole volume of the star except the layer above @xmath21 ( see , fig.1a ) , where the coriolis number @xmath22 , and @xmath23 is the turn - over time of convective flow . in the paper",
    "we approximate the eddy heat conductivity tensor in following to @xcite : @xmath24 the effect of the global rotation on the heat transport depends on and the functions @xmath25 and @xmath26 are defined in kpr4 . the magnetic feedback on the eddy heat - conductivity depends on the functions @xmath27 and @xmath28,(see appendix ) and the parameter @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the strength of the large - scale magnetic field , and @xmath31 is the rms convective velocity .",
    "note that for the case @xmath32 we have @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "thus the isotropic part of the eddy heat conductivity is quenched stronger than that in direction of the rotation axis .",
    "however in the case of the weak magnetic field the expression returns to the case discussed in kpr94 .",
    "the self - consistent model could also include effects the joule s heating or sinks of the convective energy into magnetic activity , see e.g. , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we put off discussion of those effects . in limits of the slow rotation and the weak magnetic field ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 the heat conductivity tensor reduces to isotropic form , @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the mixing length .",
    "the rms convective velocity is determined from the mixing - length relations @xmath39    the integration domain of the mean - field model is from @xmath40 to @xmath41 , we exclude the central and the near - surface regions . at the inner boundary the total flux @xmath42 and for the external boundary , in following to @xcite",
    ", we use @xmath43 we put other details about the mean - field model of the heat transport in appendix .",
    "the heat transport equation is coupled to equations of the angular momentum balance and the mean - field dynamo equations . .",
    "in the spherical coordinate system the conservation of the angular momentum @xcite it expressed as follows : @xmath44 where , @xmath45 is the large - scale dynamo generated magnetic field ( see , the subsection 2.2 ) .",

    "the turbulent stresses include the non - disspative part due to the @xmath53-effect and the anisotropic eddy viscosity .",
    "the theory is not complete because it does not comprise the joint effect of the global rotation and the large - scale magnetic field on the angular momentum transport .",
    "we apply the theory developed in @xcite and @xcite for the case of the arbitrary @xmath54 and the arbitrary strength of the large scale magnetic field .",
    "theirs derivations are valid in the case when the toroidal component of the large - scale magnetic field dominates the poloidal one . in equation for the toroidal vorticity , eq.([eq : vort ] )",
    "we neglect the radial derivative of the lorentz force in compare to the density gradient .",
    "the details about implementation of the turbulent stress tensor @xmath51 are given in appendix .",
    "figure ( [ fig : basic ] ) shows profiles of the internal parameters of the mean - field model of the heat transport and the angular momentum balance together with some input parameters from the mesa code .",
    "it is found that the convective turnover time varies from about of 1 day at the near - surface layer to about of 200 days near the center of the star .",
    "this results to the strong modifications of the turbulent viscosity parameters .",
    "the resulted differential rotation is rather weak , it is about of 0.01@xmath55 , where @xmath56rad / s is the stellar rotation rate .",

    "this pattern changes to the cylinder like pattern in the equatorial region . in the portion of the star which occupied by the weakly varying angular velocity",
    ", the given pattern is different to results of the direct numerical simulations ( cf , @xcite ) .",
    "however , the strong shear in equatorial region is presented in all models .",
    "the meridional circulation consists of the one cell in each hemisphere with poleward flow in upper part of the star .",
    "the amplitude of the flow is about one meter per second at the surface .",
    "the dynamo model takes into account both the axisymmetric and the non - axisymmetric large - scale magnetic field .",
    "its evolution is described by the mean - field induction equation @xcite : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the mean electromotive force ; @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the turbulent fluctuating velocity and magnetic field respectively ; and @xmath61 and @xmath45 are the mean velocity and magnetic field .",
    "we remind that in the paper , the angle brackets are used for the ensemble average of the field which could contain the large - scale non - axisymmetric modes contributions as well as the axisymmetric modes of the mean field which is denoted by the over - bar .",
    "the mean flow is axisymmetric , i.e. , @xmath62 , and it is determined from solution of the angular momentum balance . in the fully nonlinear case",
    "the solution of the angular momentum balance is coupled with the mean - field dynamo equations and the mean - field equation for the heat transport .",
    "let @xmath63 and @xmath64 be vectors in the azimuthal and radial directions respectively , then we represent the mean magnetic field vectors as follows : @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the axisymmetric , and @xmath67 is non - axisymmetric part of the large - scale magnetic field , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 are scalar functions .",

    "the relative variations of the meridional circulation are about 1 percent of the mean flow which is much smaller than it is observed on the sun .",

    "the toroidal field does not penetrate to the surface because of the vacuum boundary conditions and this reduces the magnitude of the large - scale flow variations on the surface . unlike the sun ( see , eg , @xcite ) the predicted torsional oscillations have the equal magnitudes in the bulk of the star and at the surface .",
    "variations of the meridional circulation are concentrated to the surface .",
