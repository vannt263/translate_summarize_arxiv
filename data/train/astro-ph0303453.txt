    "as white dwarf stars are comparable in size to the earth , searches for terrestrial planets via transit of their parent stars should be capable of discovering white dwarf ( wd ) binaries as well .",
    "these can be distinguished from terrestrial planet systems because the wd will induce detectable doppler shifts in the spectral lines of a main sequence ( ms ) companion , whereas an earth - like planet will not , due to its smaller mass .",
    "an interesting coincidence is that the radius of a white dwarf in a tight binary is comparable to its einstein radius @xcite , which means that both gravitational lensing and eclipse may be important during transit .",
    "when combined with other information about the binary , observation of the change of magnitude during transit may allow measurement of the mass and radius of the white dwarf , allowing a test of the relation originally predicted by @xcite .",
    "recent measurements of white dwarf masses and radii using atmosphere models @xcite have modeling uncertainties , which would be useful to test with another technique , and the range of wd masses available in binaries is larger than for single stars .",
    "the four known eclipsing wd  m - dwarf binaries are a good start @xcite , but a larger , alternatively selected sample could allow measurement of the variation of the relation with wd mass , age , or composition .",
    "this paper addresses the question of how many white dwarf  main sequence ( wd  ms ) binaries might be found in searches for transiting planets , with application to the _ kepler _ @xcite and _ eddington _ @xcite missions .",
    "we concern ourselves with white dwarfs in detached binaries , since accreting white dwarfs can be found by other means . in @xmath3 2",
    "we discuss the various modes for discovery of white dwarfs and the surveys that might detect them , then in @xmath3 3 we describe the expected properties of wd ",
    "ms binaries in our galaxy . in @xmath3 4",
    "we estimate the number of binaries that might be found in the surveys mentioned above , in @xmath3 5 we discuss what one might do with any binaries discovered via this method , and in @xmath3 6 we conclude .    during the preparation of this paper",
    ", @xcite published a study of near - field wd microlensing for the _ kepler _ mission . in their paper , numerical lightcurves for fiducial systems",
    "are presented , similar to the analytic lightcurves presented in @xcite ; however , they did not attempt to accurately estimate the number of detectable systems , the goal of this paper .",
    "first we consider the case in which the wd passes in front of the ms star ( primary transit ) .",
    "the einstein radius is @xmath4^{1/2}$ ] , where @xmath5 is the gravitational radius for a lens of mass @xmath6 and @xmath7 is the semi - major axis of the binary .",
    "a white dwarf in a binary system has a size , @xmath8 , which is comparable to the einstein radius @xmath9 thus microlensed images ( which will appear a distance @xmath10 from the center of the wd ) may be occulted by the wd , so that we may have either dimming ( favored if @xmath11 , i.e. small @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) or amplification ( if @xmath12 , i.e. large @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) .",
    "if the occulting body ( here the wd ) is much smaller than the occulted body ( ms star ) , the microlensing plus occultation equations take on an exceptionally simple form @xcite , with the dimming or amplification dependent only on the surface brightness immediately behind the wd , so long as the wd is away from the edge of the ms star . the fractional change in flux during a transit",
    "is then given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 are the ms and wd fluxes respectively , @xmath15 is the radius of the ms star , @xmath16 is the projected distance of the wd from the center of the ms star , @xmath17 is the limb - darkened intensity profile of the source normalized to the flux - weighted mean intensity , and @xmath18 is the step function .    for close ( @xmath19 au ) wd  ms systems , @xmath20 , since @xmath21 , similar to the transit depth of a terrestrial planet , though the effect will be a flux increase when @xmath22 . in a system of random inclination @xmath23 on the sky ,",
    "the probability of transits along our line of sight is @xmath24 , and for a small transiting body , the transit duration will be @xmath25 , where @xmath26 and @xmath27 is the relative orbital velocity .    the fractional change of flux when the ms star passes in front of the wd ( secondary transit ) is simply given by @xmath28 .",
    "the transit will obviously be deeper for younger , more luminous wds .",
    "the luminosity of a typical wd 110 gyr after birth is of the order @xmath29 l@xmath30 , so that terrestrial planet searches should be well suited to detecting these events too .",
    "note that these will be flat - bottomed transits , but will have the same durations and transit probabilities as the complementary primary transit .",
    "if the orbit is circular , as will be the case for close systems , a given lightcurve will exhibit either both primary and secondary transits ( though the transit depths @xmath31 and @xmath32 may be very different ) or no transits at all .",
    "there are other types of variations in wd ",
    "ms lightcurves , including fluctuations as a result of tidal effects , both directly , due to tidal distortion of the ms star , and indirectly due to increased ms rotation rate and hence increased stellar variability , which is described in detail in   [ sec : var ] .",
    "in addition , we may see variations due to irradiation of the ms star by a hot wd in the very youngest wd systems , neglected here , or due to flickering if the wd is accreting at a low level from the ms stellar wind , also discussed in   [ sec : var ] .    since the predicted transit amplitudes are of the same order of magnitude as those for terrestrial planet transits ( @xmath33 magnitudes ) , surveys designed to search for other earths ought to pick up wd  ms systems too .",
    "to illustrate this , we use as examples the _ kepler _ @xcite and _ eddington _ @xcite missions .",
    "these satellites will continuously monitor the brightness of many stars at high photometric precision to search for periodic dimming characteristic of a transiting planet .",
    "_ kepler _ will monitor @xmath34 dwarf stars with @xmath35 in a @xmath36 field centered on galactic coordinates @xmath37 , for at least four years .",
    "the proposed _",
    "design is for a smaller @xmath38 field , with deeper magnitude limits ( @xmath39 ) and a lifetime of 3 years . in the absence",
    "of published coordinates for the _ eddington _ field , we use here the same @xmath40 as _ kepler_. _ kepler _ will have a broad bandpass , extending from @xmath41 400 to 850 nm , while _ eddington _ may have two - color information @xcite .",
    "_ kepler _ will read out fluxes every 15 minutes , and will have a fiducial sensitivity ( similar to that of _ eddington _ ) of @xmath42 for a 6.5-hour exposure of a @xmath43 g2v star .",
    "the evolution of a zero - age main sequence ( zams ) binary system to a white dwarf  main sequence ( wd  ms ) system proceeds via one of two main pathways , according to whether or not roche lobe overflow occurs en route , the critical initial orbital separation being at @xmath44 ; in both cases , the more massive star has evolved into a wd , while the other is still on the ms .",
    "the lifetime of this phase depends on the difference in main - sequence lifetimes of the two stars .",
    "if the primary fills its roche lobe on the rgb or agb , then the ensuing mass transfer will most likely be dynamically unstable and a common envelope phase will result ( see e.g. @xcite ) , in which the envelope of the evolved star is heated by friction as the secondary and the core of the giant orbit inside it .",
    "this ends when either the stars coalesce or the envelope is heated sufficiently that it escapes the system , leaving a wd ",
    "ms binary with greatly _ reduced _ orbital separation compared with the initial zams system .",
    "the orbit will be circular , since tidal circularization will have occurred in any system in which a giant star is close to overflow .",
    "if the orbital separation is sufficiently large that the primary does not overflow on the rgb or agb , then it is affected only as the primary loses its envelope in the planetary nebula phase , leading to an _ increase _ in the orbital separation .",
    "we therefore expect that the galactic wd ",
    "ms population will consist of two _ distinct _ groups of sources in @xmath45space , the `` short '' period systems from systems in which overflow has occurred , and the `` long '' period systems in which no roche lobe has been filled .",
    "a population synthesis approach was used to quantify the properties of the galactic wd  ms population .",
    "evolutionary tracks were computed using the rapid evolution bse code @xcite . following the preferred model a of hurley et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , we distribute the primary mass according to the initial mass function ( imf ) of @xcite , while the secondary mass distribution we choose to be flat in the mass ratio @xmath46 , for @xmath47 . the initial orbital semi - major axis distribution is flat in @xmath48 .",
    "these initial conditions , along with , most notably , a constant star formation rate over the age of the galaxy , a binary fraction of 100% , solar metallicity across all stars , a common envelope efficiency parameter as @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the binding energy of the envelope , and @xmath51 are the initial and final orbital energies , respectively . a smaller @xmath52 corresponds to a lower ejection efficiency and hence a larger loss of orbital energy , and greater orbital shrinkage .",
    "here we use @xmath53 , since this is found by hurley et al .",
    "( 2000 ) to best reproduce the galactic double degenerate population . ]",
    "@xmath53 , and zero initial orbital eccentricity , were found by hurley et al .",
    "( 2000 ) to best reproduce the observed numbers of double degenerate , symbiotic , cataclysmic variable and other binary star populations in the galaxy . here",
    ", we evolve pairs in which both stars have masses between 0.1 and 20 m@xmath30 , and the initial semi - major axis distribution extends from 2 to @xmath54 zams stellar diameters .",
    "note that the bse code uses the nauenberg ( 1972 ) mass - radius relation for wds .",
    "we distribute this population according to a double exponential disk model , with scale length 2.75 kpc . the scale height @xmath55 is chosen to vary according to stellar age @xmath56 , with @xmath57 , set equal to 100 pc for stars born today and to 300 pc for the oldest stars in the disk .",
    "we use the extinction corrections of @xcite , and thus model the stars in the _ kepler _ field of view within the magnitude limits of the survey .",
    "we normalize to the number of dwarf stars counted in this field ( @xmath58 with @xmath35 , from _ kepler _ webpage ; results can be re - scaled if this number is later revised ) .",
    "we estimate that the total number of wd  ms systems within this sample of stars is @xmath59 , while the _ eddington _ sample should contain @xmath41 35,000 wd ",
    "ms systems . the resulting orbital period distribution of target wd ",
    "ms systems is plotted in figure [ fig : period ] , and is seen to display the double - peaked structure expected from ",
    "[ sec : evol ] , with a relative dearth of systems with periods from months to years .",
    "a similar distribution was predicted by @xcite .",
    "the detectability depends on the signal - to - noise ratio of all transits combined in the time series for a given system .",
    "we require that the transit duration be at least 1 hour ( four _ kepler _ time - samples ) for detection .",
    "we assume photon counting statistics typically dominate the noise , but also add in a fractional instrumental noise of @xmath60 . for simplicity",
    ", we neglect limb - darkening .",
    "shorter period systems are doubly favored , since the time spent in transit and the probability of a transit in a system with random orientation both scale as @xmath61 . for this reason , _ kepler _ s sensitivity",
    " designed to detect the longer - period terrestrial systems  is easily good enough to detect a large fraction of the transiting wd  ms systems within the magnitude limits at good signal to noise .",
    "the same is not true of _ eddington _ , with its deeper magnitude limits , which restrict most detectable transits to lower - mass ms primaries .",
    "the properties of the detectable systems , assuming an @xmath62 detection threshold , and the parent population from which they are drawn , are illustrated in figures [ fig : period ] , [ fig : mass ] , and [ fig : dm ] for _ kepler_. the total numbers of wd  ms systems detectable are summarised for both _ kepler _ and _ eddington _ in table 1 .",
    "we split the transits into the three modes of detection described in ",
    "[ sec : wdvar ] . note that many systems have both detectable primary and secondary transits . for a blind search , a number of transits ( @xmath63 ) would need to be seen for detection as a periodic signal amongst the noise , but if radial velocity information were additionally available , it is possible that an identification could be made based on fewer transits . for this reason , systems at all periods",
    "are included as detectable ( weighted by their transit probabilities and appropriate signal - to - noise ratios ) ; if no such additional information is available , the curves in figure 1 should be cut off at about @xmath64 years , though it can be seen that this makes little difference to the overall number of detectable systems , as a result of the underlying wd ",
    "ms period distribution .",
    "we see from table 1 that several hundred transiting wd ",
    "ms systems are in principle detectable with each mission . however , the most serious ( and least well - defined ) limitation is still to be added : that of stellar variability noise , which is discussed in the following section",
    ".      the issue of stellar microvariability is of concern in terrestrial planet transit surveys ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "variability levels are higher , and hence more of a problem for wd  ms systems .",
    "this is because the majority of detectable systems ( fig .",
    "[ fig : period ] ) have short orbital periods , @xmath65d , and at these short periods , tidal effects due to the wd are significant ( note that the bse code follows tidal effects in detail ) .",
    "synchronization of the ms star s rotation with the orbital period is rapid if the ms star has a convective envelope ( @xmath66 ) and @xmath67d .",
    "this is the case for about half of the transits in principle detectable with _ kepler _ ( see fig . [",
    "fig : mass ] ) , and most for _ eddington_. rapidly rotating late - type stars display increased starspot activity @xcite , and hence greater photometric variability , due to these starspots rotating into and out of sight .",
    "individual spots persist for only a few rotational cycles , meaning that over time the variability has a random nature .",
    "the amplitude of this variability scales with rotational period approximately as @xmath68 .",
    "examination of the power spectrum of solar irradiance variations @xcite shows that this starspot noise is present up to frequencies @xmath69 .    of most importance in transit detection",
    "is the stellar noise on the timescale of a transit , since one can in principle filter out variability on other timescales ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) . for wd ",
    "ms systems with @xmath70d , we have @xmath71h . if a wd transit has @xmath72 , then the fractional starspot noise will be @xmath73 , and will drown out almost all wd transit signals , even if there are many transits during the survey lifetime .",
    "effectively this places a lower limit on the orbital period of detectable systems ( of around @xmath74d for typical systems ) . at frequencies",
    "@xmath75 , the noise is governed by convective ( super-)granulation , has an amplitude @xmath76 in the sun on the appropriate transit timescale , and is likely unaffected by rotation rate .",
    "this noise will however reduce detectability of faint transits .",
    "we approximate all convective stars as solar in these respects , and in table 1 show the sizable effects of adding this variability noise upon the detection rates for _ kepler _ , again requiring @xmath62 detections .",
    "the _ eddington _ mission , which will observe in two colors , may be able to use the color signature of the stellar variability to enhance detection probabilities @xcite , in which case our predictions without stellar variability may be more appropriate .",
    "more massive ms stars have radiative envelopes , and smaller @xmath77 for transits , since their radii are larger . for these stars ,",
    "there is less detailed literature available on stellar microvariability , so we do not attempt to calculate its expected impact on the wd  ms detection rate .",
    "we do however note that these stars can be intrinsically quite variable .",
    "since the radiative tide is weaker , systems are most likely asynchronous , but @xcite suggest that in this case , tides can excite the fundamental mode of pulsation of the star , potentially leading to oscillations on roughly the timescale of a transit .",
    "we note also that some observations ( e.g. @xcite ) suggest that stars in close binaries display greater activity than single stars of the same rotation rate .",
    "thus , the numbers of detectable systems given in table 1 for ms primaries with radiative envelopes are likely to be reduced by variability , but we have not attempted to quantify this reduction .",
    "extensive data on these topics may only be acquired once space - based transit searches fly .",
    "an additional source of microvariability in the lightcurve may be from flickering as the wd accretes at a low level from the ms star s wind . to have an accretion luminosity @xmath78",
    ", the wd needs to accrete at a rate @xmath79 , cf . the solar mass loss rate @xmath80 .",
    "only a fraction of the mass lost from the ms star will be accreted by the wd , though we note that stellar wind mass loss may be enhanced in close binaries .",
    "as can be seen from figure [ fig : period ] , it is unlikely that wds will provide a significant source of spurious earth - like transits at @xmath81 years , given the dearth of wd  ms systems and ( hypothesized ) large numbers of terrestrial planets at these periods . in addition , primary transits will be microlensing events at these periods . although wd companions are easily distinguished using radial - velocity observations , it is useful to know that terrestrial planet signatures will not be swamped by those of wds .    a large sample of close wd ",
    "ms systems would enable useful tests of binary star evolution theories ( such as common envelope evolution ) .",
    "also , if the mass and radius of the wd can be separately determined , then the wd mass - radius relation could be tested .",
    "the transiting wds can not , in general , be observed other than by their dimming effect upon the ms star , so that all properties must be inferred .",
    "this approach is however independent of wd atmosphere modeling .",
    "the _ kepler _ and _ eddington _ missions easily have the sensitivity to produce high - quality lightcurves of short - period wd  ms systems , since they are designed to search for longer - period terrestrial planets .",
    "the inclusion of stellar variability may affect this somewhat .",
    "however , there is still a population of @xmath82 wd  ms systems in principle detectable with each , given adequate signal processing power .",
    "many of these systems display both detectable primary and secondary transits , which can be distinguished using their transit profiles .",
    "wd transits are longer in duration than , and shaped differently from , grazing ms ",
    "ms transits of the same depth .",
    "radial velocity measurements should eliminate blending ( dilution of a larger transit depth to the expected wd ",
    "ms level due to the presence of a brighter star within the same resolution element ) as a source of confusion .",
    "this is simpler than in the planetary case , since wds induce larger radial velocity variations on the orbital timescale .",
    "if variability or ellipsoidal modulation of the ms star flux , radial velocity variations , or characteristic accretion luminosity from the wd , should draw attention to a system as a candidate close wd  ms system , then transit searches could also be targeted towards these sources , since the geometric transit probability can be of order 10% or more .",
    "provided none of these is a significant noise source on the transit timescale , discovery of the transits in the lightcurve is possible , and system parameters therefore extractable . although it has been proposed that systems displaying large radial velocity variations be left out of the _ kepler _ survey ( d. sasselov , private communication , 2003 ) , the findings of this paper strongly argue for the inclusion of candidate wd  ms systems in the target lists of transit surveys .",
    "it has been noted by @xcite that the sensitivity of _ kepler _ to habitable planets could be significantly increased by pushing the magnitude limit for red ms stars to @xmath83 .",
    "such a change would also be expected to increase the survey s sensitivity to wd ",
    "ms systems , since the typical orbital periods of transiting systems are shorter , and so the required signal - to - noise is more easily achieved .",
    "in addition , we expect there to be a large underlying population of late ms star  wd systems available for detection .",
    "however , it should be noted that later - type stars tend to be more photometrically variable , which may complicate the situation .",
    "we need 8 quantities to fully characterize a given system : @xmath84 , and @xmath85 .",
    "orbits are expected to be circular .",
    "the effect of microlensing complicates the parameter extraction in some sense , since the primary transit depth depends on both wd mass and radius .",
    "we have a number of observables from the transit lightcurves : @xmath86 , and the primary and secondary transit magnitude changes , @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "ingress / egress times , @xmath41minutes in duration , will be unmeasurable if the proposed 15 minute exposures of _ kepler _ are used . with radial velocity follow - up",
    ", we can also measure @xmath89 .",
    "more information is clearly necessary to solve for all system parameters .",
    "ms modeling can give us @xmath90 , and @xmath85 , at least in principle , though this may not be accurate for particularly active stars , or those which have passed through common envelopes . if the distance to the system is known ( for example from _ space interferometry mission _ parallax measurements )",
    "then the situation may be improved .",
    "if one is able to model the limb - darkening of the ms star in the primary transit then perhaps more information might be extracted .",
    "the potentially large numbers of such systems available in transit surveys make feasible statistical tests of wd and binary star theory .",
    "since the _ kepler _ and _ eddington _ missions are designed to detect terrestrial planets , they are ideal for detecting white dwarfs as well .",
    "white dwarfs have more modes of detection than planets due to their larger masses ( and luminosities ) , but their detection is complicated by the ( tidal ) effects of these larger masses . in principle , at least 50 new wd ",
    "ms systems might be unambiguously detected with either mission , while at most 500 could be detected if stellar variability were less significant than our estimates .",
    "follow - up observations of the systems might yield mass and radius estimates for the ( unseen except by transit ) wds , and hence give a test of the wd mass - radius relation , or of theories of binary star evolution .",
