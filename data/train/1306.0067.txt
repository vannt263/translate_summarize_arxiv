    "the offset angle @xmath60 can be tuned by rotating the magnetic field coils about the trap center or by adjusting a second set of orthogonally placed coils , but imperfections in the magnetic field make it difficult to know precisely how much they need to be adjusted _ a priori_. it is therefore crucial that @xmath58 be calibrated for each measurement .    none of the 5@xmath67 transitions are useful for such delicate angular calibration if driven with circularly polarized light",
    ". however , a suitable configuration could be to drive the @xmath68 m = 0 transition with horizontally polarized light ( electric field parallel to the x@xmath48-axis ) for which the rabi frequency , @xmath69 , is sharply peaked and symmetric about 90@xmath59 , as shown in fig .",

    "since the 300 mhz decoherence rate in @xcite was mostly due to magnetic field noise in an unshielded setup , we expect significant improvement to @xmath35 with the use of magnetic shielding .",
    "an alternative method to modulate @xmath6 , using only one position of @xmath50 , is to drive the transition with both senses of circular polarization . in this approach",

    "care must be taken , particularly with this approach , to have clean circular polarization in the 2051 nm beam .",

    "the transitions are driven by both the @xmath76 and @xmath77 components of the laser s electric field but coupling through m1 is suppressed by virtue of its angular momentum selection rule ,    @xmath78    when driven with vertically polarized light ( electric field parallel to y@xmath48-axis ) and @xmath79 both @xmath75 are maximized and flat to leading order in @xmath50 . a precise determination the 2051 nm field amplitude from @xmath75 would thus be relatively straightforward granted that the whole 2051 nm field amplitude can accurately be aligned in the vertical polarization state .",
    "a noteworthy alternative is to measure both @xmath80 and @xmath81 with the 2051 nm beam circularly polarized . with @xmath50",

    "measuring the components separately could be a useful check that pure circular polarization was achieved at the ion .",
    "precise and accurate control of the 2051 nm laser polarization will be of general concern to all aspects of the proposed measurement and is paramount to any trapped ion pnc measurement .",
    "while the polarization state of the 2051 nm beam can be controlled outside of the trap , stress induced birefringence in the viewports will tend to unpredictably distort the beam s polarization . in effect , each point on the viewport acts like a wave - plate with relative phase retardance @xmath84 and an unknown optical axis orientation @xmath85 , which can be either of the fast or slow axes .",
    "generally the relative phase difference seen by a beam of wavelength @xmath86 , that transmits through a transparent isotropic material under mechanical stress , is described by the stress - optic law @xcite :    @xmath87    where c is the stress - optics coefficient , t is the thickness of the sample , and @xmath88 and @xmath89 are first and second principle stresses , respectively .",
    "distortions of this type need to be limited to a few percent to make possible accurate determination of @xmath46 and the 2051 nm laser field strength .",
    "a direct measurement of the effect is difficult because the trapping apparatus is embedded within a vacuum system where the beam can not be easily accessed . in order to estimate the size of the effect",

    "the stress - optic law predicts that @xmath84 will be about three times less for a 2051 nm beam .",
    "the effect is further suppressed at 2051 nm by dispersion of the stress - optic coefficient @xcite , although it is unknown by how much . at the center of the viewport ,",
    "not accounting for dispersion , a wave - plate retardance of @xmath100 can be expected for a 2051 nm beam . if left uncorrected this value would shift m1 by about 5% .",
    "this indicates that distortions in 2051 nm polarization from stress induced birefringence can likely be tolerated for the m1 measurement .",
    "however these distortions will need to be further suppressed or compensated for in a trapped ion pnc measurement .",
    "a parity nonconservation experiment with single trapped ba@xmath1 requires the magnetic dipole transition moment for the 2051 nm @xmath101 transitions be known . to date , there is one calculation of m1 and it predicts a value dominated by electron - electron correlation effects @xcite .",

    "the 2051 nm beam alignment is controlled by rotating the ion s quantization axis symmetrically about 90@xmath59 .",
    "a second approach is to drive the transition with either sense of circular polarization , which has the equivalent effect .",
    "these two approaches suffer from different systematics and can therefore be used to check for consistency . to extract m1 from @xmath46 the 2051 nm beam alignment and intensity need",
    "we suggest that these can be had from measurements of the rabi frequencies for transitions to particular @xmath8 states with judiciously selected 2051 nm beam polarizations .",
    "the feasibility of the measurement , in either approach , therefore depends critically on the ability to carefully control the 2051 nm beam s polarization .",
    "a general concern to the proposed measurement is the effect that stress induced birefringece will have on the polarization of a 2051 nm beam . to estimate how much polarization distortion can be expected we have measured the effect in a test viewport .",
    "unfortunately it is difficult to measure the effect directly with the 2051 nm beam so we have used 650 nm beam instead .",
    "stress induced biregringence falls off faster than 1/@xmath86 and accordingly our measurements place an upper bound for what will be found with the 2051 nm beam .",
