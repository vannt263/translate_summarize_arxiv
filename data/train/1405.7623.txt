    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is the fundamental quantum field theory of quarks and gluons . in its strong coupling regime",
    "it should explain the masses and other properties of hadrons .",
    "conventional hadrons are composed of either a valence quark @xmath10 and antiquark @xmath11 ( mesons ) or three valence quarks ( baryons ) on top of the sea of quark - antiquark pairs and gluons .",
    "one of the most notable and perhaps surprising features until recently was the complete absence of exotic hadrons like @xmath12 or @xmath13 .",
    "this has changed due to fascinating experimental discoveries over the past seven years .",
    "most of the newly discovered exotic states have unconventional flavor content , likely @xmath14 , and spin and parity quantum numbers @xmath15 .",
    "the first of these states was the @xmath16 , discovered in 2007 by belle @xcite , remained unconfirmed by babar @xcite , and was recently confirmed by lhcb @xcite . in recent years",
    "several similar states have been found by experiment .",
    "the @xmath17 was discovered slightly above @xmath7 threshold by besiii @xcite , and was confirmed by belle @xcite as well as using cleo - c data @xcite .",
    "the spin and parity of @xmath18 are unclear , and it may correspond to the same state as @xmath19 with @xmath15 @xcite . the pair @xmath20 @xcite and @xmath21 @xcite , which may correspond to the same state , was found by besiii slightly above @xmath8 threshold .",
    "their spin and parity are unclear and @xmath22 is preferred .",
    "finally , @xmath23 was reported in 2014 by belle @xcite favoring @xmath15 .",
    "all these states have g - parity @xmath24 while their neutral partners have charge conjugation @xmath25",
    ". therefore we focus on the channel with @xmath3 .    on the theoretical side",
    ", these states have been related to mesonic molecules , diquark - antidiquark structures , hadrocharmonium @xcite or born - oppenheimer tetraquarks @xcite .",
    "however the existence of these states within qcd has not yet been settled .",
    "while these states have been addressed theoretically with a number of phenomenological approaches like quark models , ( unitarized ) effective field theory and qcd sum rules ( for reviews with references see @xcite ) , these approaches are either not based directly on qcd or they depend on parameters ( i.e. , low energy constants ) that are not present in the qcd lagrangian . the existence of @xmath0 has never been established from first - principle qcd . the problem is a large magnitude of the strong coupling constant @xmath26 at the hadronic energy scale , hence a perturbative expansion is not successful .",
    "lattice qcd represents the only non - perturbative approach that is based directly on qcd , depending only on parameters @xmath27 and @xmath26 that appear in the qcd lagrangian .",
    "therefore it is an urgent theoretical task to establish whether qcd supports the presence of an exotic state with quark content @xmath28 using ab - initio lattice qcd . in a lattice qcd simulation ,",
    "the states are identified from discrete energy - levels @xmath29 and in principle all eigenstates with the given quantum number @xmath3 appear . in searching for @xmath0 candidates the whole finite volume spectrum needs to be identified . in particular eigenstates with significant @xmath4 ,",
    "@xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 components appear which presents a major challenge .",
    "the first lattice simulation aimed at @xmath18 focused on the region below @xmath30gev and found only two - particle states @xmath31 and @xmath7 and no indication for @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the second simulation studied @xmath7 scattering near threshold in the same channel and did not yield any indication for @xmath18 either @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we extend the search for candidates in the channel @xmath3 up to @xmath2gev ( for our setup with @xmath32 mev ) .",
    "the task is to determine the discrete spectrum in this channel with the challenging aim to establish all expected energy levels .",
    "the main question is whether there are any extra energy levels in addition to the number of expected two - meson states .",
    "an additional energy level near @xmath33 would be a definite signature for a @xmath0 with an approximate mass @xmath34 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii discusses expected two - meson states below @xmath35gev .",
    "section iii details how energy levels and overlaps are extracted , while section iv is dedicated to the results . in section v we summarize cautionary remarks and lessons which may be useful for future lattice simulations , and we conclude in section vi .",
    "in lattice qcd the states are identified from discrete energy - levels @xmath29 and in principle all finite volume eigenstates with given quantum numbers appear .",
    "the eigenstate of interest gives an energy level at @xmath36 if @xmath37 exists and is not too broad .",
    "however , various two - meson states @xmath38 have the same quantum numbers which presents a major challenge .",
    "individual momenta are discretized due to the periodic boundary conditions in space .",
    "if the two mesons do not interact , then @xmath39 with @xmath40 , and the energies of @xmath41 states for @xmath42 are @xmath43 with @xmath44 .",
    "these values are slightly shifted in presence of the interaction . in experiment",
    ", these states correspond to the two - meson decay products with a continuous energy spectrum . in the current study we neglect possible channels with three or more mesons .",
    "our simulation employs dynamical @xmath45 and @xmath46 quarks that correspond to the pion mass @xmath47mev @xcite .",
    "the lattice spacing is @xmath48fm .",
    "the rather small box @xmath49 with @xmath50fm may lead to sizable finite volume corrections , but it is responsible for a crucial practical advantage .",
    "it makes the @xmath0 search tractable since it reduces the number of @xmath41 states in the considered energy range , as discussed in section [ sec_v ] .    on our lattice",
    "( with @xmath32 mev ) the two - particle states with @xmath51 and total momentum zero in the energy region of interest @xmath52gev aregev as argued below . ]",

    "[ fig : eff]b and the values follow from the masses and single - meson energies determined on the same set of gauge configurations @xcite . establishing two - meson states up to @xmath35gev at @xmath32 mev should suffice for searching fairly narrow exotic candidates with mass below @xmath55gev for physical pion mass .",
    "the @xmath56 in ( [ mm ] ) denotes @xmath57 .",
    "the appearance of @xmath58 , where @xmath59 denotes the charmonium with @xmath60 , is an artifact due to reduced symmetry on the cubic lattice as discussed in appendix [ app_a ] .",

    "the @xmath64 lies near @xmath65gev , but is not listed in ( [ mm ] ) since this is the only two - meson state below @xmath35gev that we do not aim to extract due to the arguments given in appendix [ app_a ] .",
    "the energy of @xmath66 is extracted from the diagonal correlator of @xmath67 neglecting the resonance nature of the @xmath68 .",
    "our aim is to extract and identify all two - particle energy - levels ( [ mm ] ) from the full , coupled correlator matrix of hadron operators and establish whether qcd predicts additional states related to the exotic @xmath0 hadron .",
    "this goal presents a considerable challenge by itself .",
    "note that a rigorous treatment ( via a lscher - type finite volume formalism @xcite ) would require the determination of the scattering matrix for all two - particle channels that couple , and a subsequent determination of the mass and the width for any @xmath0 resonance(s ) .",
    "the elastic scattering within a single channel has been rigorously treated by a number of lattice simulations recently .",
    "the first lattice simulation aimed at determining scattering matrix for two - coupled channels @xcite also shows promise in this respect , while the rigorous treatment of seven coupled channels is still beyond the capabilities of any lattice simulation at present .",
    "therefore we take a simplified approach where the existence of @xmath0 is investigated by analyzing the number of energy levels , their positions and overlaps with the considered lattice operators @xmath69 .",
    "the formalism does predict an appearance of a level in addition to the ( shifted ) two - particle levels if there is a relatively narrow resonance in one channel .",
    "we have , for example , found additional levels related to the resonances @xmath68 @xcite , @xmath70 @xcite , @xmath71 @xcite , and the bound state @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "additional levels related to @xmath73 @xcite and @xmath74 @xcite have been found in the simulations of two coupled channels . based on this experience , we expect an additional energy level if @xmath37 is of similar origin , i.e. if it corresponds to a pole of the scattering matrix near physical axis .",
    "the energies @xmath29 and the overlaps @xmath75 of the eigenstates @xmath76 are extracted from the correlator matrix @xmath77 the physical system for given quantum numbers is created from the vacuum @xmath78 using creation operators @xmath79 at time @xmath80 and the system propagates for time @xmath81 before being annihilated at @xmath82 by @xmath83 .",
    "the creation / annihilation operators are called interpolators .",
    "our correlation matrix is averaged over every second @xmath80 .",
    "we employ 22 interpolators @xmath84 that couple well to the two - meson states and the choice is expected to be complete enough to render all two - meson states listed in ( [ mm ] ) . in addition , we implement 4 diquark - antidiquark interpolators @xmath85 with structure @xmath86_{3_c}[cu]_{\\bar 3_c}$ ] which is expected to couple well to possible @xmath0 if it has a sizable fock component of this kind .",
    "we point out that @xmath87_{3_c}[cu]_{\\bar 3_c}$ ] couples also to two - meson states via fierz rearrangement .",
    "representative examples of employed interpolators are @xmath88 while the full list of interpolators together with related details is provided in appendix [ app_a ] .    the momenta are projected separately for each meson in @xmath84 as @xmath89 .",
    "all quark fields are smeared according to the distillation method @xcite .",
    "the wick contractions for the matrix of correlators ( [ c ] ) with @xmath90 involve only diagrams where the light quarks @xmath91 and @xmath45 propagate from source to sink .",
    "concerning charm quarks , there are diagrams where they propagate from source to sink and diagrams where charm quarks annihilate ( fig .",
    "[ fig : contractions ] in appendix [ app_b ] ) .",
    "the second class represents mixing with channels that contain no charm quarks , their effect is suppressed due to the okubo - zweig - iizuka rule , and the experiments do not observe these decay channels in the region of interest .",
    "the results in the present work are therefore based on the contractions in fig .",
    "[ fig : contractions]a , where charm quarks propagate from source to sink .",

    "we employ the fermilab method @xcite , where discretization uncertainties are suppressed in the difference @xmath101 with the spin - average mass @xmath102 .",
    "the same method and tuning of the charm quark mass @xmath103 lead to a good agreement with experiment for conventional charmonium @xcite , masses and widths of @xmath104 mesons @xcite , and the @xmath105 spectrum @xcite on this ensemble . in view of this",

    "[ fig : eff]a to show their relation to the continuum of scattering states in experiment .",
    "we interpret the lowest thirteen levels ( indicated by black circles ) as interacting two - particle states for the following reasons :    * the levels appear near the non - interacting energies ( [ e ] ) of the two - particle states ( [ mm ] ) . *",
    "each of these levels @xmath76 has the largest overlap with the corresponding @xmath84 .",

    ", we can not attribute this level to @xmath0 candidate as we can not rule out that it corresponds to one of omitted two - meson states above @xmath35gev .",
    "the main conclusion of our simulation is that we do not find any additional state below @xmath2gev that could be related to an exotic candidate .",
    "we only find the expected two - meson states ( [ mm ] ) .",
    "it is indeed surprising that with a basis ( [ o ] ) , which contains a great variety of interpolating fields with the quantum numbers of interest ( @xmath3 ) , one does not , for example , induce @xmath116 that has been confirmed by several experiments @xcite .",
    "note that our list of creation / annihilation operators ( [ o ] ) contains also a number of field structures @xmath117 and @xmath7 which correspond to channels where these resonances have been found in experiments    we list several possible reasons for the absence of an energy levels related to the exotic @xmath0 candidate in our simulation :    * the resonance @xmath18 was found in @xmath118 invariant mass only through @xmath119 @xcite .",

    "furthermore , our set of eighteen interpolators @xmath130 may not be complete enough to render a @xmath0 candidate in addition to thirteen two - meson states , even if @xmath0 existed at @xmath131mev . *",
    "if significant s - wave d - wave mixing is vital for creating the observed experimental spectrum our setup might be unsuitable and we would probably miss an energy level emerging from this mixing . *",
    "based on the experience discussed in section ii we would expect an additional energy level if the @xmath0 state was a resonance associated to pole near the real axis in the unphysical riemann sheet .",
    "the absence of an additional energy level could also indicate a different origin of the experimental peak like , e.g. , a coupled - channel threshold effect .",

    "the ground state for the quantum numbers in our study is @xmath4 and we observe it for most interpolators at large @xmath81 after the exponentials due to higher states have died out .",

    "[ fig : eff_cautionary]g .",
    "looking at the ground state of the diquark - antidiquark correlators alone , one can not reach conclusions regarding @xmath0 .",

    "the coupling to @xmath4 , @xmath9 ( and possibly some others ) has to be taken into account , as shown by our study .",
    "these cautionary remarks also apply to qcd sum - rule studies that are based on correlators .          here",
    "we show an example why the @xmath0 candidate is not reliable as long as not all two - meson states with lower energy values and at least one nearby state with higher energy have been established . we illustrate that by a simulation @xcite that aims at extracting nine two - meson states @xmath137 @xmath138@xmath139 @xmath140 using a correspondingly chosen interpolator basis ( numbered according to ( [ o ] ) ) @xmath141 which should suffice for the extraction of the mentioned nine two - meson states and possibly an additional exotic candidate .    the spectrum in fig .
