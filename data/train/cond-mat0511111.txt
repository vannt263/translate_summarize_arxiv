    "soft glassy materials , such as dense colloidal suspensions and super - cooled liquids , exhibit diverse rheological phenomena @xcite .",
    "typical examples are the decrease of the viscosity with increasing the shear rate , called _ shear thinning _ , and the increase of the viscosity with the shear rate , called _",
    "shear thickening_. these phenomena appear when the shear rate is beyond the newtonian regime , that is , the regime in which the shear stress @xmath2 depends linearly on the shear rate @xmath3 , and hence the viscosity , @xmath4 , is independent of the shear rate .",
    "interestingly , the newtonian regime becomes narrower as the temperature decreases and the density increases , and eventually it disappears . in the case",
    "that there exists no newtonian regime , the stress is finite in the limit @xmath5 .",
    "this stress is called the _ dynamic yield stress_. we seek to understand these rheological properties systematically on the basis of a microscopic description of the system .    recently , the nonlinear rheology of soft glassy materials has been studied extensively through use of molecular dynamics simulations @xcite , analysis of random spin models @xcite , and mode coupling theory applied to systems under shear @xcite . in particular , the mode coupling theory have predicted that the dynamic yield stress appears discontinuously at the glass transition point @xcite and the results have been compared with a numerical simulation @xcite and an experiment @xcite . on the other hand , the power law",
    "@xmath6 has been observed for a shear thinning fluids @xcite .    among theoretical approaches ,",
    "one standard method for microscopic study of nonlinear rheology is based on the mode coupling theory . in this theory ,",
    "the singular behavior of the viscosity is described by the anomalous part of the time correlation function , using a generalized green - kubo formula @xcite . as another approach describing the singular behavior",
    ", one could focus on the shear stress . here",
    ", let us recall that the shear stress @xmath2 is defined as the average of the @xmath7 component of the inter - particle force acting on a plane transverse to the @xmath8 direction .",
    "when there exist only two - body forces among the particles , this average can be expressed in terms of the pair distribution function .",
    "therefore , in this case , the rheological properties mentioned above can be accounted for through an analysis of the pair distribution function .    employing an approach of the latter type , in the present letter",
    ", we first investigate the linear stability of the equilibrium pair distribution function .",
    "we find that this function is unstable in the regime of low temperature and high density .",
    "next , applying a bifurcation analysis to a system near a critical state at which the stability changes , we derive an order parameter equation that describes the appearance of a dynamic yield stress in a simple manner .",
    "we consider a system consisting of @xmath9 spherical colloidal particles suspended in a solvent under shear flow described by @xmath10 .",
    "we denote the volume of the system by @xmath11 and the temperature by @xmath12 .",
    "let @xmath13 represent the particle positions .",
    "the time dependent distribution function for @xmath14 , @xmath15 , satisfies the smoluchowski equation @xcite @xmath16 here , the boltzmann constant is set to unity , @xmath17 is the friction coefficient , and @xmath18 is the interaction force defined by @xmath19 in this work , we employ the lennard - jones potential , with the explicit form @xmath20 $ ] . in the treatment",
    "below , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath17 are set to unity , and all quantities are converted to dimensionless forms .    from the @xmath9 particle distribution function @xmath15",
    ", the pair distribution function @xmath23 is defined as @xmath24 where @xmath25 . using this function",
    ", we can express the time - dependent shear stress as @xcite @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the average number density of the colloidal particles , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 . here , we have ignored the hydrodynamic contribution to the shear stress .    it is useful to expand @xmath23 in spherical harmonics , and we write @xmath30 employing the spherical coordinate system @xmath31 .",
    "hence , substituting equation into equation , we obtain @xmath32 this expression clearly indicates that if there is singular behavior of the shear stress @xmath2 , that of the pair distribution function can be observed . in particular",
    ", the existence of a dynamic yield stress implies that the pair distribution function in the limit @xmath33 differs from the equilibrium one .",
    "this observation naturally leads us to conjecture that the dynamic yield stress is related to the instability of the equilibrium pair distribution function , @xmath34 .",
    "for this reason , we carry out a linear stability analysis of @xmath34 .    in order to determine the linear stability of @xmath34",
    ", we need to study the time evolution of the pair distribution function .",
    "this is described by the bbgky hierarchy , and hence it is determined by the three - particle distribution function @xmath35 . in order to obtain a self - contained description , we truncate the bbgky hierarchy by employing the kirkwood superposition approximation , assuming the relation @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "this approximation has been used in the calculation of the pair distribution function for both an equilibrium system @xcite and a non - equilibrium system under shear @xcite . with this approximation , the evolution equation for the pair distribution function",
    "is derived as @xmath37 with @xmath38",
    "first , the equilibrium pair distribution function @xmath34 for this model is obtained as the isotropic solution of the equation @xmath39 in equation with @xmath40 .",
    "this equation is called the born - green equation @xcite , which has been solved numerically @xcite . then , writing @xmath41 we substitute equation into equations and and obtain the form @xmath42 where @xmath43 is a linear operator and @xmath44 contains only second and third order polynomials in @xmath45 .    because the equilibrium pair distribution function @xmath34 is non - negative , it is linearly unstable if and only if the linear operator @xmath43 has a positive eigenvalue . therefore , in order to determine the linear stability of @xmath34 , we could numerically compute the eigenvalues of @xmath43 .",
    "however , due to the three - dimensional spatial dependence of @xmath45 , the computation of these eigenvalues is not simple .",
    "therefore , to simplify the problem , we assume perturbations @xmath45 of the form @xmath46 . such an assumption is reasonable , because the equilibrium pair distribution function is expected to be unstable with respect to perturbations of the form @xmath47 in the regime characterized by low temperature and high density .",
    "( see equations and ) .",
    "then , using the explicit form of @xmath43 , we can rewrite @xmath48 in equation as @xmath49 to solve the linear stability problem , we seek the eigenvalues of @xmath50 .",
    "the eigenvalues of the operator @xmath50 are computed numerically in the following way .",
    "we first restrict the spatial domain of @xmath51 to the interval @xmath52 $ ] , with the boundary conditions @xmath53 at @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "we next approximate the linear operator @xmath50 as a matrix @xmath56 by using a difference method with a spatial mesh size @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "we calculated the eigenvalues of @xmath56 for many values of @xmath58 .    in",
    ", we display the stability diagram obtained numerically .",
    "it is seen that the pair distribution function @xmath34 is unstable in the low temperature , high density regime .",
    "note that the form of the boundary between the two regimes is qualitatively similar to the curve representing the glass transition in the @xmath58 plane calculated using mode coupling theory @xcite , though at each density , the value of the temperature on the boundary in the present case is approximately twice that in the glass transition case .",
    "this overestimate of the temperature might be caused by the inaccuracy of the equilibrium pair distribution function @xmath34 calculated with the kirkwood superposition approximation .",
    "indeed , it has been known that the maximum of @xmath34 obtained by this approximation is less pronounced and is shifted towards smaller interparticle distances than that obtained by monte carlo simulations",
    ".     plane .",
    "the squares indicate states where the maximum eigenvalue of @xmath56 is positive , and hence where @xmath34 is unstable .",
    "this result was obtained for the numerical values @xmath59 and @xmath60 . ]",
    "next , we focus on systems near the critical state at which the stability changes .",
    "if we fix the density , then we find that there exists a critical temperature @xmath61 below which the equilibrium pair distribution function @xmath34 is unstable .",
    "let @xmath62 be the critical eigenfunction of the operator @xmath63 at @xmath64 .",
    "then , we write a perturbation @xmath45 in the form @xmath65 here , @xmath66 represents the contribution to @xmath45 that is not from the critical mode , and we have assumed that its time dependence is restricted to that of the amplitude @xmath67 .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption because the amplitudes of non - critical modes decay quickly to the values determined by @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "then , using a bifurcation analysis ( see reference @xcite as a review ) , from equations and , we perturbatively obtain the evolution equation for @xmath68 in the form @xmath69 where @xmath70 is a positive constant , and the functions @xmath71 and @xmath72 can be calculated from equation @xcite . in this letter , we do not calculate @xmath71 and @xmath72 . instead ,",
    "considering the general forms of these functions , we qualitatively describe the singular behavior of the shear stress .",
    "first , because the system possesses symmetry with respect to the simultaneous transformation @xmath73 and @xmath74 , @xmath71 must be odd function and @xmath72 an even function .",
    "we therefore expand as @xmath75 @xmath76    next , let @xmath77 be a stable stationary solution of equation .",
    "then , from equations and , the shear stress for systems near the critical state @xmath64 and @xmath78 can be approximately expressed as @xmath79 because @xmath66 in equation contains no terms linear in @xmath67 as we have confirmed .",
    "thus , the value of @xmath77 determines the behavior of the shear stress near the critical state . in this sense",
    ", the amplitude of the critical mode can be regarded as an order parameter describing the appearance of the dynamic yield stress .",
    "now , we investigate equation . for @xmath80 ,",
    "this equation possesses the trivial stationary solution @xmath81 .",
    "this solution is stable only when @xmath82 .",
    "the non - trivial stationary solutions depend on the form of @xmath71 .",
    "first , let us consider the case that @xmath83 in equation .",
    "( we conjecture that @xmath84 for the model we study . ) then , for @xmath85 and @xmath86 , @xmath87 satisfies @xmath88 under the assumption that @xmath89 and @xmath90 are expressed as power - law functions of @xmath91 .",
    "thus , in the limit @xmath92 , the shear stress is obtained as a function of the temperature near @xmath64 .",
    "the qualitative form of this function is displayed in the left side of .",
    "it is seen that the dynamic yield stress increases continuously from zero as @xmath12 decreases from @xmath61 . by contrast , when @xmath64 and @xmath93 , we obtain @xmath94 with @xmath95 .",
    "this @xmath1 corresponds to that appearing in the relation @xmath96 describing critical phenomena for magnetic materials , and the value @xmath95 is the mean field value for the ising model .",
    "note that equation yields @xmath97 .",
    "the exponent @xmath98 is called the _ shear thinning exponent _ , and we find it to be @xmath0 in this analysis .",
    "we also find that when @xmath99 , a newtonian regime appears near @xmath78 .",
    "this regime is connected to the power law regime that exists for higher shear rates . as seen in the inset of the left side of",
    ", this behavior corresponds to shear thinning .    .",
    "the solid curve represents stable states , and the dashed line unstable states .",
    "the inset compares the dependence of @xmath2 on @xmath100 in the three cases @xmath101 , @xmath64 and @xmath102 .",
    "left : the case that @xmath83 .",
    "right : the case that @xmath103 and @xmath104 ]    next , we consider the case @xmath105 and find that here , a qualitatively different form of the stress is obtained .",
    "( we expect that there do exist models in which @xmath103 , although we believe that the model studied presently is not one of these . )",
    "one physically plausible situation is that in which @xmath104 , where we have the form displayed in the right side of . in this case , as the temperature is decreased , the dynamic yield stress increases discontinuously from zero to a finite value at some temperature @xmath106(@xmath107 ) , as shown in the right side of .",
    "furthermore , it is easily confirmed that shear thickening exists when @xmath108 .",
    "the main finding of this letter is that the order parameter equation given in equation provides a simple description of the nonlinear rheological phenomena exhibited by the systems considered here .",
    "we note that the order parameter in our model is defined to be the amplitude of the critical mode of the pair distribution function , which is related to the equal time correlation function of the density .",
    "this contrasts with the situation for the critical phenomena of liquid - gas phase transitions , for which the order parameter is defined in terms of the critical mode of the density .",
    "consideration of this difference might help elucidate the essence of the glass transition .",
    "we conjecture that the coefficient @xmath109 is negative for the model we study .",
    "this indicates that the dynamic yield stress appears continuously from @xmath110 at the transition point .",
    "this result is different from that obtained by the mode coupling theory that predicts the discontinuous appearance of the dynamic yield stress .",
    "note that the recent result in ref .",
    "@xcite might support the discontinuous onset , while the power - law behavior consistent with our result is still observed in the range @xmath111 in this report .",
    "our simple theory in the present version might miss some important physical effects .",
    "we will study further in order to understand this discrepancy .",
    "finally , we present remarks regarding the two assumptions we employed in our analysis .",
    "first , the perturbations to @xmath34 are assumed to be restricted to the form @xmath46 for simplicity . here",
    ", we note that we already performed the analysis without this restriction and obtained the same stability diagram @xcite . in this analysis",
    ", the five critical modes , which correspond to @xmath2 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 , and @xmath115 , appear simultaneously at @xmath116 as the result of the rotational symmetry .",
    "then , five order parameters are defined in association with these critical modes . we will report the result in another paper .",
    "second , with regard to the kirkwood superposition approximation , we consider that it has some analogy with a mean field theory for critical phenomena .",
    "therefore , we expect that the time evolution of the five order parameter fields ( that depend on the spatial coordinate ) under the influence of noise can describe rheological phenomena more precisely .",
    "this extension might modify the critical exponent @xmath1 , and also it might play an important role in the description of phenomena for the case @xmath117 .",
    "we wish to develop such a theory as a natural extension of our analysis in this letter .",
