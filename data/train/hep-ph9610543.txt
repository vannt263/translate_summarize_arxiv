    "a direct goal of studying the inclusive semileptonic b meson decay @xmath4 is to determine the standard model parameter @xmath5 accurately .",
    "the semileptonic decay width can be expressed as @xmath6 the first term in ( [ eq : divd ] ) results from the @xmath7 transition .",
    "the second term in ( [ eq : divd ] ) is due to the @xmath8 transition and is negligible in comparison with the first term since @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the semileptonic decay width is determined by two measured quantities : the inclusive semileptonic b decay branching ratio @xmath11 and the b meson lifetime @xmath12 , @xmath13 therefore , the ckm matrix element @xmath5 can be determined through @xmath14 with the theoretical input @xmath15 .",
    "theory is needed to calculate @xmath15 and to understand quantitatively uncertainties in this calculation .",
    "the main obstacle to this end is the difficulty of taking into account nonperturbative qcd effects on the underlying weak decay process .    in recent years",
    "a heavy quark expansion approach to inclusive b decays has been developed [ 17 ] to account for nonperturbative qcd effects .",
    "this approach is based on the operator product expansion and the heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) .",
    "an operator product expansion on the time ordered product of two currents is performed .",
    "the momentum of the incoming b quark is written as @xmath16 ( @xmath17 stands for the b quark mass and @xmath18 the b hadron velocity ) and the residual momentum , @xmath19 , is expanded in . for keeping track of the @xmath17 dependence of matrix elements ,",
    "the b quark operators in full qcd are matched onto those in the hqet .",
    "the leading term of the expansion coincides with the free quark decay model .",
    "the next terms are computed in powers of @xmath20 , where no @xmath20 term appears .",
    "the calculations @xcite in the heavy quark expansion approach claimed that nonperturbative qcd contributions _ decrease _ the semileptonic decay width by a few percent with respect to the free quark decay width .",
    "there are , however , theoretical limitations in this approach @xcite .",
    "the operator product expansion breaks down for low ",
    "mass final hadronic states .",
    "in particular , the endpoint singularities of the lepton spectra indicate a failure of the operator product expansion .",
    "moreover , the truncation of the expansion enforces the use of quark kinematics rather than physical hadron kinematics . describing the lepton spectra demands a resummation of the heavy quark expansion @xcite .",
    "there remains a need to clarify the consequence of the theoretical limitations for the calculation of the semileptonic decay width , as it is desirable to improve the accuracy in the independent determination can be also determined independently from exclusive semileptonic b decays .",
    "] of @xmath21 from the inclusive semileptonic b decay with theoretical refinements .",
    "the resummation of the heavy quark expansion introduces @xcite a distribution function ( `` shape function '' ) of the @xmath3 quark in the b meson , which incorporates nonperturbative qcd effects .",
    "a similar distribution function arises @xcite from the light ",
    "cone dominance in the inclusive semileptonic b meson decays .",
    "the introduction of the distribution function eliminates the theoretical difficulties mentioned above , namely the endpoint singularities are absent and the use of physical hadron kinematics is allowed ( but does not arise `` for free '' ) .    in this paper",
    "we will use the light ",
    "cone approach @xcite to calculate the nonperturbative qcd contributions .",
    "this approach describes the decay by using the light  cone expansion and the hqet , which provides a theoretical justification for the dis - like parton model @xcite .",
    "the predicted electron energy spectrum agrees well with the experimental measurement @xcite .",
    "the use of physical hadron kinematics is built into this approach explicitly , so that both dynamic and kinematic effects of nonperturbative qcd are properly taken into account .",
    "the latter is shown to be quantitatively crucial .",
    "we find an about @xmath22 enhancement of the semileptonic decay width with respect to the free quark decay width by nonperturbative qcd contributions , in contrast to the results obtained in the heavy quark expansion approach .",
    "the reason of the enhancement is the following .",
    "there are two components  dynamics and kinematics  of nonperturbative qcd effects on inclusive semileptonic b decays .",
    "first , the decay dynamics deviates from the free quark decay dynamics as quarks are confined in hadrons and can never be free . however , the dynamic deviation changes the decay width only slightly since the @xmath3 quark inside the b meson is almost on shell .",
    "second , the decay kinematics gets changed .",
    "the phase space extends from the quark level to the hadron level ( the detailed formulas will be given below in ( [ eq : ha1])([eq : ha3 ] ) for hadron kinematics and in ( [ eq : qu1 ] ) and ( [ eq : qu2 ] ) for quark kinematics ) , shown in fig.[fig : ext1 ] for the @xmath7 decay .",
    "the phase - space extension arises from the difference in the b meson and @xmath3 quark masses and the fact that the mass of the decay product quark is fixed in the free quark decay picture , while the mass of the final hadronic state is actually changeable .",
    "the phase - space effect is a dominating factor , as indicated by the replacement of the @xmath3-quark mass with the @xmath0-meson mass in the decay rate .",
    "it is thus important to include this type of contributions to the decay width .",
    "consequently , it is conceivable that the net effect of nonperturbative qcd _ enhances _ the semileptonic decay width .",
    "the negative contribution found in previous studies in the heavy quark expansion approach is just a reflection of incompleteness of the calculation , which fails to take into account , in particular , a large part of nonperturbative qcd contributions due to the phase - space effect .",
    "we will describe the approach in section 2 and analyse nonperturbative qcd contributions in comparison with the heavy quark expansion and extract then @xmath2 from the inclusive semileptonic b meson decay in section 3 and finally conclude and discuss in section 4 .",
    "the semileptonic decay width can be split into two parts : one , denoted by @xmath23 , includes nonperturbative qcd contributions , the other results from perturbative qcd corrections to the decay width , denoted by @xmath24 .",
    "namely , @xmath25    nonperturbative qcd effects are contained in the hadronic tensor @xmath26 .",
    "it can be written in terms of a current commutator taken between b states : @xmath27\\right|b\\rangle , \\ ] ] where @xmath28 is the momentum transfer to the final lepton pair .",
    "@xmath29 refers to the b - meson state with energy @xmath30 and is normalized according to @xmath31 .",
    "it is well known that integrals like the one in eq.(5 ) are dominated by distances where @xmath32 for inclusive semileptonic b - meson decays , the momentum transfer squared @xmath33 is timelike and varies in the physical range @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 represent the b - meson mass and the minimum value of the invariant mass of the hadronic final state , respectively .",
    "due to the large b - meson mass , extended regions of phase space involve large values of @xmath33 ( see also fig.1 ) .",
    "therefore , the decay is dominated by light ",
    "cone distances between the two currents in eq.(5 ) .",
    "this allows to replace the commutator of the two currents with its singularity on the light cone times an operator bilocal in the b quark fields .",
    "furthermore , the light - cone dominance enables us to expand the matrix element of the bilocal operator between b - meson states in powers of @xmath37 .",
    "the leading nonperturbative effect is described by a distribution function @xcite : @xmath38 where @xmath39 denotes the four - momentum of the b meson .",
    "@xmath40 is the probability of finding a @xmath3-quark with momentum @xmath41 inside the b meson .",
    "the hadronic tensor can be expressed in terms of the distribution function : @xmath42 ( \\xi p_b - q)^\\alpha p_b^\\beta , \\ ] ] where @xmath43 is the charm quark mass .",
    "@xmath23 is calculated in this approach by integrating the differential decay rate in the b rest frame , @xmath44 with the differential decay rate @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the electron energy and we have neglected the electron mass .",
    "@xmath47 denotes the invariant mass of the final hadronic state .",
    "the dimensionless variables @xmath48 reads @xmath49 note that there appears in the differential decay rate ( [ eq : nonpert1 ] ) the b meson mass rather than the b quark mass .",
    "the integration limits are specified by hadron kinematics : @xmath50 which define the hadron level phase space shown in fig.1 . for comparison",
    ", we also write down here the kinematic boundaries for the free quark decay : @xmath51 which are also shown in fig.1 .",
    "it is an important feature of this approach that the calculation can be performed in the physical phase space as a large contribution of nonperturbative qcd arises from the extension of phase space from the quark level to the hadron level .",
    "it should be pointed out , however , that in theoretical calculations we take @xmath52 since we assume quark - hadron duality in our approach .",
    "important properties of the distribution function are derived from field theory . due to current conservation",
    ", it is exactly normalized to unity with a support @xmath53 .",
    "it obeys positivity . when the distribution function becomes the delta function , @xmath54 ,",
    "the free quark decay is reproduced .",
    "furthermore , the next two moments of the distribution function can be estimated in the hqet , as we shall discuss below .",
    "these two moments determine the mean value @xmath55 and the variance @xmath56 of the distribution function , which characterize the position of the maximum and the width of it , respectively : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the nth moment about a point @xmath59 of the distribution function defined by @xmath60 by definition , @xmath61 .",
    "the accuracy of the theory is remarkably improved by estimating the next two moments of the distribution function in the framework of the hqet .",
    "however , it can not yet be completely determined in qcd . for practical calculations",
    ", therefore , we shall use an ansatz for the distribution function , which respects all known properties , with two parameters @xmath62 and @xmath3 as follows @xmath63 where n is the normalization constant . for @xmath64 and @xmath65 ,",
    "eq.([eq : ansatz ] ) becomes a delta function , @xmath54 , and the free quark decay is reproduced .",
    "another form of the distribution function has been proposed in @xcite .",
    "the perturbative qcd corrections to @xmath66 has been calculated @xcite .",
    "it has the form @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the free quark decay width : @xmath69 with @xmath70 @xmath71 an analytic expression for @xmath72 is given in @xcite .",
    "the semileptonic decay width can be calculated by substituting ( [ eq : nonpert ] ) and ( [ eq : pert ] ) into ( [ eq : sum ] ) .",
    "the parameters involved and hence the sources of the theoretical error are : + ( 1 ) the parameters in the distribution function ( for the ansatz ( [ eq : ansatz ] ) that will be used , they are @xmath62 and @xmath3 ) , + ( 2 ) the beauty and charm quark pole masses @xmath17 and @xmath43 , + ( 3 ) the strong coupling constant @xmath73",
    ".    there are several theoretical constraints on these parameters stemming from the hqet , which reduce the theoretical uncertainties considerably .",
    "we discuss them in turn . + * i*. performing a light - cone ope and following the method of @xcite to expand the matrix elements of the local operators in the hqet , the next two moments and hence the mean value @xmath55 and the variance @xmath56 of the distribution function can be related @xcite to two accessible parameters @xmath74 and @xmath75 up to the order of @xmath76 , @xmath77 where @xmath78 . both @xmath74 and @xmath75",
    "are of order @xmath76 .",
    "this leads to a model - independent conclusion : the distribution function is sharply peaked around @xmath79 and its width is of order @xmath80 .    for numerical analyses we need to know @xmath74 and @xmath75 quantitatively",
    "the parameter @xmath75 is related @xcite to the observables , @xmath81 where the mass difference of the vector @xmath82 and the pseudoscalar @xmath0 mesons is measured to be @xmath83 gev .",
    "@xmath74 can be reexpressed in terms of another often used parameter @xmath84 instead , @xmath85 it is harder to determine @xmath84 ( or @xmath74 ) .",
    "the accurate value of it is not known .",
    "consequently , the mean value @xmath55 and the variance @xmath56 of the distribution function are determined by the two parameters @xmath17 and @xmath84 : @xmath55 depends on @xmath17 strongly and @xmath84 very weakly , while @xmath56 is sensitive essentially only to @xmath84 .",
    "hence , the parameters @xmath62 and @xmath3 in the ansatz ( [ eq : ansatz ] ) for the distribution function are also determined by @xmath17 and @xmath84 .",
    "+ * ii*. the quark mass difference is related to @xmath84 in the hqet @xcite @xmath86 where the spin - averaged meson masses @xmath87    finally , the remaining theoretical input parameters for our analysis are @xmath17 , @xmath84 , and @xmath73 .",
    "we evaluate @xmath23 and @xmath24 in the approach described above using the three input parameters . for @xmath17",
    "we use @xmath88 according to a qcd sum rule calculation @xcite , we take @xmath89 as a result , the mean value and the variance of the distribution function are : @xmath90 a truncating of perturbative series causes the dependence of perturbative calculations on the renormalization scale @xmath91 . for inclusive semileptonic b",
    "decays perturbative qcd corrections are known only to the leading order . the result given in ( [ eq : pert ] )",
    "exhibits an implicit scale dependence of the strong coupling @xmath73 .",
    "we vary the scale over the range of @xmath92 to estimate the theoretical error due to the choice of the scale used in the argument of @xmath73 .",
    "the dependence of the decay width @xmath93 on the parameters is shown in fig.2 .",
    "the variation of @xmath93 with @xmath17 or @xmath84 is stronger than @xmath91 .",
    "the variation of @xmath17 leads to an uncertainty of @xmath94 in the decay width if other parameters are kept fixed . the same uncertainty in the decay width results from the variation of @xmath84 .",
    "an uncertainty of @xmath95 in the decay width is introduced when the renormalization scale @xmath91 is varied between @xmath96 and @xmath17 .",
    "in addition , the impact of the shape of the distribution function on the value of the decay width is studied .",
    "the value of the decay width is more sensitive to the variation of the mean value than the variation of the variance of the distribution function .",
    "furthermore , we modify ( [ eq : ansatz ] ) with two more parameters @xmath97 and @xmath98 to be @xmath99^\\beta}\\theta(\\xi ) \\theta(1-\\xi ) \\ .\\ ] ] using ( 37 ) we find that the value of the decay width is insensitive to the change of the shape of the distribution function if the mean value and the variance of it are kept fixed .",
    "this insensitivity diminishes the model dependence .",
    "this analysis yields @xmath100 with a theoretical error of @xmath101 .    in fig.3",
    ", we compare the decay widths calculated in our approach , the free quark decay model , and the heavy quark expansion approach .",
    "the result in our approach shows that nonperturbative qcd contributions enhance the decay width by @xmath1 with respect to the free quark decay width , in contrast to the result of the heavy quark expansion approach where a reduction of the free quark decay width by @xmath102 is found .",
    "the change of the sign indicates that the nonperturbative effects receive a large phase - space enhancement .",
    "we also observe that the decay width calculated in our approach goes to a free quark decay limit as @xmath103 decreases .",
    "this behavior is expected since the distribution function approaches a delta function , which reproduces the free quark decay , as @xmath103 and hence @xmath56 decrease .",
    "thus this behavior provides a check of calculations .",
    "this theoretical analysis can be used to determine @xmath2 .",
    "experimentally the inclusive semileptonic branching ratio @xmath11 has been measured at the @xmath104 and @xmath105 resonances , respectively .",
    "the lifetime @xmath12 has been measured by experiments at @xmath105 and in @xmath106 collisions .",
    "the average of these measurements leads to @xcite @xmath107 putting it together with the theoretical value of @xmath15 given in ( [ eq : gammac ] ) , we obtain from ( [ eq : vcb ] ) @xmath108 where the first error is experimental and the second theoretical .",
    "we have calculated the semileptonic decay width of the b meson using an approach based on the light - cone expansion and the hqet .",
    "nonperturbative qcd effects are described by a single distribution function .",
    "several important properties of the distribution function are known from qcd and the hqet of it . however , one still has to model the distribution function .",
    "fortunately the result of the calculation of the decay width in this approach is nearly model - independent , since it is essentially only sensitive to the mean value and the variance of the distribution function , whose theoretical estimates exist .",
    "moreover , this approach is able to take into account both dynamic and kinematic components of nonperturbative qcd effects .",
    "we have shown that including the latter is indeed quantitatively crucial , which could increase the decay width significantly .",
    "we find an enhancement of the free quark decay width by @xmath1 due to nonperturbative qcd contributions , contrary to the claims from the heavy quark expansion approach . as a result",
    ", a value of @xmath2 is extracted from the inclusive semileptonic b meson decay with a controlled theoretical error .",
    "the main theoretical uncertainty arises from the values of the b quark mass and the hqet parameter @xmath84 .",
    "it seems possible to reduce theoretical uncertainties by a detailed fit to the measured charged - lepton energy spectrum to determine the parameters and a calculation of the next - to - leading order perturbative qcd correction .",
    "future measurements of the distribution function and more theoretical efforts on calculations of hadronic matrix elements should enable to further reduce the uncertainties .",
    "careful inclusion of the kinematic effect of nonperturbative strong interactions is also necessary for reliable predictions for the nonleptonic decay widths of hadrons containing a @xmath3 quark .",
    "the nonleptonic decay widths of @xmath3 hadrons may be calculated in a similar way .",
    "the decay widths are expressed in terms of the @xmath3 hadron masses rather than the @xmath3 quark mass provided the phase - space effects are included , whereas according to the heavy quark expansion , the relevant mass in the decay widths should be the universal @xmath3-quark mass and no corrections of order @xmath20 should be present @xcite .",
    "we would anticipate an enhancement of the nonleptonic decay width by nonperturbative qcd if both dynamic and kinematic effects of it are properly taken into account .",
    "since the phase - space effects cancel out to a large extent in the ratio of the decay widths , they are unlikely to significantly change the semileptonic branching ratio of the @xmath0 meson or the average number of charmed hadrons produced per b decay . on the other hand , the prediction on the ratio of the @xmath109 and @xmath0 lifetimes from the heavy quark expansion approach seems to be in conflict with the data @xcite . in this case",
    "phase - space effects are enlarged due to the significant difference between the @xmath109 and @xmath0 masses .",
    "the replacement of the @xmath3-quark mass with the non - universal @xmath3-hadron masses results in a perfect agreement @xcite between the theory and the experimental data , giving evidence for the phase - space effects .",
