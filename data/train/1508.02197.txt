    "<S> recently a new phase of the superfluid @xmath0he was reported to exist in the aerogel - like nafen structure  the so - called polar phase.@xcite as distinct from the other phases  the chiral superfluid @xmath0he - a with weyl nodes and the fully gapped topological @xmath0he - b with dirac nodes on the surface  </S>",
    "<S> the polar phase has dirac nodal line in bulk and dispersionless band of andreev - majorana fermions on the surface.@xcite being the spin - triplet superfluid with equal - spin pairing the polar phase can support an exotic object  the half - quantum vortex ( hqv ) . </S>",
    "<S> such vortices contain unpaired majoranas in their cores.@xcite originally the hqvs have been predicted to exist in the weyl superfluid @xmath0he - a,@xcite but still they have not been observed there : unfavorable combination of spin - orbit and magnetic anisotropy effects on the orientation of the order parameter did not allow to stabilize these vortices in bulk @xmath0he - a under rotation .    in nafen , </S>",
    "<S> the nearly parallel strands of al@xmath1o@xmath2 pin the orbital part of the order parameter of the polar phase . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> if the magnetic field is absent or is oriented parallel to nafen strands , the half - quantum vortices win over the conventional single - quantum vortices . </S>",
    "<S> if hqvs are formed in rotation and then the field is tilted with respect to the strands , the spin - orbit interaction induces the formation of the topological @xmath3-soliton between the neighboring hqvs providing the peculiar satellite peak in the nmr spectrum.@xcite we used these theoretical predictions to stabilize and identify the hqvs . for </S>",
    "<S> that we cool down a sample of nafen through @xmath4 to the polar phase in rotation up to 2.75rad / s without magnetic field . then the field is switched on , and in the tilted field we observe a satellite peak in the nmr spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> the dependence of the satellite on the rotation velocity , temperature and the field orientation is in agreement with our calculations of spin - wave resonances from bound pairs of pinned hqvs connected by solitons . </S>",
    "<S> experiments also demonstrate that the hqvs formed under rotation are strongly pinned by the nafen strands . </S>",
    "<S> if cool - down occurs with the field applied in the transverse direction , no satellite is observed , which demonstrates that in such arrangement the single - quantum vortices win over hqvs as expected . </S>"
