    "the experimental observation @xcite of bose - einstein ( be ) condensation in confined bose atom clouds have launched extensive experimental and theoretical studies of this phenomenon and the various properties of the condensates of free bosons@xcite and lattice bosons @xcite . in three dimensional non - interacting free @xcite or lattice bose systems @xcite in isotropic harmonic traps ,",
    "the be condensation is accompanied by a peak in the specific heat at the condensation temperature . however , not long after the initial discovery of bose condensation in harmonic traps , druten and ketterle ( dk ) @xcite found that bosons in highly anisotropic three dimensional ( 3d ) harmonic traps show a qualitatively different behavior of the specific heat .",
    "their theoretical calculations showed that the peak in the specific heat of this system is not at the bose condensation temperature , but in a higher temperature range in which the bosons , as the temperature decreases , are progressively transferred from the tightly confined dimensions to loosely confined dimension .",
    "thus , in this system , the bose condensation occurs in two steps : first the aforementioned transfer and second the condensation of all bosons in to the overall ground state .",
    "the calculations of dk are for free bosons in anisotropic 3d harmonic traps .",
    "the earlier @xcite and the later works @xcite are also for free bosons with anisotropic box and anisotropic 3d harmonic confinements , respectively .",
    "the two - step condensation is a phenomenon special in at least two aspects .",
    "the first aspect is that the condensation of the bosons into the overall ground state occurs without any signature in a thermodynamic property ( the specific heat ) .",
    "the second aspect is that it involves a dimensionality cross - over in a higher temperature range .",
    "both of these aspects are of fundamental importance , and hence an investigation of this phenomenon for _ lattice bosons _ should be of significant interest . now ,",
    "when an additional optical lattice potential is applied to bosons in a harmonic trap , it is known that significant changes occur in the single boson energy density of states@xcite ( dos ) .",
    "how these changes alter the two - step condensation phenomenon is an issue of fundamental importance and contemporary relevance .",
    "further , considering that there is a dimensionality cross - over involved , it should of interest to know under what conditions a _ lattice bosons _ system in an anisotropic harmonic trap is truly one - dimensional as far as thermodynamic properties are concerned .",
    "motivated by these considerations , in this paper we present a theoretical study of the condensation of lattice bosons in anisotropic harmonic traps . among other results ,",
    "we show that a two - step condensation occurs for lattice bosons at anisotropies much smaller than that required for free bosons .",
    "this finding may lead to an experimental study of this phenomenon in optical lattices .",
    "further , since it is by now relatively easy to experimentally change the boson hopping in different spatial directions in an optical lattice , we also study a case of lattice bosons with anisotropic hopping in an isotropic harmonic confining potential .",
    "one may argue that this is equivalent to bosons with isotropic hopping in an anisotropic trap and hence two - step condensation would occur in this case as well .",
    "our calculations show that two - step condensation does not occur in this case .",
    "our focus in this paper is the effects of the optical lattice potential on the two - step condensation , not the effect of boson - boson interactions .",
    "the strength of boson interactions is controllable in optical lattices@xcite , and hence one can experimentally reach the ideal gas limit to whcih our results are applicable .    this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we revisit the system of free bosons in an anisotropic harmonic trap .",
    "we complement the analysis of dk by new features we find in the single boson density of energy states ( dos ) . in sec .",
    "ii , we analyze two - step condensation of lattice bosons in anisotropic harmonic traps . in sec .",
    "iii , we study the bose condensation of lattice bosons with anisotropic hopping in an isotropic harmonic trap .",
    "the conclusions are given in sec .",
    "in this section we consider boson atoms in an anisotropic harmonic confining potential ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "the single boson energy levels are @xmath1 = @xmath2 , where @xmath3 = 0 , 1 , 2 ... @xmath4 , @xmath5 is the plank s constant , and @xmath6 in which @xmath7 is the atomic mass .",
    "we use @xmath8 so that the potentials , from the center of the trap , along the @xmath9 and @xmath10 directions are much steeper compared to that along the @xmath11 direction . in order to exhibit the two - step condensation in this system ,",
    "we calculate the ground state occupancy ( @xmath12 ) , the occupancy in the loosely confined direction ( @xmath13 ) , and the specific heat by determining first the chemical potential ( @xmath14 ) from the bosons number equation @xmath15 where @xmath16 - 1)$ ] , @xmath17 , @xmath18 the temperature , and then calculating @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) .",
    "the specific heat is obtained from the temperature derivative @xcite of the total energy ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "we evaluated @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath22 numerically to obtain exact results .",
    "the results of our calculations for 10000 bosons in harmonic traps of varying anisotropies are shown in fig .",
    "the condensation temperature @xcite ( @xmath23 ) , mentioned in this and other figures , is obtained by setting @xmath24 and @xmath25 in the bosons number equation . for low anisotropy , the peak in @xmath22",
    "is clearly associated with the growth of the bose condensate fraction ( @xmath26 ) . with increasing anisotropy ,",
    "the peak in @xmath22 becomes associated with the dimensionality cross - over in which bosons are transferred from the tightly confined directions ( @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) into the loosely confined direction(@xmath11 ) . to complement the analysis of dk , we calculated the single boson energy dos for these systems .",
    "first we recall that the analytical approximation to the dos of a boson in a d - dimensional anisotropic harmonic trap @xcite is @xmath27 from exact numerical calculations , we find that the dos for highly anisotropic traps , shown in fig . 2a , show features qualitatively different from the analytical approximation .",
    "the dos is found to have one dimensional ( 1d ) character ( flat regions ) . in the very low temperature range , only the lowest flat region",
    "is occupied by bosons so that the @xmath22 shows 1d character as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "this is consistent with the higher temperature cross - over in which the bosons are transferred from the tightly confined directions to the loosely confined direction .",
    "we also note that 1d features are absent in the dos when the anisotropy is comparatively smaller as shown in fig .",
    "in the next section , we consider consider two - step condensation of lattice bosons .      in this section",
    "we consider boson atoms in a three dimensional simple cubic ( _ sc _ ) lattice in an overall anisotropic harmonic confining potential .",
    "the system hamiltonian is @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the kinetic energy gain when a boson hop from site @xmath30 to its nearest neighbor site @xmath31 in the optical lattice , @xmath32 is a boson creation operator , @xmath33 is the potential at site @xmath30 , @xmath34 the boson number operator , and @xmath14 the chemical potential .",
    "we numerically diagonalize this hamiltonian to obtain the energy levels ( @xmath35 ) of a lattice boson for different values of the anisotropy of the harmonic trap with @xmath36 , where @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 is the lattice constant of the _ sc _ optical lattice .",
    "the chemical potential and the boson populations in different energy levels are calculated at a temperature @xmath18 , using the boson number equation : @xmath40 , where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the lowest and the highest single boson energy levels and @xmath43}-1]$ ] .",
    "the specific heat is calculated from the temperature derivative of total energy ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "the lattice size , we use , is large enough that the results are free of finite size effects .",
    "the results for the temperature dependence of the bose condensate fraction ( @xmath45 ) , fractional boson population in the @xmath11-direction ( @xmath46 ) , and the specific heat for lattice bosons in harmonic traps with different anisotropies are shown in fig .",
    "the two - step condensation is clearly seen in highly anisotropic traps ( dash - dot and dotted lines ) , while it is absent for small anisotropies . further , on comparing figs . 1 and 3",
    ", we can immediately infer that the the two - step condensation of lattice bosons is possible for much smaller anisotropies compared to the free bosons in anisotropic harmonic traps .",
    "we also find that most of the lattice bosons are confined in the @xmath11-direction at much higher temperatures compared to the case of free bosons even though the anisotropy is much smaller for the former compared to the latter .",
    "this is clear if we compare @xmath46 in both cases , as shown in figs . 1 and 3 , for @xmath47 . in order to get some insight into the two - step condensation occurring for smaller anisotropies for lattice bosons , we calculated the single boson energy dos for these systems .",
    "the results of our calculations are shown in fig .",
    "4 . with increasing anisotropy",
    "there is a dramatic change in the single particle dos ( fig .",
    "4 ) . except for very low energies ,",
    "the dos for low anisotropy is very similar to that for the isotropic case . with increasing anisotropy",
    ", the dos develops features similar to that expected in 1d .",
    "it has peaks separated by broad regions of comparatively very small values of dos . since the dos shows strong 1d features for small anisotropies compared to the free boson case ( without the lattice potential ) , the 1d behavior in @xmath46 sets in for comparatively smaller anisotropies of the harmonic traps .      in this section ,",
    "we investigate the dimensionality cross - over in some more detail .",
    "the specific heat , being a very sensitive function of dimensionality changes , is an useful property to study for this purpose .",
    "as mentioned earlier , for bosons in a highly anisotropic harmonic trap , the peak in the specific heat occurs in a temperature range in which the bosons are transferred from the tightly confined directions to the loosely confined direction ( here @xmath11-direction passing through the center of the trap ) . with lowering of temperature ,",
    "when the transfer to the single 1d chain along the @xmath11-direction is complete , the system would show 1d behavior . to visualize this cross - over , we have plotted the specific heats of lattice bosons in 3d anisotropic traps and in a 1d trap in fig .",
    "it is seen that at low temperatures the specific heats of the anisotropic systems completely coincide with that of the 1d chain showing that the anisotropic 3d systems have become purely 1d .",
    "the departure from the 1d behavior starts at a temperature which is higher for larger anisotropy ( fig .",
    "however , this temperature is much lower than the temperature where the specific heat shows the peak and is also lower than the condensation temperature ( @xmath23 ) for anisotropy as high as @xmath48 for lattice bosons ( see fig .",
    "it is also found that above this temperature ( i.e. , where the departure from the 1d behavior starts in @xmath22 ) , a very small change in @xmath13 produces a very large change in @xmath22 .",
    "this is also clear from fig.1 ( for free bosons ) and from figs . 3 and 5 ( for lattice bosons ) on comparing the temperature dependences of @xmath22 and @xmath13 in the above mentioned region .",
    "in this section , we investigate if the properties of lattice bosons with anisotropic hopping in an isotropic harmonic trap is similar to those with isotropic hopping in an anisotropic harmonic trap .",
    "we have studied the effects of anisotropic hopping on @xmath22 and condensate fraction in isotropic harmonic traps .",
    "the spatial direction dependent hopping we use are such that @xmath49 .",
    "the results of our calculations for various anisotropy ratios are shown in fig .",
    "we do not find a two - step behavior in this system .",
    "the specific heat is suppressed with increasing hopping anisotropy .",
    "the system shows anisotropic 3d behavior in all the properties studied even for large hopping anisotropies .",
    "the reason is that even though the hopping is anisotropic , since the trap is isotropic , one will have a large collection of 1d chains , symmetric about the central one , coupled by the small inter - chain hopping . at the bose condensation temperature ,",
    "the bosons condense in to the central region of the trap .",
    "there is no higher temperature cross - over region as in the case of lattice bosons with isotropic hopping in a highly anisotropic harmonic trap .",
    "in this paper we presented a theoretical study of two - step condensation of lattice bosons in anisotropic harmonic confining potentials .",
    "we find that , even though significant changes occur in the single bosons dos , two - step condensation occurs for lattice bosons and it occurs for much smaller anisotropies of the harmonic potential compared to that for free bosons .",
    "this may lead to experimental observation of these type of condensations .",
    "we find unusual 1d features in the one boson dos both for free and lattice bosons in highly anisotropic harmonic traps .",
    "these dos s are equally well applicable to fermions . using @xmath22 as the indicator",
    ", we also investigated the dimensionality cross - overs in the system .",
    "we find that the system shows purely 1d behavior in a much lower temperature range compared to the temperature range in which the peak in @xmath22 occurs .",
    "further , we investigated if two - step condensation occurs for lattice bosons with anisotropic hopping in an isotropic harmonic trap .",
    "we find that a two - step condensation does not occur in this system .",
