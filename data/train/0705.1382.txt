    "in the past twenty years a diverse range of new strongly correlated electron materials with exotic electronic and magnetic properties have been synthesized .",
    "examples include high - temperature cuprate superconductors,@xcite manganites with colossal magnetoresistance,@xcite cerium oxide catalysts,@xcite sodium cobaltates,@xcite ruthenates , heavy fermion materials,@xcite and superconducting organic charge transfer salts.@xcite many of these materials exhibit a subtle competition between diverse phases : paramagnetic , superconducting , insulating , and the different types of order associated with charge , spin , orbital , and lattice degrees of freedom .",
    "these different phases can be explored by varying experimental control parameters such as temperature , pressure , magnetic field , and chemical composition . although chemically and structurally diverse the properties of these materials are determined by some common features ; such as , strong interactions between the electrons , reduced dimensionality associated with a layered crystal structure , large quantum fluctuations , and competing interactions .",
    "many of these materials are characterized by large antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations .",
    "nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy has proven to be a powerful probe of local spin dynamics in many strongly correlated electron materials.@xcite the focus of this paper is on understanding what information about spin fluctuations can be extracted from nmr experiments on the organic charge transfer salts .    the systems which are the subject of the current study are the organic charge transfer salts based on electron donor molecules bedt - ttf ( et ) , in particular the family x ( where @xmath5 indicates a particular polymorph@xcite ) .",
    "similar physics occurs in the other dimerised polymorphs , such as the @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 phases.@xcite these materials display a wide variety of unconventional behaviours@xcite including : antiferromagnetic and spin liquid insulating states , unconventional superconductivity , and the metallic phase which we focus on in this paper .",
    "they also share highly anisotropic crystal and band structures .",
    "however , for various sociological and historical reasons , the @xmath5 salts have been far more extensively studied , and because we intend , in this paper , to make detailed comparisons with experimental data , we limit our study to @xmath5 phase salts .",
    "this begs the question : do similar phenomena to those described below occur in the @xmath9 , @xmath10 , or @xmath11 salts ?",
    "we would suggest that the answer is probably _",
    "yes _ but this remains an inviting experimental question .",
    "the metallic phase of  is very different from a conventional metallic phase .",
    "many features of the metallic phase agree well with the predictions of dynamical mean field theory ( dmft)@xcite which describes the crossover from a ` bad metal ' at high temperatures to a fermi liquid as the temperature is lowered.@xcite this crossover from incoherent to coherent intralayer transport has been observed in a number of experiments such as resistivity,@xcite thermopower,@xcite and ultrasonic attenuation.@xcite the existence of coherent quasiparticles is also apparent from the observed magnetic quantum oscillations at low temperatures in .@xcite however , nuclear magnetic resonance experiments ( see figs .

    "fig : t1t_fit2 ] and [ fig : korringa ] ) on the metallic phase on  are not consistent with a fermi liquid description .",
    "the nuclear spin relaxation rate per unit temperature , @xmath12 , is larger than the korringa form predicted from fermi liquid theory .",
    "as the temperature is lowered @xmath12 reaches a maximum ; we label this temperature @xmath4 ( the exact value of @xmath4 varies with the anion @xmath13 , but typically ,  @xmath14 k , see fig . [ fig : t1t_fit2 ] ) .",
    "@xmath12 decreases rapidly as the temperature is lowered below @xmath4 [ see fig [ fig : t1t_fit2]].@xcite the knight shift also drops rapidly around @xmath4.@xcite this is clearly in contrast to the korringa - like behavior one would expect for a fermi liquid in which @xmath12 and @xmath1 are constant for @xmath15 , the fermi temperature .",
    "a similar non - fermi liquid temperature dependence of @xmath12 and @xmath1 is observed in the cuprates.@xcite it has been argued that the large enhancement of the measured @xmath12 in cuprates is associated with the growth of antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation within the cuo@xmath6 planes as the temperature is lowered.@xcite the large decrease observed in @xmath12 and @xmath1 measurements for underdoped cuprates@xcite at temperatures well above @xmath16 is suggestive of a depletion of the density of states ( dos ) at the fermi level which might be expected if a pseudogap opens at @xmath4 .",
    "a quantitative description of spin fluctuations in the metallic phase of  has not been given previously . however , the importance of spin fluctuations for the superconducting  has been pointed out by several groups.@xcite since superconductivity arises from an instability of the metallic phase , it is important to understand the strength of the spin fluctuations in the metallic phase .",
    "we use the phenomenological antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation model which was first introduced by moriya in his self consistent renormalization ( scr ) theory@xcite and then applied by millis , monien and pines ( mmp)@xcite to cuprates , to examine the role of spin fluctuations in the metallic phase of .",
    "we fit the spin fluctuation model to the nuclear spin relaxation rate per unit temperature @xmath12 , knight shift @xmath1 , and korringa ratio @xmath17 data .",
    "we find that the large enhancements measured in @xmath12 and @xmath17 above @xmath4 are the result of large antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations [ see figs . [",
    "fig : t1t_fit2 ] and [ fig : korringa ] ] .",
    "the antiferromagnetic correlation length increases as temperature decreases and the relevant correlation length is found to be @xmath18 lattice spacings at @xmath19 k. the model produces a reasonable agreement with experimental data down to @xmath20 k. the spin fluctuation model predicts a monotonically increasing @xmath12 with decreasing temperature while the measured @xmath12 below 50 k is suppressed but never saturates to a constant value .",
    "this is contrary to what is expected for a fermi liquid where @xmath12 is constant .",
    "this indicates that the metallic phase of  is richer than a renormalized fermi liquid as has been previously thought to describe the low temperature metallic state .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii we introduce the temperature dependence of the nuclear spin relaxation rate , knight shift , and korringa ratio and describe how they probe the dynamic susceptibility .",
    "we calculate these properties in a number of approximations and contrast the results . in section iii",
    "we demonstrate that the spin fluctuation model provides reasonable fits to the existing experimental results for  above @xmath4 and discuss its limitations when applied to those materials . in section",

    "therefore , if the system under discussion is not a fermi liquid then the validity of this expression for @xmath44 can not be guaranteed .",
    "for example , the marginal fermi liquid theory predicts a different frequency dependence.@xcite if the dynamic susceptibility has a large peak at @xmath45 then @xmath0 will not be strongly dependent on the long wavelength physics [ because @xmath0 measures the susceptibility over the entire brillouin zone , c.f . , eq .",

    "the correlation length is only of order a lattice constant at @xmath131.@xcite thus the correlation length , @xmath132 at @xmath126 k , obtained from the analysis of the data for  is reasonable and places the materials between the square lattice and isotropic triangular lattice antiferromagnetic heisenberg model as has been argued on the basis of electronic structure calculations.@xcite    one of the best ways to measure antiferromagnetic correlation length is by inelastic neutron scattering experiments . to perform this experiment",
    ", one needs high quality single crystals .",
    "unfortunately , it is difficult to grow sufficiently large single crystals for ; however , recently some significant progress has been made in this direction.@xcite another way to probe the correlation length is through the spin echo experiment .",
    "the spin echo decay rate @xmath133 is proportional to the temperature dependence correlation length . to the authors knowledge there is no spin echo decay rate measurement on the metallic phase of the layered organic materials at the present time",
    "thus , it is very desirable to have such experimental data to compare with the value of @xmath42 we have extracted above .      as we pointed out in section ii",
    "the knight shift @xmath1 will generally have a weak temperature dependence throughout the whole temperature range and so , thus far , we have neglected its temperature dependence .",
    "however , it is apparent from eq .",
    "( [ nmr_af2 ] ) that for any choice of parameter values @xmath134 , and @xmath135 , @xmath1 will always increase monotically as the temperature decreases .",
    "therefore the temperature dependence of the knight shift potentially provides an important check on the validity of the spin fluctuation model .",
    "however , in the following discussion one should recall the caveats ( discussed in section [ sect : sf ] ) on the validity of the calculation of the knight shift stemming from the assumption that the dynamics of the long wavelength part of dynamical susceptibility relax in the same manner as a fermi liquid does .",
    "in contrast to the prediction of the spin fluctuation model , the experimental data @xcite for  show that @xmath1 decreases slowly with decreasing temperature which then undergoes a large suppression around @xmath136 k. it should be emphasized here that @xmath137 is approximately the same as @xmath4 , the temperature at which @xmath12 is maximum .    since it is not possible to explain any of the nmr data below @xmath4 in terms of the spin fluctuation model within the approximations discussed thus far , we focus on the temperature range between 50 k to 300 k just as we did for the analysis of @xmath12 .",
    "even in this temperature range , there is a puzzling discrepancy between theory and experiment : the experimental data decrease slowly with decreasing temperature while the theoretical calculation predicts the opposite .",
    "we will argue below that this discrepancy arises because the data are obtained at constant pressure while the theoretical prediction assumes constant volume .",
    "since the organic charge transfer salts are particularly soft , thermal expansion of the unit cell may produce a sizeable effect to the knight shift and may not be neglected . in principle , an estimate of the size of this effect could be made following wzietek _",
    "et al._,@xcite as @xmath138 where @xmath139 is the ( experimentally obtained ) isobaric knight shift , @xmath140 is the ( calculated ) constant volume knight shift , @xmath141 is the isothermal compressibility , and @xmath142 is the linear thermal expansion .",
    "however , it is not possible to obtain an accurate estimate for @xmath143 at this time because there are no complete data sets for @xmath139 , isothermal compressibility , and thermal expansion as a function of temperature and pressure for the -x family .",
    "however , a rough estimate for @xmath143 may be made using the available experimental data.@xcite this suggests that the experimental data is consistent with the spin fluctuation theory .",
    "clearly , further experiments are required to test this claim conclusively .",
    "therefore we raise this issue predominately to stress the importance of systematic measurements of the parameters in eq .",
    "( [ correction ] ) .    given the large uncertainty in @xmath143 we take @xmath1 to be constant for temperatures above 50  k in the rest of this paper .",
    "this is clearly the simplest assumption , it is not ( yet ) contradicted by experimental data , and , perhaps most important , any temperature dependence in the knight shift is significantly smaller than the temperature dependence of @xmath12 .",
    "regardless of the size of @xmath143 , the knight shift calculated from the spin fluctuation model is inconsistent with the experimental data below @xmath136 k ( see fig . 4 in ref . ) .",
    "the calculated @xmath1 shows a weakly increasing @xmath1 with decreasing temperature , while the measured @xmath1 is heavily suppressed below 50 k. one important point to emphasize here is that the temperature dependence of @xmath1 will not change even if one uses the fully @xmath144-dependent @xmath23 since @xmath1 only probes the @xmath29 component of the hyperfine coupling and susceptibility [ see eq .",
    "( [ ks ] ) ] .",
    "thus , putting an appropriate q - dependent hyperfine coupling will not change the result for @xmath1 ( although it might give a better description for @xmath12 ) .",
    "this provides a compelling clue that some non - trivial mechanism is responsible to the suppression of @xmath12 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 below 50 k.    we have not addressed how the nuclear spin relaxation rate is modified by the thermal expansion of the lattice . since the organic compound is soft , it is interesting to ask if there is a sizeable effect to @xmath12 .",
    "et al._@xcite have performed this analysis on quasi-1d organic compounds whose relaxation rate in found to scale like @xmath145 .",
    "one can straightforwardly derive the effect of volume changes from the hubbard model .",
    "if one uses the relation @xmath146 and assumes fixed @xmath147 and @xmath148 , then @xmath149 will follow .",
    "however , it is clear from the phase diagram of the organic charge transfer salts [ see ref . ]",
    "that there is a rather large change in @xmath147 and @xmath148 for even small pressure variations .",
    "therefore , there is no obvious relationship between @xmath12 and @xmath150 for the quasi-2d organics and it is not clear how the imaginary part of the susceptibility @xmath151 , which enters @xmath12 , is effected by thermal expansion and lattice isothermal compressibility . again , this stresses the importance of the detailed experiments needed to determine the effect of thermal expansion of the lattice on the measured relaxation rate .",
    "_ open problems .",
    "_ the large suppression of @xmath12 and @xmath1 below @xmath4 observed in all the @xmath5 salts studied here can not be explained by the m - mmp spin fluctuation model .",
    "one plausible mechanism to account for this feature is the appearance of a pseudogap which causes the suppression of the density of states at the fermi energy .",
    "this is because at low temperature @xmath12 and @xmath1 are proportional to @xmath152 and @xmath153 , where @xmath154 ) is the full interacting density of states at the fermi energy.@xcite independent evidence for the suppression of density of states at the fermi level comes from the linear coefficient of the specific heat @xmath155.@xcite the electronic specific heat probes the density of excitations within @xmath156 of the fermi energy .",
    "any gap will suppress the density of states near the fermi surface which results in the depression of the specific heat coefficient @xmath155 .",
    "kanoda@xcite compared @xmath155 for several  salts and found that in the region close to the mott transition , @xmath155 is indeed reduced .",
    "one possible interpretation of this behavior is a pseudogap which becomes bigger as one approaches the mott transition .",
    "however , other interpretations are also possible .",
    "in particular one needs to take care to account for the possible coexistence of metallic and insulating phases ; this is expected as the mott transition is first order in the organic charge transfer salts.@xcite the existence of a pseudogap has also been suggested in @xmath11-(bedt - tsf)@xmath6gacl@xmath53@xcite from microwave conductivity measurements .",
    "the reduction of the real part of the conductivity @xmath157 from the drude conductivity @xmath158 and the steep upturn in the imaginary part of the conductivity @xmath159 may be interpreted in terms of preformed pairs leading to a pseudogap in this material .",
    "a pseudogap is predicted by the rvb theory of organic superconductivity.@xcite    the experimental evidence from measurements of @xmath12 , @xmath1 , and heat capacity all seem to point to the existence of a pseudogap below @xmath4 in  and . thus a phenomenological description which takes into account both the spin fluctuations which are important above @xmath4 and a pseudogap which dominates the physics below @xmath4 would seem to be a reasonable starting point to explain the nmr data for the entire temperature range ( clearly superconductivity must also be included for @xmath160 ) .",
    "we will pursue this approach in our future work .",
    "in particular , if there is a pseudogap then important questions to answer include : ( i ) how big is the pseudogap and what symmetry does it have ? ( ii )",
    "how similar is the pseudogap in  to the pseudogaps in the cuprates and in other strongly correlated materials such as manganites and heavy fermions ?",
    "( iii ) is there any relationship between the pseudogap and the superconducting gap in ?",
    "the answer to these questions may help put constraints on the microscopic theories .",
    "_ future experiments .",
    "_ there are a number of key experiments required to resolve the issue whether or not a pseudogap is present in the low temperature metallic phase of .",
    "the pressure and magnetic field dependence of the nuclear spin relaxation rate and knight shift will be valuable in determining the pseudogap phase boundary , estimating the order of magnitude of the pseudogap , and addressing the issue how the pseudogap is related to superconductivity . in the cuprates ,",
    "there have been several investigations of the magnetic field dependence of the pseudogap seen in nmr experiments . for bi@xmath6sr@xmath161la@xmath162cuo@xmath163",
    "the nuclear spin relaxation rate does not change with field up to 43 t.@xcite however , since @xmath164 k , one may require a larger field to reduce the pseudogap .",
    "similar results were found in yba@xmath6cu@xmath53o@xmath165.@xcite however , in yba@xmath6cu@xmath8o@xmath166 [ see especially fig . 6 of ref . ]",
    "a field of order 10 t is enough to start to close the pseudogap .",
    "the interlayer magnetoresistance of the cuprates has proven to be a sensitive probe of the pseudogap .",
    "@xcite moreover , it is found that for the field parallel to the layers ( which means that zeeman effects will dominate orbital magnetoresistance effects ) the pseudogap is closed at a field given by @xmath167 where @xmath168 is the pseudogap temperature . for the hole doped cuprates this field is of the order 100 t. in contrast , for the electron - doped cuprates this field is of the order 30 t ( and @xmath169 k ) , and so this is much more experimentally accessible.@xcite the field and temperature dependence of the interlayer resistance for several superconducting organic charge transfer salts@xcite is qualitatively similar to that for the cuprates .",
    "in particular , for temperatures less than the zero - field transition temperature and fields larger than the upper critical field , negative magnetoresistance is observed for fields perpendicular to the layers .",
    "a possible explanation is that , as in the cuprates , there is a suppression of the density of states near the fermi energy , and the associated pseudogap decreases with increasing magnetic field .",
    "a nernst experiment can be used to probe whether there are superconducting fluctuations in the pseudogap phase , as has been done in the cuprates.@xcite this experiment is particularly important in understanding the relation between the pseudogap and superconductivity .",
    "one could also study the pressure dependence of the linear coefficient of heat capacity @xmath155 .",
    "since @xmath155 is proportional to the density of states at the fermi energy , a detailed mapping of @xmath170 would be an important probe for studying the pseudogap .",
    "finally , measurements of the hall effect have also led to important insights into the pseudogap of the cuprates@xcite and so perhaps the time is ripe to revisit these experiments in the organic charge transfer salts .",
    "we have applied a spin fluctuation model to study the temperature dependences of the nuclear spin relaxation rate , knight shift , and korringa ratio in the metallic phase of several quasi two - dimensional organic charge transfer salts .",
    "this model was based on moriya s self consistent renormalization theory@xcite which was then applied by millis , monien , and pines@xcite to cuprates .",
    "the large enhancement of @xmath12 between @xmath4 \\{@xmath171  k in } and room temperature has been shown to be the result of strong antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations .    the antiferromagnetic correlation length is estimated to be @xmath18 lattice spacings in  at @xmath126 k. this value falls between those for the heisenberg model on the isotropic triangular lattice and the square lattice .    the spin fluctuations in , , 8br , and  are found to be similar both qualitatively and quantitatively .",
    "strong spin fluctuations seem to be manifested in materials close to mott transition .",
    "recent nmr experiments@xcite on ag(cn)@xmath172h@xmath6o , which is situated further away from the mott transition , suggests that the spin fluctuations in this materials are not as strong as those in the other @xmath5 salts studied here .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath12 for @xmath173 from the spin fluctuation model is qualitatively similar with the predictions of dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) .",
    "below @xmath4 , the spin fluctuation model predicts a monotically increasing @xmath12 with decreasing temperature while dmft produces a constant @xmath12 .",
    "neither of these models can account for the large suppression of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 below @xmath14 k observed in all the @xmath5-salts studied here .",
    "this suggests two things .",
    "first , the low temperature regime is more complicated than the renormalized fermi liquid previously thought to be the correct description of the low temperature metallic phase in these materials .",
