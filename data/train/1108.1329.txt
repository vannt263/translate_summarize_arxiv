    "over the past decade , the experimental realization of a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) of @xmath1cr atoms @xcite with a strong dipole - dipole interaction has given new impetus to theoretical investigations of becs with long - range interaction at low temperatures .",
    "due to the large magnetic dipole moment of cr atoms @xcite , @xmath2 ( where @xmath3 is the bohr magneton ) , the anisotropic interaction between polarized magnetic dipoles results in anisotropic deformations during expansion of the condensate .",
    "dipolar quantum gases are governed by the @xmath4-wave symmetry of the long - range dipole - dipole interaction , which causes novel properties such as unusual stability properties @xcite , exotic ground states @xcite , and modified excitation spectra @xcite . for a review of dipolar condensates , see @xcite .",
    "the miscibility and separation of a two - component bec have been studied theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite previously .",
    "recently , more detailed and controlled experimental results have been obtained , illustrating the effects of phase separation in a multi - component bec @xcite . in all these papers ,",
    "the studies of the binary condensates were limited to the case of @xmath5-wave interactions ; while a great deal of attention has been drawn recently to dipolar becs .",
    "hexagonal , labyrinthine , solitonlike structures , and hysteretic behavior have been studied in a two - component dipolar bec @xcite , as well as immiscibility - miscibility transitions @xcite .    the theoretical description of a bec in the dilute limit in the framework of the extended gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) , which has been part of many text books on quantum mechanics or bose - einstein condensates @xcite , is well known .",

    "a measurement of the strength of the dipole - dipole interaction relative to the @xmath5-wave scattering energy is provided by a dimensionless quantity ( the so - called dimensionless dipole - dipole strength parameter ) @xmath28 . for dipoles aligned along @xmath29 , this dipolar mean - field potential ( [ eq : phidd ] )",

    "this formulation of the problem allows us to immediately identify some generic features of dipolar gases .",
    "for example , if @xmath32 and hence @xmath33 is uniform along the polarization direction @xmath29 , then the nonlocal part of the dipolar interaction vanishes because of the operator @xmath35 .",
    "the details are in sec.[sec : twodregime ] .    the two - component dipolar bec , confined in a cylindrical trap ,",
    "is described by two coupled gross - pitaevskii equations .",
    "we take cr as component 1 and rb as component 2 , then the gp equations can be written as @xmath36 where @xmath37 @xmath38 represents a cylindrical harmonic trap with radial trap frequency @xmath39 and axial trap frequency @xmath40 for the @xmath41th component , and @xmath42 .",

    "sec : twodregime ] , the quasi - two - dimensional gross - pitaevskii equations representing the two - component dipolar bec are derived , and analytical results for the phase separation in the radial direction are given .",
    "finally , the paper is concluded in sec.[sec : conclusion ] .",
    "we begin by neglecting the radial trapping frequency ( @xmath52 ) and increase the axial trapping frequency ( @xmath40 ) to the extent that a highly flattened pancake - shaped bec is produced with infinite radial extent . in this case",

    "as two dimensionless coupled differential equations : @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 .    using the finite - difference approximation @xcite @xmath61 we can write @xmath62 as a symmetric tridiagonal matrix with diagonal elements @xmath63 and subdiagonal or superdiagonal elements @xmath64 in @xmath65 , where @xmath66 with mesh length @xmath67 in the @xmath0 direction . here , free boundary conditions should be applied as @xmath68 .",

    "[ fig : fig6 ] ) .",
    "the phase - separated states for the same @xmath78 are totally different between the quasi - one- and quasi - two - dimensional regimes .",
    "the interactions are known to be the predominant factors which can affect the ground - state density profile of a bec , so different properties of the dipolar interaction can make a difference to the phase separations between the two regimes .",
    "for the same value of @xmath78 , the repulsion or attraction of the net dipolar interaction is opposite in the two regimes , so the effective interatomic interaction of cr is totally different between the two regimes ( compare @xmath89 of table [ table : table2 ] with @xmath79 of table [ table : table1 ] ) .",
    "if @xmath78 is negative , the repulsion of the effective interatomic interaction in the quasi - two - dimensional regime is much stronger than in the quasi - one - dimensional regime ( see tables [ table : table1 ] and [ table : table2 ] ) , so the rubidium atoms are held at the center of the trap while the chromium atoms are forced to form a shell around the center at the critical point of phase separation .",
    "the situation for a relatively large positive @xmath78 is the opposite .",
    "in addition to the strength of the interactions , the density profiles also depend on the particle numbers @xmath102 and @xmath103 @xcite .",
    "thus we do some calculations where we hold constant the number of one component s atoms and change the other in the quasi - two - dimensional regime .",
    "clearly , the number of atoms plays a key role in the phase separation of a two - component bec . in the case of @xmath88 , cr forms a shell around rb .",
    "when the number of cr atoms is fixed , they are squeezed further out as the number of rb atoms increases ( see fig .",

    "if we fix the number of rb atoms instead , one can see that the rubidium atoms are compressed further as the number of cr increases ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig8 ] ) .",
    "finally , we would like to mention that the situation of the quasi - one - dimensional regime is similar to this case herein .",
    "in the present work , we have analyzed the phase separation of a two - component dipolar bec in the quasi - one- and quasi - two - dimensional regimes , as a natural parameter of the system ( the intercomponent interaction strength ) was varied .",
    "our analysis was presented for the case of a two - component bose - einstein condensate trapped in a harmonic - oscillator potential .",
    "we reduced the long - range dipole - dipole interaction to a contactlike form , when a dipole moment is aligned along the @xmath0 direction , and then used a numerical method to solve two coupled nonlinear gross - pitaevskii equations in the low - dimensional regime .",
    "we were able to elucidate the phase separation condition for the intercomponent coupling parameter as the dimensionless dipolar interaction strength parameter @xmath78 was varied .",
    "both repulsive and attractive dipolar interactions have been taken into consideration .",
    "among all the phase - separated states , @xmath78 plays a significant role . by modulation of its strength",
    ", the two components might alternately stay in or be forced to be outside the center of the trap .",
    "in addition to the interactions , we considered the dependence of the density profiles on the number of atoms as well .",
    "we also described the differences between the quasi - one- and quasi - two - dimensional regimes in detail . due to the anisotropic property of the dipole - dipole interaction ,",
    "phase separation in the axial direction differs from that in the radial direction .",
    "a natural extension of this work is to try to generalize the ideas presented herein to higher dimensions or larger number of components ( i.e. , spinors ) . especially in the former case , more complicated pattern formations on the interface , such as rosensweig hexagonal peaks and a labyrinthine pattern , have been observed @xcite .",
