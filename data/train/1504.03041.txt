    "the first formalism to quantum mechanics in phase space was proposed by wigner in 1932 @xcite .",
    "he was motived by the problem of finding a way to improve the quantum statistical mechanics , based on the desity matrix , to treat the transport equations for superfluids @xcite . since then",
    ", the formalism proposed by wigner has been applied in different contexts , such as quantum optics @xcite , condensed matter @xcite , quantum computing @xcite , quantum tomography @xcite , plasma physics@xcite .",
    "wigner introduced his formalism by using a kind of fourier transform of the density matrix , @xmath0 , giving rise to what in nowadays called the wigner function , @xmath1 , where @xmath2 are coordinates of a phase space manifold @xmath3 .",
    "the wigner function is identified as a quasi - probability density in the sense that @xmath1 is real but not positive defined , and as such can not be interpreted as a probability",
    ". however , the integrals @xmath4 and @xmath5 are distribution functions @xcite .    in wigner formalism each quantum operator @xmath6 in the hilbert space",
    "is associated with a function @xmath7 defined in @xmath8 .",
    "the application @xmath9 is such that associative algebra of operators in @xmath10 defines an associative but noncommutative algebra in @xmath8 .",
    "the noncommutativity stems from nature of the product between two operators in @xmath10 .",
    "given two operators @xmath11 and @xmath12 , we have the mapping @xmath13 , where the star ( or moyal)-product @xmath14 is defined by moy2 @xmath15b_{w}(q , p ) .",

    ", we can study unitary representations of lie groups in phase space using the moyal product as defined by the operators @xmath20 .",
    "this gives rise , for instance , to the klein - gordon and dirac equations written in phase space @xcite .",
    "the connection with wigner function is derived , providing a physical interpretation for the representation . as a consequence ,",
    "these symplectic representations are a a way to consider the wigner methods on the bases of symmetry groups . in the present work",
    ", we apply this symplectic formalism to solve dirac equation with electromagnetic interaction in phase space .",
    "these results provide a starting point for our analysis of nonclassical electromagnetic radiation sates in phase space .",

    "the space @xmath41 endowed with this symplectic structure is called the phase space , and will be denoted by @xmath22 .    the notion of hilbert space associated with the phase space @xmath8 is introduced by considering the set of square integrable functions , @xmath42 in @xmath8 , such that @xmath43then , we can write @xmath44 , with @xmath45to be @xmath46 the dual vector of @xmath47 .",

    "one central point to be emphasized is that the approach developed here permits the calculation of wigner functions for relativistic systems with methods , based on symmetry , similar to those used in quantum field theory .",
