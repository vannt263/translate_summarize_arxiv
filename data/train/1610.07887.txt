    "it also shows exponential damping in @xmath80 ; so we simplify @xmath75 by neglecting other terms involving @xmath80 .",
    "the terms in @xmath81 produce divergences in @xmath49 , when integrated over @xmath76 and/or @xmath82 . by partial integration with respect to @xmath82 , we can separate these terms into purely divergent and finite pieces .",
    "the divergent pieces are removed by the field and coupling constant renormalization  @xcite .",
    "the finite ones produce observable effects in the real and imaginary parts .",
    "however , the real part depends on the choice of renormalization prescription .",
