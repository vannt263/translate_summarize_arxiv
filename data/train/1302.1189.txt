    "the nature and the microscopic origin of fermionic pairing was first elucidated in the pioneering work by bardeen , cooper , and schrieffer , widely known as the bcs theory @xcite .",
    "the attractive pairwise interaction between electrons with opposite spin , albeit extremely weak , can give rise to an instability in normal electron gas towards the formation of zero - momentum cooper pairs near fermi surface , and because of pair condensation , ordering of conduction electrons emerge naturally .",
    "when subjected to an external zeeman field , the population balance between electrons with different spins may be broken . as a consequence ,",
    "not all electrons can find a partner to pair up with . if spin - population imbalance is large enough , the pairing of fermions has to occur at finite center - of - mass momentum with deformed fermi surface state @xcite .",
    "this exotic possibility of inhomogeneous superfluid was first predicted by fulde and ferrell ( ff ) @xcite , and by larkin and ovchinnikov ( lo ) @xcite a little later .",
    "ff refers to an order parameter with plane - wave form @xmath0 , which spontaneously breaks time - reversal symmetry ; while lo considers the superfluid with a standing - wave order parameter @xmath1 , which explicitly breaks translational symmetry .",
    "both phases have puzzled the solid - state community for decades in terms of unambiguous experimental evidence to prove their existence . moreover ,",
    "the fflo state is also of interest in quantum chromodynamics at low temperature and high density , where the property of asymptotic freedom may favor color superconductivity @xcite .    in recent years , due to their exquisite controllability , ultracold atoms have emerged as an ideal platform to simulate many - body hamiltonians .",
    "adjustable interaction and high degrees of control over spin - populations have enabled one with the feasibility of exploring the long sought fflo phase .",
    "tremendous theoretical and experimental efforts have been put into optimizing the best detectable parameter regime of this phase .",
    "the most promising route is now believed to probe the one - dimensional ( 1d ) spin - imbalanced fermi gas @xcite , where indirect evidence of fflo phase has been found in a recent experiment @xcite . however , for 3d fermi gas , the fflo phase is not favored @xcite .    over the past few years",
    ", another milestone achievement in cold atom research is the realization of artificial spin - orbit ( so ) coupling , first in bosonic systems @xcite and later in fermioinic ones @xcite . by tailoring the laser fields that generate the so coupling , various coupling schemes can be realized in principle .",
    "it has been realized very recently that , in a fermi gas , the interplay between the so coupling and an effective zeeman field may lead to distortion of single - particle dispersion as well as the fermi surface , in such a way that finite - momentum dimer state and/or cooper pairs will be favored @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we provide a unified treatment of both two - body and the many - body physics for a fermi gas subjected to an isotropic three - dimensional so coupling ( 3dsoc ) and an effective zeeman field .",
    "the generation of such 3dsoc has been recently proposed by optically dressing four internal atomic states with a tetrahedral geometry @xcite .",
    "this version of the so coupling is less explored and unfamiliar to the condensed matter community , where 2d rashba and dresselhaus so couplings are studied extensively .",
    "one important advantage of 3dsoc over lower - dimensional so interaction is that it provides the greatest enhancement of fermionic pairing @xcite .",
    "furthermore , due to its isotropic nature , mathematical simplicity is ensured .",
    "the main findings of our work are : i ) under arbitrarily weak zeeman field , zero - momentum dimer state and conventional bcs superfluid phase are no longer stable .",
    "ii ) for many - body system , ff state is inherently robust , and ultimately connects to normal phase in a smooth manner as zeeman field strength is increased , cf .",
    "moreover , this type of exotic superfluid has a different origin in comparison with the previously studied fflo state . in the absence of the so coupling ,",
    "individual particle number with different spins is conserved , hence the imbalance induced finite - momentum pairing has parity symmetry between @xmath2 and @xmath3 , which should be called lo phase by definition ; on the other hand , in the presence of the so coupling , zeeman field breaks time - reversal symmetry explicitly and cause the single - particle dispersion to be asymmetric , which underlines the idea of finite - momentum dimer bound state @xcite and the ff pairing instability .",
    "the center - of - mass momentum of the cooper pair can be as large as the fermi momentum .",
    "this result should be very encouraging for future experimental exploration .",
