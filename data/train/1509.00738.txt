    "there is now a general consensus that active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are powered by accretion of matter on to a super - massive ( @xmath010@xmath1 m@xmath2 ) black hole ( smbh ) .",
    "according to the unified model of agn @xcite , an obscuring optically thick medium composed by dust and gas arranged in a torus - like geometry is present around the nuclear engine .",
    "however , the structure , size and composition of this circumnuclear medium are still matter of debate and are topics of several studies carried out at different wavelengths @xcite .",
    "important constraints on the physical properties of the circumnuclear medium have been recently provided by the study of the absorption variability , which is almost ubiquitous in bright absorbed agn @xcite .",
    "x - ray absorbing column density ( @xmath3 ) has been observed to vary by a factor of 10 or more over a few years . the observed @xmath3 variability on this scale ruled out the simplest physical configuration of a homogeneous absorber , giving upper limits on the distance of the latter by the central smbh .",
    "subsequent x - ray observational campaigns detected significant variability on a handful of agn on very short time - scale ( day or week ) giving the possibility to investigate the x - ray properties of the circumnuclear medium down to sub - parsec scale .",
    "the emerging picture is that multiple neutral and ionized absorbers co - exist around the central smbh , located at different distances from it .",
    "so far the best characterization of the physical parameters of the x - ray absorbers has been possible for the agn in ngc 1365 , which has been monitored several times in the last few years with _",
    "chandra _ , _ xmm - newton _ and _ suzaku_. this source changes from compton - thick ( @xmath3@xmath410@xmath5 @xmath6 ) to compton - thin ( @xmath3@xmath710@xmath8 @xmath6 ) state on time - scales from weeks @xcite to hours or days @xcite .",
    "one of the main results is that the x - ray absorber has the physical properties typical of the clouds responsible for the emission of the broad lines in the optical / uv spectrum , i.e. the broad - line emission region ( blr ) , located at a distance of hundreds of gravitational radii from the central smbh .",
    "recently it has been proposed that the long - term variability of the x - ray absorber in ngc  1365 could be due to the variation of the ionized x - ray wind , that is responding to the changes in the accretion rate @xcite .",
    "high spectral resolution data show that this wind is located within the variable soft x - ray absorber and is composed by two ( or even three ) zones with different ionization levels",
    ". in particular , the lowest ionization zone of this wind could be responsible for the absorption variability that is observed in this source below 2 kev @xcite .    by exploiting the _ swift _ x - ray telescope ( hereafter xrt ; @xcite ) archive",
    ", we recently started a project aimed at studying , on a larger statistical basis , the physical properties of the x - ray absorbers in agn .",
    "we started from the 70 months all - sky survey _ swift_-bat catalogue @xcite in the 20150 kev and the 66-month palermo bat catalogue ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we considered only those sources with a secure optical agn counterpart and with xrt observations already available before the end of 2012 . for each source",
    ", we adopted a daily binning of the xrt data and we searched for statistically significant variations of the x - ray colours on different time - scales ( from months to years , see @xcite ) . following this method , we selected five new candidates for variable absorbers .",
    "one of the most interesting is the local seyfert galaxy mrk 915 .",
    "the archival xrt data used to select this source unveiled a dramatic count rate and ` x - ray colour ' variability on a minimum time - scale of 1 month .",
    "the 0.310 kev count rate increases by a factor of 3 and , at the same time , the spectral shape becomes dramatically softer , showing a variability of a factor of 2.4 and 3 in the [ 210 kev]/[0.32 kev ] and [ 410 kev]/[0.34 kev ] count rate ratios , respectively .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , this behaviour suggests that a change in the properties of the x - ray obscuring circumnuclear medium ( i.e. column density , covering factor or ionization state ) probably occurred between the archival xrt observations . however , the low statistical quality of these data prevented us from performing a proper spectral analysis and to discern among the possible causes of the observed variation . with the goal of obtaining higher quality data on a shorter time - scale",
    ", we performed a daily xrt monitoring on this source during a period of @xmath73 weeks .",
    "this paper aims at providing a first characterization of the putative variable absorber .",
    "the paper is structured in the following way : the main optical properties of mrk  915 are reported in section 2 , while the analysis of the xrt data obtained during the daily monitoring are presented in section 3 ( light - curve analysis and spectral analysis , sections 3.1 and 3.2 , respectively ) .",

    "the background spectra have been extracted from source - free circular regions close to the object with an area about 9 times larger .",

    "the same value and uncertainties are obtained when @xmath28 is allowed to vary between the states .",
    "thus , considering the statistic of the present data , we decided to keep it fixed to the best - fitting value while investigating the origin of the variability .",
    "as a starting point , we assumed the presence of three absorbing components .",
    "the first one ( _ phabs _ component in xspec ) refers to the galactic hydrogen column density along the line of sight @xcite .",
    "the second one ( _ zphabs _ component in xspec ) accounts for the absorption due to the dust lane structures at the redshift of the source .",
    "indeed , as discussed in section 2 , the primary emission from the mrk 915 nucleus intercepts dust lane structures that produce an optical extinction of @xmath31=0.30.5 mag @xcite .",
    "the presence of these structures is expected to affect also the x - ray emission with a column density of the order of 10@xmath32 @xmath6 , assuming a galactic dust - to - gas ratio of e@xmath33/@xmath3=1.7@xmath3410@xmath35 mag @xmath36 @xcite . in the fitting procedure",

    "thus , this model can not be considered a good representation of the global spectral properties of the source . in particular , the shape of the residuals in fig .",

    "the emerging scenario is that , in both states , the nucleus is obscured by a variable ionized medium with an @xmath3 of the order of 2@xmath3410@xmath17 @xmath6 and a significant increase in the power - law normalization by a factor of @xmath71.5 from the low- ( ac ) to the high - state ( bd ) is also required ( see table  [ model ] ) .",

    "[ fig6 ] suggests also a marginally evidence for a change of the ionization state and of the cf , albeit with low significance .",

    "the possibility that the source could intrinsically decrease / increase its power was already suggested from observations in the optical domain ( see section 2 for relevant references ) .    as for the spectral variation observed in the x - ray domain , we found that it could be due to a change in the ionization state of the circumnuclear medium and/or to a change of the covering of absorbing medium along the line of sight .",
    "higher quality data are needed to understand if only one or both these parameters actually vary .",

    "<S> the light - curve analysis shows a significant count rate variation ( about a factor of 23 ) on a time - scale of a few days , while the x - ray colours show a change in the spectral curvature below 2 kev and the presence of two main spectral states . from the spectral analysis we find that the observed variations can be explained by the change of the intrinsic nuclear power ( about a factor of 1.5 ) coupled with a change of the properties of an ionized absorber . </S>",
    "<S> the quality of the data prevents us from firmly establishing if the spectral variation is due to a change in the ionization state and/or in the covering factor of the absorbing medium . </S>",
    "<S> the latter scenario would imply a clumpy structure of the ionized medium . by combining the information provided by the light curve and the spectral analyses </S>",
    "<S> , we can derive some constraints on the location of the absorber under the hypotheses of either homogeneous or clumpy medium . in both cases , we find that the absorber should be located inside the outer edge of an extended torus and , in particular , under the clumpy hypothesis , it should be located near , or just outside , to the broad emission line region .    </S>",
