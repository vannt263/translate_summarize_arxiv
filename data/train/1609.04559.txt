    "the telegraph process represents a simple prototype of finite velocity random motions on the line , whose probability law is governed by a hyperbolic partial differential equation that is the classical telegraph equation , widely used in mathematical physics both in problems of electromagnetism and heat conduction ( see for example @xcite ) . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors studied a generalization of the classical telegraph process with space - time varying propagation speed . within this framework ,",
    "the probabilistic model is based on the limit of a persistent random walk on a non  uniform lattice .",
    "the consequence of the assumption of a space - time depending velocity @xmath5 is that the probability law of the corresponding finite velocity random motion is governed by the following telegraph equation with variable coefficients @xmath6 + 2\\lambda \\frac{1}{c(x , t)}\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial t }      = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left[c(x , t)\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x}\\right].\\ ] ] in some cases it is possible to find the explicit form of the probability law of this generalization of the telegraph process , by solving equation subject to suitable initial conditions . in particular , we focus our attention on the case of space  depending velocity , where becomes @xmath7.\\ ] ] equation can be reduced to the form of the classical telegraph equation by using the change of variable @xmath8 provided that @xmath9 , @xmath10 such that @xmath11 for all @xmath10 .",

    "+ in this paper we consider the asymmetric telegraph process with space - varying velocity and also the symmetric telegraph process with a non - homogeneous poisson process governing the changes of space - dependent velocities .",
    "+ a section is devoted to a fractional euler - poisson - darboux - type equation and to the discussion of a special class of non - negative solutions .",
    "while the telegraph process on the line is essentially a persistent random walk with only two possible directions , the picture of finite velocity random motions on the plane and in the space is more complicated and gives rise to the studies of random flights ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "an interesting result , in this context , was proved by kolesnik and orsingher in @xcite , where the connection between planar random motions with an infinite number of possible directions and the damped wave equation was discussed . in their model ,",
    "the motion is described by a particle taking directions @xmath22 , @xmath23 , uniformly distributed in @xmath24 at poisson paced times .",
    "the orientations @xmath22 are i.i.d .",
    "r.v.s independent from the homogeneous poisson process @xmath25 of rate @xmath26 governing the changes of direction .",
    "the particle starts off at time @xmath27 from the origin and moves with constant velocity @xmath28 . at the epochs of the poisson process",
    "the particle takes new directions ( uniformly distributed in @xmath29 ) , independent from its previous evolution . under these assumptions ,",
    "it is possible to prove that the explicit probability law of the current position @xmath30 of the randomly moving particle is a solution of the damped wave equation @xmath31.\\ ] ]    in the last part of this paper , we consider the effect of a space - varying speed of propagation on the model of planar random motions with infinite possible directions , leading to the equation @xmath32 we show the consequence of assuming space - varying velocities on the form of the support @xmath33 of the distribution of @xmath30 . by means of the transformation @xmath34 the equation is reduced to the form and thus we can obtain the explicit distribution @xmath35 of @xmath30 .",
    "we then examine the form of the support of @xmath36 and analyze its dependence on the space - varying velocity .    in the special case",
    "where @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , we obtain that the boundary of @xmath33 is hyper - elliptic for @xmath40 and hypo - elliptic for @xmath41 and elliptic for @xmath42 .",
    "in this section we consider a generalization of the telegraph process with drift considered by beghin et al .",
    "( see reference @xcite ) in the case where the velocity is assumed to be space  varying .",
    "in particular , here we consider the random motion of a particle moving on the line and switching from the space - varying ( positive ) velocity @xmath43 to @xmath44 after an exponentially distributed time with rate @xmath45 and from @xmath44 to @xmath43 after an exponential time with a different rate @xmath46 .",
    "for the description of the random position of the particle @xmath47 at time @xmath1 we use the following probability densities @xmath48 satisfying the system of partial differential equations ( see @xcite for a detailed probabilistic derivation ) @xmath49 defining @xmath50 we have the following system of equations @xmath51 therefore the probability law @xmath52 is governed by the following telegraph - type equation with space - varying velocity and drift @xmath53 in order to eliminate the drift term and to find the explicit form of the probability law , we now introduce the following lorentz - type transformation of variables @xmath54 by means of some calculation we obtain that , by taking the following choice of the coefficients appearing in @xmath55 equation becomes the classical telegraph equation @xmath56 and we can therefore find the explicit probability law , starting from that of the classical telegraph process .",

    "we observe that the process @xmath66 has a discrete component of the distribution concentrated at @xmath67 ( see @xcite ) , while @xmath47 has only an absolutely continuous distribution ( see @xcite ) .    starting from and",
    ", we can clearly build other families of explicit probability laws of the form @xmath68 which depend on the particular choice of @xmath9 ( s.t .",
    "@xmath69 for all @xmath70 ) .",
    "these probability laws are clearly related to the following partial differential equations @xmath71 respectively .",
    "another interesting case is @xmath72 , which converts equation into the classical euler - poisson - darboux equation .",
    "the first probabilistic interpretation of the fundamental solution of the epd equation was given by rosencrans in @xcite and some of its generalizations have been considered in @xcite . in the spirit of the previous observations , we have that the solution of the cauchy problem @xmath73 can be written as @xmath74    we finally observe that it is possible to consider other cases of non - homogeneous telegraph processes with space - dependent velocities according to the following simple steps :    * consider the equation @xmath75 governing a telegraph process on the line , where the changes of direction are given by a non - homogeneous poisson process with a deterministic time - dependent rate @xmath58 and with space - dependent velocity @xmath43 . *",
    "define the new variables @xmath76 and @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is a @xmath79 function that will be defined in the next step ; * in the new variables we have that @xmath80 satisfies the equation @xmath81 * take @xmath78 such that @xmath82 .",
    "then the problem is finally reduced to the following dalembert equation with time - depending coefficient @xmath83 * by taking the further change of variable @xmath84 and calling @xmath85 we finally reduce equation to the classical dalembert equation in the variables @xmath86 @xmath87 thus an observer in the framework @xmath86 sees the original random motion transformed into a deterministic one governed by the classical dalembert equation .",
    "we here provide some new results about the euler - poisson - darboux equation involving time - fractional derivatives in the sense of riemann - liouville ( see @xcite ) and with space - varying velocity .",
    "it is well - known that the epd equation governs a telegraph process with time - dependent rate @xmath3 .",
    "as far as we know this is the first investigation about the time - fractional epd equation .    the @xmath88-dimensional time fractional epd - type equation @xmath89 with @xmath90 and @xmath91 admits the following non - negative solution : + for @xmath92 @xmath93 , \\quad & \\|\\mathbf{x}_d\\| < \\frac{t^{\\nu}}{c_2^{1/2 } } , \\\\      0 \\quad & \\mbox{elsewhere } ,      \\end{cases}\\ ] ] while for @xmath94 @xmath95 , \\quad      \\forall \\",
