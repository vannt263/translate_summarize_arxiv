    "over the past three years , lev vaidman and his coworkers published several papers discussing a new method for analyzing the past of a photon detected at the output of an interferometer @xcite .",
    "this method , based on the two - state vector formalism ( tsvf ) , raised a vivid debate within the scientific community . in their seminal paper on this topic @xcite , danan _ et al .",
    "_ presented experimental evidence for the validity of this approach . in that experiment ,",
    "two nested mach - zehnder interferometers were constructed with mirrors a , b , c , e and f vibrating at distinct frequencies ( see fig . [ fig_scheme ] ) .",
    "harmonic analysis of the output signal allowed to determine whether a photon passed by a specific mirror .",
    "three different configurations were tested in the original experiment . in one of these configurations ( labeled as `` c '' in the original paper )",
    "a highly counterintuitive outcome was obtained .",
    "this result was observed when the outer interferometer was disabled by blocking its lower arm ( path `` c '' ) and thus only the inner interferometer was operational .",
    "phase shift in this inner interferometer was adjusted so that the two indistinguishable photon paths interfered destructively in the detected output port ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "quite surprisingly , even the photons , whose paths in the interferometer had been identified by the harmonic analysis , interfered destructively .",
    "this effect seemingly violates the englert - greenberger - yasin duality relation , which is related with the wave - particle duality of photons @xcite .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite argued that this effect can be explained by means of the tsvf .",
    "this particular experiment and the unusual interpretation of the results were subsequently followed by a number of papers @xcite .",
    "authors of these papers for instance provided an alternative classical formalism @xcite for the experiment or questioned its specific implementation @xcite .    in 2015",
    ", we theoretically analyzed the danan _",
    "_ experiment @xcite and proposed a standard quantum - mechanical description of the action of vibrating mirrors introducing distinguishable modes @xcite . in that paper",
    ", we also argued that the method used to process detected light in the danan _",
    "_ experiment is not suitable because it neglects part of the signal .",
    "this is then incorrectly interpreted as observing destructive interference . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we proposed a different measurement technique to reveal the path of the photon inside the interferometer .",
    "the suggested detection method is based on direct spectral power density measurement .",
    "we predicted identical results in all configurations of the danan _",
    "_ experiment except for the counterintuitive case with blocked path `` c '' .",
    "our detection method predicts quite intuitive results even in this configuration .    in this paper",
    ", we report on an experimental implementation of our measurement method . instead of the vibrating mirrors we use different frequency filters to shape spectra of the photons propagating in the upper and lower arm of the interferometer .",
    "thus , we `` leave a mark '' on them which can then be used to extract which - path information during the detection stage . our detection method and the one presented in the original paper by danan _",
    "_ give incompatible results only when the path `` c '' is blocked ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_scheme ] ) . in this case",
    ", the outer interferometer does not influence the results and therefore we can test our detection method using only one mach  zehnder interferometer playing the same role as the inner interferometer in the danan _ et al . _ experiment .",

    "the light is coupled into the interferometer through the beam splitter bs@xmath3 .",
    "motorized translation stage in the lower arm is used to balance the lengths of both interferometer arms . the piezo translation stage in the upper arm is used to change the relative phase between these arms . in this experiment , we used two identical narrow - band spectral filters f@xmath2 with transmission bandwidth of centered at .",
    "f@xmath4 was mounted on a rotation stage . by rotating the filter",
    ", we were able to shift its transmission window to shorter wavelengths . in our experiment ,",
    "filters f@xmath3 and f@xmath4 introduce distinguishability between the interferometer arms just as the vibrating mirrors did in the original paper @xcite .",
    "finally , the beam splitter bs@xmath4 couples the light from both the interferometer arms . due to technological imperfections , bs@xmath3 and bs@xmath4 have not perfectly balanced splitting ratios .",
    "also the overall transmissivity of f@xmath4 depends on its rotation .",
    "therefore , a neutral density filter ( ndf ) was inserted into the upper arm to balance effective losses .",
    "the monochromator ( mc ) jobin yvon triax 320 is located in one of the interferometer output ports and provides the capability to discriminate spectral components of the beam ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_setup ] ) .",
    "light was transferred from the output port of bs@xmath4 to this monochromator using a single - mode fiber to maximize spatial mode indistinguishability .",
    "detection was performed at the output of the monochromator using a power meter pm120 by thorlabs ( labeled d ) .",
    "for the preliminary adjustments of the setup , both filters f@xmath2 were rotated perpendicular to the light beam direction and the detector was placed directly to the bs@xmath4 output port bypassing thus the monochromator .",
    "first , we ensured precise coupling of the beam to the setup .",
    "we checked , that the polarization remains unchanged while being transmitted or reflected on beam splitters .",
    "the second part of the adjustment procedure consists of several steps , which have to be repeated for each setting of the measurement .",
    "balanced output intensities from both arms are achieved by rotating ndf wheel with gradient absorption .",
    "then lengths of the arms were equalized by positioning the translation stage mt .",
    "accurate setting of the mt position was adjusted by finding maximum of the autocorrelation function of the signal .",
    "we were able to reach visibility of the interferometer typically about in the initial configuration with filter f@xmath4 inserted perpendicularly to the beam .",
    "the interferometer was suffciently stable to scan the interference fringes by varying voltage on the piezo - driven translation stage .",
    "the purpose of our experiment is to recreate a similar situation as in the original research paper by danan _",
    "_ @xcite . but instead of using vibrating mirrors , we encode the which - path information directly into different shapes of spectra in the upper and lower interferometer arm .",
    "further to that , our experimental configuration allows us to tune the distinguishability between the interferometer arms .",
    "this is achieved by rotation of the second filter f@xmath4 . in subsequent paragraphs , we label three spectral modes a , b and e in accordance to the labelling of mirrors by danan _",

    "mirror e stood in front of that interferometer . observing vibration frequencies a and b thus gave information about the propagation of light in the upper and lower arm respectively .",
    "frequency peak e did not provide any which - path information . similarly to that , we associate spectral modes a and b with the modes maximizing the predictability of photons propagating in the upper ( mode a ) and lower ( mode b ) arm .",
    "mode e was chosen to give least amount of predictability . in the original experiment @xcite",
    ", the modes with gaussian spectral profile reflected from mirrors a and b are probabilistically distinguishable by detection of their transverse spatial modes .",
    "the beams are indistinguishable if the mirrors are deviated by equal angle from plane of the interferometer .",
    "therefore , except particular times , the beams reflected from mirrors a and b are probabilistically distinguishable . in our experiment ,",
    "the same is true for beams with quasi - gaussian spectra shaped by filters f@xmath3 and f@xmath4 .",
    "the probabilistic distinguishability in transversal spatial modes is interchanged with probabilistic distinguishability in spectrum .",
    "we have performed several sets of measurements for assorted rotation angles of f@xmath4 .",
    "each measurement set consists of several scans through the frequency spectrum in the range from to with resolution of .",
    "first , we simply measured spectra separately from the upper and lower arm .",
    "we used this data to calculate theoretical predictions for the visibility .",
    "next , for each wavelength we measured the visibility of interference as a measure of indistinguishability between the arms .",

    "while the quad - cell detector registers intensity fluctuations of the resulting interference pattern due to the beam sweeping across its halves , the monochromator distinguishes the spectral marks directly .",
    "we emulate the sweep by accumulating the spectra for various rotations of filter f@xmath4 . similar to the halves of the quad - cell detector , we have divided the obtained spectra into two bins ( see fig .  [ fig_min ] ) .",
    "this division between the bins was made at the wavelength @xmath112 associated with the mode e. this mode corresponds to maximum indistinguishability like the central axis of the quad - cell detector . in fig .",
    "[ fig_min2 ] we summarize normalized powers integrated over the two selected bins @xmath115 and their difference @xmath116 .    for large spectral overlap of the filters f@xmath3 and f@xmath4 ,",
    "the interference fringe is deeply modulated and the integrated minimal intensities @xmath113 and @xmath114 are small . increasing the spectral distance of the filters @xmath9 , the interference visibility decreases leading to higher values of binned intensities @xmath113 and @xmath114 . simultaneously the predictability of the photon path increases . but even though there is clearly a distinguishable signal from the two arms of the interferometer , @xmath117 simply ignores the which - path information due to the subtraction of @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",

    "in this paper , we have demonstrated an alternative which - path detection method to the original harmonic analysis used in ref .",
    "our method is based on direct frequency resolution of the signal at the output of the interferometer .",
    "in contrast to the harmonic analysis , our method yields quite intuitive results that do not violate the englert - greenberger - yasin inequality .",
    "we have shown that when the frequency modes corresponding to respective arms of the interferometer are completely distinguishable , the interference vanishes and signal is observed independently on mutual phase shift between the interferometer arms . on the other hand , frequency modes that give no which - path information manifest high interference visibility as expected .",
