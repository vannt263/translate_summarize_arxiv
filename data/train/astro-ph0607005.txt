    "the investigation of spin frequencies from burst oscillations of eleven nuclear - powered millisecond pulsars showed that the spin distribution had an upper limit at 730 hz @xcite .",
    "the fastest rotating neutron star discovered recently has a spin frequency 716 hz @xcite . in this respect , the study of r - modes in rotating neutron stars has generated great interest in understanding the absence of very fast rotating neutron stars in nature .",
    "the r - modes are subject to chandrasekhar - friedman - schutz gravitational radiation instability in rapidly rotating neutron stars @xcite which may play an important role in regulating spins of young neutron stars as well as old , accreting neutron stars in low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) .",
    "another aspect of the r - mode instability is that this could be a possible source for gravitational radiation @xcite which may shed light on the interior of a neutron star .",
    "it was realised that the r - mode instability could be effectively suppressed by bulk viscosity due to exotic matter in neutron star interior when the compact star cools down to a temperature @xmath1 k. the coefficient of bulk viscosity due to non - leptonic weak processes involving exotic matter such as hyperon and quark matter was calculated by several authors @xcite .",
    "it was noted that relaxation times of the non - leptonic processes were within a few orders magnitude of the period of perturbations and gave rise to large bulk viscosity coefficient .",
    "this led to the complete suppression of the r - mode instability .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the effect of hyperon matter including hyperon - hyperon interaction on bulk viscosity coefficient and the r - mode stability . in sec . 2 of this paper , we discuss the model used to calculate equations of state , bulk viscosity coefficient and the corresponding time scale .",
    "results of our calculation are analysed in sec .",
    "section 4 gives the outlook .",
    "we describe the @xmath2-equilibrated and charge neutral hyperon matter within the framework of a relativistic field theoretical model where baryon - baryon interaction is mediated by the exchange of scalar and vector mesons and hyperon - hyperon interaction is taken into account by two strange mesons ",
    "scalar @xmath3 ( hereafter denoted as @xmath4 ) and vector @xmath5 @xcite . the lagrangian density for hyperon matter including non - interacting electrons and muons is written as @xmath6 the dirac bispinor @xmath7 represents isospin multiplets for baryons @xmath8=@xmath9 , @xmath0 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "here vacuum baryon mass is @xmath12 , and isospin operator @xmath13 while @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 are field strength tensors .",
    "neutrons and protons do not couple with @xmath4 and @xmath5 mesons .",
    "the scalar self - interaction term @xcite is given by @xmath17 we perform the calculation in the mean field approximation .",
    "the total energy density and pressure are respectively given by @xmath18 and @xmath19 where @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are fermi momentum , spin and isospin projection and number density of baryon @xmath8 respectively .",
    "the last terms in energy density and pressure are due to leptons .",
    "the effective baryon mass is defined as @xmath24 .",
    "the charge neutrality and chemical equilibrium conditions are given by q = @xmath25 and @xmath26 where @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are respectively the chemical potentials of neutrons , electrons and baryon @xmath30 and @xmath31 and @xmath32 are baryon and electric charge of baryon @xmath30 .",
    "the chemical potential of baryons @xmath8 is given by @xcite @xmath33 .    in this calculation",
    "we adopt nucleon - meson coupling constants of gm set @xcite .",
    "the coupling constants are obtained by reproducing properties of saturated nuclear matter such as binding energy @xmath34 mev , saturation density n@xmath35 = 0.153 @xmath36 , asymmetry energy 32.5 mev , effective nucleon mass 0.78 and incompressibility 240 mev .",
    "the hadronic masses used in this calculation are @xmath37 = 550 mev , @xmath38 = 783 mev , @xmath39 = 770 mev and @xmath40 = 938 mev . on the other hand ,",
    "hyperon - vector meson coupling constants are determined using su(6 ) symmetry of the quark model @xcite and the scalar @xmath41 meson coupling to hyperons is calculated from hyperon potential depths in normal nuclear matter such as @xmath42 = @xmath43 mev @xcite , @xmath44 = @xmath45 mev @xcite and a repulsive potential depth for @xmath10 hyperons @xmath46 = + 30 mev @xcite as obtained from hypernuclei data .",
    "the hyperon-@xmath4 coupling constants are determined from double @xmath0 hypernuclei data @xcite .",
    "we obtain the eos solving equations of motion along with the expression for effective baryon mass and charge neutrality and beta equilibrium constraints @xcite .",
    "now we discuss the bulk viscosity coefficient in young neutron stars which cool down to temperatures @xmath47 @xmath48 k after their births .",
    "as the system goes out of chemical equilibrium due to pressure and density variations associated with the r - mode oscillations , microscopic reaction processes in particular non - leptonic weak interaction processes including exotic particles might restore the equilibrium @xcite . here",
    "we calculate the real part of bulk viscosity coefficient ( @xmath49 ) in terms of relaxation times of microscopic processes @xcite @xmath50 where the difference of infinite ( @xmath51 ) and zero ( @xmath52 ) frequency adiabatic indices is given by @xcite @xmath53 in the co - rotating frame , the angular velocity ( @xmath54 ) of @xmath55 r - mode is related to angular velocity ( @xmath56 ) of a rotating neutron star as @xmath57 @xcite . in this calculation , for @xmath58 r - mode , it is @xmath59 . the relaxation time ( @xmath60 ) for the non - leptonic process @xmath61",
    "is given by @xcite    @xmath62    where @xmath63 is the fermi momentum for @xmath0 hyperons , @xmath64 is the angle averaged squared matrix element and @xmath65 with @xmath66 . we obtain expressions for @xmath67 from the baryon chemical potential and equations of motion for meson fields @xcite . for example , @xmath68 similarly , we compute other components of @xmath67 .",
    "it is to be noted here that nucleons do not couple with strange mesons , i.e. @xmath69 = 0 .",
    "the hyperon bulk viscosity damping timescale ( @xmath70 ) contributes to the imaginary part of the r - mode frequency and is calculated in the following way @xcite @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the energy of the perturbation in the co - rotating frame of the fluid @xmath73 the derivative of @xmath72 with respect to time is given by @xmath74 where we need to know the energy density @xmath75 and bulk viscosity @xmath76 profiles of a neutron star .",
    "similarly , we estimate the damping time scale ( @xmath77 ) corresponding to the bulk viscosity due to the modified urca process including only nucleons using the bulk viscosity coefficient as given by @xcite . it was noted that gravitational radiation drives the r - modes unstable .",
    "so the gravitational radiation time scale ( @xmath78 ) has a negative contribution to the imaginary part of the r - mode frequency .",
    "further , the overall r - mode time scale ( @xmath79 ) is defined as @xmath80 the r - mode is stable below the critical angular velocity which is obtained from the solution of @xmath81 = 0 .",
    "the critical angular velocity depends both on the mass of the neutron star and its temperature .",
    "including hyperon matter with hyperon - hyperon interaction . ]",
    "we perform this calculation using the gm set @xcite as it has been described in sec 2 .",
    "it is found that @xmath0 hyperons appear first at 2.6n@xmath35 followed by @xmath82 hyperons at 2.9n@xmath35 .",
    "however no @xmath10 hyperons appear in the system because of strongly repulsive @xmath10-nuclear matter interaction @xcite .",
    "further , we find that after the appearance of negatively charged @xmath11 hyperons , number densities of electrons and muons decrease in the system .",
    "this is attributed to the charge neutrality condition . due to the appearance of additional degrees of freedom in the form of hyperons ,",
    "the eos of hyperon matter becomes softer compared with that of nucleons - only matter . on the other hand ,",
    "the interplay between the attractive @xmath4 field and repulsive @xmath5 field which becomes dominant with increasing density , makes the eos softer initially and stiffer at higher densities than the eos without hyperon - hyperon interaction .",
    "this behaviour of the eos is reflected in the calculation of maximum mass and the corresponding radius of the neutron star . in fig . 1",
    ", we plot the mass - radius relationship of non - rotating neutron stars calculated by solving tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff equation for equations of state including nucleons - only matter ( blue solid line ) and hyperon matter with ( dashed line ) and without ( magenta solid line ) hyperon - hyperon interaction . here",
    "the highest maximum mass corresponds to the stiffest eos of nucleons - only matter .",
    "the maximum masses corresponding to the eos with and without hyperon - hyperon interaction are 1.64 m@xmath83 and 1.69 m@xmath83 respectively . using the rotating neutron star ( rns ) model of stergioulas @xcite , we find that the maximum masses corresponding to the eos with and without hyperon - hyperon interaction are respectively 1.95 m@xmath83 and 2.00 m@xmath83 .",
    "next we discuss the hyperon bulk viscosity due to the non - leptonic process given by eq .",
    "the bulk viscosity coefficient is dependent on the eos as it is evident from the expression in eq .",
    "the temperature dependence of the bulk viscosity enters through the relaxation time as given by eq .",
    "the bulk viscosity coefficient reaches a maximum and then drops with increasing baryon density as found by @xcite .",
    "it has been also noted that the bulk viscosity increases as temperature decreases .",
    "therefore , the large value of @xmath49 might be effective in suppressing r - mode instability as neutron stars cool down to a few times @xmath84 k.     including hyperon matter with hyperon - hyperon interaction . ]    the neutron star which was rotating rapidly at its birth , slows down due to gravitational wave emission .",
    "a rotating neutron star has less central energy density than its non - rotating counterpart because of the centrifugal force .",
    "consequently , hyperon thresholds are sensitive to rotation periods of compact stars . in the calculation of critical angular velocity , we consider a rotating neutron star of mass 1.6 m@xmath83 and the corresponding central baryon density is 3.9n@xmath35 which is well above the threshold of @xmath0 hyperons",
    ". this star is rotating at an angular velocity 2952 s@xmath85 .",
    "it slowed down from its keplerian angular velocity 5600 s@xmath85 when the central baryon density was below the @xmath0 hyperon threshold .",
    "the calculation of critical angular velocity requires the knowledge of energy density and bulk viscosity profiles in compact stars as it is evident from eqs .",
    "( 11)-(14 ) . in fig .",
    "2 , the hyperon bulk viscosity profile ( dashed line ) of the rotating neutron star of mass 1.6 m@xmath83 is shown as a function of equatorial distance along with that of a non - rotating ( solid line ) star of same mass .",
    "we note that the peak of the profile shifts towards the center in the case of the rotating neutron star .",
    "earlier calculation of critical angular velocity was performed using energy density and bulk viscosity profiles of non - rotating neutron stars .",
    "recently , @xcite studied the effect of rotation on critical angular velocity .",
    "we calculate the critical angular velocity using energy density and bulk viscosity profiles of the rotating star . in fig .",
    "3 the critical angular velocity is plotted versus temperature . we find that the r - mode instability is suppressed by hyperon bulk viscosity . here",
    "we do not consider the impact of superfluidity of baryons on bulk viscosity .",
    "however , several calculations @xcite showed that superfluidity of baryons might suppress the bulk viscosity and the damping of the r - mode instability .",
    "other forms of matter such as @xmath86 condensed matter and quark matter may appear and compete with the @xmath0 hyperon threshold in neutron star interior . in an earlier calculation we showed that the condensate of @xmath87 mesons appeared at @xmath47 twice normal nuclear matter density followed by the appearance of @xmath0 hyperons @xcite .",
    "it would be worth investigating how the bulk viscosity coefficient due to the process ( 7 ) is modified in this situation .",
    "also , we are studying whether the non - leptonic process involving @xmath86 condensate @xmath88 could give rise to bulk viscosity coefficient as large as that of the non - leptonic process ( 7 ) and damp the r - mode instability effectively @xcite .",
