    "the andreev reflection ( ar ) is an electron - hole conversion process taking place between a normal metal and a superconductor with the excitation energy of the incident electrons is lower than the superconducting gap energy , which was originally proposed by a. f. andreev in 1964 [ ] . this conventional andreev reflection is also called the andreev retro - reflection since the reflected holes will retrace the path of the incident electrons .",
    "a recent theoretical observation on the andreev reflection at the interface between a sheet of pure graphene and a sheet of thin film graphene s - wave superconductor induced by proximity effect unvieled another andreev reflection process , known as the specular andreev reflection [ , ] .",
    "this process takes place when an incident electron with its excitation energy greater than the fermi energy but lower than the superconducting gap in the conduction band is converted into a hole in the valence band associated with a reverse on the velocity parallel to the n / sc interface .",
    "moreover , at the energy higher than the fermi energy the andreev conductance is dominated by the andreev specular reflection .",
    "after the discovery of the andreev specular reflection in graphene superconductor junction [ , ] , the andreev specular reflection is also predicted to happen in a 2@xmath6 semiconductor - superconductor junction with finite rashba spin - orbit ( so ) coupling [ ] .",
    "in addition , various theoretical works concerning the andreev reflection have been done on a variety of n / sc junctions with underlying honeycomb lattice structure such as graphene/@xmath7-wave superconductor [ ] , bilayer - graphene / s - wave superconductor [ ] and the topological materials [ , ] .",
    "these works all relies on the assumption of a clean and smooth n / sc interface .",
    "recently , the ar on a graphene - based superconducting junction has been experimentally realized in ref . and , the andreev conductance across a low disorder van der waals interface formed between bilayer graphene and superconducting nbse@xmath8 has been measured .",
    "they found the conductance across the n / sc junction was suppressed when the fermi level across the junction was tuned to lie within the superconducting gap , which gave a solid evidence on the transition between andreev retro - reflection ( intra - band process ) to andreev specular reflection ( inter - band process ) on a graphene honeycomb lattice .",
    "moreover , due to the limitation on the fabrication technology of transparent n / sc junctions , a finite tunneling transparency on the n / sc junction has been also measured .",
    "the above limitations strongly suggest that the previous theoretical calculations on the andreev conductance under the assumption of a transparent n / sc junction are not sufficient to account for the most recent experimental observations . in this paper",
    ", we try to simulate realistic n / sc junction with different degree of tunneling transparency . to do so",
    ", we first realize that for relatisvistic materials , the impurity potentials in the junction do not suppress the current . instead , due to the phenomena associated with the klein paradox",
    ", the impurity potentials tend to enhance the tunneling current [ ] .",
    "therefore , unlike the conventional blonder-tinkham-klapwijk ( btk ) formalism [ ] in which the transparency of the tunneling is simulated by the impurity potential across the junction , it is not feasible to control the transparency for the n / sc junctions made by relativistic materials via impurity potentials .    in this work , we show that the local strain in the junction is the key factor that determines the transparency of the junction made by relativistic materials . in particular ,",
    "we describe how to impose different degrees of transparency by adding a narrow homogeneous local strain parallel to the n / sc interface [ , ] for a system with underlying honeycomb lattice .",
    "it is shown that a @xmath1-gauge field on the n / sc interface arises and can be used to investitage the andreev reflection in various degrees of tunneling transparency .",
    "we choose the graphene normal metal/@xmath5-wave superconductor n / sc junction as an example and compute the andreev conductance via the btk formalism [ ] in the presence of a @xmath1-gauge potential .",
    "as the strength of the @xmath1-barrier is varied , the behaviors of andreev conductance obtained via our approach are in good agreement with the results obtained in the case of 1d normal metal/@xmath9-wave n / sc junction in ref . .",
    "next , we apply our theory to the case of a @xmath0 topological quantum spin hall insulator . due to the broken valley - degeneracy [ , ] ,",
    "the andreev conductance from the incident electrons near the two dirac points exhibits entirely different behaviors .",
