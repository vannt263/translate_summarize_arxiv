    "first , we consider a lattice gas of _ interacting _ searchers . throughout",
    "most of the paper , we assume that the searchers interact via exclusion .",

    "the average behavior of this gas is still described by the diffusion equation ( [ difeq ] ) with @xmath23 @xcite , so the ssep and the rws are indistinguishable at the level of averages . however , as we show here , the long - time asymptotic of the target survival probability @xmath1 for the ssep behaves differently from that for the rws : @xmath24 this expression has the same structure as eq .",
    "( [ survivaldecay3 ] ) , but it increases much faster with the gas density @xmath10 @xcite ; see fig .",
    "[ arcsinsquared ] .",
    "we note that previous results for the ssep only included bounds on @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "second , we show that , for @xmath17 , the survival probability @xmath1 depends strongly on the initial condition",
    ". this effect does not require inter - particle interaction , and it also occurs for the rws , as we show below . in particular , the asymptotic  ( [ survivaldecay1 ] ) is only valid after averaging over random initial distributions of particles , that is , for the annealed setting @xcite .",
    "we find a different result for a deterministic initial condition , also called a quenched setting @xcite .",
    "for the rws , the two results for @xmath8 differ by a numerical factor . for the ssep",
    ", even their @xmath10-dependence is different for @xmath17 .",
    "third , we demonstrate that the two basic one - dimensional solutions , annealed and quenched , play a central role in higher dimensions when one is interested in _ intermediate _ asymptotics of @xmath1 for @xmath26 , that is when the diffusion length @xmath22 is much longer than the lattice constant , but much shorter than the absorber radius @xmath0 .",
    "fourth , in addition to evaluating @xmath1 in different regimes , we also find the most likely history of the gas density conditional on the target survival until time @xmath2 .",
    "we achieve this result , and most of the others , by employing the macroscopic fluctuation theory ( mft ) @xcite .",
    "this coarse - grained large - deviation formalism was unavailable when most of the studies of the target survival probability were performed .",
    "the mft is well suited for the analysis of large deviations in lattice gases , including the ( unlikely ) target survival at long times that we are dealing with here .",

    "the macroscopic fluctuation theory ( mft ) was developed for the analysis of non - equilibrium steady states of diffusive lattice gases  @xcite .",

    "we outline the mft formulation , referring the reader to the above references for further details .",
