    "understanding the evolution of water waves is a longstanding problem .",
    "for instance , stokes already discussed a precise wave at least 130 years ago @xcite and his name has been given to this wave .",
    "such a wave was still discussed more than one century later @xcite !",
    "one of the striking phenomena is that there exist surface waves that travel almost without modification .",
    "such a behavior is an impetus to investigate the dynamics of these waves .",
    "the first motivation is to understand how they may either disperse or dissipate and yet not vanish .",
    "it was discovered that there is a regime in which nonlinearity compensates dispersion ( with no dissipation ) .",
    "another motivation is more technical .",
    "should a wave keep its shape for a long time without vanishing , it could be used in telecommunication without requiring repeaters .",
    "such a new technology could drastically reduce the cost of telecommunications .    beyond mathematical and industrial considerations ,",
    "mathematicians and physicists model the water waves with a fluid flow in a channel of ( often ) flat bottom , without meniscus ( appart in @xcite ) .",
    "since the euler or navier - stokes equations are rather prone to faithfully model such a fluid , one could be satisfied with either of these models .",
    "yet , the direct numerical simulation is too expensive and asymptotic models are required . in such models , one assumes a regime of dimensionless parameters smallness and makes expansions of the equations to derive a simplified model with less fields and less dimensions .",
    "the techniques are very different depending on whether one chooses euler or navier - stokes as a model for the fluid .    on the one hand , for an inviscid flow ( euler )",
    ", one assumes very often irrotationality .",
    "then one may use a potential function and a dirichlet to neumann operator in the zakharov - craig - sulem formulation .",
    "numerous articles use this formulation and a review of the mathematical proofs has been published @xcite .",
    "some authors use a velocity - pressure formulation , but they still assume the irrotationnality assumption @xcite . the derivation of kadomtsev - petviashvili ( kp ) assumes a predominant propagation direction along @xmath0 and a weakly transverse propagation along @xmath1 .",
    "it is initially done for an inviscid fluid in and the justification of this approximation is done in @xcite ( subsection 7.2 ) . in @xcite ,",
    "d. lannes proves that the sum of one wave propagating to the right and one to the left , both obeying a kp equation converges ( when @xmath2 tends to zero ) on @xmath3 $ ] to a function consistent with the boussinesq system , meaning that it is a solution , should it be only up to @xmath4 .",
    "various difficulties must be considered with these surface wave models .",
    "firstly two scales of the transverse velocity are choosen in the literature .",
    "either one assumes the transverse velocity to be @xmath5 or @xmath6 .",
    "this problem was raised in remark 3 of @xcite and here in remark [ rem_lannes_johnson ] .",
    "it leads to different boussinesq systems .    in @xcite ,",
    "the authors prove that a dimensionless water wave system in an infinite strip under the influence of gravity and surface tension has a unique solution on @xmath7 $ ] .",
    "more precisely , if the initial solution is sufficiently regular and small ( @xmath6 ) , there exists a solution , on this time interval @xmath7 $ ] , that will remain small ( @xmath6 ) . in @xcite ,",
    "the same authors prove that on the same time interval , these solutions can be accurately approximated by sums of solutions of two decoupled kp equations .",
    "it enhances the results of @xcite by taking surface tension and a variable bottom into consideration .",
    "the boussinesq _ equation _ is a generalization of the kdv equation for waves moving both to the right and to the left . from the boussinesq system , instead of changing to a frame moving to the right as is done for kdv , we remain in the same coordinate system and get higher order equation ( perturbed wave equation ) , as is done in @xcite ( p. 216",
    "+ on the other hand , when one assumes the fluid to be viscous , one may not use the potential function .",
    "moreover the number of boundary conditions changes then .",
    "viscosity has been considered in water waves since 1895 by boussinesq @xcite .",
    "the dynamic of viscous water waves on finite depth was investigated more recently by kakutani and matsuuchi @xcite .",
    "they derived the viscous kdv equation from vanishing initial conditions but made the error of using a fourier transform in time while the problem is of cauchy type .",
    "liu and orfila @xcite , and the coauthors of p.l .- f .",
    "liu in subsequent articles , investigated the viscous boussinessq system with vanishing initial condition , and validated their kdv equation by some experiments .",
    "for instance they experimentally proved the reverse flow in the boundary layer , which is predicted by theory .    although it was not done in sobolev spaces , the derivation of the viscous boussinesq system ( 1d and isotropic 2d ) and 1d kdv equation with a non - vanishing initial condition was done in @xcite without surface tension .",
    "it was partially the goal of @xcite not to rely on the irrotationnality assumption so as to derive the boussinesq system and kdv equation for a viscous fluid .",
    "this could be achieved thanks to the fact that one of the equations contains @xmath8 which is the zeroth order of the irrotationnality assumption . in @xcite ,",
    "a more detailed bibliography was given and the reason why all the preceding articles did not derive the same kdv equation is explained .    in this article , we intend to cross the results for a viscous fluid with some results concerning inviscid fluids ( kp , boussinesq equation , surface tension ) .",
    "+ the outline of this article is as follows . in section [ sec.2 ] , we present the equations and state the viscous boussinesq system in 2d with surface tension and a predominant propagation direction .",
    "this result is needed to get the new results on viscous 1d kdv equations in section [ sec.3 ] , the viscous kp equation ( 2d generalization of kdv with a weak transverse propagation ) derived in section [ sec.4 ] , and the viscous boussinesq equation derived in section [ sec.5 ] .",
    "finally , we justify that our boussinesq system is consistent with the navier - stokes equations in section [ sec.6 ] .",
    "all these derivations are done for a viscous fluid with surface tension and non - vanishing initial conditions .",
    "below , we define the geometry , write the equations , and then make these equations dimensionless ( subsection [ subsec.2.1 ] ) .",
    "these equations model a propagation predominantly in the @xmath0-direction .",
    "this will enable us to make a linear analysis with the dispersion relation and an asymptotic of the phase velocity in subsection [ subsec.2.2 ] .",
    "a discussion of the relevance of viscosity and surface tension will be given in subsection [ subsec.2.3 ] .",
    "we will then use the results of @xcite , where the 1d viscous isotropic boussinesq system and kdv equation are derived , so as to state the weakly transverse 2d viscous boussinesq system ( subsection [ subsec.2.4 ] ) .",
    "our present derivation includes surface tension , viscosity and a propagation mainly along @xmath0 and weakly along @xmath1 .",

    "see section 9.1.2 of @xcite for some references .",
    "in the case of a flow in a shallow channel ( some @xmath90 height ) , and for mercury , a depression solitary wave was predicted ( as early as the initial article of korteweg and de vries @xcite ) and observed in @xcite . in this experiment , @xmath91 , @xmath92 . as a consequence , re=@xmath93 and viscosity",

    "the complex phase velocity ( [ tl.2 ] ) contains gravitational and viscous terms that we want to compare so as to find the regime at which their variations are of the same order of magnitude .",

    ". in this regime of very large re , studied hereafter , the dependence of @xmath107 on @xmath2 is such that ( to simplify , we assume here @xmath108 ) : @xmath109 this would be wrong if @xmath110 as is well - known for non - viscous fluids . in that case",
    ", we would need to go further in the expansion .",
    "but since it was assumed above that @xmath111 is between @xmath4 and @xmath95 , we are driven to choose the regime ( [ tl.7 ] ) and exclude @xmath112 .",
    "our main purpose here is to state an asymptotic system of reduced size from the global navier - stokes equations in the whole _ moving _",
    "domain with surface tension and a predominant propagation direction .",
    "[ prop.1 ] let @xmath113 .",
    "let @xmath114 be the free boundary s height .",
    "let @xmath115 for @xmath116 ( resp .",
    "@xmath117 for @xmath118 ) be the initial horizontal velocity in the boundary layer ( resp . in the upper part of the domain ) .",

    "if for any @xmath121 , @xmath122 and @xmath123 are uniformly continuous in @xmath124 and @xmath125 , then the solution of the navier - stokes equation with this given initial condition satisfies the weakly transverse boussinesq system : @xmath126 where the convolution , denoted with @xmath127 , is in time , the parameters @xmath128 and @xmath27 have been defined and @xmath129 .    with the change of notation @xmath130 , the whole proof is the very same as in @xcite and is omitted .",
    "had we proceeded in the same way as @xcite , we would have distinguished two subdomains : the upper part ( @xmath131 ) where viscosity can be neglected , and the lower part ( @xmath132 ) which is a boundary layer at the bottom and where viscosity must be taken into account .",
    "the resolution in each part would have enabled to match the solution on the common boundary .",
    "instead , we assume overlapping domains .",
    "[ rem_lannes_johnson ] as is stressed at the non - dimensionnalizing step , there are two choices for the scale of the transverse horizontal velocity",

    "book @xcite for instance or many others ) , or one uses @xmath134 ( see the article of lannes - saut @xcite for instance ) .",
    "firstly one must notice that since this field is not eliminated ( as @xmath60 is ) , its scale is relevant",
    ". moreover the latter scaling is more general than the former one because it does not assume @xmath57 to be @xmath6 .",
    "the main difference is that @xmath135 , where one implicitely assumes that the fields @xmath136 and @xmath137 are @xmath5 . to be clear , lannes - saut s",

    "so the non - dimensionnalizing process of lannes - saut is weaker than the one done by many other authors .",

    "if we assume an initial flow of euler type ( so that @xmath148 ) , the double integral vanishes .",
    "but is it physical ? in other words , does an initial ( inviscid ) flow in the boundary layer ( where navier - stokes applies ) establish ( as a navier - stokes flow ) fast or not ?",
    "can we assume an initial euler flow and a navier - stokes evolution pde without loss of generality ?",
    "we claim that the answer is negative for at least two reasons . on the one hand ,",
    "the characteristic time for the viscous effects to appear is roughly @xmath149 or @xmath150 .",
    "then , its ratio with the characteristic time of the inviscid gravity flow ( @xmath151 ) is either re @xmath152 or @xmath153 respectively . whatever the chosen characteristic time , this ratio is large and the flow in the boundary layer does not establish fast enough .    on the other hand , as is argued in @xcite , the value of this integral for a typical exponential flow in the boundary layer can be computed .",
    "it tends to zero only like @xmath154 as is classical for navier - stokes flows . as a consequence",
    ", one may assume that it goes from zero ( euler ) to exponential ( boundary layer ) within the time ( @xmath154 ) which is large with respect to the characteristic time of the flow .",
    "starting from ( [ boussinesq_1 ] ) , one may assume the fields do not depend on @xmath1 , and @xmath155 .",
    "so the flow is purely one dimensional ( one direction ) .",
    "one may see that the zeroth order of this boussinesq system is the wave equation .",
    "then one knows that there are two waves propagating in each direction .",
    "if we look only for the waves that propagate to the right , one may make a change of variables suggested by the zeroth order equation : @xmath156 every term can easily be converted in these new coordinates appart from the convolution ( one derivative and a half integration ) , the new surface tension term and the double integral .",
    "the first was treated in a very clean way in @xcite .",
    "the second is new , but very simple .",
    "the third one was treated in @xcite , but its treatment is improved below . after a change of variable ,",
    "this term writes : @xmath157 the article @xcite argued that if the initial horizontal velocity is localized and @xmath158 not too small , then @xmath159 will be negligible in comparison with @xmath2 .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath160 tends to zero when @xmath161 tends to @xmath162 at least as @xmath163 .",
    "then the term ( [ kdv.1 ] ) is at least @xmath4 .",
    "one may add one more argument if @xmath158 is still not too small .",
    "the upper bound of the inner integral contains a @xmath54 .",
    "so mainly large @xmath164 ( larger than @xmath165 ) will be relevant .",
    "but for those @xmath164 , the @xmath159 is small uniformly in @xmath166 because of the matching condition on @xmath167 between the boundary layer and the upper part .",
    "so ( [ kdv.1 ] ) is small for two different reasons and we can state the viscous kdv equation with surface tension in the following proposition .",
    "[ prop_kdv ] if the initial flow is localized , the kdv change of variables applied to the 1d version of the system ( [ boussinesq_1 ] ) leads to @xmath168 for not too small times @xmath158 , where we set re@xmath169 .",
    "we do not replace the upper bound of the convolution ( @xmath170 ) by @xmath162 for two reasons .",
    "on the one hand we do not know how fast this integral converges when @xmath171 tends to @xmath162 . on the other hand",
    "the @xmath158 term reminds us that this integral on @xmath172 is a mixture of time and space .",

    "our choice of non - dimensionalization forces us to manage extra terms , but we get the classical kp equation with a viscous term : @xmath185 where @xmath57 satisfies ( [ kp.1])@xmath53 .",
    "this completes the proof of the following proposition .",
    "[ prop_kp ] if the initial flow is localized , in the boussinesq approximation and if @xmath186 but @xmath187 , the surface waves of a viscous fluid propagating predominantly along @xmath0 and weakly along @xmath1 satisfy the viscous kp equation : @xmath188 or the equivalent mixed system @xmath189    one must keep in mind that our choice of scale triggers the @xmath54 ( even inside the convolution ) in ( [ kp.1 ] ) .",
    "this choice is already discussed in remark [ rem_lannes_johnson ] .",
    "had we made the same choice of scale for @xmath57 as johnson @xcite and many others , we would have replaced @xmath57 by @xmath190 in ( [ kp.1 ] ) . the equivalent ( [ eq19.5 ] ) could be simplified by @xmath2 and it would write : @xmath191 and @xmath192 would satisfy ( [ kp.1])@xmath53 modified : @xmath193 oddly , this would lead to the same kp equation as ( [ kp ] ) but up to the order @xmath95 and not @xmath6 . during the proof",
    ", we exhibit the @xmath6 terms which would be @xmath95 if @xmath194 although they are not kept in the proposition .",
    "so there is no contradiction and the accuracy of kp is tied to the property that @xmath147 or not .      as is very well discussed in @xcite , the usual kp equation is often written with an operator @xmath195 .",

    "it is proved in @xcite that although it is not obvious , this assumption is right for inviscid fluids .",
    "their proof is done in two steps .    in the first step ,",
    "the linear kp equation is solved with inverse fourier transforms . for more general equations , but only dispersive , like @xmath198 ( the symbol of @xmath199 is @xmath200 for @xmath201 ) , the fundamental solution writes @xmath202,\\ ] ] where @xmath203 depends on the kpi or kpii equation ( or on the sign of @xmath204 ) . for the usual kpi and kpii , @xmath205 .",

    "the nonlinearity is treated with the duhamel formulation .",
    "the solution is then the convolution of the group of the linear equation with the nonlinear term @xmath209 and all what is already proved for the linear equation extends to the nonlinear one .",
    "one may wonder whether such an interesting result can extend to the viscous case .",
    "indeed , the proof is even simpler and the details are left to the interested reader .",
    "the fourier transform of the dissipative term writes @xmath210 by a simple change of variable , one may see that the last integral is indeed only a function of the sign of @xmath211 ( denoted @xmath212 ) times @xmath213 .",
    "this function of @xmath212 can be computed : @xmath214 and the fourier corresponding term reads : @xmath215 as a consequence , one could study the fundamental solution @xmath216.\\ ] ] the only real part ( non - dispersive ) inside the exponential is @xmath217 which sign is compatible with the dissipation and ensures convergence of all the integrals .",
    "so one do not even need to use the lebesgue dominated convergence theorem and the proof is simpler than in @xcite .",
    "the boussinesq equation is a second order equation that takes into account waves going both to the right and to the left . since the derivation is straightforward , we only sketch it , following johnson @xcite ( p. 216 - 219 ) and state the proposition [ prop_boussinesq ] .",
