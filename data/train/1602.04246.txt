    "there has been recent interest in the condensed matter physics and solid state chemistry community in constructing finite sphere packings with the maximal number of touching pairs ( also known as the maximal contact number ) , as there are applications of small cluster geometry in nucleation , gelation , glass formation pathways , minimal clusters in colloids , and many other topics in soft matter physics , chemistry , and materials science . with this motivation , in 2011 , n. arkus , v. manoharan , and m. brenner at harvard university provided various constructions of finite sphere packings with maximal contacts up to @xmath2 spheres @xcite , and in 2014 , m. holmes - cerfon at new york university provided constructions up to @xmath3 spheres @xcite which improved the lower bounds from 2013 of k. bezdek and s. reid which are derived from the octahedral construction @xcite .",
    "when @xmath4 the lower bound corresponds to a fully constructed octahedron ( see figure [ fig1 ] for @xmath5 ) and when @xmath6 the lower bound corresponds to a partially constructed octahedron .",
    "recent work by k. bezdek and m. khan @xcite in 2016 has reviewed the contact number problem for sphere packings and discussed explicit constructions for @xmath7 and the complexity of recognizing contact graphs ; furthermore , the topic of totally separable sphere packings is emphasized , as it is in @xcite .",
    "regular totally separable sphere packings were enumerated in for @xmath8 in @xcite by s. reid in 2015 , which have a chemical interpretation .",
    "[ fig1 ]        in light of this recent research interest at the interface of discrete geometry and materials science , we construct a formalism for understanding all molecular geometries that translates theorems from discrete geometry into existential bounds on the realizability and structure of chemical compounds . in particular , we provide a comprehensive theory for understanding the structure of chemical compounds with discrete geometry and abstract algebra using sphere packings and free @xmath9-modules of rank 3 .",
    "we study the case of congruent sphere packings ( which are applicable for monatomic compounds ) and leave the topic of noncongruent sphere packings ( which are applicable for polyatomic compounds ) for future research .",
    "traditionally , discrete geometry has been almost exclusively studied by pure mathematicians , with only recent notice by chemists , physicists , biologists , materials scientists , computer scientists , and other scientists . for this reason",
    ", we introduce the following definition :    a new interdisciplinary field of science that describes the structure and combinatorics of matter and information with discrete geometry .    in this paper",
    "we provide some initial remarks on applied discrete geometry through crystal chemistry , e.g. , we focus on finite congruent lattice sphere packings , rather than finite congruent sphere packings which are not based on a lattice ; these two cases correspond to monatomic crystals and amorphous monatomic compounds , respectively .",
    "the monatomic sphere packing correspondence provides a translation between an arbitrary monatomic compound @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the atomic concentration of the atom @xmath12 , and a congruent sphere packing @xmath13 which encodes the relevant structural and combinatorial information about the compound .",
    "the translation is provided by replacing atoms with spheres and replacing chemical bonds with contact points .",
    "let @xmath10 be an arbitrary monatomic compound .",
    "then there exists a congruent sphere packing @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the position of the @xmath16 atom @xmath12 with radius @xmath17 .",
    "we remark that the radius @xmath18 can be chosen to be the ionic radius of the @xmath19 ion with a particular coordination and charge , with roman numeral subscripts to denote the coordination number of that atom , e.g. , @xmath20 is the 4-coordinated radius of the @xmath21 ion .    from an arbitrary monatomic compound @xmath10",
    "there are two major cases to distinguish and treat using the monatomic sphere packing correspondence :    1 .",
    "monatomic crystals , which correspond to congruent lattice sphere packings .",
    "monatomic amorphs , which correspond to congruent non - lattice sphere packings .",
    "a three - dimensional lattice @xmath22 has a basis , say @xmath23 where @xmath24 , so that any point on the lattice @xmath22 can be written as an integer linear combination of the basis elements .",
    "then @xmath25 is a free @xmath9-module of rank 3 which is a candidate for representing the underlying structure of a monatomic crystal @xmath10 if the lattice basis is sufficiently spread out to accomodate for the size of @xmath19 ; i.e. , if @xmath26 .",
    "we now characterize the combinatorial features of the coordination structure associated with a monatomic compound @xmath10 in terms of the contact graph of the congruent sphere packing @xmath13 .",
    "the contact graph @xmath27 is defined by a vertex set @xmath28 with size @xmath29 and an edge set @xmath30 then the size @xmath31 determines the number of chemical bonds @xmath32 in the monatomic compound @xmath10 , and we can use sphere packing bounds from discrete geometry to characterize this quantity in terms of @xmath29 .    to see how",
    "the contact graph can be used to understand the coordination structure of the crystal , we use the following theorem of k. bezdek and s. reid @xcite .    [ bezdekreidtheorem ]    1 .",
    "the number of touching pairs in an arbitrary packing of @xmath33 unit balls in @xmath1 is always less than @xmath34 2 .",
    "the number of touching pairs in an arbitrary lattice packing of @xmath33 unit balls in @xmath1 is always less than @xmath35{18 \\pi}}{\\pi}n^{2/3 } = 6n - 3.665 ... n^{2/3}.\\ ] ]    we can then obtain a relevant corollary regarding the maximum number of chemical bonds in a monatomic compound , with improved bounds in the case of a monatomic crystal .",
    "[ bezdekreidcorollary ] for any atom @xmath12 , the number of chemical bonds in an amorphous @xmath10 compound is always less than @xmath36 , and the number of chemical bonds in a crystal @xmath10 compound is always less than @xmath37 .",
    "let @xmath38 be a packing of @xmath39 congruent @xmath40-spheres in @xmath41-space placed over the lattice @xmath22 , i.e. , @xmath42 .",
    "we define the maximal contact number of @xmath38 by @xmath43 in terms of this terminology we can restate theorem [ bezdekreidtheorem].2 as @xmath44{18 \\pi}}{\\pi}n^{2/3 } = 6n - 3.665 ... n^{2/3 } , \\forall n > 2.\\ ] ]        let @xmath49 and assume that @xmath45 . observe that @xmath50 is an upper bound on the necessary number of elements in every submodule @xmath51 required to construct @xmath52 with @xmath53 . for , if a submodule @xmath54 contained more than @xmath50 elements , the packing could be rearranged to decrease the number of elements of @xmath54 and increase the number of elements of a distinct submodule @xmath55 in a way which increases the contact number , contradicting that @xmath45 .",
    "we now use the above corollary to write an algorithm for obtaining the value of @xmath61 over any three - dimensional lattice @xmath22 .",
    "chemically , this algorithm tells us the maximum number of chemical bonds between any crystalline formation of @xmath39 atoms of the same size ."
