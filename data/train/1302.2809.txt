    "the general theory of curves in a euclidean space ( or more generally in a riemannian manifolds ) have been developed a long time ago and we have a deep knowledge of its local geometry as well as its global geometry . in the theory of curves in euclidean space , one of the important and interesting problem is characterizations of a regular curve . in the solution of the problem , the curvature functions @xmath12 and @xmath13 of a regular curve have an effective role .",
    "for example : if @xmath14 @xmath15 , then the curve is a geodesic or if @xmath16constant@xmath17 and @xmath18then the curve is a circle with radius @xmath19 , etc .",
    "thus we can determine the shape and size of a regular curve by using its curvatures .",
    "another way in the solution of the problem is the relationship between the frenet vectors of the curves ( see @xcite ) .",
    "for instance bertrand curves :    in 1845 , _",
    "saint venant_(see @xcite ) proposed the question whether upon the surface generated by the principal normal of a curve , a second curve can exist which has for its principal normal the principal normal of the given curve .",
    "this question was answered by _",
    "bertrand _ in 1850 in a paper(see @xcite ) in which he showed that a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of such a second curve is that a linear relationship with constant coefficients shall exist between the first and second curvatures of the given original curve .",
    "in other word , if we denote first and second curvatures of a given curve by @xmath20 and @xmath15 respectively , then for @xmath21 @xmath22 we have @xmath23 . since the time of bertrand s paper",

    "bertrand curves and their characterizations were studied by many authours in euclidean space as well as in riemann  otsuki space , in minkowski 3- space and minkowski spacetime ( for instance see @xcite ) .",
    "the quaternion was introduced by hamilton . his initial attempt to generalize the complex numbers by introducing a three - dimensional object failed in the sense that the algebra he constructed for these three - dimensional object did not have the desired properties . on the 16th october 1843 hamilton discovered that the appropriate generalization is one in which the scalar(real ) axis is left unchanged whereas the vector(imaginary ) axis is supplemented by adding two further vectors axes .",
