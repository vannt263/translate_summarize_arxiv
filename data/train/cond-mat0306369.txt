    "the hypergraph bicoloring is one of the classic combinatorial optimization problems belonging to the @xmath0-complete class @xcite .",
    "its random version , bicoloring of random hypergraphs , is a very interesting problem for the phase transitions it shows . indeed , varying the average connectivity of the random hypergraph , the model undergoes a transition @xcite from a phase in which all links can be properly colored to a phase in which a sizeble fraction of links are violated . around the transition point most difficult instances accumulate .",
    "a graph is an ensemble of sites and links between them . in a hypergraph",
    ", the links connect triplets of sites . each site ( or vertex )",
    "can be colored in two ways , say black or white , so it is natural to identify it with an ising spin variable that can assume the values 1 or @xmath1 .",
    "the link is considered to be satisfied if the three spins that share it are not all of the same color . in the following",
    "we will often refer to a link as a function node , as it is called for example in the k - sat problem @xcite .",
    "the bicoloring problem consists in finding an assignment to all spins such that all the links are satisfied .",
    "consequently a graph will be called colorable or uncolorable .",
    "we can write the hamiltonian for the problem assuming that each unsatisfied link gives a positive energy and zero otherwise .",
    "the total energy is proportional to the number of unsatisfied links : a colorable hypergraph will have a zero - energy ground state , while a non colorable one will have a positive - energy ground state .",
    "the hamiltonian for bicoloring a hypergraph @xmath2 reads [ ham ] = _ \\{i , j , k } , where @xmath3 are ising variables ( corresponding to the 2 available colors ) and the sum runs over all the hyperedges of @xmath4 . note that a factor @xmath5 has been introduces for computational convenicence  .",
    "each term in the above sum is equal to 2 if and only if all the spins in the same interaction are parallel , that is if all the vertices connected by a hyperedge have the same color . the hamiltonian in eq.([ham ] ) thus counts twice the number of badly colored hyperedges .",
    "perfect colorations correspond to zero - energy configurations .    in the present work we focus on colorability of random hypergraphs with @xmath6 vertices and @xmath7 hyperedges , varying the relevant parameter @xmath8 . in a typical random hypergraph",
    "the connectivity of a spin ( i.e. the degree of a vertex ) is a random variable distributed according to a poissonian of mean @xmath9 .",
    "analogously to random k - sat @xcite , random k - xorsat @xcite and q - coloring of random graphs @xcite , the random hypergraph bicoloring is expected to undergo two phase transitions increasing @xmath10 .",
    "the first one is called `` dynamical transition '' and is located at @xmath11 where solutions to the problem ( perfect colorations ) undergo a clustering phenomenon . at this point",
    "the complexity @xmath12 , which counts the number of clusters of solutions , becomes non - zero .",
    "we remind that if @xmath13 is the number of states at energy @xmath14 the complexity is defined by the relation @xmath15 , so it is a function of @xmath10 and of the energy density . in the region where the complexity becomes positive , on top of a great number of ground states there",
    "appear an even larger number of metastable states : the latter may trap and slow down linear - time coloring algorithms and local search randomized methods @xcite . at present all known linear - time coloring algorithms stop converging for @xmath16 values well below @xmath17 .",
    "the second transition takes place at @xmath18 , where the ground - state energy becomes positive : for @xmath19 most of the hypergraphs are colorable , while for @xmath20 most of them are not .",
    "this transition is formally equivalent to the so called sat / unsat transition of k - sat @xcite and k - xorsat @xcite , and we will refer to it with this name , although it is also known as `` col / uncol '' transition in the computer science literature .",
    "known results on the sat / unsat transition are only upper and lower bounds .",
    "the best upper bound for @xmath18 , found with rigorous calculation , is 2.409 @xcite .",
    "the best lower bound is 3/2 @xcite . in ref.@xcite",
    "it is analyzed the more general problem of bicoloring random hypergraphs with @xmath21-spin hyperlinks .",
    "however for the @xmath22 case the bounds are worse than the ones we mentioned above .",
    "recent rigorous results on random spin models and random k - sat ( k even ) @xcite have shown that the 1rsb results provide rigorous upper bounds to the phase transition point and we expect the same to be true in our case .",

    "for example the @xmath59 value for the present bicoloring model is twice the value it takes in the 3-spin model @xcite .",

    "@xmath61 the rs solution is therefore non - physical , because the energy density of this problem must be positive by definition . in the rs approximation",
    "we have found a paramagnetic phase for @xmath62 and a glassy phase for @xmath63 .",
    "this prediction is not correct , both quantitatively and qualitatively .",
    "the values of @xmath10 where the transitions appear are not in agreement with numerical simulations , and there is a non - physical region .      before going to the 1rsb approximation ,",
    "let us concentrate in this section on the rs paramagnetic region @xmath62 , in order to analyze the distribution of the so - called _ evanescent fields _ @xcite . in the paramagnetic phase at zero temperature all the cavity fields @xmath64 are null , but considering the first order correction in temperature one can write @xmath65 ( whence the adjective evanescent ) .    in terms of expectation values of spin variables ,",
    "an evanescent field is the only one that can give a finite magnetization in the zero temperature limit : @xmath66 . on the contrary , in the ` strictly'-zero - temperature formalism that we use to study ground state energy , variables",
    "are either frozen , @xmath67 , or paramagnetic , @xmath68 , and we disregard any detailed information concerning the fluctuations of the local magnetizations of the unfrozen variables .",
    "the global probability distribution of the local magnetizations could in principle be non trivial , with some variable polarized ( yet never frozen ) in some preferential direction .",
    "there are two equivalent ways of obtaining such information on the distribution of magnetizations : the first consists in writing the iterative cavity equations for such magnetizations and next taking the average over the underlying random hyper - graph .",
    "the second simply consists in computing the rs cavity equations at finite temperature assuming appropriate scaling of the cavity fields .",
    "taking @xmath69 with @xmath70 finite leads , in the @xmath71 limit , to a distribution of evanescent fields which may describe non trivial expectations for the spins .",
    "following the same steps which brought us to the rs self - consistency equations ( [ eqrs ] ) , we can write analogously the self - consistency equations for the distributions of @xmath72 and @xmath73 in the @xmath74 limit .",
    "these equations look identical those in eq.([eqrs ] ) , the only difference being the definition of the function @xmath75 , which now reads @xmath76    for very low @xmath16 the only solution to the self - consistency equations is @xmath77 . at variance with respect to other problems like for instance 3-sat @xcite",
    "in which the low @xmath16 phase is highly non trivial , the bicoloring problem is simple .",
    "as it happens in the q - coloring @xcite and in the 3-spin problems @xcite , the very low @xmath16 phase is a genuine paramagnet , with local fields concentrated around zero even at the first order in temperature .",
    "however the solution @xmath78 and @xmath79 may become unstable at a certain value of @xmath10 , that we call @xmath80 . in order to study the stability of this solution ( in which local fields are uncorrelated independently of the local strucutre of the underlying hypergraph ) it is enough to give an infinitesimal width to @xmath81 and check whether it increases or decreases under the iteration of eq.([eqrs ] ) .",
    "for very small values of @xmath70 one can linearize the function @xmath82 and obtain very simple relations among the variances of @xmath81 and @xmath83 at two consecutive iterations ( @xmath84 and @xmath85 ) @xmath86    for @xmath87 the variances do not increase under iteration of the rs equations and the system is in a truly paramagnetic phase with all the magnetization identically zero .    for @xmath88",
    ", the presence of a broad distribution of first - order corrections @xmath89 suggests the presence of a full rsb spin - glass phase at finite temperature , produced by a `` replicon '' instability at @xmath80 .",
    "the finite - temperature phase transition at @xmath80 corresponds at @xmath90 to the onset of a non trivial organization of ground states , with non trivial magnetizations ( unfrozen rsb scenario ) .",
    "we incidentally note that the value of @xmath80 coincides with the best lower bound available for @xmath18 .",
    "however , as soon as the dynamical transition is reached at @xmath91 ( see next section ) , the system looses memory of the unfrozen rsb phase .",
    "the non - evanescent fields , @xmath92 , are the only ones relevant in determining the ground state energy . at the level of non vanishing fields , at @xmath17 we have a transition from rs to 1rsb . at this point , the analytically disconnected solution with vanishing fields disappears .",
    "the presence of full rsb is somehow accidental and we expect for higher number of colors to disappear completely ( as it happens in graph coloring @xcite ) .",
    "in the previous section we have seen that the rs approximations produces a wrong solution . here",
    "we study the system with a better approximation , the so - called `` one step replica symmetry breaking '' .    in this approximation",
    "the scenario is a bit more complex : at @xmath11 ( @xmath94 ) there is a clustering phenomenon so that the computation made in the rs case is only valid within each state ( cluster ) .",
    "it must be also considered the crossing between the energy of two states , for which we use the `` reweighting parameter '' @xmath95 as in @xcite .",

    "once decimation has started , the bicoloring problems becomes a mixture of graph and hypergraph bicoloring .",
    "the behavior of the algorithm on sufficiently large ( @xmath195 ) random bicoloring instances is the following :    * for low @xmath16 ( @xmath196 ) , the variables turn out to be all paramagnetic ( zero bias ) . * in the dynamical region the biases are non - trivial and the decimation procedure fixes many variables leading to sub - problems which are paramagnetic and easily solved by a greedy heuristic . very close to @xmath171",
    "the decimation procedure may fail in finding solutions in the first run . in this region",
    "the algorithm can be improved in many ways , e.g.  by a random restart or a backtrack or a different decimation strategy . in any case",
    "we can not exclude the existence of a threshold close to @xmath171 where the decimation procedure stops converging .    for small @xmath6 the structural `` rare events '' of the random hyper - graph , like links sharing more than one variable or other types of short loops , require an appropriate ( in principle simple ) modification of the sp iterations @xcite .",
    "more in general , the presence of loops of different length scales may introduce correlations which may require further non - trivial generalization of the whole sp procedure .",
    "in this work we have given a very detailed description of the random hypergraph bicoloring problem , both on the average - case and on single samples .",
    "* for @xmath197 the model is in a genuine paramagnetic phase , all the magnetizations are identically null ; * at @xmath198 a `` replicon '' instability takes place , which manifests at finite temperature with the onset of spin - glass order ( full rsb ) ; * for @xmath199 the presence of a full rsb phase at finite temperatures is reflected in the ground states by finite values for the spin magnetizations ; * at @xmath200 a clustering transition takes place among the ground states .",
    "they split in an exponentially large number of clusters . within each cluster",
    "a finite fraction of variables is completely frozen ( backbone ) ; * for @xmath201 the model has a non - zero complexity and an exponentially large number of metastable states , which may block local - search algorithms .",
    "although the very strong correlations among variables the ground state energy is still zero and the problem is colorable on average ; * at @xmath202 the col / uncol phase transition takes place ; * for @xmath20 the ground state energy is positive and the problem can not be colored on average .    in the second part of this work we have applied the survey propagation algorithm to problem instances taken from the hard - col region ( @xmath201 ) , finding in polynomial time solutions to the problem .",
    "so we have verified that the sp algorithm works properly also for this model , which is harder than the 3-sat problem  @xcite .",
    "indeed this model , at variance with k - sat , has no local biases which could in principle be exploited by a smart algorithm .",
    "next steps in this line of research will be to consider random hard combinatorial problems endowed with some non trivial local structure of the underlying graph .",
    "this constitutes a conceptual challange that will bring the algorithmic and anlytical tools developed for sparse graphs closer to what is found in the real - world version of the same class of models@xcite ."
