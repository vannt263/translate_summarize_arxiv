    "following gai and kapadia@xcite , a _ financial crisis _ is defined as a situation in which at least 5% of banks go bankrupt .",
    "fig.1 illustrates the frequency and the conditional average of the size of crises .",
    "some interesting properties are observed .",
    "first , fig.1a reveals that the uniform immunization strategy based on pagerank is most successful in terms of reducing the frequency of crises .",
    "the least efficient one is random immunization .",
    "the reason for this is that a bank with a high pagerank score generally a ) has many interbank liabilities ( i.e. , high in - degree ) and b ) borrows from lenders that have few interbank assets ( i.e. , low out - degree ) . in this model",
    ", the fact that a bank borrows a lot means that the bank borrows from many other banks ( see methods ) .",
    "such a bank is likely to be systemically important because its failure would undermine the balance sheets of many lenders .",
    "in addition , the fact that the lenders of bank @xmath6 have few interbank assets indicates that the lenders solvency depends largely on the solvency of bank @xmath6 since the lenders portfolios of interbank assets are not so diversified .",
    "secondly , fig.1b states that the average number of banks that fail during a crisis increases as more banks become immunized .",
    "this is because a larger number of banks begin to hold a common low - risk external asset , which reduces the frequency of medium - scale simultaneous defaults ( fig.2a ) .",
    "moreover , fig.1b also shows that a crisis is likely to become more severe under the pagerank - based strategy than under the other immunization strategies .",
    "immunizing banks in the order based on pagerank efficiently increases the probability that systemically important banks will fail simultaneously , which would lead to a crisis .",
    "in other words , the pagerank - based strategy will rapidly shift the financial market toward a _ robust - yet - fragile _ system .",
    "histogram of the number of defaulted banks . * ( a ) uniform immunization based on pagerank .",
    "( b ) counteractive immunization based on edge - betweenness centrality .",
    "the figures show that i ) uniform immunization decreases the frequency of medium - scale defaults while increasing the likelihood of extremely large - scale defaults .",
    "ii ) counteractive immunization slightly reduces the frequency of medium - scale cascades while increasing the likelihood of small - scale defaults .",
    "see the caption of fig.1 for parameter values.,width=566 ]    the corresponding figures for counteractive immunization are shown in figs.1c , d .",
    "counteractive immunization introduces anti - correlations between two assets that were previously independent of each other without changing the riskiness of individual assets .",
    "in contrast to the case of uniform immunization , counteractive immunization decreases the frequency of crises while having an unambiguous influence on the average number of bank defaults at the time of a crisis .",
    "assigning negatively correlated assets to pairs of connected banks will avoid medium - scale default cascades by preventing the balance sheets of the immunized banks from moving in sync ( fig.2b ) .",
    "however , the speed at which the frequency of a crisis decreases is much slower under counteractive immunization than under the pagerank - based uniform immunization .",
    "this implies a trade - off between frequency and severity .",
    "the desirability of an immunization strategy thus depends on the extent of social risk aversion , represented by parameter @xmath0 . in the following ,",
    "we clarify how the level of systemic risk under various types of immunization strategies depends on the degree of risk aversion , @xmath0 .",
    "the relationship between the fraction of immunized banks and the expected costs . *",
    "( a)-(d ) : the case of uniform immunization .",
    "the increases in the expected costs observed in ( a ) reflect the de - diversification effect .",
    "the expected costs tend to become upward - sloping as the value of @xmath0 increases .",
    "this reflects the fact that the society is becoming more risk - averse .",
    "( e)-(h ) : the case of counteractive immunization . the outcome of uniform immunization based on a random vaccination order is also shown for comparison .",
    "the shape of the curve is little affected by the value of @xmath0 under counteractive immunization .",
    "see the caption of fig.1 for parameter values.,width=585 ]      fig.3 depicts the relationship between the fraction of immunized banks and the expected costs under four different values of @xmath0 .",
    "some important features should be noted .",
    "first , under uniform immunization , the expected costs may increase even if @xmath7 , where the expected cost is equal to the average number of defaults .",
    "an intuition into why the average number of defaults increases is that a homogenization of banks external assets effectively makes the portfolio of interbank assets less diversified .",
    "if every bank has an idiosyncratic external asset , then the holdings of multiple interbank assets contribute to portfolio diversification .",
    "however , if borrowers begin to hold the same external assets as their lenders , then the effective degree of the lenders portfolio diversification will be lowered .",
    "such an effect , what we call the _ de - diversification effect _ , may increase the average size of default cascades even when the risk of external assets is diminishing . on the other hand",
    ", asset harmonization itself also has an effect of decreasing contagious defaults .",
    "this is because asset harmonization increases the average number of banks that would fail simultaneously due to the loss of external assets only .",
    "thus , if the riskiness of the common asset is sufficiently low , then asset harmonization would reduce the expected costs .",
    "secondly , the expected costs are more likely to become upward - sloping as @xmath0 increases .",
    "this is because the degree of convexity of the cost function increases as @xmath0 goes up , reflecting the fact that the society is becoming more risk - averse . for large values of @xmath0 , the possibility of a large - scale simultaneous default turns out to be an important source of risk even though its probability of occurrence is quite low .",
    "in contrast , figs.3e - h show that counteractive immunization reduces systemic risk virtually monotonically .",
    "this is because counteractive immunization can lower the likelihood of medium - scale default cascades without causing increased asset commonality .",
    "a limitation of this strategy is that it does not change the riskiness of a single external asset itself .",
    "in fact , assigning anti - correlated assets to a pair of isolated banks can slightly lower the probability that both of the banks will survive . to demonstrate this ,",
    "suppose that the probability of default is @xmath8 for each bank and that the correlation coefficient of the asset returns is -1 .",
    "the probability that both banks will be solvent is then @xmath9 .",
    "if asset returns are independent , then the corresponding probability is given by @xmath10 . since @xmath11 @xmath12",
    ", it follows that counteractive immunization reduces the probability that both banks will survive .",
    "this is why counteractive immunization may slightly increase the expected costs in some circumstances .",
    "the frequency with which the gscc of the financial network disintegrates . *",
    "( a)-(c ) : uniform immunization .",
    "( d ) and ( e ) : counteractive immunization .",
    "restrepo et al.s method is used to judge whether the gscc is present or not.@xcite the frequency of network disintegration is correlated closely with the expected costs under @xmath13 .",
    "see the caption of fig.1 for parameter values.,width=604 ]    fig.4 depicts the frequency with which the gscc of the interbank network disintegrates due to bank defaults ( supplementary figure s1 shows the simulated percolation threshold ) .",
    "it turns out that uniform immunization tends to decrease the frequency of disintegration , but there is a region in which the likelihood of disintegration is increased .",
    "this phenomenon is observed when the de - diversification effect is most profound .",
    "under counteractive immunization , on the other hand , the frequency of disintegration decreases virtually monotonically as vaccination proceeds .",
    "this is because counteractive immunization makes it possible to reduce the frequency of medium - scale default cascades without causing the de - diversification effects ( figs.1c , d ) .",
    "we also found that the frequency of disintegration follows a trajectory of the expected costs in the case of @xmath14 .",
    "this suggests that the risk of network disintegration could be well captured by the third moment of the number of failed banks .",
    "an intuitive explanation for this coincidence is as follows .",
    "recall that the value of @xmath0 represents the degree of risk aversion , which indicates to what extent simultaneous defaults are more costly than a sequence of single defaults .",
    "if @xmath0= 1 , then there is no difference between a simultaneous default of multiple banks and a sequence of single defaults as long as the total number of defaulted banks is the same .",
    "this implies that the society puts an identical weight on various sizes of collective defaults , which means that the small - scale collective defaults that would not matter for the existence of the gscc are cared too much . when @xmath0 = 10 , on the other hand , the society is so risk averse that it cares about infrequent but extremely large - scale simultaneous defaults .",
    "the society thus undervalues the costs of the medium - scale collective defaults that would still exceed the percolation threshold .",
    "only if the value of @xmath0 is just around 3 , the society puts appropriate weights on the size of collective defaults that would be larger than the percolation threshold .",
    "the expected cost under uniform immunization relative to that under counteractive immunization . * for each immunization strategy , expected costs are minimized with respect to the fraction of immunized banks . (",
    "a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) : asset returns follow a normal distribution .",
    "( d ) , ( e ) and ( f ) : asset returns follow the t - distribution with degree of freedom 5 . unless otherwise noted , uniform immunization is based on pagerank while counteractive immunization is based on a random order .",
    "baseline parameters are : @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the optimal immunization strategy is to employ uniform immunization when @xmath0 is small and counteractive immunization when it is large .",
    "the threshold value of @xmath0 depends on model parameters.,width=585 ]    the next question is how to choose an immunization strategy .",
    "fig.5 illustrates the expected costs under uniform immunization relative to that under counteractive immunization .",
    "the relative cost depends on various aspects of the model , such as distribution of asset returns , immunization strategy , the degree of asset correlation and the riskiness of the common low - risk asset .",
    "the main results can be summarized as follows .",
    "first , it turns out that uniform immunization is more likely to be preferable as the tail of asset - return distribution becomes thicker .",
    "second , a decrease in @xmath3 will move the threshold value of @xmath0 rightward , which means that a counteractive immunization becomes less attractive .",
    "third , the degree of correlation between anti - correlated assets may have an ambiguous impacts on the efficiency of counteractive immunization .",
    "fig.5e illustrates that counteractive immunization is most attractive when @xmath15 , while this is not the case if asset returns follow a normal distribution .",
    "a general and robust result is that uniform immunization becomes more efficient than counteractive immunization when @xmath0 is sufficiently small , where the degree of social risk aversion is moderate .",
    "counteractive immunization becomes more advantageous when @xmath0 is large , where the possibility of large - scale simultaneous defaults is of great concern to the society .",
    "since systemic risk can be thought of as a fear of default contagion that might occur in financial markets , the previously proposed immunization strategies seem useful for preventing financial contagion",
    ". however , a straightforward application of the previous immunization strategies would not work if there is some possibility of serious side effects that would prevail among vaccinated individuals .    in the case of uniform immunization",
    ", there is a good possibility that a large number of banks will fail simultaneously due to the commonality of assets .",
    "we showed that counteractive immunization can be more useful than uniform immunization as long as the society has a strong aversion to such serious side effects .",
    "the highest priority for the highly risk - averse society is to avoid severe financial crises that would rarely occur , rather than a few bank failures that would occur with high probability .",
    "negatively correlated assets can become useful vaccines even if the efficacy of each vaccine is lower than that of the common vaccine that is used under uniform immunization .",
    "these results reinforce the idea that micro - prudential policies do not necessarily add up to a macro - prudential policy.@xcite from a micro point of view , it is efficient to use a common low - risk asset when immunizing banks . from a macro point of view , however , the best immunization strategy may be to prevent a large - scale contagion at the sacrifice of individual failures .",
    "the effectiveness of counteractive immunization suggests that financial networks should be _ fragile - yet - robust _ rather than _ robust - yet - fragile_.",
    "there is no wide agreement about how to calculate the level of systemic risk .",
    "there are many candidates , such as the expected number of defaulted banks , the expected economic losses that would be caused by bank failures , and the likelihood of a large - scale default.@xcite we show two intrinsically different risk measures in order to better understand what is happening in the financial network .",
    "the first one is based on the costs that would result from bank failures . following beale et al.@xcite and kobayashi@xcite , we assume that social costs take the form @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the number of failed banks . the expected cost is thus given as @xmath20 = \\sum_{n=1}^n q(n ) n^\\chi , \\ ] ] where @xmath21 ( = 1000 ) is the total number of banks in the financial market and @xmath22 is the probability function .",
    "@xmath0 can be interpreted as the degree of social risk aversion .",
    "notice that if @xmath23 , this is simply the average number of defaulted banks .",
    "if @xmath24 , however , simultaneous defaults of multiple banks become more costly than a sequence of single bank failures .",
    "another measure is the connectivity of the network . as a measure of connectivity",
    ", we use the simulated probability that the gscc of the interbank network disintegrates . in each simulation",
    ", we check whether the gscc is kept connected after removing the failed banks from the network .",
    "we use the method proposed by restrepo et al.@xcite , who showed that the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix becomes smaller than 1 if the gscc is absent as long as the network has locally treelike structure .    in both of the risk measures ,",
    "the size of failed banks is not explicitly taken into account .",
    "however , this does not necessarily mean that systemic importance is the same across banks .",
    "the extent of infectivity generally varies from bank to bank , depending not only on the amount of borrowings ( i.e. , in - degree ) , but also on the topological location in the network and the whole network structure.@xcite systemic importance of individual banks will differ if their infectivity differs even when their balance - sheet sizes are the same .",
    "the systemic risk measures used in this study allow us to treat the systemic importance of each bank in an agnostic manner .",
    "interbank markets are directed networks .",
    "many studies show that the degree distribution of an interbank network follows a power law.@xcite in the present study , the algorithm that generates an interbank network follows from chung et al.@xcite .",
    "their algorithm is also used by restrepo et al.@xcite .",
    "let @xmath25 and @xmath26 denote the in - degree and out - degree of a bank , respectively .",
    "the in - degree of bank @xmath6 represents the number of banks from which bank @xmath6 borrows funds . the degree distribution derived by chung",
    "et al.s algorithm takes the form @xmath27 we assume that there is no degree - degree correlation .",
    "chung et al.s algorithm proceeds as follows .",

    "ii ) the out - degree distribution is obtained as a random permutation of the sequence of @xmath34 .",
    "iii ) nodes @xmath35 and @xmath36 are linked with probability @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the average in- or out - degree given by the researcher .",
    "iv ) by using the condition that the total number of edges is equal to @xmath39 , it can be shown that @xmath40dn^{1/(\\beta -1)}$ ] and @xmath41^{\\beta -1}$ ] for a sufficiently large @xmath21 , where @xmath42 denotes the maximum in - degree given by @xmath43 .",
    "@xmath42 and @xmath38 must be determined in such a way that the probability of placing an edge is less than 1 .",
    "the parameter values follow from restrepo et al.@xcite ( except for @xmath42 ) : @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 . to eliminate the possibility that differences in the obtained results might be due to differences in the network structure , we use one particular network structure in all simulations .      prior to immunization ,",
    "the asset side of bank @xmath6 s balance sheet consists of interbank assets , @xmath47 , a riskless asset , @xmath48 , and a risky external asset , @xmath49 , where @xmath50 for @xmath51 the liability side of bank @xmath6 s balance sheet consists of interbank liability , @xmath52 , deposits , @xmath53 , and net worth , @xmath54 .",
    "the balance sheet condition implies that @xmath55 = @xmath56 , @xmath57 . the amount of bank @xmath6 s borrowings from bank @xmath58 is expressed as @xmath59 , where @xmath60 denotes the relative weight of bank @xmath6 s borrowings from @xmath58 , and thereby @xmath61 .",
    "the amount of bank @xmath6 s total interbank assets , @xmath62 , is given by @xmath63    bank @xmath6 will default if @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 stand for the ex - post values of external assets and interbank liabilities , respectively . it should be pointed out that deposits , @xmath53 , are reserved because deposits are senior to interbank assets .",
    "provided that there is no loss in the interbank assets , those banks that hold a common low - risk asset will fail with probability @xmath3 while the others will default with probability @xmath1 .",
    "following beale et al.,@xcite asset returns are assumed to follow students t - distribution with degree of freedom @xmath67 for the low - risk asset and @xmath68 for the other external assets .",
    "for those banks with out - degree 1 , the size of net worth , @xmath69 , is determined such that @xmath70 or @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the cdf of student - t distribution with degree of freedom @xmath68 .",
    "the unit size of the interbank asset , @xmath73 , is given as @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the predetermined ratio of interbank assets to net worth .",
    "more generally , the amount of net worth is determined as @xmath76 for @xmath77 .",
    "given @xmath69 , @xmath67 is obtained by solving a nonlinear problem , @xmath78 . in the case where asset returns follow normal distributions ( i.e. , @xmath79 ) , their variances",
    "are directly adjusted according to the probability of default , taking as given the size of net worth .    given the unit size of interbank lending , the sizes of interbank assets and liabilities , @xmath62 and @xmath80 , are given by the structure of the interbank network . to ensure that the probability of fundamental defaults , i.e. , defaults due to the loss of external assets only , is common across banks , the size of external assets relative to the net worth , @xmath81 ,",
    "if bank @xmath6 has so many incoming edges that its liability side would be bigger than the sum of interbank assets and external assets , then riskless asset , @xmath48 , is imposed to adjust the asset side .",
    "otherwise , deposits , @xmath53 , is imposed to adjust the liability side .",
    "the parameter values are as follows : @xmath82 , @xmath16 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "we use three alternative values of @xmath3 : @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath4 .",
    "the ratio of interbank assets to capital is roughly consistent with the data shown by upper.@xcite these parameters indicate that the ratio of capital to total risky assets is .1 for those banks that have a positive amount of interbank assets and @xmath87 for the other banks . solving the above - mentioned nonlinear problem yields @xmath88 for @xmath89 , 15.687 for @xmath17 , and 47.296 for @xmath90 .",
    "random asset returns are generated @xmath91 times for each case .",
    "if bank @xmath6 failed , then bank @xmath6s creditors lose @xmath92 of their credits extended to bank @xmath6",
    ". some of these creditors may fail due to the loss of their interbank assets .",
    "accordingly , the creditors of the creditors of bank @xmath6 may fail as well , because they lose @xmath92 of their credits extended to the failed banks .",
    "the spread of contagious defaults stops if it turns out that no more banks are going to fail due to the loss of interbank assets . following the literature ,",

    "the parameter values are @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "when two or more nodes have a tie score , we randomize the order among them .    under counteractive immunization , we pick up a pair of banks sequentially . in the case of the edge - betweenness - based strategy ,",
    "we first select a pair of banks whose edge spanned between the two banks takes the highest value in terms of the edge - betweenness measure.@xcite we remove the edges coming from and going to the selected nodes , as well as the selected nodes themselves . in the following step , edge - betweenness centrality is recalculated , and then the new highest - ranked edge is selected .",
