    "the dynamics of the pendulum or systems containing the pendulum is probably one of the oldest scientific topics .",

    "miles @xcite shows that for the pendulum the route to chaos leads through symmetry breaking pitchfork bifurcation and cascades of period doubling bifurcations .",
    "comprehensive analytical investigation of the pendulum with different forcing was presented by bryant and miles @xcite . in the forced system",
    "one can consider two main parameters : the amplitude and the frequency of excitation .",
    "such a bifurcation diagram for parametrically forced pendulum with horizontally moving point of the suspension was presented by bishop and clifford for periodic oscillations ( po ) @xcite and for periodic rotations ( pr ) @xcite . in @xcite bifurcation analysis",
    "was extended to elliptic movement of suspension point both for po and pr .",
    "the analytical investigation of oscillating and rotating motions of pendulum was done using averaging , small parameter , harmonic balance , and other methods@xcite .",
    "this analysis allows understanding of the pendulum dynamics in the neighbourhood of the locked periodic solutions .",
    "the interesting effect can be observed when the symmetry of the pendulum is broken , i.e. , the imperfection term is added to the potential function @xcite .",
    "in such an asymmetric system the symmetry breaking pitchfork bifurcation disappears and the sudden decrease of the amplitude of the po at the first period doubling bifurcation can be regarded as a precursor of an escape or problems with system s behaviour .    the crucial point in modelling of such systems is a good approximation of damping coefficients ( viscous and frictional damping ) .",
    "there are well known methods for linear @xcite systems but as far as the pendulum is oscillating with large amplitude , the linear approximation does not give sufficient results .",
    "this problem has been solved by xu et al .",
    "they show an efficient method to extract the damping coefficients ( viscous damping and dry friction ) from time series of freely oscillating pendulum and consider the influence of the shaker ( the source of the forcing ) .",
    "most previous works on the dynamics of the pendulum suspended on the forced oscillator consider the linear oscillators . such a system can be considered as a modification of the classical tuned mass absorber @xcite .",
    "early works @xcite give approximate results by the method of harmonic balance in the primary parametric instability zone , which allows calculation of the separate regions of stable and unstable harmonic solutions .",

    "the recent work ikeda proposed the usage of two pendulums mounted in the same pivot as a tuned mass absorber @xcite .",
    "his experimental results show good agreement with the numerical simulations and his model can be considered as a good alternative to one pendulum on the pivot in the design of tuned mass absorbers .",
    "a good understanding of dynamics of tuned mass absorber with linear base system gives possibility to extend investigation to systems with non  linear base .",
    "linearity in considered class of systems is usually introduced by changing the linear spring into non ",
    "linear one @xcite or magnetorheological damper @xcite . in a few papers on this topic",
    "one can find an analytical study of the dynamics of duffing  pendulum systems around principal and secondary resonances @xcite .",
    "the main conclusion coming from the above mentioned papers is that non - linear spring in the base system causes enlargement of parameters range where pendulum can be used as a tune mass absorber .    in this paper",
    "we consider the pendulum suspended on the forced non  linear duffing oscillator .",

    "usually the chaotic solution dominates the whole phase space and the coexisting attractors have small basins of attraction , and such a situation is also observed in the investigated system ( [ eq : row bez ] ) . in the last fig .",
    "[ fig : basin - of - attraction](f ) we show a case where we do not observe fractal basins of attraction . most of the phase space is dominated by period two symmetric po , only in small range one can see basins of symmetric pair of @xmath62 pr .",
    "generally , in area where @xmath92 pr exists its basin of attraction dominate in phase space .",
    "the @xmath74 resonance could be observed for all pairs of parameters used in fig .",
    "[ fig : basin - of - attraction](a - d ) .",
    "nevertheless , we see this attractor only in fig .",
    "[ fig : basin - of - attraction](c ) , where different initial conditions of duffing are used .",
    "this is the evidence that not only sensitivity on initial state is observed for pendulum but also for duffing .",
    "varying initial condition of duffing moves cross - section of the phase space and changes the set of accessible attractors .",
    "almost all basins of attraction have a fractal structure , so reaching the given solution is strongly dependent on initial conditions . from the practical point of view",
    "it is important to know the area with a small number or even one solution @xcite . in such ranges",
    "one can be sure that the system approaches the expected solution . in fig .",
    "[ fig : two - paramters_colour ] we marked the areas with different types of attractors : black colour indicates one attractor ( four locked po , excluding @xmath74 resonance , between two branching bifurcation lines on the left and right side - the edges of the resonance tongues ) , grey colour refers to two coexisting solutions ( the same as for black but with coexisting steady state of the pendulum ) . in the hatched area",
    "we observe the coexistence of pr ( two symmetric pairs of @xmath62 or @xmath90 or @xmath92 pr ) and the steady state of the pendulum .",
    "the largest area with one attractor is a tongue of @xmath70 resonance .",
    "for other resonances ( @xmath62 , @xmath76 , @xmath75 , @xmath73 ) these areas are small .",
    "especially , it is surprising for @xmath62 where the resonance tongue is large in the parameter space but only near its edge we do not find the second attractor .",
    "we do not mark the areas where only duffing system is oscillating and pendulum is stable equilibrium position . in this case",
    "the dynamics of the system is reduced to the oscillations of mass @xmath145 .     with po and pr .",
    "black colour indicates one attractor ( for locked po , excluding @xmath74 resonance , between period doubling bifurcation lines on the left and right side - edges of the resonance tongues ) , grey colour shows two coexisting attractors ( the same as for black but with coexisting stable steady state of the pendulum ) . in the hatched area",
    "we observe the coexistence of stable rotations ( three areas with : pairs of symmetric @xmath62 or @xmath90 or @xmath92 pr ) and stable steady state of the pendulum.[fig : two - paramters_colour ] ]",
    "we present a comprehensive numerical analysis of the forced duffing oscillator with the suspended pendulum .",
    "we show two dimensional bifurcation diagrams with the most representative periodic solutions and demonstrate the bifurcation route to the locked resonances .",
    "the linear resonance of both subsystems is observed for @xmath52 and around this value we find complex dynamics with many coexisting attractors , not only periodic but also quasiperiodic and chaotic ones . in the principal resonance zone the pendulum oscillations decrease the oscillation amplitude of the duffing oscillator",
    "so we observe an energy transfer from the duffing oscillator to the pendulum .",
    "these properties are observed only for @xmath62 oscillatory resonance , for other locked solutions ( oscillations or rotations ) the pendulum oscillations increase the oscillations amplitude of the duffing oscillator ( the control and the possible decrease of the amplitude for other resonances will be considered in future work ) .",
    "contrary to complex dynamics around @xmath62 principal resonance in the neighbourhood of @xmath70 parametric resonance , we find two large ranges in parameters space with only one attractor ( @xmath70 locked oscillations ) and symmetric pair of @xmath62 rotations respectively . from the practical point of view ( certainty of reaching the desired attractor )",
    "such a situation is very useful and rare in non  linear system .",
    "we also compare the influence of non - linearity of spring on the amplitude of oscillations for principal @xmath62 resonance , strong non - linearity ( hardening or softening ) causes lower amplitude of oscillations . for @xmath70 parametric resonance",
    "only the decrease of @xmath121 into the softening direction causes the decrease of the oscillations amplitude . the existence of fractal basins of attraction is not surprising for non  linear systems with the attached pendulum .",
    "hence , we can consider only the probability of reaching the chosen attractor and never have a certainty where the dynamics of systems evolves .",
    "this is crucial when the pendulum is working as a tune mass absorber so we show the areas with a low number of coexisting solutions in the parameters space .",
