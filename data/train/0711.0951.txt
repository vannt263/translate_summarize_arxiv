    "in many image analysis applications an object  @xmath5 defined on the 2d - euclidean motion group @xmath6 is constructed from a 2d - grey - value image @xmath7 .",

    "<S> we provide the explicit solutions of linear , left - invariant , ( convection)-diffusion equations and the corresponding resolvent equations on the 2d - euclidean motion group @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> these diffusion equations are forward kolmogorov equations for well - known stochastic processes for contour enhancement and contour completion . </S>",
    "<S> the solutions are given by group - convolution with the corresponding green s functions which we derive in explicit form . </S>",
    "<S> we have solved the kolmogorov equations for stochastic processes on contour _ completion _ , in earlier work @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> here we mainly focus on the forward kolmogorov equations for contour _ enhancement _ processes which , in contrast to the kolmogorov equations for contour completion , do not include convection . the green s functions of these left - invariant partial differential equations coincide with the heat - kernels on @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , our exact formulae do not seem to appear in literature . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , by approximating the left - invariant basis of the generators on @xmath1 by left - invariant generators of a heisenberg - type group , we derive approximations of the green s functions .    </S>",
    "<S> the green s functions are used in so - called completion distributions on @xmath1 which are the product of a forward resolvent evolved from a source distribution on @xmath1 and a backward resolvent evolution evolved from a sink distribution on @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> such completion distributions on @xmath1 represent the probability density that a random walker from a forward proces collides with a random walker from a backward process . </S>",
    "<S> on the one hand , the modes of mumford s direction process ( for contour completion ) coincides with elastica curves minimizing @xmath2 , and they are closely related to zero - crossings of two left - invariant derivatives of the completion distribution . on the other hand , the completion measure for the contour enhancement proposed by citti and sarti , @xcite concentrates on the geodesics minimizing @xmath3 if the expected life time @xmath4 of a random walker in @xmath1 tends to zero .    </S>",
    "<S> this motivates a comparison between the geodesics and elastica . for reasonable parameter settings they turn out to be quite similar </S>",
    "<S> however , we apply the results by bryant and griffiths@xcite on marsden - weinstein reduction on euler - lagrange equations associated to the elastica functional , to the case of the geodesic functional . </S>",
    "<S> this yields rather simple practical analytic solutions for the geodesics , which in contrast to the formula for the elastica , do not involve special functions .    the theory is directly motivated by several medical image analysis applications where enhancement of elongated structures , such as catheters and bloodvessels , in noisy medical image data is required . within this article </S>",
    "<S> we show how the left - invariant evolution processes can be used for automated contour enhancement / completion using a so - called orientation score , which is obtained from a grey - value image by means of a special type of unitary wavelet transformation . here </S>",
    "<S> the ( invertible ) orientation score serves as both the source and sink - distribution in the completion distribution .    </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we also consider _ non - linear adaptive evolution equations _ on orientation scores . </S>",
    "<S> these non - linear evolution equations are practical improvements of the celebrated standard `` coherence enhancing diffusion''-schemes on images as _ they can cope with crossing contours_. here we employ differential geometry on @xmath1 to include curvature in our non - linear diffusion scheme on orientation scores . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we use the same differential geometry for a morphology theory on orientation scores yielding automated erosion towards geodesics / elastica . </S>"
