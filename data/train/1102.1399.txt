    "experimental progress in the trapping and manipulation of ultracold fermi gases has led to new regimes of study of superfluid two component fermi systems .",
    "this is thanks to the unprecedented control over the microscopic properties of many - body systems which ultracold fermi gases offer .",
    "examples of this microscopic control include the modification of the interaction strength via feshbach resonances @xcite , the tuning of the density imbalance of spin up and spin down particles @xcite and the ability to impose controllable lattice potentials using optical lattices @xcite . in particular the tunability of the interaction strength has allowed interesting investigations of the continuous crossover from a bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) type superfluid , analogous to the bcs state in a superconductor , to a bose einstein condensate ( bec ) of molecules consisting of bound spin up and spin down pairs @xcite .    experiments on ultracold atomic fermi gases allow studies of a variety of physical properties of a fundamental interest .",
    "past work has studied the pairing gap as a function of the temperature and the interaction strength @xcite , the transition from superfluid to normal behaviour by studying collective modes @xcite and the formation of vortices in rotating ultracold fermi gases @xcite .",
    "light - induced gauge potentials@xcite offer the possibility to study new aspects of the response of superfluid fermi system .",
    "this is the issue that we explore in this paper . as we describe below",
    ", light - induced vector potentials offer the opportunity to study diverse properties of ultracold fermi gases , ranging from the superfluid density to properties of the pairs .",
    "these different quantities become experimentally accessible by varying the time dependence of the light induced vector potential and by considering either the response to a vector potential which couples equally ( spin - symmetric ) or in the opposite way ( spin - asymmetric ) to the two spin species .",
    "specifically , we decompose the vector potentials @xmath0 for the two spin species into a symmetric component @xmath1 and an asymmetric component @xmath2 .",
    "we study the response of a two - component fermi gas , working in the bcs limit , separately to the spin - symmetric @xmath3 and spin - asymmetric @xmath4 vector potentials .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : effect - spin - symm ] we describe how the spin - symmetric vector potential @xmath3 leads to a superfluid response . in sec .",
    "[ sec : effect - spin - asymm ] we describe the response to a spin - asymmetric vector potential @xmath5 in the zero temperature limit , exploring the frequency dependence in detail .",
    "the effects of non - zero temperature are described in sec .",
    "[ sec : effects - non - zero ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : exper - cons_vec_pot ] we explain how the effects we predict can be studied in experiment .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] summarizes our main results .",
    "as discussed in @xcite for the bosonic system , the response of a one component bose gas to a vector potential is determined by the superfluid density of the bose gas .",
    "the light - induced vector potential leads to a kinetic energy of the form @xmath6 , which has its minimum shifted to @xmath7 .",
    "the normal fluid component will seek the new minimum of the dispersion and thus come to rest at the new equilibrium .",
    "the superfluid component on the other hand is unaffected by the shifting of the minimum in the dispersion and will continue its initial state which now no longer is the equilibrium state .",
    "the phenomenology of a two component fermi gas subjected to a spin - symmetric vector potential is the same as that of a one component bose gas subjected to a vector potential . for",
    "then the two components of the superfluid are affected equally by the vector potential and for the entire system there is a new steady state . as in the bose case ,",
    "only the normal part of the superfluid will come to rest in the new steady state .",
    "the superfluid component will not relax to this new equilibrium state , but continue in its metastable state , thereby allowing one to distinguish between normal and superfluid densities .",
    "as in the bose case , the low - frequency response to @xmath8 is simply determined by the superfluid density of the fermi gas , with a mean fermion number current density @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the superfluid density , defined such that its maximum value is equal to the number density of fermions . we will therefore concentrate on the response to @xmath4 .",
    "as we shall show , in some regimes the response to @xmath4 vanishes , under which conditions the response can be determined from the response to @xmath8 alone and is a measure of the superfluid density @xmath10 .",
    "we consider the bcs hamiltonian for a system of spin @xmath11 fermions with vector potentials @xmath12 and @xmath13 coupling to the spin up and down particles respectively .",

    "we will be considering attractive interactions , so @xmath22 .",

    "we have introduced an effective potential @xmath37 to regularise the divergent nature of the contact interaction @xcite .",
    "this shows that for @xmath38 the ground state properties are indeed independent of @xmath39 .",
    "this is to be contrasted with the result for @xmath40 . in that case",
    "the ground state of the system is a state in which the phase of the gap is spatially varying .",
    "this can be seen from equation  ( [ delta_a_in_terms - of_a ] ) .",
    "if we insert @xmath41 into equation  ( [ delta_a_in_terms - of_a ] ) we obtain @xmath42 showing that the phase of the gap is @xmath43 and therefore spatially varying for nonzero @xmath44 .",
    "although the gap is spatially varying in the groundstate , the _ gauge - invariant _ supercurrent density remains zero .",
    "the density also remains unchanged , as can be seen from equation  ( [ rho_a_in_terms - of_rho ] ) .",
    "given that the application of a static vector potential @xmath39 with @xmath23 does not have an effect on the ground state of the system we consider a time - dependent vector potential @xmath39 . in the analogous electromagnetic system",
    "@xmath45 corresponds to the presence of an electric field @xcite .",

    "we thus find that the low - frequency response is consistent with the result in section  [ sec : effect - static - vector ] , namely that a static vector potential acting in the opposite way on the two spin species has no effect on the ground state of the system .",
    "the low - frequency response of the system can be understood in terms of currents arising from the time - varying polarisation of the cooper pairs in the fermi gas . a time dependent vector potential @xmath39 gives rise to an effective electric field @xmath111 via @xmath112 .",
    "since we are considering @xmath46 this gives rise to an electric field which couples differently to the spin up and spin down particles , such that we obtain @xmath113 in the absence of such an effective electric field the s - wave cooper pairs which make up the superfluid are spherically symmetric .",

    "this leads to a polarisation of the cooper pairs just like the application of an electric field to a hydrogen atom induces a dipole moment and hence a polarisation in the hydrogen atom . a time - dependent polarisation results in a current which is given by @xcite @xmath114 combining equation  ( [ e_as_time_deriv_of_a ] ) and equation  ( [ j_as_time_deriv_of_polarisation ] ) we obtain the polarisation @xmath115 which implies that @xmath116 is the polarisability @xmath117 .",

    "the polarisability describes how easily the particles in the spherically symmetric s - wave cooper pairs can be displaced with respect to each other .",
    "a larger gap @xmath51 means that the cooper pairs are more tightly bound and the system has a reduced polarisability .",
    "note that the polarisability we describe here is very different from the one described in ref . .",
    "in this paper the polarisability we are considering is the dynamic polarisability arising from the individual cooper pairs in the absence of pair breaking effects . in ref . on the other hand the static polarisation of an atomic fermi gas cloud",
