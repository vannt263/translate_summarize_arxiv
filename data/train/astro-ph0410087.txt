    "conventional astronomy spans about 18 decades in photon wavelengths , from @xmath0  cm radio - waves to @xmath1  cm @xmath2-rays of gev energy . because the universe is opaque to photons of tev energy and above ( see fig .",
    "[ gamf ] )  @xcite , present studies focus on hadrons , neutrinos , and gravitational waves as messengers probing the high energy universe .",
    "the best candidates to serve as messengers in a new astronomy of the high energy behavior of distant sources are neutral particles .",
    "this is because the orbit of a charged cosmic ray can be substantially bent , both by extragalactic magnetic fields  @xcite and by the ambient magnetic field of our own galaxy  @xcite ; destroying the possibility of locating the source .",
    "the most promising messenger is the neutrino : it can be copiously produced in cosmic beam dumps and can traverse unscathed dense astrophysical environments . in this talk",
    "i delineate the prospects to identify high energy neutrino emitters .",

    "for primary energy @xmath3  gev , the observed cosmic ray intensity can be described by a series of power laws with the flux falling about 3 orders of magnitude for each decade increase in energy  @xcite . in recent years , a somewhat confused picture _ vis    vis _ the energy spectrum and arrival direction distribution has been emerging . since 1998 ,",
    "the agasa collaboration has consistently reported  @xcite a continuation of the spectrum beyond the expected greisen  zatsepin ",
    "kuzmin ( gzk ) cutoff  @xcite , which should arise at about @xmath4  gev if cosmic ray sources are at cosmological distances .",
    "this theoretical feature of the spectrum is mainly a consequence of interactions of the primary cosmic ray with the microwave background radiation .",
    "in contrast , the most recent results from hires  @xcite describe a spectrum which is consistent with the expected gzk feature .",
    "the discrepancy between the 2 estimated fluxes is shown in fig .",
    "[ gamf ] ( for comparison , the intensity as seen by the fly s eye  @xcite , the haverah park  @xcite and the sugar  @xcite experiments is also shown ) .",
    "this situation is suggestive of the challenge posed by systematic errors in these types of measurements . further confusing the issue , the agasa collaboration reports observations of event clusters which have a chance probability smaller than 1% to arise from a random distribution  @xcite , whereas the recent analysis reported by the hires collaboration showed that their data are consistent with no clustering among the highest energy events  @xcite . in my opinion , it is _ very important _ to rigorously define the corresponding budget of statistical significance and search criteria _ prior _ to studying the data , since defining them _ a posteriori _ may inadvertently introduce an indetermimant number of `` trials '' and thus make it impossible to assign the correct statistical significance to the search result . in this direction , with the aim of avoiding accidental bias on the number of trials performed in selecting the angular bin , the original claim of the agasa collaboration was re - examined considering only those events observed after the original claim  @xcite .",
    "this study showed that the evidence for clustering in the agasa data set is weaker than was previously supposed , and is consistent with the hypothesis of isotropically distributed arrival directions .",
    "the confusing experimental situation regarding the gzk feature should be resolved in the near future by the pierre auger observatory  @xcite , which will provide not only a data set of unprecedented size , but also the machinery for controlling some of the more problematic systematic uncertainties .    with the controversy over the gzk cutoff , one",
    "may have missed the fact that below @xmath5  gev agasa has revealed a correlation of the arrival direction of the cosmic rays to the galactic plane ( gp ) at the @xmath6 level  @xcite .",
    "the gp excess , which is roughly 4% of the diffuse flux , is mostly concentrated in the direction of the cygnus region , with a second spot towards the galactic center ( gc ) .",
    "the anisotropy signal spans a narrow energy window , from @xmath7  gev to @xmath8  gev .",
    "evidence at the 3.2@xmath9 level for gp enhancement in a similar energy range has also been reported by the fly s eye collaboration  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the full fly s eye data include a directional signal from the cygnus region which was somewhat lost in an unsuccessful attempt to relate it to @xmath2ray emission from cygnus x3  @xcite .",
    "additionally , a 3.4@xmath9 excess from an extended region surrounding cygnus x-3 has been reported by the yakutsk collaboration  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the existence of a point - like excess in the direction of the gc has been confirmed via independent analysis  @xcite of data collected with the sugar facility .",
    "this is a remarkable level of agreement among experiment using a variety of techniques .",
    "independent evidence may be emerging for a cosmic accelerator in the cygnus spiral arm . the hegra experiment has detected an extended tev @xmath2-ray source in the cygnus region with no clear counterpart and a spectrum , @xmath10 not easily accommodated with synchrotron radiation by electrons  @xcite . especially intriguing is the possible association of this source with cygnus - ob2 , a cluster of more than 2700 ( identified ) young , hot stars with a total mass of @xmath11 solar masses  @xcite .",
    "proton acceleration to explain the tev photon signal requires only 0.1% efficiency for the conversion of the energy in the stellar wind into cosmic ray acceleration .",
    "also , the stars in cygnus - ob2 could be the origin of time - correlated , clustered supernova remnants forming a source of cosmic ray nuclei .",
    "_ an immediate consequence of this picture is the creation of free neutrons via nuclei photodisintegration on background photon fields . _",
    "these liberated neutrons are presumably responsible for the observed directional signals .",
    "_ this implies that it may not be a coincidence that the signal appears first at energies where the neutron lifetime allows propagation distances of galactic scales , i.e. , 10 kpc . _",
    "neutrinos can serve as unique astronomical messengers . except for oscillations induced by transit in a vacuum higgs field ,",
    "neutrinos propagate without interactions between source and earth , providing powerful probes of high energy astrophysics  @xcite .",
    "the deployment of under - ice / water telescopes in the northern  @xcite and southern  @xcite hemispheres will greatly increase the statistics required for the realization of such a program . in this section",
    "we study possible mechanisms for neutrino production in astrophysical sources and discuss how flavor oscillations can distort the initial injection spectra .      in recent years , stronger and stronger experimental evidence for neutrino oscillations has been accumulating .",
    "neutrino flavor change implies : _",
    "( i ) _ that neutrinos have nonzero masses , i.e. , there is a spectrum of 3 or more neutrino mass eigenstates that are analogues of the charged lepton mass eigenstate @xmath12 @xmath13 ; _ ( ii ) _ leptonic mixing , i.e. , the weak interaction coupling the @xmath14 boson to a charged lepton and a neutrino , can also couple any charged lepton mass eigenstate @xmath12 to any neutrino mass eigenstate @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "the superposition of neutrino mass eigenstates produced in association with the charged lepton of flavor @xmath17 @xmath18 is the state we refer to as the neutrino of flavor alpha , where @xmath19 are elements of the neutrino mass - to - flavor mixing matrix , fundamental to particle physics .    throughout this talk",
    "we consider 3 neutrino species . in this case ,",
    "atmospheric data  @xcite indicate that @xmath20 and @xmath21 are maximally mixed and reactor data  @xcite points to @xmath22 .",
    "thus , to simplify the discussion hereafter we use the fact that @xmath23 is nearly zero to ignore cp violation and assume real matrix elements . with this in mind , one can define a mass basis as follows , @xmath24 @xmath25 and @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the solar mixing angle and @xmath28 is the eigenstate orthogonal to @xmath29 inversion of the neutrino mass - to - flavor mixing matrix leads leads to @xmath30 and @xmath31 finally , by adding eqs .",
    "( [ 3rd ] ) and ( [ orthogonal ] ) one obtains the @xmath20 flavor eigenstate , @xmath32 \\,\\,,\\ ] ] and by substracting these same equations the @xmath21 eigenstate .",
    "the evolution in time of the @xmath33 component of a neutrino initially born as @xmath34 in the rest frame of that component is described by schrdinger s equation , @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the mass of @xmath33 and @xmath37 is the proper time . in the lab frame , the lorentz invariant phase factor may be written as @xmath38 , where @xmath39 @xmath40 @xmath41 and @xmath42 are respectively , the time , the position , the energy , and the momentum of @xmath33 in the lab frame . since the neutrino is extremely relativistic @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "hence , from eq .",
    "( [ state ] ) it follows that the state vector of a neutrino born as @xmath34 after propagation of distance @xmath45 becomes @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the average energy of the various mass eigenstate components of the neutrino . using the unitarity of @xmath48 to invert eq .",
    "( [ state ] ) , from eq .",
    "( [ ritazza ] ) one finds that @xmath49\\,|\\nu_\\beta \\rangle \\,\\,.\\ ] ] in other words , the propagating mass eigenstates acquire relative phases giving rise to flavor oscillations .",
    "thus , after traveling a distance @xmath45 an initial state @xmath34 becomes a superposition of all flavors , with probability of transition to flavor @xmath50 @xmath51 given by @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54    for @xmath55 , the phases will be erased by uncertainties in @xmath45 and @xmath56 .",
    "consequently , averaging over @xmath57 one finds @xmath58 now , using @xmath59 eq .  ( [ paco ] ) can be re - written as @xmath60 since @xmath61 = @xmath62 the first and second terms in eq .",
    "( [ pp ] ) cancel each other , yielding @xmath63 the probabilities for flavor oscillation are then @xmath64 @xmath65 and @xmath66    now , let the ratios of neutrino flavors at production in the cosmic sources be written as @xmath67 with @xmath68 so that the relative fluxes of each mass eigenstate are given by @xmath69 . from our previous discussion , we conclude that the probability of measuring on earth a flavor @xmath70 is given by @xmath71 straightforward calculation shows that any initial flavor ratio that contains @xmath72 will arrive at earth with equipartition on the three flavors .",
    "there are two principal mechanisms for tev gamma ray production : _",
    "( i ) _  electrons undergo bremsstrahlung in the magnetic field and/or inverse compton scattering in the ambient photon sea or _",
    "( ii ) _  the gamma rays are directly traced to @xmath74 decay . and/or @xmath75 collisions .",
    "in this talk we focus attention on the former ; a generalization to the photopion production process is straightforward , see  @xcite for details . ]",
    "only the second scenario can accommodate baryonic cosmic ray production .",
    "since such cosmic rays are observed , it is reasonable to assume that at least some gamma ray sources operate according to the second mechanism .",
    "inelastic @xmath76 collisions lead to roughly equal numbers of @xmath74 s , @xmath77 s , and @xmath78 s , hence one expects two photons , two @xmath79 s , and four @xmath20 s per @xmath74 . on average ,",
    "the photons carry one - half of the energy of the pion .",
    "the average neutrino energy from the direct pion decay is @xmath80 and that of the muon is @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the ratio of muon to the pion mass squared .",
    "now , taking the @xmath20 from muon decay to have 1/3 the energy of the muon , the average energy of the @xmath20 from muon decay is @xmath83 .",
    "this gives a total @xmath20 energy per charged pion @xmath84 , with a total @xmath85 for each triplet of @xmath86 @xmath87 and @xmath74 produced . for simplicity",
    ", hereafter we consider that all neutrinos carry one - quarter of the energy of the pion .",
    "the total number of @xmath2-rays in the energy interval @xmath88 is equal to the total number of charged pions in the interval @xmath89 and twice the number of neutral pions in the same energy interval , @xmath90 additionally , since @xmath91 , the number of @xmath20 in the energy interval @xmath92 scales as @xmath93 now , taking @xmath94 on each side of eqs .",
    "( [ po ] ) and ( [ pu ] ) leads to @xmath95 respectively .",
    "the energy - bins @xmath96 scale with these fractions , and we arrive at @xmath97 for the total fluxes at the source , where @xmath98 denotes any one of the three pion charge - states . in propagation",
    "to earth a distance longer than all oscillation lengths , flavor changing amplitudes are replaced by probabilities .",
    "using eqs .",
    "( [ p1 ] ) , ( [ p2 ] ) , and ( [ p3 ] ) one can check that the initial flavor ratio @xmath99 mutates in a nearly identical flux for each of the three neutrino flavors which is equal to  @xcite @xmath100    icecube is , perhaps , the most promising route for neutrino detection  @xcite .",
    "this telescope will consist of 80 kilometer - length strings , each instrumented with 60 10-inch photo - multipliers spaced by 1.7 m. the deepest module is 2.4 km below the ice surface .",

    "the angular resolution @xmath110 allows a point source search window of @xmath111  sr .",
    "the crab nebula is generally taken as the standard candle of steady tev @xmath2-ray emission . in the energy @xmath112",
    "the crab data can be fitted by a single power law  @xcite , @xmath113 even though the energy spectrum of the crab nebula as measured by the hegra system is in very good agreement with calculations of inverse compton scattering  @xcite , it is interesting and desirable to have an independent observational discriminator between these two scenarios . for @xmath114",
    "tev , the number of @xmath115 showers expected to be detected at icecube is given by @xmath116 where @xmath117 denotes the probability ( generic to ice / water detectors ) that a @xmath73 ( or @xmath118 ) with energy @xmath119 on a trajectory through the detector produces a signal  @xcite . using eq .",

    "we conclude that the neutrino signal can be easily isolated from background at icecube .",
    "therefore , the hadronic nature of the high energy emission from the crab nebula can be confirmed or disproved in a few years of operation .",
    "cosmic ray experiments have identified an excess from the region of the gp in a limited energy range around @xmath104  gev .",
    "this is very suggestive of neutrons as candidate primaries , because the directional signal requires relatively - stable neutral primaries , and time - dilated neutrons can reach the earth from typical galactic distances when the neutron energy exceeds @xmath104  gev . in what follows",
    "we show that if the galactic messengers are neutrons , then those with energies below an @xmath128  gev will decay in flight , providing a flux of cosmic antineutrinos above a tev which would be _ observable _ at icecube .    the basic formula that relates the neutron flux at the source ( @xmath129 ) to the antineutrino flux observed at earth ( @xmath130 ) is  @xcite : @xmath131 \\ , . \\label{nuflux}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the variables appearing in eq .",

    "the ratio of the maximum @xmath139 energy to the neutron energy is @xmath146 and so the boosted @xmath139 has a spectrum with @xmath147 the second approximation is to replace the neutron decay probability @xmath148 with a step function @xmath149 at some energy @xmath150  gev . combining these two approximations we obtain @xmath151 normalization to the observed `` neutron '' excess at @xmath152  gev leads via eq .",
