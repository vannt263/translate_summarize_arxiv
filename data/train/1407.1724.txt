    "physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) is expected to exist at energies above the weak scale .",
    "while successive experiments at lep , the tevatron and the lhc have served to validate the sm over the past few decades , no direct evidence of new physics ( np ) has been found yet",
    ". clearly , np either exists at an energy scale higher than what has been probed , or its hints are subtler than we envision .",
    "the lhc , which is currently operational , is essentially a top - quark factory .",
    "the properties of the @xmath3 can therefore be measured with good precision .",
    "now , the mass of the top quark is more than an order of magnitude larger than that of all other fermions . as such",
    ", it may be affected by np in ways that do not manifest themselves in the interactions of the lighter fermions .",
    "in addition , its large mass causes the top to decay before it can hadronize , so that it can be studied more or less as a free quark .    in this paper",
    "we study np contributions to top - quark decay .",
    "the dominant @xmath3 decay modes in the sm involve @xmath6 , with @xmath7 , @xmath8 or @xmath9 .",
    "since the experimentally - measured value of the top decay width is in good agreement with the sm prediction @xcite , it is evident that the np contribution to the dominant decay modes , if any , is very small compared to that of the sm . on the other hand ,",
    "in the case of decay modes that are suppressed in the sm , an np contribution that is comparable to that of the sm in that mode may go unnoticed simply because its impact on the total width is small .",
    "this makes it interesting to probe rare decays , as these could well be where the new physics is lurking .",
    "one such decay is @xmath10 .",
    "it is suppressed in the sm because it involves the small element @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) quark mixing matrix .",
    "there are other suppressed decays ( e.g. , @xmath13 ) , but here we focus on @xmath0 .",
    "single - top production is rather suppressed at the lhc @xcite , so that it is difficult to isolate the decay @xmath14 experimentally and analyze it on its own .",
    "the most significant production mode for top quarks at the lhc is pair ( @xmath1 ) production . at lhc energies ,",
    "this is dominated by gluon fusion ( @xmath15 ) , as opposed to quark - antiquark annihilation ( @xmath16 ) . in order to search for np in top decay , the full process @xmath17 , with @xmath14 and @xmath18 , must be analyzed .",
    "apart from the usual difficulties of studying a multi - particle final state , this channel suffers from another complication ",
    "the @xmath5 decay leads to a second @xmath19 in the final state , providing an additional background that must be taken into account .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to analyze the process @xmath20 , and to look for observables that can reveal the presence of np in top decay , along the lines of ref .",
    "@xcite , will be examined elsewhere @xcite . ] .",
    "we will show that there are two types of observables that can be used .",
    "the first is simply an invariant mass - squared distribution involving two of the final - state particles in @xmath14 .",
    "with np , its form is altered compared to that of the sm .",
    "note , however , that this type of observable is entirely related to the decay of the @xmath3 itself . the associated production of the @xmath5 is unimportant , except insofar that one must distinguish the @xmath19 quarks coming from the @xmath3 and @xmath5 decays .",
    "the second type of observable does rely on the fact that a @xmath1 pair has been produced .",
    "the key point is that , in @xmath1 production , the spins of the @xmath3 and @xmath5 are correlated @xcite .",
    "the spin - correlation coefficient for the produced @xmath1 pair can be defined as @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 denote the alignment of the spins of the top and antitop with respect to the chosen spin - quantization axis .",
    "the spin of the @xmath3 itself is related to the angular distribution of its decay products through the relation @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the angle between the direction of the @xmath26 decay product and the spin quantization axis in the rest frame of the top , and @xmath27 is a numerical coefficient whose value depends on the identity of this decay product .",
    "the spin of the @xmath5 is related to the angular distribution of its decay products through a similar relation , with @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "naturally then , the spin correlation between the pair - produced top and antitop is manifested in the angular correlation between the decay products of the two particles .",
    "that relation is given as follows @xcite : @xmath30 its measurement permits the extraction of @xmath31 . if the measured value differs from the prediction of the sm , it would indicate the presence of np .",
    "one point should be noted at this juncture .",
    "the spin - correlation coefficient @xmath31 is , by definition , a property of the @xmath1 production process .",
    "however , its experimental determination depends on the decay .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : angcorr ] ) assumes that the @xmath3 and @xmath5 decay via sm interactions only .",
    "if there are np contributions in top decay , the value of @xmath31 extracted from the angular correlations of the top and antitop decay products will be different from the sm prediction",
    ". this would not be due to a change in the value of @xmath31 itself , but rather to a change in the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : angcorr ] ) .",
    "while there have been several studies of the effect of np on @xmath1 spin correlations , most of them have focused on np that affects @xmath32 production .",
    "these span both cp - conserving  @xcite and cp - violating  @xcite np scenarios .",
    "possibilities include non - standard @xmath33 couplings in the form of anomalous chromomagnetic dipole or chromoelectric dipole interactions , as well as many of the np models proposed to explain the large @xmath1 forward - backward asymmetry observed at the tevatron  @xcite .    of course",
    ", np contributions may be present in both @xmath1 production and in the decay .",
    "however , np in the production is much easier to detect , in that it should be observable even in the dominant decay modes of the top .",
    "for this reason we ignore the possibility of np in @xmath34 production in our analysis .",
    "we assume it will have been detected or ruled out before the study of np in the decay is done .",
    "once the observables that carry the signature of np have been pinpointed , the next question is : to what extent can they realistically be used to probe np in top decay ?",
    "can they be used to identify , even partially , the type of np present ?",
    "this is examined in the companion paper @xcite .",
    "there we show that it is likely that there will be enough events at the lhc to measure these observables reasonably precisely and extract information about the nature of np at play .    in this paper , we begin in sec .",
    "ii by examining how np in top decay can affect @xmath14 .",
    "iii we briefly discuss the full pair production and decay chain @xmath2 ( full details are given in the appendix ) .",
    "the observables that can be used to search for np in top decay are described in sec .",
    "iv . in sec .  v we perform a numerical simulation of @xmath2 at the lhc , including np , and compare the results for the observables with our analytical calculations .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "as detailed in the introduction , this work focuses on the search for new physics in rare decays of the top quark . in this paper",
    ", we examine the decay @xmath14 .",
    "however , the method described here can also be applied to other suppressed decays such as @xmath35 , etc .    while examining a suppressed decay mode , one must consider the most dominant production mode in order to have sufficient statistics .",
    "hence , the search for np in this top decay mode must involve the process @xmath17 .",
    "even there , one may have chosen to ignore the details of the production process and focus only on the decay . however , as we show in the following sections , there is something to be gained by considering the full process @xmath2 , in that the @xmath34 spin correlations can be put to use in the identification of np .      in the sm ,",
    "the decay @xmath14 arises via @xmath36 , followed by @xmath37 .",
    "np contributions to @xmath14 can be parameterized via an effective lagrangian @xmath38 , with @xmath39 in the above expressions , colour indices are not shown , but are assumed to contract in the same manner as those of the sm ( i.e. , the fields @xmath19 with @xmath3 and @xmath40 with @xmath41 ) . in some np models , the colour indices would contract in the opposite manner ( i.e. , the fields @xmath40 with @xmath3 and @xmath19 with @xmath41 ) .",
    "however , with fierz transformations it is straightforward to incorporate colour - mismatched terms into the effective lagrangian @xcite .",
    "in general , the np couplings ( the @xmath42 s in the above equations ) have both weak and strong phases .",
    "however , as argued in ref .",
    "@xcite , since the np strong phases can only be generated by self - rescattering from the np operators , they are very small . for this reason ,",
    "we neglect all np strong phases , so that the @xmath42 s contain only weak phases .",
    "furthermore , the np couplings can all reasonably be assumed to be of order unity , so that the sm and np contributions to @xmath14 can very well be about the same size . when computing the effect of np on a particular observable , it is therefore important to include both the sm - np and np - np interference pieces .",
    "we calculate the square of the matrix element for @xmath14 as a function of the top - quark spin ( @xmath44 ) , including the sm and all the np contributions .",
    "we find @xmath45 ~ ,    \\label{eq : ampsquaredtbbbarc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 , with @xmath47 and where @xmath44 is the spin four - vector of the top quark .",

    "the remaining @xmath55 are defined as @xmath56 in the above , @xmath57 note that @xmath51 contains both the sm and np contributions , whereas the other @xmath55 contain only np contributions .    the term proportional to @xmath58 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ampsquaredtbbbarc ] ) describes the triple product ( tp ) in the decay . because the @xmath42 s contain only weak phases , the tp is purely cp - violating .",
    "furthermore , eq .  ( [ eq : abbar ] ) contains terms proportional to @xmath59 and @xmath60 . of these , @xmath60 is also cp - violating .",
    "now , if one adds eq .",
    "( [ eq : ampsquaredtbbbarc ] ) to its cp - conjugate counterpart , all cp - violating terms cancel , leaving the remaining terms unchanged ( apart from a normalization factor of @xmath61 ) . in focusing on cp - conserving observables ,",
    "we implicitly assume that this cp averaging has been performed .",
    "the main point to be retained from eq .",
    "( [ eq : ampsquaredtbbbarc ] ) is that the amplitude squared depends on seven different combinations of np couplings  six @xmath62 s and re@xmath63 .",
    "thus , there are a number of independent observables that , in principle , can provide information about the np .",
    "while we can hope to measure all seven of these quantities , we can not measure all of the individual @xmath42 parameters . in the remainder of this paper ( and in the companion paper ) , when we refer to `` identifying '' the np , what is meant is this partial identification of the six @xmath62 s and re@xmath63 , not the complete identification of all of the @xmath42 parameters .",
    "as a first step , we calculate the cross - section for @xmath1 pair production followed by the decay chain @xmath64 , @xmath65 .",
