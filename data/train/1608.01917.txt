    "the research on nondiffracting accelerating optical beams has attracted considerable attention since the first study and observation of such beams reported in 2007 @xcite .",
    "these are optical wave packets that propagate along a curved trajectory while preserving its transverse amplitude structure .",
    "the first of such beams , known as the airy beam , traces back to the context of quantum mechanics @xcite , as a solution to the free - potential schrdinger equation . in optics @xcite ,",
    "the airy beam is understood as a solution to the paraxial wave equation , which is a good approximation of the propagation dynamics when the beam trajectory is limited to small ( paraxial ) angles @xmath0 . in this case , the airy beam propagates along a parabolic trajectory while maintaining its intensity profile .",
    "the desirable feature of simultaneous shape - preserving and self - bending has invoked many intriguing applications including inducing curved plasma filaments @xcite , synthesizing versatile bullets of light @xcite , carrying out autofocusing and supercontinuum experiments @xcite , manipulating microparticles @xcite and so on . however the spatial acceleration of a beam will make the bending angle continue increasing , eventually , the wave packet falls off into the non - paraxial regime and no longer nondiffracting . in @xcite , the authors found solutions to the maxwell s equations in free space , that propagate along semicircular trajectories without losing the intensity of their main lobes after a large angle ( @xmath1 ) bending . roughly speaking , in the two dimensional transverse electric ( te ) or transverse magnetic ( tm ) polarized cases , they examine the spherical harmonic expansion for the solution to the helmholtz equation , splitting the integral for the bessel function into two parts corresponding to both forward and backward propagations .",
    "the non - diffracting accelerating beam is the forward bessel wave packets with apodization on the initial axis .",
    "the three - dimensional accelerating beams in @xcite are composed by a superposition of scalar solutions for the te /tm polarization , multiplied by a plane wave in the direction perpendicular to the plane the accelerating trajectory lies in .",
    "another approach to obtain 3d beams is to implement directly the splitting approach to the 3d spherical harmonic expansions in spherical coordinates ( instead of cylindrical coordinates ) , as indicated in @xcite .",
    "this was generalized in @xcite to find non - paraxial beams propagating along elliptic trajectories , that is , the magnitude of acceleration is no longer constant .    it is also explained in the previously mentioned physics literatures that the nondiffracting accelerating wave packets in free space , e.g. , the airy beam , is not contradicting the ehrenfest s theorem , because the transverse intensity is not square integrable , hence the beam does not have a transverse center of mass . in experiments ,",
    "see @xcite , the localized beams with finite energy are induced by applying an exponential truncation ( apodization ) .",
    "they still exhibit the key features over long distance propagation in spite of the fact that the center of gravity of these wave packets remains constant ( an outcome of ehrenfest s theorem ) and diffraction eventually takes over .",
    "non - diffracting accelerating beams are shown to exist in other type of media . in @xcite , these beams , as analytic solutions of maxwell s equations with linear or nonlinear losses , propagate in absorbing media while maintaining their peak intensity .",
    "while the power such beams carry decays during propagation , the peak intensity and the structure of their main lobe region are maintained over large distances .",
    "such loss - proof beams , when launched in vacuum or in lossless media , display exponential growth in peak intensity .",
    "this is achieved through the property of self - healing of non - diffracting beams , which allows energy transfer from the oscillating tail of the beam to the main lobe region .",
    "the self - healing properties , as a result of self transverse acceleration , is studied in @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the idea is generalized to construct shape - preserving wave packets in curved space that propagate along non - geodesic trajectories .    in this paper , we show existence of other accelerating and near - nondiffracting solutions for non - paraxial equations .",
    "more precisely , we construct the complex geometrical optics ( cgo ) solutions with nonlinear limiting carleman weights ( lcw ) .    in the first approach , we consider the propagation in heterogeneous media .",
    "let @xmath2 be a bounded domain in @xmath3 with smooth boundary .",
    "we consider the time dependent maxwell s equations @xmath4 where @xmath5 for some positive constants @xmath6 and @xmath7 , and the corresponding time - harmonic maxwell s equations of @xmath8 given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the angular frequency .",
    "the beam we construct is based on the so - called complex geometrical optics ( cgo ) solutions to maxwell s equations .",
    "these solutions were widely used in solving inverse problems arising from imaging modalities using electricity , electromagnetic waves and so on .",
    "taking electric impedance tomography ( eit ) for example , the inverse problem is to reconstruct the conductivity function @xmath12 in a conductivity equation @xmath13 in a medium @xmath2 from the boundary dirichlet - to - neumann ( voltage - to - current ) map @xmath14 .",
    "this is also known as the caldern problem and was generalized to an inverse problem for maxwell s equations , namely , to reconstruct the parameter set @xmath15 from boundary impedance map given by @xmath16 . here",
    "@xmath17 denotes the unit outer normal vector on the boundary @xmath18 .",
    "these inverse problems were studied extensively ( see @xcite for a detailed review ) while through all the analysis , the cgo solutions introduced in @xcite plays a key role .",
    "an example of such solutions to the conductivity equation @xmath13 is given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 ( @xmath21 is the spatial dimension ) satisfying @xmath22 and @xmath23 satisfies a decaying property with respect to @xmath24 .",
    "more precisely , @xmath25 let @xmath26 and @xmath27",
    ". in @xmath28 , set @xmath29 ( note that @xmath22 and @xmath30 ) .",
    "assume that @xmath31 is independent of @xmath32 .",
    "the above decaying property implies that @xmath33 , with @xmath34 given by , is roughly a plane wave packet propagating nondiffractingly along @xmath35 direction for @xmath36 large .",
    "the transverse profile of the beam is oscillatory in @xmath37 and exponential in @xmath38 .",
    "( compared to the airy beam , the tail of the cgo plane beam does not decay with respect to @xmath39 ) .",
    "note that the cgo solution is a high energy near - nondiffracting wave packet for @xmath36 is large .    using the liouville transform @xmath40 , the conductivity equation @xmath13 is reduced to the schrdinger equation @xmath41 with potential @xmath42 .",
    "the exsitence of a global cgo solution @xmath34 of the form is equivalent to solving an equation of @xmath43 in @xmath44 given by @xmath45 the faddeev s kernel defines an inverse of @xmath46 by @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 denote the fourier transform and its inverse , respectively .",
    "furthermore , it is shown in @xcite that for @xmath36 large enough , @xmath50 for @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the closure of @xmath53 with respect to the weighted norm @xmath54",
    ". then the existence of @xmath43 to and the estimate are corollary of and the fact that @xmath55 can be viewed as a compactly supported @xmath56 function .    for maxwell s equations , by introducing two auxiliary scalar fields @xmath57 and @xmath58 and a liouville type rescaling , the first order system can be reduced to a dirac system @xmath59 .",
    "a solution @xmath60 of the dirac system gives a solution to the original maxwell system iff @xmath61 .",
    "the reduction to the schrdinger equation @xmath62 is then due to @xmath63 .",
    "( detail of the reduction is outlined in section [ section3d ] . )",
    "this reduction was first introduced in @xcite and became a standard step for construction of cgo for maxwell s equations ever since .",
    "once the cgo solutions are constructed for the schrdinger equation , a uniqueness result is required to show that the scalar potentials @xmath57 and @xmath58 are vanishing . as a result , one obtains a cgo solution to maxwell s equations of the form @xmath64 for @xmath36 sufficiently large , where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are two constant vectors in @xmath67 and bounded in @xmath36 .",
    "similar to the scalar case , under the assumption that the parameters are functions only depending on transverse variables , these solutions are high energy near - nondiffracting beams .    in above construction",
    ", replacing the linear phase @xmath68 by a nonlinear one , denoted by @xmath69 , it is shown in @xcite that solutions of cgo type can be constructed to the schrdinger equations using carleman estimates , and also to the magnetic schrdinger equations as seen in @xcite .",
    "these admissible phases are called limiting carleman weights ( lcw ) .",
    "there are only handful lcw in three dimensions while all analytical functions in @xmath70 can be used as an lcw in two dimensions . with nonlinear phases",
    ", it allows to construct solutions propagating along a curved surface ( accelerate ) while almost preserving its intensity profile ( near - nondiffracting ) , usually due to a smallness estimate similar to . in @xcite , the cgo with the lcw @xmath71",
    "was used to solve the caldern problem with partial measurements . in @xcite ,",
    "the lcw @xmath72 was used to construct solutions on riemannian manifolds with a family of admissible metrics , modeling the anisotropic materials .    in order to generalize this to construct cgo solutions to maxwell s equations with nonlinear lcw",
    ", it requires uniqueness of the solution to the reduced schrndinger equation . in @xcite ,",
    "the uniqueness is obtained on a bounded domain by projecting to a function space with fixed boundary conditions . in @xcite",
    ", different approach is adopted to obtain the uniqueness , by applying the original fourier analysis in @xcite to @xmath73 direction .",
    "the cgo solutions with either @xmath71 or @xmath72 can be put into a unified framework in cylindrical coordinate @xmath74 . in particular , we show that the dependence of the cgo solutions on @xmath66 can be mainly @xmath75 , so that we obtain the bending electromagnetic beams .    in the second framework , we adopt a very different approach that is based on a special transformation , known as the kelvin transform . in @xmath44 , the three - dimensional kevin transform @xmath76 is a reflection with respect to a sphere , which maps hyperplanes to spheres that pass the origin .",
    "we exploit the transformation law by @xmath76 .",
    "moreover , we show that a non - diffracting beam that propagates along straight lines , such as a cgo solution with a linear phase , can be  pushed forward \" to generate a beam that accelerates along the circular trajectory .",
    "the acceleration is strong enough to shift the energy from the tail to the main lobe , over - compensating the intensity of the first lobe while propagating .",
    "this effect is independent of the background medium , homogeneous or heterogeneous , lossless or lossy .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we show the main steps to construct the cgo solutions to maxwell s equations based on carleman estimates .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the construction based on kelvin transform .",
    "both sections are complemented with the demonstration of corresponding solutions .",

    "the research of the second author is supported by the nsf grant dms-1501049 .",
    "in this section , we aim to construct the almost diffraction - free beams for the inhomogeneous maxwell s equations in dimension three .",
    "we first discuss the construction of such beams with lcw @xmath77 .",
    "the second construction is to apply another nonlinear lcw @xmath78 .",
    "numerical demonstrations of these accelerating beams are also presented . for completeness",
    ", we first include a reduction , introduced in @xcite , that transforms the maxwell s system to the vectorial schrdinger equation .",
    "let @xmath2 be a bounded domain in @xmath3 with smooth boundary .",
    "we consider the time - harmonic maxwell s equations where @xmath79 for some positive constant @xmath6 and @xmath7 , @xmath80 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 in @xmath81 .",
    "we remark here that the asymptotic - to - constant assumption @xmath82 is without loss of generality since any smooth parameters @xmath83 in a bounded domain can be extended to satisfy it in a larger domain that contains the propagating region .    from ( [ r : max ] ) , one has the following compatibility conditions for @xmath84 and @xmath85 @xmath86 there are eight equations in and for six unknowns , components of @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "it allows us to augment two scalar potentials @xmath57 and @xmath58 to obtain @xmath89 where @xmath90 , @xmath91 ( the principal branch ) and @xmath92 . set the unknown to be the eight vector @xmath93 .",
    "we can write as @xmath94 where @xmath95 is a first order dirac operator given by @xmath96 and @xmath97 here @xmath98 is the @xmath99-identity matrix .",
    "note that @xmath100 .",
    "moreover , we mention a fact , later becoming very important , that maxwell s equations is equivalent to the dirac system if and only if @xmath61 .    throughout the paper we also use the notation @xmath101 for all eight - vectors @xmath102 where lower cases @xmath103 are scalar and upper cases @xmath104 are three - vectors .",
    "now we apply a liouville type of rescaling by letting @xmath105 then we have @xmath106 where @xmath107 and @xmath108 with @xmath109 .",
    "one can easily verify that with the rescaling , the first order terms in @xmath110 cancel each other and we obtain @xmath111 where the matrix potential @xmath112 is an @xmath113-valued potential with compact support in @xmath2 , whose entries involve the parameters @xmath114 and their first and second derivatives .",
    "the form of @xmath112 is not crucial in this construction so we omit writing the explicit formula . for readers who are interesting in the expression of @xmath112",
    ", it can be found , for example , in @xcite .",
    "we will also need the following relations @xmath115 where @xmath116 shares the same property as @xmath112 .",
    "an extra fact of @xmath116 we will take advantage of is that the first and the fifth rows are diagonal .",
    "here @xmath117 denotes the transpose of @xmath118 .      in this part",
    ", we outline the construction steps of cgo solutions to the schrdinger equations based on the carleman estimate as in @xcite .",
    "however , the general construction does not provide uniqueness that is necessary for translating to solutions to maxwell s equations .",
    "therefore , our argument will bifurcate slightly for two different choices of limiting carleman weights in order to obtain uniqueness respectively .",
    "a real smooth function @xmath119 on an open set @xmath120 is a lcw if it has a non - vanishing gradient on @xmath120 and if it satisfies the condition @xmath121 roughly speaking , this is the hrmander condition that guarantees the solvability of the semi - classical conjugate operator @xmath122 for both @xmath119 and @xmath123 .",

    "it is not hard to verify that @xmath160 satisfies the eikonal equation by writing the gradient as @xmath161 this is the case @xmath162 . in order to show uniqueness ,",
    "an approach different from carleman estimate was taken in @xcite by taking advantage of that the phase is linear in @xmath73 .",

    ", we have @xmath192 therefore , @xmath193 .    to address the uniqueness of the solution to the schrdinger equation , one can adopt the orthogonal projection technique in @xcite onto a subspace of @xmath194 with specified boundary condition adjusted to suit our case .",
