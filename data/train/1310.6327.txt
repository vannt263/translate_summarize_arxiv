    "phase transitions and critical phenomena have formed a dominant theme in statistical physics for a long time and new aspects are still subject to active research .",
    "this is not only because of the importance and elegance of the fundamental aspect of many - body systems in the original setting of condensed - matter physics , but also thanks to diverse applications to various complex systems in other areas of physics , as well as in chemistry , biology , and even in economy and social sciences .",
    "any system with collective behavior resulting from a large number of interacting particles ( or `` agents '' ) can be described by methods of statistical physics , and phase transitions often are important features of such systems .",
    "a fundamental aspect of phase transitions is the scale invariance emerging upon approaching a critical point , which leads to universal scaling behavior independent of microscopic characteristics .",
    "the theoretical understanding of universality in equilibrium statistical mechanics is well established in terms of the renormalization group ( rg).@xcite attempts have also been made to generalize this formalism as well as general scaling hypotheses to non - equilibrium phase transitions and dynamic critical scaling , @xcite but the understanding here is much less complete . since many important systems are far from equilibrium , deeper understanding of criticality and scaling behavior under such conditions is called for .    in this paper",
    "we report progress in characterizing dynamical critical scaling at classical ( thermal ) phase transitions .",
    "we discuss a scaling hypothesis for a very general class of quench ( or annealing ) protocols in which a function with a single dynamic exponent ( along with the standard equilibrium exponents ) describes the changes from adiabatic to diabatic evolution . to test the scaling forms we study phase transitions in classical ising models , using monte carlo ( mc ) simulations with both single - spin and cluster updates .",
    "our approach is based on extensions of the kibble - zurek ( kz ) arguments,@xcite which originally focused on quantitatively relating defect formation ( e.g. , the typical defect size and the density of defects ) to the rate of change ( the quench velocity ) of a parameter of the system ( such as the temperature , external fields , etc . ) . the kz mechanism and extensions of it have successfully been used to describe out - of - equilibrium physics at both classical @xcite and quantum phase transitions @xcite ( for a general review , see , e.g. , refs .  ) .",
    "we consider a system with critical temperature @xmath7 .",
    "when this system is quenched to the neighborhood of @xmath7 by starting from some initial temperature @xmath8 and ending at some final temperature @xmath9 , if the rate of change is sufficiently slow the system evolves adiabatically toward its equilibrium state at temperature @xmath10 .",
    "( more accurately , we should refer to this limit as quasi - static when we are dealing with an open system .",
    "we will here use the term adiabatic in the generalized sense . )",
    "small deviations from adiabaticity ( the quasi - adiabatic regime ) can be described by adiabatic perturbation theory ( as has been demonstrated explicitly for quenches of quantum systems at zero temperature,@xcite and one can anticipate direct analogues for classical quenches ) .",
    "in contrast , if the evolution is fast ( the quench velocity is high ) , excitations lead to a large density of defects and the adiabatic description breaks down .",
    "the kz mechanism provides a natural way to distinguish these perturbative and non - perturbative regimes .    according to the arguments of kz , for the quasi - adiabatic picture to be valid",
    ", the time @xmath11 that the system is allowed to take to approach the final temperature @xmath10 must be at least of the order of the relaxation time @xmath12 associated with the system s microscopic dynamical properties at that temperature . the relaxation time is simply related to the equilibrium spatial correlation length @xmath13 according to @xmath14 which defines the dynamic exponent @xmath3 .",
    "this exponent depends on the equilibrium universality class of the phase transition , as well as the stochastic dynamics imposed on the system ( or , alternatively , one can consider hamiltonian dynamics , e.g. , in quantum systems ) .",
    "thus , for a linear quench with velocity @xmath0 , the criterion for staying adiabatic is obtained by requiring for the total quench time @xmath15 : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the equilibrium correlation - length exponent .    another way to interpret",
    "the above relationship is to consider the _ remaining _ time @xmath18 of a quench which has reached temperature @xmath19 after starting out at some @xmath20 and which is to continue all the way down to @xmath7 .",
    "then , for a given @xmath18 , or equivalently , for given velocity @xmath0 , the relation @xmath21 defines the temperature @xmath10 at which the system falls out of the adiabatic evolution and essentially freezes , not being able to evolve significantly for the remainder of the quench process .",
    "this should hold independently of the starting temperature @xmath22 if it is sufficiently above @xmath10 . from this relation",
    "we can also extract the velocity ( the kz velocity ) @xmath23 at which the system falls out of adiabaticity at temperature @xmath10 .",
    "thus , it is , in the thermodynamic limit , not possible to stay adiabatic all the way down to @xmath7 .",
    "we present an alternative derivation of this result in appendix [ appa ] , where we consider the continuous quench as a series of infinitesimal quenches .",
    "we can also write down the spatial length - scale @xmath24 associated with a given velocity , i.e. , the correlation length reached at the point where the infinite system freezes and can not follow the instantaneous equilibrium state . since @xmath25 for the quasi - adiabatic evolution and @xmath26 at the point of freezing ,",
    "( [ eq : quench_velocity ] ) gives @xmath27 for a finite system the maximum length scale is @xmath28 , i.e. , @xmath29 , and the characteristic velocity separating the adiabatic and non - adiabatic responses then has an lower bound , which is simply obtained , according to standard arguments in finite - size scaling theory,@xcite by replacing the largest length - scale for the infinite system by @xmath28 . in this case that means @xmath30 in ( [ def : xiv ] ) .",
    "thus , a system of linear size @xmath28 will remain adiabatic all the way down to @xmath7 , provided that the quench velocity is of the order of the size - dependent kz velocity given by @xmath31 when the velocity is below this characteristic value , the non - adiabatic response of the system is very small and can be treated perturbatively .",
    "in contrast , when the velocity exceeds @xmath32 the quasi - adiabaticity breaks down and the response of the system corresponds to non - adiabatic dynamics which is non - perturbative in @xmath0 .",
    "it should be pointed out that it is in general not possible to assign an exact value to @xmath32 ( and all the other quantities defined above ) , as eq .",
    "( [ def : vkz ] ) only indicates a proportionality and the change between the quasi - adiabatic and non - perturbative regime normally takes place in the form of a smooth cross - over ( although we will also demonstrate an interesting exception , where the break - down of the quasi - adiabatic regime is sudden ) .",
    "we will here use extensive mc simulations to extract scaling functions of the form @xmath33 describing the dynamic approach to the critical point for several models and dynamic schemes , from which the cross - over scale can be readily read - off . in addition to the kz scale , we will also investigate and quantify another , higher - velocity ( diabatic ) cross - over scale @xmath34 related to a size - independent microscopic ( lattice ) scale @xmath35 .      as we have seen in the discussion above , the dynamic scaling will naturally involve the dynamic exponent @xmath3 of a given combination of model and imposed mc dynamics ( updating scheme for the system configurations ) . for metropolis dynamics,@xcite",
    "in which @xmath36 single - spin flip attempts define a unit of time in updating the system configurations , many works have been devoted to extracting the value of @xmath3 ( which in the case of metropolis dynamics we will often call @xmath37 ) for the 2d ising model , e.g. , refs .  .",
    "the values obtained are typically close to @xmath38 , with @xmath39 , obtained in ref .  ,",
    "often quoted as the most reliable result .",
    "the relatively large dynamic exponent implies that the metropolis algorithm suffers rather severely from critical slowing - down @xcite when the system is close to its critical point ",
    "the collective critical clusters persist for long times when updated only gradually by single - spin flips . despite of the critical slowing - down issue ,",
    "metropolis dynamics is still indispensable in its own right due to its close correspondence to relaxation processes due to local couplings to the environment in experiment systems.@xcite moreover , the metropolis algorithm is very widely applicable to simulations even of very complex many - body systems . even though there is no experimental counterpart of cluster updates , efficient cluster updates such as the swendsen - wang ( sw ) @xcite and wolff algorithms @xcite",
    "have been very important to reduce or eliminate the inefficiency caused by critical slowing down in simulations . however , unlike the metropolis scheme , the applicability in practice of these algorithms is restricted to a smaller number of models .    for sw updates of the 2d ising model , where the system is subdivided into clusters and each cluster",
    "is flipped with probability @xmath40 , the nature of the dynamic scaling is still somewhat controversial .",
    "values for the dynamic exponent have typically fallen in the range @xmath41 , @xcite but in some works it was instead proposed that the characteristic time diverges not as a power @xmath42 but logarithmically , which would imply @xmath43.@xcite for the 3d ising model the exponent is not known very precisely , with results typically falling in the range @xmath44.@xcite    in the wolff algorithm , which can be regarded as an improvement over the sw algorithm , clusters are constructed one at a time and always flipped .",
    "it is therefore normally more likely to flip large clusters.@xcite the value of the dynamic exponent was estimated at @xmath45 for the 2d ising model , and in the range @xmath46 to @xmath47 for the 3d ising model.@xcite      we here explore dynamic critical scaling in mc simulations of the ising model , primarily in two dimensions but with some results also for higher dimensions .",
    "we change the temperature linearly or nonlinearly as a function of mc time and focus on the approach to the critical point .",
    "when such a quench becomes extremely slow ( and perhaps is more properly referred to as annealing ) , the scheme described above is known as _",
    "simulated annealing_.@xcite    while ideas of how to incorporate insights from the kz mechanism or similar considerations into simulated annealing processes have been discussed previously , @xcite the goal of these works has normally been to maximize the efficiency of the process of finding the global energy minimum of a system ( optimizing the annealing schedule ) , or to reach the finite - temperature equilibrium distribution as fast as possible .",
    "also , simulated annealing was studied to analyze the interplay between the kz mechanism and coarsening dynamics.@xcite in our work presented here , the objective is instead to study the scaling behavior when the transition point is approached in systems of different size and at different velocities .",
    "the basic idea is to generalize the standard finite - size scaling techniques , where scaling functions depend on the ratio @xmath48 , to finite - velocity scaling where @xmath49 should enter in a similar way .",
    "our main aim is to establish bench - marks for dynamical critical scaling , especially the form of the scaling functions describing quenches to @xmath7 , for a prototypical model system and the above mentioned most commonly used mc updating schemes .",
    "some aspects of this kind of generalized kz scaling have already been reported , e.g. , in quantum systems where similar scaling behavior applies , @xcite in some classical systems based on effective dynamical ginzburg - landau models@xcite , and in the context of soliton formation that can be described by the stochastic gross - pitaeveski equation.@xcite in ref .  ,",
    "et al . _  studied a similar non - equilibrium setup with external - field tuning in infinite - size limit , motivated by general scaling arguments and an rg approach .",
    "some studies have also been reported of linear temperature quenches similar to those discussed in this paper.@xcite here we propose different ways to analyze data and provide a more complete characterization of the scaling behaviors in the entire velocity range .",

    "<S> we show that there are dual scaling functions governing the dynamic scaling , which together describe the scaling behavior in the entire velocity range @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> these functions have asymptotics corresponding to the adiabatic and diabatic limit , and close to these limits they are perturbative in @xmath0 and @xmath2 , respectively . away from their perturbative domains , </S>",
    "<S> both functions cross over into the same universal power - law scaling form governed by the static and dynamic critical exponents ( as well as an exponent characterizing the quench protocol ) . as a by - product of the scaling studies , </S>",
    "<S> we obtain high - precision estimates of the dynamic exponent @xmath3 for the two - dimensional ising model subject to the three variants of monte carlo dynamics ; for single - spin metropolis updates @xmath4 , for swendsen - wang multi - cluster updates @xmath5 , and for wolff single - cluster updates @xmath6 . for wolff dynamics , we find an interesting behavior with a non - analytic break - down of the quasi - adiabatic and diabatic scaling , instead of the generic smooth cross - over described by a power law . </S>",
    "<S> we interpret this disconnect between the two scaling regimes as a dynamic phase transition of the wolff algorithm , caused by an effective sudden loss of ergodicity at high velocity . </S>"
