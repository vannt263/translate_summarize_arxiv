    "despite extensive efforts over the years , lattice qcd calculation of the matrix elements relevant for understanding the @xmath3 decays , including the @xmath6 rule and the direct @xmath7 violation parameter @xmath8 , have achieved only limited success to the present@xcite .",
    "one reason behind the slow progress is lack of full chiral symmetry in the kogut - susskind@xcite and wilson@xcite formulation for lattice fermions employed in the past attempts .",
    "the domain wall fermion formalism @xcite offers a possibility of resolving this problem . in this article",
    "we report on our study of the @xmath3 amplitudes in quenched qcd using this formalism@xcite .",
    "the framework of our study is the reduction formulae@xcite derived from chiral perturbation theory(@xmath9pt ) , which relate @xmath2 amplitudes to the physical @xmath3 amplitudes .",
    "we briefly review these formulae to expose some limitations@xcite .",
    "chiral property of domain wall qcd has been examined in detail recently @xcite .",
    "we have shown in particular @xcite that the residual chiral symmetry breaking due to finite fifth - dimensional size is significantly reduced for a renormalization - group improved gluon action as compared to the standard plaquette action .",
    "we therefore calculate the @xmath2 matrix elements for the two gluon actions in parallel .",
    "the effective hamiltonian @xmath11 for @xmath0 k meson decays is written as @xmath12 where @xmath13 are wilson coefficients .",
    "the basis four - quark operators @xmath14 are decomposed as @xmath15 corresponding to iso - spin in the final state @xmath16 and @xmath17 .    under @xmath18 chiral transformation , the basis operators @xmath14 transform as @xmath19 for @xmath20 , @xmath21 for @xmath22 and @xmath23 for @xmath24 . to leading order in @xmath9pt the operators that transform according to these flavor representations",
    "are given by@xcite @xmath25 where we consider @xmath23 operator only at @xmath26 order due to the reason explained later .    using unknown parameters , @xmath27 ,",
    "one may write the @xmath14 s in terms of the @xmath9pt operators according to @xmath28 for the case of @xmath29 separately .    for @xmath14 in ( [ relation-1 ] ) , @xmath30 matrix elements are proportional to @xmath31 , whereas @xmath32 matrix elements to @xmath33 .",
    "to eliminate @xmath34 one has to introduce an operator @xmath35 and construct @xmath36 , where @xmath37 can be determined by @xmath38 matrix elements ( see ( [ alpha_def ] ) ) .",
    "one then obtains the reduction formula , ( [ origred ] ) below , relating the @xmath3 and @xmath2 amplitudes originally given by bernard _",
    "et.al_@xcite .    in ( [ relation-2 ] )",
    "there would appear too many unknown parameters to invalidate the reduction relation , if all @xmath23 operators up to @xmath39 order were included as in the case of other representation . to exclude contributions from these operators at @xmath40",
    ", we take the chiral limit where the reduced relation is justified . in this limit",
    ", the matrix elements for @xmath3 are obtained in proportion to those for @xmath2@xcite .",
    "it should be stressed that it is only in the chiral limit that one can obtain a complete set of reduction formulae at the lowest order of @xmath9pt .",
    ".simulation parameters .",
    "scale @xmath41 is fixed from string tension @xmath42  mev .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     parameters of our numerical simulation are summarized in table .",
    "[ params ] .",
    "calculations are carried out , assuming degenerate bare quark mass @xmath43 , on a @xmath4 lattice at a coupling constant corresponding to a lattice spacing of @xmath5  gev . with these parameters",
    "the anomalous quark mass @xmath44 representing residual chiral symmetry breaking is similar to u - d quark mass for the plaquette action and quite small for the rg - improved action .",
    "we set the scale from measurement of the string tension assuming @xmath42  mev@xcite .",
    "to evaluate quark loops in some types of contractions , we employ the random noise method with the number of noises taken to be 2 .",
    "this number is decided from a numerical test .",
    "we calculate the @xmath2 matrix elements using the wall source and dividing by the normalization factor @xmath45 . in this convention ,",
    "@xmath9pt reduction formulae for @xmath46 take the form , @xmath47 and for @xmath24 , @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the meson mass on the lattice , while the experimental values are to be substituted in @xmath50",
    ". in ( [ origred ] ) the subtraction term @xmath51 appears only for @xmath16 .",
    "the parameter @xmath52 is written as @xmath53 where the differentiation by @xmath54 is implemented by a double inversion of the dirac operator .",
    "= 3.98 cm = 3.4 cm    = 4.11 cm = 3.59 cm    = 6.5 cm = 6.5 cm    = 6.4 cm = 6.4 cm    for limitation of space we concentrate on the matrix elements of @xmath55 and @xmath56 , which represent the main contributions to @xmath57 .",
    "examples of propagator ratios for @xmath58 which appears on the right hand - side of ( [ origred ] ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ t - dep06 ] for ( a ) plaquette and ( b ) rg - improved gauge actions . in each figure",
    ", the upper panel is for the @xmath2 matrix element and the lower for @xmath59 defined in ( [ alpha_def ] ) .",
    "although both propagators contain quark loops , which have been known to make signals worse , reasonable signals are obtained at the level of propagator ratios .",
    "this also justifies our choice of 2 random noises to evaluate the quark loops .    a constant fitting , as shown in fig .",
    "[ t - dep06 ] , yields the matrix element , which we plot as a function of @xmath60 in fig .",
    "circles and diamonds show the contribution of the @xmath2 matrix element and the subtraction term to the @xmath3 matrix element of @xmath55 as given in the reduction formula ( [ origred ] ) .",
    "there is a severe cancellation between the two contributions , leading to the total value of the @xmath3 matrix element ( squares ) which is more than an order of magnitude smaller than the individual contributions .",
    "nonetheless , the enlarged plots in fig .  [ ql06](a ) and ( b ) show that the total values have a reasonable signal .",
    "there is no subtraction term for @xmath56 .",
    "we obtain clear signals for this operator using the reduction formula ( [ newred ] ) as shown in fig .",
    "[ ql28 ] .",
    "the remaining procedure is to make a linear fitting , as shown in figs .",
    "[ ql06 ] and [ ql28 ] , to take the chiral limit @xmath61 where both of the reduction formulae ( [ origred ] ) and ( [ newred ] ) are valid to estimate the physical matrix element , and to convert the values to continuum theory renormalized in the @xmath62 scheme with ndr . for the latter ,",
    "we employ the renormalization factors calculated in perturbation theory at one - loop level@xcite with mean field improvement .    prior to this final step",
    ", we are currently increasing the statistics to reduce the errors further .",
    "we are also performing a new simulation with a larger lattice volume to investigate finite size effect in the matrix elements .",
    "we have presented our preliminary results for the @xmath3 decay amplitudes based on the @xmath9pt reduction formulae and domain wall qcd .",
    "matrix elements of reasonable statistical quality are obtained from about a hundred gauge configurations in our quenched numerical simulation .",
    "values for the matrix elements from plaquette and rg - improved gauge actions seems consistent within the errors .",
    "these results make us hopeful that the present approach yields precise information about the @xmath63 rule and direct cp violation in the standard model with more statistics and detailed analysis .",
