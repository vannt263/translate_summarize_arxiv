    "diffraction is characterised by an elastically scattered proton which loses only a small fraction @xmath2 of its initial beam momentum .",
    "these events are selected experimentally by detecting the proton at small scattering angles ( roman pot detectors ) or by requiring a large empty area in the detector between the outgoing proton and the hadronic system @xmath3 produced in the interaction ( rapidity gap ) .",
    "the squared 4-momentum @xmath4 transferred at the proton vertex can be measured by tagging the proton . for the rapidity gap method , which accesses a much larger event sample ,",
    "the cross section has to be integrated over @xmath5  gev@xmath6 and in @xmath7 of the events the proton is excited into a hadronic system of small mass @xmath8  gev .",
    "the two methods give the same results when compared in the same kinematic range .    in a picture which depicts diffraction as a two step process , the proton exchanges a diffractive object ( often called the pomeron ) with momentum fraction @xmath2 and the quark struck by the photon carries a fraction @xmath9 of the momentum of the diffractive exchange .",
    "additional kinematic variables are bjorken - x @xmath10 and the inelasticity @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the @xmath0 centre - of - mass energy squared .",
    "the cross section is proportional to the combination of two structure functions : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a kinematic factor resulting from the difference of the fluxes of transversely and longitudinally polarised photons from the electron .",
    "@xmath15 is proportional to the diffractive @xmath16 cross section , whereas @xmath17 is related only to the part induced by longitudinal photons .",
    "the factor @xmath18 is sizable at large values of @xmath19 and in most of the phase space measured so far , @xmath17 is a small correction .",

    "this flux factor approach is consistent with the data within the present uncertainties for @xmath33 . at larger @xmath2 values , a second term has to be introduced which can be interpreted as reggeon exchange : @xmath34 this is illustrated in fig .",
