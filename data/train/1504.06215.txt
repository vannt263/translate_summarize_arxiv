    "studies of cluster variables ( rr lyrae stars ) date back to the end of the 19th century .",
    "the large number of the variables discovered in galactic and extragalactic globular clusters ( gcs ) provided a decisive support to specify the main physical properties and the evolutionary status of rr lyrae stars . because of the large distance ( @xmath5 kpc ) and the relatively small absolute dimension ( total radius , @xmath6  pc ) of gcs , the apparent magnitudes of the cluster members reflect the distribution of their absolute magnitudes with @xmath7% accuracy ( supposing that the foreground / intra - cluster reddening is homogeneous ) .",
    "the advantage that the relative values of the physical properties of gc stars can be determined more accurately than for any other stellar population makes gc studies very prosperous .",
    "while numerous studies of fundamental - mode rr lyrae stars ( rrab ) have appeared year by year in the literature , this is not the case for the overtone ( rrc ) variables . as rrc stars are relatively rare objects and the similarity of their light - curves to w uma binaries makes even the target selection dubious ,",
    "hence only a few field rrc stars have been the subject of detailed photometric and/or spectroscopic studies .",
    "the photometric data of gcs showed that about 30% of their rr lyrae populations are overtone and double - mode ( rrd ) pulsators @xcite .",
    "rrd stars have always been in the focus of the interest because of their astrophysical importance , and the discovery of peculiar features in the pulsations of rrc stars ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "* and references therein ) has attracted a special attention to overtone rr lyrae stars recently . higher order or multiple pulsations together with modulation or period doubling",
    "make these stars to unique targets of theoretical investigations .",
    "the complex and interrelated dynamical features can give strong constraints on non - linear physics governing their variability and pose a new challenge to further theoretical work , providing a test bed for improved models .",
    "thanks to the new data secured by space missions ( corot , kepler : * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and ground - based projects @xcite , a lot of new results were published in the recent years concerning the blazhko effect ; the amplitude and/or phase modulation of the pulsation of rr lyrae stars . despite these observational results and the accompanying theoretical efforts revealing the genuine origin of the phenomenon",
    "has eluded explanation yet .",
    "the modulation was detected in about 50% of the rrab stars @xcite , but no reliable blazhko statistics exists for overtone variables .",
    "one of the most intriguing new question of overtone rr lyrae and cepheid stars is the recent discovery of a peculiar frequency at 0.61 frequency ratio in many of these variables ( * ? ? ?",

    "the interpretation of this strange signal is hard in the recent theoretical framework because of its unknown excitation mechanism .",

    "the changes in the frequency spectrum of v79 is documented in fig .  [ 79 ] .",
    "only the substantially different solutions are shown .",
    "preceding the emergence of the overtone mode , the fundamental mode frequency had been splitted into two components and the amplitudes of the components had been transposed . besides the dominant frequencies observed at 2.0711 and 2.0843  d@xmath11 , residual signal appeared at 2.087 and 2.0743  d@xmath11 frequencies in the 1988 and @xmath14 photographic data , respectively . the combined 1998 ccd data ( h05 , b06 , and cg99 ) showed the dominant fundamental frequency at 2.0865  d@xmath11 but a frequency component at 2.0719  d@xmath11 appeared in this data set , too .",

    "the frequency of the strongest modulation component equals with the fundamental - mode frequency ( 2.085  d@xmath11 ) observed during the double - mode phase .",

    "moreover , the much larger decrease of the magnitude averaged brightness may be the consequence of that sinusoidal overtone - mode was dominant in @xmath12 but the large - amplitude , asymmetric rrab - type light curve observed in 2009 and 2012 is strongly nonlinear .",
    "consequently , the observed increase of the intensity - averaged mean magnitudes may also arise , at least partly , from the differences of the light - curve shapes . + *",

    "no difference between the amplitude ratios of the fundamental and first - overtone modes larger than expected from the uncertainties is seen between the solutions of the h05 , b06 , and the d12 data .",
    "the amplitude changes of the modes found by c04 between the 1992 and 1993 + 1997 seasons are probably the consequence of the inadequacy of the data sampling and the mistaken frequency identification .",

    "although the frequencies identified by b06 are indeed the largest amplitude signals in the fourier spectrum of the data , a solution with frequency values close to the results of the d12 data fits the observations with 7% smaller residual scatter .",
    "c04 reported significant amplitude changes of the modes , however , the d12 data do not show any frequency in the residual spectrum at the radial modes indicating that the light curves of the modes are stable . + * v252 * the c01 observations of v252 are not publicly available .",
    "the combined h05 and b06 data yield a similar solution as the d12 data .",
    "+            our analysis shows that in normal - period - ratio rrd stars of m3 ( v68 , v87 , v125 , v200 , v251 , and v252 ) either the overtone mode is dominant or the fundamental mode has a similar amplitude as the overtone .",
    "the majority of the known rrd stars share this property . based on the results given in table  [ dm.tab ] ,",
    "the modal content , i.e. , the frequencies , and the amplitude- and period - ratios of v68 and v87 have been stable during the century covered by the observations .",
    "most probably , v125 , at the blue border of the double - mode region , is in the stage of the fall - off of the weak fundamental - mode component .",
    "this is supported by the similarity of the periods , amplitudes , colors and the light curves shapes of v125 and v126 ( the longest - period not over - luminous rrc star in m3 ) .",
    "we suppose that the differences between the amplitude ratios and the frequencies published in c01 , c04 , h05 and b06 and obtained from the d12 data for v200 , v251 , and v252 do not reflect real changes of the double - mode properties of these stars , but arise from the strong aliasing problems of the previous data , which may have biased the previous frequency determinations .",
    "we conclude that the pulsation properties of double - mode stars with normal period ratio are stable , they do not change significantly on a timescale of about a century in m3 .",
    "rr lyrae stars showing blazhko effect were first reported by @xcite .",
    "a detailed analysis of these special variables found in the ogle galactic bulge collection were published recently by @xcite .",
    "it is also probable that long - period blazhko modulation accounts for the detected changes of the amplitude ratios of the radial modes of nsvs 5222076 @xcite .",
    "the blazhko modulation of 1o/2o double - mode cepheids were discussed in detail by @xcite .",
    "modulation is observed among 1o/2o lmc cepheids either in both modes or neither of them @xcite .",
    "the same is true for f/1o double - mode rr lyrae stars in m3 .",
    "however , despite of the large amplitude modulations of the f and 1o modes , the small - amplitude 2o mode of v13 is not modulated .",
    "@xcite explained the anti - phase modulations of the radial modes of cepheids by non - stationary resonant coupling of one radial mode with the another radial or a non - radial mode , and with the sharing on the excitation sources between the two radial modes .",
    "resonances are in fact detected in cepheids , e.g. a 2:1 resonance produces well - seen features of the light curve of bump - cepheids .",
    "therefore , we have checked whether the light curves of the radial modes of the blazhko double - mode stars show any systematic difference from the light curves of other double - mode stars and from single - mode rr lyrae stars .",

    "the only conspicuous difference between the light curves of the blazhko and non - blazhko double - mode stars is that the overtone mode is the dominant mode ( or the modes have similar amplitudes : v200 , v251 , v252 ) in rrd stars without light - curve modulation , while the fundamental mode has larger amplitude than the overtone in blazhko rrd stars .",
    "there is no well seen distortion in the mean light curves of the radial modes of blazhko stars ( see in fig .  [ lcd ] ) .",
    "the fundamental - mode light curves of both blazhko and non - blazhko rrd stars differ from the light curves of single - mode rrab stars systematically , however , the lack of the higher - order harmonic components in rrd stars may explain the differences mostly .    none of the light curves at different blazhko phases shown in fig .",
    "[ blfig ] indicates that any resonance would affect their shapes either .",
    "amplitude and phase modulations of both modes of the blazhko double - mode stars are evident , however the light curve is smooth in each blazhko phase . only the fundamental mode of v44 displays irregularities , but this is produced by the complexity of the modulation probably .",

    "contrary to the single signals of the radial modes of normal period - ratio rrd stars , the frequency spectrum of blazhko rrd stars are comprised from multiplets at the fundamental- and the overtone - mode frequencies .",
    "the highest - amplitude frequency belongs to the fundamental mode in these stars .",
    "the data given in table  [ dm.tab ] and figs .  [ 13 ] , [ 44 ] and  [ 79 ] indicate that in blazhko rrd stars not only the period ratios are anomalous , but from time to time , a different component of the multiplets is the dominant component . ogle - blg - rrlyr-02530 @xcite seems to be a similar case .",
    "we have also checked whether any pair of the components of the multiplets would yield a period ratio in the required , @xmath35 range .",
    "however , the mystery of the anomalous period ratios of blazhko rrd stars can not be resolved in this way ; none of the components of the multiplets can give a proper period ratio .",
    "connected to the switch between the single- and double - mode states ( just preceding or following it ) , as large as @xmath36  d@xmath11 jumps of the fundamental - mode frequency ( @xmath37  d jumps in the periods ) are detected in the blazhko rrd stars , v13 , v44 , and v79 .",
    "the frequency shift preceding the switch to double - mode stage is always positive ( the period is decreasing ) and it is accompanied by a strong amplitude decrease of the fundamental mode in all these stars .",
    "blazhko rrab stars are known to show large , irregular , rapid period changes ( j12 ) , however , all these changes are at least about an order of a magnitude smaller than the period changes observed in blazhko double - mode stars .",
    "the switch from double - mode to fundamental - mode pulsation of ogle - blg - rrlyr-12245 @xcite was accompanied by a 0.0005 d period increase ( @xmath27 d@xmath11 in frequency ) .",
    "the period change was attributed to a nonlinear shift caused by the four - times increase of the amplitude of the fundamental mode by @xcite .",
    "although simultaneously with the appearance of the overtone mode , amplitude decrease of the fundamental - mode of v13 , v44 , and v79 are also detected , as their period shifts are about an order of a magnitude larger than in ogle - blg - rrlyr-12245 , therefore , nonlinearity can not explain the observed frequency shifts in these stars completely .",
    "the displacement of the frequencies corresponds to the modulation frequency ( half of it in v13 ) indicating that , instead of real frequency changes , the modulation is so strong that the side frequency has the largest amplitude in these cases .",
    "the dominant component is the @xmath38 frequency in the double - mode stage of these three stars .",
    "thus , the anomalously low period ratios would become even lower if the pre - rrd frequency of the fundamental - mode were taken as the real fundamental - mode frequency in v13 and v44 .",
    "anomalous period ratios are detected mostly ( probably exclusively ) in blazhko rrd stars .",
    "assuming that pulsation models give correct results for the period ratios of rr lyrae stars ( as in the case for non - blazhko rrd stars ) we have to think that the stellar structure of blazhko and non - blazhko stars should be different in order to explain the anomalous period ratios of blazhko rrd stars .",
