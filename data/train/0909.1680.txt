    "the quest for strategies for combatting decoherence is of paramount importance to the control of open quantum systems , particularly for quantum information operations @xcite .",
    "a prevailing _ unitary _ strategy aimed at suppressing decoherence is dynamical decoupling ( dd ) @xcite , which consists , in the case of a qubit , in the application of strong and fast pulses alternating along orthogonal bloch - sphere axes , e.g. , @xmath0 and @xmath1 . in the frequency domain , where the decoherence rate can be described as overlap between the spectra of the pulse - driven ( modulated ) system and the bath @xcite ,",
    "dd is tantamount to shifting the driven - system resonances beyond the bath cutoff frequencies . the dd efficacy can be enhanced for _ certain _ bath spectra upon choosing the timings of the pulses so as to reduce the low - frequency parts in the system spectrum and thus its overlap with the low - frequency portion of the bath spectrum @xcite .",
    "dd sequences are inherently _ binary _ , i.e. , their pulsed control parameters are discretely switched on or off .",
    "realistically , the finiteness of pulse durations and spacings sets an upper limit on the speed and fidelity of dd - assisted quantum gate operations @xcite .",
    "an alternative strategy formulated here in full generality is _ analog unitary control _ of multidimensional systems subject to _ any _ noise or decoherence .",
    "it is effected by a system hamiltonian whose time - dependence is variationally tailored to optimally perform a desired gate operation .",
    "the vast additional freedom of non - discrete ( smooth ) hamiltonian parametrization significantly enhances the efficacy of decoherence control under realistic constraints compatible with the non - markov time scales required for such control . its formulation meets the long - standing conceptual challenge of _ simultaneously _ controlling non - commuting system operators subject to noise along _ orthogonal _ axes .",
    "this is here achieved by working in an optimally rotated , different basis at each instant .",
    "the price we pay for such general optimal control is the need for at least partial knowledge of the bath or noise spectrum , which is _ experimentally _ accessible @xcite without the need for microscopic models .",
    "the goal is to _ minimize its overlap _ with the spectrum of the controlled system , as was already shown for pure dephasing of qubits @xcite .",
    "we assume that the system hamiltonian @xmath2 implements a desired quantum gate operation at time @xmath3 , and aim at designing it so as to minimize the decoherence and noise errors .",
    "the system - bath interaction @xmath4 then acquires time - dependence in the interaction picture under the action of @xmath2 and the bath hamiltonian @xmath5 . assuming factorized initial states of the system and the bath , @xmath6 @xmath7 @xmath8 , tracing over the bath , and further assuming that @xmath9 $ ] @xmath7 @xmath10 , yields for the system state @xmath11 the integrated ( exact ) deviation from the initial state ( app.a ) , @xmath12.\\quad \\label{nzi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in what follows , we assume that up to @xmath3 , the combined system - bath state changes only weakly compared to @xmath4 , so that we approximate in ( [ nzi ] ) @xmath13 in the integral .",
    "this means that the control is assumed effective enough to allow only _ small errors _ , consistently with the first order approximation of the solutions of both the nakajima - zwanzig and the time - convolutionless master equations @xcite . to justify this assumption",
    ", we try to reduce the discrepancy between the states evolved for time @xmath3 in the presence and absence of the bath by minimizing @xmath14 @xmath15 @xmath16 averaged over _ all initial states _",
