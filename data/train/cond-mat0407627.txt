    "the study of ultra - cold molecules produced in atomic bose and fermi gases is one of the most important developments in cold atom physics @xcite .",
    "one of the most successful experimental techniques to produce molecules in atomic bose - einstein condensates utilised adiabatic sweeps of a magnetic field tunable feshbach resonance level across the zero energy threshold of the colliding atoms , during which a highly excited diatomic vibrational bound state could be efficiently populated @xcite . in this paper",
    "we study a coherent superposition of an atomic condensate and molecules .",
    "the production of such a coherent superposition in a degenerate gas of bosons , demonstrated in refs .",
    "@xcite , is a remarkable achievement , given the marked difference in the relevant energy and time scales for condensates and molecules .",
    "these experiments employed a sequence of two magnetic field pulses each of which rapidly approached the position of the zero energy resonance ( the magnetic field strength at which the scattering length has a singularity ) on the side supporting the highly excited diatomic vibrational bound state .",
    "the two pulses were separated by an evolution period of variable duration as a function of which the oscillations in the final condensate populations were observed .",
    "this achievement offers the possibility of precise interferometric measurements of the energies of the relevant states through the measurement of bulk properties of the gas .",
    "it is the theory of such measurements we present in this paper .",
    "we set up the theory in a way that reflects properly the analogy with ramsey  separated pulse ",
    "interferometers with the splitting and recombination occurring during the magnetic field pulses at the beginning and the end of the magnetic field sequence , respectively .",
    "we give a complementary account of the experiment which emphasises the interferometer picture and will , we believe , be of greater utility to those analysing experiments than just the simulation on its own can do .    to provide a simple intuitive physical description of the experiments , we first consider the evolution of a single pair of cold trapped atoms subjected to the experimental pulse sequence .",
    "we show that the first pulse splits the initial state of the pair into three different components ( interferometer arms ) .",
    "the bound state component evolves most quickly .",
    "the other components are a superposition of excited quasi continuum states and the lowest energetic quasi continuum state , which are the two - body analogues of the experimentally observed @xcite burst of atoms and the remnant bose - einstein condensate , respectively . after a variable period of time , referred to as the evolution period ,",
    "during which the bound and free states evolve almost independently , the second pulse recombines the components .",
    "the final state of the pair depends sensitively on the phase differences built up between the amplitudes of the various components during the evolution period . as a consequence , oscillations in the resulting populations of the three components of the pair wave function",
    "are observed as the time between the pulses is varied .",
    "we shall show that the oscillation frequency is determined by the energy of the molecular bound state populated in the process .",
    "the visibility of these oscillations , i.e.  ramsey fringes , depends on both the efficiency of populating the bound state during the first pulse and of dissociating the molecules during the second pulse of the sequence .",
    "we observe that these quantities are very sensitive to both the details of the underlying two - body physics and the precise duration and shape of the pulses .",
    "we provide analytic estimates of the molecular production and dissociation efficiencies and give an analogy between the function of the pulses and the concept of two colour photo - association of molecules .",
    "we extend this description of a single pair of atoms in order to apply it to a gas of atoms by using a coarse graining procedure . in this approach",
    "the populations of the different components of the gas are obtained , following classical probability theory , by averaging over the microscopic transition probabilities for all pairs .",
    "we show that this straightforward but systematic extension of the two - body physics recovers the experimental observations rather well , in terms of the oscillation frequency , the amplitude and the relative populations of all three components present in the gas .    in order to disentangle the two - body and many - body aspects of ramsey interferometry with cold gases ,",
    "we have also used the genuinely many - body microscopic quantum dynamics approach to the dynamics of partly condensed bose gases @xcite .",
    "we base our full simulations on the non - markovian non - linear schrdinger equation of the first order microscopic quantum dynamics approach .",
    "this equation describes the evolution of the condensate along with the dynamics of pair correlations .",
    "the method describes fully and quantitatively the evolution of the states produced by magnetic pulse shape induced rapid changes in the hamiltonian describing the inter - atomic potential .",
    "in particular , the microscopic quantum dynamics approach incorporates the entire binary collision dynamics in a non - perturbative manner .",
    "we shall see that the many - body phenomena affect both the frequency and visibility of the ramsey fringes . in the first step in this direction",
    ", we have found an analytical solution of the non - markovian equation using a perturbative approximation . in agreement with the experimental observations ,",
    "we show that the frequencies of the ramsey fringes are shifted upwards with respect to the value associated with the energy of the weakly bound molecular state populated in the process .",
    "this shift persists for all values of the magnetic field , it does , however , become hard to discern above @xmath1 ( the value of the magnetic field strength between the pulses ) higher than roughly @xmath2 g. away from the zero energy resonance the shift is given , as one might reasonably expect , by roughly twice the chemical potential .",
    "the shift is typically a small correction to the oscillation frequency , and a time scale much longer than the typical pulse durations of the experiments @xcite would be required for it to be fully resolved .",
    "the visibility of the ramsey fringes is reduced in comparison with the two - body result due to the non - linear dynamics of the atomic condensate mean field .",
    "our analytic studies apply when the experiments @xcite are operated in what we shall term the `` interferometer mode '' , i.e.  when the magnetic field strength @xmath1 during the evolution period is sufficiently far away from the zero energy resonance for two- and many - body phenomena to be disentangled . in this regime of magnetic field strengths @xmath1 the gas is weakly interacting during the evolution period and no significant population exchange between the bound and unbound components occurs .",
    "the different components are then orthogonal as they should be in an ideal ramsey interferometer .",
    "et al_.  @xcite also performed measurements in the close vicinity of the zero energy resonance , where the gas is subject to a non - equilibrium dynamics even between the pulses . for all experimentally studied cases we have performed full simulations of the non - markovian equation for the trap geometry and atom number employed in the experiments . in the regime very close to the zero energy resonance",
    "the non - linear aspects of the dynamics are especially significant , and the description of the experiment in terms of an ideal ramsey interferometer is not as clear , because the three components of the gas are no longer orthogonal . the full numerical simulation does not rely on this assumption and is , therefore , essential in the comparison with experimental data for this regime .",
    "we should emphasise that in this region the idea that we can clearly separate molecules and atoms is also breaking down as the spatial extent of the molecular bound state wave function approaches the mean distance between the atoms in the gas @xcite .",
    "this makes the simple picture invalid as well as any theory that relies on such a distinction .",
    "one might be misled in this analysis if one focused purely on the component of the molecular bound state in the bare resonance level that remains , of course , very small in extent .",
    "our analysis shows , for instance , that the frequently used two level mean field approach of refs .",
    "@xcite , fails entirely to describe the interferometric experiments of refs .",
    "@xcite , despite the fact that it can provide accurate predictions on the final molecular fractions in feshbach resonance crossing experiments @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite a modified two level mean field approach was applied to the observations of ref .",
    "@xcite , in which the energy of the bare feshbach resonance level was tuned to recover the binding energy of the molecules produced in the experiments @xcite .",
    "this approach recovered the magnitude of the fringe frequencies of ref .",
    "@xcite after adjusting the densities used in the theory .",
    "we believe , however , that such a treatment is inconsistent because any two level approach crucially lacks the excited energy levels of the background scattering continuum @xcite .",
    "this treatment obviously leads to the absence of the experimentally observed burst component of atoms @xcite in the theory .",
    "the two level approach of ref .",
    "@xcite also inevitably misrepresents the molecular bound state @xcite produced in the experiments @xcite , as this bound state is even dominated by its component in the background scattering continuum .",
    "the ramsey fringes predicted by our dynamical simulations of the non - markovian equation recover all the systematic trends observed in the experiment .",
    "for magnetic fields away from the zero energy resonance , the ramsey fringes are essentially undamped on the comparatively short time scales of the pulse sequences and their frequencies are only slightly shifted with respect to the value determined from the energy of the weakly bound molecular state .",
    "closer to the zero energy resonance , a significant decoherence of the ramsey fringes has been observed in the experiment , a feature also predicted by our many - body approach .",
    "we also recover the substantial upward shift of the fringe frequencies for the magnetic field strengths closest to the zero energy resonance , for which the shift was attributed in ref .",
    "we show that this shift can be interpreted in terms of a measure of the extent to which diatomic molecules in the highly excited vibrational state can be considered as a separate entity of the gas .",
    "our studies also strongly indicate that the significant experimentally @xcite observed loss of condensate atoms , which is particularly clear for longer pulse sequences with the magnetic field strength @xmath1 in the close vicinity of the zero energy resonance , is essentially determined by the same parameters of the binary interactions that determine the frequency and visibility of the fringe pattern .",
    "this observation implies that deeply inelastic loss phenomena such as resonance enhanced spin relaxation of @xmath0rb atoms @xcite , are unlikely to play a significant role in the experiments @xcite .",
    "both the two - body and many - body pictures presented in this paper reveal the remarkable sensitivity of these experiments to the details of the underlying two - body physics , details that are clouded over in experiments involving molecular production using linear crossing of a feshbach resonance @xcite . the interferometric technique , therefore , offers a rather unique probe of the microscopic collision physics through observing the macroscopic bulk properties of the gas .",
    "in this section we provide a physical explanation for the experimental fringe patterns reported in refs .",
    "@xcite in terms of general properties of a ramsey interferometer .",
    "we then provide a very direct determination of the frequency and visibility of the ramsey fringes in terms of the dynamics of a single pair of atoms .",
    "we then present the first order many - body corrections to the frequency and visibility obtained from the microscopic quantum dynamics approach of refs .",
    "this allows us to distinguish pure two - body contributions to the interference between atoms and molecules from many - body phenomena related to the coherent nature of the partially condensed bose gas .      in the experiments of refs .",

    "we have shown that the degree to which these phenomena influence the fringe pattern can be interpreted as a measure of the extent to which molecules in the highest excited diatomic vibrational bound state can be identified as a separate entity of the gas .",
    "our simulations indicate that even in the physical regime close to the zero energy resonance , in which the pulse sequences are sufficiently long to reveal a decay of the condensate , the non - equilibrium dynamics is determined mainly by the same physical parameters of the binary interaction potential as in the interferometer mode .",
