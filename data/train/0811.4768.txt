    "we use the term _ protodisc _ to refer to the disc region that is initially formed when wind material from a star is channelled by dipole - type magnetic fields towards the equatorial plane .",
    "the material in a protodisc region has no radial motion and rotates with the magnetic field .",
    "it is bounded above and below by shock boundaries .",
    "we develop models for the structure and evolution of protodiscs around magnetic rotator stars .",
    "we study protodiscs as separate entities while recognising that they may be precursors of quasi - steady discs , such as those of be stars .",
    "we do not construct models of quasi - steady discs in this paper but indicate how protodiscs relate to models of be star discs .",
    "for example , a protodisc region could initially be present in the inner part of the quasi - steady disc model with slow outflow studied by @xcite .",
    "also , a more detailed study of protodiscs is important to verify how centrifugal outflow in protodiscs of rapidly rotating stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) affects the formation of quasi - steady discs around magnetic rotator stars . in this paper",
    "we consider protodiscs around stellar models with both uniform and differential rotation .",
    "we study how their radial extents change with time and we determine the conditions under which mri will occur to affect the angular velocity distribution and the radial outflow in the disc region .",
    "there has been a tremendous increase in observations of emission line b stars , including polarisation , interferometry and magnetic diagnostics , but the question of how discs with near keplerian rotation speeds are formed around them is has not been fully answered .",
    "there can be other mechanisms that are responsible for disc formation in different stars depending on their properties .",
    "for example , @xcite have proposed a decretion disc model for be stars with near maximal rotation speeds .",
    "there is no magnetic force in their model and angular momentum is transported by viscous forces .",
    "be stars are known to rotate rapidly ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the presence of significant magnetic fields in ob stars has been reported by several authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the concept of a wind compressed disc was initially developed by @xcite .",
    "subsequently , @xcite proposed a magnetically torqued disk(mtd ) model in which a sufficiently strong magnetic field channels a flow of wind material towards the equatorial plane to form a disc and provides the torque required by the disc to maintain quasi - keplerian rotation speeds .",
    "@xcite developed the magnetic rotator wind disk(mrwd ) model in which keplerian discs may be formed with stellar magnetic fields that do not have to be as strong as those required in the mtd model .",
    "@xcite presented an amended version of the mtd model to include stellar gravity darkening and @xcite suggested that this should be further modified to include the effect of gravity arising from finite thickness of the disc .",
    "@xcite have studied the properties of discs with slow radial outflow and address criticisms of the mtd model .    in the mrwd model for rotating stars with winds , when magnetic field lines that emerge from the stellar surface loop back to the star , a transient disc that has no meridional motion and corotates with the star is initially formed .",
    "after the local density in the disc has increased to a value where the centrifugal force exceeds the sum of gravity and the magnetic force , material diffuses radially outwards while stretching out the magnetic field lines .",
    "@xcite suggested that such material can diffuse into quasi - steady discs and that the presence of viscosity during this stage would enable the formation of keplerian discs of larger radial extent . on the other hand ,",
    "numerical simulations by @xcite for the flow of wind material along dipole magnetic field lines display centrifugal breakout in the form of transient bursts and they concluded that mtd type models were not appropriate to explain disc formation .",
    "however , there are problems with their simulations : ( a ) as pointed out by @xcite they did not follow changes for a sufficiently long duration of time .",
    "( b ) the simulations are essentially two dimensional .",
    "( c ) numerical mhd simulations do not always provide accurate results because discretization of the mhd induction equation leads to the introduction of artificial magnetic diffusivity that is several orders of magnitude larger than the real magnetic diffusivity in discs .",
    "this can yield spurious results for magnetic reconnection that may not be realistic .",
    "( d ) their models fail to consider differentially rotating stars and , therefore , do not obtain differentially rotating disc regions that are subject to the onset of mri .",
    "the occurrence of mri can significantly affect the rotation speed in a disc region .",
    "we carry out an analytical study and obtain time - dependent solutions for uniform and differentially rotating stars .",
    "we find that when the stellar angular velocity increases along the surface towards the equator there is a broad range of stellar parameters for which mri occurs in a sufficiently large part of the protodisc region .",
    "we consider a stellar model in which the magnetic field is dipole - type over some region of the stellar surface , so that field lines leaving the stellar surface pass through the equatorial plane and return to the star .",
    "wind material flowing along such lines is channelled into a dense equatorial protodisc region .",
    "since the flow of supersonic wind material into this region from above and below are in opposite directions , this material will cross shock surfaces that form the upper and lower boundaries of the disc region .",
    "we refer to the region between the sonic surface of the wind and the shock boundary of the disc as the _ wind zone_. thus , we need not be concerned about gas pressure effects on the wind flow , which is treated in an empirical fashion in that the velocity is chosen to obey a beta law and the density is assumed to follow from a global mass conservation relation . in section [ sec - windzone ] , we set up the relevant properties of axially symmetric wind zones that enable us to determine values of physical quantities at points on the wind side of the shock boundary from known values at the stellar surface .",
    "we develop formalism to account for the presence of differential rotation along the region of the stellar surface from which wind material flows into the disc region .",
    "the material in a protodisc region has no radial motion and rotates with magnetic field lines because the centrifugal and pressure gradient forces that are directed outwards are balanced by gravity and magnetic force . in section [ sec - proto - region ]",
    "we describe the general concept of a protodisc , which is a more generalised version of the pre - keplerian disc developed in the mrwd model .",
    "also , we describe the physical processes that are involved in their formation and evolution . in section [ sec - shock - proto - jump - conditions ] , we develop mhd generalisations of the rankine - hugoniot jump conditions that are appropriate for shock boundaries of protodiscs so that we can compute changes in values of quantities across shock surfaces .",
    "we take into account the vertical motion of shock surfaces caused by continuous filling up of a protodisc region by wind material .    in section [ sec - disc - proto - eqns ]",
    ", we develop the equations that govern the structure of the models of protodiscs that we consider .",
    "we explicitly include the effect of the component of stellar gravity perpendicular to discs and , because of shock heating of the disc region , we include the vertical and radial components of the thermal pressure gradient in the respective momentum equations for protodiscs .",
    "even though the heights of protodiscs may be relatively small , the presence of a vertical component of stellar gravity leads to a vertical gradient of pressure and density .",
    "the equatorial density of material in the protodisc increases with time as the disc fills up .",
    "this has the effect of increasing the centrifugal force in relation to the magnetic force as well as increasing the thermal pressure in relation to magnetic pressure .",
    "the first of these effects tends to cause material at the outer edge of a protodisc to move radially outwards whereas the latter leads to the onset of mri within the protodisc . to determine the relative importance of these competing effects , in section [ sec - onset - mri - protodiscs ] we derive criteria that influence the evolution of protodiscs",
    ". also , we discuss the conditions under which the shrinking of a protodisc caused by centrifugal outflow is halted by the onset of mri .",
    "this leads to viscous readjustment of the rotation speed of the disc region . in section [ sec - disc - proto - applics - results ] , we apply our equations and jump conditions to protodiscs of different stellar models and present the results of our computations . in section [ sec - evln - protodisc - after - mri ] ,",
    "we discuss important factors that affect the evolution of protodisc material after the onset of mri and refer to some relevant quasi - steady models .",
    "our conclusions regarding the formation and evolution of protodiscs around rotating magnetic stars with winds are summarised in section [ sec - discussion ] .",
    "an important objective of this paper is to relate the properties of protodisc regions to values of quantities at the stellar surface .",
    "therefore , we include all the equations that are necessary to solve for the different physical quantities in the wind zone , at the shock surface and in the protodisc region .",
    "in this section we present the equations that are used to determine the values of different physical quantities at points on the wind side of the shock boundary in terms of their values at the stellar surface .",
    "we assume that the wind zone is in a steady state and is isothermal .",
    "the mass , luminosity , radius and effective temperature of the star are @xmath1 and @xmath2 respectively .",
    "we use an inertial frame of reference with spherical coordinates @xmath3 in the wind zone and cylindrical coordinates @xmath4 in the disc region .",
    "we assume that the star , wind and magnetic field are symmetrical about the axis of rotation .",
    "let the angular velocity at any point @xmath5 on the stellar surface be @xmath6 , which may vary with latitude along the stellar surface .",
    "we show in section [ sec - proto - region ] that stellar models with appropriate differential rotation will have protodiscs that satisfy a condition that is necessary for the occurrence of mri .",
    "all the equations that we set up for the wind zone are valid even when @xmath6 varies along the stellar surface provided that the model is axially symmetric .",
    "we define an associated rotation rate parameter @xmath7 for the point @xmath5 by the equation @xmath8^{1/2 } \\ , { \\mathcal s}_\\star$ ] .",
    "if the star has uniform rotation , then @xmath6 is constant for the star and @xmath7 gives the ratio of the equatorial rotation speed of the star to the keplerian rotation speed . otherwise , @xmath7 will vary with @xmath6 along the stellar surface .",
    "let @xmath9 and @xmath10 denote density and magnetic field , respectively .",
    "we use @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively , to denote velocities in the wind zone and the disc region .",

    "let @xmath16 be a point of impact of wind material on the shock boundary .",
    "subscripts @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively , denote values of quantities on the wind side and the disc side at the point @xmath16 . let the meridional magnetic field line that emerges from the point @xmath5 on the star pass through the point @xmath16 on the shock surface",
    ".    equations for the wind zone were set up in @xcite using the steady state equations given by @xcite .",
    "initial values of different quantities in the wind zone are specified at the sonic surface and are denoted using subscript @xmath19 .",
    "the mhd induction gives @xmath20 , which implies that the meridional vectors @xmath21 and @xmath22 must be parallel to each other . hence , the streamlines of flow in a meridional plane in the wind zone coincide with magnetic field lines .",

    "will be functions of @xmath30 . in our models",
    ", we take the sonic surface to be approximately spherical so that @xmath28 is constant . if the stellar mass loss rate @xmath31 , is known only as an average value for the star rather than as a function of @xmath30 ,",

    "the azimuthal field @xmath34 is negative in the northern hemisphere of the wind zone so that field lines curve in the direction opposite to that of rotation . since wind material flows along field lines , the rotation speed of the wind material is less than the corotation speed as verified in equation ( [ eqn - wind - v - phi - omega ] ) . in our stellar models ,",
    "the material flowing into the disc region encounter the shock boundary before it could reach the alfvn point .",
    "the azimuthal torque equation for the wind can be written in the form @xmath35 where @xmath36 is constant along a streamline and may be interpreted as total angular momentum per unit mass . each field line in the wind zone is associated with a characteristic density @xmath37 and a characteristic distance @xmath38 from the rotation axis .",
    "these are given by @xmath39 and @xmath40 in general , the values of @xmath37 and @xmath38 will vary with the latitude of the point @xmath5 on the stellar surface from which the corresponding field line emerges .",
    "note that a streamline that does not enter the disc region but travels with the wind to a large distance will have an alfvn point where @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "however , for streamlines that enter the shock boundary of a protodisc region , there is no point in the wind zone where @xmath9 and @xmath43 are equal to these alfvn values but we define them as streamline constants because we can use them to compute the rotation speed and azimuthal component of the magnetic field at any point in the wind zone .",
    "we solve equations ( [ eqn - wind - v - phi - omega ] ) and ( [ eqn - wind - azimuthal ] ) to obtain the values of the @xmath44-components of the wind velocity and magnetic field .",

    "however , for @xmath52 there is a nonzero meridional component of the magnetic force . as was pointed in the earlier paper , even if @xmath51 at the stellar surface its value will be less than 3 in the wind zone because the field lines will be stretched out to some extent by the wind material .",

    "let @xmath70 be the innermost point on the equatorial plane where local keplerian rotation speed equals the corotation speed .",

    ", the value of the meridional alfvn parameter @xmath74 must be larger than unity at all points along a streamline from the star to the shock surface .",

    "values of @xmath75 are approximately 1 g for b5 or b9 stars , 10 g for b2 stars , 60 g to 80 g for b0 stars and of the order of 100 g for o type stars .",
    "our interest is in stars with magnetic fields that are only slightly stronger than these minimum values so that they are able to channel wind flow into a protodisc region . in this paper",
    "we consider models of o and b type stars shown in table [ table - star - properties ] with rapid rotation such that @xmath76 .",
    "here , we describe the physical properties of protodiscs and the processes involved in their formation and evolution . a magnetic field of sufficient strength in a hot rotating star channels the flow of wind material from the star into an equatorial region .",
    "furthermore , in some part of this region , the field lines initially loop back to the star and the magnetic force is strong enough to provide support against centrifugal force so that the material accumulates to form a protodisc with no meridional motion .",

    "we use subscript @xmath78 to denote the normal component of a vector at the shock boundary in the direction from the wind zone into the disc region .",

    "let @xmath87 and @xmath88 shown in figure [ fig1 ] be the innermost and outermost points of the region in the equatorial plane where the magnetic force is strong enough to prevent radial motion against the effects of the centrifugal , gravitational and thermal pressure forces .",
    "the point @xmath87 will be located very close to the point @xmath70 and its position will be influenced by the radial components of the magnetic and thermal pressure force in addition to gravity and centrifugal force .",
    "a protodisc will form in the region between the points @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "wind material arriving between the stellar equator and @xmath87 will tend to fall back towards the stellar surface because the sum of gravity and magnetic force dominates the sum of centrifugal and pressure forces .",

    "the protodisc region has super - keplerian rotation speed . as this region fills up , the density at points along the equatorial plane increases and the centrifugal force increases relative to the sum of gravity and magnetic force .",
    "while the location of @xmath87 remains fixed , centrifugal outflow causes the outer edge of a protodisc @xmath88 to move towards @xmath87 as time @xmath91 increases , provided that factors such as mri do not intervene . at the same time",
    ", the continuing impact of wind material on the shock boundary causes the protodisc to heat up . the thermal pressure can rise to values where it exceeds the local magnetic pressure and",

    "there will be an onset of mri when the two conditions @xmath95 are satisfied @xcite .",
    "then , viscosity will become an important factor in the rotation of the disc region and the magnetic field will be affected by turbulence resulting from mri .",
    "in general , the angular velocity @xmath6 of the region of the stellar surface from which material flows to a protodisc region will vary with latitude . from section [ sec - windzone ] , we know that @xmath6 is constant along a meridional magnetic field line in the wind zone . in our model of a protodisc , each magnetic field line from the stellar surface that enters the protodisc region is continuous across the protodisc and returns to the stellar surface . in the case of stars that have differential rotation in which @xmath6 increases along the stellar surface from the point @xmath90 to the point @xmath89 , if the shock boundary of the protodisc is stationary , the protodisc rotation theorem established in @xcite shows that there will be a corresponding decrease in the angular velocity @xmath93 of the protodisc region from @xmath87 to @xmath88 .",
    "that is , the second of the two necessary conditions ( [ eqn - disc - proto - mri - conditions ] ) , @xmath96 , for the onset of mri in protodiscs is satisfied when the angular velocity @xmath6 increases along the stellar surface towards the stellar equator and the shock boundary of the protodisc is stationary . in section [ sec - onset - mri - protodiscs ]",
    ", we consider the case where the shock boundary of the protodisc is not stationary but moves so that its height changes with time . here too , results of numerical computations presented in section [ sec - disc - proto - applics - results ] show that for appropriate models of differential rotation of the star where @xmath6 increases towards the equator , the condition @xmath96 is satisfied in the protodisc .",
    "the first condition for the onset of mri will be satisfied when the increase in density and shock heating of the protodisc region cause @xmath97 to become larger than unity .",
    "@xcite have also shown that the rapidly growing modes increase exponentially on a time scale of order @xmath98 seconds .",
    "the rotation time scale for the protodisc region is @xmath99 seconds .",
    "thus , mri will occur on a time scale that is even shorter than the rotation time scale when the necessary conditions for the onset of mri are satisfied .",
    "although we focus on the onset of mri , it is possible that other types of mhd instability could occur in protodiscs .",
    "our interest is in identifying at least one mechanism that will prevent a protodisc from shrinking completely and redistribute its angular momentum so that a quasi - steady disc may be formed .",
    "we consider the protodisc phase of a disc to end at the time that mri occurs in that region . in an axially symmetric protodisc ,",
    "the meridional component of the velocity is negligible and we have @xmath100 in cylindrical coordinates .",
    "the magnetic field is given by @xmath101 .",
    "when @xmath102 is relatively small , the slope @xmath103 of the shock surface is also small and the normal component wind velocity @xmath104 is a function of @xmath43 only along the shock boundary .",
    "then , because the ram pressure from inflowing wind material on the shock boundary remains steady , the temperature @xmath105 of the protodisc at a point @xmath16 of the shock will also be function of @xmath43 only and does not change as @xmath79 increases .",
    "thus , if the radiative cooling time of the protodisc is much longer than the flow time of wind material into the shock surface , the temperature @xmath106 in the protodisc will have the same value along a vertical line because there is no meridional flow of material in a protodisc region .",
    "that is , we can take @xmath106 to be independent of @xmath107 so that @xmath108 and @xmath109 . in models where @xmath102 becomes a large fraction before the onset of mri",

    "in this section we set up the equations that are necessary to determine values of quantities at points on the disc side of the shock surface from the values on the wind side that we obtain in section [ sec - windzone ] .",
    "as material flows from the wind zone into a protodisc region , the height @xmath79 of the shock surface forming the boundary of the protodisc increases .",
    "let @xmath110 denote the normal component of the velocity of the point @xmath16 on the shock surface in the direction of @xmath78 . to solve for the properties of a protodisc we need the values of @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 at points on the disc side of the shock boundary .",

    "the first term represents the flow of kinetic energy of the material and the second term is the sum of the flows of internal energy and thermal energy .",
    "the sum of the third and fourth terms gives the normal component of the poynting vector that represents the flux of electromagnetic energy of the plasma .",
    "the rankine - hugoniot equations that we have set up above have general validity for protodiscs .",
    "however , in the case of the protodisc models that we consider here , the changes in values of @xmath124 and @xmath34 across the shock surface are not large .",
    "thus , we find that the influx of mass , momentum and kinetic energy of the wind material go mainly into increasing the the density and temperature of the protodisc .    equations ( [ eqn - shock - disc - proto - vxb - tangential ] ) and ( [ eqn - shock - disc - proto - mom - phi ] ) give the azimuthal components of velocity and magnetic field on the disc side of the shock surface as @xmath125 and @xmath126 where @xmath127 is the normal component of the alfvn velocity at a point on the disc side of the shock boundary . in our protodisc models we have @xmath128 larger than @xmath129 .",
    "this is a consequence of the condition that the stellar magnetic field is able to channel the flow of wind material into the disc region . since @xmath130 , equations ( [ eqn - shock - disc - proto - uphid ] ) and ( [ eqn - shock - disc - proto - bphid ] )",
    "show that the rotation speed and azimuthal component of the magnetic field increase across the shock boundary . in our protodiscs",
    "we find that @xmath114 is at most 2% larger than the corotation speed @xmath131 . in protodiscs where the shock surface is stationary , that is @xmath132 , we find that @xmath133 , which is consistent with the protodisc rotation law given in @xcite . also , because @xmath134 , the strength of @xmath135 decreases slightly across the shock boundary .",
    "here , we set up equations for the structure of protodiscs and obtain analytic solutions . we do not consider a disc region to be a protodisc after the onset of mri .",

    "a protodisc region may take a long time to shrink completely and during most of this time it would appear like a ring .",
    "however , it is not clear whether steady uniform rotation is possible in the surface regions of rapidly rotating early type stars because large scale meridional circulations must occur in the radiative envelopes of such stars .",
    "meridional circulation will transport angular momentum and disrupt the angular velocity distribution to cause differential rotation .",
    "studies by @xcite showed that steady rotation may be possible in the interior of the radiative envelope with angular velocity constant along field lines and having about @xmath339 percent variation from uniform rotation .",

    "this situation is the same as in the surface regions of the sun where convective motions and meridional circulation are present .",
    "thus , we suggest that it is reasonable to expect that there are massive stars with solar - type differential rotation .    our study of protodiscs was motivated in large part by the claim that discs will not form around magnetic rotator stars because of centrifugal breakout found by @xcite in numerical simulations of uniformly rotating stars .",
    "@xcite had previously pointed out that centrifugal outflow of protodisc material due to increased density could diffuse into keplerian , especially when viscosity was present . in studying the evolutionary properties of protodiscs",

    "<S> we develop equations and obtain solutions for the structure and evolution of a protodisc region that is initially formed with no radial motion and super - keplerian rotation speed when wind material from a hot rotating star is channelled towards its equatorial plane by a dipole - type magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> its temperature is around @xmath0k because of shock heating and the inflow of wind material causes its equatorial density to increase with time . </S>",
    "<S> the centrifugal force and thermal pressure increase relative to the magnetic force and material escapes at its outer edge . </S>",
    "<S> the protodisc region of a uniformly rotating star has almost uniform rotation and will shrink radially unless some instability intervenes . in a star with angular velocity increasing along its surface towards the equator , </S>",
    "<S> the angular velocity of the protodisc region decreases radially outwards and magnetorotational instability ( mri ) can occur within a few hours or days . </S>",
    "<S> viscosity resulting from mri will readjust the angular velocity distribution of the protodisc material and may assist in the formation of a quasi - steady disc . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the centrifugal breakout found in numerical simulations for uniformly rotating stars does not imply that quasi - steady discs with slow outflow can not form around magnetic rotator stars with solar - type differential rotation .    </S>",
