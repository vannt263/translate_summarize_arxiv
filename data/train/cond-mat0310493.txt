    "dynamics of granular fluids has captured a lot of attention from theoretical physicists for the last few years . in a theorist s model ,",
    "the constituent particles of a granular fluid , usually considered to be hard spheres of finite radii , irretrievably dissipate kinetic energy via inelastic binary collisions and interparticle frictional forces . as a result , unlike the microscopic models for the classical kinetic theory of gases , a granular fluid that is not driven by external forces `` cools freely '' .    even in the absence of frictional forces , in a stark contrast to hard sphere fluids with elastic inter - particle binary collisions , such a simplified model of granular fluids exhibits complex behaviour at macroscopic scales . in its simplest form , a freely cooling initially homogeneous and isotropic ( both in the particles position and velocity space ) inelastic gas spontaneously forms nontrivial structures in the macroscopic velocity as well as in the macroscopic density field of the gas .",
    "a large number of studies , mostly from the point of view of inelastic hydrodynamics , have been carried out to understand the onset for the formation of these structures in two and three dimensions ( refs .",
    "@xcite to cite a few ) .",
    "the ( qualitative and quantitative ) picture that has emerged from these studies is that in two and three dimensions , the system of inelastic hard spheres suffers from inherent long wavelength linear instabilities . when the system size allows such long wavelengths to be present , these instabilities start to generate inhomogeneities in the macroscopic velocity and the density field of the gas . in the subsequent evolution",
    ", these inhomogeneities interact nonlinearly to give rise to macroscopic structures and the entire system evolves into a collection of densely populated clusters that are separated by regions containing particles at very low density @xcite . at late times , the clusters collide in a very complex manner and merge  a phenomenon that is known as coarsening in the literature @xcite .",
    "the late time evolution of a freely cooling inelastic gas is thus qualitatively completely different from the linear instability mechanisms at early times .",
    "however , although a very large number of studies have been devoted to kinetic theory of freely cooling inelastic gases in two and three dimensions , due to the difficulties associated with the nonlinearities in the behaviour of individual clusters and cluster - cluster collisions , a proper theoretical understanding of the long time dynamics of freely cooling inelastic gases has remained elusive .",
    "the existing results have only been numerical @xcite .    at the other extreme , fully analytical solutions have been found for completely inelastic ( or `` sticky '' ) granular gas ( of point particles ) in one dimension @xcite , and it has been shown that the sticky gas in one dimension is described by the burgers equation in the inviscid limit @xcite .",
    "in addition , a recent experiment has also observed clustering in a one - dimensional granular gas @xcite . due to dimensional reasons ,",
    "the dynamics of a granular gas in one dimension is qualitatively different from those in two or three dimensions ( e.g. , vortices can not form , a strict ordering of particles from left to right is maintained at all times ) , but structures are still seen to form in the velocity and as well as in the density field of the gas @xcite .",
    "ben - naim et al @xcite have studied the formation of these structures , and have conjectured that at the long times , the behaviour of a one - dimensional inelastic gas should be the same as that of the sticky gas .",

    "visual inspection shows that the locations of the ( relative ) large shocks are aligned almost perfectly .",

    "the colliding pair of particles are the ones that has the momentary global minimum value of @xmath14 .    the random lattice model _ without kinetic constraint _",
    ", has already been studied as part of a larger class of models , the inelastic maxwell models @xcite , in which the collision frequency is chosen to be independent of the incoming velocities of colliding particles .",
    "for that model , it has been analytically shown that correlations develop with a diffusively growing correlation length , which consequently affects the temperature decay rate .",

    "it is however important to realize the difference between these existing results and the ones reported in this paper : the existing results mainly concern global quantities , while in this paper , our main thrust is to study the behaviour of the microscopic inhomogeneities arising from the kinetic constraint .",
    "the key feature of both variants of the lattice model with kinetic constraint studied here is that an initial configuration of random velocities of the particles soon develops distinct spatial structures , eventually leading to _ large positive sharp jumps in the particle velocities intersparsed with relatively smooth variations_. we refer to the large positive sharp jumps in the velocity field as _ shocks _ and the region between two consecutive shocks , where the velocity variations are smooth , as _",

    "after @xmath19 collisions per particle , shocks and clusters can be clearly identified [ fig . [ fig1](c ) ] . according to the kinetic constraint , neighbouring particles can not collide across a shock , and as a result , each cluster evolves independently of the others , until two neighbouring clusters collide and coalesce to form a new bigger cluster [ this mechanism is illustrated by the evolution of velocity profile of fig .",

    "one can identify two separate regimes : the initial homogeneous regime , and the subsequent clustered regime at late times . to make the evolution of the system from one regime towards the other quantitatively more precise",

    "initially , for each @xmath1 , the distribution of @xmath3 is uniform in @xmath2 $ ] ( i.e. , a `` box '' distribution ) .",

    "the choice of the numerical value of @xmath34 is arbitrary , and this arbitrariness can be used to tune the minimum value that @xmath30 must have in order to qualify for a shock . furthermore ,",
    "if one defines the instant @xmath35 when the system passes from one regime to the other by the minimal time where at least one shock becomes visible , then the above requirement can also be used to characterize @xmath35 .",
    "of course , the precise value of @xmath35 depends on the chosen value of @xmath34 . in the clustered regime , due to inelastic collisions , the amplitude of the velocity profile within each cluster decreases , and the velocities of the particles approach that of the center of mass of the cluster itself .",
    "this process continues for a while until two neighbouring clusters , with center of mass velocities @xmath36 and @xmath37 collide and coalesce and the shock separating them disappears [ at time @xmath38 , if we number the clusters @xmath39 from the left to the right , then such a cluster - cluster collision takes place only if @xmath40 .",
    "precisely this mechanism is responsible for making the velocity profile of fig .",

    "[ fig1](d ) .    at very late times ,",
    "due to periodic boundary condition , only a single cluster survives .",
    "its amplitude also decreases in time , and the velocities of all particles asymptotically converge to the center of mass velocity of the whole system .",
    "one of the first questions that one can ask for the lattice model is what is the effect of inelasticity on the clustering properties of the system .",
    "clearly , for @xmath41 , the collisions are elastic , and upon collision , the velocities of two neighbouring particles are simply interchanged .",
    "such a dynamics can not lead to clustering or any structure formation .    on the other hand ,",
    "our simulations show that the lattice model exhibits clustering for any value of @xmath42 smaller then @xmath43 , and it is only @xmath35 defined in sec .",
    "[ sec2a ] that becomes an increasing function of @xmath42 .",
    "the most remarkable observation , however , is that for a given initial velocity configuration of the particles , not only the locations of the shocks persisting at late times are the same for all @xmath42 , but also the macroscopic velocity profiles are nearly independent of @xmath42 .",
    "if we consider the macroscopic velocity profile of the lattice model with a coefficient of restitution @xmath44 at a time @xmath45 well into the clustered regime , then for any @xmath46 , ( originating from the same initial velocity configuration of the particles ) there exists a time @xmath47 , for which the two macroscopic velocity profiles are almost the same ( see fig . [ rex ] ) .",
    "effectively , this implies that for all @xmath42 , the dynamical behaviour of the system is identical to that for @xmath11 at late times .",

    "surprisingly however , the locations of the shocks depend _ only _ on the initial configuration of the particles velocities , e.g , two different random collision sequences result in the same locations of the shocks . on the other hand , the variant of the lattice model ( random or systematic ) determines the macroscopic shape of the velocity profile inside the clusters . to demonstrate this phenomenon ,",
    "starting from the same initial velocities of the particles , we simulated both the random and the systematic lattice models and compared the locations of the shocks ( see fig . [ twolatt_shocks ] ) .",
    "the empirical observations in the preceding sections suggest that so long as one is only interested in the velocity profile @xmath15 , a close relation exists between the one - dimensional inelastic gas and the lattice model from the following consideration : the dynamics of a one - dimensional inelastic gas for a given initial configuration is completely deterministic  after any collision , the next colliding pair is automatically determined by the instantaneous minimal value of @xmath50 , for @xmath51 . in this sense",
    ", one can view the one - dimensional inelastic gas as a variant of the lattice model too , where the colliding particles are chosen in a very complicated manner .",
    "section [ sec2c ] then indicates that for a given initial configuration of the particles velocities as a function of the particle index , the locations of the shocks in the one - dimensional inelastic gas and those in the lattice model are the same . that this is indeed the case",
    "is numerically verified in fig . [ twolatt_shocks ] .    in our simulations of the one - dimensional inelastic gas",
    ", we followed the procedure outlined in ref .",
    "@xcite , namely that to avoid the inelastic collapse , the collisions were taken to be elastic when the relative velocities between the neighbouring particles are smaller than a given cutoff .",
    "our results confirm the existence of `` burgers '' shocks in the @xmath52 profile @xcite .",
    "more importantly , we note that for the one - dimensional inelastic gas , _ there is an inverse correspondence of shocks and clusters between this @xmath52 and @xmath15 profile  each shock in the @xmath52 profile [ i.e. , a large particle density @xmath53 corresponds to a cluster in the @xmath15 profile and the shocks in the @xmath15 profile correspond to regions with finite gradients in @xmath52_.",
    "the lesson that we learnt from sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] is that the locations of the shocks in this lattice model are essentially determined from the initial configuration of the particles velocities .",
    "this immediately gives rise to the following question : how can one predict the locations of the shocks seen at early times from the initial velocity configuration of the particles ?",
    "as it turns out , most of the shocks observed in the clustered regime already exist at @xmath54 .",
    "these are the locations marked by large positive jumps in the @xmath15 profile between two neighbouring lattice sites at @xmath54 , surrounded by relatively small velocity variations .",
    "to illustrate this point , we present a schematic diagram for such a velocity profile for a few particle in fig .",
    "[ ab ] . in the subsequent dynamics at short times , the particles on the right of b and on the left of a collide with each other and `` thermalize '' ( i.e. , the velocity variations reduce due to inelasticity ) , but this thermalization may not necessarily convert a relatively large @xmath55 to @xmath56 quickly enough to make the a and b collide .",
    "in other words , such a large positive jump remains preserved and may eventually give rise to a shock .    to check",
    "if such a scenario is correct or not , one needs to identify the locations of such large positive jumps in the initial @xmath15 profile , and contrast them with the observed locations of the shocks at early times . a convenient way to single out such jumps [ say , in fig . [ fig1](a ) ] is to define a @xmath57-coarse grained velocity profile @xmath58 of the particles , which , roughly speaking , can single out one such large jump over the surrounding small velocity variations in a window of @xmath57 lattice sites in the @xmath59 profile .",
    "having fine - tuned @xmath60 , a surprisingly close match between the observed shock locations at early times and the initial configuration of the particles velocities can be found ( see fig . [ cg ] ) .",
    "notice , however , in fig .",
    "[ cg ] that not all the large jumps in the initial configuration of the particles velocities have turned out to be shocks at a later time .",
    "indeed , in general , whether such an initial large positive jump at a particular location develops into a shock or not really depends on the magnitude of the jump itself in relation to particle velocities in its immediate vicinity , and as well as on the coefficient of restitution @xmath42 . in this regard ,",
    "the dependence on the coefficient of restitution is not difficult to understand , as @xmath42 quantifies the `` transport of velocity '' between two colliding particles . intuitively speaking",
    ", an inelastic collision between two neighbouring particles can be viewed as a combination of dissipation ( thermalization ) and transport of velocities .",
    "for @xmath41 only transport of velocities can take place . at the other limit , for @xmath11 , there is no transport of velocities but only dissipation . as a result , for @xmath11 ,",
    "small velocity variations around any large jump thermalize immediately , leading to an early appearance of the clustered regime , and a large number of initial jumps end up becoming shocks . with increasing @xmath42 , some of the initial large positive jumps are eliminated by transport of velocities , and clustering regime , with a smaller number of selected shocks ( and clusters ) , appears later .",
    "( @xmath61 ) for @xmath11 for the random lattice model of @xmath62 particles .",
    "gray curve corresponds to @xmath54 and the black curve represents early shocks .",
    "the scale in the @xmath12-direction is arbitrary . ]",
    "the appearance of the shocks at the locations where relatively large positive jumps exist is therefore caused by the thermalization of the smaller velocity variations around these jumps  due to thermalization , the smaller velocity variations become even smaller , but the large positive jumps remain preserved under the dynamics . in relation to their surroundings , the magnitude of these large jumps thus starts to grow in time .",
    "such a scenario applies independently of the details of the model , and gives a qualitative explanation for the observation that starting from a given initial configuration , shocks appear at the same locations in the @xmath15 profile for both variants of the lattice model and as well as for the one - dimensional inelastic gas @xcite .",
    "moreover , it also clearly demonstrates that the shock formation `` instability '' in the @xmath15 profile in all these models is a `` relative instability '' and not an `` absolute '' one .",
    "such behaviour has also been found in the ( long - wavelength ) linear instability of the macroscopic flow field for two- and three - dimensional inelastic gases ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for example ) .",
    "once the shocks develop , our simulations show that for a given variant of the lattice model , the velocity profile within each cluster has the same characteristic macroscopic shape . for the deterministic lattice model ,",
    "this shape is simply linear with a negative slope .",
    "although we can not provide an analytical derivation of this shape , if we interpret the dynamics along the lines that at each updating step of a cluster , two neighbouring particles collide at the location where the @xmath14 is minimum ( which is a mechanism that tries to align all @xmath14 values to its maximum value within each cluster ) , then the linear profile appears to be intuitively reasonable .    for the random lattice model , however , the slope of the macroscopic velocity profile is smoothly varying , as can be seen in , e.g. , fig .",
    "[ fig1](d ) [ occasionally , flat profiles can be observed too , but for the time being , we leave them for sec . [ sec3b2 ] ] .",
    "it turns out that the functional form of the smooth macroscopic velocity profile can be obtained through a mean - field approach by averaging over an ensemble of random collision sequence realizations within a cluster , as we describe below .",
    "the idea behind this mean - field approach is the following : we consider a cluster of @xmath63 particles , and denote the velocity of the @xmath1th particle at time @xmath38 , averaged over random collision sequences , by @xmath64 . from the very definition of a cluster in the introduction",
    ", we assume that @xmath65 at all times .",

    "these structures appear in the form of clusters separated by shocks .",
    "the locations of the shocks in this lattice model at early times are decided from the initial configurations of the particles velocities in a very robust manner . in order to predict the locations of the shocks ,",
    "we have demonstrated a procedure to process the initial velocity configurations data of the particles , and this procedure works equally well also for the one - dimensional inelastic gas @xcite .",
    "the coefficient of restitution does play a role to decide which of the large jumps in the particles velocities at early times yield shocks , but at late times , the macroscopic velocity profile for a given model with a given initial configuration of the particles velocities is independent of the coefficient of restitution .",
