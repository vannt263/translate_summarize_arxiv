    "in @xcite hilden introduced and found generators for two particular subgroups of the mapping class group of the sphere with @xmath4 punctures . roughly speaking these groups consist of ( the isotopy classes of ) homeomorphisms of the puctured sphere which admit an extension to the 3-ball fixing @xmath5 arcs embedded in the 3-ball and bounded by the punctures .",
    "the interest in these groups was motivated by the theory of links in @xmath6 ( or in @xmath7 ) . in @xcite ,",
    "hilden s generators were used in order to find a finite number of explicit equivalence moves relating two braids having the same plate closure .",
    "more recently , many authors investigated different groups related to hilden s ones ( see @xcite ) and in particular motions groups ( introduced in  @xcite ) . the second author introduced in  @xcite a higher genus generalization of hilden s groups .",
    "these groups are subgroups of punctured mapping class groups of closed surfaces and are related to the study of link theory in a closed 3-manifold .    in this paper",
    "we define and study a different higher genus generalization of hilden s groups : the hilden braid groups .",
    "these groups can be seen as subgroups of the ones studied in @xcite and they can be thought as a generalization of hilden s groups in the `` braid direction '' .",
    "analogously to the genus zero case , our interest in these groups is mainly motivated by the theory of links in a closed 3-manifold . with respect to groups introduced in @xcite , our groups seem to be more useful on studying links in a fixed manifolds .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section  2 is devoted to the definition of hilden braid groups and pure hilden braid groups ; a set of generators for these groups will be provided in section  [ second ] ( theorems  2 and  3 ) . as we will prove in section  [ first ] , by fixing a heegaard decomposition of a given 3-manifold , it is possible to define a plat - like closure for @xmath4-string braids on the heegaard surface . in this",
    "setting , hilden braid groups play a role similar to hilden groups in the plat closure of classical braids .",
    "moreover , as in the genus zero case , hilden braid groups are connected with motion groups of links in closed 3-manifolds ; this relation is established in section  [ third ] ( theorem  7 ) .",
    "referring to figure [ fig1 ] , let @xmath0 be an oriented handlebody of genus @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "we recall that a system of @xmath5 pairwise disjoint arcs @xmath10 properly embedded in @xmath0 is called _ trivial _ or _ boundary parallel _ if there exist @xmath5 disks ( the grey ones in figure  1 ) @xmath11 , called _ trivializing disks _ , embedded in @xmath0 such that @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , for @xmath15 and @xmath16 .    by means of the trivializing disks",

    "moreover , if @xmath31 denotes the subgroup of @xmath2 consisting of the isotopy classes of the homeomorphisms of @xmath20 fixing the punctures pointwise , we set @xmath32 and call it the _ pure hilden mapping class group_. as recalled before , the groups @xmath33 and @xmath34 were first introduced and studied by hilden in @xcite , where the author found a finite set of generators , while in @xcite has been provided a set of generators for all hilden ( pure ) mapping class groups .",

    "notice that , since @xmath41 , then @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "moreover , in @xcite , it is shown that @xmath44 is isomorphic to the quotient of the braid group @xmath45 by its center , which is trivial if @xmath46 .",
    "so , if @xmath46 we can see @xmath39 as a subgroup of the braid group of the surface @xmath20 .    in @xcite , tawn found a finite presentation for two groups that he called the hilden group @xmath47 and pure hilden group @xmath48 .",
    "the definition proposed by tawn is slightly different from ours ; indeed , @xmath47 and @xmath48 are subgroups of , respectively , the braid group @xmath49 and the pure braid group @xmath50 , instead of , respectively , the mapping class group @xmath51 and the pure mapping class group @xmath52 .",
    "nevertheless , from these presentations it is not difficult to obtain a presentation for @xmath53 and @xmath54 as sketched in the following .",
    "consider the inclusion of the punctured @xmath4 disk into the @xmath4 punctured sphere : it induces surjective maps from @xmath55 to @xmath51 and from @xmath56 to @xmath52 .",
    "the kernels of these maps coincide with the subgroup normally generated by the center of @xmath57 and the element @xmath58 , where @xmath59 denotes the usual generator of the braid group @xmath49 .",
    "one can easily show that such elements belong to @xmath48 and that these maps restrict to surjective homomorphisms @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "therefore a finite presentation of @xmath62 ( respectively of @xmath63 ) is given by the same set of generators of @xmath47 ( respectively @xmath48 ) and the same set of relations of @xmath47 ( respectively @xmath48 ) plus the relation @xmath64 and @xmath65 , where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are , respectively , the generator of the center of @xmath57 and the element @xmath58 both written as words in the generators of @xmath47 ( respectively @xmath48 ) .",
