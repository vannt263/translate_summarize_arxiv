    "it is interesting to explore the possibility that a graviton is massive both from theoretical and phenomenological point of view .",
    "theoretically , it is challenging because of various difficulty in constructing a consistent model for a massive graviton . at the linear level , fiertz and pauli succeeded in constructing a ghost - free model for a massive graviton  @xcite .",
    "however , it is soon recognized that there is a tension between the theory and experiments , the so - called van dam - veltman - zaharov ( vdvz ) discontinuity  @xcite .",
    "it is suggested that the non - linearity resolves the vdvz discontinuity  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , it turned out that the non - linearity gives rise to a ghost , the so called boulware - deser ( bd ) ghost  @xcite . recently , de rham , gabadadze and tolly have succeeded in constructing ghost - free non - linear massiv gravity theory  @xcite ( see a review @xcite and references therein . ) . still , there remains various theoretically intriguing issues to be explored .",
    "phenomenologically , there is a chance to explain the current accelerating universe based on massive gravity .",
    "in fact , there appears an effective cosmological constant proportional to the square of graviton mass  @xcite .",
    "it is worth studying this possibility in detail .",
    "one peculiar feature of massive theory of graviton is the necessity of a reference metric which breaks the diffeomorphism invariance .",
    "it is natural to promote this reference metric to a dynamical variable , which is nothing but bimetric gravity .",
    "bimetric gravity contains two metrics @xmath0 and @xmath1 interacting each other .",
    "a history of bimetric gravity is long  @xcite .",
    "curiously , bimetric gravity also suffers from the ghost problem .",
    "thanks to the recent development in massive gravity , however , hassan and rosen have proposed ghost - free bimetric gravity  @xcite . then , a natural question arises whether or not we can construct ghost - free multimetric gravity .",
    "actually , a naive extension of bimetric gravity to trimetric case was proposed in @xcite . there , three metrics @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 have a pair interaction between @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , which forms a loop structure .",
    "in contrast to bimetric gravity , however , the presence or the absence of bd - ghost remains unknown .",
    "recently , hinterbichler and rosen showed that a large class of multivielbein gravity is ghost free @xcite .",
    "the relation to metric theory is also discussed  @xcite . however , the relation to the models presented in @xcite is not clear .",
    "the difference between @xcite and @xcite comes from the loop type interaction .",
    "in fact , the proof by vielbein method is not applicable to the loop type interaction .",
    "hence , we need to study multimetric gravity with a different approach .    in this paper , we propose a simple method to study the ghost problem and clarify when multimetric gravity is ghost - free .",
    "a method often used for the ghost analysis is to examine models in the decoupling limit .",
    "however , a more honest way for probing ghosts is to use the hamiltonian constraint analysis using the adm formalism  @xcite .",
    "the difficulty in studying multimetric gravity with the constraint analysis comes from the existence of a shift vector . to avoid the difficulty",
    ", we employ the mini - superspace approximation .",
    "the mini - superspace reduction of phase space makes the analysis so simple . nevertheless , it is sufficient to identify ghosts because this reduction process does not fail to capture ghosts .",
    "the organazation of the paper is as follows . in section [ bimet ]",
    ", we revisit bimetric gravity and explain our strategy for the ghost analysis . in section [ trimet ] , we investigate trimetric gravity using our method and found that the loop type interaction allows ghost . in section [ mtt ] , we further extend the analysis to general @xmath6-metric gravity .",
    "we clarify when ghost appears in the spectrum .",
    "the final section [ conclusion ] is devoted to the conclusion .",
    "in this section , we revisit bigravity and explain our method to probe a ghost .",
    "it is already known that bimetric gravity is ghost - free  @xcite . here",
    ", we show the same conclusion can be obtained using a simple mini - superspace approximation . in the context of massive gravity ,",
    "the decoupling limit analysis turns out to be a useful way for the ghost analysis .",
    "however , the most complete one is to use hamiltonian constraint analysis and count physical degrees of freedom .",
    "our strategy is to use hamiltonian constraint analysis in the mini - superspace .",
    "the action of ghost - free bimetric gravity @xcite is given by @xmath7+m^2_{f}\\int d^4 x\\sqrt{-\\det f}r[f ]   \\nonumber\\\\       & &   \\qquad + 2m^2 m_{gf}^2\\int d^4 x",

    "the other constants @xmath13 and @xmath14 are introduced to adjust the mass dimension . the square root of the matrix is defined such that @xmath15 .",
    "the interaction terms are constructed by @xmath16 which we define , for matrix @xmath17 , @xmath18 where we used the notation @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "it is useful to represent the interaction by a diagram in fig .",
    "note that there is the order between @xmath0 and @xmath1 which is denoted by the arrow .",
    "it is known that the interaction produces massless and massive gravitons and the spectrum is free of boulware - deser ghost .",
    "this feature comes from a specific interaction form found in massive gravity theory .",
    "remarkably , there exists the diagonal diffeomorphism invariance which indicates the presence of the massless graviton .     can be represented by a simple diagram .",
    "each blob describes a spacetime with a given metric .",
    "the arrow indicates the order of product .",
    ", width=151 ]    now , let us perform hamiltonian constraint analysis based on the adm formalism .",
    "in particular , to make the analysis tractable , we employ the mini - superspace approach .",
    "namely , we assume spatial homogeneity and express metrics in terms of adm variables as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a lapse function and @xmath23 is a spatial metric .",
    "similarly , we can take the following ansatz @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a lapse function and @xmath26 is a spatial metric . it is convenient to write them in a matrix form , @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are inverse matrices of spatial metrics @xmath23 and @xmath26 .",
    "then , a basic part of interaction terms can be calculated to be @xmath30    when we count physical degrees of freedom , the following must be taken into account . in the vacuum cases ,",
    "we can diagonalize one of two spatial metrics using diagonal spatial coordinate transformations . performing a spatial coordinate transformation @xmath31",
    ", we can set one spatial metric at the time @xmath32 , @xmath33 , a unit matrix @xmath34 .",
    "moreover , since the orthogonal transformation dose not change @xmath35 , we can diagonalize @xmath36 simultaneously by using this freedom . at this stage ,",
    "homogeneous spatial coordinates are completely fixed .",
    "now , @xmath23 and @xmath37 is diagonal at the time @xmath32 as an initial condition",
    ". then we assume diagonal form of @xmath38 at all time , and insert it into equations obtained from variations of action .",
    "any contradiction never occurs in vacuum .",
    "thus , we conclude that one spacial metric @xmath38 can be diagonalized because of the uniqueness of the solution . hence , the number of component of one of two metrics reduces from 6 to 3 .",
    "this fact will be used later .    in this paper , for simplicity , we assume that interactions are minimal  @xcite , namely @xmath39 clearly , this simplification does not lose any generality concerning with the ghost analysis .",
    "then , the lagrangian reads @xmath40 where @xmath41 , @xmath42 are canonical conjugate momentum of @xmath23 , @xmath26 . here , we have defined @xmath43                  + a_1\\sqrt{\\det \\gamma}\\big(\\mathrm{tr}\\sqrt{\\gamma^{-1}\\omega}-3\\big ) \\\\",

    "the last term of each constraint comes from the interaction ( see the derivation in appendix a ) , and we use @xmath50 .",
    "now , the hamiltonian is given by @xmath51 since there are two lagrange multipliers , there are two primary constraints @xmath52 moreover , we need to impose consistency conditions for them @xmath53 where the poisson bracket @xmath54 is defined by @xmath55 here , `` @xmath56 '' means `` @xmath57 '' on the constraint surface .",
    "notice that @xmath58 because of spatial homogeneity .    to check",

    "the consistency condition for the secondary constraint reads @xmath62 this condition determines one of two lagrange multipliers @xmath22 and @xmath25 . the remaining multiplier describes the diagonal time reparametrization invariance in bimetric gravity .",
    "the number of components of two metrics and their canonical conjugates is @xmath63 .",
    "since we can diagonalize one of the two metrics , we should subtract 6 from this number .",
    "recall that there are two primary constraints and one secondary constraint .",
    "furthermore , as we have one first class constraint , we have to put one gauge condition .",
    "thus , the total number of degrees of freedom should be @xmath64 in configuration space , which matches degrees of freedom of one massless graviton and one massive graviton .",
    "this proves that bd ghost is absent in bimetric gravity described by the action ( [ bimetric - action ] ) .",

    "we also introduced new mass parameters @xmath69 and a planck mass @xmath70 .",
    "it should be noted that there exists the diagonal diffeomorphism invariance in this trimetric theory which makes one of gravitons massless . as discussed in @xcite , if this trimetric gravity contains no extra degrees of freedom , the total number of degrees of freedom should be @xmath71 , which comes from one massless graviton and two massive gravitons . from now on ,",
    "we use @xmath72 for notational simplicity . if we have @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 , all pairs @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 interact and we call it the loop type interaction . when one of @xmath79 is set to zero ,",

    "the other terms can be derived as explained in appendix a. then , the hamiltonian can be read off as @xmath89 since there are three lagrange multipliers , there arise three primary constraints @xmath90 moreover , we need consistency conditions for them @xmath91 to check if secondary constraints arise , we must calculate poisson brackets . from the calculation in appendix b ,",

    "since @xmath101 trivially holds , consistency conditions ( [ tricon ] ) lead to equations @xmath102 hence , we have two secondary constraints @xmath103 moreover , we must impose consistency conditions @xmath104 which determine two of three lagrange multipliers @xmath22 , @xmath25 and @xmath81 . the remaining multiplier is related to the gauge transformation .    eventually , we have five constraints and one gauge freedom . in trimetric gravity , propagating modes are spatial metrics .",
    "each of them has six components , but as is already explained we can diagonalize one of them . hence , trimetric gravity has @xmath105 degrees of freedom in configuration space and @xmath106 in phase apace .",
    "thus , the total number of degrees of freedom is @xmath107 which matches the physical degrees of one massless and two massive gravitons .",
    "therefore , no bd ghost exists in the spectrum .",
    "this conclusion is consistent with the one obtained by the vielbein method  @xcite .",
    "now , we consider the more general loop type interaction represented by a diagram in fig.[fig3 ] @xmath108 it is obvious that @xmath109 even on the constraint surface .",
    "hence , consistency conditions ( [ tricon ] ) do not generate any secondary constraint .",
    "instead , it determines lagrange multipliers @xmath22 , @xmath25 and @xmath81 .",
    "however , due to the antisymmetric property of poisson brackets @xmath110 only two of them are determined .",
    "for example , choosing @xmath111 all of consistency conditions ( [ tricon ] ) are satisfied .",
    "to conclude , we have three primary constraints and we need one gauge condition to fix one undetermined lagrange multiplier which is associated with the time reparametrization invariance . in trimetric gravity , as is already counted , there are @xmath105 degrees of freedom in configuration space and @xmath106 in phase apace . in phase space , we have three constraints and one gauge condition , so total number of degrees of freedom is @xmath112 . if no bd ghost is present , there must be @xmath71 degrees of freedom which comes from one massless graviton and two massive gravitons .",
    "therefore , one extra degree of freedom exists and it should be a bd ghost .",
    "thus , we have proved the existence of a ghost in generic trimetric gravity .",
    "now , we are in a position to discuss more general cases . we explicitly calculate the number of ghosts if they exist .    in this section",
    ", we consider @xmath6 dynamical metrics @xmath113 ( @xmath114 ) and interaction terms such as @xmath115 where we define @xmath116 and for later purpose we also need @xmath117 .",

    "thus , the total interaction terms are given by @xmath124 the hamiltonian becomes @xmath125 where @xmath126 comes from the einstein hilbert term for @xmath113 , so it contains @xmath127 and its canonical cojugate momentum @xmath128 .",
    "corresponding to @xmath6 lagrange multipliers , we have @xmath6 primary constraints @xmath129 next , we have to examine @xmath6 consistency conditions @xmath130 where @xmath131 and @xmath132 if @xmath133 . in this formula , @xmath134 and @xmath135 should be understood .",
    "note that the explicit calculation gives rise to an important information @xmath136 the structure of this matrix depends on odd or even number .",
    "for example , in the case @xmath137 , we have @xmath138 while , in the case of @xmath139 , we get @xmath140 in the case of odd number of metrics , we can not split the equations into two independent sets . while , in the case of even number of metrics , we can split a set of equations into independent two groups of equations .",
    "hence , we have to discuss two cases , separately .",
    "first , we consider the tree type interaction .",
    "if we cut one of @xmath141 interactions as in fig.[fig4 ] , for example setting @xmath142 , eq.([con ] ) leads to @xmath143 secondary constraints @xmath144 and their consistency conditions @xmath145 determine @xmath143 of @xmath146 ( @xmath114 ) , only one lagrange multiplier remains undetermined .",
    "therefore , the total number of degrees of freedom can be deduced as @xmath147 which corresponds to @xmath143 massive and one massless gravitons .",
    "therefore , there exists no bd ghost .",
    "this conclusion is also consistent with the one obtained by the vielbein method  @xcite .",
    "now , we come to our main point .    if all of @xmath141 interactions exist as in fig.[fig5 ] , the analysis gets a little complicated .",
    "we have to discuss odd and even numbers , separately .",
    "first , we consider the case where @xmath148 , where @xmath13 is a natural number . in this case",
    ", we can classify eq.([con ] ) into the following four parts @xmath149 solving eq.([odd1 ] ) , we see all of @xmath150 ( @xmath151 ) can be expressed by @xmath152 . similarly , eq.([odd2 ] ) can be used to express @xmath153 ( @xmath154 ) in terms of @xmath155 . substituting these results into eq.([odd3 ] ) and eq.([odd4 ] )",
    ", we obtain a single equation which determines @xmath156 by @xmath157 .",
    "thus , eq.([con ] ) determines @xmath143 lagrange multipliers , and one multiplier is left undetermined , which reflects the existence of gauge symmetry .    in the case of odd number of metrics , there is no secondary constraint .",
    "while , we need one gauge condition to fix the gauge degree of freedom . in conclusion , the total number of degrees of freedom can be calculated as @xmath158 here , the first two terms correspond to massive and massless gravitons , respectively",
    ". the last one should be bd ghosts and the number of ghosts is given by @xmath159 .",
    "next , we consider the case @xmath160 , where @xmath13 is a natural number . in this case , we can split eq.([con ] ) into two independent sets of equations , @xmath161 the first set ( [ eve1 ] ) contains only @xmath146 @xmath162 , and the second set ( [ eve2 ] ) contains @xmath146 @xmath163 . here ,",
    "if the component @xmath164 is in eq.([eve1 ] ) , @xmath165 must be in eq.([eve2 ] ) and vice versa .",
    "therfore , in each set , every component @xmath164 appears only once .",
    "now , we define @xmath166 note that @xmath167 only for @xmath168",
    ". then , eq.([eve1 ] ) can be written as @xmath169 which we can split into @xmath170 using eq.([eve4 ] ) , we can solve all of @xmath171 @xmath172 in terms of @xmath173 .",
    "however , the relation between @xmath173 and @xmath174 obtained from eq.([eve4 ] ) is not the same as eq.([eve3 ] ) because eq.([eve4 ] ) contains no @xmath175 and @xmath176 .",
    "so , we have to impose a constraint so that we get non - trivial lagrange multipliers .",
    "this is a secondary constraint expressed by @xmath177 under this condition , @xmath13 of @xmath171 @xmath178 are determined , and one is left undetermined .",
    "now , we take latter set ( [ eve2 ] ) and define @xmath179 the same argument applies , so we get a secondary constraint @xmath180 , and one of @xmath181 @xmath178 is left undetermined .",
    "however , matrix @xmath182 satisfies @xmath183 .",
    "hence , @xmath184 is not a new constraint .",
    "therefore , from eq.([con ] ) , we get one secondary constraint @xmath185 and two undetermined lagrange multipliers",
    ". then , we must impose a consistency condition for the secondary constraint @xmath186 which reduces the number of undetermined lagrange multipliers from two to one .",
    "to summarize , there are @xmath6 primary constraints and one secondary constraint and we need one gauge condition .",
    "thus , we come to the conclusion that the total number of degrees of freedom is @xmath187 here , again , the first two terms correspond to massive and massless gravitons , respectively .",
    "hence , the number of bd ghosts should be @xmath188 .      in the previous sections , we have considered tree and loop type interactions . in the case of bimetric gravity ,",
    "the interaction type is unique , namely , there is only the tree type interaction . in the case of trimetric gravity , there are two possibilities , the tree and the loop type interaction . in the case of tetrametric gravity , there are many loop type interaction represented by a diagram ( a ) in fig.[fig6 ] .",
    "if we cut some of the interaction , we can make the tree type interaction and the broom type interaction represented by a diagram ( b ) in fig.[fig6 ] . from our analysis",
    ", it is apparent that if the interaction contains at least a loop , then there are ghosts .",
    "for example , the model with a diagram ( c ) in fig.[fig6 ] contains a ghost .",
    "therefore , in generic cases , there exist ghosts in multimetric gravity .",
    "the number of ghosts depends on the interaction pattern . to construct a viable model",
    ", we have to eliminate all of loop type interactions .",
    "we studied multimetric gravity by combining the mini - superspace and the hamiltonian constraint analysis .",
    "we first revisited bimetric gravity and explained why it is ghost - free .",
    "this proved validity of our method .",
    "then , we applied our method to trimetric gravity and clarified when the model contains a ghost .",
    "we proved trimetric gravity generically contains a ghost .",
    "however , if we cut the interaction of a pair of metrics , trimetric gravity turned out to be ghost - free .",
    "we further extended the hamiltonian analysis to general multimetric gravity and calculate the number of ghosts in various models .",
    "thus , we found multimetric gravity with loop type interactions never becomes ghost - free .",
    "the number of bd ghost in @xmath6 metric case turned out to be @xmath159 or @xmath188 , depending on whether the number of metrics @xmath6 is odd or even .",
    "hence , the number of bd ghosts increases by one everytime two more metrics are introduced .",
    "there are other models which may contain ghosts or may not contain any ghost .",
    "it depends on the interaction type .",
    "the number of ghosts can be calculated once the diagram characterizing the interaction pattern is given .    admittedly , what we have investigated is bd ghosts .",
    "there may be other ghosts depending on the solutions  @xcite .",
    "in other words , the absence of bd ghosts is a necessary condition as a healthy model . in this paper , we have studied interaction terms consists of only pairs of metrics .",
    "however , as in @xcite , interactions of triplets or quadruplets may be allowed .",
    "we hope to study this possibility in future .",
    "it is also interesting to extend our analysis to higher curvature theories  @xcite .",
