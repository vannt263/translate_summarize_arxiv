    "one of the goals of solar - terrestrial physics is to predict the response of magnetosphere - ionosphere system to highly variable conditions in the solar wind ( sw ) .",
    "the question of solar wind - magnetosphere coupling ( swmc ) can be studied by means of input - output modelling .",
    "linear input - output techniques ( or linear prediction filtering ) describe the swmc by a linear moving - average ( ma ) filter assuming that the convolution of a time - invariant transfer function ( tf ) , with an earlier sw input can predict the magnetospheric output represented by time series of geomagnetic indices @xcite .",
    "the tf characterizes the magnetospheric response and can be estimated directly from data provided that a sufficiently large number of input - output pairs is available .",
    "in fact , @xcite using the @xmath2 input - output data ( @xmath3 - solar wind velocity , @xmath4 - interplanetary magnetic field @xmath5 component , @xmath6 - auroral zone geomagnetic index ) have shown that the linear ma filters can identify two different regimes in which sw energy is dissipated within the magnetosphere ( directly driven and loading - unloading regimes ) . at the same time",
    ", the best linear ma filters do not predict the geomagnetic output precisely , unless strongly varying filter parameters are considered in each case of activity level separately @xcite .",
    "different levels of geomagnetic activity and the nonlinearity of the swmc were then treated by nonlinear ma filters @xcite using the assumption that the geomagnetic activity is a nonlinear function of the solar wind input .",
    "actually , local linear ( that is nonlinear ) ma filters were used , which represent a linear approximation of the nonlinear system .",
    "nonlinear ma filters proved to be better predictors of geomagnetic response as the linear ones , but the internal dynamics of the magnetosphere and the additional influence of it on the geomagnetic response itself ( a feedback ) was more explicitly considered within the frame of state - input space models @xcite . here",
    "the prediction of magnetospheric states is made within a common input ( solar wind ) - output ( geomagnetic data ) phase space and the local linear ( nonlinear ) approximation is given by an evolution of the nearest neighbours of a phase space point .",
    "@xcite found that in comparison with linear state - input models ( global aproximation ) the nonlinear state - input models ( local approximation based on nearest neighbours ) give better predictions of geomagnetic activity .",
    "an alternative to the above ma filters is represented by artificial neural networks ( ann ) which are global nonlinear functions .",
    "elman recurrent ann was used by @xcite to model sw forcing of the westward auroral electroject and the storm - time ring current . in predicting geomagnetic activity",
    "their performance was similar to that of linear filters @xcite .",
    "significantly better performance was achieved by gated anns that accounted for different levels of activity .",
    "@xcite used three individual anns for modelling low , medium and high @xmath7 activity levels using data from database of @xcite .",
    "the outputs of these anns together with past geomagnetic outputs were used to train the gate network .",
    "it was shown by @xcite and @xcite that the gated architecture give significantly better predictions as the ungated one or the arma system reported by @xcite .",
    "obviously , the gated ann architecture resembles the state - input space model of @xcite giving account for changing activity levels .",
    "local linear filters can be calculated in a neighbour of any point in state - input space , the gated ann , however , uses only three levels of activity .    in this paper",
    "we propose a method which allows to consider the changing level of sw fluctuations . instead of building a more structured gated ann architecture we use the extra information on local scaling characteristics of properly introduced measure which can be estimated directly from a time series .",
    "multifractals exhibit time - dependent scaling laws and hence allow a description of irregular phenomena that are localized in time .",
    "multifractal scaling characteristics of geomagnetic fluctuations were studied by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite using multilayer feed - forward ann have shown that the information on multifractal characteristics of geomagnetic data put to the input enhanced the performance of their ann in reconstructing ae - index time series from geomagnetic observatory data .",
    "the inclusion of multifractality , however , somewhat amplified the noise component in this case .",
    "we expect that the inclusion of the scaling characteristics of solar wind and geomagnetic fluctuations to the ann modelling of swmc offers a way for considering essential local information on rapid changes , irregularities and intermittence not considered enough hitherto .",
    "intermittence of sw and geomagnetic fluctuations was not built into nonlinear filter or ann models .",
    "notwithstanding that sw fluctuations proved to be strongly intermittent @xcite and also both nonlinear magnetotail theories @xcite and experimental works @xcite predict or confirm the presence of scalings , multifractality and intermittence within the magnetosphere .",
    "though there exist competing theoretical concepts regarding the underlying physical mechanisms which may or may not produce the observed scalings @xcite these considerations have no effect on our analysis .",
    "we simply ask what are the scaling characteristics of fluctuations and how can this information improve our ability to predict geomagnetic activity using anns .",
    "we consider the accumulated amount of signal energy within a window @xmath8 .",
    "the signal energy @xmath9 within a window @xmath10 is computed as a sum of the squared amplitudes of time series through @xmath11 and @xmath12 where @xmath13 represents a time series , @xmath14 is the total number of data points .",
    "the distribution of @xmath9 in time is considered to be a measure which may also appear as singular .",
    "mathematically , a measure can be characterized by its density .",
    "an erratic behaviour appears in the absence of a density for a singular measure .",
    "generally , singular distributions can be characterized locally by the so - called singularity or hlder exponents @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "loosely speaking , the exponent @xmath0 quantify the degree of regularity or irregularity ( singularity ) in a distribution or a function in a point @xmath15 .",
    "usually , the measure @xmath16 within a window @xmath10 scales as @xmath17 .",
    "therefore , @xmath0 can be estimated by a regression method using @xmath18 taking different window lengths @xmath10 . for a monofractal @xmath19 for all @xmath15 , while in a case of multifractal measure ( non - uniform distribution ) @xmath0 changes from point to point ( non - stationarity ) .",
    "for instance , fractional brownian motion or continuous it processes represent self - affine fluctuations governed by a single hlder exponent .",
    "the global distribution of singularity exponents @xmath0 for geomagnetic fluctuations was studied by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it was shown that on the time scale of substorms and storms geomagnetic fluctuations seem to be analogous to the simple multiplicative @xmath20-model which describes energy cascade processes in turbulent flows .",
    "this model explains how a specific energy flux introduced on large scales to a flow can lead to non - homogeneous , intermittent energy distributions on small scales . on this basis",
    "we expect that in case of homogeneous energy transfer rate between scales with no intermittency effects , the above defined distribution will be stationary and @xmath21 for all @xmath15 . otherwise , @xmath22 indicate irregularities , sharp variations around @xmath15 , while @xmath23 is found in regions where events are more regular @xcite . in case of multifractal processes",
    "@xmath0 changes from point to point , which usually makes difficult the numerical estimation of @xmath0 s . a number of papers deals with this question @xcite .",
    "though the hlder exponents do not characterize the local regularity properties of a signal completely @xcite , we are going to use the simple relation ( 3 ) to show that even a rough estimation of local scaling characteristics of the signal may enhance the performance of anns .",
    "we note that a running numerical estimate of @xmath0 may fluctuate sharply for other , from multifractality different , nonstationary processes .",
    "a layered backpropagation ann model @xcite with feedback connection from output layer to input layer was constructed .",
    "the output - input layer connection makes the output history to be an ordinary input unit in training process .",
    "the output of the model can be expressed in the form @xmath24 where @xmath25 denotes the @xmath1 time series ; the two inputs equal @xmath26 and @xmath27 ; @xmath28 the history ; @xmath29 the time resolution ( @xmath30 h ) ; @xmath31 the weights between input and hidden layers ; @xmath32 the weights between hidden and output layers ; @xmath33 the biases of the layers ; @xmath34 the number of hidden units ; @xmath35 and @xmath36 the nonlinear activation function . in our model @xmath36",
    "are the hyperbolic tangent and @xmath35 the linear activation functions and @xmath37 .",
    "the performance of the ann model was evaluated through root mean squared error ( @xmath38 ) and correlation coefficient ( @xmath39 ) @xmath40 @xmath41 where @xmath42 denotes an actual output , @xmath43 its mean value and @xmath44 a one - step ahead prediction of ann , @xmath43 its mean value ; @xmath14 is their length ; @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the standard deviations of @xmath42 and @xmath44 .",
    "in this paper we are going to predict the @xmath1 index one hour in advance using the layered backpropagation ann model with feedback connection . prior to that",
    ", we show several examples which demonstrate that the hlder exponents estimated by equation 3 provide local characteristics of the analysed time series sensitive enough to capture the necessary information on the abrupt changes and activity levels .",
    "figure 1a shows interplanetary magnetic field ( imf ) variations registered by the ace satellite which is continuously monitoring the sw at the @xmath47 earth - sun lagrange point .",
    "the time resolution is 16 _ s _ and 5 hours of data is shown from january 14 , 1998 , 05:20 ut .",
    "this is a time period of very low activity level with mean value of imf ace @xmath48 fluctuations of 3 nt .",
    "the hlder exponents estimated within variable window length @xmath49 _ s _ at each point are depicted in figure 1b .",
    "it is visible that @xmath0 fluctuates around its mean value @xmath50 , which means that the measure is almost uniformly distributed .",
    "the energy content of the signal @xmath9 , and its scaling with window length , that is @xmath51 , is shown in a log - log plot in figure 1c .",
    "in contrast with figure 1 , figure 2 shows a more disturbed period of imf ace @xmath48 variations from march 31 , 2001 from 00:00 to 05:00 ut .",
    "the mean value of @xmath48 is 43 nt .",
    "large departures from @xmath52 are present ( figure 1b ) , mainly within time periods of enhanced fluctuations .",
    "these periods are characterized by sudden increase of regularity ( @xmath53 ) followed by periods of low regularity ( @xmath54 ) or vice - versa .",
    "in fact , @xmath0 appears to be a sensitive indicator of fluctuations which may occur during periods of enhanced imf @xmath48 amplitudes , however , when the fluctuations cease , the values of @xmath0 return to @xmath50 , independently on the actual amplitudes .",
    "a good example of it is visible within the time interval @xmath55 _ s _ in figures 2 a , b , where @xmath56 nt and @xmath57 .",
    "moreover , the local fluctuations of @xmath0 around @xmath58 seem to be larger when the gradient of @xmath48 increases , but it is not always valid ( not shown ) .",
    "there is also a clear difference between the scalings in figure 1c and 2c .",
    "we conclude that , besides the amplitude of magnetic field variations , the local scaling properties of signal described by hlder exponents @xmath0 ( equation 3 ) may represent an essential piece of information the consideration of which would allow a better prediction of future geomagnetic activity .",
    "other examples of longer period data sets ( from march 19 to april 25 , 2001 ) are depicted in figure 3 .",
    "this time , imf @xmath4 from ace satellite and the @xmath1 index are considered with time resolution of 1 hour .",
    "the thick line in figure 3a corresponding to @xmath59 nt highlights periods of enhanced swmc .",
    "@xcite have shown that the interplanetary causes of intense magnetic storms ( @xmath60 nt ) are long duration ( @xmath61 h ) large and negative ( @xmath62 nt ) @xmath4 events associated with interplanetary duskward electric fields @xmath63 $ ] .",
    "comparison of figures 3a , d shows an agreement with the above criteria , that is , long duration negative imf @xmath4 events occur together with intense magnetic storms .",
    "horizonthal thick line corresponds to the limit of @xmath64 nt in figure 3d .",
    "figure 3b shows the normalized measure @xmath9 and the estimated hlder exponents are in figure 3c .",
    "approximately the same behaviour is visible as previously ( figure 2 ) , which may be even better visualised by drawing 3d plots of time , imf @xmath4 or @xmath1 index and the corresponding hlder exponents as in figures 4a , b. in both cases when the above mentioned physical limits of amplitudes ( @xmath65 nt and @xmath66 nt ) are crossed , the hlder exponents have their local minima , @xmath54 , indicating sharp irregular variations .",
    "intense magnetic storms ( @xmath67 nt and @xmath54 ) are usually preceeded by sudden increases of @xmath68 , that is , by short periods of increased regularity ( figure 4b ) .",
    "the same effect is present in @xmath4 time series ( figure 4a ) , though , except the large event around @xmath69 300 hours , it is less visible .",
    "we expect that precisely the interplay between regularity / irregularity and amplitude characteristics should be learnt by anns to achieve superior performance .",
    "the simplest way to realize that is to add , besides the amplitudes of the analysed variables , the corresponding series of hlder exponents to the ann input .",
    "the following ace sw parameters with @xmath30 hour time resolution were used : @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath4 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath3 .",
    "the time evolution of 1 hour @xmath1 index from january 1 to july 28 , 2001 was considered .",
    "the time series of sw parameters were preprocessed using principal component ( @xmath74 ) analysis @xcite .",
    "the linear combinations of normalized sw parameters , their derivatives and combinations : @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath4 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath3 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 were used for the calculation of the @xmath74 s .",
    "it was shown by @xcite , that for the considered set of sw parameters , most of the variance of sw fluctuations is controlled by the first two components . in this paper",
    "we use @xmath85 and @xmath86 as sw input time series .",
    "the local scaling characteristics of the principal components are described in the same way as of the other sw parameters .",
    "the time interval under study was divided into two subsets .",
    "the first one ( part a in figure 5 ) from january 1 to march 14 , 2001 was used for ann training while the second one ( part b in figure 5 ) from march 15 to july 28 , 2001 represented independent set for prediction , not included in ann training process .",
    "the influence of inclusion of local hlder exponents on ann performance was tested for a set of values of history @xmath28 and window length @xmath10 , whilst @xmath87 . in all",
    "cases analysed here a feedback consisting of past @xmath28 values of @xmath1 index was set .",
    "figure 6 shows the dependence of correlation coefficient @xmath39 ( equation 6 ) in three different cases : 1 . )",
    "hlder exponents @xmath0 are not considered on input at all - only @xmath85 , @xmath86 and the @xmath1 feedback with history @xmath28 ( indicated by a continuous line ) ; 2 . )",
    "hlder exponents of @xmath85 and @xmath86 vectors are added as input ( marked by `` @xmath88 '' ) ; 3 . ) as in case 2 . ) , but hlder exponents describing the local scaling properties of past @xmath1 values are also added as an extra input ( depicted by `` o '' ) .",
    "the effect of the inclusion of hlder exponents is evident mainly in the superior performance of anns in case 3 .",
    "the correlation coeficient @xmath39 achieves its maximum @xmath89 at @xmath90 h and decreases with increasing @xmath28 and @xmath10 . at the same time ann performance",
    "is practically unchanged in cases 1 and 2 when @xmath28 and @xmath10 increase .",
    "we mention that without the @xmath1 feedback @xmath39 slowly increases with @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "as it can be seen , the consideration of scaling properties of @xmath85 and @xmath86 sw data enhances a little the performance level of ann , but a real improvement is achieved when the singularity or regularity properties of geomagnetic fluctuations are taken into account , too ( case 3 ) .",
    "it seems to confirm our expectation that the information on local scaling properies of signals put to the input layer allows to learn input - output relations better accounting for changing activity levels more effectively .",
    "the analysis of @xmath38 ( equation 5 ) leads to the same conclusion . for demonstration 1 hour ahead predictions of an intense geomagnetic storm",
    "are shown in figure 7a .",
    "two methods are compared ( figure 7b , c ) : case 1 as defined above , when the @xmath1 index is predicted without hlder exponents and case 3 , with the information on @xmath0 s ( @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath1 ) added to the input layer ( the cases 1 and 2 are similar ) . easy to recognize that the method using @xmath0 s ( case 3 ) allows to predict almost all the variance in the data with @xmath91 and @xmath92",
    "nt having @xmath93 h. at the same time @xmath94 , @xmath95 nt for @xmath93 h ( figure 6 in case without hlder exponents ) . in comparison ,",
    "@xcite have exploited elman recurrent anns to predict the @xmath1 index 1 hour ahead only from sw data .",
    "they achieved @xmath96 and @xmath97 nt .",
    "we presented a prediction technique which uses the extra information on local scaling exponents to improve the performance of a layered ann with feedback .",
    "it was demonstrated that the hlder exponents @xmath0 are time dependent and change from point to point exhibiting large deviations from the mean value @xmath98 , mainly during enhanced activity levels of fluctuations . a peculiar interplay between regularity / irregularity features ( described by @xmath0 ) and",
    "amplitude characteristics of disturbances was found and demonstrated on examples of sw and geomagnetic data .",
    "ann performance was significantly improved by putting the hlder exponent time series of corresponding sw and geomagnetic past data to the input layer yielding the least @xmath38 error of 2 nt for short history @xmath99 h and window length @xmath100 h. the results obtained without hlder exponents were the worst ( @xmath101 nt ) .",
    "only a small improvement if any was achieved when the hlder exponents of sw @xmath85 and @xmath86 were added only ( @xmath102 nt ) .",
    "it means that to understand and model better the magnetospheric response , in addition to sw input and geomagnetic history ( feedback ) , the scaling and irregularity / regularity features of magnetospheric fluctuations should also be taken into account .",
    "it is not an unexpected result , however , because recent nonlinear theories on swmc or magnetotail dynamics involve or predict the appearance of scalings , irregularities ( singularities ) and turbulence @xcite . to fully exploit this approach on experimental basis",
    ", further investigations of scalings and singularity features of fluctuations in different inner and outer regions of the magnetosphere will be necessary .",
