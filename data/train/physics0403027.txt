    "the neutron - proton mass difference has for thirty years been believed to be electromagnetic in origin , and it offers a splendid experimental test of any theory which tries to cover the borderline between electromagnetic and strong interactions .",
    "however , no convincing theory of the mass - difference had appeared before 1964 . in this connection",
    "i exclude as unconvincing all theories , like the early theory of feynman and speisman , which use one arbitrary cut - off parameter to fit one experimental number .",
    "dashen for the first time made an honest calculation without arbitrary parameters and got the right answer .",
    "his method is a beautiful marriage between old - fashioned electrodynamics and modern bootstrap techniques .",
    "he writes down the equations expressing the fact that the neutron can be considered to be a bound state of a proton with a negative pi meson , and the proton a bound state of a neutron with a positive pi meson , according to the bootstrap method . then into these equations he puts electromagnetic perturbations , the interaction of a photon with both nucleon and pi meson , according to the feynman rules .",
    "the calculation of the resulting mass difference is neither long nor hard to understand , and in my opinion , it will become a classic in the history of physics . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    dyson was talking about the papers by r. f. dashen and s. c. frautschi published in the physical review  @xcite .",
    "they use the s - matrix formalism for bound states , and then derive a formula for a perturbed energy level using the s - matrix quantities .",
    "of course , they use approximations because they are dealing with strong interactions .",
    "there are however `` good '' approximations and `` bad '' approximations .    if we translate what they did into the language of the schrdinger picture of quantum mechanics , dashen and frautschi were using the following approximation for the bound - state energy shift  @xcite @xmath0 where the good and bad bound - state wave functions are like @xmath1 & { } & \\phi^{bad } \\sim e^{br } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for large values of @xmath2 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ goodbad ] .",
    "the schrdinger equation is a second - order differential equation with two solutions . if the energy positive , there are two running - wave solutions . for negative energies ,",
    "the two solutions take `` good '' and  bad \" forms as indicated in eq.([wfs ] ) .",
    "the good wave function is normalizable and carries probability interpretation .",
    "the bad wave function is not normalizable , and can not be given any physical interpretation .",
    "if we demand that this bad wave function disappear , energy - levels become discrete .",
    "this is how the bound - state energy levels are quantized .    in the s - matrix formalism ,",
    "the bound - states appear as poles in the complex energy plane .",
    "those bound - state poles correspond to``good '' localized wave functions in the schrdinger picture . at all other places , there are unlocalized `` bad '' wave functions .",
    "dashen and frautschi overlooked this point when they used approximations in the s - matrix theory , and ended up with the `` bad '' formula given in eq.([shift ] ) .    yes !",
    "dashen and frautschi made a serious mistake in 1964 , but why do we have to raise this issue now ?",
    "the answer is very simple . since 1956",
    ", there appeared many words in physics , including dispersion relations , mandelstam representation , regge poles , s - matrix theory , n / d method , and bootstrap dynamics .",
    "each of these words dominated the physics during its own period .",
    "however , they are now completely forgotten .",
    "the reason is that these temporary topics failed to place themselves to the historical roadmap .",
    "these days , there is one domineering word in physics , particularly in particle theory .",
    "it is of course _ string theory_. in view of the recent history , the question arises whether this theory will also be lost in history or will find its proper place in the roadmap landmarked by einstein , heisenberg , schrdinger , dirac , wigner , and feynman .",
    "the purpose of string theory is to understand the physics inside relativistic particles .",
    "since particles are localized entities in space - time , string theory necessarily has to deal with standing waves . as in the case of of the dashen - frautschi fiasco",
    ", it is difficult to produce standing waves within the s - matrix , or with feynman diagrams . for standing wave problems , it would be much easier to start with standing waves .",
    "we avoid standing waves because it is difficult to lorentz - boost them , while it is a trivial matter to write down plane waves in a lorentz - covariant manner .",
    "the expression for plane waves is lorentz - invariant .",
    "indeed , quantum field theory is possible because the plane waves are invariant .",
    "plane waves are running waves .",
    "standing waves are superposition of running waves in opposite directions",
    ". do those superpositions remain invariant under lorentz boosts ?",
    "no , but they are still covariant .",
    "this is the question we wish to exploit from the 1971 paper of feynman , kislinger and ravndal  @xcite .    in discussing standing waves ,",
    "it is common to start with a hard - wall potential , but mathematically it is more comfortable to use harmonic oscillators . indeed , in their paper of 1971 ,",
    "start with a lorentz - invariant harmonic oscillator equation  @xcite .",
    "this equation has many different solutions satisfying different boundary conditions .",
    "the solution they use is not normalizable in time - separation variable , and can not be given any physical interpretation .",
    "on the other hand , it is possible to fix up their mathematics .",
    "their lorentz - invariant differential equation has normalizable solutions which can form a representation space for wigner s little group for massive particles  @xcite , whose transformations leave the four - momentum of invariant .",
    "the little group dictates the internal space - time symmetry .",
    "the normalizable oscillator solutions can be lorentz - boosted and can be used to show that quarks and partons are two different manifestations of one covariant theory , as @xmath3 and @xmath4 are two different limits of einstein s energy - momentum relation .    these ingredients obtained from feynman and wigner could serve as the starting point for standing waves in the lorentz - covariant world . if string theory is going to survive in history , it should find its own place in the historical raodmap .",
    "if string theory is solve the problem within a particle , it is necessarily a theory of standing waves .",
    "the issue is how to treat standing waves in einstein s covariant world .    in sec .",
    "[ lamb ] , we point out what dyson says is correct but he gives a wrong example .",
    "indeed , quantum field theory can become effective when combined with different branches of physics .",
    "we illustrate this point using the calculation of the lamb shift .    in sec  [ waves ]",
    ", we note that there are running waves and standing waves in quantum mechanics .",
    "while it is trivial to lorentz - boost running waves , it requires covariance of boundary conditions to understand fully standing waves . in sec .",
    "[ wfsma ] , we study the s - matrix constructed from non - relativistic scattering theory . the advantage of this approach is to trace the behavior of wave functions in the s - matrix .",
    "while the bound - state in the s - matrix theory corresponds to a pole in the complex energy plane , it comes from the localization of the wave function in the schrdinger picture .",
    "approximations in the s - matrix does not always guarantee the localization of the bound - state wave function .",
    "this is the cause of the mistake dashen and frautschi made .    in sec .",
    "[ histobs ] , we review the history of bound and scattering states from comets and planets .",
    "it was newton who observed first that the same physics is applicable to both comets and planets .",
    "again , the same physics applies to scattering and bound states in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics .",
    "the question is what happens in einstein s lorentz - covariant world .",
    "feynman diagrams work for scattering states , but feynman suggested the use of harmonic oscillators to approach standing - wave problems in the lorentz - covariant world .    in sec",
    "[ stsym ] , we discuss the space - time symmetry applicable to relativistic extended particles .",
    "this symmetry is dictated by wigner s little group  @xcite .",
    "we review the progress made in this field . in sec .",
    "[ covham ] , it is shown possible to construct the covariant harmonic oscillator wave functions .",
    "these wave functions can be lorentz - boosted , but they depend on the time - separation variable . as a physical application of this covariant harmonic oscillator formalism ,    it is shown in sec .",
    "[ par ] that the quark and parton models are two different manifestation of the same covariant entity .",
    "the most controversial aspect of feynman s parton picture is that the partons interact incoherently with external signals .",
    "this puzzle can be explained within the framework of this oscillator formalism .    in sec .",
    "[ string ] , in view of feynman s efforts , we point out that there is a well - defined place for string theory in the einstein s roadmap landmarked by heisenberg , schrdinger , wigner , dirac and feynman .",
    "string theory belongs to bound states or standing waves in the lorentz - covariant world .",
    "it is a well - accepted view that dyson gave a wrong example for the combination of field theory and other branches of physics . yet , dyson was right in indicating that old - fashioned field theory could be more effective when combined with other branches of physics which produce physics which field theory can not produce .",
    "the lamb - shift calculation is an excellent example .",
    "quantum electrodynamics leads to a delta - function - like perturbing potential for the hydrogen atom .",
    "the @xmath5 wave function does not vanish at the origin while the @xmath6 does .",
    "thus the first - order perturbation formula leads an energy shift for the @xmath7 while leaving the @xmath6 unchanged .",
    "of course the delta - function perturbing potential is one of the triumphs of quantum electrodynamics . on the other hand",
    ", qed can not produce localized wave functions for the hydrogen atom .",
    "we need the schrdinger or dirac equation with the static coulomb potential to obtain those wave functions needed for the lamb - shift calculation .    in order to calculate those localized",
    "bound - state wave functions , we have to impose boundary conditions at infinity .",
    "this localization condition is not properly addressed in qed or any other forms of quantum field theory .    indeed , the wave functions used in the lamb - shift calculation do not come from quantum field theory .",
    "dyson was right in saying that field theory could be more effective if coupled with other branches of physics .",
    "the dashen - frautschi fiasco teaches us an important lesson .",
    "there are running waves and standing waves in quantum mechanics .",
    "even though the standing wave is a superposition of running waves , it requires an additional care of boundary conditions .",
    "we do not know how to deal with this problem in the s - matrix formalism .",
    "if not impossible , it is very difficult to formulate lorentz boosts for rigid bodies . on the other hand",
    ", it seems to be feasible to boost waves .",
    "indeed , quantum mechanics allows us to look at extended object as wave packets or standing waves .",
    "thus , we are interested in boosting waves .",
    "we should note here also that there are standing and running waves .",
    "plane waves are running waves .",
    "it is trivial to lorentz - boost the plane wave of the form @xmath8 because the exponent is invariant under lorentz transformations .",
    "however , what would happen when different waves are superposed ? would the spectral function be covariant or invariant ? what would happen for standing waves which consist of superposition of waves moving in opposite directions ?    while quantum field theory based on feynman diagrams starts with running waves , quantum mechanics within a localized space - time region deals with standing waves . if string theory is set to solve the problem inside particles , the physics of string theory is necessarily the quantum mechanics of standing waves , as is indicated in fig .",
    "[ dff11 ] .    in an attempt to obtain the answers to these questions",
    ", we can start with some examples .",
    "as usual in quantum mechanics , the first example for standing waves should be a set of harmonic oscillator wave functions . with this point in mind , let us see what feynman did for harmonic oscillators in the relativistic regime .",
    "because of the success of quantum field theory which leads to the s - matrix as the calculational tool , physicists were led to believe all the problems in physics . if this was not the case , the s - matrix should be the source of information for all physical processes .",
    "on the other hand , the s - matrix is derivable from two fundamental theories .",
    "one is of course quantum field theory .",
    "the other is the quantum mechanics of schrdinger and heisenberg , which leads to non - relativistic potential scattering .",
    "indeed , much of the axioms or assumptions in the s - matrix theory is based on analytic properties of the s matrix in the complex energy plane . in particular",
    ", the bound state in potential scattering corresponds to a pole on in the negative energy axis .",
    "thus , a perturbed energy - level corresponds to a displaced bound - state pole .",
    "since the s - matrix can be formulated in a lorentz - covariant manner , we can study the covariant picture of bound - states by studying the s - matrix poles .",
    "on the other hand , the s - matrix in both field theory and potential scattering is basically a device to study scattering problems and is therefore formulated in terms of running waves .",
    "it does not address the localization problem of bound - state wave functions . in quantum field theory , the s - matrix can not accommodate this localization problem because there are no localized wave functions in field theory . in potential scattering",
    "we are dealing with solutions of the schrdinger equation which can accommodate both running and standing waves .",
    "let us see how we can derive the first - order energy shift for perturbed bound - state poles .",
    "we start with an attractive potential @xmath9 . for simplicity",
    ", we assume that it is spherically symmetric .",
    "then the radial schrdinger equation for the @xmath10th partial wave can be written as @xmath11 v_0(r')\\phi_{\\ell}(r')dr ' , \\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the @xmath10th radial wave function .",
    "we define @xmath13 and @xmath14 as @xmath15 if we add a small perturbing potential @xmath16 , then the perturbed wave function @xmath17 satisfies the equation @xmath18 & { } & \\hspace{3mm}\\times \\int_{0}^{r }   \\left[n_{\\ell}(kr)j_{\\ell}(kr')- j_{\\ell } j(kr)n_{\\ell}(kr')\\right ] \\left[v_0(r ' ) + \\delta v(r')\\right]\\psi_{\\ell}(r')dr ' , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the perturbed wave function satisfies also the `` full - greens - function '' integral equation : @xmath19 which , to lowest order in @xmath16 , takes the form    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the `` full green s function '' constructed from the solutions of eq.([weq00 ] ) .    for simplicity ,",
    "we now restrict ourselves to the s wave and drop the subscript @xmath10 .",
    "the generalization to higher partial waves seems to be trivial .",
    "then the integral equations in eqs .",
    "( [ weq00 ] ) , ( [ weq11 ] ) , and ( [ weq22 ] ) take the following forms . @xmath22 & { } & \\psi ( r ) = j_{\\ell}(kr)+ { 1 \\over k } \\int_{0}^{r } \\sin k(r - r ' ) [ v(r ' ) + \\delta v(r ' ) ] \\psi(r')dr ' , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath23 to lowest - order in @xmath24 .    in order to obtain the s matrix from the above solutions ,",

    "how can we extract probability interpretation from this covariant wave function ?",
    "it is a widely accepted view that hadrons are quantum bound states of quarks having localized probability distribution . as in all bound - state cases ,",
    "this localization condition is responsible for the existence of discrete mass spectra .",
    "the most convincing evidence for this bound - state picture is the hadronic mass spectra which are observed in high - energy laboratories  @xcite .    in 1969 , feynman observed that a fast - moving hadron can be regarded as a collection of many `` partons '' whose properties appear to be quite different from those of the quarks  @xcite .",
    "for example , the number of quarks inside a static proton is three , while the number of partons in a rapidly moving proton appears to be infinite .",

    "this aspect of the squeeze has been exhaustively discussed in the literature  @xcite .",

    "the wave functions become continuously squeezed until they become concentrated along their respective positive light - cone axes .",
    "let us look at the z - axis projection of the space - time wave function .",
    "indeed , the width of the quark distribution increases as the hadronic speed approaches that of the speed of light .",
    "the position of each quark appears widespread to the observer in the laboratory frame , and the quarks appear like free particles .",

    "however , according to our lorentz - squeezed space - time and momentum - energy wave functions , the space - time width and the momentum - energy width increase in the same direction as the hadron is boosted .",

    "we started with the covariant oscillator wave function as a purely phenomenological mathematical instrument .",
    "we then noticed that the covariant oscillator formalism can serve as a representation of the wigner s little group for massive particles , capable of the fundamental symmetry representation for relativistic particles .",
