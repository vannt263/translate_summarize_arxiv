    "herschel_-based dust mass was three orders of magnitude larger ( 0.40.7@xmath2 ) than previously reported .",

    "possible ways to reduce the dust mass derived for sn  1987a have been proposed , including line contamination in the _ herschel _ filter band - passes . because the initial detection was made from fast - scan observations ( leading to spatial under - sampling for pacs ) during the _ herschel _ heritage survey of the lmc @xcite , and because possible line contamination needed to be evaluated , we obtained _ herschel _ dedicated pacs and spire observations of sn 1987a in 2012 using both their photometric and spectroscopic modes , which we report here .",

    "the mid - infrared observations of sn 1987a at early times ( @xmath22 1000 days ) implied much smaller ejecta dust masses than derived from the _ herschel _ measurements , e.g. @xcite estimated a dust mass of @xmath74@xmath2 , and later radiative transfer analyses have confirmed that there was @xmath22few@xmath75@xmath2 of dust at those epochs @xcite .",
    "the large difference between the ejecta dust masses measured then and now implies that the dust mass must have increased significantly over the last 20 years .",
    "the processes to form such a large dust mass over 20years may involve dust grain growth . for overall c / o number ratios of less than unity , the chemical models of @xcite predict that carbon atoms should be primarily locked up in co molecules at early times ( @xmath221000days ) , preventing the formation of a large mass of amorphous carbon ( at most @xmath76@xmath2 ) .",
    "@xcite suggested that a possible solution to forming amorphous carbon is the dissociation of co by energetic electrons created by compton scattering of @xmath77-rays from radioactive decays .",
    "as the ejecta expands and the gas density reduces , the shielding of electrons could decrease , potentially making co dissociation more efficient .",
    "additionally , a small fraction of the x - ray radiation from the ring @xcite could potentially penetrate into the clumpy ejecta , dissociating co @xcite .",
    "the dissociation rate of co depends heavily on the gas density and extinction , increasing at lower densities . while the ejecta expands ,",
    "the gas density decreases , thus the co dissociation rate could have increased with time . if atoms or molecules accrete onto existing dust grains , the total dust mass should increase with time .",
    "the supernova explosion produced radioactive isotopes , and the energy generated by their decay should serve as the main heating source of the ejecta .",
    "@xmath78ti is predicted to have become the main radioactive heating source several years after the explosion @xcite .",
    "the deposited energy from @xmath78ti , extrapolated from @xcite , is estimated to have been 412@xmath79 in 2012 .",
    "this is sufficient to heat the ejecta dust grains , which have a total luminosity of 230@xmath79 . in the sn system ,",
    "x - ray radiation from the ring can provide a large luminosity of @xmath80@xmath79 @xcite .",
    "however , since as seen from the equatorial ring , the ejecta core occupies only about 5% of the sky , only a small fraction of this luminosity ( about @xmath65@xmath79 ) may reach the ejecta .",
    "so currently @xmath78ti should be the main dust heating source .",
    "the temperature of the dust in the ejecta of sn  1987a is found to be confined to a small range , and this may also support @xmath78ti as the main heating source for the dust in the ejecta .",
    "the expected diffuse distribution of @xmath78ti within the ejecta seems more likely to heat the dust grains relatively uniformly , whereas external x - ray heating should produce a dust grain temperature gradient within the ejecta .    that the temperature of dust emission from sn 1987a can be fitted by a single temperature component is a significant difference from the crab nebula , an older supernova remnant , which shows a broader range of dust temperatures @xcite .",
    "this is most likely caused by the different heating sources and distributions of dust with respect to the heating sources . while the main heating source in the ejecta of sn  1987a is @xmath78ti decays , the main dust heating source in the crab nebula is synchrotron radiation from its pulsar wind nebula @xcite .",
    "we have presented dedicated _ herschel _ observations of sn 1987a , taken in 2012 .",
    "our photometric and spectroscopic observations confirm that its far - infrared emission is dominated by thermal dust emission from the ejecta , with a minimal contribution from lines , confirming previous analyses that a large mass of dust has formed in the ejecta after the explosion .",
    "if we consider predicted elemental mass limits , we would conclude that it is most likely to have formed 0.8@xmath2 dust in the ejecta , consisting of a combination of 0.5  m@xmath7 of silicates and 0.3  m@xmath7 of amorphous carbon .",
    "if the currently predicted nucleosynthetic limit of @xmath140.25  m@xmath7 of carbon is ignored , then the minimum dust mass that can fit the observed sed is 0.5  m@xmath7 of amorphous carbon",
    ".    it will be interesting to monitor the ejecta dust in the future , when the main ejecta plunges into the circumstellar ring .",
    "as the ejecta expand , the ejecta dust should interact with reverse shocks , with the potential destruction of dust grains ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the efficiency of destruction depends on the position angle of the ejecta with respect to the ring . if most of the ejecta dust can survive future reverse shocks , and future ejecta - ambient ism shocks , then ccsne such as sn1987a may provide a major source of the dust found in the isms of galaxies ( e.g. *",
