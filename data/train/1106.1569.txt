    "the purpose of the present paper is to probe the variability of @xmath2 in the milky way using narrow emission lines of the methanol masers .",
    "the microwave spectrum of ch@xmath0oh  is very rich because of the internal rotation of the oh group .",

    "this hamiltonian is physically transparent and sufficiently accurate for calculations of sensitivity coefficients .",
    "all six parameters of the rf model have clear physical meaning and their dependence on @xmath2 is easily understood within the born - oppenheimer approximation .    to show how rotational parameters scale with @xmath2",
    ", we consider an example of a diatomic molecule in its ground vibrational state : @xmath19 where @xmath20 corresponds to the equilibrium internuclear distance @xmath21 and @xmath22 is the vibrational correction .",
    "it is clear that @xmath23 , but @xmath22 has an additional dependence on @xmath2 via the vibrational wave function and , hence , scales as @xmath24 .",
    "thus , there is no one - to - one correspondence between terms of the effective hamiltonian and the terms of the born - oppenheimer perturbation theory . as a result ,",
    "@xmath25 scales as @xmath26 , with @xmath27 .",
    "typically , @xmath28 is of the order of @xmath29 and @xmath30 varies from 0.995 for the no molecule to 0.981 for the h - bearing hf molecule .",
    "we conclude that , in general , the rotational parameters @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 scale linearly with @xmath2 within the uncertainty interval of 12% .",
    "these vibrational corrections are of the same order of magnitude as centrifugal corrections considered in j11 .",
    "both types of corrections are included below in the estimate of the error of the calculated sensitivity coefficients .",
    "the rotational part of the hamiltonian @xmath34 corresponds to the slightly asymmetric top and includes rotational constants @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 ( @xmath35 ) .",

    "this model does not include centrifugal distortions .",
    "interaction of internal rotation with overall rotation is described by a single parameter @xmath41 , which scales linearly with @xmath2 ( lin & swalen 1959 ) . for the rotational degrees of freedom we use the basis set of the prolate symmetric top and plane waves @xmath42 for the internal rotation .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ h1 ] ) mixes waves with @xmath43 .",
    "all relevant matrix elements are tabulated in rf .",
    "the fitted values of the parameters are also given there .",
    "after the effective hamiltonian is formed it is diagonalized numerically . due to the c@xmath0 symmetry of the hamiltonian ( [ h1 ] )",
    "the final eigenstates can be classified as a - type states and twofold degenerate e - type states .",
    "a - type states have definite parity @xmath44 : for a@xmath9 states @xmath45 and for a@xmath46 states @xmath47 . because methanol is close to the symmetric top its states are classified with an approximate quantum number @xmath48 , which corresponds to the projection of the angular momentum @xmath49 on the axis of the ch@xmath0 group . in this study",
    "we are interested only in the lowest states of the internal rotation of a and e symmetry : excitation of higher states requires kinetic temperatures @xmath50k , while warm molecular clouds have typical temperatures @xmath51k .",
    "the ch@xmath0oh  transitions with @xmath52 can be considered approximately as rotational , where the state of the internal motion does not change .",
    "these transitions have ` normal ' sensitivities to @xmath2-variation with @xmath53 .",
    "because our model does not include centrifugal corrections , @xmath6 must be exactly equal to 1 .",
    "we estimate that these corrections do not exceed 3%  for @xmath54 .",
    "the j11 model accounts for these corrections and provides the sensitivity coefficients for the @xmath52 transitions between 1.00 and 1.03 in agreement with our estimates .",
    "we note that this deviation from unity is of the same order of magnitude as the vibrational correction which is not accounted for in both the rf and j11 effective hamiltonians . the transitions with @xmath55 , on the contrary ,",
    "lead to the change in the internal motion and have sensitivities to @xmath2-variation which vary in a wide range .",
    "such transitions are of primary interest for our purpose .    in order to determine the sensitivity coefficients @xmath6 for the microwave transitions we first find the dependence of the eigenvalues @xmath56 on @xmath17 : @xmath57 where the coefficient @xmath58 , individual for each level , shows a response of the level @xmath56 to a small change of @xmath2 ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "this is done by diagonalizing the effective hamiltonian for three sets of the parameters , which correspond to @xmath60 , and @xmath61 , where @xmath62 equals to 0.001 or 0.0001 ( in both cases we obtain the same @xmath63-factors ) .",
    "the parameters @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath41 , and @xmath39 , all scaling linearly with @xmath2 , should then take the values @xmath64 , @xmath65 , etc .",
    ", where the first value @xmath64 corresponds to the fit of the experimental spectrum . the dimensionless sensitivity coefficient @xmath6 for the transition @xmath66 is found through calculation of the corresponding @xmath63-factor @xmath67 where @xmath68 , and @xmath69    the results of calculations for transitions with @xmath55 are listed in table  [ tab_num ] , where we also give experimental and calculated transition frequencies .",
    "one can see that the accuracy of our model is about 1 ghz for all considered transitions .",
    "consequently , the relative error for the high frequency transitions is only a fraction of a percent , but for the lowest frequency 6.7 ghz it is 15% . in order to improve the accuracy of the @xmath6-values we use experimental frequencies in eq .",
    "( [ qmu ] ) . to check the computational procedure we also determined @xmath6 for a few transitions with @xmath70 ( @xmath71 48.4 ghz , @xmath72 96.9 ghz",
    ", @xmath73 96.1 ghz , @xmath74 97.7 ghz , and @xmath75 242.2 ghz ) and for all of them found @xmath76 .",
    "table  [ tab_num ] also lists the errors of the sensitivity coefficients in their last digits which are given in parenthesis .",
    "these errors were estimated in the following way .",
    "the effective hamiltonian from rf includes the rotational and tunneling parts as well as the interaction between them .",
    "the transition frequencies and the sensitivity coefficients are found from the numerical diagonalization of this hamiltonian followed by the numerical differentiation of the results in respect to @xmath2 .",
    "only the low frequency transitions can have an enhanced sensitivity to the @xmath2-variation because they are of a mixed character with the rotational and tunneling contributions to the transition energy : @xmath77 these two contributions have the following dependences on @xmath2 : @xmath78 then , the resultant sensitivity of the transition @xmath79 is given by : @xmath80    let us suppose that the sensitivities @xmath30 and @xmath81 are known with a relative error @xmath62 .",
    "then , the absolute error of @xmath6 is equal to : @xmath82    in order to use this expression to estimate the errors @xmath83 we need to know the decomposition ( [ err1 ] ) and the sensitivity coefficients @xmath30 and @xmath81 . as we discussed earlier , @xmath84 .",
    "we can estimate the tunneling sensitivity to be @xmath85 from the semi - classical ( wkb ) approximation ( e.g. , kozlov et al .",
    "the tunneling part of the transition energy @xmath86 can be estimated from the model of hecht & dennison ( 1957 ) .",
    "the rotational energy @xmath87 is then given by the experimental frequency @xmath79 and eq .",
    "( [ err1 ] ) .",
    "we conservatively estimate the relative error of our calculations of @xmath30 and @xmath81 to be of about 3% , i.e. , @xmath88 . this error is associated with the missing centrifugal distortion and vibration correction which changes the rotational and tunneling frequencies by a few percent at the most .",
    "the resulting errors @xmath83 are estimated from eq .",
    "( [ err4 ] ) .",
    "table  [ tab_num ] shows that the sensitivity coefficients of the mixed rotation - tunneling transitions at low frequencies lie in the range between @xmath89 and @xmath90 . for comparison ,",
    "the h@xmath7 lyman and werner transitions have @xmath91 ( varshalovich & levshakov 1993 ) , and the ammonia inversion transition has @xmath92 ( flambaum & kozlov 2007 ) .",
    "this means that methanol is almost 1000 times more sensitive to the change in @xmath2 than molecular hydrogen and about 10 times more sensitive than ammonia .",
    "besides , ch@xmath0oh  has many lines with different sensitivities of both signs which allows us to estimate @xmath17  from observations of only this one molecule .",
    "this is the advantage over , e.g. , ammonia nh@xmath0 which has the same sensitivity coefficients for the inversion transitions ( 1,1 ) , ( 2,2 ) , etc . , and , hence , requires some rotational transitions of other molecule as a reference in order to trace @xmath17 .",
    "now we can compare our @xmath6 values with the sensitivity coefficients @xmath93 derived in j11 .",
    "we note that @xmath2 was defined in j11 as @xmath94 and , hence , one expects @xmath95 .",
    "this comparison is shown graphically in fig .",
    "the error bars in this figure mark the @xmath4 uncertainties . in total",
    "we have 35 common computations of the sensitivity coefficients .",
    "the theoretical calculations of their values show a good concordance except for the six points at 9.936 , 37.703 , 38.293 , 38.453 , 86.615 , and 86.902 ghz where the discrepancy @xmath96 exceeds the @xmath97 level ( in fig .",

    "the reason for such deviations is not clear .",
    "the highest offsets of @xmath98 and @xmath99 are found for the @xmath100 transitions at 38.293 and 38.452 ghz , respectively , where the rf model should have a sufficiently accurate result . on the other hand ,",
    "the errors of the @xmath93 values were taken in j11 to be 5%  if @xmath101 ( relative error ) or 0.05 if @xmath102 ( absolute error )",
