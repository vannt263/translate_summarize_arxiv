    "during the last couple of decades the statistical hadronization model , first introduced by fermi @xcite and hagedorn @xcite , has been surprisingly successful in describing fundamental properties of systems created in heavy ion collisions , cosmic rays , and elementary particle reactions . in the context of heavy ion collisions",
    "this model has been applied to an extensive set of data on hadron production , ranging form the center of mass energies of the experiments at the sis , ags , sps , and most recently , rhic facilities . for reviews",
    "see @xcite . a systematic evolution of thermodynamic parameters as collision energy ( and size of colliding ions ) is changed @xcite has allowed to establish the ` chemical freeze - out line ' , which is now a vital part in our understanding of the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter .",
    "more controversially this model has also been applied to a range of elementary collisions @xcite , where only few particles are produced , and the picture of a gas of hadrons can hardly be suitable .",
    "the remarkable ability of the statistical model to explain these data has lead to the suggestion @xcite that thermal particle production is a general property of the hadronization process itself , rather than the result of a long sequence of microscopic interactions . in this work we will not argue about possible physical interpretations @xcite of the partition function of statistical mechanics .",
    "however we note that in order to apply a semi - classical approximation a volume of @xmath0 seems to be sufficient @xcite .",
    "one of the answers still outstanding in high energy physics is the one of a possible formation of a deconfined state of matter , where degrees of freedom are quarks and gluons , rather than hadrons , and the nature of the phase transition between these two phases .",
    "the growing interest in the study of event - by - event fluctuations in strong interactions is thus motivated by expectations of anomalies in the vicinity of the onset of deconfinement @xcite and in the case when the expanding system goes through the transition line between quark - gluon plasma and hadron gas @xcite .",
    "in particular , a critical point of strongly interacting matter may be accompanied by a characteristic power - law pattern in fluctuations @xcite .",
    "multiplicity and charge fluctuations have been indeed proposed to be a good discriminating tool between quark - gluon plasma and hadron gas @xcite , provided the signal survives the phase transition and subsequent evolution of the system . however , in order to properly assess the discriminating power of such observables , one should firstly calculate fluctuations in a hadron gas by including all known physical effects , such as conservation laws , quantum statistics , resonance decays , kinematical cuts , finite spatial extension , etc .    only recently , due to a rapid development of experimental techniques , first measurements of fluctuations of particle multiplicities @xcite and transverse momenta @xcite were performed . and in fact one is tempted to interpret recent na49 data on multiplicity fluctuations in most central pb - pb collisions @xcite as the first observation @xcite of the recently predicted canonical suppression of fluctuations .",
    "the most promising region in the phase diagram for observation of critical phenomena seems to be accessible to the sps accelerator @xcite .",
    "a new sps scan program @xcite for different ion sizes as well as center - of - mass energies has been proposed to study strongly interacting systems at different energy densities and life times .",
    "this should be as well our main motivation for further investigation of properties of statistical ensembles .",
    "the aim is the calculation of ` base - line ' fluctuations on top of which one hopes to find unambiguous signals of a phase transition @xcite , a critical point @xcite , or thermal / chemical ( local or global ) non - equilibrium @xcite .",
    "the main subject of the past study has been the mean multiplicity of produced hadrons .",
    "however , there is a qualitative difference in the properties of the mean multiplicity and the scaled variance of multiplicity distributions in statistical models . in the case of the mean multiplicity results obtained in the grand canonical ensemble ( gce ) , canonical ensemble ( ce ) , and microcanonical ensemble ( mce )",
    "approach each other in the large volume limit .",
    "one refers here to as the thermodynamical equivalence of statistical ensembles .",
    "it was recently found @xcite that corresponding results for the scaled variance are different in different ensembles , and thus the choice of ensemble remains a crucial one , even for large systems .    in previous publications",
    "@xcite the focus was on asymptotic values of the scaled variance , or calculations were altogether only performed in the gce @xcite .",
    "in this paper we try to present not only approximations to ce and mce distributions in the large volume limit , but also to find a reasonable approximation scheme for finite system size in an analytical , rather than monte carlo @xcite , approach .",
    "the main subject of this work will be to identify the gce partition function with the characteristic function of a statistical system .",
    "this approach is more effective in terms of mathematical ease as well as in terms of computing time than previous methods .",
    "thus we are presenting for the first time analytical formulas for the final state of a general multi - specie ce or mce hadron gas at finite volume .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec - ggpf ] the generalized partition function",
    "will be introduced and some basic assumptions of this paper will be stated .",
    "section [ cltce ] gives a mathematical approximation to the system partition function in the form of laplace expansion for the ce , while section [ cltmce ] is concerned with the mce formulation of multiplicity distributions in terms of this expansion for a simple quantum gas of massless particles . a general recipe for calculation of the scaled variance",
    "is presented .",
    "resonance decay is included into the system partition function in section [ resdecay ] . in section [ correspondence ]",
    "we show a comprehensive comparison of this method to the previously used microscopic correlator approach .",
    "a method for finite volume corrections is developed in section [ finitevolcorr ] .",
    "section [ boltzmannpiongas ] will present an application of this method in great detail and aims to give some physical interpretation . a summary in section [ conclusion ]",
    "closes the paper .",
    "in textbooks on statistical mechanics ( see e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) often first the mce is introduced , where exact conservation laws for energy - momentum and particle number are imposed .",
    "relaxing the constraints for energy and momentum constitutes the ce , while allowing additionally particle number to fluctuate about some mean value introduces the gce . in a relativistic gas of hadrons quantum numbers ( charges )",
    "will be the conserved quantities rather than particle numbers . in this paper it will prove to be of considerable advantage to start off with the gce formulation and imposing exact conservation laws thereafter .",
    "the basic idea is to define the probability of a given number of particles of some species , @xmath1 , at fixed value of conserved charge , @xmath2 , i.e. the ce distribution @xmath3 , in terms of the gce distributions , @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "thus , the gce partition function will be the basis for all calculations in this work .",
    "generally the ( micro)canonical partition function is obtained from the grand canonical one by multiplication with kronecker ( or dirac ) delta - functions which pick out all microstates consistent with a particular conservation law .",
    "it is often more economical to use the fourier representations delta - functions , rather than the delta - function themselves .",
    "a short example will motivate the following general treatment .",
    "the gce and the ce partition functions @xmath6 and @xmath7 are connected as , @xmath8 where @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 are respectively the system volume , temperature and chemical potential associated with conserved charge @xmath2 .",
    "the probability of finding the gce system in a particular charge state @xmath2 equals to the number of all states with net - charge @xmath2 divided by all accessible states : @xmath12 it is important to note that the gce partition function @xmath6 depends on @xmath13 , while the usual ce partition function does not .",
    "we introduce the generalized grand canonical partition function ( ggpf ) @xmath14 by substitution @xmath15 in @xmath6 .",
    "one then finds : @xmath16 the system with one net - charge , @xmath2 , could be a quite general one and may include different particle species . in the state of chemical equilibrium the chemical potential of any specie @xmath17 equals to @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the charge of a particle of specie @xmath17 . considering only the distribution of particle species @xmath17 , the joint probability @xmath4 to find particle number @xmath1 and net - charge @xmath2 in the gce equals to : @xmath20 similar to eq .",
    "( [ pq-1 ] ) the distribution ( [ pnq-1 ] ) is presented in terms of the ggpf @xmath21 through substitutions @xmath22 , and @xmath23 in the gce partition function @xmath6 .",
    "finally the canonical ( or conditional ) multiplicity distribution @xmath3 is given by : @xmath24 eq .",
    "( [ pnq - ce ] ) presents the ce particle number distribution @xmath3 in terms of two gce distributions , @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "a detailed account of this is given in terms of an ideal boltzmann pion gas in section [ boltzmannpiongas ] .",
    "it is worth noting that eqs.([pq],[pnq-1],[pnq - ce ] ) are as well the basis for any monte carlo approach @xcite . a sampling distribution , usually taken from a boltzmann gce system ,",
    "is used to generate a @xmath25-tuple of particle multiplicities of all considered species .",
    "all ` events ' consistent with certain constraints , like a set of conserved charges , are accepted , while the rest is rejected . on the basis of this set of",
    "all accepted  events  one constructs an ensemble by using a suitable re - weighting scheme to account for quantum statistics and proper normalization .",
    "one is now ready to calculate distributions @xmath3",
    ", i.e. the conditional distributions to find particle multiplicity @xmath1 in the  monte carlo ensemble  , while global charge is fixed to @xmath2 , and therefore observables like mean multiplicity and multiplicity fluctuations .",
    "the advantage of the method presented here is certainly that we proceed in a completely analytical fashion and therefore much unneeded information , like the exact composition of @xmath26 , is ` integrated away ' .    an immediate consequence of eqs.([pq],[pnq-1],[pnq - ce ] ) is that temperature and chemical potentials appear in our formulation of ( micro ) canonical distributions ( as well as in the monte carlo approach @xcite ) . at first sight",
    "this seems to be a serious problem and an unnecessary complication of our initial task to find a reasonable approximation to the ce and mce partition functions .",
    "however , the main technical challenge when numerically integrating the original version of the microcanonical partition function arises from a heavily oscillating integrant .",
    "auxiliary parameters @xmath10 and @xmath27 will produce a very smooth function , for which approximation schemes can be used ( see section [ boltzmannpiongas ] ) .",
    "in fact chemical potentials and temperature can be factored out , and thus our partition function is just the original partition function times some factor ( appendices [ cepartfunc ] and [ mcepartfunc ] ) .",
    "taking the ratio in eq.([pnq - ce ] ) artificially introduced temperature and chemical potential drop out .",
    "the quality of our approximation on the other hand will crucially depend on their choice .",
    "we will show in section [ finitevolcorr ] that the requirement of maximizing the ggpf at some given equilibrium point leads to a unique determination of thermal parameters and moreover constitutes the optimal choice for our approximation scheme .",
    "this prescription is self - consistent and can be shown to be not in contradiction to basic thermodynamic relations known from textbooks @xcite .",
    "taking the gce partition function as a basis , we will throughout this paper use the language of statistical mathematics for calculation of conditional multiplicity distributions in any ensemble .",
    "so it is worthwhile to give a general outline . for any probability distribution function ( pdf )",
    "one can define an associated characteristic function ( cf ) by fourier back - transformation ( appendix [ charfunc ] ) . in this work",
    "we will identify the ggpf as the cf of any gce distribution , and find joint gce distributions , e.g. @xmath4 , by fourier analysis of the ggpf .",
    "in the example above the cf associated with the pdf @xmath4 in eq.([pnq-1 ] ) is @xmath28 , while the cf associated with the pdf @xmath5 in eq.([pq ] ) is @xmath29 .",
    "however , only in the simplest cases one can find an analytical solution for these fourier integrals .",
    "it seems as well to be rather difficult to obtain the cf directly for the pdf @xmath3 , and hence we define @xmath30 .",
    "provided one has knowledge of all ( sufficiently many ) moments of an pdf one can construct the cf and find the exact ( approximate ) pdf . for practical purposes ,",
    "however , cumulants , which are obtained by taylor expansion of the logarithm of the cf , are far better suited .",
    "the method presented here will provide the basis for the following discussion .",
    "we present in detail our calculation of the ce partition function . in this section",
    "we will employ saddle point expansion to approximate the canonical pdf for an ideal hadron resonance gas and focus on the asymptotic solution only .",
    "we first calculate the 3-dim distribution of charges in gce , @xmath31 , namely baryon number , strangeness and electric charge .",
    "in fact our calculation is similar to that of becattini _ et.al . _",
    "@xcite , however we start explicitly from a gce partition function which includes chemical potentials .",
    "we will identify our version of the ce partition function as the un - normalized probability distribution function of conserved charges in gce , and show that this type of integral over the gce partition function generally leads to a gaussian ( multivariate normal ) distribution in the large volume limit . in a next step",
    "we use this result to obtain the 4-dim pdf for gce , @xmath32 , hence the probability to find our gce hadron - resonance gas in a state @xmath33 .",
    "the ratio is the canonical pdf @xmath34 , see eq .",
    "( [ pnq - ce ] ) .",
    "in particular we will present a very simple formula for the asymptotic scaled variance of multiplicity fluctuations .",
    "the canonical system partition function of a hadron resonance gas with three conserved charges , i.e. electric charge @xmath2 , baryon number @xmath35 , and strangeness @xmath36 is given by the triple fourier integral over gce partition function @xcite : @xmath37~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] adopting vector notation for the set of conserved charges @xmath38 and angles @xmath39 we can write eq.([bsqpartfunc ] ) in compact form : @xmath40~ e^{-iq^j\\phi_j } ~   \\exp \\left [ \\sum_{l } z_l \\left ( \\phi_j \\right ) \\right]~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where repeated upper and lower indexes @xmath41 imply summation over @xmath41 .",
