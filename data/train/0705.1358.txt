    "the casimir effect @xcite implies that there is a force acting between closely spaced electrically neutral bodies following from the zero - point oscillations of the electromagnetic field .",
    "the casimir force can be viewed as an extension of the van der waals force to large separations where the retardation effects come into play . within a decade of casimir s",
    "work , lifshitz and collaborators @xcite introduced the role of optical properties of the material into the van der waals and casimir force . in the last few years",
    ", the advances following from both fundamental physics and nanotechnology have motivated careful experimental and theoretical investigations of the casimir effect .",
    "the first modern experiments were made with metal test bodies in a sphere - plate configuration , and their results are summarized in ref .  @xcite . in subsequent experiments the lateral casimir force between corrugated surfaces @xcite and the pressure in the original casimir configuration @xcite have been demonstrated .",
    "later experiments @xcite have brought the most precise determination of the casimir pressure between two metal plates .",
    "the rapid theoretical progress has raised fundamental questions on our understanding of the casimir force between real metals at nonzero temperature .",
    "specifically , the role of conductivity processes and the related optical properties of metals at quasi - static frequencies has become the subject of discussions @xcite .",
    "one of the most important applications of the casimir effect is the design , fabrication and function of micro- and nanoelectromechanical systems such as micromirrors , microresonators , nanotweezers and nanoscale actuators @xcite .",
    "the separations between the adjacent surfaces in such devices are rapidly falling below a micrometer , i.e. , to a region where the casimir force becomes comparable with typical electrostatic forces .",
    "it is important that investigations of the casimir force be done in semiconductors as they are the material of choice for the fabrications of optomechanical , micro- and nanoelectromechanical systems .",
    "while the role of conductivity and optical properties of materials can be checked in metals , semiconductors offer better control of the related parameters ( charge carrier density , defect density , size etc . ) and will provide an exhaustive check of the various models .",
    "reference @xcite pioneered the measurement of the casimir force acting between a semiconductor surface , single crystal si wafer , and a gold coated sphere .",
    "the experimental data obtained for a wafer with the concentration of charge carriers @xmath1 were compared with the lifshitz theory at zero temperature and good agreement was found at a 95% confidence level . at the same time , the theory describing a `` dielectric '' si plate with a concentration @xmath2 was excluded by experiment at 70% confidence .",

    "this is a differential experiment where only the difference of the casimir forces in the presence and in the absence of a laser pulse was measured .",
    "this decreases the experimental error to a fraction of a 1pn and allows one to check the role of conductivity processes in semiconductors at the laboratory temperature @xmath8k .",

    "the data were found to be in excellent agreement with the theoretical difference force computed at @xmath8k under the assumption that in the absence of laser light si possesses a finite static dielectric permittivity .",
    "by contrast , if theory takes into account the dc conductivity of si in the absence of laser light , it is excluded by the data at a 95% confidence level .",
    "this is somewhat analogous to the above - mentioned problems for two real metals where the inclusion of the actual conductivity processes at low frequencies also leads to disagreement with experiment @xcite .",
    "the fundamental questions on the role of scattering processes and conductivity at low frequencies in the casimir force have to be clarified for further progress in the field and this calls for new precise experiments .    in this paper",

    "is oscillated in the horizontal direction below the au coated sphere . as a result ,",
    "the sphere is subject to the difference casimir force which can be measured using the static and dynamic techniques .",
    "this experimental scheme promises a record sensitivity to force differences at the level of 1fn . in the second experiment",
    ", we propose to demonstrate the modulation of the casimir force by optically switching the insulator - metal transition in vo@xmath0 films @xcite . the phase transition between the insulator and metal leads to a change in the charge carrier density of order @xmath9 , which is sufficient to bring about a large change in the casimir force .",
    "for both experiments the related theory is elaborated and the magnitudes of casimir forces are computed with application to the experimental configurations .",

    "the aim of this experiment is to gain a fundamental understanding of the role of carrier density in the casimir force using a nanofabricated patterned semiconductor plate .",
    "the proposed design for the experiment is shown schematically in fig .  1",
    ". the gold coated polystyrene sphere of about 100@xmath5 m radius is attached to a cantilever of an atomic force microscope ( afm ) specially adapted for making sensitive force measurements . instead of the simple single crystal si substrate used in the previous experiments @xcite , here a patterned si plate",

    "next in ( c ) the exposed half of the si wafer is doped with p ions using ion implantation leading to a higher density of electrons in the exposed half in ( d ) .",
    "rapid thermal annealing and chemical mechanical polishing of the patterned si plate will be done as the last step .",
    "this is to ensure that there are no surface features resulting from the fabrication .",
    "similar nanofabrication procedures of semiconductors were used in our previous work @xcite .",
    "sharp transition boundaries between the two sections of si plate of width less than 200 nm are possible .",
    "the limitation comes from interdiffusion and the resolution of the ion implantation procedure to be used .",
    "it might be necessary to further limit interdiffusion by the creation of a narrow 100 nm barrier between the two doped regions .",
    "identically prepared but unpatterned samples will be used to measure the properties which are needed for theoretical computations .",

    "the first important improvement of this experiment , as compared with refs .",
    "@xcite , is the direct measurement of difference forces when the patterned plate is oscillated below the sphere .",
    "this measurement is performed as follows .",
    "the patterned si plate will be mounted on the piezo below a au coated sphere as is shown in fig .  1 .",
    "the si plate is positioned such that the boundary is below the vertical diameter of the sphere .",
    "the distance between the sphere and si plate @xmath18 will be kept fixed and the si plate will be oscillated in the horizontal direction using the piezo such that the sphere crosses the boundary in the perpendicular direction during each oscillation ( a similar approach was exploited in ref .",
    "@xcite for constraining new forces from the oscillations of the au coated sphere over two dissimilar metals , au and ge ) .",
    "the casimir force on the sphere changes as the sphere crosses the boundary .",
    "this change corresponds to the differential force @xmath19 equal to the difference of the casimir forces due to two different charge carriers densities @xmath20 and @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "this causes a difference in the deflection of the cantilever . in order to reduce the random noise by averaging",
    ", the periodic horizontal movement of the plate will be of an angular frequency @xmath21hz .",
    "the amplitude of the plate oscillations is limited by the piezo characteristics , but will be of order 100@xmath22 m , much larger than typical transition region of 200 nm",
    ". the experiment will be repeated for different sphere - plate separations in the region from 100 to 300 nm .",
    "the measurement of absolute separations will be performed by the application of voltages to the test bodies as described in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the second major improvement in this experiment in comparison with all previous measurements of the casimir force is the increased sensitivity .",
    "this will be achieved through the use of the interferometer based low temperature afm capable of operating over wide temperature range spanning from 360 to 4k , and the use of two measurement techniques , a static one and a dynamic one .",
    "a picture of the newly constructed experimental apparatus of a low - temperature afm is shown in fig .  3 . here",
    "the cantilever deflection is measured interferometrically and therefore has much higher sensitivity than photodiodes used in the previous work @xcite .",

    "different theoretical models of conductivity processes at low frequencies lead to predictions differing by approximately 1pn within a wide separation region ( see fig .  5 in sec .",
    "the described setup provides excellent opportunity for precise measurement of forces of order and below 1pn .",

    "the sensitivity ( [ eq2 ] ) presents considerable possibilities for the precise investigation of the difference casimir force @xmath33 .",
    "the second technique for the detection of the difference casimir force is a dynamic one @xcite . here",

    "this is sufficient to bring about a large change in the casimir force . from a fundamental point of view , the modulation of the casimir force due to the phase transition will offer one more precision test of the role of conductivity and optical properties in the lifshitz theory of the casimir force .",
    "this experiment suggests some advantages as compared to the difference force measurement with a patterned plate considered in secs .",
    "ii and iii .",
    "first , because of the large change in the magnitude and bandwidth of the optical properties in a phase transition , the modulation of the casimir force will be larger .",
    "second , an insulator - metal transition does not require the special fabrication of patterned plates with one section having a high carrier density , which might not be compatible with robust device design . keeping in mind that the increase of temperature necessary for the phase transition can be induced by laser light , this opens up the possibility of radically new nanomechanical devices using the casimir force in image detection .",
    "the phase transition can be also brought about through electrical heating of the material .    in this experiment",
    "we propose to measure the change of the casimir force acting between an au coated sphere and a vanadium dioxide ( vo@xmath0 ) film deposited on sapphire substrate which undergoes the insulator - metal transition with the increase of temperature .",
    "it has been known that vo@xmath0 crystals and thin films undergo an abrupt transition from semiconducting monoclinic phase at room temperature to a metallic tetragonal phase at 68@xmath104c @xcite .",
    "the phase transition causes the resistivity of the sample to decrease by a factor of @xmath9 from 10@xmath105 cm to @xmath106 cm ( i.e. , the same change as for two semiconductor half plates in sec .",
    "ii with lower and higher charge carrier densities ) .",
    "in addition , the optical transmission for a wide region of wavelengths extending from @xmath107 m to greater than @xmath108 m , decreases by more than a factor of 10100 .",
    "the schematic of the experimental setup is shown in fig .",
    "7 . in this figure ,",
    "light from a chopped 980 nm laser will be used to heat the vo@xmath0 film @xcite .",
    "about 10100mw power of the 980 nm laser is required to bring about all optical switching of vo@xmath0 films . the same procedure as outlined in sec .",
    "ii ( the static technique ) will be used in the measurement of the modulation of the casimir force including the interferometric detection of cantilever deflection .",
    "the schematic of the setup is similar to the one used in ref .",
    "@xcite in the demonstration of optically modulated dispersion forces .",
    "an important point is that in ref .",
    "@xcite the absorption of light from a 514 nm ar laser led to an increase of charge carrier density .",
    "by contrast , here the wavelength of a laser is selected in such a way that light only leads to heating of a vo@xmath0 film but does not change the number of free charge carriers @xcite .    as a first step towards studying the role of the insulator - metal transition in the casimir force , we have recently fabricated thin films of vo@xmath0 on sapphire plates .",
    "the preliminary results are shown in fig .",
    "it is observed that we have obtained more than a factor of 10 change in the resistivity of the film .",
    "these films were prepared by thermal evaporation of vo@xmath0 powder . while films of appropriate thickness approaching 100 nm and roughness of about 2 nm ( shown in fig .",
    "9 ) can be obtained by this procedure , it is not optimal as it leads to the non - stoichimetric formation of the mixed valence states of the vanadium oxide ( vo@xmath109 ) . in the future",
    "rf magnetron sputtering will be used to make the films @xcite .",
    "vo@xmath0 films using this technique have been shown to have the @xmath9 change in resistivity and a corresponding large change in optical reflectivity and spectrum .",
    "the aim of the proposed experiment on the influence of insulator - metal transition on the casimir force is two fold : applications for actuation of nanodevices through a modulation of the casimir force , and to perform fundamental tests on the theory of dispersion forces . to accomplish this ,",
    "two types of measurements are planned . in the first we plan to demonstrate the modulation of the casimir force through an optical switching of the insulator - metal transition .",
    "this modulation will lead to novel microdevices as optical and electrical switches , optical modulators , optical filters and ir detectors that can be actuated optically through the absorption of ir radiation .",
    "importantly , such devices can be integrated with si technology which is used in the fabriaction of microelectromechanical systems @xcite . in the second type of measurements , the variable temperature atomic force microscope described in sec .",
    "ii will be used to perform precision measurements of the casimir force between a gold coated sphere and vo@xmath0 film . here , the casimir force will be measured at different temperatures from room temperature through 80@xmath104c .",
    "this temperature range spans the dielectric ( semiconducting ) and metal regions of vo@xmath0 .",
    "careful comparison of the experimental data and the theory ( see the next section ) will be done to understand the role of conductivity and losses in both phases of vo@xmath0 .",
    "the casimir force acting between a metal coated sphere and the vo@xmath0 film on a sapphire plate both before and after the phase transition ( i.e. , in the insulating and metal phases or , more exactly , in the semiconductor phases with lower and higher charge carrier densities ) are expressed by the lifshitz formulas in accordance with eqs .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq6 ] ) . as above ,",
    "we label the higher concentration of charge carriers @xmath20 and the lower concentration @xmath14 . to compute the casimir force before and after the phase transition one needs the optical properties of vo@xmath0 on a sapphire plate in a wide frequency region .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the dielectric permittivity of vo@xmath0 is measured and fitted to the oscillator model for both bulk vo@xmath0 and for a system of 100 nm thick vo@xmath0 film deposited on bulk sapphire plate within the frequency region from 0.25ev to 5ev .",

    "it is seen that the difference casimir force from a phase transition changes from 13pn at @xmath89 nm to 1.2pn at @xmath56 nm , i.e. , the magnitudes of the difference from the phase transition are greater than that from the patterned si plate .",

    "both proposed experiments are motivated by the uncertainties in the application of the theory of dispersion forces at nonzero temperature . as was shown above ,",
    "different models of the conductivity of semiconductors at low frequencies used in the literature predict variations of the difference casimir force at the level of 1pn .",
    "an even greater concern is that the model taking into account the dc conductivity of dielectrics violates the nernst heat theorem @xcite .",
    "we have reported an apparatus developed at uc riverside that has the sensitivity of force measurements on the level of 1fn and is well adapted for the systematic investigation of the proposed effects in a wide range of separations .",

    "<S> we propose two novel experiments on the measurement of the casimir force acting between a gold coated sphere and semiconductor plates with markedly different charge carrier densities . in the first of these experiments </S>",
    "<S> a patterned si plate is used which consists of two sections of different dopant densities and oscillates in the horizontal direction below a sphere . the measurement scheme in this experiment is differential , i.e. , allows the direct high - precision measurement of the difference of the casimir forces between the sphere and sections of the patterned plate or the difference of the equivalent pressures between au and patterned parallel plates with static and dynamic techniques , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the second experiment proposes to measure the casimir force between the same sphere and a vo@xmath0 film which undergoes the insulator - metal phase transition with the increase of temperature . </S>",
    "<S> we report the present status of the interferometer based variable temperature apparatus developed to perform both experiments and present the first results on the calibration and sensitivity . </S>",
    "<S> the magnitudes of the casimir forces and pressures in the experimental configurations are calculated using different theoretical approaches to the description of optical and conductivity properties of semiconductors at low frequencies proposed in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the suggested experiments will aid in the resolution of theoretical problems arising in the application of the lifshitz theory at nonzero temperature to real materials . </S>",
    "<S> they will also open new opportunities in nanotechnology . </S>"
