    "the unusual experimental results observed in many aspects of the behaviour of the high temperature superconductors and some heavy fermion systems @xcite , has led to the conjecture that this behaviour can best be explained by some form of non - fermi liquid theory . for strong correlation models that have been put forward to describe these systems",
    "it is very difficult to test the stability of the fermi liquid state due to the strong local interaction @xmath0 .",
    "perturbative methods are unreliable for large values of @xmath0 , and non - perturbative techniques are in general difficult to apply and subject to uncertainties in the approximations that have to be used . with direct numerical methods such as monte carlo calculations",
    "there are very severe size limitations ( and also the ` sign problem ' ) that make it difficult to obtain results for excitations for the thermal energy scale that are required to examine these issues .",
    "it is of some interest , therefore , to study strong correlation impurity models that display similar types of non - fermi liquid behaviour as accurate methods for predicting the behaviour of these systems have been developed , including many exact solutions .",
    "the non - fermi liquid behaviour of the impurity two channel kondo model has already been studied extensively and has been used as a basis for explaining the behaviour of certain heavy fermion compounds @xcite .",
    "it has also been used to interpret the experimental results for certain two level tunnelling systems @xcite .",
    "recently a modified form of the anderson impurity model has been formulated by coleman and schofield @xcite which also displays non - fermi liquid behaviour . in the large @xmath0 limit",
    "the model can be related to a form of the two channel kondo model @xcite , and for small @xmath0 there is a parameter regime where it displays marginal fermi liquid behaviour @xcite .",
    "this model is simple enough so that its behaviour can be studied using the numerical renormalization group techniques ( nrg ) that were used to obtain definitive results for the standard anderson model @xcite .",
    "this modified anderson model , the o(3)-symmetric anderson model ( o(3)-am ) , has the form , @xmath1 apart from the term with the anomalous hybridization matrix element @xmath2 this is the standard anderson model for a localized f level hybridized with a conduction band and an on - site interaction @xmath0 .",
    "the model is taken to be particle - hole symmetric with @xmath3 and @xmath4 . due to the antisymmetry of the dispersion in @xmath5 , the hybridization @xmath6 and the anomalous hybridization @xmath7 have to be antisymmetric ( and are here chosen to be constant ) .",
    "@xmath8 the extra anomalous hybridization term is one in which neither particles nor spin is conserved .",
    "it reduces the symmetry of the standard anderson model at particle - hole symmetry from o(4 ) to o(3 ) ( the o(3)-symmetry is best seen in the majorana fermion formulation @xcite ) .",
    "the motivation for its introduction is that in the large @xmath0 limit the model can be transformed by a schrieffer - wolff transformation @xcite into a localized s - d type of model of the form @xmath9 \\ .\\ ] ] the operators @xmath10 are the spin operators for the conduction electron states defined in terms of the conduction electron creation and annihilation operators ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) in the usual way , @xmath13 @xmath14    the @xmath15 operators are isospin operators for the conduction electrons and these are defined by @xmath16 @xmath17 both sets of operators satisfy the usual su(2 ) commutation relations . the spin and isospin of the conduction electrons are coupled to the impurity spin @xmath18 individually with coupling constants @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively . from the schrieffer - wolff transformation @xcite these coupling constants",
    "are given by @xmath21 this localized model eq .",
    "( 3 ) , which was introduced by coleman , ioffe and tsvelik @xcite , has a form very similar to the two channel kondo model and it has been referred to as the compactified two channel kondo model or ( @xmath22-@xmath23)-model . though it differs from the two channel kondo model in that the impurity spin can not be overscreened by the conduction electrons ( the states with spin and the states with isopin are mutually exclusive and so the can not both be used to screen the impurity at the same time ) it has been argued that it has the same low energy fixed point as the two channel kondo model @xcite . the channel isotropic case ( @xmath24 in eq .",
    "( 6 ) ) , where we expect non - fermi liquid behaviour , corresponds to @xmath25 .",
    "it is clear that the general o(3)-am has a rich range of behaviour and may provide theoretical insights into the controversial questions as the non - fermi liquid behaviour observed in some strongly correlated systems . due to the particle non - conserving terms it is unlikely that the bethe ansatz technique , which has been used to solve many of the strong correlation impurity models , can provide a solution for this case .",
    "the numerical renormalization group method , however , as originally developed by wilson for the kondo problem @xcite , and further used by krishnamurthy et al .",
    "@xcite to obtain definite results for the anderson model in all parameter regimes can be used . in this paper",
    "we apply this approach and give details of the calculation and results for the thermodynamic behaviour ( a brief summary of this work is given in @xcite ) .",
    "the only slight complication in applying the nrg to the o(3)-am is that the many - body states obtained in the iterative diagonalization can not be classified in terms of quantum numbers associated with the particle number and spin individually .",
    "there is a total spin operator @xmath26 , which is the sum of the spin and isospin , which does commute with the hamiltonian .",
    "it is defined by @xmath27 where the sum runs over the impurity and conduction electron states . for perturbational calculations",
    "it is useful to express the hamiltonian in terms of majorana fermion operators @xcite . in the majorana fermion form",
    "it is clear that the non - fermi liquid situations which develop for @xmath25 are due to the fact that one of the majorana fermions associated with the impurity is unhybridized .",
    "this gives a local zero mode and the scattering with the conduction electrons via the @xmath0 term leads to singularities and the breakdown of fermi liquid theory .",
    "there is no advantage , however , in the numerical renormalization group approach in using the majorana fermion representation so we retain the model in the form eq .",
    "( [ eq : cam ] ) .",
    "we do need , however , to re - express the hamiltonian along standard lines for the numerical renormalization group approach and introduce a discrete basis for the conduction electrons for the iterative sequence of diagonalizations that is used .",
    "in order to apply the nrg method on the o(3)-am eq .",
    "( [ eq : cam ] ) , its hamiltonian has to be cast in a semi - infinite chain form .",
    "this mapping is described in detail in @xcite .",
    "the logarithmic discretization ( with the discretization parameter @xmath28 ) , the definition of the discrete operators @xmath29 and @xmath30 and the transformation of the free conduction electron term are identical to the treatment of the standard single impurity anderson model ( siam ) @xcite .",
    "the @xmath31 fermions again do not couple directly to the impurity and are neglected .",
    "due to the antisymmetry of @xmath6 , there is a minus sign in the definition of the conduction electron operator at the impurity site @xmath32 in contrast to the combination @xmath33 one obtains in the standard case .",
    "the discretized version of @xmath5 then reads @xmath34 the minus sign in ( 8) does not affect the semi - infinite chain form of the conduction electron part @xmath35 with @xmath36    as in the standard case @xcite we diagonalize iteratively a sequence of hamiltonians @xmath37 with @xmath38 , \\ ] ] @xmath39 so that @xmath40    at this point it is convenient to generalize the hamiltonian ( 9 ) by an anomalous hybridization between _ all _ sites of the semi - infinite chain . together with the @xmath2-term we have @xmath41 @xmath42 \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath43 .",
    "the @xmath44 factors are due to the requirement that @xmath45 commutes with @xmath46",
    ". obviously , all @xmath47 are zero for @xmath48 , but the advantage of this generalization is that we can start the iterative procedure by adding site @xmath49 to the impurity . otherwise the two - site problem would have to be the starting point .",
    "both particle number @xmath50 and spin @xmath18 are no more conserved quantities of the hamiltonian ( 9 ) as soon as @xmath51 .",
    "the only conserved quantity is the total ` spin plus isospin ' @xmath52 with @xmath53 and @xmath54 the @xmath55-dependent definition of @xmath56 is necessary to fulfill the condition @xmath57=0 $ ] .",

    "up to iteration number 30 the flow diagrams of fig .  2 and 3 are almost identical but after a crossover regime ( iterations 30 to 50 ) the system approaches the fermi liquid fixed point of the single channel case ( see fig .  1 ) .",

    "we find a wilson ratio which is consistent with the value of 8/3 of the two channel kondo model , within the numerical accuracy .    for @xmath144",
    "the wilson ratio is a nonuniversal function of @xmath2 ( see fig .",
    "due to the vanishing energy scale in this limit the numerical calculation of @xmath139 and @xmath111 gets more and more inaccurate .",
    "however , it is clear that @xmath145 decreases rapidly as @xmath146 ( note that the @xmath147-ratio is discontinuous at this point and for @xmath148 the wilson ratio takes the value @xmath149 ) .",
    "to summarize , we have discussed a numerical renormalization group approach to the o(3)-symmetric anderson model that can be related to the ( @xmath22-@xmath23)-model introduced by coleman et al.@xcite via a schrieffer - wolff transformation . both spin and charge",
    "are not conserved in the o(3)-symmetric model so we have to use the only conserved quantity ` spin plus isospin ' to classify the eigenstates in the iterative diagonalization procedure .",
    "the flow diagrams show a non - fermi liquid fixed point for @xmath87 ( corresponding to @xmath150 in the ( @xmath22-@xmath23)-model ) which is unstable for any small deviations from the isotropic case .",
    "all static properties calculated for @xmath87 show the non - fermi liquid behaviour of the two channel kondo model :    * a zero point entropy of @xmath151 , * a logarithmic temperature dependence of the specific heat @xmath152 , * a logarithmic temperature dependence of the ` spin plus isospin ' susceptibility @xmath153 , * a wilson ratio of @xmath154 independent of @xmath0 .",
    "the relation of these results to those of the conformal field theory and perturbation theory and the interpretation of the non - fermi liquid fixed point in terms of majorana fermions will be dealt with in a separate publication .",
    "for @xmath112 the model shows the conventional fermi liquid behaviour similar to the standard siam .",

    "this energy scale should correspond to @xmath156 , the anisotropic energy scale in @xcite , but there @xmath157 .",
    "the difference is probably due to the different cut - off scheme used ( giving a different prefactor to the exponential ) .",
