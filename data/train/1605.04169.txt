    "this gold nanoantenna has a base diameter diameter of 300  nm , a full cone angle of 6.65@xmath17 , and a curvature radius of 5  nm .",
    "such an acute structure can be fabricated by electron - beam induced deposition and has been utilized to achieve sub-10 nm resolution in the optical regime @xcite . due to the dimensions of our grating , it is not possible to corrugate the nanoantenna as well , so the grating does not stretch all the surface up to the apex .    to determine how these three different structures perform in terms of confinement , we conducted fem electromagnetic simulations where all tips were illuminated from the base by a p - polarized plane - wave with a frequency of 1660  @xmath15 , first at angle of incidence of 0@xmath18 ( fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] , top row ) and then at 75@xmath18 ( fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] , bottom row ) with respect to the tip axis , where the latter configuration has been used in all our previous experimental work @xcite as well by others @xcite .",
    "the field energy density distribution is normalized by the field energy density of the incident light . at first glance , there is no field enhancement at 0@xmath18 incidence , even though we see for the corrugated structures excitation of spoof spps that are strongly confined to the grating .",
    "by contrast , we observe a field confinement at the tip apex for an angle of incidence of 75@xmath18 , which increases as we switch from the uncorrugated tip to the corrugated tip and then to the corrugated supertip .",
    "impinging from the bottom at an angle of 0@xmath18 ( top row ) and 75@xmath18 ( bottom row ) relative to tip axis . ]",
    "before we eloborate on the angular dependence of the field enhancement , we first quantify the field confinement as an assessment for the achievable optical lateral resolution . as a measure we take the lateral field extent around the tip measured as the radial distance at which the field energy @xmath19 starts to follow a different power law visible as kinks in fig .",
    "[ fig:6]a ) . expecting the field extent to be comparable to the tip diameter we find the corrugated supertip to exhibit a sharp field distribution with a width of about 10 nm and a field enhancement of up to 3 orders magnitude larger compared to the ordinary tip , which provides a relatively poor lateral resolution of about 80 nm in agreement with the experimental findings mentioned earlier .",
    "its corrugated counterpart provides the same lateral resolution , but about a factor of 2.5 better field enhancement thanks to the grating - induced spps .",
    "now , regarding the angular dependence of the field enhancement as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig:6]b ) , the curve belonging to the uncorrugated gold tip features a multiple peaked , sloping distribution with the maximum at 30@xmath17 similar to the study in refs .  @xcite . in agreement with antenna theory  @xcite",
    ", the peaks of the multiple lobe radiation pattern of a long wire of length @xmath20 appear at angles of @xmath21 $ ] ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "thus , the major radiation lobe ( @xmath23 ) for a 25 @xmath3 m long wire at an illumination wavelength of @xmath24 @xmath3 m ( i.e. @xmath25 @xmath15 ) is expected to appear at 28@xmath17 .    up to the angle of grazing incidence ( i.e. 20@xmath17 ) , the corrugated tip displays a similar angle dependence for the fields enhancement with the first peak around 15@xmath17 , but unlike the uncorrugated tip we notice at grazing incidence a rise of a shoulder rather than a local minimum .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that at grazing incidence the incoming p - polarized light has no field component along the surface , only along the surface normal .",
    "thus , there is no field component to feed the antenna but only a component to excite the spp . beyond grazing incidence",
    "the long - wire field pattern is overshadowed by a broad angular distribution with no distinct features reflecting the almost omnidirectional excitation of spoof spps on the grating reaching a poorly pronounced / weak maximum at about 85@xmath17 , i.e. almost perpendicular to the wire axis .     of its value at the tip center (",
    "see dashed vertical lines ) .",
    "b ) field energy measured around the tip apex ( @xmath26 nm ) of all three tip configurations as function of the angle of incidence .",
    "the dashed vertical line indicates the angle of incidence usually used in our experimental setup . ]    in contrast , the field enhancement around the tip apex of the corrugated supertip becomes more distinctive with peaks at an angle of incidence of 65@xmath17 and 130@xmath17 and a local minimum inbetween around 100@xmath17 .",
    "this is a result of the synergy of the antenna excitation and spp excitation arising form the juxtaposition of an antenna and a grating in this single structure . from a geometrical analysis of the field components",
    ", we would expect the field enhancement around the apex of the corrugated supertip to peak at 65@xmath17 and 155@xmath17 with a local minimum in between at 110@xmath17 : starting at grazing incidence where the electric field is entirely perpendicular to the surface , the ratio of the field components @xmath27 shifts in favour of @xmath28 with increasing angle . at an angle of incidence of @xmath29 ( i.e. 45 @xmath18 relative to the tip surface ) both field components , @xmath28 and @xmath30 ,",
    "are even and thus both effects ( antenna excitation and spp excitation ) should coherently contribute to the field confinement at the tip apex . beyond that angle , the ratio shifts even further in favour of @xmath28 until the electric field vector is entirely parallel to the surface at 110@xmath18 allowing only the antenna effect to contribute .",
    "as the angle increases further , the ratio now starts to shift in favour of @xmath30 and at 155@xmath18 both field compenents are even again , thus maximizing again the cooperation of antenna and spp excitation .",
    "however , our geometrical analysis does not entirely reproduce the observed angle distribution , particularly at obtuse angles , i.e. @xmath31 . there",
    ", the characteristics of the antenna with its sloping distribution become more prominent making the peak at 155@xmath18 not only to appear at about 15@xmath18 smaller angle , but also to have a smaller height compared with the peak at 65@xmath18 .",
    "all in all , the angular distribution for the field enhancement of the corrugated supertip is a trade - off between the sharp dominant resonances of the long - wire antenna at acute and obtuse angles and the rather broad `` resonance '' of the grating at intermediate angles , reflecting the structural hybridisation of the antenna and the grating .",
    "by means of mode matching , we designed an experimentally feasible surface grating that excites spoof spps in the chemical fingerprint region between 5.7 and 6 @xmath3 m ( i.e. between 1660 and 1755 @xmath15 ) .",
    "we grafted this grating onto the surface of a tapered metal waveguide structure to which we appended a nanoscale antenna with a 5 nm tip radius .",
    "fem electromagnetic simulations revealed extraordinary field enhancement of 2 - 3 orders higher compared with conventional ir near - field probes .",
    "this field enhancement is accompanied by field confinement at the tip apex of the order of 10 nm holding the prospect of a fourfold increase in lateral optical resolution in comparison with conventional metal probes utilized in current s - snim apparatus .",
    "a goniometric analysis of the field excitation revealed a broad range of angles under which extraordinary field enhancement can be achieved .",
    "thus , implementation of the nanoprobe presented here into existing near - field ir microscopy apparatus should be possible with minor or no modifications .",
    "with such a plasmon - assisted mid - ir nanoscopy probe available the label - free imaging of single protein or lipid molecules within biological tissue is possible .",
    "adapting the grating to the appropiate wavelength , such a probe can be also deployed to detect small fluctuations in the free carrier concentration of highly doped seminconductor nanostructures .",
