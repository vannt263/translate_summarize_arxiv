    "the entropy is a concept which has taken on many meanings throughout the sciences .",
    "its usual sense relates the heat changes to the likelihood of the related processes at various determined temperatures . in the limit of low temperatures",
    "planck  @xcite noted that a mixture of different substances retained a finite entropy even at absolute zero .",
    "this result is quite contrary to the usual interpretation of the nernst heat theorem , for which the entropy should vanish in the low temperature limit .",
    "it was schrdinger  @xcite who pointed out a similar observation for @xmath2 atoms each with a two level ground state resulting in @xmath3 states . in this case",
    "there should be an entropy of @xmath4 with boltzmann s constant @xmath5 taken to be unity .",
    "these results are consistent with the quantum statistical definition  @xcite of the entropy @xmath6 using the density matrix @xmath7 which relates directly to the wavefunction .",
    "this entropy is given by the trace over the quantum states as follows : @xmath8 \\label{eq:0}.\\ ] ] schrdinger s result  @xcite can be readily attained for a system of @xmath2 spin one half states .",
    "although the name `` quantum entropy '' implies the construction of the density matrix @xmath7 from the quantum states , the actual mathematical form is well rooted in the laws of classical physics  @xcite .",
    "the entropy of mixing of different types of ideal gases can be calculated in the same way as eq .",
    "( 1 ) by replacing @xmath7 with @xmath9 , which is just the proportion of each constituent type @xmath10 in the total gas system .",
    "thus the entropy of mixing becomes @xmath11 , where the sum has replaced the trace operation .",
    "this expression is clearly a constant independent of the temperature so that it must remain at absolute zero  @xcite .    in recent work",
    "we have applied these ideas to the quark singlet ground state of the hadrons  @xcite . the color symmetry @xmath12 provides a quantum entropy for each of the colored quarks with the value @xmath13 .",
    "the ground state entropy reflects the mixing probabilities inside the hadrons at vanishing temperature .",
    "we have extended this result to models at finite temperatures  @xcite . in this work",
    "we investigate the contribution of this entropy to the equation of state for the quarks inside the hadrons using the phenomenological bag model for strong interactions  @xcite .",
    "we assume that inside the hadron bag all of the strong interactions at low temperature @xmath14 and small quark chemical potential @xmath15 are included in the quark and gluon condensates .",
    "in particular , we will look at a special model for baryons at low temperatures and small chemical potentials , for which the effective degrees of freedom are the quark and gluon colors .",
    "all other couplings are taken so that the spin and flavor are not explicitly considered .    in the limit of low temperatures",
    "the interactions in the ground state are expressed in terms of the vacuum expectation values of the quark and the gluon fields .",
    "the calculation of these vacuum contributions are gotten from the operator product expansion using the qcd sum rules  @xcite , which has the local operators of dimension four yielding the main contributions to the thermodynamics  @xcite .",
    "the pure gluon vacuum expectation value is calculated  @xcite from the product of the field strength tensors including the renormalization group beta function , where the repeated indices are summed over their range of values . from hereon",
    "we shall simply write it as @xmath16 , which is often called the vacuum gluon condensate .",
    "this vacuum gluon condensate can be extracted  @xcite from the charmonium spectrum to yield a consistently estimated  @xcite value of about @xmath17gev/@xmath18 . for the quark condensates",
    "we consider two extreme cases - the light quarks and the pure strange quarks , , vacuum expectation values .",
    "we use the accepted value of the pion decay constant @xmath19 as @xmath20mev  @xcite with the respective average light quark mass @xmath21 of @xmath22mev and strange quark mass @xmath23 of @xmath24mev . with these values together with the values of the average pion @xmath25mev and kaon @xmath26mev masses  @xcite we find the light and strange quark condensates respectively to be @xmath27mev/@xmath18 and @xmath28mev/@xmath18 .",
    "the averaged vacuum contribution to the fields of dimension four in the equation of state can be calculated from the operator product expansion  @xcite using .",
    "thus we find the estimated vacuum contributions to these two extreme cases to be @xmath29gev/@xmath18 for the light quarks and @xmath30gev/@xmath18 for the strange quarks .",
    "furthermore , we remark here that both the gluon and quark condensates have the same color singlet ground state @xmath31 often associated with the scalar glueball state  @xcite .    for the present work we have chosen these extreme cases for special states of baryonic structure . if we look at the spin @xmath32 structure of @xmath0 and @xmath1 as examples of these ground state structures , we get a minimal effect from the spin entanglement and flavor mixing .",
    "nevertheless , we include the degeneracy factor due to the quark spins for the integration over the momenta .",
    "the usual sum over the flavors is replaced by a factor of three in the baryons .",
    "we keep the degeneracy factor due to the gluon spins since both polarizations are possible . in the following work",
    "we shall use the trace anomaly for the substitution of the above extracted values for the vacuum condensates into the equation of state .",
    "it is known  @xcite that the temperature has very little effect on these values at temperatures well below @xmath33mev .",
    "thus we can look at the quantum effects of the entropy on the bag constant @xmath34 for low temperatures @xmath14 and small chemical potentials @xmath15 .",
    "here we do not look at the explicit dependence of the bag constant on @xmath15 at zero temperature .",
    "at finite temperatures and quark chemical potentials we choose the grand canonical partition function @xmath35 in order to write down the equation of state in terms of difference between the energy density and the pressure .",
    "this expression may be represented in terms of the trace of the energy - momentum tensor averaged over these variables , where the repeated indices represent the sum over the lorentz indices . in the formulation of the bag model  @xcite the thermodynamics",
    "is usually included with a bag energy density and a bag pressure , which generally represents the energy density and the confining pressure of the bag against the vacuum .",
    "hereupon , we may describe the expectation values for the gluon and quark condensates from the equation of state as a limiting value which exists in the sense .",
    "after applying the first law of thermodynamics relating the internal energy density to the entropy density , the pressure and the chemical potential we find the equation of state using the proton volume @xmath36 from the charge radius  @xcite with the value @xmath37@xmath18 .",

    "here we have used the vacuum expectation value @xmath29gev/@xmath18 for the light quarks .",
    "we notice - at least for the region of @xmath14 and @xmath15 which we are considering in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] up to @xmath50mev - that @xmath49 almost stays constant at the very low temperatures .",
    "afterwards it only slightly increases with @xmath14 .",
    "however , the dependence on @xmath15 is in comparison quite weak .",
    "for relatively large @xmath15 and very small temperature @xmath49 remains constant . for increasing values of @xmath15 the size of @xmath49 decreases .",
    "for larger @xmath14 the decrease due to @xmath15 will be moderated .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:1](b ) we show the corresponding results for he baryonic state @xmath51 without the quantum entropy . here",
    "we have used the vacuum expectation value @xmath30gev/@xmath18 for the strange quarks . in this case",
    "we note the range of both @xmath14 and @xmath15 in which @xmath49 remains constant is much wider than in the case of @xmath0 .",
    "this fact is due to the strange quark mass , which is very much heavier than the masses of light quarks . beyond this range it decreases only marginally .",
    "thereafter it starts to increase in a region not shown here . for larger @xmath14 and @xmath15",
    "we could expect that @xmath49 in the @xmath51 bag should increase in a way similar to the @xmath0 bag .",
    "thus we may conclude that @xmath49 is almost constant , especially at very low temperatures and very small quark chemical potentials , when we do not consider the quantum entropy in the equation of state .",
    "similarly we note that the dependence on @xmath15 is small but not fully negligible even though at higher values of @xmath14 it seems not depending on @xmath15 . in the high temperature region we expect that the values of do not vanish for which the gluonic radiation contributions become very dominant .",
    "thus at vanishing temperatures approaches @xmath47 .",
    "we may consider the region of small @xmath14 and @xmath15 in which the bag constant remains relatively unchanged , which for the strange quarks is much wider .",
    "the inclusion of the quantum entropy density leads to quite different qualitative effects which may be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] . here",
    "we note an almost linear decrease of @xmath49 with increasing @xmath14 .",
    "the dependence on both @xmath14 and @xmath15 is in @xmath51 bags stronger than that in @xmath0 bags .",
    "we should emphasize that the changes in @xmath49 from @xmath15 is a gradually varying one with a decrease in the slope .",
    "this is quite different from @xmath14 dependence , for which @xmath49 is almost linearly decreasing function .",
    "one reason for the rather weak dependence on @xmath15 is that the quantum entropy term , @xmath52 , which is not included in the grand canonical partition function , has only been given a dependence on @xmath14 .",
    "we may expect that this behavior will be valid for a much wider range of temperature , perhaps even up to @xmath53 .",
    "finally we are able to determine that the presence of the quantum entropy arising from the @xmath12 color symmetry in the equation of state provides a strong temperature dependence for the bag constant @xmath34 . however , the equation of state yields a much weaker dependence of @xmath34 on the quark chemical potential @xmath15 , from which @xmath34 is changed very slowly at low temperatures .",
    "the inclusion of the quantum entropy term in the equation of state for the two considered baryonic structures leads to an acceleration of the decrease in @xmath34 with increasing temperatures has an approximately linear decline .",
    "we have contrasted these results in both these cases to the same properties without the quantum entropy .    based on these results",
    "we shall plan further studies into the behavior of the structure of confined quark matter at low temperatures and small quark chemical potentials .",
    "a further consideration of the idea that glueballs could appear as @xmath31 state in a bose - einstein condensate  @xcite seems to be a quite promising further point .",
    "the importance of the glueball degrees of freedom for describing the hadronic phase for temperature below @xmath53 has already been investigated  @xcite .",
    "also the existence of spin - color waves in the bag we would like to study further .",
