    "in hadron physics the existence of the three body resonances is drawing much attention for a long time .",
    "the proper analysis of the three hadron system can be tackled by combining the faddeev equations @xcite and chiral dynamics @xcite .",
    "however it is quite difficult to solve exactly the faddeev equations .",
    "recently , the combination of faddeev equations and chiral dynamics was used to investigate for two meson - one baryon systems @xcite and also for three mesons systems @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the fixed center approximation ( fca ) to the faddeev equations is technically very simple and a powerful method to explore three hadron systems .",
    "this method is especially suitable to study the system in which two of the three particles are bound forming a cluster and this cluster is not much altered by the collision of the third particle @xcite .",
    "this method has proved to be rather reliable for cases like @xmath8-deuteron scattering very close to threshold @xcite . in recent years",
    "the fca to faddeev equations has been successfully applied to the study of many three body interactions .",
    "for example in the work of the ref .",
    "@xcite the @xmath9 was analyzed by means of the fca to the faddeev equations in which the authors give a reasonable explanation for the @xmath10 puzzle .",
    "likewise , the @xmath11 system was investigated using the faddeev equations under the fca in ref . @xcite and the results are in good agreement with the variational estimation @xcite and also the full faddeev calculation @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we want to study the @xmath12 system .",
    "the reason is that the vector - vector interaction is found to be very strong , particularly in the @xmath13 channel @xcite . due to this , it was possible to see that multi-@xmath0 states with the spins parallel were bound , although the width was increasing with the number of @xmath0 s @xcite .",
    "the masses and widths obtained were in good agreement with experimental data .",
    "the same occurred with @xmath14 multi-@xmath0 states in @xcite and with @xmath15 multi-@xmath0 states in @xcite . in the case of @xmath14 multi-@xmath0",
    "states one finds good agreement with experiment , but in the case of @xmath15 multi-@xmath0 states only predictions were made and experimental counterparts have not yet been observed .",
    "the @xmath12 system is new and has not been studied so far .",
    "yet , studies done for @xmath16 interaction in @xcite and @xmath17 interaction in @xcite have already set the grounds to tackle this interesting system with hidden charm , and we wish to study it here .",
    "in this section we describe the calculation of the three body interaction of the @xmath12 system in s - wave and all the spins aligned . in the work of @xcite ,",
    "the @xmath18 interaction was studied using the hidden gauge formalism @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the authors found strong attraction in @xmath19 , @xmath13 which corresponds to the tensor state @xmath20 with @xmath21 .",
    "similarly , it was also found in ref .",
    "@xcite that the resonance @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) could be understood as a molecule made of @xmath24 and @xmath25 mesons with strong attraction in the @xmath4 , @xmath13 sector .",
    "we use the fca to the faddeev equations to study the @xmath26 system .",
    "this method is particularly well suited for the system in which a pair of particles clusters together and the cluster is not much modified by the third particle , like in the case of @xmath20 as a @xmath18 cluster and @xmath22 as a @xmath27 cluster .    for the technical details",
    "we proceed similarly to ref .",
    "@xcite to express the fca to the faddeev equations .",
    "hereinafter we are going to interpret the interaction of a particle @xmath28 with a cluster made of two particles , @xmath29 and @xmath30 . in this work",
    "the particle @xmath28 will represent the @xmath0(@xmath31 ) which scatters from the cluster , @xmath22 ( @xmath20 ) and @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the @xmath1(@xmath0 ) and @xmath31(@xmath1 ) which build up the cluster .    the diagramatic representation of the fca to the faddeev equations is shown in fig .",

    "[ fig : faddeq ] the thick squared dots represent the unitary scattering amplitudes with coupled channel for the interaction of particle @xmath28 with particle @xmath29 ( @xmath32 ) and @xmath30 ( @xmath33 ) , respectively , which will be discussed later . in order to write the equations for the total three body scattering amplitude",
    ", we define two partition functions @xmath34 , @xmath35 which sum all diagrams of the series of fig .",
    "[ fig : faddeq ] which begin with the interaction of particle @xmath28 with particle @xmath29 of the cluster ( @xmath34 ) , or with particle @xmath30 ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "then the fca equations can be written as a system of coupled equations :    @xmath36    where @xmath37 is the green function for the propagator of particle @xmath28 between the particles @xmath29 and @xmath30 which is discussed later on .",
    "the scattering amplitude @xmath38 for the single scattering contribution is obtained in terms of the two - body amplitudes @xmath39 , @xmath40 derived in refs .",

    "in the case of the total isospin @xmath4 case we similarly derive    @xmath57    since we use the normalization of mandl and shaw @xcite , which has different weight factors for the particle fields , we need to consider how these factors are adapted to the present problem .",
    "it is easy to do this compairing the single scattering , double scattering and full scattering amplitudes . in this case , following the field normalization of ref .",
    "@xcite , we can obtain the s matrix for the single scattering diagram ( fig . [",

    "the two - body @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath110 systems were investigated by the coupled channel bethe - salpeter equations in refs .",
    "as we stated before , the resonance @xmath20 was generated as a @xmath102 quasibound state or molecule in the isospin @xmath149 and spin-2 .",
    "it was also found that the resonance @xmath22 is dynamically generated in @xmath4 and spin-2 from @xmath110 scattering",
    ". therefore , there are two possible cases of three - body scattering of the @xmath148 system .",
    "one is the @xmath150 and the other one is the @xmath151 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : d2strdstar ] we illustrate the modulus squared @xmath152 for the @xmath153 scattering as a function of the total energy of the @xmath154 system for the case of @xmath5 and @xmath155 .",

    "the width of the peak is about @xmath158 mev .",
    "this looks like a strong binding , but we must keep in mind that the vector - vector interaction in @xmath13 is indeed very strong @xcite .",
    "this is why we are studying these superbound states with spins aligned where the spin of any pair is always @xmath13 .",
    "the obvious thing is that the @xmath110 state is already bound and since the @xmath106 also binds to give the @xmath20 , the system @xmath148 with this configuration will necessarily be bound",
    ". this would be the case even if the @xmath0 interacted only with one @xmath15 . in this case",
    "we would have a binding of @xmath159 mev .",
    "the binding that we get is @xmath157 mev , which means that we have gained extra @xmath160 mev binding by the interaction of the @xmath0 with the @xmath161 .",
    "this indicates that there is extra binding from the three body molecular structure .",
    "this feature is reminiscent of what happens in quantum mechanics for the problem of a particle in a well of two attractive @xmath162-functions @xcite . for the symmetric solutions ,",
    "if the two @xmath162 s are separated , the binding energy of the two @xmath162 potential is the binding of a particle in one @xmath162 well .",
    "as the two @xmath162 potentials get closer , the particle starts orbiting the two potential wells and the binding energy grows .",
    "this is what we observe here , indicating an extra binding from the orbiting of the @xmath0 around the @xmath15 and @xmath161 .    in figs .",
    "[ fig : ampd2sdbsi0 ] and [ fig : ampd2sdbsi1 ] we show the results of @xmath152 for the case of @xmath163 in total isospin @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "we find a peak around @xmath164 mev which is about @xmath165 mev below the @xmath20 and @xmath161 threshold for the isospin @xmath4 case .",
    "the width of this state is quite large about @xmath166 mev .",
    "if we conduct the same exercise as before , the @xmath15 with a @xmath0 would be bound by @xmath167 mev , and the @xmath15 with the @xmath161 by about @xmath168 mev .",
    "we would think that the @xmath15 is orbiting the @xmath0 where it is more bound and get some extra binding from orbiting the @xmath15 .",
    "it is not clear why one passes to @xmath165 mev binding .",
    "it is also unclear why the width is much larger .",
    "probably we have to accept that in this case , since the @xmath15 is heavier than the @xmath0 , there are limitations to the applications of the fca , and we should accept this result as an indication that we could now have a state more bound than in the former case , which fulfills all the conditions for a reliable application of the fca and hence is more reliable , but we can not be certain about the mass and the width .    for the isospin @xmath5 case , we see a clear peak around @xmath169 mev , and the width is around @xmath170 mev .",
    "the position of the peak is about @xmath171 mev below the @xmath20 and @xmath161 threshold .",
    "these results are more intuitive than before .",
    "we can apply the same argumentation as before , but now according to eqs .",
    "( [ eq : spin1 ] ) and ( [ eq : spin2 ] ) , we can see that the weight of the @xmath172 amplitude in @xmath173 for @xmath4 is unity while for @xmath5 it is @xmath174 , and this is the amplitude that contains the attractions that binds the @xmath20 . with the caveat about the arguments used before for the case of @xmath4 ,",
    "it looks clear that the binding should be smaller than for the case of @xmath4 and the width is also similar to that of the @xmath175 molecule .",
    "[ fig : ampd2sdbsi0 ]",
    "we studied the interaction of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 , @xmath2 with spins aligned using the fixed center approximation to the faddeev equations .",
    "this guarantees that we have @xmath13 for any of the pairs , where the vector - vector interaction is strongest , and leads to three body states with @xmath155 .",
    "we first select a cluster of @xmath3 , which is found to be bound in @xmath4 and can be associated to the x(3915 ) , and then let the @xmath0 meson orbit around the @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "in this case the fca produces an amplitude for @xmath0-@xmath3 scattering which has a clear and narrow peak around 4340 mev .",
    "the case of a @xmath2 orbiting around a cluster of @xmath6 is more uncertain because the mass of the external particle is heavier than the one of the @xmath0 in the cluster , and the fca is less reliable . in this case",
    "the cluster makes the @xmath7 state , and we point at some qualitative results , with an @xmath4 state around 4000 mev and an @xmath5 state around 4200 mev .",
    "the results obtained for the @xmath5 state with the @xmath0 orbiting around the x(3915 ) should be realistic since the @xmath0 is lighter than the constituents of the cluster . in the other case our results",
    "should be taken as indicative , but strong arguments are given that these states should be strongly bound .",
    "the results obtained here should serve to stimulate calculations with more accurate three body tools , as those of @xcite which could make predictions on these interesting @xmath155 states .",
    "one should recall at this point that states with increasing spin number already exist in the light sector @xcite and in the strange sector @xcite .",
    "what we have done here it to extend this to the hidden charm sector .",
    "parallelly , it would also be interesting to investigate states of large spin in the region of mass investigated here .",
    "the results obtained in this work provide sufficient support for a devoted search of such states .",
