    "the planet clears a gap and thus accretes a larger fraction of material from the edges of its accretion zone .",
    "retrograde spins are considered to originate from giant impacts during the early stages of planet formation .",
    "therefore constraints on the planet spins are of high scientific interest , because deviations of the axes of rotation may have been caused by impacts of large bodies during their early history .",
    "even the axes of rotation of the gaseous planets may have been affected by impacts on their rocky cores before these planets accumulated their large atmospheres of hydrogen and helium .",

    "this factor plays a critical role as it accounts for the strength of the planet signal , which is determined by the planet to star flux contrast .",
    "the contrast decreased from @xmath115 to @xmath116 when increasing the planet orbital periods from @xmath117day to @xmath90day .",
    "we also factor in the sampling rate with the telescope diameter and the brightness of the target host star .",
    "an account for the change of the planet flux during a secondary eclipse is also incorporated by factoring the radial velocity uncertainties by square root of the flux of a secondary eclipse @xcite model with unity out - of eclipse baseline and zero in - eclipse flux .",

    "fig.[fig : simulation_result ] shows the results for a planet with the physical properties of wasp-19b , which is considered to be tidally locked .",
    "we assumed a prograde ( @xmath119 ) and a retrograde ( @xmath120 ) rotation with @xmath121kms@xmath8 .",
    "we perform a _ rmse _ fit to the mock data utilising a levenberg - marquardt least - squares minimization and estimate @xmath50 and @xmath122 , @xcite .",
    "we find the planet signal to be well - detected ( @xmath112-@xmath123 ) when combining nine secondary eclipses .",

    "we find a number of @xmath126 secondary eclipses will have to be added in order to detect the _ rmse _ effect at @xmath127-@xmath123 confidence .",
    "we have discussed the doppler signature of a spinning exoplanet during secondary eclipse and derived a relation for the radial velocity as a function of the planet s rotational rate and axial tilt ( eq.[eq : eq18 ] ) .",
    "the _ rmse _",
    "effect complements the tool - box offered by transiting exoplanets providing a proxy to exoplanet spins .",
    "we showed that the formalism of the _ rmse _ is equivalent to the formalism developed by @xcite to describe the rm effect caused by a planet transiting its star just from a different perspective .",
    "we note that @xcite derived an improved accuracy radial velocity anomaly curves for the rm effect during primary transits .",
    "however , the solution of @xcite provides a conservative estimate of the radial velocity amplitude and is precise enough to illustrate the _ rmse _ effect .",
    "we acknowledge that our assumption of a rigid rotating non - limb darkened planetary surface ( i.e. ignoring differential rotation and atmospheric dynamics ) is a crude approximation , but it illustrates the expected _ rmse _ radial velocity anomaly in the simplest case . the radial velocity originating from the _ rmse _ effect is expected to be degenerate with atmospheric dynamics .",
    "exoplanets are expected to have atmospheric circulation with increasing dynamics at shorter orbital distances @xcite .",
    "therefore it is expected that the radial velocity curves of most close - in exoplanets may significantly differ from that assumed here , with super - rotating winds expected to enhance the radial velocity signals by factor of a few .",
    "the _ rmse _",
    "effect presents the opportunity to probe atmospheric winds with altitude , when wide coverage high dispersion spectroscopy becomes capable of providing per - point precisions in the @xmath128ms@xmath129 domain . in such cases it could be possible to measure longitudinally - integrated radial velocities and",
    "map the surface of a planet during the secondary eclipse ingress / egress phases , providing constraints on the hot - spot position .",
    "we postpone the derivation of the _ rmse _ effect in these cases for future theoretical global circulation model investigations and identify the top three planets expected to exhibit the strongest _ rmse _ effect assuming synchronised rotation . applying eq.[eq : eq18 ] ( assuming @xmath130 ) we find values of @xmath131kms@xmath8 for targets wasp-103b , wasp-12b and",
    "wasp-19b , respectively . @xcite demonstrated the rotational signature of an exoplanet in the planet radial velocity .",
    "the _ rmse _ effect discussed in this study is of similar nature .",
    "however the geometric shadow of the star rather than the changing planet phase is the factor removing velocity components from the visible planet surface . importantly , because the _ rmse _ effect occurs only during ingress and egress , its detection requires significantly less observing time compared to the case in @xcite .",
    "_ rmse _ therefore could be much - well suited for planets with longer orbital periods .",
    "we also demonstrated that to be put into practice the _ rmse _ effect requires exoplanet host stars brighter than the currently known exoplanet hosts , i.e. brighter than @xmath132mag and large aperture telescopes ( ie.@xmath12840 m ) .",
    "the strongest _ rmse _ effect for evolved stars is expected for non - synchronized rotation , i.e. planets on longer than 20 day orbits , with a typical @xmath133kms@xmath8 or more . however , such planets exhibit lower temperatures ( i.e.@xmath134k ) , compared to the typical hot jupiters giving a small planet - to - star flux contrasts ( i.e. @xmath135 or lower at @xmath136 m ) .",
    "the detection of the _ rmse _ effect in such cases would be an extremely challenging if not impossible task , even for the upcoming 40 m class telescopes",
    ".    an interesting case could be young planets which still have not been synchronised .",
    "observations using high - dispersion , near - infrared spectroscopy have currently constrained the rotational rate of the only one such case ( @xmath6picb ) from rotationally broadened absorption lines @xcite .",
    "an important opportunity could exist if the orbit orientation of this planet allows transits and secondary eclipses , because the large brightness of the host star ( i.e. @xmath137mag ) and the fast spin of the planet ( i.e. @xmath138kms@xmath8 ) would produce a strong and detectable _ rmse _ signal .",
    "another interesting opportunity could be offered by transiting brown dwarfs with orbital periods larger than 10 - 20 days .",
    "such systems assume high flux contrasts between the star and the brown dwarf in the near - infrared which in case of a bright host star ( i.e. @xmath139mag ) could provide an opportunity to probe the spins and latitudinal radial velocity maps of these objects .    in the near future ,",
    "the next generation of transit surveys ( ngts ) , the transiting survey satellite ( tess ) and the planetary transits and oscillations of stars ( plato ) projects are expected to significantly expand the sample of known planets hosted by bright stars ( i.e. brighter than @xmath140mag ) and hence to provide more targets suitable for detection of the _ rmse _ effect .    the hypothetical radial velocity data in section[sec : obs_persp ] assumes retrieval of the planet signal via cross - correlation with a model planet spectrum similar to @xcite .",
    "although currently the cross - correlation technique has not been demonstrated to provide per spectrum radial velocity measurements , in their fig.1 , @xcite presented results for the planet geocentric radial velocity as a function of the planet orbital phase at a high significance ( @xmath127-@xmath123 ) .",
    "it is expected that large - aperture near - future telescopes ( i.e.30 - 40 m ) could provide even higher significance signals and planet radial velocity measurements from multiple spectra . in addition , cloud - free exoplanet atmospheres are expected to result in stronger cross - correlation signals compared to hazy or cloudy atmospheres for the same stellar and planetary physical properties .",
    "cloud - free atmospheres are expected to have well - pronounced lines , i.e. non - muted absorption features which are expected for hazy atmospheres .",
    "stellar activity and pulsations are known to produce radial velocity variations that could in some cases mimic those induced by the orbital motion of exoplanets .",
    "this may lead to misinterpretations of radial velocity variations , especially when those variations have periods less or equal to the star rotational periods @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is important to consider whether stellar activity , for instance the distortion to the stellar spectral lines induced by starspots on a rotating stellar surface , could induce residual signal misinterpreted as exoplanet signal .",
    "this is especially pertinent for co - added observations obtained over several nights .    a typical _ rmse _ observation would last for @xmath141h on each of the ingress and egress phases of a wasp-19b - like planet ( see fig.[fig : simulation_result ] ) .",
    "this time interval is significantly shorter than the rotation periods of the typical planet host stars ranging from 10 to 40 days @xcite .",
    "furthermore , starspots are expected to produce sine - wave radial velocity variations ( i.e. different from the _ rmse _ shape ) with amplitudes of a few hundred ms@xmath8 in the optical and are expected to reduce by factor of at least a few at near infrared wavelengths , where the contrast between the photosphere and cool star spots ( e.g. @xmath142k ) is significantly reduced .",
    "thus , if present , residual stellar signal caused by starspots would be a factor of a few tens smaller than the the expected 1 - 2kms@xmath8 amplitude of the _ rmse _ effect for the closest synchronized planets and even more for non - synchronized planets on longer than 20 day period orbits . only in the case of most evolved planets ( i.e. typical hot jupiters ) ,",
    "if synchronized , with orbital / rotational periods from 4 - 5 days to @xmath143 day could a residual introduce larger radial velocity scatter when multiple observations are combined .",
    "however , such planets are expected to have _ rmse _ amplitudes much smaller than 1kms@xmath8 and would be difficult targets by definition .    in",
    "the near infrared the planet spectrum is dominated by thermal radiation and is not expected to contain information from distortions caused by starspots . in case that the planet spectrum also contains a non - negligible component from a reflected star spectrum then the planet spectral lines will have distortions caused by the star spots .",
    "this would make the planet spectrum different and more difficult to cross correlate with model spectra .",
    "however , such an effect is not expected to mimic the _",
    "rmse_.    in conclusion , we have demonstrated the _",
    "effect and its potential to constrain planet rotational rates and sky projected spin - orbital alignments .",
    "we derived the radial velocity curve caused by the rm anomaly and estimated the amplitude of the effect for a hot jupiter .",
