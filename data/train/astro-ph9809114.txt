    "the most luminous known agn with an ionized absorber is the radio - loud lobe - dominated quasar 3c351 ( l@xmath5 erg s@xmath6 , z=0.371 , fiore et al . , 1993 ) .",
    "ionized absorbers are common in low redshift , low luminosity seyfert 1 galaxies ( reynolds , 1997 ) , but rare in higher redshift , higher luminosity quasars .",
    "high luminosity agns are very likely physically larger and so may exhibit slower time variability and have different physical conditions .",
    "3c  351 has a very high uv to x - ray ratio ( @xmath7 , tanambaun et al . , 1989 ) and",
    "its ir to uv spectrum does not show any evidence of reddening , in contrast to several low redshift seyfert 1 galaxies thought to host dusty / warm absorbers .",
    "only two other radio - loud quasars , 3c  212 ( mathur et al . , 1994 ) and 3c  273 ( grandi et al , 1997 ) , have candidate ionized absorbers .",
    "the main absorption feature in the rosat pspc x - ray spectrum of 3c  351 is a deep edge at @xmath1 kev ( quasar frame ) , which is likely to be due to ovii - oviii .",
    "mathur et al . ( 1994 ) built a simple one - zone model of this absorber that also explained the ovi , civ and ly@xmath8 uv absorption lines seen in a nearly simultaneous hst fos spectrum .",
    "such simple models , although elegant , have come under criticism .",
    "ionized absorbers in some seyfert galaxies show different variability behavior in different absorption features , some of which are not as predicted for gas in photoionization equilibrium .",
    "multiple absorbing zones have been introduced to explain these effects ( e.g. reynolds 1997 ) . in another paper ( nicastro et al . , 1998 )",
    "we instead explore additional physics ( non - equilibrium photonionization models and collisional models ) while retaining a single zone of absorbing gas .",
    "3c  351 is a relatively slowly varying source , compared to the rapidly variable seyfert with warm absorbers .",
    "this persistent variability on timescales that span possible ionization and recombination times makes it hard to define an initial equilibrium state . in contrast 3c  351",
    "presents a simplified situation in which to study changes in the ionization state in response to luminosity changes . here",
    "we show that in 3c  351 at least the simplest photoionization equilibrium , single zone model continues to be sufficient .",
    "3c351 was observed twice by rosat , on 1991 october and 1993 august .",
    "the first observation was reported by fiore et al .",
    "the second observation was then proposed in order to search for time variability that could test photoionization models .",
    "fortunately a factor 1.7 decrease in the pspc count rate was seen , providing just such a test . here",
    "we present the second data set and compare the results with predictions .",
    "we considered the two pspc observations of 3c351 taken roughly two years apart , in 1991 october and 1993 august .",
    "table 1 gives , for each observation , the observation date , its duration , the net exposure time , the net source counts , the count rate , and the signal to noise ratio .",
    "the data reduction and the timing analysis were performed using xselect .",
    "we reduced the second pspc observation of 3c351 following the procedures used in fiore et al .",
    "( 1993 ) for the first observation .",
    "for the first observation we used the spectrum and light curve obtained by fiore et al .",
    "the source intensity was consistent with a constant value during both pspc observations , with no more than 20% change in the @xmath9 day and @xmath10 day spans of the two observations .",
    "3c  351 thus appears more stable than the lower luminosity seyferts with ionized absorber ( reynolds , 1997 ) . since 3c  351",
    "has a flat x - ray spectrum and broad optical emission lines it is consistent with the trend exhibited by the three similar but radio - quiet , pg quasars of the fiore et al .",
    "( 1998 ) sample .",
    "those quasars show little or no variability on timescales as short as 10 days ( compared to the narrow line objects of that sample which are rapidly variable and have steep x - ray spectra ) .",
    "however the mean count rate dropped by a factor @xmath11 during the 22 months between the observations ( see table 1 ) , again consistently with the fiore et al .",
    "( 1998 ) discovery .",
    "hereinafter we shall call these the high and low states , respectively .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     @xmath12 in @xmath13 ph s@xmath6 @xmath14 kev@xmath6 ( at 1 kev ) .",
    "= 4.5 in = 3.in    collisional ionization models can fit the data equally well , as they should at low column densities ( nicastro et al . ,",
    "1997 ) . to do",
    "so however they require arbitrary changes , by a factor 1.5 in temperature or a factor 2 in n@xmath15 .",
    "instead photoionization equilibrium models predict the observed correlation with the ionizing continuum . to the authors",
    "this is a strong argument in favor of a photoionization model .",
    "the behavior of the main physical properties of the absorber can be seen in a color - color diagram . in fig .",
    "3 we plot the hardness ratios hr = h / m against the softness ratio sr = s / m from the count rates in three bands ( s=0.15 - 0.58  kev , m=0.88 - 1.47  kev , and h=1.69 - 3.40  kev , at z=0.371 ) for theoretical curves ( for log(@xmath16)=21 , 21.5 , 22 and 22.14 ) obtained by folding the equilibrium photoionization models ( for log(u ) in the range -0.3 - 1.5 , and galactic @xmath16 ) with the response matrix of the pspc .",
    "= 4.0 in = 4.0 in    the position of a point in this diagram readily gives the dominant ion in the gas .",
    "the rapid change of sr as u increase from 0.5 to 5.5 ( on the curve corresponding to log(@xmath16)=22.14 ) corresponds to large increases of the transparency of the gas at e@xmath17 kev as h and he becomes rapidly fully ionized .",
    "as u further increases from 5.5 to 16.5 the sr color changes more slowly , and inverts its trend at u@xmath18 , with hr now changing more rapidly than sr .",
    "the inversion point indicates the switch from an ionization state dominated by ovii to that dominated by oix . in the last part of the curve as u increases , sr and hr decrease until all the ions in the gas are fully stripped and the gas is completely transparent to radiation of any energy .",
    "the two data points show the two 3c  351 observations .",
    "the best fit u in the high observation is marked on the log(@xmath16)=22.14 curve along with the value obtained by scaling by the intensity ratio between the two observations ( a factor 1.7 ) .",
    "the two points are consistent with the position of the observed colors of 3c351 in the two observations , so the predictions of the simple equilibrium photoionization model is consistent with the data .",
    "the as predicted change of the ionization parameter in the 3c  351 absorber to a change in the ionizing continuum is strong evidence that photoionization is the dominant ionization mechanism .",
    "we also see that the absorber comes to ionization equilibrium within 22 months , and can use this to constrain the physical properties of the absorber .    the time @xmath19 measures the time the gas needs to reach equilibrium with the instantaneous ionizing flux ( nicastro et al , 1997 ) .",
    "this time depends on the particular ionic species considered .",
    "the ionic abundances of oxygen in the absorber in 3c  351 are distributed mainly between only two ionic species : ovii and oviii . in this simple case",
    "a useful analytical approximation for @xmath19 is :    @xmath20_{t+\\delta t}}}\\nonumber \\normalsize\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where _ eq _ indicates the equilibrium quantities .    by requiring",
    "that @xmath19 for ovii and oviii species is shorter than the @xmath21 s ( quasar frame ) elapsed between the two observations , we can find a lower limit to the electron density of the absorber : @xmath22 @xmath3 .",
    "since we know the values of u and @xmath23 , this density limit translates into a limit on the distance of the ionized gas from the central source , r@xmath24 pc .",
    "these limits are consistent with the upper limit of @xmath25 @xmath3 , and r@xmath26 pc , found by mathur et al .",
    "( 1994 ) using a lower limit for the distance of the cloud from the central source , based on the absorber being outside the broad emission line region .",
    "the relative closeness of these two limits ( factor @xmath0100 ) implies that a variation in shorter times ( @xmath27 month ) , would be likely to show non - equilibrium effects ( nicastro et al , 1997 ) .",
    "if a factor 2 flux change in @xmath28 week showed no such effects the simplest photoionization model would have to be abandoned .",
    "we have tested ionization models for the ionized absorber in 3c  351 .",
    "in particular , we tested a simple one zone photoionization equilibrium model on two pspc spectra of 3c  351 that show a factor @xmath29 decrease in flux .",
    "the model correctly predicts the sense and amplitude of the observed change in the ionization state of the absorber , correlated with the ionizing continuum flux .",
    "given that photoionization equilibrium applies we can derive a lower limit to the electron density of the absorber : @xmath30 @xmath3 .",
    "this is consistent with the upper limit of @xmath31 @xmath3 found by mathur et al .",
    "the distance of the ionized gas from the central source is then 0.3 pc @xmath4 r @xmath4 50 pc .",
    "the closeness of these two limits creates a strong test of photoionization models : factor 2 variations in 3c  351 on timescales of order a week _ must _ show non - equilibrium effects ."
