    "the splendid success of the standard @xmath5cdm ( @xmath5-cold dark matter ) cosmology that has been witnessed for the past two decades seems to be overshadowed by the recent discoveries of several possible anomalies ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) .",
    "the so - called  bullet cluster \" ( 1e0657 - 56 ) is one of those observational challenges that the standard @xmath5cdm cosmology has to face @xcite .",
    "when @xcite first observed it while looking for a failed cluster , it appeared as a large cloud of hot gas .",
    "later , the _ chandra _ observation revealed that it is in fact a very rare system composed of two head - on colliding massive clusters at @xmath11 in which a bullet - like subcluster is in the middle of escaping its main cluster s potential well at a bow - shock speed of @xmath12 km / s after the first core passage @xcite .    according to the results of @xcite  based on high - resolution hydrodynamical simulations ",
    "the pairwise infall velocity @xmath0 of a  bullet \" satellite onto the main cluster at a separation of @xmath3 ( where @xmath4 is the virial radius of the main halo ) has to exceed @xmath1 km / s , or possibly at least @xmath2 km / s , in order to reproduce the peculiar morphological properties of the bullet cluster , such as the mass ratio between the two colliding clusters , the large separation between the gas and cdm distributions , and the high shock speed inferred from x - ray temperature measurements ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the light of this result",
    ", @xcite investigated how probable it is for a  bullet - like \" system to have an infall velocity as high as @xmath1 km / s , using the cluster catalogs from the large - volume mice simulations @xcite .",
    "they found that the probability of finding a bullet - like system with @xmath7 km / s in a wmap7 universe @xcite is between @xmath13 and @xmath14 , which led them to conclude that the existence of the bullet cluster is incompatible with the @xmath5cdm cosmology .",
    "very recently , @xcite and @xcite have confirmed the results of @xcite and of @xcite using the data from different n - body and hydrodynamical simulations , respectively .    both of a conservative and a radical approach to the bullet cluster problem have been recently proposed .",
    "the conservative one sought for a lower infall velocity solution in a @xmath5cdm cosmology under the suspicion that the results from the hydrodynamical simulations or the high shock velocity inferred from the x - ray temperatures may not be trustworthy ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "in contrast , the radical approach attempted to figure out a mechanism capable of enhancing the infall velocities of the bullet - like systems in non - standard cosmologies .",
    "for example , @xcite claimed that in models with cascading gravity the probability of a bullet - like system with @xmath7 km is four orders of magnitude higher than in the @xmath5cdm model ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "yet , their result was based on a pure analytical speculation without any numerical backup .",
    "taking the radical direction , we examine here the possibility that the morphological properties and the required high infall velocity of the bullet cluster can be attributed to the presence of coupled dark energy ( cde ) . in cde models ,",
    "the dark energy is a scalar field @xmath15 with potential @xmath16 , which interacts with the cdm particles obeying the following two equations @xcite : @xmath17 where an overdot represents a derivative with respect to the cosmic time @xmath18 , @xmath19 is the hubble function , @xmath20 is the reduced planck mass , and @xmath21 is the cdm density .",
    "the interaction between the de scalar field @xmath15 and the cdm fluid determines an exchange of energy - momentum , and a consequent time variation of the cdm particle mass @xmath22 . in equations",
    "( [ eqn : cde ] ) the strength of the coupling is fully determined by the coupling function @xmath23 , defined as @xmath24 .",
    "an enhancement of the infall velocity of the bullet cluster is naturally expected in cde models since a long - range fifth - force generated by the coupling between @xmath15 and cdm particles has been found to play the role of accelerating structure formation processes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the level of the enhancement of the infall velocity of the bullet cluster will however significantly depend on the shape of the scalar self - interaction potential @xmath16 as well as the coupling function @xmath23 .",
    "we refer to the wide literature on the subject ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) for a more thorough description of the main basic features of cde cosmologies . in particular , the specific models discussed in the present paper have been fully defined and presented by @xcite and @xcite .    the goal of this paper is to study comprehensively the effect of cde models on the infall velocities of the bullet - like systems analyzing the public cluster catalogs of the codecs project @xcite  the largest suite of cosmological n - body simulations for cde models to date  which includes various choices for the scalar self interaction potential @xmath16 and the coupling function @xmath23 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in  2 , we provide a brief overview of the n - body simulations for the cde models and describe how to select the bullet - like systems from the halo catalogs . in  3 , we determine the probability density distribution of the bullet - like systems and calculate the probability of finding a bullet cluster with infall velocity larger than @xmath1 km / s ( and @xmath2 km / s as well ) for each cde model . in  4 , we provide the physical interpretation of our results and discuss its cosmological implications .",
    "the codecs ( coupled dark energy cosmological simulations ) project is the largest suite of n - body simulations for cde models ever performed , and all its numerical outputs , including halo and sub - halo catalogs , have been recently made publicly available @xcite . using the specific modified version by @xcite of the widely used parallel tree - pm n - body code gadget @xcite ,",
    "the different runs of the l - codecs suite follow the evolution of @xmath25 cdm and @xmath25 baryonic particles in a periodic cosmological box of linear comoving size @xmath26gpc from @xmath27 to @xmath28 for different realizations of the cde scenario .",
    "the individual cdm and baryonic particles have a mass of @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively , at @xmath28 , and the gravitational softening was set at a twenty - fifth of the mean linear interparticle spacing , @xmath31kpc .",
    "the codecs suite includes  besides the standard ",
    "fiducial \" @xmath32cdm scenario  five different cde cosmologies : four models with an exponential self - interaction potential @xcite @xmath33 and one model with a sugra potential @xcite @xmath34 where for simplicity the scalar field has been redefined in units of the reduced planck mass @xmath35 .",
    "all the former models have the same value for the potential slope @xmath36 but differ from one another in the coupling function : three models ( named exp001 , exp002 , and exp003 ) are characterized by a constant coupling @xmath37 with values @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively , consistent with present observational bounds on the de - cdm interaction ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while the remaining one ( named exp008e3 ) has an exponential coupling of the form @xmath40 . for the latter , instead ,",
    "a negative constant coupling @xmath41 is assumed , allowing for a non - standard evolution of the resulting cde model as proposed and explained in detail by @xcite .",
    "the combination of a sugra potential and of a negative coupling determines a peculiar dynamics of the scalar field , that changes its direction of motion at some intermediate redshift between @xmath42 and the present time . as a consequence of this inversion of motion , which for the specific model presented here ( named sugra003 ) occurs at @xmath43 , the de equation of state parameter @xmath44 shows a  bounce \" on the cosmological constant barrier @xmath45 . for this reason this new class of cde models",
    "has been called the  bouncing cde scenario \" @xcite .",
    "all the models included in the codecs suite have been normalized according to the latest results from wmap7 @xcite both for what concerns their background cosmological parameters at @xmath28 and the amplitude of linear density perturbations at the last scattering surface @xmath46 .",
    "the codecs runs are therefore fully consistent with present bounds on the perturbations amplitude at @xmath47 and allow to investigate the effects that a specific cde scenario imprints on structure formation processes from @xmath47 to the present .",
    "table [ tab : model ] lists the six cosmological models included in the codecs suite , with the corresponding coupling function , potential type , and the expected value of @xmath48 that are derived for each scenario with the help of the linear perturbation theory . for a more detailed introduction to the codecs project and its related public database ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning here that all the cde models considered here , with the only exception of the sugra003 model , could be directly constrained by local measurements of the linear perturbations amplitude @xmath48 at low redshifts",
    ". in particular , the exp003 model might be already in tension with presently available constraints on the power spectrum amplitude , @xmath49 , which have been determined by several independent low-@xmath50 observations such as galaxy - galaxy correlation function , cosmic shear statistics , x - ray cluster abundance and ly-@xmath51 forest .",
    "on the other hand , the exp002 and exp008e3 models appear still marginally consistent with this current limit on @xmath52 .      using the codecs public halo catalogs at @xmath28",
    ", we first construct a mass - limited ( @xmath53 m@xmath54 ) sample of the cluster - sized halos identified in the simulations of each cosmological model .",
    "the codecs halo catalogs have been produced by means of a friends - of - friends ( fof ) algorithm @xcite with linking length @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the mean inter - particle separation and the linking parameter @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "reapplying the fof algorithm with a linking parameter of @xmath58 to the mass - limited sample from the codecs halo catalogs , we find the clusters - of - clusters for each of which the most massive cluster is identified as the main cluster while the others are considered as satellites , as done in @xcite .",
    "the bullet - like systems are selected from the identified clusters of clusters according to the same four criteria that were used by @xcite : @xmath59 the main cluster s mass @xmath60 exceeds a certain cut - off value ; @xmath61 the main cluster and at least one of its satellites are on the way of head - on collision ( @xmath62 , where @xmath51 is the angle between the velocities of the main cluster and the colliding satellite ) ; @xmath63 the mass ratio between the satellite and main cluster is smaller than one fifth ( @xmath64 ) ; @xmath65 the satellite is located within the distances of @xmath6 from its main cluster where @xmath4 is the virial radius of its main cluster .",
    "the bullet - like systems must satisfy the first three criteria to match the observed properties of the bullet cluster ( ie0657 - 57 ) while the last criterion is used to find the infall pairwise velocities of the main - satellite cluster pairs before the collisions .",
    "for the detailed explanation of these criteria , we refer the readers to @xcite .    regarding the cut - off value of the main cluster s mass , it is worth mentioning here that the main cluster in the observed bullet cluster ( ie0657 - 56 ) is a very massive one with mass of @xmath66 .",
    "in the current codecs samples , however , there are too few ( less than @xmath67 ) bullet - like systems satisfying @xmath66 . to avoid the poor number statistics , we use lower cut - off values , @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "we also focus on the @xmath28 sample for the same reason ( at higher redshifts there are too few bullet - like systems ) .",
    "table [ tab : nbullet ] lists the number of clusters ( @xmath70 ) in the mass - limited sample , the number of the identified clusters of clusters ( @xmath71 ) , the number and mean pairwise infall velocity of the selected bullet - like systems ( @xmath72 and @xmath73 ) for the two different cases of the main cluster s mass cutoff .",
    "as can be seen , the cde models have systematically larger values of @xmath74 than the @xmath5cdm model , which is consistent with the picture that the dark sector coupling leads to a faster growth of the large - scale structures . regarding the mean infall velocities , all of the cde models except of the sugra003 model yield higher values of @xmath73 . the larger the coupling is , the higher is the mean infall velocity of the bullet - like systems . in the sugra003 model ,",
    "however , the value of @xmath73 is slightly lower than the @xmath5cdm case when @xmath68 , which should be attributed to the negative value of the coupling constant ( see  4 for more discussions ) .",
    "for each selected bullet - like system , we measure the relative pairwise velocities , @xmath75 , where @xmath76 and @xmath77 denote the velocities of the main and satellite clusters , respectively",
    ". then , we bin the values of @xmath78 and count the number of those bullet - like systems with @xmath78 belonging to a given differential bin , @xmath79 $ ] , to derive the probability density distribution of @xmath78 for each cde model and for the @xmath5cdm model as well , as done in @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : pro1 ] plots @xmath80 at @xmath28 for the case of the standard @xmath5cdm cosmology ( solid black histogram ) and for the cases of the three cde models with constant coupling and exponential potential ( exp001 , exp002 and exp003 as dotted cyan , dashed green and dot - dashed blue histograms , respectively ) .",
    "as can be seen , the distribution @xmath80 shows a tendency to develop a longer high - velocity tail in the cde models with respect to @xmath5cdm .",
    "more specifically , the exp002 model with @xmath81 exhibits the longest high - velocity tail among the three models .    to quantify the difference among the four distributions and to calculate the cumulative probability of @xmath0",
    ", we fit @xmath80 to a gaussian distribution by adjusting for each model the mean and standard deviation , @xmath82 , as done in @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : fit1 ] plots the fitting results .",
    "as can be seen , the gaussian distribution gives a reasonably good fit to @xmath80 for each case .",
    "table [ tab : fit ] lists the best - fit values of @xmath83 for the three models , showing that the gaussian fit to the infall velocity distribution @xmath80 has a larger mean and a larger standard deviation in the constant coupling cde models than in the @xmath5cdm cosmology .",
    "the infall velocity distribution with the highest mean is found , as expected , for the case of the exp003 model , while exp002 has the largest standard deviation .    integrating the best - fit gaussian distributions",
    ", we also compute for each model the cumulative probabilities , @xmath84 and @xmath85 , which are plotted in figure [ fig : cpro1 ] as a function of the constant coupling @xmath86 , where @xmath5cdm corresponds to @xmath87 .",
    "as can be seen , the highest values of the two cumulative probabilities are found for the case of the exp002 model .",
    "the values of @xmath84 and @xmath85 increase by a factor of @xmath88 and @xmath89 in the exp002 model compared to @xmath5cdm case .",
    "it is interesting to note that although the exp003 model has a stronger coupling , its cumulative probabilities are not higher than those of the exp002 model .",
    "the same type of analysis has been carried out for the other two cde models included in the codecs suite , namely exp008e3 and sugra003 .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ fig : pro2 ] , where the probability density distribution @xmath80 computed for these models is plotted and and compared to the @xmath5cdm case , while figure [ fig : fit2 ] plots the gaussian fitting functions whose best - fit means and best - fit standard deviations are listed in table [ tab : fit ] . as can be seen , the probability density distribution @xmath80 for the case of the exp008e3 model has both the largest mean and standard deviation , while the sugra003 model yields a smaller mean but a larger standard deviation of @xmath80 than @xmath5cdm .",
    "the cumulative probabilities , @xmath84 and @xmath85 , are plotted in the top and bottom panels of figure [ fig : cpro2 ] , respectively .",
    "as can be seen , both the sugra003 and exp008e3 models have larger cumulative probabilities than @xmath32cdm . for the case of sugra003 , when the lower mass limit for the main cluster is set at @xmath90 m@xmath54 , the cumulative probabilities , @xmath91 and @xmath92 , increase by a factor of @xmath93 and @xmath94 , respectively , compared to @xmath5cdm .",
    "however , when the mass cutoff is set at @xmath95 m@xmath54 , the sugra003 model shows almost no enhancement .",
    "in contrast , exp008e3 exhibits the maximal enhancement , no matter which lower mass limit of the main cluster is used .",
    "the cumulative probabilities , @xmath96 and @xmath97 , increase by a factor of @xmath98 and @xmath89 , respectively , compared to the @xmath5cdm result .",
    "note that in this model @xmath97 reaches up to above @xmath10 , which indicates that if the required infall velocity of a bullet - like system can be possibly reduced to @xmath2 km / s @xcite , then the existence of the bullet cluster is not such an extremely rare event in a cde model like the exponential coupling scenario exp008e3 .",
    "furthermore , it is worth mentioning here that the above cumulative probabilities are likely to be underestimated due to the limited volume of the codecs runs . as shown in @xcite , the probability of finding a bullet cluster increases almost linearly with the simulation box volume . in other words ,",
    "the larger volume a simulation box has , the more probable it is to find a bullet - like system with required infall velocity .",
    "in fact , we find for the case of @xmath5cdm model @xmath99 which is an order of magnitude lower than what @xcite found , @xmath100 , from the mice simulation of volume @xmath101 . given this",
    ", we suspect that the real value of @xmath84 and @xmath102 ) would be higher than our estimates @xmath103 and @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "we have carried out a systematic investigation of how the probability of finding a bullet - like system with the required high - infall velocity ( @xmath1 km / s or possibly at least @xmath2 km / s ) changes in the context of cde models compared to the standard @xmath5cdm cosmology , by analyzing the public numerical data from codecs , the largest n - body simulations of cde models to date , with a box size of @xmath104 comoving @xmath105gpc@xmath106 .",
    "three models with constant coupling and exponential potential ( exp001 , exp002 , exp003 ) , one bouncing cde model with constant coupling and sugra potential ( sugra003 ) , and one model with exponential coupling and exponential potential ( exp008e3 ) are considered in the codecs suite , besides the fiducial @xmath5cdm cosmology .    in all of the five cde models the cumulative probabilities",
    "have been found to be higher than in @xmath5cdm .",
    "it has been also shown that the maximal four and five orders of magnitude enhancements of the cumulative probabilities are yielded by the exp008e3 model where @xmath85 and @xmath84 reach up to above @xmath10 and @xmath103 , respectively .",
    "this is a remarkable result , considering that all the codecs simulations share the same random phases in the initial conditions and the same amplitude of density perturbations at the last scattering surface .",
    "furthermore , given the possible underestimate of the cumulative probabilities due to the limited volume of codecs @xcite , we argue that our results should be considered conservative and that therefore the existence of the bullet cluster should not be regarded as an extremely rare event in the exp008e3 model . yet , in the other cde models it should be still quite unlikely to find a bullet cluster with the observed morphology .",
    "the different amplitudes of the bullet velocity enhancement in the different cde models can be qualitatively understood by considering the time evolution of the linear density and velocity perturbations of each scenario . by taking into account only the coupling strength and its integrated effect on the growth of density perturbations , in fact , our finding that the maximal velocity enhancement is obtained for the exponential coupling model ( exp008e3 ) might look surprising .",
    "as shown by @xcite ( see the right panel of figure 2 in the reference ) , the maximal effect on the density perturbation amplitude is obtained for the exp003 model that reaches at @xmath28 an enhancement of @xmath107 of about 20% relative to @xmath32cdm , while the exp008e3 model shows a @xmath108 enhancement ( as also described by the different @xmath48 values listed in table [ tab : model ] among the models ) .",
    "however , if we also consider the velocity perturbation variable @xmath109 , defined as @xmath110 where @xmath111 are the individual velocity perturbation variables , @xmath112 are the peculiar velocities , and @xmath113 the relative density parameters for baryons and cdm , respectively , we can separately solve for @xmath114 in the different cosmologies , and compare the time evolution of the velocity perturbations to the @xmath32cdm case .",
    "in the linear regime , the density and velocity perturbations @xmath115 and @xmath116 for baryons and cdm in a cde cosmology evolve according to the following system of coupled differential equations : @xmath117 \\theta _ { c } + \\frac{3}{2}\\left [ \\omega   _ { b}\\delta _ { b } + \\omega _ { c}\\delta _ { c}\\gamma _ { c}\\right ] \\\\ \\label{delb } \\delta ' _ { b } & = & \\theta _ { b}\\\\ \\label{th_b } \\theta ' _ { b } & = & \\left [ \\frac{1}{2}\\left ( 3w_{\\phi } \\omega _ { \\phi } + \\omega _ { r }   -1\\right)\\right ] \\theta _ { b } + \\frac{3}{2}\\left [ \\omega _ { b}\\delta _ { b } + \\omega   _ { c}\\delta _ { c}\\right]\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where a prime denotes a derivative with respect to the e - folding time @xmath118 , @xmath119 and @xmath120 are the de and radiation fractional densities , respectively , @xmath44 is the de equation of state parameter , and the three functions @xmath121 , @xmath122 and @xmath123 encode the deviation from the standard @xmath32cdm cosmology due to the de interaction , being @xmath124 for an uncoupled de field ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* for a more detailed description of the perturbation equations and a definition of the functions @xmath125 and @xmath126 ) .",
    "by solving the system ( [ del_c]-[th_b ] ) we can separately compute the time evolution of the individual density and velocity perturbations for baryons and cdm and derive the total velocity perturbation @xmath127 given by equation  ( [ eqn : theta ] ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : theta ] we plot the ratio of the velocity perturbation @xmath127 to the @xmath32cdm case for all the models considered in the present work .",
    "as one can see from the figure , the situation is significantly different with respect to the evolution of the density perturbation @xmath128 .",
    "in particular , we display here for the first time the redshift evolution of the velocity perturbation @xmath127 in a significant number of cde scenarios , and our results show how a given cde model can have a significantly different relative impact on the density and velocity perturbations .",
    "figure [ fig : theta ] clearly shows that the maximal enhancement of velocity perturbations with respect to @xmath5cdm is realized by the exp008e3 model ( orange , long - dashed line )  consistently with our findings on the infall velocity in the bullet - like systems identified in the codecs simulations  even if the corresponding enhancement of the density perturbations amplitude ( i.e. of @xmath48 ) is significantly smaller than in the exp003 model ( blue , dot - dashed line ) .",
    "although the solution for @xmath109 displayed in figure [ fig : theta ] is strictly valid only in the linear regime ( as for the case of the density perturbation @xmath128 ) , the relative impact of the different cde models on the velocity perturbations can be considered reliable also in the nonlinear regime for situations where the velocity vector is aligned with the gradient of the gravitational potential , since in such a case the extra - friction and the fifth - force contributions arising as a consequence of the de interaction are also aligned with each other and keep behaving as for the linear case .",
    "this is in particular the situation of the bullet - like systems that we are considering in the present work , due to the head - on collision between the two clusters .",
    "therefore we can consider the results obtained for the linear solution of the velocity perturbation @xmath127 as indicative of the impact of the coupling even in these highly nonlinear systems .",
    "see @xcite for a discussion on the linear and nonlinear effects of the friction term .",
    "particularly interesting is also the case of the bouncing cde model sugra003 : for this scenario , in fact , the velocity perturbation @xmath127 follows a similar path as for the exp003 model at high redshifts , but is suddenly slowed down in correspondence to the bounce of the de scalar field at @xmath129 , and is the only model to have a smaller velocity perturbation @xmath109 as compared to @xmath32cdm at low redshifts .",
    "this is consistent with the background dynamics of the bouncing cde scenario , that features an inversion of the scalar field motion at @xmath130 with the consequent change of sign of the friction term @xmath131 , that accelerates particles in their direction of motion before @xmath130 , while it decelerates particles after @xmath130 .",
    "the suppression of the velocity perturbation variable @xmath127 after @xmath130 is therefore an expected effect due to the peculiar dynamics o the bouncing cde scenario .",
    "this is reflected in the lower value of the mean pairwise infall velocity detected in our sample for the bouncing cde model ( see table  [ tab : fit ] ) , unique among the cde models considered in our analysis .",
    "nevertheless , as already mentioned above , the effect of the friction term become more complex in the nonlinear regime , due to the relative orientation between the local velocity field and the gravitational potential gradient .",
    "we speculate here that this additional degree of freedom that modulates the efficiency of the friction term in slowing down cdm particle is responsible for the larger variance detected in the pairwise infall velocity distribution in our sample ( see again table  [ tab : fit ] ) which is reflected in a slightly enhanced detection probability even for the sugra003 scenario , in spite of the reduction of the mean infall velocity .    to see whether or not the enhanced velocities of the bullet - like systems in cde models",
    "are really related to the enhanced values of the linear velocity perturbations , we compare the ratio of the mean infall velocity of the bullet- like systems for each cde model to that for the @xmath5cdm model , @xmath132 ( from table [ tab : nbullet ] ) with the values of @xmath133 at @xmath28 ( from figure [ fig : theta ] ) .",
    "the results are plotted in figures [ fig : v05 ] and [ fig : v07 ] for the cases of @xmath68 and @xmath134 , respectively . in each figure",
    ", the dotted line corresponds to the case that the two ratios have the same values .",
    "as can be seen , the enhancements of @xmath73 relative to the @xmath5cdm case indeed follow the pattern of the enhancements of @xmath109 relative to @xmath135 . in the sugra003 model ,",
    "however , @xmath132 is significantly larger than @xmath133 at @xmath28 , which reflects the peculiar evolution of the sugra003 velocity perturbations shown in figure [ fig : theta ] .    to conclude",
    ", we have performed a comprehensive investigation of the effect of coupled dark energy models on the pairwise infall velocity of the bullet - like systems identified in the public catalogs of the codecs n - body simulations . since our results",
    "have clearly demonstrated that coupled dark energy has the effect of speeding up the bullet - like systems and that the strength of the effect significantly depends on the shape of the scalar potential as well as of the coupling function , we conclude that the bullet cluster will become a valuable constraint of the coupled dark energy scenario .",

    "<S> it has been recently shown that the observed morphological properties of the bullet cluster can be accurately reproduced in hydrodynamical simulations only when the infall pairwise velocity @xmath0 of the system exceeds @xmath1 km / s ( or at least possibly @xmath2 km / s ) at the pair separation of @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the virial radius of the main cluster , and that the probability of finding such a bullet - like system is extremely low in the standard @xmath5cdm cosmology . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest here the fifth - force mediated by a coupled dark energy ( cde ) as a possible velocity - enhancing mechanism and investigate its effect on the infall velocities of the bullet - like systems from the codecs ( coupled dark energy cosmological simulations ) public database . </S>",
    "<S> five different cde models are considered : three with constant coupling and exponential potential , one with exponential coupling and exponential potential , and one with constant coupling and supergravity potential . for each model , after identifying the bullet - like systems , we determine the probability density distribution of their infall velocities at the pair separations of @xmath6 . approximating each probability density distribution as a gaussian </S>",
    "<S> , we calculate the cumulative probability of finding a bullet - like system with @xmath7 km / s or @xmath8 km / s . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that in all of the five cde models the cumulative probabilities increase compared to the @xmath5cdm case and that in the model with exponential coupling @xmath9 exceeds @xmath10 . the physical interpretations and cosmological implications of our results are provided . </S>"
