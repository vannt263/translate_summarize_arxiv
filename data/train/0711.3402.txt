    "( this is made precise in section [ sec : def ] . )",
    "alt posed and showed existence @xcite for a version of the thread problem where each surface is parametrized on disc(s ) .",

    "versions of this problem were also studied in geometric measure theory ( k. ecker , @xcite ) , and flat chains modulo 2 ( r. pilz @xcite ) .",

    ", the thread curve spends part of its length coinciding with the wire curve , and part of its length free of the wire , bounding surface components .",
    "we call these surface components _ crescents _ because of their typical shape . where the thread is free , its curvature vector has constant length ( relating to the lagrange multiplier for the problem ) , and lies in the tangent plane of the adjoining crescent .",
    "minimizers which lie within a small neighborhood of the wire are called _ near - wire minimizers .",
    "_ they are interesting for three reasons .",
    "first , they are important to settling a finiteness conjecture ( conjecture [ conj : finiteness ] ) .",
    "second they are guaranteed to arise when the thread length is near the wire length ( theorem [ thm : nearwire ] ) .",
    "thirdly , we will show ( in two later papers ) that they have @xmath6 regularity up to corner points and the normal vector at the corner is forced by local wire geometry .",
    "( @xmath6 up to corners is more regular than what had been shown in the three approaches ; it improves on the @xmath7 regularity known for alt minimizers ) .",
    "we revisit our three points below , and thus outline this paper .",
    "alt s existence proof for the thread problem yields minimizers that may have , a priori , a countable infinity of crescents .",
    "see * figure  * . in experiment",
    "@xcite one sees that small crescents always contain a maxima of wire curvature where they meet the wire .",
    "this motivates the following conjecture .",
    "[ conj : finiteness ] let @xmath2 be a space curve which is @xmath5 and generic in the sense of section [ sec : generic ] . then any alt minimizer @xmath8 for @xmath2 has at most @xmath9 crescents , where @xmath9 only depends on the @xmath5 data of @xmath2 .",

    "it is plausible from both thought experiments and physical ones that if the thread length is near the wire length , any minimizer lies near the wire .",
    "this is nontrivial to prove , however , because it is not a perturbation statement . when the thread length is near the wire length , it is still quite large , and competitors may range far from the wire .",

    "there is a constant @xmath20 so if @xmath8 is a minimizer for the thread problem @xmath21 then @xmath8 lies in a small radius @xmath22 normal neighborhood of @xmath2 : @xmath23 here @xmath24 and the error terms do not depend on @xmath8 .",
    "we give the proof in section [ sec : nearwire ] ; it depends on a weighted isoperimetric inequality ( lemma [ lem : wtd_iso ] ) and a nonconvex confinement result for small - area minimal surfaces ( lemma [ lem : nearwire ] ) .",
    "a priori , a near - wire minimizer could be a very complicated beast , with crescents intersecting themselves in swirling surfaces which could range far up and down the tubular enclosure , far from their supporting wires .",
    "they could also have branch points .",
    "see * figure  * . the next lemma tames such potential behavior .",

    "now consider the operations on subsets @xmath167 , @xmath168 the first sends closed subsets to closed subsets as @xmath12 is compact ; the second sends open subsets to open subsets , because @xmath169 where @xmath170 is any open set in @xmath4 intersecting @xmath45 as @xmath171 . because we assume that @xmath172 is empty , @xmath173 and @xmath174 are actually the same operation , which we can call @xmath175 .",
    "the map @xmath175 sends sets open - and - closed subsets of @xmath166 to possibly smaller open - and - closed subsets of @xmath166 .",
    "moreover , if @xmath165 contains @xmath162 then @xmath176 will contain @xmath162 .",
    "we obtain @xmath177 where @xmath178 are open - and - closed subsets of @xmath158 which contain @xmath162 .",
    "this confirms that @xmath179 .",

    "having verified that the conditions of the lemma  [ lem : harm_level_set : ] are all met , we may now employ its conclusions about @xmath44 , which is a union of connected components of @xmath166 .",
    "they are exactly sufficient for our purposes .",
    "_ ( of lemma [ thm : slope : slicewise ] ) _ when the wire curve is planar , the alt crescent is planar by theorem [ thm : chull ] .",
    "this case is easy ; in the remainder of the proof we assume that @xmath2 is nonplanar .",
    "let @xmath181 be the extension of the arclength parameter of @xmath2 constantly along normal discs . by the near - wire assumption ,",
    "each crescent @xmath150 of the minimizer lies in the union of normal discs , @xmath182 .",
    "we have @xmath183 pulling back the extended arclength parameter function @xmath181 by @xmath150 decomposes the domain @xmath31 of @xmath150 into connected level sets .",

    "the level sets for @xmath185 are continuous curves of positive length .",
    "the level sets @xmath186 are points @xmath187 or @xmath188 .",
    "we prove this lemma by applying lemma  [ lem : plane_cresc : intg ] . for each @xmath189",
    ", we consider the normal disc @xmath190 .",
    "this is a compact subset of a plane , and it intersects the plane in exactly one point , @xmath191 .",
    "the alt crescent @xmath148 is disjoint from the circle bounding @xmath190 because it lies strictly within the tubular neighborhood @xmath192 . by lemma  [ lem : plane_cresc : intg ] ,",
    "the set @xmath193 is either    1 .   a single point @xmath194 , or 2 .   a connected set whose only component is a finite tree graph",

    "the properties @xmath58-@xmath197 listed under item @xmath64 in lemma  [ lem : plane_cresc : intg ] force the graph to be a segment connecting @xmath196 in @xmath195 to a point in @xmath41 .",
    "3 .   a set which contains @xmath41 ;",
    "moreover in this case we also have that the free thread curvature vanishes .",
    "but that means that the entire free thread for this crescent lies in the normal disc @xmath198 .",
    "this normal disc only intersects the wire at @xmath199 .",
    "so we have @xmath200 which violates the embeddedness of @xmath2 .",
    "we conclude that case @xmath154 can not occur .",

    "so case @xmath95 can only occur for @xmath209 .",
    "moreover , it must occur for each of these points ; if the level set @xmath210 were a curve from @xmath188 to @xmath50 then we would violate lemma  [ lem : harm_level_set : nocycle ] .",
    "o0pt   [ sec : firstvar ]        this is straightforward .",
    "if the thread has negative curvature , we can find a point @xmath212 which is not a branch point .",
    "we may then pick a plane perpendicular to the side normal to the surface at @xmath213 and translate the plane towards the surface a small amount .",
    "then we have a situation like the one shown in * figure  * . projecting the thread and surface onto that plane",
    "reduces the dirichlet energy of the map @xmath150 , and it also reduces the length of the free thread . in this way",
    "we show that there is another alt competitor with strictly less dirichlet energy .",
    "this contradicts the minimizing property of @xmath8 .",
    "when the free thread curvature @xmath152 of @xmath148 is zero , the free thread is a straight segment .",

    "if this vector points normally out of @xmath31 , then we may use the fact that @xmath217 to show that as we move along @xmath37 away from @xmath51 , we have @xmath36 increasing to second order .",
    "[ lem : pipe ] let @xmath2 be a @xmath227 curve with a simple @xmath228-normal neighborhood .",

    "for @xmath233 , the set @xmath234 of points in @xmath235 distance @xmath236 from @xmath230 consists of a sequence of cylindrical surfaces joined along circles and portions of spheres , as shown in * figure  * .",

    "the normal discs @xmath242 are disjoint .",
    "an application of taylor s theorem shows that the radius @xmath243 disc @xmath244 bisecting the angles of @xmath230 at @xmath245 has unit normal vector within @xmath246 of @xmath247 .",
