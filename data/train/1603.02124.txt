    "current technology allows the manipulation and control of the electron dynamics in small devices of nanometric size , such as semiconductor quantum dots and quantum wells .",
    "these devices have attracted considerable attention in the last few decades , particularly in view of their potential use for quantum computing @xcite .",
    "when the confining potential well is perfectly parabolic , the electron response is dominated by the kohn mode @xcite , i.e. , a rigid oscillation of the electron density at the characteristic frequency of the parabolic well . for nonparabolic confinement",
    "the situation is much more complex",
    ". when the excitation is small ( linear response ) , the kohn mode may still be dominating .",
    "however , for larger excitation energies , the electrons may explore the anharmonic regions of the confining potential ; in that case , the frequency spectrum of such nonlinear response becomes much more intricate , with the appearance of second- and higher - order harmonics .",
    "in addition to the effect of the anharmonicity of the confinement , the interparticle coulomb interactions also contribute to the complexity of the spectral response . at a mathematical level",
    ", this complexity arises because the center - of - mass and internal degrees of freedom can no longer be separated , as was shown in several studies that use powerful exact methods to model the quantum electron dynamics @xcite .",
    "however , exact approaches are necessarily limited to a very small number of particles .",
    "although such few- or even single - electron systems can nowadays be realized in the laboratory , in most practical situations a great many electrons are involved @xcite . in that case",
    "self - consistent effects  arising from the coulomb interactions between all the electrons  play a crucial role on the dynamics .",
    "several theoretical and computational studies , which treat the many - body dynamics in an approximate way , have investigated the linear and nonlinear electron response .",
    "the methods of choice are the hartree - fock equations @xcite , density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite , or phase - space methods based on wigner functions @xcite .",
    "even the above - cited methods can be computationally too costly for very large systems .",
    "a possible alternative relies on quantum hydrodynamics ( qhd ) @xcite , an approach that was successfully used in the past to model the electron dynamics in molecular systems @xcite , metallic nanoparticles @xcite and thin films @xcite , and semiconductor quantum wells @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite the validity of the qhd method was studied and compared to dft results .",
    "more recently , we used a qhd approach to investigate high - harmonic generation in metallic nanoparticles excited with ultrafast laser pulses @xcite",
    ".    the qhd model can be further simplified by means of a variational approach @xcite that expresses the qhd equations in terms of a lagrangian density . with this method ,",
    "it is possible to obtain a system of ordinary differential equations for a set of macroscopic quantities , such as the center of mass and the size of the electron gas .",
    "although simple , the final equations still capture some of the most prominent features of the electron dynamics , namely : ( i ) the self - consistent coulomb interaction , ( ii ) quantum effects to lowest order , ( iii ) exchange and correlation effects in a dft fashion , and ( iv ) the geometry of the confining well .    here , we will use this approach to study the collective dynamics of an electron gas confined in a semiconductor quantum well .",
    "the simplicity of the model allows one to carry out a large number of simulations , so that the electron dynamics can be fully characterized",
    ". our main focus will be on the effect of the anharmonicity and the anisotropy of the potential well on the electron response .",
    "we will see that , when increasing the anharmonic component of the confining potential , the electron dynamics becomes more and more complex and eventually fully chaotic .",
    "the anisotropy of the confinement and the magnitude of the coulomb effects ( i.e. , the number of trapped electrons ) also play an important role in this transition",
    ". we will finally show that the appearance of chaotic behavior is accompanied by the presence of higher - order harmonics in the electron response .",
    "the set of qhd equations for the electron density @xmath0 , the electron mean velocity @xmath1 , and the hartree potential @xmath2 reads as @xmath3 where the first equation above represents conservation of mass , the second represents conservation of momentum , and the third is poisson s equation for the self - consistent hartree potential @xmath4 . in eq .",

    "is the so - called bohm potential , which incorporates quantum effects to the lowest order .",
    "the bohm potential is related to the so - called von weizscker term in thomas - fermi theory and orbital - free dft @xcite .",
    "the above equations are written in ",

    ", we use poincar sections as evidence of chaotic behavior .",
    "we also point out that this type of study is feasible because our reduced mathematical model is a system of ordinary differential equations , which can be analyzed with the usual methods of classical hamiltonian mechanics .",
    "the method of poincar sections consists in choosing a two - dimensional cross - section ( i.e. , a plane ) of the entire phase space ( which , in our case , is six - dimensional ) and recording the position on such plane each time that the representative point of the system crosses it .",

    "it can be shown that the effect of the field can be included simply by adding a term @xmath131 to the lagrangian @xmath54 .",
    "we consider three cases here : ( i ) an excitation at a nonresonant frequency , ( ii ) an excitation at a resonant frequency , and ( iii ) an excitation with chirp ( autoresonance ) .",

    "in the first case ( green curves on the figure ) , @xmath136 differs from the linear response frequency @xmath137 .",
    "being out of resonance , the system stays close to the linear regime : the oscillation amplitude remains small ( fig .",
    "[ fig : laser]a ) and only a small amount of energy is absorbed by the electron gas ( fig .",
    "[ fig : laser]b ) the power spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ fig : laser]c ) displays four ( small ) peaks , corresponding to the laser frequency , the linear response frequency , and the harmonics @xmath138 .    for a resonant excitation @xmath139 ( black curves ) , the oscillation amplitude and the absorbed energy initially increase , but then decrease again after some time .",
    "this is because the effective force acting on the dipole is not harmonic and the resonant frequency actually depends on the amplitude of the oscillations .",
    "when the amplitude grows and the system reaches the nonlinear regime , the fixed external frequency no longer matches the instantaneous resonant frequency ( which differs from @xmath137 in the nonlinear regime ) .",
    "the resulting power spectrum displays two lines corresponding to the linear frequency and the first harmonic .    , @xmath114 , @xmath81 , @xmath140 .",
    "the amplitude of the excitation is @xmath141 .",
    "we show the dipole amplitude @xmath124 ( a ) , the absorbed energy ( b ) , and the power spectrum @xmath126 ( c ) , for three cases : nonresonant excitation at constant frequency ( green curves ) , resonant excitation at constant frequency ( black ) , and chirped excitation ( red ) . ]",
    "finally , we use an oscillating field with a chirped frequency : @xmath142 , where @xmath143 is the rate of variation of the laser frequency .",
    "this type of forcing is known as autoresonance @xcite and was applied in the past to many physical systems @xcite .",
    "autoresonance occurs when a classical nonlinear oscillator is externally excited by an oscillating field with slowly varying frequency . for @xmath144 ( adiabatic process ) and",
    "@xmath133 above a certain threshold , the instantaneous oscillator frequency becomes  locked \" to the instantaneous excitation frequency , so that the resonance condition is always satisfied . in that case , the amplitude of the oscillations grows indefinitely and without saturation , until of course some other effect becomes dominant .",
    "usually the threshold behaves as @xmath145 , so that the amplitude can be arbitrarily small provided that the external frequency varies slowly enough @xcite .    in an earlier study , using the autoresonant technique in conjunction with a phase - space model of the electron dynamics , we showed that it is possible to efficiently extract the electrons from a gaussian - shaped quantum well @xcite .",
    "more recently , autoresonant excitation was used to trigger hhg in metallic nanoparticles @xcite .",
    "we now show that it can be very effective also for the systems considered here , namely quantum dots and quantum wells .    in order for autoresonance to work , the excitation frequency , which varies linearly in time as @xmath146 ,",
    "must cross at some point the resonant dipole frequency @xmath147 .",
    "therefore , for this simulation we chose @xmath148 and a chirp rate @xmath149 .",
    "the resonant frequency is crossed around @xmath150 , after which the autoresonant process starts being effective , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : laser ] .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : laser ] that the autoresonant excitation allows one to increase phenomenally the amplitude of the dipole oscillations and consequently the absorbed energy , which is roughly three times as large compared to the non chirped case .",
    "we stress that the excitation amplitude is the same for all cases . the power spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ fig : laser]c ) displays several peaks for higher order harmonics ( up to the third harmonic ) , with the first harmonic being roughly a factor of ten smaller that the linear mode .",
    "we also note that these spectral lines are unusually broad .",
    "this is probably due to the chirped excitation , which sweeps several frequencies around each harmonic .",
    "the important point is that , using a rather weak excitation ( @xmath151 in the present case , which could be made even weaker by reducing the chirp rate @xmath143 ) , one can induce significant energy absorption by the electron gas , accompanied by hhg at remarkably high levels .",
    "hhg is a highly topical research area with many potential applications @xcite ; most notably it is a prerequisite for the generation of attosecond laser pulses @xcite . in this work ,",
    "our aim was to explore the possibility of hhg using nanometric system containing many electrons , such as semiconductor quantum dots and wells . with this purpose in mind",
    ", we constructed an effective model in the form of a dynamical system made of six coupled differential equations for the center of mass and the size of the electron gas .",

    "the onset of chaos was quantified by the appearance of ergodic regions in some poincar sections .",
    "second , we demonstrated that hhg can be efficiently achieved by exciting the system with a chirped laser pulse .",
    "this process , known as classical autoresonance , is capable of bringing the electrons into a strongly nonlinear regime , leading to the generation of high harmonics .",
    "crucially , the autoresonance technique works well for relatively modest driving fields and does not require any fine tuning of the laser pulse .",

    "<S> an effective self - consistent model is derived and used to study the dynamics of an electron gas confined in a nonparabolic and anisotropic quantum well . </S>",
    "<S> this approach is based on the equations of quantum hydrodynamics , which incorporate quantum and nonlinear effects in an approximate fashion . </S>",
    "<S> the effective model consists of a set of six coupled differential equations ( dynamical system ) for the electric dipole and the size of the electron gas . using this model </S>",
    "<S> we show that : ( i ) high harmonic generation is related to the appearance of chaos in the phase space , as attested by related poincar sections ; ( ii ) higher order harmonics can be excited efficiently and with relatively weak driving fields by making use of chirped electromagnetic waves . </S>"
