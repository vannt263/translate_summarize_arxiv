    "the great success of mathematics in the natural sciences has always amazed and enchanted scientists @xcite , and quantum mechanics , with its use of very sophisticated mathematical notions in the description of physical entities ( such as complex hilbert spaces with an hermitian scalar product and self - adjoint operators ) is the perfect example of a theory which has taken full advantage of an advanced mathematical language .",
    "but quantum mechanics is not only remarkable for the sophistication of its mathematics : it is also for its `` unreasonable '' success in the description of a vast class of phenomena , not limited to those traditionally investigated by quantum physicists .",
    "the most surprising application of quantum physics , beyond the domain of microphysics , is probably in the study of human cognitive processes .",
    "indeed , the mathematical structure of quantum theory , with its non - classical ( non - kolmogorovian ) probability calculus , has been used with considerable success in the past decade to model aspects of human cognition , such that a new field of research within cognitive science , referred to as ` quantum cognition ' , emerged @xcite .    as a matter of fact , in quite some of these ` quantum cognition models , ' it is shown that quantum probabilities are more adapted and effective as compared to traditional approaches  based on classical , kolmogorovian probabilities  in capturing the way humans deal with their thinking through concepts and their combinations , and the way they make their decisions .    of course , regarding this ability of the quantum formalism in matching the description of not only microscopic entities , for the description of which it was invented and construed , but also of mental ones , as studied by cognitive and decision scientists , we can always say , quoting @xcite , that :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ `` [ @xmath0 many areas of inquiry that were historically part of physics are now considered part of mathematics , including complexity theory , geometry , and stochastic processes .",
    "originally they were applied to physical entities and events . for geometry , this was shapes of objects in space . for stochastic processes ,",
    "this was statistical mechanics of particles .",
    "over time they became generalized and applied to other domains .",

    "one of the possible hypotheses with respect to these examples is that they constitute instances of human thought deviating from classical logical thought .    since then , indeed",
    ", decision researchers have discovered the value of quantum modeling , making a profitable use of quantum decision models for the description of a large number of experimentally identified effects @xcite , such as the conjunction fallacy and the disjunction effect @xcite . in this regard ,",
    "let us mention that an explanation of the violation of the expected utility hypothesis and the sure - thing principle has now been modeled quantum cognitively , in terms of quantum interference effects @xcite , and that quantum structures have also proven their pertinence in the ambit of information retrieval research , a booming and significant domain in computer science , building on semantic space approaches @xcite .",
    "concerning concept combinations , very significant deviations from classicality were found in experiments conducted in the eighties by @xcite .",
    "one of us and his collaborators were able to recognize in these deviations from classicality for concept combinations the unmistakable signature of the presence of quantum structures , with their typical effects of interference , contextuality , entanglement and emergence @xcite .",
    "also the so called ` borderline contradictions ' , experimentally identified deviations from classical logic when a concept is conjuncted with its negation , could recently be modeled within the quantum cognition approach @xcite .",
    "a key step in the elaboration of the approach of quantum structures modeling concepts as in @xcite , was the possibility to formalize a concept as an _ entity in a specific state _ , and a context as a `` surrounding '' which is able to produce a change ( either deterministic or indeterministic ) of such state @xcite .",
    "just to give an example , consider the concept _",
    "pet_. when it is not under the influence of a specific context , we can say that it is in its ground state , which can be understood as a sort of basic prototype of the concept .",
    "but as soon as the concept _ pet _ is contextualized , for instance in the ambit of the phrase _ did you see the type of pet he has ?",
    "this explains that he is a weird person _",
    ", its state will change , so that its previous ground state will stop playing the role of a prototype , which will now be played by its new state , as a sort of new ` contextualized prototype ' .",
    "the difference between the concept _ pet _ in a ground state and in an `` excited '' state , like the one associated with the above `` weird person context , '' can be assessed by submitting the concept to an additional context : that of the mind of a human subject , when it is asked to select a good exemplar of that concept , among a number of possible choices .",
    "the difference between these two states will then manifest , for example , in the fact that exemplars like _ snake _ and _ spider _ will be chosen much more frequently ( i.e. , with a higher probability ) when the _ pet _ concept is in the `` weird person '' excited state , rather than in its ground state .",
    "it is worth noticing that an exemplar of a concept also represents a possible state for it , although usually of a more concrete kind .",
    "for example , the _ snake _ exemplar corresponds to the more specific state _",
    "the pet is a snake_. furthermore , the decision process of a human subject , when selecting a good example of a concept in a given state , is also to be understood as a context , changing its state into a more concrete one .",
    "more precisely , one can think of the process of placing the concept _ pet _ in the context of other concepts ( as we have done when placing it in the phrase _ did you see the type of pet he has ?",
    "this explains that he is a weird person _ ) , as a determinative process , similar to what in physics is called a _",
    "preparation_.    on the other hand , when a human subject is stimulated to give a",
    "_ good example of _ the concept in that state , for instance choosing between _ snake _ , _ spider _ and other exemplars , then such context should be thought of as a _ measurement _",
    ", similar to the _ quantum measurements of the first kind _ performed in modern physics laboratories .",
    "indeed , the process being interrogative , its outcomes are generally unpredictable , and the different exemplars among which the subject has to choose define the eigenstates of the semantic observable s / he is effectively measuring .",
    "and of course , the relative frequencies of the measured outcomes of this observable will depend on the state of preparation of the conceptual entity .",
    "now , coming back to our initial question , about the relevance of the quantum formalism in the description of human s cognitive and decision processes , as we said it was only in more recent times , in the beginning of this century , that it was possible to explicitly show , relying on previous investigation in quantum probability , that the observed violations of classical logic in hampton s and other experiments could not , in any way , be modeled in the ambit of a classical ( kolmogorovian ) probability theory , not even when fuzzy structures were allowed .",
    "this is a result with strong implications for the nature of human thought itself , as it shows that something with a genuine non - classical structure is at work , `` in the background , '' in our cognitive processes .",
    "in other terms , the success of quantum physics in describing concepts and their combinations can , at least in part , be explained by considering what is the main difference between a non - classical ( quantum , or quantum - like ) probability theory , and a traditional classical one .",
    "this difference lies essentially in that quantum probabilities ( and more generally quantum - like probabilities ) typically describe conditions of lack of knowledge regarding properties that are _ created _ during an experiment ( the level of _ potentiality _ of the system ) , whereas classical probabilities only describe conditions of lack of knowledge regarding properties which were already actual before the experiment was executed .",
    "this means that the inadequacy of a classical probability calculus ( which is implicit in all traditional approaches , also those based on fuzzy - set theory ) in the modeling of human cognition is due precisely to its inadequacy in describing processes of creation ( to be understood here as processes of _ actualization of potential properties _ ) , whereas the adequacy of a quantum probability calculus is due to the fact that it was historically designed to do precisely this . in other terms , if the quantum approach to cognition works so well , it is because both the ` microscopic layer ' of our physical reality , populated by so - called quantum `` particles , '' and the ` cognitive layer ' of our mental reality , populated by conceptual entities , are realms of genuine ` potentialities , ' not of the type of a ` lack of knowledge of actualities . '",
    "so , there are very convincing reasons explaining why quantum physics performs so well in its modeling of human concepts , and we can say that these reasons are now beginning to be fairly well understood . of course , much more can be said in this regard , but we refer the reader to the above mentioned references and in particular to the analysis presented in @xcite ( see also @xcite and the references cited therein ) , as our scope in the present article , and in its continuation @xcite , is to concentrate on a different issue regarding the `` unreasonable '' effectiveness of the quantum mechanical formalism .",
    "what we are here referring to is that orthodox quantum theory is not the only available theory which is able to describe the level of potentiality present in a system and the associated processes of actualization of potential properties .    to better explain what we mean ,",
    "let us refer for example to the investigation in the axiomatic and operational content of physical theories , where standard quantum theory is built axiomatically starting from a much more general and as much as possible operationally founded approach .",
    "there have been many of such axiomatic quantum approaches , and it was even john von neumann himself who instigated the domain of research @xcite .",
    "we can recall , among other pioneers of this field of foundational investigation , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite @xcite and @xcite .",
    "also one of the authors , and his collaborators , were thoroughly engaged in research on quantum axiomatic in the foregoing century @xcite . in the course of these investigations",
    "they were able to identify relevant mathematical structures which are more general than those used in classical and quantum physics and , interestingly , it was also possible to find explicit macroscopic situations , not necessarily related to the description of entities of the microworld , which were conveniently described only by these more general intermediary structures , containing the pure classical and pure quantum structures as special limit cases @xcite .",
    "let us mention that the possibility of using quantum - like structures of a very general kind to properly model macroscopic situations has played an essential role in providing evidence that a quantum - like approach would also be appropriate for situations in human cognition . in this regard",
    ", we can refer to the introduction of the scop ( state context property ) formalism  a generalized quantum theory  for the modeling of concepts in @xcite .",
    "let us also mention the algebraic approach of beim graben and collegues @xcite , in which classical dynamical systems such as neural networks are shown to be able to exhibit quantum - like properties in the case of coarse - graining measurements , when testing properties that can not distinguish between epistemically equivalent states .",
    "since in neuroscience most measurements , such as electroencephalography or magnetic resonance imaging , can be considered to be coarse - graining measurements in this sense , this `` epistemic quantization '' has direct implications for brain neurophysiology , and this without needing to refer to a notion of a `` quantum brain . ''    however , what was nt expected in the beginning of these investigations , is that pure hilbertian structures , and the associated born rule for calculating the probabilities of the outcomes , would be so effective in the modeling of the main quantum effects identified in these domains , different from the microworld @xcite .",
    "therefore , the following question arises in a natural way : why the born rule , and not other `` rules , '' associated with more general quantum - like structures ? in other terms : why pure quantum measurements , as considered in relation to microphysical systems , appear ( so far ) to be so effective in modeling the most diverse data obtained in cognitive experiments ?",
    "this high degree of universality of the born rule , associated with pure quantum measurements , is quite surprising , as it is not evident at all that what is usually done in experiments like those conducted in cognitive science would be equivalent to what physicists do in experiments with microscopic entities .",
    "indeed , each subject participating in a cognitive experiment necessarily brings into it the uniqueness of her / his mind , i.e. , the uniqueness of her / his _ forma mentis _",
    ", with its specific conceptual network forming its inner memory structure . in other terms , it is as if in a physics laboratory each single outcome was obtained using a different measuring apparatus , every time adjusted in a different way , and possibly working according to different internal principles .",
    "what we mean to say is that each participant , because of the specificities of her / his mind structure , should be associated with a different statistics of outcomes .",
    "this means that in a typical cognitive experiments , involving a number of different subjects , different `` ways of choosing '' ( or different `` ways of estimating how participants would choose '' ) a good exemplar of a given concept are involved , and to each of these different ways of choosing , different probabilities should in principle be associated .",
    "this means that a cognitive experiment performed with a number of different subjects should be considered as a collection of different measurements , one for each participant . and",
    "each one of these different measurements should a priori be associated with probabilities having different numerical values ( as each participant chooses the outcomes differently ) , so that the overall probabilities deduced from the results of all the participants in the experiment are in fact averages over all these different probabilities .",
    "of course , we are here assuming that the different participants can all be ideally subjected to the same initial condition .",
    "this is certainly the case if , for instance , it corresponds to a concept in a well - defined state , as expressed by a word , or a phrase , in relation to a specific question . on the other hand , if the initial condition corresponds to a less precisely defined situation , for instance in a context requiring a decision , then fluctuations in the initial state should also be considered . but these fluctuations can in principle be reduced , whereas those relative to the measurement context , incorporated in each participant s mind , can not .",
    "so , a typical cognitive experiment is actually made of different quantum - like measurements , delivering different numerical values for the outcomes ( i.e. , for the exemplars ) , but all these different measurements are considered to be unidentifiable , and therefore are not distinguished in the final statistics .",
    "this means that the experimenters usually proceed as if they would lack knowledge about the different `` ways of choosing '' employed by the different participants , and simply average over all their individual `` hidden measurements , '' to obtain the final statistics .",
    "considering the above , we are undoubtedly confronted with a little mystery : how is it possible that the very specific born rule , associated with pure quantum structures , appears to be so good in describing the data gathered from experiments which are in fact statistical mixtures of different measurements , associated with different probabilities ?    here",
    "something quite surprising apparently happens : when averaging over different types of measurements , described by probabilities which are in principle different from those obtained by the quantum mechanical born rule , the result is nevertheless statistically equal to the born rule .",
    "this means that it should be possible to understand orthodox quantum mechanics as a theory describing the probabilistics of outcomes for measurements that are mixtures of all imaginable types of measurements , and this would also explain why the quantum statistics is so effective , in so many regions of reality , also regarding its numerical statistical predictions .",
    "it is precisely the purpose of the present article , and of its second part @xcite , to show that what is indirectly suggested by the experiments performed by cognitive scientists is actually true , i.e. , that orthodox quantum probabilities , described by the born rule , can be interpreted as the probabilities of a _ first - order non - classical theory _ , describing situations in which an experimenter does nt know anything about the nature of the interaction between the entity performing the measurement ( in physics , the measuring apparatus ; in cognitive sciences , the participating subject ) and the entity being measured ( in physics , a microscopic `` particle '' in a given state ; in cognitive sciences , a concept in a given state ) .",
    "more precisely , our aim is to introduce and motivate a notion of _ universal measurement _ , defined as an average over all possible kinds of measurements , and",
    "show that such average gives numerically exactly rise to the born rule of quantum mechanics , thus providing what we think is a fascinating explanation of why the quantum statistics performs so well , in so many experimental ambits .",
    "it would do so because it can be understood as a first order theory in the modeling of measurement data .",
    "it should be mentioned that the idea of universal measurements was firstly introduced by one of us , more than one decade ago @xcite , in the ambit of his analysis of classical , quantum and intermediary structures .",
    "it was already suggested at that time that when we are in a condition of maximal lack of knowledge , in a given experimental situation , what we may actually end up performing is a `` huge '' kind of measurement  a universal measurement  consisting in choosing at - random between all possible measurements .",
    "the interesting idea that was already brought forward then , although only as a conjecture , is that if there is `` one '' physical reality , then there should also be `` one '' universal measurement , connecting an initial state to a final state .",
    "this uniqueness of universal measurements was indirectly suggested by the existence of a famous theorem of quantum mechanics , _",
    "gleason s theorem _ , which affirms that `` if the transition probability depends only on the state before the measurement and on the eigenstate of the measurement that is actualized after the measurement , then this transition probability is equal to the quantum transition probability . '' and since this gleason property ( dependence of the transition probability only on the state before the measurement and the eigenstate that is actualized after the measurement ) is exactly a property that is satisfied , by definition , by a universal measurement , the theorem suggested ( within the limit of hilbertian structures ) the possibility that the transition probabilities connected with universal measurements would be precisely the quantum mechanical transition probabilities , described by the born rule .",
    "the idea , however , remained only conjectural at that time , because of difficulties related to the so - called _ bertrand paradox _",
    ", i.e. , to the fact that probabilities may depend on the randomization method chosen to perform a uniform average , when the number of possible cases is infinite @xcite .",
    "but these difficulties have now been overcome , thanks to a transparent definition of the uniform randomization over measurements , conceived as a limit of randomized discrete systems , much in the spirit of what is traditionally done in physics when averages over paths are performed , for instance in the study of brownian motion .",
    "the above was to emphasize that the results contained in this paper , and in @xcite , are of interest not only for cognitive scientists , but also for physicists , as the possibility of understanding the measurements of quantum mechanics as universal measurements is new and relevant in both domains of investigation .",
    "now , to be able to study the `` huge '' average associated with a universal measurement , we need a suitable and sufficiently general theoretical framework , and this brings us to the second element of novelty contained in this paper .",
    "indeed , this framework will be provided by an idealized system  that we call the _ general tension - reduction _ ( gtr ) model  able to describe a virtually infinite number of different measurement situations , in different dimensions , ranging from the classical deterministic ones , associated with processes of pure _ discovery _ , to the `` solipsistic '' indeterministic ones , associated with processes of pure _ creation _ , with in the middle the pure quantum regime , expressing a sort of equilibrium between these two extreme conditions of pure discovery and pure creation .",
    "it should be mentioned that the gtr - model that we introduce here is a non - trivial multidimensional generalization of what is known as the _ sphere - model _",
    "@xcite , which in turn is a generalization of the so - called _",
    "@xcite and , interestingly , for the special cases of 1 , 2 and 3 dimensions ( i.e. , 2 , 3 and 4 outcomes , respectively ) , it describes a system which in principle could be realized in a laboratory , by means of specially designed materials .",
    "one of the great advantages of the model is that it allows to fully understanding and even visualizing what goes on during a measurement , when the state of the entity under investigation collapses into an eigenstate of the measured observable , thus providing a considerable insight into many aspects of quantum structures . in particular",
    ", it explicitly shows that quantum and quantum - like measurements can be understood in terms of hidden ( potential ) measurement interactions , which are actualized in an unpredictable way each time an experiment is performed , in accordance with the so - called _ hidden - measurement approach _ @xcite .",
    "another important advantage of the gtr - model is that it allows to represent all kinds of possible distributions of hidden interactions , of which the pure quantum one only constitutes a very special case , corresponding to the choice of a uniform probability density @xmath2 .",
    "thanks to this great level of generality , it becomes possible to use the model as a general theoretical framework to state and derive our result regarding the correspondence between universal measurements and quantum measurements ( the result will only be enunciated and explained in the present article , the proof being given in @xcite ) .",
    "also , considering that the gtr - model is a more general theoretical framework than the hilbert - model , it can be exploited to model situations where the first order approximation expressed by the born rule would not be sufficient , i.e. , when some knowledge about the fluctuations present in the experimental context would be available , a possibility which is more likely to manifest in cognitive experiments than in physics experiments .",
    "the work is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ quantum probabilities for a single observable ] , we present some basic elements of the quantum formalism , to define notations and to allow to more easily establish , in the subsequent sections , the correspondence between quantum measurements and the measurement described in the gtr - model . in sec .",
    "[ thepolytopemodel ] , we start by analyzing the gtr - model in the special case where the probability density is uniform @xmath3 . this special case , which we refer to as the _ uniform tension - reduction _ ( utr ) model , is already sufficiently general to describe all possible probabilities arising in a single measurement , a fact that will be emphasized in sec .",
    "[ representingprobabilities ] , by means of a representation theorem .    in our study of the utr - model ( the gtr - model with a uniform probability density )",
    ", we will proceed in a pedestrian way , by first describing the one - dimensional ( two - outcome ) and two - dimensional ( three - outcomes ) situations , then generalizing the description to an arbitrary number of dimensions .",
    "although the model is per se abstract , in our analysis we will mostly concentrate on one of its possible physical realizations , using special elastic hypermembranes which can break and collapse in a specific way .    in sec .",
    "[ entanglementrhomodel ] , we use the utr - model to shed some light into the phenomenon of entanglement , showing that the process of _ emergence _ it subtends requires additional dimensions to be described . in sec .",
    "[ representingprobabilities ] , as we said , we state a general representation theorem , showing that the utr - model ( and equally so the hilbert - model ) is a `` universal probabilistic machine , '' able to represent any possible probabilities emerging from a single measurement .",
    "we also show that these probabilities can either be understood as the result of the presence of a uniform mixture of pure measurements or , in a sort of complementary picture , of a uniform mixture of initial states .    in sec .",
    "[ non - uniform ] , we introduce the more general gtr - model , which also admits non - uniform probability densities ( thus generalizing the utr - model ) , and use it to motivate a notion of _ universal measurement _ , which will be defined in a physically transparent and mathematically precise way .",
    "this will allow us to state our theorem about the equivalence between universal measurements and measurements characterized by uniform fluctuations ( and therefore their correspondence with the quantum mechanical born rule ) , which will be formally proven only in the second part of this article @xcite .    in sec .",
    "[ nonhilbert ] , we analyze in some detail the ampler structural richness of the gtr - model , by investigating , in the two - outcome case , the probabilities associated with _",
    "sequential measurements _ , showing that they can not in general be fitted into a hilbertian or kolmogorovian structure .",
    "finally , in sec .  [ conclusion ] , we offer some conclusive remarks .",
    "in this section we present some elements of the basic formalism of quantum mechanics , in relation to the measurement of a finite dimensional observable , which can either be degenerate or non - degenerate . in doing so",
    ", we will also describe the special case of a compound system made of two entities , and emphasize the difference between product and non - product ( entangled ) states .    in orthodox quantum theory ,",
    "the state of an entity ( for a physicist it can be a microscopic entity , such as an electron , for a cognitive scientist , a concept , or a situation apt for a decision process ) is described by a vector space over the field @xmath4 of complex numbers  the so - called hilbert space @xmath5  equipped with a ( sesquilinear ) inner product @xmath6 , which maps two vectors @xmath7 , @xmath8 to a complex number @xmath9 , and consequently with a norm @xmath10 , which assigns a positive length to each vector . in this article",
    "we only consider hilbert spaces having a finite number of dimensions , and will denote @xmath11 a hilbert space which is an @xmath12-dimensional vector space .    an observable is a measurable quantity of the entity under consideration , and in quantum theory is represented by a self - adjoint operator @xmath13 , acting on vectors of the hilbert space , i.e. , @xmath14 . in our case , being the hilbert space @xmath12-dimensional , @xmath13 can be entirely described by means of its @xmath12 eigenvectors @xmath15 and the associated ( real ) eigenvalues @xmath16 , obeying the eigenvalue relations @xmath17 , for all @xmath18 .",
    "if the eigenvectors have been duly normalized , so that in addition to the orthogonality relation @xmath19 , @xmath20 , they also obey the completeness relation @xmath21 , where @xmath22 denotes the unit operator , they can be used to construct the orthogonal projections @xmath23 , @xmath24 , obeying @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath20 , which in turn can be used to write the observable @xmath13 as the ( spectral ) sum : @xmath27a=\\sum_{i\\in i_{n } } a_i p_i.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    similarly , if @xmath28 , @xmath29 , is a normalized vector describing the state of the entity , it can be written as the sum : @xmath30 in the polar form @xmath31 .",

    ", the measurement of an observable @xmath13 is a process during which the state of the entity undergoes an abrupt transition  called `` collapse '' in the quantum jargon  passing from the initial state @xmath8 to a final state which is one of the eigenvectors @xmath15 of @xmath13 , associated with the eigenvalue @xmath16 , @xmath24 .",
    "the process is non - deterministic , and we can only describe it in probabilistic terms , by means of a `` golden rule , '' called the _ born rule _ , which states the following : the probability @xmath35 , for the transition @xmath36 , is given by the square of the length of the vector @xmath37 , i.e. , the square of the length of the initial vector once it has been projected onto the eigenspace of @xmath13 corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath16 .",
    "more explicitly : @xmath38 for all @xmath24 .",
    "and of course , according to ( [ sumofthexi ] ) , we have : @xmath39 as it must be , by definition of a probability .",
    "+   + _ the degenerate case _ + we consider now a _ degenerate _ observable @xmath13 .",
    "this means that some of the @xmath16 will have the same value , and therefore are not distinguishable , as outcomes , by the experimenter .",
    "to describe this situation , we consider @xmath40 disjoint subsets @xmath41 of @xmath42 , @xmath43 , having @xmath44 elements each , with @xmath45 and @xmath46 , so that @xmath47 .",
    "we then assume that the eigenvectors @xmath15 whose index belong to a same set @xmath41 are all associated with a same eigenvalue @xmath48 , @xmath44 times degenerate .",
    "therefore , defining the projectors @xmath49 , onto the @xmath44-dimensional eigenspace associated with the eigenvalues @xmath48 , ( [ observable - hilbert ] ) becomes : @xmath50 = \\sum_{k=1}^{n } a_{i_{m_k } } p_{i_{m_k}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and of course , ( [ observable - hilbert - degenerate ] ) gives back ( [ observable - hilbert ] ) when each of the sets @xmath41 is a singleton @xmath51 , i.e. , a set containing the single element @xmath52 , and consequently @xmath53 .",
    "for a degenerate observable we can not anymore associate one - dimensional eigenspaces to the distinguishable eigenvalues .",
    "accordingly , measurements will now produce state transitions of the form @xmath54 , @xmath55 , where : @xmath56 according to the born rule , for @xmath55 , we have the transition probabilities : @xmath57 and of course @xmath58 + _ compound systems _ + to illustrate the importance of the above distinction between degenerate and non - degenerate observables , we describe the important case of compound systems , consisting in more than a single entity .",
    "for sake of simplicity , we limit our discussion to the case of a compound system made of only two entities , which can only be in two different states . typically , a physicist will consider two spin-@xmath59 entities , like two electrons , whereas a psychologist studying concepts will consider the combinations of two concepts , allowing for each of them only two possible exemplars .",
    "then , the hilbert space is the @xmath60-dimensional complex space @xmath61 , and since there are two entities , it can also be described as the tensor product @xmath62 , where the first @xmath63-dimensional hilbert space @xmath64 is associated with the first entity ( indicated by the index @xmath32 in the following ) , and the second identical hilbert space is associated with the second entity ( indicated by the index @xmath63 ) .",
    "a product observable @xmath13 can then be written as the tensor product @xmath65 , where @xmath66 acts on the first entity and @xmath67 acts on the second one .",
    "more specifically , @xmath68 corresponds to the coincident measurement of @xmath66 on the first entity and @xmath67 on the second one . this can be also expressed by writing @xmath13 as the ordinary product of two commuting observables : @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the observable acting on the first entity via @xmath66 , but doing nothing to the second entity , whereas @xmath71 does nothing to the first entity , but acts on the second one via @xmath67 . in other terms , @xmath70 corresponds to an observation only on the first entity , whereas @xmath71 to an observation only on the second one , and their product corresponds to a coincident observation on the entity which is a compound of both entities .",
    "let us show that @xmath65 has a non - degenerate spectrum of eigenvalues , whereas @xmath70 and @xmath71 have doubly degenerate eigenvalues .",
    "for this , we introduce in @xmath72 the four ( tensor product ) base vectors @xmath73 , @xmath74 , where @xmath75 , @xmath76 , are the two eigenvectors of @xmath66 , with non - degenerate eigenvalues @xmath77 , @xmath76 , and @xmath78 , @xmath79 , are the two eigenvectors of @xmath67 , with non - degenerate eigenvalue @xmath80 , @xmath79 . clearly , @xmath81 , that is , the @xmath82 are the eigenvectors of @xmath13 , associated with the four eigenvalues @xmath83 , @xmath84 , which are all distinct , and so @xmath13 is non - degenerate .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath85 , that is , the @xmath82 are also eigenvectors of @xmath70 , but this time both @xmath86 and @xmath87 are associated with the same eigenvalue @xmath77 , which therefore is doubly degenerate , for each @xmath76 .",
    "and of course , the same holds true for @xmath71 .    in general",
    ", a state @xmath8 of the two - entity system can be written in the above eigen - basis as the superposition : latexmath:[\\ ] ] which is clearly a violation of ( [ setequalities6 ] ) .",
    "note that , for simplicity , we have here constructed a counter example only using probabilities of sequential measurements , interpreted as joint probabilities .",
    "an alternative _ ex absurdum _ proof , using instead conditional probabilities , can also be constructed , considering a situation where there is an additional lack of knowledge about the state of the particle , described by a uniform probability distribution .",
    "then , choosing again three suitable measurements , one can show that bayes rule for conditional probabilities is violated .",
    "the calculation of conditional probabilities , with an additional mixture of states , is however much more involved , and for the proof we refer the interested reader to @xcite and @xcite .",
    "+   + _ the probability model is non - quantum _ + let us now show that the probabilities of sequential measurements can not be fitted into a quantum probability model .",
    "we denote by @xmath388 and @xmath389 the two orthonormal eigenstates associated with the two outcomes of measurement @xmath342 , respectively .",
    "similarly , we denote by @xmath390 and @xmath391 those associated with measurement @xmath360 , and by @xmath392 and @xmath393 those associated with @xmath361 .",
    "according to the standard quantum formalism , if the initial state of the system is @xmath392 , we can write : @xmath394 where for ( [ setequalities9 ] ) we have used @xmath395 , and for ( [ setequalities10 ] ) we have used ( [ setequalities8 ] ) and @xmath396 .",
    "clearly , ( [ setequalities8 ] ) implies that @xmath397 , ( [ setequalities9 ] ) that @xmath398 , and ( [ setequalities10 ] ) that @xmath399 . therefore : @xmath400 which is clearly a contradiction , showing that there does not exist a two - dimensional hilbert space model such that the above sequential transition probabilities can be described in this hilbert space .",
    "it is not difficult to analyze the above three measurements also for values @xmath401 $ ] , and show that ( [ setequalities7 ] ) continues to hold , which means that for all values @xmath274 $ ] , the @xmath1-model is non - kolmogorovian . using accardi - fedullo inequalities @xcite ,",
    "it is also possible to show that in general no hilbert space model exists , except for the uniform @xmath402 case @xcite .",
    "it follows from the above analysis that when non - uniform probability densities and different measurements are considered ( i.e. , different simplexes ) , the overall probability model will be in general non - hilbertian and non - kolmogorovian , with the hilbertian structure corresponding only to the special case of a uniform probability density @xmath2 .",
    "of course , each single measurement can be described within a single kolmogorovian probability space ( in accordance with the fact that the utr - model is a universal single - measurement probabilistic machine ) , but when different measurements are considered , the overall probability model will in general be non - kolmogorovian and non - hilbertian .",
    "indeed , the actual structure of the model depends on the specific choice of the @xmath262 describing how the elastic structures break ( and on the structure of the set of states which are mapped to points on the simplexes ) , and this means that the gtr - model constitutes a truly more general theoretical framework , able to extend its `` structural reach '' far beyond that of the utr - model and hilbert - model .",
    "but the above sphere - model example also shows that , although non - uniform @xmath262 can give rise to non - hilbertian probability models , as soon as universal measurements are considered , i.e. , averages over all possible probability densities @xmath262 are taken , being that these averages will give back an effective condition of uniform fluctuation , the hilbertian structure for the set of states can also possibly be recovered .",
    "a last remark is in order .",
    "although in our model all the probabilities are calculated within a lebesgue measure context , it would not be correct to think of it in classical terms ( for instance as a markov chain ) , when used to describe sequential measurements .",
    "let us note in this regard that in a markov chain , and more generally in a classical stochastic process , all the random variables are defined with respect to a same probability space , and in particular to a same @xmath368-algebra of events .",
    "on the other hand , the transition probabilities arising from the application in sequence of the utr - model ( or more generally of the gtr - model ) , can not be fit into a single algebra of events , even though the individual probabilities are calculated , in each single measurement , by means of a classical lebesgue measure .",
    "the reason for this is that in our model each measurement brings its own specific input of randomness , in a way that makes the different measurements mutually incompatible , which is not the case for a classical stochastic process , where all the randomness comes from a lack of knowledge about the state of the considered entity .",
    "+   + _ the general @xmath12-outcome situation _ + the previous analysis is only valid for the two - outcome ( qubit ) situation ( @xmath112 ) . therefore , one might ask if the corollary we have enunciated in the previous section , expressing the equivalence between universal measurements and quantum measurements ( as described by the born rule ) , when the structure of the set of states is hilbertian , also applies in general , or is just a two - dimensional anomaly .",
    "indeed , a full `` membrane modelization '' of the quantum measurement process was only provided in the two - outcome situation , by means of the sphere - model , while for a general @xmath12-outcome situation we have only provided a description of the `` naked '' part of the measurement process .",
    "the following question therefore arises : is it possible to provide a complete description of a quantum measurement ( also valid for degenerate observables ) , in the case of a general finite - dimensional hilbert space ?",
    "undoubtedly , only if such a description can be obtained we can affirm that the utr probability model , when the state space is hilbertian , becomes perfectly equivalent to the probability model generated ( within the same state space ) by the born rule , and this not only for single measurements , but also for arbitrary sequential measurements , in accordance with the projection postulate . to put the same question in different terms :",
    "is it possible to generalize the sphere - model for a quantum entity having an arbitrary number @xmath12 of dimensions ? also , can we inscribe and orient , within a suitable geometric structure , the different @xmath183-simplexes associated with all possible observables , and specify in this ambit the nature of the deterministic map @xmath319 that , to each state in @xmath403 , associates a specific point on the @xmath183-simplex describing the measurement under consideration , in a way that systematically works for any possible choice of measurement ( that is , for any possible choice of physical observable ) ?    when this article , and its companion @xcite , were submitted for publication",
    ", this question was still an open one .",
    "however , very recently we succeeded in fully determining the map @xmath319 , and the mathematical structure that naturally contains all the possible measurement simplexes associated with a @xmath12-dimensional quantum entity , thus obtaining a general hidden - measurements solution to the quantum measurement problem , for general @xmath12-outcome experiments @xcite .",
    "let us just briefly mention here that for more than two outcomes , the three - dimensional bloch - sphere representation is replaced by a @xmath404-dimensional generalized bloch - sphere representation , but only a convex portion of such generalized sphere can be filled with states .",
    "however , similarly to the two - dimensional situation , the map @xmath319 still describes a point particle `` orthogonally falling '' onto the measurement simplex .",
    "when the measurement is degenerate , the process is a little more articulated , in the sense that there is not only a deterministic process through which the point particle enters into contact with the membrane , but also a possible final deterministic movement , following the membrane s collapse , bringing the point particle back to a maximum distance from the center of the simplex , in accordance with lders - von neumann projection formula .",
    "this hidden - measurements description of a general quantum measurement is quite involved mathematically speaking , as it uses the properties of the generators of the group @xmath405 , the special unitary group of degree @xmath12 , and the representation of quantum states as density operators .",
    "therefore , we refer the interested reader to @xcite , for the mathematical details .",
    "as regards the present analysis , what is important to keep in mind is that a more general description exists , so that the equivalence between the utr - model and the born rule , as expressed in the corollary of sec .",
    "[ non - uniform ] , has a very general validity .",
    "to conclude , we briefly summarize the results we have presented in this article .",
    "we have introduced an abstract model  the utr - model  which like the hilbert - model of quantum mechanics is able to describe all possible probabilities in a given single measurement context .",
    "we have also shown that the utr - model admits a simple physical realization , in which measurements are described as actions performed on a point particle by means of special , uniformly breakable elastic hypermembranes .",
    "these hypermembranes can also be understood as the exemplification of psychological processes during which a human subject reduces the tension of a mental state of equilibrium , between different competing alternatives , by means of a random perturbation , breaking in this way the symmetry of the equilibrium and bringing the system into a more stable and less tensional condition .",
    "the utr - model illustrates in a detailed way what possibly happens during a measurement , when the initial state in which the entity is prepared collapses into a final state , showing that the process can be understood in terms of an actualization of hidden potential interactions , which ( almost ) deterministically bring the entity into its final state .",
    "we have also shown that a symmetrical interpretation is also possible , where the potentiality is the result of a uniform mixture of state , instead of a uniform mixture of pure measurements .    despite the already great generality of the utr - model",
    ", we have motivated the introduction of an even more general model , that we have called the gtr - model , which employs non uniform hypermembranes ( non - uniform probability densities ) , describing all possible kinds of quantum and quantum - like measurements , including the pure deterministic and pure solipsistic ones .    in the much ampler structural ambit of the gtr - model",
    ", we have then considered the possibility of performing uniform averages over all possible choices of non - uniform probability densities @xmath262 , i.e. , averages over all possible probability models which can in principle be actualized in a given experimental context .",
    "this uniform average is what we have called a _",
    "universal measurement _ ,",
    "to which we have given a mathematically precise and physically transparent definition , as the limit of an average over finite structures , so bypassing ( i.e. , solving ) the well known difficulties of so - called bertrand paradox @xcite    a universal measurement corresponds to the situation were not only there is lack of knowledge about which specific hidden interaction is actualized during the measurement , but also about the way this interaction is selected .",
    "this means that a universal measurement corresponds to a situation of maximum possible lack of knowledge , involving a double level of randomization : one related to the choice of the measurement itself , and one related to the actualization of the hidden deterministic interaction within that chosen measurement .",
    "the result we have outlined  which we will prove in @xcite  is that the `` huge '' randomization of a universal measurement produces exactly the same numerical values for the transition probabilities as those delivered by a uniform probability density , i.e. , by the lebesgue measure on the simplexes ; and since the latter is compatible with the born rule , this also means that quantum measurements can actually be understood as universal measurements , thus adding an important piece of explanation regarding the effectiveness of the quantum model in so many different ambits , such as that of human cognition and decision .",
    "these results are significant for cognitive science , considering that the hypothesis of the conceptual - mental layer of individual subjects participating in experiments to contain deep variations is a plausible one .",
    "hence , our analysis indicates that it may be possible that more careful and numerous cognitive experiments would reveal that the average which is at play is not as huge and systematic as the quantum mechanical average , so that the statistics of outcomes may actually deviate from that predicted by an effective uniform @xmath2 , and therefore also from the born rule .",
    "this possible deviation , however , can only be evidenced when considering experimental situations involving more than a single measurement ( sequential measurements ) , as we have shown in sec .",
    "[ nonhilbert ] .",
    "more specifically , in the special case of two - outcome measurements , and in the ambit of the so - called sphere - model ( see @xcite for its recent @xmath12-dimensional generalization ) , which takes into consideration the full geometry of the hilbert state space , we have shown that the gtr - model is a much more general framework than the utr - model , in the sense that it can generate probabilities that can not fit into a kolmogorovian or hilbertian model .",
    "this means that universal measurements , when considered from the viewpoint of sequential measurements , are not only averages over different probability values , but also averages over different probability models .    in any case , even if the effective uniform @xmath2 , i.e. , the `` lebesgue rule '' on the simplexes ( which becomes exactly the born rule when the structure of the set of states is hilbertian ) will prove in the future not to always be the good rule to apply to infer the statistics of outcomes of cognitive experiments , or other experiments in other regions of reality , it follows from the present analysis that , in the absence of a specific knowledge about how an experiment is specifically conducted , it certainly constitutes the best possible prediction , as it corresponds to a ` first order non - classical theory , ' expressing a condition of maximum lack of knowledge and control .",
    "let us conclude by saying that the results presented in this article , which will be further explored in its second part @xcite , are of special interest also for physics .",
    "our results contain a potential deep explanation for what happens during a quantum measurement in micro - physics , and further more refined experiments might explore this explanation .",
    "indeed , if this explanation is correct , the fact that quantum mechanics describes a statistics of outcomes that goes along with a uniform at - random choice between any arbitrary type of manipulation that changes an initial state of the entity under study into a final state , in a way that we do nt know anything about the mechanism of this change of state , reveals then , that the micro - layer of our physical reality is characterizable by a much deeper level of potentiality than was initially expected . in the sense that , apparently , all possible measurements are also equipossible measurements , which are in principle actualizable and actualized in the laboratory .",
    "if we have not realized this so far , it could be because these measurements remain hidden , and their different individual statistics of outcomes are fused together , in a unique statistics , equivalent to that delivered by the born rule .",
    "+   + * acknowledgements * we are grateful to the anonymous referees for their numerous insightful comments , which have contributed in considerably improving the presentation of our work .",
    "we are also grateful to jerome busemeyer , for his careful reading of the manuscript and for highlighting the psychological mechanism which is inherent in our membrane models , as well as for having suggested a particularly apt name for them .",
    "to calculate the probability ( [ transitionprobabilitiesnondeg ] ) we follow here the derivation in @xcite .",
    "we observe that the lebesgue measure of @xmath184 is @xmath406 ( for @xmath112 , it corresponds to the length @xmath161 of the line segment @xmath117 , for @xmath113 , to the area @xmath162 of the equilateral triangle @xmath149 , for @xmath407 , to the volume @xmath408 of the regular tetrahedron @xmath213 , and so on ) .",
    "therefore , ( [ transitionprobabilitiesnondeg ] ) becomes : @xmath409 to calculate @xmath131 , we can use the generalization , for a convex hull , of the well - known formula for the computation of the area of a triangle , as the product of the length of its base times its height , times @xmath59 , which in the case of the @xmath183-dimensional convex hull @xmath129 becomes : @xmath410 where @xmath411 is the @xmath412-dimensional simplex generated by the @xmath192 orthonormal vectors @xmath413 , and @xmath414 is the smallest euclidean distance between @xmath126 and @xmath411 . to calculate @xmath414 , we observe that any point of @xmath411 can be written as @xmath415 , with @xmath416 , so that the vector @xmath417 , on the line connecting @xmath126 and @xmath418 , is given by : @xmath419 to find the @xmath418 for which the distance @xmath420 is minimal , i.e. , for which @xmath421 , we observe that for such vector @xmath417 must be orthogonal to all vectors of the form @xmath422 , with @xmath423 , that is , @xmath424 , for all @xmath423 .",

    "<S> we introduce a model which allows to represent the probabilities associated with an arbitrary measurement situation as it appears in different domains of science  from cognitive science to physics  and use it to explain the emergence of quantum probabilities ( the born rule ) as _ uniform _ fluctuations on this measurement situation . </S>",
    "<S> the model exploits the geometry of simplexes to represent the states both of the system and the measuring apparatus , in a way that the measurement probabilities can be derived as the lebesgue measure of suitably defined convex subregions of the simplex under consideration . </S>",
    "<S> although the model we propose , which we call the _ uniform tension - reduction _ ( utr ) model , is an abstract construct , it admits physical realizations . in this article </S>",
    "<S> we consider a very simple and evocative one , using a material point particle which is acted upon by special elastic membranes , which by breaking and collapsing are able to `` release the tension '' and produce the different possible outcomes . </S>",
    "<S> this easy to visualize mechanical realization allows one to gain considerable insight into the possible hidden structure of a measurement process , be it from a measurement associated with a situation in cognitive science or in physics , or in any other domain . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that the utr - model can be further generalized into a model describing conditions of lack of knowledge generated by _ non - uniform _ fluctuations , which we call the _ general tension - reduction _ ( gtr ) model . in this more general framework , </S>",
    "<S> which is more suitable to describe typical experiments in cognitive science , we define and motivate a notion of _ universal measurement _ , describing the most general possible condition of lack of knowledge in a measurement , emphasizing that the uniform fluctuations characterizing quantum measurements can also be understood as an average over all possible forms of non - uniform fluctuations which can be actualized in a measurement context . </S>",
    "<S> this means that the born rule of quantum mechanics can be understood as a first order approximation of a more general non - uniform theory , thus explaining part of the great success of quantum probability in the description of different domains of reality . and </S>",
    "<S> more specifically , also providing a possible explanation for the success of quantum cognition , a research field in cognitive science employing the quantum formalism as a modeling tool . </S>",
    "<S> this is the first part of a two - part article . in the second part @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , the proof of the equivalence between universal measurements and uniform measurements , and its significance for quantum theory as a first order approximation , is given and further analyzed .    </S>",
