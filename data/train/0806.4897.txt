    "noise is typically a huge inconvenience when trying to control the state of a quantum system , since it causes dissipation and decoherence .",
    "however one can ask if noise could be used to coherently control the quantum system in a manner that can not be achieve using traditional hamiltonian manipulation .    in this context",
    "we consider the berry phase @xcite ; a geometric phase associated with adiabatic evolution . when one rotates the parameters in a system s hamiltonian around a closed loop slowly enough that an eigenstate adiabatically follows the change , then that state acquires a berry phase , @xmath0 .",
    "this phase depends on the geometry of the parameters path but not on how that path is followed . for a spin - half in a slowly rotated magnetic field , @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the solid - angle enclosed by the field and @xmath3 is the quantum number of the spin along the field axis .",
    "berry phases occur in many quantum systems @xcite , they were recently observed in superconducting qubits @xcite , and their noise - dependence has been investigated using cold - neutrons @xcite .",
    "they have potential applications in both quantum computation @xcite and metrology @xcite , because it is argued that one of the most accurate ways to change the phase of a state is to rotate the hamiltonian s parameters round a loop which encloses a given solid angle .",

    ", the berry phase is given by the solid - angle enclosed by @xmath4 .",
    ", width=294 ]    however there is a practical problem with observing the berry phase ; one does not observe it `` alone '' .",
    "if the parameters of a system s hamiltonian complete a closed loop in a time @xmath6 , then the total phase acquired by an eigenstate is @xcite @xmath7 where the dynamic phase @xmath8 , the berry phase @xmath9 , and the non - adiabatic ( na ) correction @xmath10 , with @xmath11 being a system energy scale @xcite ( such as the gap to excitations ) . as the second term in the @xmath12-expansion of @xmath13 , the berry phase is difficult to isolate , and thus hard to utilize for quantum computation or metrology .",
    "one must make @xmath6 large to suppress the non - adiabatic terms .",
    "this makes @xmath14 , so one must subtract off @xmath15 ( using a spin - echo trick @xcite or degenerate states @xcite ) with extreme accuracy . concretely ,",
    "if one wants @xmath0 to an accuracy of one in @xmath16 , one requires @xmath17 .",

    "must be long , any device is slow to operate and leaves lots of time for decoherence to destroy the phase .    in this work ,",
    "we analyze a system coupled ( via a term @xmath20 in the hamiltonian ) to a highly non - markovian environment with @xmath21 modes ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : qm+cl]a ) .",
    "such environments are known to strongly renormalize the system dynamics ; inducing a type of anderson orthogonality catastrophe @xcite , as shown by leggett _",

    "crucially , it is much easier to accurately observe the berry phase in a situation where @xmath13 is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : new - total - phase ] ) in place of eq .",
    "( [ eq : usual - total - phase ] ) .",
    "there is no dynamic phase to subtract off , and the leading non - adiabatic phase is absent .",
    "if we again assume we want to get the berry phase with a accuracy of one in @xmath16 , then we require that @xmath24 , which simply means that @xmath25 ( where @xmath26 is the energy scale in @xmath27 ) .",
    "this is a vastly less difficult to achieve than the conditions discussed above for a conventional berry phase .",
    "we note that there is another geometric phase  the aharonov - anandan phase  @xcite  which has no non - adiabatic corrections .",
    "thus one may expect that one can use it to avoid the above problems with non - adiabatic phases .",
    "however the aharonov - anandan phase has different properties from the berry phase , which make it more difficult to calculate in many experimental situations .",
    "we reserve discussion of this difficulty to appendix  [ append : aa ] , and here consider only the berry phase .",
    "the effects that we discuss above for a quantum environment , are equally relevent for a system coupled to classical noise .",
    "classical noise is known to be equivalent to a high - temperature environment of harmonic oscillators @xcite .",
    "we use this equivalence to show that driving a system with highly non - markovian noise ( such as strong high - frequency noise ) whose axis is slowly rotated ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : qm+cl]b ) causes instantaneous eigenstates to acquire a phase given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : new - total - phase ] ) .    for either model ( quantum environment or classical noise ) , there will be some dephasing of the system state , however it originates from the non - adiabatic rotation of the coupling axis .",
    "thus if the rotation is performed in a time @xmath6 , the dephasing goes like @xmath28 $ ] so the longer the experiment the _ less _ the dephasing . for all @xmath29 ,",
    "the dephasing is weak - enough to clearly measure the phase .",
    "thus there is no need to work in a decoherence - free subspace to observe this environment - induced berry phase ( unlike that in ref .",
    "[ ] which we discuss in section  [ sect : prior - works ] below ) .",
    "the only difference between a low - temperature quantum environment and classical noise is in this dephasing . for low - temperature quantum environments ,",
    "@xmath30 grows exponentially with the strength of the environment coupling , while for classical noise , @xmath30 goes like the squareroot of the noise power .",
    "thus for strong coupling to a quantum environment one can easily be in a situation where the @xmath31 is irrelevant , then it turns out that the leading contribution to dephasing goes like @xmath32 ( where we believe that @xmath33 is not exponentially suppressed ) , so it scales to zero much faster with increasing @xmath6 than for classical noise .",
    "however we emphasize that the dephasing is already weak for classical - noise , so this fact that it is much weaker for a low - temperature quantum environment is not central message of the work we present here . for all practical purposes , in the context of the problems we consider here , classical noise and quantum environments induce the same effects .",
    "we consider a spin - half coupled to an environment via a coupling axis , @xmath4 , which is rotated around a closed loop ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : qm+cl]a ) .",
    "the total hamiltonian for the system ( sys ) and its environment ( env ) is    [ eq : h ] @xmath34    with @xmath35 being the vector of pauli matrices .",
    "the unit vector @xmath4 is slowly rotated around a closed loop .",
    "the operators @xmath36 and @xmath37 , create and destroy the @xmath38th excitation of the environment , where @xmath39 is such that the @xmath38th excitation has energy @xmath40 . note that this is a model of a degenerate two - level system coupled to an environment , because we require that the two - level system s hamiltonian is zero if one takes @xmath41 ( we relax this requirement in section  [ sect : level - splitting ] ) .",
    "we assume that the environment has a spectrum such that it is highly _ non - markovian _ ; by which we mean that the environment has a significant effect on the system s dynamics on a timescale much less than the environment s memory time , @xmath42 . this memory time",

    "we say that any zero temperature environment is highly non - markovian when the dimensionless environment - coupling parameter @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the average frequency of the environment ; defined by @xmath48 .",
    "for an environment of harmonic oscillators this can be generalized to arbitrary environment temperature , @xmath49 ; such an environment is highly non - markovian if @xmath50   \\ \\gg\\ 1,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath51 .",
    "we have in mind an environment containing so many modes with different frequencies that the sum can be written as an integral as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : def - amp ] ) .    to get a feeling for such an environment ,",
    "it is worth considering an environment at zero temperature with @xmath21 modes each coupled to the system with a strength @xmath52 , and with frequencies spread around an average of @xmath47 . for simplicity",
    "we assume that the spread of frequencies is also of order @xmath47 , in such a case @xmath53 .",
    "one can then see that @xmath54 corresponds to an approximately markovian environment by looking at the derivation of the bloch - redfield master equation @xcite which has a markovian form ( see for example ref .  ) .",
    "there the memory time @xmath55 , while the rate at which the environment affects the system s dynamics is @xmath56 .",
    "the bloch - redfield approximation is then applicable when @xmath57 ; then spin relaxation and dephasing times ( known as @xmath58 and @xmath59 respectively ) are of order @xmath60 so @xmath61 .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath54 .",
    "in contrast the lindblad equation master equation @xcite is only applicable when @xmath62 ( strictly markovian environment ) with @xmath63 scaled so that @xmath64 remains finite .",
    "this therefore corresponds to @xmath65 .    in this work",
    "we consider exactly the opposite limit , @xmath66 .",
    "one might guess that this corresponds to dephasing so strong that it occurs in a time shorter than the environment memory time .",
    "however in this regime relaxation and dephasing rates are not given by the above @xmath64 .",
    "instead there is extremely strong renormalization of the system s dynamics with relatively weak relaxation and dephasing .",
    "most works on systems coupled to environments have considered that the environment is made up of harmonic oscillators .",
    "we do the same here , treating @xmath67 ( up to an irrelevant constant that we neglect ) .",
    "this enables us get closed form expression for finite temperatures without too much difficulty .",
    "however , we emphasis that the low temperature limit of our results are applicable to any large environment , for example an environment made of two - level systems .    to see why this is so , consider any large environment which is initially in its ground - state .",
    "the analysis that follows in this article assumes that the system only weakly interacts with _ each _ degree - of - freedom in the environment , the effect of the environment on the system is none the less strong because there are so many degrees - of - freedom in the environment .",
    "thus the interaction with each environment degree - of - freedom can be treated to lowest order .",
    "this means that the interaction can only take environment mode @xmath38 from its ground state to its first excited state . in this case",
    "the only property of environment mode @xmath38 that is relevant to the system s evolution is the gap between its ground state and its first excited state , which we define as @xmath40 .",
    "thus , for temperatures such that @xmath68 for the vast majority of @xmath38 , the nature of environment modes is strictly irrelevant , ; they could be harmonic oscillators ( with an infinite ladder of equally spaced excited states ) , spin - halves ( with no states beyond the first excited state ) , or any other quantum systems .",
    "thus one can expect that the @xmath69 limit of all results in this article will apply to arbitrary environments , while the results for arbitrary @xmath70 only apply to an environment of harmonic oscillators .",
    "one can map the dynamics of a system coupled to an environment of quantum oscillators at infinite temperatures onto the ensemble - averaged dynamics of a system coupled to classical noise @xcite .",
    "thus we also analyze the problem of a spin subject to classical noise ( with @xmath21 components ) when the noise axis is rotated ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : qm+cl]b ) . in section  [",
    "sect : classical ] , we discuss what happens to a spin whose hamiltonian is given by @xmath71 when the unit vector @xmath4 is slowly rotated around a closed loop , and @xmath72 are random .",
    "the amplitude @xmath73 is gaussianly distributed with variance @xmath74 , and @xmath75 is uniformly distributed over all angles from @xmath76 to @xmath77 .    the mapping from the quantum environment to classical noise tells us that the average system dynamics under @xmath78 is given by taking the infinite temperature limit ( @xmath79 ) of the system s dynamics under @xmath80 when the environment consists of harmonic oscillators and @xmath81 is replaced by @xmath82 .",
    "thus for such classical noise we can define the noise - coupling parameter @xmath83 here , we consider only highly non - markovian classical noise for which @xmath66 .",
    "when one performs a berry phase experiment on a system ( rotating its hamiltonian around a closed path ) , one can rarely ignore the coupling to an environment ( or noise ) . despite hints to the contrary @xcite",
    ", noise - induced fluctuations of @xmath15 typically lead to a dephasing time , @xmath59 , on which all phase information ( including the berry phase ) is lost @xcite ( here we do not consider the intriguing use of repeatable noise in ref .  [ ] ) .",
    "thus a berry phase can only be observed if one is able to adiabatically rotate the hamiltonian around a closed loop in a time @xmath84 .",
    "usually this requires @xmath85 , where @xmath11 is the energy gap to system excitations @xcite .",
    "the environment also modifies the berry phase @xcite ; the modification is geometric ( quadrupole - like ) and complex @xcite ( see also [ ] ) , with its imaginary part being geometric dephasing .",
    "[ ] made the remarkable observation that a time - dependence in the coupling to an environment could also _ generate _ a berry phase ( see also [ ] ) .",
    "dissipative processes ( at a rate @xmath86 ) cause the system state to adiabatically follow the time - dependence of the system - environment coupling , thereby acquiring a berry phase . in ref  [ ] , unlike in our eq .",
    "( [ eq : new - total - phase ] ) , there are non - adiabatic corrections of the form @xmath87 for all integer @xmath88 . to avoid the non - adiabatic effects",
    ", one requires that @xmath89 , which means that dephasing occurs long before the rotation is completed .",
    "thus this berry phase can only be observed for states in a decoherence - free subspace @xcite .",
    "all the works listed above considered berry phases in systems coupled to environments or classical noise that were strictly or approximately markovian . in contrast , in this article we consider a highly non - markovian environment , which strongly renormalizes the system dynamics without causing significant dissipation . the adiabatic evolution is ensured by this renormalization ( not dissipation ) , and it leads to eq .",
    "( [ eq : new - total - phase ] ) .",
    "the relative lack of dissipation means that there is no need to use a decoherence - free subspace .",
    "neither the lindblad nor bloch - redfield methods , used to study berry phases in refs .",
    "[ ] and ref .",
    "[ ] respectively , can capture the strong renormalization that occurs for @xmath66 .",
    "the lindblad master equation applies for @xmath65 , while the bloch - redfield master method applies for @xmath54 , which corresponds to only a very small linear renormalization effect .",
    "we conclude by mentioning a number of works in chemical physics .",
    "berry phases occur in molecular dynamics because there is a separation of timescales ; the nuclei are heavy and move slowly , while the electrons are light and move fast .",
    "this makes it natural to perform a born - oppenheimer decoupling of the fast and slow degrees - of - freedom .",
    "it is well - known that such a de - coupling can lead to a berry phase , see for example refs .",
    "there are also non - adiabatic corrections to this berry phase which come from violations of the born - oppenheimer decoupling .",
    "these have been well studied ; for an older review see ref .  [ ] and references therein , for more recent work see ref .  [ ] .",
    "however all the works that we are aware of , consider only a relatively small number of degrees - of - freedom ( for example a tri - atomic molecule , containing three slow nuclear degrees of freedom and up to three fast electron degrees - of - freedom ) . in this article , we also go beyond the born - oppenheimer approximation to find the non - adiabatic corrections to the berry phase .",
    "however we are interested in a two - level system ( qubit ) which is very weakly coupled to each of an enormous number of environment modes ( or classical noise modes ) , such that the combined effect of all these modes on the system dynamics is very strong .",
    "this is the opposite limit from that considered in the works on molecular dynamics .",
    "here we avoid using the _",
    "adiabatic renormalization _ method of leggett _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "instead we perform an exact `` polaron '' transformation on the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hrot ] ) , which fits with the spirit of adiabatic renormalization , while being a much more controlled approximation@xcite .",
    "this elegant approach is standard for polarons @xcite , and was first applied to the spin - boson model in a number of papers @xcite , some of which are much neglected . refs .  [ ] showed that the _ non - interacting blip approximation _",
    "@xcite is given by a simple weak - coupling analysis of the transformed hamiltonian .",
    "elsewhere , we will present a detailed review of this approach and discuss its regime of validity ( greatly over - estimated in ref .  [ ] ) ; here we simply note the remarkable conclusion that the polaron transformation can map a spin coupled to a highly non - markovian environment onto a spin coupled to a almost markovian environment .",
    "the latter can then be treated with a bloch - redfield master equation .      to deal with a problem in which the axis the environment couples to is rotating with time ( as sketched in fig .  [",
    "fig : qm+cl ] ) , we go to a rotating basis @xcite whose @xmath90-axis remains parallel to @xmath4 .",

    "the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hrot ] ) is a biased spin - boson model ( with the environment coupling to the spin s @xmath90-axis ) and thus we can proceed to treat it via a polaron transformation in a similar manner to refs .

    "initially the spin is aligned along the direction of the coupling axis ( indicated here by @xmath90 ) , the environment modes are all shifted slightly to the right by the interaction with the spin ; here we only show the @xmath38th mode which is in the shifted ground - state labelled @xmath102 ( the dashed - line indicates the equivalent unshifted state ) .",
    "we then show two possible spin - flip processes .",

    ", width=283 ]    the physics behind the polaron transformation is the idea that _ fast _ environment modes tend to adiabatically follow the _ slow _ system modes , so they can be thought of as a `` cloud '' around the system , renormalizing its dynamics .",
    "so we go to the basis of this `` cloud '' , by writing @xmath105 in terms of a new ( orthonormal ) set of basis - states in which environment modes are shifted due to the force induced by the spin being @xmath106 or @xmath107 . a cartoon of this ( for a single environment mode )",
    "is shown in fig .",

    "similarly @xmath112 is the @xmath110th eigenstate of @xmath113 , given by @xmath114 with @xmath115 .",
    "we assume that each environment mode is only weakly affected by the system , @xmath116 , then the difference between @xmath109 and @xmath112 is small . defining @xmath117 ,",
    "one finds , @xmath118 where @xmath119 . the higher the level , @xmath120 , of the initial state of the @xmath38th environment mode , the smaller this overlap is .",
    "while this overlap is very close to one , the fact that it is slightly less than one can have a huge effect on the system , because there are many such overlaps .",
    "each time the spin - flips it must carry the `` cloud '' of environment modes with it , as a result the spin - flip rate is multiplied by the product over all @xmath38 of the above overlaps ; this product of @xmath21 overlaps  each of which is slightly less than one  will decay exponentially with @xmath21 .",
    "thus for large @xmath21 , the @xmath21-particle environment state after the spin - flip will be almost orthogonal to the @xmath21-particle environment state before the spin - flip .",
    "this means that the matrix element for spin - flips is suppressed ( becoming exponentially small in @xmath21 ) .",
    "such a suppression is often called the anderson orthogonality catastrophe @xcite , since he pointed out that it can strongly suppress the tunnelling of an electron between two metals electrode @xcite .",

    "the first is that it appears that adding coupling to an environment ( of the right type ) may make it _ easier _ to accurately measure berry phases , when naively one would say an environment always suppresses such phase information .",
    "the second is that even _",
    "classical _ non - markovian noise induces the strong renormalization of spin dynamics necessary to generate a berry phase ; even though such renormalization is based on the intrinsically _ quantum _ effect of vanishing overlaps between environment states .",
    "this means that the classical limit of this quantum effect , must correspond to a classical effect .",
    "unfortunately the nature of the calculation in this article ( a formal mapping from the quantum problem to the classical one ) does not help us understand this classical effect . in future work",
    "we plan to study the classical problem directly , and find a simple picture of the classical effect that plays a role analogous to the @xmath254 limit of the orthogonality catastrophe .    finally , we recall that our results for a quantum environment are valid for arbitrary temperatures if the environment is made up of harmonic oscillators . however , as discussed in section  [ sect : beyond - oscillators ] , the low temperature limit of these results apply for an arbitrary environment ( a bath of two - level systems , etc ) .",
    "my thanks go to r.  leone and l.  lvy for inspiring this work , to m.  berry and p.  bruno for insights into geometric phases , to s.  florens for insights into spin - bosons models and adiabatic renormalization , and to r.  englman for insights that led me to the polaron literature .",
    "finally , i thank t.  ziman for his general advice on rg and his ongoing support throughout this work .",
    "there exists another geometric phase which has no non - adiabatic corrections ; the aharonov - anandan ( aa ) phase @xcite .",
    "thus it is natural to ask why we are working so hard to create a berry phase with suppressed non - adiabatic corrections , when the aa phase already exists .",
    "our response to this question is that the nature of the berry phase makes it much more easier to calculate in most experimental situations than the aa phase .",
    "here we explain what we mean by this .",
    "the berry phase is given by the solid - angle enclosed by the parameters of the hamiltonian , which are directly controlled by the experimenter .",
    "thus for any given time - dependence of those parameters the berry phase can be calculated with simple trigonometry .",
    "in contrast , the aa phase is half the solid - angle enclosed by those quantum states that return to themselves @xcite . while the concept of the aa phase is certainly mathematically beautiful ,",
    "let us consider for a moment the amount of work the experimenters have to do to calculate the aa phase for a given time - dependence of the parameters of hamiltonian .",
    "they must first completely solve the time - dependent schrdinger equation for evolution from time zero to time @xmath6 to find those states which return to themselves .",
    "for an arbitrary time - dependence of the parameters of the hamiltonian , this can not be done analytically , so they must numerically simulate the quantum evolution to find these states . having done this , they must then find the solid - angle enclosed by these states .",
    "this involves recording their behaviour for all time from zero to @xmath6 . for arbitrary time - dependence of the hamiltonian ,",
    "this typically involves re - running the numerical simulation to get the time - dependence of those states .",
    "only then can one use trigonometry to calculate the solid angle enclosed to extract the aa phase .",
    "of course , there are certain simple cases in which the aa phase can be calculated analytically @xcite ; e.g. , spin - half in a field which is static from time zero to time @xmath302 , then instantaneously changes to a new direction , and then remains static for times from @xmath302 to @xmath6 .",
    "however these cases are exceptional .",
    "thus one could say that the noise - generated berry phase , that we present here , fills a gap between the conventional berry phase and the aa phase .",
    "it is as easy to calculate as a conventional berry phase , while having much smaller non - adiabatic corrections .",
    "we label the eigenstates of @xmath303 with @xmath304 , then @xmath305 .",
    "if there were only one bath mode ( the @xmath38th mode ) , then we would insert a resolution of unity of the form @xmath306 to the right and another of the form @xmath307 to the left , giving    @xmath308   \\nonumber \\\\ { } & = & \\hat{\\sigma}'_{x(j ) } \\big [ 1- { \\alpha}_j^2(\\hat{a}_j\\hat{a}_j^\\dagger + \\hat{a}_j^\\dagger\\hat{a}_j)/2 -{\\alpha}_j \\hat{\\sigma}'_{z(j ) } ( \\hat{a}_j^\\dagger-\\hat{a}_j ) + { \\cal o}[{\\alpha}_j^2\\hat{a}_j^{\\dagger 2 } , { \\alpha}_j^2\\hat{a}_j^2,{\\alpha}_j^4 ] \\big ] , \\qquad\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where we define @xmath309 , @xmath310 , and @xmath311    note that we assume that the environment is extremely large , and so the coupling to any given environment mode is tiny enough that we can keep only lowest ( second ) order terms in @xmath312 . since we trace over the environment at the end , terms of @xmath313 $ ] or of @xmath314 $ ] can be neglected , because they can only lead to contributions of @xmath315 $ ] .",
    "there are @xmath21 bath modes , so we insert @xmath21 resolutions of unity on the left and another @xmath21 on the right .",
    "we then define @xmath316 where the second equality ( equating the operators to the usual pauli matrices ) is only valid if we are working in the basis of shifted bath - modes .",
    "following the same logic as for one bath mode , one gets @xmath317",

    "further , the assumption of very large @xmath21 means that @xmath320 remains unchanged during the evolution .",
    "thus we replace @xmath321 by @xmath322 given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : f - any - env ] ) . for an environment of harmonic oscillators at temperature @xmath49 , @xmath323 /(1- \\exp[-\\beta{\\omega}_j])$ ] where @xmath51 , then we get the result below eq .",
    "( [ eq : f - any - env ] ) .",
    "( [ eq : sigma_x - intermediate ] ) is easier to handle if we extract the spin - operators from the product as follows .",
    "we note that all terms with even ( odd ) numbers of @xmath318s , have an even ( odd ) power of @xmath324 .",
    "thus as @xmath325 , terms with even numbers of @xmath318s contain no spin - operator , while terms with odd numbers of @xmath318s contain a single @xmath324 operator .",
    "we separate terms with even and odd numbers of @xmath318s , by noting that all even terms in @xmath326 $ ] are given by @xmath327 + \\prod_j [ 1+x_j]\\big)$ ] , while all odd terms are given by the difference of these two terms .",
    "thus we get @xmath328 where @xmath126 are the hermitian environment operators given in eq .",

    "writing the `` universe '' hamiltonian , @xmath80 , in terms of these results , we arrive at eq .",

    "the born approximation of @xmath149 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : exact - master ] ) is most naturally written with the system and environment operators in the interaction picture , thus we define @xmath329 and @xmath330 . then @xmath331 are given by eq .",

    "we define @xmath336 and @xmath337 in a similar manner with `` even ''",

    "thus for the trace over all @xmath21 environment modes we have @xmath338 = { { \\rm e}}^{-2f}\\big ( \\cosh [ 2f(\\tau)]-1 \\big ) , \\nonumber \\\\ \\label{eq : trace - even - even}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath344 and we recall that @xmath345 . this definition of @xmath346 is such that @xmath347 equals the franck - condon factor , @xmath255 , in eq .",
    "( [ eq : f - any - env ] ) . to get the last line of eq .",
    "( [ eq : trace - even - even ] ) , we note that @xmath348 and hence use the approximation @xmath349 = \\exp \\big[-\\sum_j f_j \\big]$ ] .",
    "we evaluate other traces in the same manner , we need @xmath350 & = & { { \\rm e}}^{-2f}\\sinh [ 2f(\\tau ) ] , \\qquad \\\\ { \\hbox{tr}}_{\\rm env}\\big[\\rho^{\\rm env}_0 { \\cal q}_{\\rm odd}(0 )   { \\cal q}_{\\rm even}(-\\tau)\\big ] & = & 0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "the second result comes from the fact that @xmath154 and @xmath156 respectively cause the transition of an even and odd number of environment modes .",
    "thus their product involves the transition of a odd number of modes , so the trace is zero .    using the definition of the dimensionless @xmath171-function below eq .",

    "( [ eq : chi_n ] ) , with @xmath180 by construction .",
    "this approximation is natural for a non - markovian environment , since it has @xmath66 ( see section  [ sect : hs - qu ] ) , since we can assume that when we integrate over @xmath201 , we do so in a saddle - point approximation .",
    "so long as @xmath353 , the quadratic term in the above exponents ensures that @xmath354 decays to be much less than @xmath355 long before the @xmath356-term becomes relevant ( which is why we were able to drop it from the exponent ) .",
