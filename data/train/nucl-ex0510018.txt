    "anisotropic flow , an anisotropy of the azimuthal distribution of emitted particles in momentum space with respect to the reaction plane , is a sensitive tool to study the early stage of high energy heavy ion collisions at rhic .",
    "it is commonly studied by measuring the fourier harmonics ( @xmath6 ) of this distribution @xcite .",
    "elliptic flow ( @xmath3 ) in au+au collisions is well studied at rhic and is thought to reflect conditions from the early stage of the collision .",
    "it has been reported that anisotropic flow can be reasonably described by the hydrodynamical model up to 2 gev / c @xcite .",
    "hydrodynamics also predict several scaling relations , such as the scaling of @xmath2 , eccentricity scaling and the scaling with system size .",
    "it is crucial to test these scaling relations in order to investigate the properties of the hot and dense matter created at an early stage of the heavy ion collisions .",
    "the data taken by the phenix central arm for au+au and cu+cu collisions at @xmath1 = 200 gev were used in this analysis . the phenix central arm covered half of azimuth , pseudorapidity ( @xmath7 ) from -0.35 to 0.35 and the low transverse momentum ( @xmath4 ) cut off was 0.2 gev / c . identified hadrons are measured by the high resolution time - of - flight ( tof ) and the threshold type aerogel cherenkov counter .",
    "we used the event plane method @xcite for anisotropic flow measurement .",
    "event plane was determined at beam - beam counter ( bbc ) @xcite which covered full azimuth and @xmath8 from 3.0 to 3.9 .",
    "the large rapidity gap between the phenix central arm and bbc ( @xmath9 3 ) reduces the non - flow contribution to the two - particle azimuthal correlations .",
    "figure [ fig : fig1 ] shows the @xmath0 for charged pions and protons with respect to the second harmonic bbc event plane in minimum bias event ( 0 - 93 % centrality ) .     for identified pion ( left ) and proton ( right ) in au+au collision with respect to the second harmonic event plane as a function of @xmath4 .",
    "the error bars are statistical error , and shaded boxes are systematic error .",
    "the dashed curves are 1.5 @xmath11 @xmath12 .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ] -10 mm    the @xmath4 dependence of @xmath0 is very similar to the @xmath3 , that is , proton @xmath0 is smaller than pions in low @xmath4 and in higher @xmath4 the magnitude of proton @xmath0 is same as or larger than pions .",
    "the ratio , @xmath2 , has been found to be scaled with the proportionality constant 1.2 by star collaboration @xcite .",
    "we observe the ratio @xmath2 is scaled by 1.5 but this result is consistent with that of @xcite within systematic uncertainties .",
    "a simple parton coalescence model predicts the ratio @xmath2 for both mesons and baryons as @xcite : @xmath13 where @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are meson , baryon and parton @xmath3 , respectively . if one assume that the following scaling relation @xcite for higher order parton anisotropic flow , @xmath17 , then one get @xmath18 for mesons , @xmath19 for baryons .",
    "these predictions underestimate the experimental results , and this would indicate the @xmath20 is larger than simple parton @xmath21 .",
    "recently , ideal - fluid model suggests that @xmath2 = 0.5 and this should become more and more accurate for higher @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "further study of higher harmonics at rhic would be very interesting to understand properties of the system .",
    "figure [ fig : fig2 ] shows @xmath3 for identified pion and proton measured by aerogel as a function of @xmath4 .",
    "-70 mm    we extended the @xmath4 reach by aerogel counter up to 5 gev / c for identified pion and proton .",
    "pion @xmath3 is quite consistent with the prediction of recombination model @xcite as shown by dashed curves in figure [ fig : fig2 ] .",
    "the proton @xmath3 , however , seems to decrease for @xmath4 = 4 - 5 gev / c and clearly deviates from recombination model .",
    "the mass splitting of @xmath3 at low @xmath4 ( @xmath22 2 gev / c ) are also not described by the recombination model .",
    "the similar trend can also see in tof data .",
    "we still need further study in this @xmath4 and higher with aerogel to investigate the production mechanism of protons .",
    "( @xmath4 ) to integrated @xmath3(@xmath4 ) ) for inclusive charged hadrons in cu+cu and au+au collisions for 0 - 10 % , 10 - 20 % , 20 - 30 % and 30 - 40 % . , width=294 ]    -10 mm    -18 mm    -12 mm    the inclusive charged hadron @xmath3(@xmath4 ) in cu+cu collisions compared to that in au+au are shown in figure [ fig : fig3 ] .",
    "the @xmath4 dependence of @xmath3 in cu+cu is similar to that in au+au and the magnitude of @xmath3 is smaller than in au+au about 15 % in minimum bias event .",
    "one of the parton cascade model , ampt , predicts that the @xmath3 in cu+cu is scaled with the system size linearly so that @xmath3(cu)@xmath5 0.3 @xmath23 @xmath3(au ) @xcite .",
    "however , the data seems to not scale with the system size linearly .",
    "the difference between data and model prediction might be due to non - flow contribution but it is necessary to have more study to understand the system size dependence of @xmath3 .",
    "figure [ fig : fig4 ] shows the scaling of @xmath3 , which is the ratio of differential @xmath3 to integrated one , for charged hadrons in cu+cu and au+au collisions as a function of @xmath4 .",
    "we use the fact that integrated @xmath3 ( @xmath24 ) approximately scales with eccentricity ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "thus the scaling of @xmath3 is approximately equal to @xmath26 .",
    "this scaling has advantages which could reduce the systematic errors related to eccentricity calculation and event plane resolution .",
    "one can see that the scaling of @xmath3 is roughly independent of the system size from central to mid - central collisions .",
    "this would suggest that hydrodynamical regime is reached in central to mid - central cu+cu collisions .",
    "we measure the anisotropic flow for various particle species in au+au and cu+cu collisions at @xmath1 = 200 gev at rhic - phenix experiment . the scaling ratio @xmath2 for both unidentified and identified hadrons are 1.5 and it is consistent with the previous measurement by star experiment .",
    "proton @xmath3 seems to decrease and deviate from recombination model for @xmath4 = 4 - 5 gev / c , while pion @xmath3 has good agreement with recombination model .",
    "the @xmath3 in cu+cu is smaller than that in au+au .",
    "the eccentricity scaling of @xmath3 for cu+cu and au+au is roughly independent of the system size and this suggest that hydro regime is reached in central to mid - central cu+cu collisions at rhic .",
