    "at rhic and the lhc the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) is produced in ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the soft sector of light partons is assumed to achieve local thermal equilibrium within the first tenth of a fm / c and the subsequent evolution of the bulk matter can be described very well by fluid dynamics .",
    "the hard part of the transverse momentum , @xmath1 , spectra and heavy quarks , like charm and bottom , are predominantly produced in the initial hard scatterings of partons in the incoming nuclei .",
    "due to the large mass and the fast expansion heavy quarks are believed to not thermalize fully in the qgp medium and thus carry information about the interaction processes with the constituents of the qgp .",
    "the experimental results of the nuclear modification factor @xmath2 and the elliptic flow @xmath3 @xcite suggest a significant medium modification of the heavy - meson spectra as compared to proton - proton collisions : a high-@xmath1 suppression and a finite @xmath3 comparable in size to that of light hadrons .",
    "the gross features of the in - medium energy loss can be described by elastic scatterings @xcite , gluon bremsstrahlung @xcite or a combination of both .",
    "it remains a challenge to simultaneously describe the @xmath2 and @xmath3 data within numerical simulations , where the heavy - quark propagation is coupled to a fluid dynamical description of the medium @xcite or a parton cascade @xcite .    in order to enhance our understanding of the heavy - flavor dynamics in the qgp",
    "it becomes necessary to study the centrality and mass dependence of heavy - flavor observables and to explore the potential of novel observables , such as azimuthal correlations @xcite and higher - order flow coefficients as proposed in this work .",
    "we first introduce the model mc@shq+epos , which was developed by some of the authors , in section [ sec : model ] .",
    "first results and details of this model can be found in @xcite .",
    "it couples a monte carlo propagation of heavy quarks to the @xmath4 dimensional fluid dynamical evolution of the qgp from epos initial conditions @xcite and reproduces well the measured observables at lhc and rhic as discussed in section [ sec : results ] . with the same parameters we then calculate the triangular flow of @xmath0 mesons in non - central collisions at rhic and the lhc",
    "this model describes the heavy - quark production in heavy - ion collisions via the following three stages : 1 ) initialization of heavy - quark pairs according to the momentum distribution from fonll @xcite and the spatial distribution of the nucleon - nucleon collision points , 2 ) in - medium propagation by an explicit monte carlo simulation of the boltzmann equation , and 3 ) hadronization of heavy quarks into heavy mesons via coalescence and fragmentation on the hypersurface of constant temperature @xmath5  mev",
    ".    the interaction of the heavy quarks with the thermal medium constituents can either be purely collisional or include the emission of bremsstrahlung gluons .",
    "the elastic cross sections are obtained from pqcd calculations including a running coupling @xmath6 .",
    "the gluon propagator in the @xmath7-channel is regularized within the htl+semihard approach @xcite by @xmath8 for a self - consistently determined debye mass @xmath9 .",
    "the parameter @xmath10 is obtained from the requirement that the average energy loss calculated in htl is reproduced with a maximal insensitivity of the intermediate scale between nominally soft and hard processes .",
    "the incoherent radiation spectra result from extending the calculation in @xcite to finite quark masses .",
    "the effect of coherence is implemented by an effective reduction of the power spectrum per unit length @xcite .",
    "it turns out that this lpm suppression becomes important only at sufficiently high @xmath1 .",
    "the resulting scattering rates must be understood in connection with the underlying medium description and the interpretation of the equation of state in terms of the dynamical degrees of freedom @xcite . due to the existing uncertainties in implementing the different ingredients we calibrate the energy - loss models globally through rescaling of rates by a @xmath11-factor .",
    "it is chosen to best reproduce the high-@xmath1 @xmath0 meson @xmath2 data in central collisions and remains unchanged when studying further observables .",
    "@xmath12 for the collisional+radiative(lpm ) scenario is rather close to a generic value of @xmath13 .    for the background medium",
    "we choose the @xmath4 dimensional ideal fluid dynamical evolution stemming from epos initial conditions , which combine pqcd calculations of the hard scattering with the gribov - regge theory of the phenomenological , soft part of the interaction .",
    "multiple scatterings form parton ladders , which are represented by flux tubes .",
    "jet components can be subtracted and the bulk matter is mapped onto the initial fluid dynamical fields .",
    "the flux tube radii are enhanced in order to mimic viscous effects .",
    "the epos model describes well @xmath1 spectra , flow harmonics and correlation patterns like the ridge in au+au collisions at rhic and pb+pb , p+pb and p+p collisions at the lhc @xcite . for illustration purpose",
    ", we apply a simple convolution of the initial @xmath1 spectrum in order to include ( anti-)shadowing at ( high ) low @xmath1 in central collisions at the lhc according to the eps09 nuclear shadowing effect @xcite . in an upcoming next epos version shadowing and viscous corrections",
    "will be included consistently .",
    "the epos fluctuating initial conditions allow us to perform an event - by - event study of heavy - quark observables .",
    "we optimize computing resources by running @xmath14 heavy - quark events per epos fluid dynamical event .",
    "it turns out that further decreasing @xmath15 does not change the results significantly .",
    "figs .  [ fig : lhc ] and [ fig : rhic ] present our results for the traditional heavy - flavor observables , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , at lhc and rhic energies .",
    "while the purely collisional energy loss shows the rising trend at larger @xmath1 seen in the lhc @xmath2 data , it is missed by the collisional+radiative(lpm ) energy loss model . at low @xmath1 the data is overestimated if the initial state shadowing is not included . at higher @xmath1 an indication for the antishadowing",
    "can be seen within the current accuracy .",
    "both energy loss models produce a substantial elliptic flow coefficient @xmath3 in non - central collisions . at lower @xmath1",
    "the @xmath3 in the purely collisional interaction is larger than the one in the collisional+radiative(lpm ) case , while at higher @xmath1 this picture is reversed . here , energy loss is the dominant mechanism to produce an azimuthal anisotropy .",
    "we checked that as expected initial state shadowing does not affect the @xmath3 in the presently achieved accuracy .",
    "the current range in @xmath1 of the @xmath0 meson @xmath2 measured at rhic falls in the region where already at the lhc we are currently unable to describe the data satisfactorily without shadowing .",
    "in contrast to the lhc , however , the pattern is slightly different and the data at @xmath16  gev is underpredicted . applying the same @xmath11-factors as for the lhc , we find that the data point at highest available @xmath17  gev is missed .",
    "we slightly adjust the @xmath11-factor to reproduce this data point .",
    "the consequences of this change are seen in the difference of the @xmath2 curves as well as in the @xmath0 meson elliptic flow @xmath3 , where the larger @xmath11-factors leads to a larger @xmath3 .",
    "it has not yet been measured at rhic , except for minimum bias events .",
    "we find the same ordering from the purely collisional to the collisional+radiative(lpm ) interaction mechanism as at the lhc in the given @xmath1 range , but the peak value is reduced by @xmath18% .",

    ", the @xmath0 mesons develop a nonzero @xmath21 , which has been calculated in correlation with the initial participant plane angle @xmath22 . it is smaller than the @xmath3 and shows the expected ordering with respect to the different energy loss mechanisms within the given accuracy .",
