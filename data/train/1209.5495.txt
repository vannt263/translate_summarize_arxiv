    "when analyzing and processing a signal , such as a sound wave or digital picture , it is often useful to represent the signal in terms of a basis .",
    "for instance , a sound wave can be represented in terms of its harmonic frequencies by a fourier series . with this representation",
    ", the sound wave can be processed to remove static by setting to 0 the high frequency coefficients , or be compressed for smaller storage on a computer by discretizing the coefficients and setting small coefficients to 0 .",
    "representing a function with respect to a basis is also useful in transmitting signals , as all that is needed to be sent are the basis coefficients instead of every value of the function .",
    "there is a problem with this transmission procedure though when error is introduced into the system .",
    "if one of the basis coefficients is lost or corrupted during transmission , then an entire dimension is lost and can not be recovered .",
    "this is where using a frame instead of a basis can be useful .",
    "a frame is essentially a redundant coordinate system in that a frame uses more vectors than necessary when representing a signal .",
    "however , this redundancy helps to mitigate the error due to the loss of coordinates through transmission by effectively spreading the loss over the whole space instead of localizing it to certain dimensions . given @xmath7 , a _",
    "tight frame for @xmath0 _ is a sequence @xmath8 with @xmath9 such that there exists a constant @xmath10 satisfying @xmath11 where , @xmath12 is the standard inner product on @xmath0 ( the dot product ) .",
    "thus , a frame allows for the exact reconstruction of a vector from the sequence of frame coefficients @xmath13 .",
    "we call a tight frame @xmath14 a _ finite unit tight frame , or funtf _ , if @xmath15 for all @xmath16 .",
    "note that in the case @xmath17 , a sequence @xmath18 is a funtf if and only if it is an ortho - normal basis .",
    "funtfs are the most useful frames for signal processing , as they minimize mean squared error due to noise @xcite .",
    "this has motivated the study of funtfs and in particular has led to interest in finding ways to construct funtfs . in @xcite , using a potential energy concept inspired from physics , it is proven that there exists a finite unit tight frame of @xmath19 vectors for @xmath0 for all natural numbers @xmath20 .",
    "an explicit construction for funtfs is given in @xcite , and in @xcite the method of spectral tetris is introduced to explicitly construct funtfs as well other types of frames .",
    "in the context of differential geometry and topology , the word `` frame '' has a different meaning .",
    "a moving frame for the tangent bundle of a smooth manifold can be thought of as a basis for the tangent space at each point on the manifold which moves continuously over the manifold .",
    "to avoid confusion , we will refer to moving frames in this context as moving bases .",
    "if @xmath7 and @xmath21 is an @xmath4-dimensional smooth manifold , then a _ vector field _ is a continuous function @xmath22 such that @xmath23 for all @xmath24 .",
    "that is , a vector field continuously assigns to each point @xmath25 , a vector @xmath26 in the tangent space @xmath27 .",
    "thus , a moving basis for the tangent bundle of a @xmath4-dimensional smooth manifold @xmath21 is a sequence of vector fields @xmath28 such that @xmath29 is a basis for @xmath30 for all @xmath31 .    of particular interest in the theory of vector fields and",
    "moving bases is the case where the underlying manifold @xmath21 is the @xmath4-dimensional sphere @xmath5 .",
    "note that @xmath1 can be represented by the unit circle in @xmath32 and that @xmath33 can be represented by the unit sphere in @xmath34 .",
    "the famous hairy ball theorem states that if @xmath4 is even then there does not exist a nowhere zero vector field for @xmath5 . as a moving basis for @xmath5 would consist of @xmath4 nowhere zero vector fields , the manifold @xmath5 can not have a moving basis when @xmath4 is even . on the other hand , it can be simply proven that @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 all have a moving basis for their tangent space . to give a brief sketch of this proof",
    ", we identify @xmath1 with the unit circle of the complex numbers @xmath35 , @xmath2 with the unit sphere of the quaternions @xmath36 , and @xmath3 with the unit sphere of the octonions @xmath37 .",
    "each of these division algebras contain the real numbers , so in particular we have that @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 .",
    "now for each of the cases @xmath41 , we can pick a basis @xmath42 for the tangent space @xmath43 . to move this basis @xmath44 from @xmath45 to a different point @xmath46",
    ", we simply multiply each vector in the basis by @xmath47 giving @xmath48 .",
    "this gives a moving basis for @xmath5 for the cases @xmath41 .",
    "this proof will not work for other values of @xmath4 as @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 are the only finite dimensional division algebras over @xmath49 besides @xmath49 itself .",
    "the question of does @xmath5 have a moving basis for its tangent bundle for any other values of @xmath4 was an important open problem in differential topology and was solved negatively in 1958 by michel kervaire and independently by raoul bott and john milnor .",
    "@xmath5 has a basis for its tangent space at each point which moves smoothly over @xmath5 if and only if @xmath50 .",
    "this motivates us to question what happens when we weaken the condition of basis to that of finite unit tight frame . by combining the two definitions of the word `` frame '' ,",
    "we are led to studying tight frames which vary smoothly over a manifold . as the reconstruction formula ( [ recform ] ) uses an inner product ,",
    "we need to consider riemannian manifolds , where the riemannian metric gives a smoothly varying inner product for the tangent space at each point on the manifold .",
    "note that any smooth submanifold of @xmath0 is naturally a riemannian manifold where the riemannian metric is given by the standard inner product on @xmath0 .",
    "[ frame ] let @xmath21 be an @xmath4-dimensional riemannian manifold with riemannian metric @xmath51 for each @xmath52 .",
    "let @xmath20 , and @xmath53 be a vector field for all @xmath54 .",
    "we say that @xmath14 is a _ moving tight frame _ for the tangent bundle of @xmath21 if @xmath55 is a tight frame for @xmath56 for all @xmath52 .",
    "that is , for all @xmath57 , there exists @xmath10 such that @xmath58 we say that @xmath14 is a _ moving finite unit tight frame ( funtf ) _ for the tangent bundle of @xmath21 if it is a moving tight frame and @xmath59 for all @xmath16 and @xmath52 .",
    "if @xmath7 is even , then the sphere @xmath5 does not have a nowhere zero vector field .",
    "as a moving funtf consists of unit vector fields , no even dimensional sphere can have a moving funtf for its tangent bundle . on the other hand , we will show that every odd dimensional sphere has a moving funtf for its tangent bundle .",
    "the concept of a moving tight frame was first applied in 2009 when p. kuchment proved that particular vector bundles over the torus , which arise in mathematical physics , have natural moving tight frames but do not have moving bases @xcite . in @xcite",
    ", it was shown that the dilation theorem for tight frames in @xmath0 can be extended to moving tight frames .",
    "the relationship between frames for hilbert spaces and manifolds was also considered in a different context by dykema and strawn , who studied the manifold structure of collections of funtfs under certain equivalent classes @xcite",
    ".    for terminology and background on vector bundles and smooth manifolds see @xcite . for terminology and background on frames for hilbert spaces see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "most of the research contained in this paper was conducted at the 2010 research experience for undergraduates in matrix analysis and wavelets organized by dr david larson .",
    "the first author was a research mentor for the program , and the second and third authors were participants .",
    "we sincerely thank dr larson for his advice and encouragement .",
    "before discussing moving tight frames , we give some basic results about how to check whether or not a sequence of vectors is a tight frame for a hilbert space . for @xmath7 ,",
    "we denote the unit vector basis for @xmath0 by @xmath60 .",
    "as the reconstruction formula ( [ recform ] ) is linear , it holds for all @xmath61 if and only if it holds for the vectors in the orthonormal basis @xmath60 .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath62 and @xmath61 , then @xmath63 if and only if @xmath64 for all @xmath65 .",
    "this leads us to the following fact .",
    "[ factbasis ] let @xmath66 .",
    "the sequence @xmath14 is a tight frame for @xmath0 if and only if there exists a constant @xmath10 such that @xmath67    given @xmath7 and @xmath68 , we will be interested in identifying when a sequence @xmath69 is a tight frame for the subspace @xmath70 .",
    "however , fact [ factbasis ] may only be used to check if a sequence of vectors is a tight frame for the entire space , not just a subspace .",
    "we will use the following fact to get around this problem .",
    "[ factunion ] let @xmath7 and @xmath71 such that @xmath72 .",

    "to apply fact [ factunion ] , we need to know the frame constant for a given finite unit tight frame .",
    "this is given by the following fact , which can be deduced from fact [ factbasis ] by summing over @xmath80 .",
    "[ factcoef ] let @xmath81 such that @xmath9 .",
    "if @xmath8 is a finite unit tight frame for @xmath0 then @xmath82 is the frame constant for @xmath14 .",
    "we identify the sphere @xmath5 with the unit vectors in @xmath83 .",
    "that is , @xmath84 . with this representation ,",
    "it is very easy to identify the tangent space @xmath85 for each @xmath46 .",
    "we first note that if @xmath46 , then the vector @xmath47 is normal to the tangent space @xmath85 .",
    "thus , as @xmath5 is a manifold of 1 less dimension than @xmath83 , if @xmath86 , then a vector @xmath87 is in the tangent space @xmath85 if and only if @xmath88 is orthogonal to @xmath47 .",
    "that is , if @xmath89 and @xmath90 then @xmath91 if and only if @xmath92 .",
    "for example , in the case of the circle , if @xmath93 then @xmath94 is the unit vector in the tangent line @xmath95 which points counter - clockwise .",
    "thus , we can create a unit vector field for @xmath96 by switching the two coordinates and including a negative sign in the first coordinate .",
    "this method can be used to create vector fields for higher dimensional spheres as well . given any @xmath7 , we create a unit vector field for @xmath97 by switching pairs of coordinates and inserting a negative sign into one coordinate of each pair . for example",
    ", the map @xmath98 is a unit vector field on @xmath99 . to formalize this , if @xmath100 and @xmath101 then we define @xmath102 to be the operator defined by @xmath103 .",
    "as we are only interested in @xmath104 when it switches pairs of coordinates and multiplies one of the coordinates in each pair by @xmath105 , we restrict ourselves to the set , @xmath106 note that the condition that @xmath107 guarantees in particular that @xmath108 for all @xmath109 .",
    "thus , the set @xmath110 is exactly the collection of operators which switches pairs of coordinates and multiplies one of the coordinates in each pair by @xmath105 .",
    "the next lemma shows that the operators in @xmath110 can be used to construct tangent vectors .",
    "recall that @xmath113 if and only if @xmath114 .",
    "we have that , @xmath115 thus , @xmath114 and hence @xmath113 .",
    "the vector @xmath116 is formed by permuting the coordinates of @xmath47 and multiplying half the coordinates by @xmath105 .",
    "none of these operations changes the norm , and thus @xmath117 as @xmath118 .    by lemma  [ lemmatangentsphere ] ,",
    "if @xmath119 , then we may define a unit vector field @xmath120 by @xmath121 for all @xmath122 . in the introduction we used division algebras over @xmath49 to prove that @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 each have a moving basis for their tangent bundle .",
    "however , for @xmath50 it is also possible to choose @xmath123 such that @xmath124 is a moving orthonormal basis for @xmath5 . indeed , if @xmath125 then @xmath126 is an orthonormal basis for @xmath95 , and if @xmath127 then @xmath128 is an orthonormal basis for @xmath129 . constructing a moving orthonormal basis for @xmath130",
    "can be done similarly . as no other sphere",
    "has a moving basis for its tangent bundle , we now focus on moving funtfs .",
    "a funtf is able to reconstruct every vector in @xmath0 exactly , and hence the vectors that comprise a funtf are in this respect , distributed uniformly across @xmath131 .",
    "thus , it is natural to assume that wether or not a set of vector fields of the form @xmath124 is a moving funtf depends on wether or not the set @xmath132 in some respect uniformly switches pairs of coordinates and in some respect uniformly inserts negative signs . with this in mind",
    ", we introduce the following definition .          verifying that a particular set @xmath133 is balanced requires checking many different equations , and it is not immediately obvious that balanced sets always exist .",
    "however , the following lemma shows that the entire set @xmath110 itself is balanced",
