    "edge magnetoplasmons ( emps ) in the two - dimensional electron system ( 2des ) are chiral collective excitations propagating along the edge of the 2des in the presence of a normal magnetic field @xmath13 .",
    "they have received much attention after pioneering works in the 80s.@xcite many experimental studies have been performed for confined electrons in algaas - gaas heterostructures allen83,galchenkov86,talyanskii89,wassermeier90,grodnensky91,ashoori92,talyanskii92,zhitenev93,talyanskii95,ernst96,deviatov97,balaban97,sukhodub04,kukushkin04,kukushkin05,dorozhkin05 and for surface electrons on liquid helium.mast85,glattli85,kirichek95 the advent of time - resolved techniquesashoori92,zhitenev93,ernst96,sukhodub04 and recent experimental techniques based on @xmath13-periodic oscillations in the photovoltage and in the longitudinal resistance of 2des , induced by microwave radiation and attributed to the interference of coherently excited emps , kukushkin04,kukushkin05,dorozhkin05 increases greatly the interest in emps studies .",
    "emps are sensitive to reconstruction of quantum hall edges@xcite and can probe the interactions properties in a quantum hall line junction system.@xcite a lot of theoretical works have investigated the characteristics of emps and different edge - wave mechanisms are proposed or used .    theoretically emps often are studied employing models entirely classical , see _",
    "e.g. _ refs.@xcite . in these edge - wave mechanisms",
    "the charge density varies at the 2des edge , but the position of the 2des edge is kept constant .",
    "different , quantum - mechanical edge - wave mechanisms are developed in refs .",
    "@xcite . in these models",
    "only the edge of 2des is varying while the density profile , with respect to the fluctuating edge , coincides with that of the unperturbed 2des .",
    "recently , a microscopic model has been proposed in refs.@xcite that effectively incorporates both above edge - wave mechanisms in the quantum hall effect ( qhe ) regime .",
    "the study of the emps with this new edge - wave mechanism is elaborated in refs .",
    "@xcite in the limit of low temperatures given by @xmath14 , where @xmath1 is the group velocity of the edge states and the magnetic length @xmath15 with the cyclotron frequency @xmath16 .",
    "later , the approach of refs .",
    "@xcite has been extended in ref .",
    "@xcite for not - too - low temperatures such that @xmath17 , where the typical scale of in - plane components of the wave electric field @xmath18 is of the order of the characteristic length @xmath19 . in ref .",
    "@xcite it is shown that the main contribution to the damping of emps is given by dissipation effects localized within a narrow region of width of the order of @xmath20 , nearby the edge states . for @xmath4 ,",
    "weakly damped emps are obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite only in the _ weak dissipation _ regime @xmath9 or in the _ strong dissipation _ regime defined by @xmath21 and for homogeneous samples ( i.e. , without gate or air region close to the 2des ) . in the present paper the microscopic approach of ref .",
    "@xcite is extended to study emps at _ not - too - low temperatures _ both in homogeneous samples and in samples with a metal gate or air on the top of the sample at distance @xmath22 from the 2des .",
    "we study , at @xmath4 , emps for very strong dissipation at the edge , _",
    "i.e. _ , for @xmath23 , and a new weakly damped mode , which we call _ helical edge magnetoplasmon _ or _ edge helicon _ , is obtained .",
    "in particular , we obtain that the real part of helical edge magnetoplasmon frequency @xmath24 for the homogeneous sample and very strong dissipation almost coincides with that of the fundamental emp , obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath9 .",
    "this result is rather unexpected because , in particular , all other emps ( calculated from the same secular determinant as the helical edge magnetoplasmon mode ) are now strongly damped , with @xmath25 .",
    "we show that the spatial structure of the helical edge magnetoplasmon , transverse to the edge , is strongly modified as the wave propagates along the edge .",
    "in addition , for the gated sample and _ weak dissipation _ , @xmath9 , the acoustic - like dispersion for the fundamental mode is found for some ranges of @xmath8 and comparison with pertinent qualitative estimations of ref .",
    "@xcite is given .",
    "finally , we study the fundamental modes of @xmath11 and @xmath12 lls and their strong renormalization due to the coulomb coupling for @xmath10 . and weak dissipation , @xmath9 ,    we emphasize three essential points that we take into account in our approach in order to determine the dispersion relation as well the spatial structures of the emps .",
    "the first one is the role of dissipation that is mainly localized at the edge states when a smooth lateral confinement is assumed and @xmath26 @xcite ; it is related with the scattering by acoustic phonons and becomes exponentially small for @xmath27 in comparison with the case @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the speed of sound .",
    "the second one is the  very realistic form of the unperturbed electron density @xmath30 across the edge .",
    "it was shown@xcite that for not - too - low temperatures and @xmath4 the density profile @xmath30 is well approximated by @xmath31/2 $ ] , where @xmath32 with @xmath33 being the edge of the @xmath11 ll when the condition @xmath34 is fulfilled . here the characteristics edge wave number @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the fermi energy measured from the bottom of the @xmath11 ll , i.e. , @xmath37 ; @xmath38 is the density in the interior part of the channel and @xmath39 is the fermi level measured from the bottom of the lowest electric subband .",
    "in addition , we show here that the density profile is more complicated for @xmath10 ( see the solid curve in fig .",
    "8) : the steep drop of @xmath40 at the edge is splitted in two steps - one is centered at the @xmath11 ll edge , @xmath33 , and the other step is centered at the @xmath12 ll edge , @xmath41 .",
    "the third point is related with effects of the strong electron - electron interaction in the emps . in particular , at @xmath42 , the weakly damped helical edge magnetoplasmon mode is manifested , for the regime of very strong dissipation , only due to the strong self - consistent electron - electron interaction . indeed ,",
    "if we assume that the electron - electron interaction is weak then this mode becomes strongly damped as any other emp mode .",
    "in particular , by neglecting the coupling of the monopole term ( the main term for the helical edge magnetoplasmon ) with any multipole term we obtain for the homogeneous sample and @xmath43 , according to ref .",
    "@xcite , that @xmath44/(3\\eta _ { t } ) \\ll 1 $ ] for typical conditions of our fig .",
    "i.e. , in this crude approximation the mode is strongly damped .",
    "however , the exact results for the helical edge magnetoplasmon presented in fig .",
    "2 shows that @xmath45 .",
    "point out , very close gate also can essentially suppress electron - electron interaction within 2des .",
    "further , for @xmath10 , electron - electron interaction leads to strong coulomb coupling of the fundamental emp of @xmath11 ll with the fundamental emp of @xmath12 ll , resulting in strong renormalization of their dispersion relations .",
    "we show here that the combination of these factors strongly modifies properties of the emps .",
    "in addition , it deserves to be pointed out that a many - body study of lls spectra , at @xmath46 , nearby the edge states show@xcite that electron correlations can essentially facilitate the appearance of not - too - low temperatures regime ( in particular , for @xmath47k ) : as the renormalized group velocity @xmath1 can become@xcite @xmath48 for @xmath49k@xmath50k .",

    "iii a we study the integral equations for symmetric and antisymmetric emps for @xmath51 and obtain the frequency spectrum and the spatial behavior of the helical edge magnetoplasmon .",

    "iv , we study the fundamental emps of @xmath11 ll and @xmath12 ll and their coupling by coulomb interaction for @xmath10 and in the weak dissipation regime . finally , in sec .",
    "v , we make the concluding remarks .",
    "our model consists of a 2des with width @xmath53 , length @xmath54 , and zero thickness , in the presence of a strong @xmath13 parallel to the @xmath55 axis .",
    "the lateral confining potential @xmath56 of the 2des , semi - parabolic at the left and right edges of the channel , is given as @xmath57 we assume that the confinement is smooth on the scale of @xmath58 ( i.e. , @xmath59 ) and @xmath60 . then it is possible to consider an emp @xcite @xmath61 $ ] only along , e.g. , the right edge of the channel . for @xmath62 ,",
    "we assume that the spin - splitting , caused by many - body effects , is strong enough to neglect the contribution from the upper spin - split ll . for @xmath63 and @xmath64 , we neglect spin - splitting . to simplify notations ,",
    "we omit superscript or subscript @xmath65 in values pertinent to @xmath11 ll like @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , etc . for definiteness ,",
    "the 2des is considered in gaas based sample .    at the @xmath69 qhe regime , with @xmath70 , for @xmath71 the current density components induced by an emp have both quasistatic and local ( due to @xmath72 ) form@xcite    @xmath73    where in the wave current density , @xmath74 , and the wave electric field , @xmath75 , the wave factor @xmath76 $ ] , and the arguments @xmath77 , @xmath8 are suppressed ; @xmath78 is the wave electron charge density and @xmath79 are the components of the conductivity tensor . here ,",
