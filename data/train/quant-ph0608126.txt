    "unwanted noise associated with absorption and scattering in high-@xmath0 cavities usually plays a crucial role in experiments in cavity quantum electrodynamics ( cavity qed ) @xcite .",

    "in such a case the process of quantum - state extraction from a high-@xmath0 cavity is characterized by efficiency of about 50% , @xcite .",

    "unfortunately , due to the small efficiency of the quantum - state extraction , the states of the field may lose essential nonclassical properties after escaping from the cavity .    in the framework of quantum noise theories ( qnt ) ,",
    "a high-@xmath0-cavity mode is usually considered as a harmonic oscillator interacting through the coupling mirror with a number of external modes .",
    "this leads to the description of the cavity mode in terms of a quantum langevin equation and input  output relation @xcite .",

    "indeed , it is clear that an input field can be absorbed or scattered in the coupling mirror .",
    "a detailed analysis shows that for a complete description of the unwanted noise one should take into account also the absorption / scattering losses inside the coupling mirrors @xcite .    as we will show below",

    "such a description allows one to have a clear geometrical interpretation of the operators of unwanted noise as vectors in a unitary space .",

    "in other words , it should describe all possible cavities .",
    "otherwise , one gets a degenerate model , which describes just a restricted class of the cavities .    the easiest way for the parametrization of the considered manifold follows directly from eqs .",

    "however , as we will show in the following , in some cases it is convenient to use representations with a lager number of dimensions , with particular emphasis on the three - dimensional case .",
    "the method of replacement schemes , widely used in quantum optics , can be applied to the formulation of a parametrization which works with all the values of independent parameters .",
