    "the dynamical behavior of a charged particle in a strong magnetic field exhibits a separation of time scales .",
    "these disparate time scales can be leveraged to isolate the slow guiding - center dynamics from the rapid larmor motion , and to construct a constant of motion , the magnetic moment .",
    "this guiding - center reduction identifies a perturbative change of coordinates through an expansion in the larmor radius to yield a slow ( @xmath0-dimensional ) description of charged - particle motion @xcite .",
    "guiding - center theory has wide applications in plasma physics , which involves space - time scales that are larger than the larmor scales @xcite .",
    "in addition , it is the starting point for the gyrokinetic model of plasma dynamics , which is a key model in the study of plasma micro - turbulence @xcite .",
    "the fast coordinate that measures the larmor gyration of the particle around the magnetic - field lines is the so - called _ gyro - angle_. it plays a leading role in guiding - center theory , but its standard definition raises several questions , both from a mathematical and from a physical point of view @xcite .",
    "for instance , when can the gyro - angle be globally defined ? what is the physical and mathematical meaning of gyro - gauge dependence and gyro - angle anholonomy ?",
    "these questions can imply troubles for guiding - center theory .",
    "for instance , at higher orders , the gauge - independence of the results can be difficult to prove , because it can rely on complicated vector identities @xcite .",
    "in addition , it was envisaged in the literature @xcite that the non - global existence might imply a breakdown of guiding - center theory at higher orders in the larmor radius .",
    "previous works clarified the point by investigating the condition for local descriptions to be consistent with a global description @xcite , but an alternative and more radical way to solve the problem is to perform the derivation with a globally defined gyro - angle coordinate .    in recent works",
    "@xcite , we showed that both aspects of guiding - center theory ( averaging reduction , and existence of the magnetic moment ) can be addressed while using an alternative global , physical coordinate for the gyro - angle , which is the unit vector of the component of the momentum perpendicular to the magnetic field .",
    "no gauge fixing was needed .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "[ ] that this intrinsic coordinate can be used also in the standard procedure for the guiding - center reduction , which provides a hamiltonian structure for the guiding - center dynamics and a maximal reduction for the guiding - center lagrangian .",
    "all the results of the literature can thus be obtained using this physical but constrained coordinate .",
    "+ in the light of this approach , we now come back to the questions about the usual coordinate .",
    "this can clarify whether these questions are related to intrinsic properties of the physics and mathematics of the guiding - center system or to artificial , physically meaningless constructions . in the former case ,",
    "it is interesting to study how these properties can be observed in the gauge - independent formulation , i.e. what the counterparts of the traditional questions are . indeed , the guiding - center derivations in refs .",
    "[ ] showed that , in the gauge - independent approach , all the features of the standard approach seemed to be present , including a kind of generalized gauge vector .",
    "this makes it necessary to clarify whether the gauge - independent coordinate actually resolves the questions or only transfers them into other questions .    an additional advantage of the present study is to make clear the essential differences between the intrinsic gyro - angle and the traditional gyro - angle , which opens the way to variations of the intrinsic approach .",
    "for instance , this study could indicate how to eliminate the presence of a constrained coordinate while working with only intrinsically defined quantities , or how to wisely choose a scalar gyro - angle coordinate .",
    "thus , the purpose of this paper is twofold : first , the intrinsic counterparts of the guiding - center anholonomy and gauge arbitrariness are identified , and , second , we investigate whether it is possible to remove the intricacies of the intrinsic framework induced by its constrained coordinate system .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we review the standard and the gauge - independent gyro - angles .",
    "this will emphasize that , when using the latter variable , the questions associated with the gyro - angle have disappeared from the coordinate system .",
    "especially , the main difficulty , the non - global existence , will not have a counterpart in the intrinsic approach .    in sec .",
    "iii , we turn our attention to the intrinsic counterpart of the gauge freedom .",
    "it is present in the intrinsic approach because the gauge - independent gyro - angle is treated as a constrained coordinate , which is not completely independent of the spatial position : when the spatial position is changed , the gyro - angle has to be changed in order to remain perpendicular to the magnetic field .",
    "this is similar to what happens to tangent vectors on a curved space , e.g. in general relativity .",
    "thus , gradients are actually covariant derivatives .",
    "their definition involves a free term , called the _ connection _ of the covariant derivative , which embodies the choice of a parallel transport for the gyro - angle . in the principal - circle - bundle picture @xcite",
    ", it corresponds to the connection @xmath1-form .    in sec .",
    "iv , we investigate the anholonomy question . in the intrinsic framework",
    ", the anholonomy will result from the curvature of the coordinate space encoded in covariant derivatives , or more precisely in commutators between them . in the circle - bundle picture",
    ", it corresponds to the curvature @xmath2-form .",
    "ii - iv are devoted to our first goal , namely the remnants of the three questions about the intrinsic coordinate system , while secs .",
    "v - vi are devoted to our second goal .",
    "these last two sections aim at simplifying the gauge - independent formalism by removing the presence of anholonomy and covariant derivatives along with their associated intricacies .    in sec .",
    "v , we consider using the freedom embodied in the connection in order to remove the anholonomy by making covariant derivatives commute .",
    "this will provide an interesting approach to the existence condition for a scalar gyro - angle coordinate .",
    "lastly , in sec",
    ".  vi , we consider the flaws associated with the presence of a constrained coordinate .",
    "we show how they can be eliminated by avoiding the splitting between the gyro - angle and the pitch - angle in the coordinate system .",
    "the physical system under consideration is a charged particle with position @xmath3 , momentum @xmath4 , mass @xmath5 , and charge @xmath6 , under the influence of an electromagnetic magnetic field @xmath7 .",
    "the motion is given by the lorentz force @xmath8    when the magnetic field is strong , the motion implies a separation of time scales .",
    "this is best seen by choosing convenient coordinates for the momentum space , for instance @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the unit vector of the magnetic field , and @xmath11 is the so - called _ perpendicular momentum _ , i.e. the orthogonal projection of the momentum onto the plane perpendicular to the magnetic field .",
    "the coordinate @xmath12 is the norm of the momentum .",
    "the coordinate @xmath13 is the so - called _ pitch - angle _ ,",
    "i.e. the angle between the momentum and the magnetic field .",
    "the last variable @xmath14 is the unit vector of the perpendicular momentum .",
    "then , the equations of motion write @xmath15 where @xmath4 is now a shorthand for @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the norm of the magnetic field and , following littlejohn s notations @xcite , the vector @xmath18 is the unit vector of the larmor radius , so that @xmath19 is a right - handed orthonormal frame ( rotating with the momentum ) .    in the case of a strong magnetic field , the only fast term is the larmor frequency @xmath20 , which corresponds to the gyration of the particle momentum around the magnetic field .",
    "it concerns only one coordinate , namely @xmath14 , the direction of the perpendicular momentum @xmath21 in the @xmath2-dimensional plane perpendicular to the magnetic field .",
    "this coordinate corresponds to the gyro - angle .",
    "+ to get a scalar angle instead of the vector @xmath14 , one chooses at each point @xmath3 in space a direction @xmath22 in the plane perpendicular to the magnetic field , which will be considered as the reference axis . then , the angle @xmath23 is defined as the oriented angle between the chosen reference axis @xmath24 and the vector @xmath14 through the following relation  : = - _ 1 - _ 2 , [ gyroanglethetadef ] with @xmath25 the unit vector such that @xmath26 is a ( fixed ) right - handed orthonormal frame @xcite .",

    "+ in the definition of @xmath27 , the necessary introduction of @xmath24 implies important and awkward features in the theory .",
    "first , the choice of @xmath24 is arbitrary , which induces a local gauge in the theory .",
    "the coordinate system is gauge dependent since the value of @xmath27 depends of the chosen @xmath24 .",
    "for a general reduction procedure , the guiding - center dynamics can end up being gauge dependent .",
    "for instance , the maximal reduction by lie - transforming the phase - space lagrangian is gauge dependent @xcite .",
    "guiding - center reductions have to use prescriptions in order to avoid such unphysical results .",
    "for instance , in the reduced lagrangian @xcite , the 1-form d@xmath27 must appear only through the quantity @xmath37 .",
    "these gauge - dependence questions emphasize that the gyro - angle is artificial , it is not given by the physics and its meaning is restricted .",
    "second and more substantial , a continuous choice of @xmath24 does not exist globally in a general magnetic geometry @xcite .",
    "the reason is that the possible values for @xmath24 define a principal circle bundle over the configuration space @xcite .",
    "a specific choice @xmath24 is a global section of the bundle .",
    "such a global section induces a trivialization of the bundle , whose coordinate system is precisely @xmath38 . but a trivialization does not exist globally for a general circle bundle . in the case of the guiding - center , this global non - existence can be proven by using the theory of principal bundles and characteristic classes @xcite .",
    "thus , the gyro - angle does not exist in the whole physical system in general .",
    "the coordinate system @xmath39 does not capture the mathematical description of the system , only a strongly simplified description that is valid only in the trivial case .",
    "it was mentioned in ref .",
    "[ ] that the local descriptions are consistent with a global description provided the change of local descriptions satisfy some relations . for instance , the @xmath1-form @xmath40 must appear only through the combination @xmath37 .",
    "so , working with @xmath27 is not meaningless .",
    "for instance , it can provide a slow guiding - center dynamics @xmath41 that is globally defined .",
    "nevertheless , this does not provide the local coordinate @xmath27 with a global meaning , neither does it explain what the global description of the gyro - angle is .",
    "last , even the local description is not completely regular , because it involves a non - holonomic phase in the gyro - angle .",
    "when a loop @xmath42 is performed in position space ( while keeping the momentum coordinates @xmath43 constant ) , at the end of the process all the coordinates and all the physical quantities have recovered their value , but the variation of the gyro - angle involves non - zero partial contributions @xcite .",
    "the best known of these contributions is the so - called _ _",
    "g__eometric phase @xmath44 .",
    "it is related to the third term in the right - hand side of : @xmath45 it embodies the well - known anholonomy associated with to the gyro - angle coordinate .",
    "a similarity with berry s phase and more generally with hannay s phase was often pointed out @xcite , but there are significant differences , as mentioned in ref .",
    "[ ] . especially , these phases are related to adiabaticity with a single path in parameter space followed by the system , which makes them physically determinable . on the contrary ,",
    "guiding - center anholonomy is related to path dependence in configuration space , with all paths coexisting simultaneously .",
    "this precludes any definite value for this phase .",
    "it raises questions whether this phase is physically meaningful or if it affects only non - physical quantities concerning the extrinsic coordinate system .",
    "+ all these questions arise because @xmath27 is only an artificial quantity .",
    "this fact motivated to keep the primitive gauge - independent coordinate @xmath14 instead of introducing @xmath27 .",
    "even if this quantity does not have scalar values , it embodies an angle since it is a unit vector in a plane and hence belongs to a circle @xmath46 .",
    "the vector @xmath14 represents the physical quantity corresponding to the gyro - angle ; @xmath27 never appears alone in the theory ( e.g. in guiding - center transformations ) , except in its own definition and subsequent relations .",
    "what appears everywhere is the vector @xmath14 ( see e.g. refs .",
    "[ ] ) . even for the correction to the gyro - angle @xmath47 in guiding - center reductions",
    ", @xmath27 never appears alone but only as the argument of the vector @xmath14 .",
    "an example can be found in the equations of motion ( [ dynamics ] ) and ( [ dynamicstheta ] ) , which also illustrate the gauge dependence or independence .",
    "in addition , the coordinate @xmath14 is globally defined , since the perpendicular momentum is well defined everywhere in the guiding - center system .",
    "it is useful to remember that the points where the momentum is parallel to the magnetic field ( i.e. the points where @xmath48 ) are always implicitly excluded from guiding - center theory , even in the local description using the scalar coordinate @xmath27 . indeed , at those points",
    ", the angle @xmath27 can not be defined .",
    "in addition , guiding - center expansions involves some @xmath49 in denominators @xcite , which implies to exclude the points where @xmath48 .",
    "the variations of @xmath14 do not include the gauge contribution @xmath50 , with its anholonomic geometric phase .",
    "in addition , no extrinsic effect can be observed in the coordinate system .",
    "so , one can expect the questions about the anholonomic geometrical phase to disappear from the theory .",
    "the underlying idea is basically true , as will be confirmed by the next sections , but some subtleties should be taken into account . as is emphasized in eq .",
    "( [ geomphaseini ] ) , anholonomy does not affect the coordinate system itself , but rather some contributions to the gyro - angle after one loop in phase space ( or in configuration space with a given parallel transport for the gyro - angle ) .",
    "the analysis in the next sections will show that the coordinate system is not enough to define the corresponding contributions , but that they can indeed be defined with a zero geometric phase .",
    "all the same , anholonomy will not disappear from the system .",
    "it will be induced by the structure of the coordinate system , and especially by the magnetic geometry .",
    "accordingly , the coordinate @xmath14 does not remove anholonomy but it does remove the anholonomy question : with the coordinate @xmath27",
    "the puzzling point was not anholonomy in itself , but rather the fact that in principle anholonomy is absent when the coordinate system is trivial .",
    "last , the coordinate @xmath14 agrees with the mathematical description of the system . for any magnetic geometry",
    ", it induces a circle bundle @xcite .",
    "indeed , the circle for @xmath14 is position - dependent since @xmath14 is perpendicular to the magnetic field .",
    "so , @xmath14 is not just in @xmath46 but in @xmath51 .",
    "a few consequences will be studied in the next sections . in the traditional coordinate system , this picture is absent because @xmath27 is independent of the position .",
    "the circle bundle rather concerns the vector @xmath52 , but the corresponding bundle is different from the intrinsic bundle for the gyro - angle .",
    "it is not defined by the whole phase space but confined to the four - dimensional space @xmath53 .",
    "in addition , the global section @xmath52 assumes the topology of the bundle trivial .",
    "accordingly , the use of the gyro - angle @xmath14 removes from the coordinate system all of the questions involved in the standard gyro - angle @xmath27 .",
    "it indeed provides the intrinsic description of the physics and mathematics of the system .",
    "the previous section showed that in the intrinsic framework , the gauge arbitrariness disappears from the coordinate system . in this section ,",
    "we show that some arbitrariness remains in the theory and that it corresponds to the intrinsic counterpart of the gyro - gauge arbitrariness    indeed , when the coordinate @xmath14 is used , the spatial dependence of @xmath46 causes the coordinate space to be constrained , i.e. the coordinates are not completely independent of each other .",
    "when the position @xmath3 is changed , the coordinate @xmath14 can not be kept unchanged , otherwise it may get out of @xmath54 : 0 . differentiating with respect to @xmath3 ,",
    "one finds @xcite _",
    "| = - ( + ) .",
    "[ connectnatur ] the right - hand side is well defined everywhere , since the points where @xmath55 , i.e. where @xmath4 is parallel to the magnetic field @xmath56 , are excluded from the theory . + must not be given a completely intrinsic meaning , because the two terms in its right - hand side play a very different role through coordinate change : the first term is always unchanged , whereas the second one is generally changed .",
    "for instance , if one uses the scalar angle @xmath27 as a local coordinate for @xmath14 , becomes = -  +   , [ connectgauge ] where : = _ 1_2 is the so - called _",
    "gauge vector_. @xmath57 is a function of the position @xmath3 , and it is not unique : it depends of the choice of gauge @xmath24 .",
    "the reason for this difference of role is that the definition space @xmath51 for the coordinate @xmath14 exactly imposes the first term in but gives no constraints on the second term .",
    "indeed , the gyro - angle @xmath14 is a free @xmath1-dimensional coordinate , but it is at the same time a vector immersed in @xmath58 .",
    "the two remaining dimensions are fixed by the condition for @xmath14 to have unit norm @xmath59 and to be transverse to the magnetic field @xmath60 .",
    "this implies = 0 = - .",
    "thus , in @xmath61 , only the component parallel to @xmath62 is not imposed by intrinsic properties linked with @xmath51 . practically , it is induced by the specific definition chosen for the gyro - angle coordinate . from an intrinsic point of view , it is completely free : = -  + _ g   , [ connectgene ] where _ g:=is a free phase - space function .",
    "+ the geometric picture of this freedom is the following . in the gradient @xmath61 ,",
    "i.e. in the effects of an infinitesimal spatial displacement on @xmath14 , one of the terms , @xmath63 , is mandatory : it is necessary and sufficient for @xmath14 to remain inside its definition domain in the process of spatial transportation .",
    "this is easily seen on a diagram .",
    "the other term @xmath64 is only optional : it corresponds to a rotation of @xmath14 around @xmath65 ( hence a gyration around the circle ) accompanying the spatial displacement .",
    "however , this term and its associated rotation could be removed or given a different value .",
    "they are not imposed by intrinsic properties and have to be arbitrarily chosen , in a similar way as when the target set of a projection is determined , but not the kernel .",
    "they encode the way points in a circle @xmath66 at the position @xmath67 are `` projected '' ( more precisely connected ) to points in the circle @xmath68 at a neighbouring position .",
    "this is very similar to what occurs to tangent vectors on a curved space , for instance on the surface of the earth or in general relativity .",
    "when the spatial position is moved , the tangent vectors from the initial point have to be moved into the tangent space of the final point .",
    "otherwise they are not tangent vectors any more .",
    "so , the gradient is actually a covariant derivative , that is an infinitesimal operator that not only changes the position , but also all other quantities in such a way that they remain inside their definition domain throughout the displacement .",
    "this phenomenon has to appear as soon as the coordinate space is constrained , i.e. when the definition domain of some coordinate ( or parameter ) depends on other coordinates .    as a result , when using the coordinate @xmath14 , the generator of spatial displacements is not a standard gradient operator , such as the gradient with the gauge - dependent gyro - angle coordinate or the one with the cartesian position - momentum coordinate . in order to emphasize the difference",
    ", the covariant - derivative gradient will be denoted with an over - bar @xmath69 . when acting on functions depending only on @xmath3 , the operators @xmath70 and @xmath71 are the same , and the over - bar will not be used .    in the definition of the covariant derivative , there is always some freedom , since the definition domain at the initial point can be connected to the definition domain at the final point in an arbitrary way . the free term in the covariant derivative corresponds to its _",
    "connection_. it determines the way objects are parallel transported . in the example of tangent vectors on a curved surface , the so - called affine connection corresponds to the well - known christoffel symbols .",
    "for the gyro - angle @xmath14 , the connection freedom is embodied in @xmath72",
    ".    more generally , the connection freedom might not affect only gradients @xmath70 .",
    "other derivative operators could also become covariant derivatives impacting the gyro - angle , i.e. @xmath73 with @xmath74 and @xmath75 arbitrary functions of the phase space .",
    "however , this additional refinement will not be used here , because it does not seem to be useful nor natural : the definition space for the gyro - angle @xmath14 depends only on the magnetic field , and hence of the spatial coordinates .",
    "all these features agree with the circle - bundle picture and emphasize its relevance , which was hidden and even suppressed from the coordinate system when using the gauge - dependent gyro - angle .",
    "indeed , instead of viewing the phase space as a constrained coordinate system @xmath76 as we did above , one can equivalently consider it as a principal @xmath46-bundle with a base space given by @xmath77 and a fiber @xmath46 .",
    "this setting offers rigorous mathematical structures .",
    "then , the covariant derivative is defined in terms of the parallel transport associated to a chosen connection @xmath1-form , i.e. a @xmath1-form on the fiber bundle that evaluates to @xmath1 on the canonical infinitesimal generator of gyro - rotation ( see e.g. ref .  [ ] for an introduction to the subject ) . in the present paper",
    ", we prefer to avoid focusing on this more technical viewpoint . its terminology and concepts could seem unfamiliar to some readers , and they are not indispensable to investigate the guiding - center system , which can be considered in the more basic picture of a constrained coordinate system .    in either formalism , the conclusion is that , although the gyro - gauge with its arbitrariness is absent from the intrinsic approach , some arbitrariness is present , not in the coordinate system itself but in the choice of a connection for the covariant derivative .",
    "+ the comparison with the gauge - dependent approach emphasizes the relationship between the two arbitrarinesses .",
    "shows that the connection is then embodied in the gauge vector @xmath57 . this quantity is called gauge vector @xcite because it exactly embodies the information on the local gauge .",
    "changing the gauge @xmath78 just means adding to the value of @xmath27 a scalar function @xmath79 ) , whose value is the angle between @xmath52 and @xmath80 at @xmath3 . under this change , the gauge vector is changed by =+ .",
    "[ gaugevectgaugedepend ] the term @xmath81 exactly embodies the purely local gauge .",
    "the remaining part of the gauge corresponds to a global gauge , i.e. the value of @xmath82 at a reference point @xmath67 . changing it corresponds to a global rotation by the same angle @xmath83 for all points @xmath3 .",
    "it is not specifically a ( local ) gauge , but rather a common change of angular coordinate .    as a side comment , which will be useful for the following ,",
    "shows that , even if the gauge vector is gauge dependent , its curl is not .",
    "the curl @xcite @xmath84 is related to intrinsic properties of the system .",
    "accordingly , the gauge vector can not be a free function of the position space , but it must satisfy the integrability condition ( [ conditionintegrgaugevect ] ) . especially , the choice @xmath85 is not available in general , even locally .",
    "+ with the above interpretation for @xmath57 , means that the local gauge freedom is exactly the counterpart of the connection freedom @xmath72 .",
    "the geometric reason is that @xmath27 is the angle between @xmath52 and @xmath14 . through spatial transportation @xmath86 with @xmath27",
    "unchanged , the gauge vector @xmath57 means that @xmath52 is rotated around @xmath65 by an angle @xmath87 .",
    "it implies that @xmath14 undergoes the same rotation .",
    "thus , the connection for @xmath52 is at the same time a connection for @xmath14 .",
    "this discussion shows that the gyro - gauge freedom originates from an inherent property of the guiding - center system .",
    "it also clarifies the precise meaning and physical content of this intrinsic arbitrariness in two ways .",
    "first , it indicates that the arbitrariness is not associated with a choice of coordinate system , but rather a choice of covariant derivative .",
    "second , it implies not only a restricted class of functions of the configuration space but a free function of the phase space .",
    "the first point clarifies how in the intrinsic formulation the arbitrariness is present but does not affect the coordinates at all , whereas in the standard formulation it affects also the coordinate @xmath27 .",
    "a first illustration is provided by the guiding - center transformation . for the gyro - angle @xmath14 , the transformation is connection - independent @xcite . for the coordinate @xmath27 , the transformation @xmath88 is gauge",
    "dependent , but in such a way as to make the induced transformation @xmath89 for @xmath14 gauge independent , with @xmath90 the vector field generating the @xmath91-th order transformation .",
    "for instance , the first - order reduced gyro - angle @xmath92 is given by @xmath93 , which is gauge dependent .",
    "as for the first - order @xmath94 , it is given by @xmath95 , which is gauge - independent @xcite .",
    "a second illustration is given by the guiding - center poisson bracket .",
    "when using the coordinate @xmath27 , its expression is gauge dependent @xcite because of the presence of the gauge vector @xmath57",
    ". nevertheless , it was noticed @xcite that this presence can be combined with the gradient through the combination @xmath96 .",
    "actually , this is exactly the connection - independent gradient for the coordinate @xmath14 .",
    "indeed , formally the covariant derivative @xmath71 can be written @xmath97 , which is connection - dependent , but in such a way as to make the quantity @xmath98 connection - independent .",
    "this last quantity is not a gradient because the second term in the right - hand side brings @xmath14 out of its definition space .",
    "thus , this term has to be removed to obtain the connection - independent gradient @xmath99 .",
    "it is the minimal connection , since it formally writes @xmath100 , which corresponds to @xmath101 , or equivalently @xmath102 .",
    "this minimal connection corresponds to the orthogonal projection , in the picture mentioned above where the connection is viewed as a projection from the circle @xmath51 to the circle @xmath103 .",
    "also the content of the true intrinsic arbitrariness can have practical interest .",
    "for instance , the physical connection ( [ connectnatur ] ) is not available when using the coordinate @xmath27 .",
    "it does not correspond to a gauge fixing ( since it depends on the momentum variables ) .",
    "neither does the connection @xmath85 , which would simplify computations and remove the arbitrary terms from the theory . as a result",
    ", there is no natural gauge fixing in this case .",
    "it is why previous works tried to identify a natural gauge fixing based on the magnetic geometry @xcite . on the contrary , with the gauge - independent coordinate @xmath14 , the physical choice @xmath104 does correspond to a connection fixing .",
    "as for the simplifying choice @xmath105 , it is just the minimal connection .",
    "it is also the natural geometrical connection , in the sense that it is induced by the definition of @xmath51 and that it corresponds to the connection - independent gradient , as appeared in the previous paragraph .",
    "thus , the intrinsic approach is not just an optional reformulation of the theory .",
    "it emphasizes the intrinsic properties underlying the gauge arbitrariness , which concern the connection of the covariant derivative @xmath71 rather than the coordinate system .",
    "it also makes available some relevant gradients that were inaccessible in the gauge - dependent formulation .",
    "we now turn to the remnants of the traditional guiding - center anholonomy in the intrinsic approach .",

    "the method of using intrinsic coordinates and defining derivative operators adapted to the purpose can be applied .",

    ", it can be chosen just @xmath195 .",
    "this arbitrariness in the choice of a basis for vector fields is similar to the connection freedom in previous sections , but it is different .",
    "it concerns the splitting of the operator @xmath185 rather than the definition of the gradient operator .",
    "this splitting procedure is only a generalization of what is commonly done for the position space . the three - dimensional quantity @xmath3 is usually kept as a coordinate but the gradient @xmath70 and the differential form @xmath196 are split into scalar components suited to the derivation , namely their components parallel to @xmath62 , @xmath65 , and @xmath14 .",
    "it is straightforward to verify that guiding - center reductions work as usual within this formalism . in a similar way as what occurred",
    "when going from the coordinate @xmath27 to the coordinate @xmath14 , the introduction of the coordinate @xmath163 removes all the intricacies from the coordinate system and confines them to the basis of vector fields of the theory .",

    "it is induced by the purposes of the guiding - center reduction , such as the separation of scales .",
    "all the subtleties mentioned in the previous sections remain present but they are encoded in the properties of the chosen basis .",
    "for instance , when the basis is chosen with @xmath191 , the formalism is the same as in the previous section with the `` full physical connection '' ( [ connectnatur ] ) and ( [ connectphi ] ) .",
    "+ one could consider going one step further and keeping all the momentum coordinates @xmath197 as a single coordinate @xmath4 .",
    "this is unsure to be relevant , since the coordinate @xmath12 actually plays no role in the introduction of the gyro - angle , as we mentioned previously .",
    "in addition , keeping the coordinate @xmath4 does not seem convenient for practical computations . when the norm of the momentum @xmath12 is kept in the reduced coordinates , as in ref .",
    "[ ] , it is unchanged by the guiding - center transformation .",
    "then it is useless to combine it with @xmath163 , which is changed by the transformation . on another hand ,",
    "most often the coordinate @xmath12 is replaced by the constant of motion conjugated to the gyro - angle , the magnetic moment @xmath36 .",

    ", the splitting of the coordinate @xmath4 into @xmath12 and @xmath163 is essential .",
    "last , separating the variables @xmath12 and @xmath163 is interesting for dimensional reasons .",
    "it implies that only one of the momentum coordinates is non - dimensionless , which can be very convenient for the derivation of the guiding - center reduction @xcite .",
    "these considerations do not mean that using the coordinate @xmath4 is to be excluded .",
    "for instance , the recent work [ ] proposed an algorithm for guiding - center reductions where the coordinate @xmath4 was kept in a first near - identity transformation .",
    "then the magnetic moment was identified and it could be adopted as a coordinate in a second transformation , not near - identity .",
    "the gauge - independent approach of guiding - center theory clarifies the questions associated with the usual gyro - angle coordinate .",
    "the use of the physical gyro - angle as a coordinate removes the non - global existence , the gauge dependence and the anholonomy from the coordinate system .",
    "the corresponding coordinate system agrees both with the physical description and with the mathematical structure of the system , a non - trivial circle bundle .",
    "this physical gyro - angle is constrained and position - dependent , which implies the presence of a covariant derivative encoding the geometry of the bundle .",
    "the induced connection involves a freedom , which is the intrinsic counterpart of the gauge arbitrariness but is much larger and very different .",
    "especially , this freedom does not affect the coordinate system and embodies a choice in the basis of vector fields of the theory .",
    "because of the larger freedom , relevant choices become available . for instance , the connection can be chosen so as to fit with the physical definition of the gyro - angle .",
    "alternatively , it can be set to zero .",
    "this minimal connection simplifies computations and removes the arbitrary terms from the theory .",
    "it was found to be underlying in previous results and can be considered as the natural geometrical connection .",
    "each of these two choices does not correspond to a gauge fixing but to a connection fixing , which shows that the intrinsic formulation is needed for the description to fit with the physics and the mathematics of the guiding - center system .",
    "this is also emphasized by the fact that the question about non - global existence not only disappears but also has no counterparts in the intrinsic formulation .",
    "both the physical and the minimal covariant derivatives have non - zero commutators , which are the counterparts of the anholonomy of the gauge - dependent approach .",
    "again , they do not concern the coordinate system but the basic derivative operators .",
    "a third choice of connection was identified , by giving to the pitch - angle the connection induced by its definition from the physical momentum .",
    "then , covariant derivatives @xmath71 do commute , but other non - zero commutators appear in phase space , which traduce the non - triviality of the circle bundle defined by the gyro - angle .    in this framework ,",
    "existence conditions for a splitting of the momentum into scalar coordinates for the pitch - angle and for the gyro - angle can be studied .",
    "the perspective is broader and complementary compared to the study of the existence of a gyro - gauge .",
    "the resulting condition is just the invertibility of a curl on a divergenceless vector field .",
    "it corresponds to boundary conditions on this vector field , in agreement with previous results . in this paper ,",
    "the analysis used contractible loops , but this restriction appeared as optional .",
    "a detailed investigation of this point could bring additional information on the structure of the guiding - center system .",
    "+ as a result , the gauge - independent formulation exhibits the intrinsic properties underlying the questions about the standard gyro - angle .",
    "the formulation mainly replaces puzzling aspects of the coordinate system by non - trivial , yet regular , properties of the basic derivative operators .",
    "the questions originated from the requirement for the coordinates and the basic derivative operators to behave trivially .",
    "this requirement can be obtained only when the circle bundle is trivial , i.e. only locally for a general magnetic geometry .",
    "in addition , it generates both the gauge dependence and the anholonomy question in the coordinate system . to agree with the physical system ,",
    "the basic derivative operators must have non commuting properties . in turn , it means that there do not exist trivializing coordinates and that a constrained coordinate has to be used for the gyro - angle .",
    "an idea underlying the intrinsic approach is that perturbation theory needs adapted derivative operators but not necessarily adapted coordinates .",
    "so , the coordinate system can be chosen as it is intrinsically , i.e. as it comes primitively .",
    "this idea can be generalized to avoid introducing the gyro - angle coordinate , with the intricacies caused by the constrained coordinate system .",
    "the gyro - angle and the pitch - angle can be kept as the single initial coordinate , which is the unit vector of the momentum .",
    "then the @xmath46-bundle is replaced by an @xmath184-bundle .",
    "the corresponding structure is trivial and the formalism becomes elementary , i.e. with no covariant derivatives ( trivial connection ) nor any non - zero commutator .",
    "the resulting coordinate system is both intrinsic and unconstrained . for guiding - center perturbation theory , an adapted basis of derivative operators",
    "is defined , which encodes all the intrinsic properties of the circle bundle associated to the gyro - angle .    -6ex",
