    "we use the 3.4  mm lines of hcn and hco@xmath1 to have an estimate of the hcn / hco@xmath1 column density ratio in the nebula surrounding the binary . using the integrated line intensity of the weakest satellite component of the hcn 1@xmath00 line , assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium and t@xmath24=15  k",
    ", we estimate a beam averaged column density of 1.7@xmath1110@xmath25  @xmath19 . with the same assumptions ,",
    "we derive a hco@xmath1 column density of @xmath261@xmath1110@xmath25  @xmath19 .",
    "therefore the average hcn / hco@xmath1 column density in this region is @xmath261.7 .",
    "this ratio is not dependent on the assumed rotation temperature as long as it is the same for the two molecules , which is a reasonable assumption taking into account their similar dipole moments .",
    "our millimeter data allow for the first time to sample the planet formation zone of the disks gv tau n and gv tau s and evidence a dramatic chemical differentiation in the molecular gas associated with gv  tau  n and gv  tau  s. previous nir observations did not allow to conclude because the absorption lines are strongly dependent on the disk orientation .",
    "our observations show that the hcn / hco@xmath1 ratio must be @xmath3300 in the planet formation zone of gv  tau  n. in contrast , the hcn / hco@xmath1 must be @xmath21.6 in gv  tau  s. the huge hcn column density found in the inner r@xmath212  au disk of gv  tau  n is consistent with the chemical calculations by agndez cernicharo & goicoechea ( 2008 ) .",
    "they predicted an hcn abundance as large as 5@xmath1110@xmath27 in the inner r@xmath23  au of circumstellar disks ( see fig .",
    "the hcn is not arising from the disk mid - plane but from the photon - dominated region in the disk surface .",
    "the high densities and temperatures in this region are essential to achieve a huge hcn abundance ( cernicharo 2004 ) .",
    "the synthesis of organic molecules in the gas requires that atomic carbon , produced by the dissociation of co , incorporates into c - bearing species faster than reverting to co. for example , c@xmath6h@xmath6 and hcn reach low abundances at 100 k because the reactions of c@xmath6h and cn with h@xmath6 have activation barriers ( cernicharo 2004 ) . at temperatures above @xmath9400",
    "k atomic oxygen is efficiently converted into oh , which may react with c to form co but reacts faster with h@xmath6 to form water . thus , most of the oxygen forms h@xmath6o , and co does not reach its maximum abundance allowing atomic carbon to form c - bearing molecules .",
    "the key reactions for the hcn formation such that c+no@xmath0cn+o , or h@xmath6+cn@xmath0hcn+h , proceed very rapidly at these large gas densities ( @xmath310@xmath4  @xmath5 ) and temperatures ( cernicharo 2004 ) .",
    "this mechanism also works for any dense pdr such as those found around protoplanetary nebula where the photodissociation of co and hcn allows a fast photo - polymerization towards longer carbon chains ( cernicharo 2004).this same result was found by walsh et al .",
    "( 2010 ) in their disk chemical model which included a grain - surface network . in that model",
    "the [ hcn]/[hco@xmath1 ] ratio was @xmath91000 at r@xmath91  au and always @xmath310 for r@xmath210  au . although not essential , accretion shocks could contribute to enhance the density and gas kinetic temperature and make the hcn formation more efficient .",
    "one puzzling question then is the non - detection of hcn in gv  tau  s. this can only be explained by a different disk morphology ( flatter disk , an inner gap ) , different dust properties and/or a different gas / dust ratio in the inner disk .",
    "higher spatial resolution interferometric observations are required to unveil the hidden structure of this interesting binary .",
