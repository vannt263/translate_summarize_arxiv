    "most , if not all , low- and intermediate - mass stars form surrounded by massive disks of gas and dust , which persist for a few million years before dissipating .",
    "these disks play important roles in regulating stellar angular momentum , launching bipolar winds and outflows , and , for a substantial fraction of stars , giving rise to planetary systems . modeling a disk s spectral energy distribution ( sed ) alone",
    "provides only limited insight into these processes because young disks are optically thick , resulting in degeneracies between model parameters and ambiguous interpretations @xcite .",
    "spatially resolved images in scattered light are generally needed in order to break these degeneracies , and thereby probe the disks complex structures @xcite .",
    "the two most well - known and well - studied classes of pre - main - sequence ( pms ) stars are the t tauri and herbig ae / be stars .",
    "the observational distinction between these two classes is based on spectral type : young stars cooler than f - type are considered t tauris while hotter ones are called herbig ae / be stars . typically , t tauri stars are interpreted to be pms stars of roughly solar mass or less , while herbig ae / be stars are young stars of intermediate mass , @xmath2 . but such a one - dimensional classification can not fully represent the range of pms stellar properties , which depend on both mass and age .",
    "this is particularly true for intermediate - mass stars , which are stable against convection and consequently evolve horizontally across the hertzsprung - russell diagram towards the main sequence , rising in surface temperature and changing in spectral type as they go .",
    "as very young intermediate - mass stars contract toward becoming herbig ae / be stars , they first pass through a stage in which they are classified as t tauri stars , but ones with vastly higher luminosity than typical .",
    "these `` intermediate - mass t tauri stars '' ( imtts ; calvet et  al .",
    "2004 ) are the youngest intermediate - mass stars available for observation at visible or near - ir wavelengths . due to the slope of the stellar initial mass function and the rapid speed at",
    "which stars evolve through this early stage , imttss are relatively rare and have been the subject of few detailed studies .",

    "mwc 778 ( = iras 05471 + 2351 ) is an unusual , and little - studied , object located in the ic 2144 nebula in the direction of the galactic anticenter .",
    "herbig & vacca  ( 2008 ;  hereafter hv08 ) recently presented high resolution optical and moderate resolution near - infrared spectra of mwc 778 and its surrounding nebulosity .",
    "these spectra suggest that mwc 778 is a mid- to late - type pms star with a bolometric luminosity of several hundred @xmath3  in other words , it appears that it may be an imtts , though this classification is far from certain , as we will discuss below .",
    "their spectra furthermore imply the presence of a circumstellar disk around mwc 778 , inclined close to edge - on to our line of sight .    in this paper , we present near - ir adaptive optics ( ao ) imaging polarimetry and mid - ir imaging that resolve this disk , confirming the interpretation of hv08 .",
    "these observations were taken as part of a larger survey of herbig ae / be stars with adaptive optics polarimetry and mid - infrared imaging ( perrin 2006 ) .",
    "near - ir differential polarimetry is an effective technique for resolved imaging of circumstellar material because it allows suppression of the extended and time - variable ao point spread function ( psf ) halo . because atmospheric turbulence does not polarize the psf halo , while dust - scattered light is strongly polarized , differential polarimetry can separate them to reach the fundamental photon noise limit for detection of faint material ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "first identified in the mount wilson catalogue of h@xmath4-emitting objects compiled by merrill & burwell ( 1949 ) , mwc 778 was classified as bpe based on a low - dispersion slit spectrogram ( obtained by minkowski ) which revealed strong h and  emission lines .",
    "allen ( 1974 ) noted that mwc 778 has a large infrared excess due to dust emission , giving it a very unusual sed that rises nearly linearly in a plot of @xmath5 vs. @xmath6 between 1.65 and 18 microns .",
    "this rising infrared sed places mwc 778 firmly within the category of class i ysos , with a nir spectral index @xmath7 .",
    "allen also reported the presence of emission lines of h , , [ ] , and [ ] in an optical spectrum of the source , and suggested that it was a pre - main sequence ae or be star .",

    "their own much - higher - resolution optical spectra reveal the presence of rotationally broadened absorption lines from species like ca i and fe i , which they claimed were photospheric in origin and based on which they suggested a spectral type for mwc 778 between late a and g. the nir spectrum exhibits a large number of  and [ ] lines as well as the br series ( up to br 26 ) and the pa series ( up to pa 23 ) in emission .",
    "herbig & vacca derived an extinction @xmath14 from a variety of indicators and estimated a distance of @xmath15 kpc based on associations with other star forming regions in the area , but stressed that this value is highly uncertain . integrating the observed sed using that distance leads to a bolometric luminosity of @xmath16 . the h@xmath4 image shown by hv08 looks very similar to the lobed nebula surrounding other b[e ] stars ( marston & mccollum 2008 ) .",
    "hv08 refer to ic 2144 as a reflection nebula , not an emission nebula ( i.e. ,  region ) , though it has also been classified as an  region by others ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we obtained @xmath17 and @xmath18 band differential imaging linear polarimetry of mwc 778 with the 3-m shane telescope at lick observatory , using the laser guide star adaptive optics ( lgs ao ) facility @xcite and the ircal camera @xcite .    a detailed description of the ircal polarimeter , the observing procedures , and the associated data reduction pipeline can be found in perrin et  al .  ( 2008 ) .",
    "briefly , a wollaston prism within ircal forms simultaneous images of perpendicular polarizations on the detector , and a rotating half - wave plate modulates the observed polarization state while a sequence of images are taken .",
    "after bias and flat - field correction , the images for each linear polarization ( corresponding to a given waveplate rotation ) are mosaiced together .",
    "the sums and differences of the resulting mosaic images then give the stokes @xmath19 and @xmath20 parameters describing linear polarization .",
    "to improve sensitivity to faint signals , the reduced images presented in this paper were adaptively smoothed by convolution with a 3-resolution - element wide gaussian in regions with signal to noise ( s / n ) @xmath21 1 per pixel , decreasing to one resolution element wide for @xmath22s / n @xmath23 , and no smoothing for pixels with s / n @xmath24 10 .",
    "the near - ir total intensity images are shown in figure 1 ( top row ) , along with the linear polarized intensities @xmath25 , where @xmath26 and @xmath20 are the usual stokes parameters .",
    "these observations were taken on 2005 nov 23 , during a period of unseasonably warm weather and good seeing : fried s parameter @xmath27 was 15 - 20 cm that night .",
    "for mwc 778 , our total exposure times in @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath18 bands were 720 s , 640 s , and 390 s , respectively .",

    "because mwc 778 itself is resolved , we can not measure psf strehl ratios directly on it , and the nearby star to the northwest is also unsuitable due to the spatially - variable bright nebulosity behind it . as a proxy , we measured the strehl ratio for an unresolved star of comparable brightness observed with lgs ao immediately after mwc 778 ( pds 211 , @xmath30=13.7 ) , and found strehl ratios of @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 for @xmath17 and @xmath18 respectively , corresponding to 400 - 500 nm rms wavefront error . for photometric calibration",
    "we observed the standard s852-c @xcite shortly after mwc 778 .",
    "our images reveal a bright point source surrounded by fainter extended nebulosity filling most of our 12@xmath3420  field of view ( see  [ results_sect ] ) .",
    "we performed aperture photometry around mwc 778 using both 1  and 6  radius apertures to estimate the flux from the central bright region alone and the whole observed nebula , respectively ( table [ photom_table ] ) .",
    "there were intermittent cirrus clouds that night , but we observed mwc 778 during a clear period , and our derived photometry is in excellent agreement with that of hv08 taken one month earlier , suggesting that the cirrus did not adversely impact these data .",
    "we caution that even the 6  radius does not include the _ entire _ nebula , only the portion visible within our 12-wide field of view . in the 2mass atlas images ,",
    "the nebula around mwc 778 is seen to extend at least 20  from the star , and in deeper images would likely appear comparable in size to the @xmath35 nebula shown in hv08 , @xmath36 arcmin across .",
    "mid - infrared images of mwc 778 at @xmath37 and @xmath38 microns ( @xmath39 and @xmath40 bands ) were obtained at gemini north on 2005 dec 16 using the mid - infrared imager / echelle spectrometer ( michelle ) instrument @xcite as part of program gn-2005b - c-4 .",

    ", these images were adaptively smoothed by convolution with a 3-resolution - element wide gaussian in regions with s / n @xmath21 1 per pixel , decreasing to one resolution element wide for @xmath44 s / n @xmath23 , and no smoothing for pixels with s / n @xmath24 10 . photometry was performed on the unsmoothed data , using for consistency the same 1  and 6  apertures as were used for the near - ir data .",
    "( see table [ photom_table ] ) .",
    "we note that the emission observed in @xmath39 actually extends beyond the 6  aperture , primarily in the form of an arc of emission east of mwc 778 just outside the aperture .",
    "there is approximately 0.3 jy of emission from that region in @xmath39 . along the chopping position angle of 30@xmath45 ,",
    "no mid - ir nebulosity is visible beyond @xmath46 radius at our sensitivity , so the 15  chop throw does not result in any self - subtraction of the nebula .",
    "immediately around mwc 778 , the near - ir polarization maps reveal two bright lobes bisected by a narrow dark lane with a position angle of @xmath47 .",
    "the dark lane is slightly curved , with the concave side facing northwest . on that side , the bright northwest nebulosity further splits into two fans of light separated by a region of lower polarization .",
    "the polarization vectors are centrosymmetric throughout , indicating that the observed structure is a reflection nebula illuminated by mwc 778 .",
    "this region is embedded in a larger spiral - shaped nebula , which we discuss below ; here we concentrate on the central portion .",
    "the observed dark lane is the characteristic signature of a nearly edge - on circumstellar disk , while the partially - divided northwest nebulosity suggests the limb - brightened edges of a conical cavity in a circumstellar envelope , cleared by bipolar outflows .",
    "overall , mwc 778 bears a striking resemblance to several other young stars known to have nearly - edge - on disks and envelopes with bipolar cavities , for instance lkh@xmath4 233 ( perrin et  al .",
    "2004a ) . based in part on discrepancies between optical spectra of mwc 778 and the nearby nebulosity ,",
    "hv08 inferred the presence of an inclined disk around the star , with its rotational axis pointing to the northwest .",
    "we confirm here that suggestion via direct detection of the disk in our polarization maps .",
    "the observed rotational axis of the disk agrees with that suggested by hv08 .",
    "the position of peak intensity in the total intensity images is shifted about 0.2  ( 1 resolution element ) northwest from the center of the dark lane .",
    "this displacement toward the northwest indicates that side of the disk is tipped slightly toward us .",
    "the slight curvature of the central dark lane confirms this interpretation : mwc 778 s disk is nearly edge - on , but not perfectly so , or it would obscure the central star entirely and the dark lane would be straight .",
    "the precise amount of inclination consistent with the observations depends on the disk s structure , such as the amount of flaring , which we currently can not constrain .",
    "however , it seems probable that the disk is inclined roughly 70 - 80  to our line of sight , such that the star is just barely visible around the obscuring disk .",
    "the central intensity peak is significantly polarized , @xmath48 at @xmath29 , which suggests that in fact we see the star in light scattered around the disk s edge rather than directly .",
    "the apparent polarization fraction rises both at longer wavelengths and with increasing distance from the star .",
    "for instance , in the bright part of the southeastern nebula , about 1.5  from the star , the @xmath49 polarization fractions are @xmath50 and @xmath51 respectively , while in the curved region 4  northwest of the star , the polarization fractions are @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "however , within the central arcsecond on both sides of the dark lane , the polarization fraction stays approximately constant with wavelength at @xmath54 . at face value , this may suggest different dust grain properties closer to the star , as would be expected from collisional aggregation of larger particles .",
    "but it is hard to accurately measure polarization fractions with ao data , given the contamination from uncorrected stellar light in the ao psf halo , so these numbers should be considered cautiously .",

    "can be seen , but it is partially obscured by the bright central point source .",
    "we therefore subtracted the central source using scaled copies of a psf reference star observed immediately after mwc 778 ( figure [ mirsub ] ) .",
    "the psf was aligned with the position of the central peak as measured by fitting 2d gaussians to both , and the overall flux scaling was iteratively adjusted to remove the central peak without oversubtracting the surrounding nebulosity .",
    "the optimal flux scalings found this way are not particularly precise ( and in fact are somewhat subjective ) , but the basic result holds true for a wide range of psf scalings , as shown in figure [ mirsub ] : subtracting the central psf reveals a dark lane in both the @xmath39 and @xmath40 images , with the same orientation and scale as that seen in the near - ir .",
    "the optical depth in the disk midplane must be sufficient to cause appreciable extinction even at 18 @xmath55 m , implying @xmath56 mag .  in visible light in the disk midplane .",
    "the light we see at short wavelengths must scatter out around the disk through paths of much lower extinction .",
    "we caution that the point - source fluxes found in this manner , 2.1 jy for @xmath39 and 3.4 jy for @xmath40 , almost certainly do not represent the photospheric intensity of the central star . thermal emission from a circumstellar disk on scales of @xmath57 au would be unresolved by these observations .",
    "the observed flux levels are far in excess of the expected photospheric flux of any plausible central star , leading us to conclude that in these point sources we are most likely observing thermal emission from the hot inner disk .",
    "the dark lane extends outward for @xmath58 on either side of the star in the near - ir , and almost as far in the mid - ir , corresponding to a physical radius of @xmath59 au for an assumed distance of 1 kpc .",
    "this is similar in size to other spatially - resolved disks around herbig ae / be stars ( e.g. 800 au for hd 141569 , @xcite ; 1000 au for lkh@xmath4 233 , @xcite ; 1100 au for mwc 480 , @xcite ) .",
    "the thickness of the dark lane increases with radius from the star : in the near - ir close to the center , the apparent thickness is @xmath60 ( about 1 resolution element ) , but at a radius of 0.7  the thickness has increased to 0.5 - 0.6 .",
    "does the observed extent of the dark lane correspond to the physical diameter of the disk , or are we instead seeing a large shadow cast by a much smaller disk ?",
    "in their detailed study of disk shadows , pontoppidan et al .",
    "( 2005 ) wrote that the `` most important difference between dark lanes due to extinction from a large disk and the dark lanes due to projection is that the former are expected to be entirely dark while the latter will still have a bright source in the center of the system ... [ for a disk shadow falling on a screen ] a dark band should be seen but with a central near - infrared compact source in the center .",
    "the presented model never produces a disk shadow without the central source being at least as bright as the reflecting material . '' in the case of mwc 778 , no bright point source is visible _ within _ the dark lane at any wavelength .",
    "instead the bright psf peak is offset northwest outside of the dark lane at all wavelengths , consistent with light scattering around the edge of an optically thick disk .",
    "hence we conclude that the observed morphology is primarily due to a physically large disk with apparent angular radius @xmath61 , rather than shadowing from a much smaller disk .      on larger scales the polarized intensity maps and mid - infrared images exhibit a pair of curving `` spiral arms '' that wrap counterclockwise around the central disk .",
    "this is an infrared counterpart to the `` reverse question mark''-shaped dark lane hv08 saw image ( see their fig .  1 ) .",
    "this image reveals a faint , diffuse , `` spiral '' feature beginning almost due west ( pa=270 ) of mwc 778 and extending nearly an arcminute from mwc 778 while wrapping 90  around the source to end at pa=0 .",
    "it is not clear if there is any connection between the two spiral features . ] in their h@xmath4 image ; the spiral arms we see in the near- and mid - infrared are coincident with the bright outline of the `` question mark '' , while the darker region inwards of the spiral forms the `` question mark '' itself .",
    "although this overall structure can be discerned in total intensity images , particularly in our @xmath18 and @xmath39 images and the h@xmath4 image of hv08 , it is especially prominent in our linear polarization maps ( figure 1 ) .",
    "the spiral is asymmetric : the southeastern arm is both shorter and more tightly curved than the northwestern arm .",
    "it appears to have a distinct corner about 3.5  southwest of the star , a sharp feature also clearly seen in the @xmath39 image .",
    "the southeast arm trails off about 6  from the star at pa=195 , while the opposite northwest arm fades out in our near - ir images around @xmath62 , pa=15 . that places its apparent termination almost exactly 180  opposite the end of the southern arm , though a bit more distant from the star .    our mid - infrared images and the h@xmath4 images of hv08 ( see their fig",
    "3 ) show that this `` northwestern '' spiral arm in fact continues onward to wrap nearly @xmath63 around the source , albeit at reduced brightness for much of that arc .",
    "it becomes brighter again in a region @xmath64 to the e of mwc 778 , seen prominently in the h@xmath4 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 images .",
    "this bright region is mostly outside the field of view of our near - ir images , but can partially be seen at the extreme southeast corner of the polarized intensity maps .",
    "curiously , near the base of the northwestern arm a partial gap can be seen , a region of reduced polarized intensity between @xmath65  from the star .",
    "no similar gap is seen in the southeastern arm .",
    "we discuss possible explanations for this spiral structure in  5.2 below .",

    "neither of these stars are visible in our mid - ir data .",
    "it remains unknown whether these are physically associated young stars or merely foreground objects .",

    "our observations resolve the disk and bipolar envelope with precisely the orientation claimed by hv08 , and confirm their interpretation is correct .",
    "but many other questions still remain open about mwc 778 .",
    "one of the most fundamental questions is the distance , which remains very uncertain .",
    "the value of 1 kpc adopted by hv08 was based on distances to a handful of other clouds and star forming regions in that part of the sky , ranging from 0.4 to 2 kpc , despite the fact that mwc 778 is not known to be physically associated with any of those clouds .",

    "3 . the spectrum of mwc 778 itself shows absorption lines indicative of a relatively cool spectral type ( e.g. , , ) , and lacks any absorption lines ( e.g.  and ) that would indicate the presence of an ob star capable of photoionizing the nebula .",
    "an additional piece of circumstantial evidence against ic 2144 being an emission nebula is that it was not detected in a vla survey of candidate  regions at 5 ghz by fich ( 1993 ) , implying an upper limit to free - free emission from ionized gas of @xmath70 mjy , versus 50-@xmath71 mjy for typical  regions detected in that survey .",
    "together these facts provide strong evidence that the optical nebula is seen in reflected starlight .",
    "the centrosymmetric polarization pattern we observe now establishes unambiguously that ic 2144 is primarily a reflection nebula illuminated by mwc 778 .",
    "our measurement directly confirms this at near - infrared wavelengths , and in combination with the spectral information from hv08 ( particularly the lack of [ ] emission and the width of the h@xmath4 line ) we conclude that the optical nebula almost certainly has its origins in reflection as well",
    ". it would be straightforward to confirm this through optical imaging polarimetry of ic 2144 , or flux - calibrated narrow - band imaging in h@xmath4 and an adjacent continuum filter .",
    "the mechanism creating the extended mid - infrared light is less clear .",
    "scattered light may still be a significant , perhaps dominant , effect , but we can not rule out contributions by thermal emission from transiently heated dust grains or fluorescent emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons .",
    "mid - ir spectroscopy of the extended nebula would allow the nature of the emission there to be determined .      based on its spectrum showing many emission lines indicative of accretion plus absorption from lithium ( hv08 ) , the presence of extensive surrounding nebulosity , and the fact that its sed is still rising past 60 microns",
    ", mwc 778 appears to be a young star . we can attempt to determine its nature more precisely by inferring its position along pre - main - sequence evolutionary tracks based on its observed properties , but the large uncertainty in its distance prevents us from unambiguously placing mwc 778 on such tracks .    using their estimated 1 kpc distance , hv08 integrated mwc 778 s sed to obtain a bolometric luminosity of @xmath72 , in agreement with previous estimates ( see  2 ) .",
    "however , the presence of the disk implies that the source suffers more extinction than was assumed by hv08 .",
    "in fact the total extinction around the star must depend on the line of sight , from hundreds of magnitudes directly through the disk midplane to only a few magnitudes or less for light scattering out along the polar cavities .",
    "( thus our statement in  [ results_disk ] of @xmath56 in the midplane is not incompatible with hv08 s estimated @xmath73 in total integrated light , since the latter was derived from the relative strengths of emission lines seen in light that presumably traveled through low extinction regions . )",
    "@xcite computed model seds for class i ysos surrounded by disks plus bipolar envelopes ( like mwc 778 ) , and found that over a wide range of inclinations the true bolometric luminosity was typically @xmath74 the observed luminosity .",
    "if we correct for mwc 778 s non - isotropic radiation using this factor , its bolometric luminosity increases to @xmath75 or more . because the total amount of extinction is uncertain ,",
    "this should be taken as a lower limit : luminosity correction factors of @xmath76 or higher have been derived for other disk+bipolar envelope systems ( e.g. perrin et al .",
    "2007 ) , so it seems possible that mwc 778 s luminosity could be as high as several thousand @xmath3 .",
    "when combined with the f - g spectral type claimed by hv08 , a luminosity of @xmath77 presents a conundrum , as it is far larger than that of any other known imtts .",
    "that luminosity , along with an effective temperature of @xmath78 k ( for an f star ) , would place mwc 778 well above the birthline in the hr diagram expected for any intermediate mass stars @xcite .",
    "although the exact position of this stellar birthline varies depending on the protostellar mass accretion rate , there is no evidence that such rates are ever high enough to allow for a 750 @xmath3 f star ; the birthline appears to be a firm boundary on allowable stellar parameters ( palla 2005 ) .",
    "we thus must reject the notion that mwc 778 could really be a single f or g star with @xmath79 .",
    "a similar conclusion can be reached if we use the calibrations between br @xmath80 and pa @xmath81 luminosities and accretion luminosity given by calvet et  al .",
    "( 2000 , 2004 ) .",
    "the observed line luminosities of mwc 778 from hv08 yield a lower limit to the accretion luminosity of @xmath82 .",
    "this is several times larger than accretion luminosities measured for even the most luminous objects in the calvet et al .",
    "( 2004 ) sample of imtts , again indicating an alternate explanation for mwc 778 must be sought .",
    "the high total and accretion luminosities could instead be consistent with mwc 778 being a herbig be star around @xmath83 . indeed , most claimed spectral types for mwc 778 prior to hv08 were of type b ( b1?e , vieira et  al .  2003 ; bq [  ] , surez et  al .",
    "2006 ) , and similar emission - line - dominated spectra are seen for be stars such as lkha 101 or mwc 1080 . in hv08 s data , mwc 778 does not show any absorption lines such as  which would indicate the presence of an ob star ( though emission features could potentially hide such lines ) .",
    "the fact that ic 2144 is a reflection nebula , not a photoionized hii region , places an upper limit on the amount of ionizing flux which could be present , inconsistent with spectral types hotter than b1 , but we can not rule out a mid - b star on this basis .",
    "nevertheless , hv08 unambiguously detected optical absorption lines such as ca i 6102.72  , fe i 6136.63/6137.70 and li 6707  , which require cooler temperatures consistent with f - g spectral type and inconsistent with classification as a be .",
    "the @xmath84 of those features is @xmath85 km s@xmath86 , a typical value for an f5 star but much less than would be expected for any b or a star seen at high inclination ( @xmath87 km s@xmath86 ) .",
    "the observed features are shallow , suggesting veiling , but their detection is clear and any model of mwc 778 must account for them",
    ".    there are ( at least ) three possible explanations for the apparent discrepancy between mwc 778 s large bolometric luminosity and the presence of metallic absorption lines that suggest a late spectral type : ( 1 ) the first and simplest explanation is that the distance is not 1 kpc , hence the luminosity is wrong ; ( 2 ) alternately , the absorption lines reported by hv08 may arise from the atmosphere of the accretion disk , rather than the stellar photosphere , hence the spectral type is wrong ; ( 3 ) the source may be a binary system consisting of a b - type star and an f - type star .",
    "we now consider each of these in turn .",
    "if we invoke a smaller distance , how close could it plausibly be ?",
    "a potential lower limit comes from the fact that based on projected stellar densities , ic 2144 appears to be more distant than the cloud containing rr tau at 380 pc ( see hv08 ",
    "if the distance to mwc 778 is actually 500 pc , rather than 1 kpc , the luminosity decreases to  180 @xmath3 ( and the disk radius would decrease to about 600 au ) .",
    "the observed absorption line depths are shallow , consistent with additional continuum veiling @xmath88 greater than the intrinsic stellar photosphere ( see figure 7 in hv08 ) .",
    "this would reduce the actual stellar luminosity to about 45 @xmath3 , approximately in line with that expected for a f - type imtts or a herbig ae star near the birth line .",
    "but a non - stellar origin for the absorption spectra may offer an equally plausible means of reconciling the observed luminosity and spectrum .",
    "if mwc 778 is an early to mid - type be star , surrounded by a protoplanetary disk with a nearly edge - on inclination , light reaching us must propagate nearly parallel to the disk s surface , and indeed must scatter from dust in the optically thin surface layers to produce the observed polarization .",
    "since this propagation path passes through gas as well as dust , the former will produce absorption lines in the spectra . to impose f / g type absorption lines on an originally near - featureless be star spectrum requires gas temperatures of several thousand degrees , several times larger than the expected dust destruction temperature .",
    "however , @xcite showed that the gas and dust temperatures decouple in a protoplanetary disk s upper atmosphere , and that the gas between the dust disk s surface and a few au above the disk can be as hot as @xmath71 k at distances of tens of au from a t tauri star .",
    "a similar disk atmosphere model would need to be calculated for a be star to investigate whether a sufficient optical depth of gas at @xmath89k could be available in the disk atmosphere of mwc 778 to produce the observed lines . in this scenario",
    ", the 30 km@xmath86 widths of the absorption lines would be due to the superposition of light scattered toward us from multiple portions of the rotating disk , each with its own keplerian velocity relative to us .    finally , it is possible that mwc 778 is a binary system , consisting of a b star and an f star , similar to z cma ( e.g. , whitney et al .",
    "the high resolution optical spectra obtained by hv08 reveal no evidence of velocity shifts in the absorption lines due to orbital motions , but the signal - to - noise ratio of these features is low , and the upper limit on any velocity shifts is large ( @xmath23 km / s ; herbig , private communication ) . to investigate how detectable binarity",
    "would be given hv08 s two spectroscopic observations separated by about one year , we performed monte carlo simulations of binary systems with a @xmath90 primary and an inclination of @xmath91 , for companion masses ranging from the substellar mass limit to @xmath92 , under the assumption that the observed absorption lines arise in the atmosphere of the lower - mass component .",
    "these simulations indicate that the observations of hv08 would have detected line shifts of @xmath93 10 km s@xmath86 with a probability of @xmath94 if there existed any companion with a semi - major axis @xmath95 au , roughly independent of companion mass .",
    "therefore we can rule out such a close binary in mwc 778 .",
    "however , the existing observations have only a probability of @xmath69 of detecting any binary companion with @xmath96 au , and are completely insensitive to binaries with larger semi - major axes @xmath97 au .",
    "examination of the evolutionary tracks by palla & stahler ( 1990 ) indicate that a binary system consisting of a late b star and an early f star in which both stars sit on the birth line could just produce the estimated luminosity for mwc 778 .",
    "such a system would have approximately the correct secondary - to - primary flux ratio ( @xmath98 , based on hv08 s observation that the f - type metal absorption lines are about a factor of 3 - 4 weaker than expected from a normal f star ) .",
    "however this is the largest luminosity such a binary could have ; as soon as the stars age and move off the birth line , the total luminosity drops precipitously . for an age of 1 myr , such a system",
    "would be expected to have a total luminosity of only @xmath99 . in short ,",
    "a b star + f star binary system could explain the observed properties of mwc 778 only if either the system is extremely young ( @xmath100 myr ) or , as above , it is much closer than 1 kpc in addition to being a binary .",
    "hv08 conjectured that the `` reverse question mark''-shaped dark lane they observed in h@xmath4 might be due to dust obscuration in front of the background nebula .",
    "we now see that the optical dark lane corresponds to the un - illuminated region adjacent to the spiral nebula seen in our infrared data .",
    "given the much greater penetrating power of 10 - 20 @xmath55 m radiation compared to visible light , producing the observed spiral pattern with a foreground dust cloud would require that cloud to both be very dense ( to provide sufficient opacity at @xmath26 band ) and have very sharply defined edges ( so that the apparent spiral does not change in position or size with wavelength ) .",
    "that scenario is not impossible , but would require some fine - tuning of the dust cloud s properties .",
    "we may instead be looking at an actual physical structure rather than a line - of - sight superposition . in that case",
    ", it remains unclear what the spiral s origin might be .",
    "spiral density waves within circumstellar disks have now been observed around many ysos ( e.g. ab aur , @xcite ; hd 141569 , @xcite ; hd 142527 , @xcite ) , and are widely interpreted to be caused by the gravitational effects of orbiting companions . since mwc 778 may well be a binary system , this seems at first to be an attractive explanation .",
    "but mwc 778 s spiral differs from those seen around typical herbig ae / be stars in several significant ways . first",
    ", it is much larger .",
    "spiral structures , such as in the disks around ab aur and hd 141569 , are typically observed on a scale of 100 - 300 au .",
    "in contrast , if mwc 778 truly is about 1 kpc distant , then the observed spiral is at least 12,000 au across ! even more significantly ,",
    "the spiral is not part of the circumstellar disk plane but instead appears to be oriented perpendicular to it .",
    "it is highly unlikely that a binary system whose orbital plane is aligned with the observed disk could produce a spiral with this orientation .    instead of being part of the disk , the inner portions of the spiral",
    "apparently connect to mwc 778 s polar axis , aligned with the bipolar cavities there .",
    "for some ysos , precessing outflows have carved corkscrew - like bipolar cavities in their envelopes . yet invoking outflows to carve the spiral around mwc 778 would require sufficient precession to turn the entire inner disk almost end - over - end in an impossibly short period of time ( @xmath101 years , for an observed size of 12000 au and typical outflow velocities of 100 km / s ) .",
    "it is hard to see how this could be the case .    an alternate explanation for the spiral would be to invoke turbulence in molecular clouds , which is believed to create localized overdensities that can become unstable and collapse , leading to star formation .",
    "the curving nebula might then represent a residual filament of compressed material , which gave birth to the star but has not yet dispersed .",
    "a similar explanation has been suggested for several binary ysos which appear to be linked by bridges of material : e.g. , lkh@xmath4 225 @xcite or sr 24 @xcite . such a scenario would imply that the roughly symmetrical spiral appearance around mwc 778 is just a matter of chance .",
    "near - infrared polarimetric and mid - infrared imaging observations of the young stellar object mwc 778 have revealed a nearly - edge - on circumstellar disk plus bipolar outflow cavities , confirming the hypothesis advanced by hv08 on the basis of their spectra of the star and its nearby nebulosity .",
    "the images also reveal a large and intriguing spiral structure surrounding the star , prominent in all of the h@xmath4 , near- and mid - infrared images . because it appears to be oriented perpendicularly to the circumstellar disk plane , it is difficult to explain this as a spiral density wave similar to those seen in disks around many other young stars .",
    "the nature of this feature is currently unknown .",
    "the presence of a disk suggests that previous values for the luminosity of the source may be underestimates ; after correction for light blocked by the disk , the total bolometric luminosity at the assumed distance of 1 kpc now becomes at least @xmath102 .",
    "this leads to a paradox : that luminosity is far too large for the late - type spectral type derived by hv08 based on absorption features seen in the optical . even the most luminous young f- and g - type stars , the intermediate mass t tauri stars ,",
    "are not expected to have luminosities in excess of @xmath103 .",
    "we have suggested several possibilities to resolve this discrepancy : ( 1 ) the distance to mwc 778 may be vastly over - estimated , and it is really an imtts at a distance of a few hundred pc instead of 1 kpc ; ( 2 ) the f - g - type absorption features may arise from the atmosphere of the circumstellar disk rather than the stellar photosphere , in which case the star itself becomes most plausibly a young be star ; ( 3 ) the system may actually be a binary composed of a b star and an f star .",
    "the currently available data do not allow us to determine which of these possibilities is correct , and in fact they are not mutually exclusive .",
    "how might we test any of these hypotheses for the central source ?",
    "the highest priority may be further spectroscopic observations , both to obtain increased temporal coverage in search of radial velocity variations from orbital motion , and to obtain higher signal - to - noise on the various absorption features to better constrain the apparent spectral type . given the faintness of this source in the optical ( @xmath104 ) such observations will be challenging .",
    "further observations of the disk may provide indirect constraints on the stellar properties .",
    "mapping the region in molecular emission lines ( e.g. co ) could detect keplerian rotation in the disk , providing kinematic constraints on the mass of the central object .",
    "tighter constraints on the maximum amount of ionizing radiation present could potentially be obtained through flux - calibrated h@xmath4 imaging  but such measurements would need to account for accretion luminosity and would be fraught with difficulties .",
    "lastly , deeper wide - field imaging in the infrared should be obtained in order to search for additional nearby embedded sources that might be present ; if any associated young but less deeply - embedded sources can be found , their properties may provide complimentary constraints on the distance .",
    "high contrast imaging observations are a powerful tool for investigating circumstellar environments and the physical processes at work therein , particularly when multiwavelength observations are available for analysis ( e.g. @xcite ) . the spatially resolved observations presented here are a first step towards applying such a `` pan - chromatic '' approach to the study of mwc 778 s disk . but",
    "detailed investigations of disk structure are unlikely to be fruitful without a better understanding of the illuminating source and the distance to the system . as is so often said , establishing accurate distances remains one of the most challenging tasks in astronomy  yet doing just that is likely a necessary first step in conclusively establishing the nature of mwc 778 .",

    "mdp thanks john monnier for useful discussions .",
