    "since the seminal paper by yang and mills  @xcite , the study of nonabelian gauge theories has attracted a lot of interest in several sectors of physics . focusing on the gauge theory of strong interactions ( qcd ) , thanks to improvement of computer facilities which allow to perform huge simulations of yang - mills theories , as well as to the possibility to create in laboratories extremely hot environments by means of heavy ion collisions , the interest in understanding the thermodynamical properties of strong nonabelian mediums has noticeably increased .",
    "lattice simulations of @xmath0 yang - mills theories have been performed , see for example refs .",
    "all of these studies agree about the onset of the deconfinenemt phase transition at @xmath2 mev .",
    "below @xmath3 , the thermodynamics of the yang - mills theory is dominated by the lowest lying glueballs . for what concerns",
    "the high temperature phase , the picture is not so clear . as a matter of fact , one of the most intriguing aspects is the nonperturbative nature of the gluon medium above the critical temperature @xcite .",
    "for example , in  @xcite it is pointed out that the perturbative regime is realized for temperatures @xmath4 ( more concretely , at @xmath5 both pressure and energy density are below the stefan - boltzmann limit , which corresponds to the ideal gas case , by about @xmath6 ) .",
    "this makes the identification of the correct degrees of freedom of the gluon plasma , in proximity as well as well beyond the critical temperature , a very complicated task .",
    "resummation schemes have been proposed , based for example on the hard thermal loop ( htl ) approach  @xcite . more recently within a nnlo in the htl perturbation theory @xcite it has been shown that an agreement with the lattice results can be obtained also for the trace anomaly down to @xmath7 but with large uncertainties . at these high temperatures ,",
    "the htl approach motivates and justifies a picture of weakly interacting quasi - particles , as determined by the htl propagators .    within this theoretical framework ,",
    "the quasiparticle approach to the thermodynamics of qcd has attracted a discreet interest recently , see for example refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein .",
    "in such an approach , one identifies the degrees of freedom of the deconfinement phase with transverse gluons ; the strong interaction in such a non perturbative regime is taken into account through an effective temperature - dependent mass for the gluons themselves .",
    "this theoretical approach is similar to the one introduced by landau  @xcite to describe strongly correlated systems . generally speaking ,",
    "it is not possible to compute the self - energy of gluons exactly in the range of temperature of interest ; as an obvious consequence , the location of the poles of the propagator in the complex momentum plane , hence ( roughly speaking ) the gluon mass , is an unknown function .",
    "for this reason , one usually assumes an analytic dependence of the gluon mass on the temperature , leaving few free parameters which are then fixed by fitting the thermodynamical data of lattice simulations .",
    "the advantage of such an approach is , at least , twofolds .",
    "firstly , it is of a theoretical interest in itself to understand which are the effective degrees of freedom of the yang - mills theory at finite temperature and in particular the evolution of non perturbative effects with temperature .",
    "furthermore , once a microscopic description of the plasma is identified , it is also possible to include the implied dynamics into a transport theory capable to directly simulate the expanding fireball produced in heavy ion collisions computing the collective properties , as well as the chemical composition of the fireball as a function of time  @xcite .    in this article",
    "we extend the quasiparticle picture of the finite temperature gluon medium , by adding an interaction of gluons with a background polyakov loop .",
    "it is well known that the latter is an exact order parameter for the confinement - deconfinement transition in the pure gauge theory  @xcite .",
    "therefore , having access to the polyakov loop immediately leads us to the possibility to study the effect of the phase transition on the dynamical properties of gluons , mainly on their mass .",
    "the standard quasiparticle approach , instead , tries to account for all the dynamics only by mean of temperature dependent masses @xcite .",
    "this always leads to the necessity of diverging or steadily increasing masses as @xmath8 not only of the case of pure gauge theory , but also for the qcd case which includes quarks .",
    "we show that combining a t - dependent quasiparticle mass , @xmath9 , with the polyakov loop dynamics results in a quite different behavior of @xmath9 as @xmath8 .    the combined approach of the quasiparticle picture with the polyakov loop thermodynamics has been poorly investigated . to our knowledge",
    ", there is only a first preliminary study about the role of the polyakov loop in the context of the quasiparticle description of the gluon plasma  @xcite , which has some overlap with our study . in the present article",
    ", we take a simple matrix model action as the effective potential for the polyakov loop . then , we use the weiss mean field procedure to compute averages .",
    "such a procedure has been used in the study of the qcd phase diagram by means of the polyakov extended nambu - jona lasinio model  @xcite , see  @xcite . in the next section",
    "we describe the technical details , it suffices to say here that the main difference between this procedure and the one commonly used in the literature is that , in the former case , averages are computed in terms of integrals over the gauge group with the appropriate invariant gauge measure having the pure gauge mean field action as the integration weight",
    ". we can anticipate that in such a way we are not only able to reproduce the large trace anomaly , @xmath10 , with a quite good accuracy , but also identify the different roles of quasiparticles masses and polyakov loop in yang - mills thermodynamics .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we describe the matrix model in the weiss mean field potential and its coupling to quasiparticle masses , showing the explicit derivation for @xmath0 gauge group . in section iii , we compare the results of our approach to the lqcd thermodynamics discussing in particular the specific contributions to the pressure and to the interaction measure of the polyakov mean filed and of the quasiparticle masses . in section",
    "iv we draw first conclusions of our work along with future possible investigations and developments of the present approach .",
    "the system we consider in this article consists of a gas of gluon quasiparticles , propagating in a background of polyakov loop .",
    "the free energy of the model is expressed as a linear combination of two contributions : the first one describes the thermodynamics of the polyakov loop ; the second one , on the other hand , is the contribution of gluon quasiparticles coupled to the polyakov loop .",
    "we specify the two terms of the effective potential below .      in this section",
    "we follow closely the notations of  @xcite . the starting point is the action of a matrix model  @xcite , @xmath11 = -n_c^2 e^{-a / t}\\bm\\sum_{\\bm x,\\bm y } \\ell_f(\\bm x)\\ell_f^*(\\bm x + \\bm y)~ , \\label{eq : sc1}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 denote the lattice site and its nearest neighbors respectively .",

    "the average of an operator @xmath27 , namely @xmath28 , is defined as @xmath29e^{-s_{mf } } } { \\int\\bm\\prod_{\\bm x } dl(\\bm x ) e^{-s_{mf}}}~. \\label{eq : mf}\\ ] ]    the thermodynamic potential @xmath30 can be written by adding and subtracting the mean field action @xmath26 in the exponent of eq .  .",

    "equation   is exact . in the mean field approximation",
    ", we replace @xmath32 with @xmath33 . in this way",
    ", the thermodynamic potential depends explicitely on the mean fields @xmath25 , and their values are determined selfconsistently by the stationarity condition . in the mean field approximation the thermodynamic potential can thus be written as  @xcite @xmath34 \\nonumber \\\\ & & -\\log\\int dl~e^{n_c\\left[\\alpha\\re\\ell_f + i\\beta\\im\\ell_f\\right]}~. \\label{eq : mfw}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the previous equation , @xmath35 corresponds to the spacetime dimension , so that @xmath36 is the coordination number of the cubic lattice , that is the number of nearest neighbors of the site @xmath37 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath38 is the lattice spacing , and @xmath39 is the volume of the lattice ; as a consequence , @xmath40 is the number of lattice sites .",
    "the thermal average of the polyakov loop and of its conjugate are given by @xmath41 } { \\int dl~e^{n_c\\alpha\\re\\ell_f}\\cos(n_c\\beta\\im\\ell_f)}~,\\\\ \\langle\\ell_f^*\\rangle & = & \\frac{\\int dl~e^{n_c\\alpha\\re\\ell_f } \\left[\\cos(n_c\\beta\\im\\ell_f)\\re\\ell_f + \\sin(n_c\\beta\\im\\ell_f)\\im\\ell_f\\right ] } { \\int dl~e^{n_c\\alpha\\re\\ell_f}\\cos(n_c\\beta\\im\\ell_f)}~ ; \\label{eq : bla}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from the above equations it is then clear that @xmath42 and @xmath43 are different when @xmath44 .",
    "this happens for example in theories with fermions at finite baryon chemical potential .    in the following we focus on the case of the pure gauge theory , in which @xmath45 .",
    "we have thus @xmath46 , and eq .",
    "can be written as @xmath47   -\\log\\int dl~e^{n_c\\left[\\alpha \\re \\ell_f \\right]}\\right)~ , \\label{eq : mfwreal}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have used the shorthand notation @xmath48 . in the following , @xmath49 and @xmath50 in the above equation",
    "are treated as free parameters , which will be fixed , together with the remaining two parameters of the model which will be described in the next section , by a minimization procedure of the mean quadratic deviation between the theoretical computations and the lattice data or pressure , energy density and interaction measure . for the sake of future reference",
    ", we call the model described by the above thermodynamic potential as the pure matrix model ( pmm ) .      the gluon quasiparticle contribution to",
    "the thermodynamic potential reads  @xcite @xmath51 in the above equation , @xmath52 corresponds to the polyakov line in the adjoint representation , as defined in eq .  , and the trace is taken over the indices of the adjoint representation of the gauge group .",
    "moreover , the quasiparticle energy is given by @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is supposed to arise from non - perturbative medium effects .",
    "in the case of very high temperature , where the gauge theory is in the perturbative regime and thus @xmath55 , it can be proved that eq .",
    "is the effective potential for the adjoint polyakov loop  @xcite . at lower temperatures , where non - perturbative effects are important , eq .   must be postulated as a starting point for a phenomenological description of the thermodynamics of the gluon plasma . in this article , we make use of a temperature depentent mass whose analytic form is given by  @xcite @xmath56 ^ 2}~. \\label{eq : mass}\\ ] ] the parameters @xmath57 are determined by requiring that , for pressure and energy density , the mean quadratic deviation between our theoretical computation and the lattice data of  @xcite is a minimum . in particular , we find @xmath58 mev and @xmath59 , see section iii .",
    "the temperature dependent quasi - particle mass in eq .",
    "has several motivations : firstly , in the very large temperature regime in which qcd is perturbative , one has @xmath60 ; moreover , for @xmath61 close to @xmath3 there are remnants of the confining mechanism and , a priori , there is no reason to reduce these effects to the polyakov loop dynamics ; finally , for @xmath62 , the glueball mass decreases  @xcite , @xmath63 gev at @xmath64 , and in a valence gluon model one expects an effective mass of the quasiparticle @xmath65 mev at the melting temperature .    in order to have a combined description of the gluon plasma around the critical temperature , in terms of the polyakov loop ( which acts as a background field ) and of gluons quasiparticles ( which propagate in the polyakov loop background ) , we add eq .   to the strong coupling inspired potential in eq .  .",
    "in order to do this , and to be consistent at the same time with the weiss mean field procedure outlined above , we follow the lines of  @xcite and write the thermodynamic potential as @xmath66 where the average must be understood as defined in eq .  .",
    "in taking the average , we use the same approximation of  @xcite and write @xmath67 this approximation is also discussed in the appendix b of  @xcite , where it is proved that taking the average of the log ( that is , @xmath68 ) instead of the argument of the log , would lead to unphysical artifacts in the case the particles are taken in representations different from the fundamental one .",
    "we will discuss this aspect in more detail in the next section .",
    "in the case of the color group @xmath0 the polyakov line can be parametrized in terms of two angles , @xmath69 and @xmath70 , namely @xmath71 ; the invariant haar measure reads : @xmath72 ^ 2~ , \\label{eq : haarsu3}\\ ] ] with @xmath73 .",

    "as a result we find @xmath89 where we have defined @xmath90 and the @xmath91 denotes the average over the gauge group elements as defined as in eq .  .",
    "our expression for the functional determinant is in agreement with eq .",
    "( 4.5 ) of  @xcite , once we put @xmath92 and change @xmath93 in eq .   to take into account",
    "that in  @xcite , fermions in the adjoint representation are considered instead of bosons .",
    "it can be proved analitically that @xmath94 moreover , numerically we have checked that @xmath95    for the sake of reference , we write down the equation for the traced fundamental and adjoint polyakov loops in terms of the angles @xmath69 and @xmath70 , namely @xmath96 we have checked numerically that @xmath97 in the asymptotic limit @xmath98 and @xmath99 for @xmath100 ( the latter step can be proved analitically as well ) .",

    "implies that in the deconfinement phase , at very large temperature where @xmath102 , the thermal distribution of the quasigluons approaches that of a perfect gas of massive particles .",

    "this is interesting because it allows to understand which are the relevant degrees of freedom in the deconfinement phase of the theory .",
    "moreover , once the proper degrees of freedom are identified , the effective description studied here can be completed by adding dynamical quarks .",
    "employing a relativistic transport theory , this can allow also a direct connection between the developments of effective models and the study of the quark - gluon plasma created in relativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "within our model , we are able to reproduce fairly well the lattice data about the gluon plasma thermodynamics in the critical region .",
    "in particular , we reproduce the peak of the interaction measure within a 2% , see lower panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : compsu3 ] .",
    "one of the main conclusions of our work is that because of the coupling to the polyakov loop , a gluon mass of the order of the critical temperature , @xmath137 , is enough to reproduce the lattice data in the critical region .",
    "this is different from what is found in standard quasi - particle models .",
    "the polyakov loop is neglected and the gluon plasma is described in terms of a perfect gas of massive gluons . as a consequence ,",
    "a mass rapidly increasing with @xmath61 is needed to suppress pressure and energy density in the critical region . on the other hand , in the case studied in this article , the suppression of the pressure and energy density is mainly caused by the polyakov loop , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : yulia ] .",
    "therefore , lighter quasiparticles with a smooth @xmath138dependence describe fairly well the lattice data in the critical region .",
    "there are several interesting directions to follow to extend the present work .",
    "firstly , having in mind the study of the quark - gluon plasma , we plan to add dynamical massive quarks to the picture .",
    "it is also of a certain interest to span the parameter space in more detail , eventually analyzing several functional forms of the gluon mass .",
    "moreover , even in the case of the pure gauge theory , it would be interesting to investigate the way to adjust the interaction measure in order to reproduce lattice data in the regime of very large temperature .",
    "even more , it would be of a certain interest to extend our study to the case of different gauge groups .        c.  -n .",

    "<S> we study the interpretation of lattice data about the thermodynamics of the deconfinement phase of @xmath0 yang - mills theory , in terms of gluon quasiparticles propagating in a background of a polyakov loop . </S>",
    "<S> a potential for the polyakov loop , inspired by the strong coupling expansion of the qcd action , is introduced ; the polyakov loop is coupled to tranverse gluon quasiparticles by means of a gas - like effective potential . </S>",
    "<S> this study is useful to identify the effective degrees of freedom propagating in the gluon medium above the critical temperature . </S>",
    "<S> a main general finding is that a dominant part of the phase transition dynamics is accounted for by the polyakov loop dynamics , hence the thermodynamics can be described without the need for diverging or exponentially increasing quasiparticle masses as @xmath1 , at variance respect to standard quasiparticle models . </S>"
