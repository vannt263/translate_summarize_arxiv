    "this first series of exercises is made for training your practical comprehension of the link between the image space ( where you usually work ) and the fourier space ( where an interferometer produces its measurements ) .",
    "optical long - baseline interferometry experts constantly switches between fourier space and image space .",
    "this training will help one get used to this continuous switching .",
    "all exercises of this practice session will be done assuming a simple yet unrealistic @xmath0 coverage .",
    "synthetic @xmath0 tables simulating such @xmath0 coverages are provided for use : + ` strip-[j , h , k , n]-[000, .. ,170].uvt ` , where the number ` xxx ` is the projected baseline angle in degrees",
    ". ` aspro ` is able to do many things , but this session will focus on the _ model / fit _  -  _ uv plots and source modeling _ part .",
    "you will probably also need tables  [ tab4 ] and [ tab5 ] .    .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      if the reader has reached this point carried out all of the exercises without any problems , he is now an expert in long - baseline stellar interferometry and can do this exercise without any difficulty ;-)",
    "` aspro ` is an optical long - baseline stellar interferometry tool intended to help the observations preparation",
    ". one can find it on the website http://www.jmmc.fr .",
    "note that all exercises can be done at home with an internet connection , given that ` aspro ` can be launched via a java web interface .        1 .",
    "go to http://www.jmmc.fr 2 .",
    "select _ aspro applet_. a pop - up window should appear ( if not , please allow pop - up windows from http://www.jmmc.fr in your web browser ) .",
    "3 .   if you have a user account on the jmmc website , then just log in ; otherwise , uncheck the _ start application using my account information _ and proceed to the next step .",
    "4 .   in the _ start ... _ menu , select _ aspro_. 2 new windows should appear .",
    "5 .   the last step is to select the ` aspro ` version you want to use in the menu _",
    "choose ... _. here we will use the _ full aspro interface _ version .",
    "you will sometimes experience strange behavior such as non - responding buttons or a different response to what you expect .",
    "if you are in doubt , do not hesitate to quit ` aspro ` by clicking the _ exit _ button . if this button does not work either",
    ", you can still write ` exit ` in the command line , which will kill the gildas session ( and the ` aspro ` one at the same time ) ."

    "<S> the following exercises aim to learn the link between the object intensity distribution and the corresponding visibility curves of a long - baseline ptical interferometer . they are also intended to show the additional constraints on observability that an interferometer has .    </S>",
    "<S> this practical session is meant to be carried out with the ` aspro ` software , from the jean - marie mariotti center , but can also be done using other observation preparation software , such as viscalc from eso .    </S>",
