    "determinations of the cabbibo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) @xcite matrix elements provide important checks on the consistency of the standard model and ways to search for new physics .",
    "various methods using @xmath6 violation in @xmath7 decays have been proposed @xcite to measure the unitarity triangle angle @xmath0 .",
    "the sensitivity to the angle @xmath0 comes from the interference of two amplitudes producing opposite flavors of neutral @xmath1 meson .",
    "such a mixed state of neutral @xmath1 will be called @xmath8 .",
    "for example , in the case of @xmath9 decay , the mixed state is @xmath10 . here",
    "@xmath11 is the ratio of the suppressed and favored amplitudes ( it is expected to be of order of 0.10.3 ) , the total phase between the @xmath12 and @xmath13 is @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the strong phase difference between suppressed and favored decays .",
    "analogously , for the decay of @xmath16 , one can write @xmath17 with @xmath18 .    three body final states common to @xmath13 and @xmath19 , such as @xmath20 @xcite , have been suggested as promising modes for the extraction of @xmath0 .",
    "the dalitz plot density of @xmath8 gives immediate information about @xmath11 and @xmath21 , once the amplitude of the @xmath19 decay is known .",
    "the amplitude of the @xmath22 decay as a function of dalitz plot variables @xmath23 and @xmath24 is @xmath25 where @xmath26 is an amplitude of the @xmath27  decay .",
    "similarly , @xmath28 the @xmath27  decay model can be determined from a large sample of flavor - tagged @xmath27  decays produced in continuum @xmath29 annihilation .",
    "once that is known , a simultaneous fit of @xmath9 and @xmath16 data allows to separate the contributions of @xmath11 , @xmath0 and @xmath15 .",
    "refer to @xcite for a more detailed description of the technique .",
    "the method described can be applied to other modes as well as @xmath30  decay .",
    "excited states of neutral @xmath1 and @xmath31 mesons can also be used , although the values of @xmath15 and @xmath11 can differ for these decays .",
    "previously belle  @xcite and babar  @xcite collaborations have performed the analyses using this technique involving @xmath30  and @xmath32  decays .",
    "this paper describes the analysis using @xmath2  decay .",
    "we use a 253 fb@xmath3 data sample , corresponding to @xmath33 @xmath34 pairs , collected by the belle detector @xcite . the decay chain @xmath2  with @xmath35 and @xmath36 is selected for the analysis .",
    "the requirements on the quality of the charged tracks are the same as in our previous analysis @xcite .",
    "to select @xmath37 mesons , we require the invariant mass of @xmath38 to be within 50 mev/@xmath39 of its nominal mass . for the selection of neutral @xmath1 meson ,",
    "the invariant mass @xmath40 of its decay products is required to satisfy @xmath41 mev/@xmath39 .",
    "the selection of @xmath42 candidates is based on the center - of - mass ( cm ) energy difference @xmath43 and the beam - constrained @xmath42 meson mass @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the cm beam energy , and @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the cm energies and momenta of the @xmath42 candidate decay products .",
    "the requirements for signal candidates are @xmath48  gev/@xmath49 gev/@xmath39 and @xmath50 gev .    to suppress background from @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) continuum events , we require @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the angle between the thrust axis of the @xmath42 candidate daughters and that of the rest of the event .",
    "we also require the helicity angle of @xmath37 to be @xmath55 . for additional background rejection",
    ", we use a fisher discriminant composed of 11 parameters @xcite : the production angle of the @xmath42 candidate , the angle of the @xmath42 thrust axis relative to the beam axis and nine parameters representing the momentum flow in the event relative to the @xmath42 thrust axis in the cm frame .",
    "we apply a requirement on the fisher discriminant that retains 95% of the signal and rejects 30% of the remaining continuum background .    the @xmath2  selection efficiency ( 4.1% )",
    "is determined from a monte carlo ( mc ) simulation .",
    "the number of events passing all selection criteria is 56 .",
    "the @xmath56 and @xmath57 distributions for @xmath2  candidates are shown in fig .",
    "[ b2dks_sel ] .",
    "the background fraction is determined from a binned fit to the @xmath56 distribution , in which the signal is represented by a gaussian distribution with mean @xmath58 and the background is modeled by a linear function .",
    "the contributions in the signal region are found to be @xmath59 signal events and @xmath60 background events .",
    "the overall background fraction is @xmath61% .",
    "the dalitz plot distributions for the @xmath63  decay from @xmath64  are shown in fig .",
    "[ b2dks_plots ] .",
    "the dalitz plot fit procedure is similar to that used in our previous analysis @xcite .",
    "the model of @xmath27  decay is based on the 253 fb@xmath3 sample of continuum @xmath65  decays and is also the same as in our @xmath66  analysis .",
    "we consider three sources of background ( see table  [ bck_table ] ) , and determine the fraction and dalitz plot shape for each component .",
    "the largest contribution comes from two kinds of continuum events : random combinations of tracks , and correctly reconstructed neutral @xmath1 mesons combined with a random @xmath67 and a pion ( or a random @xmath37 ) .",
    "the fraction of candidates for these events is estimated to be @xmath68% using an event sample in which we make requirements that primarily select continuum events but reject @xmath34 events .",
    "the shapes of their dalitz plot distributions are parameterized by a third - order polynomial in the variables @xmath69 and @xmath70 for the combinatorial background component and a sum of @xmath13 and @xmath19 shapes for real neutral @xmath1 mesons combined with random @xmath67 and a pion .",
    ".fractions of different background sources . [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the uncertainty due to the model of @xmath13 decay is taken to be the same as for the @xmath66  processes .",
    "however , the analysis of @xmath2   has an additional uncertainty due to the possible presence of the nonresonant @xmath71  component , which can also be considered as a model uncertainty .",
    "since the nonresonant decay is described by the same set of diagrams as @xmath2 a similar @xmath6 violating effect should take place but , in general , with different @xmath11 and @xmath15 from the resonant mode .",
    "thus , for the @xmath0 measurement using @xmath2  mode alone , the contribution of @xmath71  decay can bias the fit parameters .",
    "to estimate the corresponding systematic uncertainty , we set an upper limit on the @xmath71  fraction , and perform a toy mc simulation with nonresonant contribution added to determine the fit bias .    to limit the fraction of the nonresonant component we search for a @xmath71  signal in the sidebands of the @xmath72 invariant mass distribution .",
    "since a specific final state of the neutral @xmath1 meson is not needed for this study , we combine several @xmath1 decay modes ( @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 ) to increase the statistics .",
    "no requirements on event shape parameters or @xmath72 helicity are applied .",
    "this allows to obtain a tighter upper limit on the @xmath71  contribution due to higher signal efficiency .",
    "the following ranges of @xmath72 invariant mass @xmath77 are analysed : @xmath78 mev/@xmath39 for @xmath2  events and @xmath79  mev/@xmath80 mev/@xmath39 for @xmath71 .",
    "the number of signal events is extracted from the fit to @xmath56 distribution .",
    "the fit function is a combination of a gaussian peak for the signal and a linear function for the background .",
    "the number of events in the @xmath72 sideband is @xmath81 .",
    "the number of events in the @xmath72 signal region is @xmath82 .",
    "taking into account the shape of @xmath83 invariant mass distribution , we obtain a @xmath71   fraction in our signal region of @xmath84% .",
    "the 95% confidence level ( cl ) upper limit on this fraction is 6.3% , which we use for estimation of the systematic error due to the nonresonant contribution .    to study this effect ,",
    "the dalitz plot of the @xmath8 decay is generated according to a decay amplitude with a component having different values of @xmath11 and @xmath15 , corresponding to the @xmath71  contribution , added coherently .",
    "the resulting dalitz plot distribution is then fitted with the standard technique , and the biases of the fit parameters @xmath11 , @xmath0 and @xmath15 are obtained .",
    "the fits are performed for different values of @xmath11 and @xmath15 for the nonresonant component and for different values of the relative phase between @xmath2  and @xmath71  amplitudes .",
    "the maximum bias of the fit parameters is taken as a corresponding systematic error .",
    "we obtain the following estimates of the uncertainty due to the @xmath71   contribution : @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 .",
    "we quote these errors separately from the other systematic uncertainties .",
    "the @xmath0 bias is significantly smaller than that for the strong phase @xmath15 , since @xmath0 is obtained from a difference of the total phases for @xmath9 and @xmath16 decays , and a part of the bias cancels in this case .    for the final results , we use the central values that are obtained by maximizing the pdf of the fitted parameters and the statistical errors corresponding to the 20% confidence region ( one standard deviation ) .",
    "of the two possible solutions ( @xmath0 , @xmath15 and @xmath88 , @xmath89 ) we choose the one with @xmath90 .",
    "the final results are @xmath91 the first error is statistical , the second is experimental systematics , the third is model uncertainty and the fourth is the error due to possible @xmath71  contribution . the two standard deviation interval including the systematic and model uncertainties is @xmath92 .",
    "the statistical significance of @xmath6 violation is 63% .",
    "we report results of a measurement of the unitarity triangle angle @xmath0 that uses a method based on a dalitz plot analysis of the three - body @xmath1 decay in the process @xmath2 .",
    "the measurement is based on a 253 fb@xmath3 data sample collected by the belle detector .",
    "we obtain the value of @xmath93 ( solution with @xmath90 ) .",
    "the first error is statistical , the second is experimental systematics , the third is model uncertainty and the fourth is the error due to possible @xmath71  contribution . the statistical significance of @xmath6 violation for the combined measurement is 63% .",
    "the method allows us to obtain a value of the amplitude ratio @xmath11 , which can be used in other @xmath0 measurements .",
