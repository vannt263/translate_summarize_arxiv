    "in principle , the energy green function @xmath0 contains all one ever needs to know about a stationary system . for example , in atomic systems , the green function gives the photoionization and photodetachment rate in the presence of electric and magnetic fields @xcite .",

    "the green function connects the transport of electrons through the system with the conductivity , and makes possible the determination of the microscopic electron flow . with the advent of imaging techniques which spatially resolve the electron flow on the nano scale ,",
    "the realistic modelling of a device , including charged gates , disorder potentials and screening , has become a necessity @xcite .    traditionally , green functions for mesoscopic systems demanded either a diagrammatic approach based on perturbation theory ( chap .  5 of @xcite ) or to connect leads to the scattering region to obtain the green function of the full system consisting of leads and scattering region by recursion ( chap .  3 of @xcite )",
    "the diagrammatic approach has the serious drawback that it is limited to the ensemble average of green functions for many realizations of the potential .",
    "the ensemble averaged current through a device is in general very different from the flow through a typical realization of the device .",
    "the green function for a single realization of the device , instead of an ensemble , has become central to many experiments .",
    "the recursive green function technique has serious limitations due to the attachment of waveguide - type leads to the system which have to be arranged colinearly with the scattering region ( the last condition can be relaxed by employing a smart reordering scheme based on graph theory @xcite ) .",
    "the approach presented in this paper permits us to obtain the green function for a single realization with high accuracy and short computational time  without the introduction of leads .",
    "our approach works for very general electron - sources attached to a device , i.e.  the injection of current to the two - dimensional electronic subsystem from a ( 3d ) reservoir through a tunneling contact ( somewhat similar to the current transport from the tip of a scanning tunneling microscope @xcite ) . also inner contacts ( which are used i.e.  in mach - zehnder interferometers in mesoscopic systems ) are possible to incorporate in the time - dependent method , as well as spin - orbit interactions .",
    "the green function contains the discrete eigenenergies @xmath1 and the continuous ones @xmath2 , and all eigenfunctions @xmath3 of the hamiltonian in a compact form : @xmath4 surprisingly , only very few energy - dependent green functions are known analytically , in contrast to a vast amount of available time - dependent propagators @xcite .",
    "the direct calculation of the green function for a given potential is generally not possible and perturbation expansions diverge .",
    "thus the spectral properties of many systems are unknown , even though they are very relevant for predicting and analyzing experimental results .",
    "one way of obtaining an energy green function is via fourier transform from the time domain@xcite .",
    "this can be done numerically , as it is always a one dimensional integral no matter how many degrees of freedom are present .",
    "however this method of obtaining the green function has not been fully exploited or explored . in this paper",
    ", we describe an approach for obtaining energy - dependent green functions via the time - dependent schrdinger equation . in sect .",
    "[ sec : tdse ] we establish the connection between the time - dependent schrdinger equation , the autocorrelation function of a wavepacket , and the energy - dependent green function .",

    "in the time - dependent formulation of quantum mechanics , the use of the propagator @xmath5 permits us to transform the partial differential time - dependent schrdinger equation for an initial quantum state @xmath6 into an integral equation : @xmath7 for a time - independent hamiltonian , we can set @xmath8 .",
    "the energy - dependent green function is tied to the time - dependent propagator @xmath5 via a laplace transform : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a small positive number , which selects the outgoing wave boundary condition at @xmath11 and thus the retarded green function .",
    "however , the laplace transform is seldomly used to obtain the green function analytically or numerically ( even if the propagator is known ) , since the propagator is a highly oscillatory function with additional singularities .    for hamiltonians which are polynomials of positions and momenta up to quadratic order",
    ", the time - dependent propagator assumes the form @xmath12,\\ ] ] where @xmath13 denotes the classical action , which is itself a maximally quadratic polynomial in positions .",
    "therefore it is possible to integrate eq .",
    "( [ eq : psiprop ] ) analytically for gaussian wavepackets in @xmath14 dimensions since all integrals involve gaussian functions . for",
    "non - quadratic hamiltonians , the analytic form of the propagator is in general not known .",
    "however , various methods have been developed to solve the time - dependent schrdinger equation numerically ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : dfft ] ) .",
    "the energy - dependent green function satisfies the inhomogeneous schrdinger equation @xmath15 g({{\\mathbf{r}}},{{\\mathbf{r}}}';e)=\\delta({{\\mathbf{r}}}-{{\\mathbf{r}}}')\\ ] ] with a @xmath16-distribution `` source''-term .",
    "if we specify as source - term a spatially extended wavepacket @xmath17 , we obtain the overlap of the green function with the state @xmath18 @xmath19 where @xmath20 denotes the autocorrelation function @xmath21 the green function for @xmath22 is obtained by replacing @xmath23 with another state @xmath24 centered around @xmath25 while keeping @xmath26 . in numerical calculations",
    "@xmath25 is a grid point of the discretized representation of the potential and of the wave functions ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : green ] ) ) .      the local density of states ( ldos ) at point @xmath11 is the imaginary part of the green function @xmath27 the definition of the ldos requires to use a @xmath16-distributed initial state , which can not be represented by a finite width wavepacket .",
    "this is an important technical point , requiring some care to handle correctly .",
    "essentially , a point source ( as in the coordinate space green function ) implies very high ( in fact infinite ) energy components , which are inconvenient and physically unimportant in a practical sense . in sect .",
    "[ sec : acc ] we discuss how to recover the green function from a finite width wavepacket propagation , to very high accuracy .",
    "in the following , we take as initial wavepacket in two dimensions a gaussian of the form @xmath28 . \\label{wp}\\ ] ] the probability density of this wavepacket is normalized to unity .",
    "we obtain the ldos in correct units , if we multiply the correlation function by @xmath29 where the first contribution is the switch of the normalization from unity of the modulus squared @xmath30 to the non - squared function @xmath31 , ( this in order to correspond to the delta function normalization of a coordinate state @xmath32 ) and the second factor originates from getting the imaginary part by using laplace transform .",

    "we separate the kinetic and potential energy terms using the baker - campbell - hausdorff series @xmath62 the symmetric distribution of @xmath63 cancels all terms of order @xmath64 and makes the approximation accurate up to order @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "the application of the kinetic energy operator @xmath66 to a wave function reduces to a multiplication if the wave function is given in momentum space , whereas the potential energy operator is a multiplication in position space .",
    "we denote the fourier transforms between position and momentum space by @xmath67 : @xmath68 combining @xmath59 consecutive steps and joining the half steps within the loop yields the solution of the time - dependent schrdinger equation @xmath69}^n { { \\rm e}}^{{{\\rm i}}\\delta t/\\hbar\\;v/2}\\psi({{\\mathbf{r}}},t').\\ ] ] numerically , the wave function is represented on a grid and the value of @xmath18 on the grid points is used to perform a discrete fast fourier transform ( dfft ) .",
    "since we apply the numerical wavepacket method also to systems where the wavepacket will eventually leave the initial region of the numerical grid - representation , we have to either move the fourier grid along with the center of the wavepacket or to remove the wavepacket at the borders of the region of interest .",
    "otherwise the dfft algorithm will let the wavepacket reappear at the other edge of the grid .",
    "the removal of the wavepacket in certain regions is achieved best by using a complex valued potential . by tracking the probability density ,",

    "in order to obtain the energy - dependent green function , we have discussed ways to largely remove the effect of wavepacket parameters , like the halfwidth @xmath34 of the initial wavepacket .",
    "however , it is also possible to retain the wavepacket properties and use them to model a certain occupation of initial energies . in the case of an adiabatic quantum point contact ( qpc ) with one open transverse mode , a thermal `` smokering '' wavepacket with an energy distribution matching the derivative of the fermi - dirac distribution @xmath114 replaces thermal averaging @xcite .",
    "it is interesting that higher temperatures are represented by more confined wavepackets in position space , which reduces interference effects due to the shorter wave train .",
    "when considering different modes of backscattering which reduce the net flux through the qpc , the question arises as to whether they can interfere .",
    "the answer is that they interfere only if the backscattered flux from the thermal wavepacket arrives at the qpc at the same time ( see fig .",
    "this is a form of `` white light interferometry '' .",
    "the thermal wavepacket approach permits a powerful intuitive picture and a simple estimation tool for understanding interference effects and electron choreography in small devices .",
    "the basic scenario is as follows : launched from just to the left of the qpc , a spatially narrow wavepacket emerges to the right , fanning out as part of an annulus , then suffering small angle scattering , splitting up into pieces due to collisions with large and small objects , walls , etc .",
    "the pieces will have the same width in their direction of travel as the original wavepacket ( unless the scattering is resonant and therefore time delaying ) .",
    "as the pieces arrive at the original qpc ( or another terminal ) the rule is simple : separate pieces of the wavepacket must arrive at the same time if they are to interfere .",
    "( if the pieces exit to a lead with several modes open , they interfere mode by mode ) .",
    "if an object which the wavepacket encounters is moveable , we may follow the oscillation ( in conductance ) as the interference of the objects phase changes from constructive to destructive and back to constructive as it is moved in certain directions .",
    "we have obtained the energy - dependent green function for general potentials via time - dependent wavepacket methods .",
    "the analytical solved cases allow to quantify and to minimize the error of the method due to the influence of wavepacket parameters .",
    "the wavepacket approach is especially useful for setups where periodic boundary conditions lead to non - physical results .",
    "the modelling of sources and sinks by complex potentials permits us to use very realistic potentials for devices and contacts and is at the same time efficient and fast .",
    "the time - dependent approach allows to postselect the energy ( one or several ) for which the energy - dependent green function is needed . in mesoscopic physics , the wavepacket green function describes transport in realistic nano device potentials and leads to new insights for the design and operation of future devices .",
    "a straightforward extension of the wavepacket methods allows one to include spin - orbit interactions by using two wavepackets corresponding to the two spin - components .",
