    "galaxy clusters serve as important cosmological probes as their formation and evolution rate depend on cosmological parameters and the kinematics of the dark matter .",
    "they are the observational counterparts of dark matter halos and their abundances and masses as a function of redshift are quite sensitive to the growth of structure in the universe offering a potentially powerful probe of dark energy @xcite",
    ". galaxy clusters also harbor a significant fraction of the visible baryons in the universe .",
    "hydrogen gas , heated as it falls into the dark - matter potential well of a cluster , forms an intracluster medium too hot to be bound by individual galaxies .",
    "the hot intracluster gas leaves an imprint on the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) though the sunyaev zeldovich effect ( sze ) @xcite in which cmb photons are inverse - compton scattered by the hot intracluster gas .",
    "it is this sze signal that two new ground - based mm - band telescopes , the atacama cosmology telescope ( act ) @xcite and the south pole telescope ( spt ) @xcite , have been designed to detect through its frequency - dependence : these experiments will measure intensity shifts shifts of the cmb radiation corresponding to a decrement below and an increment above the `` null '' frequency around 220  ghz .",
    "both telescopes are now actively acquiring data over large areas of the southern sky that will ultimately cover several hundreds to thousands of square degrees .",
    "recent results from the spt collaboration @xcite have yielded the first blind detection of sze clusters in one of the common southern survey regions centered near right ascension 05@xmath230@xmath3 and declination @xmath453@xmath5 .",
    "this area has also been scanned by act and has been optically imaged in the optical ( @xmath0 ) with the ctio blanco 4-m telescope as part of the blanco cosmology survey ( bcs ) @xcite .",
    "prompted by these results , here we present a detailed study of the physical properties of these first four sze - detected clusters based on publicly available optical imaging and archival x - ray data . throughout this paper",
    "we assume a flat cosmology with @xmath6  km  s@xmath7  mpc@xmath7 , @xmath8 and matter density @xmath9 .",
    "the positions of the four sze - selected clusters reported by the spt team are contained within the region surveyed by the bcs in 2005 and 2006 .",
    "these observations have been publically available for about a year or more now .",
    "we have processed and analyzed them using an independent software pipeline developed by us at rutgers university .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite where we provide a full description of the observing strategy , pipeline and data products and some results on new massive galaxy clusters discovered in the bcs survey field centered near 23hr . here",
    "we use the identical software pipeline to generate data products from which we characterize the optical properties of the four sze clusters .",
    "first , we identify the optical counterparts , which appear as clearly visible overdensities of early - type galaxies near the sky locations of the sze decrements ( see table  1 from @xcite ) . roughly centered within each overdensity",
    "is a bright elliptical , which we take to be the brightest cluster galaxy ( bcg ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : cplate ] we show the @xmath10 color images of the four systems , centered on the location of the bcg .",
    "each system shows a dominant population of early - type galaxies with very similar colors that can easily be identified by visual inspection . in all cases",
    "the offset between the bcg and the sze decrement , shown as red ellipses and green crosses respectively , is less than @xmath11  arcsec .",
    "we determine photometric redshifts from the four - band optical images using bpz @xcite following the same procedure as in @xcite .",
    "to avoid contamination by non - cluster members we use the bcg to estimate the photometric redshift of each system .",
    "the bcg is , by definition , indisputably part of the cluster , resides in a quasi - central location and always provides the strongest signal and the best colors since such galaxies are generally several times brighter than @xmath12 at any given redshift .",
    "moreover , the luminosities and particularly the colors of bcgs are well constrained as they are very bright elliptical galaxies dominated by old metal - rich stellar populations for which multi - color spectral energy distribution ( sed ) fitting techniques are well suited yielding precise and reliable results . in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : mag - z ]",
    "we show the output bpz photometric redshift probability density function ( pdf ) for each bcg .",
    "the differences between the bpz bayesian and maximum likelihood ( ml ) predicted redshifts are small ( @xmath13 ) in all cases and therefore we will employ ml photometric redshifts hereafter as the addition of a prior is not justified when , as is the case here , the bcg seds are fitted unambiguously .",
    "we note that occasionally bcgs host radio - loud active galactic nuclei @xcite .",
    "although we have no indication of this , if any of our bcgs do harbor agn then we would expect some blueing of the colors causing our photo - z s to be slightly over - estimated .",
    "only one of the clusters , spt - cl  0517@xmath45430 , has been previously reported ; it is the optically - rich cluster abell s0520 @xcite which is also the x - ray cluster rxc  j0516.6@xmath45430 @xcite .",
    "its published spectroscopic redshift of @xmath14 @xcite is in excellent agreement with our photometric redshift for that bcg , @xmath15 , but somewhat different from the value of @xmath16 quoted by @xcite for the cluster which came from the peak of their photo - z distribution of red - sequence galaxies using the same bcs imaging . in table",

    "the curve corresponds to the simple prescription @xmath23 where @xmath24 is taken from @xcite and the model includes passive evolution with redshift .",
    "we have extrapolated the sdss bcg luminosity model beyond @xmath25 as there is overwhelming evidence that ellipticals in clusters have passively evolved since @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "we see from the figure that in all cases the bcgs in the sze clusters are below the model curve ( i.e. , are intrinsically brighter ) and we take this as strong evidence in support of them being bona fide bcgs .",
    "it is worth noting that spt - cl  0509@xmath45342 at @xmath25 is the least luminous of the four , just slightly brighter than the luminosity predicted by the model .",
    "as we will see in the next section this cluster also has a lower mass and x - ray luminosity compared to the other systems . in figure",
    "[ fig : mag - z ] we also show the range of absolute magnitudes of the bcgs as a function of redshift . here",
    "we again see that spt - cl  0509@xmath45342 is the least luminous object , @xmath27 magnitude fainter than the other bcgs which all have about the same luminosity .",
    "the new sze experiments aim to deliver mass - selected samples of galaxy clusters out to large redshifts which can be used to probe the growth of structure in the universe and to study cluster physics .",
    "current n - body plus hydrodynamics simulations @xcite predict robust scaling relations between the sze signal ( i.e. , the @xmath28-distortion due to inverse compton scattering ) and cluster mass . however , a fundamental step before using sze clusters as cosmological probes is to observationally establish the relationship between @xmath28 and mass using mass estimates independent of the sze measurements .",
    "sze - selected clusters will almost surely be the focus of intense efforts to obtain mass estimates using x - ray images and spectra , weak and strong lensing and velocity dispersions . in the following ,",
    "we present the first independent mass estimates for these new sze - selected clusters from archival optical and x - ray data .",
    "here we use optically observed parameters of galaxies to predict the cluster mass from weak lensing richness - mass scaling relations established from the sdss @xcite .",

    "if we make the assumption that the two higher redshift clusters have luminosity functions that are similar to spt - cl  0517@xmath45430 at @xmath39 , then we estimate that we are missing 15% and 58% of the luminosity for spt - cl  0528@xmath45300 and spt - cl  0547@xmath45345 respectively .",
