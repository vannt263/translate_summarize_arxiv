    "a medium composed of three - level atoms in @xmath0 configuration ( two ground states , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , dipole - coupled to an excited state @xmath3 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : atomo ] ) can be rendered transparent using a technique known as electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) .",
    "we will call the field mode coupling states @xmath2 and @xmath3 the probe field and the field mode coupling states @xmath1 and @xmath3 the control field . in the usual eit configuration",
    "the probe field is weak compared with the control field , which , in turn , is in resonance with the transition frequency between states @xmath1 and @xmath3 .",
    "we denote by @xmath4 the detuning of the probe field from resonance with respect to the transition frequency between states @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the range of frequency detunings , @xmath4 , where absorption of the probe field by the medium is negligible is known as the transparency window ; its size is proportional to the control field .",
    "the appearance of this transparency window using the control field is known as electromagnetically induced transparency ; see fig .  [",
    "fig : absorption ] for an example of the typical absorption spectrum of a probe field interacting with atoms showing eit . in ref .",
    "@xcite the fundamentals of eit are explained in detail .",
    "the probe field inside a medium composed of several three - level atoms exhibiting eit propagates without distortion with a velocity that is a function of the control field @xcite ; this can be used to slow down the probe velocity as much as desired @xcite .    for an atom",
    ", the atomic wave function has a dependence on its position ; when dealing with pulse propagation inside a medium composed of atoms , we can ignore this dependence when the pulse size is much larger than the variance of the atomic position ; in this case only the expectation value of the atomic position enters the description and we say that we treat the atoms as point - like . the theory developed in ref .",
    "@xcite treats the atoms as point - like .",
    "when the atoms that compose the medium are in a bose - einstein condensate , they can not longer be treated as point - like . in this case the condensate wave function together with its dynamics have a strong effect on the probe field propagation as is shown through numerical simulations in ref .",
    "@xcite . to observe this effect",
    "it is necessary that the time during which the pulse interacts with the medium is larger than the time scale characterizing the condensate wave function dynamics .",
    "since a bose - einstein condensate has a well defined spatial phase relation , the system evolution does not necessarily decohere the information carried by the pulse , opening the possibility of using slow light and bec to manipulate optical information @xcite .",
    "the main question we address in this paper is : how does the evolution of the condensate wave function modify the propagating pulse ? we address it in a form where analytical results can be obtained . to solve this question we have to solve the gross - pitaevskii equations , describing the condensate evolution , together with the maxwell equations , describing the field propagation .",
    "we obtain a partial differential equation for the pulse propagation inside a bose - einstein condensate with atoms in @xmath0 configuration .",
    "this equation is much simpler than the set of equations that are usually used to find the pulse propagation and the condensate wave function .",
    "for some simple cases it can be solved analytically , showing explicitly how the different elements  probe pulse , control field and wave functions  interact and evolve .",
    "the equation is obtained using a weak probe and approximations similar to those made in ref .",

    "we write the solution in integral form .",
    "the evolution for the field looks similar to the evolution of the wave function for atoms in state @xmath1 , but with its potential being described in a reference system that moves with the pulse ; we use this similarity for analyzing the pulse propagation in the medium .",
    "a general overview of a three - level bose - einstein condensate interacting with two modes of the field is presented in section  [ sec : model ] , where known approximations are used to express the model in a simplified way . in section  [ sec : prop - equat - probe ] we obtain the propagation equation for the case of the probe pulse . in section  [ sec : slow - light - inside ] we study how the pulse propagates inside the condensate showing eit and discuss some physical implications derived from the analytic solution .",

    "we inserted spontaneous decay from state @xmath3 , at rate @xmath56 , phenomenologically in eq .",

    "in the slowly varying approximation , the equation for the probe electromagnetic field becomes @xcite @xmath58 with @xmath59 being the slowly varying part of the electromagnetic field with @xmath60 .",

    "note that in the stationary regime the system reaches the electromagnetically induced transparency regime and the population of state @xmath3 is negligible .",

    "( [ eq : progen ] ) contribute to the probe pulse evolution .",
    "in this section , we study how the pulse probe propagates inside the condensate showing eit .",
    "we will focus on the case where @xmath69 , with @xmath70 a constant , is a solution of the gross - pitaevsky equation for the state @xmath2 of the condensate .",
    "spatially uniform condensates have been achieved experimentally @xcite .",
    "the potential , @xmath71 , that generates this distribution , could be a square well ; it can also be a wide harmonic potential and the following discussion is valid in the region near the center of the potential , where there is little change in the density distribution @xcite .",
    "this case avoids the effect that density change in atoms in level @xmath2 has on pulse propagation ; we are interested in the effect that state evolution of atoms in level @xmath1 has on the pulse .",
    "this approximation allow us to obtain an analytic expression for the solution that completely characterizes both , the pulse propagation and the atomic state evolution .",
    "defining @xmath72 , eq .",

    "@xmath74 we obtain @xmath75 where @xmath76 and @xmath77    the solution for the field shown in ( [ eq : solconst ] ) , includes some of the usual characteristic behavior of light traveling through media showing eit .",
    "the pulse velocity depends on the value of @xmath21 ; as @xmath78 the pulse is stopped and , as can be seen from expression ( [ eq : dip1 ] ) , its information is transferred to the atoms @xcite .",
    "note that if @xmath79 and the pulse is already stopped ( @xmath80 ) , the operator @xmath81 , defined in ( [ eq : fakehamiltonian ] ) , coincides with the hamiltonian operator of an atom trapped in the potential @xmath82 . as shown in relation ( [ eq : dip1 ] ) , the wave function of atoms in state @xmath1 is given by the probe field once the pulse is trapped ; then , while the pulse is trapped , the atomic wave function for atoms in state @xmath1 evolves in terms of its own hamiltonian .",
    "as solution ( [ eq : solconst ] ) shows , the profile of it gets written in the pulse once it is released ( @xmath83 ) . if @xmath84 , the photons transfer momentum to the atoms that go from state @xmath2 to state @xmath1 .",
    "this precisely appears in ( [ eq : fakehamiltonian ] ) as a displacement of the momentum operator by @xmath85 .",
    "this effect has been used to move a pulse by physically moving the atoms in state @xmath1 , and then releasing the pulse once the atoms are in a new position @xcite .",
    "it is clear from the solution that the pulse is modified as it travels through the medium , and in the process of stopping it ; the strength of this modification depends on @xmath21 and on the trapping potential for atoms in state @xmath1 .",
    "the behavior described above is the expected behavior for trapping a pulse in a bec @xcite .",
    "the advantage of the analytic expression for the field ( [ eq : solconst ] ) , is that it tells us how the pulse evolve : as if it were a quantum particle with a hamiltonian given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : fakehamiltonian ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath81 looks similar to the hamiltonian operator for atoms in state @xmath1 but multiplied by the factor @xmath86 and in a reference frame that moves with the pulse ; when the control field is zero , @xmath87 and @xmath81 coincides with the hamiltonian of atoms in state @xmath1 .",
    "due to these facts we claim that : the way the probe pulse propagation is affected by the evolution of the wave function of atoms in state @xmath1 , is given by @xmath81 . with this interpretation ,",
    "the coefficient factor @xmath88 in hamiltonian ( [ eq : fakehamiltonian ] ) , gives the strength of how the evolution of the atomic wave function affects the propagating pulse .",
    "we will now explore some of the physical insights that solution ( [ eq : solconst ] ) exhibits .",
    "the field , shown in ( [ eq : solconst ] ) , does not depend on @xmath89 : collisions between atoms in state @xmath1 does not affect the field propagation ; in the limit of weak probe field , the number of atoms transferred to state @xmath1 is small and collisions between them are negligible .",
    "the field has a global phase which depends on @xmath90 ( see ( [ eq : solconst ] ) , ( [ eq : phidet ] ) ) , which in turn depends on term @xmath91 that characterizes the strength of collisions between atoms in state 2 with atoms in state 1 .",
    "pulses that propagate in the medium with different control fields , @xmath21 , will have different phases ; the phase accumulation is maximum when the pulse is stopped , and it is negligible when @xmath21 is large . depending on which parameters are known , making these pulses interfere could be used to extract the value of @xmath91 , @xmath92 or @xmath26 .",
    "if we make interfere a pulse that has been stopped and then released , with a pulse that propagates at constant velocity , we could extract information on the phase advance due to the process of trapping and releasing the pulse .",
    "for intermediate cases ( @xmath93 ) the pulse is modified ; how it is modified depends on the wave function dynamics of atoms in state @xmath1 and on the coupling between this dynamics and the pulse , @xmath88 . for example",
    ", if @xmath82 is constant inside the region the pulse propagates , the width of the wave function for state @xmath1 expands as a free particle , then the probe pulse width expands as if it were a free particle with mass @xmath94 . in this case ,",
    "not taking into account that the field strength changes as a function of the control field , the evolution of the field , in the process of trapping it , would be similar to the evolution of a free particle wave function whose mass change with time .",
    "the pulse propagation can be manipulated using @xmath82 .",
    "for example , if @xmath95 , the center of the pulse ( in the moving frame ) will behave as if it were a harmonic oscillator with mass @xmath94 and frequency @xmath96 .",
    "when a probe pulse of light propagates through a three - level bose - einstein condensate under conditions of electromagnetically induced transparency , its shape is modified by the evolution of the condensate wave function .",
    "the strength of this modification is a function of the control field .",
    "this is in contrast with the case where atoms are assumed point - like , where the probe pulse propagates without modification .    we derived a partial differential equation",
    "whose solution gives the probe pulse propagation inside a three - level bose - einstein condensate under conditions of electromagnetically induced transparency .",
    "we obtained an analytic expression when the initial profile for the atoms in state @xmath2 is constant .",
    "the solution shows explicitly how different parameters of the system  trapping potential of the atoms , time dependent control field , scattering lengths , atom - field coupling  affect the pulse propagation and the evolution of the condensate wave function .",
    "the form of the solution for the probe propagation , expression ( [ eq : solconst ] ) , is similar to the formal solution of the schrodinger equation for the wave function of an atom in state @xmath1 , but with the hamiltonian given in a reference frame that moves with the pulse .",
    "the solution allows us to see how to manipulate the pulse by choosing different trapping potentials for atoms in state @xmath1 and different control fields .",
    "for example , if the potentials are zero , the width of the probe pulse expands in time as if it were a free quantum particle , but with an expansion rate which is a function of the control field .",
    "the propagated pulse acquires a global phase that depends on the control field and the scattering length between atoms in state @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "this phase could be measured by performing interference experiments with pulses that propagate with different control fields .",
    "we are confident that our results can help in the discussion of manipulating light memories using condensates .",
