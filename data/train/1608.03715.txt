    "the theory of absolutely minimizing lipschitz extension ( @xcite ) concerns the classical problem of extending a lipschitz continuous function @xmath0 defined on the boundary of an open set @xmath1 to the interior of @xmath2 without increasing the lipschitz constant .",
    "in other words , to find a lipschitz continuous function @xmath3 such that @xmath4 on @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( @xmath7 denotes the lipschitz constant ) .",
    "the previous problem has several solutions , all in between a maximal and a minimal one called respectively the mcshane s extension and the whitney s extension .",
    "but , among all these possible solutions , the  canonical \" one is the so called absolutely minimizing lipschitz extension ( amle in short ) .",
    "this function is characterized by satisfying the extension problem not only in @xmath2 , but also in any open subset @xmath8 of @xmath2 , that is @xmath9 for any open @xmath10 .",
    "the relevance of the notion of amle relies in the several additional properties that this function satisfies , for example it is the unique viscosity solution of the dirichlet problem for the infinity laplace equation @xmath11 here @xmath12 , the infinity laplacian , is a nonlinear degenerate second order operator and a function satisfying is said infinity harmonic .",
    "the theory of amle has been extended to general metric spaces ( see @xcite ) , hence it applies in particular to the sierpinski gasket @xmath13 endowed with its geodesic distance .",
    "prescribed a boundary data @xmath0 on the vertices of the initial simplex from which @xmath13 is obtained via iteration , there exists a corresponding amle of @xmath0 to @xmath13 . moreover this function can be characterized as in the euclidean case by an intuitive geometric property , called comparison with cones .",
    "nevertheless the characterization of amle on @xmath13 as infinity harmonic function is missing because of the difficulty of defining differential operators on fractal sets .",
    "after the seminal work of kigami @xcite for the laplace operator , a standard way to define a differential operator on the sierpinski gasket , and more in general for the class of post - critically finite fractals , is to consider the uniform limit of suitable scaled finite difference operators on the pre - fractals . a first attempt to follow this approach in the case of the infinity laplace operator",
    "is pursued in @xcite . in this thesis ,",
    "a graph infinity laplacian on pre - fractal sets is defined and an algorithm to compute explicitly infinity harmonic functions is exploited to obtain some properties of these functions .",
    "it is worth noting that the same graph infinity laplacian is used in the euclidean case to approximate the viscosity solution of ( see @xcite ) .    following a similar idea",
    ", we consider the lipschitz extension problem on a pre - fractal set and we show that an appropriate notion of amle can be introduced in this framework .",
    "we also prove that an amle is a solution of the graph infinity laplacian and it satisfies a comparison with cone property with respect to the path distance on the pre - fractal .",
    "this last property is crucial since it allows to show that the limit of the amles on the pre - fractals is an amle on the sierpinski .    a point which remains open in metric spaces is the uniqueness of the amle ( in the euclidean case , uniqueness is obtained via a comparison principle for )",
    "this fact prevents us from defining infinity harmonic functions on @xmath13 as the limit of the corresponding functions on the pre - fractals .",
    "it is also important to observe that while the laplace operator on the sierpinski is associated with an intrinsic distance derived from the natural measure which makes the corresponding energy invariant by rescaling , the amle notion is characterized in terms of the geodesic distance on @xmath13 .",
    "it is well known that in general these two distances do not coincides ( @xcite ) .",
    "indeed the amle theory is associated with a class of @xmath14-variational problems for which there is no natural notion of associated energy .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we introduce notations and definitions and we prove some preliminary properties for the graph infinity laplacian .",
    "section [ sec3 ] is devoted to the amle problem on pre - fractals .",
    "in section [ sec4 ] we recall the definition of amle in metric spaces and we prove the convergence result for the pre - fractals invading the sierpinski gasket . finally , in section [ sec5 ] we describe the algorithm in @xcite and we study the relation between infinity and @xmath15-harmonic function in the pre - fractals .",
    "in this section we introduce notations and definitions and we collect some preliminary results on infinity harmonic functions on graphs .",
