    "over the past decade , direct imaging surveys have discovered a small but significant number of faint , apparently planetary - mass ( @xmath220 @xmath3 ) companions that orbit their primary star hosts ( @xmath40.21.5@xmath5 ) at ultrawide separations ( @xmath6100au , extending to thousands of au ) @xcite .",
    "these planetary mass companions ( pmcs ) represent intriguing analogs to the recent discoveries of smaller separation planets , like hr 8799 bcde @xcite , beta pic b @xcite , hd 95086 b @xcite , gj 504 b @xcite , and lkca15 b @xcite .",
    "the large orbital separations of the pmcs are markedly different from the planets in our own solar system and the vast population of exoplanets detected with the radial velocity and transit methods , so it is not clear whether pmcs formed via similar processes .",
    "planets at orbital radii of @xmath2100 au can feasibly be formed via traditional methods like core accretion @xcite and class ii disk instability @xcite . at wider radii ,",
    "the most plausible process is likely disk fragmentation at the class 0/i stage(e.g .",
    "nonetheless , pmcs are a potential boon for exoplanet studies ; their large separations make them relatively easy to observe , so they could serve as the fully characterized templates against which the more difficult measurements of  traditional \" planets are compared .",
    "in particular , pmcs offer an unique window into the process of giant planet assembly and the associated formation of moon systems .",
    "most pmcs have been found in star - forming regions with ages @xmath7myr , where gas - rich protoplanetary disks are common .",
    "several pmcs exhibit emission lines or possible mid - infrared excesses @xcite that are commonly associated with disks and outflows .",
    "hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) data confirm that some pmcs have large optical / ultraviolet excess emission , indicative of shocks due to the accretion of disk material @xcite .",
    "such observations demonstrate that pmcs can host their own circum(sub)stellar disks , composed of material left over from their own formation or accreted from the disk / envelope of their ( much more massive ) host .",
    "measurements of the masses , structures , and lifetimes of these disks provide constraints on the assembly timescale for pmcs and the duration of their satellite formation epoch which could be compared with measurements of the complementary free - floating substellar population ; ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , hydrodynamic models of giant planet formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) make predictions of the disk radii , scale heights , and mass distributions that could be tested with spatially resolved observations , and wide companions also provide context for observations of close - in planets with ring systems , such as the recently discovered companion to 1swasp j140747.93 - 394542.6 @xcite .",
    "however , these disks also pose challenges : if they are oriented at large viewing angles ( edge - on ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the disk material can obscure the pmc and complicate the determination of its mass .",
    "fw tau is a member of the taurus - auriga association , a nearby ( @xmath8 pc ) , young ( @xmath9 myr ) region of ongoing star formation .",
    "the well - studied primary consists of a close pair ( @xmath1075mas , or 11au , separation ) of m5 stars ( fw tau ab ) with a total mass of 0.20.3@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "fw tau ab exhibits no spectroscopic evidence of ongoing accretion @xcite , nor any clear signature of an infrared excess shortward of 24@xmath11 m @xcite , indicating that it does not host a significant optically - thick disk at orbital radii @xmath1250au .",
    "intriguingly , @xcite noted a 4@xmath13 detection of the system at 850@xmath11 m ( @xmath14mjy ) , suggesting that a small amount of cool dust is present within a @xmath1015diameter region around the system .",
    "recent herschel observations by @xcite also find a far - infrared excess within a similar ( or larger ) beam around fw tau ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17mjy at 70 , 100 , and 160@xmath11 m , respectively ) .",
    "@xcite first reported an extremely faint candidate ( tertiary ) companion near fw tau ab in _ hst _ optical images , with anomalously red @xmath18 photometry and strong ( narrowband ) h@xmath19 emission .",
    "@xcite subsequently confirmed that this companion ( named either fw tau c or fw tau b , depending on its poorly - understood nature and whether it is best considered as a binary companion or planetary - type companion ) and fw tau ab were co - moving using ground - based adaptive optics imaging , and began a multi - pronged effort to better characterize its properties .",
    "if the companion s flux can be attributed to unobscured photospheric emission , the near - infrared flux suggests a companion mass as low as 10@xmath3 , making it another example of a pmc .",
    "however , the true mass could be significantly higher or lower if there is an excess from accretion or disk emission ( as for many disk - hosting stars and brown dwarfs ; @xcite ) and/or obscuration from an envelope or edge - on disk ( as for a number of other stellar or substellar companions ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite recently obtained a near - infrared spectrum of fw tau c that confirms the previous hints of accretion signatures , but found that veiling obscures any photospheric features except broad water absorption bands , which are present for late - m or early - l dwarfs .",
    "the spectra therefore remain consistent with either a pmc or a brown dwarf obscured by an edge - on disk .",
    "the tentative detection of submillimeter emission by @xcite from the unresolved fw tau system hinted that a disk could be present around at least one component , and the high h@xmath19 line flux observed from the faint companion by @xcite strongly suggested that material was accreting onto the companion . in this letter , we present sensitive , component - resolved 1.3mm - wavelength observations from the atacama large millimeter array ( alma ) designed to confirm and localize the putative long - wavelength continuum emission ( to fw tau ab or to fw tau c ) and to more accurately measure the mass of the dust responsible for it .",
    "fw tau was briefly observed with alma in cycle 1 on 2013 december 2 , using 27 available 12 m antennas in an intermediate configuration ( baseline lengths of 17460 m ) and the band 6 receivers under excellent conditions ( 0.6 mm of precipitable water vapor ) .",
    "the correlator was configured to process four spectral windows in dual polarization , centered at 215 , 217 , 230.5 , and 233 ghz ( a mean frequency of 224 ghz , or @xmath20 mm ) , each with 128 coarse channels ( 15.625 mhz resolution ) to maximize continuum sensitivity .",
    "observations cycled between fw tau and the nearby quasar j051002 + 180041 on @xmath107 minute intervals , with additional visits to j0522 - 3627 and ganymede for calibration purposes .",
    "the total on - source time for the fw tau field was 22 minutes .",
    "the raw alma visibilities were calibrated and imaged with the casa software package .",
    "after phase correction using the water vapor radiometers , a system temperature correction , and initial flagging ( which included the rejection of data from one antenna ) , the bandpass structure in each spectral window was corrected using observations of j0522 - 3627 .",
    "the absolute flux scaling was bootstrapped from observations of ganymede .",
    "gain variations due to intrinsic changes in the array and atmosphere were determined from the monitoring of j051002 + 180041 and corrected .",
    "the spectrally - averaged calibrated visibilities were fourier inverted ( assuming natural weighting ) , deconvolved with the clean algorithm , and restored with a @xmath21 ( p.a .",
    "= 131 ) synthesized beam after a single iteration of phase - only self - calibration .",
    "the rms noise level in the resulting image is 28 @xmath11jy beam@xmath22 .",
    "figure [ fig : image ] shows contours of the alma 1.3 mm continuum emission overlaid on the keck / nirc2 @xmath23 image of the fw tau components ( cf .",
    "continuum emission at 1.3 mm is firmly detected ( peak @xmath24 @xmath25 ) and centered on the faint companion , located 228 @xmath26 005 or 330 @xmath26 30 au ( p.a .",
    "= 296@xmath262 ) from the fw tau ab photocenter ( @xmath19 = 04@xmath2729@xmath282971 , @xmath29 = + 26165282 , based on the allwise astrometry and the proper motion estimated by * ? ? ?",
    ". a gaussian fit to the emission indicates that it is unresolved in the @xmath10200@xmath30100au beam and has an integrated @xmath31 mjy ( with an additional @xmath1010%  systematic uncertainty in the flux scale ) as estimated from a gaussian model of the visibilities .",
    "this mm - wave continuum emission is faint enough to be entirely optically thin for any reasonable dust opacity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so the flux measurement can be simply converted into a dust mass estimate . assuming a characteristic dust temperature of @xmath101020 k and a standard opacity of 2.3 @xmath32 g@xmath22 at 1.3 mm , we infer @xmath332 m@xmath34 .",
    "this measurement is entirely consistent with the unresolved , marginal detection of 850 @xmath11 m emission ( @xmath35 mjy ) from the fw tau system by @xcite ; the corresponding spectrum scales like @xmath36 , in excellent agreement with the mean value for disks in this wavelength range .",
    "the herschel fluxes from @xcite are also consistent with the far - ir sed that fits our alma flux , but do not provide a sufficient constraint on the sed shape to further constrain the dust temperature .",
    "the upper limit to the dust emission around the fw tau ab binary , @xmath37 @xmath11jy ( @xmath38 ) , is @xmath1030@xmath30 lower than typical constraints , and corresponds to a dust mass limit of @xmath390.1 @xmath1 .",
    "the co @xmath40=3@xmath412 transition was not detected in the very wide channels ( chosen to optimize continuum sensitivity ) .",
    "the 3@xmath13 upper limit on the peak flux is @xmath103 mjy beam@xmath22 in a single 20 km s@xmath22-wide channel .",
    "the alma data clearly show that all of the disk material in the system is associated solely with the faint companion , fw tau c. given the dust mass estimated from the observed 1.3 mm flux ( @xmath1013 @xmath1 ) and its complementary signatures of disk accretion @xcite , we have confirmed that the faint companion to fw tau hosts one of the least massive primordial disks known to date . if that disk proceeds to form its own system of  planetary \" or ",
    "satellite \" companions , they will not achieve sufficient mass to become standard gas or ice giants .",
    "however , the mass is well matched to the total mass of compact systems of sub - earth planets seen around field ultracool dwarfs ( e.g. , kepler-42 bcd ; @xcite .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the dust mass reservoir still exceeds the total sum of the galilean satellites ( 0.066@xmath1 ; @xcite ) by just over an order of magnitude .",
    "expectations for the disk mass distribution for very low - mass primaries remain uncertain throughout the substellar and planetary mass regime , as there are only a handful of detections and many non - detections ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , a comparison of the infrared and millimeter fluxes to a population of free - floating young counterparts could still provide context as to the nature of the disk host as either a brown dwarf tertiary companion ( fw tau c ) or a pmc ( fw tau b ) . in figure 2 , we show",
    "how the 3.6@xmath11 m magnitude ( converted from the @xmath42 measurement reported by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the new 1.3 mm flux for the companion compare to the flux versus spectral type relations for disk - bearing stars and brown dwarfs in the taurus - auriga region @xcite . a shaded band is used for fw tau c to denote the range of possible spectral types , limited at the upper end ( @xmath10m5 ) by the presence of deep water absorption bands in the near - infrared spectrum @xcite .    at 3.6@xmath11 m ,",
    "fw tau c is fainter than nearly all known substellar companions in the region , clearly in the regime of objects with spectral types later than m9 ( @xmath43@xmath3 ) , though some edge - on disks also sit well below the median relation .",
    "however , comparisons of its millimeter flux with the low - mass taurus - auriga population are more ambiguous .",
    "most mm - wave surveys for brown dwarf disks were conducted with facilities that are substantially less sensitive than alma .",
    "the best available upper limits of those surveys approach the 1.3 mm flux detected here for fw tau c , so there are at least some brown dwarf disks with masses that could be quite a bit lower .",
    "the disk mass measured here is consistent with the range of possible values for isolated taurus - auriga brown dwarfs with spectral types later than @xmath10m5 , assuming it has a similar age and formed in a similar process .",
    "a more appropriate comparison would consider only companions , rather than the full population of isolated objects .",
    "even a very low - mass companion might be able to retain a substantial disk via bondi - hoyle accretion from the disk or envelope of the primary , but free - floating objects do not have such a reservoir to build or maintain a comparable disk mass .",
    "unfortunately , the number of substellar companions in nearby star - forming regions is quite low , and the number with component - resolved millimeter measurements is even lower , so such a comparison is not yet feasible",
    ".    trends observed for more massive stars might also apply , but it is unclear which processes are dominant in this specific case .",
    "a clear trend is seen in older regions for less massive free - floating objects to retain their disks longer @xcite , perhaps even for several tens of myr among brown dwarfs @xcite .",
    "observations of ( stellar ) binaries in taurus suggest that primaries usually dominate the disk mass budget @xcite , though perhaps not out of proportion to the observed scaling of disk mass with primary mass @xcite , and the disks ultimately seem to have similar lifetimes @xcite .",
    "furthermore , close binaries ( such as the fw tau ab pair , with @xmath44 au ) appear to have sharply reduced disk frequencies even at early ages @xcite , so it might not be surprising that the primary has cleared its disk quickly .",
    "the relative rate of disk dispersal is therefore an ambiguous feature in the classification of this system .    in the meantime ,",
    "the most unambiguous way to determine the mass and geometry of fw tau c will be to spectroscopically detect photospheric absorption features , either at higher spectral resolution or in the @xmath101@xmath11 m regime where veiling is minimized .",
    "disk mass determinations for more securely identified pmcs also could shed light on the distinction between companions formed via binary processes or planetary processes . in any case , the alma data presented here signals that we are entering a new regime of sensitivity that will ultimately enable the characterization of fundamental circum(sub-)stellar and circumplanetary disk properties .",
    "the authors thank gaspard duchne for an insightful discussion of the nature of the fw tau companion , and the referee for a helpful critique of this paper .",
    "this paper makes use of the following alma data : ads / jao.alma#2012.1.00989.s .",
