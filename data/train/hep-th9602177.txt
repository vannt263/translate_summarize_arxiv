    "the investigation of boundary quantum integrable models @xcite  is motivated both by the abundance of applications , such as the kondo effect @xcite , open string theory and quantum wires @xcite , as well as by the clear description of their bulk counterparts as perturbations around conformal field theories @xcite . in the bulk , toda field theory @xcite , free field theory and coulomb - gas description @xcite  are most useful tools . in the presence of boundaries ,",
    "the conformal theory is well understood @xcite ; for systems off criticality however , integrability sometimes only allows certain combinations of bulk and boundary terms @xcite .",
    "the coulomb gas plays a special role in this game .",
    "being a ( non - affine ) toda field theory , it carries most of the features of the off - critical systems . on the other hand ,",
    "it serves perfectly well to describe minimal conformal models . in this paper",
    ", we wish to consider the coulomb - gas description of minimal conformal models on the half plane , and to find connections between its boundary conditions and screening contours .    in section 2 , we will first consider the conformal invariance of the toda action .",
    "for the half plane , this leads to two conformally invariant boundary conditions on the free field .",
    "one of them is the neumann boundary condition , for which the discussion looks most natural .",
    "section 3 is a brief review of the coulomb - gas formulation of minimal conformal models .",
    "the coulomb gas is treated as a liouville theory with imaginary coupling , which is expanded as a marginal perturbation around a free bosonic field theory .",
    "this description with two - dimensional screening integrals was introduced in @xcite  as a manifestly conformally invariant alternative .",
    "we will compare it to the contour - integral description , following the lines of mathur @xcite  who considered the full plane .",
    "the ising model is considered as an example in section 4 .",
    "we will show to what contour integrals the two - point functions reduce in the above mentioned description with neumann boundary condition on the bosonic field . in section 4.2 ,",
    "these results are compared to the conformal blocks of the free or fixed boundary conditions on the spin operator @xcite  which both require boundary - crossing integration contours .",
    "this motivates the introduction of new boundary terms in section 5 which are best described as composite operators of a vertex operator and its mirror image .",
    "the expressions introduced are shown to lead either to vanishing correlators or to sew together screening contours of the two different half planes , leaving the vertex operator corresponding to an identity operator of the model at the boundary .",
    "correspondences to the boundary states in @xcite  are discussed .",
    "the outlook in section 6 compares our boundary expressions to the boundary terms added to the off - critical action in @xcite  and to the boundary terms in toda theories @xcite .",

    "the action is conformally invariant if @xmath22 i.e.  conformal invariance restricts to analytic conformal transformations .",
    "thus the conformal freedom is equivalent to general holomorphic changes of @xmath23 , and the model has two independent virasoro symmetries , corresponding to @xmath24 and @xmath25 in ( [ cond ] ) .",
    "the flatness of the world sheet is preserved under such transformations .    on the quantum level ,",

    "restricts @xmath24 and @xmath25 from ( [ cond ] ) to be the analytic continuation of each other .",
    "this implies that the antiholomorphic part of the energy - momentum tensor has to be the analytic continuation of its holomorphic part , leaving us with a single copy of the virasoro algebra @xcite . in other words ,",

    "both conditions ( [ neu ] ) and ( [ obc ] ) are conformally invariant , since  using that at the boundary @xmath49  the right hand sides of ( [ obc ] ) have dimension 1 .",
    "for the non - affine @xmath50 ( coulomb gas ) which we will consider throughout the rest of the paper , the two possibilities for @xmath51 correspond to the screening operators @xmath52 and @xmath53 which are the natural dimension - one objects one can put on the right hand side of ( [ obc ] ) .",
    "the same two choices exist as well for all other simply - laced lie algebras .",

    ", the term @xmath55 would vanish everywhere on the boundary , but the term @xmath56 generically would not .",
    "thus the dirichlet boundary condition does not naturally fit into our description . for the sine - gordon model ,",

    ", we will choose neumann boundary conditions for the bosonic field , i.e.  we will work at the uv fixed point .",
    "after this excursion to toda field theory , we can try to apply the results to the coulomb - gas representation .",

    "the @xmath79-terms vanish for monodromy reasons . hence , mathur is left with products of holomorphic and antiholomorphic block functions .    for the half plane",
    ", the neumann boundary condition implies the correlator to be @xmath81 and @xmath82 , and the integrand in ( [ trick ] ) will not split into two sectors ] reality is ensured by setting @xmath83 ( and similar ) , before replacing @xmath84 by @xmath78 in ( [ trick ] ) . ] . the integral ( [ trick ] ) is hence a double integral of two screeners around four points .",
    "this is not surprising since the two - point function on the half plane has to fulfill the same differential equation as the holomorphic sector of a four - point function on the full plane @xcite .",
    "note , however , that this integral is a double - valued function .",
    "uniqueness of the full - plane four - point function is obtained by combining the holomorphic and antiholomorphic blocks in a monodromy - invariant way .",
    "for the half - plane two - point function , both branches of the double - valued function are invariant under a twist of the two points in the upper half plane around each other and a simultaneous twist of their mirror images .",
    "the restriction to a unique function is obtained by observing that the @xmath23-integration has to stay in the upper half plane , while the @xmath78-integration is performed in the lower half plane .    in a similar way",
    ", one has to use for a generic @xmath85-point function on the half plane that one can not get contours which go from one half plane to the other .",
    "therefore , one gets considerably fewer conformal blocks than for one sector of the @xmath86-point function on the full plane .",
    "invariance under twists of the points @xmath87 and simultaneous twists of their mirror images @xmath88 restricts then to unique results .",
    "in this section and in the appendix , we want to illustrate what the boundary @xmath35 will look like for the half plane , and with what tools one can evaluate the integral ( [ trick ] ) .    as an example , consider the ising model on the half plane .",
    "special care should be taken of the difference between the neumann boundary condition on the free field @xmath21 , which arises naturally in the coulomb - gas description , and the free and fixed boundary conditions on the @xmath89 operator @xcite . throughout the rest of this paper",
    ", it will be understood that the boundary condition on @xmath21 is the neumann boundary condition .",
    "superscripts `` free '' and `` fixed '' will refer to the boundary condition on @xmath89 .    label the points by @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 ,   or by @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , ",
    "depending on whether there is an emphasis on the properties of the holomorphic block on the full plane or of the @xmath85-point function on the half plane .",
    "see figure 1 for an illustration .",
    "define the cross ratio to be @xmath98 with @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "the `` physical '' cross ratio for the half plane is real negative .      in the appendix",
    ", it is shown that for the two - point function of @xmath101 , the two - dimensional integral @xmath102from ( [ trick ] ) reduces to one contour in each half plane between the two respective singularities . from the asymptotic behaviour , this double integral",
    "is seen to be the hypergeometric function @xmath103 where @xmath104 with @xmath105 being euler s beta function .",
    "the expression in the second to last line is the general result for the two - point function of the vertex operator @xmath106 in any minimal model labeled by @xmath2 . for the determination of the asymptotic behaviour in the appendix we used that the integration variables @xmath107 and @xmath78 stay in their respective half planes as illustrated in figure 2a .",
    "the function @xmath108 corresponds to the conformal block in which the insertions communicate in the @xmath109-channel through the boundary .",
    "recall that , for the four - point function on the full plane @xcite , this is only one of the conformal block functions of the holomorphic sector , which consists of any linear combination of ( [ soln ] ) with @xmath110 where @xmath111 the function @xmath112 corresponds to the conformal block in which the insertions communicate in the @xmath113-channel through the boundary .",
    "the hypergeometric functions in ( [ soln ] ) and in ( [ solnb ] ) have a branch cut from @xmath114 to @xmath115 . crossing this branch cut changes the hypergeometric function @xmath108 up to a phase @xmath116 to @xmath112 , and vice versa .",
    "this means that one obtains ( [ solnb ] ) from ( [ soln ] ) by leaving the `` physical '' region ( i.e.  the negative real axis ) , analytically continuing over the branch cut and returning to the `` physical '' region .",
    "therefore , the function ( [ solnb ] ) corresponds ( up to the phase @xmath116 ) to the contour integral in figure 2b , in which the variables obviously leave their respective half planes .",
    "it is important to observe that the two contours in figure 2b still go from @xmath90 to @xmath92 , and from @xmath91 to @xmath93 respectively .",
    "what changes from one conformal block to the other , is the way these contours are twisted around the singular points , not the way the points are paired .",
    "the three different ways to pair up the four points correspond to the expansions around the three singular points of the cross ratios .",
    "an expansion around the zero of a certain cross ratio is analytic up to the prefactors of type @xmath117 if the cross ratio tends to zero when bringing the two end points of one contour close to each other .",
    "hence , using the neumann boundary condition , the two - dimensional screening integrals ( [ pert ] ) lead to the conformal block @xmath108 , while the block @xmath112 a priori can not be obtained by such an integral .",
    "this subsection summarises the results of @xcite , and shows how they fit into the above description .",
    "cardy @xciteuses the facts that for @xmath118 @xmath119 and that for the free boundary condition @xmath120 , even in the limit @xmath121 , i.e.  for @xmath122 at the boundary .",
    "this leads to the unique solution for the free boundary condition on @xmath89 @xmath123 which is the difference between ( [ soln ] ) and ( [ solnb ] ) , and has a simple expansion around @xmath114 , corresponding to the @xmath124-expansion of ( [ solnb ] ) in our paper is the inverse of the one used by cardy @xcite . ] .    on the other hand , in the limit of @xmath94 and @xmath96 close to each other and far away from the boundary , i.e.  for @xmath125",
    ", one can use the bulk operator product expansion which does not depend on the boundary condition operator in the @xmath126 model . ]",
    "@xmath127 parametrising an arbitrary function in the space spanned by ( [ soln ] ) and ( [ solnb ] ) as @xmath128 , one has therefore for both the free and fixed boundary conditions @xmath129 from equation ( [ cardy ] ) , it follows that @xmath130 using equation ( [ ctwo ] ) , this implies @xmath131 in @xcite  it is pointed out that under the duality transformation interchanging the free and fixed boundary conditions , the energy operator @xmath113 changes to @xmath132 .",
    "therefore @xmath133 .",

    ", this means that the conformal blocks of the two - point function with free and fixed boundary conditions on @xmath89 are given by the integrals @xmath136 . for the former ,",
    "the contours are twisted as shown in figure 3a .",
    "for the later , they are straight as in figure 3b . in both cases",
    ", one needs boundary - crossing contours which are not provided by the two - dimensional screening integral ( [ pert ] ) using the neumann boundary condition .    a priori ,",
    "it does not seem possible to use the manifestly conformally invariant formulation ( [ pert ] ) and the neumann condition ( [ neu ] ) , which is the natural boundary condition at the uv fixed point of the coulomb gas , to describe the conformal boundary conditions of the minimal models we are interested in .",
    "a solution to this dilemma is the insertion of one or more of the following boundary operators into the correlation functions @xmath137 and to define the correlation function for a particular boundary condition by @xmath138 the point @xmath139 is an arbitrary point on the boundary .",
    "the evaluation of correlators with these insertions is defined by first balancing the charges with the help of screening operators , then transforming the two - dimensional integrals into contour integrals , and finally taking the limit ( or limites ) of @xmath140 . in the following",
    ", we will restrict our discussion to @xmath141 .",
    "equivalent statements are true for @xmath142 .    selecting a preferred point ,",

    "observe as well that @xmath141 has dimension 0 .",
    "suitably screened , it can be viewed as the product of two @xmath89 operators projected onto the identity .",
    "thus in the full - plane description , the remaining operators will be trivial .",

    "@xmath212 this can be obtained in the coulomb - gas picture by requiring that the free boundary condition for @xmath89 corresponds to a linear combination of terms with even numbers of @xmath141 insertions only ( i.e.  @xmath213 ) . for an odd number of @xmath101 in the upper half plane ,",
    "the charges can not be balanced by the insertion of screeners , and all odd - point functions of the @xmath101 operator , resp .",
    "@xmath89 , vanish .",
    "as it should be , the @xmath214 degeneracy for the free boundary condition appears as well : all non - vanishing correlators are invariant under @xmath215 .",
    "the fixed boundary condition , on the other hand , requires a contribution of a single @xmath141 insertion for the one - point function of @xmath89",
    ". it should carry the sign of the external magnetic field , which in the conformal limit is @xmath216 . since the charges in the other to terms in ( [ bcexp ] ) can not be balanced , the one - point function",
    "would then read @xmath217 where we have used ( [ ident ] ) . by comparing this result with @xcite  one",
    "gets for the coefficients @xmath218 .",
    "a single @xmath141 can however not be the full story for the fixed boundary condition . if there were no contribution of an insertion of a pair of @xmath141 or of the neumann boundary condition , the two - point function of @xmath89 would vanish .",
    "recalling the conformal blocks ( [ cardy ] ) and ( [ fixed ] ) , as well as the corresponding figures 3a and 3b , one knows that there has to be a contribution of @xmath219 for free and fixed boundary conditions . but",
    "a correlator with four insertions in each half plane has five independent cross ratios and 32 conformal blocks .",
    "this makes it quite difficult to use the techniques described in the appendix to determine with which conformal block one ended up .",
    "however , there is an easier way of gaining further insight :    consider the one - point function of @xmath113 in the expansion ( [ bcexp2 ] ) for which as well only the first three terms contribute . only for the @xmath189-insertion",
    ", the charges can be balanced , and the other two terms do not contribute . from the sign change under the duality",
    "transform , one gets @xmath220 .",
    "now recall that equations ( [ fixed ] ) and ( [ cardy ] ) are the sum , respectively the difference , of the two conformal blocks in which the @xmath109- and @xmath113-channel propagate through the boundary .",
    "hence , @xmath221 is @xmath222 . with the help of the quantum group clebsch - gordon coefficients",
    "the @xmath223 can be transformed into @xmath211 .",
    "this can be compared to cardy s result in @xcite .",
    "he introduces boundary states @xmath224 which fulfill all the boundary conditions required by the underlying @xmath225-algebra and are @xmath225-descendents of the highest weight state @xmath226 with eigenvalue @xmath227 under the action of @xmath228 : along an infinitely long strip only @xmath229 propagates for the boundary states @xmath230 and @xmath231 .",
    "cardy maps the strip later to a half plane , introducing boundary - condition changing operators at the origin .",
    "our boundary is equivalent to one side of the strip , the other one being moved to an infinite distance , we will not consider boundary - condition changing operators in this paper . ] .",
    "cardy identifies the states corresponding to the conformal boundary conditions of the ising model as @xmath232 our results hence suggest that we should interpret ( [ carb ] ) such that we have to subtract the conformal block without boundary insertions and the the one with a @xmath189-insertion from each other to get the conformal block of the free boundary condition .",
    "the fixed boundary condition equivalently would be given as a linear combination of no insertion , a @xmath141-insertion and a @xmath189-insertion .    in this interpretation ,",
    "the odd - point functions of the @xmath89 operator vanish for free boundary conditions .",
    "the one - point function carries the sign of the external magnetic for the fixed boundary conditions .",
    "the sign change in front of the @xmath112-term in equations ( [ cardy ] ) and ( [ fixed ] ) is explained , as well the sign change under the duality transform for @xmath233 could be explained by a different normalisation in ( [ carb ] ) . ]",
    "@xcite .",
    "the similarity between ( [ bcexp ] ) and ( [ bcexp2 ] ) with the coefficients just derived , and ( [ carb ] ) has to be used with caution , though .",
    "cardy s states are an infinite sum over @xmath225-descendents , including the virasoro descendents which have shifted @xmath201 eigenvalues , and are furthermore not normalisable .      for the 3-state potts model ( the minimal model at @xmath234 )",
    ", there are branch cuts of order five for a screener going around an insertion point .",
    "for this example , we do not have an as rigorous proof as for the ising model that the two - point function for the neumann boundary condition is the conformal block given by the double integral of figure 2a .",
    "this means especially that we can not say anything about the relative coefficient in front of the two versions of the integral , but that it is given by a sum of phase factors of order five .",
    "consider the @xmath113 operator ( with conformal weight @xmath235 ) .",
    "its two - point function for the neumann boundary condition is given by the hypergeometric function @xmath236 the free boundary condition of the 3-state potts model is according to @xcite  given by the sum of @xmath237 and @xmath238 .",
    "for the former however , we can not balance the charges , and it has to vanish .",
    "hence , the one - point function is given as the conformal block given by a @xmath239 insertion with a @xmath142 at the boundary .",
    "we get @xmath240 what is in accordance with @xcite .",
    "it would be a natural expectation that the boundary terms ( [ bot ] ) can be derived by adding boundary terms to the action . changing the action to @xmath241",
    "would produce many of the qualitative features required above , as e.g.  the vanishing of the odd - point functions or the sign of the @xmath113 one - point function .",
    "an exact calculation of the appearing coefficients is however cumbersome , and is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "one of the difficulties lies in the fact that beside the factor @xmath71 in front of the screening term in the action , there are now additional free parameters in front of the @xmath167 in ( [ ffa ] ) .    by a series expansion of the exponential @xmath242 , with multiple points @xmath143 for the higher order terms , the changed action leads to an expansion of multiple insertions of @xmath141 .",
    "in such an expansion , one gets arbitrarily many @xmath141 insertions .",
    "however , once there are more @xmath141 than other insertions , one is forced to put screening contours around pairs of @xmath106 operators close to the boundary .",
    "but such terms would as well appear in the partition function , and one can use standard arguments of quantum field theory to show that only the `` connected '' pieces contribute . as shown above , these are only finitely many terms .    one can compare ( [ ffa ] ) to the boundary integrals in @xcitewhere the off - critical ising model is considered as an example . the critical ising model we considered so far",
    "is the massless limit of the bosonisation of the free majorana fermion field theory @xmath243 if one considers the off - critical theory with free boundary condition on the half plane , one has to add a boundary term @xcite@xmath244 ghoshal and zamolodchikov introduce @xmath245 as a fermionic boundary field .",
    "the @xmath246 term is an @xmath247 in the critical theory .",
    "this corresponds to the suggested @xmath189 in ( [ ffa ] ) .",
    "the coupling to the external magnetic field @xmath248 , where @xmath249 , disappears under the limit @xmath250 unless @xmath216 , for which it leads to the fixed boundary conditions . the boundary spin operator @xmath251 can easily be related to the pair of @xmath101 operators arising from @xmath141 at the boundary .",
    "the boundary terms ( [ gzbt ] ) are still present after scaling the theory to the conformal point .",
    "rewritten via a one dimensional stoke s theorem  the points where the branch cuts cross the real axis forming the `` boundary '' of the real axis ",
    "they might explain the origin of @xmath141 and @xmath142 .",
    "it even leaves the option to relate them to the additional degree of freedom @xmath245",
    "@xcite  which , for scaling reasons , must have dimension 0 like @xmath141 .",
    "the introduction of boundary spin operators was considered for more general conformal models in @xcite .",
    "additions of boundary terms to the action , which are similarly to the terms in ( [ ffa ] ) no integrals , appear as well for toda theories @xcite .",
    "it remains unclear whether the @xmath167 can be related to these boundary terms ( recall that the coulomb gas considered here is the @xmath50 toda theory ) .",
    "the boundary term in @xcite  produces for the ordinary lie algebra @xmath50 the `` screeners '' of the right hand side of ( [ obc ] ) .",
    "it would be nice to interpret this as the second conformal block ( [ solnb ] ) , which has to be added to the neumann term ( [ soln ] ) to get the conformal blocks of free and fixed boundary conditions . since the higher minimal models ( @xmath252 ) have more than two conformal boundary conditions , but are still described by @xmath50 , this interpretation is however unlikely to work .",
    "the neumann boundary condition on @xmath21 is the natural boundary condition for a generic non - affine toda field theory viewed as the uv limit of an affine theory . treating the coulomb - gas description of minimal models as a perturbation of the free field theory by a liouville potential",
    ", the neumann boundary condition leads to screening contours which do not cross the boundary . on the other side , the @xmath85-point functions for conformal boundary conditions of the minimal model fall into conformal blocks which generically correspond to boundary - crossing contours .",
    "we introduced boundary insertions @xmath141 and @xmath142 ( [ bot ] ) which can be described as composite operators of a vertex operator and its mirror image .",
    "these insertions sew together contours from each half plane to a boundary - crossing contour .",
    "only an identity operator remains at the point where this contour crosses the boundary , while all other contributions vanish .",
    "it is argued that these insertions can combine to general @xmath167 .",
    "the appearing truncation follows from the quantum group behaviour of the vertex operators , with @xmath253 .",
    "although the calculational difficulty is increased by the additional insertions , sensitive statements can be made in simple situations .",
    "there is a close connection between cardy s boundary states ( [ carb ] ) and the coefficients in ( [ bcexp ] ) .",
    "i wish to express my gratitude to n.  warner , who posed the question of this paper , and who guided me to its final form .",

    "consider the @xmath89-operator two - point function of the ising model on the half plane . recall that this correlator , written as an analytic four - point function has to fulfill the differential equation @xcite@xmath254      i\\ = \\ 0\\ ] ] and three similar equations with @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 taking the special role . plugging the integral representation ( [ trick ] ) into this differential equation one",

    "however , a dotsenko integral between two singularities is up to a prefactor a pochhammer integral around the same pair of points to the four parts of the pochhammer contours , and that the contributions in an @xmath145-neighbourhood of the singularities are proportional to @xmath256 . ] .",
    "therefore , double integrals with both contours going from one singularity to another fulfill ( [ deq ] ) , too .    for the area integral @xmath257 , stoke s theorem applied to ( [ deqa ] ) leads to integrals along the branch cuts which vanish since the integration along the left and right sides of the cuts cancel each other because of monodromy invariance of the integrand",
    ". for the half plane , there are as well integrals along the real axis , but these vanish due to the factor @xmath258 .",
    "therefore , the area integrals fulfill the differential equations both for the full and the half plane , and hence they are a linear combination of the conformal blocks",
    ".      we argued in section 4 that it is a priori impossible to get boundary crossing contours by evaluating the two - dimensional integral @xmath259 .",
    "a screener and its mirror image are on two different half planes , hence after applying stoke s theorem as in ( [ trick ] ) one integration is performed along the boundary of one half plane ( the boundary includes the branch cuts ) while the other integration goes from a reference point in the other half plane to the complex conjugate of the first integration variable .",
    "therefore each integration variable stays in its respective half plane .",
    "since there are no distinguished points on the boundary , the contours have to run between the singular points in the bulk .          @xmath264 the @xmath79-terms , which are in the upper half plane along one of these pieces and in the lower half plane from one end point to the complex conjugate of the first integration variable , appear in pairs which cancel each other .",
    "the @xmath79-terms along the boundary vanish for reality reasons ( see @xmath265 and @xmath266 ) .",
    "@xmath265 since vertex operators and their mirror images have the same charges , the complex conjugate of a double integral is obtained by integrating between the complex conjugates of the end points ( paying careful attention to the branch cuts ) .",
    "@xmath266 from the way we defined the integrand after ( [ foot ] ) , it is clear that integrals @xmath257 are real .",
    "application of stoke s theorem via ( [ trick ] ) yields an @xmath269 , hence the sum of the double integrals has to be purely imaginary .",
    "we can subtract the complex conjugate of all these terms and divide by 2 .",
    "for the two - point function of the @xmath89 operator in the ising model ( and as well for the @xmath270 operator of the tri - critical ising model @xmath271 ) , the integrals going to the boundary have vanishing overall factor , and one remains with @xmath272 .",
    "this proof does not work as straightforward for other examples , where one has to use nontrivial relations between different integrals going to the boundary , and it is hence far from being general .",
    "] . especially , there might be a proportionality factor different from 1 .    from the remarks made at the beginning of this subsection",
    ", one furthermore expects that the contours are symmetric under reflection along the real axis , a symmetry which ensures monodromy invariance and reality .",
    "this statement is obviously fulfilled for the case considered above .",
    "it is true in general since the two - dimensional integral has to yield a function which depends on the _ real _ cross ratios only .      for large @xmath273 , the asymptotic behaviour of the integral @xmath274 gives after the substitutions @xmath275 and @xmath276 two separate integrals for @xmath277 and @xmath278 in @xmath279 , which are easily identified as euler s beta - functions .",
    "@xmath280 vanishes .",
