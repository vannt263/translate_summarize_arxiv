    "asymmetric solitons bifurcate supercritically from symmetric and antisymmetric ones , respectively . in the former case ,",
    "symmetric and asymmetric fundamental solitons were found only in the semi - infinite gap , while antisymmetric solitons were also discovered in the first finite subgap , as well in the bloch band separating it from the semi - infinite band ( in the latter case , the antisymmetric solitons have the character of _ embedded _ ones ) . in the rr system , solitons are located in finite bandgaps , and , additionally , antisymmetric and symmetric solitons were found as embedded ones inside bloch bands . in both systems ( aa and rr ) , the asymmetric solitons are always stable , while the branch which gives rise to them is stable before the bifurcation , and unstable afterwards .",
    "the nonbifurcating branches , i.e. , antisymmetric and symmetric solutions in the aa and rr systems , respectively , are unstable or stable as a whole in weak and strong ol , respectively .",
    "the corresponding stability region was identified in a complete form for the aa system , in the parameter plane of coupling coefficient @xmath7 and ol strength @xmath52 . in the systems of both aa and rr types ,",
    "bistability regions were found , in which the stable asymmetric solitons coexist with either antisymmetric or symmetric ones , respectively .",
    "if the symmetric soliton in the aa system , or the antisymmetric soliton in the rr system was destabilized by the bifurcation , its evolution tends to transform it into a stable asymmetric soliton , in either system . in the ra system",
    ", two soliton families were found , dominated by either the self - attractive or repulsive component , both being entirely stable .    in the aa system , we have also studied families of twisted ( odd ) solitons , featuring two out - of - phase peaks in a cell of the ol .",
    "the behavior of these families is , generally , similar to that of the fundamental solitons , including the bifurcation of the symmetric branch into an asymmetric one , and bistability ; however , unlike the situation with the fundamental solitons , the symmetry - breaking bifurcation of the twisted solitons occurs in a finite bandgap . in addition , @xmath122-out - of - phase bound states of fundamental solitons were constructed in both the aa and rr systems .",
    "their behavior too is quite similar to that of the respective fundamental solitons , with a difference that , past the bifurcation , an unstable bound state tends to arrange itself into a persistent breather ( rather than into a stationary bound state of the asymmetric type ) .",
    "the study of the systems with the mismatch , @xmath0 , between the ols in the two cores demonstrates that former symmetric and antisymmetric solitons turn into qs ( quasi - symmetric ) and qas ( quasi - antisymmetric ) ones .",
    "for @xmath157 , the deformation is mild , and the behavior of various soliton families remains qualitatively the same as in the system with @xmath8 ; in particular , well - defined bifurcations which generate asymmetric solitons from qs or qas ones , in the mismatched aa and rr system , respectively , occur despite the presence of the mismatch ( in a system of mismatched parallel - coupled bragg gratings , similar observations were recently made in ref .",
    "however , when the mismatch attains its maximum , @xmath2 , the situation becomes different : instead of the bifurcations , both the aa and rr systems demonstrate _ pseudo - bifurcations _",
    ", when the branch of asymmetric solutions does not really bifurcate from that of qs or qas solutions , but rather goes very close and only asymptotically merges into it .",
    "thus , the asymmetric branch always exists and is stable in the latter case , while its qs or qas counterpart is always unstable ( although the instability is extremely weak when it approaches the stable asymmetric branch ) . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "the present work reports the first example of the pseudo - bifurcation in a mismatched binary system ( in a system of mismatched bragg gratings , no such effect was observed @xcite ) .",
    "finally , we have considered a model of the single - core trap , equipped with the ol and filled with a binary mixture , assuming both the nonlinear interaction between the two species , and linear coupling between them , induced by a resonant spin - flipping field , if the species correspond to different spin states of the same atom . in this case",
    ", we have found that the bifurcations generating asymmetric solitons from symmetric and antisymmetric ones are qualitatively similar to their counterparts in the model without the nonlinear interaction between the species , if this interaction is weaker than the intra - species nonlinearity ; otherwise , the bifurcations switch their character , so that the asymmetric solitons emerge from antisymmetric and symmetric ones in the aa and rr systems , respectively .    a very natural extension would be to consider a two - dimensional version of the models introduced in this work , which may also directly apply to bec in a dual - core pancake - shaped trap , or to a binary mixture in a single - core nearly flat trap .",
    "the work in this direction is currently in progress , and results will be reported elsewhere .",
    "it may also be possible to consider the spontaneous symmetry breaking in a degenerate fermion gas filling a dual - core trap , using a relatively simple description of the fermion gas based on the thomas - fermi ( alias mean - field - hydrodynamic ) approximation , which was developed , for various settings , in refs .",
