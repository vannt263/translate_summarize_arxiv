    "strong interactions between single atoms and single photons , engineered through the use of optical resonators or cavities ( i.e. , cavity quantum electrodynamics , or cavity qed ) , provide a means of realizing quantum dynamics and phenomena that are of both fundamental and practical interest @xcite . on the fundamental side , for example , issues of quantum coherence , entanglement , and measurement can be addressed , while , on the practical side , capabilities for quantum state preparation and manipulation are of immediate relevance to quantum information processing .",
    "indeed , in this latter context , cavity qed systems comprised of single atoms in optical fabry - prot cavities have already contributed an impressive range of experimental demonstrations , including deterministic single photon generation , state transfer between atoms and light , and conditional quantum dynamics @xcite .",
    "these operations would be key building blocks for a quantum network in which atoms are used for storage of quantum information at local nodes of the network , photons ( `` flying qubits '' ) provide a means of distributing quantum information between distant nodes , and atom - photon interactions enable transfer between matter and light , and also manipulation , of the quantum information @xcite .    despite this remarkable progress in experimental cavity qed",
    ", the `` conventional '' fabry - prot cavities used in the above - mentioned demonstrations do not lend themselves well to large scale networking .",
    "so , in the pursuit of scalable architectures for quantum networks based on effects in cavity qed and on propagating light fields , a variety of microfabricated ( i.e. , microchip - based ) systems are now under active investigation ; these include semiconductor quantum dots in micropillar , microdisk , or photonic crystal cavities ( for recent reviews see , e.g. , @xcite ) , cold atoms with monolithic wgm resonators @xcite , fiber - fabry - prot resonators @xcite , or photonic crystal waveguides @xcite , and nanocrystals with microsphere cavities @xcite .    key properties of ultra - low intrinsic cavity mode losses and high efficiency transfer of light fields into and out of the cavity modes are well established features of , in particular , microspheres , microdisks and microtoroids coupled via evanescent fields to tapered optical fibers @xcite . additionally , the ultra - small volumes of the wgm s supported by these monolithic structures lead to very large single photon electric fields and , consequently , very large atom - field coupling strengths , @xmath0 , which may exceed dissipative rates in the system .",
    "in fact , this regime of strong coupling cavity qed has now been demonstrated experimentally for both a single alkali atom in the evanescent field of a microtoroidal @xcite or microbottle @xcite resonator and for a single quantum dot embedded in a microdisk resonator @xcite .",
    "an important aspect of these particular systems , related to the input - output coupling efficiency of photons , is the ability to `` tune '' the external coupling rate , @xmath1 , of the cavity modes to the optical fiber by adjusting the distance between the taper and the wgm microresonator . by setting @xmath1 to be much larger than the rates for intrinsic cavity losses ( @xmath2 ) and spontaneous emission of the atom or quantum dot ( @xmath3 ) ,",
    "one ensures that the fiber is indeed the dominant input - output channel in the system .",
    "moreover , depending on the precise size of @xmath1 relative to certain other coupling parameters , the microresonator cavity qed system can exhibit quite distinct regimes of operation with regards to effect on a light field propagating along an evanescently - coupled optical fiber .",
    "in particular , much interest has to date been focussed on operation under the condition of _ critical coupling _ between the fiber and the wgm microresonator @xcite , i.e. , @xmath4 , whereby , in the absence of an atom , destructive interference prevents transmission of resonant light along the fiber , with , instead , light either reflected back in the opposite ( backward ) direction , dissipated through the intrinsic wgm losses , or transferred to a second evanescently - coupled fiber @xcite ( or , in general , some combination of these possibilities ) .",
    "a strongly coupled atom ( @xmath5 ) induces vacuum rabi splitting of the cavity resonance and breaks the critical coupling condition , causing a finite transmission in the forward direction .",
    "however , such wgm microresonators support degenerate , counterpropagating modes , both of which couple to the atom .",
    "identically - polarized , counterpropagating te modes give rise to a pair of orthogonal standing - wave normal modes and the phase of one of these modes can always be chosen so that it has a node at the position of the atom .",
    "the presence of this uncoupled normal mode means that for te fields the incident field can never be fully transmitted ; in fact , the transmission is limited to 25% of the incident field @xcite for the strong coupling regime @xmath5 .    in the so - called `` bad cavity '' regime , for which @xmath6 ( but @xmath7 so that @xmath8 ) , it is actually possible for this limit to be increased towards 100% @xcite , but only for very weak incident fields , as the atom is typically saturated with extremely small photon numbers . alternatively ,",
    "it has been pointed out , and demonstrated experimentally , that for nontransversally - polarized wgm s ( i.e. , tm rather than te fields ) it is possible to realize a situation where the atom effectively couples to only a single , unidirectional wgm , such that strong vacuum rabi splitting of this mode by the atom can in principle enable 100% transmission along the fiber of light resonant with the bare wgm frequency @xcite .    in this paper , we describe a new and promising scheme which , under ideal conditions , also enables 100% contrast in transmission along the fiber between the no - atom and single - atom cases , but which works despite the presence of an uncoupled , standing - wave normal mode of the microresonator ( i.e. , it works with transversally - polarized te wgm s ) and also enables control of the propagation of relatively strong light fields or , alternatively , of light pulses of significant photon number .",
    "the scheme requires the strong coupling regime of cavity qed , i.e. , @xmath9 , but , with regards to the fiber - microresonator coupling , operates in the _ strongly over - coupled regime _ , i.e. , @xmath10 . under this condition , and in the absence of an atom , incident light is simply transmitted along the fiber . however , as we shall show , the effect of a single , strongly - coupled atom is now to effectively restore the condition of critical coupling and block the transmission of resonant light past the microresonator .",
    "the present scheme can be viewed as complementing a previously studied , single - atom setup in the bad - cavity , over - coupled regime , demonstrated experimentally in @xcite , which exhibits the same contrast in transmission , but works only for weak incident light fields ; in particular , in this regime the ( two - level ) atom can only reflect incident light efficiently provided that no more than one photon ever arrives within the effective atomic lifetime @xcite .",
    "this mechanism for reflection also yields strongly antibunched light in the reflected field , in contrast to the present scheme , which preserves coherent fields in reflection .    we begin in section ii with a description of our theoretical model , then in section iii present a linearized analysis , which allows a quite straightforward and transparent explanation of the present scheme . in section",
    "iv we move beyond the linearized analysis to numerical solutions of the master equation for the system , enabling us to examine dependence on the atom - field coupling strength and on the coherent driving field strength .",
    "we connect the saturation behavior of the system with the semiclassical description of optical bistability of the cavity field , which allows us to quantify simply the regime of validity of the linear analysis . given this knowledge , in section v we consider the case of incident coherent - state pulses and give a conservative upper estimate for the mean photon number of a pulse that could in principle be controlled by the single - atom switch . in section",
    "vi we then outline a scheme , involving an auxiliary ( uncoupled ) internal atomic level , which could allow the preparation of an entangled state of the atom and coherent state pulses propagating in opposite directions along the fiber . using a linearized analysis",
    ", we evaluate the fidelity of preparation of such an entangled state for realistic parameters .",

    "given the two - level nature of the emitter , efficient reflection of light can only occur `` one photon at a time , '' and saturation of the emitter , marking the onset of an increase in transmission , corresponds to a single photon within a pulse of duration @xmath191 ( or , alternatively , within the effective bandwidth of the device ) @xcite . in the present scheme , however , saturation corresponds to a photon number @xmath192 within a ( gaussian ) pulse of duration @xmath193 ( the inverse of the effective bandwidth of our device ) , which may clearly be much larger than one and is not limited by the two - level nature of the atom .",
    "that this is possible is evident from consideration of the output field for our scheme , written in the form @xmath130 .",
    "an atom coupled strongly to normal mode @xmath83 takes this mode far out of resonance , reducing its amplitude essentially to zero and the output field to @xmath194 , where @xmath86 is the orthogonal , uncoupled normal mode , which for coherent input fields is itself simply a coherent field .",
    "the amplitude of @xmath86 is not constrained and is such as to give near ideal destructive interference in the output field @xmath101 ( assuming , of course , operation within the saturation restrictions of the system ) .",
    "let @xmath195 and @xmath196 denote the atomic states coupled via the microtoroid field modes , and let @xmath197 denote an auxiliary internal atomic state ( for example , in another hyperfine level ) that does not couple to the field modes .",
    "if the atom is prepared in a superposition of @xmath195 and @xmath197 , and a coherent state pulse , denoted by @xmath198 , is incident along the fiber ( in input field @xmath31 ) , then under ideal operation of the quantum switch , the following transformation would be implemented , @xmath199 where @xmath200 denotes a vacuum state in @xmath201 . that is , the atomic state becomes entangled with a coherent state pulse ( of potentially quite large photon number , as shown in the previous section ) propagating in either the forward or backward direction along the fiber . with a suitable ( unitary ) rotation and projective measurement of the atomic state ,",
    "this system could therefore be used to prepare entangled coherent states , which are of significant interest in the contexts of , e.g. , quantum information processing and quantum metrology @xcite . however , such states are by nature extremely sensitive ( i.e. , fragile ) to uncontrolled losses , which in the present system arise from intrinsic losses ( i.e. , absorption ) in the resonator modes and from atomic spontaneous emission into free space .",
    "more detailed investigation of the effect of these losses , as well as the influence of key parameter values , on entangled - state preparation is therefore important and now follows .",

    "furthermore , in a linear system all fields remain coherent , so , for the atom in state @xmath195 , we can write the output state of our system as a product of coherent states in each of the possible output channels @xcite , i.e. , @xmath208 with , for example ( see appendix a ) ,    @xmath209 \\ket{0}_{a_{\\rm out , ex } } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath210 @xmath211 is also given in appendix a. note that @xmath24 denotes the output field from the atom into free space ( spontaneous emission ) .",
