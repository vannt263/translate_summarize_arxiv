    "the road towards quantum degeneracy in atomic gases usually starts with a laser cooling and trapping phase .",
    "the resulting initial phase - space density of the atomic ensemble and the initial collision rate should be as large as possible for initiating efficient evaporative cooling to quantum degeneracy .",
    "sub - doppler cooling has proven to be a powerful technique to increase the phase - space density of most alkali atoms and other atoms with multiple level structure  @xcite . however , in the case of lithium and potassium , the narrow excited - state structure of the d@xmath3 transition compromises the efficiency of this cooling scheme  @xcite .",
    "both species possess stable fermionic and bosonic isotopes , and they play an important role in recent experimental studies of strongly correlated quantum gases .",
    "thus , important efforts have been devoted to search for alternative laser cooling schemes .",
    "for instance , it has recently been shown that three dimensional sisyphus cooling for @xmath6li , some ghz red detuned from the d@xmath3 line , can lead to temperatures as low as @xmath7 with up to @xmath8 of the atoms in the cooled fraction  @xcite .",
    "a second option is to operate the magneto - optical trap ( mot ) on a transition with smaller linewidth to reduce the doppler temperature  @xcite .",
    "such transitions exist for @xmath0li and @xmath1k in the near - uv and blue regions of the spectrum , respectively , leading to temperatures of @xmath9 for @xmath0li and @xmath10 for @xmath1k . yet",

    "a simpler sub - doppler cooling scheme using blue detuned molasses operating on the d@xmath2 line was proposed and demonstrated on @xmath1k @xcite and has been extended to other atomic species such as @xmath6li @xcite , @xmath13k @xcite and @xmath0li @xcite . using this technique , temperatures as low as 20  @xmath4k ( @xmath1k ) , 50  @xmath4k ( @xmath6li )",
    ", 6  @xmath4k ( @xmath13k ) and 40  @xmath4k ( @xmath14li ) were reached .",
    "even though the main ingredients of the d@xmath2 cooling scheme are now understood at a qualitative level , in particular the role of the coherences between hyperfine ground - state levels @xcite , a complete picture , taking into account the full level - structure of the atoms , is still missing . in this paper",
    ", we present a three - dimensional semi - classical solution of the optical bloch equations that takes into account the full set of relevant energy levels of alkali atoms and we apply it to the case of @xmath0li and @xmath1k .",
    "the model fully confirms the experimentally observed cooling behaviour and its robustness with respect to changes in experimental parameters .",
    "the model is validated by a good match between the simulation and the experimentally measured temperature and fluorescence rate .",
    "we recover the important role of the raman - detuning between the main cooling laser and the repumping laser on the achievable temperature .",
    "we show here for both @xmath0li and @xmath1k , that the gain in temperature of a factor of @xmath153 at the exact raman - resonance is well reproduced by the theoretical model and that the amount of coherence between both hyperfine states shows a pronounced resonance behavior . beyond individual studies of the two species ,",
    "we also show experimentally that simultaneous cooling of @xmath0li and @xmath1k does not lead to any severe trade - off and is technically easy to implement .",

    "the simulated heating / fluorescence peak positions for low and high intensities ( [ fig : li_fluorescence ] ) agree well with the experimental findings .",
    "also the shift between the heating and fluorescence peak , which increases with the molasses intensity , is numerically reproduced without any freely adjustable parameters .    despite the nice match between simulations and experiments in [ fig : li_fluorescence , fig : li_rep_detuning_intensity - ratio_exp_and_sim ] , we observe that the semi - classical simulations provide temperatures that are systematically a factor two to four lower than the measured ones , particularly near the raman - resonance condition @xmath73 . here",
    "the simulation predicts a temperature of 20  @xmath4k whereas the lowest measured temperature is 50  @xmath4k .",
    "the reason for this is not fully understood and may come both from theory and experimental limitations .",
    "first the simulation is semi - classical and neglects the wavefunction extent of the cold atoms .",
    "the predicted temperature of 20@xmath4k corresponds to only six times the recoil energy @xmath74k .",
    "therefore , only a quantum treatment of the atom s external motion can be expected to give a quantitative equilibrium temperature prediction in the low intensity limit . in the simulation",
    "we observe that slow atoms are likely trapped within sub - wavelength regions , where the light shift is minimal and the atom is nearly decoupled from light over a long time without quantum jump .",
    "this coherent population trapping effect enhances the cooling at both large and small @xmath60 , although it is most pronounced at the raman - resonance ( @xmath73 ) since more choices of decoupled states emerge .",
    "the semi - classical picture clearly exaggerates the cooling effect since the wave nature of the atom s external motion is not included in the model .",
    "in fact , the wave function of the slow atoms will sample a larger volume of the sub - wavelength traps and will shorten the lifetime of the dark periods .    on the experimental side the residual magnetic field cancellation has only been coarsely tuned for the data set presented in [ fig : li_fluorescence ] ( as well as in [ fig : li_rep_detuning_intensity - ratio_exp_and_sim , fig : k_rep_detuning_exp ] ) .",
    "with careful tuning of the magnetic field zeroing we were able to lower the @xmath1k temperature to 11@xmath4k ( [ subsec : raman_k ] on @xmath1k ) for lower density samples .",
    "interestingly , other groups have indeed found on @xmath13k lower temperatures ( 6@xmath4k ) than ours at the raman condition@xcite .",
    "note also that in [ fig : li_fluorescence ] for positive raman detunings ( @xmath75 at low intensity and @xmath76 at high intensity ) the `` temperature '' corresponds to out of equilibrium situations as the atoms are quickly heated away and lost from the molasses .",
    "the notion of temperature should thus be taken with care in this region , unlike for negative raman detunings where a steady - state temperature is reached .",
    "another reason for shortening the lifetime of dark periods of the slow atoms is re - absorption of photons emitted by other atoms .",
    "we have indeed seen a density dependent excess temperature which we measured to be @xmath77 for @xmath1k .",
    "a careful simulation of cooling including photon re - absorption processes is far more complex and is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "we also study the same raman - detuning dependent effects , but for different cooling / repumping ratios .",
    "typical experimental and simulation results are presented in [ fig : li_rep_detuning_intensity - ratio_exp_and_sim ] . here",

    "cooling is most efficient at the raman - resonance ( @xmath73 ) . finally , for @xmath86 equal to @xmath87 , both as large as @xmath88",
    ", we observe less efficient cooling at @xmath73 with moderate heating at blue and red detunings .",
    "typical simulation results for @xmath1k are shown in [ fig : k_coherence_sim]a .",
    "compared to @xmath0li , simulations for @xmath1k require significant higher computational power due to larger internal state dimensions as well as a larger atomic mass and therefore slower cooling dynamics . to save computation time ,",

    "the coherence is peaked at the raman - resonance condition , with a width matching the temperature dip . ]",
    "the agreement between simulation and experiment suggests that the semi - classical picture is able to catch the essential physics behind the d@xmath2 molasses cooling .",
    "in particular , the mechanisms behind the cooling dips and heating peaks in [ fig : li_fluorescence , fig : li_rep_detuning_intensity - ratio_exp_and_sim , fig : k_rep_detuning_exp ] , previously interpreted using the dressed atom picture with a simplified three - level model  @xcite , survive in the full level scheme of the d@xmath2 transition .",
    "it is well known that efficient d@xmath3 sub - doppler cooling requires isolated excited hyperfine levels for alkaline atoms  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the d@xmath2 gray molasses operates well even when all d@xmath2 levels are excited ( as is the case of @xmath0li ) and even at zero excited - state hyperfine splitting as confirmed numerically .",
    "the robustness of d@xmath2 molasses is also seen in its insensitivity to the relative phase between the `` cooling '' and `` repumping '' lattices , a critical parameter for d@xmath3 bichromatic cooling where no polarization gradient was introduced  @xcite .    in the following",
    "we discuss the physics behind the robustness of the d@xmath2 sub - doppler cooling .",
    "we then revisit the cooling dips and heating peaks in [ fig : li_fluorescence , fig : li_rep_detuning_intensity - ratio_exp_and_sim , fig : k_rep_detuning_exp ] .",
    "we notice all the dipole allowed d@xmath2 transitions ( [ fig : li_k_cooling_scheme ] ) are `` open '' : when addressed with weak off - resonant light , the probability of inelastic ( @xmath106- or @xmath107-changing ) photon scattering is comparable to or larger than that of elastic scattering . when blue detuned from the d@xmath2 transitions , an off - resonant bichromatic lattice can establish a correlation between the spatially varying light shift ( due to virtual elastic scattering ) and decay ( due to real inelastic scattering ) for the dressed ground states , since a larger light shift is accompanied with a stronger light - atom coupling and typically a larger inelastic scattering cross - section .",
    "we verify this idea with the full d@xmath2 model for @xmath0li atoms subjected to a 1d lattice with orthogonal linear polarizations ( lin@xmath108lin configuration ) with typical cooling parameters .",
    "the spatially varying light shifts @xmath109 of the six dressed ground states of @xmath0li are plotted in [ fig:1d_obe]a .",
    "the decay of the dressed states , due to inelastic light scattering , are characterized by the decay rate @xmath110 that is plotted versus @xmath109 in [ fig:1d_obe]d .",
    "we see a correlation between @xmath109 and @xmath110 for @xmath111  mhz .",
    "such correlation is robustly established for the d@xmath2 transitions , as verified numerically in the more complicated 3d lattices and for other atomic species .",
    "the correlation even persists for a fictitious atom with vanishing d@xmath2 hyperfine splitting and reduced @xmath106-changing light scattering  @xcite .",
    "such a correlation between the spatially dependent light shift @xmath109 and decay rate @xmath110 has two consequences : first , atoms with @xmath112 tend to accumulate in dressed states with low light shifts , which facilitates cooling through motion - induced coupling to higher energy dressed states  @xcite .",
    "this coupling is non - adiabatic as in the famous @xmath113@xmath114 1d velocity selective coherent population trapping sub - recoil cooling mechanism ( vscpt ) , where the spatial gradient of the atom s wavefunction induces a coupling to a bright state .",
    "second , for a slowly moving atom that adiabatically follows a particular dressed state , the atom tends to leave the dressed state when the light shift is high , leading to sisyphus cooling .",
    "in addition , at locations where @xmath115 , slow atoms can be confined near the local dark states such as those in [ fig:1d_obe]a near @xmath116  .",
    "the resulting optical cooling force is plotted in [ fig:1d_obe]g and is negative ( cooling effect ) over a broad range .",
    "we emphasize that this simplified 1d analysis remains valid in the more complex 3d beam geometry and is not restricted to @xmath0li atoms .",
    "the d@xmath2 laser cooling mechanism applies to all alkalis even those amenable to efficient d@xmath3 sub - doppler cooling such as cesium or rubidium .",
    "as d@xmath2 laser cooling involves dark states it is less affected by density dependent photon multiple scattering and heating than d@xmath3 sub - doppler cooling",
    ". therefore it would be interesting to quantify the gain in phase - space density by applying d@xmath2 sub - doppler cooling for these atoms .    in comparison , sub - doppler cooling on the d@xmath3 lines is significantly different .",

    "will be the subject of a future publication . ] .",
    "we now extend the three - level picture of ref .",
    "@xcite to understand the details of the experiment .",
    "the cooling dips observed both experimentally and numerically at the raman - resonance condition are also fairly easy to understand in the full model : at @xmath73 the resonant raman - coupling splits the @xmath121 hyperfine ground states into a bright and a dark manifold .",
    "the dark manifold is weakly coupled to the molasses .",
    "more precisely , the coupling strength of the raman dark manifold is even weaker than those due to individual cooling / repumping couplings .",
    "therefore the emergence of the raman dark manifold enhances all sub - doppler cooling effects .",
