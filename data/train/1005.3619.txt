    "studies of galactic chemical evolution are dependent on accurately derived abundances of stars spanning all ages , populations , kinematics , masses , and metallicities .",
    "stars with masses @xmath7 are especially important given their dominance of the initial mass function ( imf ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "abundance studies utilizing high - resolution spectroscopy and local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) analyses of near - solar metallicity g and k dwarfs in open clusters and in the disk field , however , have revealed that the observed abundances of at least some elements derived for these cool main sequence ( ms ) dwarfs may be spurious . in particular , studies have found evidence of over - ionization and over - excitation , i.e. , larger abundances are derived from lines of singly ionized species compared to neutral species and from high - excitation lines of neutral species compared to low - excitation lines , respectively . the first indication that some abundances derived for cool ms stars are problematic may have come from @xcite , who found the over - ionization of sc , ti , cr , and fe for a sample of 10 k dwarfs ( @xmath8 @xmath0@xmath9 k ) in the solar neighborhood . after a careful analysis of the procedures and stellar parameters",
    "used in the abundance derivations , the author was unable to account for the overabundances of the ionized species",
    ". found similar over - ionization results for sc , v , cr , fe , and y in five field k dwarfs ( @xmath10 @xmath0  @xmath11 k ) .",
    "the authors could not exclude an inaccurate temperature scale that is several hundred k too low as a possible source of the anomalous abundances , but in the end , they suggest that non - lte ( nlte ) effects are the more likely cause .",
    "open clusters have been important to the identification and continued study of the over - excitation / ionization effects , because the presumed internal chemical homogeneity of the clusters provides a baseline with which anomalous abundances can be compared .",
    "@xcite derived o abundances from the high - excitation ( @xmath12 ev ) near - ir triplet of a k dwarf in each of the the pleiades and ngc 2264 open clusters , and in both cases , the abundances were highly enhanced : [ o / h ] @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "such high o abundances are not expected for clusters with nominal metallicities of [ fe / h ] @xmath15 @xcite and -0.15 @xcite , respectively .",
    "following @xcite , @xcite derived the abundances of ms dwarfs in the m34 cluster ; over - ionization of fe and over - excitation of si ( the abundances of which were derived from lines with excitation potentials in the range @xmath16 ev ) are seen in the coolest stars of the sample .",
    "oxygen abundances of the cool m34 dwarfs , as well as cool pleiades dwarfs , derived from the high - excitation triplet are also highly enhanced @xcite , confirming the earlier results of @xcite .",
    "subsequent to these early open cluster studies , the over - ionization of fe has been confirmed in the hyades @xcite and ursa major ( uma ) moving group @xcite , and of ti in the young pre - ms clusters ic2602 and ic2391 .",
    "overabundances of o derived from the triplet have been reported for the uma moving group @xcite , the hyades @xcite , and ic4665 @xcite .",
    "over - excitation effects have been reported for other elements , as well , including s in the pleiades @xcite , si , ti , ni , and cr in ic4665 @xcite , ni in the hyades @xcite , and ca , ti , and na in ic2602 and ic2391 .",
    "recent abundance analyses of cool field stars have also identified over - excitation / ionization effects , confirming the findings of earlier work .",
    "the over - excitation / ionization abundance anomalies are not thought to represent real photospheric overabundances ; rather , we believe that they are a signal that our knowledge of cool dwarf atmospheres and/or spectral line formation therein is incomplete . as of yet , the source or cause of the effects has not been identified .",
    "systematically erroneous stellar parameters , e.g. , an inaccurate @xmath0  scale , could lead to the observed abundance trends , but in general , unrealistically large parameter errors would have to be present ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , parameter changes made in response to the overabundances of one element often increase those of another ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "nlte effects have been suggested as the cause , but in general , the over - excitation / ionization effects seen in cool dwarfs are in stark contrast to extant nlte calculations .",
    "for instance , lte analyses of the high - excitation triplet in the spectra of ms dwarfs are predicted to result in increasingly discrepant abundances with increasing @xmath0  for stars with @xmath0  @xmath17 k , requiring negative nlte corrections up to 0.4  0.5 dex at 6500 k for solar metallicity dwarfs . below 6000 k ,",
    "the nlte corrections are predicted to be @xmath18 dex and essentially zero below 5500 k .",
    "chromospheric emission and photospheric activity ( spots , plages , and faculae ) have also been suggested sources for the abundance anomalies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "these inhomogeneities could produce apparent over - excitation / ionization effects within a strict lte framework .",
    "continuing our efforts to delineate and understand the observed over - excitation / ionization effects in cool ms dwarfs , we have derived and abundances of 16 pleiades dwarfs , 15 of which have had o abundances derived from the high - excitation triplet @xcite .",
    "the abundances evince a steep increase , reaching [ o / h ] @xmath19 dex near 5000 k , and star - to - star dispersion below 5500 k. we use the newly derived pleiades fe abundances to investigate if the over - excitation and over - ionization effects observed in cool ms dwarfs are related and indeed manifestations of the same phenomenon .",
    "future observational studies that could place stringent constraints on these effects and bring us closer to discovering the source of the anomalous abundances are also discussed .",
    "echelle spectra of 17 pleiades ms dwarfs were obtained with the 9.2-m hobby - eberly telescope ( het ) and high resolution spectrograph ( hrs ) at the mcdonald observatory in queue - mode on 22 separate nights between 2002 august 23 ut and 2003 february 17 ut .",
    "these spectra have been used previously by @xcite and @xcite who analyzed the @xmath20 high - excitation triplet and the @xmath21 line , respectively , in these pleiades dwarfs ; please consult these papers for detailed descriptions of the observations and spectra .",
    "briefly , the het / hrs detector is a 4096 x 4100 side - by - side ccd mosaic of two 2048 x 4100 ccds with 15 @xmath22 m pixels .",
    "the spectra are characterized by a high resolution of r @xmath23 = 60,000 , and they have typical signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratios of 80  100 .",
    "the spectra cover the wavelengths 5095 to 8860  .",
    "data reduction followed the typical practice of using standard iraf routines to remove the bias pattern , subtract scattered light , flat - field , and wavelength - calibrate the spectra .",
    "the stars in our sample are listed in table 1 .",
    "nineteen and seven lines spanning 5793 to 7462  have been analyzed in the spectra of 16 of the seventeen pleiads in our sample ; note , however , that not all of the lines were measurable in all of the stars .",
    "equivalent widths ( ews ) were determined by fitting each line with a gaussian profile using the one - dimensional spectrum analysis software package spectre @xcite .",
    "the ew measurements , along with the wavelength , excitation potential ( @xmath24 ) , and transition probabilities ( @xmath25 ) of each line , are given in tables 2  4 .",
    "atomic data of the lines were obtained by email query to the vienna atomic line database ( vald ) .",
    "one star included in our li study @xcite but not considered here is h ii  152 .",
    "this star was observed on two nights separated by approximately ten months .",
    "as discussed by king et al . , target misidentification on one night is a concern . on the night where it is not a concern ,",
    "the spectra were obtained with a grating setting distinct from the setting used for the other stars in our sample , giving a spectral coverage of 6100 to 9800  .",
    "many of the and lines in our linelist fall outside of the spectral coverage of these data , and consequently , h ii  152 was not included in our analysis here .",
    "the and abundances were derived using the lte stellar line analysis package moog @xcite and model stellar atmospheres with convective overshoot interpolated from the standard atlas9 grids of r. kurucz . in previous analyses of open cluster dwarfs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we have shown that model atmospheres with convective overshoot produce consistent results as those without the overshoot approximation ( nover ) .",
    "presently , we have also tested for a subsample of our stars the more updated kurucz models without overshoot that include the most recent opacity distribution functions ( the odfnew models ) .",
    "the resulting [ /h ]  and [ /h ]   abundances are consistent with those derived using the overshoot models ; the differences range from 0  0.05 dex , with the odfnew - based abundances generally lower , similar to what was found previously for the nover models .",
    "the overshoot models used here are the same ones used by @xcite , from which the adopted stellar parameters are also taken .",
    "one exception is h ii  298 ; for this star , we have used the updated dereddened @xmath26 color of @xcite to calculate new @xmath0 , @xmath27 , and microturbulent velocity ( @xmath28 ) values using the relations described in @xcite and interpolate a new model from the kurucz grids . the adopted stellar parameters for our sample",
    "are provided in table 1 .",
    "line - by - line abundances derived for each of our pleiades stars are listed in tables 2  4 , and the stellar mean abundances can be found in table 5 .",
    "the final mean abundances are given relative to solar values ( table 2 ) derived via an ew analysis of sky spectra obtained with the het / hrs as part of our observational program . the relative abundances are determined on a line - by - line basis before the mean is taken ; this strict line - by - line abundance analysis ensures that the final relative abundances are independent of the adopted oscillator strengths .",
    "the adopted solar parameters are included in table 1 .",
    "the mean [ /h ] abundances and the differences in the mean [ /h ] and [ /h ] abundances ( @xmath29 [ /h ] - [ /h ] ) are plotted in figure 1 along with errorbars for three representative stars h ii  263 , h ii  2284 , and h ii  3179 that run the @xmath0  range of our sample .",
    "the errorbars denote the total internal uncertainties ( @xmath30 ) in the derived abundances .",
    "the @xmath30 uncertainties are the quadratic sum of the abundance uncertainties resulting from errors in the adopted stellar parameters @xcite and the uncertainty in the mean abundance ( table 5 ) .",
    "abundance sensitivities to the stellar parameters were determined by individually altering effective temperature ( @xmath31 ) , surface gravity ( @xmath32 ) , and microturbulent velocity ( @xmath33 ) and are given in table 6 .",
    "the @xmath30 uncertainties in the abundances for the three representative stars are @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 dex for h ii  263 , h ii   2284 , and h ii  3179 , respectively . for , the @xmath30 uncertainties are @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 , respectively .",
    "the errorbars for the [ /h ] - [ /h ] abundances shown in figure 1 represent the quadratically combined and individual @xmath30 uncertainties .",
    "the star - to - star [ /h ] abundances fall within a narrow range of 0.11 dex and have a standard deviation in the mean of 0.04 dex .",
    "however , as can been seen in the left panel of figure 1 , the [ /h ] abundances of stars with @xmath0  @xmath1 k are systematically higher than those of stars at higher @xmath0 .",
    "the discord is verified by the spearman rank correlation coefficient ( @xmath40 ) at the 99.97% confidence level . in the right panel of figure 1 , @xmath2  abundances evince a dramatic increase at about the same @xmath0 , 5400 k. the @xmath2  abundances result from large overabundances of among the cool dwarfs ( table 5 ) , and the @xmath2  vs. @xmath0  trend for the pleiades is similar to those seen in m34 @xcite , the hyades @xcite , and the uma moving group @xcite .      the increase in @xmath2  with decreasing",
    "@xmath0  presented here resembles the trend of increasing pleiades o abundances derived from the high - excitation triplet @xcite . in particular , the increase in the triplet abundances also begins to become significant at approximately 5400 k. in figure 2 @xmath2is plotted against the triplet abundances ( [ o / h]@xmath41 ) , and it is seen that a strong correlation between these two abundance anomalies does exist . according to the linear correlation coefficient ( @xmath42 ) , @xmath2  and [ o / h]@xmath41  are correlated at a greater than 99.9% confidence level .",
    "also in figure 2 we plot the _ residuals _ in the @xmath2  and [ o / h]@xmath41  abundances .",
    "the residuals are differences between the observed abundances and @xmath0-dependent fitted values calculated by fitting low - order ( second or third ) polynomials to the abundance versus @xmath0  relations ( figure 3 ) ; the fitted values are determined at each stellar @xmath0 .",
    "this procedure effectively removes the global mass dependence of the abundances so that the residuals are a measure of star - to - star abundance scatter at a given @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "similar to the @xmath2   and [ o / h]@xmath41  abundances , their residuals are correlated , but at a slightly lower confidence level , 97% ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "the strong relationship between the @xmath2  and [ o / h]@xmath41  abundances and especially their residuals suggests the anomalous abundances share a common origin .",
    "inaccurate @xmath0  scales can give rise to @xmath0-dependent abundance trends if the scales are in error in a systematic way . @xcite",
    "have raised concern as to the accuracy of color - temperature relations , like the one used for our pleiades sample , arguing that disagreements between observed open cluster color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) and theoretical isochrones based on color - temperature relations likely arise from systematic errors in the latter .",
    "@xcite are able to obtain near - perfect agreement between the observed cmds of four nearby open clusters and isochrones using empirical corrections to the color - temperature relations as suggested by @xcite .",
    "inaccurate @xmath0  scales , however , do not appear to be at the root of the over - excitation / ionization effects observed among cool open cluster dwarfs .",
    "the pleiades and hyades [ o / h]@xmath41  abundances of @xcite and @xcite , respectively , were derived using color - temperature relations _ and _ empirically corrected isochrones , and in both cases , the steep trends of increasing abundances with decreasing @xmath0  are present .",
    "the @xmath0  from the empirically corrected isochrones for the majority of dwarfs in both clusters are higher than those from the color - temperature relations , with the differences reaching a maximum of about 190 k. temperature corrections of this magnitude also do not alleviate the large @xmath2  abundances of the coolest stars in our sample . according to the abundance sensitivities given in table 6 ,",
    "the @xmath0  of h ii  263 ( @xmath0  @xmath44 k ) would have to be higher by approximately 750 k in order to bring its and abundances into agreement ; such errors in our adopted temperature scale are not expected @xcite .",
    "furthermore , increasing the @xmath0  of h ii  263 by 750 k would result in an 0.15 dex increase in its abundance and exacerbate the disagreement in the [ /h ] abundances of the cool and warm dwarfs .",
    "whatever the cause of the anomalous @xmath2  abundances , the phenomenon may also be affecting the [ /h ] abundances of the pleiads with @xmath0  @xmath1 k. @xcite found that the abundances of the two coolest m34 dwarfs ( @xmath45 k ) they analyzed are higher by about 0.1 dex than those of the rest of the sample ; the lines have excitation potentials of @xmath46 ev .",
    "similarly , hyades abundances derived from lines with excitation potentials of approximately 4.25 ev increase with decreasing @xmath0  for dwarfs with @xmath0  @xmath47 k @xcite .",
    "more interestingly , the abundances of a single cool hyades dwarf ( @xmath0  @xmath48 k ) derived from lines with excitation potentials of @xmath49 ev were approximately 0.15 dex higher than the abundance derived from a line with a low excitation potential ( @xmath50 ev ) . for a warmer dwarf ( @xmath0  @xmath51 k ) , consistent abundances were obtained from all of the lines ( please see figure 7 of schuler et al . ) .",
    "similar behavior is not seen here in the line - by - line abundances of individual pleiads ( figure 4 ) . however , identifying such excitation potential - related effects for a given cool pleiades star is difficult , because the standard deviation , a measure of the dispersion in the line - by - line abundances , in the mean [ /h ] abundance of each pleiad ranges from 0.04 to 0.13 dex and has an average of 0.07 dex .",
    "this is of the order of the effect seen among the cooler stars in m34 and hyades dwarfs , for which the effect is expected to be more severe .",
    "thus , a direct connection between the heightened mean [ /h ] abundances and the over - excitation phenomenon can not be made , but nonetheless , the fact that the [ /h ] abundances increase at the same @xmath0  as @xmath2  and the triplet abundances is intriguing and suggests that they all are the result of the same effect .",
    "intercluster comparisons of the cool cluster dwarf abundance anomalies can provide valuable insight into the nature of the over - excitation / ionization effects by potentially linking differences in abundance trend morphologies to differences in the physical characteristics of the clusters , such as age and metallicity . in figure 5 the pleiades",
    "@xmath2  values along with those of the hyades from @xcite are plotted versus @xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath2  abundances of these two clusters follow the same trend down to a @xmath0  of about 5200 k , below which the pleiades abundances clearly diverge .",
    "similar behavior is seen in the abundances of dwarfs in the hyades , pleiades and uma moving group @xcite .",
    "the abundances of stars in all three associations increase at similar rates down to a @xmath0  of about 5200 k , below which the pleiades trend becomes much steeper than both of those of the hyades and uma , which continue to track each other .",
    "the uma moving group has an age that is comparable to that of the hyades @xcite and a metallicity that is lower than both pleiades and hyades @xcite .",
    "the divergence of the pleiades triplet abundances from those of both the hyades and uma suggests that the abundance trends may undergo an age - related diminution ; the @xmath2  abundances of the pleiades and hyades are consistent with this conclusion .",
    "chromospheric emission and photospheric spots are two age - related phenomena that have been discussed in the literature as possible sources of the observed over - excitation / ionization effects .",
    "@xcite demonstrated using multicomponent model atmospheres that spotted photospheres can plausibly account for the triplet abundances of the cool hyades dwarfs .",
    "results from efforts investigating a possible connection between chromospheric activity and the anomalous triplet abundances of cool dwarfs , on the other hand , have been mixed .",
    "no correlation between h@xmath3 and infrared triplet emission measures and triplet abundances of pleiades dwarfs nor m34 dwarfs exists @xcite .",
    "however , found a strong correlation between x - ray activity indicators and pleiades triplet abundances taken from the literature .",
    "there is no correlation between h+k emission indicators and the hyades triplet abundances @xcite . for the young cluster ic4665 , @xcite",
    "show that the abundances of the cool dwarfs are highly correlated with both h@xmath3 and infrared triplet emission indicators .",
    "it is important to note that shen et al .",
    "is the only of these studies that derived the abundances and chromospheric emission levels from the same spectra . for the others ,",
    "the measurements were made or taken from different sources , and thus the actual chromospheric emission level may have been different when the spectral lines were formed .    as can be seen from these various studies ,",
    "it is not clear if there is a connection between chromospheric emission and the over - excitation of .",
    "furthermore , chromospheric emission is often correlated with @xmath0 , so any correlation between chromospheric emission and abundances may be masking some other @xmath0-dependent effect @xcite . using the chromospheric emission data from @xcite , we have plotted the pleiades @xmath2  versus infrared triplet chromospheric emission indicators ( @xmath52 ) in figure 6 and find a correlation that is significant at greater than the 99.9% confidence level according to the linear correlation coefficient ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "a similar correlation is found for the h@xmath3 chromospheric emission ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "these correlations , while suggestive of a connection between chromospheric emission and the over - ionization of fe , should be viewed with caution , because @xmath54  and @xmath52  are also correlated with @xmath0  at approximately the 93% and 98% confidence levels .",
    "this degeneracy makes it unclear if the @xmath2  abundances , like those of , are affected by chromospheric emission or some other @xmath0-dependent effect .",
    "more importantly , residual @xmath2  abundances and residual chromospheric emission indicators ( calculated in the same manner as the abundance residuals , i.e. , they are the differences between observed and @xmath0-dependent fitted values ; please see figure 3 ) are correlated at the 93% and 99.9% confidence levels for h@xmath3 and infrared triplet , respectively ( figure 6 ) .",
    "these relationships are more indicative of a true correlation between chromospheric emission and the over - ionization of fe .",
    "we remind the reader , however , that the @xmath2  abundances and chromospheric emission indicators were not measured using the same spectra and are thus not cotemporal .",
    "@xcite have used the same het / hrs spectra analyzed here to examine the long - standing problem of the large li abundance dispersion observed among cool pleiades dwarfs .",
    "these authors find evidence that at least a portion of the dispersion is due to real li depletion and suggest that the differential depletion may be a consequence of stellar radius modulations induced by surface magnetic activity , i.e. , spots , during pre - ms evolution .",
    "it is also suggested that such spot - induced effects could be related to the over - excitation / ionization effects observed today .",
    "@xmath2  residuals are plotted versus li abundance residuals in figure 7 .",
    "li abundances are derived from @xmath55 line strengths and are taken from @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2  and li residuals relation has a correlation coefficient of @xmath56 , corresponding to a @xmath5791% confidence level .",
    "while only marginally significant at best , the mild correlation still means that a substantial fraction ( nearly - half ) of the variance in @xmath2  is related to that in li .",
    "the abstract picture painted by this result is consistent with the conjecture presented by @xcite : the considerable li abundance dispersion in cool pleiades dwarfs has a real pre - ms depletion component , a portion of which may be driven by the same mechanism ( the influence of spots ) but perhaps by different physics ( the influence on stellar structure versus the influence on line formation in addition to or independent of stellar structure ) that is also possibly responsible for the versus differences seen in these stars .",
    "this would explain the overlap in the variance of pleiades @xmath2  and li abundances but allow for only marginally significant present - day correlations between these observables .",
    "observational tests , using the same type of pleiades spectroscopic / photometric monitoring program proposed in the conclusions section below , of this possibility are discussed in @xcite .",
    "the mean abundance of the pleiades stars above 5400 k derived from lines is [ fe / h ] @xmath6 ( uncertainty in the mean ) compared to [ fe / h ] @xmath58 ( uncertainty in the mean ) for stars below 5400 k. while a direct connection between the high [ /h ]  abundances and the over - excitation effects manifested in the [ o / h]@xmath41   abundances of cool open cluster dwarfs can not be made here , the similarities are suggestive and raise doubt as to the accuracy of the cool star [ /h ]  abundances .",
    "for this reason , and because of the anomalously high abundances , we feel that the mean cluster metallicity is best estimated by the [ /h ]  abundances of the warmer stars only , and adopt the value of [ fe / h ] @xmath6 for the pleiades .",
    "the pleiades is one of the most well studied galactic open clusters , and fe abundances of member f , g , and k dwarfs have been derived using high - resolution spectroscopy by a handful of groups , which are summarized in table 7 .",
    "@xcite found a mean abundance of [ fe / h ] @xmath59 from one f and three g dwarfs , though the abundances are characterized by a large dispersion ( 0.02  0.26 dex ) .",
    "the spectra of three of the stars have s / n ratios of @xmath60 .",
    "in the same year , @xcite report a cluster mean abundance of [ fe / h ] @xmath61 for 13 f stars that have standard deviations in their individual [ fe / h ] abundances @xmath62 dex ; the mean abundance of their entire 17 star sample is [ fe / h ] @xmath63 .",
    "subsequent to that , @xcite and @xcite find similar values , [ fe / h ] @xmath64 and -0.02 , respectively .",
    "@xcite derived the abundances of two cool pleiades k dwarfs and obtained a mean abundance of [ fe / h ] @xmath65 from an analysis of lines .",
    "this value is almost identical to that of the stars with @xmath0  @xmath1 k in our sample , and we suspect that the abundances of the two k dwarfs from king et al . are similarly suspect .",
    "however , @xcite also derived a mean abundance of [ fe / h ] @xmath65 but for five f dwarfs .",
    "these authors noted that their result is slightly larger than that of @xcite and suggested differences in the analyses , i.e. , spectral lines used and adopted stellar parameters , as a possible cause .",
    "finally , @xcite have recently reported a cluster abundance of [ fe / h ] @xmath66 based on 22 a , f , and g stars .    excluding the results of @xcite due to poor data quality and those of @xcite due to the uncertainty in the abundances of the two cool k dwarfs studied , the mean pleiades cluster abundance of the six remaining studies , including ours , is [ fe / h ] @xmath67 with a standard deviation of @xmath68 .",
    "this is identical to the value from the five stars with @xmath0  @xmath69 k in our sample , and by our assessment , represents the best estimate of the pleiades cluster metallicity .",
    "we have derived fe abundances via an ew analysis of and lines in high - resolution and moderate - s / n spectra of 16 ms dwarfs in the pleiades open cluster .",
    "the [ /h ]  abundances increase dramatically relative to [ /h ]  at @xmath0  below 5400 k , with the difference reaching over 0.8 dex in the coolest stars .",
    "this behavior is akin to what is seen in m34 , the hyades , and the uma moving group .",
    "comparison of the @xmath2  abundance patterns in the pleiades and hyades , as well as the [ o / h]@xmath41  abundances in the pleiades , hyades , and uma moving group , suggests that the trends may relax with age , though metallicity may yet prove to be a factor .",
    "abundances of cool dwarfs in additional open clusters or other stellar associations , especially those older than the hyades , are needed to determine if either age or metallicity are related to these anomalous abundances .",
    "the [ /h ]  abundances are also higher in pleiads below 5400 k , but they show no evidence of an increase with decreasing @xmath0 .",
    "the inability to attribute the high [ /h ]   abundances of the cool stars to the over - excitation effects illustrates the difficulty of quantifying this phenomenon . with lines of exceptionally high excitation potential such as the triplet ,",
    "the over - excitation effect is clearly seen ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but for lines with excitation potentials @xmath70 ev , the effect is more difficult to pinpoint .",
    "our linelist includes transitions ranging in excitation potential from 2.18 to 5.10 ev , but for the individual pleiades stars , no increase in the line - by - line abundances as a function of excitation potential , like that seen in abundances of cool hyades dwarfs ( 1.83 ev @xmath71 4.42 ev ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , is evident ( figure 4 ) .",
    "line - to - line sensitivities to the over - excitation / ionization effects have yet to be clearly delineated , and it needs to be determined if there is an excitation potential threshold above which the abundances derived from these lines become enhanced by these effects .",
    "similarly , it needs to be determined if there is an excitation potential threshold _ below _ which the opposite occurs , the abundances derived from the low - excitation lines are lower due to these effects .",
    "such behavior would be expected if the overabundances of high - excitation ( singly ionized ) lines are due to the overpopulation of high - excitation ( singly ionized ) electronic states at the expense of depopulating low - excitation states . whether or not the over - excitation effects impact the spectroscopic derivation of stellar parameters ( @xmath0 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 ) , an approach not adopted here , also needs to be determined .",
    "future investigations of these effects will require high - quality high - resolution spectroscopy so that accurate line - by - line abundances can be derived , even from features of just a few m in strength .",
    "a strong correlation between the @xmath2  and [ o / h]@xmath41  abundances of the pleiades dwarfs is evident in figure 2 , suggesting that the over - excitation / ionization effects share a common cause or origin .",
    "chromospheric emission and photospheric spots have been shown to be promising culprits , but to this point , the data are inconclusive . whereas strong correlations between the pleiades @xmath2  and chromospheric emission indicators and their residuals exist , they do not exist between [ o / h]@xmath41  and chromospheric emission .",
    "these contradictory results complicate the interpretation of the observed over - excitation / ionization effects and will have to be addressed by future studies .",
    "also , comparing abundances and chromospheric emission indicators measured using different spectra may not provide an accurate test of a true correlation because of potential temporal changes in chromospheric activity levels .",
    "future investigations into the over - excitation / ionization effects in cool open cluster dwarfs should make every effort to derive chromospheric activity levels from the same spectra so that any possible relation between the two can be more definitively delineated .",
    "determining the influence of photospheric spots on abundance derivations is more arduous .",
    "multicomponent model atmospheres- simulating photospheres with different areal coverages of hot , cool , and quiescent spots- have been shown to able to reproduce the measured ews of the triplet in a sample of hyades stars , but , while such exercises are useful and demonstrate the plausibility of the photospheric spot hypothesis , the results are only suggestive .",
    "observationally , a simultaneous photometric and spectroscopic monitoring program could be used to identify any correlated changes in spot coverage and spectral line strengths .",
    "such observational constraints would be helpful to determine if spotted photospheres affect high - resolution abundance derivations . despite the challenges , the possible connection between spots , over - excitation / ionization effects , and pre - ms li depletion should provide sufficient motivation for future efforts .",
    "a final conclusion that can be drawn from this study is that those carrying out spectroscopic abundance analyses of open clusters should heed caution when their samples include cool dwarfs , particularly those with @xmath0",
    "@xmath1 k. including the abundances of these stars may skew cluster mean abundances .",
    "a similar caution may be needed for those studying cool ms dwarfs in the disk field , as well .",
    "further investigations into the sensitivity of the over - excitation / ionization effects to excitation potential , first ionization potential , stellar age , and stellar metallicity are needed in order to identify the extent and ubiquity of these effects .",

    "<S> we have derived fe abundances of 16 solar - type pleiades dwarfs by means of an equivalent width analysis of and lines in high - resolution spectra obtained with the hobby - eberly telescope and high resolution spectrograph . </S>",
    "<S> abundances derived from lines are larger than those derived from lines ( herein referred to as over - ionization ) for stars with @xmath0  @xmath1 k , and the discrepancy ( @xmath2  = [ /h ] - [ /h ] ) increases dramatically with decreasing @xmath0 , reaching over 0.8 dex for the coolest stars of our sample . the pleiades joins the open clusters m34 , the hyades , ic2602 , and ic2391 , and the ursa major moving group , demonstrating ostensible over - ionization trends . </S>",
    "<S> the pleiades @xmath2  abundances are correlated with infrared triplet and h@xmath3 chromospheric emission indicators and relative differences therein . </S>",
    "<S> oxygen abundances of our pleiades sample derived from the high - excitation triplet have been previously shown to increase with decreasing @xmath0 , and a comparison with the @xmath2  abundances suggests that the over - excitation ( larger abundances derived from high excitation lines relative to low excitation lines ) and over - ionization effects that have been observed in cool open cluster and disk field main sequence ( ms ) dwarfs share a common origin . </S>",
    "<S> curiously , a correlation between the pleiades abundances and chromospheric emission indicators does not exist . </S>",
    "<S> star - to - star abundances have low internal scatter ( @xmath4 dex ) , but the abundances of stars with @xmath0@xmath1 k are systematically higher compared to the warmer stars . </S>",
    "<S> the cool star [ /h ] abundances can not be connected directly to over - excitation effects , but similarities with the @xmath2  and triplet trends suggest the abundances are dubious . using the [ /h ] abundances of five stars with @xmath0  @xmath5 k , we derive a mean pleiades cluster metallicity of [ fe / h ] @xmath6 . </S>"
