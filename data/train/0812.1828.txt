    "it is believed that active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are powered by accretion of matter on to massive black holes , and the observed uv / optical emission of agn is thought to be a thermal emission from the standard geometrically thin , optically thick accretion discs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "most gravitational energy is generated in the cold disc , probably through turbulence produced by the magneto - rotational instability @xcite .",
    "the magnetic fields generated in the cold disc are strongly buoyant , and a substantial fraction of magnetic energy is transported vertically to heat the corona above the disc with the reconnection of the fields ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "it was found that the temperature of the hot electrons in the corona is roughly around @xmath8  k , which can successfully reproduce a power - law hard x - ray spectrum as observed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the physical processes of turbulence triggered by the amplified magnetic fields in the disc are very complicated , and quite unclear , though they are revealed to some extent with numerical magneto - hydrodynamical ( mhd ) simulations @xcite .",
    "the so - called  @xmath9-prescription \" is widely adopted in most of the works on accretion discs @xcite , in which the magnetic stress tensor is assumed to be proportional to the total pressure ( @xmath10 ) , gas pressure @xmath11 , or @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the magnetic stress tensor @xmath3 was suggested in @xcite , however , the disc is thermal unstable if the radiation pressure dominates over the gas pressure @xcite(but also see * ? ? ?",
    "it was argued that the magnetic field amplification is likely to be limited to that the magnetic pressure is less than the gas pressure even in the inner radiation - pressure - dominated regions , i.e. , @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the disc with this stress tensor is thermal stable @xcite .",
    "the stress tensor @xmath4 was initially suggested by @xcite based on the idea that the viscosity is proportional to the gas pressure , but the size of turbulence should be limited by the disc scaleheight that is given in terms of the total pressure .",
    "this is also supported by the analysis on the local dynamical instabilities in magnetized , radiation - pressure - supported accretion discs @xcite , which also leads to @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the magnetic pressure , and @xmath16 is a constant of the order of unity ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "@xcite argued that the accretion disc model with @xmath2 is too stable to explain the unstable behaviour observed in grs  1915 + 105 , and they further suggested that it is possible to couple the radiation to the particles through collisions and thereby allow the radiation pressure to contribute to the stress tensor to some extent .",
    "as the complexity of the physics in the radiation - pressure - dominated fluids , any one of these stress tensors should only be regarded as a possible option in accretion discs .",
    "the hard x - ray observations on agn may provide useful clues on the accretion disc - corona models .",
    "@xcite compiled a sample of radio - quite agn , and found a strong correlation between @xmath17 and @xmath0 , which was conformed by @xcite with a different agn sample .",
    "this correlation was then used to constrain the disc - corona models with different magnetic stress tensors , and they found that the model with magnetic stress tenor @xmath18 is favored by the correlation of @xmath19 . it was also found that the spectral index of hard x - ray continuum emission is correlated with the eddington ratio @xcite . @xcite",

    "the hard x - ray emission originates from the compton scattering of the soft photons by the hot electrons in the corona .",
    "therefore , the correlations of the hard x - ray spectral index with the eddington ratio / compton reflection , together with the correlation of @xmath19 , provide important constraints on the accretion disc - corona model .",
    "the parallel plane homogeneous corona is unable to produce an x - ray spectrum with @xmath20 in 210  kev .",
    "the x - ray photons radiated from the corona are reprocessed in the cold disc , and the reprocessed photons irradiate the corona , which cool the corona and lead to rather soft x - ray spectra with @xmath21 . in the patchy corona model proposed by @xcite , the corona appears as individual blobs above the cold disc .",
    "most of the reprocessed photons do not enter the blob , so the cooling is significantly reduced and the blobs are hotter than the parallel plane homogeneous corona , which leads to harder x - ray spectra .",
    "this model can explain the observed hard x - ray spectra with @xmath20 in some agn ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , however , it is still unable to explain the correlation between the compton reflection and the hard x - ray spectral index for seyfert galaxies and x - ray binaries @xcite , which is also the case for the parallel plane homogeneous corona model .",
    "@xcite suggested that a central hot plasma surrounded by a cold disc may explain the correlation of the compton reflection with the hard x - ray spectral index .",
    "in this scenario , the cold disk is truncated at a certain radius @xmath22 , within which the hot plasma may possibly correspond to an advection dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the radiation of the hot plasma is dominated by the inverse compton scattering of the soft photons from the outer cold disc , while the cold disc is irradiated by the inner hot plasma .",
    "thus , the compton reflection component decreases with increasing the inner radius of the cold disc , which leads to less soft seed photons from the cold disc entering the hot plasma and then the harder x - ray spectrum from the hot plasma .",
    "the correlation between the compton reflection and the hard x - ray spectral index can be reproduced by this model ( see * ? ? ? * for the details ) .",
    "an alternative model was proposed by @xcite to explain the correlation between the compton reflection and the x - ray spectral index . in this model , the hot plasma above the cold disc",
    "is assumed to move away from the cold disc at a mild relativistic velocity .",
    "such an outflow reduces the downward flux , and then reduces both the reflection and reprocessing in the cold disc .",
    "the reduction of the reprocessing leads to less incident soft seed photons and cooling in the hot plasma above the cold disc , and in turn leads to harder x - ray spectrum @xcite .    in this work , we take these different magnetic stress tensors as candidates in our disc - corona model calculations , which could be tested with the x - ray observations of agn .",

    "<S> the hard x - ray emission of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) is believed to originate from the hot coronae above the cold accretion discs . </S>",
    "<S> the hard x - ray spectral index is found to be correlated with the eddington ratio @xmath0 , and the hard x - ray bolometric correction factor @xmath1 increases with the eddington ratio . </S>",
    "<S> the compton reflection is also found to be correlated with the hard x - ray spectral index for seyfert galaxies and x - ray binaries . </S>",
    "<S> these observational features provide very useful constraints on the accretion disc - corona model for agn . </S>",
    "<S> we construct an accretion disc - corona model and calculate the spectra with different magnetic stress tensors in the cold discs , in which the corona is assumed to be heated by the reconnection of the magnetic fields generated by buoyancy instability in the cold accretion disc . </S>",
    "<S> our calculations show that the magnetic stress tensor @xmath2 fails to explain all these observational features , while the disc - corona model with @xmath3 always leads to constant @xmath1 independent of the eddington ratio . </S>",
    "<S> the resulted spectra of the disc - corona systems with @xmath4 show that both the hard x - ray spectral index and the hard x - ray bolometric correction factor @xmath1 increase with the eddington ratio , which are qualitatively consistent with the observations . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the disc - corona model is unable to reproduce the observed very hard x - ray continuum emission from the sources accreting at low rates ( e.g. , @xmath5 for @xmath6 ) , which may imply the different accretion mode in these low luminosity sources . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that the disc - corona system transits to an advection - dominated accretion flow@xmath7disc corona system at low accretion rates , which may be able to explain all the above - mentioned correlations .    </S>",
