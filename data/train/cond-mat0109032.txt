    "the magnetic flux trapping ability of bulk high - temperature superconductors ( hts ) , which promises their wide usage as cryomagnets @xcite operating at liquid nitrogen temperature @xmath3 , depends on their critical current density @xmath4 and the length scale @xmath5 over which it flows @xcite .",
    "therefore , rather large sizes ( @xmath6 ) are required for existing reba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 ( re : y , sm , eu , nd , _ etc . _ ) crystals with @xmath4 @xmath7 to trap the peak fields @xmath8 and , consequently , to seem more attractive than conventional permanent magnets . however , so large distances , which the growth front has to cover from the seeding point , inevitably result in negative changes of growth conditions .",
    "that is why dewhurst _",
    "et al . _  observed a certain degradation of the crystal microstructure in the radial direction ( from the crystal center towards the edges ) and , because of a short coherence length @xmath9 ( e.g. , @xmath10 and @xmath11 in the yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2  ( ybco ) material ) , that of superconducting properties @xcite .",
    "apart from the radial inhomogeneities the lateral ones were also recently revealed @xcite .",
    "in particular , the lateral distribution of a flux trapped by the ybco crystal after its magnetization by short magnetic pulses , was demonstrated to ensue from its growth in five growth sectors ( gs ) , i.e. the sectors grown on different habit planes ( see fig.[sample ] ) .        this paper reports the detailed study how superconducting properties of a large ybco sample vary along the a - habits , ( 100 ) and/or ( 010 ) , and correlates these effects with the spatial distribution of the structure inhomogeneities , i.e. grain boundaries ( gb ) , y@xmath12bacuo@xmath13 ( 211 ) inclusions and oxygen deficient zones .",
    "the obtained data are hard to explain in terms of flat habitus planes , these testify to concave growth fronts .",
    "the ybco sample with a diameter of @xmath14 and a thickness of @xmath15 was fabricated from the mixture of commercially purchased powders ( solvay gmbh , germany ) with 1wt.% ceo@xmath12 by usual peritectic solidification , which details are given in refs.@xcite , and post - annealed in oxygen atmosphere .",
    "the ybco crystal appeared a large single grain ( please , note nearly regular tetragonal shape of isolines on the remanent flux map , fig.[sample]c ) which grew as shown in figs.[sample](a),(b ) , i.e. in four a - gss grown on the ( 100 ) , ( 010 ) , ( @xmath1600 ) and ( 0@xmath160 ) habit planes and c - gs which habit , ( 001 ) , is perpendicular to the cylinder axis @xcite .",
    "[ slice ]    a slice of width @xmath17 ( marked in fig.[sample](b ) by dashed lines ) was first cut through a whole sample and a structure of the ybco material nearby its top surface ( i.e. inside the a - gss ) was studied in a polarized light .",
    "we found out that the boundaries ( a - a - gsbs ) of two adjacent a - gss are free of subgrains , the subgrain - free band of @xmath18 thickness bears from the top surface down to the c - gs . the more the distance from a - a - gsbs , the larger becomes the polarized light contrast which follows an increase of mis - orientation angle between neighboring subgrains @xcite .",
    "the spatial distribution of 211-inclusions along the a - habit presented in figs.[slice](a ) , ( b ) seems also closely related to the growth of the ybco crystal in gss .",
    "both their average size @xmath19 and volume fraction @xmath20 dependencies have nicely symmetric , w - like shape .",
    "similar behavior is registered for the transition temperature @xmath21 presented in fig.[slice](d ) . to obtain these data as well as distributions of critical current densities",
    "@xmath22 at different temperatures shown in figs.[slice](e ) , ( f ) , the slice was diced into 11 samples ( each of sizes @xmath23 ) , which magnetic properties were measured with ac - susceptometer ( 0.1oe , 20khz ) and vibrating sample magnetometer ( oxford instruments , vsm3001 ) .",
    "in fact , the plot ( d ) presents two temperatures where the transition starts ( @xmath21 ) and ends .",
    "these are determined as the points wherein ac - susceptibility @xmath24 ( normalized to unity ) approaches the values @xmath25 ( circles ) and @xmath26 ( squares ) , respectively .",
    "the open points are obtained when @xmath27 , the closed ones correspond to @xmath28 .    the lowest - level @xmath4 isoline at @xmath29 ( solid black curve in fig.[slice]e ) , i.e. the line connecting the irreversibility points @xmath30 of studied samples , confirms the w - like distribution of @xmath21 which , according to a common opinion @xcite , reflects a difference in an oxygen content .",
    "since an oxygen is easy to penetrate into imperfect material containing cracks and subgrain boundaries , a quenched liquid exhibits the higher @xmath21 . in",
    "more structurally perfect crystal @xmath21 decreases anywhere except for the central part ( @xmath31 ) of the a - gss .",
    "thus , this area may be expected somewhat alike in structure to a quenched liquid .    at lower temperatures",
    "an oxygen influence on superconducting properties is no longer dominant ( see fig.[slice]f ) .",
    "the @xmath32 dependencies look more homogeneous ( e.g , within the ybco crystal @xmath33 ) and are well fitted by the @xmath34-power law ( @xmath35 , where @xmath36 ) , which is attributed to the 211-inclusions @xcite . besides , the spatial distribution of @xmath37 ( fig.[slice]g ) along the a - growth front looks quite similar to the value @xmath38 which is presented in fig.[slice](c ) and directly calculated from the @xmath20 and @xmath19 polynomial fit ( solid lines )",
    ". some diversities are easy to explain : in contrast to @xmath38 , @xmath39 curve corresponds to the 211-distribution _ averaged _ over the finite slice thickness , @xmath17 .",
    "[ concave ]",
    "in summary , one can conclude that structural and superconducting properties agree well each with other , but both are hard to explain in terms of a suggestion that a - habits are flat . at the same time , these features are readily derived from the hypothesis of concave growth fronts ( see fig.[concave ] ) . within this approach ,",
    "the ybco crystal _ first _ grows along the x - like backbone , i.e. in the [ 110 ] , [ 1@xmath160 ] , [ @xmath1610 ] and [ @xmath400 ] directions ( dashed arrows ) , whereas the _ secondary _ growth fronts , which respond for material inside a - gss , are parallel to the [ 100 ] and [ 010 ] directions ( shown by small double arrows ) .",
    "since during the growth process the crystal scarcely reveals so strong pillow distortion as this shown in fig.[concave ] , the secondary growth fronts are expected to move much _ faster _ than those forming the backbone. it certainly results in large mechanical stresses inside the a - gss and , therefore , an appearance of subgrains trying to reduce these stresses . in terms of the pushing / trapping theory @xcite , faster motion of secondary growth fronts",
    "may also explain an increased values of @xmath19 and @xmath20 shown in figs.[slice](a ) , ( b ) .",
    "at last , the square shape of ybco crystals , which is well confirmed by , for instance , the remanent flux map in fig.[sample](c ) , means that growth process stops when the backbone reaches the size of a crucible .",
    "if the growth mechanism is different from the mentioned above , the crystal could grow until _ a whole _",
    "crystal fits in a crucible , i.e. in a circle .",
    "the work was supported by the german bmbf under the project no13n6854a3 .",
    "the authors would like to thank z.h.he and p.diko for illuminating discussions as well as r.mller for his continual encouragement throughout the present work .",
    "we are also indebted to p.dittman , m.arnz and ch.schmidt for technical support ."
