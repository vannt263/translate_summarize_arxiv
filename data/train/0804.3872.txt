    "the ability of the hubbard repulsion @xmath0 to drive transitions to insulating behavior is widely studied and known @xcite . however , in the recent years considerable interest is devoted to the study of the converse phenomenon , namely the delocalization effect produced by @xmath0 @xcite . this effect attracts much attention given by the unexpected nature of the process , since it can finally lead to an interaction driven metallic behavior starting from an insulator , instead to drive transitions to insulating behavior from a metal , as intuitively is expected .",
    "the interest for understanding the delocalization effect of @xmath0 has been first set up by the observed conducting behavior in two dimensional ( 2d ) disordered systems @xcite where the electrons are localized in the starting non - interacting phase by disorder .",
    "but , opposed to the random case , periodic external potential is also able to cause insulating behavior , hence can be as well used as a starting point in investigating the delocalization effect of @xmath0 . on this line",
    "the ionic hubbard model is investigated at half filling in different approximations , or numerical methods , starting from dynamical mean field theory @xcite , it s cluster version @xcite or quantum monte carlo technique @xcite , obtaining insulator to metal transition in 2d , even if several aspects of the results are under debate @xcite .    on the other side , the clear physical reason for the @xmath0 produced delocalization is far to be properly understood . up to this moment only correlation screening of the one - body potential responsible for the insulating phase @xcite has been invoked as an intuitive possibility for explanation .    in order to understand the physical reasons for a possible insulator to metal transition caused by the hubbard @xmath0 we have to pay attention to two aspects which must concur in producing a conducting behavior starting from an insulator @xcite : i ) the one - particle states must become extended , and ii ) the gap in the charge excitation spectrum must disappear .",
    "the correlation screening of the one - body potential can be in principle a physical insight in explaining point ii ) , but it does not explain how , given by @xmath0 , point @xmath1 becomes also satisfied , e.g. how the state becomes extended given by the hubbard interaction in a genuine multielectronic case .",
    "the deep physical reasons of this last process are not clearly known , and in my knowledge have not been directly investigated so far at a genuine multielectronic level in conditions of interest here , e.g. around half filling .    the purpose of the presented paper is to provide valuable information regarding this issue . during the paper we aim to answer the question : is there a direct evidence that @xmath0 , in the studied circumstances is able to extend one - particle states ? to obtain a valuable answer , the description is made here at exact level in 2d .",
    "our strategy is to deduce in a non - approximated manner the exact ground states in conditions of interest .",
    "a such obtained state will be a genuine multielectronic state , hence usually , is not possible to discuss rigorously about one - particle states in its frame .",
    "but , based on it , one - particle behavior can be tested by calculating the expectation value of the long - range hopping type of correlations @xmath2 where @xmath3 represents the number of lattice sites , and @xmath4 creates an electron at site @xmath5 with spin @xmath6 .",
    "the study will be given in this paper for the non - disordered case in homogeneous conditions , hence @xmath7 holds .",
    "during such a study , the one - particle localization length @xmath8 can be also introduced by @xmath9 . in order to answer the question aimed to be investigated here , one simply must analyzes whether , or",
    "not , @xmath0 is able to increase @xmath10 and @xmath8 in the conditions of interest .    in order to fix the frame of the study",
    ", we must clarify the nature of the _ circumstances of interest_. on this line one observes that in both cases mentioned in the introductory part , the @xmath0 driven delocalization effect emerges on the background of a macroscopic degeneracy .",
    "indeed in the disordered cases the ground states are macroscopically degenerate @xcite , while in the ionic hubbard model case the effects are observed in the neighborhood of the point where the single occupancy at one - one site of the sublattices a and b have the same energy as an empty site in a and a double occupied site in b @xcite .",
    "furthermore , one knows that the ionic hubbard model is of two band type @xcite , while real materials , also disordered once , have a multiband structure which one usually projects in a few band picture @xcite .",
    "this projection is stopped here for convenience at the two band level .",
    "given by these observations , one realizes that in order to find the physical insights of interest here , one must considers a prototype two band model in 2d .",
    "the non - interacting case must be set in the position of a macroscopic degeneracy from the point of view of the one particle states such to find an insulator at @xmath11 .",
    "this can be achieved by choosing the hamiltonian parameters such to provide a bare flat ( e.g. macroscopically degenerate ) lowest band , separated by a finite gap from the upper dispersive bare band , and fixing the filling of the system to half ( e.g. lowest band : completely filled , upper band separated by a gap : empty ) .",
    "after this step one turns on @xmath0 , and analyzes its effect .    this experience is quite interesting also because one knows that turning on the interaction in many - body systems with macroscopic degeneracy , one always finds a fascinating physics as for example in the case of the laughlin state in two dimensions @xcite , hubbard chains with bare degenerate bands @xcite , or geometrically frustrated spin systems @xcite .",
    "the prototype two band model chosen for the study in this paper will be the periodic anderson model ( pam ) , simply because several technical aspects regarding its ground state construction are known @xcite .",
    "the pam has been constructed to be the simplest microscopic model used to investigate the characteristic properties of heavy fermion and intermediate - valence compounds containing elements with incompletely filled f - shells @xcite , but serves as well , as a test prototype two band model used in various circumstances of interest @xcite .",
    "the pam consists of strongly correlated , almost localized f - electrons which experience an on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath12 , and hybridize with a band of non - interacting conduction ( d- ) electrons .",
    "in contrast to the one dimensional hubbard model , pam is not integrable even in dimension @xmath13 .",
    "therefore our knowledge of the physics described by the pam at finite and nonzero @xmath0 is almost exclusively obtained by approximate methods .",
    "notable exceptions are the constructed exact ground states in dimensions @xmath14 , at and below @xmath15 , or at and above @xmath16 filling @xcite , e.g. @xmath17 \\cup [ 3/4,1)$ ] , where @xmath18 is the number of electrons .",
    "the physically quite interesting region situated at and in the vicinity of half filling , strongly debated at the level of different approximations or numerical methods @xcite , lacks exact results for @xmath19 .",
    "the used technique casts the hamiltonian in a positive semidefinite form @xcite , and the fact that a such expression has the possible minimum eigenvalue zero , represents the route in obtaining the exact ground states @xcite .",
    "the method can be applied even in unexpected situations in the context of exact solutions , as @xcite @xmath20 , disordered and interacting systems in 2d @xcite , non - integrable hubbard chains in external fields @xcite , or stripe , checkerboard and droplet ground states @xcite in 2d .",
    "however , given by strong correlation effects not treatable mathematically up to this moment in the studied concentration region , it has not yet been applied for the pam at finite @xmath21 around half filling .",
    "the deduced results provide the first exact ground states for the 2d generic pam at half filling and finite value of the interaction .",
    "this is achieved by the use of extended operators in constructing the ground state , technique which is described also for the first time in the context of non - integrable systems in this paper .",
    "the comparison of ground states at @xmath11 and @xmath12 on the line of ( [ intr1 ] ) shows that the hubbard repulsion , by strongly diminishing the double occupancy , spread out the contributions in the ground state , hence is able to increase by several order of magnitudes the one - particle localization length .",
    "hence the one - particle behavior in the analyzed conditions is extended by @xmath0 , which is a clear physical source of a delocalization effect .",
    "consequently , the answer to the question we are looking for in this paper is : yes . i also note that one already knows that even away from half - filling , @xmath0 is able to create in relatively similar conditions subtle correlated conducting phases @xcite .",
    "it is also known that insulator to metal transition can be driven as well by disorder @xcite , the process emerging at half filling again from a strongly degenerate insulating phase .",
    "the remaining part of the paper is structured as follows .",
    "section ii . describes the model and its solution in the non - interacting case , section iii . prepares the deduction by transforming the starting hamiltonian in a positive semidefinite form , section iv .",
    "describes the extended operators that allow the construction of the exact ground states , section v. presents the deduced exact ground state , characterizing as well the physical properties of the system , while section vi . containing the summary and",
    "conclusions closes the presentation .",
    "i analyze a generic pam hamiltonian @xmath22 defined on an @xmath23 , 2d bravais lattice with primitive vectors @xmath24 .",
    "the hubbard term is @xmath25 , arbitrary @xmath12 is considered , and @xmath26 where in order to describe real systems , the hopping matrix element @xmath27 covers by the index @xmath28 nearest and next nearest neighbors , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , @xmath31 , give the strengths of the on - site and nearest neighbor hybridizations , and @xmath32 represents the on - site @xmath33-electron energy . during calculations",
    "periodic boundary conditions are used , and the filling is fixed to half ( e.g. @xmath34 , @xmath35 ) .      in order to have a macroscopic degeneracy at one - particle level , one considers first the non - interacting @xmath36 case , and selects the @xmath37 parameters such to obtain a lowest flat band in the non - interacting band structure . for simplicity one",
    "considers the @xmath38 symmetric case @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 . to have a lowest flat band in the non - interacting band structure one takes @xmath42 indeed , for conditions ( [ eq2 ] ) , @xmath37 from ( [ eq1 ] ) transformed in @xmath43 space , can be diagonalized into the form @xmath44 , \\label{eq3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 represents the canonical fermi operator of the @xmath46th diagonalized band ( here @xmath47 ) of @xmath37 . in the case of ( [ eq2 ] ) , the two bands @xmath48",

    "consequently , in the non - interacting case , given by the presence of the lowest bare flat band , a macroscopic degeneracy is present , whose degree at the one particle level is @xmath51 .",

    "the ground state at @xmath11 and half filling ( lowest band completely filled , upper band completely empty ) becomes @xmath56 which represents a paramagnetic band insulator .",
    "the ground state energy corresponding to ( [ eq5 ] ) is @xmath57 $ ] .    denoting by @xmath58 ground state expectation values calculated in terms of ( [ eq5 ] ) , for each site @xmath5 of the system one finds @xmath59 .",
    "concerning @xmath10 from ( [ intr1 ] ) , using ( [ eq5 ] ) , @xmath60 , one finds @xmath61 , where the associated one particle localization length @xmath8 is of order unity in lattice constant units ( for example , for @xmath62 , one obtains @xmath63 for the hamiltonian parameters fixed in fig.8 . ) .",
    "based on this result one concludes that the non - interacting system in the studied conditions represents a localized band insulator .",
    "in order to deduce the exact ground state in the interacting case , one first transforms the hamiltonian @xmath64 , @xmath12 , given in ( [ eq1],[eq2 ] ) in a positive semidefinite form .",
    "i note that this exact transformation is @xmath18 independent , and provides @xmath65 to clarify eq.([eq6 ] ) , the following explications must be given : in the first line of ( [ eq6 ] ) , @xmath66 and @xmath67 are positive semidefinite operators , while @xmath68 represents the ground state energy ( see sec.iv . ) , a number which has a given dependence on the hamiltonian parameters , and whose expression will be clarified below . in order to obtain ( [ eq6 ] ) , first we divide the lattice in two sublattices .",
    "the sublattices are denoted by @xmath69 , and all lattice sites from the sublattice @xmath70 are denoted by @xmath71 .",
    "after this step one introduces the cell operators @xmath72 , which are given by @xmath73 even if labelled by the site @xmath5 , the @xmath72 operators are not local , and collect contributions in the form of a linear combination , from five sites situated around the site @xmath5 .",
    "these five sites denoted by @xmath74 , @xmath75 , build up together the cell defined at the site @xmath5 , where taken for increasing @xmath76 , @xmath77 has the values @xmath78 ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "after this step one presents below separately in details the numerical prefactors , and the operators present in ( [ eq7 ] )      the numerical coefficients @xmath79 in ( [ eq7 ] ) are related to the hamiltonian parameters of @xmath37 , being given by the following system of equations @xmath80 it is important to note that the exact transformation presented in ( [ eq6 ] ) works only if the , , matching conditions  ( [ eq8 ] ) are satisfied .",
    "i also mention that the system of equations ( [ eq8 ] ) , through the expression of @xmath81 , fixes as well the value of the ground state energy @xmath68 in ( [ eq6 ] ) .",
    "one obtains the system of equations ( [ eq8 ] ) by 1 ) calculating @xmath82 based on ( [ eq7],[eq10 ] ) , 2 ) deducing @xmath83 in ( [ eq6 ] ) starting from the previous result , and 3 ) finally equating to @xmath37 from ( [ eq1 ] ) the obtained expression .",
    "i note that the presence of @xmath84 operator only in the middle of the cell operator @xmath72 in ( [ eq6 ] ) ( see also fig.1 ) , leads to the absence of the direct @xmath33-electron hopping in the transformed hamiltonian .",
    "the matching conditions ( [ eq8 ] ) , in the @xmath38 symmetric case specified above eq.([eq2 ] ) , give solution only when ( [ eq2 ] ) is satisfied .",
    "the solution is characterized by @xmath85 , and one obtains @xmath86 where @xmath87 is an arbitrary phase .",
    "the operators @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , are new genuine canonical fermi operators substituting the starting canonical fermi operators @xmath91 , @xmath84 , @xmath92 .",

    "one finds for arbitrary @xmath104 @xmath105 since similar relations can also be written for the @xmath106 case , one concludes that @xmath107 introduces one spin @xmath99 fermion ( @xmath94 , or @xmath106 for @xmath95 or @xmath108 ) on the site @xmath5 .",
    "one further observes that at the level of expectation values , the spin direction and orientation are provided by @xmath104 , and @xmath109 . indeed , for all @xmath110 one has @xmath111 , and @xmath112 , \\label{eq12}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] such that @xmath113 .",
    "these results show that in fact @xmath104 fixes an arbitrary axis along which the spin is placed , while @xmath90 gives the spin direction along the fixed axis .",

    "i further note that the relation @xmath121 holds for all @xmath104 .",
    "it is also important to mention that in eq.([eq6 ] ) , after the transformation of the starting hamiltonian defined by ( [ eq1 ] ) , for @xmath69 , one obtains arbitrary , but fixed @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "in ( [ eq6 ] ) one has the hamiltonian transformed in a positive semidefinite form which now must be analysed in order to deduce its ground state at half filling in the interacting @xmath12 case .",
    "as mentioned above ( [ eq1 ] ) , @xmath124 has been defined on an @xmath125 bravais lattice , and obtaining the transformed form in ( [ eq6 ] ) , the lattice has been divided in two sublattices @xmath69 containing each @xmath126 sites .    in deducing the ground state at @xmath18 particles we have to find a wave vector @xmath127 , where @xmath128 introduces @xmath18 electrons into the system , and based on ( [ eq6 ] ) @xmath129 holds . in such conditions @xmath130 represents the ground state of the @xmath18-electron system described by @xmath124 in ( [ eq6 ] ) , the ground state energy being @xmath68 .",
    "in order to prove ( [ eq13 ] ) , one shows @xmath131 for the first part , and demonstrate that @xmath130 not contains double @xmath33-occupancy for the second .",
    "below i describe the @xmath128 operator which will provide the ground state at @xmath132 ( half filling ) .",
    "since in this concentration region strong correlation effects are present , @xmath128 has a relatively complicated form . because of this fact , in describing @xmath128 first i present it , describe it in details , give its expression , and explain how it was deduced .",
    "taking @xmath133 as the bare vacuum , one considers the state @xmath134 where @xmath135 is the broken line operator defined for the sublattice @xmath70 , labelled by the site @xmath5 of @xmath71 , breaking direction at the site @xmath5 @xmath136 , spin direction given by @xmath97 , and spin orientation specified by @xmath137 .",
    "one arrives to the broken line operator notion by looking for the desired @xmath138 number of linearly independent operators suitable in constructing the ground state at @xmath139 .",
    "if we would like to use an operator of the type @xmath140 ( or its fourier transform in @xmath141 space ) from ( [ eq4],[eq5 ] ) for this job , we shortly realize that only @xmath142 such operators are available in constructing the ground state at @xmath12 , namely those with fixed @xmath6 , since mixing the spin index , automatically double occupancy occurs which raises the energy .",
    "hence , the expression of the interacting ground state requires new operators @xmath143 which must be find .",
    "the search for these leads first to operators constructed along lines in @xmath144 direction .",
    "these resemble to the operators presented in fig.7 , but their number is of order @xmath145 , hence is small . at this point",
    "one remembers that by breaking a straight line , a site ( e.g. the breaking point ) becomes attached to the line , the number of sites being @xmath142 . hence in this manner is possible to reach the number of desired operators .",
    "the presence of the cusp point on the line complicates a little the expression of the operators , but this is in fact the way one reaches the broken line operator notion .    since the structure of the @xmath146 operator is not transparent in ( [ eq14 ] ) ,",
    "i explain it in details below .      connecting the sites of a given sublattice in @xmath144 direction ,",
    "@xmath147 $ ] different straight lines @xmath148 can be drawn , each containing @xmath145 sites , see fig.2 . for simplicity one",
    "considers below even @xmath145 .",
    "now one breaks the straight lines at an arbitrary site @xmath149 . in order to be this possible",
    ", one first defines 4 breaking directions denoted by the index @xmath150 as shown in fig.3 .",
    "if one fixes the breaking direction at @xmath5 by @xmath151 , one finds the , , broken line  as presented in fig.4 .",
    "this is simply obtained by taking the straight line @xmath152 crossing the site @xmath5 , and breaking the line at the site @xmath5 in the breaking direction @xmath151 .",
    "given by the periodic boundary conditions , a broken line besides its first cusp at @xmath5 , and @xmath151 ( obtained by breaking the starting straight line at @xmath5 ) , will have a second cusp point at @xmath153 , and @xmath154 ( see fig.4 ) , which is unambiguously determined by @xmath155 .",
    "hence the obtained broken lines can be denoted by @xmath156 , and their number for fixed @xmath70 becomes @xmath126 .",
    "consequently , the broken line @xmath156 is a continuous line in the sublattice @xmath70 , containing @xmath145 sites from @xmath71 and two cusps as presented in fig.4 , the cusp characterized by the breaking direction @xmath157 being present at the site @xmath5 .",
    "the @xmath135 operator represents a linear combination of operators acting on @xmath158 sites placed in an extended region surrounding the broken line @xmath159 as presented in figs.5 - 7 for @xmath157 . in these figures ,",

    "the obtained result in ( [ eq23 ] ) shows that turning on an arbitrary @xmath12 , the ground state at @xmath139 has the property @xmath230 on each site @xmath5 , where @xmath231 , and @xmath232 denotes ground state expectation value calculated in terms of @xmath225 .",
    "consequently , since @xmath233 at @xmath11 , the hubbard repulsion , by strongly diminishing the f - electron double occupancy , spread out the contributions in the ground state wave function ( e.g. the ground state in exact terms can be now given only in terms of operators which extend along the whole system ) .",
    "the aspects of this fact have been underlined in the point g ) of sec.iv.e , these properties are missing in the non - interacting case , and are introduced by the hubbard @xmath12 . as a consequence , if one fixes two arbitrary sites @xmath234 of the system , there is at least one @xmath235 operator which contains both sites , hence represents a direct path between @xmath236 , and @xmath237 , e.g. gives @xmath238 , where latexmath:[$|\\hat w_{v,{\\bf i } , \\tau , \\lambda_v , e_v}\\rangle = \\hat w^{\\dagger}_{v,{\\bf i } , \\tau,\\lambda_v , e_v }     @xcite .",
    "this property produces a clear increase in the one particle localization length @xmath8 .",
    "i show this aspect by presenting an exemplification for @xmath240 in fig.8 , where @xmath10 from ( [ intr1 ] ) calculated in terms of @xmath225 is shown .",
    "this emphasizes that @xmath10 has no more strong exponential decay as in the @xmath11 non - interacting case , and can increase even 5 order of magnitudes given by the presence of a non - zero @xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath8 value corresponding to @xmath10 for the interacting case in fig.8 ( see inset ) exceeds the sample size , while at @xmath11 had the value @xmath241 . the delocalization effect produced by the hubbard @xmath224",
    "is clearly seen .",
    "the reason for this behavior is that @xmath0 throw the electrons about in order to diminish considerably the double occupancy .",
    "this is why @xmath143 becomes extended along the whole system . in other words , it is not possible to construct at half filling in the presence of @xmath224 @xmath143 operators with the properties presented in sec.iv.e .",
    ", enclosed in a cluster with fixed extension smaller than the sample size . concerning the needed degeneracy ,",
    "i note the following : in order to construct the resulting extended @xmath143 operator from ( [ eq15 ] ) , the system must combine a huge number of linearly independent contributions .",
    "if all these contributions are belong to the same energy ( e.g. the starting point is strongly degenerate ) , the creation of the interacting ground state containing the @xmath143 operators is without cost of energy , hence it is easier to be effectuated .",
    "this is the reason why macroscopic degeneracy is important for the process .",
    "i add at the end an observation regarding the compensation effect in the pam which is also visible from the obtained solution . in the pam ,",
    "the @xmath33-electron moments are compensated in the singlet ground state at @xmath242 .",
    "starting from the paper of nozieres @xcite , the global or local nature of this compensation effect , especially in the large @xmath0 limit , is strongly debated .",
    "the presented results show that for arbitrary large repulsive @xmath0 values the compensation can be manifestly global , being given by a subtle superposition effect of arbitrary spin orientations , involving both @xmath60 electrons .",
    "in the study of the delocalization effect of the hubbard interaction @xmath224 , two aspects have to be analyzed in order to understand the physical reasons of this process : i ) how @xmath0 extends the one particle states , and ii ) how , given by @xmath0 , the gap in the charge excitation spectrum disappears . for the point",
    "ii ) the results deduced for the ionic hubbard model at half filling @xcite suggest that the correlation screening of the one - body potential responsible for the insulating phase can be invoked as an intuitive possibility for explanation .",
    "this aspect however not emphasizes clearly the physical reasons for point i ) , namely , how the hubbard repulsion extends the one - particle behavior in a genuine multielectronic and interacting case .",
    "the presented paper provide physical insights regarding this aspect i ) .",
    "first one shows that always , when the delocalization effect of the hubbard repulsion is observed , @xmath0 acts on the background of a macroscopic degeneracy in a multiband system . after this step",
    "the delocalization effect is analyzed produced on a band insulator starting point taken for the non - interacting case .",
    "for this one considers a prototype two band model at half filling , which at @xmath11 has a completely filled lowest band , separated by a gap from the empty upper band . in order to have the macroscopic degeneracy present ,",
    "the lowest band has been chosen flat .",
    "after this step @xmath0 has been turned on , and its effect analyzed .",
    "the extended nature of the one - particle behavior was tested by the ground state expectation value of the long - range hopping terms .",
    "this analyzis is made in the presented paper based on the periodic anderson model ( pam ) in two dimensions and half filling as a prototype model . in order to provide valuable results ,",
    "the study is presented at exact level .",
    "the pam has been chosen since several aspects are known regarding the construction of its ground states @xcite , but , exact ground states for it in 2d , interacting case , and half filling , are deduced here for the first time .",
    "this is achieved by the use of extended operators , the technique being described in the context of non - integrable models , again for the first time in this paper .",
    "the deduced results show that acting on the background of a macroscopic degeneracy , the hubbard repulsion , by diminishing the double occupancy , spread out the contributions in the ground state wave function . by this ,",
    "is able to increase considerably the one - particle localization length , hence the one - particle behavior becomes extended , which represents a clear physical source of the delocalization effect .",
    "the study of the point ii ) mentioned previously , and related to the gap disappearance needs the deduction of the low laying excitation spectrum in the presented frame .",
    "the description of this case , at the level of the same quality , remains a challenging subject for future investigations .",
    "i am indebted to d. vollhardt , a. p. kampf , a. zawadowski , and m. gulacsi for support and discussions .",
