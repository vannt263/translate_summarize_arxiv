    "extensive mapping observations at various wavelengths have been performed in the orion molecular cloud 2 and 3 ( hereafter omc-2/3 ) in the search for protostars . @xcite detected a chain of 21 cores ( mms1mms10 in omc3 , fir1a ",
    "fir6d in omc-2 ) at 1.3  mm using institut de radio astronomie millimtrique ( iram ) telescope . combining the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) photometry from 350  to 2  mm and the infrared astronomical satellite ( iras ) photometry from 12  to 100 , they showed that the sub - millimeter luminosity ( l@xmath2 ) of most cores dominates the bolometric luminosity ( l@xmath3 ) .",
    "@xcite observed the same region at 3.6  cm using very large array ( vla ) , and reported the detection of eight 1.3  mm cores .",
    "@xcite discovered more than 30 cores ( cso1cso33 ) in omc-2/3 at 350 , and found that all but one of the 1.3  mm cores have counterparts in 350 .",
    "@xcite obtained images of this region in 450  and 850  .",
    "further , @xcite studied this region with h@xmath0  @xmath1",
    "s(1 )  ( hereafter h@xmath0 ) emission line and found that about half of the 1.3  mm cores are associated with h@xmath0jets .",
    "@xcite found that some cores are also accompanied by co and hco@xmath4 molecular outflows .",
    "all these indicate the existence of protostars , most of which are probably at the class 0 stage .",
    "more astonishing is the detection of hard x - ray emission from two ( mms2 and mms3 ) of the millimeter cores using the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory @xcite . due to the spatial coincidence with millimeter cores and their hard x - ray spectra",
    ", @xcite proposed that they are the first candidates of the x - ray emitting class  0 protostars .",
    "previous radio and near infrared ( nir ) observations indicate the existence of class  0 protostars at mms2 and mms3 .",
    "however , their spatial resolution was not high enough to determine which x - ray source coincides with the class  0 protostar , particularly at mms2 where there is a cluster of four x - ray sources .",
    "clearly , follow - up observations with much higher spatial resolution , comparable to that of _ chandra _ ( positional accuracy of @xmath501 ) , are needed .",
    "this paper reports the results of high resolution nir imaging targeting the x - ray sources seen at mms2 and mms3 .",
    "observations were performed using the infrared camera and spectrograph ( ircs ) at the cassegrain focus of the _ subaru _ telescope @xcite .",
    "we took three broad - band ( _ j _ , _ h _ , and _ k_-band ) and two narrow - band ( h@xmath0  and _ k - continuum _ ) images on 2000 november 30 and december 4 .",
    "the seeing was @xmath5 05 on both nights .",
    "j _ , _ k _ , h@xmath0 , and _ k - continuum _  exposure times were 600 seconds each , while the _ h _  exposure time was 300 seconds .",
    "ircs provides a field of view ( fov ) of 60@xmath6 60with a pixel scale of 0058 . with dithering",
    ", we covered a 90@xmath6 90  field encompassing both mms2 and mms3 .    as we had no detection in _",
    "j_-band from two nir sources at mms2 , we obtained an additional _ _ l__@xmath7-band image of mms2 with nsfcam @xcite at the cassegrain focus of the infrared telescope facility ( irtf ) on 2000 december 23 .",
    "the seeing was @xmath5 10 and the integration time was 216 seconds .",
    "nsfcam provides a 38@xmath638  fov with the pixel scale of 0148 . with dithering",
    ", we obtained a 64@xmath6 64  field .",
    "the images were reduced following the standard procedures using ` iraf ` : dark - subtraction , flat - fielding , sky - subtraction , and bad pixel removal for each frame , and correction for dithering to construct a final image .",
    "` sextractor ` @xcite was used for source extraction and photometry .",
    "nine sources ( irs1irs9 ) were extracted from the _ k_-band image .",
    "( table [ tb : t1 ] ) . for each _",
    "k_-band detected source , we performed a 10-aperture photometry of _ j _ , _ h _ , and _ k_-bands .",
    "we transformed their magnitudes into the cit system in the following way .",
    "seven sources are listed in the point source catalog of the 2mass second incremental data release . referring to their _ j",
    "_ , _ h _ , and _ _",
    "k__@xmath8  magnitudes , we derived a linear relation between ircs and 2mass magnitudes in each band .",
    "we first converted the ircs magnitudes into 2mass magnitudes using these relations and then into the cit system using the formule given in @xcite .    for the _",
    "_ l__@xmath7-band image with nsfcam , we performed a 20-aperture photometry of irs3 , irs4 , and irs5 .",
    "we first calculated the magnitudes with the photometric zeropoint of 20.3  mag , and then converted them into the cit _",
    "l_-band color using @xmath9 where we assume _ k_@xmath10_k_@xmath11 as the first order approximation .",
    "the x - ray counterpart was searched for each nir source using the _ chandra _ data given in @xcite . from the visual inspection of the nir and x - ray images , the x - ray sources 6 , 7 , 2 , 12 , and 3 in @xcite ( hereafter we call them tkh  6 , tkh  7 , tkh  2 , tkh  12 , and tkh  3",
    "; the rests follow the same rule . )",
    "were identified to be the counterpart of irs1 , irs4 , irs6 , irs8 , and irs9 , respectively .",
    "two nir sources ( irs3 and irs5 ) and four x - ray sources ( tkh  8 , tkh  8a , tkh  8b , and tkh  8c ) are found at mms2 . in order to find the x - ray counterpart of the nir sources",
    ", we adjusted the x - ray image by shift and rotation so that each x - ray source ( tkh  2 , tkh  3 , tkh  6 , tkh  7 , and tkh  12 ) comes closest to its nir counterpart .",
    "after this procedure , the positional offset between the nir sources and their x - ray counterparts is @xmath5 025 rms ( 1@xmath12 ) .",
    "then , tkh  8c is found to be the closest source to irs5 with separation of 046 , hence is the x - ray counterpart of irs5 . on the other hand , irs3 is separated by 081 from the closest x - ray source ; tkh  8 . assuming that the separation between a nir and x - ray counterpart pair follows a gaussian distribution of @xmath13 025 , the separation between irs3 and tkh  8 is more than 3@xmath12 .",
    "we therefore conclude that tkh  8 is not the x - ray emission from irs3 .",
    "in fact , no separation larger than 081 is found in any other nir and x - ray counterpart pairs .",
    "tkh  10 at mms3 , as well as tkh  8 at mms2 , has no nir counterpart .",
    "we chose several source - free regions near the positions of tkh  8 and tkh  10 for a 10-aperture photometry in order to estimate the 1@xmath12 level of the background .",
    "we find the _",
    "k_-band upper limit of tkh  8 and tkh  10 to be @xmath5 19.6  mag at the 3@xmath12 level .      the vibrational - rotational transition of @xmath14 works as an effective coolant of the excited hydrogen molecules .",
    "therefore this emission line serves as a powerful tool to search for jets from a protostar and the position of its powering source @xcite . in a continuum - subtracted h@xmath0-band image",
    ", we identified a bubble - like feature originating from mms2 .",
    "a close - up view of this bubble - like emission is shown in figure [ fg : f2 ] , where we see the origin of this feature spatially coincides with tkh  8 .",
    "no similar feature was found for tkh  10 at mms3 .",
    "for the classification of young stellar objects ( ysos ) , we use the nir color - color diagram @xcite .",
    "the _ j  h_/_h ",
    "k _  diagram is given in figure [ fg : f3 ]  ( a ) . since irs3 and irs5 have no positive detection in the _ j_-band , we also give _",
    "h  k_/_k  l_diagram in figure [ fg : f3 ]  ( b ) .    in these diagrams , protostars and classical t tauri stars ( ctts )",
    "are positioned right of the reddening vector where reddened photospheres by extinction are inaccessible , because they have redder colors due to an intense circumstellar disk emission .",
    "thus they can be discriminated from weak - line t tauri stars ( wtts ) .",
    "protostars and ctts can be separated from each other based on the amount of extinction .",
    "protostars generally show larger extinction due to their richer circumstellar material than ctts .",
    "irs3 and irs5 are at the very center of a millimeter core ( mms2 ) and are located @xmath5134 ( @xmath5 600  au at the distance of 450  pc ) apart from each other ( figure [ fg : f1 ] ) . together with their large extinction of more than @xmath15 mag and large nir excess seen in figure [ fg : f3 ] ( b ) , they are class i protostars probably comprising a binary system .",
    "irs1 , irs2 and irs4 are at the reddening region of the ctts locus with a moderate extinction of @xmath16 mag ( figure [ fg : f3]a ) .",
    "they are located at the edge of 1.3  mm cores ( figure [ fg : f1 ] ) , thus are most likely to be ctts .",
    "irs6 , irs7 , and irs9 are located away from the cloud cores ( figure [ fg : f1 ] ) and have less extinction ( figure [ fg : f3]a ) . among them ,",
    "irs6 and irs9 are considered to be wtts due to the association with x - ray emission .",
    "irs7 , which has no x - ray counterpart , may be a background source .",
    "it is hard to infer the nature of irs8 from nir observation alone because it has only _",
    "k_-band detection .",
    "however , its x - ray counterpart ( tkh  12 ) shows a thermal emission of @xmath17@xmath183.2  kev , @xmath19@xmath20erg  sec@xmath21 , and @xmath22@xmath186@xmath23@xmath24 @xcite .",
    "according to @xcite who derived a typical x - ray spectrum for protostars ( class  i ) , ctts ( class  ii ) , and wtts ( class  iii ) in omc-2/3 , tkh  12 ( @xmath18irs8 ) is most likely to be a class  i protostar .",
    "class 0 protostars are empirically characterized with the following features @xcite : 1 )  undetectable at wavelengths @xmath2510 , 2 )  a high ratio of l@xmath2/l@xmath3 , 3 )  a relatively narrow spectral energy distribution resembling that of a single blackbody at t@xmath2630  k , 4 )  presence of a molecular outflow , and additionally 5 )  existence of cm - wave continuum emission , and 6 )  presence of herbig - haro ( hh ) objects .",
    "mms2 and mms3 were already found to have a high ratio of l@xmath2/l@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposed that hard x - ray sources at mms2 and mms3 are from class  0 protostars .    with a deep _ k_-band imaging observation",
    ", we found that tkh  8 at mms2 and tkh  10 at mms3 have no nir emission brighter than @xmath5 19.6 mag .",
    "class  i protostars are generally detected at 1014  mag and class  ii t tauri stars are at 812  mag in _",
    "k_-band at the distance of 450  pc ( for example , see fig 24 in aspin , sandell , & russel 1994 ) . class  i and class  ii stars are therefore easily detected in the nir with our sensitivity .",
    "in fact , two class  i protostars at mms2 ( irs3 and irs5 ) show 13.2  mag and 11.4  mag in the _ k_-band .",
    "tkh  8 and tkh  10 are fainter than these stars by more than 100 times .",
    "this suggests that they are much more obscured than class  i protostars , namely at class  0 .",
    "a bubble - like emission in h@xmath0  from tkh  8 reinforces this idea .",
    "@xcite identified the h@xmath0  emission from mms2 in a global scale .",
    "mms2 is also accompanied by hh objects @xcite , molecular outflows @xcite , and 3.6  cm continuum emission @xcite .",
    "our bubble - like feature is at the origin of these jet and outflow phenomena .",
    "therefore , this h@xmath0",
    "emission should be shock - excited by the jet from a protostar .",
    "the close - up view of this feature shows that the bubble has a length of @xmath5 10  ( @xmath27  au ) westward away from its central source .",
    "this morphology is observed in jets from class  0 protostars ( e.g. , l  1448-mm and l  1448 irs  2 ) @xcite . the well - collimated jet is typical of class  0 s , of which the surrounding material is still rich and the outflow can only go through narrow cavities near the pole @xcite .",
    "tkh  8 , the powering source of the jet , is thus most likely to be the class  0 protostar .",
    "1 .   in deep nir imaging of the omc-3 region",
    ", we detected nine _",
    "k_-band sources , and derived their _ j _",
    ", _ h _ , and _",
    "k_-band magnitude .",
    "we also correlated them with the x - ray sources and found that six sources have the x - ray counterpart .",
    "2 .   based on their _ j  h _ , _ h  k _ , and _",
    "l _  colors , spatial coincidence with millimeter cores , and x - ray properties of their x - ray counterpart , we find that three are class  i protostars , three are ctts , two are wtts , and one is a background source .",
    "3 .   with a deep _ k_-band image , tkh  8 and tkh  10 were found to have no _",
    "k_-band emission brighter than 19.6  mag , suggesting that they are highly obscured sources than class  i protostars , namely class  0 protostars . with a h@xmath0  @xmath1",
    "s(1 )  image , a bubble - like feature was found to originate from tkh  8 , reinforcing the class  0 nature of this source .",
