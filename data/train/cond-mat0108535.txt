    "copper has played for a long time a central role in the elucidation of the electronic structure of solids .",
    "it is a relatively inert material , very easy to handle experimentally ; its energy dispersion relations ( including spin - orbit interaction for some bands ) have been measured with considerable precision ; lifetimes of the band states as a function of the distance from fermi level have been determined ; surface states have been analyzed in various parts of surface brillouin zone ( for a review see@xcite ) . from the theoretical side , the study of noble metals like copper using first - principles methods based on plane - waves and ab - initio pseudopotentials ( pps ) presents some peculiar complication with respect to the case of simple metals or semiconductors .",
    "in fact , in addition to metalicity , which implies the use of an accurate sampling of the brillouin zone in order to describe properly the fermi surface , one must also keep into account the contribution of d - electrons to the bonding and to the valence bandstructure .",
    "this means that , within the pp scheme , d states can not be frozen into the core part , but must be explicitly included into the valence , yielding a large total number of valence electrons ( 11 for bulk copper ) .",
    "unfortunately , a cu pseudopotential including 3@xmath0 shell states into the valence part is very steep .",
    "hence , when working with a plane  wave basis , the usage of a pp of this kind may be computationally prohibitive .",
    "on the other hand , the use of a pseudopotential without explicit treatment of 3d - electrons has been shown to be unreliable @xcite .",
    "hence , first - principles methods based on plane - waves have been used only seldom to treat cu @xcite .",
    "however , methods have been devised for the construction of softer pseudopotentials @xcite , which make the inclusion of the 3@xmath0 shell in the valence more affordable .",
    "the price to be paid is that the construction and use of such pseudopotentials , which often display a very strong l - nonlocality , is a quite delicate matter . in particular , the choice of a reference component @xcite and the transferability checks must be done with care .",
    "these difficulties are more than compensated by the simplicity and elegance of the plane - waves formalism in the subsequent calculations . in the present work ,",
    "two possible choices for the cu pseudopotential are explored , i.e : a ) including 3s and 3p electrons into the frozen core ( a quite standard choice ) , and b ) including the full 3@xmath0 shell in the valence",
    ". fully converged density functional theory ",
    "local density approximation ( dft - lda ) calculations are performed at 60 and 140 ry cutoff , respectively for case a ) and b ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : pp ] we give the details of the construction of the pseudopotentials used throughout this work ; in sections [ sec : gs ] and [ sec : lda_bands ] we present the ground state properties and bandstructure , respectively , obtained with the different pseudopotentials ; finally , in section [ sec : e2 ] , we compare the theoretical absorption and electron energy loss spectra with the experimental data , including the effects of local fields and intraband transitions .",
    "the cu atom has the ground ",
    "state electronic configuration [ ar]@xmath1 ( or [ ne]@xmath2 ) .",
    "4s and 3d eigenvalues are separated , in dft ",
    "lda , by less than 0.5 ev .",
    "it is then quite obvious that freezing all states but the 4s one into the atomic core ( i.e. , to neglect the polarization of the 3d electrons ) can not yield a good , transferable pseudopotential . on the other hand , inclusion of the 3d electrons into the valence ( we call this a `` 3d '' pseudopotential ) yields a much slower convergence of plane  wave expansions , due to the steepness of the d - component of the pp .",
    "unfortunately , the spatial superposition between the 3d and 3s or 3p states is quite large , despite the large ( @xmath3 ev ) energy separation .",
    "hence , an even more conservative and secure choice for the pp is to include all 3s , 3p and 3d electrons into the valence : in fact , 2p and 3s states are well separated , both spatially and energetically ( @xmath4 800 ev ) .",
    "this latter choice gives rise to a pp which is even harder than the `` 3d '' one , and which will be referred to as a `` 3s '' pseudopotential , yielding 19 valence electrons per atom .",
    "using the traditional pseudopotential generation scheme proposed by bachelet , hamann and schlter ( bhs ) @xcite yields pp whose d component converges very slowly in fourier space , requiring to work at an energy cutoff of 200 rydbergs or more .",
    "however , pps which converge at less than 100 rydbergs can be constructed by using specially devised schemes as those of refs .",
    "we choose to restrict to the class of _ norm conserving _ pseudopotentials , in order to avoid the additional numerical complications arising from the charge - state dependence of the pp of ref .",
    "moreover , our choices in generating the pp are dictated not only by the need of a fast convergence of the pp in fourier space , but also by that of optimizing the pp accuracy and transferability , a non ",
    "trivial task when also 3s and 3p states are included into the valence . in particular , the hamann scheme @xcite ( which does not try to optimize the fourier space convergence at all ) turned out to yield much more accurate and transferrable norm  conserving pps , particularly when the whole 3@xmath0 shell is included into the valence .",
    "hence , we strictly follow the hamann procedure ( described in the appendix of ref .",
    "@xcite ) whenever it is possible , i.e. in all cases except for the d components . for the latter ,",
    "we follow the troullier ",
    "martins @xcite scheme , which allows us to reduce significantly the number of plane  waves requested for convergence without loosing too much in transferability . in all other cases (",
    "i.e. for the s and p components of both `` 3s '' and `` 3d '' pseudopotentials ) we found the hamann procedure to be more convenient , even at the cost of a slower fourier space convergence , since the tm one yielded significantly worse results , and/or ghost states @xcite when the pp were used in the kleinman ",
    "bylander form @xcite .",
    "another delicate point is the choice of a reference component , i.e. of a pp angular momentum component which is taken to be valid for every l@xmath5 .",
    "often , the l=2 component is chosen as a reference , simply because this makes calculations easier .",
    "this choice is sometimes lacking a physical justification , and can be dangerous , as it has been shown by some of us in the case of sn @xcite . in the present case the l=2 reference had to be avoided anyway , since it yielded a much worse transferability than the l=0 or l=1 choices , and sometimes gave rise to ghost states in the kb form .",
    "several trials and tests with different cutoff radii have been done , in order to optimize the pp transferability without increasing too much the number of plane waves requested for convergence .",
    "transferability tests included both the plot of logarithmic derivatives , and the explicit calculation of pseudoatom eigenvalues in some excited electronic configuration ( both neutral and positively charged ) .",
    "finally , since 3s and 3p states in the solid preserve their atomic configuration better than 3d ones , their explicit inclusion into the valence can sometimes be avoided , by considering only the effects of the non - linearity of the exchange - correlation potential @xcite .",
    "hence , a third pseudopotential , with frozen 3s and 3p electrons but including non - linear core - corrections has also been considered , and will be referred to as the `` 3d+nlcc '' pp . in the latter ,",
    "the core charge is represented by the true one for r@xmath6 bohrs , and by a gaussian model charge for r@xmath7 bohrs .",
    "the resulting optimal cutoff radii and reference l  components , chosen for our `` 3d '' , `` 3s '' , and `` 3d+nlcc '' pseudopotentials , are given in table [ table_rc_pseu ] .",

    "the energy cutoff had to be increased to 100 ry , in order to describe properly the core charge .",
    "nlcc reduce the underestimation of the experimental lattice constant to 0.5 @xmath13 , but they are found to be almost ininfluent on the bandstructure , as well as on the resulting spectra ( see below ) . finally , calculations with the `` 3s '' pseudopotential , much deeper than the `` 3d '' one , required an energy cutoff of 140 ry .",
    "also in this case , the effect on the lda bandstructure and spectra in the energetic region of interest are found to be very small ( see below ) .    in summary ,",
    "as long as only the lda 4s and 3d bandstructure is concerned , the effect of the inclusion of 3s and 3p in the valence , ( as well as the use of nlcc ) , are mainly confined to a change of the equilibrium lattice constant , which induces an indirect effect on the bandstructure energies @xcite .",
    "[ fig : lda_bands.2 ] summarizes the maximum relative energy differences induced by different computational details on the lda bandstructure ; the value is taken at the bottom valence in the @xmath14 point ( @xmath15 ) and decreases gradually to zero at the fermi level .    by changing @xmath16 from 60 ry to 75 ry the band - structure remains practically identical ( changes are less then 0.02 mev ) . at the 60 ry cutoff , we compare the band structure calculated with the ceperley - alder parametrization of the exchange - correlation potential @xcite with that obtained using the hedin - lunqvist parametrization @xcite ; in the latter case we find a maximum energy shift of about 0.15 ev .    the inclusion of nlcc yields , instead , a maximum upward shift of about 0.21 ev with respect to the case without nlcc , mainly due to the change in the equilibrium lattice constant .",
    "to study more deeply the effects of core polarization , we also performed a band - structure calculation with the `` 3s '' pseudopotential ( see section [ sec : pp ] ) , where the 3s and 3p core level relaxation is fully included in the selfconsistent run .",
    "also in this case the maximum bandshift with respect to the `` 3d '' pseudopotential is limited to about 0.2 ev .",
    "hence , our results obtained with the `` 3d '' pseudopotential at @xmath16=60ry . and using 28 mp k  points in the determination of the self  consistent charge density can be considered to represent the converged lda bandstructure of bulk copper .",
