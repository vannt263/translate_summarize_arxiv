    "we present final results from a cdf measurement of single - diffractive ( sd ) dijet production in @xmath5 collisions at @xmath6  1.96  tev at the fermilab tevatron collider using data collected by triggering on a high transverse momentum jet in coincidence with a recoil antiproton detected in a roman pot spectrometer ( rps )  @xcite .",
    "we consider proton diffractive dissociation , @xmath7 , characterized by a rapidity gap ( region of pseudorapidity  , and pseudorapidity , @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the polar angle of a particle with respect to the proton beam ( @xmath10 direction ) , are used interchangeably for particles detected in the calorimeters , since in the kinematic range of interest in this analysis they are approximately equal . ] devoid of particles ) adjacent to an escaping @xmath11 , and a final state @xmath12 representing particles from the dissociation of the proton  @xcite .",
    "the rapidity gap , presumed to be caused by a color - singlet exchange with vacuum quantum numbers between the @xmath11 and the dissociated proton , traditionally referred to as pomeron ( @xmath13 ) exchange , is related to @xmath14 , the forward momentum loss of the surviving @xmath11 , by @xmath15 .",
    "several diffractive dijet results were obtained by cdf in run  i   @xcite . among these ,",
    "most striking is the observation of a breakdown of qcd factorization , expressed as a suppression by a factor of @xmath16 of the diffractive structure function ( dsf ) measured in dijet production relative to that derived from fits to parton densities measured in diffractive deep inelastic scattering ( ddis ) at the desy @xmath17-@xmath18 collider hera ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "the present run  ii diffractive dijet measurement was performed in order to further characterize the diffractive structure function my measuring @xmath19 distributions over a wide range of @xmath20 and jet transverse energy , @xmath21 , namely @xmath22  gev@xmath4 and @xmath23  gev@xmath4 , and to search for diffractive dips .",
    "below , we present the main results of this measurement and compare them with theoretical expectations .",

    "the forward components include a roman pot spectrometer ( rps ) , which measures @xmath14 and @xmath19 with resolutions @xmath24 and @xmath25  gev@xmath4 at @xmath26  gev@xmath4 , where @xmath27 increases with @xmath19 with a @xmath28 dependence .",

    "events were selected online with a three - level prescaled triggering system accepting rps - triggered inclusive and jet - enriched events by requiring at least one calorimeter tower with @xmath30  gev within @xmath31 .",
    "jets were reconstructed using the midpoint algorithm  @xcite .",
    "the majority of the data used in this analysis were recorded without rps tracking information .",
    "for these data , the value of @xmath14 was evaluated from calorimeter information and is designated as @xmath32 .",
    "the @xmath32 was then calibrated against @xmath33 obtained from the rps , @xmath34 , using data from runs in which rps tracking was available .",
    "the following trigger definitions are used for these measurements :    * rps : rps trigger counters in time with a @xmath35 crossing the nominal interaction point ; * j5 ( j20 , j50 ) : jet with @xmath36 ( 20 , 50 ) gev in ccal or pcal ; * rps@xmath37jet5 ( jet20 , jet50 ) : rps trigger in coincidence with j5 ( j20 , j50 ) .",
