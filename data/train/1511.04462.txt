    "the 1 t polymorph of bulk tas@xmath0 , a layered transition - metal dichalcogenide ( tmd ) , has a rich phase diagram that includes multiple charge density wave ( cdw ) phases that differ significantly in their electronic properties . at temperatures above 550",
    "k the material is metallic and undistorted . upon cooling , it adopts a series of cdw phases .",
    "an incommensurate cdw structure ( i ) becomes stable at 550 k , a nearly commensurate phase ( nc ) appears at 350 k , and a fully commensurate cdw ( c ) becomes favored at about 180 k. at each transition , the lattice structure distorts and the electrical resistivity increases abruptly . in the c phase ,",
    "1t - tas@xmath0 is an insulator.@xcite upon heating , an additional triclinic ( t ) nearly commensurate cdw phase occurs roughly between 220 - 280 k.@xcite while the 1t - tas@xmath0 phase diagram is well studied,@xcite the exact causes of the electronic and lattice instabilities remain unclear .",
    "electron - electron interactions , electron - phonon coupling , interlayer interactions , and disorder may all play a role .",
    "it has long been assumed , for example , that electron correlations open up a mott - hubbard gap in the c phase.@xcite recent theoretical work , however , suggests that the insulating nature of the c phase may come from disorder in orbital stacking instead.@xcite    advances in 2d material exfoliation and growth have enabled studies of how dimensionality and interlayer interactions affect the phase diagram of 1t - tas@xmath0 .",
    "some groups have reported that samples thinner than about 10 nm lack the jump in resistivity that signals the transition to the c cdw phase.@xcite however , this may not be an intrinsic material property , as oxidation may suppress the transition . indeed , samples as thin as 4 nm  when environmentally protected by encapsulation between hexagonal bn layers ",
    "retain the nc to c transition.@xcite whether the c phase is the ground state for even thinner samples , and whether this leads to an insulating state , remain open questions .",
    "materials that exhibit abrupt and reversible changes in resistivity are attractive for device applications , particularly when the transition can be controlled electrically .",

    "the s planes buckle outwards , particularly near the center of the clusters , inducing a slight @xmath9-axis swelling of the material.@xcite    the vertical alignment of these star - of - david clusters determines the so - called stacking of the c phase .",

    "the raman spectra of this 2 nm sample at 10 k loses many of the well - defined peaks.@xcite since our raman measurements for the monolayer strongly indicate the c phase at 100 k , it may be that the barrier for the nc - c transition is smaller for the monolayer than for few - layer samples .",

    "<S> we present first - principles calculations of the vibrational properties of the transition metal dichalcogenide 1t - tas@xmath0 for various thicknesses in the high - temperature ( undistorted ) phase and the low - temperature commensurate charge density wave ( cdw ) phase . </S>",
    "<S> we also present measurements of the raman spectra for bulk , few - layer , and monolayer samples at temperatures well below that of the bulk transition to the commensurate phase . through our calculations , we identify the low - frequency folded - back acoustic modes as a convenient signature of the commensurate cdw wave structure in vibrational spectra . in our measured raman spectra , this signature is clearly evident in all of the samples , indicating that the commensurate phase remains the ground state as the material is thinned , even down to a single layer . </S>",
    "<S> this is in contrast to some previous studies which suggest a suppression of the commensurate cdw transition in thin flakes . </S>",
    "<S> we also use polarized raman spectroscopy to probe c - axis orbital texture in the low - t phase , which has recently been suggested as playing a role in the metal - insulator transition that accompanies the structural transition to the commensurate cdw phase . </S>"
