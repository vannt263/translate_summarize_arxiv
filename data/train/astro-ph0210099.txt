    "the data require an accurate description of limb - darkening as demonstrated by hubble space telescope observations of hd 209458 of such high quality that a quadratic limb - darkening law was needed to fit the transit lightcurve rather than the usual linear limb - darkening law @xcite .",

    "all of the curves cross near @xmath83 , which means that accurate observations are required near minimum and egress / ingress to constrain the coefficients of the various basis functions .",
    "if the inclination is large enough that @xmath84 for the entire transit , then it may be difficult to constrain the @xmath85 s .    as @xcite claims that the nonlinear limb - darkening law is the most accurate , we have compared the transit with @xmath79 for the nonlinear and quadratic laws .",

    "contribution of flux from the planetary companion or other companions may be added to the lightcurve , reducing the transit depth .    to illustrate the utility of our formulae , we have fit the nonlinear limb - darkened lightcurve to the hst - stis data of hd 209458 @xcite .",

    "the errors on the other parameters are marginalized over the @xmath85 s . limiting the limb - darkening to quadratic , we find @xmath103 and @xmath104 , consistent with the values derived by @xcite and with stellar atmosphere predictions .",

    "this technique may be used for finding initial parameters for lightcurve fitting .",
    "we have derived analytic expressions for an eclipse including quadratic limb - darkening and nonlinear limb - darkening .",
    "the nonlinear law ( section 3 ) provides an accurate fit to realistic stellar limb - darkening , while the quadratic fit ( section 4 ) provides a fast means of obtaining a relatively accurate lightcurve . for an extremely fast and fairly accurate approximation for any limb - darkening law",
    ", the equations in section 5 may be used to derive lightcurves .",
    "if the limb - darkening law is known from the spectral type of the star , then one can use the formulae in section 5 to analytically estimate both the minimum impact parameter ( in units of stellar radius ) and the ratio of the planetary radius to the stellar radius .",
    "we have written a code which takes the properties of a host star , finds the limb - darkening coefficients in the tables of @xcite , and computes lightcurves for the parameters of a given planetary transit .",
    "this code will be useful for simulating planetary transit searches @xcite , searching for planetary transit signals in lightcurves collected by a given search , and for fitting and measuring the errors of the parameters of detected planetary transit events .",
