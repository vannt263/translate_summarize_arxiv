    "one of the most interesting topic of quantum physics in recent days is the characterization of universal properties of bosonic many - body system in the unitary regime  @xcite . by using the feshbach resonance the two - body scattering length @xmath1",
    "is tuned to very large values .",
    "the unitary regime is characterized by simple universal laws . for",
    "weakly interacting dilute bose gas , the gas like state becomes unstable as @xmath1 increases  @xcite .",
    "however the efimov effect in quantum three - body systems leads to different concept of universality .",
    "efimov effect appears in the three - body level ( @xmath0=3 ) where the attractive two - body interaction is such that the scattering length is much larger than the range of the interaction . under such condition",
    ", a series of weakly bound and spatially extended states of efimov character appears in the system .",
    "although the efimov character and ultracold behaviour of fermi gas is well understood , the exhaustive study of bosonic system with large scattering length are few .",
    "helium trimer @xmath2 is a well studied quantum three - body system in this direction  @xcite , its first excited state is theoretically claimed as of efimov state , however no experimental observation is still reported . whereas the recent experimental observations of efimov phenomena in ultracold gases has drawn interest in the study of universality in few - body quantum systems  @xcite but the extension of efimov physics for larger system ( @xmath3 ) is not straightforward .",
    "there are several studies in this direction which predicted the universality of the system  @xcite . though predictions and conclusions made in these works are qualitatively similar quantitative differences exist .",
    "this necessitates further study of universal properties of bosonic cluster state having efimov character .",
    "+ in this work we consider few - bosonic clusters of @xmath4rb atoms interacting with van der waals interaction .",
    "our motivation also comes from recent experiments of weakly bound molecules created from ultracold bose gas . utilizing the feshbach resonance the effective interatomic interaction",
    "can be essentially tuned to any desired value . for weakly interacting dilute systems",
    ", the efimov state appears at unitary ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "our motivation is to study the near threshold behaviour of weakly bound three - dimensional clusters . to characterize this delicate system",
    "we prescribe two - body correlated basis function for the many - body cluster interacting through shape - dependent two - body van der waals potential .",
    "we expect that our present study will explore the generic behaviour of three - dimensional bosonic cluster near the unitary",
    ". the usage of realistic potential with a short range repulsive core and long - range attractive tail @xmath6 may give qualitative conclusion as before but different quantitative behaviours are expected .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we discuss the many - body hamiltonian and numerical calculation .",
    "iii considers the results and exhibit the signature of universal cluster states with efimov character .",
    "iv concludes with a summary .",
    "we approximately solve the many - body schrdinger equation by potential harmonic expansion method ( phem ) .",
    "we have successfully applied phem to study different properties of bose einstein condensate  @xcite and atomic clusters  @xcite .",
    "the method has been described in detail in our earlier works  @xcite .",
    "we briefly describe the method below for interested readers .",
    "we consider a system of @xmath7 @xmath4rb atoms , each of mass @xmath8 and interacting via two - body potential .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system is given by @xmath9 here @xmath10 is the two - body potential and @xmath11 is the position vector of the @xmath12th particle .",
    "it is usual practice to decompose the motion of a many - body system into the motion of the center of mass where the center of mass coordinate is @xmath13 and the relative motion of the particles in center of mass frame . for atomic clusters ,",
    "the center of mass behaves like a free particle in laboratory frame and we set its energy zero .",
    "hence , we can eliminate the center of mass motion by using standard jacobi coordinates , defined as  @xcite @xmath14 and obtain the hamiltonian for the relative motion of the atoms @xmath15 here @xmath16 is the sum of all pair - wise interactions expressed in terms of jacobi coordinates . the hyperspherical harmonic expansion method ( hhem )",
    "is an _ ab - initio _ complete many - body approach and includes all possible correlations .",
    "the hyperspherical variables are constituted by the hyperradius @xmath17 and @xmath18 hyperangular variables which are comprised of @xmath19 spherical polar angles @xmath20 associated with @xmath21 jacobi vectors and @xmath22 hyperangles @xmath23 given by their lengths .",
    "however the calculation of potential matrix elements of all pairwise potentials becomes a formidable task and the convergence rate of the hyperspherical harmonic expansion becomes extremely slow for @xmath24 , due to rapidly increasing degeneracy of the basis .",
    "thus hhem is not suitable for the description of large diffuse atomic clusters .",
    "but for a diffuse cluster like rb - cluster , only two - body correlation and pairwise interaction are important",
    ". therefore we can decompose the total wave function @xmath25 into two - body faddeev component for the interacting @xmath26 pair as @xmath27 it is important to note that @xmath28 is a function of two - body separation ( @xmath29 ) and the global @xmath30 only .",
    "therefore for each of the @xmath31 interacting pair of a @xmath0 particle system , the active degrees of freedom is effectively reduced to only four , _ viz .",
    "_ , @xmath29 and @xmath30 and the remaining irrelevant degrees of freedom are frozen .",
    "since @xmath25 is decomposed into all possible interacting pair faddeev components , _ all two - body correlations _ are included .",
    "thus the physical picture for a given faddeev component is that when two particles interact , the rest of the particles behave as inert spectators.thus the effect of two - body correlation comes through the two - body interaction in the expansion basis .",
    "it is to be noted that @xmath28 is symmetric under the exchange operator @xmath32 for bosonic atoms and satisfy the faddeev equation @xmath33\\phi_{ij } = -v(\\vec{r}_{ij})\\sum_{kl > k}^{n}\\phi_{kl } \\label{eq.faddeev - eqn}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 is the total kinetic energy operator . applying the operator @xmath35 on both sides of eq .",
    "( [ eq.faddeev-eqn ] ) , we get back the original schrdinger equation .",
    "since we assume that when ( @xmath36 ) pair interacts the rest of the bosons are inert spectators , the total hyperangular momentum and the orbital angular momentum of the whole system is contributed by the interacting pair only .",
    "next the @xmath26th faddeev component is expanded in the set of potential harmonics ( ph ) ( which is a subset of hyperspherical harmonic ( hh ) basis and sufficient for the expansion of @xmath37 ) appropriate for the ( @xmath36 ) partition as @xmath38 @xmath39 denotes the full set of hyperangles in the @xmath40-dimensional space corresponding to the @xmath26 interacting pair and @xmath41 is called the ph .",
    "it has an analytic expression : @xmath42 @xmath43 is the hh of order zero in the @xmath44 dimensional space spanned by @xmath45 jacobi vectors ; @xmath46 is the hyperangle between the @xmath47-th jacobi vector @xmath48 and the hyperradius @xmath30 and is given by @xmath49 = @xmath50 . for the remaining @xmath22 noninteracting bosons",
    "we define hyperradius as @xmath51 such that @xmath52 .",
    "the set of @xmath18 quantum numbers of hh is now reduced to _ only _ @xmath53 as for the @xmath22 non - interacting pair @xmath54 and for the interacting pair @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57",
    ". thus the @xmath40 dimensional schrdinger equation reduces effectively to a four dimensional equation with the relevant set of quantum numbers : energy @xmath58 , orbital angular momentum quantum number @xmath59 , azimuthal quantum number @xmath8 and grand orbital quantum number @xmath60 for any @xmath0 . substituting eq .",

    "the potential matrix element @xmath68 is given by @xmath69    we do not require the additional short - range correlation function @xmath70 as mentioned in ref .",
    "it is already pointed out that the universal properties of ultracold dilute atomic gas in the unitary regime is characterized when the two - body scattering length @xmath1 is tuned to very large values by using the feshbach resonance .",
    "although the unitary fermi gas has been largely investigated both experimentally and theoretically  @xcite , the bosonic unitary regime is a formidable challenge in the many - body theories . even though the range of the interaction is small compared with the particle separation , interatomic correlations are very important and the standard mean - field theories are inadequate .",
    "+ the interaction strength of sufficiently dilute atomic cloud is parameterized by a single parameter - the @xmath71-wave scattering length .",
    "however for our present study to explore the generic behaviour near the unitary , we consider the van der waals potential characterized by two parameters : the cutoff radius of the repulsive hard core @xmath72 and the strength of the long - range tail @xmath73 . thus keeping @xmath73 fixed",
    ", it is possible to tune the value of @xmath72 . solving the two - body schrdinger equation it is possible to calculate the scattering length for each choice of @xmath72 .",
    "we solve the zero - energy two - body schrdinger equation for the two - body wave function @xmath70 as @xmath74 where @xmath75 for @xmath76 and @xmath77 for @xmath78 .",
    "the asymptotic form of @xmath70 is @xmath79 , @xmath80 is the normalization constant .",
    "the solution of two - body equation shows that the value of @xmath1 changes from negative to positive passing through an infinite discontinuity . in fig .",
    "[ fig.as ] , we plot the zero - energy scattering length @xmath1 as a function of @xmath72 . at each discontinuity , one extra node in the two - body wave function appears which corresponds to one extra two - body bound state .",
    "however for our present study we fix @xmath72 such that it corresponds to zero node in the two - body wave function .",
    "we impose the constraint just to avoid the formation of the molecules , otherwise when @xmath1 sufficiently increases , the rate of three - body collisions will increase which deplete the density by forming molecules .",
    "+    with the above set of parameters we solve the set of coupled differential equations ( cdes ) by hyperspherical adiabatic approximation ( haa )  @xcite . in haa",
    ", we assume the hyperradial motion is slow compared to the hyperangular motion .",
    "thus the solution of the hyperangular motion is obtained by diagonalizing the potential matrix including the diagonal hypercentrifugal repulsion for a fixed value of @xmath30 .",
    "the cde is then decoupled approximately into a single uncoupled differential equation @xmath81\\zeta_{0}(r)=0\\hspace*{.1 cm } , \\label{eq.eaa}\\ ] ] which is known as extreme adiabatic approximation ( eaa ) and the lowest eigenvalue @xmath82 is the effective potential in which the hyperradial motion takes place .",
    "the above equation is solved to obtain the energy and wave function with appropriate boundary conditions on @xmath83 . +    in fig .",
    "[ fig.gndstate ] , we plot the calculated bosonic cluster ground state energies in the negative scattering length near the unitary for different cluster sizes with @xmath0 = 3,4,5,6,7 as a function of the scattering length @xmath1 which represents the universal properties of the bosonic cluster energy at large @xmath84 . it is to be noted that the effective interaction of the bosonic cluster is determined by @xmath85 . with increase in particle number ,",
    "the number of interacting pair @xmath86 also increases and the energy becomes more negative as expected .      for two particles the infinite scattering length corresponds to a bound state at zero energy . for three particles the efimov effect appears at @xmath87 or @xmath88 = 0 , infinitely many three - body bound states with smaller binding energy and larger radii will appear . moving in the opposite by decreasing the attraction ,",
    "these states cease to be bound one by one .",
    "we have calculated the spectrum of bosonic clusters and in fig .",
    "[ fig.excited ] we plot @xmath89 as a function of the state number @xmath90 of the negative energy states .",
    "the radii of efimov states @xmath91 as a function of state number @xmath90 is shown in fig .  [ fig.rav ] .",
    "[ fig.excited ] , we observe that for each of the @xmath0-body systems there is a series of bound states with exceedingly small energies .",
    "it is seen that these series of states show exponential dependence upon the state number as @xmath89 @xmath92 @xmath93 .",
    "the exponential fits give the numbers as @xmath94 = 0.448 , @xmath95 = 0.278 , @xmath96 = 0.198 , @xmath97 = 0.149 .",
    "whereas in fig .",
    "[ fig.rav ] , we observe that the spatial extension of efimov states is much larger than the interaction range and the r. m. s. radii of efimov states are well reproduced with the exponential @xmath98 @xmath92 @xmath99 where the fitted parameters are @xmath100 = 0.18 , @xmath101 = 0.12 , @xmath73 = 0.09 and @xmath102 = 0.068 .",

    "@xcite for trapped bosons .",
    "finally we analyse the structural properties of the cluster states by calculating the pair - correlation function @xmath104 which determines the probability of finding the @xmath26 pair of particles at a relative separation @xmath105 .",
    "[ fig.correlation ] presents the pair correlation function for @xmath106 at unitarity .",
    "@xmath104 is considered as a more effective quantity in the description of structural properties as the interatomic interaction plays a crucial role .",
    "when atoms try to form clusters , due to the attractive part of van der waals interaction , the short range hard core repulsion has the effect of repulsion , thus @xmath104 is zero for @xmath105 smaller than the hard core radius @xmath72 .",
    "we calculate @xmath104 by @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the many - body wave function and the integral over the hypervolume excludes the integration over @xmath105 .",
    "the position of the maximum is shifted to larger @xmath105 with increase in @xmath0 and peak height reduces .",
