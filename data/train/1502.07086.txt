    "one of the most intriguing problems of statistical mechanics is provided by the fact that hamiltonian reversible dynamics is not able to predict any increase of the fine - grained entropy , as it would be required by the second law of thermodynamics @xcite .",

    "( [ eq : svnh ] ) is somewhat more problematic in nonequilibrium dynamics .",
    "in fact , in order to agree with the entropy increase required by the second law of thermodynamics , one must resort to modified definitions of entropy , such as those implied by coarse - graining ( see ref .",
    "@xcite , for example ) or by the adoption of relevant definitions of entropy @xcite .",
    "this has even led some authors  @xcite to invoke more general structures  @xcite than hamiltonian ones in order to define the microscopic dynamics of statistical systems .    when a quantum system is coupled to sink or sources , nh dynamics can be used . in such a case",

    "another important property of the entropy @xmath35 is that , unlike the von neumann entropy ( [ eq : svnnh ] ) , it is not invariant under the complex constant shifts of the hamiltonian that preserve the form of the evolution equation for the normalized density operator ( [ eq : dotrho ] ) .",
    "these constant shifts of the hamiltonian can be regarded as a kind of `` gauge '' transformation , see appendix . indeed , if one adds to the @xmath2 operator a constant term that is proportional to the unity operator @xmath38 , then both the normalized density operator ( [ eq : rho ] ) and the von neumann entropy ( [ eq : svnnh ] ) are unchanged ; however , the nh entropy acquires a shift in terms of a linear function of time : + i    \\ { s _ s _ , + s _ s _",

    "<S> we study the quantum entropy of systems that are described by general non - hermitian hamiltonians , including those which can model the effects of sinks or sources . </S>",
    "<S> we generalize the von neumann entropy to the non- hermitian case and find that one needs both the normalized and non - normalized density operators in order to properly describe irreversible processes . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that such a generalization monitors the onset of disorder in quantum dissipative systems . </S>",
    "<S> we give arguments for why one can consider the generalized entropy as the informational entropy describing the flow of information between the system and the bath . </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate the theory by explicitly studying few simple models , including tunneling systems with two energy levels and non - hermitian detuning . </S>"
