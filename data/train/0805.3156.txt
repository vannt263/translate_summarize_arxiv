    "this is the fourth installment in a series of papers investigating the white dwarf ( wd ) content in young open clusters .",
    "the primary goal of these studies is to better constrain the integrated mass lost by low to intermediate mass stars during their main sequence and advanced stages of evolution .",
    "this mass loss is most commonly represented as an initial - final mass relation ( ifmr , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "constraining the ifmr is crucial to understanding the chemical enrichment due to stellar mass loss and star formation efficiency in galaxies @xcite .",
    "the shape of the ifmr has a direct effect on the shape of the wd luminosity function ( wdlf ) , which is commonly used to constrain the age of the galactic thin disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the thick disk , the galactic halo ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and globular clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "much work has been done to constrain the ifmr semi - empirically .",
    "the first purely photographic study was done by @xcite ; spectroscopy of wds , which is necessary to determine their masses and cooling times , was added to studies of the ifmr in a series of papers by ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "motivated by this progress , @xcite updated his semi - empirical ifmr . more recent work on open clusters by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite led @xcite to re - determine the empirical ifmr .",
    "they found that a linear function adequately described the observational data .",
    "more recent purely empirical ifmr determinations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) also find the empirical ifmr can be adequately parameterized as a linear function ; the slopes derived in these studies are consistent with the slope found by @xcite .",
    "another aim of these studies is to more accurately determine the upper limit on the main sequence mass of a star that evolves into a wd .",
    "this limit is an important parameter in modeling dwarf galaxy evolution in particular @xcite , as it constrains the amount of energy and matter produced during the evolution of a given stellar population .",
    "recent theoretical studies @xcite of the advanced stages of stellar evolution find that the lower limit on the mass of a solar metallicity star that will ignite carbon burning is @xmath6 .",
    "only stars with masses below this limit should be able to form co - core wds . between @xmath6 and @xmath7 ,",
    "stars modeled in @xcite ignite carbon but do not ignite neon and oxygen , so that some of them may form one - core wds .",
    "these limits have yet to be tested observationally .",
    "wd studies to date have investigated wds with initial masses between @xmath8 and @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "it is important to explore the wd populations of _ young open clusters with possible massive , still relatively bright wds for this reason . _",
    "a third use of these studies of wds in young open clusters is to compare cluster ages as determined by main - sequence fitting with wd cooling times @xcite .",
    "consistency of these ages increases confidence in both stellar evolutionary models and wd cooling models .",
    "consistency across a wide range of star cluster ages further increases confidence in studies seeking to derive star - formation history from the wdlf ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "our general approach is to use photometric observations of young clusters in order to select likely wd cluster member candidates based on their location in the color - magnitude and color - color ( @xmath10@xmath11 versus @xmath11@xmath12 ) diagrams for the fields .",
    "we then obtain high signal - to - noise spectra of these candidates .",
    "with spectroscopy of cluster wd candidates , it is possible to unambiguously determine if the objects are wds .",
    "for the _ bona fide _ wds , we determine the effective temperature ( @xmath13 ) and surface gravity ( @xmath14 ) , and from those quantities and wd evolutionary models , we derive the cooling age ( @xmath15 ) , mass , and luminosity of each wd .",
    "for those wds with cooling ages less than the cluster age and distance moduli consistent with cluster membership , subtraction of the wd cooling age from the age of the open cluster results in the lifetime of the progenitor star , and stellar evolutionary models can then be used to determine the progenitor star mass .    as part of our ongoing program to identify and spectroscopically",

    "intermediate - sized filled circles represent lower mass da wds selected to be cluster members ( lawds 9 and 20 ) .",
    "we select wds for cluster membership based only on their distance and cooling time , yet it is quite possible for field wds to satisfy these criteria as well .",

    "although these potential ngc 1039 wds are significantly higher mass , a similar mechanism could still operate .",
    "however , as the colors of these two wds are not abnormal for single wds , the companion responsible for the binary evolution either must be a very faint compact object , a very low mass star or brown dwarf , or the companion must have been lost .",
    "2 .   @xcite have shown via spectroscopic measurements that many wds in the old , super metal rich open cluster are low - mass helium - core wds , and have posited that the high metallicity of the star cluster may have led to enhanced mass loss during the post - main - sequence evolutionary phases of these stars .",
    "a similar mechanism could be responsible for the apparently low masses of lawds 9 and lawds 20 .",
    "+ however , the metallicity of ngc 1039 is consistent with solar ( or slightly super - solar ) metallicity .",
    "furthermore , its metallicity is significantly lower than that of the hyades and praesepe clusters , and no abnormally low mass wds are seen in hyades or praesepe .",
    "enhanced mass loss therefore does not seem a likely explanation for the low mass of these two wds .    given these points",

    "measured equivalent widths ( ews ) of the k absorption lines for all wds are given in table [ tab.cak ] .",
    "@xcite find that @xmath113 of da wds show intrinsic absorption ; our rate of incidence is significantly higher than this .",
    "in addition , our ews are significantly larger than those observed in the majority of the @xcite sample ; the higher average temperature of our wd sample would imply enormous abundances for a large fraction of wds , which seems implausible .",
    "there is a distinct possibility that the detected is interstellar in origin ; our spectral resolution is too low to resolve individual clouds in the interstellar medium ( ism ) or to measure any velocity differences between the balmer lines and the k line . while there appears to be no significant correlation between the k ew and the derived wd distance modulus , the measured ews fall within the scatter of the interstellar absorption measured in the spectra of hot stars by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see figure  [ fig.megier ] ) .",
    "however , the candidate dazs do not seem to show any projected spatial correlations , and there is no correlation between the position of these wds and wds that do not exhibit k absorption in the field with areas of enhanced diffuse h@xmath114 emission from the maps of @xcite .    in short , we can not determine conclusively whether the observed k absorption in the eight potential daz wd spectra is intrinsic to the wds , or due perhaps to patchy interstellar clouds , though the interstellar origin seems most likely .",
    "higher - resolution spectroscopy is necessary to further investigate the potential metal content of these wds .",
    "the number of expected cluster wds may be calculated by assuming an initial mass function ( imf ) for the cluster and an upper limit on the mass of stars which form wds ; such calculations are detailed in @xcite .",
    "we calculate the expected wd population of ngc 1039 using this method . @xcite",

    "they find 71 cluster members with @xmath116 , the completeness limit of their study .",
    "we assume a salpeter imf and an upper mass limit on wd progenitors of @xmath117 , and find that we expect the cluster to contain 11.6 wds in this central region . assuming a binary fraction of 0.5 and a random distribution of binary mass ratios",
    ", 5.5 wds should be detectable in the @xmath115 parsec field imaged by @xcite ; the rest will be hidden in binary stars .",
    "@xcite assume a projected surface density profile for the cluster of the form @xmath118 , where @xmath119 is in units of stars per square arcminute .",
    "they calculate @xmath120 , the scale length for the projected surface density of cluster members , for several different @xmath12 magnitude ranges .",
    "we normalize this projected surface density profile using the number of wds expected in the area imaged by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* calculated above ) and integrate it over the area of our mosaic imaging .",
    "we choose the largest value of @xmath121 in order to avoid underestimating the expected number of wds in the cluster .",
    "the result of this integration , 7.7 wds , is the expected number of cluster member wds in the field imaged in this study .",
    "if all six wds observed at the cluster @xmath122 are cluster members , this result is consistent with our findings . if only the three massive wds are cluster members , then ngc 1039 may be deficient in wds ; this deficiency has been observed in other poor open clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we also integrate the projected surface density profile to a radius of infinity and find that the absolute maximum number of wds expected is 9.9 . for smaller values of @xmath120 , the expected number of wds decreases .      as noted previously , there is considerable variation in values of the distance modulus of ngc 1039 reported in the literature .",
    "an alternative method of estimating cluster distances involves measuring the distances of wds assumed to be cluster members .",
    "the results of this method are independent of any assumptions we have made about the distance of the cluster , other than the membership distance criterion ( which involved a broad selection ) .",
    "we first limit the analysis to the three massive ( @xmath123 ) cluster members ; the weighted average of @xmath58 of these objects is @xmath124 .",
    "this value matches the @xcite determination of @xmath125 within the error bars . if we include in the calculation the lower mass potential cluster members , we obtain a weighted average of @xmath126 , also in agreement with the @xcite value .",
    "@xcite use near - ir photometry from 2mass in addition to optical photometry in order to determine a distance modulus , as opposed to @xcite , whose study is confined to @xmath127 optical photometry .",
    "@xcite note that when the optical photometry alone is fitted by modern isochrones ( as in @xcite , who use @xcite and @xcite isochrones ) , a distance modulus consistent with their measurement is obtained .",
    "@xcite also point out that they use a slightly different value of @xmath128 than in earlier studies , which could cause them to obtain a larger value of @xmath129 .",
    "we may also use our wd model calculations to measure the extinction toward this cluster .",
    "the wd cooling models we have used provide us with expected colors for cluster wds .",
    "these are compared with observed colors in table [ tab.reddening ] .",
    "using only the three high - mass cluster member wds , the weighted average @xmath130 and @xmath131 for the cluster .",
    "if we include the lower mass potential cluster members , we obtain @xmath132 and @xmath133 . both values for @xmath61 are consistent with the value used by @xcite ( @xmath134 ) .",
    "the values we obtain for @xmath135 are lower than @xmath136 we would expect based on the @xmath59  value and our assumed reddening curve ; however , given the uncertainty in our @xmath10-band calibrations ( see table [ tab.coef ] ) , we believe that this difference is not significant",
    ".      having identified likely cluster member wds , we now place them on the initial - final mass relation ( ifmr , figure [ fig.ifmr ] ) .",
    "the gray points show data from the literature , with initial and final masses re - determined from published @xmath13  and @xmath14  using our adopted evolutionary models and methodology .",
    "references to the published data and the crucial assumptions are given in @xcite .",
    "the high - mass wds selected for cluster membership ( lawds 15 , 17 and s2 ) , represented by large black filled circles , fall directly on the trend found by @xcite and represented by the dashed line .",
    "lawds 9 and 20 ( intermediate - sized filled circles ) fall well below the established ifmr , as does lawds s1 ( the candidate double degenerate ) .",
    "if cluster members , their relatively low masses compared to other wds with similar progenitor masses would indicate that some mechanism , such as close binary evolution or enhanced mass loss , is necessary to explain their location in the ifmr ( see  [ discussion.contamination ] ) .",
    "the three massive cluster member wds fall almost exactly on the linear ifmr from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* dashed line ) . for illustration",
    ", we also include the semi - empirical ifmr of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* solid curve ) and the theoretical , @xmath137 ifmr of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* dotted curve ) .",
    "these relations bracket the empirical data .",
    "these points also begin to fill a region of the diagram ( @xmath138 ) previously relatively unpopulated .",
    "the uncertainty in the age of the open cluster is a source of systematic error we now consider . as the lifetime of the progenitor star is the cluster age minus the wd cooling age , an increase ( decrease ) in the assumed cluster age results in an increase ( decrease ) in the progenitor star lifetime , which corresponds to a decrease ( increase ) in the progenitor star mass for each wd .",
    "in other words , an older assumed cluster age leads to systematically lower progenitor mass for _ every _ cluster wd , and vice versa .",
    "for this reason , we do not simply fold the cluster age uncertainty into the individual wd error bars , where it is likely to be misinterpreted as a random error for an individual star .    the change in the derived ifmr due to the uncertainty in the age of ngc 1039",
    "is shown in figure [ fig.ifmr ] as small points to the left and right of each cluster wd , which represent the ifmr for assumed ages of 250 myr and 200 myr , respectively .",
    "for this cluster , the uncertainty in the star cluster age does not qualitatively affect the conclusion that the ngc 1039 ifmr agrees with the existing empirical ifmr .",
    "figure [ fig.lawds_ifmr ] shows the empirical ifmr for only those objects included in the lawds studies .",
    "there is considerably less scatter around the ifmr when only these points are plotted .",
    "this could be indicative of the heterogeneity of the current open cluster wd sample , which is derived from several studies using a variety of instruments and atmospheric models .",
    "this suggests that further study into the inter - comparison of different samples is warranted .",
    "we present photometric and spectroscopic data on the wds in the field of the young open cluster ngc 1039 .",
    "we use @xmath2 imaging to photometrically select 44 objects as wd candidates . of these 44",
    ", we spectroscopically identify 32 objects .",
    "twelve are agns , one is an a - type star , 17 are da or daz wds , one is a db wd ( lawds 26 ) , and one is a dc wd ( lawds 7 ) .",
    "five das are selected as possible cluster members three high mass ( @xmath139 ) wds , and two low mass wds .",
    "the membership of the db wd remains in question and requires further analysis .",
    "the distance modulus of an additional da is @xmath140 mag brighter than the distance modulus of the cluster , making it a potential ( but not highly compelling ) double - degenerate binary cluster member .",
    "the three high - mass cluster members lie directly on the established ifmr of @xcite , while two lower - mass candidate members lie well below the relation . this could be due to binary evolution or metallicity - enhanced mass loss , though the evidence for either is weak . as the mass of these two latter wds is similar to the mass at the peak of the field wd mass distribution , and",
    "as we expect to find @xmath94 field wds meeting our membership criteria , these lower - mass wds may not be true cluster members .",
    "proper motion measurements will be necessary to confirm the membership of all five selected cluster member wds .    based on the photometry of the five cluster member wds , we obtain a cluster wd distance modulus of @xmath141 and a cluster wd color excess of @xmath142 .",
    "these values are consistent with recent measurements by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath143 with @xmath144 ) .",
    "we note that the massive wds at the distance modulus of the cluster all have cooling ages shorter than the age of the cluster .",
    "this indicates that results from main - sequence fitting do not seriously underestimate the cluster age .",
    "eight out of 17 da wds have detectable k absorption .",
    "the fraction of das showing absorption ( 47% ) is significantly higher than the fraction that has been found in other studies ( @xmath113 ) .",
    "evidence suggests that the absorption is interstellar in origin , although this can not be confirmed with present data .",
    "we use distance modulus and wd cooling time to select probable wd cluster members , and while these criteria can provide us with a list of strong cluster member wd candidates , a study of proper motions of the cluster and these objects would significantly enhance our certainty of their membership status .",

    "<S> we present the first detailed photometric and spectroscopic study of the white dwarfs ( wds ) in the field of the @xmath0 myr old ( @xmath1 ) open cluster ngc 1039 ( m34 ) as part of the ongoing lick - arizona white dwarf survey . using wide - field @xmath2 imaging , we photometrically select 44 wd candidates in this field . </S>",
    "<S> we spectroscopically identify 19 of these objects as wds ; 17 are hydrogen - atmosphere da wds , one is a helium - atmosphere db wd , and one is a cool dc wd that exhibits no detectable absorption lines . </S>",
    "<S> we find an effective temperature ( @xmath3 ) and surface gravity ( @xmath4 ) for each da wd by fitting balmer - line profiles from model atmospheres to the observed spectra . </S>",
    "<S> wd evolutionary models are then invoked to derive masses and cooling times for each da wd . </S>",
    "<S> of the 17 das , five are at the approximate distance modulus of the cluster . </S>",
    "<S> another wd with a distance modulus @xmath5 mag brighter than that of the cluster could be a double - degenerate binary cluster member , but is more likely to be a field wd . </S>",
    "<S> we place the five single cluster member wds in the empirical initial - final mass relation and find that three of them lie very close to the previously derived linear relation ; two have wd masses significantly below the relation . these outliers may have experienced some sort of enhanced mass loss or binary evolution ; however , it is quite possible that these wds are simply interlopers from the field wd population . </S>",
    "<S> eight of the 17 da wds show significant k absorption ; comparison of the absorption strength with the wd distances suggests that the absorption is interstellar , though this can not be confirmed with the current data . </S>"
