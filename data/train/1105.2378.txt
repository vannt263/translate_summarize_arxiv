    "understanding the ergodic behavior of both deterministic and random dynamical systems is of paramount importance in applications .",
    "this is because many natural phenomena are either in steady state or close to it ; thus the long - time dynamics often reflects most accurately the situation at hand . proving or disproving ergodicity in general , however , remains a challenge . in this work",
    "we discuss useful methods , as applied to a specific family of stochastic differential equations .    as in @xcite ,",
    "our main methodology is the use of lyapunov functions .",
    "these are widely utilized in the literature , e.g. @xcite , to study the behavior of diffusion processes .",
    "it is well known that finding a lyapunov function to verify global stability can be highly nontrivial .",
    "we aim at a systematic approach to this problem by introducing the notion of a _",
    "lyapunov covering_. this method consists of identifying the regions which the process must exit prior to leaving the state space .",
    "moreover , we hope that our use of geometric control theory @xcite will elucidate the study of stochastic differential equations with degenerate noise .",
    "one class of such systems arises by writing a second - order equation in first - order form @xcite . in such equations",
    ", noise is effectively transferred through the average dynamics so that the support of the diffusion for all positive times is the whole space . in view of the support theorem @xcite ,",
    "this is proven by explicitly solving the associated control problem . in the cases treated here",
    ", it is more convenient to use geometric methods to uncover the accessibility sets of the control system .",
    "we find that , due to the even ( quadratic ) order of the coefficients of the average dynamics , noise only spreads to certain strict subsets of the state space .",
    "in what follows , let @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , @xmath6 .",
    "we study the stochastic differential equation in @xmath7 : @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are independent standard brownian motions .",
    "consider a two - dimensional spatially smooth turbulent flow .",
    "it was noted in @xcite that in our system with @xmath11 and @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 model the transverse and longitudinal components of the velocity difference of two heavy particles transported by the flow .",
    "ergodicity of this equation was assumed in @xcite to extract information on particle clustering as expressed through the top lyapunov exponent .",
    "subsequently , ergodicity was proven in @xcite . here , among other results , we provide an alternate proof of this fact .",
    "it was also noted in @xcite that , in this special case , equation can be written succinctly in the complex variable @xmath16 as : @xmath17 here we show that ergodicity of equation holds whenever @xmath1 ; thus stability in above is not due to its holomorphic structure .",
    "we shall see that this result is optimal in the sense that when @xmath18 , there are solutions which reach infinity in finite time with positive probability .",
    "it should be noted that the choice @xmath19 , @xmath6 is optimal as well . for fixed @xmath3 and @xmath20 , if @xmath21 @xmath22 , with probability one equation has solutions which explode to infinity in finite time .",
    "this is a simple consequence of feller s test @xcite applied to solutions starting along the negative real axis , hence we omit further discussion .    by working in this generality ,",
    "our goal is to make progress in understanding turbulent transport of heavy particles in spatially rough flows as well . in a two - dimensional flow with spatial hlder exponent @xmath23 ,",

    "for simplicity , to gain insight into the dynamics we assume @xmath27 is a positive constant ; in which case , we see that equation falls within the class .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in section [ results ]",
    ", we fix notation , state the main results , and outline our methods of proof . in section [ lyapunov ] , we show that when @xmath1 , the process @xmath31 is nonexplosive and that equation has ( at least one ) invariant probability measure . in section [ positivity ] , we prove uniqueness of the invariant probability measure using a combination of hrmander s theorem and geometric control theory arguments . in section [ explosion ] , we prove that when @xmath18 , the process @xmath31 with initial conditions in a certain region goes to infinity in finite time with positive probability .",

    "this means second order terms must be used along this trajectory .",
    "second , it is clear that noise with arbitrarily small magnitude in the @xmath124-direction will direct @xmath35 with @xmath125 off the unstable trajectory .",
    "once the process leaves the axis , the same noise that initially helped could now steer the process back to the unstable trajectory .",
    "this is reflected in the estimates for @xmath123 in a sufficiently large region which includes the negative @xmath122-axis . and third",
    ", once the process exits this region we must assure stability in the remaining regions as well . because the nature of the unperturbed dynamics changes significantly from the previous region ,",

    "the existence of such a covering is of course not sufficient to prove lemma [ lem1 ] . as suggested by the following proposition , however , finding a lyapunov covering is a step in the right direction .",
