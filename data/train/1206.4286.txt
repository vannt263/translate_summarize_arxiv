    "the exploration of the phase structure of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) has been a central topic in the study of the strong interactions for many years .",
    "theoretically , the qcd phase diagram has been investigated with either effective models or by first principle lattice qcd calculations .",
    "experimentally , the phase structure of strongly interacting matter is studied with the help of relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "experiments at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) and recent results from the large hadron collider ( lhc ) have indicated that the collisions at the very highest energies produce a strongly interacting quark - gluon plasma at nearly vanishing net - baryon density .",
    "meanwhile lattice qcd ( lqcd ) calculations have established that for vanishing net - baryon density the transition between the hadronic and partonic `` phase '' is an analytic cross over @xcite with a pseudo - critical temperature of @xmath6 aoki:2006br , bazavov:2011nk .",
    "therefore , true phase transitions , if at all present , will be located at finite values of the baryon density . indeed , model calculations predict a first order coexistence region at high baryon density ( several times nuclear matter density ) and moderate temperatures , which ends in a critical point ( for a compilation of various model results see , e.g. , @xcite ) . the precise location of this critical point ,",
    "however , is not yet known from theory .",
    "model calculations typically predict the location of the critical point to be at rather large values of the baryon number chemical potential , @xmath7 , which currently can not be explored by lattice qcd methods , due to the fermion sign problem .",
    "experimentally , the region of the phase diagram at finite density and moderate temperature is explored by heavy ion collisions at various energies . freeze out points extracted from experiments range from values of nearly vanishing baryon chemical potential for lhc and top rhic energies to values of @xmath8 at @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "since the location of the critical end point ( cep ) is not really known the entire accessible region of the phase diagram needs to be explored by scanning the full range of available beam energies .",
    "both the cep as well as the first - order phase transition are associated with characteristic fluctuations ",
    "long range for the second - order transition at the cep , and possible spinodal instabilities in case of a first order transition @xcite",
    ". therefore fluctuations of various quantities such as particle multiplicities or mean transverse momentum have been proposed as suitable observables @xcite .",
    "measurements of this sort have been  carried out by the na49 collaboration @xcite at the cern sps and are also part of the recently started rhic beam energy scan @xcite .",
    "the first results by the na49 collaboration @xcite , which concentrated on the variances of various particle ratios and the transverse momentum , showed only very small deviations from the expected poisson fluctuations of a hadron resonance gas ( hrg ) .",
    "meanwhile it has been realized that higher order cumulants would be more sensitive to the fluctuations associated with the second order transition , including the cep @xcite .",
    "the principle reason is that they scale with a higher power of the correlation length , which will be finite due to the rather short lifetime of the system created in these collisions . while the cumulants of many distributions may carry information about the cep , theoretically the cumulants of the net - baryon number and of the net - charge are preferable since they are well defined as derivatives of the qcd partition function with respect to the appropriate chemical potentials .",
    "in addition , fluctuations of conserved quantities are less affected by final state interaction in the hadronic phase @xcite .",
    "of course in an actual experiment , where the baryon number and electric charge of the entire system are conserved , corrections need to be applied to be able to compare with theoretical calculations which are typically carried out in the grand canonical ensemble , where charges are conserved only on the average .",
    "this point has been recently addressed , e.g. , in @xcite .",
    "in addition to corrections due to charge conservation , in a real experiment one only observes a fraction of the final state particles . in case of the net - baryon distribution , typically the neutrons",
    "are not observed .",
    "furthermore there are acceptance cuts as well as efficiency corrections for the protons , so that less than @xmath10 of baryons are actually observed .",
    "as we shall argue in this paper , this will lead to substantial corrections for the observed cumulants that need to be taken into account before any conclusions about critical fluctuations can be drawn .",
    "specifically we will show that it is _ not _ sufficient to know the distribution of net - baryons ( or net - charges ) @xmath11 in order to predict the observed cumulants of the net - proton distribution . instead",
    ", information for the full baryon / anti - baryon distribution , @xmath12 , is needed , which is not easily calculated in theory can only be calculated for systems where a quasi - particle description applies . ] . the same is true for the net - charge distribution , however in this case corrections are smaller since a larger fraction of charge particles are observed in a typical experiment .",
    "on the positive side , we will show that by measuring various factorial moments of the observed distribution one is able to extract the cumulants of the physical net - baryon distribution , @xmath11 , which is , after all , the desired goal .",
    "we note that the question of acceptance corrections to various moments of particle distributions have already been discussed in the literature .",
    "for example corrections to the variance or second order cumulants of the net charge and net baryon number distributions have been investigated in refs .",
    "@xcite , while acceptance effects on factorial moments have been addressed in @xcite . here",
    "we will concentrate on the corrections to higher order cumulants which are central to the discussion of the qcd critical point .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the following section we will derive the relation between the cumulants of the underlying distribution to that of the actually measured distribution , and",
    "we will show that additional information other than cumulants is required . in the next section",
    "we will present some examples to illustrate the problems which arise if the acceptance corrections are large , as it is the case for the measurement of the net - baryon distribution . before we conclude we will discuss a few observations pertinent to our results .",
    "suppose we have an underlying probability distribution @xmath13 which captures the full dynamics of the system .",
    "subsequently , we will refer to @xmath13 as the distribution within the `` required acceptance '' , where by required acceptance we mean that all particles that are necessary to capture the relevant physics are measured .",
    "this does not necessarily imply that all particles in the final state need to be measured . here",
    "@xmath14 and @xmath15 stand for either baryons and anti - baryons , i.e. , @xmath16 and @xmath17 or positively and negatively charged particles , i.e. , @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "let further @xmath0 be the net - baryon or net - charge cumulants associated with the underlying distribution @xmath13 .",
    "of course in a real experiment additional cuts such as in the transverse momentum or rapidity will have to be applied .",
    "in addition , the efficiency to detect particles will be smaller that @xmath20 ( in case of neutrons it is typically zero ) . to reflect this",
    "let us introduce the probability distribution @xmath21 of the actually observed multiplicities @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "let us further denote the net - baryon or net - charge cumulants of @xmath21 by @xmath1 .",
    "finally , we assume that all acceptance corrections may be modeled by a binomial probability distribution @xmath24    the parameters @xmath25 and @xmath26 describe all possible acceptance effects in our system .",
    "for example , the detector acceptance is naturally modeled by the binomial distribution and it can be different for different particles .",
    "additional cuts in the transverse or / and longitudinal momenta also introduce acceptance correction . in the context of the cumulants of the net - baryon distribution , it has been argued in refs .",
    "kitazawa:2011wh , kitazawa:2012at that the fact that neutrons are not observed in a typical experiment may also be modeled by a binomial distribution .",
    "thus , eq . ( [ pp ] ) applies as well . finally , we note that the different sources of limited acceptance can be represented by an effective parameter , which is simply the product of all binomial probabilities . for example , in case of the net - proton distribution : @xmath27 ( number of protons ) , @xmath28 ( number of anti - protons ) , see eq .",
    "( [ pp ] ) , and @xmath29where @xmath30 represents the fact that only protons are measured instead of baryons ( @xmath31 ) , @xmath32 characterizes the cut in momentum for measured protons , @xmath33 is a detector efficiency for protons in a given momentum cut , and so on .",
    "similar relation holds for @xmath26 .    in order to proceed",
    "it is convenient to introduce the factorial moments:@xmath34 using eq .",
    "( [ pp ] ) it is straightforward to show ( see e.g. @xcite):@xmath35 the next step is to express the cumulants @xmath0 of the distribution @xmath36 in terms of the factorial moments @xmath37 . using the relation , eq .",
    "( [ fmg ] ) , we can then write @xmath0 in terms to the measured factorial moments @xmath38 for given acceptance parameters @xmath25 and @xmath26 . finally @xmath38 can be expressed by the cumulants @xmath1 , which will allow us to relate @xmath0 to @xmath39 . however , as we shall see below , the factorial moments @xmath38 and @xmath37 in general can not be solely expressed in terms of the cumulants of the net distributions , @xmath1 and @xmath40 , respectively .",
    "additional terms , not related to cumulants will arise .",

    "<S> we show that the effect of finite acceptance drastically influences the net - baryon and net - charge cumulants , which are believed to be sensitive probes of the qcd phase diagram . </S>",

    "<S> we find that this relation involves additional moments which can not be expressed by cumulants and should be measured in order to extract any potential information about the qcd critical point . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that for a wide range of the true cumulant ratios @xmath3 the measured ratios @xmath4 quickly converge if @xmath5 , which makes the interpretation of the data very challenging , especially in case of the net - proton cumulants . </S>",
    "<S> our study further suggests that the measurement of net - charge cumulants may be more advantageous for the investigation of the qcd phase diagram . </S>"
