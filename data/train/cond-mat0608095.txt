    "since the parallel rows of rectangles spanning the graphene reciprocal space have a nonzero relative shift along @xmath48 ( and therefore the generic graphene wave vectors @xmath99 and @xmath100 are not equivalent ) , the relation obtained from each single cross - section in general is not periodic with period equal to @xmath94 ( the width of the nanotube brillouin zone ) . nevertheless , since the relative shift along @xmath48 between rows of rectangles is an integer multiple of the distance @xmath96 between the @xmath22 parallel lines , we find , starting from a wave vector @xmath99 on one of the @xmath22 lines and moving by @xmath94 along @xmath54 and by a proper multiple of @xmath96 along @xmath14 , a wave vector equivalent to @xmath99 on another of the @xmath22 lines of allowed wave vectors .",

    "once we have found these wave vectors , we can cross - section the graphene dispersion relations just along the segments in their proximity , if we want only the mentioned most relevant energy bands .",

    "the positions of the maximum and minimum points are well known ( @xmath117 and @xmath118 are at the vertices of the hexagon ) and thus the regions of interest are clearly located .",
    "following this method , however , in order to fold the computed cross - sections into the nanotube brillouin zone ( the segment of the @xmath54 axis characterized by @xmath131 ) , it is not sufficient to consider the @xmath132 component along @xmath54 of the graphene wave vector ( the absolute value of this component can be greater than @xmath133 ) , but we also need to find the nanotube wave vector equivalent to @xmath132 inside the nanotube brillouin zone .",
    "moreover , since the graphene degeneration points are on the boundary of the sectioned hexagonal region , in order to obtain the nanotube bands around their minima and maxima we have to properly join the results computed cross - sectioning the graphene dispersion relations near the six vertices ( each of which gives only parts of the desired bands ) ; this strongly increases the algorithmic complexity of the involved computations .",
    "we have proposed an alternative choice of unit vectors for the graphene sheet which , once rolled up , forms a carbon nanotube .",
    "these vectors , which depend on the considered nanotube , are closely related to the rectangular region of the graphene reciprocal space where the zone - folding method is most easily applied , and allow us to better understand the relation between this rectangular area and the overall reciprocal space . in particular , we have shown that our choice of unit vectors can be exploited to find , from any graphene wave vector , the equivalent wave vector inside the rectangular region and can therefore be useful whenever the zone - folding technique is applied to obtain the physical properties of the carbon nanotube from those of graphene . as an example",

    "<S> the dispersion relations of carbon nanotubes are often obtained cross - sectioning those of graphene ( zone - folding technique ) in a rectangular region of the reciprocal space , where it is easier to fold the resulting relations into the nanotube brillouin zone . </S>",
    "<S> we propose a particular choice of the unit vectors for the graphene lattice , which consists of the symmetry vector and the translational vector of the considered carbon nanotube . due to the properties of the corresponding unit vectors in the reciprocal space </S>",
    "<S> , this choice is particularly useful for understanding the relationship between the rectangular region where the folding procedure is most easily applied and the overall graphene reciprocal space . </S>",
    "<S> such a choice allows one to find , from any graphene wave vector , the equivalent one inside the rectangular region in a computationally inexpensive way . as an example , we show how the use of these unit vectors makes it easy to limit the computation to the bands nearest to the energy maxima and minima when determining the nanotube dispersion relations from those of graphene with the zone - folding technique . </S>"
