    "@xcite therefore , if magnetic impurities are responsible for these effects is dubious .",
    "since the behavior of magnetic impurities is sensitive to the applied magnetic field , studies of energy relaxation in presence of the magnetic field could either rule out or validate magnetic impurities as relevant scattering process in energy relaxation .",
    "recently , anthore _",

    "here , we briefly describe the experimental situation in ref .   and a possible qualitative explanation of their findings .    the experimental setup in ref .",
    "consists of a thin copper wire of about 45 nm thickness , 105 nm width , and 5 @xmath1 m length connected with two metallic leads .",
    "the leads are biased by an external voltage source @xmath2 mv and @xmath3 mv imposing a steady state current through the wire .",
    "the setup is placed in a dilution refrigerator with a temperature of @xmath4 mk and a magnetic field up to @xmath5 t is applied . the elastic mean",
    "free path can be estimated to be much smaller than the length of the wire , @xmath6 , so that the transport of electrons between the contacts is diffusive .",
    "the diffusion constant @xmath7 = 90 @xmath8/s , estimated from the low temperature resistance , leads to a diffusion time of @xmath9 ns .",
    "the aim of the experiment was to study energy distribution of electrons .",
    "the distribution function was determined by tunneling to an underlying aluminum probe electrode .",
    "the differential tunneling conductance is given by a convolution over the electron distribution functions in the wire and in the probe electrode , both for @xmath10 and @xmath11 , _ cf .",
    "_ with refs .   and  , respectively . in the case of vanishing magnetic field",
    "the aluminum probe electrode is in the superconducting state , and the peaked density of states of the probe electrode allows one to straightforwardly extract the energy distribution in the wire from the i - v characteristic of the junction .    for finite magnetic fields , however , the aluminum probe electrode is in the normal state . in this case",
    "the deconvolution has been made using a zero bias anomaly .",
    "unfortunately , the latter procedure is less accurate . considering the numerical transformation depicted in fig .  2 of ref .",
    ", we expect that the strongest variations due to uncertainties in the shape and the depth of the zero bias anomaly arise at the `` fermi points '' @xmath12 .",
    "furthermore , the tunnel probe experiment in equilibrium , @xmath13 , gave the temperature of @xmath14 mk which differs from the actual refrigerator temperature .",
    "this might be due to an oversimplification of the environmental impedance responsible for the zero bias anomaly .",
    "@xcite consequently , the resulting distribution function has to be taken with some care , in particular near the fermi points .",
    "the electron distribution function in the absence of inelastic scattering is just a linear combination of the distributions in the left and right electrode  @xcite @xmath15 here , @xmath16 is the fermi function while @xmath17 is the longitudinal coordinate of the observation point in units of the total length , @xmath6 . at low temperatures",
    "the distribution @xmath18 has steps in both @xmath19 and @xmath17 dependencies .",
    "these steps are smeared by inelastic processes , such as electron  phonon and electron  electron interaction . as a result",
    ", the distribution in the middle of the wire turns out to be almost insensitive to the bath temperature .",
    "@xcite the smearing depends on the effective inelastic relaxation time , and the latter can be estimated from the experimentally observed distribution function .",
    "the first experiments  @xcite for @xmath10 have clearly shown that the smearing is too strong to be attributed to the electron  electron or electron  phonon interaction .",
    "therefore , in the following we do not take these interactions into account .",
    "the qualitative outcome of the experiment  @xcite is that the behavior of the inelastic relaxation rate is a non  monotonous function of the magnetic field @xmath20 . for @xmath21 , the relaxation rate",
    "_ increases _ with magnetic field and reaches a maximum at @xmath22 . at stronger fields , @xmath23 , it decreases with further increasing magnetic field , and at @xmath24 it reaches almost the same value as it had at @xmath10 and",
    "then decreases further .",
    "the explanation of such a complex behavior given in ref .   is based on electron scattering by magnetic impurities .",
    "for vanishing magnetic field the spin system is degenerate and only second or higher order scattering processes contribute to energy relaxation . for finite magnetic fields",
    ", there exists also a first order contribution with energy @xmath25 ( equal to the zeeman splitting ) transferred to or from the spin system .",
    "therefore , the energy relaxation rate increases . however , for @xmath26 the spins are completely polarized and can no longer contribute to energy relaxation .",
    "consequently , again only higher order processes are effective . comparing this explanation with the experiment ,",
    "one estimates the gyromagnetic factor for the impurity spins as @xmath27 .",
    "thus , electron ",
    "spin interaction taken into account in the lowest order of the perturbation theory explains , in principle , the main experimental features .",
    "however , from the theoretical point of view , there appears a subtlety .",
    "the problem is that the higher order terms , estimated within the framework of the @xmath28matrix approach in refs .",
    ", lead to a divergent contribution @xmath29 to be integrated over . here",
    "@xmath30 is the renormalized coupling constant which defines the strength of the electron ",
    "impurity interaction .",
    "the suggestion  @xcite to introduce a cutoff at the korringa width  @xcite , @xmath31 gives a result that is comparable with the first order contribution .",
    "consequently , there is no systematic expansion in powers of the coupling constant , and one needs a generalized approach which is not based on expansion in terms of the interaction strength .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to develop an approach able to treat lowest and higher order contributions within a unified scheme .",
    "we show that the problem can be described as electrons coupled to a dissipative spin system .",
    "the dissipation of impurity spins is , in turn , caused by creation / annihilation of electron  hole pairs due to electron ",
    "spin coupling .",
    "we show that this scheme includes the divergent higher  order contributions appearing in the @xmath28matrix approach . using our approach",
    ", we derive an electron ",
    "spin collision integral expressed through spin ",
    "spin correlation functions",
    ". an important feature of these correlation functions is that their dependences on the electron energy is automatically broadened by korringa",
    " type processes .",
    "these processes , however , depend on the actual electron distribution rather than on the thermal equilibrium distribution as in ref .  .",
    "as a result , the applied voltage plays the role of an effective temperature .    the crucial difference between the cases @xmath10 and @xmath32 is the following .",
    "at zero magnetic field all spin  spin correlation functions are centered at zero energy and behave as @xmath33 .",
    "it is important that in the collision integral these correlators are multiplied by a combination of the electron distribution functions which at small energies is proportional to @xmath19 .",

    "the resulting collision integral becomes proportional to @xmath35 and one recovers the results  @xcite of the @xmath28matrix approach .    at finite magnetic fields , however , the spin ",
    "spin correlation function decomposes into three contributions .",
    "the non spin  flip part is still centered at zero energy , while the two spin  flip contributions are peaked at @xmath36 .",
    "let us for a moment accept the above simplified form of the correlation function and assume @xmath37 . since in this case @xmath38\\to",

    "only the non spin  flip correlation function contributes to the order @xmath35 in the collision integral .",
    "using the @xmath28matrix approach with a finite cutoff @xmath40 , introduced by hand , would lead to a double counting of the first order in @xmath39 contribution . here ,",
    "on the other hand , the cutoff is included automatically and the first order is accounted for correctly .    in this simplified case the reasoning to explain the experimental data follows the lines of the experimentalists .",
    "the only difference is that for @xmath26 where the spin ",
    "flip contribution is already frozen out there remains just @xmath41 of the @xmath10 energy relaxation because only the non spin  flip component contributes to energy relaxation in order @xmath35 . in practice , @xmath40 is not constant but depends on frequency that the correlation functions are not lorentzian shaped and therefore the spin ",
    "flip terms will also contribute to the @xmath35 term .",
    "further , the width decreases with increasing magnetic field for the non spin  flip component and therefore energy relaxation mediated by magnetic impurities dies out for @xmath42 .",
    "we believe that our approach provides a consistent explanation of the magnetic field dependence of the non  equilibrium electron distribution in diffusive wires with magnetic impurities .",
