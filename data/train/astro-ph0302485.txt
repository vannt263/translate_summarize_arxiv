    "the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) transient supersoft x - ray source ( hereafter rx  j0513 ) was discovered by rosat @xcite and has been extensively observed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* for recent progress ) .",
    "soon after the x - ray discovery , it was optically identified as a binary with an orbital period of 0.76 days @xcite .",
    "its remarkable observational features are summarized as follows : ( 1 ) optical monitoring of rx  j0513 shows quasi - regular transitions between high ( @xmath2 ) and low ( @xmath3 ) states @xcite . ( 2 ) the duration of the optical high state is @xmath4 days while the low states last for @xmath5 days ( see , e.g. , fig . 1 of * ? ? ?",
    "* for recent observational summary ) .",
    "( 3 ) copious supersoft x - rays ( @xmath6 ev ) were detected only in the optical low state ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "( 4 ) the transitions between x - ray off and on are very rapid , in about one day or so , while the optical transitions from high to low occurs in several days ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the transition mechanism between high and low states has not been fully elucidated yet , although a few ideas were proposed so far ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * for a recent progress ) .",
    "very recently , based on an optically thick wind model of mass - accreting white dwarfs ( wds ) , @xcite have proposed a new transition mechanism between optical high / x - ray off and optical low / x - ray on states .",
    "they first modeled light curves of the 2000 outburst of the recurrent nova and then showed that the size of a disk around the wd expands largely up to the companion star or over in a strong wind phase . including this effect of disk expansion in the strong wind phase , they have reproduced a sharp @xmath7 mag rise in the optical light curve of rx  j0513 .",
    "this is the optical high / x - ray off state , because the optically thick winds of wds certainly obscure supersoft x - rays .",
    "on the other hand , it drops sharply by a magnitude when the wind stops because the size of the disk returns to its original size .",
    "this is the optical low / x - ray on state .",
    "however , @xcite gave only a simple outline of their mechanism without detailed physical descriptions .",
    "in this paper , we propose a full description of the mechanism and calculate light curves for various conditions .",
    "we are able to reproduce basic features of the observed light curves by this new mechanism .",
    "it has been frequently discussed that supersoft x - ray sources ( ssss ) are progenitors of type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) .",
    "one of the promising evolutionary models to sne ia has been proposed by @xcite .",
    "they theoretically found that mass accreting wds blow strong winds when the mass accretion to the wd exceeds a critical rate , i.e. , @xmath8  yr@xmath1 .",
    "the so - called common envelope evolution does not occur ( see * ? ? ? * for a recent summary ) .",
    "the wd accretes hydrogen - rich matter and burns it atop the wd at the critical rate of @xmath9 . the excess matter transferred above the critical rate",
    "is expelled by winds , i.e. , @xmath10 .",
    "in such a situation , the wd can grow up to near the chandrasekhar mass ( and eventually explode as an sn ia ) .",
    "this is called the accretion wind evolution @xcite against the common envelope evolution @xcite .",
    "thus , the accretion wind evolution is a key evolutionary process to produce type ia supernovae .",
    "binary systems in the accretion wind evolution are predicted to exist but no such systems have been identified yet . here , we have reached the conclusion that is the first example just in the accretion wind evolution , i.e. , in the way to an sn ia , the reason of which will be discussed below .",
    "a brief summary follows : the wind ejection process occurs not continuously but intermittently because the mass transfer is attenuated by the strong wind itself .    in  2 , an outline of our basic model of rx  j0513 is briefly introduced and summarized .",
    "our new mechanism of transition between the optical high and low states , in which the mass transfer rate is attenuated by winds , is formulated in  3 .",
    "a limit cycle model is given in  4 for rx  j0513 long - term light curve variations .",
    "discussion and conclusions follow in  5 and  6 , respectively .",
    "long - term variations in the optical light curves of are considered as a limit cycle ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . before going to detailed descriptions",
    ", we here give a rough sketch on our new mechanism .",
    "we adopt a binary system consisting of a wd , a disk around the wd , and a lobe - filling main - sequence ( ms ) companion , as illustrated in figure [ rxj0513_fig ] . a circular orbit is assumed .",
    "an essential thing is that wds blow an optically thick , strong wind when the mass accretion rate to the wd exceeds the critical rate , i.e. , @xmath11  yr@xmath1 . if the ms companion is @xmath12 , the mass transfer rate from the ms , @xmath13 , is as large as a few times @xmath14  yr@xmath1 or more ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we distinguish @xmath13 from @xmath15 because @xmath16 in some cases mentioned below .",
    "time - evolution of our limit cycle model is schematically summarized in figure [ vmagfit_rxj0513_self_one ] ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "a rapid mass accretion to the wd begins at a in figure [ vmagfit_rxj0513_self_one ] .",
    "the mass of the wd envelope rapidly increases and the wd envelope expands to blow an optically thick , strong wind .",
    "the strong wind causes a quick rise of @xmath17-mag at b , because the disk expands to a few to several times the previous size , that is , the disk expands from configuration ( c ) to configuration ( a ) in figure [ rxj0513_fig ] . because the disk is the main source in the optical light due to its irradiation effect",
    ", this expansion of the disk area causes a magnitude rise in the optical light .",
    "the massive winds having the rate of @xmath18  yr@xmath1 certainly absorb supersoft x - rays .",
    "thus , this phase is the optical high and x - ray off state .",
    "as the wd photosphere expands further during the rapid mass accretion phase , optical brightness increases further from b to c even if the disk shape does not change in the wind phase .    the strong wind hits the ms companion and then strips - off its very surface layer .",
    "the gas stripped - off is lost from the binary .",
    "therefore , the rapid mass accretion is suppressed by the strong wind itself .",
    "the mass - stripping rate is roughly proportional to the wind mass loss rate .",
    "as the wind mass loss rate increases , the mass - stripping rate eventually overcomes the mass transfer rate .",
    "this happens at c. however , the accretion disk still continues to supply mass to the wd at least during the viscous timescale of the accretion disk , @xmath19 .",
    "then , mass accretion to the wd stops at c about @xmath19 after the mass transfer from the ms stops .    the mass of the wd envelope is now gradually decreasing due mainly to wind mass loss .",
    "the photosphere of the wd is also gradually shrinking .",
    "this makes a gradual decay of the optical light curve even if the disk shape is the same .",
    "the wind eventually stops at d. we expect copious supersoft x - rays after the wind stops .",
    "the disk shrinks to a normal size at e , that is , from configuration ( a ) to configuration ( b ) in figure [ rxj0513_fig ] .",
    "this causes a sharp @xmath7 mag drop in the optical light . a rapid mass transfer from the ms to the disk resumes at e , and",
    "then the disk edge flares up at f , that is , configuration ( b ) to configuration ( c ) in figure [ rxj0513_fig ] .",
    "it takes several dynamical timescales to change from e to f. this phase corresponds to the optical low and x - ray on state .    because mass accretes to the wd via an accretion disk , this rapid mass accretion flow reaches the wd surface at g(=a ) about @xmath19 after the rapid mass transfer from the ms resumes .",
    "thus , the cycle is repeated .",
    "a relatively massive white dwarf is suggested because of a rapid contraction timescale of the wd photosphere during the transition from optical high to low states ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we have adopted @xmath20 after @xcite but later examined other cases of the wd mass , i.e. , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 .",
    "since the lmc metallicity is reported to be about a third of the solar metallicity , we assume the metallicity of @xmath24 and hydrogen content of @xmath25 for the envelope of the wd .",
    "the mass ratio is assumed to be @xmath26 because mass transfer occurs on a thermal timescale and a rate of @xmath27  yr@xmath1 is suggested by @xcite .",
    "then , the companion mass is @xmath28 for @xmath20 .",
    "the non - irradiated surface temperature of the lobe - filling @xmath29 ms companion is 13,000 k for the metallicity of @xmath24 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    for the orbital period of @xmath30 days ( see below )",
    ", the separation is @xmath31 , the radii of the effective roche lobes are @xmath32 for the primary ( wd ) and @xmath33 for the secondary ( ms ) component .",
    "the radius of a @xmath34 zero - age main - sequence ( zams ) star is @xmath35 for @xmath24 , so that the secondary has already evolved to expand but still remains at the main - sequence ( before exhaustion of central hydrogen ) .",
    "the ephemeris of rx  j0513 has been revised by @xcite as @xmath36 at minima of the optical orbital modulations .",
    "we use this revised ephemeris with the ms companion being in front of the wd at minima ( see also fig . 5 of * ? ? ?",
    "the inclination angle is not known but suggested to be low .",
    "here we adopt @xmath37 .",
    "calculated light curves are not so different among @xmath38 as shown later .",
    "time evolution of the photospheric radius and temperature of the wd are calculated from kato & hachisu s ( 1994 ) optically thick wind solutions after @xcite , i.e. , @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the hydrogen - rich envelope mass of the wd , @xmath15 the mass accretion rate to the wd , @xmath41 the decreasing rate by nuclear burning , and @xmath42 the wind mass loss rate of the wd .",

    "* ) , so that it is as large as @xmath53  yr@xmath1 or more .",
    "when the mass transfer rate , @xmath13 , exceeds the critical rate , i.e. , @xmath54 the mass - accreting wd expands to blow optically thick winds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the mass loss rate approximately given by @xmath55 when all the transferred matter accretes to the wd , i.e. , @xmath56 .",
    "equation ( [ critical_mass_accretion ] ) is the same form as that for the solar metallicity ( @xmath57 ) , but valid even for a lower metallicity of @xmath24 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "when strong winds collide with the surface of the companion , the surface is shock - heated and ablated in the wind .",
    "we estimate the shock - heating by assuming that the velocity component normal to the surface is dissipated by shock and its kinetic energy is converted into the thermal energy of the surface layer .",
    "the very surface layer of the envelope expands to be easily ablated in the wind .",
    "we regard that gas is ablated and lost from l3 point ( l3 is the outer lagrange point near the ms companion ) when the gas gets the same amount of thermal energy as the difference of the roche potentials between the ms surface and l3 point .",
    "then the mass stripping rate is given by @xmath58 where @xmath59 , @xmath60 is the separation of the binary , @xmath61 the roche potential at the ms surface , @xmath62 means the roche potential at l3 point near the ms companion , both of which are normalized by @xmath63 , @xmath64 the efficiency of conversion from kinetic energy to thermal energy by shock , @xmath65 is the geometrical factor of the ms surface hit by the wind including the dissipation effect ( normal component of the wind velocity ) , and @xmath65 is only a function of the mass ratio @xmath66 ( see * ? ? ? * for more details ) .",
    "here we modified equation ( 21 ) of @xcite to include the effect of roche lobe overflow from l3 point .",
    "then the stripping rate is estimated as @xmath67 where @xmath68 the efficiency of conversion is assumed to be @xmath69 .",
    "then , we have @xmath70 for the wind velocity of @xmath71  km  s@xmath1 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 for the mass ratio @xmath76 @xcite .    in such a wind phase , the net mass accretion rate to the wd , @xmath15 , is modified as @xmath77 as illustrated in figure [ binary_flow ] .",
    "here we adopt a small value of @xmath78  yr@xmath1 when @xmath79 because the mass accretion to the wd does not stop abruptly but probably continues at least for a draining time of the accretion disk .",
    "we do not know the exact draining time of the accretion disk after the mass transfer from the ms stops .",
    "alternatively , we just assume a small rate of the mass accretion @xmath80 to mimic the draining of the disk during that @xmath79 .",
    "to know when the rapid mass accretion resumes , we monitor the upper level of flow in figure [ binary_flow ] as @xmath81 with the initial value of @xmath82 . during that @xmath83 , @xmath84 decreases to a large negative value as illustrated in figure [ binary_flow]b .",
    "then the mass transfer from the ms stops or its rate drops to @xmath80 .",
    "once the mass accretion rate drops below the critical rate , i.e. , @xmath85 , the wind gradually weakens and eventually stops . the stripping effect vanishes ( @xmath86 ) and",
    "then the level of flow begins to rise .",
    "we start again the rapid mass accretion when the level reaches @xmath82 as illustrated in figure [ binary_flow]a .    it should be noticed that equation ( [ on_white_dwarf_surface ] ) is on the wd but equations ( [ strip_off_origin])@xmath87([on_secondary_surface ] ) are on the ms .",
    "therefore , the mass accretion rate , @xmath15 , may not be the same on each side at the specific time , @xmath88 , because it takes a viscous timescale of the accretion disk for gas to reach the wd surface from the ms surface .",
    "here we adopt a viscous timescale of @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the viscosity , @xmath91 the @xmath92 parameter of @xcite , @xmath93 the sound speed , and @xmath94 the vertical height of the accretion disk .",
    "we adopt @xmath95 and @xmath96 for @xmath97  k and @xmath98 km  s@xmath1 .",
    "then , we have @xmath99      the irradiation effects both of the disk and of the ms companion play an essential role in the light curve modeling . for the basic structure of the accretion disk , we assume an axi - symmetric structure with the size and thickness of @xmath100 and @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the outer edge of the accretion disk , @xmath103 is the effective radius of the inner critical roche lobe for the wd component , @xmath104 is the height of the surface from the equatorial plane , and @xmath105 is the distance on the equatorial plane from the center of the wd .",
    "such binary models are illustrated in figure [ rxj0513_fig ] .",
    "we assume that the photosphere of the wd , the ms companion , and the accretion disk emit photons as a blackbody at a local temperature which varies with position .",
    "we adopt @xmath106 during the strong wind phases , i.e. , configuration ( a ) in figure [ rxj0513_fig ] and just after the wind stops ( but before a rapid mass transfer from the ms resumes ) , i.e. , configuration ( b ) in figure [ rxj0513_fig ] , but @xmath107 in the no wind case , i.e. , configuration ( c ) in figure [ rxj0513_fig ] .",
    "this @xmath105-square law mimics the effect of elevated rim of the accretion disk by spray as discussed by @xcite for luminous supersoft x - ray sources . on the other hand",
    ", we simply assume @xmath106 in the wind phase , because such an elevated rim is blown in the wind during a strong wind phase .",
    "the efficiency of irradiation is assumed to be @xmath108 both for the disk and for the companion ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    the size and thickness of disk , @xmath92 and @xmath109 , are also the important parameters that determine the brightness of disk by irradiation effects .",
    "@xcite have determined @xmath92 and @xmath109 from the light curve fitting of in outburst .",
    "the disk expands up to the companion star as shown in figure [ rxj0513_fig]a , i.e. , @xmath110 , because the disk surface is blown in the wind .",
    "it shrinks to a normal size of @xmath111 after the wind stops .",
    "these two parameters of @xmath112 are determined as @xmath113 , during the wind phase , just after the wind stops , and then the rapid mass transfer resumes , respectively ( see * ? ? ? * for more details ) .",
    "the shrink from a large , extended size to a normal size is important in the modeling of a sharp @xmath7 mag drop in the optical light curve .",
    "thus , a large expansion of the disk in the strong wind phase has been first confirmed in the 2000 outburst of the recurrent nova .",
    "we find essentially the same sets of @xmath112 as in @xcite is valid for rx  j0513 .",
    "we may understand such a large expansion of the disk beyond the roche lobe as follows : observationally very fast winds have been reported , for example , @xmath114 km  s@xmath1 in rx  j0513 ( see , e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the wind mass loss rate is calculated to be @xmath115  yr@xmath1 in such a strong wind phase ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "there is a large velocity difference between the wind and the disk surface .",
    "it certainly drives the kelvin - helmholtz instability at the interface , so that the very surface layer of the disk is dragged away outward with the velocity at least several hundred km  s@xmath1 , i.e. , almost a free stream going outward .",
    "this surface free stream is initially optically thick at the original disk region but becomes optically thin somewhere outside because of geometrical dilution effect .",
    "only the optically thick region of disk stream can contribute to the optical light by irradiation , so that we regard the radius of transition region between optically thick and thin as the edge of the disk . in this sense , the disk edge as shown in figure [ rxj0513_fig]a is not the boundary of matter but just a transition from optically thick to thin of the disk surface flow .",
    "it should be noted that a high density part of the disk is hardly changed by this relatively tenuous surface free stream and resides in within its roche lobe because the internal density of the disk is much denser than that of the wd wind . in the case of figure [ vmagfit_rxj0513_self ] , for example",
    ", the wind mass loss rate is about @xmath116  yr@xmath1 and its velocity is @xmath117 km  s@xmath1 , so that the density of the wind is estimated from the continuity ( @xmath118 ) to be about @xmath119 g  @xmath120 at the distance of @xmath121 from the center of the wd . on the other hand ,",
    "the density of the standard accretion disk is about @xmath122 g  @xmath120 at the same radius . here , we assume the standard accretion disk model @xcite with the mass accretion rate of @xmath123  yr@xmath1",
    ".    it should be also addressed that optically thick winds are accelerated deep inside the photosphere ( @xmath124 ) but the wind itself becomes optically thin ( @xmath125 ) far above the wd photosphere as the definition of photosphere .",
    "therefore , we do not expect any large optical contribution from the wind itself far outside the wd photosphere ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * for an estimation of small wind contributions to the optical light ) .",
    "the numerical methods for obtaining light curves , including the above irradiation effects , have been described in more detail in @xcite .",

    "the low state gradually shortens and eventually disappears as the mass transfer rate increases to @xmath182  yr@xmath1 for a set of @xmath183days and @xmath184 .",
    "the luminosity of high states is brighter for higher mass transfer rates of @xmath13 .",

    "in general , more massive white dwarfs have a larger wind mass loss rate , so that the duration of the wind phase becomes much shorter . because we do not know the exact number of @xmath19 , our guided principle is that we tune @xmath19 to satisfy the duration of the low state is 40 days , i.e. , @xmath157 days . for the case of @xmath21 shown in figure [ vmagfit_rxj0513_self_wdm1350 ]",
    ", we have tuned the viscous timescale @xmath19 at the mass transfer rate of @xmath188  yr@xmath1 .",

    "the durations of high / low states are similar to those for @xmath20 in figure [ vmagfit_rxj0513_self_acc ] except for the relatively short durations .",
    "the wd mass in rx  j0513 may be less massive than @xmath190 , because the gradual decay of the light curve in high states seems to be too fast to be compatible with the observation .",
    "for the case of @xmath191 shown in figure [ vmagfit_rxj0513_self_wdm1200 ] , we have tuned the viscous timescale at the mass transfer rate of @xmath192  yr@xmath1 , i.e. , @xmath193 days .",
    "the durations of high states are longer than those for @xmath20 in figure [ vmagfit_rxj0513_self_acc ] .",
    "the wd mass in rx  j0513 may be somewhere between @xmath22 and @xmath194 , because the decay of the light curve in high states seems to be slightly slower than , but in reasonable agreement with , the observation .",
    "for the case of @xmath195 shown in figure [ vmagfit_rxj0513_self_wdm1100 ] , we have tuned the viscous timescale at the mass transfer rate of @xmath196  yr@xmath1 , i.e. , @xmath197 days .",
    "the durations of high states are much longer than those for @xmath20 in figure [ vmagfit_rxj0513_self_acc ] .",
    "the wd mass of @xmath23 may not be the case , because the decay of the light curve in high states is too slow to be compatible with the observation .",
    "it is a difficult work to accurately estimate the effect of mass - stripping , that is , to determine the coefficient of @xmath198 in equation ( [ mass_stripping_rate ] ) .",
    "therefore , we calculate two other cases of @xmath198 , i.e. , @xmath199 and @xmath200 and examine how the light curves depend on the coefficient .",
    "it is obvious that strong modulation of the mass transfer rate never occurs for the case of @xmath201 because there is no case of @xmath202 .",

    "for the case of @xmath203 shown in figure [ vmagfit_rxj0513_self_wdm1300_strip_c5 ] , the overall features of light curves are essentially similar to the case of @xmath204 shown in figure [ vmagfit_rxj0513_self_acc ] .",
    "main differences are that ( 1 ) the tuned viscous timescale is @xmath205 days at @xmath206  yr@xmath1 , much longer than @xmath128 days for @xmath204 , and ( 2 ) bumps at the head of high states continue for a much longer period and may not be compatible with the observation .    for the case of @xmath207 shown in figure [ vmagfit_rxj0513_self_wdm1300_strip_c015 ] , a new thing is the appearance of no modulation in mass transfer for a range of @xmath208  yr@xmath209  yr@xmath1 .",
    "the tuned viscous timescale is @xmath210 days at @xmath206  yr@xmath1 .",
    "bumps at the head of high states continue for about 40 days .",
    "both the viscous timescale and the duration of bumps are much longer than those for @xmath211 and @xmath212 .",
    "the long duration of bumps is not compatible with the observation .",
    "an important result in this subsection is that modulation in mass transfer occurs and optical high / low states appear even for relatively low efficiencies of mass - stripping on the ms , i.e. , for @xmath207 , if the viscous timescale is relatively long , i.e. , @xmath213 days .",
    "such a low case of @xmath198 may correspond to a low velocity case of winds as understood from equation ( [ mass_stripping_rate_real ] ) and a relatively long viscous timescale is realized for binaries with a longer orbital period , for example , longer than a day , as derived from equation ( [ viscous_timescale ] ) .",
    "it has been argued that only a viable mechanism for the transition between the optical high / x - ray off and optical low / x - ray on states is the contraction / expansion of the wd photosphere resulting from the variation of the mass accretion rate to the wd ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although a few other mechanisms have ever been proposed ( see , e.g. , discussion of * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , we first examine whether or not this mechanism can explain all the observational features .",
    "@xcite detected a very sharp rise ( @xmath214 days ) and a steep decline ( @xmath215 days ) in supersoft x - rays by a factor of @xmath216 .",
    "this requires a contraction / expansion of the wd photosphere by a factor of @xmath217 and an increase / decrease of the photospheric temperature by a factor of @xmath218 @xcite .",
    "we have estimated the timescale of contracting / expanding wd envelopes based on our wind and static solutions .",
    "the wd photosphere gradually shrinks during the wind phase while it begins to contract most rapidly just after the wind stops ( see the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ vmagfit_rxj0513_self ] ) . even for this most rapid",
    "shrink phase , it takes about three kelvin - helmholtz timescale to shrink by a factor of four , i.e. , @xmath219 from our model calculations .",
    "this kelvin - helmholtz timescale is defined by @xmath220 where @xmath221 is the thermal energy of the wd envelope , and @xmath222 the luminosity of the wd , just when the wind stops .",
    "these contraction timescales just after the wind stops are plotted against various wd masses in figure [ thermal_time ] .",
    "it is obvious that the rapid ( @xmath215 days ) change in the soft x - ray flux can not be explained by the contraction of the wd photosphere even if we assume the extreme case of @xmath223 ( at least , for @xmath24 ) .    for the expansion case of the wd photosphere during the rapid mass accretion phase",
    ", our steady - state wind model does not correctly include the compression term by accretion so that the estimated timescale is not so accurate . in this sense",
    ", our numerical results can not give a strong constraint on the timescale of photospheric expansion .",
    "it should be pointed out , however , that usual time - dependent henyey methods fail to be converged in a rapidly expanding photosphere of wds and are now unable to involve wind mass loss .",
    "@xcite suggested a characteristic decay timescale of 34 days from the exponential decay of supersoft x - rays in an optical low state . in our model , there are two possibilities .",
    "one is the timescale of expansion / contraction of the wd photosphere and the other is the viscous timescale of the accretion disk , @xmath19 .",
    "if this 34 days timescale is related to the expansion / contraction timescale of a wd envelope , its wd mass is somewhere between @xmath224 and @xmath225 for the metallicity of @xmath24 as shown in figure [ thermal_time ] .",
    "this mass range of the wd is consistent with our long - term light curve modulations . on the other hand , if it indicates that @xmath226 days , the ranges of the parameters are also suggested to be @xmath227 and @xmath228 from table [ high_low_states ]",
    ". these are also consistent with our long - term light curve modulations .",
    "@xcite suggested that star spots on the secondary surface cover the l1 point , resulting in a decreased mass transfer rate from the secondary .",
    "this mechanism has been originally suggested by @xcite for the vy scl stars . in rx",
    "j0513 , however , it is very unlikely that the ms companion develops star spots on its surface , because its mass is suggested to be @xmath229 , not having a deep surface convection .",
    "very recently , @xcite reported radial velocity modulations of @xmath230 and @xmath231 km  s@xmath1 for the broad emission and lyman absorption , respectively . if these trace the motions of the hot and cool components , respectively , the estimated mass ratio is @xmath232 , being consistent with our assumption of @xmath233 .",
    "the corresponding inclination angle is @xmath234 for our case of @xmath235 and @xmath236 , which is a bit larger than our assumption of @xmath37 .",
    "then , we have examined how the long - term light curve depends on the inclination .",
    "additional four cases of the inclination angle , i.e. , @xmath237 , @xmath238 , @xmath239 , and @xmath240 , are calculated .",
    "the results are also shown in figure [ vmagfit_rxj0513_self_wdm1300_angle ] , which are not so much different in shape from the case of @xmath241 , but the brightness in optical high states decreases by a factor of @xmath242 .",
    "@xcite have reanalyzed the macho data for eight years and determined a new orbital period and a new ephemeris .",
    "they found that the orbital modulations of the optical light curve are different in shape between the optical high and low states .",
    "the orbital modulation dip is much broader in the high state than in the low state .",
    "assuming an inclination angle of @xmath243 , we have calculated two orbital modulations each for the optical high state and for the optical low state as shown in figure [ v_mag_wd13ms26_wind_high_orbital ] .",
    "the observational broad and shallow orbital modulations in the optical high state are reasonably reproduced as well as their full extents ( amplitudes ) of @xmath244 mag . on the other hand ,",
    "the full extents of the orbital modulations become larger ( deeper ) to @xmath245 mag in the optical low state , being consistent with the observation .",
    "a new self - sustained model for the long - term light curve variations of is formulated based on our optically thick wind model of mass - accreting white dwarfs .",
    "we also show that is the first beautiful example of the accretion wind evolution , which is a key evolutionary process to type ia supernovae ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* )    we have already shown that , when the mass accretion rate to a wd exceeds the critical rate @xmath246  yr@xmath1 , optically thick strong winds begin to blow from the wd . as a result",
    ", a formation of common envelope is avoided .",
    "in such a situation , the wd accretes and burns hydrogen atop the wd at the critical rate .",
    "the excess matter transferred to the wd above the critical rate is expelled by winds @xcite .",
    "this is called the accretion wind evolution @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , no such systems have ever been discovered . here , we report that the lmc supersoft x - ray source is the first example of such an object , i.e. , just in the accretion wind evolution .",
    "mass ejection in the accretion wind evolution does occur not continuously but intermittently because the mass transfer is attenuated by strong winds .",
    "the strong winds collide with the secondary and strip off the very surface layer of the secondary . properly formulating this mass stripping effect and the ensuing decay of mass transfer rate , we obtain , in a self - sustained manner , on / off of mass transfer from the companion star . +",
    "a light curve modeling on the 2000 outburst of the recurrent nova showed that the size of the disk around the white dwarf extends widely up to the companion star or over only during the strong wind phase @xcite . including this large extension of a disk in a strong wind phase , we are able to reproduce the transition between the optical high and low states of the lmc supersoft x - ray source : when a strong wind occurs",
    ", the very surface layer of the disk is blown in the wind and the disk expands up to the companion or over .",
    "this large extension of the irradiation area makes a sharp @xmath7 mag rise in the optical light curve .",
    "on the other hand , it drops sharply by a magnitude when the wind stops because the size of the disk returns to its original size . +",
    "in optically thick winds , the mass loss rate rises to @xmath247  yr@xmath1 one day after the wind starts .",
    "this can obscure completely soft x - rays . on the other hand , the wind mass loss rate drops from @xmath248  yr@xmath1 to zero in within a day , which enables a short ( @xmath249 day ) timescale of soft x - ray emergence .",
    "thus , we are also able to reproduce a very rapid emergence / decay of supersoft x - rays in within a day or so .",
    "we abstract two important system parameters .",
    "one is the viscous timescale of the accretion disk , @xmath19 , and the other is the efficiency of mass - stripping by winds , @xmath198 , defined by @xmath250 .",
    "both of them should be determined self - consistently but are not accurately determined at least at the present time like the @xmath92-parameter of @xcite .",
    "we are able to reproduce the optical high / low states for reasonable ranges of the system parameters , i.e. , 20 days @xmath251 60 days and @xmath252 .",
    "the original mass transfer rate from the main - sequence companion is probably constant in time .",
    "even if this original mass transfer rate varies from several times @xmath253  yr@xmath1 to several times @xmath14  yr@xmath1 , by a factor of ten , the duration of optical low states hardly changes , i.e. , stays around @xmath5 days , for a fixed set of @xmath254 . on the other hand ,",
    "the duration of optical high states varies from @xmath5 days to @xmath255 days for the same range of the original mass transfer rate .",
    "these durations of optical high / low states are the prominent features of the macho observations @xcite . + *",
    "the white dwarf photosphere expands and blows a wind during the rapid mass accretion phase .",
    "the photospheric expansion still goes on for a while after the wind suppresses the mass transfer , because the accretion disk supplies mass to the wd for a draining time ( viscous timescale ) .",
    "this makes a bump of @xmath164 mag at the head of the optical high state .",
    "the duration of this bump may determine the value of @xmath19 .",
    "the wd photosphere gradually shrinks after the rapid mass accretion stops .",

    "* comparison of the modeled light curves with the observation implies that the mass of the white dwarf is about @xmath256 , the original mass transfer rate @xmath257  yr@xmath1 , the viscous timescale @xmath258 days , and the efficiency of stripping by winds @xmath228 . + * 8 . *",
    "the on / off timescales of supersoft x - rays are as short as one or two days @xcite .",
