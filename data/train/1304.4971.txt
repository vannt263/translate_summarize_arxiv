    "the microhydrodynamics of deformable entities such as lipid vesicles and red blood cells in flows has received increasing attention experimentally , theoretically , and numerically in recent years .",
    "lipid vesicles ( e.g. , see @xcite-@xcite ) and red blood cells ( e.g. , see @xcite-@xcite ) show phenomenologically similar behaviors in shear flows , which are ( i ) a tank treading rotation with a stationary shape and a finite inclination angle with respect to the flow direction , ( ii ) an unsteady tumbling motion , and ( iii ) vacillating breathing ( the long axis undergoes oscillation about the flow , while the shape shows breathing ) . in @xcite , two motions of oscillation and vacillating breathing of a red blood cell in bounded poiseuille flows have been observed in low reynolds number regime .",
    "the vacillating breathing motion is actually a combination of oscillation and deformation of the cell .",
    "the motion of oscillation of a blood cell in bounded poiseuille flows is more interesting . in @xcite , the motion of an elliptical cylinder particle immersed in an incompressible",
    "newtonian fluid in a narrow channel has been examined numerically in stokes flow regime under the assumption that no external forces or torques act on the elliptical cylinder .",
    "two interesting motions of a particle of elliptic shape are that it either tumbles ( i.e. , keep rotating ) while the mass center always stays away from the centerline or rotates changing itself direction as the mass center crosses the centerline ( oscillating motion ) .",
    "even though the oscillating motion of a particle of elliptic shape is a periodic motion in stokes flow regime , it closely resembles to the one associated with a red blood cell in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we have compared the motions of a neutrally buoyant particle and a red blood cell in poiseuille flow in the low reynolds number regime to understand the oscillating motions in @xcite and to find out the difference between the cell motion and the particle motion in a narrow channel . for the motion of a neutrally buoyant particle of either biconcave or elliptical shape ,",
    "we have obtained similar oscillating motion at the channel central region in poiseuille flow when the particle mass center is placed at the centerline initially ; but such motion is a transition since , later on , the particle migrates away from the centerline and starts tumbling as expected . indeed in bounded poiseuille flows ( e.g. ,",
    "see @xcite-@xcite ) , a neutrally buoyant particle migrates laterally to its equilibrium position between the channel centerline and the wall due to the competition between the shear gradient of the poiseuille flow and the wall effect . for a neutrally buoyant cylinder of elliptical shape , it tumbles while migrating toward and then staying at its equilibrium position ( e.g. , see @xcite ) . concerning the motion of a red blood cell , after the cell migrates to the central region the oscillating motion occurs due to the interaction between the cell and the profile of the poiseuille flow just like an elliptic shape particle in @xcite if the cell can maintain a long body shape . specifically during the oscillating motion for the both cases , both mass centers move up and down in the channel central region .",
    "but unlike the periodic up - and - down motion of the elliptical cylinder mass center in stokes flow in @xcite , the cell oscillating motion damps out while its mass center approaches to an equilibrium height at the central region in a narrow channel and the cell inclination angle approaches to a fixed angle .",
    "for the cases of a neutrally buoyant cylinder of either biconcave shape or elliptical shape in the low reynolds number regime , its mass center moves up and down about the centerline with an increasing amplitude and then moves away from the central region and toward its equilibrium position between the channel centerline and the wall .",
    "thus the up and down motion of the mass center in the channel central region triggers the oscillation motion of a long body entity in poiseuille flows .",
    "the scheme of this paper is as follows : we discuss the models and numerical methods briefly in section 2 . in section 3 , we have investigated the effects of the channel height , the bending rigidity of the membrane , the initial position on the motion of a red blood cell and a neutrally buoyant particle in poiseuille flow in a narrow channel .",

    "the cell has a slipper shape whose mass center is slightly away from the center line as studied in @xcite .",
    "but the one of swelling ratio @xmath58 = 0.9 only has oscillating motion for shorter period of time ( see figure [ 101-umax075-snapshot-45 ] @xmath72 ) and the cell gradually deforms into a parachute shape .",

    "the histories of the height of the cell mass center in figure [ 101-umax075-history-45 ] do show the correlation with the oscillating motion .",
    "the initial inclination angle @xmath68 helps the fluid flow to create the oscillation of the cell mass center and then the flow field , which is about a full quadratic profile , interacting with the long body creates the oscillation similar to the one in @xcite .",
    "but the cell mass center gradually approaches to an equilibrium height due to the interaction between the deformability of the cell and the poiseuille flow and the wall effect as in figure [ 101-umax075-history-45 ] and at the same time the oscillating motion is damping out accordingly as shown by the histories of the inclination angle in figure [ 101-umax075-angle-45 ] .",
    "once the oscillation of the cell mass center damps out , the inclination angle then is fixed as in figures [ 101-umax075-history-45 ] and [ 101-umax075-angle-45 ] .",
    "when increasing the channel height to 20 @xmath67 and keeping the other parameters same , we have focused now on the cases of the bending constant 100@xmath65 . in figure",
    "[ 102-umax075-history-45 ] , the histories show that the oscillation of inclination angle become periodic . these cells with the bending constant 100@xmath65 stay at the channel central region since they are not neutrally buoyant rigid particle and and the deformability plus the poiseuille flow profile keeps them staying in the channel central region .",
    "but the wall effect is weaker in a twice wider channel so that the up and down motion of the mass center does not damps out fast as in the channel of height 10 @xmath67 .",
    "when placing the initial position of the cell mass center off the centerline in a channel of height of 10 @xmath67 , we have obtained almost similar behaviors for both cells in poiseuille flow as shown in figures [ 101-umax075-snapshot ] , [ 101-umax075-history ] and [ 101-umax075-angle ] . the vacillating - breathing behavior for the case of the bending constant 10@xmath65 and the oscillating motion for the case of the bending constant 100@xmath65 are stronger for the cell of @xmath75 since the lateral migration toward the channel central region enhances the oscillation .",
    "but another interesting result is the motion of the cell of @xmath76 for the bending constants 10@xmath65 and 100@xmath65 as shown in figures [ 101-umax075-snapshot ] @xmath72 and @xmath74 .",
    "a similar motion called snaking motion in poiseuille flow has been studied in the stokes regime in @xcite .    concerning the oscillating motion and vacillating - breathing motion in poiseuille flow , the bending constant needs to be large enough with respect to the maximum velocity of the fluid flow @xmath77 so that the cell can not be deformed into a symmetric parachute in the channel central region , but maintain a long body shape to interact with poiseuille flow .",

    "a constant pressure gradient is chosen as in the previous section so that the @xmath78 of the flow without particle is about 0.4167 .",
    "we have first considered the motions of the particle mass center of both shapes initially located at the centerline of the channel with the initial inclination angle @xmath68 . as in figures [ ptk.ctr.y1 ] and [ snapshot.ctr.y1 ]",
    ", both particles show an oscillating motion of the mass center about the channel center .",
    "the up and down motion together with the poiseuille flow velocity profile cause the particles to oscillate in the inclination angle .",
    "as the up and down motion becomes stronger , the oscillation in inclination angle keeps increasing its range . for the particle of biconcave shape",
    ", the oscillation of inclination angle is first between 0 and 90 degrees and then the particle starts to swing back and forth with the inclination angle oscillating between 0 and 180 degrees .",
    "once the particle turns horizontal , it starts a tumbling motion and ends the oscillation of the inclination angle .",
    "the mass center of the tumbling particle migrates toward an equilibrium position between the channel centerline and the wall . the initial inclination angle @xmath68 helps the fluid flow to create the oscillation of the particle mass center as shown in figure [ ang.vs.ycr ] . at the beginning once the mass center is pushing down by the poiseuille flow , the inclination angle is decreasing since the upper portion of the particle close to the centerline moves forward faster than the lower portion away from the centerline does .",
    "the wall effect from the bottom wall slows down the lateral migration and finally push the neutrally buoyant particle away . when it crosses the centerline , the angular velocity changes sign accordingly as in figure [ ang.vs.ycr ] .",
    "the neutrally buoyant particle goes through the same up and down motion with rotation changing its direction accordingly which is similar to the one in the stokes regime in @xcite .",
    "but the neutrally buoyant particle moves up and down about the centerline with increasing amplitude and finally breaks away from the centerline and moves to its equilibrium position between the centerline and the wall as shown in figure [ ptk.ctr.y1 ] .",
    "the elliptic shape particle has a similar motion , but the oscillation of the inclination angle is always a back and forth swing motion before the tumbling motion occurs .",
    "this difference in motion is due to the shape difference of the particles .",
    "the particle of biconcave shape undertakes stronger resistance force from the flow while the flow can smoothly bypass the particle of elliptic shape .",
    "this also explains why it takes the particle of biconcave shape longer time to turn to a tumbling motion than the particle of elliptic shape does .",
    "when increasing the channel height to 20 @xmath67 and keeping the other parameters same , both the up and down motion of the mass center and the rotation of the long body oscillates stronger since the wall effect is weaker in a twice wider channel .",
    "the neutrally buoyant particle of long body shape behaves similarly but they migrate away from the centerline faster than they do in the channel of height 10 @xmath67 .",
    "when the initial mass center is off the centerline , the particle directly turns into a tumbling motion and migrates toward the equilibrium position between the channel centerline and the wall in figure [ ptk.sid.y1 ] . when the particle reaches its equilibrium position , it shows a rotation with periodically varying angular velocity as in @xcite .",
    "the neutrally buoyant particle behavior is entirely different from the cell motion discussed in the previous section due to the lack of the deformability . in figure",
    "[ snapshot.sid.y1 ] , two plots of snapshots of the tumbling motion are shown for each swelling ratio . the first plot is for the first tumbling motion of the particle where as the second plot is the snapshot of one tumbling motion when the particle has reached its equilibrium position . by comparing the time in the first and second plots , one can observe that it takes longer time for the particle to spin a whole circle at the equilibrium position than in the first few spins .",
    "this is because under the parabolic velocity profile , the flow shear rate is higher when the particle is further away from the channel center .",
    "so the angular velocity is larger in the first few spins since the position of the particle is closer to the channel wall .",
    "to further study the effect of the up and down motion about the centerline of the mass center , we have added a constraint on the particle motion so that the particle is only allowed to move freely in the horizontal direction and rotate freely . in figure",
    "[ fix.ang.y1 ] , the inclination angle of the constrained motion of a neutrally buoyant particle reaches to an equilibrium angle without any oscillation when moving along the centerline in the channel .",
    "it shows that the up and down motion of the mass center in the central region of the poiseuille flow causes the oscillation of the inclination angle .",
    "we have compared the oscillating motions of a neutrally buoyant particle and a red blood cell in poiseuille flow in a narrow channel to understand the oscillating motions in @xcite and to find out the difference between the cell motion and the particle motion . for the motion of a neutrally buoyant particle of either biconcave or elliptical shape ,",
    "we have obtained oscillating motion in poiseuille flow when the particle mass center is placed at the centerline initially .",
    "but the neutrally buoyant particle moves up and down about the centerline with the amplitude which is increasing in time and finally breaks away from the centerline and moves to its equilibrium position between the centerline and the wall .",
    "the neutrally buoyant particle behavior is entirely different from the cell motion due to the lack of the deformability .",
    "concerning the cell motion in the central region of the channel , the oscillating motion occurs exactly like a long rigid body as long as the cell mass center moves up and down in the channel central region and the cell can maintain a long body shape .",
    "but when the mass center of the neutrally buoyant particle of a long body shape is not allowed to move up and down , its inclination angle reaches a fixed angle without any oscillation .",
    "thus the up - and - down motion of the mass center in the channel central region triggers the oscillation motion of a long body entity in poiseuille flows .",
