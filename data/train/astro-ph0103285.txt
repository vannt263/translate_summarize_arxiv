    "ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) are known to emit the bulk of their energy in the infrared and their infrared luminosities ( @xmath2 ) are equivalent to the bolometric luminosities of optically selected quasars . for the past decade , there have been extensive studies of the nature of these ulirgs ( sanders & mirabel 1996 ) .",
    "imaging studies at optical and near - infrared wavelengths show that most of these galaxies are either interacting or merging ( sanders et al .",

    "1991 ) to possibly as high as 100% for all 10 nearby ulirgs ( sanders et al . 1988 ) .",
    "the rather small fraction of interacting systems derived by zou et al .",
    "( 1991 ) resulted from the use of poss images in which faint tidal tails are almost impossible to detect .",
    "recent imaging data by kim et al .",
    "( 2001 ) showed that close to 100% of ulirgs in the complete 1 jy sample have faint tidal tails , a signature of recent interaction and merger .",
    "one of the most basic issues of ulirgs is the energy source powering the enormous amount of their infrared radiation .",
    "spectroscopic studies in the optical , near - infrared , and mid - infrared suggest that about 70% and 30% of these galaxies are powered by starburst activities and active galactic nuclei ( agns ) respectively ( veilleux et al .",
    "1999a , veilleux et al",
    ". 1999b , genzel et al .",
    "the huge infrared luminosity of the ulirgs suggests that they contain a large reservoir of molecular gas to provide fuel for the star formation activity and/or a central agn .",
    "extensive searches for co emission have indeed shown that all ulirgs possess a huge amount of molecular gas ( @xmath3 10@xmath0 m@xmath1 ) and that there is a trend of increasing molecular gas content with the far - infrared emission ( downes et al .",
    "1993 , solomon et al .",
    "recent interferometric observations of nearby ulirgs ( downes & solomon 1998 ) and luminous infrared galaxies ( bryant & scoville 1999 ) have determined that the molecular gas is concentrated in a circumnuclear disk of typically 1 kpc in size . from the interferometric observations of double - nucleus ulirgs with projected nuclear separations of 3 - 5",
    "kpc , evans et al .",
    "( 1999 , 2000 ) find that one of the interacting pair contains the majority of molecular gas in warm ulirgs whereas both components contain molecular gas in cool ulirgs .",
    "based on observational evidence , sanders et al .",
    "( 1988 ) proposed that ulirgs originate from the merger of two gas - rich spiral galaxies .",
    "the large amount of molecular gas accumulated in the center of the galaxies due to the gravitational interaction can sustain strong star formation activities as well as provide fuel to the central agn . as the merger proceeds , the molecular gas reservoir is eventually depleted by the star formation ( gao & solomon 1999 ) and dispersed by the agn activities and supernovae .",
    "finally the agn reveals itself as an optical quasar .",
    "the estimated lifetime of the ulirg phase is about 10@xmath4 to 10@xmath5 yr .",
    "genzel et al .",
    "( 1998b ) reviewed most recent observational evidence in favor of this scenario .",
    "numerical simulations of interacting galaxies have shown that violent star formation activity can be triggered in the merger of two massive disk galaxies ( barnes & hernquist 1996 , mihos & hernquist 1996 , springel 2000 ) .",
    "furthermore , star formation activities are found to be dependent mainly on the galaxy structure and the orbital geometry plays only a modest role ( mihos & hernquist 1994 , 1996 ) .",
    "they suggest that galaxies with dense central bulges show strong star formation activities at the final stages of merging , while bulgeless galaxies show weaker star formation activity at the early stage of interacting and do not show any subsequent strong star formation activities .",
    "thus , according to the numerical simulations , the majority of ulirgs would be in the final stages of merger .",
    "recently , kim et al .",
    "( 2001 ) have completed an optical and near - infrared imaging survey of the iras 1 jy sample of ulirgs ( kim & sanders 1998 ) and find that all of the ulirgs show signs of tidal interaction and therefore are in a merging or interacting process ( kim et al . 2001 ) .",
    "more interestingly , we also find that 6 out of 118 ulirgs have projected nuclear separation larger than 20 kpc .",
    "the large nuclear separation observed in these ulirgs seems to contradict the conventional view of the origin of ulirgs and the numerical simulation results outlined above . to become an ulirg in the early phase of interaction ,",
    "the galaxies must have accumulated a large amount of molecular gas and it is still unclear how the star formation activities are triggered in these cases .",
    "+ the position uncertainty associated with the poor resolution of iras in the far - infrared did not allow us to determine the distribution of far - infrared emission as well as the molecular gas in these galaxies . without that information , it is difficult to clarify the nature of these unusual ulirgs . in this paper",

    "co emission and the molecular gas are known to be associated with the source of far - infrared emission .",

    "phase calibration was achieved by observing nearby quasars every 20 to 30 minutes .",
    "we also observed planets to determine the absolute flux scale .",
    "we used the miriad data reduction package ( sault et al .",

    "the 1@xmath16 upper limit to the molecular gas mass of the companion is then derived following the above equation . for the ulirgs with detected co emission ,",
    "the companion may possess a molecular gas content of up to 10% to 20% the molecular gas content of the main component ( table .",
    "the upper limit is in the range of several 10@xmath25 m@xmath1 which implies the companions are not as gas rich as the main component but may possess a molecular gas content comparable to that of normal spiral galaxies .",
    "gaussian fitting to the line profiles gives the fwhm of 200 to 400 km s@xmath8 except for the case of iras f11180@xmath121623 .",
    "the weak co(j=1 - 0 ) emission from iras f11180@xmath121623 did not allow us to determine accurately its linewidth .",

    ", the s component should have a large amount of gas initially or the timescale to collect gas into the nuclear region is very short .",
    "in addition , the presence of a bar - like structure suggests that the molecular gas might be driven to the center of the galaxy under the influence of a non - axisymmetric gravitational potential . however ,",
    "ho et al . (",
    "1997 ) and mulchaey & regan ( 1997 ) found that seyfert and liner galaxies do not show any significant preference for bars . as a result , it s still unclear whether a bar is effective enough to drive the large amount of molecular gas currently found in the s component .",
    "higher resolution observations of co emission lines and radio continuum are needed to better understand the origin of this galaxy .",
    "we have detected co(j=1 - 0 ) emission line in 5 out of 6 widely separated ulirgs selected from the complete 1 jy sample .",
    "the molecular gas mass present in these ulirgs indicates that they are gas - rich .",
    "our high angular resolution observations also reveal the concentration of the molecular gas in only one galaxy of the pair .",
    "optical spectra suggest that galaxy is also the most active in the pair , having either liner or seyfert ii spectral type . using optical and k-band images of the ulirgs , we found evidence in support of the multiple merger scenario for iras f14394 + 5332 .",
    "other systems are likely in the early phase of interaction .",
    "in particular , optical image of iras f23327@xmath122913 reveals that a large amount of molecular gas is concentrated in a spiral - like galaxy with no evidence for strong tidal interaction .",
    "our observation results suggest that the conventional view of ulirg phenomenon as the final phase of the merger of two massive disk galaxies probably does not apply to the widely separated ulirgs .",
    "other mechanisms are needed to explain their origin .",
    "future sensitive and high resolution observations will help to clarify the nature of these unusual ulirgs .",
