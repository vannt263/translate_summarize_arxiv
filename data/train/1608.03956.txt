    "the standard model ( sm ) of particle interactions based upon the gauge symmetry @xmath11 has been tested by numerous experiments .",
    "also the last piece of evidence in favour of the sm has been vindicated with the discovery of the higgs boson at the cern large hadron collider @xcite . yet",
    "the model fails to explain the three glaring physical phenomena : neutrino oscillation @xcite , baryon asymmetry of the universe ( bau ) @xcite , and dark matter ( dm ) @xcite .",
    "although the electroweak part of the sm provides excellent description of weak interaction phenomenology manifesting in @xmath12 structure of neutral and charged currents , it fails to answer why parity violation is exhibited by weak interaction alone . on the fundamental side",
    ", the sm itself can not explain the disparate values of its gauge couplings .",
    "the minimal gauge theory which has the potential to unify the three gauge couplings @xcite and explain the origin of parity violation is @xmath13 grand unified theory ( gut ) @xcite that contains the pati - salam @xcite and left - right gauge theories @xcite as its subgroups . however , it is well known that direct breaking of all non - supersymmetric ( non - susy ) guts @xcite to the sm gauge theory under the assumption of minimal finetuning hypothesis @xcite fails to unify the gauge couplings of the sm whereas supersymmetric guts like @xmath14 @xcite and @xmath13 @xcite achieve this objective in a profound manner .",
    "in fact the prediction of coupling unification in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) @xcite evidenced through the cern - lep data @xcite led to the belief that a susy gut @xcite with its underlying mechanism for solutions to the gauge hierarchy problem @xcite could be the realistic model for high energy physics .",
    "susy guts also predict wino or neutralino as popular candidates of cold dark matter ( cdm ) .",
    "compared to susy @xmath14 @xcite , susy @xmath13 has a number of advantages .",
    "whereas parity violation in so(10 ) has its spontaneous breaking origin , for su(5 ) it is explicit and intrinsic . the right - handed neutrino ( rh@xmath2 ) as a member of spinorial representation @xmath15 of so(10 ) mediates the well known canonical seesaw mechanism @xcite that accounts for small neutrino masses evidenced by the neutrino oscillation data .",
    "further the dirac neutrino mass matrix that occurs as an important ingredient of type - i seesaw is predicted in this model due to its underlying quark - lepton symmetry @xcite .",
    "in addition , the presence of the left - handed ( lh ) triplet scalar , @xmath16 , naturally leads to the possibility of type - ii seesaw formula for neutrino masses @xcite .",
    "both the heavy rh neutrinos and the lh triplet scalar have the high potential to account for bau via leptogenesis @xcite . with r - parity as its gauged discrete symmetry",
    "@xcite the model also guarantees stability of dark matter . in spite of such attractive virtues of susy guts ,",
    "no experimental evidence of supersymmetry has been found so far .",
    "this has led to search for gauge coupling unification of the standard gauge theory in nonsupersymmetric ( non - susy ) guts while sacrificing the elegant solution to the gauge hierarchy problem in favor of fine - tuning to every loop order @xcite . as stated above ,",
    "although single step breakings of all popular non - susy guts including su(5 ) @xcite and so(10 ) @xcite under the constraint of the minimal fine - tuning hypothesis @xcite fail to unify gauge couplings , successful unification has been noted to occur in non - susy so(10 ) with intermediate pati - salam or the left - right gauge groups @xcite .",
    "the issue of dm has been also addressed with high intermediate scale and intrinsic matter parity @xcite and low intermediate scale with external @xmath17 symmetry @xcite .",
    "as there has been no experimental evidence of supersymmetry so far , likewise there has been also no definite evidence of any new gauge boson beyond those of the sm .",
    "this in turn has prompted authors to implement gauge coupling unification with the sm gauge symmetry below the gut scale @xcite by the introduction of additional particle degrees of freedom with lighter masses .",
    "a natural question in this context is how much of the advantages of the susy gut paradigm is maintained in the case of non - susy gauge coupling unification program . while susy so(10 )",
    "is well known for its intrinsic r - parity @xcite as gauged discrete symmetry @xcite for the stability of dark matter , as an encouraging factor in favour of the non - susy gut , it has been shown recently @xcite that matter parity defined as @xmath18 could be the corresponding discrete symmetry intrinsic to non - susy so(10 ) where @xmath19 stands for baryon ( lepton ) number . whereas neutralino or wino are predicted as dark matter candidates in susy guts , in non susy so(10 ) the dm candidates could be non - standard fermions ( scalars ) carrying even ( odd ) matter parity .",
    "in fact all so(10 ) representations have been identified to carry definite values of matter parity which makes the identification of a dark matter candidate transparent from among the non - standard scalar(fermion ) representations .",
    "thus , there is enough scope within non - susy so(10 ) to implement the dm paradigm along with an intrinsic stabilising symmetry .",
    "compared to susy guts , the non - susy guts do not have the problems associated with the higgsino mediated proton decay @xcite , and the canonical proton decay mode @xmath20 has been the hall mark of predictions of non - susy guts over more than four decades .",
    "the non susy gut also does not suffer from the well known gravitino problem.@xcite .",
    "coupling unification in the single step breaking of non - susy so(10 ) has been addressed in an interesting paper by frigerio and hambye ( fh ) @xcite by exploiting the intrinsic matter parity of so(10 ) leading to triplet fermion in @xmath4 as dark matter candidate .",
    "the presence of a color octet fermion of mass @xmath21 gev has been also noted for unification . the proton - lifetime has been predicted in this model at two - loop level of gauge coupling unification . however details of fitting the neutrino oscillation data including derivation of dirac neutrino mass matrix and the rh@xmath2-mass spectrum have not been addressed .",
    "likewise related details of derivation of the baryon asymmetry of the universe via leptogenesis has been left out from the purview of discussion .",
    "an added attractive aspect of the model is discussion of various methods , both renormalizable and non - renormalizable , by which the triplet fermionic dm can have tev scale mass .",
    "although proton lifetime has been predicted from the two - loop determination of the gut scale , important modification due to threshold effects that could arise from the superheavy components of various representations need further investigation .",
    "gauge coupling unification in a non - susy su(5 ) gut has been implemented in the one - step breaking scenario including triplet fermion dm @xcite . a color octet fermion with mass @xmath22  gev",
    "which is also needed for unification has been suggested as a source of non - thermal dm via non - renormalizable interactions .",
    "as the model does not use matter parity , the stabilising discrete symmetry has to be imposed externally and appended to the gut framework .",
    "further the issues like neutrino masses and mixings , and the baryon asymmetry of the universe have not been addressed in this model .",
    "naturally the non - susy su(5 ) model has no explanation for the monopoly of parity violation in weak interaction alone .",
    "the contents of the present paper are substantially different from earlier works in many respects . we have discussed the matching with the neutrino oscillation data in detail where , instead of type - i seesaw , we have used hybrid seesaw which is a combination of type - i and type - ii @xcite . both of the seesaw mechanisms",
    "are naturally predicted in matter parity based so(10 ) model having their origins rooted in the higgs representation @xmath1 and the latter s coupling to the fermions in the spinorial representation @xmath15 through @xmath23 . unlike a number of neutrino mass models adopted earlier , in this work we have not assumed dominance of any one of the two seesaw mechanisms over the other . for the purpose of the present work we have determined the dirac neutrino mass matrix at the gut scale by fitting the extrapolated values of charged fermion masses @xcite . with a view to investigating basis dependence of leptogenesis , the dirac neutrino mass estimation has been carried out in two ways : by using the @xmath24-quark diagonal basis as well as the @xmath25-quark diagonal basis .",
    "using these in the hybrid seesaw formula which is quadratic in the majorana coupling @xmath26 gives two distinct patterns of mass eigen values for the heavy rh@xmath2s masses : ( i)compact scenario where all masses are heavier than the davidson - ibarra ( di ) bound , and ( ii ) the hierarchical scenario where only the lightest @xmath27 mass is below the di bound .",
    "thus each of these sets of rh neutrino masses corresponds to two types of dirac neutrino mass matrices or yukawa couplings which play crucial roles in the determination of cp - asymmetry resulting from rh@xmath2 decays .",
    "we have carried out a complete flavor analysis in determining the cp asymmetries .",
    "we have also exploited solutions of boltzmann equations in every case to arrive at the predicted results on baryon asymmetry .",
    "successful ansatz for baryogenesis via leptogenesis is shown to emerge for each pattern of rh@xmath2 masses . with the compact pattern of rh@xmath2 mass spectrum , this occurs when the dirac neutrino masses are determined in the @xmath24-quak or the @xmath25-quark diagonal basis .",
    "however in the hierarchical scenario of rh@xmath2 masses , the dominant cp asymmetry that survives the washout due to @xmath27-decay and contributes to the desired baryon asymmetry is generated by the decay of the second generation rh@xmath2 where the dirac neutrino mass corresponds to the @xmath24-quark diagonal basis .",
    "because of the heavier mass of the lh triplet scalar , although its direct decay to two leptons @xcite gives negligible contribution to the generated cp - asymmetry , the additional vertex correction generated by its mediation to the rh@xmath2 decay is found to lead to a cp - asymmetry component comparable to other dominant contributions .",
    "thus , the same heavy triplet scalar @xmath28 and the rh@xmath2s which drive the hybrid seesaw formula for neutrino masses and mixings are shown to generate the leptonic @xmath29 asymmetry leading to the experimentally observed value for the baryon asymmetry of the universe over a wide range of the parameter space in the model . + as per the suggestion @xcite and its embedding in so(10 ) @xcite , we exploit the triplet fermionic dm at the tev scale originating from the non - standard fermionic representation @xmath30 . having exploited the triplet fermionic dm @xmath31 and the lh triplet higgs scalar @xmath32 for hybrid seesaw for neutrino masses and leptogenesis , we justify the presence of these light degrees of freedom as ingredients for coupling unification through their non - trivial contribution to the @xmath33 gauge coupling evolutions .",
    "in addition , we need lighter scalar or fermionic octets with mass @xmath34 gev under @xmath35 to complete the precision gauge coupling unification .    the degrees of freedom used in this model having their origins from so(10 ) representations @xmath36 and @xmath4 , are expected to contribute substantially to gut threshold effects on the unification scale through their superheavy components even without resorting to make the superheavy gauge boson masses nondegenerate as has been adopted in a number of earlier works for proton stability .",
    "it is important to note that if we accept the stabilising symmetry for dm to be matter parity , then the participation of @xmath37 so(10 ) in its spontaneous symmetry breaking is inevitable .",
    "this in turn dictates a dominant contribution to threshold effects on proton lifetime which has been ignored earlier but estimated in this direct breaking chain for the first time .",
    "in addition the superheavy fermions in @xmath4 have been noted to contribute substantially .",
    "a possibility of partial cancellation of scalar and fermionic threshold effects is also pointed out .",
    "although it is challenging to rule out the present model by proton decay experiments , the predicted proton lifetime in this model for the @xmath20 is found to be within the accessible range of the ongoing search limits @xcite for a wider range of the parameter space .",
    "this paper is planned in the following manner . in sec.[sec : mnu ] we discuss successful fit to the neutrino oscillation data where we estimate the lh higgs triplet and the rh@xmath2 masses . in sec.[sec",

    "in this section we address the issue of fitting the neutrino masses and mixings as determined from the neutrino oscillation data by the hybrid seesaw formula .",
    "we then infer on the masses of heavy left - handed triplet and rh neutrinos necessary for leptogenesis .",
    "+ after so(10 ) breaking , the relevant part of the lagrangian under sm symmetry is @xmath38 the first term on the right - hand side ( rhs ) of eq.([yukhiggs ] ) is from the so(10 ) symmetric yukawa term @xmath39 whereas the second and the third terms are from @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "also we have defined @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "although the associated rh scalar field @xmath43 has the respective quantum number under the lr gauge group @xmath44 , it is the singlet component @xmath45 under the sm that acquires the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) @xmath46 .",

    "@xmath51 is the quartic coupling of the so(10 ) invariant lagrangian resulting from the combination of @xmath52 and @xmath53 : @xmath54 .",
    "the higgs triplet mass - squared term has its origin from @xmath55 .",
    "other notations are self explanatory .",
    "the hybrid formula for the light neutrino mass matrix is the sum of type - i and type - ii seesaw contributions @xcite @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the induced vev of triplet scalar @xmath28 , and @xmath58 .",
    "there is the well known standard ansatz to fit fermion masses in so(10 ) along the line of @xcite . to estimate the dirac mass matrix in this work we have carried out one - loop renormalization group evolution of yukawa couplings in the bottom - up approach using pdg values of all charged fermion masses . at the electroweak scale @xmath59 , using experimental data on charged fermion masses we choose up - quark or down - quark mass diagonal bases in two different scenarios .",
    "we then evolve them upto the gut scale @xmath60 using bottom - up approach @xcite . at this scale",
    "we assume equality of the up - quark and the dirac neutrino mass matrices , @xmath61 , which holds upto a very good approximation in so(10 ) due to its underlying quark - lepton symmetry : we further assumed that @xmath62 for all @xmath63 .",
    "we could have done better to estimate the dirac mass matrix at the electroweak scale by following the top down apperoach but since it does not get appreciable correction due to absence of the strong gauge coupling @xmath64 @xcite , this approximation does not influence our final result substantially .",
    "another reason is that for leptogenesis we need dirac neutrino yukawa couplings at intermediate scales , @xmath65 gev where the renormalisation group ( rg ) running effects are expected to be smaller in the top - down approach .    in the down quark diagonal basis",
    "we have at @xmath59 under the assumption of negligible rg effects @xmath66 we repeat the above procedure in the up - quark diagonal basis at @xmath67 instead of the down quark diagonal basis leading to @xmath68 the above values are used in the second term of the right - hand side ( rhs ) eq.([eq : nu_mass ] ) where in the left - hand side ( lhs ) we use the value of light neutrino mass matrix for the nh case with @xmath69ev and the best fit values for other parameters @xcite .",
    "we have also assumed that throughout the evolution majorana phases are zero at all mass scales .",
    "we then search for solutions for the majorana coupling @xmath26 or , equivalently the values of rh neutrino masses .",
    "due to strongly hierarchical structure of @xmath70 matrix , it is impractical to assume the dominance of the type - i or the type - ii term in the hybrid seesaw formula of eq.([eq : nu_mass ] ) . since eq.([eq : nu_mass ] ) is quadratic in @xmath26 , it has two solutions for every eigenvalue and thus giving total @xmath71 plausible solutions @xcite .",
    "but , for a given @xmath70 and @xmath72 there should be only two distinct positive definite solutions .",

    "a robust iterative numerical estimation of @xmath26 matrix is performed to match the oscillation data .",

    "note that the rh@xmath2 masses increase with decrease in @xmath51 for compact scenario while it almost stays unaffected in hierarchical scenario .",

    "therefore , we have presented only one set of solutions for the rh@xmath2 masses in fig.[fig : hcmass ] .",
    "it is quite encouraging to note that despite the gut scale value of @xmath91 , the type - ii term does not upset the type - i seesaw term in the hybrid formula , rather both of them contribute significantly to the light neutrino mass matrix .",

    "leptogenesis is discussed in various papers @xcite .",
    "the flavor independent @xcite calculation of asymmetry is applicable at high temperatures when all the charged lepton mediated interactions are out of equilibrium i.e. @xmath92gev .",
    "flavor dependent analysis becomes necessary for leptogenesis at lower temperatures . in hierarchical scenarios we have @xmath93gev which violates the davidson - ibarra bound @xcite badly ,",

    "we have exploited an interesting breaking pattern of non - susy so(10 ) by assigning gut scale vev to the representation @xmath1 where matter parity is conserved as a natural gauged discete symmetry of the sm that guarantees dark matter stability . as the origin of dark matter candidates , the model classifies non - standard fermionic or scalar representations of non - susy so(10 ) carrying even or odd matter parity containing suitable components of dark matter .",
    "it predicts the type - i @xmath416 type - ii as the hybrid seesaw formula for neutrino masses driven by lh scalar triplet @xmath417 and heavy rh neutrinos .",
    "this formula has been used here to fit the neutrino oscillation data that predicts the heavy masses of the scalar triplet and the rh@xmath2 masses .",
    "we have carried out this fitting procedure using values of the dirac neutrino mass matrix derived in two ways by assuming @xmath24-quark diagonal or the @xmath25-quark diagonal bases . for a given intermediate mass value of the scalar triplet , induced vev , and dirac neutrino mass matrix , this seesaw formula being quadratic in majorana neutrino yukawa coupling @xmath26 ,",

    "these solutions provide a variety of results on the surviving lepton asymmetries after washout factors are adequately taken into account .",
    "we have carried out a complete flavor analysis of the rh@xmath2 decays and exploited solutions to boltzman equations in every case to arrive at the model predictions on the baryon asymmetry .",
    "although the decay of the lh scalar triplet in this model is found to yield negligible cp - asymmetry , it contributes quite significantly through the new feynman diagram it generates for the vertex correction of rh@xmath2 decays .",
    "in fact this contribution to the cp - asymmetry is found to be as dominant as other contributions without triplet mediation .",
    "the decay of the lightest rh@xmath2 in the compact scenario predicts the values of bau in agreement with the existing data when the dirac neutrino mass determination is associated with either the @xmath24-quark diagonal basis or the @xmath25-quark diagonal basis . in the hierarchical scenario the right value of bau",
    "is predicted by the @xmath95 decay where the dirac neutrino mass is associated with the @xmath24-quark diagonal basis .",
    "+ with the matter parity available as the stabilising discrete symmetry for dark matter , the neutral component of hyperchargeless triplet fermion @xmath418 having even matter parity is well accommodated as a candidate for thermal dark matter at tev scale whose phenomenology has been discussed extensively in the literature and summarized here .",
    "having thus addressed solutions to the three outstanding problems of the sm as stated above , we implemented unification of the three gauge couplings which needed a fermionic color octet of mass @xmath352 gev , in addition to the heavy higgs scalar triplet , and the fermionic triplet dark matter .",
    "the two - loop solutions yielded excellent unification with the predicted gut scale value @xmath419 gev where the small positive fraction in the exponent is due to degenerate masses of all superheavy gauge bosons at @xmath368 that causes nearly @xmath420 increase in the proton lifetime prediction over its two - loop prediction . noting the compelling requirement of the scalar representation @xmath1 to drive the symmetry breaking in this so(10 ) model , its superheavy components predict substantial gut threshold effects on the unification scale and proton lifetime .",
    "we have also estimated threshold corrections on the predicted proton lifetime due to superheavy fermions in @xmath4 .",
    "an interesting possibility of cancelling out a substantial part of threshold corrections due to scalars by fermions has been pointed out .",
    "we find that a large region of the parameter space can be explored by the ongoing searches on proton decay @xmath20 .",
    "in conclusion we find that in the non - supersymmetric standard gauge theory , the predictions for neutrino masses , dark matter , baryon asymmetry of the universe , unification of gauge couplings , and proton lifetime accessible to ongoing searches can be successfully implemented through direct breaking of non - susy so(10 ) with particle content inherent to matter parity conservation .",
    "the only additional particle needed beyond these requirements for coupling unification is a color octet weyl fermion ( or a pair of complex color octet scalars ) which also belong to the so(10 ) gut representation .",
    "the introduction of the scalar triplet @xmath28 at the intermediate scale brought in naturally by matter parity conservation in so(10 ) causes remarkable changes in the model predictions over its conventional values .",
    "in the appendix a below we provide various decompositions of so(10 ) representations under different subgroups relevant for the present work . in appendix b we give different beta function coefficients along with particle content for different mass scales .      in this appendix we present decompositions of non - susy so(10 ) representations under su(5 ) as shown in table [ tab : decomp ] .",

    "<S> we discuss gauge coupling unification of @xmath0 descending directly from non - supersymmetric so(10 ) while providing solutions to the three outstanding problems of the standard model : neutrino masses , dark matter , and the baryon asymmetry of the universe . </S>",
    "<S> conservation of matter parity as gauged discrete symmetry for the stability and identification of dark matter in the model calls for high - scale spontaneous symmetry breaking through @xmath1 higgs representation . </S>",
    "<S> this naturally leads to the hybrid seesaw formula for neutrino masses mediated by heavy scalar triplet and right - handed neutrinos . </S>",
    "<S> being quadratic in the majorana coupling , the seesaw formula predicts two distinct patterns of rh@xmath2 masses , one hierarchical and another not so hierarchical ( or compact ) , when fitted with the neutrino oscillation data . </S>",
    "<S> predictions of the baryon asymmetry via leptogenesis are investigated through the decays of both the patterns of rh@xmath2 masses . </S>",
    "<S> a complete flavor analysis has been carried out to compute cp - asymmetries including washouts and solutions to boltzmann equations have been utilised to predict the baryon asymmetry . the additional contribution to vertex correction mediated by the heavy left - handed triplet scalar </S>",
    "<S> is noted to contribute as dominantly as other feynman diagrams . </S>",
    "<S> we have found successful predictions of the baryon asymmetry for both the patterns of rh@xmath2 masses . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath3 triplet fermionic dark matter at the tev scale carrying even matter parity is naturally embedded into the non - standard fermionic representation @xmath4 of so(10 ) . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the triplet scalar and the triplet fermion , the model needs a nonstandard color octet fermion of mass @xmath5 gev to achieve precision gauge coupling unification at the gut mass scale @xmath6 gev . </S>",
    "<S> threshold corrections due to superheavy components of @xmath1 and other representations are estimated and found to be substantial . </S>",
    "<S> it is noted that the proton life time predicted by the model is accessible to the ongoing and planned experiments over a wide range of parameter space .    </S>",
