    "the scattering quantum walk , introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , is a quantum walk on the edges of a graph rather than on its vertices . having a graph @xmath1 on which the walk is defined , with @xmath2 being the set of vertices and",
    "@xmath3 the set of edges , the hilbert space is defined as @xmath4 this definition states that the hilbert space is given by the span of all _ edge states _ ,",
    "i.e. , position states @xmath5 interpreted as a particle going from vertex @xmath6 to vertex @xmath7 , with @xmath8 being an edge of graph @xmath9 .",
    "these edge states form an orthonormal basis of the hilbert space , which we shall call _ the canonical basis . _    in this hilbert space the unitary evolution is given by a set of _ local unitary evolutions _ defined for each vertex . if we set ( for every @xmath6 ) @xmath10 , the set of all edge states originating on vertex @xmath11 , and @xmath12 , the set of all edge states ending on vertex @xmath11 , then local unitary evolutions act as @xmath13 .",
    "the overall unitary step operator @xmath14 acting on the system is the combined action of the local unitary evolutions , that is , the restriction of @xmath14 to @xmath15 is just @xmath16 . given the initial state of the system is @xmath17 , the state after @xmath18 steps is @xmath19 and the probability of finding the particle ( walker ) in state @xmath20 is then @xmath21 .    finally , let us specify our choice of local unitary step operators .",

    "the local unitary operators corresponding to both the normal and special vertices will act as follows : @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are reflection and transmission coefficients to be chosen in such a way that @xmath30 is unitary . for normal vertices @xmath31 and for special vertices ,",
    "we choose @xmath32 here @xmath33 is the degree of vertex @xmath22 , i.e. , the number of vertices in the set @xmath23 . for both of these choices ,",
    "the operator @xmath30 is unitary , and , as we shall see , they also guarantee that the quantum walk has the same symmetry group as the graph .",
    "this choice of local unitary operators for the scattering walk is analogous to the choice of the grover coin ( see ref .",

    "what we would like to do in this section , is provide a connection between this phrasing of a search problem and a search whose object is to find a set of special vertices on a graph .",
    "we shall accomplish this by showing how an oracle can be used in a quantum circuit to implement a quantum search on a graph .",
    "our oracle has the action @xmath38 where @xmath26 is the input and @xmath39 is the function that determines the action of the oracle .",

    "the second system ( ancilla ) is , therefore , a qubit , and @xmath41 is addition modulo @xmath42 .",

    "[ fig : circuit ] is one of the vertex states , which , besides labeling a particular vertex , will also serve as a reference state .",
    "first , we apply the operator @xmath60 which maps the state @xmath61 in @xmath62 to @xmath63 .",
    "such a unitary can be implemented , e.g.  as presented in refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein . after",
    "this operator is applied , the initial state becomes @xmath64 next , we apply the quantum oracle given by eq .",

    "that is the task of the remaining two gates in the circuit .",
    "now , because the local unitary operator @xmath67 acts only on the edge space , the state can be rewritten as @xmath68 application of the quantum oracle again resets the qubit state to @xmath59 .",
    "however , to reset the vertex state , we can not use @xmath60 operation as before , since the information contained in the edge state about the vertex state has moved from the second to the first slot . therefore , we define the operator @xmath69 , which maps @xmath70 in @xmath62 to @xmath71 , and apply it to our state , giving @xmath72 we have thus performed one step of the walk and reset the ancillas , so that the circuit can be applied again to perform additional steps of the walk .",

    "we shall also assume that each @xmath84 does not contain any smaller invariant subspaces @xmath11 .",
    "next , in each invariant subspace we can form a vector that is the sum of all of the canonical basis elements in the subspace , @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the dimension of @xmath84 .",

    "correspondingly , if the initial state of the walk is in @xmath93 , then we only need to consider states in @xmath93 to describe the state of the walk at any time .",

    "in particular , the following two states are eigenstates of @xmath14 with the eigenvalue equal to unity : @xmath134 this , however , means that the walk goes nowhere ; the particle remains in the initial state for the entire walk . in this case",
    ", the quantum walk gives us no advantage over a classical search .",
    "classical searches on edges are discussed in appendix a.    the value of @xmath135 is much more interesting . the state of the walk after @xmath18 steps , derived by using the formula @xmath136 where @xmath137 is the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue @xmath138 of unitary operator @xmath14 , is , in the limit @xmath139 , @xmath140 where @xmath141 we see that the probability amplitudes for edge states not connected to special vertices are approximately equal to zero when @xmath142 .",
    "if we measure the position of the particle after this many steps , it will , with probability close to unity , be located on an edge connected to one of the special vertices .",

    "if we were given only one chance to measure , we would have to wait until the probability of finding a particle on one of the edges connected to the special vertex reaches its maximum .",
    "however , if we are able to repeat the experiment an arbitrary number of times , we may , after an unsuccessful search , do the experiment again . in that case , the optimal number of steps before measuring is different  it is the number of steps , for which the _ average number of steps _ is minimal .",

    "in this case @xmath209 when @xmath210 , the probability of finding the particle on an edge connected to the special vertex in the set 1 is @xmath211 and the probability of being on an edge connected to the special vertex in the set @xmath42 is @xmath212 .",

    "for example , if they are all in the set @xmath37 , then @xmath221 , and we see from eq .",
    "( [ bipartitestepnum ] ) that the number of steps that concentrates the probability on edges connected to special vertices is @xmath222 , which does not depend on the number of vertices in the set @xmath42 . therefore",
    ", if the special vertices are only in one set , the size of the other set does not affect the number of steps necessary to find a special vertex .      as a generalization of previous cases we may consider an @xmath0-partite complete graph consisting of @xmath0 sets of @xmath112 vertices .",
    "vertices within sets are not connected while for any pair of vertices not belonging to the same set there exists an edge connecting them ( see fig .  [",

    "we see that by taking @xmath223 we obtain the bipartite graph discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : bipartite ] .",

    "[ fig : mpartite ] ) .",
    "we will label the vertices by @xmath224 , where @xmath225 is the number labeling a group ( set ) , and @xmath18 is the number labeling vertices within the group .",

    "there are several papers ( to the authors knowledge ) that have also studied searches on graphs .",

    "there an algorithm for finding the ( only one ) special vertex with a probability of approximately @xmath238 was presented , which is in contrast with our finding of a probability close to unity . in our case",
    "the probability is ( almost ) equally split between two possible sets of edge states , those _ leaving _ the special vertex and those _ entering _ the special vertex . in the case of ref .",
    "@xcite , this corresponds to either finding the particle on the special vertex ( with an arbitrary coin state ) or finding it on one of the neighboring vertices with the coin pointing to the special one .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite discard the latter type of states as an unsuccessful search .",
    "similar findings are given in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite a quantum walk that performs an exact grover search is discussed .",
    "the graph the quantum walk is performed on is a complete graph that has loops added to each vertex .",
    "coins ( equivalents of our local unitary evolutions ) for normal vertices are grover coins .",
    "however , coins for the special vertices are `` minus '' grover coins .",
    "this leads to almost the same evolution as in the case of a grover search ; the only difference is that one step of the grover algorithm corresponds to two steps of the quantum walk .",
    "finally , let us summarize the situation as it presently stands .",
    "quantum - walk searches have two figures of merit , the number of steps necessary to find a special vertex and the probability of finding it after a specific number of steps have been made . on a complete graph without loops [ the result obtained in this paper in eq .",
    "( [ eq : result ] ) ] one needs @xmath239-times as many steps as in the grover search for the corresponding problem ( a search on @xmath112 objects ) , and after this many number of steps the probability of finding the special vertex is equal to unity . on a complete graph with loops @xcite , twice as many steps as in the corresponding grover search are required , and the probability of finding the special vertex is again equal to unity",
    ". a rigorous comparison of these properties on a hypercube can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite , where adding loops to the graph incurs the cost of increasing the number of steps in the walk .",
    "we have considered scattering - quantum - walk searches on several examples of highly symmetric ( complete , bipartite , and @xmath0-partite ) graphs where some of the vertices are special .",
    "we have shown how an oracle in a quantum circuit can be used to mark these special vertices .",
    "the symmetry of these graphs leads to a significant reduction in the dimensionality of the problem . for all of the types of graphs we considered",
    ", we found a quadratic speedup over a classical search .",
    "these results were obtained by taking the phase shift of special vertices to be @xmath147 .",
    "taking @xmath133 results in a trivial evolution , with constant probabilities of finding the particle in any edge state . in this case",
    "quantum walks reduce to the classical blind search on edges .",
    "that is , the quantum search is reduced to its classical counterpart .",
    "we have also studied the change in behavior when changing the phase shift @xmath156 for a complete graph with one special vertex .",
    "while for @xmath135 we have a nontrivial behavior suitable for searches in these graphs , for @xmath133 we get only a static walk .",
    "cases between these values were explored numerically . as a measure for suitable comparison between different choices of @xmath156 , we chose the average number of steps that need to be taken to successfully find the special vertex .",
    "we note that the quantum algorithm is always at least as fast as its classical counterpart .",
    "finally , we have made comparisons of our results with other works , putting this work into perspective .",
    "it is hoped that the approach used here makes the evaluation of these cases easier and more simple to interpret .",
    "our work has been supported by projects the qap project no .",

    "when employing quantum oracles in searches for an element in an unstructured database , the classical search may be viewed as a quantum query not capable of using superpositions . in this way one may consider two types of classical searches  blind searches and searches with a memory .",
    "we present both types of search below .",
    "classical _ blind searches _ are searches where previously chosen elements are not marked , so that they may be picked up again .",
    "this means that the probability @xmath149 of choosing a special element remains the same after every unsuccessful step of the search .",
    "the probability of finding a special element after @xmath26 steps , hence , is @xmath240 which is the probability of not finding the element in @xmath241 steps and finding it at the @xmath26-th step .",
    "the average number of steps we need to take in order to find a marked element is expressed as usual : @xmath242 in the case when the oracle function marks @xmath100 vertices out of @xmath112 , we have @xmath243 so that @xmath244      let us suppose that we mark previously chosen elements , and do not choose them again in subsequent steps during the search .",
    "the probabilities @xmath245 of finding a marked element now change for each new element chosen : @xmath246\\cdot\\frac{v}{n - k+1 } \\\\",

    "the explicit expressions for the vectors @xmath251 ,  , @xmath252 read @xmath253 the actions of @xmath14 on these vectors are @xmath254^{1/2 } |w_{5}\\rangle \\nonumber , \\\\",
