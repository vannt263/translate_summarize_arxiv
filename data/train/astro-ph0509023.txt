    "the simultaneous optical and x - ray ( rxte - asm ) emission does not show any correlation @xcite .    the kva telescope ( kungliga vetenskapsakademien , royal swedish academy of sciences ) is located on roque de los muchachos , la palma ( canary islands ) , and operated by the tuorla observatory , finland ( ` http://www.astro.utu.fi ` ) .",

    "the kva telescope is composed of a 0.6 m f/15 cassegrain devoted to polarimetry , and a 0.35 m f/11 sct auxiliary telescope for multicolour photometry .",

    "this telescope has been successfully operated in remote way ( mainly from finland ) through internet connection since autumn 2003 .",

    "a preview of the data is available at ` http://users.utu.fi/kani/1m/ ` .",
    "for the first time , a so low - declination blazar like pks 2155 - 304 was observed with the kva .",
    "a total of 440 @xmath7-band photometric data points were obtained in 13 nights ( @xmath9 frames per night on average ) during august 3 ",

    "was observed during sep .",
    "a preliminary inspection on the 13 intranight light curves does not show any relevant signature of intraday variability , but a more detailed data analysis in under way . since the galactic latitude of pks 2155 - 304 is high ( @xmath11 ) ,",
    "interstellar polarization along line of sight is negligible . the relatively high level of optical polarization recorded during sep .",
    "9 - 10 might provide a signature of the synchrotron nature of this flare .",
    "the kva observations described above were also a useful preparatory run for the optical follow - up of planned magic observations of pks 2155 - 304 at large zenith - angles .",
    "magic should be able to derive a proper @xmath0-ray spectrum above 500 gev for it , and the spectral cutoff due to the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) absorption , with moderate pointing time and reduced systematic effects @xcite .",
    "pks 2155 - 304 represents also an optimal target for simultaneous observations by magic and hess .",
    "in fact possible collaboration observations could provide a larger and well defined energy spectrum of the source , an increased statistics and a cross - calibration of the two detectors .",
