    "traditionally , the focus of wireless cellular networks has been on the downlink ( dl ) traffic due to its higher volume compared to the uplink ( ul ) traffic .",
    "recent developments show a clear trend in the increase of the ul traffic due to new mobile applications , such as social networks , cloud backup storage , video chatting etc . , as well as the explosive growth of machine - to - machine ( m2 m ) connections .",
    "m2 m traffic is dominated by ul traffic as the m2 m devices sense and monitor and thereby generate the data to send @xcite .",
    "m2 m traffic will represent an important segment in the upcoming 5 g wireless systems .",
    "one of the new features in 5 g systems is the possibility to offer ultra - reliable connections .",
    "this will bring a new quality in the support of m2 m traffic , as services can be built under the assumption that the m2 m device will be able to deliver its data with very high reliability .",
    "there are multiple ways to improve the reliability of ul transmissions , such as using higher transmission power or antenna diversity . on the other hand",
    ", the trend of dense deployment  @xcite of small - cell base stations ( sbss ) in heterogeneous networks brings the infrastructure close to the terminals and brings the possibility to improve the ul transmission by careful cell association .",
    "the works  @xcite show that , due to the difference in the dl / ul power , it is beneficial to dl / ul decoupled access ( dude ) , such that the terminal receives from one bs , but transmits to another one .",
    "dude can be understood as the use of selection macro - diversity .    in this letter",
    "we use the fact that multiple densely deployed sbss can be in the proximity of the terminal , such that the terminal can be simultaneously associated with two or more bss in the ul and its ul packets are transmitted to all of them . specifically",
    ", we treat the basic variant of _ double association _ , depicted on fig .",
    "[ f : double_assoc_example ] , in which a terminal is associated with one macro - cell bs ( mbs ) and one sbs .",
    "clearly , the ul broadcast improves the reliability compared to the dude and single - point ul association .",
    "note that dual connectivity has already been considered in the release 12 of lte  @xcite with the main purpose to improve downlink connectivity ; however , each individual connection is put at a different frequency , i.e. a single transmission is not received by more than one access points . in @xcite , the authors also consider the joint reception of the uplink signal where the uplink transmission of a user is received by more than one node . however , the results are largely based on simulations .",
    "the results in this letter show that double association can lead to significant improvement in reliability , expressed through the probability of successful reception .",
    "the performance of the double association is analyzed by using stochastic geometry @xcite for the distribution of the terminals , mbss and sbss .",
    "we treat the scenario of a wireless heterogeneous network , composed of mbss and sbss , where each active user has an uplink ( ul ) transmission .",
    "the downlink ( dl ) transmission takes place in a time - frequency resource that is orthogonal to the one used for ul .",
    "we assume that the mbss and the sbss are randomly located according to the 2-dimensional homogeneous poisson point processes ( ppp ) @xmath0 and @xmath1 with node densities @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "the connection between the user and the mbs is assumed to use ofdma - like orthogonal multiple access scheme , such that there is only one user per mbs using the same resource . to model this ,",
    "the total area is considered as a voronoi diagram , with the mbss being the seeds of the diagram , such that each mbs defines one voronoi cell . in each voronoi cell one active ul user",
    "is deployed in a uniform random way across the cell area .",
    "hence , the density of active ul users is also @xmath2 ; however , the users are not generated by a poisson point process , unlike the mbss and sbss .",
    "the distribution of users is a poisson - voronoi perturbed lattice @xcite which is hard to analyze , but in order to make our analysis tractable , we will approximate it with a ppp with intensity @xmath2 .",
    "the tractability and accuracy of this approach has been demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "the _ typical mbs _ is placed at the origin and the nearest user to the origin is the associated user .",
    "the nearest sbs to the user associated with the typical mbs is considered as the _ typical sbs_. all performance figures are calculated for these two typical access points .    the double association is specified as follows . the @xmath4th user associates with the mbs @xmath5 deployed in the @xmath4th voronoi cell .",
    "additionally , the @xmath4th user s transmission can reach the sbs @xmath6 from which it receives the highest average power , i.e. the sbs that is closest geometrically : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the distance between the @xmath4th active user and @xmath9th sbs",
    ". the mbs acts as a primary access point , but the user transmission is simultaneously received by the mbs and the sbs .",
    "this scheme can be generalized to @xmath10 associations by having @xmath11 additional associations to the @xmath11 nearest sbss , i.e. each user transmission has @xmath11 additional degrees of diversity .",
    "all ul transmissions use the same spectrum and interfere with each other .",
    "the effects of path loss and fading are compensated by fractional power control ( fpc ) @xcite .",
    "the received signal strength at @xmath12 from the @xmath4th active user is : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the distance between the @xmath4th active user and @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the path - loss coefficient and @xmath17 is an exponential random variable with unit mean in order to model the rayleigh fading on the link .",
    "the time is slotted and the channel gain @xmath17 is invariant in a slot .",
    "the transmit power is the minimum value between the maximum transmit power level constraint @xmath18 and the power control component @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is default transmit power level and @xmath21 is a power control factor ( pcf ) that can have values @xmath22 . for @xmath23 ,",
    "no power control is applied , while @xmath24 corresponds to full channel inversion .",
    "the use of @xmath25 indicates that power control is applied with respect to the distance to the associated mbs . due to the dense deployment",
    ", we assume that the network is interference - limited and the effect of the noise is ignored .",
    "the success of the transmission is determined by the received signal - to - interference ratio ( sir ) @xmath26 of the associated base station @xmath27 , given by : @xmath28 where @xmath29 denotes the aggregate interference . for a given target sir threshold @xmath30 ,",
    "the transmission is successful if @xmath31 .",
    "the data rate is a function of the target sir following shannon s formula @xmath32 with a unit bandwidth .",
    "the transmit powers of the interfering users ( @xmath33 in ) are actually not independent , since the area of the voronoi cells of the adjacent users are correlated . in order to the analytical tractability , we will assume that the transmit powers of the interfering users are independent .",
    "the similar assumption is also made in @xcite .    as a reference scheme ,",
    "the user @xmath34 associates with the one of the bss ( mbs or sbs ) , denoted by @xmath35 , which has the maximal average received signal strength in the ul : @xmath36 note that the `` classical '' association is based on the received dl signal .",
    "our reference scheme is thus related to the newly proposed dl / ul decoupling ( dude ) @xcite , where the ul association is done according to ( [ e : de ] ) and is decoupled from the dl association .",
    "we call this scheme as a single association ( sa )",
    ". we use @xmath37 to denote the success probability of da . in the following sections , we analyze the success probability .",
    "now we consider the success probability @xmath37 of double association .",
    "the user connects to both the mbs and the sbs .",
    "then the success probability is : @xmath38,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 and @xmath40 denote the received sir at the typical mbs and sbs .",
    ".   means the transmission is only failed if both mbs and sbs can not receive the data . in our system model , mbss and sbss are deployed by independent point processes , such that these two probabilities are independent . we can rewrite as follows : @xmath41 } \\right)\\left ( { 1 - \\pr \\left [ { { \\gamma _",

    "the fpc is performed based on the distance to the associated mbs .",
    "the term @xmath45 denotes the interference at typical mbs .",
    "the communication distance @xmath44 is a random variable with probability density function @xmath46 .",
    "as stated already , we approximate the user deployment process as ppp with intensity @xmath2 , such that the distance distribution becomes @xmath47 .",
    "the communication distances , which are the distances of the ul users to their associated mbss , might be identically distributed , but not independent .",
    "the dependence is caused by the restriction that only one ul user can be situated in each voronoi cell .",
    "this implies that , on average , the communication distances are closer compared to the communication distance in ppp since there is no restriction in ppp ( see fig .  2 in @xcite ) .",
    "hence , the success probability in ppp offers a lower bound to the original success probability , expressed as follows : @xmath482\\pi \\lambda r{e^ { - \\pi \\lambda { r^2}}}dr } \\nonumber \\\\   & \\stackrel{(a)}= \\int_0^\\infty   { { \\mathbb{e}_{{i_m}}}\\left [ { \\exp \\left ( { - \\beta { r^\\alpha } \\min { { \\left ( { { r^{\\alpha \\epsilon } } p,\\bar p } \\right)}^ { - 1}}{i_m } } \\right ) } \\right]2\\pi \\lambda r{e^ { - \\pi \\lambda { r^2}}}dr } \\nonumber \\\\   & \\stackrel{(b)}= \\int_0^{{{\\hat p}^{\\frac{1}{{\\alpha \\epsilon } } } } } { { \\mathbb{e}_{{i_m}}}\\left [ { \\exp \\left ( { - \\frac{{\\beta { r^\\alpha } { r^ { - \\alpha \\epsilon } } } } { p}{i_m } } \\right ) } \\right]2\\pi \\lambda r{e^ { - \\pi \\lambda { r^2}}}dr } \\nonumber \\\\   & \\qquad\\qquad+\\int_{{{\\hat p}^{\\frac{1}{{\\alpha \\epsilon } } } } } ^\\infty   { { \\mathbb{e}_{{i_m}}}\\left [ { \\exp \\left ( { - \\frac{{\\beta { r^\\alpha } } } { { \\bar p}}{i_m } } \\right ) }",
