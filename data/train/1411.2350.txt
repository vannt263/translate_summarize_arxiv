    "the @xmath7cdm model predicts the existence of a cosmological constant @xmath7 , entering the einstein equations and responsible for the dynamical properties of the universe today .",
    "indeed , the model arguably represents the simplest cosmological paradigm to allow the universe to speed up at late times . despite its experimental successes ,",
    "the @xmath7cdm model is unable to explain why the magnitudes of both matter and @xmath7 energy densities are so comparable today .",
    "nevertheless , cosmological constraints indicate a severe difference between the observed @xmath7 and the corresponding quantum field theory s value .",
    "it follows that the standard @xmath7cdm model could represent only a limiting case of more general paradigm , based on the existence of some sort of ( dynamical ) cosmic fluid , driving the universe today , dubbed dark energy @xcite .",
    "dark energy seems to dominate over all cosmological species enabling the universe to accelerate .",
    "dark energy acts as a _ dynamical source _ for speeding up the universe , whereas dark matter is responsible for structure formation .",
    "recently , the need of understanding at which time the decelerating - accelerating transition phase occurs has leads cosmologists to directly measure the corresponding transition redshift @xmath0 @xcite",
    ". there exists a wide consensus , based on robust observational supports , indicating @xmath0 around the unity @xcite . even though the @xmath7cdm value of @xmath0 reproduces the same result of recent observations",
    ", we can not conclude that dark energy is a constant at all stages of universe s evolution .",
    "however , several classes of models depart from the case of @xmath9 , indicating that @xmath0 represents a _",
    "_ n__ew cosmic number which any cosmological model should reproduce to be in accordance with cosmic bounds . among concurring models to @xmath7cdm , modified gravity is considered a realistic alternative to dark energy . in particular , the challenge of finding out the most viable function @xmath1 , which permits to describe the gravity as a whole , passes through the reconstruction of the correct cosmological model . in other words",
    ", determining viable numerical outcomes of @xmath0 means to reproduce the @xmath1 models which satisfy the late - time bounds in a model independent way @xcite . to support this idea",
    ", one can consider _ cosmography _ , which represents a technique for matching cosmic data with observable quantities without imposing a particular cosmological model .",
    "in general , a taylor expansions evaluated at present - time is adopted in cosmography . constraining a class of coefficients",
    "gives rise to the _ cosmographic series _ @xcite .",
    "hence , the use of cosmography may suggest possible departures from the standard @xmath7cdm model and also allows to understand how and whether dark energy evolves in time @xcite . in this paper , we show how to get the hubble rate by assuming the cosmographic constraints on @xmath1 models .",
    "further , we bound numerical intervals for the transition redshift @xmath0 and demonstrate that only particular classes of @xmath1 models allow to get @xmath0 in the correct observable ranges .",
    "afterwards , we propose an effective evolving dark energy term which extends the @xmath7cdm model and provides a logarithmic correction to the dark energy density .",
    "this model predicts that the corresponding acceleration parameter changes sign around @xmath10 .",
    "finally , we describe the corresponding @xmath11 function in terms of the cosmographic coefficients and propose a possible expression for it . the paper is structured as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we describe the cosmographic approach in the context of @xmath1 gravity and compute the corresponding transition redshift .",

    "corrections to the hubble rate , inferred from @xmath1 gravity , can be achieved by means of cosmography .",
    "the technique allows to determine the corresponding @xmath1-transition redshift @xmath0 showing its compatibility with present - time constraints .",
    "in particular , cosmography represents a technique to fix limits on @xmath1 and its derivatives by passing through the use of an auxiliary function @xmath2 .",
    "this means to define @xmath11 and its first derivative through @xmath50 . to this end",
    ", one needs the scale factor expansion into a taylor series around the present epoch @xmath51 : @xmath52 keeping in mind eq .",
    "( [ aexpans ] ) , we are able to evaluate @xmath2 and derivatives at @xmath53 which corresponds to @xmath54 . to relate @xmath2 and derivatives to the cosmographic expansion of @xmath55 , it is necessary to assume the constraint on @xmath56 @xcite @xmath57 with @xmath58 .",
    "simple algebra leads to @xmath59 and @xmath60 . from eq .",
    "( [ aexpans ] ) , we define the cosmographic coefficients as @xmath61 respectively the hubble rate @xmath62 , the acceleration parameter @xmath63 , the variation of acceleration , i.e. the jerk parameter @xmath64 . constraining the above quantities by means of cosmological data permits one to fix the initial settings on the curvature dark energy term and so on the form of @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , once scalar curvature is somehow fixed by geometrical observations , cosmography becomes a pure model - independent treatment to fix cosmic bounds and to understand which corrections due to @xmath1 models are really viable to describe current universe expansion .",
    "furthermore , it is easy to show that the measurements of the cosmographic parameters provide the disadvantage that all coefficients @xmath65 and @xmath64 can not be measured alone .",
    "assuming , in fact , the luminosity distance as function of the cosmographic series , i.e. @xmath66 , and comparing cosmic data with it , we notice that it is impossible to _ decouple _ the terms @xmath67 and @xmath68 , respectively the second and third orders of the taylor expansion of @xmath69 @xcite .",
    "thus , to better limit @xmath70 and @xmath5 independently , alleviating the corresponding degeneracy problem between coefficients , and also reducing the error bars , one can measure @xmath71 alone , by considering the first order of @xmath69 taylor expansion @xmath72 in the observational range @xmath73 . here , we adopt the union 2.1 supernova compilation @xcite and we compare our results with those predicted by the planck mission @xcite . once @xmath71 is fixed , it is possible to determine the corresponding @xmath74 and @xmath5 and it is also possible to obtain @xmath75 finally , we have @xmath76 these expressions are needful for setting priors on @xmath2 in terms of cosmography and to understand which deceleration - acceleration transition redshift @xmath0 is predicted in the context of @xmath1 gravity . with these considerations in mind , we can integrate the modified friedmann equations , directly by using cosmographic measurements as a sort of _ setting conditions_. in so doing , we infer a parameterized cosmological model , which differs from the @xmath7cdm model and shows an effective logarithmic dark energy term @xmath6 of the form @xcite : @xmath77 the whole hubble rate becomes @xmath78 , with @xmath35 and @xmath40 constants to be fixed by present - time bounds .",

    "the corresponding cosmographic @xmath2 function becomes @xmath81 with @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",

    "( [ lkdfj ] ) and ( [ quxz ] ) , the cosmographic reconstruction favors values of the hubble constant in agreement with other previous estimations @xcite and with the planck results on @xmath71 @xcite .",
    "the bounds on @xmath89 and @xmath90 suggest that @xmath63 changes sign at @xmath91 , in agreement with previous measurements @xcite , showing meanwhile that our model provides @xmath92 to be compatible with the @xmath7cdm predictions . in addition , our cosmological model , providing an evolving dark energy , as presented in eq .",

    "the passage between the deceleration to acceleration phases happens as the acceleration parameter @xmath63 vanishes , corresponding to a precise transition redshift @xmath0 . to understand how well @xmath1 gravities are able to reproduce suitable bounds on @xmath0",

    "cosmography represents a strategy to fix constraints on the principal observable quantities by means of taylor expansions around present - time .",
    "cosmic data may be directly matched with the cosmographic coefficients and so the cosmographic series permits to understand which models are really favored than others . in the case of @xmath1 gravity , we defined the auxiliary function @xmath2 as @xmath11 and its first derivative as @xmath94 . thus , we showed how to relate them to the cosmographic parameters , i.e. @xmath4 and @xmath5 . in particular , reconstructing the modified dark energy term in terms of @xmath1 , by using as _ initial settings _ the numerical values inferred from cosmography , we found that dark energy seems to evolve as a curvature fluid proportional to a logarithm , at small redshift .",
