    "a subject of great current interest is that of a microscopic description of the ferroelectric transition . it is known that at the transition a divergence of the dielectric constant @xmath2 at @xmath3 occurs , which in most cases is understood as corresponding to the fact that the frequency of an infrared peak goes to zero . on the other hand ,",
    "the infrared frequencies are usually studied via a linear analysis of phonon dispersion relations , while the nonlinear contribution to the dynamics should be relevant at the transition to the ferroelectric phase , as should be near any phase transition .",
    "so the problem arises of how the infrared peaks should be described in a fully nonlinear setting .",
    "a description can actually be given through the study of the time autocorrelation of the polarization due to the ions , which can be computed in the classical approximation via molecular dynamics simulations .",
    "computations of this type were indeed performed successfully in the case of @xcite , with results that agree with the experimental data in a surprisingly good way .    at the moment , as will be explained below , we are unable to study ferroelectrics through molecular dynamics .",
    "so in this paper we limit ourselves to quartz , which is not a ferroelectric material , but however presents a divergence in the dielectric constant at the temperature of the @xmath0@xmath1 transition .",
    "we compute here its refractive index curves in the infrared region .",
    "our main concerns are the dynamical properties of the system , particularly at the @xmath0@xmath1 transition , and the quantitative agreement between calculated and experimental spectra in the infrared for @xmath0 quartz .",
    "as is well known @xcite , linear analysis shows that quartz is doubly refractive and that the peaks in its refractive  index curves correspond to the frequencies of the active normal modes .",
    "such qualitative results are confirmed by the present molecular dynamics simulations for @xmath0 quartz at high temperatures , even at the transition to the @xmath1 phase , notwithstanding the high nonlinearity of the system .",
    "this quantitative agreement of the nonlinear results with those of the linear analysis , in particular for the values of the frequencies , is quite surprising , in view of the large nonlinear contributions , and probably is due to some deep reason not yet fully understood . on the other hand , both the linear analysis and our nonlinear study fail in perfectly reproducing the experimental data , as some systematic deviations are observed .",
    "we tried several procedures for choosing the parameters , both of the linear model and of the nonlinear one , in order to find a better agreement with the experimental curves .",
    "but there was no way of reducing the relative error below a threshold of the order of 6% .",
    "this fact , too , requires an explanation .",
    "these are the two main results of the present work .",

    "<S> the first one is to understand the role of nonlinearities in situations where they are very large , as at the @xmath0@xmath1 structural phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> we show that on the one hand they do nt play an essential role in connection with the form of the spectra in the infrared . on the other hand they play an essential role in introducing a chaoticity which involves a definite normal mode . </S>",
    "<S> this might explain why that mode is raman active in the @xmath0 phase , but not in the @xmath1 phase . </S>",
    "<S> the second objective concerns whether it is possible in a microscopic model to obtain normal mode frequencies , or peak frequencies in the optical spectra , that are in good agreement with the experimental data for quartz . notwithstanding a lot of effort , we were unable to find results agreeing better than about 6% , as apparently also occurs in the whole available literature . </S>",
