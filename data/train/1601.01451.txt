    "type ia supernova ( sn ia ) is a sub - category of cataclysmic variable stars that results from the violent explosion of a white dwarf star in a binary system @xcite .",
    "it can be used as standard candles to measure the expansion history of the universe @xcite , and it has become one of the most powerful tools to probe the nature of dark energy ( de ) @xcite . in recent years , several supernova ( sn ) datasets have been released , such as `` snls ''  @xcite , `` union ''  @xcite , `` constitution ''  @xcite , `` sdss ''  @xcite , `` union2 ''  @xcite , `` snls3 ''  @xcite and `` union2.1 ''  @xcite .",
    "the latest sn sample is `` joint light - curve analysis '' ( jla ) dataset @xcite , which consists of 740 supernovae ( sne ) .",
    "jla data includes 118 sne at @xmath9 from several low - redshift samples  @xcite , 374 sne at @xmath10 from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) sn search  @xcite , 239 sne at @xmath11 from the supernova legacy survey ( snls ) observations  @xcite and 9 sne at @xmath12 from hubble space telescope ( hst )  @xcite .",
    "it should be stressed that , in the process of cosmology - fits , betoule et al . treated two important quantities , stretch - luminosity parameter @xmath0 and color - luminosity parameter @xmath1 of sn ia , as free model parameters @xcite .",
    "this procedure is same as the recipe of @xcite .    the early proposals to use sn ia as standard candles made an assumption that the early samples were too small to test .",
    "by now sn samples are large enough for many meaningful tests to be done .",
    "one of the most important tests is to probe the possibility of redshift - dependence of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "so far , there is no evidence for the evolution of @xmath0 .",
    "but the redshift - dependence of @xmath1 has been found for several sn datasets . for examples , by using the bin - by - bin method , marriner et al . found the redshift - dependence of @xmath1 for the sdss data @xcite . besides , by adopting a linear @xmath1 , mohlabeng and ralston found the evolution of @xmath1 at 7@xmath5 confidence level ( cl ) for the union2.1 data @xcite .",
    "in addition , one of the present authors had also done a series of research works about this issue . in @xcite , we found that @xmath1 deviates from a constant at 6@xmath5 cl for the snls3 data .",
    "soon after , by studying various de and modified gravity models with a linear @xmath1 @xcite , we found that the evolution of @xmath1 has significant effects on parameter estimation , and the introduction of a time - varying @xmath1 can reduce the tension between sn ia and other cosmological observations .    in a recent work @xcite ,",
    "the discussion about time - varying @xmath1 has been extended into the case of jla data . by adopting two specific parameterizations of @xmath1 , shariff et al . found 4.6@xmath5 cl evidence for a significant drop in @xmath1 at redshift @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "it should be pointed out that , the results of @xcite depend on two particular parameterizations of @xmath1 . to further investigate the possible redshift - dependence of @xmath1 , it is necessary to revisit this issue using a model - independent method . in this work ,",
    "we adopt the redshift tomography method , which has been widely used in the investigation of cosmology @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is to divide the sn data into different redshift bins , assuming that both @xmath0 and @xmath1 are piecewise constants .",
    "it should be pointed out that , adopting the redshift tomography method will reduce the statistical significance . then we constrain @xmath2-cold - dark - matter ( @xmath2cdm ) model and check the consistency of cosmology - fit results in each bin . in addition , it is very interesting to explore the possible evolution of @xmath1 in various subsamples of jla . as far as we know ,",
    "this issue has not been studied in the past .",
    "therefore , we also apply the same technique to various subsamples of jla .",
    "moreover , it is important to study the impacts of possible redshift - dependence of @xmath1 on the parameter estimation . to do this",
    ", we adopt a binned parameterization of @xmath1 in the analysis .",
    "we describe our method in section [ sec : data ] , present our results in section [ sec : results ] , and summarize in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "in this section , we firstly introduce how to calculate the @xmath14 function of jla data .",
    "then , we describe the details of the redshift tomography method .    theoretically , the distance modulus @xmath15 in a flat universe can be written as @xmath16 + 25,\\ ] ] where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the cmb restframe and heliocentric redshifts of sn .",
    "the luminosity distance @xmath19 is given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the speed of light , @xmath22 is the hubble constant and @xmath23 is the reduced hubble parameter . for @xmath2cdm ,",
    "@xmath24 can be written as @xmath25 here @xmath7 is the present fractional matter density .",
    "the observation of distance modulus @xmath26 is given by a empirical linear relation : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the observed peak magnitude in the rest - frame @xmath29 band , @xmath30 describes the time stretching of light - curve , @xmath31 describes the supernova color at maximum brightness and @xmath32 is the absolute b - band magnitude , which depends on the host galaxy properties @xcite .",

    "moreover , to ensure that our results are insensitive to the details of redshift tomography , we evenly divide the jla sample at redshift region [ 0,1 ] into 3 bins , 4 bins and 5 bins , respectively ; then , we compare the fitting results obtained from these three cases . in this work",

    "for all the panels , it can be seen that the 1@xmath5 regions of @xmath0 given by the full jla sample ( gray region ) overlap with the results given by the sn samples of various bins at 1@xmath5 cl .",

    "the 1@xmath5 upper bound of @xmath1 in the last bin deviates from the results given by the full jla sample at 3.6@xmath5 cl . for the case of 5 bins",
    ", there is a hint for the evolution of @xmath1 for the fourth bin ; moreover , the 1@xmath5 upper bound of @xmath1 in the last bin deviates from the results given by the full jla sample at 3.6@xmath5 cl .",

    "it must be stressed that , this conclusion is consistent with the results of some other sn samples @xcite , but is inconsistent with the results of the snls3 dataset , which indicates that @xmath1 has a trend of increasing at high redshift @xcite .",
    "the reason of this tension is still unclear and deserves further studies .",

    "it is interesting to explore the evolution of @xmath1 in various subsamples of jla . in this paper",
    "we only directly apply the redshift tomography method to the low-@xmath4 , the sdss , and the snls subsamples , because the hst subsample only contains 9 data points . to study the effects of hst subsample",

    "the 1@xmath5 upper bound of @xmath1 in the last bin deviates from the results given by the full sdss subsample at 2@xmath5 cl , showing that the sdss subsample favors a decreasing @xmath1 at high redshift .",
    "this conclusion is consistent with the results of @xcite . for the case of snls ,",
    "the 1@xmath5 upper bounds of @xmath1 in the third bin and the fourth bin deviate from the results of the full snls subsample at 1.6@xmath5 and 3.3@xmath5 cl , respectively .",
    "so compared with the case of sdss , the snls subsample favors a time - varying @xmath1 with a larger decreasing rate .",
    "it should be mentioned that , this conclusion is different from the results of the full snls3 sample @xcite .",
    "this means that snls3 dataset may exist some unknown systematic uncertainties @xcite .     +    in fig  [ fig : hst ] , we compare the 1@xmath5 confidence regions of @xmath1 given by the `` jla without hst '' data ( left panel ) with the results given by the full jla sample ( right panel ) .",
    "we can see that the hst subsample only affects the evolution behavior of @xmath1 at high redshift . for the case without hst ,",
    "the 1@xmath5 upper bound of @xmath1 in the last bin deviates from the results given by the full sample at 3.9@xmath5 cl . for the case of full jla sample ,",
    "the 1@xmath5 upper bound of @xmath1 in the last bin deviates from the results given by the full jla sample at 3.6@xmath5 cl .",
    "this indicates that hst subsample can slightly slow down the decreasing rate of @xmath1 at high redshift .",
    "next , we discuss the impacts of a varying @xmath1 on the parameter estimation . for simplicity , here we consider the standard cosmological model : the @xmath2cdm model . as shown in fig [ fig : beta ] , @xmath1 perfers a higher value at low redshift and a lower value at high redshift .",
    "so we assume that @xmath1 is related to the redshift by a simple piecewise function @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are two model parameters . in fig",
    "[ fig : om0 ] , by using the full jla sample only , we plot the 1d marginalized probability distributions of @xmath7 in the cases of constant @xmath1 and varying @xmath66 .",
    "it can be seen that varying @xmath1 yields a lager @xmath7 than the case of constant @xmath1 : for the case of varying @xmath1 , the best - fit value of @xmath7 is @xmath67 , while for the case of constant @xmath1 , the best - fit value of @xmath7 is @xmath68 . note that our result is consistent with the results of @xcite . to make a comparison , in fig [ fig : om0 ] we also plot the 1d marginalized probability distribution of @xmath7 given by a combination of the cmb @xcite and the baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) @xcite data .",
    "the best - fit value of @xmath7 given by cmb+bao data is @xmath69 , which is closer to the best - fit value of the constant @xmath1 case .",
    "this result is different from the result of the snls3 sample @xcite .",
    "however , the result of @xmath7 for the varying @xmath1 case is still consistent with the result for the constant @xmath1 case , as well as the result given by the cmb+bao data , at @xmath8 cl .",
    "sn ia is one of the most powerful tools to explore the current cosmic acceleration .",
    "as the sample size of sn ia rapidly grows , it is very important to perform various tests for these sn samples .",
    "one of the most interesting tests is to probe the possible evolution of sn color parameter , which has drawn a lot of attentions in recent years @xcite . , there are some other meaningful tests for sn smaples , e.g. see refs .",
    "@xcite ]    in a latest work @xcite , adopting two particular parameterizations of @xmath1 , shariff et al . found 4.6@xmath5 cl evidence for a significant drop in @xmath1 at redshift @xmath13 , for the jla sample . in the current work ,",
    "we revisit the possibility of @xmath1 s evolution by using the redshift tomography method .",
    "in addition to the full jla sample , we also study the cases of various jla subsamples .",
    "so far as we know , the effects of various jla subsamples on @xmath1 s evolution have not been studied in the past . moreover",

    "our conclusions are as follows :    * if the full jla sample is used , then @xmath0 is always consistent with a constant ( see fig  [ fig : alpha ] ) , and @xmath1 has a significant trend of decreasing , @xmath3 cl , at high redshift ( see fig  [ fig : beta ] ) . it should be pointed out that , due to that the redshift tomography method tends to reduce statistical significance , the redshift - dependence of @xmath1 is studied the hard way in this work . since the effect of @xmath1 s evolution is strong enough to be found after adopting the redshift tomography method , we can conclude that the evolution of @xmath1 is indisputable .",
    "* if the low-@xmath4 subsample of jla is used , then a constant @xmath1 is favored .",
    "in contrast , if the sdss or the snls subsamples is adopted , then a decreasing @xmath1 is favored .",
    "besides , compared with sdss subsample , snls subsample prefers a larger decreasing rate of @xmath1 ( see fig  [ fig : subsamples ] ) .",
    "it should be pointed out that the trajectory of @xmath1 given by the snls subsample of jla is quite different from the prediction of the full snls3 sample @xcite .",
    "this means that the snls3 dataset may have some unknown systematic bias , or anomalies , not accounted for by the reported systematic uncertainties of snls3 . * if the hst subsample is removed from the full jla data , then the decreasing rate of @xmath1 at high redshift will be slightly enlarged ( see fig  [ fig : hst ] ) . *",
    "if a binned parameterization of @xmath1 is adopted , then a larger best - fit value of @xmath7 will be obtained , compared to the case of constant @xmath1 . however , if the information of @xmath8 region is taken into account , then for both the time - varying @xmath1 and the constant @xmath1 cases , the results of @xmath7 are consistent with the result given by the cmb+bao data .    in this paper , we only consider the simplest @xmath2cdm model .",
    "in addition to @xmath2cdm , many other de models @xcite are also favored by current cosmological observations .",
