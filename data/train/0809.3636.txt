    "universality and scaling in critical systems have attracted much attention in recent decades @xcite .",
    "it has been found that critical systems can be classified into different universality classes so that the systems in the same class have the same set of critical exponents @xcite . according to the theory of finite - size scaling @xcite ,",
    "if the dependence of a physical quantity @xmath7 of a thermodynamic system on a parameter @xmath8 , which vanishes at the critical point @xmath9 , is of the form @xmath10 near the critical point , then for a finite system of linear dimension @xmath11 , the corresponding quantity @xmath12 is of the form @xmath13 where @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) is the thermal scaling power , @xmath16 is the scaling function , and @xmath17 is the scaling variable .",
    "it follows from ( [ e0 ] ) that the scaled data @xmath18 for different values of @xmath11 and @xmath8 are described by a single finite - size scaling function ( fssf ) @xmath16 .",
    "thus it is important to know general features of the scaling function under various conditions . on the basis of the renormalization group arguments , privman and fisher @xcite",
    "proposed that systems in the same universality classes can have universal finite - size scaling functions ( ufssfs ) .",
    "percolation models @xcite are ideal systems for studying universal and scaling behaviors near the critical point .",
    "the system is defined to be percolated when there is at least one cluster extending from the top to the bottom of the system .",
    "the average fraction of lattice sites in the percolating clusters is called the percolation probability @xcite ( also known as percolation strength ) and will be denoted by @xmath1 in the present paper . the probability that at least one percolating cluster exists in the system is called the existence probability @xcite or crossing probability , and will be denoted by @xmath0 in the present paper @xcite .    using a histogram monte carlo method @xcite and other monte carlo methods , hu and collaborators found that the fssfs depend sensitively on the boundary conditions @xcite and shapes @xcite of the lattices and many two - dimensional percolation models ( including bond and site percolation models on square , honeycomb , and triangular lattices , continuum percolation of soft disk and hard disks , bond percolation on random lattices , etc ) @xcite can have universal fssfs ( ufssfs ) for their @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and many three - dimensional percolation models ( including site percolation on sc , bcc , and fcc lattices and bond percolation on sc lattice ) @xcite have universal critical exponents and ufssfs for their @xmath0 and @xmath1 .    in the present paper , we will study the bond percolation model on @xmath19 rectangular lattices ( domains ) @xcite , especially the dependence of @xmath0 and @xmath1 on the aspect ratio @xmath2 , which is the ratio of the horizontal length @xmath20 to the vertical length @xmath21 of the system , i.e. , @xmath22 .",
    "for this system , it is well known that the critical bond density @xmath23 ( also called bond occupation probability ) is 1/2 , the critical exponent @xmath24 for the percolation probability @xmath1 is 5/36 , @xmath25 , and the critical exponent for the existence probability @xmath0 is 0 @xcite , which and eq . ( [ e0 ] )",
    "imply that the dependence of @xmath0 on the the linear dimension @xmath11 , the bond density @xmath26 , and the aspect ratio @xmath2 can be written as @xmath27 near the critical point",
    "@xmath23  @xcite .",
    "the function @xmath28 is universal for various percolation models considered in ref .",
    "the aspect ratio dependence of the function @xmath28 is not clear ; _",
    "e.g. _ , the systems with close values of @xmath2 should have similar forms of @xmath28 , however , eq .  ( [ eq_ufssf ] )",
    "do not tell us how similar they are . while the value of the existence probability at the critical point @xmath29 was obtained by cardy  @xcite , such critical @xmath0 approaches quickly to @xmath30 as the aspect ratio is increased , _",
    "e.g. _ , it is difficult to distinguish the value for @xmath31 from that for @xmath32 . additionally , the region for the rapid increase of @xmath0 shifts to the smaller value of @xmath26 with larger @xmath2 and fixed @xmath11 , which can not be described quantitatively .",
    "therefore , we need other kinds of approach to study the aspect ratio dependence of the ufssfs .    recently , we found `` superscaling '' of the existence probability @xmath0 and the percolation probability @xmath1 for bond percolation on rectangular domains with different aspect ratios @xcite : @xmath33 and @xmath34 , with new exponents @xmath3 and @xmath4 , where @xmath35 with @xmath36 being the effective critical point ; @xmath3 and @xmath4 were determined by a fitting procedure to be @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively . in the present paper , we define mapping functions to connect ufssfs for percolation on domains with different aspect ratios and find that @xmath3 and @xmath4 can be obtained from numerically determined mapping functions @xmath5 and @xmath6 for @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively  @xcite .    2 mm",
    "in order to make the meaning of the mapping function becomes clear , we first introduce the mapping function for the percolation model on the square lattices with the same aspect ratio .",
    "consider two different square systems @xmath39 and @xmath40 with the linear sizes @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively .",
    "the existence probability of the system @xmath40 at density ( also called occupation probability ) @xmath26 is denoted by @xmath43 .",
    "the existence probability is a monotonic increasing function whose value changes from @xmath44 to @xmath30 as the density increases from @xmath44 to @xmath30 .",
    "therefore , for every @xmath43 of system @xmath40 , there is a corresponding value @xmath45 of system @xmath39 so that the existence probability of system @xmath39 at @xmath45 , denoted as @xmath46 , is equal to @xmath43 and we have @xmath47 which defines the renormalization group transformation from @xmath26 to @xmath48 in ref .",
    "the mapping from @xmath26 to @xmath45 is represented as the mapping function @xmath49 the mapping function depends only on the ratio of the system size @xmath50 , and therefore , we denote the mapping function by @xmath51 .",
    "the critical point of the system , @xmath23 , can be determined from the fixed point of eq .",

    "( [ eq_fixedpoint ] ) approaches the exact critical point @xmath55 for the bond percolation on the square lattice as @xmath56 .",
    "table 1 of the first reference in @xcite shows that @xmath23 of eq .",
    "( [ eq_fixedpoint ] ) is already very accurate for @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "the expansion of the mapping function at the critical point can be written as @xmath59 it is well known that the thermal scaling power @xmath14 can be obtained from the equation  @xcite @xmath60 which implies that the differential coefficient of the first order in eq .",
    "( [ eq_size_expansion ] ) is given by @xmath61 we can also have the above relation from the viewpoint of the mapping  @xcite .",
    "using eqs .",
    "( [ eq_size_expansion ] ) ,  ( [ eq_fixedpoint ] ) and ( [ eq_coefficent ] ) , we can rewrite eq .  ( [ eq_map ] ) as @xmath62 with the scaling variable @xmath63 .",
    "since the system sizes @xmath41 and @xmath64 are arbitrary , we can choose @xmath41 as unity and rewrite @xmath64 as @xmath11 .",
    "then we have @xmath65 with the scaling function @xmath66 .",
    "equation  ( [ eq_finite_size_mapping ] ) implies that the finite - size scaling theory corresponds to the first order approximation of the expansion in eq .",
    "( [ eq_size_expansion ] ) .    to see the behavior of the mapping function @xmath51 , we determine @xmath51 from numerically obtained existence probabilities .",

    "all of these functions have linear forms and have the single intersection point , namely the critical point .",
    "the ratio of the slope of these lines gives the value of the critical exponent @xmath73 .",
    "similar arguments can be applied for the percolation probability @xmath1 .",
    "a mapping function @xmath74 is defined by , @xmath75 with a system size ratio @xmath50 . here , we defined the mapping function with the additional factors @xmath76 and @xmath77 on the left - hand and right - hand sides of eq .",

    "[ fig_ufssf ] .",
    "the goodness of the scaling in these figures come from the fact that the mapping functions are well approximated by the linear function when the systems have the identical aspect ratio . for the systems with different aspect ratios ,",
    "the mapping functions for @xmath0 becomes highly non - linear function as shown in fig .",

    "[ fig_rmap_ep](b ) for the system size @xmath90 and aspect ratios @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",

    "consider the mapping of the percolation probabilities with different aspect ratio as , @xmath95 with a mapping function @xmath6 .",
    "similar to the case of the existence probability , the behavior of the differential coefficient of @xmath6 can be assumed as @xmath96 with the effective critical point @xmath36 defined by @xmath97 as shown in fig .",
    "note that , the value of effective critical point is different from the one defined by @xmath98 .",
    "we can obtain the superscaling formula as , @xmath99 this scaling form is different from the form @xmath100 obtained by a heuristic argument in @xcite .",
    "the mapping functions of percolation probabilities are determined and shown in fig .",

    "since the mapping functions @xmath5 for @xmath0 have finite curvature , the scaling formula @xmath33 will be improved if we take into account higher order .",
    "this nonlinear scaling form was shown in @xcite , and it corresponds to approximate mapping function with a quadratic form as @xmath102 , which is the expression obtained by taking into account up to the second order derivatives in eq .",

    "in summary , we have studied the aspect ratio dependence of fssfs of existence and percolation probabilities based on the idea of the mapping functions . from the analysis on the numerically obtained mapping functions ,",
    "the superscaling behaviors are found to be the first order approximation of the mapping functions at the effective critical point . since the mapping regime used here",
    "is pretty general , we can apply it for any other systems and geometric conditions .",
    "many lattice phase transition models , such as the ising model , the potts model , the dilute potts model , the hydrogen bonding model for water , lattice hard - core particle models , etc , have been shown to be corresponding to some correlated percolation models @xcite . some of such correlated percolation models have been found to have good finite - size scaling behaviors @xcite .",
    "it is of interest to use mapping functions to study super - scaling in such correlated percolation models and other critical systems @xcite .",
    "another interesting development for critical systems is finite - size corrections for lattice phase transition models @xcite . using exact partition functions of the ising model on finite lattices @xcite and exact finite - size corrections for the free energy , the internal energy , and the specific heat of the ising model @xcite , wu , hu and izmailian",

    "based on finite - size corrections for the dimer model on finite lattices @xcite , izmailian , oganesyan , wu , and hu @xcite obtained ufssfs for the dimer model with analytic equations , which are also free of simulation errors .",
