    "the  classical \" data on the large scale colour distributions of e - type galaxies relies on observations by bender and mllenhof ( 1987 ) , vigroux et al .",

    "( 1989 ) , peletier et al .",
    "( 1990 ) , goudfrooij et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , to quote only the papers discussing the 1-d profiles of colour against radius , as distinguished from studies of dust patterns .",
    "most of these data were reconsidered by michard ( 2000 ) ( rm00 ) , in an attempt to collect a significant sample of objects with a complete optical colour set , i.e. u@xmath2b , b@xmath2v , b@xmath2r and v@xmath2i in a coherent photometric system .",
    "this was adequate to confirm previous indications about the cause of colour gradients : these appear to be due essentially to population gradients within galaxies , with the dust playing no important role , except in galaxies with central intense dust patterns .",
    "such objects are rather rare among the es .",
    "similar to most spectral indices of stellar populations , the colours suffer from the well known age - metallicity degeneracy , and , except u@xmath2b or u@xmath2v , are not very sensitive to the two parameters .",
    "they are affected by dust , at least locally , or perhaps systematically in the central regions according to inferences based on a survey by michard ( 1999 ) ( rm99 ) . on the other hand",
    ", they may be measured at lower surface brightnesses or larger radii than the line indices .",
    "they could therefore bring useful information to the study of fossil stellar populations , and further constraints upon models of the evolution of e galaxies .",
    "the present work aims to provide an enlarged sample of objects with complete colour data , extending farther in radius than in previous studies , and hopefully of improved accuracy .    in paper",
    "i , we present the usual information about the observations and data reduction , and part of the results in tabular form . a larger set of results will be made available in electronic form .",
    "the frames , partly reduced , will be made available from the hypercat database , observatoire de lyon .    in paper ii , under the assumption that the observed colour gradients reflect abundance variations along the radius , metallicity gradients will be computed from the present data , using new colour - metallicity calibrations derived from multi - population models for e - galaxies .",
    "these metallicity gradients allow an estimation of central and mean metallicities .",
    "statistics of galaxies included in our sample indicate that mean metallicities are about solar , in agreement with the study by trager et al .",
    "( 2000 ) based on spectral indices .    _ often used notations _    * @xmath4 isophotal radius ; @xmath5 for an ellipse of semi - axis @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "* @xmath8 colour gradient in u@xmath2b ; @xmath9 and similar for other colours .",
    "* die , boe , une : subclassification of e galaxies as disky , boxy and undetermined .",
    "the observations were performed with the 120 cm newtonian telescope of the observatoire de haute - provence , in three runs : april 1 - 11 2000 , may 29-june 5 2000 and january 18 - 29 2001 , noted below as _ run 1 , 2 and 3_. tables 1 to 4 gives lists of the observed galaxies with some parameters relevant on the observing conditions .",
    "a ccd target tek1024 is mounted in the camera , giving a field of view of 11.6x11.6 for a pixel size of 24 microns or 0.68 .",
    "the relatively large field is a favorable feature of this system for the observation of colour distributions in nearby galaxies .",
    "less favourable are the rather poor seeing at the ohp , with the fwhm of star images usually in the 2 - 3range , with values at 4 or more during periods of northern wind ( mistral ) , and also the sky illumination by ever increasing urban lights .    the camera is unfortunately affected by the so - called  red - halo \" effect .",
    ".a list of the observations .",
    "the dates refer to the begining of the night .",
    "two values @xmath10 and @xmath11 are given for the frame fwhm ( in ): the first is the original one ; the second was attained after the treatment tending to equalize the fwhm of all 5 frames in a colour set , this at the value of the best one .",

    "new colour - radius relations have been derived for 36 e - type galaxies of the northern local supercluster , using ubvri frames obtained with the 120 cm telescope of the observatoire de haute - provence .",
    "four sa0 , i.e. ngc3115 , 3607 , 4551 and 5866 were also observed .",
    "we aimed to take advantage of the large field of the camera to observe the galaxies at larger radii than hitherto feasible , and thus improve the accuracy of colour gradients .",
    "the availability of the series of aperture photometry in pp88 and pn94 for most of the sample was also considered an asset towards a more coherent system of colours .",
    "it appears indeed that _ the colour calibrations are improved here compared to previous work _",
    ", if this can be judged from the quality of correlations between zero point colours in various surveys ( see sect .",
    "4.1 )    two steps in the reduction procedure were thought significant in improving the quality of colour profiles : the first was the adjustment of the fwhm of the psfs in a given colour set of 5 frames to the best of the five .",
    "this allowed us to get significant colours much closer to the galaxy center than otherwise feasible .",
    "the second was a careful  mapping \" of the background of each frame , in order to lessen the background fluctuations remaining after the usual flat - fielding procedures .",
    "both these precautions proved successful , and , as a result , the radial range of satisfactory colour measurements was greatly enlarged .",
    "near the galaxy center , it proved feasible to obtain  central colours  , i.e. colours integrated in the circle @xmath12 , in fair agreement with high resolution data ( see sect . 3.2.7.2 and table 10 ) .",
    "on the other hand , colours could be obtained at much lower surface brightness ( or larger radii ) than in previous work .",
    "our colour data extend to @xmath13 , with a median value near @xmath14 in all colours . according to the comparisons in sect .",
    "4.1 , this is _ 1.5 to 2 magnitudes deeper than in previous work_.  external colours \" , refering to the level @xmath14 whenever possible , are published for the first time ( see table 11 ) , and may be useful to give some indications about stellar populations at the outskirts of e - galaxies .    on the other hand ,",
    "the  red halo `` effect of the camera was found to give enormous errors in v@xmath2i colours and gradients .",
    "these were corrected by a rigorous technique , and results in agreement with ",
    "classical '' data were obtained .",
    "considering the v@xmath2i gradients , one is not happy however to introduce in their evaluation , corrections larger than the quantity to be measured ! besides this specific problem of the red halo of thinned ccd ,",
    "the far wings of the psfs have been proven in a recent paper ( rm01 ) to have non negligible effects in the gradients of other colours , and also to vary with the age of mirror coatings .",
    "it is not impossible that the u@xmath2b or u@xmath2v gradients given here are overestimated by 15 - 20% , although they are in excellent statistical agreement with the well - known work of peletier et al .",
    "( 1990 ) .",
    "various colour gradients against @xmath0 for a given object are well correlated , generally better than in previous work ( see statistics in sect .",
    "4.1 ) , which is interpreted as due to smaller measuring errors , notably in u@xmath2b .",
    "these improvements in accuracy did not bring out any obvious correlation between gradients and other galaxy properties .",
    "a few galaxies have exceptionally steep colour gradients ( nearly at @xmath15 ) without sharing other properties .",
    "colour - colour relations can be built from the present data for several locations in galaxies , such as near center , various fractions of the effective radius @xmath16 , or the  outermost \" measured range around @xmath1 .",
    "all these diagrams overlap to form a single stripe with moderate scatter ( except for one rather obvious calibration error ? )",
    ". these might prove useful to test theories of old stellar populations and of their host galaxies .",
    "colour - colour diagrams based upon integrated colours have already been used for this purpose ( worthey , 1994 ) .",
    "the u@xmath2b or u@xmath2v colours correlate very well with the @xmath3 index , both near the galaxy center and at the effective radius @xmath16 .",
    "this seems to rule out any large influence of diffuse dust in the colours and colour gradients in e - galaxies .",
    "this was considered likely by witt et al .",
    "( 1992 ) and discussed by wise and silva ( 1996 ) with inconclusive results .",
    "previous arguments against such an influence were presented in rm00 : they were based upon the relative average values of the gradients in various colours , and are reinforced in the present work , since the mean gradients are nearly unchanged , and their errors lessened .",
    "it is well known that , for single - burst stellar populations , colours and line indices depend both on the metallicity and on the age of the system ( worthey 1994 ; borges et al .",
    "however , e - galaxies are constituted by a population mix , having age and metallicity distributions which reflect their star formation histories .",
    "therefore a colour - metallicity calibration requires the use of models able to provide those distributions and , consequently , the integrated colours along the galaxy lifetime .",
    "such a calibration will be presented in paper ii .",
