    "the authors construct module categories via a completely different approach in the context of loop groups .",

    "however , we do get fairly general formulas for the index and principal graphs of this type of subfactors in the unitary case , which was one of the problems posed in @xcite .",
    "these formulas were known to this author as well as to antony wassermann at least back in 2008 when they had discussions about their respective works in oberwolfach and at the schr \" odinger institute .",
    "we close this section by mentioning that while our results for @xmath252 odd and @xmath253 even are in many ways parallel to results obtained via other approaches in connection with twisted loop groups , there does not seem to be an obvious analog for our results for @xmath252 even . e.g. the combinatorial results in @xcite for that case seem to be different to ours .",
    "we have constructed module categories of fusion categories of type @xmath11 via deformations of centralizer algebras of certain subgroups of unitary groups .",
    "we have also classified when they are unitarizable , and we have constructed the corresponding subfactors .",
    "these deformations are compatible with the drinfeld - jimbo deformation of the unitary group but not with the drinfeld - jimbo deformation of the subgroup .",
    "most of the deformation was already done in @xcite via elementary methods . in principle , at least , it should be possible to use this elementary approach also for other inclusions .",
    "however , this might become increasingly tedious .    as we have seen already in section [ molev ]",
    ", it should be possible to get a somewhat more conceptual approach using different deformations of the subgroup , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and references therein .",
    "in particular in the work of letzter , such deformations via co - ideal algebras have been defined for a large class of embeddings of a semisimple lie algebra into another one . at this point",
    ", it does not seem obvious how to define @xmath1-structures in this setting , and additional complications arise as these coideal algebras are not expected to be semisimple at roots of unity . nevertheless , the results in this and other papers such as @xcite , @xcite would seem to suggest that similar constructions might be possible also in a more general setting .",

    "<S> it is motivated by finding a deformation of orthogonal or symplectic subgroups of a unitary group which is compatible with the standard quantum deformation of the big group . </S>",
    "<S> this has been done before on the level of coideal subalgebras of hopf algebras by letzter . </S>",
    "<S> however , our categorical approach also allows us to extend this to the level of fusion tensor categories , where we find finite analogs of symmetric spaces related to the already mentioned groups . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we can establish @xmath1 structures , necessary for the construction of subfactors , in this categorical setting ; this is not so obvious to see in the setting of co - ideal algebras .    </S>",
    "<S> it is well - known how one can use a subgroup @xmath2 of a ( for simplicity here ) finite group @xmath3 to construct a module category of the representation category @xmath4 of @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> this module category also appears in the context of subfactors of ii@xmath5 von neumann factors as follows : let @xmath6 be the hyperfinite ii@xmath5 factor , and let @xmath7 be the fixed points under outer actions of @xmath3 and @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> then the category of @xmath8 bimodules is equivalent to @xmath4 , and the module category is given via the @xmath9 bimodules of the inclusion @xmath10 ; its simple objects are labeled by the irreducible representations of @xmath2 . in particular , </S>",
    "<S> an important invariant called the principal graph of the subfactor is determined by the restriction rules for representations from @xmath3 to @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> important examples of subfactors were constructed from fusion categories whose grothendieck semirings are quotients of the ones of semisimple lie groups . </S>",
    "<S> so a natural question to ask is whether one can perform a similar construction in this context . </S>",
    "<S> more precisely , can we find restriction rules for type @xmath11 fusion categories which describe a subfactor as before , and which will approach in the classical limit the usual restriction rules from @xmath12 to @xmath13 .    </S>",
    "<S> we answer this question in the positive in this paper via a fairly elementary construction . </S>",
    "<S> we show that certain semisimple quotients of the @xmath0-brauer algebras have a @xmath1 structure and contain @xmath1-quotients of hecke algebras of type @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> the subfactor is then obtained as the closure of inductive limits of such algebras . </S>",
    "<S> due to its close connection to lie groups , we can give very explicit general formulas for its index and its first principal graph . </S>",
    "<S> observe that the lie algebra @xmath14 decomposes as an @xmath15 module into the direct sum @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is a simple @xmath15-module . </S>",
    "<S> then the index can be expressed explicitly in terms of the weights of @xmath17 , see theorem [ explicitindex ] . as before in the group case , it can be interpreted as the quotient of the dimension of the given fusion category by the sum of the squares of @xmath0-dimensions of representations of orthogonal or symplectic subgroups whose labels are in the alcove of a certain affine reflection group ; however in our case , there is no corresponding tensor category for the denominator , and the @xmath0-dimensions differ from the ones of the corresponding quantum groups . </S>",
    "<S> also , the restriction rules for the corresponding bimodules of this subfactor , the first principal graph , can be derived from the classical restriction rules via an action of the already mentioned affine reflection group , similarly as it was done before for tensor product rules for fusion categories . however , in our case , the affine reflection comes from the highest short root of the corresponding lie algebra in the non - simply laced case ; it is also different from the one for fusion categories in the even dimensional orthogonal case .    in the case corresponding to @xmath18 , we obtain the goodman - de la harpe - jones subfactors for dynkin diagrams @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> we similarly also obtain a series of subfactors for other even - dimensional orthogonal groups . perhaps a little surprisingly , there does not seem to be an analogous construction which would correspond to the group @xmath20 with @xmath21 even . </S>",
    "<S> our examples for the odd - dimensional orthogonal group and for symplectic groups seem to be closely related to examples constructed by feng xu @xcite and antony wassermann @xcite by completely different methods . </S>",
    "<S> several explicit cases are discussed in detail at the end of the paper , as well as their connections to other approaches , coming from boundary conformal field theory , subfactors and tensor categories .    </S>",
    "<S> the first chapter mostly contains basic material from subfactor theory which will be needed later . in the second chapter we review and expand material on the @xmath0-brauer algebra as defined in @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> see also @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we define @xmath1-structures for certain quotients and use that to construct subfactors . </S>",
    "<S> the third chapter is mainly concerned with the finer structure of these subfactors , such as explicit closed formulas for the index and calculation of the first principal graph . </S>",
    "<S> the same techniques would also extend to other examples , such as the ones in @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> @xmath22 it is a pleasure to thank antony wassermann , david jordan , viktor ostrik and feng xu for useful references , and fred goodman also for technical advice . </S>"
