    "a complete observation ( including calibrations ) of a galaxy can be achieved in 2 hours .",

    "furthermore , the sample is readjusted once the data have been reduced in order to extract the maximum rotational velocity of the galaxy , which is the best indicator of the total , mass at least within the optical radius .",

    "an homogeneous sample of optical data cubes of nearby and isolated spirals with a large range of morphological types , luminosities and mass will allow statistical and individual studies of kinematics and dynamics of galaxies in various environments in the nearby and in the far universe .    * the nearby universe . * to disentangle the intrinsic kinematics proprieties of galaxies , including the effects of mass , luminosity and morphological type from the effects linked to peculiar environments , a large sample of isolated galaxies is as much necessary as samples of peculiar galaxies . by peculiar environments one generally refers to the presence of nearby galaxies or intergalactic gas , i.e. to high - density environments ( like galaxies in pairs , groups , clusters ) at different stages of evolution ( like interactions , mergers , starbursts ) and sometimes presenting anomalous motions ( counter rotating populations -star or gas- , non - axisymetric motions and other anomalous features ) . in the hierarchical scenario , observationally confirmed by the hubble deep fields studies , a consensus is emerging that , at early epochs , all the galaxies - in - formation were strongly interacting , at least to collapse and form the large galaxies observed today . in a certain sense ,",
    "any form of galaxy interactions observed today could be considered as a nearby laboratory of the earlier universe , especially for small galaxies , relatively metal poor , in dense environments .",
    "blue compact galaxies ( bcgs ) , are supposed to be non - evolved galaxies experiencing an acceleration of their evolution ( with respect to their star formation history ) at present or recent epochs . except that bcgs",
    "are often relatively isolated objects , they could be present relics of earlier epochs .",
    "they are characterised by small to intermediate sizes , low chemical abundances , high - star formation rate ( per luminosity ) , hii - region - like - emission spectra , absolute b - magnitude ranging between -12 and -21 , often surrounded by large _",

    "a better understanding of these objects is the knowledge of the non - continuous mechanisms triggering the present star formation . among different hypothesis , cyclic infall of colded gas , galaxy interactions and collapse of proto - clouds",
    "are proposed . from a sample of 6 bcgs + 2 star forming galaxies , stlin & al .",
    "( 2001 ) , amram & stlin ( 2001 ) , proposed that the star formation is triggering by recent merging of gas rich objects .",
    "if the present environment of these objects is relatively poor , it could have been different in a recent past .",
    "a more complete sample of about 20 galaxies has been observed and is presently analyzed .",
    "nevertheless , to achieve more conclusive results , careful calibration should be done with similar but isolated galaxies that do not experience star formation burst .",
    "indeed , a massive star formation could induce strong winds affecting the gas dynamics .",
    "galaxies in compact group of galaxies ( cggs ) ( 1 ) are the galaxies in the more dense environment of the nearby universe ( 2 ) experiencing high rate of galaxy - galaxy interactions and sometimes galaxy - intergalactic gas interaction and ( 3 ) are probably also progenitor of galaxies in formation ( tidal dwarf galaxy candidates in heavily interacting systems ) in that way , they mimic the early universe . nevertheless , they are different from the first galaxies because they are generally large galaxies and are not so different from field galaxies .",
    "it is really a challenge to quantify in these galaxies the rate of interaction and merging with respect to the evolution of cggs . from a sample of 31 groups ( for a total of 104 galaxies ) ,",
    "see plana et al in the present proceeding , we are going ( 1 ) to classify the groups in different evolutionary stages of the group ( merging groups , strongly interacting groups , weakly interacting groups , non - groups and single irregular galaxies ) ; ( 2 ) to built the tully - fisher ( tf ) relation cggs and ( 3 ) to search for tidal dwarf galaxy candidates . here",
    "also it is absolutely obvious that the calibration of the tf relation as well as the systematic studies of kinematical perturbations with respect to their dense environment need a reference sample of isolated galaxies obtained and analysed homogeneously with the same techniques .",
    "galaxies in clusters are probably observed at more advanced stages of interactions than field galaxies with respect to _ hi _ deficiencies , _ hi _ and @xmath0 truncated disks , low star formation rate ( by the lack of fuelling gas ) , associated radio sources ( see e.g. vollmer et al 2000 an example in virgo and gavazzi et al .",
    "2001 for an example in abell 1367 ) . in clusters",
    ", an observational kinematical link is probably missing between the relatively weakly disturbed spirals and the large ratio of early type galaxies supposed to be formed from these spirals . for cluster galaxies also , a reference sample of isolated galaxies is dramatically needed to quantify the kinematical perturbations in spiral -if any- and the processes of violent relation leading to the observed high fraction of lenticular and elliptical galaxies .",
    "the same type of arguments could be declined for shells in early - type galaxies that are considered among the `` bona fide '' signature of a past interaction event .",
    "dynamics of warm gas component , present in some shell galaxies combined with stellar populations is used to constrain the accretion / interaction episode ( see rampazzo et al in the same proceeding ) .",
    "identically , binary galaxy - galaxy interactions , for which the rcs are often non - flat ( see isaura fuentes - carrera in the same proceeding ) should be interpreted through the frame of a reference sample .",
    "* the distant universe . * up to now , few observations using long - slit spectroscopy at relatively low spectral resolution with very large telescopes have revealed the kinematics of distant galaxies . with the arrival of intermediate spectral resolution instruments on 8-meter class telescope ( e.g. giraffe on the vlt ) , in the next years",
    ", 3d samples of high redshift galaxies will be studied ( see chemin et al .",
    ", this proceeding ) .",
    "the comparison with 3d local samples like ghasp will be necessary to disentangle the effects of secular evolution from the effects link to the environment like those described in the previous section .",
    "dwarf galaxies are dark matter - dominated galaxies where the stellar population make only a small contribution to the observed rc , sometimes less important than the gaseous contribution .",
    "it is therefore straightforward to compare the observed rcs of these galaxies with those derived from numerical cosmological simulations , where the dark matter is the dominant component .",
    "* _ hi _ observations .",
    "* a neutral hydrogen analysis of a sample of 60 rcs of late - type dwarf galaxies has been performed by swaters in his phd thesis ( 1999 , hereafter refereed as s99 ) .",
    "the s99 s observations is a part of the whisp ( westerbork survey of _ hi _ in spiral galaxies ) led at westerbork ( netherlands )",
    ". began in 1993 , whisp is a survey of the neutral component in spiral and irregular galaxies with the westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt ) at 21 cm wavelength .",
    "its aim is to obtain maps of the distribution and velocity structure of _ hi _ for some 500 galaxies .",
    "such a uniform database will serve as a basis for research in many areas : dark halos , effects of environment on the structure and growth of _ hi _ disks , galaxy distances .",
    "more details can be found on the web site http://www.astro.rug.nl/@xmath2whisp/. once computed from the _ hi _ velocity fields , the s99 s rcs were refined iteratively by constructing models of the observations , taking the instrumental resolution into account . with this procedure the author corrected for the effects of beam smearing to a large extent .",
    "the beam smearing plays an important role for the steeper rcs , it depends on the inner slope of the rc and on the sampling of the curve ( blais - ouellette et al,1999 ; blais - ouellette et al , 2001 ) .",
    "* comparison of the @xmath0 and _ hi _ observations * the data for nine galaxies over the nineteen galaxies presented in this paper are discussed in garrido et al .",
    "( 2002 , refereed hereafter as g2002 ) .",
    "the others galaxies will be discussed in fore - coming papers .",
    "the @xmath0 and _ hi _ rcs have been combined using the following simple rule : when @xmath0 data are available they have been used otherwise _ hi _ data were used .",
    "this means that the inner parts of the rcs have been plotted using the @xmath0 velocity points while the outer parts with the _ hi _ data .",
    "the @xmath0 rcs have been shifted to the inclinations determined for the _ hi _ data .",
    "best fit mass models ( bfms ) including three components ( luminous disk , dark halo and hi disk ) have been performed with both data sets ( _ hi _ alone and hybrid @xmath0+_hi _ ) .",
    "the method used in this paper to model the mass distribution is described in carignan @xmath11 freeman ( 1985 ) , slightly generalized in blais - ouellette , amram & carignan ( 2001 ) . the luminosity profile , in the r - band ( s99 ) , is used to probe the mass dominant stellar component .",
    "the luminosity profile is transformed into a mass distribution for the stellar disk ( dash lines in fig . 1 & 2 ) , assuming a constant mass - to - light ratio @xmath12 .",
    "for the contribution of the gaseous component , the _ hi _ radial profile is scaled by 1.33 to account for he ( dot - dash line ) .",
    "the difference between the observed rc and the computed contribution to the curve of the luminous ( stars & gas ) component is thus the contribution of the dark component , which can be represented by a dark spherical halo ( dotted lines ) .",
    "bfms have usually been computed except when the disk vanishes completely , in that case , a mdm is computed as summarized in table 2 .",

    "the @xmath0 rc has a completely different shape as it is rather flat up to 50 arcsec ( 2.5 kpc ) .",
    "nevertheless , there is no @xmath0 emission at radius inner than 20 arcsec ( 1 kpc ) , furthermore the kinematics of the inner regions is not so well constrained . using the _ hi _ data alone , the bfm leads to a weak disk component while the dark halo dominates at all radii !",
    "a bfm for the model hybrid @xmath0/_hi _ rc leads to a _",
    "m / l _ of 0.4 , this low value is unrealistic and is due to the fact that there is no constrain in the inner part of the rc leading to a dominant dark halo .",
    "the mdm for the same hybrid rc leads to a value of _ _ m / l__=4.7 while the dark halo is , in that case , almost negligible . in conclusion ,",
