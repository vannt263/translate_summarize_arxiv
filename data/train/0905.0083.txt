    "vertex detectors for experiments at future colliders such as the superb factory  @xcite or the international linear collider  @xcite will need to fulfill very stringent requirements on position resolution , readout speed , material budget and radiation tolerance . to address these request ,",
    "a high resistivity double - sided strip detector has been designed and fabricated , featuring strips tilted by 45@xmath1 with respect to the detector edge , the striplets .",
    "it is worth noting that in the superb conceptual design report  @xcite this is the baseline solution proposed for the layer 0 of silicon vertex detector . in this note",
    "we report about the sensor design , the readout chip we used , the experimental setup of the test - beam , the data - analysis main features and eventually the results for striplet performance , concerning space - point resolution and hit efficiency .",
    "the striplet geometry is optimized to limit the strip length ( @xmath2 mm ) and the material budget ( double - sided , @xmath3 m thin detector ) .",
    "the strips are thus tilted by @xmath4 with respect to the detector edge , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : striplets ] .",
    "[ striplets ]        the short strip length reduces the average occupancy per channel and allows coping with the increased strip - to - backside capacitance .",
    "the strips are ac coupled , with integrated capacitors and polisilicon biasing - resistors . in order to minimize the dead area along the edges , the resistors are placed outside the guard ring , a solution already adopted for the babar svt sensors .",
    "the detector is fully depleted at @xmath5v bias .",
    "the slim5 experiment was given the possibility of using for a beam - test the t9 facility at the cern ps .",
    "to minimize the effect of multiple scattering on the resolution , we choose the maximum momentum that could be obtained , that is we got protons of 12 gev / c as impinging particles , with spills of 400  ms and typical @xmath6 particles / spill .",
    "the beam profile had a width of about 0.5  cm rms .",
    "for the reference telescope , four silicon strip detectors , 2@xmath72 cm double - sided , ac coupled with 50 @xmath8 m read - out pitch , have been used , one pair upstream and one downstream the device under test ( dut ) .",
    "the modules ( telescope and duts ) were placed on a customized motorized table with remote control .",
    "the two pairs of telescope detectors were placed 40  cm apart , with a fixed 3.5  cm distance between the sensors inside each pair .",
    "the whole setup of the beam test is schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup_testbeam ] , where one can see also the scintillators , used for trigger studies .",
    "the striplet sensor is read out by the data - driven fssr2 chip  @xcite , the second release of the fermilab silicon strip readout chip , derived from the one originally designed for the silicon pixel detector of the btev experiment .",
    "the chip is completely data - driven and operated at 20  mhz readout clock , allowing a maximum data transmission rate of 240  mbit / s over the six available transmission lines .",
    "each chip serves 128 strips , providing the address , the time stamp and a 3 bit amplitude information for all hits .",
    "a total of 384 channels were read out on each side of the sensor by three fssr2 chips , here used for the first time to process also negative signals . among the several programmable options we have chosen to operate the chips at low gain ,",
    "base line restorer selected , 125  ns shaping time , a threshold corresponding to 4400(6300 )  e@xmath9 for p(n)-side respectively .",
    "the same read out is used for the beam telescope detectors .    for calibration purposes ,",
    "an internal square - wave pulser provides voltage steps on the integrated injection capacitance of @xmath10ff .",
    "the injection capacitor discharge feeds the amplification chain .",
    "we evaluate the input noise charge by measuring the fraction of hits over threshold as a function of the input charge at a given discriminator threshold .",
    "the results of the calibrations are summarized in tab .",
    "[ tb : fssr2calib ] .",
    ".calibration results for the striplet detectors .",
    "[ tb : fssr2calib ] [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     it is clear from the comparison that the width of a single gaussian is wider than the central one of the p.d.f .",
    ", due to the presence of misreconstructed hits ; moreover , the fwhm ( rescaled by 2.35 ) matches the single - gaussian width very well .",
    "the slim5 collaboration realized a double - sided microstrip silicon detector , with reduced thickness ( 200@xmath11 ) and strips tilted by @xmath12 with respect to the edge .",
    "the sensor was readout by a data - driven fast chip , the fssr2 , used here for the first time to read negative signals .",
    "the whole detector was one of the duts in a test - beam at cern ps - facility , in which several characteristics were measured .",
    "we find that the detector hit - efficiency was more than 98% , with a space - point resolution ( @xmath13 m ) better than the digital resolution for a 50  @xmath8 m read out pitch ."
