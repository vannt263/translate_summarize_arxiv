    "traffic sign recognition system play a important role in autonomous driving environment and for advanced driver assistance systems . for driving safely and avoiding accident in daily life s",
    "traffic signs are very important .",
    "a smart system that can help human driver by automatic recognition and classification and giving warning will ease driver task . with the advancement of modern vehicles design and safety",
    "this have got a considerable attention . for a human driver because of fatigue , divergence of attention , occlusion of sign due to road obstruction and natural scenes , related to different problems may lead to miss some important traffic sign , which may result in severe accident .",
    "also automatic recognition system will help in proper navigation and to follow traffic rules .",
    "there are several challenges involved in developing a complete traffic sign recognition system , because of occlusion of signs due to different background , specifically trees , building etc .",
    "old damaged signs , weather condition , viewpoint variation , also illuminant changes , in day and night etc .",
    "a complete traffic sign system consist of detection and classification a wide variety of signs .",
    "classification of different class signs having same shape is always a difficult part , since there are very small difference in between lots of traffic signs .        in this work we will present a novel classification techniques based on probabilistic latent semantic analysis .",
    "also we have built a shape classification system based of pyramid of hog features and template matching . for feature representation of final plsa system",
    "well known sift is used .",
    "previously different method which have got state of art result on gtsrb and gtsdb are very complex to train and need supervision . method related to convolutional neural network , neural network , support vector machine are computationally complex and need effort to implement in system like fpga device or other low computationally powerful devices . in our method related to plsa is computationally flexible than previous method , and it is an unsupervised method and use knn classifier at final step .",
    "we will show our result on publicly available german traffic sign ( gtsrb ) database .",
    "we have an accuracy of around 96.86 - 100% over sub category .",
    "rest of the paper is organised as follows , in section 2 we have reviewed existence literature in this area , section 3 describes our main algorithm and section 4 gives detail about dataset and experimental result along with comparison with other existing method .",
    "considerable research work exist on detection and classification traffic signs for addressing the challenged involved in real life problems .",
    "even though it is not possible go through all this research works in this paper we will give brief overview of some relevant works .",
    "most of the work used computer vision and machine learning based techniques by using data from several camera sensors mounted on car roof at different angles . in some of the work researchers explores detection based on colour features , such as converting the colour space from rgb to hsv etc . and then using colour thresholding method for detection and classification by well - known support vector machines . in colour thresholding approach morphological operation like connected component analysis was done for accurate location .",
    "colour , shape , motion information and haar wavelet based features was used in this work [ 12 ] . by using svm based colour classification on a block of pixels le et all [ 13 ] addressed the problems of weather variation .",
    "features like , sift , hog and haar wavelet etc .",
    "was used by some of this work . in german traffic sign recognition benchmark ( gtsrb ) competition ,",
    "top performing algorithm exceeds best human classification accuracy . by using committee of neural networks [ 3 ] achieved highest ever performance of 99.46% , where best human performance was 98.84% .",
    "multiscale convolutional network [ 15 ] has achieved 98.31% accuracy in this dataset .",
    "also other algorithm based on k - d trees and random forest [ 16 ] and lda on hog1 [ 2 ] have got very high accuracy . for recognition purpose group",
    "sparse coding was used by [ 14 ] for rich feature learning of traffic signs recognition .",
    "the aim of the works is to develop a topic based classification frameworks for fast and reliable traffic sign categorization .",
    "discovering hidden topics in images and correlating them with similar topics images form a successful classification algorithm .",
    "since each of traffic sign category can be assumed very well as combination of one or more topics , so we have choose this method over other learning based method .",
    "for classification of the images we have used two step method , in first processing we will classify the shape of the traffic signs and after that we will classify its actual class .",
    "image may have undergone through different type of rotational effect due to viewpoint variation , alignment . in fig .",
    "[ 1 ] main idea concept of our method is depicted . as a prepossessing task we will use affine invariant transform on the images for getting rid of rotational effect .      in this step traffic sign",
    "we will be divided into six class , specifically tringle , square , circle , single - circle , rectangle and hexagon as shown in fig . [ 2 ] . dividing the images in terms of shape help in classification since traffic sign topic most of the time depends on their shape .",
    "different shape class images associated with different levels of dangers in road . getting correct shape of the images is a boost for further classification . for shape representation hog [ 7 ]",
    "is very successful .",
    "hog accurately capture structures of an image , in low resolution of an image it capture high level features leaving fine grained pixels .",
    "this will help us representing the images as different skull shape and getting rid of its inside content .",
    "we have formed first five hog template for reference of five shapes . for classification",
    "a pyramid of hog feature at different resolution of the image is developed .",
    "then a template matching based method is used for classification of its shape to a specific shape from the templates .",
    "this is based on normalization correlation value .",
    "@xmath0\\epsilon r}(t(i , j)-im(i , j))^{2}\\ ] ]      in this step we have image of known shape , for classifying their actual sign on the basis of hidden topic , a probabilistic latent semantic analysis based classification techniques will be used . since image is a very high dimensional data , we will prepossess it to reduce its dimensionality by using visual codebook formation method .",
    "each image will be represented as a bag of visual words .",
    "each visual words will be relevant information stored in those images",
    ".      for extracting meaningful information from images we will use sift descriptor . for object recognition sift is a very popular local descriptor having dimension of 128 .",
    "this descriptor is scale invariant and suitable for object recognition and key - point matching purpose .",
    "sift computation based on construction of scale space .",
    "it uses difference of gaussian filter for locating potential corner points .",
    "actual implementation used 16x16 image patch , and further divided into 4x4 descriptors , resulting a 4x4x16 = 128 dimensional vector .      for the formation of visual words locality constrained linear coding",
    "[ 18 ] based method is used .",
    "this algorithm generate similar codes for similar descriptors by sharing bases .",
    "locality also leads to sparsity .",
    "idea based locality importance more than sparsity is used and given by below optimization problem . here",
    "x is a d dimensional local descriptors , @xmath1 \\in \\re^{dxn}$ ] and @xmath2 \\in \\re^{dxm}$ ] is m dimensional codebook .",
    "@xmath3 @xmath4 @xmath5 where @xmath6 denotes the element - wise multiplication , and @xmath7 is the locality adaptor that gives different freedom for each basis vector proportional to its similarity to the input descriptor@xmath8 .",
    "also @xmath9 is the euclidean distance between @xmath10 and b. shift invariance nature is confirmed by the constraint equation ( 3 ) . in our case",
    "we will have 128 dimension sift descriptors @xmath10 for each image . and we will form a codebook b of size 300 words .",
    "each image will be expressed as a combination of these words",
    ". each image will be represented as histogram of visual words . in fig . [ 4 ] codebook formation idea is depicted .",
    "probabilistic latent semantic analysis [ 7 ] is a topic discovery model , its concept based on latent variable analysis .",
    "an image also can be considered as a collection of topics .",
    "every image can be considered as a text document with words from a specific vocabulary .",
    "the vocabulary will be formed by using k - means algorithm on sift features from training image .",
    "suppose we have a collection of n images(document ) @xmath11 , and corresponding vocabulary with size n1 is @xmath12 . and",
    "let there be n2 topic @xmath13 model parameter are computed using expectation maximization method . in fig .",

    "[ 19 ] techniques is used for getting appropriate topic af a test image corresponding to training images .",
    "fuzzy knn perform better than traditional knn algorithm , because it depends on weight of neighbours . in the training stage",
    "we will calculate @xmath19 , which will be used as input for testing algorithm to compute @xmath20 .",
