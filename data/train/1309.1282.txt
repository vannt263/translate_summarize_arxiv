    "the analysis of their radio map evolution reveals apparent superluminal motion of knots , which follow curved trajectories @xcite .",
    "it is believed that blazar emission comes from a relativistic plasma jet seen at a small angle to the line of sight , with consequent relativistic beaming of the radiation @xcite .",
    "the location of the emitting regions inside the jet and the structure of the jet itself are still a matter of debate .",
    "the observed low - energy radiation ( from radio to uv or even x - rays in some sources ) is due to synchrotron emission from relativistic electrons , which can also produce high - energy ( x- and @xmath0-ray ) photons through an inverse - compton mechanism @xcite .",
    "cross - correlation analysis between flux variations in different bands can allow us to establish whether the emissions come from the same region in the jet @xcite , and in the case that they do not , give an indication of the relative distance of the emitting zones .    to gain insight in the blazar properties , multifrequency campaigns are organised , involving many ground - based observatories as well as satellite observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "some hints of flaring in the x - rays seem to be present at the start of the optical/@xmath0-ray activity , but it becomes clearer later , in agreement with the source behaviour at mm wavelengths . in particular , both the x - ray and mm flux densities reach the maximum value at the end of the period , when the @xmath0 and optical fluxes are instead low . if confirmed , a mm - x correlation with no time delay would imply that both emissions come from the same jet zone and that the x - ray radiation is at least in part the result of an inverse - compton process on the mm photons , as the hard x - ray spectrum suggests .",
    "a dcf analysis on the optical/@xmath0 and mm flux densities indicates a good correlation ( @xmath67 ) , with a time lag of the mm flux variations relative to the optical/@xmath0 ones of @xmath68150 d. the possible scenario therefore is that the radiation we see comes from an inhomogeneous jet , where the mm and x - ray photons are emitted from a region located downstream from that producing the optical and @xmath0-ray radiation .",
    "blazar emission is characterised by variable degree of linear polarisation @xmath69 and electric vector polarisation angle ( evpa ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in several cases the evpa",
    "was observed to undergo wide rotations during active phases .",
    "this is also the case of bl lacertae , both in the radio @xcite and optical @xcite bands .",
    "photopolarimetric observations of bl lacertae were performed by @xcite in 1989 , during an outburst , and in 1990 .",
    "they noticed considerable variability of both @xmath69 and evpa during the outburst and suggested two possible interpretations : a jet pointing nearly towards us with helical magnetic field , or the interplay of a stable jet component with a linearly rotating component .",
    "an analysis of the long - term ( 19691991 ) optical polarisation behaviour of bl lacertae was presented by @xcite .",
    "they found a preferred polarisation direction at evpa @xmath70 and that @xmath69 in general was higher when the flux was lower and the evpa was near the preferred value .",
    "they interpreted the polarisation variability as due to the superposition of new components with randomly distributed polarisation directions on a persistent , underlying source of polarised radiation with @xmath71 and evpa @xmath72 .",
    "the new components lead to a flux increase , but their different evpas make the polarisations cancel one another .    when analysing the optical polarimetric behaviour of bl lacertae around the late 2005 outburst , @xcite discovered a rotation of the evpa of 240 , in the middle of which the degree of polarisation dropped to a minimum .",
    "they inferred that the event was caused by the propagation of a shock wave down the jet along a spiral streamline .",
    "we collected 1014 polarisation data in the @xmath4-band from the calar alto , crimean , lowell ( perkins ) , steward ( bok and kuiper ) , and st .",
    "petersburg observatories .",
    "details on the data acquisition and reduction procedures can be found in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "figure [ pola ] shows @xmath69 and evpa compared to both the @xmath4-band flux densities and 0.1100 gev @xmath0-ray fluxes .",
    "cubic spline interpolations through the 60-day binned light and polarisation curves are drawn to highlight the long - term behaviour .",
    "they show that in average @xmath69 is slowly decreasing during the whole period and that it is higher when the optical and @xmath0-ray fluxes are low , as found by @xcite .",
    "the mean value of @xmath69 is about 11% , but with variations between 0.4% and 45% . in particular , the highest values of @xmath69",
    "are reached during a very fast spike on @xmath73 that has no counterpart in either optical or @xmath0-ray flux .",
    "another polarisation peak occurred on @xmath74 , a few days after the onset of the optical and @xmath0-ray outburst of 20112012 .",
    "the analysis of the evpa is complicated by the @xmath75 ambiguity . to solve for this we proceeded as follows .",
    "we first assembled the various datasets asking that all angles were comprised between @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "we then calculated the average polarisation angle , @xmath34evpa@xmath20 , and iterated the data assemblage by asking that all points are between @xmath34evpa@xmath78 and @xmath34evpa@xmath79 until we reach a stable value of @xmath34evpa@xmath20 , which is about @xmath80 .",
    "the resulting angles are plotted in the fourth panel of fig .",
    "our average optical evpa is very similar to the vlba radio core evpa of @xmath81 estimated by @xcite . according to the same authors ,",
    "the mean vlba jet direction of bl lacertae is @xmath82 , in agreement with earlier vlbi results ( @xmath83 ) by @xcite .",
    "this means that the optical evpa is nearly aligned with the radio core evpa and jet direction",
    ".    spurious jumps of the evpa due to the @xmath75 ambiguity may be corrected by requiring that whenever subsequent points that are separated by less than @xmath84 imply angular variations greater than @xmath28evpa , they can be shifted by @xmath75 in order to minimise the variation .",
    "the choice of @xmath84 and of @xmath28evpa is rather arbitrary . from the analysis of @xcite",
    ", we know that we can have variations as large as about 50a day , so we applied the @xmath75 correction when @xmath28evpa @xmath85 .",
    "the evpa plot in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ pola ] is the result of this procedure .",
    "we notice that points cluster around the mean value ( see also fig .  [ tepi ] ) and that the dispersion around the mean is small before the onset of the 20112012 outburst , while the evpa undergoes much wider changes during the outburst , and this is a general feature , independent of the adopted solution for the @xmath75 ambiguity .    during the very fast spike in @xmath69 on @xmath73 the polarisation angle was close to its mean value , but this is not the case for the @xmath74 event , which was preceded by a rotation of the evpa of about 180  in @xmath86 d. this noticeable evpa variation occurred at the start of the optical outburst .",
    "the other large evpa rotations ( around @xmath87 , @xmath88 , and @xmath89 ) do not correspond to optical or @xmath0-ray events , and are most likely spurious effects , produced by our arbitrary way of treating the @xmath75 ambiguity .",
    "a very rapid tev flare was detected by the very energetic radiation imaging telescope array system ( veritas ) on 2011 june 28 @xcite .",
    "this was accompanied by changes of the radio and optical polarisation angles and was associated with the emergence of a new superluminal knot in the vlba radio maps . from our data",
    "we notice that at the time when the rapid tev @xmath0-ray flare was detected by veritas ( 2011 june 28 , @xmath90 ) , a change in the evpa of about @xmath91 in 1 d was observed , from @xmath92 on @xmath93 to @xmath94 on @xmath95 , and to @xmath96 on @xmath97 .",
    "the event was also preceded by a small optical flare ( 36.86 mjy on @xmath98 ) , and was followed by a fast jump in polarisation degree ( from about 4% on @xmath93 to 12% on @xmath95 and then back to 4% on @xmath97 ) .",
    "in contrast , the gev @xmath0-ray flux did not show appreciable variations in the same period .    in fig .",
    "[ hughes ] we show @xmath69 as a function of the @xmath4-band flux density ; in general , the plot confirms the trend of a decreasing polarisation with increasing flux noticed above .",
    "in particular , this behaviour is marked by the tangled black line , which was obtained by the cubic spline interpolations to the @xmath99 and @xmath69 data shown in fig .",
    "[ pola ] and thus represents the long - term trend .",
    "however , the data scatter is large , and there are several points with polarisation higher than 15% and flux density larger than 40 mjy .      in 2011 october ,",
    "few near - infrared polarimetric observations of bl lacertae were collecteed using the instrument liris @xcite attached at the 4.2 m william herschel telescope ( la palma ) .",
    "liris is a near - infrared public instrument with imaging and spectroscopy capabilities .",
    "polarimetry mode is based on the use of wedowo devices @xcite .",
    "data were reduced using a dedicated package developed within iraf ( lirisdr ) .",
    "the observations of bl lacertae were part of a more extense program gathering near - infrared polarimetry of a sample of blazars .",
    "figure [ liris ] shows the polarisation percentage ( top ) and the evpa ( bottom ) as a function of time in the period of the liris observations , comparing the liris @xmath100 and @xmath101 data to those in the @xmath4 band .",
    "there is a good agreement between the measurements in bands @xmath100 and @xmath101 , and they also seem to fit the trend of @xmath69 and evpa traced by the optical data .",
    "the only remarkable difference is the evpa at @xmath102 , where the optical point is about 30  far from the near - infrared point , but with a large uncertainty .",
    "we conclude that no significant wavelength - dependence of @xmath69 was detected in the considered period , with the exception of an evpa measurement .",
    "evidence suggests that the relativistic jets in blazars are not straight and steady structures ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "indeed , instabilities may cause bends in the jet . the jet may rotate because it is tied to the central black hole or accretion disc , or because the central engine is a binary black hole system @xcite , and thus it may assume a rotating helical structure @xcite . as a consequence",
    ", we may expect that different emitting regions in the jet have different alignments with the line of sight , which can change in time .",
    "because of the relativistic plasma motion , these changing viewing angles by themselves imply variability ( by different amounts at different frequencies ) , even in the absence of intrinsic flux changes .",
    "indeed , the emission from a relativistic plasma is doppler boosted , so that the observed flux density @xmath103 , where primed quantities refer to the jet rest frame , @xmath41 is the intrinsic spectral index , @xmath104 , and @xmath105 for a smooth , continuous jet ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the doppler factor , @xmath106^{-1}$ ] , depends on both the bulk lorentz factor of the plasma , @xmath107 , where @xmath43 is the flow velocity normalised to the speed of light , and the viewing angle @xmath108",
    ". therefore the observed flux can show variability if @xmath109 or @xmath108 change , even if the intrinsic flux remains steady .",
    "in several blazar studies ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we investigated the consequences of assuming that at least the long - term flux variability may be due to geometrical reasons .",
    "we imagine that the emitting jet is a dynamic structure , where different emitting regions can have different orientations with respect to the line of sight , which can also change in time .",
    "the long - term trend of the optical flux density of bl lacertae can be represented by the cubic spline interpolation through the 60-day binned @xmath4-band light curve shown in fig .",
    "adopting @xmath110 , we can derive the doppler factor by @xmath111 , where @xmath112 is obtained by fixing @xmath113 from @xcite and @xmath114 from @xcite .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath115 is shown in fig .",
    "[ lyu ] ; its value ranges from 8.3 to 13.2 . from the definition of @xmath115 we can then derive @xmath108 , also shown in fig .",
    "it oscillates between the assumed minimum value of 2  and 6.8 .",
    "we now investigate what would be the implications of this geometric variability scenario on the observed polarisation .",
    "@xcite calculated the polarisation for optically thin synchrotron emission from relativistic jets with helical magnetic fields .",
    "for some of the jet structures they examined , the behaviour of the polarisation degree can be approximated as @xmath116 with @xmath117 .",
    "the angle @xmath118 is the viewing angle in the jet rest frame , which is related to the observed angle @xmath108 through the lorentz transformation @xmath119 figure [ lyu ] shows the polarisation behaviour predicted by this model , @xmath120 , compared with the long - term behaviour of the observed polarisation , @xmath121 , represented by the cubic spline interpolation through the 60-day binned polarisation curve shown in fig .",
    "although the agreement is not perfect , it is impressive how the model prediction can reproduce the level of observed polarisation and the main variations without introducing any free parameter . in particular",
    ", the amplitude of variation is @xmath122 in both cases .",
    "this model also implies a decreasing @xmath69 for increasing @xmath99 ( see fig .",
    "[ hughes ] ) .",
    "we considered the consequences of varying the value of @xmath109 inside the uncertainty given by @xcite ( @xmath123 ) and of small changes in @xmath124 .",
    "lowering @xmath109 or @xmath124 would amplify the variations toward low @xmath69 values , while higher values of @xmath109 or @xmath124 would produce higher degrees of polarisation with a smaller range of variability .",
    "in @xcite we analysed the polarisation behaviour of the fsrq 4c 38.41 , adopting the transverse shock wave model by @xcite , coupled with the geometrical interpretation of the flux variations described above .",
    "transverse shock waves propagate downstream the jet , affecting the observed polarisation as @xmath125 where @xmath126 is the synchrotron polarisation due to a relativistic electron population with particle distribution @xmath127 , with @xmath128 .",
    "the parameter @xmath129 is the degree of compression of the shock wave .",
    "the angle @xmath118 is the rest - frame angle between the line of sight and the compression axis , which coincides with the jet axis for transverse shocks , and is subject to the lorentz transformation mentioned in the previous section .",
    "figure [ lyu ] shows that for @xmath130 ( the value that produces the same @xmath131 of 20% as the helical magnetic field model , see fig .",
    "[ modello ] ) , the polarisation predicted by the shock model , @xmath132 , is very similar to @xmath120 .",
    "the corresponding behaviour of @xmath69 as a function of @xmath99 is shown in fig .",
    "[ hughes ] . a better agreement between the observed and predicted polarisation",
    "can obviously be obtained by changing the parameter @xmath129 in time , i.e.  assuming that the optical emitting region is crossed by shocks of different strength . in fig .",
    "[ lyu ] we show the time evolution of @xmath129 that would allow the shock model to perfectly reproduce @xmath121 .",
    "the range of @xmath129 variation is 1.102.05 .    choosing a shorter time binning interval for the long - term trend would produce more oscillations in",
    "both the observed and predicted polarisation evolution , without changing the general scenario .    a more sophisticated application of the @xcite model to the optical photometric and polarimetric observations of another bl lac object , s5 0716 + 71 , during the 2011 outburst was performed by @xcite .",
    "they successfully interpreted the general multifrequency behaviour of the outburst assuming a shock wave propagating along a helical path in the blazar jet .",
    "@xcite showed that the degree of polarisation of the fsrq 4c 38.41 increases with the optical flux , also after the unpolarised component likely due to thermal emission from the accretion disc is subtracted .",
    "this was explained by transverse shock waves travelling inside the jet , adopting a high bulk lorentz factor @xmath133 .",
    "in contrast , the shock model applied to bl lacertae can explain the observed anticorrelation between the long - term polarisation and flux ( fig .",
    "[ hughes ] ) .",
    "this is due to the much lower lorentz factor @xmath113 used for this object , which implies a less dramatic aberration of the viewing angle .    in fig .",
    "[ modello ] we plotted both @xmath120 and @xmath132 for the shock model to have the same normalisation of @xmath120 , i.e. @xmath134 . ] as a function of the viewing angle @xmath108 , for @xmath133 ( 4c 38.41 case ) and @xmath113 ( bl lacertae case ) .",
    "we notice how similar the two models are , @xmath120 being slightly higher at a given @xmath108 . starting from @xmath135 ( perfect alignment with the line of sight ) , the polarisation first grows , reaches a maximum at @xmath136 , and then more slowly decreases . in the case of 4c 38.41",
    ", the peak of polarisation occurs at @xmath137 , while for bl lacertae at @xmath138 .",
    "the geometrical interpretation of the long - term optical flux variability of 4c 38.41 led @xcite to infer that the viewing angle of the corresponding emission region varied between 2.6  and 5.3 . from fig .",
    "[ modello ] we can see that this @xmath108 range is on the descending part of the model curves , so that increasing @xmath108 , i.e.  reducing @xmath115 and hence the flux , the polarisation diminishes .",
    "the long - term trend for bl lacertae implies a change of the viewing angle from 2.0  to 6.8 .",
    "this range is on the rising part of the corresponding model curves , so that an increase in the viewing angle leads to a growth of the polarisation .",
    "we have analysed the behaviour of bl lacertae during 20082012 at millimetre , optical , uv , x - ray , and @xmath0-ray frequencies .",
    "a general correlation is found between the optical and @xmath0 flux variations , which are consistent with being simultaneous , suggesting that the observed optical and @xmath0-ray photons are produced in the same jet region .",
    "the @xmath0-ray flux variation roughly goes as the square of the optical one , suggesting that @xmath0-ray photons are produced by inverse - compton scattering of the low - energy synchrotron photons off their parent relativistic electrons ( ssc mechanism ) .",
    "the behaviour of the x - ray flux seems to trace that at mm wavelengths , whose variations follow those at optical/@xmath0-ray energies by about @xmath139150 d. this implies that the mm and x - ray observed radiation comes from a jet zone that is located downstream the optical/@xmath0 emitting region .",
    "the distance between the two emitting zones can be estimated as @xmath140 .",
    "assuming @xmath141 and @xmath142 as adopted / derived in this paper , @xmath143 ranges from 6.5 to 8.2 pc .",
    "this means that the mm / x - ray emitting region is located far away from the agn central engine , outside the broad line region , which extends on sub - parsec scales .",
    "therefore , as in the case of the @xmath0-ray radiation , also the x - ray photons are more likely produced by an ssc process .",
    "the alternative possibility would be that the seed photons for the inverse - compton scattering come from a dusty torus .",
    "following @xcite , the torus external radius can be estimated as @xmath144 which , for a disc luminosity of @xmath145 as derived by @xcite , gives @xmath146 . as a consequence ,",
    "even if the distance of the optical/@xmath0 zone from the black hole were negligible , the mm / x - ray emitting region would be located at the outer bound of the torus . in any case , this picture is questioned by the lack of observable torus emission in bl lac objects @xcite .    a more detailed study of the cross - correlation between different bands is severely limited by even small gaps in the data sampling , because of the extremely rapid variability of the source flux .",
    "optical flares seem to last longer than the corresponding @xmath0 events , maybe because they are a convolution of many more events . indeed , the fact that the optical light curve appears as more structured than the @xmath0-ray curve can only be partially explained by the different sampling .",
    "one possible explanation is that the optical emitting region itself presents substructures @xcite , and that not all of them produce @xmath0-ray photons .",
    "we have suggested a geometrical interpretation of the long - term flux variability , where different emission regions in the jet have different orientations with respect to the line of sight , which can change over time .",
    "these orientation changes lead to observed flux variations even when the intrinsic flux does not vary .",
    "in particular , the viewing angle @xmath108 of the zone producing the optical photons should vary between 2  and 6.8  to explain the long - term trend of the optical flux in the considered period .",
    "we have analysed the consequences of this variable orientation on the evolution of the mean optical polarisation .",
    "we have found that the helical magnetic field model by @xcite , where @xmath69 is a function of @xmath108 only , naturally generates changes in @xmath69 in the same range as that observed and reproduces the main observed variations .",
    "the fact that the model prediction is not able to match the long - term polarisation curve in detail suggests that this interpretation is too simple and that there is something else that we must take into account .",
    "a possible solution comes from the transverse shock wave model by @xcite .",
    "this model gives very similar results to those of the helical magnetic field model for a given choice of the degree of compression of the shock wave .",
    "if we assume that shock waves of different strength can travel down the jet , then the observed long - term trend of @xmath69 can be fully explained .    when coupled with the geometrical interpretation of the flux variability ,",
    "these models offer a simple explanation for the observed correlation / anticorrelation between the long - term polarisation and flux in different sources , which appears to depend on the bulk lorentz factor for any given range of viewing angles .",
